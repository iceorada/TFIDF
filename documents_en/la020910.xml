<LD>The teenage stalker-thriller "Swimfan" grossed $11.3 million to debut
No. 1, eclipsing "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," which has now grossed
$95.8 million over the past 21 weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "City by the Sea" opened in third place with $8.9 million,
followed by "Signs" with $7.9 million and "XXX" with $5.2 million.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the purchase of one ticket bought admission to two of
Sony's early-summer popular movies: "Spider-Man" and "Men in Black
2." The marketing gimmick paid off, although not dramatically, as the
films' combined box office for the weekend reached $2.1 million.</LD>

<HD>A Middle East Crisis Revisited</HD>
<DH>L.A. Opera's presentation of Giuseppe Verdi's first
masterpiece, 'Nabucco,' shines with musical vigor as it tells an
age-old tale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the Middle East, 'twas ever thus: political chaos, ongoing wars
and skirmishes, the good guys and the bad guys often
indistinguishable, an abundance of martyrs and victims, rampant
betrayals, fractious encounters, families torn apart or alienated.</LD>
<LD>   That is the message of "Nabucco," Giuseppe Verdi's third opera and
first acknowledged masterpiece, a biblical-era epic set in the 6th
century and still relevant, particularly in its patriotic and
nationalist themes, today. The work, new to Los Angeles Opera, opened
at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Sunday night and runs in repertory
with Puccini's "Girl of the Golden West" through the end of the
month.</LD>
<LD>   Even with its inconsistencies and weak moments, the score shines
with musical vigor, dramatic fervor and inspired melodies in telling
the story of Nebuchadnezzar (Italianized to Nabucco), the Assyrian
king of Babylon. At war with the Hebrews at the Temple of Solomon, he
also suffers tribulations from his two daughters, is struck by
lightning, and goes mad. The daughters struggle with each other for
power, Nabucco recovers his sanity and converts to Judaism; at the
end, the family is reunited by the death of the scheming daughter,
Abigaille.</LD>
<TE>   The two principal roles, those of Nabucco and Abigaille,
inaugurate the canon of unforgettable characters in Verdi's catalog.
And the chorus, the third protagonist in this work, begins an
operatic tradition still in force today.</TE>
<TE>   The Elijah Moshinsky production, created for Lyric Opera of
Chicago and presented here with efficient stage direction by Thor
Steingraber, is handsomely revealed by lighting designer Alan
Burrett. Still, it is not much to look at, consisting in four acts of
mainly awkward stairs and steps and large and plain set
constructions. And Jane Greenwood's black and red costumes--uniforms,
really--are generally unflattering and unimaginative.</TE>
<TE>   However, the visuals can be unimportant when the singing is right,
and the singing from this cast emerges on a high level .</TE>
<TE>   The Georgian baritone Lado Ataneli can boast one of the
healthiest, roundest, most mellifluous voices on the planet, and he
sings the title role wonderfully. One expects his acting will grow in
projection, intensity and dimension with time. For now, he is
admirable but limited. Maria Guleghina, on the other hand, delivers
all the temperament and colors in her lodestar assignment. Abigaille
is a part that demands complete musical command and subtle acting
skills, combining the heroism of Joan of Arc with the deviousness of
Lady Macbeth. Guleghina lives the role, sings all the notes and
explores all the facets. In a world of false divas, she is the real
thing.</TE>
<TE>   Kate Aldrich reveals unspoiled, handsome vocalism in the difficult
music given Fenena throughout the opera; she also proves herself a
canny, stage-worthy actor. Mexican tenor Jose Luis Duval sings
respectably as Ismaele. Arutjun Kotchinian, a singer new to the
company--and a replacement for Carlo Colombara, who canceled because
he is ill--is a Zaccaria more impressive at the top of his range than
at the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   Prepared by chorus master William Vendice, the large chorus
performed "Va, pensiero" most handsomely, and had to repeat it, as
tradition allows. Both times, the audience cheered. The chorus, in
fact, sang well once the opera was underway, despite a ragged and
raucous beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Foster's presence on the podium proved reassuring in all
the right ways. Things started together and stayed together, and the
orchestra's playing of the Overture was thrilling. From then on, one
felt Verdi was in the best possible hands.</TE>

<KH>The Big Picture / A YEAR AFTER</KH>
<HD>As Usual, Hollywood Is Slow to Focus</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the past couple of weeks I've been getting calls and e-mails from
journalists working on Sept. 11 anniversary pieces, all asking the
same question: Has our pop culture changed since last fall's
terrorist attacks? (That answer is easy: no.) It's the follow-up
question--why not?--that can't be answered quite so easily.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, I came up with an answer that isn't as glib as it might
first appear. I started telling people to watch the MTV Video Music
Awards, which have been endlessly replayed over the past 10 days. If
you want to understand what award presenter David Lee Roth described
as "the front bumper of American pop culture," the MTV awards are the
place to start.</LD>
<LD>   Like so much of today's pop culture, the awards are relentlessly
self-referential and disposably hip, from the fashion and the music
to the videos themselves. I doubt that anyone can remember who won
best rap video this year, much less last September. The show lives in
the moment, which is why it's such a good cultural barometer.</LD>
<TE>   If the MTV awards have a message, it's that our pop culture is
anything but monolithic. More than ever before, thanks to our
omnivorous media outlets, we have a bipolar pop culture; it is
idealistic and cynical, hip and square, serious and trivial,
new-fashioned and nostalgic, all at the same time. The MTV awards
certainly ran the gamut from sublime to ridiculous and back again,
from Bruce Springsteen's inspiring rendition of "The Rising" to
Eminem's bratty petulance to a mournful appearance by the two
surviving members of TLC to Sheryl Crow's somber "Safe and Sound" to
Michael Jackson's wacky acceptance of a nonexistent "artist of the
millennium" award to Shakira, who shook her booty in an outfit that
looked like it had last been worn by Raquel Welch in "One Million
Years B.C."</TE>
<TE>   The show went on almost as long as the Academy Awards, but unlike
the Oscars, which represent black-tie sobriety, the MTV awards are as
giddy as a kid with a helium balloon, capturing what is most silly
and unpredictable--and thus most real--about our culture. One of the
dangers in writing about pop culture, especially in the wake of a
seismic event like Sept. 11, is the temptation to make sweeping
generalizations about the culture and where it's going. Vanity Fair's
Graydon Carter is still being ribbed for loftily predicting the death
of irony, and I'm hardly one to talk, having written a column last
September foolishly forecasting that the terrorist attacks "may have
brought to a close a decade of enormous frivolity and escapism."</TE>
<TE>   We were all as wrong as weathermen are about the weather, probably
because we were speaking from our hearts, not with our heads. Things
haven't changed that much in Hollywood because of the nature of our
pop culture and of the way the movie industry works. In hindsight we
should have known that.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 will always be a signal event in this country's history,
like Pearl Harbor or the Kennedy assassination, but in all honesty,
it didn't change the entertainment industry any more than it changed
the automobile business. People got on with their lives. Vanity Fair
went back to air-kissing Tom Cruise and other celebrities. Cable news
moved on to shark attacks and child abductions.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, everything was basically back to normal within a
month of the attacks. In early October, moviegoers turned up in
droves for "Training Day," even though it presented a disturbing
vision of police corruption at a time when cops and firemen were
being lionized as gung-ho heroes. That doesn't mean we don't want to
see good cops too--how would network TV survive without 'em? It's
simply another example of our bipolar culture: We find gangsters and
thugs just as compelling as any saints or heroes.</TE>
<TE>   The MTV awards are also a bracing reminder that in a messy
democracy like America, our culture is full of contradictions. It
doesn't travel in one straight line, it lunges left and right,
forward and backward.</TE>
<TE>   MTV isn't the only place where Michael Jackson and Rudy Giuliani
are on the same stage. I flipped over to NBC the other day and found
Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) gravely discussing momentous world
events on "Meet the Press," full well knowing he'll pop up on TV
later in the year, this time as an actor, putting crooks away on "Law
&amp; Order."</TE>
<TE>   Pop culture is America's ultimate melting pot. Turn on Top 40
radio and you can hear everything from steamy funk like Nelly's "Hot
in Here" to cloying pap like Kelly Osbourne's "Papa Don't Preach." On
TV, you can find hit shows with the cerebral elegance of "The West
Wing" or the kitschy corn of "American Idol." The movie industry's
current box-office chart has just as much reach, with the
ultra-old-fashioned "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" attracting as many
moviegoers as the ultra-hip "XXX."</TE>
<TE>   What the movies don't do is make films about touchy topical
subjects, which is why there are virtually no Sept. 11 projects in
the works at major studios. A big part of this is simply demographic:
Hollywood is in the youth culture business. Its mandate is to provide
its teen fan base with comic-book heroes and escapist comedies.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many people find it perplexing that Hollywood has taken
such a hands-off attitude toward Sept. 11 when the news media has
covered the story so extensively. The truth is that the news media's
often obsessive coverage has in itself discouraged filmmakers from
pursuing the topic.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, what story could you possibly tell that hasn't been on
Larry King?" asks Danny Goldberg, head of Artemis Records, which will
soon release a Steve Earle CD that includes a controversial ballad
about John Walker Lindh, the jailed American Taliban. "Pop culture
rarely mirrors what's just been in the news. You go to the movies to
get away from what's in the news."</TE>
<TE>   But it's also fair to say that Hollywood has largely divorced
itself from the nitty-gritty of today's pop culture. Like MTV, the
studio films are intensely youth oriented, but unlike MTV, the movies
strip away most of the culture's rough edges.</TE>
<TE>   Most studios are scared by scripts that are too edgy or original,
so they buy a lowbrow comedy or a predictable thriller--and then hire
an ultra-smart screenwriter to do a rewrite that gives it a hip
sheen.</TE>
<TE>   It's no wonder Hollywood has become such a lumbering, top-down
business--everything has to get retouched and enhanced before it can
finally go before the cameras.</TE>
<TE>   At some studios, even though a year has past, they're still
debating how to deal with Sept. 11. In pop music, the topic is
already old hat--everyone from Bruce Springsteen to Neil Young to
Toby Keith has penned Sept. 11-related songs. Musicians can react
almost as fast as CNN--they don't need a studio greenlight to get a
topical song on the radio. Ditto for network TV: "The Practice" had
an episode earlier this year about a woman whose husband was detained
in Guantanamo Bay as a suspected terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   The movie business moves at a glacial pace. Disney, for example,
has been working on a new version of "The Alamo" for years. The
script was languishing when, in the days following Sept. 11, Disney
chief Michael Eisner seized on the idea that American audiences would
embrace "The Alamo's" stirring last-stand heroics. The project was
kicked into high gear, but nearly a year later, the movie is still
unmade, slowed by a series of rewrites and battles over the film's
budget.</TE>
<TE>   Compare this to Disney-owned ABC, which has a TV movie in the
works (also at Eisner's behest) about the nine Pennsylvania coal
miners who were rescued this summer that could be on the air as early
as February.</TE>
<TE>   But just because people are in a flag-waving mood politically
doesn't mean they're feeling patriotic culturally. The last time we
were in a prolonged war, during the height of the late-1960s
escalation of the Vietnam War, you could watch firefights on the TV
news every night, but you saw few signs of the raging conflict at the
local movie house. Hollywood's first crop of great Vietnam
movies--"The Deer Hunter," "Apocalypse Now" and "Coming Home"--didn't
hit the screen until a decade later.</TE>
<TE>   The one constant about our pop culture is that it's restless and
unpredictable, always embracing new ideas and fashions at a dizzying
speed. At MTV, shows rarely stay on the air for more than a couple of
years. Their programmers know the channel's audience is always hungry
for the next New Thing.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, the studios have stopped trying to keep up; they'll
settle for the next Old Thing. Their major response to Sept. 11 is a
belief that we crave men of valor, a hunch bolstered by the
box-office success of "Gladiator."</TE>
<TE>   So studio development slates are chock-full of historical dramas
about Alexander the Great, Hannibal, Constantine, King Arthur and, of
course, the warriors who died at the Alamo. History is a safer place
to find unqualified heroes, especially ones who haven't been
overexposed on CNN.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When a concert of Brazilian music can't trigger much more than some
mildly enthusiastic applause and a minimal amount of dancing in the
aisles, something hasn't gone quite right.</LD>
<LD>   With Ivan Lins as a headliner, and veteran jazz and bossa nova
singer Leny Andrade on the bill at the Hollywood Bowl on Sunday, one
might have hoped for a more vigorous response. But it wasn't until
Lins climaxed his set with the spirited, all-join-in melody and
rhythms of "Tristeza" that the moderate-sized crowd finally began to
stir.</LD>
<LD>   That's not to say that samba dancing in the aisles is the sole
criterion for a first-rate program of Brazilian music. But the
ambience of outdoor amphitheaters such as the Bowl and the John Anson
Ford have in the past generated extraordinary blends of superb music
and energetic entertainment from acts such as Caetano Veloso,
Gilberto Gil, and, in fact, Lins.</LD>
<TE>   As it turned out, this concert did include some dazzling music.
But it arrived early, in the stunning opening set by singer Monica
Salmaso. Her program was a masterful collection of styles and sounds,
moving from traditional music into a gorgeous resetting of the
Beatles' "Blackbird."</TE>
<TE>   Salmaso's voice is one of the most attractive to arrive from
Brazil in recent memory. But beyond her wide vocal range and warm,
velvety timbre, she also worked within musical settings that were
filled with subtle creative aspects. Much was made of open space, of
minimal percussive sounds and the juxtaposition of differing musical
elements--all coming together into a propulsive platform of rhythm
and sound to support Salmaso's imaginative renderings. She is an
artist to be watched, one with extraordinary potential.</TE>
<TE>   Andrade's approach was different--understandably, since she comes
from a generation of singers that venerated Ella Fitzgerald and
American jazz. But despite her articulate scatting and constant
enthusiasm, much of her set had a dated, even lounge-act quality.</TE>
<TE>   Lins' performance was similarly lacking in impact, at least
initially. Nor was his flow particularly aided by the odd scheduling
that interrupted his set for a few songs by guitarist-singer Dori
Caymmi (who sounded, as always, first-rate) and singer Leila Pinheiro
(who did not). It wasn't, in fact, until the two sparkplugs in Lins'
ensemble-- pianist Marcos Brito and drummer Teo Lima--kicked into
action that the music rose to the level one anticipates from this
gifted veteran.</TE>

<HD>Singing the Blues</HD>
<DH>In 'Blue,' with Phylicia Rashad and Diahann Carroll,
relatives struggle with memories, life choices and one another.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the Pasadena Playhouse, the pairing of Phylicia Rashad with
Diahann Carroll in "Blue," Charles Randolph-Wright's seriocomic tale
of a prosperous black Southern family, would be an event if the play
were as good as its actors.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Rashad and Carroll (who won a Tony Award in Richard
Rogers' "No Strings" 40 years ago) as bickering mother and
mother-in-law give fine performances in roles written in such broad
strokes that even as we enjoy the occasional laugh line, we find it
hard to be drawn into the deeper meanings director Sheldon Epps
attempts to extract from this fractured family drama.</LD>
<LD>   It begins promisingly enough with a lone trumpeter onstage, a
young man (Jacques C. Smith) who will soon be joined by his
12-year-old former self (Jovun Fox) announcing the importance of
music in his life.</LD>
<TE>   They are, together, the character of Reuben Clark, the younger of
two sons of a funeral parlor owner (Clifton Davis), who is the
hard-working head of a household dominated by an overbearing,
grasping matriarch, played by Rashad. The older son, Sam (Chris
Butler), illustrates how in an African American family the generation
gap was once represented by an Afro wig, a disco shirt and a diet of
the Ohio Players.</TE>
<TE>   Peggy, the mom, a former fashion model, aspires to a life of
bourgeois attainment while still carrying a torch for a famous soul
singer named Blue Williams she once dated in Chicago before
middle-class security lured her into the cultural backwoods of South
Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   When she drops Williams' LPs onto her turntable (telling us this
is a memory play and the 1970s), Williams, mostly just called Blue,
appears on a scaffolding in the form of talented singer Michael
McElroy, giving live voice to the cool balladry of tunes by the
notable former Patti LaBelle collaborator Nona Hendryx. McElroy,
sheathed in a shiny blue suit and blue shirt, is a great presence,
suggesting a cross between Lou Rawls and Luther Vandross, but his
fitful appearances have an authority the script itself lacks, which
is not a good strategy for a play with music.</TE>
<TE>   In an early scene indicative of the play's crowd-pleasing humor,
Rashad has a thinly disguised orgasm (or the memory of one) while
listening to Blue and forgetting that 12-year-old Reuben is seated
next to her on the couch.</TE>
<TE>   Reuben at first seems to be offering himself up as the story's
narrator, recalling the device of Warren Leight's "Side Man," seen at
the playhouse last year. But his role as narrator is largely obscured
as the present-time action in the Clark household unfolds in all its
multigenerational conflict. Grandma Clark, known as Tilly (Carroll),
comes to pay a visit, and it immediately becomes clear that Peggy is
not the woman she would have picked for her son, and she doesn't try
very hard to hide her feelings in the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Much is made of this familiar comic battleground (as familiar in
black as in white), easily mined for humor at some distance from
experiencing the truth of it, as playwrights and other scenarists
have shown for ages. The arrival of disapproving Grandma, played with
a withering hauteur by Carroll, offers a glimpse of status anxieties
among contemporary African Americans that might come as revelations
to some in the playhouse audience, but probably no more than the
information gleaned from "The Cosby Show," in which Rashad starred.</TE>
<TE>   When a scheming lower-class girlfriend of the older son crashes
Grandma's first dinner at the house, the discomfort level at the
table is similar to what it would be if the Ivy League son of a white
CEO brought a loudmouthed waitress home to meet the family.</TE>
<TE>   When the coarse girlfriend, LaTonya (Felicia Wilson), and
culture-conscious mom suddenly bond over their mutual infatuation
with Blue, are we really so surprised? It makes for a good story, or
at least the outline of one. And when LaTonya manages, through Peggy,
to meet Blue and then--oops--run off with him, Peggy is not amused.
Meanwhile, we wonder if Blue couldn't do better. It's a plot turn
that has everything going for it except believability.</TE>
<TE>   At the point in the play that we begin to ponder what is truly at
stake here in the saga of this funeral parlor clan with the
struggling trumpeter, the specter of Blue and a mother and
mother-in-law who don't get along, we also begin to doubt that
Randolph-Wright is going to make that any clearer than he has to.</TE>
<TE>   Fueled by the fragments of amplified sweet soul music (McElroy
croons over recorded accompaniment) and the jokes built on the
reliable foundations of jealousy, snobbery and generational
misunderstandings, the time passes and people get entertained. Only
there are no breaks for commercials.</TE>
<TE>   Randolph-Wright and Epps, who together staged "Blue" in previous
incarnations off-Broadway in New York and at the Arena Stage in
Washington, D.C., aspire to something grander than sitcom patter and
pathos here, and as an audience we aspire with them until we see that
the payoff is going to be all too pat and preordained.</TE>
<TE>   Spanning almost 20 years, from the '70s into the '90s, "Blue" sets
out to measure how life's vicissitudes both scar and toughen its
characters, but it tends to lose focus on its 2 1/2-hour journey.
It's Reuben's story, it's Peggy's story, it's the story of Blue. If
the play has one question to ask, it seems to be how we will evaluate
Peggy, the fallen grande dame at the center of this fractious,
upwardly mobile unit of African American domesticity. Is she, as her
two very different sons have experienced her, a bludgeoning
taskmaster with obnoxious airs? Or is she, with all her faults, the
great untidy life force that her good-hearted husband Sam argues has
given him reason to go on?</TE>
<TE>   The play finally wants to have it both ways and, steering away
from the tragic turn that could easily overtake these same characters
and events, it manufactures a final reconciliation that is
heartwarming but softheaded.</TE>

<LD>   Harrison Album Slated for November Release</LD>
<LD>   "Brainwashed," the album George Harrison was working on until two
months before he died, will be released Nov. 19.</LD>
<TE>   Produced by Harrison, his son, Dhani, and Jeff Lynne, the Dark
Horse-Capitol Records project features 11 new Harrison compositions,
the first release of new material by the former Beatle since 1987's
multi-platinum "Cloud Nine." Harrison died Nov. 29, 2001, at age 58.</TE>
<TE>   According to Lynne, Harrison and his son collaborated extensively
on pre-production. After he died, Lynne and Dhani Harrison spent much
of the year completing the work.</TE>
<TE>   "George would come 'round my house and he'd always have a new song
with him," said Lynne, one of Harrison's bandmates in the Traveling
Wilburys. "He would strum them on a guitar or ukulele, [and they]
just knocked me out. George constantly talked about how he wanted the
album to sound, and there was always that spiritual energy that went
into the lyrics as well as the music."</TE>
<TE>   Simon Focusing Sights on Song for Movie</TE>
<TE>   Paul Simon is putting the finishing touches on a song for the
movie "The Wild Thornberrys," his first film tune in 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   The animated project, based on the Nickelodeon TV series from the
"Rugrats" team of Arlene Klasky and Gabor Csupo, is a
pro-environmental tale set on the plains of the Serengeti. It is a
production of Nickelodeon Films and Paramount Pictures and is
scheduled for release Dec. 20</TE>
<TE>   Simon did not attend the screening of the film at the Toronto Film
Festival on Sunday. Lynn Redgrave and Tim Curry, who supply voices
for the film, raised the glitter quotient for the event, however.</TE>
<TE>   PEOPLE</TE>
<TE>   Duke, Lightfoot, Lewis Under the Weather</TE>
<TE>   Patty Duke was reported in good condition Monday after suffering a
concussion and skull fracture last week when she tried to apply fly
spray to a horse in her barn.</TE>
<TE>   The 55-year-old Oscar winner ("The Miracle Worker"), who lives in
northern Idaho with her husband, Michael Pearce, was moved out of the
intensive care unit at the Kootenai Medical Center in Coeur d'Alene
over the weekend. Her prognosis is excellent, her husband told the
Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies quoted Pearce as saying that he left the barn
while Duke was about to apply the spray to a 2-year-old filly. Then
he heard a thump and his wife cried out. When he got back inside, he
saw Duke on the floor of the stall, apparently knocked down by the
horse.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Lightfoot, meanwhile, is recovering from emergency stomach
surgery for an unspecified ailment on Sunday. The 63-year-old
singer/songwriter was rushed to McMaster University Medical Center in
Hamilton, Ont., Canada, Saturday night, shortly before he was due to
perform at the Opera House in nearby Orillia, 50 miles north of
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Haynes, a member of Lightfoot's band, said that Lightfoot was
in an intensive care unit and was conscious, although he did not
elaborate on the procedure. "He's definitely getting better. He's not
in as much pain as he was in yesterday," Haynes said. '</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Lewis had to cancel an appearance at the London Palladium
Sunday after experiencing dizziness backstage. A spokesperson at his
Las Vegas office reported that the comedian was feeling fine Monday
and is scheduled to return home shortly.</TE>

<TE>   Palestinian Film Festival Planned for April</TE>
<TE>   Despite conflict in the Middle East, organizers announced plans
for what they describe as the first international film festival in
Palestinian territory.</TE>
<TE>   The Ramallah Film Festival is to take place April 4 to 9 in the
West Bank city, said its director, Adam Zuabi.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be an international film festival whose main idea is to
bring a little fantasy to this place, in order to make it easier for
the people to cope with their reality and see beyond it," he said.
"The festival will not be a competitive one and will not profess any
particular theme."</TE>
<TE>   The event, financed by international organizations and with
private support, also has some celebrity support. Among its backers
are actress Vanessa Redgrave, Bosnian director Danis Tanovic (the
Oscar-winning "No Man's Land") and Italian director Ettore Scola.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Should Bruce Vilanch ever relinquish his Oscar telecast gig, the
motion picture academy might prevail upon writer-director Gerard
Alessandrini to fill the joke-writing breach. Judging from his
wickedly funny "Forbidden Hollywood," playing a limited engagement at
the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, Alessandrini
is up to the challenge.</LD>
<LD>   Like its parent phenomenon "Forbidden Broadway," "Hollywood"
operates as ruthless cabaret, putting the silver screen through a
Cuisinart with the lid off.</LD>
<LD>   The format and much of the material is identical to the show's
1995 Coronet Theatre premiere, although Alessandrini has nipped and
tucked for topical content. It begins in deceptively ingratiating
manner, with expert performers Eric Gutman, Eric Lee Johnson, Kathryn
Kendall and Leisa Mather selling the Leonard Sillman-esque title
number to musical director Matthew Ward's redoubtable accompaniment.</LD>
<TE>   The evening quickly bares its fangs with "You Shouldn't Be in
Pictures," in which Mather, Kendall and Gutman savage Renee
Zellweger's Nurse Betty and Bridget Jones, Melanie Griffith's
maternal connections and Keanu Reeves' first name.</TE>
<TE>   Offenbach flourishes herald Nicole Kidman (Mather), whose "Moulin
Rouge" get-up, complete with attached swing, is perhaps the standout
of Alvin Colt's invaluable costume parade. As choreographed by
Phillip George, the subsequent number, "Pre-Nups Are a Girl's Best
Friend," cuts to the tabloid marrow.</TE>
<TE>   Equally inspired is "Summer Movies," appropriating "Summer Nights"
from "Grease." Mather's Gwyneth Paltrow and Johnson's Batman sing
"Tell me more, tell me more/Do they blow up a car?/Tell me more, tell
me more/Is Mike Myers the star?" With the entrance of Gutman's Austin
Powers and Kendall's Queen Amidala, pandemonium ensues.</TE>
<TE>   Not everything carries the same Swiftian thrust. The two Streisand
riffs, though well-performed, cancel each other out, and the Winona
Ryder sendup is upstaged by the props. Despite Mather's hysterically
toneless Dietrich in "Falling Apart Again," two plastic surgery
numbers seem redundant.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Alessandrini's writing displays pith and vinegar, and his
four-member cast of thousands is comparable to any this franchise has
employed through the decades. Thus, when Kendall's Toto-hating Judy
Garland and Gutman's sandpaper-voiced Gene Kelly and Mather's Vivien
Leigh and Johnson's Hattie McDaniel collide with audience nostalgia,
you forgive "Forbidden Hollywood" for the occasional stale popcorn
kernels, because beneath its lampoonery lurks the affection of a
genuine fan.</TE>

<LD>Grieving in private over acts of terrorism was not enough for three
Southland artists, who chose to reach out to their communities in
acts of remembrance.</LD>
<LD>   Conductor Rachael Worby decided to participate in a worldwide
event. The artistic director of Avaz International Dance Theatre,
Jamal, made a dance available to all comers in six cities. Composer
Sharon Farber sent an unsolicited new work to the Los Angeles Master
Chorale, and the ensemble's conductor, Grant Gershon, was so taken by
it that he added it to the opening program of his season.</LD>
<LD>   Worby had been looking for something to do to commemorate Sept.
11. "I'd been pursuing ideas that involved music and people and
community," she said, "but had not really embraced one notion that I
thought would be powerful enough."</LD>
<TE>   That's when she discovered an idea that got its start in Seattle:
a "rolling" global performance of Mozart's Requiem.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire world wrapped in the arms of Mozart's Requiem--I
couldn't imagine not being a part of such an extraordinary tribute,"
she said. "Musicians all over the world have been hungering to be
able to touch people with what they do best, which is quiet the soul
and heal the spirit."</TE>
<TE>   So Worby signed on to lead her Pasadena Pops Orchestra and more
than 200 singers in Mozart's work, outdoors at Pasadena City Hall.
(At least one other local choir, the Santa Clarita Master Chorale,
will participate as well, at the United Methodist Church in
Valencia.)</TE>
<TE>   All the performances will begin at exactly 8:46 a.m. in each time
zone on Wednesday--marking the time that the first airplane crashed
into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The concept originated with members of the Seattle Symphony
Chorale, who were approached after a January performance of the work
by a patron who envisioned a choir singing the Requiem at ground zero
in New York, with one singer for each person who died.</TE>
<TE>   "The logistics of that were impractical," said Madeline Johnson, a
chorale singer and chairwoman of the Seattle Rolling Requiem
committee, established in February. "So we thought another good idea
would be to ring the Earth. We began e-mailing and snail-mailing
invitations to choruses around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Within 24 hours we heard from Riga, Latvia: They're going to have
19 choirs singing in their cathedral. By late June we had 30 choruses
lined up. Now there are more than 180 choirs from 25 countries, and
21 time zones are represented and we continue to hear from people
daily."</TE>
<TE>   The Requiem will start in New Zealand and end in Samoa. The
California performances will begin 20 hours after the first
performance.</TE>
<TE>   Jamal, who was born in Iran and has been in the U.S. since 1976,
has been mulling a Sept. 11 response from the day the towers were
attacked. The head of a folk dance troupe that focuses on Central
Asian and Middle Eastern dance, he says the attack changed his life,
in part because of the "way I look."</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a few but direct reactions from people," he said. "The
terrorists gave people all the reason for that, but I was devastated
for days.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though that evil act wasn't crafted in Iran, I was hoping
for some sort of comfort for myself and felt other people should know
that we Iranians are basically part of the sorrow that the victims
are going through, too.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it would be great if I could create a piece. Then I
realized I already had a piece, which I choreographed early in 2001.
It was an evocation of a mourning ceremony that I saw many years ago
in Iran."</TE>
<TE>   He started calling friends in the L.A. dance community; the idea
was to schedule a performance for as many dancers as were interested.</TE>
<TE>   Dancers from companies run by Ramaa Bharadvaj (Angahara), Gema
Sandoval (Floricanto/Danza USA), Gustavo Gonzales (AguaLuna) and
Linda Yudin (Viva Brazil) quickly took it up. As word spread beyond
L.A., Jamal sent videos, dance notation and a recording of the music
to dancers in San Francisco; San Jose; San Diego; St. Paul, Minn.;
and Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Now his "Funeral for a Fallen Hero," based on a traditional Muslim
ritual, will be performed Wednesday at noon in L.A. and the other
cities. He estimates that at least 200 people will perform the work,
a six-minute procession of dark-clad men and women walking slowly,
dropping to their knees and performing stylized gestures such as
reaching up or out or crossing their arms across their breasts.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing translated from a personal feeling to a community
feeling," said Jamal. "It's not my piece anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Though not directly responding to the World Trade Center's
destruction, Farber's "Haem Hashlishit" (Mother's Lament)
commemorates another heinous event: the abduction and murder of Wall
Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. Farber, who lives in Burbank,
is a composer who has arranged music for the Los Angeles-based choir
LA Shir, which Pearl's father, Judea, conducted for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   "When Daniel was kidnapped, I was just thinking of writing music
about that," Farber said. "I knew it was going to be a cappella only
because the human voice is so powerful. I was very inspired. It went
very fast. But at one point I had a block. The next day, I think, he
was murdered. That released all of my emotions."</TE>
<TE>   She recorded the piece with a small group of friends and sent it
to the Pearl family. "I have heard it 17 times," said Judea Pearl, a
professor of computer science at UCLA for 32 years. "It's a very
intense musical piece. The words are very strong. I cannot read the
last two sentences without tears in my eyes."</TE>
<TE>   The work is a setting of a 28-line Hebrew poem by Nathan Alterman,
a Hebrew poet who died in the 1970s and a favorite work of Farber,
who grew up in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "It's painful and dark and about three mothers who are crying
about their sons' deaths," said Farber. "We have been very private
until now," said Pearl, who will be at the concert on Sept. 29.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an outpouring of emotions around us. And we didn't have a
way of responding." The family's approval of the performance is, he
says, one way to acknowledge the sympathy.</TE>
<TE>   Gershon said that although it's unusual for him to program
unsolicited music, the piece stood out for its musicality. "It's
beautifully written for the chorus," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of music comes down the pike these days toward me," he
said. "I really do look at everything that comes in, at least to leaf
through.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very important to me that the Master Chorale is relevant,
is able to speak directly to our community," Gershon added. "But we
were very sensitive of programming a piece that cuts so close to the
bone, for lack of a better metaphor. We made sure that this is
appropriate and sensitive to the concerns of the family."</TE>
<TE>   Farber hopes that the piece will also reach beyond the immediate
family. "It's dedicated to everyone," Farber said. "It could be your
sister, your mother, your brother, anybody who gets hurt. It's
enough; mothers are going through this pain on this side and on the
Palestinian side. It's enough. Why should more people die?"</TE>

<HD>Sept. 11 Shows Begin to Fill the Channels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the sheer volume of Sept. 11 programming reaching critical mass
as the anniversary of the terrorist attacks nears, TV shows about it
are already stacking up, to the extent that some tough choices will
have to be made and VCRs called into service.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight is a case in point, with two exhaustive--if also a bit
exhausting--efforts that would have made ideal programming companions
but are instead butting heads with overlapping time slots.</LD>
<LD>   "Report From Ground Zero" (9 p.m. on ABC), based on the
best-selling book by firefighter Dennis Smith, is constructed as an
extended string of first-person accounts by the men and women on fire
or police duty in New York on Sept. 11. In a number of other cases,
however, we hear not from the principals but from their surviving
colleagues and family members.</LD>
<TE>   Said Lee Ielpi, a retired firefighter who lost his son, Jonathan,
that day: "That cliche we've used for so many years--when people run
out of burning buildings, firemen are running in--I want you to look
at those buildings and I want you to say, 'Firemen looked at that and
ran into that?' You better believe it."</TE>
<TE>   And from firefighter James Efthiamides, who was caught in a
fourth-floor stairwell as the tower he was in began to pancake down:
"You heard metal twisting, and then you heard from far away, 'boom,
boom' as the floors started falling."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the stories are by now so familiar that fresh details or
insights are scarce, but seeing the emotional toll in the eyes of
these people, from a camera set just inches away, still carries a
jolt. And when their voices break as they recall the horrific events
of that day, something inside you breaks as well.</TE>
<TE>   Yet as the two-hour documentary wears on, the effect begins to
wear down, despite the extensive use of Sept. 11 footage and
biographical photos from the lives of those profiled.</TE>
<TE>   "America Rebuilds" (10 p.m. on PBS), which covers the
incomprehensible demolition task engineers faced at ground zero as
well as the debate over the future of the site, also feels a bit
overlong.</TE>
<TE>   The 90-minute documentary, narrated by actor Kevin Spacey, takes
us on searches for survivors, into midnight shift-change meetings at
ground zero and to a community meeting at which one woman, mourning
the loss of a Borders bookstore, called for the rebuilding to begin.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a burial site," replied an angry Monica Iken, who lost
her husband at the World Trade Center. "How can we build atop of
those souls?"</TE>
<TE>   Back at the site, the work continues. As the 275,000-pound
excavators lower their jaws to chew away at the tangle of compressed
steel and concrete, PBS shows engineers who 30 years before had
walked this turf while planning the twin towers plot the removal of
what remains.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Report From Ground Zero" airs tonight from 9 to 11 on ABC;
"America Rebuilds" airs from 10 to 11:30 p.m. on KCET and KVCR.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On weekdays, the 3 p.m. time slot has carved out a well-worn identity
on the TV landscape. This is the domain of talk shows, local news
programs and court squabble-fests. So what is a feel-good reality
show about pivotal events in women's lives doing here?</LD>
<LD>   The producers of "Life Moments," which debuted Monday on KNBC-TV
Channel 4, are hoping the show will become a habit for daytime
viewers looking for something a little different, a little uplifting.
And although they stumble getting there on occasion, initial episodes
of the show pull it off more often than not.</LD>
<LD>   One of Monday's four segments offered a perfect example of this
qualified success. The story involved a single mother who has worked
double shifts while saving for a down payment on a house that will
enable her to finally move out of her grandparents' home. But even as
she grows excited about moving day, she frets that she doesn't have
any money left for furnishings.</LD>
<TE>   Enter NFL star Jason Sehorn, whose foundation has secretly taken
care of that detail and added $5,000 to her down payment to boot. So
when the woman turns the key, she will see a house equipped with
everything right down to the paper towels in the dispenser.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when she gets to the house, Sehorn and the program's staffers
are all out front and, before she can walk through the door, they
tell her what they have done and what she is about to see, which sort
of kills the surprise element.</TE>
<TE>   But when she finally walks through her newly furnished home, her
tears and genuine gratitude manage to save the piece.</TE>
<TE>   Other segments, including those about a woman who carries her
sister's implanted embryo to term and a 49-year-old woman who takes
up tackle football, are similarly marred by production missteps. But
darned if you won't find yourself choked up here and there
nonetheless.</TE>

<HD>Make Message Clear on Teen Sex</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandy Banks</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We lecture, punish, instruct, restrict. But it turns out the best
thing we can do to keep our teenagers from having sex at an early age
may be to make sure they understand that we really, really don't want
them to ... but we're not going to love them any less if they do.</LD>
<LD>   In thousands of interviews with teenagers and their mothers,
researchers recently isolated two factors that seem to best account
for the difference between teens who become sexually active in
adolescence and those who wait: Their mothers' expectations and the
relationship between mother and child.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, your teenager has to know what you think, and care
enough for it to matter.</LD>
<TE>   The good news for mothers in this new research is that we have
more influence than we might think. Teenagers who perceive that their
mothers "strongly disapprove" of them having sex are the most likely
to remain virgins longer than those whose mothers only mildly
disapprove.</TE>
<TE>   But the bad news is that too many of us stumble in conveying that
message: We wait too long or preach too much or rely too heavily on
"the talk" about sexual mechanics to connect with our teens about
sex.</TE>
<TE>   "Being clear to your kids about your values is not a matter of
repeating the same line over and over for 15 or 18 years," explains
Dr. Robert Blum, the University of Minnesota professor who
co-authored the study. "It's using everything around us--newspapers,
music, television shows--as the basis of conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "And it's something that should be done from the time they are
small; talking and listening, telling our kids what we think, hearing
from them what they think, figuring out what they think we think."</TE>
<TE>   Studies show that by the time children enter high school, almost
one-third have already had sexual intercourse. That rises to 60% by
the time they reach 12th grade. And that doesn't include forms of
sexual expression that stop short of intercourse.</TE>
<TE>   As a pediatrician and head of the university's Center for
Adolescent Health and Development, Blum says he is often asked at
what age parents should begin talking to their children about sex.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth of the matter is that our kids are surrounded from the
get-go by a vast variety of sexual messages. Ask what they think,
watch how they react ... Some of us are afraid of putting ideas in
their head. But you look at the data, you see half of all kids who
are having sex, their moms are saying they're not. Our reluctance is
somewhat far removed from our kids' realities."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, one surprising result of the study was how often parents
and children misread each other. Mothers who thought they were giving
firm, clear messages against adolescent sex had children who
underestimated the strength of that disapproval. And mothers who
reported that their sons or daughters were not yet having sex were
wrong 50% of the time.</TE>
<TE>   A father of three, Blum said he understands the parental
discomfort that leads to denial. "It's uncomfortable to acknowledge
your child as a sexual being. We want to maintain an idealized view,
which is to say, for some, we don't want to know. Our kids pick up on
that.</TE>
<TE>   "So, on a gut level, we hold our breath and hope our kids get
through adolescence without getting into too much trouble. For most
of us, we're successful and they're successful, and if they do get
into trouble, they don't tell us until they're 25. But the cost of
that gamble can be very high ... too high for them and for us."</TE>
<TE>   It is certainly not a new concept, this notion that a close family
exerts a sort of protective influence on children as they careen
through adolescence. Studies of everything from academic performance
to substance abuse show a correlation between kids' behavior and
their relationship with their families. Teens are less likely to use
drugs, drink alcohol or have sex when they believe they are loved and
trusted and can communicate with their parents.</TE>

<TE>   Call it "mother-child connectedness," as the researchers do. It

<LD>Rock music blasted from a small radio inside makeup artist Christien
Tinsley's tiny one-car garage, and cigarette smoke swirled around the
tidy workshop behind his small Burbank home. Several busts of male
figures, including one of "XXX" star Vin Diesel, sat on his
workbench. One wall was decorated with photos: Brad Pitt in a white
suit, Matt Damon in glasses and George Clooney covered cuff-to-neck
in tattoos for a cameo in the forthcoming film "Welcome to
Collinwood." A handwritten inscription to Tinsley from the actor
read, "I like this new look."</LD>
<LD>   Clooney, Pitt and Damon aren't Tinsley's only A-list fans. There
are others who are too high profile to mention here, he says. In just
two years, the 28-year-old Seattle native has become Hollywood's
preferred fake tattoo artist.</LD>
<TE>   He earned the reputation by perfecting the easy-to-apply,
authentic-looking tattoo, saving time and money. Tinsley's credits
include Clooney's tattoos for his appearance as a wheelchair-bound
safecracker in "Collinwood," Diesel's tattoos in "XXX," and one for
Pitt--who gave his "Ocean's Eleven" character a tattoo after he
learned of Tinsley's method. (Pitt endured four-hour, daily tattoo
applications for his role in "Snatch," so an easy-on application
method was especially appealing to him.) In the past, actors had to
sit for hours each day of filming while several makeup artists
painstakingly stenciled and painted their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Tinsley's method was born out of necessity. On "Pearl Harbor,"
Tinsley and his crew were overwhelmed by painting battle wounds and
tattoos on hundreds of extras every day during filming. To speed up
the process, he developed a camera-ready tattoo that takes a fraction
of the application time, lasts up to four days and features
computer-generated designs that can be replicated.</TE>
<TE>   The technique--which includes a sticky adhesive on one side that
keeps the tattoo on the skin after it's moistened with water--has
been around for 50 years, said Tinsley. The secret is in the vivid,
long-lasting ink and adhesive.</TE>
<TE>   However simple, the method has caught on. In two years, Tinsley
has supplied tattoos for more than 200 film and TV productions.
Bikers, gang members and ex-con characters drive his business. "We
get a lot of requests for snakes," he said. "Dragons are another big
design." Tinsley himself has resisted the lure of ink on skin. He has
no permanent tattoos of his own.</TE>
<TE>   A Season for Parties</TE>
<TE>   The new TV season is invariably an excuse for parties to launch
series, and despite the fiscal austerity that has gripped networks
and studios, Fox and Warner Bros. Television plunged in with last
week's street-clogging bash for "Fastlane," a new buddy cop show in
the mold of "Starsky and Hutch," only set to an MTV soundtrack and
editing.</TE>
<TE>   Fleshing out the guest list Thursday at the Standard on Sunset
Boulevard in West Hollywood were DJs who had come in for the finale
of Fox's "American Idol" the night before. Attendees were provided
mini-headphones so they could listen to audio for the program over
the blare of music. No one seemed to mind the rain that splashed the
crowd, which included stars Peter Facinelli and Bill Bellamy as well
as "Fastlane" producers McG (who directed "Charlie's Angels") and
John McNamara. Of course, that may be because the Bellinis and
cosmopolitans seemed to empty faster than the hors d'oeuvres.</TE>
<TE>   Let's Do Lunch</TE>
<TE>   Whom would you rather share a meal with? Sandy Berger, Mike
Milken, Andre Agassi, Larry King or Cokie Roberts?</TE>
<TE>   The charity "Communities in Schools" is auctioning off lunches
with celebrities on the Web site www.lunchwithaleader.com to benefit
education. So far, author John Irving heads the list. Last bid, at
press time, for an hour with Irving: $1,550. The latest bid on King,
on the other hand, was $150.</TE>

<TE>   "The [managers] talk about myself or Randy Johnson being
intimidating when we're on the mound. But I've never thought of
myself that way. I'm just focused. If that looks menacing or
intimidating, that's something else. A guy told me a long time ago,
it's like you put $100 in your pocket and the hitter's trying to take
it away from you. That's how I approach it."--Roger Clemens in

<LD>THE FIRST AMERICANS</LD>
<LD>   In Pursuit of Archaeology's Greatest Mystery</LD>
<LD>   By J.M. Adovasio with Jake Page</LD>
<TE>   Random House</TE>
<TE>   332 Pages, $26.95</TE>
<TE>   Powerful intrigue. Name-calling and blackballing. Treachery,
collusion among archeologists on an all-out hunt for a holy grail. An
Indiana Jones movie? No. The actual search to identify the first
humans to inhabit North America. In 1974, archeologist J.M. Adovasio
was a young authority on perishable artifacts--baskets, cloth,
sandals, etc.--looking forward to a life in "a tiny pond in the
mostly stone-filled archaeological landscape," when fate intervened.
Overseeing an excavation designed to teach field techniques to
student archeologists at the Meadowcroft Rockshelter, 35 miles
southwest of Pittsburgh, Adovasio and his team unearthed what turned
out to be the earliest dated archeological site in North America.</TE>
<TE>   The remnants of two hearths in the shelter, when radiocarbon-dated
by the Smithsonian Institution, showed that humans had been using the
hearths in about 13,000 BC, predating by thousands of years the
earliest identified evidence on the continent. "That meant that
people had been here in western Pennsylvania some four thousand years
before any human being was supposed to have set foot anywhere in this
hemisphere," he explains.</TE>
<TE>   Before the discovery, common archeological wisdom held that the
earliest Americans were the Ice Age humans termed "Clovis Man"--so
named for the spear points found in the New Mexico region of Clovis
in the 1930s--said to have lived from 9250 BC to 8850 BC. According
to Adovasio, "no one could find any evidence that people had lived in
North America earlier than Clovis Man," thus, the so-called Clovis
Bar was erected, delineating the point before which no human was
thought to have inhabited these lands, a designation staunchly held
in place by the archeological community for decades. When Adovasio's
discovery threatened the bar, all hell broke loose. His life and
career--and North American archeology itself--would never be the
same.</TE>
<TE>   Adovasio, who became an internationally known archeologist and
academic, has created in "The First Americans" a book that pulses
with plot-drive. The compelling narrative is filled with passionate
writing and fiercely held arguments. Co-written with Jake Page, who
has been an editor at Smithsonian and Natural History magazines, "The
First Americans" illuminates the powerful pull archeology has had on
Adovasio's life and shows how happenstance thrust him into the fiery
fray.</TE>
<TE>   "In the field of North American archaeology--almost never a realm
of courteous and collegial discussions over a bit of brandy before a
toasty fire--it would be putting it mildly to say that hackles have
been raised," he writes of his discovery. "The work of lifetimes has
been put at risk, reputations have been damaged, an astounding amount
of silliness and even profound stupidity has been taken as serious
thought."</TE>
<TE>   Adovasio's tale is well structured, highlighting in brief terms
first his discovery and then giving great detail on the background of
scientific thought until that point. He explains how glaciers work,
the previous and current theories that have been developed as to how
humans arrived here--remember learning about the Bering Strait and
the first humans to trek from Asia through Siberia to North
America?--and the revolution brought to bear on that thinking by his
data.</TE>
<TE>   Having established the framework, Adovasio goes on to narrate his
team's findings in full detail, showing readers how painstaking the
process of excavation can be, how fraught with potential
misinterpretation each uncovered artifact is, how diligent he and his
team were in doing their work, as well as their shock at what they'd
inadvertently found.</TE>
<TE>   The final section of the book recounts the brawls his discovery
set off in chapters with spirited titles like "Fireworks and the
Paleo-Police," in which he describes antagonistic colleagues in
biting terms--one peer is the "grinch of North American
archaeology"--while showing how tightly most scientists hold to their
pet theories even when confronted with overwhelming evidence to the
contrary. Throughout, Adovasio's pull-no-punches approach peppers the
narrative with vigor.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Adovasio acknowledges that he, like other
archeologists, has been unable to seize the holy grail--to answer
definitively key questions about the first Americans. In fact, he
tells us, "thanks to developments over the past couple of decades,
the number of things we don't know for sure about the initial
peopling of this hemisphere exceeds what we do know." In this lively
telling, the journey to learn all the things we don't know has seldom
been more fascinatingly rendered.</TE>

<HD>Where Art Is a Household Word</HD>
<DH>Audrey Irmas' home is a museum-like setting for large works
by big names</DH>

<AU>SUSAN FREUDENHEIM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"What would I be doing if I weren't doing this? Playing bridge three
times a week? I like bridge, but art keeps me from doing that all the
time." Audrey Irmas, the noted philanthropist and collector, laughs
as she offhandedly says these words at the end of a wide-ranging
conversation about her charitable efforts and love of art. She leans
back on the cushy sofa in the den that is the homiest room in her
elegant Holmby Hills residence and shakes her head at the thought of
what could have become of her younger self--a '60s wife and mother
happy just to buy from "those galleries in Laguna," as she puts it.</LD>
<LD>   Hard as it is to believe now, as she sits surrounded by
large-scale, major artworks by some of the late 20th century's
biggest-name artists, there was once a time when Irmas and her
now-deceased lawyer-entrepreneur husband, Sydney, had not yet decided
to plunge seriously into the art market. Self-made and not
particularly self-important, they only started collecting in the
early 1970s at the suggestion of their daughter, Deborah, then a
graduate student in art history. And they started small-scale, with
photography as their first serious focal point.</LD>
<LD>   "I was buying silly little paintings and loving them," Irmas says,
"and Deborah said, 'You should collect photography.' And I said,
'Photography? Why? There's a million people who have the same thing.'
"</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, in the early '70s, photography was hardly considered an
art form because of its ability to be infinitely reproduced, and very
few serious collectors had taken it on. Deborah's intuition that all
that would change, which would soon prove true, eventually persuaded
her mother. But the Irmases wanted a focus. They chose photographic
self-portraits, because they liked the psychological revelations they
contained. Audrey Irmas also found she liked collecting.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun, and it was something we could do together," Irmas
recalls of her jaunts to galleries with her husband. "We could go to
New York and go to galleries. And when you're just starting out,
there's lots of things you can buy. In those days, photos were just
$200 or $300; I think the most expensive photograph I bought was
maybe about $30,000. And Deborah really taught me how to look and to
see."</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, photography was just an entry point. Audrey
Irmas eventually found herself paying more attention to the paintings
she walked past in museums and galleries en route to the photos than
to the photos themselves. "In most galleries, photography's in the
back," she says. "So on the way you see these things and you say,
'Whoa, that's pretty terrific.' "</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, she and Sydney gave all the photos away, creating what is
now the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's prized Audrey and Sydney
Irmas Collection of Artists' Self-Portraits, a large and highly
specialized selection spanning 150 years. The couple donated the
collection two years before a major exhibition of the collection was
mounted at LACMA and four years before Sydney died of leukemia, at
71. Irmas continues to buy for the collection, but now all the
additions are gifts to LACMA.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Irmas lives surrounded by big art. Paintings, sculptures
and a sprinkling of works on paper cover virtually every corner of
her home, which was designed by Santa Barbara-based architect Timothy
Morgan Steele. It is a museum-like setting, a pristine presentation
that now bears the mark of Irmas' strong links to L.A.'s Museum of
Contemporary Art, where she has served as a leading trustee for the
past decade and where she has continued to enhance her appreciation
for the contemporary art scene.</TE>
<TE>   One favorite, she says, is Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein's classic
1961 painting titled "Emeralds," which depicts in comic-strip style a
spaceship pilot muttering to himself, "One thing's sure, he's still
got those emeralds!" Her other favorite is a Cy Twombly untitled
painting from 1968, an abstract scrawl of white curving lines on a
gray plane of color, very different from the Lichtenstein though done
close in time. "They're different," Irmas says, "but I often find
that I am attracted to work from the 1960s, when, as one writer put
it, artists were trying to not be as precious as they were with
Abstract Expressionism. I love both these works because they're so
gutsy. They're strong."</TE>
<TE>   Irmas says the Lichtenstein's comic imagery makes her think of
hours spent in her childhood sitting on the living room floor poring
over newspaper comics like Flash Gordon. "I remember Los Angeles
before we had freeways, and those comics told us what the future was
going to look like," she says. "I really love the spaceship." She put
the painting in a prominent place in her breakfast room so she can
see it without having to consciously seek it out. "I pass it all the
time during the day," she says, "and I love just having it there."</TE>
<TE>   The Twombly, which she bought in 1990, hangs above a mantel in the
living room. She said she had sought a work from this period for
years and was thrilled when she got it. Nevertheless, she finds it
amusing that its simple abstract imagery is sometimes difficult to
explain to friends not in the art world. She neither makes apologies
for it nor is inclined to educate.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's a funny story," she says in her characteristic unabashed
style: "I have a friend who's a high-powered divorce lawyer, and he
had to go to New York to find out the value of some paintings because
of a settlement. He came back and said to me, 'Can you believe this?
There was a painting at Sotheby's that was just a bunch of scribbles
on a blackboard, and it sold for $3.5 million!' I said, 'Yes, I know,
I bought it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Three major works prominently displayed in her home already are
promised to MOCA--a wall-sized gold and lavender triptych by the
German Sigmar Polke, plus two sculptures by the New York-based Robert
Gober, one a finely wrought reproduction of an old-fashioned,
ordinary utility sink and the other a window-like hole in the wall
with prison bars above a small staircase. Irmas also owns many other
works by artists who have been featured in MOCA exhibitions, a
natural overlap for a committed trustee. It's not that the curators
have told her what to buy--she's too strong-willed to be guided by
someone else's taste, they say--but over the years her interests and
the museum's have grown in many of the same directions.</TE>
<TE>   Just this summer, for example, as MOCA's showing of the work of
Andy Warhol was at its peak, Irmas purchased for herself a small
Warhol portrait from an L.A. art gallery. You could call it
coincidence--Irmas loves Warhol's work and had long sought one, she
said. Or serendipity--often works by an artist pop up in the
marketplace in the wake of such a significant show. But Irmas also
was ready to jump, and after asking MOCA chief curator Paul Schimmel
to look at the piece, she did.</TE>
<TE>   Sydney Irmas made his fortune in a variety of business ventures,
much of it with Price Pfister, a Pacoima-based plumbing company.
Although he and his wife collected the photographs together, he was
supportive but less involved in buying the major paintings, Audrey
Irmas says. "That was always my thing. He used to tell people, 'My
wife is great; it doesn't really bother me what she spends, but she
scares the hell out of me when she buys art!'</TE>
<TE>   "He was a businessman; he liked to go out and buy another business
venture, that's what turned him on. But when there was outside
approval for the art, he'd take great pleasure in it." Strong art
collectors are rare among women, perhaps because they often don't
have the funds to pursue the ever-escalating prices of the market.
Irmas says she has sometimes regretted not owning something after
being timid about spending money and has learned to press forward
when she loves a work, by now confident in her own vision of what she
needs to own. "People collect for different reasons," she says. "I
think the reason it really works for me is I'm a collector by myself.
It's all my sensibilities, my taste."</TE>
<TE>   Irmas says she never sells a work of art. If she gets something
home and it doesn't work, she gives it to a museum. "I buy for pure
joy," Irmas says. "It's not speculation; that's for stocks and bonds
and real estate. Not art."</TE>
<TE>   Architect Steele credits Irmas as having the vision for the design
of her house, a space laid out to accommodate large works, which also
need to be seen occasionally by large groups. A Tony Smith sculpture
stands outside the front entrance; a classic painting of a contorted
seated woman by the British painter Francis Bacon--the first major
painting she ever bought--graces a wall just inside the front door.
It is notable--though, she says, unintentional--that many of the
works she has bought are of women or by women.</TE>
<TE>   Irmas' living room looks big enough to be a ballroom. The east
wall is dominated by three huge panels of Polke's larger-than-life
untitled canvas from 1982, which includes images, borrowed from a
work by Goya, of odd-looking faces peering down into a box. Across
the room behind a dining table, the French artist Annette Messager's
"Mes Voeux" (My Wishes), contains a collection of close-up
photographs of body parts--lips, tongues, eyes, nipples--each image
suspended from a string.</TE>
<TE>   In a hallway, Gober's sink seems laughably out of place, but like
all the best conceptual art of its nature, it actually works. Irmas
says she doesn't like to turn the water on too often because it
splashes too much on her floors, but she is careful to keep the
mechanism in working order because that was the artist's intention.</TE>
<TE>   The den has a recent painting of a large, abstracted L.A. street
map by Ed Ruscha that she bought not long ago at a local gallery, and
her bedroom is filled with work by the Italian Arte Povera artists,
known for their use of low-tech, simple materials. (Many related
pieces from these same artists have been on view in an exhibition at
MOCA's Geffen Contemporary.)</TE>
<TE>   Irmas says she is frequently asked to lend works to exhibitions,
and she does so with mixed feelings. It's part of the delicate dance
serious collectors have to do, recognizing that important art never
belongs to any single person. "You're privileged to have it for a
while," she says, "you know that it's a temporary thing, and when you
die, it's going to pass on to the world. You have to care for it, and
hopefully that's a short span in the life of the piece." Irmas said
that she does not expect her three children, all of whom are adults,
to want the collection, but she did not say where it might land one
day.</TE>
<TE>   She also said she doesn't lend her artworks to commercial shows,
only to museums, and even then with discretion. "Since my husband
died, it's harder and harder for me to let things out of the house; I
love my art so much, and it's like members of my family, and I don't
want to see them go. I really miss them. And when they come back,
it's like my kid came home. I'm very attached."</TE>
<TE>   "I do it," she added, "because I know I have a duty. People are
wonderful to me, and I like to reciprocate."</TE>
<TE>   With a motherly manner that is both friendly and matter-of-fact,
Irmas invites a kind of honest intimacy even while she also gives the
sense that she can be hard as nails when she wants to be. Neither
purely socialite nor overtly intellectual, she travels easily in both
circles because she has learned how to be smart, strong and
comfortable with her position among L.A.'s elite. She has a hearty
laugh and a huge heart, her admirers say. And when she talks about
her late husband, she still tears up, without apology.</TE>
<TE>   Her name, as well as that of her family, is often visible on lists
of supporters of MOCA's many exhibitions and projects. She gave
$500,000 to help pay for the 1998 "Out of Actions" exhibition of
relics of early performance art, a show that as a result was
dedicated to the memory of her late husband. She co-chaired the
museum's most recent capital campaign, which raised $25 million for
its endowment, and to which she gave $3 million. Last year, she
stepped down from her position as chair of MOCA, which she had held
since 1997, but she remains vice chair of the museum. She says that
she gives almost exclusively to L.A. institutions because her roots
are here: "We think, why should we give major dollars to a museum on
the East Coast when we have the need here?" It is an attitude that is
rare among L.A.'s arts patrons.</TE>
<TE>   These arts activities stand beside the family's other major
philanthropic efforts, which include support for Jewish causes, such
as a Westside campus for the Wilshire Boulevard Temple named for
Sydney and Audrey Irmas. The family's foundation, also named for the
couple and overseen by Audrey and Deborah as well as Irmas sons
Robert and Matthew, has also been a primary supporter of L.A. Family
Housing Corp., an organization that helps homeless families and today
provides residences for as many as 2,000 families. And last year they
gave a large gift to City of Hope cancer center in Duarte for a
research laboratory because, Irmas says, "it was very painful when
Syd died, and they wanted us to fund a laboratory to help find a cure
for older people with the disease."</TE>
<TE>   "We do things that have meaning for us," she says simply.</TE>
<TE>   "She is an extraordinary giver," says Schimmel, who has worked
closely with Irmas for a decade and considers her a friend. "She
comes from the traditional values of Judaism, believing that you need
to give back to the community. It has sustained her in tough times. I
believe that the same instincts have led her to support the homeless,
Jewish causes and to build her art collection. It all comes from the
heart."</TE>

<HD>Paging Dr. Fido, Report to Recovery, Stat</HD>
<DH>Program's dogs can be a patient's best friend</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIMI AVINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Beverly Hills, where all rooms
are private, patients get used to a parade of strangers entering
their rooms. Henry Cole is far more welcome than the usual hospital
personnel who barge in, intent on completing such errands as drawing
blood or dispensing medication.</LD>
<LD>   Henry is a 75-pound, 4-year-old golden retriever who visits
patients every other week, a volunteer in the hospital's POOCH
Program. His only goal is to be a friend.</LD>
<LD>   POOCH stands for Pets Offer Ongoing Care and Healing, which sums
up the program's mission. "So many patients have no visitors, or miss
their own dogs," says volunteer coordinator Barbara Cowen, who
started the program in the AIDS unit six years ago. "I thought dogs
would bring some warmth and normalcy to an environment that can be
lonely and sterile. The dogs help allay the anxiety patients waiting
for a diagnosis feel, or help patients who are in pain."</LD>
<TE>   So every other week, Henry and his owner, Adrienne Cole, put on
their volunteer uniforms--hers is a pale turquoise smock, his, a
matching bib--and spend several hours brightening the day of
patients, their families and hospital staff. He is one of 35 dogs who
volunteer, accompanied by owners who know the value of pet therapy,
and are as gracious and friendly as their dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation is self-selecting," Cowen says. "Usually, the
people who want to participate in something like POOCH are warm,
caring, good listeners who are genuinely interested in the patients.
There have been a few people who liked the idea of showing off their
cute little dogs but didn't think about what interacting with sick
people would be like."</TE>
<TE>   Janey, another golden retriever, knows what it's like, as do
Vyldie, a Welsh terrier; Maggie, a German shepherd; Smitty, a Tibetan
terrier; Tucker, a Wheaton terrier; Sascha, a cocker spaniel; Toast,
a German shepherd; Bubbles, a Chihuahua; Teddi, an Australian
shepherd and Matt, a Great Pyrenees.</TE>
<TE>   Cole is understandably proud of her pet and enjoys seeing him
comfort, entertain and cheer up patients and their families. "When we
go into ICU, he knows to be calm," she says. "He loves attention and
will climb up on a patient's bed if they want him to."</TE>
<TE>   Henry, in a way, is a four-legged icebreaker, a way for Cole to
interact with patients. Though Henry happily receives the pats of a
series of people in the sixth-floor lobby where friends and family
wait to hear the results of operations, Cole and her handsome,
immaculately groomed companion provide a welcome distraction.</TE>
<TE>   "How old is he?"</TE>
<TE>   "How much does he weigh?"</TE>
<TE>   "What does he eat?"</TE>
<TE>   "He loves people, doesn't he?"</TE>
<TE>   "Did you train him for this?"</TE>
<TE>   "Does he shed a lot?"</TE>
<TE>   The questions are repeated by each new admirer, and Cole responds
as if she'd never been asked before. She's particularly pleased to
see him doing so well as a POOCH volunteer, because when he first
applied for the job, he was rejected.</TE>
<TE>   "I brought him to the hospital to meet Barbara, and he had never
been on an elevator before," she explains. "The environment was
intimidating. They invited me to come back several times and let him
get accustomed to the hospital. Within weeks he'd adapted."</TE>
<TE>   Every volunteer has a story about his pet's most moving
contribution to a patient's recovery. Henry was welcomed into the
room of a young man, a golden retriever owner himself, who had been
in a coma since being injured in a car accident. The young man's
father placed the boy's hand on Henry, and the patient opened his
eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Calvin, a 17-pound Cavalier King Charles spaniel, reports for duty
every other Friday with his owner, Gloria Litz. She says, "One day we
were doing our rounds, and I knocked on the door of a teenage boy who
was in pretty bad shape and asked if he'd like a visit. He didn't,
but I noticed that his mother had repeated my question in sign
language, so I told her that Calvin is deaf. She communicated that to
her son, and he changed his mind. His eyes lighted up and he said,
'Bring him in.' Calvin turned on the charm, and I could see the
effect it had on the boy."</TE>
<TE>   Prospective canine volunteers are screened by veterinarian John
Young, director of the department of comparative medicine at Cedars.
He examines the dogs and observes how they behave, with and without
their owners.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see if a dog is willing to focus on a person other than
its owner," he says. "We don't want one that would go into a room and
ignore a patient. We had a dog who was a gem with its owner, but he
growled at me. I'll take the dog for a walk, to expose them to all
the noise and activity they're likely to encounter--IV poles and
carts rolling by. I want to make sure they don't have separation
anxiety. We don't anticipate the dog and the owner being separated at
the hospital, but that's always a possibility. Dogs can't be trained
to be therapy dogs. They have those personalities or they don't."</TE>
<TE>   Every POOCH volunteer must be on a flea control program and be
bathed within 24 hours of coming to the hospital. Before the dogs get
their ID badges, two fecal analyses are done, and the process is
repeated every six months to make sure that they don't have bacteria
that could be infectious.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs visit the rehabilitation department, where stroke and
accident victims work to regain motor skills, the cardiac ICU and the
AIDS unit.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't go to infectious-disease wards," Young says, "and HIV
is species specific, and is a blood-born pathogen, so there's no risk
to the dog there. There is anecdotal evidence that pet therapy,
especially in rehab, is beneficial. When you touch a dog, you smile.
They don't demand anything, or judge you. No matter how infirm or
sick you are, they're content to lie by your side."</TE>

<LD>All in a Day's Work</LD>
<LD>   Two-hundred-and-fifty years ago in France, bathing was not
popular, but if you had clean clothes and clean sheets, it meant you
were clean, too. Many people sent their laundry to be cleaned by a
laundress or washerwoman, like the one shown in this painting by the
French artist Jean-Baptiste Greuze, who lived from 1725 to 1805.</LD>
<LD>   How did they do laundry in France in the 1700s? Well, it took a
lot longer than the washing machines and dryers we use today. First,
water, ashes, and a type of baking soda were boiled in a copper pot
to create a detergent. This mixture was poured into a tub filled with
clothes, not that different from the one in front of our washerwoman.
Then the tub was drained, and the process was repeated for eight
hours. The clothes were then soaked in clean, hot water for another 9
hours.</LD>
<TE>   After this process, the laundry was taken to the river, where it
would be scrubbed and beaten to remove dirt. The laundry was beaten
with a wooden pounding device called a beetle, like the one in the
lower left corner of the painting. As many as 500 laundresses
gathered on the banks of the Seine river in Paris on washing day. The
clean clothes were laid out to dry by the river or hung from windows
for three days. The last steps were folding and ironing. It's no
wonder wealthy people sent their clothes out to be washed!</TE>
<TE>   You can see more paintings and drawings by Greuze depicting scenes
of daily life in 18th century France in the Getty Museum exhibitions
"Greuze the Draftsman" and "Greuze the Painter," starting Wednesday,
through Dec. 1. The museum invites children 12 and younger to stop by
the Information Desk in the Museum Entrance Hall and receive a free
"The Laundress" postcard by Greuze. At 2 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays
you can also participate in "Art Adventures for Families,"
activity-filled gallery tours that children (ages 5 through 12) and
adults can enjoy together. Sign-ups begin at 1:30 p.m. at the
Information Desk in the Museum Entrance Hall.</TE>
<TE>   For more information or parking reservations, call (310) 440-7300
or visit www.getty.edu. Parking reservations are not needed Saturdays
and Sunday or after 4 p.m. weekdays.</TE>

<HD>Move Over, Guys--It's Their Turn to Fly</HD>
<DH>The All Girl Skate Jam is a rare chance for them to prove
they can shine in a male-dominated sport</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The conditions were perfect for skateboarding: A breeze was blowing,
the sun was shining and the Beastie Boys and Social Distortion were
blaring in the background.</LD>
<LD>   The 50 or so girls who rolled on to Huntington Beach Pier on
Sunday for the All Girl Skate Jam--the only all-female skateboard
competition in the world--were prepared to take full advantage of the
opportunity.</LD>
<LD>   With BMXers flying high on side of the skate course, and surfers
riding waves in the background, the young women pulled on their
kneepads and sticker-plastered helmets and took off through the
course.</LD>
<TE>   Her T-shirt streaked with dirt, Vanessa Torres, 14, rode a
well-worn skateboard up the ramp, balancing on its top edge before
careening down the other side. Hair flying, Lyn-Z Adams, 12,
performed an "air transfer," wheeling up one ramp and down another.
Alexandra White, 17, pink bandanna tied around her face, sped into a
"rail slide," gliding the belly of her skateboard along the top of a
rail before hopping down to the ground on four wheels and finishing
her run.</TE>
<TE>   Torres (who won the competition), Adams and White are some of the
world's top female skateboarders. They can grind axles and catch air
as well as almost any guy, but there are few opportunities for them
to show their stuff. Most competitions are male-only.</TE>
<TE>   The All Girl Skate Jam, in its sixth year, was founded by Patty
Segovia in 1997. "I put it together because if you tried to sign up
for a [boys'] contest, they'd shoo you away."</TE>
<TE>   Segovia, of Encinitas, who started skating 15 years ago, was also
"tired of going to skate parks and being the only girl."</TE>
<TE>   That is gradually changing: In 1996, 7.5% of frequent
skateboarders were female, according to the Sporting Goods
Manufacturers Assn. Today, of the 3.3 million Americans who
skateboard more than once a week, about 11% are female.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers may soon shift upward. Events such as the All Girl
Skate Jam are prompting the media to give girl skateboarders some
attention; skateboard manufacturers, clothing lines and stores are
beginning to cater to young women.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the extreme-sports extravaganza known as the X Games
included seven girls performing in an "expression session,"
demonstrating their skills. Although it was not televised on ESPN,
like the rest of the X Games sports, it was the first time female
skateboarders were included in the X Games' eight-year history.</TE>
<TE>   "We finally had a demand for it," said Melissa Gullotti, X Games
spokeswoman. "There were enough female athletes out there on the pro
level for skateboarding to warrant a demo, and we're hoping to see
that side of skateboarding grow."</TE>
<TE>   So do two girl-oriented skateboarding magazines launching this
fall. Canada-based Push magazine will publish its first issue in
November. San Clemente-based Surfing Girl magazine relaunches today
as SG, to cater to girls who like to surf and snowboard as well as
skateboard.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike boys' skateboarding magazines, such as Big Brother and
Skateboarding, which almost never profile female skaters, the new
magazines hope to serve as a means of inspiring and unifying the
female skateboarding community and to encourage more girls to get
involved.</TE>
<TE>   "Board sports give girls confidence and an amazing feeling of
independence," said Robyn Lass, the 28-year-old managing editor of
SG, which co-sponsored the All Girl Skate Jam. "It's so much
different than being involved with a team sport. When you're involved
in an individual sport, it's all up to you....You learn a new trick,
or you surf on a day that's bigger than you've ever surfed before,
and you're proud of your accomplishments. No one can take that away
from you."</TE>
<TE>   Full of Confidence</TE>
<TE>   As they flew over ramps, kick flipping their skateboards and
spinning around on two wheels, the girls at the All Girl Skate Jam
were nothing if not confident. They attacked the ramps at full speed.
If they fell or didn't get the trick the first time, they tried it
until they got it right.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Cruz, a 27-year-old skateboarder from Brea, was among those
in the crowd that ranged from male skateboard pros to soccer moms. "I
like that so many of the girl skaters go after it. They aren't what
you call feminine about it," said Cruz, who was competing as part of
the Core Tour.</TE>
<TE>   The All Girl Skate Jam was part of the Core Tour, a weekend-long
competition for skateboarders, surfers and BMX bikers, the latter of
which were running a course next to the skaters. The entire time the
girls were grinding it up on the course, the BMXers were in the
background, doing back flips and handlebar spins.</TE>
<TE>   Started at Age 2</TE>
<TE>   As distracting as it was for onlookers, it didn't affect
skateboarder Anna Gault, a 9-year-old from Huntington Beach, who, in
her pink sneakers and jeans, exhibited the confidence of someone
twice her age.</TE>
<TE>   Gault has been skating almost as long as she's been walking. She
picked up the sport when she was 2 years old. "I used to see other
boys skating, and I wanted to skate so bad," said Gault, who begged
her mother for a skateboard until she finally broke down and bought
one at a yard sale "that looked like a dog had chewed it up."</TE>
<TE>   Segovia, the Jam's founder, didn't start skateboarding until she
was 18, when a boyfriend got her into it. Her dad wouldn't let her do
it as a kid because he was afraid she'd get hurt. "I was forced to do
piano, jazz, tap and ballet," she said. "I used to cry on my way to
lessons."</TE>
<TE>   Cara-Beth Burnside of Encinitas, now the country's most successful
female pro skateboarder, also had to overcome the not-for-girls
stigma.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was 11 years old, people would tell me girls don't skate.
That just fueled my fire," said Burnside, now 33. An idol to many
young skaters, she was at the All Girl Skate Jam but did not compete.
"It needs to be out there so parents can actually see girls doing it
and be like, 'Oh, girls do do this.' "</TE>

<LD>"That's my puppy Nya," said Mrs. Collins as she ran around and around
the backyard, trying to catch the frisky Labrador.</LD>
<LD>   (That's no puppy, thought Kaci. That's a horse--or a tornado!)</LD>
<LD>   "I'll expect to see you here at 6 a.m. on Wednesday, Kaci. Here's
the key to the back gate. I'm sure you'll do a good job of taking
care of Nya."</LD>
<TE>   Kaci walked away from Mrs. Collins' house backward, she was so
shook up. (How will I ever feed that dog? She's so big she'll
probably try to eat me for dinner!)</TE>
<TE>   When Kaci stepped into the kitchen, her mother asked, "So did you
get a job, honey?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, Mom. Taking care of that grizzly bear that lives next
door."</TE>
<TE>   "That cute little puppy Nya?" asked Kaci's mom. "You're going to
love taking care of her. I'll tell you what. If you do a good job
taking care of Nya, maybe your dad and I will consider getting you a
pup."</TE>
<TE>   "You wait and see, Mom. It'll work out perfectly!"</TE>
<TE>   Kaci went to the library the next day to borrow all the books she
could about Labrador puppies. She quizzed her father on all the
things she should do to take care of a dog. When Kaci went to bed
that night she was smiling as she dreamed of seeing Nya the next day.
Too bad the first image she saw the next morning was her mother's
angry face. Her mom said, "Kaci, wake up! Mrs. Collins is on the
phone. She says you promised to be at her house at 6."</TE>

<HD>Vocational Schools Give Some an Edge</HD>
<DH>Trade education helps students fill a rising need for
skilled labor</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAULINE M. MILLARD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Amanda Wilson says that a lot of people tried to talk her out of
enrolling in a vocational school two years ago. At her old high
school in Hamilton, Ohio, she earned a 4.0 grade-point average.</LD>
<LD>   She was told that a bright student such as herself should stay on
the academic course--and continue to excel.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone said to me, 'Why are you going to do that? You're doing
so well here,' " she says. "But I knew that I wanted to work in the
medical field, and I wanted to get a head start."</LD>
<TE>   Wilson is now 17 and a senior at the D. Russell Lee
Career-Technology Center, where she is earning college credits in the
Allied Health program, a program that trains students for health
technology careers. She hopes to one day be a respiratory therapist.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson is one of many students who realized early on that
vocational and technical education doesn't necessarily translate into
learning a lowly skill that puts them on a dead-end course. And
schools that offer vocational and technical classes are not a dumping
ground for kids who don't succeed in traditional classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Votech education nowadays involves racking up technical skills
alongside academic credits, which can put students ahead of the game
in the job market.</TE>
<TE>   "If anyone thinks that we're not doing any work over here, I think
that's just nonsense," says Louis Sanchez, 17, and also a senior at
D. Russell Lee. "In fact, I think you have to be a little bit smarter
to do some of this stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez was sold on the school after hearing about a friend who
went through the program and after finishing his training was making
a good living as an auto mechanic. Sanchez, who admits he has a soft
spot for Ferraris, hopes to fix them.</TE>
<TE>   The need for skilled labor has grown, especially since more
students are opting to go to four-year colleges than ever before.
Companies who rely on a well-trained manual labor force are trying to
get the word out to students who might be looking for an alternative
career that doesn't occur behind a desk.</TE>
<TE>   Mack Trucks launched a campaign that brings company
representatives to high schools to explain what sorts of jobs are
available in the general trucking industry.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Kelly, vice president of marketing for Mack, says these trips
are not to recruit future truck drivers but to show students that the
automotive industry is highly technical and not always about turning
a wrench.</TE>
<TE>   He uses the example of the new variable geometry turbo charger, a
part of an engine that has been developed to take the bad exhaust
from trucks and have it consumed again by the engine. These engines
hope to make air cleaner by reducing emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Simply designing an engine like this takes knowledge of both
mechanics and physics, Kelly says. Using one takes a sharp eye for
electronics.</TE>
<TE>   "A highly skilled mechanic can become something like a highly paid
baseball player," Kelly says. "These guys get hired from company to
company."</TE>
<TE>   "People can knock trade schools all they want but when they're
going 75 miles an hour down the highway they better hope that whoever
fixed their brakes had a good technical education," says Dave
Treasure, the head of the Trade and Industrials Program at Idaho
State College in Pocatello, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   Succeeding in a technical field may be innate for some people; the
key is matching skill with individuals' interests. The average
starting salary for graduates of Treasure's program was about $21.33
an hour--more than many entry-level jobs for college graduates.
Treasure says some of his students earned as much as $45 an hour, and
Kelly of Mack Trucks reports that someone with specific knowledge of
auto mechanics can start out earning as much as $50,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone talks nowadays about the super-high tech, the IPOs and
making money," Kelly says, "but people don't realize that there is a
need for 'steady Eddies,' the guys that make the world work on a
day-to-day basis."</TE>

<HD>Forecasts for AOL Revised Down on Ad Sales Slump</HD>
<DH>Internet: The unit's revenue and EBITDA outlooks are
reduced, but its parent's projected revenue and cash flow remain the
same.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc. warned Monday that the outlook for its America
Online unit is bleaker than it appeared just two months ago, blaming
a lingering Internet advertising slump that continues to erode
revenue.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based media giant stressed that the parent company's
overall projected revenue and cash-flow figures for 2002 have not
changed.</LD>
<LD>   But it said the Dulles, Va.-based Internet unit would earn less
than it estimated in July.</LD>
<TE>   "There's been a continued softness in the advertising business,"
AOL Time Warner spokesman Scott Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner, whose stock price is down about 70% this year,
said it expects the Internet unit to report 2002 advertising and
commerce revenue of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion and cash earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of
$1.7 billion to $1.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, the company said it expected America Online's
ad/commerce revenue and EBITDA to be between $1.8 billion and $2.2
billion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never good when you have to lower your guidance two months
after you set your guidance," said Paul Kim, analyst at Kaufman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   But Wall Street investors, who already have beaten down the stock
after a string of bad news this summer, did not appear alarmed by the
latest revision.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner's stock closed Monday at $13.33, up 20 cents, in
New York Stock Exchange trading.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the changes were no surprise, given the Internet
unit's recent lackluster performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Expectations for the AOL segment were already low and little
value was being allocated to the AOL business," Merrill Lynch analyst
Jessica Reif Cohen said in a research note Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The firm kept its "neutral" rating on AOL Time Warner's stock,
which remains clouded by Justice Department and Securities and
Exchange Commission probes into its accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   America Online admitted last month that it might have improperly
accounted for three ad deals totaling $49 million. The company is
conducting an internal review and has adopted a more conservative
approach to accounting and advertising deals.</TE>
<TE>   "The deals they struck in the dot-com heyday have been rolling off
for the past year and will continue to roll off for another three or
four quarters," Kim said. He said the downward revision may reflect
no new ad deals being struck to replace the old ones.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Miller, the new chief executive of America Online, is
expected to announce a restructuring this week that would disband the
once-highflying business-affairs unit, which pushed for many of the
ad deals under review.</TE>
<TE>   Advertising and commerce revenue accounts for about 30% of the
Internet unit's total revenue, while Internet subscriptions account
for about two-thirds.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the parent company said they continue to see strong
operating earnings at AOL Time Warner's other units.</TE>
<TE>   They said other businesses would offset the declines at the online
service, which accounts for about 23% of the parent company's
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner expects 2002 revenue to increase at the low end of
a 5% to 9% range, while EBITDA should grow 5% to 8%.</TE>

<HD>Halt of Asbestos Trial Sought</HD>
<DH>Courts: Defendant companies ask Supreme Court to postpone
West Virginia case, contesting massive format that involves as many
as 8,000 plaintiffs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a last-ditch effort to avoid a massive and costly legal battle,
companies defending against asbestos claims asked the U.S. Supreme
Court on Monday to halt a consolidated trial involving as many as
8,000 plaintiffs and 250 defendant companies before it begins.</LD>
<LD>   Jury selection is set to begin in a Charleston, W.Va., courtroom
on Sept. 23 if the Supreme Court does not step into the giant
collection of liability claims that one judge described as the
"asbestos Gettysburg." Defendants have exhausted their appeals in
West Virginia and acknowledged that the Supreme Court bid is a last
resort.</LD>
<LD>   West Virginia's highest court has given a green light to the
consolidation of thousands of allegations that asbestos in products
such as automotive brakes manufactured or used by the defendants have
left the plaintiffs with injuries ranging from breathing difficulties
to incurable cancer.</LD>
<TE>   The stakes are huge. With thousands of injury claims filed against
hundreds of companies each year at a pace that is accelerating,
asbestos litigation has bankrupted more than 50 companies, and
experts believe that if the West Virginia trial goes forward, it will
encourage more lawyers to seek more claims from people who have
little or no disability. Advocates of legislative reform, such as the
creation of medical standards for filing claims, are hopeful that
Congress will take up their proposals in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   "This is Exhibit A," said Steve Kazan, an Oakland-based lawyer
whose firm represents only seriously ill asbestos victims and who
filed a brief in support of the West Virginia defendants' request for
Supreme Court review.</TE>
<TE>   Kazan said the trial plan is less a blueprint for efficient
justice than it is a settlement shakedown. "The idea is you raise the
stakes so high that for any defendant to go to trial it becomes
bet-the-company litigation," he said. "This is another effort to
drain large sums of money from companies, which will reduce the
assets that are available to people who are really sick."</TE>
<TE>   The recent surge in asbestos claims from plaintiffs who are not
ill has alarmed those representing the truly sick, who worry that new
claims will siphon money from those who most need it. This has put
some plaintiffs in the odd position of supporting the defendant
companies' efforts to limit claims.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the variance in asbestos settlements and verdicts,
estimates on the total value of the West Virginia claims are hard to
make. During the last two years, one jury awarded a dying cancer
victim $55 million and another jury gave $150 million to six laborers
who were not sick but merely exposed to asbestos.</TE>
<TE>   At least 575,000 asbestos claims have been filed since the early
1980s. Experts believe the total economic toll of asbestos litigation
could run at least as high as $200 billion--more than Hurricane
Andrew, all Superfund sites combined or the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The companies, represented in court filings by Mobil Corp. and
Honeywell International Inc., earlier asked the nation's high court
to strike down the trial plan because they fear a hearing of such
magnitude would make it impossible for any single defendant to get a
fair trial, that jurors would be hard-pressed to keep evidence
against one firm from damning the conduct of an unrelated company.</TE>
<TE>   In the motion filed Monday, the companies asked the Supreme Court
to prevent the trial from going forward until it decides if it will
take up their objections to it.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not customary to ask the United States Supreme Court's
intervention before a trial is held, but this is an extraordinary
situation," said Walter E. Dellinger III, the lawyer who filed the
request for the defendant companies. "It is literally unprecedented
to have a mass trial of this magnitude against this many defendants."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Schwartz, a Charleston, W.Va., lawyer representing 900
plaintiffs, said that by trying to force individuals into separate
trials, the companies are making it harder for plaintiffs to achieve
justice. "It would be more costly and it would delay it to the point
where some people just wouldn't live long enough to have their day in
court."</TE>
<TE>   Only half the trial is to be consolidated. That first,
consolidated phase would decide the liability of each defendant
company. Companies found to be liable would then face a second phase
of litigation to determine which plaintiffs, if any, were exposed to
their products and how much each is owed.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz said he has settled cases with several defendants and is
in settlement talks with others now. He said he would be surprised,
if the trial goes forward, to see all 250 companies still prepared to
litigate.</TE>
<TE>   Consolidating similar lawsuits in asbestos and other types of
litigation is not a new idea for courts that are struggling with
backlogs and limited resources. One mass asbestos trial in Indiana
was held in a gymnasium. But the West Virginia asbestos trial plan is
of another order--too large and too diverse to make fairness
possible, said Dellinger, the lawyer representing the defendants.</TE>
<TE>   "This mass trial plan does not inhabit the same universe as the
due process clause of the United States Constitution," he said. "To
have this trial go forward would irreparably compromise the rights
not only of the defendant corporations but also the seriously
impaired claimants with mesothelioma and related lung cancers who
will have no fair day in court if the mass trial proceeds."</TE>
<TE>   In a supporting brief filed with the Supreme Court, lawyers for
the Coalition for Asbestos Justice, a Washington-based
business-backed advocacy group, said the mass trial could set a
dangerous precedent for other jurisdictions swamped with thousands of
asbestos lawsuits and looking for efficient alternatives to costly
and lengthy individual trials. If more courts set up such mechanisms
to adjudicate claims, the more people with minor or no injuries will
file suits to collect damages, they argue.</TE>

<HD>A Cliffhanger Above Playa Vista Project</HD>
<DH>Real estate: A parcel overlooking the Ballona Wetlands is
the focus of a long legal standoff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though many are familiar with the struggle over the giant Playa Vista
project, relatively few are aware that the bluffs above the
development are the focus of an equally contentious real estate saga
that has involved many of the same players.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco-based Catellus Development Corp., one of
California's largest real estate firms, and previous landowners have
tried for more than a decade to develop what they consider one of the
Los Angeles area's prime residential sites, a 32-acre parcel in
Westchester called West Bluffs.</LD>
<LD>   The 114 home lots--many with striking city and ocean
views--planned for the property each could fetch $400,000 or more if
Catellus had been able to build the necessary streets, utility
hookups and other improvements. Instead, the developer is locked in a
legal standoff with environmentalists and nearby homeowners who want
the land preserved as open space.</LD>
<TE>   "If you can build houses there, you are going to hit a home run,"
land broker Chris Atkins said. But litigation "could stop you for two
months to 10 years. That could wipe out a small developer or hurt the
bottom line of a big developer."</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of environmentalists and residents, many of whom have
battled Playa Vista, has delayed the project by challenging in court
previous approvals granted by the city of Los Angeles and the
California Coastal Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Catellus has won most of the lawsuits, but opponents, which
include the Spirit of the Sage Council and the Coalition of Concerned
Communities, have filed for appeals and court orders that continue to
block work. Attorneys for the groups said they plan to file another
appeal today that effectively would extend a court order blocking
construction on portions of the bluffs that fall under the
jurisdiction of the Coastal Commission.</TE>
<TE>   West Bluffs, which sits about 100 feet above the Ballona Wetlands
where Lincoln Boulevard climbs up into Westchester, once shared a
common owner with Playa Vista: Howard Hughes Realty Co.</TE>
<TE>   The real estate arm of Howard Hughes' business empire spent many
years planning and winning government approvals to build a
residential development atop the bluffs before it sold the property
to Catellus in December 1997. (Howard Hughes Realty also sold off its
interest in Playa Vista.)</TE>
<TE>   With Hughes having secured most of the necessary government
approvals, Catellus executives said they had planned initially on
selling homes by the middle of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It was entitled and it was being approved, and there was a
reasonable expectation that we could accomplish a difficult process,"
said Bill Dennis, senior vice president of Catellus Commercial Group,
a division of Catellus Development. "But here we are. We are
basically dealing with the exact same group of environmentalists and
obstructionists that Playa Vista has dealt with for years."</TE>
<TE>   But what developers consider valuable and scarce residential real
estate, environmentalists view as one of the last remaining bits of a
complex coastal ecosystem. The north-facing bluffs complement the
wetlands below by providing the birds, insects and other animals from
the coastal lowlands a dry place for nesting, said Kathy Knight,
wetlands coordinator for the Spirit of the Sage Council, an
environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the only bluff left in a natural state that supports the
Ballona Wetlands," Knight said. "We want to use it as an educational
area for students to learn how to restore that particular ecosystem."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to waging a legal battle, Knight and other
environmentalists have offered to buy the property from Catellus if
they can raise the necessary funds from public and private sources.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope that Catellus can work with us so we can come up with
a win-win situation to save this last bluff," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Catellus is "not philosophically opposed" to selling the property
for open space, but there is no evidence that environmentalists can
raise the tens of millions of dollars necessary to acquire the land
any time soon, Dennis said.</TE>
<TE>   "The key to getting our attention is to have a very thoughtful
plan backed by a demonstration of committed funds," Dennis said.
"Those two things we have not yet seen. We are not going to stop the
project waiting around for something to happen."</TE>

<HD>FDA Wants Allergan to Pull Botox Ads and Brochures</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: The firm says it won't comply, maintaining
it has worked diligently to be accurate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Food and Drug Administration has demanded that Allergan Inc.
"immediately cease distribution" of television advertisements and
patient brochures for Botox Cosmetic, charging that they violate
federal law and contain information that is misleading to consumers.</LD>
<LD>   The notice-of-violation letter sent to Irvine-based Allergan was
one step short of an FDA warning letter and gives the company 10 days
to provide a written response. A warning letter, in which the agency
outlines enforcement action that would be taken by the Justice
Department, might come next if Allergan refuses to comply.</LD>
<LD>   Among other things, the FDA said Allergan's patient brochure was
misleading about everything from how long the Botox injection
procedure lasts (usually four months) to which specific wrinkle it
had been approved for. The FDA also said the Allergan Web site for
physicians was confusing with regard to how much the Botox solution
should be diluted.</LD>
<TE>   The FDA said most companies comply with such notices, but Allergan
responded angrily Monday, saying it would not pull the advertisements
or the brochure and that it was disappointed and frustrated by the
FDA letter.</TE>
<TE>   "We strongly disagree on all points," said Allergan spokeswoman
Christine Cassiano, adding that the company "worked diligently" with
the agency to produce accurate materials about Botox Cosmetic, the
nation's most widely used cosmetic procedure. Cassiano said that
there have been several conversations and correspondence between the
company and the FDA and that the agency never indicated there was a
problem.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA has responsibility for policing ads for drugs and for
biological products such as botulinum toxin type A, as Botox is
formally known; it was approved by the FDA this year for use on a
specific wrinkle that develops between the eyebrows and the forehead.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Malarkey, director of case management for the FDA's Center
for Biologics Evaluation and Research and author of the letter,
maintained that Allergan was in violation of federal standards.</TE>
<TE>   But several doctors interviewed Monday were hard-pressed to
understand the FDA's concerns and said they generally found
Allergan's information accurate.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they were more careful than most" companies that
advertise, said Dr. Nina Patel, who runs a cosmetic, laser and
surgical clinic in Marina del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Richard Glogau, a clinical professor of dermatology at UC San
Francisco who worked on the FDA study of the procedure and is a paid
consultant for Allergan, said doctors were not concerned about the
advertisements, only about unqualified physicians trying to perform
the procedure.</TE>
<TE>   "The ads and the brochures are not misleading," said Dr. Stuart
Kaplan, a Beverly Hills dermatologist who has given botox injections
to patients for several years. "They weren't ever supposed to take
the place of a doctor's advice."</TE>
<TE>   Allergan shares fell 65 cents to $56.44 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Immune Response Corp. said that Dennis Carlo resigned as chief
executive, and the company, which has struggled to develop an HIV
treatment, is cutting more than half the staff at its headquarters in
Carlsbad, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   Immune Response said it promoted its vice president for medical
and scientific affairs, Ronald Moss, to president and is seeking a
chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   Carlo will remain on the board of the company, which was
co-founded by the late Jonas Salk, developer of the polio vaccine.</LD>
<TE>   Immune Response also will cut 28 of the 42 jobs at its Carlsbad
headquarters. The company may add as many as five employees at its
King of Prussia, Pa., site to make more Remune, an experimental
vaccine that's intended to help the body's own immune system better
fight HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Immune Response shares, which have fallen 57% this year, fell 1
cent to 56 cents on Nasdaq.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Genentech Inc. said that an experimental cancer drug failed to extend
the lives of breast cancer patients in a large clinical trial, a
setback for the South San Francisco-based biotechnology company.</LD>
<LD>   In a news release issued after the markets closed, Genentech said
that Avastin slowed the growth of tumors in a trial of 462 women, but
that benefit did not translate into increased survival, the gold
standard for government approval.</LD>
<LD>   The results raise questions about the market potential of Avastin,
which Genentech is continuing to test in colon cancer. Analysts had
expected the drug to launch in 2004 and fuel Genentech's growth, with
sales as high as $1 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Avastin is an antibody that restricts growth of blood vessels that
feed tumors. It works by blocking a protein that causes vessels to
proliferate.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech did not release details of the breast cancer study,
which the company said would be released at a medical conference in
December. Genentech closed at $32, up 30 cents, on the New York Stock
Exchange before the news was announced.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WellPoint Health Networks Inc.'s $1.3-billion offer to acquire
nonprofit insurer CareFirst Inc. is less than the company is worth,
according to a report requested by Maryland regulators.</LD>
<LD>   CareFirst's fair value ranges from $1.38 billion to $2.25 billion,
a report prepared by the investment firm Blackstone Group said,
citing the insurer's dominance in its markets and its profitability,
among other factors.</LD>
<LD>   WellPoint spokesman Ken Ferber disputed the numbers, saying the
report doesn't compare "apples to apples" because it treats CareFirst
as a publicly traded company and doesn't include taxes WellPoint
would pay on CareFirst members' premiums, which would bring the total
valuation to $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Thousand Oaks-based WellPoint rose $1.50 to $75.94 on

<LD>The California Endowment, one of the nation's largest health-care
foundations, said it will build a headquarters complex and conference
center adjacent to the historic Terminal Annex in downtown Los
Angeles on a 6.5-acre parcel it purchased for $11.3 million.</LD>
<LD>   An official for the organization said a design and size of the
facility on Alameda Street have yet to be determined but that it will
house 150 employees now located in Woodland Hills, where the
foundation is headquartered, and an existing office in downtown Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The complex, located immediately northwest of the former postal
facility, is scheduled to break ground late next year and be
completed in 2006.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles-based real estate firm Urban Partners will act as
the development manager for the project.</TE>
<TE>   The endowment originally planned on building its headquarters
across the street near Union Station but the location was not large
enough to accommodate the organization's needs, an endowment official
said.</TE>

<HD>Mortgage Delinquency Rate Reaches a 30-Year High</HD>
<DH>Lending: Industry experts attribute trend to upsurge in
layoffs and rising housing prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The percentage of homeowners who fell behind on their mortgage
payments in the second quarter surged to the highest level in at
least 30 years, as more Americans lost their jobs and home prices
continued to rise sharply, a mortgage banking group said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts were puzzled by the jump in foreclosures, which typically
are lower when the housing market is strong. The surge could signal
that an increasing number of buyers have paid more than they can
afford amid today's record-high home prices, they said. Also, the
misuse of home equity loans and the increase of zero-money-down loan
programs may have contributed to the increase in defaults, economists
say.</LD>
<LD>   From April through June, the percentage of loans on which
foreclosures were started rose to 0.40%, up from 0.37% the previous
quarter, according to Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America figures. That
is the highest level since the organization started tracking mortgage
defaults in 1972.</LD>
<TE>   Mortgages already in the foreclosure process stood at 1.23% in the
second quarter, up from 0.91% a year earlier, also a record.</TE>
<TE>   Rising unemployment has made it more difficult for some homeowners
to meet their mortgage payments, fueling the increase in the
foreclosure rate, said Doug Duncan, chief economist for the
association. Unemployment averaged 5.9% in the second quarter, up
from 4.5% a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The recent home price surge has in some cases made it more
difficult to sell when an owner needs to get out, because there are
fewer buyers who can afford them. In California, the median price of
a single-family home in July was $323,700, up 21% from $267,520 a
year ago, according to the California Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, when home prices are high, as they are now, troubled
homeowners are able to sell their houses and avoid foreclosures, said
John Lonski, chief economist with Moody's Investors Service.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm puzzled that we have record-breaking foreclosures amid such a
brisk pace of home sales," Lonski said. "Perhaps this is a warning
that delinquencies and foreclosures will be higher in the months
ahead."</TE>
<TE>   The home mortgage delinquency rate--the percentage of loans with
payments overdue at least 30 days--rose to 4.77%, up from 4.64% a
year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Another possible reason for the rising foreclosure rate, mortgage
experts say, is the misuse of home-equity loans. Some lenders allow
homeowners to borrow more than the value of their home, and the
borrowers then use the funds to finance other expenditures, going
deeper into debt.</TE>
<TE>   Also, a growing number of home buyers are taking out loans that
don't require a down payment. When faced with a financial setback,
such as the loss of a job, they are unable to tap into the home's
equity to refinance and lower their monthly payments.</TE>
<TE>   "There are cases where it takes more to rent, with first and last
months' rent and a security deposit, than to buy a new home," said
Dan Weiss, a mortgage broker at Golden State Lending Services.</TE>
<TE>   If delinquencies continue to rise, as expected, it could trigger
more foreclosures, and lenders may be forced to tighten credit and
raise mortgage rates to help cover risks.</TE>
<TE>   "I would expect a slight increase in delinquencies next quarter
because unemployment numbers have not improved to the extent we
thought," Duncan said. "This was unexpected; we're trying to figure
it out."</TE>

<HD>Antitrust Officials Target Insurers</HD>
<DH>Health: Regulators say they are paying closer attention to
merger plans amid concerns about competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. antitrust regulators are stepping up scrutiny of health
insurers, concerned that competition in the industry may have been
crimped by a recent wave of mergers, a Justice Department official
said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Health insurance companies have become an "area of primary
concern" to the department's antitrust division, said Deputy
Assistant Atty. Gen. Deborah Majoras, who made her comments at the
Federal Trade Commission antitrust conference.</LD>
<LD>   "For consumers to benefit from competition in health-care markets,
sufficient competition must be maintained not only among providers
but also among the health plans that purchase the providers' services
on behalf of their plan members," she said.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, antitrust officials will pay close attention to any
new mergers among health insurers.</TE>
<TE>   Majoras said regulators recently had investigated possible
collusion among health insurers in one major U.S. city but declined
to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   In another example, she said officials have looked into complaints
from doctors in Philadelphia who had questioned a clause in their
contract that gave providers more favorable reimbursement rates if
the doctors agreed to participate in all of the insurer's plan
offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the health insurance industry at the conference
said they were not concerned by the Justice Department's scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not aware of any anti-competitive activities at all," said
Stephanie Kanwit, general counsel for the American Assn. of Health
Plans.</TE>
<TE>   Kanwit described the Justice Department's oversight as "business
as usual" and said increasing consolidation among doctor groups,
rather than health insurers, had pushed up the cost of health care.</TE>
<TE>   But Majoras said the increasing focus on health insurers has been
triggered by the spate of mergers that have reduced the number of
competitors in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   From 1995 to 2000, there were more than 350 mergers involving
health insurers or managed-care groups, American Medical Assn.
President Donald Palmisano told the same conference.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 largest national insurance companies, including WellPoint
Health Networks Inc. and Aetna Inc., cover more than half of all
people who are insured in the United States, Palmisano said.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC and Justice Department share responsibility for antitrust
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Last month the FTC settled charges against eight groups of
Denver-area doctors, whom the commission accused of fixing fees to
raise the cost of their services.</TE>
<TE>   The doctors' biggest trade group, the AMA, responded Monday by
calling on the FTC to "redirect its efforts in health-care antitrust
enforcement, to focus on HMOs and health plans, not just physicians."</TE>

<HD>Intel Reveals Details of a Chip for Laptops</HD>
<DH>Technology: The firm looks beyond sluggish desktop market
and bets on Banias.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Seeking to stay relevant in a world of evolving technology, Intel
Corp. on Monday revealed new details of a chip it will introduce next
year designed just for laptops, the only bright spot in an otherwise
grim computer market.</LD>
<LD>   Called Banias, the chip is more than just a new product. For
Intel, Banias is a costly stab at keeping up with a new era of
computing, one in which consumers will be less reliant on their
desktops, Intel's traditional stronghold. Instead, Intel envisions
consumers using a panoply of devices designed to be always on,
portable and wireless.</LD>
<LD>   With PC sales expected to grow a mere 1.8% this year, Intel is
experimenting with a variety of chips to power a range of products,
from cell phones and servers to ultralight notebook computers and
complex networking equipment. The laptop market is expected to grow
11% this year, according to estimates from IDC, a technology research
firm.</LD>
<TE>   Developed in Israel, Banias focuses less on raw megahertz and more
on features that matter to laptop users such as built-in wireless
Internet access capabilities and lower power consumption to extend
battery life.</TE>
<TE>   "The holy grail of computing is being able to run your notebook
all day on a single battery charge," said Mike Feibus, principal
analyst with Tech Knowledge Strategies. "We're moving a lot closer to
that ideal with Banias."</TE>
<TE>   Banias, due out in the first three months of 2003, is expected to
boost battery life by at least an hour, said Anand Chandrasekher,
Intel's vice president of mobile chips. The microprocessor moderates
the power it consumes by shutting down parts of the chip that aren't
being used. The technique, called aggressive clock gating, is similar
to turning off the lights in unoccupied rooms.</TE>
<TE>   It also bundles commonly used instructions to aid faster
processing. In addition, Banias is expected to make more efficient
predictions of what calculations will be required, said Peter
Glaskowsky, editor of Microprocessor Report.</TE>
<TE>   "To boost performance, the Pentium 4 does work before it needs to,
based on speculation," Glaskowsky said. "If it's right, it boosts
your speed. But if it's wrong, it has to throw that work away. The
more work you throw away, the more battery life you waste."</TE>
<TE>   For Intel, which supplies the semiconductors that power more than
90% of the world's laptops, Banias is a response to efforts by rival
Transmeta Corp. to deliver low-heat chips that prolong battery life.
Intel's initial reaction was to introduce in 2001 the "speed-step"
feature to its chips, which operate at a lower clock rate when the
laptop is unplugged to save energy.</TE>
<TE>   The most significant difference is the fact that Banias will be
manufactured using a new process that shrinks the size of the chip's
circuit to 90 nanometers, roughly one-third smaller than Intel's
current chips. In general, the smaller the chip, the less energy it
uses.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, Intel reconfigured desktop chips for laptops. But that
posed problems. Desktop chips are powerful, but they burn through
batteries. Desktop chips also heat up fast and require fans and heat
sinks to keep them from overheating, which adds bulk and weight.</TE>
<TE>   Banias probably will debut at speeds far lower than its Pentium
siblings for laptops. For Intel, which has dominated the PC market by
relentlessly increasing the speed of its semiconductors, Banias will
be a marketing shift.</TE>
<TE>   Intel's president, Paul Otellini, said the company will trumpet
"all of its features," from battery life and speed to its integrated
wireless capabilities via a standard called 802.11, being rolled out
at airports, hotels and coffee shops.</TE>
<TE>   "Intel is building a wireless future where we carry communicators
to check e-mail everywhere--at home, at the gas station, at the
Starbucks," Feibus said. "Wireless communication will do for the
computer what cellular did for phones."</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Intel announced plans to integrate security features
into its microprocessors.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel fell 14 cents to $16.08
on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>File-Sharing Networks Relying on VCR Ruling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As entertainment companies struggle in court to defend their music
and movies against a new generation of digital pirates, one of their
biggest challenges is an 18-year-old Supreme Court ruling on a
defunct technology.</LD>
<LD>   The major record companies and Hollywood studios have sued a
series of online file-sharing companies, accusing them of fueling
rampant piracy of songs and videos on the Internet. In response, the
file-sharing networks have relied on the Supreme Court's 1984 ruling
in the Sony Betamax case, which held that Sony Corp. wasn't liable
for copyright infringement because its videocassette recorders had
"substantial" legitimate uses as well as illegal ones.</LD>
<LD>   Two file-sharing networks--Napster Inc. and Aimster (later renamed
Madster)--sought refuge in the Betamax case with no great success.
Now, three popular successors--Morpheus, Kazaa and Grokster--are
relying on Betamax in a critical pretrial skirmish.</LD>
<TE>   If the file-sharing companies win, the music and movie companies
would be forced to turn their legal guns directly onto consumers who
make pirate copies. That's a step the entertainment industry has been
loath to take because it's expensive and might alienate customers.
But if the file-sharing companies lose, some advocates say, the
shrinking scope of the Betamax ruling could put a damper on new
technology.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Betamax doctrine is eroded, you end up in a situation
where innovation generally suffers, and you're limited to whatever
technology Hollywood thinks we deserve," said Fred von Lohmann of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is helping to defend Morpheus.
"It's just an untenable situation if in fact copyright law makes it
impossible for innovators to do what they do."</TE>
<TE>   Matthew J. Oppenheim, senior vice president of business and legal
affairs at the Recording Industry Assn. of America, agreed that the
file-sharing cases are refining the scope of Betamax. But as the
judge in the Madster case ruled, there's a fundamental difference
between a VCR that works in a consumer's home and an online network
that distributes files around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing in the Sony decision that says it extends to
distribution," Oppenheim said.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit against Morpheus, Kazaa and Grokster is being heard by
U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles. Lawyers for the
entertainment companies, Morpheus and Grokster filed briefs Monday
urging Wilson to decide the case without a trial, but no ruling is
expected for several months.</TE>
<TE>   Napster and Madster went into bankruptcy before the copyright
infringement lawsuits against them were decided. Still, the record
companies and music publishers won pretrial injunctions against both
companies, and those rulings could prove influential in the Morpheus
case.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which
considered the injunction against Napster, and U.S. District Judge
Marvin E. Aspen, who heard the case against Madster, declared that
consumers don't have the right to copy music from strangers over the
Internet, even when no money changes hands.</TE>
<TE>   Based on that reasoning, copyright lawyers say, an online
file-sharing company could be liable for "contributory" infringement
if it knew of the copying but still assisted it, or "vicarious"
infringement if it benefited financially from the copying and could
have stopped it.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit held that Napster couldn't be held liable simply
because its technology enabled people to pirate music, but it also
ruled that the company wasn't protected by Betamax because it knew
what its users were doing.</TE>
<TE>   The record companies and music publishers alerted Napster to more
than 12,000 infringing song files available on its network, and the
company failed to purge those files from its system, the court held.</TE>
<TE>   The main difference between Napster and the three file-sharing
networks now being sued is that Napster kept central directories of
the files on users' computers. Like most of the file-sharing
companies that emerged in Napster's wake, Morpheus, Kazaa and
Grokster don't have central directories. And as a consequence, their
lawyers say, they have no way to monitor or control what their users
do.</TE>
<TE>   The courts are trying to determine how much a file-sharing company
must know about and participate in its users' piracy to be held
liable, said attorney Neil J. Rosini, a copyright expert at Franklin
Weinrib Rudell &amp; Vassallo in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Grokster and the like take the position that 'It's not us. We're
just dumb pipes through which other people act.' And copyright owners
are attempting to take the position that they're more than dumb
pipes, that they're encouraging members to infringe ... and they're
doing that for the purpose of making money," Rosini said.</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling against Madster, Aspen held that the Betamax
decision wouldn't apply unless Madster demonstrated that its primary
use was legitimate. But the 9th Circuit appears to disagree, saying
the issue is simply whether a file-sharing network is capable of
substantial legitimate uses.</TE>
<TE>   That means the courts must weigh not only the current uses of a
network but also the potential future benefits of the technology,
said Charles S. Baker, an attorney for StreamCast Networks Inc., the
company that distributes Morpheus' software.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Page, an attorney for Grokster, agreed, saying one of the
issues is "how significant do [the legitimate uses] have to be."</TE>
<TE>   Said Von Lohmann of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, "The
Supreme Court got the answer right in the Betamax case. You don't
measure [the amount of legitimate use] at all. So long as it is
capable of a legitimate use, you let it go."</TE>
<TE>   With this thinking in mind, the companies behind Morpheus, Kazaa
and Grokster have tried to encourage copyright owners to use
file-sharing as a legitimate promotional or distribution tool.
Examples include offering independent musicians and game developers
tools to disperse sample songs or copy-protected versions of games.</TE>
<TE>   Oppenheim of the RIAA said the rulings in the Napster and Madster
cases make clear why Betamax doesn't apply to file-sharing networks,
even if the decisions don't necessarily bind Wilson in the Morpheus,
Kazaa and Grokster case. For example, he said, Aspen held that the
Betamax ruling applies only to discrete products, such as a VCR, that
are used by customers as they see fit, and Madster doesn't fit that
definition.</TE>
<TE>   Aspen also pointed out the many ways Madster knew or should have
known about the piracy enabled by its software. Although some of his
arguments applied only to Madster, others also could apply to
Morpheus, Kazaa and Grokster.</TE>
<TE>   In a joint brief filed Monday, the major record companies, music
publishers and movie studios argued that the three file-sharing
companies are well aware of the piracy on their networks, and that
they could prevent it. They also argue that unlike Sony, the
companies do more than just distribute a product--they also actively
sustain the file-sharing networks.</TE>
<TE>   To Rosini, it's just too great a stretch to think the Betamax
decision extends to online file-sharing networks that consumers use
to copy billions of songs, videos and other files from one another's
computers free.</TE>
<TE>   "The Supreme Court in deciding the Sony case couldn't have
intended to permit a massive system of infringement to be called
exempt from the copyright law," Rosini said.</TE>
<TE>   "It just defies reason to think otherwise."</TE>

<HD>Late Rally Lifts Stocks Despite Investors' Jitters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks recovered from early selling Monday to post modest gains. But
continued light trading volume suggested that investors remain
skittish amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty and concerns
about the upcoming first anniversary of the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.18 points, or 1.1%, to
8,519.38 after falling almost 112 points in early trading. Broader
indicators also closed higher. The Nasdaq composite index rose 9.30
points, or 0.7%, to 1,304.60. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was up
9.04 points, or 1%, at 902.96.</LD>
<LD>   The rally added to Friday's gains and marked the first
back-to-back advances for the major indexes in more than two weeks.
But the overall market was mixed: Almost four stocks rose for every
three that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, but losers edged
winners on Nasdaq.</LD>
<TE>   Trading volume was light, continuing the trend of recent weeks and
leading analysts to question whether Monday's rise was an indication
of renewed market strength. Investors, they said, remain wary about
Wednesday's anniversary of the terror attacks as well as a possible
war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "People are jittery in front of the anniversary, worrying
something may be brewing," said Todd Clark, head of listed equity
trading at Wells Fargo Securities. "Then there's the saber rattling
over Iraq. That keeps buyers away from the market."</TE>
<TE>   One sign of the jitters: Shares of gold mining firms rose as gold
prices soared to seven-week highs. The safe-haven asset gained $1.40
to $321.30 an ounce in New York, its highest price since July 22.</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia Stock Exchange index of 11 gold and silver stocks
rose 4% on gains by firms such as AngloGold, up $1.89 at $27.09, and
Harmony Gold, up $1.35 at $17.66.</TE>
<TE>   Defense stocks also rallied, paced by Alliant Techsystems, up
$2.36 to $71.19, and Lockheed Martin, up $1.85 to $66.52.</TE>
<TE>   Economic news helped lift stocks out of their early doldrums.</TE>
<TE>   The government reported that U.S. wholesalers in July built up
their inventories at the fastest rate in 20 months, suggesting that
businesses are stockpiling products to keep up with increased demand.</TE>
<TE>   The report pushed bond yields higher for a second day as
expectations of further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve
receded. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to
4.06% from Friday's close of 4.01%.</TE>
<TE>   More good news came after the close when auto maker Ford Motor
said it would make a small profit in the third quarter instead of the
loss it forecast earlier. Its shares rose to $11.04 in after-hours
trading after ending the regular session up 60 cents to $10.80.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar gained against the euro and the yen for a fourth day on
speculation that the U.S. economic recovery will outpace that of
Europe and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights Monday:</TE>
<TE>   * J.P. Morgan Chase, the most active issue on the NYSE, lost 32
cents to $23.59 but was off its earlier low of $22.08. The Dow
component lost ground after Merrill Lynch cut its rating on the stock
to "neutral" from "buy," citing lower earnings estimates and a
possible dividend cut.</TE>
<TE>   * Intel slid 14 cents to $16.08. The chip maker jumped more than
7% on Friday after trimming its quarterly revenue forecast but not by
as much as feared. Microsoft rose 88 cents to $48.70 after slipping
to $46.63 in the early going.</TE>
<TE>   * Citigroup added 79 cents to $31.07. The company said it was
removing the head of its Salomon Smith Barney corporate and
investment banking unit, as the company faces investigations into the
integrity of its stock picks and its role in the collapses of Enron
and WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   * Nextel Communications rose early after it said it expected to
meet or beat its subscriber growth estimates for the year. But the
stock, the most actively traded issue on Nasdaq, finished down 9
cents at $7.89.</TE>
<TE>   LendingTree rose $1.90 to $15.85. The online lending exchange said
it expected to post a profit in the third quarter instead of the
previously expected loss, citing strength in its mortgage refinancing
and home equity products.</TE>

<HD>Panel Findings on Stewart to Be Disclosed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. lawmakers will discuss today the findings of their investigation
into whether Martha Stewart had inside information when she sold
ImClone Systems Inc. shares.</LD>
<LD>   The House Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Rep. W.J.
"Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) started probing Stewart's trade as part of its
inquiry into ImClone and its cancer drug Erbitux.</LD>
<LD>   Tauzin spokesman Ken Johnson said the congressman plans to
announce his next move in the probe, which could include subpoenaing
Stewart, issuing a report on evidence uncovered or asking the Justice
Department to file charges.</LD>
<TE>   Stewart, the TV celebrity who heads a publishing and merchandising
company, sold nearly 4,000 ImClone shares Dec. 27, a day before the
biotech company disclosed U.S. regulators had refused to review its
Erbitux application. That setback shocked investors and sent ImClone
shares tumbling.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart repeatedly has denied wrongdoing. She has said she sold
the shares because she and her broker had a previous agreement to
unload them if the price fell below $60 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, have fallen sharply
since news of her ImClone sale became public in June. The stock rose
11 cents Monday to $7.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>PayPal Sued Over Payment Patents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Online payment service PayPal Inc. infringed on patented methods of
completing Internet transactions, according to a lawsuit filed in
federal court by a leading credit card issuer.</LD>
<LD>   First USA Bank, owned by Bank One Corp., alleged that PayPal is
using technology protected by two of its patents.</LD>
<LD>   PayPal's "wrongful conduct" has caused First USA, the nation's
third-largest credit card company, "to suffer irreparable harm
resulting from the loss of its lawful patent rights," according to
the suit filed Friday in Delaware. It asks for unspecified damages.</LD>
<TE>   PayPal executives did not respond to requests for comment.</TE>
<TE>   PayPal, most heavily used on Internet auction sites, acts as a
middleman for online transactions, allowing a buyer to make instant
payments even if the seller is not an authorized credit card
merchant. PayPal, founded in 1999, is being acquired by auctioneer
EBay Inc. for $1.5 billion in stock.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions between PayPal and credit card issuers have been growing
because the electronic service--which used to involve credit cards in
almost all of its transactions--is now using bank transfers and other
non-credit card payments nearly half the time.</TE>
<TE>   "PayPal represents the biggest threat to the credit card industry
out there right now," said Avivah Litan, head of research for
Gartner.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of credit cards, PayPal increasingly is using the
automated clearinghouse network, an electronic funds transfer system
governed by the Electronic Payments Assn., which represents more than
12,000 financial institutions.</TE>
<TE>   The automated clearinghouse "costs them just pennies as opposed to
the higher fees the credit card companies charge," Litan said. The
pending sale to EBay has only increased tensions.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people in the business are thinking that it will make
PayPal ever more powerful," Litan said. "EBay is a richer company and
can take PayPal further."</TE>
<TE>   PayPal shares rose 95 cents Monday to $22.73 in Nasdaq trading.
Shares of Chicago-based Bank One rose 93 cents to $40.30 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Verizon, Nextel Confirm Forecasts</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The largest local phone firm reaffirms its outlook
as the wireless company says it will meet or beat expectations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two big telecommunications firms said Monday that they will meet or
beat financial forecasts for this year despite a continuing
deterioration in the industry.</LD>
<LD>   Verizon Communications Inc., the biggest local telephone company,
reaffirmed its 2002 outlook, saying it will earn $3.05 to $3.09 a
share this year on revenue that will be flat or decline by 1%.</LD>
<LD>   Nextel Communications Inc., the nation's sixth-largest
mobile-telephone company, said it will meet or exceed projections for
new customers and operation profit. Nextel expects to add 2 million
subscribers, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization will top $3 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Speaking at a Morgan Stanley conference in Miami, Verizon Chief
Executive Ivan Seidenberg said he wants regulators to close some of
the telephone companies now in bankruptcy protection rather than see
them emerge in better shape in an industry with too much capacity.</TE>
<TE>   "You know Arthur Andersen ran into some trouble and the government
shut them down," he said. "I don't know why they don't do the same
thing with some of these companies that are in bankruptcy right now."</TE>
<TE>   Long-distance phone and data services company WorldCom Inc., which
filed for bankruptcy protection in July, has admitted to $7.68
billion in accounting errors.</TE>
<TE>   Seidenberg said Verizon has had business opportunities it would
not have had if not for the uncertainty created by WorldCom's
bankruptcy filing, but added Verizon has not changed its strategy as
a result, including its move into large corporate business. Verizon
has little interest in buying assets, Seidenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to provide any guidance on the company's wireless
subscriber growth rate, other than to say it sees a lot of activity
and good momentum in its sales.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of New York-based Verizon gained 2 cents to $29.85 in New
York Stock Exchange trading.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel CEO Tim Donahue, also speaking at the Miami conference,
said his company is focusing on selling more phones and services to
existing customers, instead of cutting prices such as rivals Verizon
Wireless Inc. and AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. have done. Nextel's
phones, made by Motorola Inc., feature a walkie-talkie device popular
with construction crews and financial traders.</TE>
<TE>   Donahue said Nextel is paring costs with a new billing system,
with smaller handset subsidies and by signing up customers through
retail stores and the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel said in July that it added 471,000 customers in the second
quarter, even as some analysts were forecasting that the wireless
industry would add subscribers this year at the slowest pace since
1985. Nextel had 9.64 million customers as of June 30.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel's average monthly customer bill rose to $71 in the second
quarter from $68 in the first.</TE>
<TE>   Profit in the quarter totaled $387 million, or 37 cents a share,
compared with a net loss of $369 million, or 56 cents, a year
earlier. Sales rose 25% to $2.15 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel hasn't provided a net income or loss forecast for 2002. The
company lost $3.67 per share last year on sales of $7.01 billion.
Nextel will have a loss in 2002 of 40 cents a share and sales of
$8.65 billion, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Reston, Va.-based Nextel fell 9 cents to $7.89 on
Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>Home prices throughout California will rise at the steepest pace in
more than a decade, growing 18% this year to a record median of
$313,000, according to a forecast released by the California Assn. of
Realtors.</LD>
<LD>   The group added that sales are projected to grow 8.5% to an
all-time high of 547,3000 units, topping the previous peak from 1999.</LD>
<LD>   A growing population, combined with low mortgage rates and a shaky
stock market have drawn more buyers to the market, the report said.
The percentage gain in prices would be the steepest since 1988.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Treasury Department sold $16 billion in three-month bills at a
discount rate of 1.645%, up from 1.61% last week. An additional $13
billion was sold in six-month bills at 1.635%, up from 1.58%.</LD>
<LD>   Both the three-month and six-month rates were the highest since
July 29, when the bills sold for 1.68% and 1.69%, respectively.</LD>
<LD>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.676% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,958.40, and 1.672% for a six-month bill selling for $9,917.30.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year constant-maturity Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, fell to 1.7% last
week from 1.8% the week before.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>DuPont Co. won a judge's final approval to pay $44.5 million to
settle consumer lawsuits claiming the company tried to monopolize the
market for blood-thinning drugs.</LD>
<LD>   More than a dozen suits were filed against DuPont, alleging the
company violated antitrust laws by trying to block approval of a
generic version of Coumadin. The suits were consolidated in federal
court in Delaware.</LD>
<LD>   Chief U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson approved the settlement and
agreed to award plaintiffs' attorneys fees and expenses of about
$10.8 million, or 22.5%, of the settlement fund. About 2 million
consumers who said they paid too much for Coumadin are eligible to
make claims, she said.</LD>
<TE>   DuPont sold its pharmaceutical unit in October to Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. for $7.8 billion in cash.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. consumer debt outstanding surged in July as shoppers whipped out
their credit cards and took advantage of new-car incentives,
according to a Federal Reserve report.</LD>
<LD>   The Fed said consumer credit rose by a seasonally adjusted $10.8
billion in the month, the largest monthly gain since November.</LD>
<LD>   Revolving credit, which includes credit and charge cards, rose by
$6.5 billion, while nonrevolving credit, which includes auto and
other closed-end loans, was up $4.4 billion in the month</LD>
<TE>   Consumer debt in June also was revised upward to an $8.9-billion
gain instead of the $8.4-billion increase initially reported.</TE>
<TE>   The gain in nonrevolving debt had been expected, given
low-interest financing deals offered by car makers. The increase in
revolving debt, however, was something of a surprise because consumer
confidence numbers slipped over the summer. Economists said the
increase in revolving debt showed a more steadfast outlook, as
consumers remained confident enough to continue adding debt.</TE>

<LD>Shooting films, TV shows, commercials and music videos on Los Angeles
streets jumped 26% in August from a year earlier, when production was
at a near standstill because of threatened writer and actor strikes
that never materialized.</LD>
<LD>   The number of production days--one production day is a single day
of shooting on a specific project--climbed to 2,640 in August from
2,096 a year earlier, according to the Entertainment Industry
Development Corp. Feature film permits came to 748 in August, more
than double the number of days in the year-earlier period.</LD>
<LD>   Production days for commercials were flat last month at 490
compared with 484 a year earlier; TV production days were up 22% to
1,267. For the first eight months of the year the number of
production days was off 10% from a year earlier.</LD>

<LD>U.S. wholesalers built up their inventories in July at the fastest
rate in 20 months, the government said, in an encouraging sign for
the economy as it suggests businesses have been boosting stocks to
keep up with increased demand.</LD>
<LD>   Pushed higher by cars and machinery, wholesale inventories
increased 0.6% in July to $284.15 billion, the Commerce Department
said, after a rise of 0.4% in June. That was the fastest rise since a
0.6% increase in November 2000 and outpaced analyst expectations for
a 0.2% increase.</LD>
<LD>   The stocks-to-sales ratio, which measures how long it would take
to deplete stocks at the current sales pace, remained at 1.23 months,
the record low it has stayed at since April.</LD>
<TE>   The growth in inventories was fueled by increased stocks of cars
and machinery.</TE>

<HD>Sonicblue, Intel to Join Forces for Pocket-Sized Video
Player</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to do for digital video what its Rio MP3 players did for
digital music, Sonicblue Inc. on Monday announced plans to make a
pocket-sized portable video player that can store and display
programs from a ReplayTV personal video recorder or a personal
computer.</LD>
<LD>   The company based the new ReplayTV Portable Video Player on a
design developed by Intel Corp., which will supply the chips. No
price was disclosed for the device, which is expected to hit the
market next year.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of Intel and Sonicblue say there is significant
demand among consumers for a portable device that can display TV
shows. One market is for consumers who own personal video recorders
and are accustomed to watching shows on their own schedules, said
Richard Bullwinkle, a product manager at Sonicblue.</LD>
<TE>   The major Hollywood studios and television networks have sued
Sonicblue, accusing the company of violating copyrights with the
latest ReplayTV models. Bullwinkle said the portable players would
support as many of the copyright-protection technologies as possible
and would be unable to transmit shows to other devices.</TE>
<TE>   Few details of the product were released Monday. Bullwinkle said
it would include at least a 40-gigabyte hard drive--enough to store
at least 40 hours of high-quality video--and support at least two
high-speed connections.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Urge End to Steel Trade Barriers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The United States will propose the elimination of international steel
subsidies and trade barriers during talks this week in Paris, a
senior Commerce Department official said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The four-point plan comes just six months after President Bush
slapped hefty tariffs ranging up to 30% on U.S. steel imports to help
domestic firms get back on their feet after a string of bankruptcies.</LD>
<LD>   At the time, the Bush administration said 50 years of government
subsidies for steel worldwide were partly to blame for conditions
faced by the U.S. steel sector.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S.' trading partners criticized it for the steel tariffs,
which they said violated World Trade Organization rules. But the Bush
administration said the action was legal under WTO "safeguard"
provisions, which allow countries to take temporary action against
imports to give domestic firms time to become more competitive.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department official, who spoke on condition that he
not be identified, said the U.S. would outline its ideas during talks
that begin Wednesday in Paris under the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department official rejected suggestions that the
U.S. tariffs would make trading partners less receptive to its idea.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. plan calls on countries to agree to "prohibit
substantially all subsidies to the steel sector," with the possible
exception of money spent to eliminate excess production capacity and
retrain workers, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   It also calls on countries to agree to eliminate all tariffs and
other barriers that "have a dampening effect on trade," the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   In a third area, the U.S. proposal calls for improved enforcement
of domestic competition laws so that steel markets "are allowed to
operate fully," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal also calls for action on practices including
government credits and other forms of preferential financing for
steel firms, as well as bankruptcy procedures that allow inefficient
facilities to continue operating.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. said it opposed industry-specific talks on safeguard
duties such as those Bush imposed or anti-dumping and countervailing
duties used by the U.S. on foreign steel products.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Sunbeam Exec Focus of Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sunbeam Corp. said the Justice Department is investigating former
Chief Executive Albert J. Dunlap's management of the company as the
largest U.S. maker of small appliances revised its bankruptcy
recovery plan.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan is investigating events at
Sunbeam from 1996 through 1998 while Dunlap was chief executive and
Russell A. Kersh was chief financial officer, the company said Friday
in a Bankruptcy Court filing.</LD>
<LD>   Boca Raton, Fla.-based Sunbeam, maker of Mr. Coffee, Oster
blenders and Coleman camping supplies, said the U.S. attorney hasn't
told it the specific focus of the investigation. The firm said in the
Bankruptcy Court filing that it "has no reason to believe that it is
the target" of the investigation.</LD>
<TE>   Dunlap last week agreed to pay $500,000 to settle Securities and
Exchange Commission charges that he defrauded investors by inflating
sales figures. Kersh agreed to pay $200,000. The SEC said Sunbeam
used accounting reserves to widen its reported 1996 loss and inflate
1997 income, contributing "to the false picture of a rapid
turnaround" in Sunbeam's financial performance.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. attorney's investigation focuses on the actions of
former management and we don't anticipate it will negatively impact
our ability to reorganize by year's end," said George A. Davis,
Sunbeam's bankruptcy lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   The recovery plan would give Sunbeam's secured lenders--Morgan
Stanley, Wachovia Corp. and Bank of America Corp.--all of the shares
of the reorganized company. Bondholders, owed $862.4 million, would
get stock options that might have value depending on Sunbeam's
financial performance. Existing Sunbeam shareholders would get
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Sunbeam's suppliers would be fully paid under a separate
reorganization plan filed for the company's operating units.</TE>
<TE>   Sunbeam shares, which traded as high as $53 in 1998, fell 3 cents
to 6 cents in over-the-counter trading.</TE>

<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. said it built a tiny molecular memory chip that

<LD>   The world's biggest personal computer maker crafted a 64-bit
memory device that fits inside 1 square micron, researcher Stan
Williams said in a conference call with reporters. About eight
characters of text can fit on each device, and it would take more

<HD>Quantum to Cut 1,100 Jobs Amid Restructuring</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quantum Corp., a Milpitas, Calif., maker of computer data-storage
devices, will reduce its work force by 1,100, or 37%, as new Chief
Executive Richard Belluzzo seeks to pare costs and return to
profitability by March.</LD>
<LD>   About 80% of the workers cut will be hired by Jabil Circuit Inc.,
which is assuming some Quantum manufacturing. The job cuts and other
costs to restructure will trim earnings by $100 million in the second
and third quarters, Quantum said.</LD>
<LD>   Belluzzo, a former Microsoft Corp. president, joined Quantum last
week. He plans to tighten Quantum's spending and boost sales of
products that are more profitable than hardware systems, such as
services and software, amid a slump in corporate demand for
technology.</LD>
<TE>   Quantum shares fell 21 cents, or 6.5%, to $3.01 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Building on Toyota Motor Corp.'s successful factories in the U.S. and
Canada and seeking to increase its global market share to 15%,
Toyota's chairman said Monday that Japan's largest auto maker is
considering building a fifth assembly plant in North America.</LD>
<LD>   "The population in North America is growing and therefore vehicle
demand will grow," Chairman Hiroshi Okuda told reporters in Tokyo.
"If we want to keep our market share at around 10%, then a new plant
will be necessary."</LD>
<LD>   Okuda would not say where Toyota is considering putting another
factory or what vehicles it would build. It already has assembly
plants in Kentucky, Indiana and Ontario, Canada, along with a plant
run jointly with General Motors Corp. in Fremont, Calif.</LD>
<TE>   Toyota, the world's No. 3 auto maker in terms of volume, is
expected to put any new capacity into high-profit-margin pickup
trucks, sport utility vehicles or luxury vehicles under its Lexus
brand.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota is the third-bestselling brand of cars and trucks in the
U.S., after Ford and Chevrolet. With Lexus, it had 10.2% of the U.S.
market through August.</TE>
<TE>   The auto maker has said that it intends to increase its global
market share from around 10% to 15% sometime after 2010 and that it
wants to produce up to 75% of the cars it sells in North America at
plants here.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota sold 1.74 million vehicles in the U.S. in 2001 and says it
wants to hit 2 million cars and trucks in the coming years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're studying the possibility for increasing our local
production," said Dan Sieger, a spokesman for Toyota Motor
Manufacturing based in Erlanger, Ky. "There are a lot of different
factors, but nothing has been decided at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Industry experts said they would not be surprised if Toyota
decides to build a new plant on the continent.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly can see another Toyota plant in the next few years,
what with earnings and volume doing well," said Michael Flynn,
director of the University of Michigan's automotive think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever vehicles Toyota decides to build at a new plant must fit
in with the U.S. government's mandated gas mileage requirements,
known as corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to be careful in the next step about balancing the CAFE
fleet between vehicles produced domestically and imports," Flynn
said. "They need to be careful they don't put a vehicle into North
America that creates problems for their import fleet. They'd probably
want to bring in a lower-mileage vehicle to build here."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Phillippi, head of AutoTrends Consulting in Short Hills,
N.J., and a longtime investment bank analyst of the auto industry,
said it makes "an enormous amount of sense" for Toyota to build
another factory here.</TE>
<TE>   "Demand is strong, and there are two ways to meet that demand:
import from Japan, which is somewhat politically incorrect, or
produce more here," Phillippi said. "They have a strong supply base
here, so they wouldn't have to stretch a supply line 8,000 miles
long."</TE>
<TE>   Phillippi said Toyota would be well-advised to produce here the
4Runner sport utility vehicle, whose platform will be the
underpinnings of the upcoming Lexus GX 470 SUV. "That would be the
most logical next step because it's a relatively high-volume
vehicle," he said. "They might build 20,000 GX 470s and 80,000
4Runners, and that's half a factory."</TE>
<TE>   A "crossover" vehicle that combines attributes of passenger cars
and SUVs and which are being planned by most auto makers could be
another candidate for U.S. production.</TE>

<HD>Trade Shows Still Lack Visitors</HD>
<DH>Events: Attendance is down nearly 8% in the most recent
quarter as businesses continue to cut back on travel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trade show attendance, hit hard in the weeks immediately after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, remained down in the most recent quarter,
according to a report Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The industry journal Tradeshow Week said attendance was down
nearly 8% for the quarter ended June 30 compared with the
year-earlier quarter, as tightened access to U.S. borders reduced
foreign attendance and businesses continued to cut back on
discretionary travel.</LD>
<LD>   The most recent figure, which does not include shows added this
year, followed declines of 8.1% in the first quarter and 20.4% in the
fourth quarter of last year, the magazine said.</LD>
<TE>   Although technology shows saw some of the steepest drops--about
20% on average--the pain was not restricted to one sector.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlantic City Variety Merchandise Show saw attendance plummet
80%, and the Vending and Food Service Industry expo saw attendance
cut almost in half.</TE>
<TE>   Drops like those, combined with a decrease in the number of
exhibitors and the amount of space used, are sending show producers
scrambling for new strategies, including promoting more shows in
foreign markets.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, more shows are teaming up to share the same schedule
and venue, said Douglas L. Ducate, president of the Chicago-based
Center for Exhibition Industry Research. He cited the Food Marketing
Institute's show in May, which was held alongside a smaller event for
specialty food manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   "Show managers are instituting more aggressive marketing
campaigns," said Carol Andrews, editor of Tradeshow Week. "They're
going after attendees that they didn't before."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the terrorist attacks, the industry was seeing
softening in attendance, number of exhibitors and space used,
Tradeshow Week said.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks pushed those numbers off the charts, with
third-and fourth-quarter shows last year posting record lows for all
three measures. Attendance at the 15 shows that opened in the weeks
after the attacks saw attendance plummet nearly 14%, the industry
publication said.</TE>
<TE>   "The real question is what drops in attendance mean for
exhibitors," Andrews said.</TE>
<TE>   "If attendance isn't what it should be, exhibitors will pull out
of some shows."</TE>

<HD>Retailers Say Sales Are Back on Track</HD>
<DH>Retail: But analysts caution that September's early results
may not foreshadow a lasting rebound for stores.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several retailers, led by No. 1 Wal-Mart Stores Inc., said Monday
that September sales growth is tracking according to plan, providing
slight optimism after several months of gloomy results.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts, however, cautioned that one positive week does not
necessarily foreshadow a lasting rebound, especially because
September sales face easy comparisons with the year-ago month, when
consumers, shaken by the Sept. 11 attacks, reduced spending.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart said sales at stores open at least a year increased
within the expected range of 4% to 6% for the week ended Sept. 6. The
discounter said sales benefited from strong demand for electronics,
intimate apparel, pet supplies, hardware, household chemicals,
pharmacy products and food.</LD>
<TE>   Wal-Mart said it expects September same-store sales at its
struggling warehouse unit, Sam's Club, to improve over August levels,
when they rose 1.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Target Corp. said sales in the week through Sept. 7 were slightly
off plan companywide because of lackluster demand for items such as
menswear, intimate apparel and watches.</TE>
<TE>   But sales at the Target discount division were in line with a
forecast of 3% to 5% growth.</TE>
<TE>   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. said sales for the week trended slightly
above its expectations of "a high single digit decline" for this
month. Sears cited home appliances and hardware among the strong
sellers.</TE>
<TE>   Federated Department Stores Inc., which operates the Macy's and
Bloomingdale's chains, said same-store sales growth was within its
forecast of 3% to 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, all retailers reported weaker-than-expected sales for
August.</TE>
<TE>   J.C. Penney Co., which posted August sales slightly higher than
forecasts, said last week's sales tracked expectations of flat to up
slightly.</TE>

more than 40 laid-off workers on Monday asked a judge to grant the
telecommunications giant's request to pay full severance to
terminated employees. They are seeking an additional $36 million in
severance payments to at least 4,000 employees. AFL-CIO President
John Sweeney, left, called on creditors not to stand in the way of
the company's plan to pay thousands of laid-off, nonunion workers.

<HD>Wheat, Corn Futures Hit Five-Year Highs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock market isn't providing much action for traders lately, but
they can find plenty of it in commodities markets.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, wheat and corn futures in Chicago hit five-year highs
on fears that weather problems will delay harvests and damage crops
in the U.S. and Canada.</LD>
<LD>   In New York, gold's latest rally continued, driving prices to
seven-week highs on jitters about possible new terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Wheat for September delivery jumped 11.5 cents to $4.15 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest price since May 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Wheat is up 46% year to date, putting it on track for its biggest
annual rise since 1991, after drought early in the year stunted plant
growth in North America and Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Now the problem is too much rain in some areas: As much as 1.7
inches of rain fell Sunday in Minnesota, the second-largest U.S.
spring-wheat grower, the National Weather Service said.</TE>
<TE>   The harvest also has been on hold in parts of the western Canadian
prairies and the northern U.S. Plains for three weeks because rain
makes wheat stalks too wet to cut.</TE>
<TE>   September corn futures gained 5.75 cents to $2.79 a bushel, the
highest since October 1997. The corn crop also suffered this year
from drought conditions in many areas.</TE>
<TE>   The return of hot, dry weather this week in parts of the Midwest
is fueling new concerns about the crop.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that 41% of the
corn crop rated "good or excellent," down from 54% at this time a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   In gold futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
September contract rose $1.40 to $321.30 an ounce, highest since July
22.</TE>
<TE>   The approach of the anniversary of the terrorist attacks is
"boosting the appeal of gold as a refuge," said Carlos
Perez-Santalla, president of Hudson River Futures in New York. But he
said gold could tumble if this week passes with no terrorist
incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Gold, which was trading for $272 before last year's attacks,
reached a 4 1/2 year high of $327.80 in early June, then turned
choppy. The price tumbled as low as $302.40 in late July as the stock
market began to rally from five-year lows and some investors shifted
money from gold to stocks.</TE>
<TE>   But the metal has been in a new uptrend since Aug. 26.</TE>

<HD>Brokerages Launch Stock-Ratings Changes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several major brokerages Monday implemented previously announced
changes to their stock ratings systems, seeking to answer criticism
that Wall Street research picks are confusing and overly bullish.</LD>
<LD>   The firms, including Salomon Smith Barney, Bear Stearns, Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. and Credit Suisse First Boston, cut the number of
possible stock ratings and, in some cases, simplified their
terminology. Bear Stearns and CSFB also began to rate stocks against
their industry sector rather than the overall market.</LD>
<LD>   Bear Stearns, which used to have a five-level rating system, now
rates stocks as either "outperform," "peer perform" or
"underperform."</LD>
<TE>   Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup Inc., also reduced its
possible ratings from five to three, similar to the Bear Stearns
system.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill said its ratings of "buy," "neutral" and "sell" replace
the previous four-rating system of "strong buy," "buy," "neutral" and
"reduce/sell."</TE>
<TE>   The revised ratings come after a firestorm of criticism that Wall
Street firms and their analysts have issued too many positive calls
on stocks to please company managements, and that brokerages
purposefully obfuscated their ratings to mislead small investors.</TE>
<TE>   Federal and state securities regulators have ongoing probes into
whether analysts crossed legal lines in the late 1990s by hyping
stocks primarily to generate lucrative banking deals.</TE>
<TE>   Some brokerages moved earlier to simplify their ratings systems.
Morgan Stanley implemented a new system in March, and has 21% of its
stock picks rated as "underweight," its lowest category.</TE>
<TE>   Across the industry, the number of "sell" or "underweight" stock
ratings has remained a tiny minority, even as share prices have
plunged over the last 2 1/2 years.</TE>

<LD>   While the Rangers head toward their third straight last-place
finish, Rodriguez maintains his focus, beating his one-time teammates
as the Mariners attempt to stay in contention.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a responsibility to the rest of the American League West
to continue to play hard," Rodriguez said. "I have a lot of great
friends over there, so it's tough to go against them, but at the same
time it feels good to play well against them. We haven't played a lot
of important games, but when you're playing against playoff
contenders, it brings your game up a notch."</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers homered in their 27th straight game, extending their
big league mark.</TE>
<TE>   Ichiro Suzuki and Desi Relaford led off the game with homers for
the Mariners. But the Rangers rallied behind Rodriguez and stopped
Seattle's three-game win streak.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez hit 52 homers last year, setting the record for
shortstops and the Ranger home run mark.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really humbling to be at the top of the list on a team that
has such a history of great offense," said Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez has 10 multihomer games this season, one short of the
major league record held by Hank Greenberg (1938) and Sammy Sosa
(1998).</TE>
<TE>   Boston 6, Tampa Bay 3--Derek Lowe became the American League's
second 19-game winner despite being ejected at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe (19-7) was leading, 4-3, when he was ejected by plate umpire
Jerry Crawford after hitting Felix Escalona with his first pitch in
the seventh. Lowe also hit Escalona in the fifth inning, but no
warning was issued then.</TE>
<TE>   Manny Ramirez hit a tiebreaking homer, a solo shot in the seventh
off Tanyon Sturtze (3-16) that put Boston ahead, 4-3. Ramirez has six
homers and 18 runs batted in against Tampa Bay this season and 27
homers overall.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 5, Detroit 2--Dustan Mohr hit an RBI double and scored
twice at Minneapolis as the Twins ended their 20-inning scoreless
streak.</TE>
<TE>   After being shut out in consecutive games by Oakland left-handers
Barry Zito and Mark Mulder, the AL Central leaders broke through
against lefty Mike Maroth.</TE>
<TE>   Jacque Jones drove in two runs as the Twins finished with nine
hits, nearly matching their 10-hit output over the last two games.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Reed (14-7), the most consistent starter in Minnesota's
injury-plagued rotation this year, gave up two runs and seven hits in
6 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 10, Kansas City 6--Joe Crede homered twice off Paul Byrd
and Joe Borchard hit an inside-the-park homer to lift the White Sox
at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   The attendance of 9,555 was the lowest at Kauffman Stadium since
July 5, 1995, when 7,511 saw the Royals play the Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 11, Cleveland 9--Josh Phelps, Vernon Wells and Eric Hinske
each homered and drove in three runs to lead the Blue Jays at
Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston ace Pedro Martinez threw in the bullpen and is scheduled to
pitch Wednesday against Tampa Bay after missing two starts because of
a left hip injury.... Texas infielder Herbert Perry agreed to a
$3-million, two-year contract extension that will keep him with the
club through 2004.</TE>

<HD>Angels Finally Lose</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Oakland ends Anaheim's 10-game win streak, 2-1,
with its 23rd victory in 24 games. A's lead American League West by
three games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All season the Angels have been practicing Manager Mike Scioscia's
maxim of worrying about one game at a time.</LD>
<LD>   They haven't panicked in bad stretches and they certainly didn't
admire themselves too much during their 10-game winning streak, the
second-longest in franchise history.</LD>
<LD>   And after the run came to an end with Monday's 2-1 loss to the
Oakland Athletics in front of 28,145 at Edison Field in the first
game of a four-game series, the Angel clubhouse was still full of
players who seemed worried about very little at all.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels (88-55) may have fallen three games behind the
Athletics (91-52) in the American League West race, but they
maintained a four-game lead for the AL wild card over the Seattle
Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a situation we knew was possible, as far as the division
being so tight," said Angel starter Kevin Appier, who lost for the
first time since Aug. 2. "Unfortunately, we were on the wrong side of
it tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Appier (14-10), who had won five consecutive starts with a 1.09
earned-run average in that span, gave up two runs and five hits in 6
2/3 innings. He struck out five and walked two.</TE>
<TE>   "That was some of the best pitching we've seen all year," Scioscia
said of Appier and Oakland starter Tim Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   "Hudson and those guys were just one step ahead of us. They played
some great defense to squelch anything we started.</TE>
<TE>   "You're talking about the top two pitching staffs in the league.
The games are going to be tight, and you've got to play good
fundamental defense."</TE>
<TE>   Hudson (13-9) got the victory after giving up one run and six hits
in 7 1/3 innings. The right-hander, who suffered two defeats to the
Angels in June, struck out four, did not walk a batter and benefited
from two sparking defensive plays to win his sixth consecutive start.</TE>
<TE>   "That was vintage Hudson right there," said Angel leadoff batter
David Eckstein, who was 0 for 3. "His sinker was on tonight. After
that first at-bat, I knew we were in for a dogfight."</TE>
<TE>   Athletic closer Billy Koch worked a perfect ninth inning for his
39th save in a game in which the only scoring came courtesy of three
solo home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland, whose 20-game winning streak ended last Friday but has
won 23 of its last 24, scored first with Jermaine Dye taking Appier
over the center-field wall in the fourth inning for his 18th homer of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland went up 2-0 an inning later when Terrence Long's shot
landed almost halfway up the bleachers in right field for his 14th
homer.</TE>
<TE>   "Not horrible pitches by any means," Appier said. "They were
looking in the right spot. You have to give it to them because that's
something they do well, look for pitches in the right spot."</TE>
<TE>   Garret Anderson cut the lead in half in the bottom of the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson seemed to fool Anderson with an 80-mph off-speed pitch. But
with Anderson's back leg kicking out, he was able to drive the
2-and-1 pitch into the old bullpen beyond the right-field wall for
his team-leading 25th home run.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first run Oakland had given up in 22 innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had a scare in the fifth when Troy Glaus jammed his
left ring finger sliding head-first into second base. Glaus remained
in the game.</TE>
<TE>   The two potential Angel rallies were snuffed out in consecutive
innings.</TE>
<TE>   With two out in the sixth and Adam Kennedy at third, Oakland first
baseman Scott Hatteberg made a diving play to his left to snare Scott
Spiezio's shot down the line and flipped to Hudson covering the bag
to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh, after Anderson led off with a single to right,
Brad Fuller hit a hard grounder up the middle that rolled over the
mound and past second base.</TE>
<TE>   But Oakland shortstop Miguel Tejada rushed over and, with his
momentum taking him toward center field, fielded the ball cleanly and
back-flipped it to second baseman Marl Ellis, who completed the
double play.</TE>
<TE>   "That play Tejada made was ridiculous," Appier said. "That was a
big blow and a tribute to his talent."</TE>

<TE>   Close Calls</TE>
<TE>   The Angels play American League West leader Oakland in seven of
their last 19 games. With Monday's 2-1 loss, the Angels' season
record against the A's is 5-8 with eight of those games decided by
two runs or fewer. A look:</TE>

<HD>Ace Washburn Ready If Needed</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While Jarrod Washburn said he will be ready to pitch Thursday's
series finale against the Oakland Athletics on three days rest, the
left-handed starter said the decision is ultimately out of his hands.</LD>
<LD>   An official announcement will be made today.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel good," Washburn said Monday, nearly 24 hours after
throwing 103 pitches in six innings at Baltimore. "If [Manager] Mike
[Scioscia] and [pitching coach] Buddy [Black] decide that that's the
route we're going to go, then I'm ready.</LD>
<TE>   "I always want to pitch. It's up to the coaching staff to decide
whether I can pitch on three days rest or not. It's not my decision."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said the decision will hinge on the domino effect created
by moving Washburn up.</TE>
<TE>   "If you move one guy in the rotation, you have to weigh some
things to see what makes more sense," Scioscia said. "Is it a darker
picture than you had just going through it?"</TE>
<TE>   The pitcher who would be bumped is right-hander Mickey Callaway,
who was recalled from triple-A Salt Lake on Aug. 24 and has doubled
his career win total by going 1-0 with a 1.86 earned-run average in
three spot starts for the Angels. He said he would have no issues
with being bumped.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just happy to be here and trying to get us some wins,"
Callaway said. "I think [if Washburn does pitch Thursday], I would
pitch the ... following day against Texas so it would just give me an
extra day of rest and that would be great."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, who has won a career-high 17 games in his fifth major
league season, said he has thrown on three days rest before.</TE>
<TE>   "I did it in the minor leagues," he said. "I felt good doing it
then and I don't see any reason why I shouldn't be able to do it
now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Sele, on the disabled list with a torn rotator cuff in his
right shoulder, threw off a mound Monday for the first time since
Aug. 20, when he left the Angels' 7-5 loss at the New York Yankees
with discomfort in the shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Sele reported no pain after the 10-minute session, in which he
threw fastballs from the hill and curveballs from flat ground, and
said his next session would be determined by how he felt today.</TE>

<LD>   What: "The Bravest Team: The Rebuilding of the FDNY Football Club"</LD>
<LD>   Where: ESPN, tonight, 6</LD>
<TE>   If you want to see football played in its purest form--for the
love of sport, for camaraderie, for all the right reasons--you'll see
it in this one-hour NFL Films special.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, 2001, the New York City Fire Department lost 343 men,
among them seven active members and 15 former members of the
department's football team, which has been in existence for 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   The special chronicles the emotional rebuilding of the FDNY team,
called "The Bravest," and climaxes with the annual game against the
New York Police Department team, called "The Finest," at Giants
Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our Army-Navy game," says firefighter Phil Tufano.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Walsh, the president of the FDNY team, says, "Once a year you
get to hit a cop and not get locked up. That's not too bad."</TE>
<TE>   Moving stories are told of some of the players who were lost,
including quarterbacks Pat Lyons and Tom Cullen. Their widows, in
separate interviews, talk about dealing with the tragedy of the
terrorist attacks and what the football team and its players mean to
them.</TE>
<TE>   The FDNY's season included games in San Diego and Orange County,
and the team took a 3-1 record into the big game. If this had been a
Hollywood movie, the fire-fighters team would have beaten the cops
for the first time since 1993. But the police department, which has a
pool of 40,000 from which to recruit, was just too big for the FDNY,
which has a pool of 10,000. The NYPD won the big game, 10-0.</TE>
<TE>   But in this case, the score doesn't matter. This is more about the
game of life than football.</TE>

<HD>Dele, Girlfriend Missing</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Former NBA player and woman not seen since
July 8. They were on boat trip.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bison Dele, a former NBA player, is missing somewhere in the South
Pacific and may be dead. "I don't want to say Bison's dead," said
Dwight Manley, Dele's agent. "But is there any other option?"</LD>
<LD>   Dele, 33, a former Santa Monica St. Monica High standout then
known as Brian Williams, has not been seen since July 8, when Capt.
Bertrand Saldo, skipper of Dele's 55-foot-long, 60-foot-high
catamaran, logged out of the French Polynesian island of Moorea,
bound for Honolulu.</LD>
<LD>   Saldo and Dele were accompanied by at least one other passenger,
Serena Karlan, Dele's girlfriend from Boulder, Colo. Karlan's family
said she had been checking in regularly with her whereabouts but that
she had not been heard from since early July.</LD>
<TE>   Clouding the disappearance is a recent attempt by a man believed
to be Dele's brother to buy gold, using the name Brian Williams, a
brother who might have been sailing with Dele and Karlan as recently
as July.</TE>
<TE>   Dele played for the University of Arizona and five NBA teams in
eight seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Dele changed his name from Brian Williams in 1998 to honor his
Native American roots and the last known slave in his mother's
family. A licensed pilot and scuba diver, Dele chose to retire in
1999 instead of playing out the final three years of a contract with
the Detroit Pistons, which would have paid him $30 million. He moved
to Lebanon to run a water purification plant, then headed to
Australia, where he discovered sailing.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an explorer, and there's a lot to be explored on the water,"
said Patricia Phillips, Dele's mother.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips and Manley said Dele has allowed months to pass without
contacting them before. Phillips said there are differences this
time. Dele is not reachable by his satellite telephone and hasn't
responded to an e-mail about the cancer death of his aunt. His banker
told Phillips that Dele normally checked in monthly but that he had
not done so for two months.</TE>
<TE>   "I've drawn conclusions that run the gamut," Phillips said. "I've
gone from thinking this is just about two lovers who are laying on
the beach and have almost entirely forgotten about their life on the
mainland, to thinking the next phone call will be the police saying,
'We need you to come identify a body.' "</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Phoenix police picked up and questioned a man who had
tried to write a $152,000 check for gold bullion at a coin/exchange
establishment, Certified Mint. Phoenix police and the FBI refused to
identify the person questioned, but Phillips said it was her other
son, Dele's 35-year-old brother, known both as Kevin Williams and
Miles Dabord. Said Phoenix police spokesman Tony Morales: "This guy
identified himself as Brian Williams, but there was not enough
information available to arrest him. We are investigating this as a
possible identity theft. It is in the early stages."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Ohlgren, Serena Karlan's stepfather, said his family had
consulted with Phillips and Dele's personal assistant, Kevin Porter,
to discuss the disappearances in late August. Porter tracked Dele's
bank activity and was notified of the $152,000 check.</TE>
<TE>   A Certified Mint official said he was told to mail the gold to a
Miami address but upon learning that address was for a Mail Boxes
Etc., he told the buyer he would have to pick up the gold in person
and that the transaction would require identification.</TE>
<TE>   The official said Kevin Williams appeared five days later at
Certified Mint to pick up the gold, signing his name "Brian Williams"
and supplying his younger brother's passport.</TE>
<TE>   "We finally thought we were going to get answers," Ohlgren said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Ohlgren added, he was told by Phoenix police that Kevin
Williams was released for "lack of information." Meanwhile, the
search for Dele and Karlan continues.</TE>
<TE>   FBI spokeswoman Susan Herskovits said her agency "obtained some
information last week from the Phoenix Police Department about the
disappearance of a former NBA player."</TE>
<TE>   "At this time, the evidence does not exist to show that this is
more than a missing persons case," Herskovits said.</TE>
<TE>   Morales, the Phoenix police spokesman, said, "We don't even know
if we have a victim."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Rescue Control Center in Tahiti said, "There
is no ability here to give any more information than there is an
investigation in progress."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Janszen, a U.S. Coast Guard lieutenant at the Honolulu Rescue
Control Center, said Tahitian authorities were hamstrung in their
efforts to find a vessel in a 1,000-mile radius.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a reasonable search area, either," Janszen said.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips said Kevin Williams had spent about six months sailing
with Dele, joining him in New Zealand earlier this year, then
departing for the U.S. in early July.</TE>
<TE>   "They were close enough as brothers to set sail together for that
long," she said. "In regard to the missing, I believe [Kevin] knows
more than he is saying."</TE>
<TE>   Manley said he had engaged Laker officials in a discussion of a
Dele comeback this season for his former coach, Phil Jackson, whom
Dele played for on the Chicago Bulls' 1996-97 NBA championship team.</TE>
<TE>   "He connected with Phil," Manley said. "I thought it'd be a good
fit to get them back together. Now, I don't know what to think."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Elliott Teaford and Tim Brown and Jerry Brewer
of the Orlando Sentinel contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Fall Back in Line</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Last in a series of rallies comes up short in a
6-5 loss at San Francisco that drops L.A. into a tie with the Giants
for the NL wild-card lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds hit the longest home run in Pacific Bell Park history in
the second inning Monday night, and the Dodgers responded by
intentionally walking the San Francisco Giant slugger with a runner
on first in the fifth.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the Dodgers should have taken a similar tack with No. 8
hitter David Bell, who had three hits, including a tiebreaking
two-run home run in the sixth, to lead the Giants to a 6-5 victory
over the Dodgers before a sellout crowd of 40,740.</LD>
<LD>   After chasing the Dodgers for almost a month, the Giants finally
pulled even with them atop the National League wild-card standings.
Both the Dodgers and Giants--who will meet six more times over the
next 10 days--are 5 1/2 games behind first-place Arizona in the NL
West.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think [the Giants gained] any kind of psychological edge
by catching us," Dodger first baseman Eric Karros said. "This is
going to be fun. Would we like to be up by 10 games? Sure. But you
come to the park every day knowing there's going to be a playoff
atmosphere, that one pitch, one at-bat, one play here or there can
turn the game around."</TE>
<TE>   Monday night, most of those critical at-bats came with Bell at the
plate. Livan Hernandez (10-15) threw seven strong innings, giving up
three runs and six hits and striking out five, and closer Robb Nen
recorded his franchise-record 200th save, but it was Bell, the
unheralded third baseman, who was most responsible for extending the
Giants' win streak to four and the Dodgers' losing streak to three.</TE>
<TE>   "Bell killed us," Karros said. "He just wore us out from that
eight hole."</TE>
<TE>   Eight-hole batters rarely get much to hit because the pitcher
follows them in the lineup, but that didn't seem to deter Dodger
starter Odalis Perez (13-9). Bell singled and scored in the third
inning, hit a two-out RBI single in the fourth and followed Ramon
Martinez's one-out single in the sixth with his 20th homer of the
season to snap a 3-3 tie.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco, which has won 16 of its last 21 games, added an
insurance run off reliever Paul Shuey in the seventh when Rich
Aurilia tripled to left-center and scored on Jeff Kent's sacrifice
fly, the 1,000th run batted in of Kent's career.</TE>
<TE>   That turned out to be the deciding run after the Dodgers rallied
for two runs in the top of the eighth, an inning aided by Bonds'
fielding error. Shawn Green singled with one out, and Adrian Beltre
snapped an 0-for-21 skid with a single to left. The ball rolled under
Bonds' glove, allowing Green to score and Beltre to take second.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre advanced on reliever Felix Rodriguez's wild pitch, and
Brian Jordan popped to second. Karros greeted Nen with an RBI single
to center, making it 6-5, but Nen got pinch-hitter Dave Hansen to
ground out and retired the Dodgers in the ninth for his 37th save of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Give some credit to David Bell--he had a great night against us
offensively, and it hurt us," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "They
got some big runs from the bottom of their lineup."</TE>
<TE>   And one prodigious run from the middle.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, the Dodger left-hander, pitches with a lot of
bravado--confidence may be the primary reason he has emerged as one
of baseball's best young pitchers this season--and he refuses to back
down to anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Perez tried to slip a first-pitch fastball by Bonds in the second
inning, and Bonds sent it on a space mission, smashing a towering
solo home run to straightaway center that traveled an estimated 491
feet, the longest in stadium history.</TE>
<TE>   That gave Bonds 43 homers this season and 610 in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Aurilia's RBI single in the third made it 2-0, but the Dodgers
evened the score in the top of the fourth inning on Brian Jordan's
two-run double, which followed singles by Paul Lo Duca and Green.</TE>
<TE>   So began a familiar pattern for the Dodgers, who fell behind again
in the bottom of the fourth, tied it, 3-3, in the top of the sixth
when Karros legged out an RBI infield single, fell behind on Bell's
homer in the bottom of the sixth and came up just short in the end.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy expects nothing less from the remaining six Dodger-Giant
games, as a rivalry that spanned some 70 years in New York and
another 40 or so on the West Coast resumes with a playoff berth on
the line.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be draining, it can be exhilarating--it's an emotional
roller coaster," Tracy said of the NL West race.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything takes on a larger meaning. Every play has more
importance. But it's an opportunity to get a taste of what it would
be like to play in October."</TE>
<TE>   But if the Dodgers somehow reach October, and it's anything like
Monday night, they're going to need a bulk-sized portion of antacid
tablets.</TE>

<HD>Blister Forces Ashby to Miss Tonight's Start</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Right-hander Andy Ashby, knocked out of tonight's start against the
Giants because of a blister and an infection on the middle finger of
his pitching hand, has been bothered by the condition for most of the
season.</LD>
<LD>   But any comparison between Ashby, who will be replaced by Kevin
Brown, and former Dodger Ismael Valdes, whose career has been plagued
by blister problems, ends there. Valdes almost always made his
blisters public, and that did not endear him to teammates, who felt
he made excuses. Ashby's condition was not revealed until Monday,
when Manager Jim Tracy was forced to shuffle his rotation.</LD>
<LD>   "He's such a tremendous competitor, there's no excuses with him,"
General Manager Dan Evans said.</LD>
<TE>   Ashby, who is scheduled to pitch again Sunday at Colorado, had not
missed a start this season despite coming off surgery to repair a
torn flexor tendon in his elbow. He is 9-11 with a 3.54 earned-run
average and has thrown 175 1/3 innings in 28 games.</TE>
<TE>   But the blister on Ashby's finger popped during an Aug. 24 start
against Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to do his normal between-starts work, he was rocked for
five runs in three innings in his next start, an 8-4 loss to Houston
on Aug. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby gave up five runs in the first inning of Wednesday's 7-1
loss to Arizona, after which an infection developed under his
fingernail.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chin-Feng Chen became the first Taiwanese player to reach the
major leagues when the Dodgers recalled the first baseman from
triple-A Las Vegas Monday. Also recalled were outfielder Luke Allen
and pitchers Victor Alvarez and Robert Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   Chen, 24, hit .284 with 26 home runs and 84 runs batted in at Las
Vegas.</TE>

<HD>Taft Is Favored to Nail the Ending This Time</HD>
<DH>Football: Stunned by Dorsey on final play in last season's
City Section title game, Toreadors are talented and determined.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The play is in the past as far as the Woodland Hills Taft football
team is concerned.</LD>
<LD>   But according to the adage, to succeed in the future, you must
learn from the past. So if the Toreadors are to win a City Section
championship, they will have to master the art of special teams.</LD>
<LD>   Dorsey defeated Taft, 19-14, for the title last season by blocking
a punt on the game's final play and recovering the ball in the end
zone for a touchdown.</LD>
<TE>   A loss like that could weigh on a team, but Taft Coach Troy Starr
said he isn't one to look back.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a new year," said Starr, entering his 12th season. "We've
just moved on."</TE>
<TE>   If the sight of Henry Madge pouncing on the loose football in the
end zone is more than a memory, the best way to erase it is to reach
the Coliseum again and write a new ending. That could happen for
Taft, the favorite to hoist the championship trophy in December.</TE>
<TE>   Two-way star Steve Smith, who has 185 receptions and 19
interceptions in two varsity seasons, returns for his senior season
as the reigning City player of the year. He teams with Noah Smith and
Paul Pratt as a group of receivers who could double as a sprint relay
team.</TE>
<TE>   They have California-bound quarterback Cary Dove to get them the
ball, and top linebacker prospect Lance Broadus leads the defense.</TE>
<TE>   In late July, running back Ian Bell transferred to Taft from
Pasadena Muir, where he ran for 947 yards and 12 touchdowns last
season as a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   Carson should also be a title contender with its deep set of
running backs, a bruising offensive line and a defense led by tackle
Matt Malele.</TE>
<TE>   Carson plays at Taft in a nonleague game on Sept. 20. The
Toreadors knocked the Colts out of the playoffs last season with a
17-14 victory in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "Put it this way, I love to chase rather than lead," Carson Coach
John Aguirre said of Taft's role as preseason favorite. "Do I still
have a bad taste in my mouth? Yes."</TE>
<TE>   Lake Balboa Birmingham has beaten Taft the last two seasons to win
the West Valley League.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Dennis Keyes, a top running back and defensive back, the
Patriots have great team speed and figure to get a boost with the
addition of quarterback Ryan Lombardo, a transfer from Newbury Park.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Dorsey and Fremont, with returning All-City
receiver Mark Bradford, also figure in the race for the title.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adding flavor to the nonleague portion of the season are a number
of intersectional games between City and Southern Section teams.</TE>
<TE>   Among the matchups:</TE>
<TE>   * Dorsey will play perennial Division I power Santa Margarita, No.
9 in The Times' preseason rankings, at Saddleback College on Sept.
27.</TE>
<TE>   * Banning plays No. 14 Manhattan Beach Mira Costa, a Division III
favorite, on Sept. 27 at Gardena High, Santa Fe Springs St. Paul on
Oct. 4 at Gardena High and No. 3 Loyola on Oct. 12 at Glendale High.</TE>
<TE>   * Birmingham will play host to No. 8 Newhall Hart, four-time
Division III champion, on Oct. 4.</TE>
<TE>   * Crenshaw plays at No. 6 Mission Viejo, the Division II champion,
on Oct. 4 .</TE>
<TE>   * Carson plays host to No. 2 Los Alamitos on Oct. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey Coach Paul Knox said there are benefits to scheduling top
Southern Section opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "Some teams are feeling that they want to get some quality
nonleague games in going into their league season," he said. "Maybe
they want to get battle-tested."</TE>
<TE>   Birmingham Coach Ed Croson said the benefits go both ways.</TE>
<TE>   "The Southern Section schools recognize there is more speed and
raw talent in the City," he said. "They want to see some of that
before they get into their league. Our kids can see disciplined teams
and kids that play hard."</TE>
<TE>   Harbor City Narbonne's first-year coach, Manuel Douglas, said true
respect for City Section football, which some have perceived as
dropping off in quality in recent years, will only come with
victories.</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw Coach Robert Garrett, whose team defeated Loyola three
years ago, has no preference of opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter who they are," he said. "If they have a field,
if they have a ball, we'll travel. We've never had a problem playing
anybody."</TE>

<HD>Division I Gets Stronger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corona del Mar and Calabasas highs have been powerful fixtures in
Southern Section Division IV girls' tennis, with the Sea Kings
winning the last two championships and the Coyotes claiming the 1999
title.</LD>
<LD>   While Division IV was arguably as strong as any division in the
section, league and playoff realignments will move both schools into
the talent-laden Division I, where schools of large, medium and small
enrollments will be pitted against one another.</LD>
<LD>   "Wouldn't it be great if both of us ended up in the finals again,
in Division I this time?" Calabasas Coach Bill Bellatty said. "That'd
be something."</LD>
<TE>   It could happen, because Corona del Mar and the Pacific Coast
League schools, and Calabasas, which makes a jump to the Marmonte
League, have been moved to Division I as the section forged
divisional playoff groupings based on league strength instead of
school enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   The Coyotes' move to Division I will take place after another
transition is completed. Calabasas, the Frontier League champion the
last four years, will move into the highly competitive Marmonte
League.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives us more competition," Bellatty said. "I've wanted this
for years. Nothing taken away from the other teams in the Frontier
League, but we were pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Although Calabasas will be without Monica Wiesener, the No.
10-ranked player in Southern California in the girls' 18 division,
the Coyotes still have four top-notch singles players and experienced
doubles teams. Their arrival undoubtedly contributed to the Marmonte
League's move to Division I after having members in Divisions II, III
and IV under enrollment-based alignment.</TE>
<TE>   It is a change not all Marmonte schools eagerly anticipate.</TE>
<TE>   "When I heard about it, I was just very irritated, to say the
least," said Coach Connie Flanderka of Westlake Village Westlake,
which has won three consecutive Marmonte titles and 16 of the last
23. "We get hit with a double-whammy. We get Calabasas in the league
and we get moved up to Division I."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Warriors have won four division titles in seven
trips to the finals, Flanderka believes a team should be more than
viable competition for others. She believes a team should have a
realistic chance to advance to the later rounds--which she considers
to be the semifinals and beyond--if it is to be grouped in a
particular division.</TE>
<TE>   "Division III was hard enough," Flanderka said. "It's supposedly
competitively balanced, but I think they're going to find out that
it's not."</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors contributed to their league's power rating by
advancing to the Division III semifinals last year. But they were
beaten badly, 17-1, in that match by eventual-champion Beverly Hills.
And despite past postseason success and a tradition of being a
Ventura County tennis power, Westlake hasn't appeared in a division
final since 1996, when the Warriors lost the Division III
championship to Irvine Woodbridge, the runner-up in the division last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Division I has always been stocked with talented players and
teams, although Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula has won four
consecutive titles and 10 of the last 11. Bay League rival Beverly
Hills will move into the division as well.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's Division I runner-up, Dana Point Dana Hills of the
South Coast League, remains in the division, while last season's
Division II runner-up, Newport Harbor, moves up a division with the
Sea View League. Century, Mission, Pacific Coast and Serra league
members, traditionally in lower-enrollment divisions, now will
compete at the highest level. Baseline League teams will join Upland
in Division I as well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of new and exciting to us all," said Calabasas senior
Erin Everly, expected to split time in the Coyotes' No. 1 spot with
junior Celia Durkin, sophomore Amanda Fink and freshman Kristen
McVitty. "I'm excited about it. Our school's kind of known as a good
tennis school, and I'd like to keep that reputation."</TE>

<LD>A preseason look at the Top 10 girls' tennis teams in the Southland:</LD>
<LD>   1. Corona del Mar (SS-Division I)</LD>
<LD>   Brittany Reitz has graduated, leaving Anne Yelsey, ranked No. 21
nationally in girls' 18 division, as undisputed No. 1 player for Sea
Kings, who move up after winning last two Division IV titles.</LD>
<TE>   2. Palm Desert (SS-Division II)</TE>
<TE>   Senior Robyn Baker and freshmen Hillary Collins and Brittany
Blalock are in the top 25 in Southern California for their age
groups, and the team has seven players among the top 100.</TE>
<TE>   3. Calabasas (SS-Division I)</TE>
<TE>   Took a hit when Monica Wiesener decided not to play, but Celia
Durkin, Erin Everly, Amanda Fink and Kristen McVitty will share top
spot as Coyotes get challenged in new league and division.</TE>
<TE>   4. Dana Hills (SS-Division I)</TE>
<TE>   Kady Pooler should vie for Southern Section singles title and the
Division I runner-up can only benefit from the addition of freshman
Sarah Fansler, the No. 1 player in Southern California girls' 16s.</TE>
<TE>   5. Beverly Hills (SS-Division I)</TE>
<TE>   Riza Zalameda's decision to return for her junior season and the
return of senior Irina Shef from a shoulder injury that sidelined her
most of last season is huge for last year's Division III champion.</TE>
<TE>   6. Troy (SS-Division II)</TE>
<TE>   Singles lineup of Serena Fermin, Clare Fermin and freshman Cosmina
Ciobanu, the SCTA girls' 16 sectional champion, is good enough to
carry the defending Division II champion.</TE>
<TE>   7. Peninsula (SS-Division I)</TE>
<TE>   Alex Jurewitz and Macall Harkins return, but the Panthers may be
hard-pressed to win their fifth consecutive Division I title.</TE>
<TE>   8. Campbell Hall (SS-Division III)</TE>
<TE>   Division V semifinalist last year is young but experienced.</TE>
<TE>   9. Woodbridge (SS-Division I)</TE>
<TE>   Division III runner-up will rely on senior Elizabeth Exon,
sophomores Ashley Williams and Samantha Reeve, and the doubles team
of seniors Lindsay Rye and Heather Hustedt.</TE>
<TE>   10. Capistrano Valley (SS-Division I)</TE>
<TE>   Depth and experience from last year's Division I semifinal team
remains.</TE>

<HD>Ishii Probably Out for Season</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Pitcher has surgery to insert titanium plate in
his head. Brown will start today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Kazuhisa Ishii probably won't pitch again this season after
undergoing nasal-cavity surgery early Monday morning, Kevin Brown is
back in the rotation despite not being fully recovered from multiple
surgeries the last two seasons, and the Dodgers are approaching the
finish line with their fingers crossed.</LD>
<LD>   The emergency rotation makeover occurred after Ishii suffered a
fractured skull when he took a line drive off his head in Sunday's
6-2 loss to the Houston Astros at Dodger Stadium, prompting a
two-hour procedure to insert a titanium plate. The left-hander could
be released from Cedars Sinai Medical Center at the end of the week,
but "it may be a while before he's back playing," team physician
Michael Mellman conceded.</LD>
<LD>   Ishii leads the staff with 14 victories despite command problems
in an uneven first season in the major leagues, and his departure has
moved Brown back to a starting role faster than the Dodgers would
prefer. The onetime staff ace has shown only flashes of his former
form since being activated from the disabled list Aug. 15 after
surgery to remove a herniated disk. Manager Jim Tracy had hoped to
ease Brown back to be ready for the playoffs. That plan was scrapped
with Ishii in the hospital, Andy Ashby struggling and experiencing
blister problems, and the National League West and wild-card races
seemingly getting tighter by the inning.</LD>
<TE>   Brown is scheduled to make his first start since May 26 today
against the San Francisco Giants in the second game of a key
three-game showdown at Pacific Bell Park, and the rotation is in flux
with the window closing on the season.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll take what he can give us, and we know that it will be the
best he has," Tracy said. "At this time of the year, in the position
that our club is in, he's the right guy, with health obviously being
the big issue with us."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby, who had been scheduled to start today, has been pushed back
to Sunday against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field because of a
blister and infection of the middle finger of his pitching hand. Omar
Daal will start the opener on Thursday. Tracy said he has not
determined Friday's starter, and Odalis Perez is scheduled to start
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are carrying 11 relievers on the expanded 40-man
roster, so they could start a reliever such a Giovanni Carrara, limit
the right-hander to 75 pitches and have plenty of support behind him.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are trying to go across the finish line, every club that
gets itself in this position incurs roadblocks long the way," Tracy
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This team has endured a hell of a lot, but this team is resilient
as hell, and it's showing characteristics of a very good team. It's
not a playoff team yet, obviously, but it's a very good team."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were tested again Sunday when Ishii was struck on the
left side of his forehead by a drive off the bat of the Astros' Brian
Hunter in the fourth inning. Ishii, who turned 29 on Monday, was
transported by ambulance to Good Samaritan Hospital, where a CT scan
revealed he had a small fracture on top of his forehead. Tests later
showed the nasal fracture.</TE>
<TE>   Surgeon John Yu operated on Ishii after he was brought to Cedars
Sinai. Team trainer Stan Johnston said Ishii needed the titanium
plate "because the fracture was in small pieces that don't heal very
well," and the risk of sinus problems throughout his life would have
increased without the procedure.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have been tremendously worse," Johnston said. "He could
have had brain trauma, which they did check, and there was no
bleeding around the brain. Everything looked very good."</TE>
<TE>   Johnston said Ishii, who was eating and walking on his own Monday,
would continue to be monitored for 48 to 72 hours after surgery
because bleeding can still occur from concussions during that time
frame after surgery. When Ishii does return, he will undergo a
battery of hand-eye-coordination tests.</TE>

<HD>With Wells, Yankees Are in Teeth of the Storm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU> Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jon Heyman in Newsday: "David Wells should consider himself fortunate
that he still has 30 of his 32 teeth, and what's left of his
faculties. He also should consider his diner-dust up a wake-up call
to change his ways. But of course, he won't.</LD>
<LD>   "Wells is the pitcher who never sleeps. Or thinks, even.</LD>
<LD>   "This is where the Yankees need to step in. Wells' duke-out at
dawn should be a warning that he needs more than a stern talking-to.
He needs sleeping pills, an in-home entertainment center, a
baby-sitter, something to get him back to his crib and asleep at a
reasonable hour."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which school holds the NCAA Division I-A record for
consecutive non-losing football seasons?</TE>
<TE>   Let's wait awhile: Rick Morrissey of the Chicago Tribune wasn't
impressed with Notre Dame's 24-17 victory over unranked Purdue.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever Notre Dame (2-0) is running, this isn't the West Coast
offense of Joe Montana or Steve Young. There were four-receiver sets
Saturday, but they were like a turret on a lean-to. They had no real
purpose.</TE>
<TE>   "Has the glory returned to Notre Dame? I don't know. But the
belief system, the one based on results and not ancient history,
seems to be sneaking back.</TE>
<TE>   "This belief system, however, does recommend the use of rosary
beads."</TE>
<TE>   More Irish: Paul Hornung, a former Heisman Trophy winner and a
regular at Irish games: "You can call it an air of confidence or good
feeling, but something is happening at Notre Dame. It's because of
[Coach Tyrone] Willingham."</TE>
<TE>   Shaky winner: Bernie Lincicome of the Rocky Mountain News,
commenting on Denver quarterback Brian Griese's uneven performance in
the Broncos' 23-16 victory over St. Louis on Sunday in Denver: "He
went from one step away from Dead Man Sulking to Prince of the City.</TE>
<TE>   "Griese was booed when the Broncos were ahead, not exactly the
sort of encouragement expected in the first game of the season,
especially from as great a collection of optimists as ever enjoyed
the comforts of seatbacks and cup holders.</TE>
<TE>   "When the home crowd winces at every snap, this is not toleration,
it is dread."</TE>
<TE>   Big shrimp now: Chad Morton, the 5-foot-8 former USC tailback, who
began his NFL career with the New Orleans Saints, emerged from
relative obscurity with two kickoff returns for touchdowns in the New
York Jets' overtime victory over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Shaun Powell in Newsday: "He was lost in New Orleans, a lone
shrimp in a bowl of gumbo."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1983, USC opened the football season
with a 19-19 tie with Florida at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Penn State, 49, from 1939 to 1987.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Ira Miller in the San Francisco Chronicle, comparing

<DH>Vargas continues pressing Mexican heritage issue with De La
Hoya</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fernando Vargas long has fancied himself a favorite of Mexican fight
fans, the very same crowd that has been hesitant to fully embrace
Oscar De La Hoya.</LD>
<LD>   But Vargas recently pressed the issue, asserting that Mexicans are
united in his corner for Saturday's super-welterweight title fight at
the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   The reason, Vargas says, is that fight fans recognize him as the
"real Mexican" of the two fighters--which by his description is one
who still has rough edges and rubs elbows with many of the same
blue-collar, working-class friends he grew up with.</LD>
<TE>   De La Hoya, Vargas claims, has drifted too far from his roots and
has become disconnected with his heritage.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of being a Mexican," Vargas said. "I fight like a
warrior like Mexicans do. People are attracted to me and dig me
because of my pride."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas enjoys portraying himself as a representative of the
immigrant underdog while mocking De La Hoya's "Golden Boy" image,
complete with model good looks, singing career and a stable full of
celebrity friends.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya has shot back, saying that Vargas' description of a
Mexican sounds to him like that of a gang banger.</TE>
<TE>   "What is 'being a Mexican?' " De La Hoya said. "I don't know what
that means.... I want to progress and do better, contribute to the
community. What's wrong with that?</TE>
<TE>   "What he says is insulting to a lot of hard-working people. What?
You've got to dress like a thug, surround yourself with bad people
and talk like that? That is degrading. That is not what the Mexican
people are about."</TE>
<TE>   As for Mexican fight fans, many seem to be rolling their eyes and
calling absurd the notion that either of the fighters--Vargas born in
Oxnard; De La Hoya in East Los Angeles--is any more "Mexican" than
the other. Both represented their home country--the U.S.--in the
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   But to others, such as Richard T. Rodriguez, assistant professor
of Chicano Studies at Cal State Los Angeles, the issue is a serious
one. He said any talk of ethnic authenticity is destructive.</TE>
<TE>   "It further divides our community, pits one against the other,"
Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do we need to authenticate people? Why even pose the
question, 'Who is the real Mexican?' There's no such thing as a real
Mexican. To answer that would just perpetuate a stereotype and
alienates people who don't fit that criteria."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez said De La Hoya has been victimized by his own efforts
to blend U.S. and Mexican cultures. As a result, he is not fully
accepted by either group.</TE>
<TE>   Francisco Ceja, a Cal graduate who has been teaching history at
Roosevelt High, his alma mater, for eight years, says his students
often have a misguided view on what it means to be proud of their
heritage, but will look to role models in sports.</TE>
<TE>   "It's silly, but I hear that discussion come up with my students,"
Ceja said. "They say Vargas is more 'down'--in touch with his roots.
Then I'll ask, 'What does it mean to be down? What does it mean to be
Mexican? Can you be clean cut? Do you have to be one of the homies?'
They can't give me a real answer."</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time a fight has divided members of the same
ethnic or racial group.</TE>
<TE>   Against the backdrop of the Vietnam War and heated race relations,
Muhammad Ali characterized Joe Frazier as the "white man's champion"
and repeatedly called him an Uncle Tom before their first fight, in
1971.</TE>
<TE>   Many fight fans would prefer boxers talk less and concentrate more
on what they do in the ring.</TE>
<TE>   "They're both brown inside and the fight's got nothing to do with
race," said Jaime Fernandez, 17, between workouts at the La Colonia
Boxing Club in Oxnard, Vargas' hometown gym.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya has criticized Vargas for trying to divide Mexican
fans, but promoter Bob Arum has used De La Hoya's dual heritage to
suit a marketing plan. Against an American or European foe, De La
Hoya might enter the ring dressed in a sombrero or a traditional
Mexican outfit. Against Mexican fighters such as Rafael Ruelas and
Julio Cesar Chavez, he might enter adorned in red, white and blue.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most accurate among Vargas' claims is that his boxing
style is more traditionally Mexican than De La Hoya's. Vargas, though
hardly a brawler in the likeness of Mexico-born slugger Chavez, is
far more likely to willingly trade punches.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya's critics recall Felix Trinidad, after defeating De La
Hoya for the World Boxing Council and International Boxing Federation
welterweight titles in 1999, yelling in Spanish to Chavez, the former
world champion who was seated at ringside.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Julio he is a real Mexican champion and De La Hoya is
not," the Puerto Rico-born Trinidad said afterward. "De La Hoya is a
chicken, not a Mexican--Chicken De La Hoya."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas said many Mexicans were embarrassed by Trinidad's comments.
"The way [De La Hoya] went out left a lot of Mexican people bitter
and [mad] because he didn't try to finish the last few rounds,"
Vargas said.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez showed up at a pre-fight rally for Vargas earlier this
year. And although he used to say that De La Hoya would never capture
the support of Mexican fight fans because he was born in the U.S.,
Chavez isn't holding Vargas to that standard.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though he's from the [the U.S.], he's Mexican," Chavez said.
"And just as Mexican fans were always with me, they'll be with
Vargas."</TE>
<TE>   That said, many south-of-the-border fans feel less of a connection
to boxers with Mexican surnames than they do to other famous
fighters. Indeed, with all the talk about who is more Mexican, Mike
Tyson is probably more recognizable in Mexico than either Vargas or
De La Hoya, said Mauricio Cardenas, a longtime sportscaster for
Univision, the largest Spanish-speaking television network in the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "If Vargas was standing in the middle of Vera Cruz, no one would
know who he was," said Cardenas, who splits time between working in
Mexico and Los Angeles. "Maybe if you're a big sports fan [you'd]
know Oscar. Maybe."</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home, at the L.A. Boxing Club, both fighters are easily
recognizable, but the issue of ethnic authenticity is no less clear.</TE>
<TE>   "Mexican fans just want a good fight," said Victor Hernandez, who
has been a trainer for 30 years. "They say Oscar dances around in the
ring. They want him to just brawl, just throw punches without
thinking. But Oscar is smarter than that, so he'll never give fans
what they want and that's why they'll never really accept him."</TE>
<TE>   Another longtime trainer, Hector Saldivar, said the animosity
toward De La Hoya is easily explainable.</TE>
<TE>   "I see it all the time, the same guys that criticize De La Hoya
will be the first ones to greet him when he comes and visits the
gym," Saldivar said.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar trains Jesus Delgado, 12, who has been working out at the
gym since he was 8.</TE>
<TE>   Delgado hasn't decided who he prefers, but when asked who is "the
real Mexican," he stops shadow boxing and looks up.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know. What do you mean? They're both Mexican," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Aren't they?"</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Paul Gutierrez and Steve Springer contributed
to this report.</TE>

<TE>   The long count came to basketball. With three seconds put back on
the clock--not once, but twice--the Soviet Union finally scored the
winning basket in a 51-50 victory over the United States that remains
one of the most controversial games in Olympic history. It was the
first loss for the United States since basketball became an Olympic
sport in 1936. The U.S. players to this day have not accepted their
silver medals.</TE>

<TE>   U.S. Takes Sprint Relay</TE>
<TE>   Frank Shorter, a wispy, mustachioed Yale graduate, won the
marathon by more than two minutes. He entered the stadium moments
after a runner wearing No. 72, a 16-year-old West German student who
managed to penetrate heavy security and run almost an entire lap
before he was stopped. The United States won the 400-meter relay.
That was particularly gratifying to Eddie Hart, who had been
disqualified from the 100 after arriving late for the start of his
second-round heat. Finland's Lasse Viren, who had fallen yet still
won the 10,000 meters 11 days before, completed the double by winning
the 5,000.</TE>
<TE>   The United States' Steve Prefontaine, a cult hero among the U.S.
running community and the man for whom the original Nike shoes were
made, forced the pace entering the final mile, then paid for it by
fading and finishing fourth. He died at 24 in an automobile crash on
May 30, 1975.</TE>

<HD>Angels, A's Are Cautious About Wild Card</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So, putting aside the issues of pride, marketing and territorial
bragging rights, how important is this battle for the American League
West title?</LD>
<LD>   How critical is it to begin the playoffs as a division winner
rather than a wild card?</LD>
<LD>   How vital is it to have a shot, as the division winner, at
home-field advantage in the five-game divisional round--perhaps the
most intense of the postseason--and seven-game league championship
series while the wild card has no shot at that advantage in either of
those series and is forced to open against the tougher of the two
remaining division winners?</LD>
<TE>   History suggests it is vital, indeed, but what is history compared
to the Oakland A's, who went to the playoffs as a division winner in
2000, a wild card in 2001, are a walking, talking sounding board on
the subject and insist it doesn't matter how a team qualifies for the
postseason--home-field advantage or not.</TE>
<TE>   Or as David Justice, who has played in a record 107 postseason
games, put it:</TE>
<TE>   "It ain't how you get in as long as you get in.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is on equal footing in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Well, the New York Yankees have generally proved to be on a little
different footing than most in winning four of the last six World
Series, but that wasn't Justice's point.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, with three AL West teams competing for the division and
wild-card berths, it was probably not a surprise to find the A's and
Angels adopting a cautious just-get-there approach as they opened
their important four-game series at Edison Field on Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   For the A's, who went to the final game of the divisional round
before losing to the Yankees in each of the last two years, there's
the reality of that experience.</TE>
<TE>   For the Angels, it's all theory.</TE>
<TE>   They haven't been to the playoffs since 1986, when there were only
two divisions in each league and the 1995 birth of the wild card was
still only a purist-infuriating sparkle in Bud Selig's eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't researched the formula," Manager Mike Scioscia said
when asked if he believed there was an advantage on how a team
reaches the playoffs. "If the wild card doesn't get a home-field
advantage [in either of the first two rounds], that could mean
something, but I think the big thing is not where you're playing but
who you're playing. Let's hope we get far enough to find out."</TE>
<TE>   If Scioscia's Angels seldom waver from the manager's mantra of
playing them one at a time, it's tough to argue with a successful
formula.</TE>
<TE>   Seldom have two teams been more dominating as they approached a
key September series than the Angels and A's, combining to win 32 of
the last 33 games, and Scioscia might have been justified in
suggesting that "a case could be made" for believing that whichever
team comes out of the West as the wild card "it might be the
strongest" yet in that category.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, with the Boston Red Sox just about out of wild-card hope
in the East and the reality of the calendar and standings beginning
to weigh against the Seattle Mariners as they struggle to keep pace
in the West, it's conceivable that the A's and Angels could reach the
playoffs with the league's best records.</TE>
<TE>   The A's already have the best at 91-52, while the Angels are third
at 88-55, one game behind the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the A's won 102 games as the wild card last year, seven
more than the Yankees did in winning the East, and still lost in the
first round despite winning the first two games at Yankee Stadium
(the vision of Jeremy Giambi not sliding at the plate in Game 3 still
haunts the A's).</TE>
<TE>   In addition, even if the A's or Angels begin the playoffs as the
wild card with more wins than the Yankees, they would not have
home-field advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Based on Monday's standings, the Yankees would play host to the
Angels and the A's would play host to Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   If there's added motivation to win the division and avoid that
opening date with the Yankees, it's a little late to be looking for
added motivation.</TE>
<TE>   As Justice noted, the postseason is a whole new season, although
the record indicates that it's definitely tougher for a wild card.</TE>
<TE>   Eight of the 14 have lost in the first round, including the
Yankees twice. Only two--the 1997 Florida Marlins and 2000 New York
Mets--have advanced to the World Series, with only the Marlins
winning.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," said Justice, dismissing those statistics, "it's always
nice to have a home-field advantage, but at some point you have to
win on the road, and you're probably not going to be in the playoffs
anyway unless you've played well on the road."</TE>
<TE>   Teammate Eric Chavez concurred, saying the A's only objective is
to qualify for the third consecutive year, to get another crack
either as division winner or wild card.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Chavez suggested, he's reached the conclusion that the
home-field advantage (especially for a first-year qualifier such as
the Angels) is almost a disadvantage since "you're playing in front
of 50,000 people at home and there's enormous expectations to win
those first two games. You open on the road and come home with a
split or 2-0, it can take some of the pressure off, but the big thing
is just getting there."</TE>
<TE>   Like the Angels, who began the year 6-14, Chavez had doubts about
the A's. Operating without Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon and Jason
Isringhausen, they trailed by 10 games as late as May 30.</TE>
<TE>   "I questioned myself if we were good enough to come back without
those guys," Chavez said. "We dug a really deep hole, and it's really
gratifying to have dug out of it the way we have.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, we've definitely gone through some adversity, experienced
a lot of highs and lows over the last couple years. There's nothing
we haven't seen, nothing we're not ready for, and we're all really
excited about the next three weeks."</TE>
<TE>   The final three weeks of the regular season could send the A's
and/or Angels into October as division winner and/or wild card. If
you really believe they don't care which, tell it to the Yankees.</TE>

<LD>Sam Snead's record of 81 official PGA Tour victories increased by one
Monday when the tour finally decided to count British Opens won
before 1995.</LD>
<LD>   The change also means Greg Norman, a two-time British Open
champion, can play on the tour as long he likes.</LD>
<LD>   Snead, who won at St. Andrews in 1946, now is credited with 82
wins, nine more than Jack Nicklaus, whose total increases to 73 with
his three British Open titles.</LD>
<TE>   The British Open is golf's oldest championship tournament, dating
to 1860, but the tour did not recognize it as official until 1995.
The change in records will not be effective until the 2003 season.</TE>
<TE>   Norman won 18 times on the tour, but his British Open victories in
1986 and 1993 did not count. With 20 victories, he is eligible for
lifetime membership.</TE>
<TE>   Norman, 47, gave up his membership for 2002 because he'd failed to
play at least 12 events the previous year.</TE>

<TE>   Dallas Stars' owner Tom Hicks has hired a company to explore a

<TE>   Any sale would not affect his ownership of the Texas Rangers, his
major league baseball team.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado left wing Alex Tanguay agreed to a one-year contract.
Financial terms were not disclosed.... Calgary re-signed left wing
Craig Berube and signed Czech defenseman Jan Vodrazka. Details of the
contracts were not announced.... Edmonton re-signed left wing Mike

<TE>   Trainer Bob Baffert, who has won the last six runnings of the Del

closing-day feature Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Baffert horses--none will be coupled in the betting because of
separate ownerships--are Icecoldbeeratreds, Friendly Mike, Bull
Market, Kafwain and Chief Planner.</TE>
<TE>   The other entrants in the Futurity are Total Advantage, Outta Here

<TE>   On Monday, Siberland, ridden by Laffit Pincay, scored a six-length

<HD>Patriots Off to a Good Start</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Defending Super Bowl champions dominate
Steelers in 30-14 rout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FOXBORO, Mass.</DL>
<LD>They opened a new stadium, settled an old score and proved to the
nation that the NFL balance of power hasn't shifted much in the last
seven months.</LD>
<LD>   Can things get any sweeter for the New England Patriots?</LD>
<LD>   "We're the champs," cornerback Ty Law said. "We don't have to
prove anything to anybody."</LD>
<TE>   The defending Super Bowl champions slapped a muzzle on the
Pittsburgh Steelers with a 30-14 victory before a crowd of 68,436 at
Gillette Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The game was anything but a close shave for the Patriots, who
forced five turnovers and scored as many touchdowns on offense
(three) as they did throughout their postseason run. Tom Brady, still
considered a stopgap quarterback by some, threw for 294 yards and
three touchdowns. The Patriots ran the ball only four times in the
first half, and, at one point, Brady threw 25 consecutive passes.</TE>
<TE>   The commanding victory was a big first step for the Patriots,
trying to become only the seventh franchise in NFL history to repeat
as Super Bowl champions. And it was witnessed live by former
President George Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi,
both guests of NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots had the dignitaries; the Steelers just wanted to
escape with their dignity. Pittsburgh came into the game with a full
tank of incentives and hungry to avenge a 24-17 loss to New England
in the last season's AFC championship game. That one really stung,
especially because Pittsburgh's offense outscored and outgained the
Patriots, but the special teams gave up touchdowns on a blocked field
goal and a punt return. Then, in the giddy afterglow of victory,
Patriot players rubbed rock salt in the wounds by strutting.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a reaction of excitement or appreciation," Steeler
linebacker Jason Gildon recently told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
"It was more of a gloating reaction."</TE>
<TE>   Monday, New England players left the chest-thumping to their fans,
who serenaded them with "We Are the Champions" at one point. Before
the game, Patriot owner Bob Kraft stood at a midfield and welcomed
the fans to the new stadium, talking more about the $325-million
venue than recounting the glory of last season.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers, who have lost five of seven season openers, were
locked in a 7-7 game for much of the first half. The turning point
came late in the second quarter when Pittsburgh had a first and goal
at the one--thanks to a pass-interference penalty on Law--then made a
mind-boggling string of mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   First, Pittsburgh was called for a false start and had to move
back to the six. After Stewart was tackled for a one-yard loss and
Plaxico Burress caught a pass in the back of the end zone but
couldn't get both feet inbounds, Amos Zereoue was stopped a yard
short of a touchdown on a third-down screen pass.</TE>
<TE>   Zereoue didn't take too kindly to Lawyer Milloy mouthing off after
making the tackle, so he popped to his feet, shoved the Pro Bowl
safety and was flagged for unnecessary roughness. That gave the
Steelers a fourth and goal from the 16, then they collected another
false start for good measure.</TE>
<TE>   When Todd Peterson's 39-yard field-goal attempt fluttered wide
left, Steeler Coach Bill Cowher stood speechless.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots responded with a drive to set up a 45-yard field goal
by Adam Vinatieri for a 10-7 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   The game was a testament to Patriot preparedness. At training camp
this summer, New England players wore T-shirts that read "Targeting
September," with their first four opponents--the Steelers, Jets,
Chiefs and Chargers--all within a bull's-eye.</TE>
<TE>   And that focus was evident in Brady, who at 24 became the youngest
quarterback to lead his team to a Super Bowl victory.</TE>
<TE>   Other players integral to New England's success are receiver Troy
Brown, who had 101 catches last season, and running back Antowain
Smith, looking for back-to-back 1,000-yard rushing seasons. Brown
caught six passes for 22 yards against the Steelers. Smith gained 60
yards in 17 carries.</TE>

<HD>Injury Could End Conway's Career</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brett Conway's career could be over because of a torn leg muscle.</LD>
<LD>   Conway hurt his leg kicking a field goal in the first half of the
Washington Redskins' 31-23 victory over the Arizona Cardinals on
Sunday. He arrived at Redskins Park on Monday holding a large white
envelope that contained his MRI exam results.</LD>
<LD>   "It shows a lot of tears in it," Conway said. "It's probably the
worst I've seen."</LD>
<TE>   The tears are in the quadriceps muscle, and it's the fourth major
injury in Conway's career. Last month, he was sidelined because of a
hip flexor. At 27, he realizes his career is in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   "The hardest thing is finding out why this keeps happening to me,"
Conway said. "We can't even figure that part out. It's tough. As an
athlete, you never want an injury to force you out of the game. You
want to be able to walk away from the game and retire on your own,
but sometimes that's not the case."</TE>
<TE>   In six NFL seasons, Conway has made 55 of 72 field-goal attempts.
He also is 83 of 84 on extra-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Despite cries from irate fans who want Dwayne Rudd released,
Cleveland Coach Butch Davis said his linebacker has been forgiven for
throwing his helmet and costing the Browns a season-opening victory.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, he's not going to be cut," Davis said. "Guys make
mistakes, and he made one."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee defensive end Jevon Kearse had a screw inserted into his
broken left foot and could return in six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a serious fracture," Titan Coach Jeff Fisher said.
"The screw was placed there just to stabilize it and speed up the
healing process."</TE>
<TE>   The three-time Pro Bowl defensive end has never missed an NFL
start in his first three seasons, a stretch that reached 49 games
Sunday. He has had 36 sacks, which trails only Michael Strahan of the
New York Giants (37) during the last three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati quarterback Gus Frerotte had the thumb on his passing
hand tightly wrapped a day after he was knocked around in the
Cincinnati Bengals' 34-6 loss to San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Frerotte slightly sprained the thumb during a third-quarter sack,
one of four by the Chargers. He finished the game, and the thumb
swelled overnight.</TE>
<TE>   He expects to be able to play against the Browns in Cleveland on
Sunday. If the thumb is too sore, Jon Kitna would be next in line to
play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota tight end Byron Chamberlain has a strained left knee
that could sideline him for a few weeks.... Oakland running back Zack
Crockett has been cleared by team doctors to play at Pittsburgh on
Sunday after injuring his neck against Seattle.</TE>

<HD>Braves Win Division for 11th Straight Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Mets didn't give the Atlanta Braves a chance to
celebrate another division title on the field.</LD>
<LD>   The Braves clinched their 11th consecutive division championship
when the Mets beat the Phillies, 6-4, Monday night at Philadelphia
behind Mike Piazza's grand slam.</LD>
<LD>   Philadelphia's loss wrapped up the National League East for the
Braves, who didn't play Monday. The second-place Phillies are a
staggering 21 games behind Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   The Braves became the first team this season to secure a
postseason berth, and they did it earlier than any team in Atlanta
history. The 1975 Cincinnati Reds have the earliest clinching since
divisional play began in '69, wrapping up the NL West on Sept. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Piazza went deep in a six-run seventh inning as the Mets set a
season high with their seventh consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as good a roll as we've been on," Manager Bobby Valentine
said. "Hopefully, we can keep it going."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 5, San Diego 2--On the eve of his 39th birthday, Randy
Johnson reached 300 strikeouts for the fifth consecutive season and
earned his 21st victory at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson already held the major league record of four consecutive
300-strikeout seasons. He has six 300-strikeout seasons overall,
tying the major league mark held by Nolan Ryan.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (21-5) scattered eight hits and walked three in seven
innings. The lone run he allowed came on Ron Gant's homer leading off
the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 3, Milwaukee 0--Woody Williams and four relievers
combined on a five-hitter at Milwaukee as the Cardinals won their
sixth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   In his second major league start, Ben Diggins (0-2) gave up three
runs, six hits and two walks in seven innings. He struck out seven.</TE>
<TE>   Diggins was the Dodgers' first-round draft choice in 2000 and was
traded to Milwaukee on July 23 in the deal that sent Tyler Houston to
the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 6, Colorado 5--Mark Loretta's 10th-inning single drove in
Craig Biggio with the winning run at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Biggio led off with a walk and moved to second on a single by
Lance Berkman. Jeff Bagwell's fly-ball out moved Biggio to third, and
Loretta then lined a hit through the left side.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 9, Pittsburgh 8--Jose Guillen hit a grand slam and
drove in five runs for the Reds at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   The announced attendance of 13,434 was Cincinnati's smallest home
crowd of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 3, Montreal 2--Alex Gonzalez homered in the bottom of the
ninth inning for his third game-winning shot at Wrigley Field this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this season, Gonzalez hit game-winning homers against St.
Louis and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The New York Mets acquired outfielder Brady Clark from Cincinnati
to complete last month's trade that sent left-hander Shawn Estes to
the Reds.... Phillies' pitcher David Coggin will have arthroscopic
surgery on his right shoulder next Monday, ending his season.</TE>

<HD>Second-Hand Smoke</HD>
<DH>Thirty years have done little to cool the still-smoldering
U.S.-Soviet Olympic basketball controversy, and American players are
still doing a slow burn about the chaotic ending to the gold-medal
game in Munich</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Thirty years later, Ivan Edeshko buries his face in his hands and
groans: "Oh no." Not another question about those three seconds.</LD>
<LD>   "All my life was three seconds," he says. "All my life."</LD>
<LD>   The memory should be cause for joy. With three seconds left in the
gold-medal basketball game at the 1972 Summer Olympic Games, Edeshko
lofted an inbounds pass the length of the court, into the hands of
teammate Aleksandr Belov, who scored to give the Soviet Union a
stunning victory over the United States.</LD>
<TE>   In that glimmer of a moment, the Americans lost for the first time
in Olympic history and the Soviets truly arrived as a basketball
power.</TE>
<TE>   But the 51-50 victory still ranks among the most controversial
finishes in international sport, with coaches charging onto the court
and officials arguing, with the Americans celebrating an apparent
victory only to have three seconds put back on the clock, giving
Edeshko a chance to throw his pass.</TE>
<TE>   To cloud matters further, the game was played against a tragic
backdrop, the murder of 11 Israeli team members by Palestinian
terrorists in the Olympic village days earlier. The Cold War played a
role too, capitalism versus communism, the basketball arena
transformed into political arena.</TE>
<TE>   So the questions Edeshko has faced for three decades have not
always been pleasant, the comments not always congratulatory. It is
enough to ruin an otherwise pleasant afternoon of sipping beer at a
sidewalk cafe in Indianapolis where he was serving as assistant coach
of the Russian team at the World Basketball Championship last week.</TE>
<TE>   The way he sees it, there are two versions of what happened: the
American version and the truth. If he were back home, he could better
respond.</TE>
<TE>   "People ask me questions," he says. "I give them a videotape of
the game."</TE>
<TE>   The Letter</TE>
<TE>   Speaking by telephone from his office in Landover, Md., Tom
McMillen talks about a packet of newspaper articles he has collected.
Munich was far more shocking than the losses suffered last week by
the U.S. team at the championship in Indianapolis. All these years
later, he says, people are still writing about the injustice.</TE>
<TE>   With three seconds left, McMillen was the American player assigned
to cover the inbounds pass, standing eye-to-eye with Edeshko. Exactly
how far apart they stood is a matter of contention, but more on that
later. For now, suffice to say McMillen is seeking redress.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have a case," he says. "And I think it's worth
exploring."</TE>
<TE>   His feelings might be even stronger than in 1972, his interest
piqued by the case of the Canadian pairs skaters who finished second
to a Russian duo at the Salt Lake City Olympics last winter.</TE>
<TE>   After that questionable finish, a French judge said she had been
"pressured" to vote for the Russians. The International Olympic
Committee then agreed to award duplicate gold medals to the
Canadians, and McMillen took note of a comment by IOC President
Jacques Rogge.</TE>
<TE>   A sailor for the Belgian Olympic team in 1972, Rogge was on hand
for the basketball controversy. The skating incident, he said, "was
peanuts compared to that."</TE>
<TE>   "If you read between the lines, you know what he is saying,"
McMillen says. "Our game was worse than what happened to the Canadian
skaters."</TE>
<TE>   Having served as a Maryland congressman after his playing days,
McMillen decided to take action. He conferred with his former
teammates, then wrote a letter to Rogge asking that their game be
officially revisited.</TE>
<TE>   To this day, the silver medals awarded to the U.S. remain in a
Swiss vault. McMillen and his teammates refused to accept them in
1972 and have likewise declined when the IOC periodically has asked
them to reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not militants or anything," says Ed Ratleff, a guard on the
team. "We feel we got the gold taken away from us."</TE>
<TE>   McMillen says, "There are a lot of factors that keep circling
around this game."</TE>
<TE>   The Game</TE>
<TE>   Circling like buzzards. Thirty years later, people still pick over
the carcass, squabbling over bits and pieces, scrutinizing events
that took place even before the Games began.</TE>
<TE>   Top collegians such as Bill Walton and David Thompson had declined
to play in Munich, so America's hopes rested on a young squad
featuring McMillen and Ratleff, Dwight Jones and Doug Collins, Jim
Brewer and Bobby Jones. There was debate over the man chosen as
coach, the aging and conservative Hank Iba.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the wrong coach," says Ratleff, an All-American from Long
Beach State. "They brought in a bunch of thin, fast guys. You're
talking about guys who loved to score, who never passed up shots in
college, but he made us slow it down and make all these passes."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Soviets brought a veteran team that had been slowly
but surely closing the talent gap on the once-untouchable Americans.</TE>
<TE>   In the championship game in Munich, a game in which both teams
looked nervous and awkward, the Soviets took control and led by eight
points with five minutes left. Only then did Iba loosen the reins.</TE>
<TE>   Don Haskins, an assistant coach, insists this was planned.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Iba told me all summer long that the Russians would choke at
the end," says Haskins, the former Texas El Paso coach. "And that's
when we started to press."</TE>
<TE>   Facing full-court pressure, the Soviets began forcing shots and
turning the ball over. Their lead was only 49-48 with six seconds
left when Belov, trapped against the baseline, threw an ill-advised
pass. Collins intercepted and, racing for a layup, was undercut by
Zurab Sakandelidze. Though dazed, Collins made both free throws to
give his team a 50-49 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Three seconds remained.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the action proceeded in fits and starts, almost
dreamlike. As the Soviets inbounded the ball, assistant coach Sergei
Bashkin charged onto the floor screaming that his team had asked for
a timeout, causing referee Renato Righetto of Brazil to stop play.
One second showed on the clock.</TE>
<TE>   After much confusion and arguing, the Soviets were awarded their
timeout. When play resumed, they failed to score, the horn sounded
and the Americans celebrated. But the game wasn't over.</TE>
<TE>   The public address announcer told a startled arena that three
seconds were being put on the clock. More chaos ensued, people
shouting in various languages around the scorer's table. Haskins
wanted to end matters by pulling the U.S. team off the floor but Iba,
looking red-faced and confused, was concerned about a potential
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to lose this game later tonight, sitting on my
butt," he told Haskins.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, officials cleared the floor and reset the clock, giving
the Soviets a third inbounds pass. Edeshko threw to Belov, who
outjumped two defenders and laid the ball in the basket.</TE>
<TE>   The American Version</TE>
<TE>   Where to begin?</TE>
<TE>   Even before the controversy, the Americans were angry because
their top scorer, Dwight Jones, was ejected along with Soviet player
Mishako Korkia for fighting. They have since suggested Korkia, far
less valuable to his team, started the scuffle intentionally.</TE>
<TE>   But that complaint pales in comparison to issues raised in the
final moments.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, Ratleff wants to know why Bashkin, the Soviet
assistant, was not given a technical foul for stepping on court
during play. Then he wants to know why officials made a big deal
about the Soviet timeout.</TE>
<TE>   "If a coach calls timeout and it's missed, it's just missed," he
says. "It happens all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Haskins and Brewer insist that when the horn blew after the
Soviets' "second" chance, the game should have ended. McMillen has
qualms with the way the "third" chance was handled.</TE>
<TE>   As Edeshko prepared to throw his pass, referee Artenik Arabadjian
of Bulgaria made several gestures, first pointing toward McMillen,
then toward the end line. McMillen says Arabadjian told him to back
away.</TE>
<TE>   No rule required the defender to back away, but McMillen recalled
something Iba had told the team before the Olympics. The rest of the
basketball world is out to get us, the coach said, so don't expect a
fair shake.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent HBO documentary, Arabadjian denied telling McMillen to
back off. But the player, mindful of his coach's warning, drifted
toward the free-throw line, giving Edeshko a clear view of the court.</TE>
<TE>   "We were conscious the game could be won by hook or crook,"
McMillen says. "I was afraid of a technical being called on me."</TE>
<TE>   Once the pass was thrown, several American players insist that
Belov illegally pushed away from defenders Jim Forbes and Kevin
Joyce.</TE>
<TE>   Even more troubling to McMillen was something that happened off
the court. There would be no controversy, he says, if not for the
late R. William Jones, secretary general of the International Amateur
Basketball Federation (FIBA).</TE>
<TE>   Jones was known for running his federation with an iron fist.
Sometime around the "second" chance, he came out of the stands and
instructed officials to put three seconds on the clock. In an
interview a few years before his death, Jones insisted his decision
was correct, but admitted he had no authority to intervene.</TE>
<TE>   McMillen draws an analogy: Imagine if NBA Commissioner David Stern
had run down to the court and told referees what to do during a
controversial playoff game between the Lakers and Sacramento Kings
last May. "David Stern just doesn't come out of the stands," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' actions now form the crux of McMillen's appeal to the IOC.</TE>
<TE>   After the skating incident in Salt Lake City, Rogge was asked if
awarding duplicate gold medals to the Canadian skaters might lead to
revisiting previous Olympic controversies. Rogge said the IOC acted
only because the French judge initially claimed to have been
pressured.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC would not reconsider past officiating errors, Rogge said,
only cases in which there appeared to be "manipulation of the
judgment."</TE>
<TE>   In his letter to the IOC, McMillen cited "a blatant abuse of
authority by Dr. Jones" as evidence of such manipulation. He also
referred to the American protest after the game, which a FIBA panel
denied, 3-2, the dissenting votes cast by representatives from
Communist bloc countries.</TE>
<TE>   "If the referees had made a bad judgment call, there would be no
case," he says. "But, clearly, our game was victimized by
manipulation."</TE>
<TE>   Another Viewpoint</TE>
<TE>   In the folklore of American sport, there is no question about what
transpired. Ratleff explains: "We're not the team that got beat,
we're the team that got cheated."</TE>
<TE>   As a lifelong basketball fan, Robert Edelman says he would like to
agree. But as a professor of Russian history at UC San Diego, he
takes a clinical approach. "The thing that bothers me as a historian
is this idea of the United States being cheated has lived on and has
never been challenged with any kind of research," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in the den of his Solana Beach home, playing and replaying
videotape of the game, Edelman believes the American case is not so
clear-cut.</TE>
<TE>   First he deals with the fight that got Dwight Jones ejected. Some
Americans have claimed Korkia was a benchwarmer sent in to provoke
Jones. In fact, Korkia was a starter and the videotape appears to
show Jones swinging the first elbow as the players grappled for a
rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Then comes the matter of the final seconds.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the 1972 Olympics, coaches called timeouts by
pushing a button on the sideline. Soviet Coach Vladimir Kondrashin
has maintained that he pushed the button after Collins was fouled,
intending to huddle with his team between free throws.</TE>
<TE>   But it appears that officials at the scorer's table became
confused. They either forgot to award the timeout, thought Kondrashin
had changed his mind or simply neglected to inform the referees.</TE>
<TE>   On the videotape, a horn sounds just before Collins releases his
second free throw and one of the referees looks toward the sideline,
all of which suggests that someone at the scorer's table wanted to
rectify the error. Before that could happen, Collins' shot swished
through the net and the Russians quickly inbounded the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Only a second remained on the clock when Bashkin got to the
scorer's table and the game was stopped. Then Jones got involved and
can be seen holding up three fingers.</TE>
<TE>   But when the Soviets got their "second" chance, the scoreboard
clock showed 50 seconds. And the horn that sounded on the second
inbounds, the one that sent the Americans into a joyous frenzy,
seemed to come too quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The timing suggests that, once again, the scorer's table was
trying to stop the game to correct a mistake. Thus the "third" try.</TE>
<TE>   And nothing on the videotape suggests Belov fouled his defenders.</TE>
<TE>   "It was obviously a poorly supervised game," Edelman says. "But I
don't think it happened the way many people remember it."</TE>
<TE>   The Aftermath</TE>
<TE>   In one respect, the outcome of a basketball game--even a
gold-medal game between superpowers--could not have mattered less.
The death of 11 Israelis made sport seem trifling.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the guys were pretty overwhelmed," McMillen recalls.
"There were a lot of us who thought the Games should have been
canceled."</TE>
<TE>   But the late Avery Brundage, then president of the IOC, decided
otherwise and, somehow, athletes and fans found a way to care about
the championship game that started late Sept. 9 and stretched into
the early morning hours of the next day. What transpired--the first
U.S. defeat, the confused ending, the Cold War implications--remains
among the strongest memories of the unusually memorable Munich Games.</TE>
<TE>   "When something happens that is a lie, that is not on the
up-and-up, it doesn't go away," says Brewer, now a Toronto Raptor
assistant coach. "If it was an honest mistake, people could accept
that. But the way it happened, politics entered onto the court."</TE>
<TE>   That is why McMillen launched his appeal. With no response from
the IOC yet, he plans to ask American politicians to join in support
of his effort.</TE>
<TE>   The Soviet players--who held a reunion this week to celebrate the
anniversary of their victory--are angry too. They took it as a slap
in the face, a lack of respect, when the Americans refused to join
them on the medal stand. They still see the Americans as sore losers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it rankles even more now," Edelman says. "I mean, the
Americans won the Cold War. But they won't recognize this one Soviet
victory."</TE>
<TE>   That is why Edeshko hates to hear these questions and would rather
answer them by handing over a videotape. Still, he understands why
questions keep popping up. Like his American counterparts, he knows
the memories will not die.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first time the Americans lost and everyone remembers
the first time," he says. "It was a time of Cold War, the Soviet
Union against the USA, and sport was political."</TE>
<TE>   So on a sunny afternoon he takes another sip of beer, lights a
cigarette and talks a while longer.</TE>
<TE>   "Thirty years from now, I will still speak about it," he says.
"It's history."</TE>

<LD>The happy music of baseball's lavender confines was drowned out
Monday by the hard snap of leather.</LD>
<LD>   So this is what a pennant race sounds like.</LD>
<LD>   Sixth inning, two out, tying run on third base, the Angels' Scott
Spiezio shoots a hard bouncer down the first-base line.</LD>
<TE>   Scott Hatteberg dives to his left and snares the ball with a
popping sound heard all the way to Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio slumps. The Athletics leap.</TE>
<TE>   Seventh inning, none out, tying run on first base, Brad Fullmer
hits a hard bouncer up the middle.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Tejada makes a running stab and flips the ball behind him
while hopping like a ballerina. Mark Ellis catches it on second base
and, pirouetting like a member of the same dance company, flips it to
first.</TE>
<TE>   Double play, the Angels are exasperated, and there's still more.</TE>
<TE>   Eighth inning, two out, tying run on first base, it's Chone
Figgins, fastest guy on the field, two-for-two in stolen bases since
joining the team and....</TE>
<TE>   Do we really need to finish this?</TE>
<TE>   OK, so left-hander Ricardo Rincon holds him close to first, then
Ramon Hernandez throws him out trying to steal second, the inning is
over, and now everybody knows.</TE>
<TE>   This is what a pennant race sounds like. This is what it feels
like. This is how it is won.</TE>
<TE>   This is what the Angels, who lost to the Athletics, 2-1, in the
first of a four-game showdown here, must match.</TE>
<TE>   With 19 games remaining and the Seattle Mariners imploding at
every turn, the Angels' four-game lead in the wild-card race feels
like 14.</TE>
<TE>   But after Monday, their three-game deficit in the AL West title
race feels like 30.</TE>
<TE>   It's no big deal in what order the top two teams finish, unless
you think a first-round playoff series against the Minnesota Twins
would be easier than a first-round series against the New York
Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   So, of course, it's a very big deal.</TE>
<TE>   But, answering questions about whether they would lose inspiration
after their 20-game win streak ended, the Athletics are the real
deal.</TE>
<TE>   "In low-scoring games, you have to make all the plays," Manager
Art Howe said. "We did that tonight ... and made a few that most
teams would not."</TE>
<TE>   Already distanced from the 10-game win streak fashioned against
Baltimore and Tampa Bay, the Angels have officially been reminded
that this is not going to be easy.</TE>
<TE>   They have also been reminded that this time of year is different.</TE>
<TE>   On a warm Monday that still felt like autumn, beach balls at
Edison Field were mostly ignored.</TE>
<TE>   The 28,145 fans were so jazzed, at one point they gave a standing
ovation to a third-out fly ball that was still in the air.</TE>
<TE>   The rally monkey showed up, but most people were too busy staring
at the hopping fastballs of Oakland's Tim Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   It was fun. And, for the Angels, awfully frustrating.</TE>
<TE>   They felt it at the beginning of the game, when Tejada made a
bare-handed running grab of Darin Erstad's grounder, barely throwing
him out.</TE>
<TE>   They felt it at the end, when, adding one more fielding gem to the
display, Terrence Long made a running catch of Erstad's ninth-inning
line drive.</TE>
<TE>   These guys are good.</TE>
<TE>   These guys are experienced.</TE>
<TE>   Heading for their third consecutive postseason, they're not going
to panic.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I think that means something," said Howe. "Until you
actually experience something in this game, you never know how you're
going to react."</TE>
<TE>   For most of the game, the Angels reacted well.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson didn't allow an Angel ball to leave the infield in the
first three innings, but they didn't try to force their swings.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Appier made two early two mistakes, both turned into home
runs by Jermaine Dye and Long, but he also recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Garret Anderson, as he has done all season, calmly brought the
Angels closer with a soaring shot into the right-field stands in the
fifth inning.</TE>
<TE>   And when the Angels could have crumbled, they didn't.</TE>
<TE>   The A's loaded the bases with none out in the top of sixth inning
on two Appier walks and a blooper. The veteran Appier, who threw
seven consecutive balls at one point, was loudly cursing. The
infielders were restless.</TE>
<TE>   And then Appier found something, striking out Dye on three
pitches, striking out David Justice on five pitches, fooling Ellis
into a fly ball on three pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Those are the sorts of moments that usually win games.</TE>
<TE>   This one did not.</TE>
<TE>   There will be questions about Mike Scioscia's decision to bat
Shawn Wooten for hot-hitting Adam Kennedy with Figgins on first base
in the eighth inning, especially after Wooten struck out.</TE>
<TE>   Rincon had just come into the game, and Kennedy rarely bats
against left-handers, so it wasn't anything new, but still....</TE>
<TE>   "Rincon had just been really tough on lefties," explained
Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   On this night, though, those sorts of questions were lost in the
deep Athletic gloves.</TE>
<TE>   This was not about one moment. This was about a bunch of them,
loud and leathery and potentially lasting.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank Shorter won a gold medal at the Munich Olympics. The rest of
the U.S. took it from there.</LD>
<LD>   In becoming the first American to win the Olympic marathon since
1908, Shorter sparked a fitness craze that spawned a stream of
successful U.S. marathon runners.</LD>
<LD>   Shorter's victory in 1972 by nearly 2 1/2 minutes led to people of
all professions pounding the pavement at 6 a.m., jogging in small
packs or individually on the sides of city streets and rural roads.</LD>
<TE>   Shorter, who won the silver medal four years later in Montreal,
also boosted the image of sneakers and jogging outfits as fashionable
wear: Wardrobes that had been confined to gyms and health clubs
became commonplace, men and women dining in chic Beverly Hills
restaurants in trendy athletic gear.</TE>
<TE>   Those who emerged from the U.S. running boom included Bill
Rodgers, a four-time winner of both the Boston and New York
marathons, and Alberto Salazar, a three-time winner at New York.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. success in distance running didn't last: A U.S.-born man
hasn't won a major marathon since Greg Meyer won Boston in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Shorter, now 54 and living in Boulder, Colo., has openly
criticized the dearth of talented U.S. distance runners and has
blamed, among other things, the prevalence of shorter road races with
big payouts.</TE>
<TE>   "When prize money came into the picture, unfortunately, Americans
decided to fund pension plans rather than focus on the gold," he said
in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Shorter has been instrumental in the fight
against performance-enhancing drugs as chairman of the U.S.
Anti-Doping Agency, an independent agency created in October 2000 to
police U.S. Olympic sports.</TE>
<TE>   At a Senate subcommittee hearing in June, Shorter discussed his
second-place finish to East Germany's Waldemar Cierpinski at the
Montreal Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, I knew that it would be absolutely possible to
increase my chances of beating the East Germans and others who were
using steroids if I cheated by doping," Shorter said. "To me, that is
not what sport is about. I didn't cheat and I finished second."</TE>

<LD>Every time there is an NFL report involving Los Angeles, I'm reminded
of one of my all-time favorite movies, "A Thousand Clowns."</LD>
<LD>   The Jason Robards comedy classic has nothing to do with the NFL,
but the name of the movie pretty well describes the number of NFL
decision-makers and league owners who have their eye on L.A.</LD>
<LD>   The latest report has Jim Irsay, son of Mayflower Bob who moved
the Colts in the middle of the night from Baltimore to Indianapolis,
interested in beating the Spanos Goofs to Los Angeles. Sounds like
Taz taking on Black Ruby in another dumb mule race.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE TIMES reported months ago that Irsay told other NFL owners he
was interested in moving here. I'm surprised everyone living in
Indianapolis isn't interested in moving here.</TE>
<TE>   Reporter Chris Mortensen, tops in the TV game when it comes to the
NFL, went one step further on ESPN Sunday and reported the Colts are
on "a faster track to L.A. than people realize," and could be playing
here next year.</TE>
<TE>   Couple that with the Rose Bowl's recent announcement that NFL
moving specialist John Moag has been hired to bring a team here, and
isn't that interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis officials quickly dismissed most of Mortensen's
report, and insist the team is bound by a lease and cannot move for
several more years. Mort also failed to cover the second half of the
story: Who builds a new playpen for Irsay and the Colts in the L.A.
area?</TE>
<TE>   Irsay, however, is on the prowl for more money with the Colts
selling only 36,000 season tickets to watch Peyton Manning and
Edgerrin James, and the team ranks at the bottom of the NFL in
overall revenue. He told the Indianapolis Star that a new stadium in
Indy "doesn't necessarily solve our problems," making it obvious he
doesn't think Indianapolis has enough rich (corporate) fans to pay
for the premium seats and luxury suites in a new stadium.</TE>
<TE>   What does this mean for L.A. fans? Hold onto your wallets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW FOR some reason L.A. attracts the clowns. I refer you to Al
Davis sans the grease paint, and Georgia Frontiere sans the pancake
makeup--yikes. After those two left, the Seahawks' bozo owner Ken
Behring tried moving his team into Rams Park before being sent back
to Seattle, where he was forced to sell the team.</TE>
<TE>   So far Arizona Cardinal owner Bill Bidwill has taken the hint and
not tried to run the concrete barriers at the border, but here we go
again.</TE>
<TE>   The Spanos Goofs have already taken steps to worm their way into
your affections, striking a deal to conduct training camp in Carson
next summer. You have to figure any team that's willing to spend its
summer in Carson ranks right up there with the 300 Spartans. Now the
Colts are warming up the Mayflower.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Brees and LaDainian Tomlinson or Manning and James?
Interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Irsay or the Spanos Goofs? Depressing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TOM &amp; Aida, our neighbors, have sold their home, but refused to
inform the buyer who lives next door. I wonder if Irsay has bought a
home in California yet?</TE>

<TE>   I TOLD Garret Anderson he was having an MVP season before Monday
night's game with Oakland, and got the same kind of disinterested
response I usually get from him. I prodded him for a response, and he
said, "That's funny after some of the things that have been said
around here about me."</TE>
<TE>   I thought all Disney employees were supposed to report to work
with a smile on their face. But then he went out, hit a homer and
singled sharply to right, and I hope they vote him MVP, just so he
has to act happy while receiving the award.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AFTER THE Texans won their first game, a sports columnist for the
Houston Chronicle wrote: "The Texans came out like old-time
gunslingers, their six-shooters blazing, and served notice there was
a new marshal in town."</TE>
<TE>   Just think, if we had gotten the team instead of Houston, I could
have written like that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOW 'BOUT them Cowboys?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AFTER RAM Coach Mike Martz irritated the local media by closing
practices and then losing to the Broncos, a sports columnist for the
St. Louis Post Dispatch wrote: "Brilliant decision to close
practices, Mike Martz. Now we know why you banned the media: you
didn't want us to see that you and the players were unprepared to
open the season. Hey, at least we know what the Rams were working on
all week during their clandestine, closed-door, top-secret practices:
Sleepwalking."</TE>
<TE>   Just think, if the Rams hadn't moved, I could have written like
that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE LAST time a Trojan returned a kickoff for a touchdown, Chad
Morton was carrying the ball 98 yards in the Coliseum, making Paul
Hackett a winner in his first game as USC's coach. On Sunday, Morton,
now with the Jets, became the first player in NFL history to return a
kickoff for a touchdown during both regulation and overtime play.
Hackett is now an assistant coach with the Jets.</TE>

<HD>Ecuadorean Referee's Job on the Line</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Italian soccer fans certainly remember Byron Moreno.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the Ecuadorean referee is under fire in his own country.</LD>
<LD>   Ecuador's most popular club, Barcelona, on Monday demanded the
permanent suspension of Moreno after he added 12 minutes of injury
time during a 4-3 weekend loss to Liga de Quito.</LD>
<TE>   Barcelona led, 3-2, after 90 minutes when the fourth official
indicated six minutes of injury time, a total Moreno ended up
doubling.</TE>
<TE>   Liga scored in the 99th and 100th minutes to win.</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona President Leonardo Bohrer said the club would ask for
Moreno to be removed from the referees' list for "openly prejudicing
us with bad intent."</TE>
<TE>   In June, Italians were furious when Moreno red-carded Italy
striker Francesco Totti for diving and disallowed what would have
been a game-winning goal by Damiano Tommasi in a 2-1 loss to South
Korea in a round-of-16 World Cup match.</TE>
<TE>   Gascoigne to Sign?</TE>
<TE>   The Football Kingz, New Zealand's only professional soccer team,
has denied an agent's claim that they are close to signing former
England international Paul Gascoigne.</TE>
<TE>   Ian Elliott, British-based agent for Gascoigne, 35, said the
player was ready to accept a short-term contract with the Kingz who
play in the Australian Premier League.</TE>
<TE>   But Kingz chief executive Chris Turner has denied his
cash-strapped club has had any dealings with Gascoigne, who in July
had a five-day tryout with D.C. United of Major League Soccer but
wasn't offered a contract.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not signed and are not signing Paul Gascoigne," Turner
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis Now Eligible</TE>
<TE>   U.S. World Cup player Eddie Lewis was granted a work permit in
England and can now play for his first-division club, Preston North
End.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the English government denied Lewis' application
because he had not played in at least 75% of U.S. national team games
in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, who played for Fulham in the Premier League last season,
could play his first match for Preston on Wednesday against
Scunthorpe in the Worthington Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Major Injuries</TE>
<TE>   A weekend of qualifying matches for the 2004 European Championship
and the African Nations Cup have left some key European-based players
injured and sidelined for extended periods of time.</TE>
<TE>   The most serious was a right knee injury to midfielder Otto Addo
of Ghana, which will keep him out at least six months. Making matters
worse was that Uganda stunned Ghana, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Addo, who plays for Borussia Dortmund of the German Bundesliga,
will travel to Colorado to undergo surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Dutch international Rafael van der Vaart, a 19-year-old striker
for Ajax of Amsterdam, tore a ligament in his left knee during the
Netherlands' 3-0 victory over Belarus and is expected to be out six
to eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   MLS Wins Arbitration</TE>
<TE>   MLS won an arbitration case against three players who claimed they
had been improperly released earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Arbitrator Richard Bloch sided with the league, which said it
acted properly in ending the contracts of Ian Bishop, Danny Pena and
Johnny Torres, who were not selected in January's dispersal draft
after the Miami Fusion and Tampa Bay Mutiny were folded.</TE>
<TE>   Champions Final Set</TE>
<TE>   Mexican clubs Morelia and Pachuca will play the final of the 2002
CONCACAF Champions Cup on Sept. 18 at Estadio Azul in Mexico City.
The final was originally scheduled to be a home-and-home series, but
both clubs requested to play only one game.</TE>
<TE>   Chastain's Mother Dies</TE>
<TE>   The mother of Brandi Chastain, a star of the U.S. women's national
team, has died. Lark Chastain, 56, died in her sleep Friday at her
San Jose home. The cause of death was not immediately known.</TE>

<HD>Russian Arrival</HD>
<DH>Football helps fulfill dreams of immigrants</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Take away the 20 letters that make up Vladimir Paniouchkine's name,
and there's no way someone would identify him as Russian.</LD>
<LD>   He's captain of the Glendale High football team, earned
straight-A's on his last report card, receives college letters from
Harvard and Yale and has no trace of a Russian accent.</LD>
<LD>   Phil Gella is the starting strong safety at Los Angeles Loyola
High, has a 4.2 grade-point average, scored 1,260 on the SAT, lives
in Marina del Rey and loves surfing, skateboarding and rock climbing.
He, too, is a Russian immigrant.</LD>
<TE>   At Reseda High, Artem Shatokhin sticks out like a matryoshka doll
on a coffee table. He is 6 feet 2, 290 pounds, with closely cut dark
hair and a Russian accent straight out of a John le Carre novel.</TE>
<TE>   He starts at defensive tackle, made the honor roll last year and
wants to become a lawyer, cartoonist or professional football player.</TE>
<TE>   All three arrived in America speaking no English, having no
friends and wondering if their parents' dream of "giving them a
better life" could be fulfilled here.</TE>
<TE>   Each encountered language barriers, moments of distrust and
financial burdens. But in Southern California, where more than 140
languages are spoken, these three teenagers embraced parts of
American life that allowed them to flourish in school and sports.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paniouchkine was born on New Year's Day 1985 in Riga, Latvia, a
city of 900,000 on the Baltic Coast. Latvia was occupied by the
Soviet Union in 1940 and declared its independence in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Paniouchkine was too young to understand the disappearance of his
father when he was 5. Vladimir Paniouchkine Sr. was a major in the
Soviet Army with a specialty in electronic engineering. He served as
a special advisor to the defense ministry for the Republic of Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Wanting more opportunities for his family, he fled to Hamburg,
Germany, leaving behind his wife and three sons.</TE>
<TE>   "A KGB officer [was] in my house for two months because they were
looking for me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several months later, his family was able to join him, and they
lived in Hamburg for five years before moving to Twin Falls, Idaho,
when Vladimir Jr. was 11.</TE>
<TE>   So began Paniouchkine's American experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in awe to see all the material things Americans had," he
said. "I never had a bike and one day my parents went out and bought
me and my brother a bike and we rode it for hours on one street. I
was amazed at what choices there were."</TE>
<TE>   Conquering the language barrier was Paniouchkine's first priority,
and cartoons became his favorite way to learn words and phrases.</TE>
<TE>   "I think TV is great," he said. "When people say, 'Don't watch
TV,' I'm like, 'My kids will watch TV,' because I picked up so much
from TV. I love cartoons. It taught me English."</TE>
<TE>   As his communication with classmates improved, so did his self
confidence. But it was football that sent him on an odyssey of
discovery and adventure.</TE>
<TE>   "In my seventh-grade class, I used to be kind of a punk, a bully,
because I didn't know anybody," he said. "They'd push me around and
I'd bully them back. I really didn't like this one kid playing
handball. I slammed him into a wall and my P.E. teacher was like, 'Go
take that onto the field.' I thought about it and went out for
football."</TE>
<TE>   At Glendale High, he's a 6-foot, 221-pound senior tailback and
defensive end who bench presses 315 pounds and loves "the hitting,
the touchdowns, the glory."</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of sending letters for college, I have letters being sent
to me," he said. "Harvard sent me some letters and my mom was jumping
up and down clapping her hands."</TE>
<TE>   The family moved to Glendale two years ago to expand a trucking
business that has grown to eight trucks. They live in a two-bedroom
house.</TE>
<TE>   Vladimir Sr. said he brought his family here to experience
freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody watching me, nobody behind me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, if only his son could explain the rules of football to his
father.</TE>
<TE>   "I ask him, 'Explain how it works,' " the elder Paniouchkine said.
"I don't understand completely. I understand touchdowns and move the
chains."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   According to the 1990 census, there were 195,570 people of Russian
ancestry living in Los Angeles County. Those numbers have more than
doubled since the breakup of the former Soviet Union a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Shatokhin left his home in Kharkov, Ukraine, a
city of 2.5 million, drove with his parents to Kiev, boarded a plane
to Paris, then another to New York and ended up in a one-bedroom
apartment in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   In Ukraine, his father worked in a factory and his mother cleaned
streets. They wanted their only child to gain educational
opportunities in America. Shatokhin enrolled in Reseda High's police
academy magnet program, enabling him to study law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Shatokhin said if he were still in Ukraine, he wouldn't be
learning how to put away criminals.</TE>
<TE>   "If I would be there right now, I'm sure I'd be a gangster," he
said. "The only thing you get money from is the mafia."</TE>
<TE>   His father now drives a transportation van and his mother works
for a technical institute. They expect their son to go to college,
and football could be a way for him to earn a scholarship. He started
on varsity as a sophomore last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how to say it, but it's a very interesting game," he
said. "You have to be mentally and physically prepared."</TE>
<TE>   Shatokhin arrived proficient in math, having taken geometry as a
seventh-grader in Ukraine, but his lack of English was an obstacle.</TE>
<TE>   "In school, I didn't understand anything," he said. "I was trying
to listen to the teacher and listen to people sitting next to me and
listen to my friends at lunch. I was listening, listening, listening,
then working on my pronunciations."</TE>
<TE>   Shatokhin's grade-point average as a freshman was 3.8, but it
dropped last school year because he admitted to getting lazy and
missed classes after taking a trip to Ukraine to visit his
grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   Whether drawing, working on computers or hanging out with friends,
Shatokhin feels comfortable and confident.</TE>
<TE>   Football has given him added incentive.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to play every day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And he's searching for size 15 in-line skates, which may be the
strongest sign yet that Southern California has become his new home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Elena Gella decided to start a new life with her only child. She
concluded they no longer could stay in Vladivostok, a city of 700,000
near the Chinese border and home to the Russian naval fleet. There
were too many bad memories of the death of her husband. An officer
for a commercial shipping company, he died because of an accident
when Phil was 7.</TE>
<TE>   "It still hurts," Elena said. "It was very difficult for us to
live there emotionally."</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, they sold their apartment, packed their most
valuable belongings, boarded a plane to Seoul, flew to Atlanta and
ended up in Knoxville, Tenn. Soon they moved to Bakersfield, then
Marina del Rey, where they live in a one-bedroom apartment. Elena is
the sole provider, earning money by working with computers.</TE>
<TE>   "The family we have is two people and a cat," Gella said. "We both
knew we would fight through it and survive. There was no turning
back. We were very determined."</TE>
<TE>   Gella brought his favorite toys, a box of Legos and some stuffed
animals. His mother packed a collection of books from "great Russian
authors" such as Pushkin, Dostoevsky and Tolstoy that she hoped her
son would read one day. It didn't take long before Gella picked up
American habits.</TE>
<TE>   "In Russia, we had a little neighborhood with three or four big
apartment buildings," he said. "In the middle, all the kids played
outside every day. In the U.S., very few kids play outside. They
usually watch TV. I was Americanized. I started watching TV all the
time and got into a little trouble with my mom. The good thing was in
fourth grade, especially math, I was ahead of all the kids."</TE>
<TE>   Dealing with new classmates and a new country tested Gella's faith
in his mother's decision to leave Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "People were treating me unfairly," he said. "They were calling me
names. They really made me feel I was different."</TE>
<TE>   Football helped him fit in. He thrived on the physical sport even
though he's only 5 feet 8, 170 pounds. These days, his Loyola
teammates tease those who feel the wrath of a Gella hit.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever I hurt somebody, they say, 'Don't worry about it, he's
the Russian,' " Gella said.</TE>
<TE>   Gella still has fond memories of his days in Russia, from swimming
in the freezing Pacific Ocean in October to crawling on the cannons
in the Kremlin. He woke up in the middle of the night in June to
watch the Russian soccer team in the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "I root for all the Russian teams in the Olympics," he said. "I'm
proud to be a Russian person but also proud to be an American. You
get the best of both worlds."</TE>
<TE>   Elena took a risk in leaving Russia for an uncertain future, but
she has no regrets after seeing how her son has benefited.</TE>
<TE>   She's filled with pride, "not so much about his grades, but about
his mind-set, who he is, what he is," she said. "What makes me happy
is that he's safe, healthy and bright."</TE>
<TE>   Gella turned 18 on Saturday. Soon, he hopes to take the oath to
become an American citizen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be an important day because then I'm officially a
Russian American," he said.</TE>

<DH>Surfing: Slater and others shine in Boost Mobile Pro in the
best conditions in years at Lower Trestles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sun shone, the waves rose, breaking hard and fast to the south,
and the world's top surfers on Monday put on one of the greatest
performances ever seen at Lower Trestles near San Clemente.</LD>
<LD>   In the best surf to have swept over the legendary point break in
years, the wave faces measured 10 feet or higher, with a gentle
offshore breeze holding their shape to nothing short of perfect.</LD>
<LD>   During what organizers of the Boost Mobile Pro were calling "the
competition of the century."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, on a day that the Assn. of Surfing Professionals' World
Championship Tour event--the only such event this year on the U.S.
mainland--thinned its ranks from 16 to four, the biggest losers were
the unfortunate surfing masses relegated to lesser breaks to the
north and south.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the biggest reward--being able to surf [Lower] Trestles
like this in heats with only one other guy," said Taylor Knox of
Carlsbad. Knox, 31, was knocked off in the fourth round by Shane
Beschen of San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   Beschen, 30, who had carved a clean 360-degree turn on the face of
his final fourth-round wave to help him edge Knox, could not find the
waves he needed to get past Luke Egan of Australia in the
quarterfinals. But the wild-card entrant, who failed to qualify for
this year's WCT, showed on his hometown break that he's back in top
form and will be a force to contend with on the elite world tour next
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in the mind frame where I consider these guys equals, not
more and not less," a fiery Beschen said after his loss to Egan, who
had nothing but praise for his rival.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, today's semifinals and finals will proceed without any
representatives from Southern California. But they will feature the
sport's most successful athlete in Kelly Slater, the six-time world
champion who finally is starting to resemble the Slater of old.</TE>
<TE>   Slater, 30, back on tour after a three-year hiatus, struggled
through the first five WCT events, finishing no higher than ninth and
starting the Trestles event ranked 21st in the world.</TE>
<TE>   In the early rounds of the Boost Mobile Pro, he hung on largely
with late-heat heroics he said were taking their toll emotionally.
But Monday, his inner fire fueled by conditions that improved
throughout the day, Slater had little trouble beating Darren
O'Rafferty in the fourth round, and even less against fellow
Floridian Damien Hobgood in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Against Hobgood, Slater used a series of high-powered, snapping
top turns and deep-carving cutbacks to post a score of 9.60 out of a
possible 10. Three waves later, with a pair of dolphins cruising
through the lineup, he caught a wave and faded to his left before
turning to his right. He picked up speed as he raced to beat the
section, and then snapped a turn hard off the lip and turned his
board 180 degrees to get back into the wave. He rode the wave to
completion and the judges gave him a 9.0.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the man who in the early 1990s ran off five consecutive
world championships is closing in on his first tour victory since
1998.</TE>
<TE>   "It just feels great to be able to kick back and exhale after all
that," Slater said after his quarterfinal triumph. "I've been able to
work off a lot of nervous energy out here and it's good to get my
legs working and my blood flowing again."</TE>
<TE>   Slater, an avid golfer and fan of the game, called Monday moving
day--just like Saturday on the PGA Tour--and by posting the day's
highest two-wave total, 18.60, he made the day's biggest move.</TE>
<TE>   His first foe today is Egan, who has been taking things in stride
since the contest began Thursday and said, "I'm not about to change
my game plan now."</TE>
<TE>   In the other semifinal, Brazil's Guilherme Herdy will face
Australia's Michael Campbell.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Because of security concerns and logistical problems, a paddle-out
ceremony to honor the victims of the Sept. 11 tragedy will be held
today instead of Wednesday. The ceremony, which is open to the
public, will be held about noon, before the Boost Mobile Pro finals.</TE>

<HD>No Term Limits for Sampras Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>That Pete Sampras lost in the second round of a tuneup tournament on
Long Island last month wasn't the primary issue. What he said
afterward was.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to remember who I am and where I'm playing next week,"
he said after a three-set loss to Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu. "The
U.S. Open is where you shine and that is where I hope to shine. I'm
not the man to beat, like I once was--Lleyton Hewitt has taken that
role--but I'm still one of the favorites. The fear factor is still
there in the majors, although maybe not as much as it used to be."</LD>
<LD>   Frankly, it seemed sad at the time. Many read those comments and
wondered if Sampras didn't seem a tad deluded. Fear factor? His
tournament drought had hit double digits, 33. Once, numbers that high
identified with Sampras usually dealt with aces.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Sampras had done too much, and suffered too much, in 2002,
and the words passed without commentary. Why pile on when Yevgeny
Kafelnikov had already publicly voiced what other players were saying
quietly, that Sampras should consider retiring?</TE>
<TE>   The beauty of sport, though--as well as life--is its crazy
bounces. On Sunday, one player was left standing at the U.S. Open,
Sampras. His greatest rival, Andre Agassi, was dispatched in a
stirring four-set final.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called "New Balls" kids--let's put that gimmick in
mothballs, please--were long gone. Tommy Haas, in the fourth round,
and Andy Roddick, in the quarterfinals, both had been taken out by
... Sampras.</TE>
<TE>   As for the critics? Greg Rusedski, the man whose left foot ended
up in his mouth when he suggested that Sampras had lost a step, made
it to the second week only because of rain delays, and was dismissed
in the third round last Monday by ... Sampras. Kafelnikov didn't even
make it through the first week.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras might have sounded like a tennis orphan with his brave
words in Long Island. Funny how he turned into a tennis oracle one
tournament later.</TE>
<TE>   And so, Sampras the seer was keeping the world off balance about
his future in the moments after perhaps his greatest achievement, his
fifth U.S. Open title and 14th Grand Slam singles championship.</TE>
<TE>   The victory will allow him the luxury of taking his next step on
his own terms. Going out on top is something of an American
obsession, really, and Sampras, should he choose to go that route,
scripted it perfectly, beating his all-time rival Agassi under the
lights of Arthur Ashe Stadium, hitting 33 aces.</TE>
<TE>   There is no hard-and-fast script, though. Agassi's wife Steffi
Graf won her final and most unexpected Grand Slam, the 1999 French
Open, after an emotional, injury-riddled journey. Graf could have
stopped then, but went on to reach the Wimbledon final in July and
retired later that summer.</TE>
<TE>   Losing in the final at Wimbledon did nothing to diminish her
storybook French Open victory, and an early or late Sampras loss next
year at Wimbledon would not detract from his U.S. Open
accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   Had Sampras thought about who his final opponent at Wimbledon
might be?</TE>
<TE>   "You can't predict these things," he said. "[It will be] whoever
it is. I mean, I don't know. You wanted a storybook ending, but
hopefully, my last Wimbledon will be on Center Court and not Court 12
or 2."</TE>
<TE>   And not against George Bastl, who beat him in the second round
this year on Court 2. That was Sampras' low point, and the resulting
negativity started to settle into his psyche.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to stop on my own terms," he said Sunday after his 6-3,
6-4, 5-7, 6-4 victory over Agassi. "That was the one thing I promised
myself, even though I was struggling this year and hearing this and
that.</TE>
<TE>   "I've done too much in the game to hear the negative things and
start believing it because there was a point I was believing it,
maybe this time.</TE>
<TE>   "Having my family, my wife, just kind of kept me going and [Coach
Paul Annacone] just kept me positive, and that was huge for me.</TE>
<TE>   "I could step away from the game and feel really good about what
I'd done," Sampras said of his attitude before the Open. "But I still
felt like I had one more moment, maybe a couple more moments. And it
happened today."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the solution would be for him to play a drastically
reduced schedule, retire from the full-time grind of the tour, and
focus on selected Grand Slams.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he puts the same effort and the same performance in
at a regular tournament," said the retired Boris Becker. "I think if
he would play eight Slams a year, he'd make four finals and maybe win
one or two."</TE>
<TE>   There is no large looming figure dominating the game, week in and
week out. There were four winners at the four Slams this year. Thomas
Johansson won the Australian Open, Albert Costa the French Open,
Hewitt won at Wimbledon and Sampras here.</TE>
<TE>   The German legend, Becker, talked about the boost Agassi and
Sampras gave the sport at the Open.</TE>
<TE>   "All the talk the last couple of weeks [about] whether they're
finished or not, I think they've proven a point here," he said.
"Hopefully you'll see more of Pete and Andre for the next 12 months
because this is what tennis is all about.</TE>
<TE>   "You see Lleyton Hewitt, the current No. 1 against the former No.
1s. This is what tennis needs, to see a comeback from Pete. We don't
need to explain how much he'd won. It's good for tennis altogether."</TE>

<HD>Olson Gets Attention of Oklahoma State</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oklahoma State Coach Les Miles drew a conclusion watching Drew Olson.</LD>
<LD>   "Any time you bring in a freshman in that situation, you have
confidence in him," said Miles, whose team plays host to UCLA on
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   He marveled at Bruin Coach Bob Toledo's improbable decision to
insert the freshman quarterback late in the third quarter of a game
UCLA trailed Saturday against Colorado State. Despite a shaky first
series, Olson remained in the game and directed a 52-yard scoring
drive in the fourth quarter that gave the Bruins a lead they did not
relinquish.</LD>
<TE>   Toledo clearly believes in Olson, who completed two of three
passes. Senior Cory Paus remains the starter, but the coach said
Olson would play in the next three games. And it might again be with
the outcome on the line.</TE>
<TE>   "I want him to play when it's still a game," Toledo said. "I
wouldn't put a young man in a game if I didn't feel he was physically
capable and mentally prepared. He is very sharp."</TE>
<TE>   After a shaky first half, Paus got sharper, completing five passes
in a row on UCLA's first possession of the third quarter. Olson was
about to enter the game late in the first half, but a
roughing-the-kicker penalty extended Colorado State's last drive.</TE>
<TE>   Paus, who threw a second-quarter interception, was grateful he
wasn't removed until getting a chance to redeem himself.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great decision not to take me out in the second
quarter," he said. "After I threw the interception I was getting
booed already, and taking me out would have caused more boos."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior Chris Griffith was nine for 14 on field-goal attempts of
40-49 yards before missing from 41 yards in the second quarter
against Colorado State. He was 14 for 17 from 30-39 yards before
missing from 32 yards in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Reliability has always been Griffith's best asset, but he missed
the first kick so badly it struck a Colorado State defender on the
hip. The second try duck-hooked to the left. "I had my best pregame
in three years, I felt so good," he said. "The snaps and holds were
good, there is no excuse. I've moved on."</TE>
<TE>   Griffith has come through so often--he is 34 for 49 in his
career--his teammates consider him the least of the Bruins' concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris has made big kicks for us, and he'll make more of them,"
Ricky Manning said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ben Emanuel's 89-yard fumble return on Colorado State's two-point
conversion attempt with 1:32 to play resulted in two points,
extending UCLA's lead to 23-19.</TE>
<TE>   It also resulted in head scratching in the stands. Why were the
Bruins awarded only two points? Why was he allowed to run the fumble
back at all?</TE>
<TE>   A rule change a few years ago allows the defense to score on a
turnover during a two-point conversion attempt. Previously the play
was blown dead on the change of possession. The score is worth two
points because that is all the offense can score if the try is
successful.</TE>
<TE>   Confusion was understandable--it was the first defensive
conversion in UCLA history.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior middle linebacker Marcus Reese, who had nine tackles in his
first start, sprained an ankle during the Colorado State game but is
probable for Saturday. Fullback Pat Norton, who missed the game
because of an ankle injury, also is probable.</TE>

<HD>Dupree Is Suspended</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the basketball season still more than two months away, junior
forward Jerry Dupree of USC was suspended Monday for the first six
games by Coach Henry Bibby, who cited no specific reason for his
action.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a team decision, my decision," said Bibby. "It's about his
personal priorities ... and that can be looked at in different
scopes."</LD>
<LD>   Asked if there were academic issues, Bibby replied, "I'm not
saying that at all. I'm saying he needs to work on some personal
things and get them in priority and go from there and he'll be back
with us after that time. He needs to get his life in order."</LD>
<TE>   Bibby added that he could reduce the penalty if he saw Dupree
progressing.</TE>
<TE>   Dupree, who transferred to USC from San Bernardino Valley College
a year ago, frustrated Bibby at times last season and was left behind
when the Trojans traveled to Oregon and Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   The Moreno Valley native averaged 3.7 points and 1.8 rebounds in
11.7 minutes during the regular season, then turned it on in the
Pacific 10 Conference tournament, averaging 10.3 points, 3.7 rebounds
and two blocked shots in helping USC reach the title game.</TE>
<TE>   An upbeat Dupree declined to comment on his situation Monday at
Heritage Hall, though he intimated he would right his course.</TE>

<HD>Wilson Making Progress</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Offensive lineman Zach Wilson on Monday donned full pads for the
first time this season as No. 17 USC began preparations for
Saturday's game against No. 18 Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   Wilson, a 6-foot-5, 300-pound senior, strained his left foot on
Aug. 12, the first day of training camp. He wore a protective plastic
boot on his left foot for nearly a month before he was cleared to
practice last week.</LD>
<LD>   "It felt good to get out there and practice a little instead of
standing around all the time," said Wilson, who worked at right guard
and right tackle for about 30 minutes before team trainers pulled him
from the workout. "I'll do a little more tomorrow, and the next day a
little more."</LD>
<TE>   The Trojans do not want to rush Wilson, but there is concern about
depth on the offensive line and Wilson is regarded as a possible
solution at two positions.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said he is a few days away from performing with maximum
effort.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't fully trust it," he said of his foot. "It's not that it's
not well. I don't trust it enough to really get after it.... I don't
want to get hurt again."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior running back Justin Fargas received treatment for his
strained right hamstring over the weekend and participated in drills
for about 40 minutes of the two-hour practice.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to move around a little bit, get my hands on the
ball a little bit and, hopefully, do more tomorrow," said Fargas, who
missed the opener against Auburn. "The plan is not to do too much.
I'm trying to make it to the game. I'll increase what I do a little
bit every day."</TE>
<TE>   Fullback Chad Pierson, also recovering from a hamstring strain
that forced him to miss the opener, participated in the entire
practice. Flanker Keary Colbert returned after missing two days
because of a sore knee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC should be well prepared if Robert Hodge starts at quarterback
for Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Hodge played the second half of Saturday's 34-14 victory over San
Diego State after starter Craig Ochs suffered a concussion at the end
of the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Sarkisian, quarterbacks coach for USC, coached Hodge at El
Camino College during the 2000 season. Trojan fullback Sunny Byrd and
kicker David Davis played with Hodge at El Camino.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Pete Carroll said redshirt sophomore Matt Cassel is the No.
2 quarterback but is "fighting for his life to hold that spot and
Matt Leinart is right there with him." ... Receiver D. Hale, out
since the second week of training camp because of a bruised bone in
his left ankle, is no longer wearing a protective plastic boot....
USC's game against Kansas State on Sept. 21 at Manhattan, Kan., will
be televised nationally by TBS and will begin at 4 p.m. PDT.</TE>

<HD>Webber Faces Indictment</HD>
<DH>Jurisprudence: NBA star charged with lying to grand jury
about money he received at Michigan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Webber of the Sacramento Kings was indicted Monday in Detroit
on charges he lied to a federal grand jury about money and other
benefits he and his family received from an area booster while he was
a player at Michigan and at a suburban Detroit high school.</LD>
<LD>   Identified in the indictment by his full name, Mayce Edward
Christopher Webber III, "a/k/a Chris Webber, a/k/a C Webb," Webber
faces charges of conspiring to obstruct justice and making false
declarations before a grand jury when he testified two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Each count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a
maximum fine of $250,000, meaning the four-time NBA All-Star could
face up to 10 years and $500,000 if convicted on both counts.</LD>
<TE>   Webber's attorney and agent, L. Fallasha Erwin, did not return a
call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who signed Webber, 29, to a seven-year, $123-million
contract before last season, also declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Two other members of Webber's family--his father Mayce Webber Jr.
and an aunt, Charlene Johnson--were indicted on the same charges.</TE>
<TE>   The indictments stem not from an investigation of the Michigan
program but from a lengthy federal probe of Eddie L. Martin, who ran
an illegal lottery at Ford Motor Co.'s Rouge River Plant.</TE>
<TE>   Martin pleaded guilty in May under an agreement that stipulates he
will serve no more than 37 months in prison, acknowledging to
authorities he tried to launder some of the proceeds by lending
$616,000 to four Michgan players--Webber, Robert Traylor, Maurice
Taylor and Louis Bullock.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the plea agreement, Martin admitted having given Webber
and his family about $280,000 in cash and gifts between 1988, when
Webber was still at Detroit Country Day School, and 1993, when Webber
and other members of the "Fab Five" led Michigan to its second
consecutive NCAA title game as sophomores. (Michigan lost to North
Carolina in that game after Webber called a timeout the Wolverines
didn't have.)</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities also said Martin gave $160,000 to Traylor, now
with the New Orleans Hornets; $105,000 to Taylor, now with the
Houston Rockets; and $71,000 to Bullock, who has been playing in
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Traylor and Bullock admitted to receiving loans when they
testified before a grand jury two years ago, and the Chicago Bulls'
Jalen Rose, another member of Michigan's "Fab Five," also has said he
took "pocket money" from Martin.</TE>
<TE>   But Webber--despite the limited downside of admitting having taken
money almost a decade later with his fortune secure and long after
his NCAA eligibility has expired--has consistently denied accepting
large sums of money.</TE>
<TE>   He apparently stuck to that story when he was called to testify
before the grand jury on Aug. 2, 2000. The indictment alleges Webber
"knowingly misled and lied to the grand jury regarding the amounts of
money, benefits, obligations and expenses paid to and on [Webber's]
behalf."</TE>
<TE>   Webber repeatedly has denied receiving $280,000, although the
Detroit News reported that Martin had detailed financial records
indicating Webber repaid about $40,000.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way in the world that I took $280,000 from someone,"
Webber told ESPN in April. "I've said this a million times. We had to
actually go to court and testify about it, so if the judge, if the
lawyers, if everyone else respected it, I thought it would get out to
the media outlets as well. So no, I didn't take anything."</TE>
<TE>   Webber told the New York Times in April that Martin often gave
players $20 to mow his lawn.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to remember, ninth or 10th grade, $20 is all you need
for a week," Webber said. "I didn't get cars; I didn't get nothing. I
got $20 here and there, a lot of times. I'll be honest, it happened a
lot. And that shouldn't diminish the seriousness of it. Come on, I
did not take $260,000 or $280,000. I did not take $100,000. I did not
take tens of thousands of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Michigan--which fired coach Steve Fisher, now at San Diego State,
in 1997 in the wake of an outside investigation that questioned
Fisher's role in arranging comp tickets for Martin--now faces NCAA
penalties for infractions that began more than a decade ago. Michigan
could be forced to vacate its 1992 and '93 Final Four appearances and
could face fines and postseason and recruiting limitations, even
though Athletic Director Bill Martin and Coach Tommy Amaker were
hired after the violations and the current players were youngsters at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA has some leeway in handing down penalties; however, the
amount of money involved in the case makes it one of the most serious
in NCAA history.</TE>
<TE>   "Our objective all along, ever since I've been here and I'm
certain beforehand, was, 'Let's get the truth and let's act on it.
Let's cooperate with the NCAA fully,' " Bill Martin, the athletic
director, said last week before word of the Webber indictment.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Ed Martin situation, the way I personally size it up, he
is what one might consider a non-traditional booster--meaning he
never was an alum of the University of Michigan. Any of the premier
basketball talent at the junior high and high school level knew him
as Uncle Eddie and had varying relationships with him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very unfortunate chapter, but hey, we're big guys, and all
we want to do is get this behind us as quickly as possible."</TE>

<HD>Coming Home to Africa</HD>
<DH>Black Americans are resettling in ancestral lands,
embracing a heritage and looking to the continent's potential as a
way to fulfill dreams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania</DL>
<LD>Two years ago, David Robinson caved in and bought a television set. A
telephone followed shortly after. But Robinson still lives in a
backwater where solar electricity is the norm, public transport is
limited and cell phones don't work.</LD>
<LD>   Walking, sometimes for up to three hours, is often the only way to
get a message to someone.</LD>
<LD>   The son of baseball legend Jackie Robinson regards the sacrifice
of a few modern conveniences as worthwhile. His dream, ever since
setting foot in Africa as a tourist in 1967, was to settle down,
connect with his cultural heritage and help develop the continent's
economic potential.</LD>
<TE>   In 1986, Robinson put down roots in Tanzania. He says he has never
looked back.</TE>
<TE>   "It has exceeded any expectations that I had," said Robinson, 50.
"One could never know the opportunities, the beauty, the pleasure of
living here until one does live here."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson is just one among a stream of African Americans who have
come to Africa to exercise what many consider an ancestral right: To
make the continent their permanent home.</TE>
<TE>   Many are attracted by the ideal of solidarity and the prospect of
being part of the racial majority. Others seek business opportunities
that will both contribute to Africa's development and lead to
personal gain. Still others want their children to appreciate their
cultural heritage and to grow up in communities where their role
models are people of color. Some come to retire.</TE>
<TE>   Some newcomers have African spouses who can help ease them into
their new environment. Many have both the education and money--along
with the patience--to make their dreams of a new life on a new
continent come true. In the process, these Americans believe they can
help shape Africa's future.</TE>
<TE>   "Logically, the African American tribes outside of Africa have
something to offer and can play a role in Africa's global
development," said Robinson, a onetime fisherman and exporter of
African art who has been a coffee farmer for the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   There are no concrete statistics on the number of African
Americans who have decided to settle in Africa. U.S. embassies do not
register Americans living in individual countries by race. However,
Tanzania, Ghana, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Ethiopia and South
Africa are among the countries that have welcomed African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates by those who count themselves among this new breed of
settler range from as few as 15 permanent black American residents in
Tanzania to more than 1,000 in South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   For many, the transition has had bumps. In many African countries,
communications and roads are poor. Public services are often
unreliable. Tardiness and other annoying work habits frustrate many
newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   Such challenges did not deter the Connecticut-born Robinson. For
him, moving to Tanzania felt natural. He was inspired, he said, by
the example of his father, who broke major league baseball's color
barrier in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are faced with the negatives of racism, to be supported
by the personal courage and success of one's parent is a tremendous
barrier against the negative attitudes of society," Robinson said.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, who married a Tanzanian woman after he arrived in Africa
and is father to nine children, owns a 120-acre farm in the northern
mountains about 550 miles from Dar es Salaam, the capital. Called
"Sweet Unity Farms," it is part of a 350-farm cooperative, of which
Robinson is director of marketing and finance.</TE>
<TE>   To buy his land, Robinson had to state his case to regional
officials and village committees. In the end, he played the race
card--in keeping with the views of Tanzania's revered founding
father, Julius K. Nyerere, who preached unity and welcomed blacks
born outside Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "My ultimate presentation was that I was a black person who had
lost my nationalistic and tribal ties [to Africa] and I wanted to
come back," recalled Robinson, who now speaks fluent Kiswahili,
Tanzania's official language.</TE>
<TE>   He was offered as much land as he could clear and use. A novice,
Robinson relied heavily on his neighbors to learn farming. Today, he
exports coffee beans to the United States. Tanzanian coffee is
considered to be among the best in the world, and the beans fetch a
premium price.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson maintains that such success would have been harder to
achieve in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I still believe the psychological barriers and calluses and
bruises that we sustained throughout our American experience
continues to block us from taking advantage of the opportunities that
we can have," said Robinson, who retains a U.S. passport but expects
to become a Tanzanian citizen. "We are not the normal American
immigrant but the descendants of slaves. We have to recognize that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was business as well as the prospect of helping to develop a
country governed by black people that led Victoria Cooper in 1993 to
the West African country of Ghana, across the continent from
Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   "Growing up as an American, I would be doing a disservice if I
came to Ghana and didn't share my talents and experiences gained in
America with Ghanaians," said Cooper, 46, a St. Louis native.</TE>
<TE>   A former partner in the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers,
she left in July 2001 to launch a consulting firm that advises
governments on public sector reform and provides foreign investor
services in West Africa. Cooper says that Ghana has untold potential.</TE>
<TE>   "The current administration has a focus on business, and one can
feel the commitment," said Cooper, who is also president of the
American Chamber of Commerce, Ghana. "Although they have an uphill
battle, they recognize what that battle is."</TE>
<TE>   The African American Assn. in Ghana has about 50 dues-paying
members, but many others regularly come to meetings, said Cooper, who
presides over the group. During the last two years, several dozen
African Americans have arrived--some to pursue business, others to
retire, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Since becoming the first African colony to gain independence from
Britain, in 1957, Ghana has held a special appeal to African
Americans. U.S.-educated Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana's first president, was
a proponent of repatriation to Africa. Hundreds heeded his call, and
in the 1960s the nascent democracy became a popular destination for
black American activists, academics and professionals, including
scholar W.E.B. Du Bois and writer Maya Angelou.</TE>
<TE>   The trend waned after Nkrumah was ousted in 1966, but it regained
momentum while Jerry J. Rawlings, a former Ghanaian flight
lieutenant, was in power. At a rally in Harlem in 1995, Rawlings
announced plans to offer automatic Ghanaian citizenship to black
Americans. He urged them to invest their savings in Africa's future.</TE>
<TE>   The offer of citizenship has since been modified to the right of
abode, and legal details are still being ironed out, much to the
frustration of some African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "Just taking him at his word, they packed up and came over
expecting to get work permits," Cooper recalled. "It was easier said
than done. Many have been disappointed that it has not happened
sooner. But they are not totally discouraged."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a way, Michael Giles was pursuing the American dream when he
moved to South Africa in 1993. Giles said that despite having degrees
from Harvard and Columbia Law School, he felt that obstacles
including institutionalized racism would prevent him from reaching
his full professional potential.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I really can't take the risk of spending the years when
you have the energy and the drive to do something exciting,
squandering it in a place that is not going to be receptive," said
Giles, 43, who is from Newark, N.J. "The tragedy is, race has
blemished the opportunity for African Americans to achieve the
American dream."</TE>
<TE>   Giles, who met his South African wife, Bernadette, at Harvard,
gave up a career in corporate law to launch a chain of Laundromats in
South Africa. They later started a tourism company, Heritage Africa,
in Johannesburg.</TE>
<TE>   "This place represents an opportunity," Giles said. "To be here
now and involved in tourism is like being at the epicenter of what's
going to be the future of South Africa--jobs, economic opportunities
for black people, growth of the economy."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of African Americans flocked to South Africa after Nelson
Mandela led the country's first black-majority government into power
in 1994. Although the stream has slowed in recent years, South Africa
still is considered the main hub of black American resettlement.</TE>
<TE>   "It can lead the way for the rest of Africa," said Gayla
Cook-Mohajane, 52, director of the Joint Center for Political and
Economic Studies, a Johannesburg-based American think tank. She has
lived in South Africa for 12 years. "For people looking for a place
with energy, this is it. It is a very international place, a
crossroads of culture."</TE>
<TE>   South Africa may be especially attractive to American blacks
because of the problems elsewhere on the continent: political
upheaval, dictatorship, rough living conditions, and language
barriers.</TE>
<TE>   "South Africa, ironically, became the Great White Hope of the
black diaspora," John Matshikiza, a respected South African columnist
and university research fellow, wrote recently in the weekly Mail &amp;
Guardian newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "People speak comprehensible English here. Telephones work," he
said. "There's a black president, a largely black Cabinet, black
empowerment and a black economic elite which, even though they may
show signs of moral confusion and fallibility, nevertheless symbolize
a significant advance in the worldwide profile of the black world."</TE>
<TE>   Skin color does not always guarantee acceptance. Some South
Africans found Americans who arrived soon after the transition to
black majority rule to be patronizing, cliquish and arrogant about
the role they played in the struggle against apartheid. Others saw
them as unwanted competition. Companies tried to meet affirmative
action quotas by hiring black Americans rather than South Africans.</TE>
<TE>   "On the whole, the perception people had was that they came in
with an attitude, that they wanted to teach these backward Africans a
thing or two, that they were the better Africans," said Mzimkulu
Malungu, projects manager for the Business Day and Financial Mail
newspaper group. "People did not take too kindly to that."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit native Francis Kornegay, a program coordinator in an
international relations program at the University of the
Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said South African blacks still are
adjusting to seeing blacks from other African countries as well as
from the United States. In recent years, South Africa has seen a
flood of would-be immigrants from other parts of the continent.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to African Americans, [their] attitude may be
affected by their attitude of ambivalence to the U.S. in general," he
said. "And most black South Africans are quite ignorant about the
anti-apartheid history in the U.S." Blacks helped lead America's
economic embargo against apartheid-era South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The Pan-African spirit that exists elsewhere, particularly in West
Africa, the ancestral home of most American blacks, is absent in
South Africa, said Kornegay, who has lived there since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the black Americans' endeavors in South Africa
dismiss the issue of jobs as a smokescreen for petty jealousies.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not in direct competition with many South Africans,
because most of us who come create our own jobs, and jobs for South
Africans, or bring our own jobs with us," said Jerelyn Eddings,
executive director of the Foundation for African Media Excellence,
which promotes quality journalism in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   On the whole, however, African Americans say they have been made
to feel welcome in Africa, sometimes more so than in America. Race
has been the major factor.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel comfortable because I am a person of color," said Cooper,
the business consultant in Ghana. "It makes entrance easier. It
breaks down some barriers that would immediately go up if I were not
a person of color."</TE>
<TE>   That feeling has been one of the best aspects of living in Africa
for Robi Machaba, who was known as Irving W. Robinson back home in
Columbus, Ga. The Waikoma ethnic group of Tanzania, among whom he has
lived since 1985, gave Machaba his new name.</TE>
<TE>   A former development consultant, Machaba was given land in 1990
and now grows avocados and passion fruit near the shores of Lake
Victoria.</TE>
<TE>   "Here I have land, whereas America has never given me my 40 acres
and a mule," said Machaba, 59. He said he gives back by helping to
curate an annual sculpture exhibit to raise funds for a bush
basketball team he helps run.</TE>
<TE>   Like most expatriates in Africa, black Americans typically live
comfortable lives. Many can afford nice homes and, when necessary,
electrical generators, water storage tanks, and housekeeping and
gardening services that help make up for the lack of infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Expatriates contrast their lives with black Americans who have
fallen prey to crime and drugs. Some of them believe social problems
were intentionally planted in American black communities to ensure
their demise.</TE>
<TE>   "One needs only to look at the American prisons, American
substance abuse programs and the number of premature deaths, and you
can see that society is successfully eliminating the African American
male," said David Robinson. "It is hard for a black man in America,
and in particular for a black man with self-respect."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ensuring that her son, Selasi, now 10, would grow up in an
environment where his skin color would not be an obstacle was a key
factor in Mona Boyd's decision to move to her husband's native Ghana
in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "I really wanted to give him the opportunity to grow into a
confident man, without being marginalized in any way," said Boyd, 52,
who owns the Avis car rental franchise in Accra, Ghana's capital, and
a successful tour company.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt Ghana could do that for him."</TE>
<TE>   She also wanted him to be surrounded by black role models. Cooper
felt the same way about her teenage daughters, both of whom grew up
in Ghana.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have to have any insecurity about who they are,"
Cooper said. "They can have a very high sense of self-esteem, because
people they see doing big things--doctors, lawyers, engineers, even
presidents--look like them. They can aspire to anything."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper and Boyd both said exposing their children to their
heritage was also important.</TE>
<TE>   "I was keenly aware that my heritage was very short," said Boyd,
who can trace her family tree back 100 or so years to a farming
community in Turrell, Ark. "We can only go back so far. I felt
something was missing. My husband being Ghanaian with a family
history of a thousand years, I felt the best gift we could give
Selasi was a part of this."</TE>
<TE>   Even though such opportunities have made it easier for these
Americans to leave the country of their birth, the United States
remains a land that, ironically, receives thousands of applications
every year from would-be African immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "I like America, but I've decided not to be part of the finale,"
Machaba said. "I've found a place to die. It's just that simple. I am
free here."</TE>

<HD>Arafat Decries Suicide Bombers but Denounces Israel's
Attacks</HD>
<DH>Mideast: In a rambling address, Palestinian leader wins few
points from friends or foes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Speaking to the largest gathering of Palestinian legislators in two
years, Yasser Arafat on Monday condemned terrorist attacks on Israeli
civilians while excoriating Israel for attacks on Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   In a rambling speech delivered at times in a near-whisper, the
Palestinian Authority president also promised elections in early
January, prompting catcalls from some legislators who demanded that
he set the date with an official decree.</LD>
<LD>   Arafat, who appeared weak and at times fumbled with his
microphone, apologized early in his 70-minute speech, saying, "I'm
sorry, I have a bit of flu."</LD>
<TE>   In what one Palestinian legislator described as a bid to regain
international acceptance, Arafat repeatedly condemned terrorism,
"whether it is carried out by state, by group or by individuals." He
expressed sympathy for Americans preparing for the first anniversary
of the Sept. 11 attacks, which he called an "unprecedented crime."</TE>
<TE>   In an apparent reference to suicide bomb attacks by Palestinians
that have taken a heavy toll on Israel, Arafat said: "Our national
interest and the necessity to maintain international support for our
just cause ... force us to reiterate our stand in condemning all
these acts of terror against Israeli civilians, but also to condemn
every act of terror against Palestinian civilians."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli leaders were largely dismissive of Arafat's remarks,
saying they want action, not words.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat's statement is worthless," said Tzachi Hanegbi, a leading
member of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's Likud Party. He called the
Palestinian leader "a pathological liar."</TE>
<TE>   Another Likud member of parliament, Danny Naveh, said Israeli
authorities should have prevented the Palestinian Legislative Council
from meeting at all.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been better not to make a move which may breathe
new life into Arafat," he said. "This meeting may reinforce his
legitimacy, something which I believe isn't in our interest."</TE>
<TE>   Both Sharon and President Bush have said they don't consider
Arafat a trustworthy partner in peace negotiations and have called
for new Palestinian leadership. However, Arafat is considered almost
certain to win reelection as president of the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators have been pressing Arafat to set a date for elections,
both for president and for parliament. Parliamentary elections
haven't been held since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   When Arafat pledged Monday to hold elections in January, several
legislators began shouting at him to set a date.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no decree!" one member yelled.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm saying it in front of you, so there's a commitment," Arafat
replied.</TE>
<TE>   Several legislators grumbled afterward that Arafat had given them
little to work with in attempting to salvage some semblance of
self-governance. Many want to see a prime minister appointed to take
on the day-to-day running of the government. Arafat opposes such a
move, since it would take away much of his power.</TE>
<TE>   "He really should have discussed issues.... We can see that this
speech was meant for the world more than for the Palestinian
Legislative Council," said Abbas Zaki, a council member from the West
Bank city of Hebron.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat appeared to joke during the speech that he was willing to
relinquish power.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want," he said, "you can bring someone else to replace me
in the executive power. I wish you would do it and give me some
rest."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's remarks were delivered in a hot, overcrowded meeting room
at his headquarters, much of which has been destroyed by Israeli
shells. Sandbags partially covered windows, and there were gaping
holes in sections of the ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting drew diplomats from European countries and Canada. The
United States did not send a representative.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators last met four months ago but have not met in such
numbers since the current round of violence began nearly two years
ago. The meeting had the atmosphere of a reunion, since many had not
seen one another for months.</TE>
<TE>   "I miss all these friends," said one attendee, television
journalist Nasser Lahem, who said it had taken him 2 1/2 hours to
make the 15-mile drive from his home in Bethlehem to Ramallah,
traversing military roadblocks and other barriers with a rare Israeli
permit.</TE>
<TE>   Of 86 council members, 47 attended the meeting. Twenty-eight tuned
in via a shaky videoconference connection from Gaza City. Israel had
banned 13 Gaza Strip legislators from attending the session in the
West Bank because of alleged ties to terrorism. Others decided to
stay in Gaza to show solidarity with the banned members.</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen protesters gathered outside the meeting in Ramallah
to chide those who accepted Israeli passes to attend.</TE>
<TE>   "Only Free Men Can Negotiate," one protester's sign read.</TE>
<TE>   Relations between Israel and the Palestinians have been relatively
calm in recent days, although there was more violence in Gaza on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli authorities said troops in southern Gaza shot and killed
two Palestinian teenagers who were attempting to plant bombs near a
fence separating Israel from Gaza. Their families said they were
trying to sneak across the border into Israel to find work.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, dozens of Israeli tanks and armored vehicles rolled
into an area of Gaza where there are four refugee camps, exchanging
fire with residents. Soldiers destroyed two buildings near the Bureij
refugee camp, including the home of an alleged militant leader
believed responsible for a recent attack on an Israeli tank that left
one soldier dead.</TE>

assassinate Mubarak.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HAEKSTEP, Egypt</DL>
<LD>A military court convicted 51 suspected members of a Muslim militant
group on a variety of charges Monday and sentenced them to two to 15
years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   In all, 94 men were tried, 43 of whom were acquitted. The main
defendants were charged with founding an illegal group that planned
to assassinate President Hosni Mubarak and other public figures and
to attack government institutions. Six were tried in absentia.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors dubbed the group Al Waad--or "The Promise"--and said
it was new.</LD>
<TE>   Charges included belonging to the group, possessing explosives and
ammunition and raising funds without authorization for rebels in
Chechnya and Hamas militants in the Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants had said they did not even belong to a group.</TE>
<TE>   The accused had acknowledged, however, raising funds for groups
they saw as fellow Muslims in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Raising charity funds without government permission is punishable
under an Egyptian military decree designed to limit the activities of
Islamic groups.</TE>
<TE>   Three defendants received the harshest sentences of 15 years:
Egyptians Magdi Hassan Idris, 33, and Omar Abdel Aziz Khalifa, 36;
and Omar Hagayev Mahdi, 36, from the southern Russian republic of
Dagestan, which borders Chechnya.</TE>

<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>The leaders of the two main Kurdish factions that control northern
Iraq have signed a reconciliation agreement as the United States
tries to forge a united front against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   The two Kurdish factions run an autonomous enclave in northern
Iraq and can mobilize tens of thousands of fighters, but they have
been deeply divided.</LD>
<LD>   Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, or
PUK, and Massoud Barzani, head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, or
KDP, met over the weekend in the Iraqi Kurdish city of Irbil to
confer on resolving their differences.</LD>
<TE>   According to a joint statement, the two sides agreed to set up a
committee to discuss "formulating a united political position on
regional and international" issues. The two sides also agreed that a
regional Kurdish assembly would meet Oct. 4.</TE>
<TE>   The Kurdish enclave is protected by U.S. and British warplanes,
which enforce a "no-fly" zone over northern Iraq. Allied planes over
a southern "no-fly" zone bombed a military facility Monday in the
third attack this week after coming under Iraqi fire, the Pentagon
said.</TE>

<HD>Afghans Honor a Leader Who Fought Taliban</HD>
<DH>Anniversary: Thousands turn out in the capital and around
the country to remember Ahmed Shah Masoud, slain two days before
Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>A rally here Monday climaxed nationwide commemorations of the
assassination a year ago of Ahmed Shah Masoud, the leader of the
anti-Taliban resistance who was killed by suspected Al Qaeda
operatives two days before the terrorist attacks on the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   Amid heavy security, streets in Kabul, the Afghan capital, were
lined with portraits of Masoud. Police and soldiers donned T-shirts
depicting his face as they ushered a crowd estimated at more than
10,000 people into the main stadium. Another 10,000 or so gathered to
listen in adjacent fields.</LD>
<LD>   Monday was declared a holiday, and electricity, shut off in the
city during the daytime recently to conserve water at hydroelectric
plants, remained on so that people could watch the four-hour memorial
ceremony on television.</LD>
<TE>   But although the ceremonies around the country and state-organized
pilgrimages to Masoud's mausoleum in the Panjshir Valley inspired in
many a feeling of sadness, they also carried a strong overtone of
propaganda benefiting Masoud's Northern Alliance movement. The
alliance controls some of the most powerful positions within the new
Afghan state.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud, an ethnic Tajik, is a hero to Tajiks, who made up most of
the Northern Alliance forces. But he is not nearly so popular among
other ethnic groups, who remember his role--along with those of other
moujahedeen commanders--in largely destroying Kabul during a 1992-96
civil war.</TE>
<TE>   No such criticisms of Masoud were heard at the rally in Kabul,
where his 13-year-old son, Ahmed, rail-thin and dressed in a suit and
the brown woolen cap favored by his father, stood under an enormous
portrait of Masoud and received endless kisses from bearded
dignitaries praising the man known as the "Lion of Panjshir."</TE>
<TE>   Reading a speech in a nervous voice, the young Masoud told the
crowd: "This commemoration should be a renewal of our commitment to
our martyred heroes. We should promise to follow their path and
program, and pass it on to future generations, so that they too will
defend their countries."</TE>
<TE>   The stadium where the rally was held was the same one where the
Taliban regime once held public executions. A friend of Masoud's who
survived the bombing that killed him hobbled to the podium and
delivered an emotional speech in praise of the slain commander.</TE>
<TE>   As the day passed without terrorist incident, it appeared that the
heavy security precautions were paying off. Authorities long have
feared new attacks to coincide with this week's anniversaries of
Masoud's death and the attacks Sept. 11 in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan has been particularly on edge since Thursday, when
President Hamid Karzai narrowly escaped a would-be assassin's bullet
in the southern city of Kandahar and a bomb went off in Kabul that
killed at least 24 people.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, everyone entering the stadium was carefully searched
for weapons. Cars were stopped and searched in the streets, and two
helicopters circled above the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud was killed by a bomb-packed video camera as he began an
interview with two Arabs posing as journalists. Immediately after his
killing, Taliban troops launched an all-out offensive to try to oust
the Northern Alliance from the small corner of Afghan territory that
it then controlled.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. intervention after the terrorist strikes in the United
States changed the tide of that conflict, allowing Masoud's forces to
triumphantly enter Kabul by November.</TE>
<TE>   Francesc Vendrell, the European Union's special representative to
Afghanistan, told reporters Sunday that he believed the attention
being lavished upon Masoud was justified.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not surprised that Masoud has been turned into a hero. He was
assassinated in a moment when there was a real danger that this
country would be overrun by the Taliban," Vendrell said. "His
assassination was a tragedy and deprived Afghanistan of an important
leader and a major partner to other potential leaders in this
country."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the rally in Kabul, ceremonies were held in several
other cities, including Mazar-i-Sharif to the northwest.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, at a two-day symposium in Kabul, officials and scholars
discussed the legacy of Masoud. In addition, special television
programs were broadcast to commemorate his years of fighting against
Soviet invaders and his later campaign against the Taliban, which his
militia prevented from achieving a total takeover of the country.</TE>
<TE>   A massive statue of Masoud, scheduled to be installed at one of
Kabul's main intersections, was not ready for the anniversary but
will be unveiled in coming months, said Masoud's younger brother,
Ahmed Wali. He also said the former moujahedeen fighter was being
nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.</TE>

<HD>Bush Presses Iraq Case to More Leaders</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: President meets with Canada's premier and makes
calls to heads of EU and U.N., among others. Little new public
support results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>President Bush met with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien on
Monday and telephoned the leaders of the United Nations, the European
Union, Turkey and Egypt as he sought allies for a new U.S. initiative
against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   As was the case after calls Bush made to the leaders of Russia,
France and China last week, there was little public indication that
he was gaining support. But an administration official reported signs
that Bush was making headway.</LD>
<LD>   The administration's diplomacy on Iraq is moving at an urgent
pace, heading toward a speech Bush will deliver Thursday to the U.N.
General Assembly. In his remarks, Bush is expected to argue for a new
international effort to force Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to
disarm or face military action.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration is working on a timetable for action,
beginning with a U.N. resolution that would both toughen the terms of
and accelerate Iraq's disarmament, according to administration
officials.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials would like the U.N. Security Council to debate and
pass a resolution within a few weeks. It would probably be introduced
by Britain.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Monday that the
administration believes the international community is interested in
toughening the terms for removing Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "It does appear that a movement is budding to put some force into
previous U.N. resolutions," Fleischer told reporters en route to
Bush's meeting with Chretien in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Upon passage of a new U.N. resolution, Washington would like to
see U.N. weapons inspectors return to Baghdad within four to six
weeks, State Department officials said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most controversial questions, both within the
administration and at the United Nations, is how much time Hussein's
regime would have to fully disarm. Behind the scenes, some countries
are expressing concern that the United States will seek such a short
time frame that it will be simply a pretext to use force.</TE>
<TE>   But a well-placed U.S. official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said Monday that the timing might prove to be irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that the time period is almost moot," the official said.
"Saddam Hussein will give us an excuse. He'll balk at something
within the first few weeks of the process, and that'll be the
material breach that will allow us to move forward with another
option."</TE>
<TE>   Chretien has been among the most upfront of U.S. allies in
opposing military action. Neither Bush nor Chretien spoke publicly
about Iraq after their private meeting here, studiously avoiding the
subject as they focused during back-to-back speeches on the issue of
border security.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said Bush told Chretien that Iraq is in violation of
existing U.N. resolutions but did not ask Canada to change its view.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Chretien came to Detroit for a ceremony at a U.S. Customs
Service station at the Ambassador Bridge, where high-tech equipment
has been introduced to make it easier for frequent travelers and
pre-approved cargo trucks to pass inspection points.</TE>
<TE>   As they drove five minutes from their meeting in downtown Detroit
to the base of the bridge, the two leaders encountered about two
dozen protesters opposed to war with Iraq</TE>
<TE>   "Drop Bush, not bombs," read one of their signs.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Chretien had said he would listen to Bush's argument on
Iraq. But Chretien said he had not yet seen reason to support a
military operation, echoing other global leaders who have said Bush
needs to make a stronger case.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been agreed with Mr. Bush that if the time comes where
there is evidence, we will talk about it and they will produce that
evidence," Chretien said last week in Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting in this border city that symbolizes the close
commercial relationship between the United States and Canada was part
of the concentrated diplomatic activity to which Bush has devoted
himself since Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But at nearly every turn so far, the president has been rebuffed.</TE>
<TE>   Only British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who flew across the
Atlantic and back on Saturday to meet with Bush at Camp David, has
given anything resembling a strong endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spoke by telephone Friday with three presidents--Jacques
Chirac of France, Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Jiang Zemin of
China. None offered public support afterward for an attack on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Chirac, however, has proposed a two-step course that could lead to
a war--but only with strong U.N. support. Under his proposal, the
Security Council would order inspections, and Iraq would be given
three weeks to comply with the mandate. Failure to permit the
inspections would be met with force if a second Security Council
measure approved military operations.</TE>
<TE>   Although Fleischer did not comment directly on the proposal, a
question about it prompted his remark about a movement to toughen
existing U.N. resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   Bush began Monday with a series of telephone calls on Iraq.
Fleischer said the president spoke with President Ahmet Necdet Sezer
of Turkey, a country that could be a key staging area for a military
offensive against Iraq. He also spoke with Danish Prime Minister
Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the current head of the European Union, and
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In addition, he called Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, key leaders
in the Arab world.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is calling as part of his ongoing consultations
with leaders around the world about the situation in Iraq, and also
urging them to listen carefully to his speech to the United Nations,"
Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Bush is expected to emphasize that the world should
act because Hussein is in violation of all the resolutions concerning
Iraq that the U.N. has adopted since the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "He's violated every resolution on Iraq," a senior State
Department official said Monday. "The burden can't be on us to prove
that he's building new weapons of mass destruction. The burden should
be on him."</TE>
<TE>   The administration is still debating whether Bush himself should
be the one to call for a tougher U.N. resolution. As of Monday, a
draft of the president's speech outlined the case against Iraq in
strong language but did not call for a resolution.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy, discussed during Bush's weekend meeting with Blair,
is to have Britain argue the case with key countries and then mediate
an agreement on how intrusive or coercive to make new weapons
inspections.</TE>
<TE>   The Ambassador Bridge, where Bush visited the customs station, is
the most heavily traveled U.S. border crossing. More than any other
crossing, the bridge connecting Detroit with Windsor, Ontario,
epitomizes the dilemma posed along the border in the wake of the
Sept. 11 attacks: how to increase security while not slowing the
commerce on which communities on both sides of the border depend.</TE>
<TE>   The two nations have cooperated to speed passage of those who pass
frequently through the checkpoint, issuing special identification
cards and installing high-tech scanners to monitor the traffic,
making it possible for approved truckers to speed through dedicated
lanes. The system is similar to one already employed along the border
between Washington state and British Columbia.</TE>

<HD>Military Quietly Poised for Iraq</HD>
<DH>Strategy: U.S. forces positioned around the Mideast could
deploy in as little as two months, much faster than during Desert
Shield.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As the debate intensifies on whether to invade Iraq, the Pentagon has
quietly positioned its forces to be ready to move against Saddam
Hussein in as little as two months.</LD>
<LD>   Although President Bush continued his efforts Monday to rally
support for a campaign against the Iraqi leader, a military strike is
unlikely to happen that quickly, observers say. The administration,
for instance, has yet to formally request basing and flyover rights
from the dozens of countries on which a military operation would
depend.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike the last time it invaded Iraq, however, the military seems
prepared to act. The U.S. has forces, weaponry and supplies to equip
30,000 troops already in the region, while 150,000 or more fully
equipped troops who would be needed to mount a full-scale invasion
could be routed to the region well before Christmas.</LD>
<TE>   The ability to move quickly into Iraq is not the result of any
recent overt moves of troops or equipment. Although the military has
recently signed big contracts for commercial air and sea cargo space
and has been replenishing its bomb supplies, it appears to have
engaged in relatively little activity at its bases and camps in the
countries surrounding Iraq that had not been in the works for several
years.</TE>
<TE>   The military has not only maintained its bases throughout the
Persian Gulf since 1991 but has expanded them and built new ones. And
it has made vast improvements in its ability to transport heavy
materiel by sea and air.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's diplomacy on an Iraq campaign is moving
at an urgent pace. On Monday, Bush met in Detroit with Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien, who has been among the most upfront of the
U.S. allies in opposing military action against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Bush made a series of telephone calls seeking
to round up support. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Bush
spoke with President Ahmet Necdet Sezer of Turkey, which could be a
key staging area for a military offensive against Iraq; Danish Prime
Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who also is president of the European
Union; and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</TE>
<TE>   Although there was little public indication of growing support,
Fleischer said "budding" signs suggest that Bush's effort is making
headway.</TE>
<TE>   Since its difficult preparation for the 1991 Persian Gulf War,
when the U.S. needed six months to move its ground forces across the
world and mass them on Iraq's borders, the military has steadily
increased the number of troops and amount of equipment it maintains
at the ready in and around the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   More Efficient Ships</TE>
<TE>   To move still more equipment and supplies to the region, the
military has bought and built more, faster and better ships and
aircraft--enough to cut by more than two-thirds the time it should
take to deploy a large military force to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The ships can be unloaded much more rapidly than the cargo ships
that were used to equip troops in the Gulf War, which relied on
massive cranes to painstakingly lift tanks and other heavy gear out
of their holds. Once in port, the new ships' ramps come down, and
workers drive vehicles off.</TE>
<TE>   Other, less obvious advances cut deployment time. In 1991, troops
unloading ships weren't armed with manifests detailing what each
container held, said retired Army Lt. Gen. William G. "Gus" Pagonis,
who masterminded logistics during the Gulf War. That left troops
digging through each container to find the equipment they most
needed. Today, port personnel have computerized manifests sent to
them before a ship arrives.</TE>
<TE>   "A war in Iraq is not going to be quick and dirty, but the
logistics of supporting one are a whole lot quicker now than they
were," Pagonis said. "We can do it, and we can do it faster and
better than we did the first time. We really learned some lessons."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the sheer tonnage of U.S. tanks, fighting vehicles,
armored personnel carriers and other heavy equipment already standing
at the ready in Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and elsewhere in
the Middle East is startling.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Gulf War, almost none of it was based in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "We have done a lot with pre- positioned stocks in the gulf,
making sure they're accessible and that they are in the right spot to
support whatever the president wants to do," Army Secretary Thomas E.
White said last week.</TE>
<TE>   Today, equipment for two Army heavy brigades is in Kuwait and
Qatar, including 230 M-1A1 Abrams tanks, 120 M-2A2 Bradley fighting
vehicles, 200 armored personnel carriers, 50 mortars and 40
155-millimeter howitzers. Warehouses in Kuwait and Qatar hold enough
food and fuel to support two brigades of 5,000 troops each for a
month.</TE>
<TE>   A $200-million Army headquarters opened for business this year
near the village of Arifjan, south of Kuwait City. It will be a
permanent home for about 10,000 noncombat Army personnel who have
been based at Kuwait's Camp Doha since early this year.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, there are indications that the Army has moved new
combat troops into the region in recent months. One 1,500-member
battalion has long been based at Camp Doha, but some military
analysts who track such movements believe that the number may have
grown to about 5,000 soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 9,000 troops intended to pair up with the equipment
already in place in Qatar and Kuwait could be airlifted in, probably
from bases in Georgia and Texas, and be ready for action in 96 hours,
military officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Special Forces troops are positioned throughout the region,
according to defense officials, but their numbers are small and their
locations kept secret.</TE>
<TE>   This extensive Middle East-based network is apart from the
Afghanistan war theater. About 7,800 U.S. troops are on the ground in
that country, and thousands more are at newly developed U.S. bases
and airfields in surrounding countries such Uzbekistan and
Kyrgyzstan.</TE>
<TE>   By last winter, it was estimated that 60,000 U.S. military
personnel were working in South and Central Asia. It is unclear what
portion of those troops might be moved to an Iraq theater.</TE>
<TE>   Around the British-controlled island of Diego Garcia, in the
Indian Ocean, the improvements to the Army's readiness are striking.</TE>
<TE>   There, about eight ships designed to permit massive artillery
pieces, Humvees and trucks to roll on and off like cars on a ferry
are fully loaded with enough equipment to support one Army heavy
brigade, plus weaponry, ammunition and supplies to equip multiple
Army divisions for at least 30 days. Nearby, 15 ships are loaded with
ammunition, fuel and minesweepers.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines have equipment for one expeditionary brigade aboard
fast ships afloat at Diego Garcia, plus enough equipment and supplies
to maintain an air wing and ground support force for 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Gulf War, only the Marines had ships at the ready with
such fighting essentials. In fact, for more than 30 days after Army
troops arrived in the Persian Gulf in 1991, they had no food of their
own. The Marines fed them.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a huge difference between now and Desert Shield, because
that means you can deploy these units and supply them immediately,"
said Owen Cote, associate director of the security studies program at
MIT. "In Desert Shield, the Army basically had to airlift their
divisions and then go back [to the United States and Germany] and
lift the food to support them. Now they have the lift to do it all at
once."</TE>
<TE>   400 Aircraft in Region</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force and the Navy likewise have stepped up their presence
in the Persian Gulf in the last decade. Altogether, more than 400
U.S. aircraft are based in the region.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, U.S. naval vessels have gradually moved into
position. A Navy carrier battle group, consisting of an aircraft
carrier, two cruisers, four destroyers and at least one tactical
submarine, is afloat in the Arabian Sea. A Marine expeditionary unit,
with its own helicopters and supplies to outfit 1,500 Marines for 30
days of ground warfare, also is deployed to the Arabian Sea.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy also has two cruisers and four destroyers in the Persian
Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   In Bahrain, the 5th Fleet, with about 4,200 U.S. military
personnel, is based in the capital, Manama. Since 1991, Bahrain has
granted U.S. forces access to its facilities and the right to
pre-position materiel for future crises.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. also is prepared to move forces from other parts of the
world quickly in the event of an Iraq war. The Pentagon could move in
another aircraft carrier battle group and another Marine
expeditionary unit from the Pacific or the Mediterranean in one to
two weeks. And at least two carriers and two Marine expeditionary
units are ready off the East and West coasts of the U.S. for quick
deployment.</TE>
<TE>   The Army troops most likely to be deployed from the U.S. first in
the event of an Iraq war, military officials said, are from the 4th
Infantry Division, the 1st Cavalry Division, the 82nd Airborne
Division and the 101st Air Assault Division. An Army division also
could move from U.S. bases in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Patriot missile battalions based in the United States would be
deployed to gulf countries that cooperate with U.S. efforts. The
Patriots are the best defense the U.S. has against Scud missile
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In the event of a U.S.-led strike on Iraq, Britain is likely to
play a significant role, according to defense experts. The British
would contribute special forces units, an aircraft carrier group, air
power, armored units and infantry. The British force could number
25,000 troops, plus support personnel, if the U.S. opts for a
full-fledged invasion.</TE>
<TE>   Britain's flagship aircraft carrier, the Ark Royal, set sail
Monday for an exercise in the Mediterranean. Although the mission was
planned long ago, experts say the carrier and its support group will
now be in position to steam quickly toward the gulf.</TE>
<TE>   The carrier could serve as a floating base for aircraft and troops
if political dynamics dictate an operation launched from sea rather
than land bases in gulf states. Some British experts predict that the
U.S. will send four carrier groups to the area to impose a blockade
on Iraq before an outright invasion, said Charles Heyman, editor of
Jane's World Armies.</TE>
<TE>   Britain already has air units in the region flying missions over
Iraq from bases in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. In an attack, Britain
would probably add 25 planes to those aboard the aircraft carrier,
Heyman said.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Americans, British forces have vastly improved their
ability to move troops and weapons around the world quickly and in
bulk, military officials say.</TE>

<TE>   War with Iraq would utilize bases, ports and pre-positioned
equipment. The Pentagon's reluctance to identify some units and types
of equipment because of security concerns makes locating them an
inexact exercise, but here are some of the assets in place so far:</TE>
<TE>   1. TURKEY: Air Force fighters and several thousand personnel at
Incirlik Air Base; reported increases in U.S. ground and air forces
to include Patriot antimissile batteries.</TE>
<TE>   2. JORDAN: Use of several bases and air facilities, including two
very close to the Iraqi border.</TE>
<TE>   3. EGYPT: Cairo West Air Base supports refueling operations; other
ports and airfields to serve as staging positions for any buildup of
operations.</TE>
<TE>   4. SAUDI ARABIA: Command center to direct all air operations in
the region and coordinate intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance information; 70 to 80 fighter planes for patrolling
southern ``no-fly'' zone in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   5. KUWAIT: Army command center; Patriot antimissile system; 70 to
80 fighter planes; equipment for one Army brigade; one training
brigade; helicopter assault equipment; search and rescue personnel;
Special Forces company.</TE>
<TE>   6. BAHRAIN: Marine and Navy command centers; one carrier battle
group with another on the way; Air Force fighters, bombers and
support planes; Navy patrol aircraft and ship surface action group;
2,200 Marines in the region.</TE>
<TE>   7. QATAR: Fighter-bombers, reconnaissance planes and tankers;
hangars for more than 100 aircraft and a 15,000-foot runway; upgraded
command and communications facilities; equipment for one Army brigade
and support units.</TE>
<TE>   8. OMAN: Air base at Masnaah under construction to include a
14,000-foot runway; possible B-1 bombers and air refueling planes;
British special forces training; various other airlift and sea hubs.</TE>
<TE>   9. DIEGO GARCIA: Equipment for an Army and Marine brigade plus a
theater support package to equip multiple divisions; fuel; bombers;
pre-positioned sea-lift ships for Army and Air Force.</TE>

<HD>Study Downplays Nuclear Threat</HD>
<DH>Iraq: Baghdad would need years and foreign help to build a
bomb, experts say. But they see an illegal purchase of raw material
as a risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA and JANET STOBART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Iraq needs several years and extensive foreign assistance to develop
a nuclear weapon, but it could produce one "in a matter of months" if
it acquired raw materials from foreign sources, according to a study
released Monday by a British think tank.</LD>
<LD>   Welcomed by British leaders who regard Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein as an urgent threat, the report by the International
Institute for Strategic Studies was a grim portrait of Iraq's
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons capabilities. Nonetheless,
the findings were less dire than recent warnings by the British and
U.S. governments.</LD>
<LD>   The 74-page dossier examined the risk that U.S. officials have
highlighted in recent days: Hussein's alleged efforts to obtain the
fissile material for building a nuclear device.</LD>
<TE>   "While Iraqi acquisition of fissile material on the black market
is not a high probability, it has to be seen as a real risk that
could dramatically and quickly shift the balance of power," the study
said. Otherwise, it concluded, Iraq would require at least several
more years and substantial amounts of foreign materials and equipment
to build a nuclear bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Tony Blair is striving to convince dubious Britons
of the need to confront Iraq. His government Monday cited the think
tank's assessment as justification for the hard-line stance taken by
Blair and the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   "The IISS dossier is an impressive chronicle," said a spokesman
for the Foreign Office. "It demonstrates that this [weapons] program
continues to this day."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, defense analysts said Blair will have to make a more
convincing case when he presents an official dossier on Iraq's
arsenal, presumably based on intelligence data unavailable to the
think tank, in coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing in Monday's report amounts to compelling justification for
an immediate military strike, said Charles Heyman, editor of Jane's
World Armies.</TE>
<TE>   "It said there was no justification now, but further down the line
there might be," Heyman said. "There was nothing startling, no killer
facts, nothing which says, 'This has got to be done now.' I don't
think the population in the U.K. or the U.S. would want to go to war
against Iraq with the evidence we had this morning."</TE>
<TE>   Research for the study began in June. The authors are former
weapons inspectors and military experts who drew on information from
U.N. inspectors, Iraqi defectors, declassified CIA and Pentagon
reports, and other sources cultivated by the 44-year-old think tank,
institute director John Chipman told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Chipman said his organization did not intend to advocate or oppose
military action, but rather wanted to put forward the best available
facts. He offered a stark summary of the dilemma for U.S. and
European leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "Wait, and the threat will grow," Chipman said. "Strike, and the
threat may be used."</TE>
<TE>   The authors described the development of weapons of mass
destruction as the "core objective" of an Iraqi regime that has
systematically resisted inspections and "sacrificed all other
domestic and foreign policy goals."</TE>
<TE>   Although it is unlikely that Iraq has nuclear weapons, the authors
said, Baghdad's nuclear ambitions and its scientific and technical
expertise have survived war, sanctions, inspections and periodic
airstrikes.</TE>
<TE>   It is not known whether Iraq has rebuilt clandestine nuclear
facilities since U.N. inspectors were forced out in 1998, but the
report said the regime lacks nuclear material for a bomb and the
capability to make weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The "wild card" would be the acquisition of plutonium or enriched
uranium through smuggling or theft, enabling the regime to "produce
nuclear weapons on short order, perhaps in a matter of months."</TE>
<TE>   But Heyman said nuclear material is rigorously protected. And he
added: "To get the fissile material and mate it up with a missile, it
would take over a year."</TE>
<TE>   The authors said the principal menace from Iraq is an array of
biological weapons thought to include anthrax and botulinum toxin
that are capable of causing "hundreds, if not thousands, of
casualties" among civilians in neighboring nations.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has had more success hiding its biological weapons program
than any of its other weapons programs, and Hussein's regime could
have produced thousands of gallons of biological agents since the end
of inspections in 1998, the study said.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's ability to deliver biological and chemical weapons is
uncertain and probably limited, and Hussein has only about a dozen
missiles with a range of 400 miles, the report found. That makes an
attempted sneak attack using aircraft, terrorists or commandos the
most likely option, according to the authors.</TE>
<TE>   As in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, an attack would be likely to
target Israel in hopes of provoking Israeli retaliation and rallying
Arab support.</TE>
<TE>   Western military planners have to calculate Hussein's readiness to
make such deadly and self-destructive decisions, and the willingness
of his military officers to obey his orders if the regime appears
doomed, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the guesswork, there is little doubt about Iraq's appetite
for weapons of mass destruction. If Hussein is left to his own
devices, Chipman said, "sooner or later, it seems likely that the
current Iraqi regime will eventually achieve its objectives."</TE>

<HD>Tribes Flex Power on Sacred Sites</HD>
<DH>Development: A bill on Davis' desk would shield cultural
areas. Foes fear it could quash growth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGG JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A formidable Capitol coalition of local governments, builders and
landowners is feeling the power of California's Native American lobby
in a fight over a bill created to safeguard sacred sites.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Bill 1828 would compel government agencies to notify a
Native American tribe of any proposed development within 20 miles of
its reservation and could require developers to reduce the effects of
such a project.</LD>
<LD>   According to business groups and other opponents, if it is signed
into law, the reality could be an avalanche of lawsuits and endless
development delays. They say economic growth and development in
California are at stake.</LD>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis has until the end of the month to sign or veto the
bill, which the Legislature approved before adjourning Sept. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate's own staff analysis says the bill could cost
businesses and state agencies millions of dollars a year in project
delays.</TE>
<TE>   At the governor's urging, the bill's author, Senate leader John
Burton (D-San Francisco), accepted amendments to address some of
these concerns. Davis' spokeswoman, Hilary McLean, noted the
governor's awareness that business groups still are not satisfied.
She said Davis had not decided whether he would sign the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Ignoring California's Native American tribes is not an easy choice
for any state politician these days.</TE>
<TE>   With casino-generated cash rolling in, the tribes are a
fast-rising political force, plying Davis and other politicians with
millions in campaign contributions and expanding their legislative
interests beyond gambling issues.</TE>
<TE>   The relative ease with which such a controversial bill sailed
through the Legislature attests to growing Indian clout, both
opponents and supporters say.</TE>
<TE>   At every turn, the tribes routed their opponents: The Senate
passed the bill 22 to 10 on May 29. An amended version sailed through
the Assembly in a 53-12 vote Aug. 28. And the Senate approved that
version the next day, 22 to 7, sending the bill to the governor's
desk.</TE>
<TE>   The tribes and their supporters have insisted that SB 1828 is not
as far-reaching as opponents fear.</TE>
<TE>   "If the bill passes, it will help us a lot," said Pauline Jose,
cultural committee chairwoman of the Quechan tribe, whose fight with
Glamis Gold Inc. over a proposed Imperial County strip mine inspired
the bill. "All we want to do is preserve and protect the sacred
sites."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say the prescription imposed by SB 1828 is too extreme.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking against the bill during last month's floor debate, Sen.
Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) held up a map showing that, under the bill,
most new projects in San Diego County would be subject to tribal
vetting.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very fearful of the potential consequences," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents have said the extent of those consequences is not clear
because the definition of "sacred site" is so broad and the location
of existing sites is kept secret to prevent looting. In part, the
bill defines a sacred site as "any geophysical or geographical area
or feature" that "is sacred to Native American tribes by virtue of
its traditional cultural or religious significance or ceremonial use,
or by virtue of a ceremonial or cultural requirement."</TE>
<TE>   The California Native American Heritage Commission maintains an
official list of about 1,500 Indian cultural and religious sites.</TE>
<TE>   Only about 300 of them are religious sites, with an average size
of one-fourth of an acre, said Laura Miranda, a Pechanga Indian and
senior staff attorney for the California Indian Legal Services.</TE>
<TE>   The Burton bill, however, would allow Indians to add more sites to
the list by presenting oral histories or other evidence to support
their claims.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say that could cripple development projects with delays
and lawsuits, such as the Pechanga challenge that has blocked a
proposed San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. transmission line in Riverside
County.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have concerns about the kind of obstacles that could
exist with the language of the bill," said Michael Turner, government
relations manager at the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit
Authority.</TE>
<TE>   A constitutional challenge by business interests is also looming.
Opponents contend that the bill would violate the 1st Amendment by
granting official recognition to Indian religious beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   What concerns many opponents most is that the bill would grant
protection to Indian sacred sites beyond the project review criteria
laid down by the California Environmental Quality Act, the law that
oversees development in the state.</TE>
<TE>   That review process seeks a balance of economic, social and
cultural considerations in weighing whether a project can proceed.
Under the Burton bill, if a developer and a tribe can't agree on how
to safeguard a sacred site threatened by a project, economic
considerations would be eliminated as a valid reason for proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   That would give tribes a de facto veto over most projects,
opponents have said. "The implications could be significant on
infrastructure projects, economic development and job creation," said
Jeanne Cain, vice president of government relations for the
California Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters, however, said Assembly amendments have addressed most
of these concerns. For example, they said tribal veto power has been
eliminated by shifting the final say over projects from the Native
American Heritage Commission--as the bill originally prescribed--to
the local planning commission, city council or county board of
supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, it raises the bar a little bit, but it's not intended
to--and won't--hinder economic development or cost jobs," said Mark
Macarro, tribal chairman of the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians, a
Southern California-based tribe at the forefront of the fight for SB
1828. "All we're saying is, let's be a little more responsible, let's
be a little more judicious about how we go about development."</TE>
<TE>   In a larger sense, Indian leaders and their supporters have said,
the bill is about giving Native American beliefs the same respect and
protection as those of other Californians.</TE>
<TE>   "Current law allows wholesale destruction of tribal sacred sites
and cultural resources," Macarro said. "We've been trying to deal
with this for years, but with the pace of development and the
existing law, we're powerless."</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore, thanks to the growing list of Indian friends in the
Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Reining in property owners and developers is the sort of cause
that has long been associated with Burton and other liberal
Democratic legislators. But in the battle for SB 1828, Burton--a
favorite of Indian tribes dispensing political contributions--has
some unlikely bedfellows.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, there's Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta), an outspoken
property-rights advocate in previous legislative debates. Speaking in
support of the bill, Battin noted that he might have more Indian
tribes in his district than any other senator.</TE>
<TE>   Those tribes have generously supported Battin, giving him nearly
$400,000 in political contributions since January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Battin said the bill is about respecting Native American religious
beliefs, not stopping development.</TE>
<TE>   "I also get contributions from developers and all sorts of people
on both sides of this issue, and my votes are not predicated at all
by political contributions," he said in an interview. "The tribes
have every right to express themselves politically through
contributions."</TE>
<TE>   Another influential Indian ally is veteran Assemblyman Bill
Leonard (R-San Bernardino), a longtime critic of what he
characterizes as the regulatory burden on businesses, except in this
case.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a screaming environmentalist," Burton wryly noted about
his old adversary and newfound ally. "He's not a do-gooder."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard is a frequent recipient of campaign contributions from
Native American tribes, both for his past Assembly campaigns and in
his current quest for a Board of Equalization seat. Term limits
prevent Leonard from remaining in the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   In his Board of Equalization campaign, Leonard has reported
$149,894 in contributions during the first half of 2002. More than
$50,000 came from Native American tribes and their political action
committees.</TE>
<TE>   Like Battin and other supporters of the bill, Leonard has said his
vote had nothing to do with campaign contributions. "I respect
religion, and I believe the Constitution requires us to respect
religion," he said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   He also sympathizes with landowners who would be affected by the
bill, he said. "It's one of these balancing acts that the Legislature
is called upon to do," Leonard said.</TE>
<TE>   Indian tribes are not the only ones contributing heavily in the
debate over SB 1828. Developers, ranchers, growers, construction
companies and energy firms--many of whom oppose the bill--have been
significant campaign contributors to legislators for years.</TE>
<TE>   But Macarro, the Pechanga tribal leader, said campaign
contributions and lobbying are finally giving Native Americans a
voice in shaping public policy. "In this day and age, to be able to
have the resources to draw on to right some of the major inequities
that have occurred over the past 150 years gives us hope," Macarro
said. "There's this legacy of dispossession and disenfranchisement
that now we can do something about."</TE>

<HD>Bible Group Wins Ruling on School Rights</HD>
<DH>Religion: A federal appeals court rules that it must be
treated the same as any other campus club. Experts see a strong
precedent.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>In a case that pitted a Puget Sound area school district against
attorneys from evangelist Pat Robertson's public interest law firm, a
federal appeals court on Monday ruled that a Christian Bible group is
entitled to the same benefits as any other club at school.</LD>
<LD>   The Bible group, World Changers, was formed at Spanaway Lake High
School in the Bethel School District by 11th-grader Tausha Prince.</LD>
<LD>   In February 1998, Prince's parents, with the help of Robertson's
law firm, filed the suit on her behalf, alleging that school
officials denied her club some of the privileges that had been
granted to other clubs. They wouldn't, for example, waive the fee for
the club to appear in the yearbook or let her use the school's
closed-circuit television.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday rejected an April
1999 district court ruling that limited the school's involvement with
the club. Judge Franklin Burgess said that, although the club could
meet on campus and post announcements on school bulletin boards, the
Bible group was ineligible to join the Associated Student Body
because doing so would have violated the separation of church and
state clause of the U.S. Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   The school district contended that it could not admit a club to
the student group without "sponsoring" it. ''This argument fails on a
number of grounds," wrote 9th Circuit Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw.
"Nowhere do the regulations state that the School District itself
approves the constitution and bylaws of each affiliated club." Later
she wrote, "Once the School District establishes a 'limited open
forum,' it must provide the World Changers with equal access to that
forum."</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Choper, a professor at Boalt Hall School of Law at UC
Berkeley and an expert on religious freedom issues, said the decision
by the three-judge panel provides strong precedent for religious
groups in the West. (The 9th Circuit covers California, Washington,
Oregon, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Alaska and Hawaii.)</TE>
<TE>   "It means they can say to schools, 'Anything other clubs get, in
terms of perks and goods, we're entitled to get,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Prince's lawyers argued that by refusing to give the World
Changers the same status as other clubs, Prince's right to free
speech was being denied.</TE>
<TE>   John H. Binns Jr., attorney for the Bethel School District,
disagreed. He said the right of a student to form a club or speak
freely was not at issue.</TE>
<TE>   "My argument was that they didn't want them to say the Spanaway
Lake High School Christian Club because that gave them the imprimatur
of the school, which is against the law," Binns said.</TE>
<TE>   In Monday's ruling, the court rejected Binns' argument.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for both sides said the case had far-reaching political
implications--plaintiff and defendant have become vivid symbols of
the opposing viewpoints on religion in school.</TE>
<TE>   Prince was represented by Robertson's American Center for Law and
Justice, which on its Web site declares itself "dedicated to
defending and advancing religious liberty, the sanctity of human
life, and the two-parent, marriage-bound family." The school district
was supported by the American Civil Liberties Union and the
Anti-Defamation League, both of which filed friends-of-the-court
briefs.</TE>
<TE>   Walter M. Weber, attorney for the American Center for Law and
Justice, said Wardlaw's opinion shows that the courts have not sided
with liberals on the issue of religion in school.</TE>
<TE>   "The ACLU has been very effective in getting across the message
that there has to be separation between religion and school
officials. To an extent, they're right," Weber said. "But the problem
is that many schools overreacted, and they won't allow students to
participate in religious activities. There's a difference between
promoting religion and schools allowing religion."</TE>
<TE>   School officials could not be reached for comment Monday.</TE>

<LD>Important evidence that human stem cells can be implanted and become
part of muscles suggests that muscular dystrophy may yet become
treatable, scientists announced.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery--made because of an odd biomedical
coincidence--showed new cells can infiltrate a person's damaged
muscles, take root and survive for years. This is what is needed, on
a larger scale, to attack the inherited disease.</LD>
<LD>   "This says that we can get those cells recruited" into weakening
muscles, said Dr. Louis Kunkel, of Children's Hospital in Boston.</LD>

<DH>Arrests: Authorities cast their net largely out of public

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Bill Gore was at home shaving the morning of Sept. 11 when his FBI
pager went off. He rushed to the bureau's San Diego office and
launched an investigation that led to the questioning of about 5,000
residents across the southern end of California and the detention of
scores of foreign nationals.</LD>
<LD>   That same day Imad Hamad found himself stranded in Washington by
the nationwide shutdown of airports. A week passed before he made it
home to Dearborn, Mich., where he is a leader in the nation's largest
Arab American community, and he was besieged with requests for help
by families whose sons and husbands had been spirited away by federal
agents.</LD>
<LD>   At the county jail in Kearny, N.J., across the Hudson River from
the World Trade Center, warden Ralph W. Green watched the north tower
collapse. Within days, he was passing out prayer rugs and copies of
the Koran to a new wave of prisoners delivered without explanation by
the federal government.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The FBI man, the community activist and the jailer were among tens
of thousands of people drawn into a still-unfolding American drama
touched off by Sept. 11. A year later, the episode remains largely
hidden from public view, awaiting the judgment of history.</TE>
<TE>   Washington ordered law enforcement officers across the country to
detain and arrest anyone with potential knowledge of the Sept. 11
hijackers or involvement in any other terrorist plots that might be
in the works.</TE>
<TE>   "We moved quickly. We moved really quickly," said a high-level
Justice Department official. "We didn't have the luxury of taking our
time."</TE>
<TE>   In the panic of those initial days, with the arrests of men who
knew the hijackers, who worked at airports, who were caught with box
cutters, it seemed at first they might all be enemies of America.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, very few have been charged with any
terrorism-related offenses. Indeed, as far as is known, none of those
arrested since Sept. 11 has been charged in the destruction at the
World Trade Center or the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Although the arrests were widespread, criticism has mounted only
slowly with the passage of time. Many detainees were held for months
without criminal charges or legal representation. Most apparently
were young Muslim men who came here on various kinds of visas and are
not U.S. citizens.</TE>
<TE>   It was not the most severe restriction of constitutional rights in
U.S. history. President Lincoln detained Confederate supporters and
suspended habeas corpus--the right to a court hearing--during the
Civil War. Most dramatically, President Franklin D. Roosevelt rounded
up more than 100,000 Americans of Japanese descent and held them in
camps for the duration of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   But the latest episode stands out for its secrecy and because it
goes against the legal grain of recent decades, a period when an
untold number of illegal immigrants have won amnesty, the rights of
women and minorities have been explicitly assured, criminal
defendants have won extraordinary legal protections and the Japanese
American internment camps themselves have been deemed repugnant.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, federal judges in at least three cities have tried
to open the proceedings; one derided the secrecy of the detentions as
a "concept odious to a democratic society." The American Bar Assn.
condemned the "incommunicado detention of foreign nationals in
undisclosed locations."</TE>
<TE>   In perhaps the most serious setback for the government, the U.S.
6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati recently ruled that most
immigration hearings must be open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   But the government is appealing these rulings, insisting that the
nation's security is at stake and that authorities need time to
determine whether detainees are dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   For example, several men were arrested in the Detroit area in
September 2001 on visa fraud charges, but it wasn't until last month
that they were named in a terrorism-related indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials insist they are not conducting an
ethnic or religious witch hunt.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't see any case where someone was a Muslim or an Arab, and
was detained just for that," said a top federal prosecutor in San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   But the very secrecy that the government has insisted upon has
made it difficult to judge its actions. It is not possible, for
example, to refute claims by some Arab Americans that 1,000 were
taken into custody in Michigan alone.</TE>
<TE>   By Washington's most recent count, on May 10, 752 of the 1,200
detainees remained in the custody of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. By the end of June, all but 81 of them had
been deported, often with wives and children in tow.</TE>
<TE>   There were also criminal charges filed against 129 of the
detainees. They included a handful of material witness warrants,
alleging some knowledge of circumstances surrounding the Sept. 11
attacks. Most covered federal and state crimes, such as credit card
schemes, forgeries and the illegal possession of firearms.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 129 charged, 72 pleaded guilty and eight were convicted
after trials. Six cases were dismissed. The remainder are pending.</TE>
<TE>   It was an operation that also netted the innocent, the merely
careless, and, as it turned out, the garden-variety criminal.</TE>
<TE>   Hasnain Javed, a Pakistani here on a student visa, was traveling
from Houston to New York when INS agents seized him at a bus station
on Sept. 19.</TE>
<TE>   Because he had overstayed his visa, authorities placed him in a
county jail in Mississippi. There, the sheriff confirmed, Javed was
assaulted by inmates who took him for a terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   Javed, 21, was deported to Karachi in April.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost my life in many ways," he said in a recent interview. "How
many people died on Sept. 11? People lost parents and girlfriends and
brothers. Their lives changed, and so did mine. Everybody's life got
affected."</TE>
<TE>   Raza Khan, also a Pakistani, was arrested Sept. 25 after he was
spotted hunting near a nuclear power plant in the Delaware woods. A
cook, he was charged as an illegal immigrant in possession of a
firearm, a felony.</TE>
<TE>   He spent six months in jail in Philadelphia before pleading guilty
and agreeing to be deported. While he was imprisoned, a roommate ran
up thousands of dollars of purchases on his credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy would never have come to our attention but for 9/11,"
conceded Richard Andrews, a federal prosecutor in Wilmington, Del.</TE>
<TE>   Just four days after Sept. 11, Ali al-Maqtari, a 27-year-old
native of Yemen, accompanied his wife, a U.S. citizen, to Ft.
Campbell, Ky., where she was joining the Army.</TE>
<TE>   Their appearance at the military base raised alarms, and they were
questioned separately by INS and FBI agents. Their car was emptied
and searched by bomb-sniffing dogs. Guards found two box cutters,
letters in Arabic, postcards of the New York City skyline and a
passport from Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Maqtari explained that he used the box cutters in his part-time
job at a grocery. He was held for two months in a jail in Mason,
Tenn., until an immigration judge released him because the INS failed
to prove he was a danger to the community.</TE>
<TE>   Now back home in New Haven, Conn., he works as a substitute French
teacher. His wife, upset with how she and her husband were treated,
was granted an honorable discharge from the Army and works at a
hardware store. The experience still haunts them.</TE>
<TE>   But al-Maqtari insisted: "I don't hate America. It's not the
country that was rude with me. It was certain people who were
ignorant and racist."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SAN DIEGO--Special Agent-in-Charge Bill Gore and his 500-member
FBI staff immediately began working off a master list of hundreds of
people whose backgrounds or ties made them prime candidates for
questioning in any terrorist attack. The names on the so-called watch
list were developed and collected by the INS, the State Department
and other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The field narrowed quickly when two of the 19 hijackers were
identified as former San Diego residents. They briefly took flying
lessons at a private airstrip whose flight path went over the FBI
field office.</TE>
<TE>   "We closed up our gates and had our armored cars out front at our
entrances," Gore recalled. "For the first few days our SWAT teams
were up on the roof. Then we got down to the business of covering
leads and developing information."</TE>
<TE>   They worked for three weeks without any time off, until an agent
collapsed in the briefing room.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't know who all we were looking for at first," Gore said.
"But we went out and talked to people. It was no secret. The
hijackers themselves were listed in the phone book. What was secret
about that? And we were trying to prevent other acts of terror. Just
[by] our presence, through interviews and interrogations and
deportations ... that's what we were trying to do."</TE>
<TE>   Several men who worked at a Texaco station with one of the
hijackers were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Special Agent Daniel Gonzalez, a 12-year bureau veteran,
investigated one of them, Mohdar Abdullah, who also was a student at
San Diego State University.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez learned that Abdullah, a man of many aliases, is a Yemeni
yet claimed to be Somali.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 18, the agent pulled alongside Abdullah, 24, as he neared
a campus parking lot. "I was in my car and stopped in traffic,"
Gonzalez said. "I identified myself as an FBI agent, through my
window."</TE>
<TE>   He said Abdullah agreed to cooperate and told him that he had been
"expecting the FBI to contact him."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez said that he told Abdullah he was not under arrest and
that any statements he made would be voluntary. They drove to a
nearby Denny's restaurant, where Gonzalez and another agent
interviewed him.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah had to attend a class, and they agreed to meet the next
evening. Denny's was full, "so we all walked across the parking lot
next door to the Marie Callender's," Gonzalez said.</TE>
<TE>   They talked some more and met again the following night. But
Gonzalez said the FBI did not believe Abdullah was answering their
questions "truthfully and honestly."</TE>
<TE>   "I felt that he had rehearsed his answers," Gonzalez said. He
"continuously made body movements or gestures to give the impression
... that he knew more than what he was telling."</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah, Gonzalez said, did tell them that the FBI needed "more
knowledge of Islam and the Muslim culture, to include jihad, to
understand the events of Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah consented to take a polygraph test the next morning at
the FBI field office. This time he did not show, the FBI agent said.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours, half a dozen agents arrested Abdullah at gunpoint in
a shopping center parking lot. In his car, Gonzalez said, was a
spiral notebook in an open plastic bag. The notebook, he said,
"contained references to planes falling from the sky, mass killing
and hijacking."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez said Abdullah, while being processed at the field office,
abruptly spoke about "the hatred in his heart" for the U.S. and said
that Americans brought "this"--meaning Sept. 11--upon themselves.</TE>
<TE>   He was taken to New York on a material witness warrant, testified
before the federal grand jury and subsequently pleaded guilty to
providing false information on his visa application. He was ordered
deported.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah, still believed to be behind bars, could not be reached
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Other cases worked by the San Diego office have not held up as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Osama Awadallah, 22, from Jordan, also worked at the Texaco
station, and he too was arrested Sept. 21 on a material witness
warrant. He was transferred to New York to testify before a grand
jury.</TE>
<TE>   In February, in one of the rare open courtroom appearances for a
Sept. 11 detainee, Awadallah took the witness stand in New York. He
spoke in broken English and through a court interpreter. He told the
federal judge that the FBI in San Diego pressured him to take a
polygraph test, then told him he had failed.</TE>
<TE>   He said the agents told him, "Look, you are lying.... You have to
tell us the truth.... You are going to be turned [over] to prison for
five years and [we will] take you to New York. You want to correct
[your statements].... Want to say the truth?"</TE>
<TE>   "You are one of the terrorists," he said the agents told him. "You
did this.... Just tell us the truth. We want to save you, we are your
friend."</TE>
<TE>   And then just as quickly, he said, they added this threat: "There
is nobody [who] can hurt you except us."</TE>
<TE>   The conflicting signals confused Awadallah, he said, so much that
he told the grand jury he did not know one of the San Diego
hijackers, yet then admitted he knew the other. Then he conceded he
knew both men. His flip-flop led to a perjury charge.</TE>
<TE>   Awadallah also told the judge he was mistreated in the federal
detention center in San Diego, prevented from following his religious
practices and strip-searched 15 times.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so scared and I was afraid," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His story persuaded the federal judge to dismiss the perjury
charge and release him. The judge concluded that the FBI had tricked
Awadallah into lying about his association with the two San Diego
hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   The government is seeking to have the charges reinstated.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities refused to say how many people were detained in San
Diego. But Gore said four individuals were arrested on material
witness warrants alleging they had crucial information about Sept. 11
and might flee. Three ultimately testified before the New York grand
jury. One has since voluntarily returned to his home country, two
others are facing deportation and another is appealing his removal.</TE>
<TE>   Gore said his agents concentrated on developing background
information about the two San Diego hijackers. They talked with
employers and fellow workers, and they interviewed neighbors and
friends and instructors at the Montgomery Field airstrip.</TE>
<TE>   "That's police work. That's what it's all about. To call it racial
profiling is extremely naive," Gore said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DEARBORN, Mich.--By the time Imad Hamad could make it home, his
telephone answering machine was full at the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee, where he is regional director. Most of
the calls were hateful, spewing epithets such as "Death to you
towel-headed ... "</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of others were from his neighbors, mostly women whose
husbands and sons had been suddenly detained by federal agents. They
were desperate for legal and financial help.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation was chaos," he said. "All over town."</TE>
<TE>   Many residents were afraid to leave their houses, to go to work,
to ride the buses. Families were encouraged to order food in, to keep
the children out of school, to go in groups if they had to go out at
all.</TE>
<TE>   Agents were fanning out, knocking on doors, going to places of
business, handcuffing detainees.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no special hour, no special time," Hamad said. "And who
knew the consequences? Because if you have trouble, God help you."</TE>
<TE>   About half a million Muslims live in Michigan, and the Detroit
suburb of Dearborn is 30% Arab American; at the public schools, the
figure is 70%. Many came here after World War II to take assembly
jobs in the auto plants. Hamad arrived as a young political refugee
from Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   It's a community that has long reflected the tensions of the
Middle East, even as many of its members sought out citizenship in
their adopted country, swore allegiance to it and successfully
assimilated into its economy. Indeed, on Monday, Hamad, at age 41,
became a U.S. citizen at a ceremony in Dearborn.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks and their aftermath confronted the community
with difficult truths about their former homelands as well as their
new one. None seemed more disturbing than the actions of a U.S.
Secret Service agent as he searched a Dearborn home.</TE>
<TE>   "Islam is evil," the agent scrawled on a calendar posted on the
kitchen refrigerator. "Christ is King."</TE>
<TE>   The agent was suspended for six months without pay, said Jeffrey
G. Collins, the U.S. attorney in Detroit, who declared: "This type of
unprofessional behavior will not be tolerated."</TE>
<TE>   But the sentiment of a man acting as an official representative of
the U.S. government is not easily erased.</TE>
<TE>   "Things became a state of real anger here," recalled Mohamad Ali
Elahi, the imam at the Islamic House of Wisdom. "It directly insulted
the faith of Islam. How somebody can do this is total ignorance."</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence that this behavior was the norm as federal
agents went about contacting and detaining immigrants, and some local
Islamic leaders credit Collins for reaching out to the community as
fears spread.</TE>
<TE>   But complaints came to a head in July, when Hamad and a dozen
other Arab American leaders told the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
at a meeting in downtown Detroit that closed court hearings, lengthy
detentions and the overall secrecy of the arrests were unfair.</TE>
<TE>   Ismael Ahmed runs an Arab community center. "We have people
disappearing," he told the panel. "We don't even know who disappears
anymore. We still do not have the names and addresses and the charges
against these people."</TE>
<TE>   The commission took no action. One commissioner, President Bush
appointee Peter Kirsanow, commented that if there is another massive
terrorist attack, "you can forget civil rights in this country"
because a groundswell of public opinion would favor World War
II-style internment camps.</TE>
<TE>   For now, he said, "it makes perfect sense for law enforcement
authorities to focus their attention where they see the greatest
risk. To do otherwise would be ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Just how many men eventually were detained in Dearborn is not
known. Some local civil rights groups estimate that more than 1,000
in Michigan were detained and that the INS conducted more than 650
closed deportation hearings. They contend that nationwide, the
government detained far more than the officially acknowledged 1,200.</TE>
<TE>   But, Hamad said, "nobody can give you an exact figure. It's like a
wonder to all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Zouhair Koubeissi is back home with his wife and new baby boy,
Ali, in Auburn Hills, another Detroit suburb. He was picked up in the
spring and served 17 days--10 of them in a small holding tank with
dozens of other men --after authorities said his visa status was not
in order and noticed that he had taken flying lessons in the early
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "So they came to get me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested at the Detroit airport where he works as a
limousine driver.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Nivine, was home alone, still pregnant then, and at 7 in
the morning, he said, "they came to the house and searched
everything. She was startled and afraid. She didn't know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, 39, in this country from Lebanon since 1984, cringed
at recalling his time in jail. "I didn't see the sun or air for 10
straight days," he said. "I'd never cried before in my life. I was
sick, had a virus, a leg fungus and a blood vessel broke. My knees
and ankles were swollen. I couldn't walk for a month. I was on
medicine for two months. I lost two months' work."</TE>
<TE>   To raise the $15,000 bail and pay his lawyers, he has had to
borrow from friends, "a lot of good American friends," he said. But
he considers it a good fight. His son is an American citizen, and "I
never want to go back" to the Middle East, where he said he was
treated badly by the Syrians and the Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody loves this country like I do," he said. "But all of a
sudden you're treated like a criminal."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the detainees from Dearborn have been deported or remain
behind bars, somewhere in this country, and it has fallen to their
families to worry about their fates.</TE>
<TE>   Farouk Ali-Haimoud, 22, was taken into custody Sept. 17 and
implicated with several others in a visa and identification fraud
case. They came under suspicion for staying at a Detroit apartment
once occupied by an alleged associate of Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   (That suspect, Nabil al-Marabh, was arrested in Illinois soon
after Sept. 11. Last Tuesday, he was ordered held until January and
then to be deported to Syria on immigration violations. Federal
authorities have said they could not link him to terrorism.)</TE>
<TE>   As for the others arrested at his apartment, part of the
government's evidence is material allegedly found there that includes
falsified immigration documents and notes in Arabic about an airport
in Jordan and a U.S. air base in Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on Aug. 28, a federal grand jury in Detroit indicted the
group for allegedly providing material support or resources to a
terrorist organization linked to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever comes of the case, it illustrates the uncertainty that
has descended upon countless families since the arrests began.
Ali-Haimoud's mother, Meriem Ladjadj, lost her job as an instructor
at a business college; she believes the school let her go because of
her son's troubles.</TE>
<TE>   The family is from Algeria, and Ladjadj has reconciled herself to
returning,  because her money soon will be gone. She fears she is a
failure in her family's eyes. She said she immigrated to the United
States to make a life of her own and to send money to relatives back
home.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here to keep my dignity, my Islamic way of life," she
said, crying. "I also wanted to be a strong woman. My grandmother
taught me to be strong. And now I feel like I did not do a good job
on my son, my only son."</TE>
<TE>   But she defends him and said he barely knew the other men in the
apartment and had stayed there just one night.</TE>
<TE>   She's selling much of her furniture and the family's two cars to
help pay her son's legal bills, and once a week, dutifully, she
visits Ali-Haimoud at the Wayne County Jail. They see each other
through a window and chat over an intercom.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning, they wouldn't let me see him," she said in an
interview at her three-bedroom brick home in Dearborn, where much of
the furniture is already tagged or sold.</TE>
<TE>   "I miss him so badly. His sister misses him so badly. She cries
every night. She is doing badly in school. Every time I go to see him
he asks about her. He used to sit and do her homework with her. And I
tell him she is doing fine. I lie to my son."</TE>
<TE>   After about a month in jail, he was suddenly released. But, she
said, "the neighbors were staring at him. Kids threw rocks at the
house. There were bad names and our house was splashed in the
newspaper, and they showed the address real big on the TV."</TE>
<TE>   Then he was rearrested in April on similar visa fraud charges and
in August came the indictment. She still tries to visit him every
week.</TE>
<TE>   "One time they let me see him for an hour," she said. "That was
the happiest day of my life."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEARNY, N.J.--Gray ash blown across the river from the destroyed
World Trade Center still clung to the Hudson County Correctional
Facility when the first Muslim prisoners arrived.</TE>
<TE>   They were not typical county prisoners. In a jail where the guards
do not carry firearms, many of the detainees were brought here in
shackles, delivered by armored vehicles and surrounded by SWAT teams.
Yet prison officials marveled at how meek and well-behaved the
inmates generally were.</TE>
<TE>   "These people had never been in jail before," said Marcy
Dressler-Gassert, the jail caseworker for the Sept. 11 detainees.
"They'd never been in trouble before. From what I could tell, they
were not the kind of people out looking for trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of the men taken into custody in the post-Sept. 11 sweeps
would spend weeks or months here. Ralph W. Green, the jail director,
said he still has about 300 federal prisoners and assumes--but
doesn't know for sure--that many of them are terrorism detainees.</TE>
<TE>   An INS official in Newark, N.J., phoned on Sept. 13 to say they
needed 80 beds right away, recalled jail administrator Kelvin
Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   "The INS was in crisis. They had a bunch of suspected terrorists,
or whatever, and their prison facility in New York was closed because
of the attacks," he said. "We stepped up to help them."</TE>
<TE>   The secrecy surrounding the status of detainees extended even into
the jail. They were booked with a single page of paperwork with
little more than a name and number. No one on the 600-member jail
staff was to know which inmates were Sept. 11 detainees and which
were federal prisoners on unrelated charges.</TE>
<TE>   But it was not hard to figure out. Guards noticed that the
detainees picked leaders among themselves in the two-story
cellblocks. The leaders conducted prayer sessions five times a day,
beginning around 4 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   While some detainees stayed for months, others were moved in and
out of the facility by federal officials. At times it seemed almost
like a shell game, with prisoners taken away for court hearings or
transfers or one-way trips home.</TE>
<TE>   Or released altogether. One detainee, who was moved out under
heavy guard by federal agents in the morning, returned alone to the
front gate that afternoon--a free man. He had come back to pick up
his personal property.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess he wasn't such a bad guy," said Kurt L. Thoens, the jail
executive assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Another time, warden Green allowed a group of Islamic imams from
New Jersey into the cellblocks. He staged a special "Muslim Day" for
the detainees, with family members and food and prayer services.</TE>
<TE>   Green's jail was the site of the only known in-custody death of a
Sept. 11 detainee.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammed Fafiq Butt, a 56-year-old Pakistani being held on
immigration charges, was found dead in his two-man cell on Oct. 23.
An employee of a New York restaurant, he had been detained on Sept.
19 by INS agents. The official cause of death was a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   "At first we thought it might have been anthrax," said Green,
noting that during the anthrax scare letters laced with the poison
had been mailed from New Jersey. "We called in the hazmat people to
scrub the cell down."</TE>
<TE>   Green and his staff found 20 activists with Amnesty International
marching in front of the jail. And Human Rights Watch investigators,
who interviewed Butt's cellmate, alleged that Butt had made requests
for medical care that went unanswered.</TE>
<TE>   But the only complaints from this docile group stemmed from their
uncertain futures, said Dressler-Gassert.</TE>
<TE>   "They understood why they were here," she said. "But they were
upset because they were detained, and angry about the length of time
they were being held. And for some, it dragged on and on. They wanted
to know where they were going. 'Somewhere?' 'Anywhere?' "</TE>

<CX>   Detainees--A story in Tuesday's A section on the detention of
terrorism suspects reported that Japanese Americans placed in U.S.
internment camps were held for the duration of World War II. In fact,
the U.S. government issued a proclamation Dec. 17, 1944, ending the
mass imprisonment. However, according to the Japanese American
National Museum, only one of the 10 main camps, in Denson, Ariz., was
closed before the war ended with Japan's surrender on Aug. 14, 1945.
The rest of the camps closed over the period from October 1945 to
March 1946.</CX>

<HD>Conch Found Near Florida Keys Wreck Yields Emerald Treasure</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KEY WEST, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A diver has discovered the treasure of a lifetime--a 40.2-carat
emerald embedded in a conch shell--while diving at the site of a
Spanish galleon wrecked in a Florida Keys hurricane 380 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The part-time wreck diver, who teaches elementary school in
northern Florida but does not want to reveal his name, discovered the
giant raw emerald while washing shells in a classroom laboratory.</LD>
<LD>   "Out popped a 40.2-carat emerald," said Patrick Clyne, vice
president at Key West-based salvage company Mel Fisher Enterprises.</LD>
<TE>   "It was one of those freak-of-nature things that somehow got swept
up in the conch shell."</TE>
<TE>   The diver had gathered the shells from a dive off the Spanish
galleon Santa Margarita, which sank Sept. 6, 1622, about 30 miles off
Key West, an island city at Florida's southern tip.</TE>

emeralds smuggled aboard the ship," Clyne said. "There were no
emeralds listed on its cargo manifest."</TE>

<DH>Anniversary: Americans will mark a solemn date in many
different ways, times and places.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Even those who decline to watch the inevitable replay of planes
barreling into buildings will have a hard time forgetting what day it
is Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Sept. 11 will stare back from the face of a wristwatch, the page
of a calendar, the bottom of the computer screen, the top of the
morning newspaper--an anniversary demanding recognition from a
country not quite sure how to give it. And there will be little rhyme
or reason to how most people choose to remember a date few had the
chance to forget.</LD>
<LD>   An eternal flame will light in New York, bells will peal in
Alaska, porch lights will burn in Kansas. Some neighbors in a suburb
of Washington will march in a makeshift parade; in Orlando, Fla.,
they'll gather with candles at dusk on their front lawns. San
Franciscans will line up to give blood. SWAT teams in Indiana will
demonstrate their public safety prowess. Buses and trains will run
with headlights on in Atlanta; Houston; San Mateo; Charlotte, N.C.;
and Spokane, Wash. Firetrucks will blow their horns in Waco, Texas.
In Honolulu, thousands of children will spell "Aloha 9/11" on a
stadium field. And all over the country, pulpits will stir with words
of comfort.</LD>
<TE>   "Most anniversaries have a culturally relevant tradition that
tells us the right way to do it--a visit to a grave, a cake for a
birthday--and not a tremendous amount of innovation is required,"
said Paul Ofman, a New York psychologist at RHR International, a
management consulting firm. "Here we have no tradition, nothing to
hold on to. As a nation, we'll have to figure out what works."</TE>
<TE>   Honoring Sept. 11 is a national duty that came with no set of
instructions; a collective bowing of heads with no director. The
observances will move haphazardly through the day, much as the
tragedy did, with the ceremonies most sweeping in New York,
Washington and Pennsylvania, the sites of destruction.</TE>
<TE>   At 8:46 a.m., about the moment of the first attack, five
bagpipe-and-drum processions marching from each of New York's
boroughs will arrive at ground zero as the city pauses for a moment
of silence. Gov. George Pataki will recite the Gettysburg Address;
former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will lead a reading of the names of
the nearly 3,000 who died at the towers. Taps will play.</TE>
<TE>   Although the World Trade Center site will be the focus of the
commemoration, virtually none of New York's cultural institutions,
houses of worship, fire stations or community organizations intend to
pass the day without note. Even Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship store
has emptied its windows, leaving only signs that say "We Remember."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, a day of memorial will begin at the National
Cathedral with an 8 a.m. interfaith service led by Archbishop Desmond
Tutu. A bell will toll at the time of each attack.</TE>
<TE>   But the eyes of the capital will focus on the Pentagon, the point
of impact restored by workers who labored around the clock for much
of the last year. About 12,000 people, including President Bush--who
will fly to New York afterward--and several survivors and kin of
victims are expected to turn out for a moment of silence at 9:37
a.m., about the time the plane struck. The huge flag that hung over
the building's wounds that day will be reinstalled at the same spot.</TE>
<TE>   In Pennsylvania, as many as 50,000 are expected at a memorial for
United Flight 93's passengers, whose rebellion probably foiled an
attack on a fourth building. White House staffers, who believe that
plane may have been headed their way, intend to gather on the
mansion's lawn in special tribute.</TE>
<TE>   Surely, the day will be hardest for survivors and relatives of
those who perished. Though some planned to return to the sites,
others cannot stay far enough away. Among those who will be present
at the Pentagon is Wayne Sinclair, 55, who installs computers for the
Army and who was severely burned that day.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, I've found it's better to discuss this and get it off
your mind," he said. "But some people can't. Too many hard memories.
Several say they are staying home, not going to work or anything.
They just want to be by themselves and kind of sit and relax and
don't think about the day."</TE>
<TE>   But it will be difficult not to. Television coverage will continue
round-the-clock. The memorials will stretch through the week with
displays of acknowledgment so eclectic that from afar, it might look
like the Fourth of July.</TE>
<TE>   Singers Roberta Flack and Randy Travis will perform at
Constitution Hall. An enormous flag will cover the U.S. Capitol lawn.
Three blocks from the White House, a candlelight vigil will fill
Freedom Plaza. Fireworks will light the sky in Des Moines. An
American bald eagle named Freedom--once injured but nursed back to
health--will be released into the wilds of Missouri. Corporations in
Chicago will suspend their dress codes so employees can wear red,
white and blue.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, Sept. 11 was an attack on the American workplace--the
towers, the Pentagon, the planes themselves--and businesses are
finding diverse ways to help workers cope. Some firms have disallowed
travel on Sept. 11 out of caution; some have made travel voluntary
while others are holding to business as usual as a symbol of the
nation's corporate strength, according to the Human Resources
Management Assn. of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   But as the day approaches, the notion of normalcy seems
far-fetched. Even the weather--clear, and crisp and blue in the
East--serves as a reminder of that pre-autumn day. Authors have
scheduled inspirational readings at bookstores. Churches have
promised to keep their doors open all day for meditation and prayer.</TE>
<TE>   Renewed anger seems inevitable, and some will use the day to urge
tolerance. Next to an Italian restaurant in a fading strip mall
outside St. Louis, the Islamic Information Center plans an open house
throughout the afternoon, with a nearby mosque conducting a unity
prayer service at dusk.</TE>
<TE>   "For many, the anniversary will be so large, so sadness-inducing,
so anxiety-provoking, people should not be surprised to find
themselves more emotional, preoccupied, deep in thought and
reflective--and unsure what to do with all of it," psychologist Ofman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Moments of silence seem a common form of acknowledgment. But with
no single hour designated, the quiet promises to fall in random
patches across four time zones. San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown
plans to arrive at City Hall before dawn to observe the approximate
time of the first attack--5:46 a.m. on the West Coast. In Sacramento,
a ceremony at the state Capitol will fall silent precisely three
hours later. A Midwestern university chose midmorning to mark the
first tower's collapse. Los Angeles settled on noon.</TE>
<TE>   Already, there are calls for continuity. Nearly 200,000 people
have signed a Web site petition asking to declare Sept. 11 a national
holiday. Others favor a single synchronized minute when the entire
nation would pause, freeways would come to a halt, drivers would step
out of their cars, TV stations would go dark and radio airwaves mute.</TE>
<TE>   But until then, plaques will be dedicated and trees planted. The
ranks of three women who have stood with flags on a boulevard in
Tampa, Fla., every Friday afternoon since Sept. 11 are expected to
swell to 30,000.</TE>
<TE>   Children will release doves, college students will form a human
flag, symphonies will play a worldwide rolling performance of
Mozart's "Requiem" in each time zone, and the Baltimore Orioles will
wear a Pentagon-shaped patch of stars and stripes when they play the
New York Yankees on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   One family in Arlington, Va., will ceremonially remove the paper
flag that has been posted for a year on its front door. People who
thought they had read and watched all they could stand will read and
watch some more. And every household in every town will be left to
sort out what to do with itself on a day when it will be difficult to
think about anything else.</TE>

<HD>Study: Thousands to Lose HMO Aid</HD>
<DH>Health: At least 200,000 seniors will be dropped when
providers opt out of Medicare, survey says. Few withdrawals are
expected in California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>At least 200,000 older Americans will lose their Medicare HMO
coverage next year, while many more will face significant cuts in
benefits, officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Though not unexpected, the estimates of further attrition in the
Medicare+Choice plan highlight the growing divide between Medicare
coverage and the health care needs of the 40 million Americans age 65
and older.</LD>
<LD>   More than a third of Medicare beneficiaries have no coverage for
prescription drugs, the fastest-growing health care cost. And
increasing numbers of physicians and health maintenance
organizations, citing insufficient payments from the government, are
dropping Medicare patients or refusing to accept new ones.</LD>
<TE>   The American Assn. of Health Plans, the trade organization for
more than 1,000 HMOs, released its annual survey of Medicare+Choice
enrollment on the last day that participating HMOs could reveal their
plans for next year.</TE>
<TE>   More specific information, including which plans will drop
Medicare patients and how many Medicare recipients will have their
benefits reduced, will not be available until the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services compiles the HMO data, expected in
about five weeks. But several of California's leading HMOs, which
have a combined Medicare enrollment of more than 1.2 million, said
they are planning few, if any, withdrawals.</TE>
<TE>   "The groundwork has been set for a turnaround of Medicare+Choice,"
said Karen Ignagni, AAHP president and chief executive, noting that
the number of beneficiaries expected to be dropped next year is far
below the 536,000 who lost coverage at the beginning of this year.
Since 1999, 2.2 million Medicare beneficiaries have lost coverage
from plans that were "forced to drop out" of the program because of
inadequate government funding, she said.</TE>
<TE>   AARP, the 35-million-member advocacy group for older Americans,
had predicted that as many as 600,000 beneficiaries could be dropped
from Medicare+Choice next year, but it said Monday that the actual
number would likely fall somewhere between the 200,000 cited by AAHP
and its own estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the final number, the continued withdrawal of HMOs sends
a "further signal to Medicare beneficiaries that they can't count on
these plans," said AARP policy director John Rother.</TE>
<TE>   Looking for a way to control Medicare spending, Congress created
the Medicare+Choice program in 1997, predicting that by this year,
almost a third of Medicare beneficiaries would be enrolled in HMOs.
Medicare+Choice plans, which contract with private HMOs, are an
alternative to the traditional Medicare plan, which has significant
gaps in its coverage and could result in high out-of-pocket expenses
for seniors without supplemental "Medigap" insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, the plans offered "terrific value," especially to
low-income seniors, by providing preventive care, disease management
and prescription drug coverage, Rother said. But as HMOs have cut
back on benefits or dropped out of the program altogether, its
advantages over conventional fee-for-service Medicare have nearly
disappeared. Only about 10% of Medicare beneficiaries now belong to
HMOs, and that number is falling.</TE>
<TE>   For Congress, already under fire from seniors for failing to pass
a minimum $350-billion prescription drug benefit, Medicare HMOs
represent another health-care provider crying out for more government
money--and they are likely to get at least some of it.</TE>
<TE>   "No one's given up on the issue of prescription drugs," said Mike
Siegel, Democratic spokesman for the Senate Finance Committee, "but
it's clear that ... we will be looking at Medicare
givebacks"--increased payments to doctors, hospitals, nursing homes
and other providers.</TE>
<TE>   Robert M. Hayes, president of the New York-based Medicare Rights
Center, on Monday called on Congress to "fill the coverage gaps in
Medicare and enact a meaningful prescription drug plan immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, with midterm elections less than two months away,
Congress is more likely to provide at least $30 billion to Medicare
providers, which have been lobbying strongly for higher reimbursement
rates. Congressional aides acknowledge that paying the
providers--instead of putting money toward programs that benefit
consumers--could be a hard sell with seniors as they go to the voting
booth.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser Permanente, California's largest Medicare HMO with 621,000
members, declined to specify where it was pulling back next year, but
it said the move would affect fewer than 2,500 people.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser also would not comment on premium increases or benefit
changes that it is seeking for next year. This year, it increased
Medicare co-payments for brand-name prescription drugs to $25 from
$10 and limited the overall drug benefit to $2,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Health Net Inc. said Monday that its withdrawals in Alameda and
Santa Barbara counties would affect fewer than 1,000 of its 188,000
Medicare beneficiaries. "The business is profitable," said spokesman
David Olson.</TE>

<HD>Critics Say Terror Probe Bends Immigration Laws</HD>
<DH>Rights: With few results from the INS' hard-line tactics
against suspects, critics voice outrage on policy of covert hearings
and deportation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the last year, the Bush administration has made aggressive use of
immigration law to arrest and detain more than 1,200 suspects in its
terrorism investigation, a legal strategy that has proved effective
even as the investigation itself has come up largely empty.</LD>
<LD>   Muslim men have been rounded up, denied lawyers and brought before
judges in secret hearings outside the view of the public and the
media. Many were held for weeks or months. And in the end, none of
these immigrants has been charged with a crime related to the Sept.
11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Civil libertarians have been outraged by what they say are
police-state tactics. Yet they have been unable so far to win a
single case to show that the government violated the law. That's
because immigrants who violate the terms of their visas have few
rights under American law.</LD>
<TE>   The government's basic strategy: If an arrest is challenged, the
detainee is simply deported.</TE>
<TE>   "They just deport the person rather than justify holding them,"
said Lee Gelernt, an immigration law expert for the American Civil
Liberties Union. "It's a Catch-22. There is no legal ruling because
the government moots out the case."</TE>
<TE>   "We have been scrambling for a way to contest these [detentions],
but nobody has come up with a good way to challenge them," said
Jeanne Butterfield, executive director of the American Immigration
Lawyers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials admit they have used the immigration laws
aggressively, and they are proud of it.</TE>
<TE>   "The question you have to ask is: Can we afford to sit back and
wait for people to commit a terrorist act ... or instead, should we
utilize all the authorities of the U.S. government to intercept and
disrupt and deter individuals who may be linked to terrorist
organizations?" said Russ Bergeron, a spokesman for the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft chose a strike-first
strategy of arresting and holding any person who might have ties to a
terrorist group. Immigration law has been the main tool.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens who are arrested must be charged with a crime and, if
they face jail time, offered a lawyer. By contrast, noncitizens who
are arrested on an immigration violation are not entitled to a
lawyer. And even a minor, technical violation can result in their
deportation.</TE>
<TE>   "The government has tremendous authority over the lives of
immigrants," said Georgetown University law professor David D. Cole.</TE>
<TE>   INS officials say they have strictly enforced the law but not
exceeded it. Most people who enter the country are limited in what
they can do and how long they can stay.</TE>
<TE>   "If you come into this country on a 90-day visa, you have violated
the conditions of your admission on the 91st day, and you are
deportable," Bergeron said. "If you come in on a visitor's visa or a
student visa and are working, you have violated the conditions of
your entry."</TE>
<TE>   The INS says it arrested and detained 752 immigrants for
questioning as part of the Sept. 11 investigation. The vast majority
were held on immigration charges, INS officials say.</TE>
<TE>   In some instances, officials found that the immigrants had
criminal records. Under a 1996 law, that made them automatically
subject to deportation.</TE>
<TE>   These mass arrests and secret detentions seem to conflict with the
basic principles of American justice. The Constitution says no person
in the United States can be "deprived of liberty ... without due
process of law." The Supreme Court has made clear this right extends
to noncitizens. Those who are held in custody can file a writ of
habeas corpus asking a judge to hear their case.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, a habeas hearing can put the government on trial.
Prosecutors must show that the arrest and detention of a person was
lawful.</TE>
<TE>   Civil libertarians question whether FBI agents had evidence to
justify arresting many of these immigrants. They also say an
immigrant's right to due process of law is violated when he or she is
brought secretly before a judge without a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, these basic claims have gone unlitigated. When
immigration lawyers have tried to contest the detentions, the
government has exercised its broad powers to deport. When the
detainee leaves the country, the legal challenge to his detention
goes away too.</TE>
<TE>   In April, for example, ACLU lawyers filed a writ of habeas corpus
to challenge the continued detention of an Egyptian seaman, Sami
Mohammed El Maghrabi Saad. He was arrested at a relative's home in
Staten Island, N.Y., three weeks after Sept. 11 and held in New
Jersey county jails.</TE>
<TE>   "No person can be jailed without legal authority, and the
Constitution compels the government to release him," his lawyers told
a judge. But rather than try to justify holding him, the INS deported
Saad a few weeks later, ending the case.</TE>
<TE>   As a fallback strategy, the civil libertarians have challenged the
procedures used by the INS, in particular the secrecy surrounding the
hearings and the detainees.</TE>
<TE>   They won their biggest victory on Aug. 26 when a U.S. appeals
court ruled that the newspapers in Detroit had a free-press right
under the 1st Amendment to cover a bond hearing for Rabih Haddad, a
widely known Muslim leader detained after Sept. 11 on the suspicion
that his charitable fund-raising might have supported terrorist
activities.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Damon J. Keith of the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals,
siding with the ACLU and the Detroit newspapers, said "the public's
interests are best served by open proceedings ... with a vigorous and
scrutinizing press."</TE>
<TE>   He stressed, however, that the case before the appeals court dealt
only with whether the hearings can be closed to the public, not
whether the government could detain or deport such immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge in Washington has ruled that the Freedom of
Information Act requires the Justice Department to release the names
of those detained as part of the terrorism investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these setbacks, administration lawyers remain confident
they can win reversals at the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   But Cole, of Georgetown, argues that the government has bent the
law since Sept. 11, even if it has not violated it.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a classic example of pretextual law enforcement.
They have come up with some legal grounds under the immigration law,"
he said. "And look at the results after a year. Not a single person
charged with being ... involved in a terrorism crime."</TE>

<HD>Getting the Word Out on Islam</HD>
<DH>Education: A Muslim group hopes to combat myths,
misinformation with a national book campaign modeled after a local
grass-roots effort.</DH>

<AU>RANDY TRICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Using a successful Southern California program as a model, an Islamic
advocacy group launched a campaign Monday to combat myths and
misinformation about Muslims that many believe have become more
prevalent since Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The yearlong effort will fight inaccurate information by donating
books, videos and DVDs with unbiased information to libraries across
the nation, said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on
American-Islamic Relations.</LD>
<LD>   "Most books written [about Islam] are inaccurate," Awad said. "We
believe that the serious lack of information about Islam is causing
our nation to be divided."</LD>
<TE>   The national campaign, in which the public can purchase a package
of 18 books and videotapes for donation to a local library, is a
response to attacks against the Muslim religion and a heightened
curiosity in the faith since Sept. 11, Awad said.</TE>
<TE>   The council's Southern California chapter began a similar project
last year, before the terrorist attacks, largely because local
libraries did not have books that Muslim parents could use to teach
their children about their faith. Instead, the parents found books
full of inaccuracies.</TE>
<TE>   "The parents wanted to pull the books from the libraries, and we
said, 'Absolutely not,' " said Hussam Ayloush, director of the
Anaheim-based chapter. "Instead, we wanted to provide the libraries
with accurate books."</TE>
<TE>   The grass-roots campaign was able to donate about 740 items to the
Los Angeles County library system, said Peter Persic, the library's
public information director. He noted a definite increase in demand
for materials relating to the issues surrounding the terror attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "There has always been a steady and strong interest in Islam, and
it has always been hard to keep materials stocked," Persic said.
"Once new materials arrive, they fly off the shelf."</TE>
<TE>   The national campaign will work much like the California campaign;
anyone, Muslim or not, may purchase the package from the Council on
American-Islamic Relations (at www.cair-net.org/libraryproject) for
donation to a local library. Donors can designate a library or let
the organization choose one. The cost of each package is $150.</TE>
<TE>   According to Ayloush, the Southern California program was
successful; 166 libraries received 2,500 items, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The national campaign hopes to provide 16,000 libraries with the
books and tapes.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, the Muslim community has seen a rise in attacks
against the Islamic faith, rather than against violent extremists,
militants or fundamentalists, said Ibrahim Hooper, the council's
communications director. Other religions don't share that situation,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When someone wants to go to a mosque in Hebron and massacre
worshippers, you're not going to say, 'That's Judaism,' because you
know what Judaism is. When the [Irish Republican Army] blows up pubs
in Northern Ireland, of course you say, 'That's obviously not
Catholicism,' " Hooper said. "But people don't know what Islam is."</TE>
<TE>   One book included in the package, "Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood
Vilifies a People," examines how the media portray the Islamic faith.
The book's author, Jack G. Shaheen, helped launch the campaign
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "In American cinema, the only good Arab Muslim is a dead Arab
Muslim," Shaheen said.</TE>
<TE>   Having Hollywood and other pop-culture outlets display the Islamic
faith fairly is especially critical in shaping children's
understanding of the culture, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other books in the package include the Koran, in both Arabic and
English; explanations of the text; two documentaries about Islam from
PBS and ABC News; a history of mosque architecture; and "The Complete
Idiot's Guide to Understanding Islam."</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, Ayloush hopes the new national campaign
will further boost his local program.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always easier and more efficient for a local chapter to
reach out to the local community," he said. "The national office will
initiate the momentum, and the local chapter will follow through."</TE>

<HD>Florida Governor's Contest Tops Slate of Key Primaries</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Janet Reno made a last-minute pitch to voters Monday as she tried to
stop political novice Bill McBride from pulling off a major upset in
the race for the Democratic nomination for governor of Florida.</LD>
<LD>   The winner of today's primary will face first-term Republican Gov.
Jeb Bush in November.</LD>
<LD>   In all, 12 states will select candidates for governor, House and
Senate on the busiest day of the election season yet.</LD>
<TE>   McBride, a Tampa lawyer, went from obscurity in January to a dead
heat in the polls against former President Clinton's attorney
general.</TE>
<TE>   McBride has been more successful raising money and has bought more
television time than his opponent. He also gained a reputation of
being the candidate Bush least wants to face; Republicans have spent
millions of dollars on ads attacking McBride.</TE>
<TE>   Although Reno has high name recognition, many Democrats fear she
cannot beat Bush, who is unopposed in the primary.</TE>
<TE>   Reno spent Monday wrapping up her second pickup-truck tour of the
state and trying to push aside doubts about her ability to win today
and in November.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Florida contest, there are races in New Hampshire,
Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, North
Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin and the District of
Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   In North Carolina, the Senate seat held for 30 years by retiring
Republican Jesse Helms drew crowded primaries, with Elizabeth Hanford
Dole leading seven candidates for the GOP nomination and former
Clinton White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles among nine
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   The New York governor's race simmered down last week when Andrew
Cuomo dropped out of the Democratic primary, clearing the way for
state Comptroller H. Carl McCall to take on Republican Gov. George
Pataki this fall.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, D.C., Mayor Anthony Williams was dropped from the
Democratic primary ballot because of petition irregularities. He is
running as a write-in candidate, as is his chief opponent, the Rev.
Willie Wilson. In Providence, R.I., four Democrats are vying for the
nomination to replace ousted Mayor Vincent "Buddy" Cianci Jr., who
was sentenced to prison last week for corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Several House seats also drew attention, including a bid by former
Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris for a safely GOP House
seat, and Kennedy cousin Mark Shriver's run for the Democratic
nomination to challenge eight-term GOP Rep. Constance A. Morella in
Maryland.</TE>

<HD>A Family's Private Journey of Unending Grief</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Firefighter's loved ones help engineer a memorial
run but can't escape the pain of their loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In the last minutes of his life, New York firefighter Stephen Siller
sprinted through the Brooklyn-Battery tunnel with 80 pounds of gear
on his back. He was racing toward the World Trade Center but perished
in the Sept. 11 inferno, leaving behind a wife and five young
children.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as the one-year anniversary approaches, Siller's loved ones
are traveling through a different tunnel--a dark passage filled with
grief and a realization that for all the media chitchat about moving
on and picking up the pieces, theirs is a mourning without end.</LD>
<LD>   "What does moving on really mean?" asked Siller's widow, Sally, as
she rocked her daughter Genevieve on a quiet, rainy morning in her
Staten Island home. "If it means coming to terms with what happened,
none of us have done that. A year is meaningless. We're still
devastated."</LD>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks killed 283 people from Staten Island, many
of them firefighters, and the signs of grieving in Siller's tranquil,
tree-lined neighborhood remain evident months later. Flags, wreaths
and pictures of those who died still adorn the front porches of brick
and wood-frame homes.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, there are homemade, living room shrines to those who
vanished. The Sillers, who were the subject of a Los Angeles Times
profile in December, have placed photos of Stephen on shelves,
windowsills and tables, alongside other memorabilia marking his
service with the New York Fire Department. "Remember this moment,"
reads one photo tribute in Sally Siller's home.</TE>
<TE>   Like many families who lost someone on Sept. 11, the Sillers will
mark the anniversary with a special event. On Sept. 29, with the
permission of New York City officials, the 1.7-mile Brooklyn-Battery
tunnel entering Manhattan will be shut down, and 5,000 people will
participate in a charity run retracing Stephen's route to the World
Trade Center. Inside, 343 firefighters will hold flags, commemorating
those department members who died. Although the event focuses on one
man's story, it is intended to honor every person who was murdered in
the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   For all the strength and inspiration the Sillers hope to draw from
such an event, however, their tribute underscores a dilemma facing
many 9/11 families: Grieving in private is hard enough, but how do
you cope with a tragedy that was also a media event--a day that
changed the world forever?</TE>
<TE>   "I believe our run through the tunnel can be a rallying point,"
said Sally, a private, soft-spoken woman. "Yet Stephen's death has
been painful because it was out in the open. It was part of something
that everyone saw on TV. It's everywhere. And there are times when I
need to be alone."</TE>
<TE>   The Sillers, a boisterous, fun-loving clan, are the first to
understand this and give way. Yet it's not easy in an extended family
of 57 people that was shattered by the loss of Stephen, who was 34
when he died. Their careful respect for Sally's space clashes with a
hunger to be with her and the children: Katie, 10; Olivia, 6;
Genevieve, 4; Jake, 2; and Stephen, 20 months.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids are five little pieces of Stephen and they're all
that's left of him in the world," said Catherine Mooney, Sally's
sister. "We need to help them as best we can, because at the end of
the day, my sister has to face this herself. If anything, her sadness
has deepened over time."</TE>
<TE>   The children have also been affected. Katie has become quieter and
more distant in the last year, Catherine said. There are times when
Olivia doesn't feel safe or secure, and Genevieve--at play with other
children--will explain that someone is dead because "everybody dies."
Jake walks through the house kissing a picture of his father, and
little Stephen, who was born with a heart defect, had major surgery
earlier this year that was only partially successful.</TE>
<TE>   From the minute her husband died, Sally, 34, has been overwhelmed
with visits from family members, close friends, firefighters and
others nearly frantic with a desire to help. She has rarely been
alone, and those closest to her know that this concern can be a
hindrance as well as a help.</TE>
<TE>   "There are moments when Sally needs to breathe, to be by herself,"
said her mother, Ann. "You need to let go. But in this family, that's
hard."</TE>
<TE>   The youngest of seven siblings, Stephen Siller was marked by
tragedy at an early age. Both his parents died by the time he was 10,
and he was raised by much older brothers and sisters. Determined to
start a family of his own, he married Sally Wilson, a childhood
friend from the same tree-lined Staten Island neighborhood where he
grew up. They had five children in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen, outgoing and eager to help others, was drawn to the Fire
Department, where he gained a reputation as a workaholic. He always
had the scanner on, even on his days off, and that played a role in
his death. On the morning of Sept. 11 he had finished work and was
driving away from the Brooklyn firehouse where he was a member of
Squad One, an elite rescue company. Siller was planning to join his
brothers to play golf, but then he heard the first crackling reports
of the attacks on the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   Wheeling around in traffic, he gunned his black Ford pickup toward
the Brooklyn-Battery tunnel. But it was closed to all vehicles, so he
took off on foot until an engine company picked him up near the other
side. He was last seen near the South Tower, just before it
collapsed. Squad One lost 12 of its 27 members in the inferno.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I see that footage on television, I'm thinking:
'That's the exact moment my brother was murdered,' " said Janis
Hannan, one of Stephen's three sisters. "And if you keep thinking
that, as we do, it can play havoc with your life."</TE>
<TE>   Getting over Stephen's death has been difficult because he played
such a unique role in his family. He was the free-spirited,
irrepressible kid, the organizer of epic vacations and zany weekend
activities. He was a tireless dad who spent endless hours with kids,
a confidant to his brothers and sisters, an exuberant life force who
got all of them off their duffs.</TE>
<TE>   In death, he continues to have a similar effect.</TE>
<TE>   His brother George runs a Staten Island sporting goods store and
normally tries to relax on the weekends. Since the family began
planning the charity run, he's been up at 6 a.m. most days, calling
merchants to line up financial support and organize other
contributions. He's kept up a dizzying pace, like the others in his
clan, and the change stuns him.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like a hyper teenager in the body of a tired, 50-year-old
man," he cracked, rifling through posters advertising the run that
have been placed in delis and stores throughout Staten Island,
Manhattan and parts of Long Island. "It's like Stephen has taken over
my entire life."</TE>
<TE>   For some, the frantic rush to get everything ready for the charity
run has built a psychological wall against the pain they experience
every day.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm running from morning till night because Stephen took over our
lives," Janis said. "I just hope we're not running away from
feelings."</TE>
<TE>   Long before the anniversary, the Sillers began discussing an
appropriate memorial for Stephen. They considered testimonial
dinners, golf tournaments and other ways to raise money for the
Stephen Siller "Let Us Do Good" Children's Foundation that had been
created in his memory. The nonprofit group has been distributing
funds to children who have lost a parent or have other special needs.</TE>
<TE>   When they hit on the idea of a Tunnel to Towers charity run, some
family members initially were skeptical. How could they possibly
navigate the labyrinth of city departments whose approval would be
needed to shut down one of New York's busiest inter-borough tunnels
on a Sunday afternoon?</TE>
<TE>   "We met with city officials from the Department of Transportation
and, to our amazement, we had a lot of people saying yes to us," said
Frank, another of Stephen's brothers. "It just steamrolled, and now
it's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   The purpose of the run is to remember Stephen's sacrifice and
those of everyone else who died in the terrorist attacks. Planners
say the estimated $250,000 that will be raised from participants in
the 5-kilometer walk and run will be split between the Sillers'
foundation and the NYC Firefighter Burn Center Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   With its blending of private grieving and public remembrance, the
Tunnel to Towers run is unique among the many observances planned for
Sept. 11 victims in New York. Most events are strictly private, such
as dinners or funeral Masses; only a handful are intended for the
public.</TE>
<TE>   Organizing the event has consumed family members; like a small
army they've fanned out to publicize the run and work with city
agencies to ensure a dignified ceremony near the trade center site
when the race ends.</TE>
<TE>   But all this work, all the hectic planning, can never take away
the grief that still shadows them. On a recent morning, Stephen's
three sisters--Janis, Regina Vogt and Mary Scullin--shared coffee in
Regina's kitchen and spoke of how they've learned to cope.</TE>
<TE>   Mary, for example, has avoided watching too much world news,
hoping to shut out the anger that could consume her. Regina remembers
the good times, the parties, weddings and backyard picnics where
Stephen brought life to all of them. Earlier this year, Janis moved
back to the New Brighton neighborhood where the Sillers and Wilsons
still live, to be closer to family. But she weeps at the realization
that Stephen never will be able to bring his kids to her porch on one
of his famous unannounced visits.</TE>
<TE>   In his living room several blocks away, Frank tells how he spent a
recent night at the site of the twin towers, helping a work crew
remove what turned out to be the last physical remains of New York
City firefighters found under the South Tower. It was the last
chance, he said, to try to find his brother.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't supposed to be there, but a friend made it possible, and
I was so hopeful that we'd find Stephen," Frank said with a catch in
his voice. "What I saw that night wasn't normal, and I can't really
talk about it. We didn't find anything related to Stephen. But it was
important to try."</TE>
<TE>   For other family members, the simple kindness they show each other
is another way to get through their tunnel of grief. The Sillers and
Wilsons were always close, Stephen's brother Russell said. But
nothing like now.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a bond built around barbecues, weddings and christenings,"
he said. "Today, though, we've been brought together by the aftermath
of Stephen's death. Other families might have drifted apart, but we
didn't."</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, hellos and goodbyes seem deeper, more heartfelt,
Catherine said. The Sillers and Wilsons don't take feelings for
granted anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "When Russell says goodbye to me these days, he gives me a big
hug, and he'll say: 'God bless you, Catherine,' like he was my
brother," she said. "Life is so precious now. We've been changed.
We've been marked by this."</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Sally sees reminders of Stephen's death everywhere:
on TV, in her mail, in random chats with neighbors and in local
stores, where posters advertising the Tunnel to Towers run feature
his smiling photo.</TE>
<TE>   There are days when she doesn't know if she's actually going to
attend the event, no matter how much she supports it. Then, gathering
her strength, she vows to participate. No one in the family is
pressuring her to decide.</TE>
<TE>   "Who could blame her for wanting to be alone?" Mary asked. "But
there have been signs, important signs, I think, that Sally is moving
forward."</TE>
<TE>   A turning point came in June, when she addressed parents and
graduating students at the Sacred Heart school in her neighborhood.
She had agreed to speak on behalf of the family's foundation and,
after handing out six $1,000 scholarships to children who had lost a
parent, she spoke publicly for the first time about her husband's
death and Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard getting up to speak, but I got through the things I
wanted to say," Sally recalled. "I told children who had lost a
parent that they must never lose hope. I said that maybe people had
heard about my husband, but they might not realize he lost both his
parents when he was young.</TE>
<TE>   "When I looked up, everybody in the room was crying," she added.
"And then I began to cry. I was drained by the whole experience, but
I felt better because maybe I'd made a difference in these children's
lives."</TE>
<TE>   During recent weeks, Sally has tried to focus more on her own
needs. She's walking regularly, practicing yoga, taking brief
vacations with family members and focusing on the rich memories of
her life with Stephen.</TE>
<TE>   "We encourage her so much," George said. "But who can tell? She
could be crying her eyes out from midnight till dawn and we wouldn't
know."</TE>
<TE>   There have indeed been rough evenings. Nights when children crawl
into bed with Sally, crying for their father. Nights of numbing
darkness.</TE>
<TE>   But there is also hope. Lately, Sally has been practicing the
saxophone late in the evening. She always loved to play, but had to
stop taking lessons after each of her kids was born. There's nothing
stopping her now, and after the children are asleep she's been
letting it rip at midnight.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess the whole neighborhood knows that I play," she said
sheepishly. "I love the blues. Someday I want to sing in a rock
band."</TE>
<TE>   It might be a crazy dream, she concedes, but the thought of a
better life ahead, a beacon of possibility, brings a radiant smile to
her face.</TE>
<TE>   "I want my kids to know the woman their father fell in love with,
if not now, then soon," she said. "And I hear Stephen telling me that
every day. He says: 'Keep on going. Keep running. Make it through the
tunnel.' "</TE>

<HD>Denver in an Uproar Over Police 'Spy' Files</HD>
<DH>Law: Dossiers on people and 'criminal extremist groups' are
called an invasion of privacy. The data are being made public before
purging.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Sister Antonia Anthony, 74, found herself in the files, characterized
as a member of a "criminal extremist group."</LD>
<LD>   Great-grandmother Helen Henry, 82, was in there too, with the
notation that her Toyota sedan was affixed with a "Free Leonard
Peltier" bumper sticker.</LD>
<LD>   Both had aroused the suspicions of the Denver Police Department,
which has maintained dossiers on about 3,200 individuals and 208
organizations that it believed bore watching.</LD>
<TE>   When the files were discovered this spring, the ensuing uproar,
from the mayor on down, compelled the department to get rid of them.
But first, the department was advised, the subjects of files should
be given a copy so they could learn what the police had on them.</TE>
<TE>   The release of the so-called spy files began last week, and more
than 300 people jammed police headquarters, wondering whether they
were the focus of police intelligence. Representatives of 70 groups
also showed up.</TE>
<TE>   Some with police files were angered by what they said was an
invasion of privacy. It harked back to longtime FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover's extensive files on the rich, famous and politically active;
it also echoed concerns that America's war on terrorism has turned
back the clock on civil liberties.</TE>
<TE>   Others dismissed the files' contents as laughable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the KGB-meets-Keystone Kops," said Stephen Nash, the subject
of an 18-page file because he is active in Amnesty International and
two local police watchdog organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony's apparent offense: The Catholic peace and justice
advocate is co-founder of the local Chiapas Coalition, campaigning
for the civil rights of the indigenous people in that Mexican state.
In her file, police noted that her organization was working to
overthrow the Mexican government.</TE>
<TE>   "All we're trying to do is raise consciousness about how U.S.
economic, military and political policy decisions are having an
impact on the lives of the indigenous people of Chiapas," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The American Civil Liberties Union learned of the existence of the
files in March as it was pursuing a civil-rights lawsuit. The ACLU is
now suing the city over the database, with depositions in the federal
civil case scheduled to begin this week. Because of the pending
litigation, city officials are saying little.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Silverstein, legal director of the ACLU of Colorado, said the
gravity of the files, developed largely by police monitoring
attendance at rallies, protests and political activist meetings,
should not be discounted.</TE>
<TE>   "People should be able to participate in a peaceful rally without
fear their names will wind up in police files, falsely branded as
criminal extremists," he said. "Individuals will be less likely to
join a protest or rally if they fear they will be branded and smeared
with these false labels as being considered sinister, dangerous or
deviant."</TE>
<TE>   Denver Mayor Wellington E. Webb, empathetic because he was
identified in FBI files as a young political activist, convened a
panel of three judges that reviewed each file and concluded that many
should be purged as useless and improper. Only those that contain
bona fide information pertaining to criminal investigations, as
deemed by an independent analyst, will be kept.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very clear that something went wrong here," said mayoral
spokesman Andrew Hudson. "The obvious downside of this entire thing,
beyond the absurdity of keeping files on people who shouldn't be in
files, is that it fuels people who already are so full of conspiracy
theories, in an era of government distrust.</TE>
<TE>   "Intelligence work is necessary, but has to be done right and in a
way in which civil liberties aren't trampled."</TE>
<TE>   The computer database was created in 1999 when the Police
Department culled about 100,000 "Rolodex records" compiled since the
early 1950s and transferred the most recent ones into its computer
system.</TE>
<TE>   After the ACLU's revelations, city officials ordered the files
purged from police computers, after first making them available
through Nov. 1 to those named in the files.</TE>
<TE>   Critics worry that people won't know whether files exist on them
unless they personally request the information. C.L. Harmer,
spokeswoman for the city's Public Safety Department, said that those
named in the files are not being notified for fear of contacting the
wrong person.</TE>
<TE>   Sheepish city officials admit the files reflect a police
intelligence strategy gone awry, exacerbated by a new computer system
that prompted poorly trained clerks to mischaracterize organizations
as "criminal extremists" because it was one of the few options in the
software's menu.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not as mean-spirited as some might think," Harmer said.
"There was a fracture in the computerized database" that is now being
corrected.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Department has responded coolly to the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "We've issued no oops-we-blew-it statement," said Lt. Steven
Carter, department spokesman. "We're releasing the files because they
don't need to be stored any longer."</TE>
<TE>   He said that the department will still maintain intelligence files
on people who are suspected or convicted of criminal activity, but
that the new criteria for inclusion will be strict. An outside
consultant will review the files on a quarterly basis to ensure that
only those with a criminal nexus will be maintained, Harmer said.</TE>
<TE>   The files have angered some, but have been applauded by others.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to worry about our freedom and right to privacy when
you hear about this," said Doc Green, who tends an upscale downtown
bar. "I know we're at war, but our civil liberties are slipping
away."</TE>
<TE>   Businessman Paul Rusin said he wasn't bothered by the files. "If
the police are keeping records of protesters, that's part of their
job," he said. "People who are vocal should expect to be looked at.
If they protest at the state Capitol, the police will want to know
who and what they're dealing with. The times are changing, my
friend."</TE>
<TE>   Henry, the great-grandmother, was ambivalent about her inclusion
in the files. She's not even sure why she was of police interest, but
she had organized the Unitarian Universalist Network on Indigenous
Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Her Peltier bumper sticker supported the American Indian activist
who is serving two consecutive life sentences for the 1975 killings
of two FBI agents on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South
Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   Having a file "might have bothered me 40 years ago, but it doesn't
now," Henry said. "The police are just doing their job."</TE>

<HD>Al Qaeda Tape Hints at Targets</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Group releases video footage taking
responsibility for Sept. 11 and suggesting attacks at U.S. nuclear
sites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Just before the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, the Al Qaeda
terrorist network on Monday released video footage claiming
responsibility for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, saying the U.S. Capitol was also a target and hinting at
future strikes against nuclear facilities.</LD>
<LD>   The videotapes, delivered Monday to the Qatar-based Al Jazeera
television network which then immediately broadcast them, included
comments attributed to one of the Sept. 11 hijackers and Osama bin
Laden himself.</LD>
<LD>   The satellite network also publicized what it said was a recent
series of interviews between its investigative reporter and two top
Al Qaeda fugitives who confessed to having played central roles in
the Sept. 11 attacks and other plots. Al Jazeera has long been used
by Al Qaeda as a means of communicating its message to the outside
world.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in a day of fast-moving terrorism-related developments:</TE>
<TE>   * The FBI confirmed Monday that it has issued warnings to local
police, electrical companies and transportation agencies in recent
days of potential terrorist attacks within U.S. borders on or near
Sept. 11. FBI officials said they and U.S. intelligence agencies have
received a steady stream of threats that mention New York and
Washington. "The FBI possesses no information indicating a specific
threat to any of these [Sept. 11] commemorative events," said the
advisory issued by the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection
Center. "However, a large volume of threats of undetermined
reliability continues to be received and investigated by the FBI." An
FBI official said the warning was issued out of "an abundance of
caution."</TE>
<TE>   * The Pentagon deployed jet fighters and surface-to-air missiles
at several military installations around Washington for an air
defense exercise that begins today. Air Force Lt. Col. Ken McClellan
said the exercise, which could last up to four days, had been planned
for several weeks. No live weapons will be used, McClellan said,
adding that the exercise is designed to test systems to defend
against attacks from the air.</TE>
<TE>   * Authorities in the Philippines announced that they have
uncovered evidence of an Al Qaeda plot to attack the U.S. and Israeli
embassies in Manila.</TE>
<TE>   * The State Department said it had closed the U.S. Embassy in the
Indonesian capital of Jakarta and a consulate in Surabaya "until
further notice" because of threats of attack.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, FBI and Justice Department officials said they
wanted to scrutinize the Al Jazeera tapes to glean whatever they
could from them about the Sept. 11 attacks and any future terrorist
plots that Al Qaeda has planned.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to get" the tapes, said an FBI official, speaking
on condition of anonymity. "Obviously, they are of great interest to
us."</TE>
<TE>   Al Jazeera officials would not say how, where or from whom they
received the tapes. That has been the case in the past with several
videos with statements by Bin Laden and top aides that were later
authenticated by U.S. and other authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The current footage, the network said, "seems to be a tape
prepared by Al Qaeda on the first anniversary of the Sept. 11
attacks." It was aired beginning about 2 p.m. EDT, and picked up by
CNN, which had its own Arabic experts provide translations. Other
news outlets reported slightly different interpretations.</TE>
<TE>   On one tape, at least four men identified as some of the 19
hijackers were shown chatting and reviewing flight manuals in
Afghanistan. In one close-up, a hand is placed on a map of Washington
that has the Pentagon highlighted. The men were not cleanshaven and
dressed in European clothing as they were on Sept. 11, but rather
were bearded and wearing Afghan garb. Al Jazeera identified them as
hijackers Ahmed Alnami, Hamza Alghamdi, Ahmed Alghamdi and Wail
Alshehri.</TE>
<TE>   In another segment, a man appears before a large, apparently
superimposed photograph of a smoldering Pentagon. "We will get you.
We will humiliate you. We will never stop following you," said the
man who also demanded that the United States "take your fat hands off
the land of Arabs," according to the CNN translation.</TE>
<TE>   Al Jazeera identified that speaker as Abdulaziz Alomari, one of
the hijackers aboard American Airlines Flight 11, which crashed into
the North Tower of the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   "God praise everybody who trained and helped me, namely, the
leader Sheikh Osama bin Laden," Alomari said. "May God bless him. May
God accept our deeds."</TE>
<TE>   In yet another segment, a voice identified by Al Jazeera as that
of Bin Laden himself is heard over images of Afghanistan and the 19
hijackers, praising the hijackers for changing "the face of history."</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't enough words to describe how great these men were
and how great their deeds were," said the CNN translation. "When you
talk about the invasion of New York and Washington, you talk about
men who changed the face of history and went against the traitors.
These men have consolidated faith in the hearts of believers and
undermined the plans of the crusaders and their agents in the
region."</TE>
<TE>   The man identified as Bin Laden names all four of the men believed
to be pilots of the four hijacked planes. Mohamed Atta, he said,
"carried the pains of the nation," and Hani Hanjour, whose plane
crashed into the Pentagon was "a great man," according to CNN's
translation.</TE>
<TE>   Al Jazeera said the tape of the hijackers was filmed several
months before the Sept. 11 attacks in the eastern Afghan town of
Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said Monday they had no idea when the tapes were
made but that they should put to rest claims in the Arab world that
Al Qaeda was being unfairly accused of launching the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Of even more interest to U.S. authorities, they said Monday, was
the series of interviews that an Al Jazeera reporter said he
conducted with two top Al Qaeda operatives in June.</TE>
<TE>   The two men, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and Ramzi Binalshibh, are both
senior figures in Al Qaeda and are the subjects of intensive
international manhunts for their alleged roles in the Sept. 11
attacks. U.S. authorities say Mohammed in particular is one of the
highest-ranking Al Qaeda leaders still at large, and that he is
helping the network regroup and plan new attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department considers Mohammed a mastermind of the
Sept. 11 plot, and authorities believe he may have brought the idea
to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh, authorities say, was a roommate of plot leader Mohamed
Atta in Germany and was meant to be the 20th hijacker. When he could
not gain entry into the United States, authorities say, he later
provided funds to some hijackers, as well as to accused terrorist
Zacarias Moussaoui.</TE>
<TE>   Al Jazeera said it planned to release tape-recorded portions of
those videotaped interviews on Thursday as part of a documentary
marking the first anniversary of the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with London's Sunday Times, the Al Jazeera
reporter, Youri Fouda, described being blindfolded and driven to a
house in the Pakistani port city of Karachi, where he interviewed the
two men over a 48-hour period. Al Jazeera said the two fugitives then
seized all the footage and later released audiotapes.</TE>
<TE>   Fouda said Mohammed, 38, introduced himself as head of Al Qaeda's
military committee, and that he and Binalshibh said the U.S. Capitol
had been Al Qaeda's fourth Sept. 11 target had the plane not crashed
in a Pennsylvania field. U.S. officials have suspected that the
Capitol or the White House was the target.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed also said Binalshibh "is the coordinator of the 'Holy
Tuesday' operation,' " in reference to the attacks, which fell on a
Tuesday, according to Fouda.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed also said that when the attacks were first planned 2 1/2
years before Sept. 11, "the first targets considered were nuclear
facilities."</TE>
<TE>   The plot leaders "decided against it for fear it would go out of
control," Fouda quoted Mohammed as saying. "You do not need to know
more than that at this stage, and anyway it was eventually decided to
leave out nuclear targets. For now."</TE>

<HD>Administration to Endorse 'Trusted Traveler' Program to
Reduce Security Lines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a policy reversal aimed at reducing security hassles for millions
of frequent fliers, the Bush administration will endorse a program to
speed "trusted travelers" through airport checkpoints, an official
said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   James M. Loy, head of the Transportation Security Administration,
will make the announcement today at a Senate hearing, said
Transportation Department spokesman Lenny Alcivar.</LD>
<LD>   Loy will also disclose that the TSA has confiscated more than 200
guns, 4,600 box cutters and 122,000 knives from passengers since the
federal government assumed direct responsibility for airport security
on Feb. 17.</LD>
<TE>   In total, 2.3 million "prohibited items"--from scissors to
firearms--have been seized.</TE>
<TE>   For months, airlines, airports and passenger groups have been
clamoring for special treatment for travelers who volunteer to
undergo a federal background check. Such an approach, already
employed in Israel, could reduce airport security lines for all
travelers. "This is a breakthrough," said David Stempler, president
of the Air Travelers Assn., an advocacy group. "Security screeners
can spend less time on people who are not a threat and more time on
people they don't know."</TE>
<TE>   The previous head of the TSA, John Magaw, had been reluctant to
proceed with a trusted traveler program, fearing that it could be
co-opted by terrorist "sleeper cells" whose members are willing to
devote years to building an innocuous profile. Loy's decision is
another signal that the TSA is trying to improve its relations with
airlines and airports, both of which have criticized the agency as
indifferent to their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the big problems we hear from business travelers is that
they don't know whether it's going to take them five minutes or an
hour to get through security," Stempler said. "This so-called hassle
factor is one of the things that's caused a diversion from airline
travel to other kinds of transportation." The industry estimates that
it is losing $3.8 billion a year as a result.</TE>
<TE>   "Preventing another Sept. 11 means more than just X-raying checked
baggage," said Michael Wascom, a spokesman for the Air Transport
Assn., which represents the major airlines. "If a technologically
sophisticated trusted traveler system ... can be put in place, then
we will have made significant strides toward preventing another Sept.
11."</TE>
<TE>   Many questions remain about the program's implementation and
operation. Alcivar said Loy has made no determinations about such
details.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's "Express Entry" program has been in place since 1998, and
it has cut check-in time at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International
Airport to only 15 minutes from two hours for 80,000 enrolled
individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers in Israel apply in person to join the program and must
undergo a background check and an interview. The annual fee is from
$20 to $25.</TE>
<TE>   During the interview, the applicant's hand is scanned by a
machine. If approved for the program, passengers receive a card with
about 90 hand measurements encoded on a chip. At the airport, they
insert their card at a special kiosk and have their hand scanned
again to verify their identity.</TE>
<TE>   Loy will also announce that the government expects to meet a Nov.
19 deadline for deploying more than 30,000 new federal employees at
passenger checkpoints in 429 airports with regular commercial
service.</TE>
<TE>   But the TSA will seek relief from a Dec. 31 deadline for screening
all checked baggage with explosive detection technology. Alcivar said
Loy will ask that 20 to 40 airports be given more time to comply
because of delays in procuring and installing the machines.</TE>

for the future.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, several recent actions by the United States, including the
farm bill and steel tariffs, have caused massive ill will.</LD>
<LD>   There is palpable fear that the pending Free Trade Area of the
Americas is really a stalking horse for a renewed bout of U.S.
economic imperialism. Coupled with regional economic collapse,
repeated challenges to democracy and a distinct lack of enthusiasm
for the U.S.-led war on terror, this has caused a rapid deterioration
in relations.</LD>
<TE>   The question nobody asks, however, is whether, in the current
global environment, relative neglect of the hemisphere is justified.
Despite a new commitment to democracy and significant economic growth
across the region in the 1990s, Latin American and Caribbean leaders
mostly have failed to implement true institutional reform.</TE>
<TE>   Consider:</TE>
<TE>   * Despite Argentina being named a "major non-NATO ally" of the
United States, corruption remains endemic as the leadership class
argues among itself, pursues vendettas against those out of power and
refuses to subsume personal gain for the good of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   * After Alberto Fujimori fled Peru in disgrace, new President
Alejandro Toledo announced his own arrival in power by giving himself
a huge pay raise. Many in the Peruvian Cabinet have since left, and
Toledo struggles to remain in office.</TE>
<TE>   * Hugo Chavez's "total war" on corruption and the entrenched
political class in Venezuela has degenerated into a systematic
dismantling of democracy and an emerging cult of personality while he
plays footsie with Iraq, Libya and Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   * Guatemala, Nicaragua and Trinidad are struggling with crises
engendered by congressional or other leaders more interested in their
own well-being than that of their people.</TE>
<TE>   And on it goes, as the region cascades down the latest backside of
its traditional boom-and-bust cycles.</TE>
<TE>   Of the larger economies in Latin America and the Caribbean, only
Mexico and Chile, whose leaders took aggressive actions to open their
respective economies and fundamentally reform and strengthen their
democratic institutions, are in decent shape.</TE>
<TE>   Which raises the question of priorities for U.S. foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   Regional leaders decry the perceived inattention of the U.S. over
the last year without understanding how profoundly the vicious Sept.
11 attacks affected the American mind-set or how focused we have
become on the national security challenges so clearly before us.</TE>
<TE>   Simply put, leaders who are preoccupied with their own political
fortunes or with distributing the spoils of governance do not make
strong partners. The region could certainly stand a renewed dose of
responsible engagement by the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   If there is to be a true partnership, however, Latin American and
Caribbean leaders must recognize that the worldview of the public and
policymakers in the United States has changed, and respond
accordingly.</TE>

<HD>Al Qaeda's Coils Grip the Media</HD>
<DH>Airwaves and the Internet fall prey to terrorist tactics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAWAZ A. GERGES</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Aware of the symbolic power of Sept. 11, Al Qaeda's lieutenants have
used media outlets to celebrate and capitalize on this historic
moment. Gone is their pretense of denial. Now they have publicly
taken full credit for the Sept. 11 attacks and have promised to visit
more death and mayhem on the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Al Qaeda appears to have learned no new lessons about its past
suicidal conduct. No second thoughts about killing thousands of
innocent American civilians or precipitating a devastating war that
has claimed more Muslim lives. No apologies about tarnishing the name
of Islam in the world and jeopardizing the well-being of the Muslim
communities in the West. No explanations about initially feeding
Arabs and Muslims lies about their innocence and blindly luring their
sons into a deathtrap in Afghanistan and elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   In the last two weeks, Al Jazeera, the leading Arab television
network, has broadcast interviews with two of the group's field
lieutenants, who admit to helping plan and carry out the Sept. 11
attacks. Blindfolded and driven to a secret location apparently in
Pakistan, Al Jazeera's correspondent said he was surprised to find
himself seated next to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed--a close associate of
the presumed mastermind of the September attacks, Mohamed Atta--and
Ramzi Omar, also known as Ramzi Binalshibh, one of the
highest-ranking Al Qaeda field lieutenants and one of the most-wanted
fugitives in the world. Mohammed and Omar discussed Al Qaeda's
organizational skills and its ability to strike at the heart of the
U.S. without being detected and promised more attacks to come.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is not the first time Al Qaeda has confessed to the
crime--Al Jazeera says it has 19 videotapes by all the hijackers
airing their grievances against the U.S.--Mohammed and Omar's
acknowledgment timed to coincide with the attacks' first anniversary
sheds light on the group's mind-set and desperate quest for
recognition.</TE>
<TE>   Hunted down and on the run a year later, Al Qaeda is trying to
convince the world that it is still alive and kicking, capable of
unleashing terror and death on its enemies. Since its war with the
U.S. has not gone as well as it had hoped, Al Qaeda's strategy is
designed to motivate hardened foot soldiers and inspire sympathizers
to target Americans and continue the fight.</TE>
<TE>   According to Arab and Pakistani sources who are close to Al Qaeda,
at the end of 2001, after the Taliban's fall, Osama bin Laden and his
top lieutenants decided to withdraw their forces to Pakistan and
Iran, with a preference for the former because of its proximity and
the presence of militant supporters and to organize them in sleeper
cells in preparation for future attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Although Pakistani and Iranian authorities arrested dozens of Al
Qaeda's fighters, hundreds of others, along with their families,
escaped. Some settled in Iran, but most sought refuge in the rugged
area along the Pakistani-Afghan border under the protection of tribal
elders. Other members of Al Qaeda reportedly used Karachi's access to
the Arabian Sea to travel to Oman, Yemen and Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda appears to be using the September anniversary to reassure
these important hidden assets in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Europe
and elsewhere and to signal them to be ready and vigilant.</TE>
<TE>   For example, two weeks ago, Bin Laden reportedly released a
handwritten letter, posted on the Jihadonline Web site, in which he
belittled U.S. power and claimed that it will ultimately be defeated
and meet the same fate as that of former empires. Ironically, he
called on Afghans, not Arabs (obviously, he has been disappointed
with Arab inaction), to rise up against the U.S., which only
understands "the language of force and jihad."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Bin Laden's confidant and spokesman, Sulaiman abu
Ghaith, on a Web site frequented by militants, published an emotional
letter addressed to Al Qaeda's "captives" in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.
He claimed that "the moujahedeen will not rest until they liberate
their brethren in faith." He did not say how Al Qaeda, which
possesses no naval armada, would be capable of sailing the oceans and
infiltrating a well-guarded U.S. military base. Perhaps he was
insinuating that Al Qaeda might take Americans hostage and then use
them as a bargaining chip to gain the release of its prisoners?</TE>
<TE>   Abu Ghaith's letter might not have provided a concrete plan or map
of how to free the prisoners, but, imitating the example of his boss,
he included fiery verses of poetry to lift the morale of the troops.
This goal--keeping the jihad flames alight and preventing further
erosion--lies at the heart of Al Qaeda's celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Ghaith's letter was subsequently posted on Jihadonline, whose
manager congratulated himself and Bin Laden, "on this great jihadi
anniversary" in which America's nose was bloodied. He urged all
brethren to "actively and positively" participate in this special
occasion by revisiting terror on the U.S. and thus scoring a major
propaganda coup. Jihadonline stressed the important, parallel role of
the media in this war. Al Qaeda seems to be fully conscious of the
propaganda value of this anniversary and wishes to celebrate it with
a big bang.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time the Bush administration is rattling its sword
against Iraq, the evidence of Al Qaeda's continuing danger exposes
the ineffectiveness of the administration's war on terrorism.
Military means are not adequate to deal with the complex phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   One year after the horrifying events of Sept. 11, our
understanding of Al Qaeda's world remains perilously slim.</TE>
<TE>   Until we succeed in developing among our leaders a broader
knowledge of the causes and roots of anti-Americanism and begin to
grapple with ways to defuse it, we will live with a constant threat
to our peace and security.</TE>

<HD>Bin Laden: a Known Monster Before 9/11</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes the truth can be so banal it hurts. Cut through the hogwash
of a year's worth of lofty Sept. 11 postmortems and dire warnings
that the world is out to get us and one is left with the reality that
the day of infamy could easily have been avoided.</LD>
<LD>   The uniquely clear and overt terrorist threat of Osama bin Laden's
Al Qaeda organization to the U.S., its bloody track record in
attacking U.S. targets overseas and even the exact location of its
base of operations were all known by both the Clinton and George W.
Bush administrations.</LD>
<LD>   Tragically, however, for embarrassingly petty bureaucratic and
political reasons, both presidents were unwilling or unable to take
the monster out.</LD>
<TE>   The lavish budgets of our intelligence agencies allowed them to
read the license plates of vehicles in Al Qaeda's training camps from
space and even caught snapshots of the bearded one from cameras
mounted on CIA Predator drones. Our contacts on the ground knew all
about Bin Laden's terror operation because his Afghanistan and
Pakistan government sponsors were originally organized, financed and
trained by the CIA to wage the first U.S.-sponsored Islamic "holy
war" against the Soviets.</TE>
<TE>   It was bad enough that through our Cold War actions in the Muslim
world we helped create the "Islamic threat"--an epithet now commonly
employed to slander one of the world's great religions. Rubbing salt
in the wound, though, the CIA ignored the boomerang effect until that
infamous day when it turned into our worst nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   At home, FBI honchos dismissed field operatives' warnings of the
amateurish invasion of U.S. flight schools by Bin Laden's operatives.
The FBI claimed that it had insufficient manpower to track down these
terrifying leads. Yet during that same period, the bureau squandered
tens of thousands of agent hours obsessively shadowing and
interrogating Wen Ho Lee, a Los Alamos scientist who was never
charged with spying.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of obsessions, Saddam Hussein, dead or alive, had nothing
to do with Sept. 11, much as we'd like to find an excuse for going to
war with Iraq. No, Bin Laden was the enemy, with links to Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia, not Baghdad; we knew where he lived and did nothing
about it. After the murder of hundreds of civilians at U.S. embassies
in Africa and the killings of U.S. service personnel in Saudi Arabia
and on the U.S. destroyer Cole, the United States' response was
lethargic, distracted and ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   President Clinton did order a missile attack on Bin Laden's
infamous training camp in 1998, but having barely missed the target
he shunned further direct action, partly deterred by outraged
Republicans who accused him of "wagging the dog" to distract us all
from the all-important Monica Lewinsky scandal.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Clinton failed to complete the job, his
administration contenting itself to give the incoming Bush team some
alarming briefings on the Bin Laden operation.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bush, who in debates with Al Gore had lambasted foreign
intervention as "nation building," was building his foreign policy
around the drug war, diplomatic isolationism and the elimination of
the landmark Antiballistic Missile Treaty, so we could pursue our
quixotic attempt to build a missile shield over North America.</TE>
<TE>   Further, neither administration seemed to grasp that Bin Laden and
the Taliban had become one and the same. Both administrations ignored
such evidence as a comment that came out of the U.S.-supported talks
between a Saudi prince and Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar in
September 1998. Omar definitively rejected betraying the Taliban's
"hero"--Bin Laden--and told the Saudi prince that Bin Laden would
never be expelled from Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after these talks, 17 U.S. service personnel died on the Cole
while it was docked in Yemen, an Al Qaeda redoubt.</TE>
<TE>   Stunningly, five weeks after the Bush administration expressed
gratitude to the Taliban for eradicating Afghanistan's poppy crop and
simultaneously announced that it was funneling new aid to the country
through the United Nations, the president's reading-to-kids photo op
was interrupted by the Sept. 11 devastation.</TE>
<TE>   Some have suggested that the Bush administration was starting to
wake up to the threat of Al Qaeda, but we'll never know now. What we
do know is that in the last year the deaths of Sept. 11 have been
used over and over again as a rationale for eroding the Constitution,
reorganizing the federal government and launching a preemptive,
unilateral strike against a nation not implicated in the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Far more effective in preventing terrorism, however, and
engendering far fewer risks, would be for our leaders and
intelligence agencies to simply do their jobs, and do them well.</TE>

<LD>Gov. Gray Davis: The Sept. 30 deadline to work through the mountain
of legislation on your desk looms. There are many good bills you
should sign and at least one bad one you should veto. Here are a few
recommendations.</LD>
<LD>   Sign:</LD>
<LD>   * Mental health. AB 1421, a.k.a. "Laura's law," by Assemblywoman
Helen Thomson (D-Davis) would allow, in narrowly defined cases, the
involuntary treatment of people in need of help and unable to make
rational decisions concerning care.</LD>
<TE>   * Primary. SB 1975, Sen. Ross Johnson's (R-Irvine) bill, would
move the state primary election to the first week in June. The state
still would hold a separate March primary in presidential years. But
six months into the general election campaign, you of all people must
agree that it's ridiculous to nominate candidates in a March primary
who won't face election until November.</TE>
<TE>   * Beach access. SB 1962 would put muscle behind laws giving the
public access to the ocean. Sen. Richard Polanco's (D-Los Angeles)
bill would require the state to accept all the offers that beachfront
landowners have made over the years to provide access paths through
their properties to the sea. Many of these offers will soon expire,
and without your signature on this bill, property owners can shut the
gates to their estates forever.</TE>
<TE>   * Medi-Cal. The Assembly Budget Committee's AB 3006 would fully
restore the first across-the-board boost in Medi-Cal payments to
doctors since 1984. Enacted last year but rescinded in your May
budget, the increase in the state's version of Medicaid lifted
California from 47th among the states to 42nd. Inadequate
reimbursements are one reason hospitals are closing emergency
departments and specialists refuse to be on call. In signing
Thursday's budget, you agreed to restore half the increase and
consider restoring the rest. Signing AB 3006 would finish the job.</TE>
<TE>   * E-waste. SB 1523 by Sen. Byron Sher (D-Stanford) envisions a
pioneering program to recycle old computers and TV sets, financed by
a $10 fee on new devices. These old sets are now a major component of
the waste stream.</TE>
<TE>   * Courthouse repair. SB 1732 would gradually transfer title to
more than 450 courthouses from counties to the state and, by raising
court filing fees and fines, create a fund for construction and
repair. Since the state already pays for trial court operations, Sen.
Martha Escutia's (D-Whittier) bill makes sense and would help upgrade
many crumbling courthouses in Los Angeles and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   * HIV/AIDS. AB 2197 by Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood)
would, for the first time, extend Medi-Cal eligibility to
Californians who are infected with the virus that causes AIDS but who
have not yet developed the full-blown disease and who don't have
employer-based or other insurance. The law is written to preclude
costing the state additional money. By giving patients access to
drugs and care otherwise unavailable, the bill would extend their
lives and on-the-job productivity.</TE>
<TE>   Veto:</TE>
<TE>   * Insurance. SB 689 by Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda) would overturn
a decision of the state insurance commissioner and allow Mercury
Insurance Group to continue a form of discount that results in higher
premiums for some customers. The bill appeared to pass only because
Mercury has been such a generous contributor to legislators'
campaigns.</TE>

<LD>The nation may never know if it over-or under-reacted to Sept. 11 and
the fear that fanatics bent on mass murder could strike again,
perhaps harder.</LD>
<LD>   In those first gloomy weeks last fall, the president and the
attorney general scrambled to protect Americans. So far, they've
succeeded. But they have been less successful at mitigating the
damage their battle against Islamist terrorists has done to the
nation they're sworn to protect.</LD>
<LD>   Slowly, belatedly, Congress and the courts are asserting their
authority to keep the White House in check. Instead of listening,
however, President Bush and Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft continue to act
as if they think that in dangerous times it's OK to streamline
unwieldy democratic processes into imperious efficiency.</LD>
<TE>   Ashcroft, according to one of his deputies, "wanted people to
think outside the box, but never outside the Constitution." Yet for
nearly a year, the attorney general has rebuffed dozens of letters
and formal requests from members of Congress responsible for
overseeing how the Justice Department detains and prosecutes federal
suspects.</TE>
<TE>   How many immigrants did you arrest, and on what charges? queried
Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) in March. Estimates have put the number as
high as 1,200, with the overwhelming majority picked up for visa
violations or minor criminal charges. But nobody knows for sure, and
Ashcroft has yet to make a complete accounting.</TE>
<TE>   What justifies holding secret deportation hearings? Sen. Patrick
J. Leahy (D-Vt.) has asked repeatedly, in the more than two dozen
letters he's sent Ashcroft in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Which prisoners will you try in military tribunals? asked
Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Arlen Specter last fall. And how can you
defend the loose rules of law and evidence you have proposed to apply
in these cases?</TE>
<TE>   Why, asked Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), did you decide to bring
charges against John Walker Lindh last year in federal court and
allow a lawyer to represent him, while insisting that Yaser Esam
Hamdi and Jose Padilla, also U.S. citizens, are not entitled to the
same constitutional rights?</TE>
<TE>   The president has already declared these two citizens enemy
combatants on secret evidence. Hamdi, a Louisiana-born Taliban
fighter, was captured in Afghanistan. Padilla, a former gangbanger
arrested in Chicago, apparently stands accused of plotting to release
a radioactive bomb. Neither suspect faces criminal charges, and the
government insists that they are not entitled to an attorney or a
court hearing anytime soon.</TE>
<TE>   As Congress members ask questions, federal judges also have been
speaking up. A Virginia federal judge blasted Bush's decision to hold
Hamdi and Padilla incommunicado and indefinitely. In Hamdi's case,
the judge noticed, federal officials offered only a vague, two-page
memo from someone identified as a special advisor to the
undersecretary of defense to justify their action. "So," the
exasperated judge snapped, "the Constitution doesn't apply to Mr.
Hamdi?"</TE>
<TE>   Late last month, an appeals court upheld lower court rulings in
Newark, N.J., and Detroit directing the attorney general to end the
secret detention hearings that exclude not only the public and press
but family members--evoking memories of Central American dictators
who expediently "disappeared" anyone considered a threat. The
three-judge panel called the policy "profoundly undemocratic" and
warned that it could result "in a wholesale suspension of 1st
Amendment rights."</TE>
<TE>   Yet rather than accept these judicial decisions as wise guidance,
Ashcroft has chosen to appeal in every instance.</TE>
<TE>   So now we encourage Congress to stop asking questions and start
telling the attorney general what the courts have said: that even in
wartime, America is not a dictatorship. Republicans and Democrats who
value civil liberties need to set clear legislative limits on
Ashcroft's authority--and on the president's. They need to tell the
executive branch that no U.S. citizen shall be stripped of his due
process rights and that the government will keep all court
proceedings open to the public unless doing so would jeopardize
national security. If the administration can't make that case,
Congress should withhold money accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   Happily, as a result of this democracy's belief in open debate and
its built-in balance of power, words we used in our Sept. 12
editorial are still true a year later: "Buildings collapsed.
Democracy stands." For that to remain true in the coming years and
decades, however, depends on Congress' living up to its
responsibilities to minimize the war on terror's constitutional
casualties now.</TE>

<LD>Re "I'll Have the Burger Deluxe, With a Side of Guilt," Commentary,
Sept. 5: I can truly empathize with Norah Vincent's account of how
hard it is to reconcile our love for animals with our shopping and
dietary habits. I too have become very aware of this situation after
reading Peter Singer's eye-opening book, "Animal Liberation." But try
as I may, I'm not a foolproof vegetarian. Which doesn't mean I'm not
still trying, though, and I urge Vincent and others like her to not
think of themselves as hypocrites if they're not all-or-nothing
animal rights activists.</LD>
<LD>   Wasn't it Singer himself who advocated doing something rather than
nothing at all?</LD>
<LD>   Pamela Adelman</LD>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So the blandishments of animal "leftists" have Vincent considering
hocking her jewels for her cats. Well, as they say at Burger King,
have it your way. And there's the rub. As a hunter, I've killed my
supper on occasion--and thought about why, talked it over with fellow
hunters and read the literature. Guess what? I enjoy hunting, like
fur and meat--and I sleep well, too.</TE>
<TE>   You see, there is a distinction between humans and animals that is
so huge and obvious, I can't understand why professional ethicists
haven't explored it. While humans aren't the only species that feels
pain, or guilt, the fact remains that humans are the only species
that not only thinks about the ethics of dinner but has the ability
to discuss it.</TE>
<TE>   After they've tortured and shredded the elk du jour, wolves don't
sit around the gut pile discussing whether they imposed suffering.
They simply can't. We can--and that's why a rat is not a pig is not a
dog is not a boy.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Skinner</TE>
<TE>   Whitefish, Mont.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As long as we regard animals as objects to make us feel good
(hugging a cute puppy, eating a juicy steak), we simply don't
understand the true meaning of animal rights. Animal rights means the
rights of animals to share this planet with us on their own terms.
This requires our respect and protection. Any interference in their
lives must be done to benefit them, not us.</TE>
<TE>   The animal rights doctrine has indeed a long way to go before
being accepted, but if people start feeling guilty about using and
abusing any animal, that is a step in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   Ninie Murray</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Animal rights activists advocating that we should call ourselves
pet "guardians" instead of "owners" have got it backward. To me, pets
are the guardians, not us.</TE>
<TE>   Movie stars like Rin Tin Tin and Lassie had very lucrative careers
saving their guardians. St. Bernards and bloodhounds search after us
guardians dumb enough to get lost. And what about dogs of all breeds
searching burning buildings for victims or protecting little
children? And as for cats? Well, anyone with a cat knows that it
never has an owner--it has staff.</TE>

<LD>Re "Caring for Our Kids Should Be the Bottom Line," Commentary, Sept.
5: While Californians may sympathize with the plight of children
whose parents cannot afford to support them, Robert Fellmeth wrongly
insists that the state government is somehow responsible for bringing
them up instead.</LD>
<LD>   Tax dollars are perhaps the least efficient form of support for
any welfare program when you take into account the costs of forming
regulations, collecting from taxpayers, administration and
record-keeping and redistributing those dollars. Fellmeth's energies
would be better directed toward better planning by parents and
encouraging a reduction in state taxes so we could all afford to
contribute more to the United Way.</LD>

If Tricia Shore felt that "the Indian taught her," she could have
just picked up the wrapper and put it in the trash instead of
bemoaning the lack of a sense of responsibility in others. If we all
just did one thing, like pick up a piece of trash, maybe the world
would be a cleaner place. By the way, the Indian was Iron Eyes Cody.</LD>

<LD>Re "Bush Solicits Foreign Allies on Iraq Plan," Sept. 7: No war was
ever prevented by appeasement. We are doomed to repeat what we
haven't learned from history. We appeased Hitler by giving him
Czechoslovakia and Poland. The United Nations must demand that Iraq
allow the search for weapons or be declared a rogue nation.</LD>

<TE>   The White House's much-desired invasion of Iraq would not only
alienate us from most of our important allies but it would also
seriously undercut the war on terrorism while costing billions of
dollars and countless American lives. In other words, President Bush
and Vice President Dick Cheney pose a far greater threat to the unity
and well-being of our country than Saddam Hussein ever could. Please
stop these warmongering madmen before we have another Vietnam on our
hands.</TE>

<TE>   No one is denying that Iraq is a problem. However, there are a
multitude of reasons why not to begin a war on Iraq: We seem to be
far from through in Afghanistan, and dividing our attention and
resources is just stupid; we have little support around the world;
it's immoral and probably illegal; the main reasons for doing so are
to deflect attention from Cheney's problems. And the No. 1 reason for
invading Iraq--to avenge Papa Bush.</TE>

state for foreign affairs, as saying: "If the United States invades
Iraq, it will cause deep anti-American feeling and will provoke
revenge and violence in Arab and Islamic countries."</TE>
<TE>   Should we risk losing the goodwill, loyalty and friendship we
currently enjoy with the Arab-Islamic world merely to stop a
homicidal dictator from getting his hands on nuclear weapons? Duh! Of
course we should. These people already hate us. Anti-American
feelings, revenge and violence already exist in the Arab-Islamic
world. Why would we leave ourselves at Hussein's mercy merely to
appease people who already hate us?</TE>

<LD>As an incoming freshman at UC Irvine this fall, I am shocked and
appalled at the attitudes my fellow Southern Californian teens
displayed in "Teens Ready to Move On" (Sept. 8). Comments such as
being tired of not being able to watch the news without being
confronted with terrorism, war or grief shed telling light as to why
the U.S. is so hated by foreign powers. Teens of today--indeed,
Americans today--need to wake up and realize that terrorism, war and
grief are everyday experiences for most of the world.</LD>
<LD>   We should be tired of war; we should be fed up with terrorism.
However, as teenagers, we should also choose a more active approach
to ridding the world of these horrors than simply switching off the
television. If 9/11 had a purpose, it should be to jolt us to
awareness. Allowing this one-year anniversary to pass in the
self-centeredness that consumed Americans before 9/11 would be an
even greater tragedy than the destruction of New York's twin towers.</LD>

<TE>   Thank you for Richard Rodriguez's "The Day Before" (Opinion, Sept.
8). Rodriguez's prose is poetry--a calm, soothing voice helping to
quiet the cacophony of a tumultuous world. He is a man whose heart is
as gentle as his voice.</TE>
<TE>   Mayer Gerson</TE>
<TE>   Northridge</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The events of 9/11 taught me a lot. I learned that we Americans
are a proud, resilient and compassionate people. Unfortunately, I
also learned that we seem to have an endless capacity for exploiting
tragedy. The unblushing greed and shameless opportunism that have
arisen from that tragedy are staggering. There will be those who will
try to make economic or political hay on what should be a day of
quiet, thoughtful remembrance. I trust others will join me in saying,
to all who do so: "Shame on you."</TE>
<TE>   Susan North</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I believe that we should change the date on which Memorial Day is
celebrated to Sept. 11. Memorial Day is a time to remember and honor
those who have died in conflicts and wars. The original date of
Memorial Day (or "Decoration Day," as it was originally called), May
30, was arbitrary. The date was not chosen to commemorate any
specific event, and, in fact, Congress voted about 30 years ago to
change its celebration to the last Monday in May, to give us another
three-day holiday weekend. Too often the meaning of Memorial Day is
lost. Let's give back the meaning to Memorial Day as a time of
remembrance to our fallen: the victims of 9/11 as well as all those
who have died for our country and for freedom. Let us never forget.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Stillwell</TE>
<TE>   Dana Point</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Do you want to do something to commemorate 9/11? My suggestion is
to replace those weather-beaten and improperly displayed U.S. flags
that have hung night and day since Sept. 11. When you purchase your
new flag, the package will most likely contain a pamphlet on the U.S.
flag code. Please read and follow the instructions for proper
display. Finally, dispose of the old flag with the respect and
dignity it deserves. Our flag: Wave it proud, but wave it right.</TE>

<LD>Re "Government Pensions," letter, Sept. 9: As an employee of the
state of California for 34 years, my salary had about 6% withheld for
the pension fund, with interest rates set by the state, not the free
market. I am thus one of many thousands of state employees who are
receiving pensions of our own money. We are not "living off the
taxpayers."</LD>
<LD>   If civic coffers are now being strained, it's because money never
stays in a "lockbox" but gets spent elsewhere, and then has to be
repaid. It's still our money. Even taxpayers have to repay accrued
debts.</LD>

story? The Times has been trying unsuccessfully to make this event
into news ever since it happened. With all the significant and
newsworthy events happening elsewhere in the world, Chuck Philips has
to write about this drivel? And to put it on the front page? Come on!</LD>
<LD>   Give me a break. Who really did kill Tupac six years ago? I say

<HD>War Room's Eyes Out for Terror</HD>
<DH>Safety: Data center links the intelligence gathering of
police agencies statewide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hidden away in an industrial park in the City of Commerce is the
California Anti-Terrorism Information Center for Los Angeles County.
The sign near the entrance says it all: "War Room."</LD>
<LD>   Inside, on the walls, are four large screens, pinpointing major
law enforcement operations in progress. On a busy day, about a dozen
computer operators are needed to track it all.</LD>
<LD>   This isn't something out of a Tom Clancy book, where high-level
officials watch secret operations as they unfold via satellite feed.
At least not yet. The technology is limited: the computers, a couple
of TVs, the large locator screens.</LD>
<TE>   But officials say this is a crucial part of California's post-9/11
anti-terror network, intended to link 100,000 law enforcement
officers around the state. If a terrorist network in California is
ever to be found, state officials think the break might come at this
grass-roots level. And the California Anti-Terrorism Information
Center, or CATIC, could provide intelligence that paves the way.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably the one element in the whole anti-terror structure
that's going to give us the one nugget we need someday, that final
piece of the puzzle," said George Vinson, chief anti-terror advisor
to Gov. Gray Davis. "That's because the information coming into CATIC
is coming from street cops who are out there. While the FBI may end
up putting 80% of the puzzle together with the high-level
intelligence it gathers, I think it's going to ultimately come down
to the cop on the street who notices something strange one day."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Los Angeles County center, there are now
special state Department of Justice task force operations scattered
throughout the state. There is another room like this in Sacramento,
and there are offices in Fresno, Orange, Riverside, San Diego, San
Francisco, San Jose and Shasta counties.</TE>
<TE>   The California Anti-Terrorism Information Center system is one of
three components in the state's homeland defense network, Vinson
said.</TE>
<TE>   At the highest level are Joint Terrorism Task Forces run by the
FBI, involving the CIA and all major urban police agencies. Those
groups are deluged daily with secret global, national and local
intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Then come regional response teams known as Terrorist Early Warning
Groups, often headed by local sheriffs. These are assigned the job of
coordinating the immediate response to any terrorist incident.</TE>
<TE>   "We become the intelligence arm at the street level for everybody
else," said Ed Manavian, chief of the criminal intelligence bureau
for the state Department of Justice. "We work anything, and once we
find something we pass it along."</TE>
<TE>   The California Anti-Terrorism Information Center links them all.
Right after Sept. 11, state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer gave Manavian
responsibility for putting the center together. To move fast, he
borrowed from existing law enforcement systems whenever possible.</TE>
<TE>   Area police chiefs already had a drug-tracking system available
through the Los Angeles County Regional Criminal Information
Clearinghouse, and the California Anti-Terrorism Information Center
was allowed to share one of its rooms in the City of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   On any given day, symbols flashing on the room's large screens
show hundreds of drug raids and stakeouts in progress just in the Los
Angeles County area. The screens might locate one or two
anti-terrorist investigations. Officials expect it will pretty much
stay that way.</TE>
<TE>   Manavian sees drug dealing and terrorism as a natural pairing. He
believes that Al Qaeda terrorists entering California would have to,
at some point, hook up with local drug dealers linked to the Middle
East or possibly to East European crime groups that would have the
kind of money needed to help hide and protect the terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, a particular interest is the Middle Eastern
dominance in the smuggling of pseudoephedrine, a main ingredient of
methamphetamine, into the United States from Canada, where it is not
illegal.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of major busts in that area could help produce an
important informant or two down the line, Manavian said. That's often
how secret organizations are ultimately penetrated.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a major preoccupation for Manavian and other top state
and federal anti-terror officials is keeping communication lines open
and avoiding the kind of turf problems that arise frequently among
rival law enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   At all levels, officials say, there has been so much intelligence
to process this year that they have suffered from information
overload at times. But they are still at a stage where almost all
tips must be checked. A major goal for this year is improving
analysis capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as important that we get our information out as it is for
them to get their information to us," said FBI Assistant Director Ron
Iden, head of the Los Angeles division.</TE>
<TE>   "When anything strikes me as potentially important, I'm on the
phone personally to the top people in the LAPD and the Orange County
and Los Angeles [County] sheriff's departments. We all have to share
on this one."</TE>
<TE>   Still, at least some of the top-secret information received by the
FBI can be passed along only in general form for reasons of national
security.</TE>
<TE>   That was one reason for another decision made by Manavian and top
officials immediately after Sept. 11: They refused to accept any
information that could not also be legally passed on to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want people in the dark," said Vinson, the governor's
chief anti-terrorism advisor. "If there is a threat anywhere, law
enforcement will know about it. We will give it to them if they ask
or not."</TE>

<HD>Orange County Confirms Its Light-Rail Plan, in Miniature</HD>
<DH>Transit: Even the shortened line has critics, but the
Irvine City Council is expected to approve it tonight. Hubs in Santa
Ana to Irvine would be served.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Transportation leaders agreed Monday to move forward with a greatly
shortened version of the CenterLine project, turning a corner in
Orange County's bumpy effort to build an urban light-rail system.</LD>
<LD>   The line as now envisioned would be a modest 11.4 miles long,
running from the Santa Ana train station to the front steps of UC
Irvine, a huge retreat from the 28-mile line that had been planned
two years ago to link north and south Orange County. That plan was
shelved in the face of political opposition.</LD>
<LD>   Backing a recommendation from Irvine, one of three cities along
the shortened route, Orange County Transportation Authority board
members agreed to cut back an 18-mile proposal that would have ended
at the Irvine Transportation Center, a train, bus and parking hub
near the closed El Toro Marine base.</LD>
<TE>   By shortening the line, OCTA officials and Irvine city leaders say
they will avoid the political mess of running trains through Irvine
neighborhoods where staunch critics of the project live.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of people are opposed to transit," said Mike Ward, an OCTA
board member and Irvine councilman. "But we are trying to make
decisions that will affect the county 20 to 25 years from now, when
we will have 600,000 more people."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's decision sets the alignment for the tracks--billed as a
first phase--and will enable OCTA to meet a Monday deadline and apply
for hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds. Preliminary
engineering studies are underway, but a final decision whether to
build CenterLine will not be made until late 2003 or early 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The shortened route is scheduled to be considered tonight by the
Irvine City Council, which is likely to approve it. Greg Smith has
been the only council member opposed.</TE>
<TE>   Under the revised plan, OCTA estimates that CenterLine will cost
about $1.1 billion to build--$500 million less than the 18-mile
route--and carry about 31,600 passengers a day the first year of
operation. Service is tentatively scheduled to begin in 2011.</TE>
<TE>   CenterLine's southern terminus would be at UC Irvine near
University and Campus drives. The route runs north to the Irvine
Business Complex before heading to John Wayne Airport. It then turns
west along Main Street and Anton Boulevard to South Coast Plaza. At
Bristol Street, the tracks turn north again to Santa Ana's Civic
Center and ends at the Santa Ana Transportation Center, another
train-bus hub.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials note that within two miles of the proposed line are
415,000 residents, 340,000 jobs and popular destinations such as the
Orange County Performing Arts Center, the Bowers Museum of Cultural
Art and downtown Santa Ana's Artists Village.</TE>
<TE>   Planners also have proposed extending the line to Santa Ana
College, the sixth-largest community college in the state, with more
than 30,000 students and employees.</TE>
<TE>   Ward and Irvine Mayor Larry Agran had recommended that the line
end at Irvine City Hall, which is surrounded by residential
neighborhoods and major employers. But OCTA officials asserted that
UC Irvine would be more attractive to riders than a hub of city
government.</TE>
<TE>   "UC Irvine is an excellent final destination," Agran said. "The
route provides for a good point of study and sets the first operating
segment. It connects to John Wayne Airport, the Irvine Business
Complex and major job centers with one of the area's great
universities."</TE>
<TE>   Agran has said the route might be extended later to the Irvine
Spectrum commercial, retail and entertainment complex and the Irvine
Transportation Center via another route. The mayor and other city
leaders have envisioned a transit village of high-density development
at nearby El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   While the new route avoids neighborhoods opposed to CenterLine,
critics of the project said the change will not deter their efforts
to kill its Irvine leg, with officials' talk of extending the line
later.</TE>

and those he supports are elected, opponents say, they will renew
plans to push the line through town to the Irvine train station.
Agran denies his motives are self-serving.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, the opposition launched a petition drive to
qualify an anti-CenterLine initiative for the Irvine ballot, possibly
for a vote in March. Besides halting CenterLine there, the initiative
would remove any reference to light rail in the city's General Plan
and require voter approval of any light rail system in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no 'there' there, as far as destinations," said Bill
Mavity, treasurer of Fund Alternatives Instead of Rail Transit, an
opposition group. "It makes no sense, no matter how much they
truncate the line to keep it away from people."</TE>

<HD>Boy's Disappearance Still Baffles San Diego</HD>
<DH>Search: As Danielle van Dam case nears an end, mystery
continues over Jahi Turner's fate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The case of Danielle van Dam is heading toward closure, but the
search for another missing child in San Diego has grown cold and
police admit they have no new leads.</LD>
<LD>   The disappearance in late April of Jahi Turner, 2, unfolded much
like that in early February of 7-year-old Danielle: Neighbors and
police mounted a massive search, the media kept a vigil, and a
grieving family begged an unknown kidnapper to release the child.
Posters and buttons were distributed.</LD>
<LD>   Danielle's body was found within a month, and a neighbor, David
Westerfield, 50, has been convicted of her abduction and murder. A
jury is deliberating whether he should be executed or sent to prison
for life.</LD>
<TE>   But Jahi has yet to be found, nearly five months after he was
reported missing by his stepfather during an outing in Balboa Park.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's mother and stepfather have been questioned repeatedly by
police, and investigators have been unable to find witnesses,
fingerprints or other forensic evidence to validate the stepfather's
account that the boy disappeared when he left him alone near a
toddler's playground for a few minutes to get a soda.</TE>
<TE>   Police have declined to label the stepfather a suspect or rule him
out as a possible suspect. Meanwhile, the boy's father and paternal
grandmother accuse the stepfather of withholding information.</TE>
<TE>   Police who were assigned full time for weeks to find Jahi have run
out of leads and gone on to other cases, although they still hope for
a break. The volunteer search effort and reward drive fizzled, and
the Jahi story has dropped from headlines that have been dominated
for months by the trial of Danielle's killer.</TE>
<TE>   Cleared away is the makeshift memorial of poems, teddy bears and
flowers that neighbors and searchers erected at the playground where
Jahi's stepfather said he last saw the child.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like everything's a dead-end," said Malcolm Lambert, a
retired social worker who joined the search for Jahi and later took a
Greyhound bus trip to Maryland to meet with the child's extended
family. "It's very frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   Jahi's mother, Tameka Jones, a Navy seaman, and his stepfather,
Tieray Jones, no longer cooperate with the media or a private
investigator who is working on behalf of the child's father.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel they're being deceptive with us," said investigator Bill
Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   In the days after stepfather Tieray Jones reported that Jahi
disappeared, police scoured the neighborhood and the brushy canyons
near the family's apartment in the Golden Hill section of San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle's mother, Brenda van Dam, came to the Joneses' apartment
to offer emotional support to Jahi's mother. Many of the searchers
who had hunted for Danielle took up the same cause for Jahi.</TE>
<TE>   For a week in early May, dozens of police officers, Marines,
sailors and sanitation workers sifted through 5,000 tons of garbage
at the city dump--centering the search on an area where garbage from
Golden Hill is dumped.</TE>
<TE>   In July, police considered doing a similar search in another dump
near the U.S.-Mexico border. But Police Chief David Bejarano decided
against that move after being warned by health officials of possible
health hazards if officers and others combed through the
sludge-coated garbage.</TE>
<TE>   "The case is still a priority with us, but as time goes on, you
have to go on working other cases," said police spokesman David
Cohen. "If we got a major tip requiring significant manpower, we'd
move on it."</TE>
<TE>   The two cases made San Diego ground zero for the national
obsession this year over abducted children. And if the cases had an
emotional wallop on the city, they also may have had a practical
impact.</TE>
<TE>   Bejarano told a City Council committee last month that the
enormous amount of manpower assigned to the Danielle and Jahi cases
may have contributed to a drop in the percentage of homicide cases
solved citywide. Police solved less than a third of homicide cases in
the first six months of 2002, compared with more than half of such
cases the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   "You only have so many people to go around," said police Lt. Jim
Collins, noting that 50 detectives worked for a month on Danielle's
case.</TE>
<TE>   But Collins said that clearance rates for murders tend to
fluctuate and that the year-end rate may yet match that of 2001 as
police return to full caseloads. (San Diego has one of the lowest
violent crime rates of any large U.S. city and thus a change in
clearance rates can hinge on a few cases.)</TE>
<TE>   Danielle had lived most of her short life in the upscale Sabre
Springs neighborhood, but Jahi disappeared only four days after
arriving in San Diego to live with his mother and stepfather in the
blue-collar neighborhood just east of downtown. He had been living
with a grandmother in Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   When the child was reported missing, Tameka Jones, 18, was at sea
off San Diego aboard the USS Rushmore. She was airlifted to San Diego
and has been assigned to shore duty.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives in Frederick, Md., hold occasional candlelight vigils in
hopes that Jahi will soon be home.</TE>
<TE>   "I try never to be negative, to always pray to the Lord to help
poor little Jahi," said Dina Naylor, the mother of Jahi's father. "We
hope that maybe some couple who couldn't have children fell in love
with him, took him and will return him someday."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Naylor and other relatives are suspicious of Tieray Jones,
24, who had a series of arrests on suspicion of burglary and drug
possession in Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   "Lord forgive me if I'm wrong, but we just think that Tieray knows
something he won't say," Naylor said.</TE>

<HD>Plant Operators Oppose Bill on Radioactive Waste</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Veto is likely for measure that would halt
sending of materials to local landfills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The commercial operators of California's nuclear power plants have
lined up against a bill pending on Gov. Gray Davis' desk that would
kill their ability to send low-level radioactive waste to local
landfills.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which passed both houses of the Legislature with
bipartisan support, now probably faces a veto, according to the
office of state Sen. Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles), its co-author.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of the bill include Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Southern
California Edison, which own the only two working nuclear power
plants in California.</LD>
<TE>   A Davis spokesman said the governor had not yet taken a position
on the Romero bill. He has until the end of the month to decide
whether to sign it into law.</TE>
<TE>   According to a Romero consultant, Alan Gordon, the governor is
likely to veto it because the senator refused to amend the bill as
the Davis administration wished. The amendment would have allowed
some of the waste to go to landfills not licensed to handle the
material.</TE>
<TE>   If the legislation is vetoed, the state would have to promulgate
new rules for the deregulation of radioactive waste.</TE>
<TE>   All radioactive waste except for spent reactor fuel is classified
as low level. The classification can include highly toxic, long-lived
material, such as plutonium, strontium and cesium.</TE>
<TE>   Besides material from nuclear power plants, low-level waste
includes material from biotechnology companies, research labs,
hospitals and military installations.</TE>
<TE>   Under regulations promulgated by Davis in November--but struck
down by a court in May and again in August--a variety of low-level
waste could have gone to dumps and metal recyclers.</TE>
<TE>   Under the old regulations, waste powerful enough to produce the
equivalent of several hundred chest X-rays over a person's lifetime
would have been eligible to go to ordinary dumps.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, a Davis veto could make it possible for
low-level radioactive waste now being stripped from a mothballed
generator at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station just south of
San Clemente to be deposited in town dumps.</TE>
<TE>   However, an Edison spokesman emphasized that the company has
pledged to send any waste from that generator with detectable
radiation to facilities in Utah and South Carolina that are licensed
to handle nuclear waste.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot amplify enough that we made a constant decision with
Unit 1, that if we can measure it as being radioactive, we're going
to send it to a licensed facility," said Ray Golden.</TE>
<TE>   Golden said the company plans to press Davis to veto the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the bill is a bad law, the reason being that we don't
think it's based on good science and think it's inconsistent with
existing expert opinion," he said. "There are already existing
regulations that strictly spell out disposal of low-level radioactive
waste."</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E officials could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   San Onofre has two other working generators that are scheduled to
be decommissioned in 2022. A PG&amp;E plant in Central California, Diablo
Canyon, also has two nuclear generators scheduled to go off line in
less than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   The eventual disposition of low-level radioactive waste from these
four generators is unknown, and made more uncertain because there are
only two facilities in the country where California can send
low-level nuclear waste. One is scheduled to stop taking it in 2008,
and the other is expected to eventually run out of room.</TE>
<TE>   Romero, who said she has not heard personally from Davis' office,
remained hopeful. "It ain't over till the fat lady sings--that's how
I look at it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, I hope that, when the administration does evaluate
the merits of this bill, [officials will] weigh the health risks we
are trying to [minimize] as a priority over any corporate interest
represented by PG&amp;E and Edison," Romero said.</TE>
<TE>   "PG&amp;E and Edison are powerful. They have tremendous influence, but
I hope that at the end, the administration will evaluate that this
bill protects children."</TE>

<HD>Film Agency Donations Questioned</HD>
<DH>Politics: Affidavits cite a state commission's letter
classifying the L.A. corporation as a public entity, making political
contributions illegal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A seven-year-old letter from the state's campaign finance agency
raises questions about whether the organization that issues Hollywood
film permits can contribute to political campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors from the Los Angeles County district attorney's office
have cited the letter in their probe of possible misuse of public
funds by the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. The corporation
has contributed nearly $200,000 in four years to various political
committees, including more than a dozen run by elected officials who
sit on its board.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter issued at the agency's conception in 1995, an attorney
for the Fair Political Practices Commission concluded that the film
office is a "local government agency." State law forbids officers of
local agencies from contributing to political campaigns.</LD>
<TE>   The agency was formed by the Los Angeles City Council and county
Board of Supervisors to provide one-stop shopping for film permits
and to keep movie production in Los Angeles. In subsequent years, a
dispute has arisen on whether the film office is a public agency
responsible to taxpayers or a private corporation designed to wine
and dine Hollywood royalty and contribute to industry-friendly
politicians.</TE>
<TE>   County prosecutors cited the commission's letter in their
affidavit for search warrants that were served last week at the
agency's Hollywood headquarters, as well as the San Dimas home of its
president, Cody Cluff. Court papers describe an investigation into
the misuse of public funds by the agency through its lavish spending
on parties and meals and its generous political contributions. No
charges have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, attorneys for the film office repeated their contention
that the agency is a private, nonprofit corporation working under
contract with the city and county. They said the commission's
letter--written shortly before the agency was incorporated--is moot
and that the film office is entitled to spend money as it sees fit.</TE>
<TE>   "The FPPC is not the Legislature. It's an administrative agency
with no rule-making authority, and its opinion of its counsel is not
binding," said agency lawyer George Newhouse. "We're not aware of any
rule, law or regulation which would preclude EIDC from making
political contributions or spending money to promote the film
industry in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Newhouse and other attorneys argue that the entity operates as a
private contractor to facilitate film production. The legal power to
issue film permits that close streets for movie crews still resides
with the city and county governments, the attorneys argue, even
though almost all permits are issued through the agency. The
organization's $3-million annual budget comes from a portion of the
permit fees, the rest of which is passed on to the city and county.
"It's just an advisory letter, [from] Joe Blow over there," said Tom
Brown, an attorney for Cluff. "If and when the time comes for us to
litigate it, I believe there's enough law to determine otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles city attorney's office, then headed by Mayor James
K. Hahn, solicited the letter from the Fair Political Practices
Commission in the spring of 1995 to determine whether the state's
conflict-of-interest laws applied to the film office. In response, a
commission attorney wrote that the corporation was a public agency
and its officials were subject to the political reform act. In
affidavits supporting last week's searches, county prosecutors used
the letter to show that the film office is a public entity that must
comply with state laws. And in an interview last week, Dist. Atty.
Steve Cooley warned the corporation against using public funds to pay
for private defense attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who spearheaded the
creation of the film office, said in an interview Monday that he
always believed the agency was public and that he was troubled by its
campaign contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Though as mayor of Los Angeles Riordan sat on the corporation's
board--along with the members of the City Council and Board of
Supervisors--agency officials have said that politicians had a
hands-off approach to the agency and that most of its decisions were
made by its executives. Riordan said he did not find out about the
agency's political contributions until late in his City Hall tenure.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, I never intended it to go there, and I thought when I
first heard of it that it didn't pass the smell test," said Riordan,
who has since had a falling-out with Cluff. Riordan said that, as a
result of his misgivings, he directed his staff to remove him from
the agency's board. "I don't want to be on a board if I don't have
any control," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of Riordan's complaints, the film office began
restricting its contributions to ballot initiatives rather than
individual candidates, although it still hosts fund-raisers for
politicians and individual agency employees continue to donate money
to their campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy over the political contributions continued Monday
as proponents of Hollywood and San Fernando Valley secession gathered
in front of the corporation's Hollywood Boulevard offices to demand
additional state and federal investigations of the group's $10,000
contribution to the anti-secession campaign led by Hahn, a film
office board member.</TE>
<TE>   "The EIDC was set up to facilitate the film permit process in the
city, not to funnel campaign contributions to elected officials who
sit on its board," said Carlos Ferreyra of the Valley Independence
Committee, which also called for a county takeover of the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn solicited the contribution but sees nothing wrong with it,
according to Kam Kuwata, the political strategist for the mayor's
anti-secession effort. "Nothing wrong took place in terms of the
contributions," Kuwata said. "It's never surprising when people come
out against these [secession] proposals because they are bad ideas.
That is what the EIDC determined."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some politicians Monday were reconsidering whether they
should have accepted film office money in light of the commission's
letter.</TE>
<TE>   City Controller Laura Chick, who received $1,000 from the
corporation when she was a city councilwoman and on its board, said
she might have refused the donation had she known about the letter.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very clear to me that there are some questions about
governance and management of spending, and obviously this needs a
good hard look," Chick said.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), whose campaign committee
received $10,000 from the agency, also said she was unaware of the
letter. As the sponsor of a bill to keep movie filming in California,
Kuehl said she had not been surprised to receive film office funds.
"I assumed they were more of a private business," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar), whose political committee
received $8,500 from the organization, some of it while he sat on its
board as a city councilman, said he believed there was nothing wrong
with the contribution.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon, who solicited the money, said Cluff had assured him that
the donation was legal. "I took the contributions as their effort to
ensure elected officials were elected to promote the benefits of the
entertainment industry," he said, adding that he still believes the
agency is private.</TE>

<HD>Trawlers' Future Weighed</HD>
<DH>Fishing: U.S. officials study extended limits, possibly
affecting hundreds of boats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRESCENT CITY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>When Richard Young looks out over the harbor, he sees too many
fishing boats. One of them, an 80-foot wood-hulled trawler, is his.</LD>
<LD>   "Too many fishermen chasing too few fish," said Young, a burly
second-generation trawler captain who also has a doctorate in
resource economics. "The question is: What do we do about it?"</LD>
<LD>   The answer will come soon enough.</LD>
<TE>   Faced with rapidly declining ground fish populations that
triggered emergency action this summer, federal officials meeting in
Portland, Ore., this week are expected to recommend extending severe
limits on commercial fishing quotas along the Pacific continental
shelf. The new restrictions could last for years. The continental
shelf is home to 83 types of bottom-dwelling ground fish, including
the dwindling varieties of bocaccio rockfish usually sold in markets
as snapper.</TE>
<TE>   September and October are normally peak fishing months on the West
Coast. But except for a few fishermen selling deep-water albacore
filets from the decks of their moored boats, activity in this compact
seaport is already near a standstill. Several boats, grounded by
federal action this summer to protect species of rockfish, were in
dry dock. Trawler nets were stretched on the asphalt parking lot to
be repaired. Two former fish processing plants stood closed and
shuttered.</TE>
<TE>   "Fishing is going to be very much smaller and around the edges of
the shelf," said Burr Henneman, a San Francisco-based consultant for
the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. "The scary thing is that
these restraints are likely to go on for the rest of my life and for
the rest of my grandchild's life."</TE>
<TE>   The fishing restrictions, which began with a temporary ban on
continental shelf fishing in Southern California on July 1, are
expected to eventually shrink the 500-boat West Coast federally
licensed fishing fleet to half its current size. The impact could be
greatest in California, however, where 1,500 more boats, licensed by
the state, will be subject to the same fishing restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Federal studies show that commercial trawlers could meet existing
federal fish catch quotas with about one-third the number of boats
currently in the fleet. But the quotas would fall harder on the
state-licensed fleet, according to a Pacific Fisheries Management
Council report.</TE>
<TE>   It concluded that the state-licensed boats could catch their
entire limit but only if the fleet is reduced to about 10% of its
current size.</TE>
<TE>   The study was conducted two years ago when fishing quotas were
higher. "New scientific information suggests that the situation is
even more dire now," said Mark Powell, director of fish conservation
for the Ocean Conservancy, a Washington-based environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   The question facing policymakers from Washington to this
northernmost California port town is how to soften the blow for an
industry that is already struggling.</TE>
<TE>   "The fish need a break and the fishermen need help making the
transition to more selective gear and smaller fleets," said Karen
Garrison, co-director of the Ocean Protection Initiative for the
Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. "You can't
have a fishery without fish or fishermen."</TE>
<TE>   Young, 55, square-built with a sun-bleached walrus mustache,
favors a federal buyback program that would allow fishermen to retire
their boats at a fair price.</TE>
<TE>   This approach would avoid the painful death-by-attrition decline
of a fishing industry left to founder on its own. "We can shrink and
save the industry," said Young, 55, who was interviewed in the galley
of his trawler, the City of Eureka. "I just think we should shrink it
in a humane manner."</TE>
<TE>   However, a Pacific fisheries buyback bill co-sponsored by Oregon
Sens. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, and Gordon Smith, a Republican, met
heavy resistance in Congress when it came up this spring.</TE>
<TE>   A nearly identical bill in the House, sponsored by Santa Barbara
Democratic Rep. Lois Capps also went nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   Facing budget restraints, many members of Congress were reluctant
to approve more subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   "We really need federal leadership on this," said Kate Wing, an
ocean policy analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an
environmental group that supported the Wyden bill.</TE>
<TE>   "We are spending billions of dollars bailing out the airline
industry and we can't spare a few dollars for these people who were
told by their own government that there would always be fish? It
doesn't make sense."</TE>
<TE>   Wyden's original bill called for a fund of $50 million--half of it
in a federal loan to fishermen in the reduced fleet to buy boats and
fishing permits from those fishermen wanting to sell.</TE>
<TE>   But when that proposal stalled, the fishermen said they could
finance the buyback with just the $50-million loan.</TE>
<TE>   Wyden won approval for a $500,000 appropriation to secure the loan
and has not given up on getting more help for the fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   "A capacity reduction program is an essential step in addressing
the crisis facing West Coast fishers, and I'm working to make it
happen," Wyden said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government owes the West Coast fishermen something,
Young said, for encouraging the fleet to expand when a fleet of new,
highly efficient Soviet fishing boats began working Pacific coast
waters in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Congress reacted by passing the 1976 Magnuson-Stevens Conservation
and Management Act, which extended generous loan guarantees and tax
credits.</TE>
<TE>   The financial attractions were so great that they even lured
investments from non-fisherman looking for tax shelters. Many of them
ended up as boat owners.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly," Young said, "there were a lot more boats with a lot
better equipment."</TE>
<TE>   The improved fleet drove the Soviets from the shores, but it also
resulted in a classic overcapacity. The fleet was too big.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the Magnuson Act was based on the idea of a permanent,
abundant supply of fish.</TE>
<TE>   But by the late 1990s it was clear that the bigger fleets and
better equipment, including highly accurate tracking systems, were
taking a heavy toll on once-plentiful fisheries.</TE>
<TE>   Amendments to the Magnuson Act in 1996 essentially converted it
from an industry development tool to a conservation measure.</TE>
<TE>   New fish counts in recent years have produced alarming results.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the population of bocaccio, a popular Southern
California table fish, dropped by 95%, leading to the July 1 ban on
shelf fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Similar declines were noted in Northern California for the dark
blotched rockfish, which tripped off a fishing ban from Cape
Mendocino to Canada on Sept 1.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Fishery Management Council, meeting in Portland this
week, is expected to drastically reduce recommended quotas for
several species of ground fish. If approved by the secretary of
Commerce, the recommendations could essential extend the current
fishing bans for decades to come.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the once-proud and profitable coastal fishing
industry is likely to emerge as a shell of its former self--bringing
more bad news for Northern California fishing towns already reeling
from the decline of salmon runs and the collapse of the timber
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways timber and fishing are very similar," Young said.
"In both cases there is a sustainable yield of the resource. But if
you cut down too many trees, you run out of trees. If you catch too
many fish, you run out of fish."</TE>

<HD>Tough Graffiti Sentence May Send a Message</HD>
<DH>Vandalism: Incidents in Simi Valley stop after gang member
gets three years of weekly cleanup duty. Other cities seek similar
penalties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The way authorities tell it, 18-year-old gang member Rafael Escobedo
spent much of his teenage years scribbling graffiti on walls and
buildings throughout Simi Valley.</LD>
<LD>   In January, a business owner saw him at it again, and Escobedo was
arrested. He pleaded guilty to vandalism and spent several months in
jail.</LD>
<LD>   While most graffiti convictions result in minor penalties,
Escobedo's case was different. In addition to restitution, he was
ordered to spend eight hours every weekend for the next three years
cleaning up graffiti in his hometown.</LD>
<TE>   "After he got out of jail and told his friends about that,
graffiti in the city seemed to come to a screeching halt," said Mike
Nisito, Simi Valley's graffiti-abatement coordinator. "Some people
out there are now thinking twice about doing this."</TE>
<TE>   Police officials in neighboring cities applaud the stiff sentence
for Escobedo.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 20,000 incidents a year, and it's just costing the city a
fortune," Oxnard Police Assistant Chief Stan Myers said. "We're not
holding these people responsible for what they are doing."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County cities and the county spend nearly $825,000 a year
to clean up the scrawls of rival gangs and graffiti crews.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard tops the list, spending $450,000 a year to pay a
nine-person cleanup crew that cruises the city daily looking for
graffiti.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley ranks second, spending nearly $150,000 to paint over
between 800 and 1,000 markings reported each year. Ventura spends
$74,000 and Thousand Oaks about $60,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all over the place--from the nicest part of town to the
lowest part," said Warren Gaston, a Ventura maintenance worker who
handles that city's graffiti removal.</TE>
<TE>   Port Hueneme, Camarillo and Ventura County, which handles the
cleanup in the county's unincorporated areas, spend a total of about
$53,000.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula relies in part on the nonprofit Group Against Graffiti
for cleanup funds. The group has placed donation cans at various
businesses and holds rummage sales. From July 2001 through June, the
city spent about $9,300 to remove more than 300 graffiti markings.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby Fillmore has a graffiti cleanup budget of $29,000, which
pays for supplies and the salary of a part-time employee. That city,
according to Sheriff's Department statistics, had about 300 graffiti
reports last year.</TE>
<TE>   Ojai, which logged 78 incidents last year, relies solely on Group
Against Graffiti to raise money for cleanup work.</TE>
<TE>   Countywide, officials estimate that graffiti vandals scrawl more
than 50,000 markings each year. Only a fraction of the incidents are
ever prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   "The hardest thing with vandalism cases is that many of them don't
result in the identification of a suspect," said Deputy Dist. Atty.
Bill Redmond.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities agree that catching graffiti vandals is tough because
most commit their crimes at night. Graffiti vandals also change the
style and color of their scrawls to avoid detection.</TE>
<TE>   "So many times it's a random act," Nisito said. "And these people
are like cockroaches. Once the light goes on, they scatter. It's an
ongoing battle."</TE>
<TE>   According to the Ventura County district attorney's office, 333
adult misdemeanor and felony vandalism cases were prosecuted in 2001.
Since the start of this year, 240 cases have been prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of incidents of vandalism, which includes throwing a
rock at a window or keying a car, involve graffiti, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   But the figures do not accurately reflect the number of cases that
prosecutors receive because juvenile offenders--those responsible for
most of the county's graffiti--are often placed in a diversion
program. They can perform community service and pay a fine in
exchange for avoiding a criminal conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Diversion is available to any first-time offender who commits
graffiti vandalism that results in damage of less than $1,000, which
most cases do, Redmond said.</TE>
<TE>   In graffiti cases that are prosecuted, the most common sentence is
three years of unsupervised probation, five days of community
service--usually cleanup work on the freeways--and restitution.</TE>
<TE>   The Juvenile Court system bills the parents of a juvenile
offender. They are legally responsible for the debt if the minor
child fails to repay it.</TE>

stretched out over several months or years.</TE>
<TE>   Repeat offenders can receive jail or prison time. Graffiti
vandalism with more than $400 in damage can be charged as a felony
with a possible sentence of up to three years in prison, Redmond
said.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Chief Myers believes more needs to be done to stop
first-time offenders.</TE>
<TE>   "My question is: How many times do we put somebody on diversion or
informal probation? The feedback we are getting from the young people
we contact is that they don't worry about that."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Henderson, superintendent of Oxnard's parks and
facilities, echoed Myers' concerns. "We remove it, police arrest them
and the court system lets them go because they don't consider it a
problem."</TE>
<TE>   Redmond said though every case brought to his office with
sufficient evidence is prosecuted, most graffiti vandalism is a
misdemeanor crime, similar to petty theft.</TE>
<TE>   Escobedo's sentence was harsher because he also pleaded guilty to
being a gang member, authorities said. In addition to probation, he
is required to stay away from longtime gang friends.</TE>
<TE>   "I just recently got a call from the Probation Department about
him," said Nisito, the Simi Valley graffiti coordinator. "I guess
he'll be coming to help us out for a long time."</TE>

<HD>Katrin Cartlidge, 41; British Stage, TV and Movie Actress</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Katrin Cartlidge, the intense British actress best-known for her
performances in films by the director Mike Leigh, has died. She was
41.</LD>
<LD>   Cartlidge died Saturday at a London hospital of what was believed
to be blood poisoning and pneumonia.</LD>
<LD>   According to friends, Cartlidge had dinner with friends Friday
evening in London, but woke up during the night with the belief that
she had food poisoning.</LD>
<TE>   She was taken to a local hospital and died three hours later,
according to Bingham Ray, who distributed the Leigh films that
Cartlidge appeared in for United Artists.</TE>
<TE>   Born in London, Cartlidge was exposed to avant-garde theater and
art from an early age. She turned to acting in school to compensate
for the mild dyslexia and a slight astigmatism that gave the false
impression that she was of below-average intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   With no formal training in acting, Cartlidge began auditioning for
plays while still a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   To make ends meet, she worked as an art model and a dresser in
London theater before landing the part of Juliet in a production of
"Romeo and Juliet." She made her stage debut at the age of 18.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, she found regular work on television in the
British soap opera "Brookside."</TE>
<TE>   Cartlidge got her start in film in 1985's "Sacred Hearts." But it
was three central performances that established Cartlidge as a gifted
and independent talent: as David Thewlis' punkish lover in Leigh's
"Naked" (1993); as the protective sister-in-law in Lars von Trier's
"Breaking the Waves" (1996); and, most prominently, as a ruthless
cable news reporter in Danis Tanovic's Oscar-winning "No Man's Land"
(2001).</TE>
<TE>   Cartlidge was one of the two title characters in Leigh's "Career
Girls" (1997) and also made an appearance in his Gilbert and Sullivan
movie "Topsy-Turvy" (1999).</TE>
<TE>   Most recently she appeared in a BBC television version of "Crime
and Punishment."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with the Los Angeles Times some years ago,
Cartlidge called working with Leigh, "an extraordinarily exciting
process."</TE>
<TE>   "Mike's process is completely collaborative," she said. "At the
beginning, you simply agree to work with him, attempting to build a
character drawn from the entire melee of your own experience. You do
this work in a sort of vacuum with no knowledge of what the other
actors are doing, and Mike reviews the character with you
periodically.</TE>
<TE>   "He then decides which aspects of your character he wants to
explore and creates a very loose structure.... The most difficult
thing about working with Mike," she said, "is that it makes you
incapable of turning your mind off."</TE>
<TE>   Leigh, in turn, said Cartlidge brought a unique point of view to
her work.</TE>
<TE>   "Katrin is a total original," Leigh told the London Times some
years ago. "She's not frightened of ugliness or danger, you can see
from some of her roles; she confronts everything with courage. She's
very droll, sharp and perceptive, but also incredibly generous.</TE>
<TE>   "She's the last person who would ever get twitchy about other
people's performances," Leigh said. "She's an ensemble actor."</TE>
<TE>   Information on survivors was not immediately available.</TE>

<HD>Lucas Moreira Neves, 76; Brazilian Cardinal Mentioned as
Possible Pope</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardinal Lucas Moreira Neves, a former top Vatican official who once
was mentioned as a possible successor to Pope John Paul II, has died.
He was 76.</LD>
<LD>   Neves, who stepped down as prefect of the influential Congregation
of Bishops and president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin
America two years ago because of failing health, died Sunday while
receiving treatment in a Rome clinic, according to Vatican officials.</LD>
<LD>   A Brazilian, Neves served as archbishop of Sao Salvador da Bahia
for 10 years until called to the Vatican in 1998. The erudite Neves
emerged a decade ago as a commanding voice in Brazil, the world's
largest Catholic country.</LD>
<TE>   A conservative, he was considered to be resolutely on the
Vatican's side on contemporary issues facing the church, such as
contraception, abortion and the ordination of women.</TE>
<TE>   He was particularly outspoken on two issues, television and
Candomble, the Afro-Brazilian religion that blends Catholicism with
West African beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   He alienated many of Bahia's residents--more than 90% are
black--with his hard line against Afro-Brazilian religious practices
in church rites. The religions, he believed, should be clearly
separated.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Neves surprised the television industry by accusing
broadcasters of "appealing to the most base instincts" and creating a
generation of voyeurs.</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1925 in Sao Joao del Rei, Neves was the first of 10
children. He entered the Dominican order and was ordained a priest in
1950.</TE>
<TE>   Neves, who traveled to more than 70 countries, spoke six languages
fluently--Portuguese, English, Spanish, French, Italian and Latin.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, when Neves was on a short list of possible
successors to Pope John Paul II, church observers said his chances
were enhanced by his not being averse to tackling the issues of the
day. Neves had close ties to John Paul II, dating to when the pope
was archbishop of Krakow, Poland. John Paul promoted Neves to
archbishop in 1979 and to cardinal in 1988. In 1991, Neves hosted the
pope during his second visit to Brazil.</TE>

<LD>Rulon T. Jeffs, 92, the reclusive leader of one of the largest
polygamist sects in North America, died of natural causes Sunday at a
hospital in St. George, Utah.</LD>

polygamy more than a century after it was banned by the mainstream
Mormon Church.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffs, a retired accountant, was reported to have 19 to 75 wives
and dozens of children.</LD>
<TE>   Considered a prophet by members, Jeffs led a church whose
membership is estimated at 10,000. Most live in the twin border
communities of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Salt Lake City, Jeffs graduated from LDS Business College.
He became affiliated with the FLDS church in the late 1930s, and was
appointed a member of its priesthood council in the '40s.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffs was appointed president of the FLDS church in 1986.</TE>

<HD>Some Will Ride Train; Others Don't See It as the Answer</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Several along route say O.C.'s CenterLine
is a good idea; others insist rails would crowd streets even more.
The clincher for one man: 'I like my car.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The train, if it comes, will pass right outside the produce store
where Ray Bermudez works on Santa Ana's Bristol Street, a boulevard
teeming with the daily flow of life in one of Southern California's
most densely populated cities.</LD>
<LD>   Bermudez, 20, is not so sure a train is what the pedestrian-heavy
neighborhood needs.</LD>
<LD>   "Right now, a lot of people are getting killed by cars" in Santa
Ana, Bermudez said as he used scissors to snip a display card inside
the ProduMex Market, near the northern reaches of the latest planned
route for a light-rail system. "With a railroad, it would get even
worse."</LD>
<TE>   As the county's transportation authority moved Monday to designate
a final CenterLine route, people living along the proposed path were
not sure what to make of the prospect that trains will be added to
the mix on streets already crowded with people and cars.</TE>
<TE>   The latest route follows a north-south axis between the Santa Ana
Regional Transportation Center and UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   At the route's northern reach, Michael Lee sat on a shaded veranda
as he killed time waiting for a bus. An unemployed auto-body worker,
Lee, 39, lives in Norwalk but spends a lot of time in Orange County,
where he was born.</TE>
<TE>   Homeless and car-less, Lee relies on buses--and trains, when he
can afford them. A light-rail system, he said, would help a lot of
people who need it--particularly if it took people to jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's anything like Metrolink, it would be great," Lee said.
"It would help the Hispanic community especially."</TE>
<TE>   From the Santa Ana station, the proposed route cuts west through
old neighborhoods squeezed between downtown Santa Ana and Interstate
5.</TE>
<TE>   Patty Madrigal, who does her family's wash in a coin-operated
laundry there, glanced out the window at where the trains would run.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be great," she said, but admitted she probably
wouldn't use it because she lives in Tustin and has a car. But others
could use it. The route south, she said, is a major commuter path for
a city that she feels has grown too big too fast.</TE>
<TE>   From eastern Santa Ana, the train would continue through the heart
of the county office complex, where the sidewalks are filled with
name-tagged government workers and dark-suited lawyers scurrying
along with bulging briefcases.</TE>
<TE>   At Bristol, at an intersection anchored by a gas station and a
medical clinic, the route cuts due south, through commercial strips
and neighborhoods to the glittering retail promise of South Coast
Plaza, where on Monday Jimmy Hart was about to have a jeweler install
a battery in his watch.</TE>
<TE>   Hart, 69, is all for the proposed light-rail line. He lives in
Irvine, and though he doesn't get to South Coast Plaza very often,
he'd take a train if it were running.</TE>
<TE>   "Everywhere you go it's cars, cars, cars. I'd take the train. I'd
jump on it just to go someplace."</TE>
<TE>   From South Coast Plaza the train would zigzag southeast, past
hotels and office parks, bean fields and John Wayne Airport before
taking a couple of final jogs along San Diego Creek to the edge of UC
Irvine, where Florence Guzman, 19, is studying psychology.</TE>
<TE>   Guzman lives in an apartment near campus, and near Leo Mendoza,
19, an economics major.</TE>
<TE>   Neither thought they'd have much use for a train, even if it did
go to their university. Guzman said she rarely goes to Santa Ana. "It
doesn't go where we go," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it will come to my apartment," Mendoza added.</TE>
<TE>   But what if it were more convenient? What if it did go places you
wanted to go? Would you use it then?</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza thought for a minute. "No," he concluded, then laughed. "I
like my car."</TE>

<TE>   Orange County transportation officials and civic leaders have

commissioning studies, quarreling over routes and negotiating
compromises.</TE>

class and culture as it links neighborhoods in Santa Ana and southern
Irvine with industrial zones, office parks and schools.</TE>
<TE>   At the route's northern reach, Michael Lee sat on a shaded veranda
rolling a cigarette from a bag of tobacco as he killed time waiting
for a bus to take him to a local welfare office.</TE>
<TE>   An unemployed auto-body worker, Lee, 39, lives in Norwalk but
spends a lot of time in Orange County, where he was born.</TE>
<TE>   Homeless and car-less, Lee relies on buses--and trains, when he
can afford them--to get around. A light-rail system, he said, would
help a lot of people who need it--particularly if it took people to
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's anything like Metrolink, it would be great," Lee said as
passengers boarded a southbound Amtrak train for San Diego. "It would
help the Hispanic community especially."</TE>
<TE>   From the Santa Ana station, the proposed route cuts westward
through old neighborhoods squeezed between downtown Santa Ana and the
Santa Ana Freeway, a matrix of homes and apartments, churches and
small businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Patty Madrigal, who does her family's wash in a coin-operated
laundry there, on Monday glanced out the window at where the trains
would run.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be great," she said, but admitted she probably
wouldn't use it because she lives in Tustin and has a car. But others
could use it. The route south, she said, is a major commuter path for
a city that she feels has grown too big too fast.</TE>
<TE>   "People need to travel out of Santa Ana to work," Madrigal said.</TE>
<TE>   From eastern Santa Ana, the train would continue through the heart
of the county office complex, where the sidewalks are filled with
name-tagged government workers and dark-suited lawyers scurrying
along with bulging briefcases.</TE>
<TE>   At Bristol, at an intersection anchored by a gas station and a
medical clinic, the route cuts due south, through commercial strips
and neighborhoods to the glittering retail promise of South Coast
Plaza, where on Monday Jimmy Hart was about to have a jeweler install
a battery in his watch.</TE>
<TE>   Hart, 69, is all for the proposed light-rail line.</TE>
<TE>   He lives in Irvine, and though he doesn't get to South Coast Plaza
very often, he'd take a train if it were running.</TE>
<TE>   "Everywhere you go it's cars, cars, cars. I'd take the train. I'd
jump on it just to go someplace."</TE>
<TE>   From South Coast Plaza the train would zigzag southeast, past
hotels and office parks, bean fields and John Wayne Airport before
taking a couple of final jogs along San Diego Creek to the edge of
UCI, where Florence Guzman, 19, is studying psychology.</TE>
<TE>   Guzman lives in an apartment near campus, and near Leo Mendoza,
19, an economics major.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Mendoza was helping Guzman learn how to drive, advising
her from the passenger seat as she maneuvered across a near-empty
parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Neither thought they'd have much use for a train, even if it did
go to their university.</TE>
<TE>   Guzman said she rarely goes to Santa Ana, finding herself more
often in the nightclubs and shopping districts of Costa Mesa. "It
doesn't go where we go," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it will come to my apartment," Mendoza added.</TE>
<TE>   But what if it were more convenient? What if it did go places you
wanted to go? Would you use it then?</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza thought for a minute as an afternoon breeze ruffled the
eucalyptus trees above.</TE>
<TE>   "No," he concluded, then laughed. "I like my car."</TE>

<HD>Uzi Gal, 79; Invented Popular Israeli Submachine Gun in
1954</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Uzi Gal, who invented the Uzi submachine gun favored by military
commandos, Secret Service agents, underworld figures and a variety of
Hollywood film characters, has died. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Gal, who had suffered from cancer and other illnesses for many
years, died Saturday in his Philadelphia home.</LD>
<LD>   First made in 1954 by Israel Military Industries, the weapon has
been sold in 90 countries.</LD>
<TE>   More than 2 million guns have been produced, making hundreds of
millions of dollars for Israel, but not a shekel for Gal, who was a
government weapons expert.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Germany, the son of a painter, Gal fled to England with
his parents in 1933 when the Nazis came to power. Three years later,
the family moved to Palestine and the Kibbutz Yagur near Haifa.</TE>
<TE>   Uzi attended technical school and showed an early proclivity for
inventing weapons. At 15, he created a bow that could automatically
fire arrows.</TE>
<TE>   Before he could complete an engineering degree, he was recruited
by Palmach, the elite unit of the pre-state of Israel army Hagana to
head its armaments department. In 1943 he was imprisoned by the
British, then in control of what would become Israel, for carrying
weapons illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Released three years later, Gal became a force in weapons
development in the fight for independence and later in the postwar
Israel armament industry. He became adept at designing computer
programs to build weapons as well as the weapons themselves.</TE>
<TE>   But his best-known creation would be the Uzi and its variations.</TE>
<TE>   The low-cost gun known for its reliability and simplicity, with
its short barrel, limited recoil and 100-round magazine in the
handgrip, made an immediate impact in the mid-1950s.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great moment for the state of Israel," Gal told a London
newspaper in 1997. "Because never in 2,000 years had there been such
a thing: A weapon that the Jewish people had made for themselves, and
I designed it from the ground up."</TE>
<TE>   The Netherlands became the first country outside Israel to buy
Uzis for its army in 1958, and Belgium and Germany quickly followed.</TE>
<TE>   Israel forces notably utilized the Uzi in the 1967 Six-Day War and
in their daring hostage rescue operation at Entebbe Airport in Uganda
in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   The gun was etched in American consciousness in 1981 when a Secret
Service agent was photographed brandishing an Uzi after the attempted
assassination of President Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   The Uzi also has appeared in less heroic photographs of street
gangs, drug lords and other criminals and on movie screens in the
hands of the villains.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of notoriety prompted a Barbara Walters television
special more than a decade ago stressing the dangers of permitting
Uzis and other automatic weapons to fall into the public's hands.</TE>
<TE>   But an Israeli Military Industries official reported that sales
doubled the day after the program appeared.</TE>
<TE>   "I suppose even bad people can recognize the best," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gal moved to Philadelphia some years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But he continued to design weapons for Israel, especially guns
that could be sold in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   No information on survivors was available.</TE>
<TE>   Gal will be buried Thursday in Kibbutz Yagur in Israel.</TE>

<LD>Beverly Hills police said they are investigating a complaint that
Apollo 11 astronaut Edwin E. "Buzz" Aldrin struck a man in the face
Monday after the man asked Aldrin to swear on a Bible that he had
been to the moon.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives said they responded to a disturbance Monday at the Luxe
Hotel on Rodeo Drive and took a report from Bart Sibrel, 37, who said
he was battered by the 72-year-old astronaut. Aldrin, who took part
in the 1969 lunar mission, was gone when police arrived about 4:30
p.m. and was not interviewed, said Beverly Hills Police Lt. Joe
Lombardi.</LD>
<LD>   Sibrel said he does not believe Aldrin or anyone else has ever
walked on the moon.</LD>

<LD>A 10-hour police standoff at an Anaheim carwash ended early Monday
when officers discovered that two would-be robbers were not inside
the building.</LD>
<LD>   The daylong incident began when the manager of the Sunkist Carwash
saw three men he believed were going to rob the business at Lincoln
Avenue and Sunkist Street, said Police Sgt. Mike Hidalgo.</LD>
<LD>   Unaware that any suspects were inside, the manager told employees
to lock up and leave. After the manager called authorities from a
neighboring business, he saw one of the three men inside the
carwash's office, where the safe is located, police said.</LD>
<TE>   When officers arrived, they arrested James Daniel Smith, 23, of
Santa Ana on suspicion of attempted robbery and being under the
influence of drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Smith told them that two armed men were still inside.
A SWAT team tried to negotiate with the men, first by bullhorn and
then with a cell phone that they tossed into the carwash. Ten hours
later, police discovered that no one was inside.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good possibility that when the manager called police, the
other two suspects walked out of the business," Hidalgo said. "We had
to go with the latest information that we got, and it was 'They're in
the business, and they're armed with handguns.' "</TE>
<TE>   Hidalgo doubted the men escaped once police were on the scene.</TE>

<HD>Community College Enrollment Up 4%</HD>
<DH>Education: Officials are relieved that spending scandal
appears to be no deterrent for students.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Total enrollment at Ventura County's three community colleges jumped
4% this year, indicating that a widely publicized spending scandal
involving the district's top administrator hasn't affected students'
desire to attend the campuses, acting Chancellor Jim Walker said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Newly compiled figures show a combined enrollment of 35,904, up
from 34,686 last year. Enrollment at Moorpark College is up 4.98%,
Oxnard 1.09% and Ventura 5.38%.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe we do a lot of really good things, and we want to take
this opportunity to brag about the great job the three colleges in
this district do," Walker said at a news conference at the district's
headquarters in Camarillo.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the number of full-time students--those taking a course
load of 12 hours or more--attending the three campuses is 10,689, a
6.3% increase over last year. State and federal money is awarded to
the district based on full-time enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   The increase in students is welcome news to a college system that
has been mired for months in controversy surrounding the spending
practices of Chancellor Philip Westin.</TE>
<TE>   Walker said an investigation is continuing into allegations of
misappropriation of public funds and malfeasance by Westin and other
officials, outlined in a class-action lawsuit filed in July on behalf
of county taxpayers. Westin, who continues to collect his $203,000
annual salary, has been placed on administrative leave during the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Walker said it is unclear when the probe will be completed,
despite continuing pressure and protests from the public and faculty
members calling for Westin's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Revelations that Westin spent $119,000 between 1998 and 2001 on
such things as meals, computers and car repairs surfaced last spring
as the school year was ending. He was placed on administrative leave
in July, when school was out of session.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Westin has threatened to file a lawsuit against the
district if the five-member board of trustees doesn't act quickly on
his future. Board members have said they will take as long as they
need to complete their probe.</TE>
<TE>   The trustees also have come under fire for failing to rein in
Westin's spending during his six-year tenure. An earlier audit and
review showed that the chancellor did not violate district policy or
break any laws.</TE>
<TE>   Trustee Art Hernandez, who recommended earlier this year that
Westin receive a $30,000 raise, and trustee John Tallman, a longtime
Westin foe, are up for reelection in November. Board President Norm
Nagel has bowed out of the race.</TE>
<TE>   While the specter of lawsuits and investigations hovers in the
background, Walker said the business of the college district is
moving forward. The district will present a balanced budget to the
board of trustees next week with no classroom or staff reductions.</TE>
<TE>   The district also has sold its first issue of bonds recently in a
total $365-million package approved by voters in March. The money
will be used to upgrade and expand the three aging campuses to handle
future growth. This year's rise in enrollment marks the eighth year
of enrollment increases, Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark College President Eva Conrad noted that her campus has
reached its capacity of 15,000 students but retains a lot of vacant
land that could be developed.</TE>

<HD>Brush Fire Threatens Glendale Homes</HD>
<DH>Blaze: Power to one area is cut and residents of Verdugo
Mountains evacuate as flames race north and northwest. Cause is
unknown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A brush fire swept across the Verdugo Mountains above Glendale and
Burbank on Monday, charring 800 acres and prompting evacuations of
dozens of homes, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   There were no injuries and no homes were damaged, fire officials
said. But the blaze, of undetermined origin, was only 20% contained
by 8 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   For a while, a column of dark smoke was visible from miles away.</LD>
<TE>   Flames threatened a group of transmission towers used to relay
radio and cellular phone signals, causing Glendale officials to cut
power to that area. With the lack of electricity, local radio
stations were forced to run on backup power supplies, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 310 firefighters representing agencies from Santa
Barbara to Orange County, aided by two water-dropping planes, three
fixed-wing aircraft and eight helicopters, were battling the fire,
which broke out around 11:45 a.m. near the Brand Park library, north
of the intersection of Mountain Street and Grandview Avenue, said
Glendale Fire Capt. Thomas Marchant.</TE>
<TE>   No firefighters were hurt, but a Glendale policeman directing
traffic away from the fire was struck by a motorist and suffered
injuries to his right shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Early Monday afternoon, Jean Essa contemplated what she, her son
and husband should take with them after mandatory evacuation orders
were issued by fire officials for 33 homes on Thurber Street and Via
Alta, tranquil canyon streets on the Burbank-Glendale border.</TE>
<TE>   Essa, a high school teacher, said that every year, she asks
students in her morality classes about what they would take with them
if their house were on fire.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I've given this some thought," she said as she loaded up
her car with insurance papers, a cat, photos and a painting.</TE>
<TE>   By 8 p.m., the evacuation order had been lifted, although the Red
Cross set up shelters for people who did not want to return home.</TE>
<TE>   The steady march of flames appeared to slow in midafternoon under
a heavy aerial assault from the helicopters. At one point,
firefighters thought the brush fire might burn out as the flames hit
the upper reaches of the Verdugo Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   By late afternoon, however, the fire had crossed the peaks and
continued to head northward toward La Crescenta and west toward
Burbank. By evening, firefighters were concentrating on the western
flank. Voluntary evacuations were underway in the Whiting Woods
community of north Glendale, as well as the streets Via La Paz and
Paseo Redondo in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   Few residents appeared to be leaving the Whiting Woods area. "We
would certainly take off if they told us the fire was coming and we
had to," said Brock Hill, 44, who lives on Whiting Woods Road.</TE>
<TE>   Local homeowners association President Denis Brumm, 49, watched
the fire through field glasses from his home on Hillway Drive. He
said he and other residents felt confident that the firefighters
would protect their community.</TE>

<HD>Dad Jailed After 3 Kids Found in Locked Auto</HD>

<LD>An Anaheim father was arrested on felony child-endangerment charges
Monday after police said he left his three young daughters in a hot,
locked car for at least half an hour. The girls escaped serious
injury.</LD>
<LD>   Geoffrey Chiedozie Onyekwere, 36, was being held at Cypress City
Jail pending payment of $10,000 bail after police found the
girls--ages 4, 3 and 3 months--locked in a car in the parking lot of
Cypress College. The temperature outside was 85 degrees, police said.</LD>
<LD>   "They were sweating, scared and hot," said Lt. Jeff Kepley of the
Cypress Police Department. "They were obviously in the first stages
of dehydration. We believe they were in the car between 30 and 45
minutes."</LD>
<TE>   Police arrived at 12:40 p.m., Kepley said, after being called by
campus security guards who had discovered the girls locked in the car
with the front windows rolled down about 3 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Officers did not resort to breaking into the car, Kepley said, but
reached in to unlock a door or persuaded the girls to open one.
Paramedics determined that the children did not need hospitalization.</TE>
<TE>   While paramedics were evaluating the girls, Kepley said, their
father returned, explaining that he had been conducting business on
campus. "We believe he may be a student or prospective student," the
officer said.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids are going to be fine, but we're trying to get the
message out," Kepley said. "We were lucky on this one, but it was a
very dangerous situation--the kids could have died."</TE>
<TE>   All three girls were taken into protective custody by the Police
Department pending transfer to Orange County Child Protective
Services, Kepley said. Police were unable to contact the children's
mother, and Onyekwere was uncooperative in helping find other family
members, he said.</TE>

<HD>Supervisor Burke Joins Foes of Breakup</HD>
<DH>Secession: She says a study shows a split would harm her
constituents and L.A. in general.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said Monday that she
opposes San Fernando Valley secession because she is convinced a
breakup would harm her South Los Angeles district and its large black
population as well as the entire city.</LD>
<LD>   Burke said she based her conclusion on a study she commissioned.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't believe it's good for the African American community,"
she said.</LD>
<TE>   Burke also came out against Hollywood secession, although it was
not part of the study by Eugene Grigsby, a professor at the UCLA
School of Public Policy and Social Research.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisor planned to discuss Grigsby's report Monday night at
a public meeting at a Crenshaw-area church.</TE>
<TE>   Grigsby found that secession would pose financial problems for the
Valley city and the rest of Los Angeles, and that African Americans
would have no political clout in a Valley city dominated by
non-Latino whites. The study also found, however, that blacks might
temporarily gain clout in the remainder of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leader Richard Katz said the Grigsby report was "a
conclusion in search of a justification" to oppose the breakup. He
noted that studies by the Local Agency Formation Commission found
that secession would not cause financial harm to the Valley,
Hollywood or Los Angeles. Those studies allowed the breakup measures
to be placed on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes no sense," Katz said of Grigsby's report.</TE>
<TE>   Grigsby's study considered factors that LAFCO did not, such as the
current economic downturn and pledges by Valley secessionists to
slash business taxes, which he said would force the Valley to raise
other taxes or cut services.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is it's going to be extremely financially
difficult for the new Valley city to survive," Grigsby said. "They
will undoubtedly have to increase taxes or fees."</TE>
<TE>   His findings include:</TE>
<TE>   * Los Angeles spends $1,245 per person on services, but a Valley
city would have $776 per capita to spend.</TE>
<TE>   * Revenue growth for the rest of Los Angeles would be hurt as the
"alimony" a Valley city paid Los Angeles would decline each year. The
20 years of payments are designed to make Los Angeles whole for lost
tax revenue. Los Angeles would also lose revenue if a Valley city is
able to woo new businesses to the area.</TE>
<TE>   "The ability of the remainder of Los Angeles to grow economically
becomes more challenging," Grigsby said.</TE>
<TE>   * More Valley households are sliding into poverty, meaning the
region's costs in public services will increase.</TE>
<TE>   "They will inherit all the problems of big cities that big cities
have been trying to solve for decades," Grigsby said.</TE>
<TE>   If voters approve the breakup, African Americans would go from
11.1% to 14.9% of the population in Los Angeles, and would be 4.5% of
the Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   Grigsby said secession could result in more African Americans
being elected to Los Angeles city offices in the short term, but that
Latino population growth would quickly overtake those gains.</TE>
<TE>   Burke disputed Grigsby on that point, saying African American
political clout could grow. But she said that was not enough reason
to support secession.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the economic implications--the loss of resources
for services, the loss of tax base--in my mind that outweighs
whatever the political advantages might be," Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   Burke is the second county supervisor to oppose secession,
following Gloria Molina. Supervisor Mike Antonovich supports a
breakup; Supervisors Zev Yaroslavsky and Don Knabe have not taken a
public position.</TE>
<TE>   Burke said she will campaign against the secession measures
independently of Mayor James K. Hahn's antibreakup drive.</TE>

<HD>Freeway Labor Isn't Just Construction Work</HD>
<DH>The number of babies born on the way to hospitals is
rising. Some say traffic congestion is one of the reasons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baby, oh, baby, traffic is really getting bad.</LD>
<LD>   Every year, Southern California's worsening traffic costs us
billions of dollars in lost productivity. It is blamed for some of
the filthiest air in the nation. It adds stress and irritation to our
daily lives, forcing us to spend less time with our families and more
time with death grips on our steering wheels.</LD>
<LD>   Now, it seems our unyielding freeway congestion may be taking its
toll on moms and their newborns.</LD>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the number of children born on the way to a
hospital increased from 175 in 1997 to 204 in 2000. And some
health-care professionals believe our sluggish freeway speeds are
partly to blame.</TE>
<TE>   Freeway births are still very uncommon. Only one out of every 790
births in the county takes place on the way to a hospital or medical
center, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Health
Services. There are, of course, other factors that could be at play,
such as the long list of medical centers and clinics that have closed
in recent years, making the trip to a delivery room longer. Also,
more and more people lack easy access to transportation and spend
precious time scrambling for rides to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   While the numbers are small, some health-care officials are
wondering if the worst traffic congestion in the nation is making
more of those trips to the hospital longer than an expecting woman
can wait.</TE>
<TE>   How bad is traffic?</TE>
<TE>   Freeway speeds in the county have dropped to an average of 37 mph.
Half of the freeways in the county operate beyond capacity. Rush hour
has turned into a "peak commute period" that extends from 6 a.m. to 9
a.m. and from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. Los Angeles-area motorists spend an
average of 136 hours a year in rush-hour congestion.</TE>
<TE>   With that kind of gridlock, it make sense that at least a few of
Los Angeles County's 160,000 births each year would get snagged in
bumper-to-bumper traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. T. Murphy Goodwin, chief of maternal-fetal medicine at USC's
Keck School of Medicine, said the number of "in transit" births is so
small (only 0.1% of all births) that the increase may be
statistically insignificant.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Juliann Desmond, director of women and children
services at White Memorial Medical Center in East Los Angeles, said
the increase could be caused by an increase in the number of pregnant
women who are not taught to recognize the signs that a baby is on the
way.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Firefighter Richard Houle, a veteran of more than 30
years, agreed. He said most of the women he has helped give birth on
the way to hospitals had been unaware of the physical signs of labor
and had waited too long before getting help.</TE>
<TE>   But Desmond added: "Being a daily commuter, I see that traffic
could be a contributing factor."</TE>
<TE>   Firefighter Delays</TE>
<TE>   Houle also noted that traffic has become a growing problem for
firefighters trying to get to an emergency. "That accounts for most
of our delays," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reason, some hospitals officials say "in transit"
births are almost a regular occurrence.</TE>
<TE>   "It happens every six to eight weeks," said Carol Lee Thorpe,
spokeswoman for St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood. She said the
most recent birth to take place on the way to her hospital happened
about two months ago.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most publicized "in transit" births in the area took
place in 1998 when an Agoura Hills housekeeper helped deliver her
daughter's baby girl in the back seat of a two-door compact car on
the side of the Ventura Freeway. The baby came out limp and seemingly
lifeless. But she made a full recovery, thanks to her grandmother,
Esther Sanchez, who performed CPR, which she said she had learned
from watching television.</TE>
<TE>   When a quick-thinking grandmother is not around, paramedics or
police officers often help out when a baby makes an unexpected
entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Two Los Angeles Police Department officers were patrolling near
Van Nuys in November 1998 when Andrew Greene pulled up to the
officers to ask for help with his wife, Carmina Perez, who was giving
birth in the back seat of their van.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Paul Lopez rushed to a nearby home to retrieve some clean
towels, while Officer Kosal Bun helped deliver the baby girl, who was
born with her umbilical cord wrapped around her neck.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics eventually transported the mother and child to the
hospital, where both recovered fully.</TE>
<TE>   Health-care professionals say labor is usually much shorter after
the first baby, and perhaps these "in transit" births can be
attributed to mothers who don't anticipate the shorter delivery time.</TE>
<TE>   Internet message boards such as www.birthstories.com are pregnant
with stories of women who gave birth on a freeway shoulder or street
curb. One such story recounted the drama when a pregnant woman and
her husband were stuck in Friday night traffic in West Los Angeles
and gave birth on the shoulder of the San Diego Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The baby was affectionately known as "Freeway Sammy."</TE>
<TE>   Because of such births, many birth instructors make it a point to
remind expectant mothers to plan their drives to the hospital, to
consider alternate routes and to take a few practice drives.</TE>
<TE>   Tour First</TE>
<TE>   "We even give people tours [of the hospital] so people don't get
lost and give birth in the parking lot," said Teresa Peters, a Lamaze
instructor at Huntington Memorial Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Several companies have even figured out a way to capitalize on
this fear by marketing emergency birth kits. Each includes a blanket,
an umbilical cord clamp, gloves and a syringe to clear the baby's
nose and mouth of mucus. The kits come in packages that fit under the
passenger seat. One is sold with this ominous warning: "When a
pregnant woman goes into labor, one of her worst fears is not getting
to her birthing center on time."</TE>
<TE>   Many times the pregnant mothers get to the hospital in time to
give birth--but just barely.</TE>
<TE>   At White Memorial Medical Center, a woman gave birth a few years
ago in the reception area bathroom before hospital workers had a
chance to admit her. Four women from the admitting staff, including a
nursing student, helped deliver the baby girl on the floor of the
restroom.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great feeling of accomplishment," said a nursing
student, Rebecca Zarate.</TE>

<HD>Texas Man in L.A. County Tested for West Nile Virus</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A second probable case of West Nile virus has surfaced in Los Angeles
County, this time in a middle-aged Texas man who authorities believe
contracted the infection from a mosquito bite in his home state.</LD>
<LD>   The Houston-area man became ill with encephalitis while visiting
relatives in the county in late August, and has been hospitalized
here for about two weeks, said Dr. Jonathan Fielding, the county's
public health director. The man remembers being bitten by mosquitoes
in Texas.</LD>
<LD>   The probable case comes after Friday's announcement that a young
woman who lives in the southwestern part of the county very likely
contracted viral meningitis from a West Nile virus. If her diagnosis
is confirmed, she would represent the first human case of West Nile
acquired west of the Rocky Mountains.</LD>
<TE>   Lab tests for West Nile were inconclusive for a third person, a
young Las Vegas woman hospitalized in Los Angeles for encephalitis,
an inflammation of the brain that can be caused by West Nile. The
woman had recently traveled to the Houston area, although health
officials do not know if her trip fell within the West Nile
incubation period of three to 14 days.</TE>
<TE>   The Houston man and Las Vegas woman are recovering, Fielding said.
The third person has recovered.</TE>
<TE>   None of the victims were identified, to protect their privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Fielding said additional tests are required in all three cases
before a final diagnosis can be made. The tests will look for the
presence of antibodies to West Nile and rule out other types of
infection.</TE>
<TE>   Tests have been negative in three other people, Fielding said.</TE>
<TE>   The two cases disclosed Monday, if confirmed, would not be
considered California infections under federal guidelines because
they weren't acquired here. In recent days, other Western states have
reported at least four other West Nile cases that were acquired east
of the Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, 985 people have been diagnosed with West Nile
virus in 30 states and the District of Columbia. Forty-three people
have died. On Monday, New Jersey became the latest state to report
its first infections to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Two people were diagnosed.</TE>
<TE>   West Nile is harbored in birds and transmitted to humans by
mosquitoes. About one infected person in five shows mild symptoms,
which include fever, headache and nausea. About one in 150 require
hospitalization.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, health officials first detect the presence of West Nile
in a region by testing mosquitoes, dead birds, chickens and horses.
But as of Monday, all such tests in California have been negative.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County began spraying mosquito-killing chemicals more
than a year ago, knowing that the West Nile virus would eventually
reach the area.</TE>
<TE>   Fielding said people can minimize their risk by avoiding
mosquito-infested areas at dawn and dusk; wearing long-sleeved shirts
and long pants outdoors; using insect-repellent products with no more
than 35% DEET for adults and 10% for children; and ensuring that
windows have intact screens.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also advised against allowing pools of water to
stagnate. They recommended cleaning and chlorinating swimming pools
and draining water from pool covers.</TE>
<TE>   Californians who see birds that have been dead for less than 24
hours are asked to report them to health authorities at (877)
968-2473. Authorities will test for the presence of the virus. Los
Angeles County has also set up a general information hotline: (800)
975-4448.</TE>

<HD>Security Efforts Have Made L.A. Safer, Hahn Says</HD>
<DH>Preparation: Extra officers will be deployed Wednesday,
even though no terrorist threats have been received.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To reassure residents that Los Angeles is safe, Mayor James K. Hahn
said Monday the Police Department will deploy more officers
throughout the city on Wednesday, the anniversary of the terrorist
attacks on New York and the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   "We're taking all the necessary precautions to ensure the safety
of Los Angeles," the mayor said at a news conference held with other
city officials at the city's Emergency Operations Board Room, four
floors below city offices. "We don't have any information whatsoever
about any threats to Los Angeles or its citizens, but we are being
very vigilant nonetheless."</LD>
<LD>   The LAPD will be on a citywide tactical alert, meaning that it
will have one-third more officers available from tonight until after
midnight on Wednesday. Officers will conduct more patrols, and such
specialized units as the bomb squad, hazardous materials teams and
the air support unit will be available at a special location where
they can quickly respond to an emergency, according to LAPD Cmdr.
Mark Leap.</LD>
<TE>   Additionally, the city's Fire Department, which is already on
heightened alert for brush fire season, will be prepared to respond
to any emergency, the fire chief said.</TE>
<TE>   The city's stepped-up security plans for Wednesday mirror efforts
across the country. Other cities, including New York and some in New
Jersey, for example, are planning heightened public law enforcement
presences.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor used the approaching anniversary of the terrorist
attacks to review the city's security measures implemented since last
year. Overall, the city has conducted an assessment of
security-related needs in all departments, including the airport and
the Department of Water and Power. Hahn said the city has spent $70
million in security improvements since Sept. 11 and identified $130
million worth of additional improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Among those measures already taken are:</TE>
<TE>   * The mayor has unveiled his $9.6-billion plan for upgrading LAX
terminals with a focus on security.</TE>
<TE>   * The Board of Water and Power Commissioners approved a
$132-million plan to protect the city's water supply from sabotage.</TE>
<TE>   * The LAPD identified 450 potential high-risk targets, such as
entertainment venues, government buildings and religious
institutions, and developed plans for improving security at those
locations.</TE>
<TE>   * The city is participating in an early warning terrorism task
force that works with local, state and federal agencies to share
information and identify potential risks.</TE>
<TE>   "The city," Hahn said, "is safer today than it was a year ago."</TE>
<TE>   And, the mayor vowed to continue strengthening security. "As long
as necessary, we're going to continue to guard Los Angeles and its
residents from those who believe that terrorism is an acceptable way
to make their point," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD is planning a training program, set to begin in the
spring, for all officers to learn new ways of responding to potential
terrorist attacks. Assistant Chief J.I. Davis said the department is
developing the training program that relies in part on advice from
security experts in other parts of the country and the world. The
LAPD sent officers to Israel, for example, to examine efforts there.</TE>

<TE>   Food for thought: In his bestseller "Fast Food Nation," author
Eric Schlosser notes that after McDonald's opened in San Bernardino,
it adopted a winking chef named Speedee as its mascot. But a problem
arose when a mascot named Speedy was created for an upset-stomach
remedy--Alka Seltzer. "It seemed unwise to imply any connection,"
Schlosser wrote. And so poor Speedee lost his job to Ronald McDonald,
that clown.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting game: In one of his witty commentaries for KNX-AM (1070)
radio, Kent Shocknek told of a neighbor who has devised a sadistic
system for dealing with annoying telemarketers.</TE>
<TE>   When the solicitor calls, the neighbor reacts enthusiastically, in
order to allay suspicions. Then he asks the telemarketer to hang on a
sec while he finds a pencil.</TE>
<TE>   But he really goes back to what he was doing.</TE>
<TE>   Four minutes or so later, he comes back to the phone, apologizes,
and says he's sure he'll find a pencil if the caller can just hold
on. He lets four more minutes pass and repeats the process. And keeps
repeating it until the caller gives up. I think Shocknek said he's
kept some on the line for 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   This exercise should be turned into an Olympic event.</TE>

<HD>Davis, Simon Agree to Debate Oct. 7</HD>
<DH>Politics: The face-off is the first to be scheduled,
although both camps say others are possible. The debate will be
televised in L.A., San Diego and perhaps elsewhere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD and MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and his Republican challenger Bill Simon
Jr. agreed Monday to debate Oct. 7, according to spokesmen for each
campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The debate, sponsored by The Times, is the only one that both
candidates have agreed to attend. But their spokesmen said they might
schedule more.</LD>
<LD>   In 1998, Davis and his Republican opponent Dan Lungren held four
debates.</LD>
<TE>   The Times debate in Los Angeles is to be televised live at noon on
KTLA in Los Angeles and KSWB in San Diego. Both stations are owned by
Tribune Co., which owns the Los Angeles Times. Details for broadcast
in other parts of the state remain under discussion.</TE>
<TE>   California Public Radio stations also will carry the debate.</TE>
<TE>   The debate will not include any minor-party candidates. For any
further debates, Simon is pushing to include the Green Party
candidate, Peter Camejo. But Davis has refused, saying that Simon
singled out the minor party most likely to siphon votes from the
Democratic nominee.</TE>
<TE>   The other gubernatorial candidates on the ballot are Reinhold
Gulke of the American Independent Party; Gary David Copeland,
Libertarian Party; and Iris Adam, Natural Law Party.</TE>
<TE>   Campaigning in San Francisco and Santa Barbara on Monday, Simon
dismissed speculation he might drop out of the race after a series of
campaign missteps and setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to let the voters decide on Nov. 5," he told reporters
in San Francisco. "I'm not concerned with what people say about the
campaign.... If we run a good, strong campaign between now and Nov.
5, we're going to win."</TE>
<TE>   Simon and his advisors hope to get a boost this week from the
judge handling a fraud case that has hurt his campaign. A jury found
in July that the candidate's investment firm, William E. Simon &amp;
Sons, had defrauded a partner.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing this morning in Los Angeles, lawyers for the firm
asked the judge to set aside the $78-million verdict against William
E. Simon &amp; Sons. The judge could rule as soon as today.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Simon tried to shift the campaign's focus to education.
In a speech to several hundred members of the Commonwealth Club in
San Francisco, he said Davis had failed to improve the performance of
failing schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knows a third of our schools are failing," he said. "We
can't stand for that."</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Roger Salazar disputed Simon's charge, saying that
the governor had improved schools through tough accountability
measures, more teacher training and smaller classes.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, after a generation of neglect, California schools
are moving in the right direction," Salazar said. "Under the Davis
administration, school performance has improved four years in a row."</TE>
<TE>   But Simon said more is needed. He proposed a plan that would give
troubled schools two years to improve. If no progress was made, the
principal would be fired and a state "rescue team" would take over.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who are not adequately trained, those that are not
adequately leading our schools, need to be directed to a new line of
work," Simon said.</TE>

<HD>Judge Asked to Halt Owens Valley Water Flow to L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angered by delays in restoring the long-dry lower Owens River, two
conservation groups asked a judge to halt the exportation of ground
water from the Owens Valley in eastern California by the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power.</LD>
<LD>   The action, if approved by Inyo County Superior Court Judge Edward
Denton, would represent a substantial hit to the city's water
supplies. In most years, the DWP sends at least 15,000 acre-feet of
ground water--or 4.9 billion gallons--south to Los Angeles from the
valley.</LD>
<LD>   That's a small percentage of the city's supply, but it's enough
water for about 75,000 people for a year and would cost more than $5
million to replace, the DWP said.</LD>
<TE>   The judge is scheduled to meet with lawyers in the case Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Bagley of the Sierra Club said the only way the DWP will
honor a 5-year-old commitment to provide water for the lower Owens
River is if the agency feels its water supply is threatened.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this will get their attention," Bagley said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the DWP agreed to put a steady flow of water back into 61
miles of the lower Owens, which largely dried up after Los Angeles
began diverting river water into the city's aqueduct in 1913. Under
the recent agreement, some of the restored water, after flowing 61
miles, would be pumped back into the aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the deal, the DWP agreed to collaborate with the Inyo
County Water Department on an environmental study of the project and
release it for public review by June 2000. The agencies missed that
deadline and three others since.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP recently asked the court to push back the latest deadline
from Sept. 30 to Nov. 18; the Sierra Club and the Owens Valley
Committee asked Friday for the ground water shutdown.</TE>
<TE>   Bagley said the delays fit into what he sees as a long-standing
pattern in the valley.</TE>
<TE>   "They want the project delayed," he said. "The DWP realizes it has
a huge budget for lawyers, and spending hundreds of thousands of
dollars fighting this legally is still cheaper than losing that
water."</TE>
<TE>   "We can understand their frustration and sympathize with them over
the delays," said Gene Coufal, manager of the Los Angeles Aqueduct
for the DWP. "It's taking longer than anyone anticipated."</TE>
<TE>   Coufal said it's worth the time to get the study right, because a
flawed report would further delay the Owens River restoration.</TE>
<TE>   A recurring problem has been a dispute between environmentalists
and the DWP over the size of the pump that would draw water from the
river to the aqueduct. The environmentalists and Inyo County
officials contend that the pump proposed by the DWP would leave too
little water in the river.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP says the pump is needed to recover surplus water supplied
to the river.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 30 years, a series of lawsuits and agreements has
forced the DWP to surrender vast amounts of water it once took from
the Owens Valley.</TE>

<HD>Prayer Ban for Public Meetings Upheld</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California city councils that begin meetings with an invocation will
have to reassess that practice after a state appellate court on
Monday upheld a ban on sectarian prayer in such settings.</LD>
<LD>   The 2nd District Court of Appeal rejected the city of Burbank's
argument that the ban violates the free-speech rights of the
ministers who lead the invocation at each Tuesday's City Council
meeting.</LD>
<LD>   The court ruled that a prayer that invoked the name of Jesus
Christ "conveyed the message that Christianity was being advanced
over other religions," in violation of the establishment clause of
the 1st Amendment, which requires the separation of church and state.</LD>
<TE>   Santa Monica attorney Roger Jon Diamond, who represented the
plaintiffs, was pleased with the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, as of today, it becomes a precedent throughout the state of
California," he said. Local city officials "would be violating their
oaths of office if they allow sectarian prayers to go on."</TE>
<TE>   Burbank Chief Assistant City Atty. Juli C. Scott was disappointed
with the ruling, but said the city has not yet decided whether to
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad," she said. "I think the court missed the whole
point. We shouldn't be in the business to tell people how to pray."</TE>
<TE>   The case arose after Irv Rubin, chairman of the Jewish Defense
League, attended a Burbank City Council meeting In November 1999 that
began with a Christian prayer led by David King, a Mormon bishop, who
ended with "in the name of Jesus Christ."</TE>
<TE>   Subsequently Rubin, along with Roberto Alejandro Gandara, a
Christian, sued the city.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Alexander
Williams III issued an injunction banning sectarian prayer at council
meetings. Ever since, the City Council has asked local ministers to
offer nonsectarian prayers at its meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Diamond said Monday that he would not be able to tell Rubin about
the decision until today, when he plans to visit his client at the
Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, where Rubin
awaits trial on unrelated charges that he plotted to bomb a Culver
City mosque and a congressman's office.</TE>
<TE>   In the 15-page opinion, written by Justice Kathryn Doi Todd, the
court contended that "to demand neutrality when the interests of
religion and government intersect is increasingly more important as
our nation becomes more pluralistic."</TE>
<TE>   The court also rejected Burbank's argument that the invocation is
"private speech" and found "that any legislative prayer that
proselytizes or advances one religious belief or faith or disparages
another" is unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   "By directing the prayer to 'Our Father in Heaven ... in the name
of Jesus Christ,' the invocation conveyed the message that the
Burbank City Council is a Christian body, and from this it could be
inferred that the council was advancing a religious belief," Doi Todd
wrote. Justices Michael G. Nott and Judith Ashmann-Gerst concurred.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney T. Peter Pierce filed a friend of the court
brief on behalf of 34 California cities that begin their meetings
with prayer.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce said he would advise city attorneys, but warned of
potential problems. "I think it is very difficult to determine what
is [sectarian] and what is [nonsectarian]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The appellate court, however, declined to consider his argument
that the ban is ambiguous and unenforceable.</TE>

<HD>Town, Anglers Fight Over Rich Trout Stream</HD>
<DH>Outdoors: Mammoth Lakes' plan to divert some water will
harm fabled Hot Creek, fishermen say. Town says it seeks to balance
environmental needs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a setting known for its burbling creeks and snowy peaks--and
increasingly for its luxury condos and golf courses--anglers are
accusing the town of Mammoth Lakes of a water grab that will allow
the resort community to grow at the expense of a beloved trout
stream.</LD>
<LD>   Only two miles long, Hot Creek holds a special place in the hearts
of anglers in California. With the Eastern Sierra massif as a
backdrop, this celebrated stretch of stream is where several thousand
fly fishermen have gone each year for decades to test their mettle
against wily, plump trout, all of which must be released as soon as
they are caught.</LD>
<LD>   Now, to augment the town of Mammoth Lakes' relatively meager water
supplies, the local water district is proposing a slight change in
the way it diverts water from Mammoth Creek.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal has anglers in an uproar because they say the
diversion would eventually damage the trout waters of Hot Creek,
which is fed, in part, by Mammoth Creek. The amount of water at stake
is small, but the conflict has raised questions about the pace of
development in the mountain town, which wants to compete with the
swankiest resort communities in the western United States, such as
Park City, Utah, and Vail, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a world gone crazy, and it's so sad, because this is one of
the great places to trout fish in California and the world," said Jim
Edmondson, executive director of Cal Trout, an environmental
organization.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Mammoth Lakes has faced a vexing problem. Despite
abundant runoff from 10 to 30 feet of snow most winters, the amount
of water that the Mammoth Community Water District can take from the
local creek is restricted by laws designed to ensure that the stream
has adequate flows for fish.</TE>
<TE>   The town has asked the state Water Resources Control Board to ease
those restrictions on numerous occasions, but the requests were
ultimately rejected in 1994. In response, the town went to nearby
Mono County Superior Court, which approved the new limits in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   But there was a caveat. For those limits to become permanent, the
district had to complete an environmental study and then go back to
the state water board for approval. That study is now at the center
of the dispute. The water district contends that the study proves
fish wouldn't be harmed in Hot Creek. Anglers claim otherwise. The
state water board is expected to make its decision early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Water district spokesman John Moynier said the new limits would
not change the overall amount of water the district can take from
Mammoth Creek each year, but rather would allow the town to take more
from the creek during summer, when the water is needed most. He
conceded that the new limits might result in less water in the creek
in dry years, but he said numerous studies have shown that the fish
wouldn't be affected.</TE>
<TE>   "We've spent 14 years and over a million dollars trying to make
these [limits] permanent," Moynier said. "I know it's been
characterized as a water grab, but that's a misunderstanding of the
project. I would think the fishermen would support this because it
always guarantees some water for the creek."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to receiving flows from Mammoth Creek, Hot Creek is
fed by a series of springs that keep its waters unusually warm,
meaning trout can fatten up on insects year-round. The California
Department of Fish and Game estimates that there are more than 5,500
trout per mile in the stream, with most between 11 and 17 inches
long--an impressive size for wild fish in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Anglers fear that reduced flows in Hot Creek over many years would
slowly erode the quality of the trout habitat. The primary concern is
that reduced flows in Mammoth Creek during a prolonged drought would
cause the waters, both in Hot Creek and downstream in the Owens
River, to become too hot for the trout.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the [water] district does care about the environment, but
I don't think they really understand what the effects will be if they
take more water from the creek," said Bill Nichols, manager of Hot
Creek Ranch, which caters exclusively to anglers.</TE>
<TE>   Edmondson, of Cal Trout, is intensely critical of Mammoth Lakes,
saying that the city is jeopardizing the environment that is the
area's main draw. "It's like throwing the baby out with the
bathwater," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that Mammoth Lakes is outgrowing its water supply and
worried that the conflict might be a harbinger of things to come in
the region.</TE>
<TE>   Mammoth Lakes officials and developers have long wanted the town
to become a destination ski resort capable of attracting more people
from throughout the country, particularly on weekdays, when business
on Mammoth Mountain drops steeply.</TE>
<TE>   Toward that end, development in Mammoth has soared in recent years
and plans call for construction of about 2,600 more condominium units
or luxury homes in coming years, according to town officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The town does have a vision statement, and protecting the
environment is one of the four things we are trying to do," said
Karen Johnston, a senior city planner. "We also want to be a
successful high-quality resort. The environment is part of what we're
selling, and it's a balance we're trying to maintain."</TE>
<TE>   Moynier, of the water district, said the town has sometimes been
cavalier about approving development before firming up its water
supplies. He said he also has witnessed a shift in building in town,
with an increased emphasis on million-dollar homes and water-hungry
landscaping.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the state water board grants the new limits, Moynier said,
additional sources of water for Mammoth Lakes will have to be sought
in the future. The town already has several ground-water wells and
would probably have to drill more. That prospect worries anglers, who
fear the wells could dry up springs feeding Hot Creek and the Owens
River.</TE>
<TE>   Darrell Wong, a biologist with the state Department of Fish and
Game, said Mammoth is a microcosm of what's occurring throughout the
state. Facing the dueling inevitabilities of drought and growth,
every city is trying to shore up its water supplies.</TE>
<TE>   "The danger here is that if the state water board chooses for more
water to come out of the creek, that means this isn't a fully
appropriated basin," Wong said. "That means another party could
someday come along and apply to take more water out of the creek.
There could be a death from 10,000 cuts in the offing unless someone
comes along and draws a line."</TE>
<TE>   A final environmental impact statement on the proposal probably
will be released in November, and the water district hopes to have a
decision from the state water board in the first half of 2003.</TE>

<HD>City May Help Pay for Gym</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousand Oaks would contribute up to $1 million toward construction
of a gymnasium at the new Sycamore Canyon School under a proposal to
be considered by the City Council tonight.</LD>
<LD>   The 600-student school opened Aug. 29 for kindergartners through
sixth-graders. Plans call for adding at least two classroom buildings
and a gym at the 14 1/2-acre campus in the next few years to
accommodate seventh-and eighth-graders.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Andy Fox has recommended setting aside $1 million from
a $6.35-million fund paid by the developers of the Dos Vientos
housing project in Newbury Park. The Conejo Valley Unified School
District would need to find $2 million more to pay for the gym.</LD>
<TE>   "We're delighted by the city's generosity," said Gary Mortimer,
the district's assistant superintendent of business services. "We
envision a gym in the future over there, but it's going to be largely
contingent on available funding."</TE>
<TE>   Council candidate Michael Farris, a former Planning Commission
chairman, said he surveyed more than 150 Newbury Park residents over
the weekend about how best to spend the $1 million. The leading
suggestion, he said, was to transform a former Albertsons grocery
store in the neighborhood into a teen center.</TE>
<TE>   Other suggestions included using the money to create recreational
facilities, such as a bowling alley, BMX park or Olympic-size
swimming pool.</TE>

<HD>Suspected Hate Crimes Rise 11% in County</HD>
<DH>Report: The Human Relations Commission attributes the surge
to post-9/11 violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suspected hate crimes increased by 11% in Los Angeles County last
year, a surge fueled by post-Sept. 11 attacks on Middle Eastern
immigrants and others believed to be of Middle Eastern descent,
county officials announced Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission recorded 1,031
alleged hate crimes in 2001--compared with 933 in 2000. The total is
the highest recorded since the county began keeping statistics 21
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Of the suspected hate crimes, 188 were committed against
individuals or groups because of a belief that they were Muslim or of
Middle Eastern descent, according to the commission's report titled
"Compounding the Tragedy: The Other Victims of September 11."</LD>
<TE>   In 2000, there were 14 reported attacks on Middle Easterners.</TE>
<TE>   The crimes last year ranged from a possible murder to graffiti
motivated by anti-Muslim sentiments after the terrorist attacks on
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, said Robin Toma, executive
director of the commission.</TE>
<TE>   "By and large, Americans and the world stood together in support
of the victims and against terrorism. But there was a dark side that
also emerged," Toma said. "If the tragedy of the East Coast terrorist
attacks were not enough, another tragedy began to unfold soon after.
It was marked by Americans attacking other Americans."</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary report by the commission in December noted about 92
suspected hate crimes in reaction to the terror attacks. But Toma
said when final reports were collated from law enforcement and public
agencies countywide, the number of incidents more than doubled. That
resulted in the highest number of annual hate incidents in the
commission's history, breaking the 1996 mark of 995 suspected hate
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Some incidents the commission listed as hate crimes, however, were
not deemed by the police agencies investigating them, including the
sole slaying. Adel Karas, 48, a grocer from Egypt and a Coptic
Christian, was shot to death on Sept. 15 in his San Gabriel store.
His relatives contended his ethnicity was the motive, but sheriff's
investigators say they have not developed any evidence thus far that
it was anything more than a robbery turned fatal. Karas' family,
however, has persuaded the FBI to investigate the murder as a
possible hate crime, and the commission said it appeared to be
ethnically motivated because of the timing and the fact that no money
was taken from the shop.</TE>
<TE>   The commission did not include the fatal shooting of Abdullah
Nimer, 53, a Palestinian American and father of six, during an Oct. 3
carjacking while selling clothing door-to-door in South Los Angeles.
Three suspected gang members have been charged in connection with
Nimer's death. It was among the incidents the commission considered a
hate crime in the preliminary report in December, but that finding
was changed because of the circumstances of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   More than four out of 10 incidents against those of Middle Eastern
origin in 2001 were criminal threats. The Islamic Center of Claremont
received several threatening phone calls, including one caller who
said, "You bombed our country. We are going to bomb your place."</TE>
<TE>   However, some incidents did involve violence. A woman in a La
Mirada parking lot was called a terrorist by three men who tore off
her head scarf, or hejab, and slapped, bit and kicked her, Toma said.</TE>
<TE>   There were several incidents involving mistaken identity. Several
Sikhs, who wear turbans but are not Muslim and are rarely from Middle
East, were targeted, as were Latinos, a Native American and a Jewish
American, Toma said.</TE>
<TE>   In San Dimas, a Latino man was forced by a car with six men to
pull over on the Foothill Freeway. They pulled the man out of his car
and threatened him at gunpoint for being from the Middle East, only
to hear him address them in Spanish. The assailants then left without
striking the victim.</TE>
<TE>   Race and ethnic origin, according to the report, remains the
motivation in 46% of reported incidents. While the number of alleged
hate crimes against African Americans, Latinos and Jews declined,
anti-Asian hate crimes climbed by 40%, rising to 42 incidents from 30
in the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Suspected hate crimes based on sexual orientation also rose 9%
from the previous year. The number of incidents against gay men
decreased slightly, but the number of anti-lesbian crimes rose from
25 to 37. Six out of 10 hate crimes involving sexual orientation
resulted in physical violence, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Bus Routes to Run in Wee Hours</HD>
<DH>Transportation: OCTA adds late-night service at the request
of passengers. The move should ease the commutes of graveyard-shift
workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Service on four Orange County bus routes is being extended to 24
hours this week to help graveyard-shift workers who commute in
carpools, bicycles or on foot in a suburban region where
round-the-clock mass transit offerings have been spotty.</LD>
<LD>   Two routes that will add "night-owl service" between midnight and
4 a.m. are north-south routes that run from Brea to Newport Beach, La
Habra to Costa Mesa. The others are east-west lines linking central
Orange County with Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Transportation Authority is adding four buses
that will travel each route once an hour during the early morning
period. Regular bus service begins at 5 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   The extended hours were added in response to passenger requests,
OCTA spokesman Michael Litschi said. He estimated that as many as
200,000 additional riders will use the expanded service.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a lot of comments from people on the graveyard shifts,"
Litschi said. "There are a fair number of people who will be served."</TE>
<TE>   Reina Schmitz, political community organizer for Service Employees
International Union Local 1877, said expanded service will mean many
janitors won't have to walk home if they miss their rides.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of them end up walking from Irvine to Santa Ana when they
lose their ride or their ride calls in sick," Schmitz said. "Many
people who give rides to workers feel obligated to work when they are
sick because they know others depend on them for rides."</TE>
<TE>   Osiris Nava, a night janitor who earns $6.75 an hour, takes a bus
to work. When she works a five-hour shift, she can sometimes catch
the 11 p.m. bus returning from Irvine to Santa Ana. But if the
30-year-old mother from Santa Ana works longer and misses that bus,
she waits until 2 a.m., when friends who do drive finish their
shifts. She helps them do their work so they can all drive home
sooner.</TE>
<TE>   The expanded service is not on the route nearest her home, but
Nava said it will help her co-workers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this will be something that will get everyone to the bus
stop," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ofelia Olvera works from 6 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. as a janitor in
Irvine. She takes a bus to work, but often walks the six miles to her
home in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just me," Olvera said. "There are many of us, sometimes
seven of us, who are walking and walking. It takes an hour and half.
We get scared sometimes because it's silent. We're doing it for our
children, so they can get ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Olvera said the new service will cut her walk to about two miles.</TE>
<TE>   The routes adding "night-owl" service are:</TE>
<TE>   * Route 43 between La Habra and Costa Mesa, running along Harbor
Boulevard with stops at Fullerton College, the Fullerton
Transportation Center; the Anaheim Convention Center area, and
Triangle Square in Costa Mesa;</TE>
<TE>   * Route 57 between Brea and Newport Beach, running along State
College Boulevard and Bristol Street, with stops at the Block in
Orange, South Coast Plaza, the Newport Transportation Center and
Newport Beach's Fashion Island;</TE>
<TE>   * Route 60 between Santa Ana and Long Beach, running along
Westminster Boulevard, with stops at Cal State Long Beach and the
Long Beach Transit Mall;</TE>
<TE>   * Route 50 between Orange and Long Beach, running along Katella
Avenue, with stops at Disneyland and the Mall of Orange.</TE>

<HD>College Student Reported Missing</HD>
<DH>Police: Alex Zingaro's parents, who live in Lake Forest,
distributed fliers at Cal State San Marcos and in Carlsbad, where he
has an apartment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last time anyone reported seeing Alex Zingaro, he was sleepily
trying to get out of bed so that he could begin his second day of
waiting tables.</LD>
<LD>   But the 22-year-old college student never showed up, and he hasn't
been found for nearly a week.</LD>
<LD>   At Zingaro's apartment in Carlsbad, his surfboard and wetsuit
remain untouched. His newly pressed shirt for work is still in the
closet.</LD>
<TE>   Zingaro was reported missing Thursday evening by his parents, who
live in Lake Forest. They spent the weekend passing out fliers and
distributing his picture in Carlsbad and at Cal State San Marcos,
where Zingaro is a junior communications student.</TE>
<TE>   Police on Monday said they could have a break in the case: one of
Zingaro's credit cards has been used twice since his Sept. 4
disappearance. Investigators were checking surveillance cameras and
receipts to see who used the card.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no evidence of foul play, but we've kept working at it,"
Carlsbad Police Lt. Jim Byler said. "It's a mystery right now."</TE>
<TE>   Police said the credit card was used at gas stations in Colton on
the day Zingaro was reported missing and in Escondido last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, there has been no trace of Zingaro, who got a job on
Labor Day as a waiter at Tony Roma's restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Zingaro's truck and wallet are missing. He was seen in bed on
Wednesday morning, when his roommate, Scott Alderson, came home from
school. Zingaro called work, telling his supervisor that he'd be late
because he had to attend an orientation on campus. When he didn't
come home the following day, Alderson called Zingaro's parents, who
called police.</TE>
<TE>   Alex is 5-feet 11-inches and about 180 pounds, with brown hair
with blond tips and blue-green eyes. He was driving a 1989 blue Mazda
pickup with a camper shell, license plate 5U57091. Anyone with
information is asked to call the Carlsbad Police Department at (760)
931-2197.</TE>

<HD>At 9/11 Plus a Year, Let's Compare With U.S. of Pearl
Harbor Plus One</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patt Morrison</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twelve months ago, we wrung the thesaurus dry to put words to the
unspeakable. We worked our way through "grief, horror, devastation,
tragedy," to two words that worked: Pearl Harbor.</LD>
<LD>   A nation that dodges history lessons had to reach back 60 years to
find something to hang its pain on, to bookend Sept. 11 with a fellow
nightmare, "Not since Pearl Harbor.... "</LD>
<LD>   It's 12 months later; does the comparison still hold? Through
tomorrow's hundreds of hours of radio and TV rehash, through the
candlelight vigils and memorial speeches, are we still a nation in
sync with the America of Pearl Harbor plus one?</LD>
<TE>   Then, as now, we were at war, but of an altogether different
order. Pearl Harbor anniversary observances had less to do with warm
and fuzzy and cathartic ceremonies that might work for the 6 o'clock
news than they did with the urgency of the war at hand. In December
1942, radios broadcast the brief anniversary events live onto the
assembly floors of aircraft plants; aircraft workers who hadn't had a
day off in a year stopped for the moment of silence at 7:55 a.m.
Hawaii time, the time the first Japanese bomb fell.</TE>
<TE>   There are places in this country entitled to any measure of grief
tomorrow: in New York, Washington, a rumpled piece of landscape in
Somerset County, Pennsylvania, in several thousand homes and offices
and churches where beds and chairs and pews are still empty.</TE>
<TE>   For the rest of us, we will immerse ourselves in the national
bathos of candles and flags because, unlike Pearl Harbor plus one, we
have so little to focus on anywhere else. Only a diffuse war against
an elusive enemy, and the prospect of another war against a new
enemy. The best advice I've heard from the Bush White House has come
out of the East Wing, from Laura Bush: If you have kids, turn off the
TV.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I rolled through the microfilmed pages of the L.A.Times from
December 1942, looking for parallels between America then and America
tomorrow. Then, as now, Americans had endured a year of brutal,
front-page geography lessons: Bataan, Corregidor, the Coral Sea ...
Kabul, Kandahar, Mazar-I-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Pearl Harbor plus one was about "confidence and
resolution." After the moment of silence, and taps, a mock-up village
across from City Hall--complete with picket fences, flower beds,
clotheslines and a fake hotel--was bombed so that emergency workers
could show off their home-front skills.</TE>
<TE>   On Olvera Street, you could pay 10 cents for a candle, proceeds to
buy war bonds, and join a commemorative procession. An "all-soldier
colored chorus" sang in Pershing Square, where a captured Japanese
sub on exhibition sent the one-year war bond sales total for Pershing
Square alone over the $3 million mark.</TE>
<TE>   Today's businesses despair over advertising on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   For the Pearl Harbor anniversary, Bullock's department store ran a
poem, "Pearl Harbor Speaks," in the voice of a dead sailor, reading
in part, "I died in vain if sons of my young son must walk the tragic
path that I have trod." In some ads, Uncle Sam and Santa appeared
side by side.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury Department took out a full-page ad congratulating the
hundreds of companies whose employees had made 10% payroll deductions
to buy war bonds: a Santa Paula bank, a Banning grocery, a San Luis
Obispo liquor store, an Anaheim tractor company.</TE>
<TE>   Phrases from then sound uneasily like now. A columnist wrote that
the enemy "figured [Uncle Sam's] children were too soft, too rich,
too comfortable, too peaceful and too divided to ever get together
and put [Uncle Sam] back on his feet and in fighting trim," which
sounds much like the contemptuous language some terrorists have used,
which begs the questions: Are we? Is the comparison even fair?</TE>
<TE>   The papers of December 1942 were full of news about rationing.
Pencil production was cut; there was no rubber for erasers. By
Christmas 1942 there would be no more chocolate to spare for Santa
Clauses or Easter bunnies. The county clerk began using shoelaces
instead of precious metal clips to tie up official documents.
Schoolchildren learned how to hide under a table in case of attack.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, America today feels distant, untouched. Nobody's
been drafted. No sacrifices have been asked. The airport's a hassle,
but so what? Enron and that ilk, far from acting patriotically, have
been exposed as greedy fraudsters; in 1942 they'd have been called
profiteers.</TE>
<TE>   A Gallup poll from December 1942 found that most Americans
supported a war sales tax. What we hear out of Washington now is more
tax-cut talk.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1942, comic strip character Dixie Dugan fumed about
speeders using too much gas--and put rocks in the street to make cars
slow down. Today, nobody's turning in their SUVs to strike a blow
against the oil-igarchs. Ford is shutting down its electric car
project altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 plus one. It's come much too soon for us, and, if we're
fortunate, not too late.</TE>

<HD>Witness Places Defendant at Slaying Scene</HD>
<DH>Trial: Woman says she saw Ramiro Salgado run from Ventura
courtyard where William Zara was beaten to death in 1999.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A prosecution witness told jurors Monday that she saw Ramiro Salgado
running from the scene of a Ventura gang slaying two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Mary Pratt is the first witness in Salgado's murder trial to place
him in the west Ventura neighborhood where 18-year-old William Zara
was fatally beaten the night of Sept. 25, 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Pratt came forward with the information late last week after being
called to testify about people who attended a party that preceded the
beating.</LD>
<TE>   After stepping down from the stand last week, Pratt asked a
district attorney investigator why no one had questioned her about
seeing Salgado running from the courtyard area where Zara was killed.</TE>
<TE>   The investigator interviewed Pratt in a courthouse anteroom and
relayed the information to Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Maeve Fox, who
told the judge and Salgado's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Fox again called Pratt to the stand. She testified that
Salgado, 23, who lived down the street from Zara in Ventura, attended
the party at her aunt's house on the night of the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, Pratt said, she heard a commotion, went outside and
saw people running from the courtyard across the street. Salgado was
among them.</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination, defense attorney Richard Loftus challenged
Pratt's story and questioned her motives for coming forward.</TE>
<TE>   Pratt said she never told police she saw Salgado in the street or
mentioned seeing him when questioned before a grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   "But I've had years to remember," she testified Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In response to a question from Loftus, Pratt also said that her
brother, Chris Gonzales, had been indicted on murder charges for
participating in Zara's slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales was later granted immunity from prosecution after
providing information about Salgado's alleged role in the killing.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado allegedly kicked and hit Zara as he tried to shield
himself from assailants who mistakenly suspected him of reporting
their loud party to police. Zara died after being bludgeoned with a
shovel and a bat.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado is the fifth and final defendant to stand trial in the
slaying. Four others were convicted of murder last year and are
serving sentences of life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   This is Salgado's second murder trial in the case. A jury
deadlocked over a disputed confession and prosecutors decided to
retry the case. Pratt was not called as a witness during the first
trial.</TE>
<TE>   The defense opened its case Monday in Ventura County Superior
Court by again attacking the confession. Salgado told a detective
during an August 2000 interview that he had kicked Zara but recanted
when police said they were going to arrest him on suspicion of
murder.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, UC Berkeley sociology professor Richard Ofshe, who has
researched police interrogation tactics, testified that the
investigators who interviewed Salgado used psychologically coercive
methods to obtain a false confession.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The police union says it will fight Mayor Alan Autry's plan to hire
an independent auditor to investigate officer-related shootings and
complaints from the public.</LD>
<LD>   "The proposal is being perceived by our membership as one more
person looking over an officer's shoulder," said Sgt. Mike Oliver of
the Fresno Police Officers Assn. "The fact is we do a terrific job of
policing ourselves."</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Autry announced his plan two days after an officer shot
and killed Lydia "Tammy" Rodriguez, 32, at a car dealership.
Witnesses said Rodriguez had been waving a hatchet at the officer.</LD>
<TE>   It was the second fatal shooting by a Fresno officer in 16 days
and the eighth in 14 months.</TE>

<LD>A 26-year-old UC Davis graduate student died this weekend, several
days after an alcohol-related drowning accident, Yolo County
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Steven D. Cannata died Saturday of complications from a swimming
accident, said Mary Koompin-Williams, Yolo County supervising deputy
coroner.</LD>
<LD>   Cannata and some friends had been drinking earlier in the day,
then played a game in a hot tub "of who could hold their breath
longer," Koompin-Williams said. Cannata then got into the swimming
pool at the Davis apartment complex.</LD>
<TE>   "They thought at first he was still playing the game but then
realized he was under too long," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Cannata, originally from San Marino, was in his third year of a
four-year joint graduate program to earn a law degree and a master's
degree in business administration.</TE>

<LD>The Winchester Canyon Gun Club is in a clash with the Chumash Indians
over its Los Padres National Forest shooting range.</LD>
<LD>   Some members of the tribe don't want the gun club permit renewed,
saying the ridgeline shooting range site is adjacent to prehistoric
rock art that the tribe holds sacred.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Forest Service is weighing whether to renew the gun
club's permit for another 10 years. The club also wants to reopen a
long-distance rifle range, to fire across the Chumash rock art site
one day per month.</LD>
