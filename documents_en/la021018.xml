<DH>Does Tom Leykis hate women, or does he merely love ratings?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Baker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I: Is he really saying that?</LD>
<LD>   You don't usually get congratulated on Tom Leykis' syndicated
radio show unless you're, say, a caller describing the way you talked
your unexpectedly pregnant girlfriend into having an abortion -- and
then dumped her. Or unless you're a woman with a lascivious tale to
share, like the law clerk who boasts about tripling her pay by
engaging in masochistic sex with the partner of another firm. But on
this Thursday, in the first seconds of his afternoon program, Leykis
sounds so delighted he can scarcely wait for the heavy-metal bumper
music to fade.</LD>
<LD>   Praise be, he tells us in a stern, husky voice, for the Washington
state Supreme Court, which hours before overturned the conviction of
two men who secretly took pictures up women's skirts in shopping
malls. The justices regretfully concluded that the state's
anti-voyeurism law did not apply to acts in public places.</LD>
<TE>   Success in talk radio requires the ability to glean insights from
small events, and Leykis immediately offers this pair: First, we
don't need laws like that. Second, ladies, if you're worried about
protecting yourselves from other camera-toting creeps: "Buy some ...
panties and put them on, you sluts!" And we're off and running with
the commanding general in radio's war for the male demographic. It is
an angry, lurid battle in which social critics of all stripes can
find moments of fulfillment or hopelessness. Spend a few days
listening to Tom Leykis, heard in L.A. from 3 to 8 p.m. on KLSX-FM
(97.1), and you may conclude that society has tilted in a manner
resembling "Planet of the Apes": that women have assumed the upper
hand, forcing men to fight back grimly and mercilessly or perish. Or
you may conclude that, in the interest of ratings, we are all getting
our chains jerked by a host who laughs at us behind our backs.</TE>
<TE>   In the control room of Westwood One's Culver City studio, Leykis'
screener, Dino De Milio, is interrogating callers with the impatience
of an air traffic controller and the lasciviousness of a strip club
owner. ("How old are you, sweetie?" he asks a female caller. "That's
my favorite age for sex!") Through a glass panel, De Milio can see
Leykis, a gnomish 46-year-old man, standing in front of his mike,
wearing shades despite the near darkness, pounding on his opening
theme. " You know what's great?" Leykis asks sarcastically. "Women
want the right to be exhibitionists, but if anybody looks...." "</TE>
<TE>   Tom Leykis broadcasts from the intersection of Libertarian and
Libertine. It's a simple neighborhood with a simple philosophy that
has occurred in the gut of just about every American man and, in some
cases, made its way to his brain. The show is based on the premise
that too many guys have been raised to be wimps in this feminist
culture, that women are taking advantage of these men and that women
are secretly wishing guys would reassert themselves. Leykis plays the
hard-bitten, gender-wars-scarred uncle, hectoring the besieged male
recruits: Don't get them pregnant! Don't marry them! Don't date
single mothers! Yet no matter how insistent or cranky he gets, the
phone lines remained jammed with confessions of weakness and poor
judgment:</TE>
<TE>   "You are my religion, Professor," comes the call another day, "but
I have to tell you I'm one of those guys who knocked a girl up...."</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of birth control were you using?" Leykis demands.</TE>
<TE>   "She said she was on the pill...."</TE>
<TE>   "And you believed her. I hope the boys out there are listening!
This is the kind of stuff I warn you about!"</TE>
<TE>   Men who in more reasonable times would have been considered normal
single guys employing normal trial-and-error approaches to casual sex
become, in the Leykis format, political prisoners, victims of a
stacked deck in which calculating women get their way at men's
expense.</TE>
<TE>   Leykis tries to break this momentum by offering more clinical
tips: No coffee dates or lunch dates -- they lead nowhere.
"Successfully getting a woman into the sack involves some sort of
chemical inducement," he is fond of proclaiming on a "Leykis 101"
segment he does each Thursday. "Alcohol is the preferred chemical
inducement."</TE>
<TE>   Nor should men waste money on dinner dates, he advises; women will
eat and run. Meet them after dinner for a drink. If you are roped
into dinner, eat a full meal at home and order a salad in the
restaurant ("because what woman would eat more than you?").</TE>
<TE>   Once Leykis' listeners have scored, "we do not cuddle, we do not
spoon, we do not hug, we do not stay late," Leykis instructs. "We do
not convince women we are in love with them. We do not say I love you
-- ever, ever, ever. Unless we do." He pronounces that last word with
grave disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   Leykis -- married four times, thrice-divorced and separated from
wife No. 4 for the last two years -- is honest enough to describe the
show as an act that evolved into a point of view. And he occasionally
makes serious feminist-backlash arguments on issues like parental
leave, divorce or alimony that create a social edge. He'll say
proudly, in the name of personal responsibility, that he has no
children, and that each of the four unplanned pregnancies he caused
was terminated.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the fact that so many of his frustrated male callers take him
so literally gives the program a uniquely bitter, even mean, tone
that makes it both appealing and appalling. The show has little of
the self-deprecating comedic relief of Howard Stern's equally
explicit KLSX morning show, the gold standard of sleaze-talk radio.
Stern's shtick is sexual bantering and the embarrassed giggle;
Leykis' shtick is sexual politics and the evil, got-even-with-her
snicker. In the same way Rush Limbaugh demonizes liberals, Leykis
lays men's woes at the feet of "chicks" or "broads" (or, more
frequently, another B-word) -- and of men's failure to control them.</TE>
<TE>   Hour No. 2 of today's show is devoted to mocking the notion of
female independence as a feminist invention (which will draw many
angry female callers). Leykis is trying to explain that men are
simply more driven to succeed than women, driven by the need for ...
chicks.</TE>
<TE>   "We make money to get chicks," he says, his sentences almost
swallowing each other. "Those of us who are really ambitious want
more chicks. Better chicks. Hotter chicks. A larger number of chicks.
We work hard to get chicks. When I was 14, I got into radio because
when I was in high school, I was a geek. Once I was at the radio
station answering the request line, chicks would call in, ask me to
play a song, and then they'd ask me to come over after the show. 'I
love your voice. Come on over.' And I would. And then I realized if I
got better radio gigs in bigger cities, I'd get better chicks, hotter
chicks. And I did. And the more money I make, the better chicks I
get." (Leykis' most recent "chick" is a 27-year-old Argentine,
recently arrived in the U.S., whom he met at the station; she moved
into his Hollywood Hills home two months ago.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   II: Am I really listening to this?</TE>
<TE>   Confession: I have listened to this show for years and it bothers
me because -- well, it's just not me, a stable, married guy with a
teenage daughter. The last time I used the word "chick" was 1973: A
female colleague and I wrote essays for our small newspaper on our
competing favorites in the nationally televised Billie Jean
King-Bobby Riggs battle of the sexes. It was a tennis match -- a
stunt -- that carried a level of gender tension impossible to imagine
today. I defiantly used "chick" in my pro-Riggs essay because, as
Frank Sinatra-passe as it sounded even then, I knew it infuriated my
colleague, and it felt good to strike back at the upstart feminist
movement, to grind it under my heel.</TE>
<TE>   But I was young and stupid. If you'd told me that half a lifetime
later, I'd be listening to a 40-something guy on the radio using the
word "chick" for essentially the same denigrating purpose -- and
claiming to make a seven-figure income off it -- I would have rolled
my eyes. It's so juvenile. Which is why I'm perplexed/fascinated that
the grown-up me is helping to make Leykis the Arbitron-certified king
of the male listener in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Why did I laugh so hard the other day when he spent an hour on how
men should give women backhanded compliments ("Honey, you're so
pretty I don't even notice the extra weight") to keep their
self-esteem low and their behavior compliant? Were darker forces
drawing me to the show? I decided to confer with experts.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, one of them got me thinking, I'm enticed by the sly way
Leykis performs the kind of sexual harassment that government and
workplace rules no longer allow. "Men say, 'It's not OK to [harass
women] at work, but thank God I can turn on my radio ... while I'm
hammering a nail," suggests Ann Simonton, a former fashion model from
Northern California who started a media-literacy program two decades
ago after she was raped at knifepoint and began thinking about the
way the media portray women. Leykis' popularity, Simonton says, is
sad proof "that we live in a sexually repressed culture where sex is
only for sale, talked about only as a taboo, rather than there being
a healthy dialogue on sexual intimacy."</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe I listen because I enjoy reverting to the cartoonishly
adolescent state that men are assigned in the popular culture. Janet
McMullen, an associate professor in the University of North Alabama's
communications department who specializes in media ethics, notes that
Hollywood responded to feminism by constructing legitimate roles for
women but in the process made men the targets of ridicule. "You look
at TV sitcoms and dramas, you listen to the educational community:
It's as though guys are broken in some way," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe, more nobly, I listen because Leykis' dialogue fills a
vacuum in so many men's lives -- the lack of intimate conversation
with other men. "There's no place we can go for support," says Warren
Farrell, a San Diego psychologist whose books include "Women Can't
Hear What Men Don't Say."</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe I listen because Leykis touches a powerful nerve when he
tells men to stop being "nice" -- to stand up and demand what we want
(including that 60-inch TV). He "has tapped into something that's
very prominent," says Robert Glover, a Seattle psychotherapist who
wrote "No More Mr. Nice Guy" in an attempt to tell men that women are
turned off by guys who are too timid to be candid about their sexual
desires. Men who act this way ultimately wind up frustrated and
angry, Glover says.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe I listen simply because I love a spectacle -- the guys
begging for Leykis' wisdom, the women calling to alternately scream
at him or ask him to autograph their breasts at an upcoming listener
party. Maybe there're no more cultural implications here than on
Ricki Lake. Maybe, as screener Di Milio puts it, "some people make
the mistake of forgetting the very last word; it's 'The Tom Leykis
Show.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   III: Oh, I get it -- I think</TE>
<TE>   Leykis has a restless intellect that makes it hard for him to stay
in character. Over lunch (let him pick the wine, he has a 700-bottle
cellar in his house), he can make a convincing defense for the cruel
way men often talk about women on the show. Why, he demands, should
he be forced to sprinkle a phony veneer of politeness on our angry
culture? Why shouldn't he express his gender's most visceral
feelings?</TE>
<TE>   But a half hour later, he can be just as convincing making the
case that the economics of radio demand offensive styles and stunts.
Government deregulation of radio sent station prices soaring and
meant owners had "to get results to-day. The way you get results
to-day is [to say on the air]: 'Hello, my penis is hanging out, and I
don't know what to do about it, and if somebody could come down to
the station, if there's a policeman within the sound of my voice....'
Then you get the cops down there and it becomes a story in the paper
'cause the papers all fall for it and give you the free advertising
-- boom; that's how things are done now."</TE>
<TE>   The object of talk radio is not to change minds; it is to stay on
the air. You invent or copy a format and, if it works, you ride it
until you fall off the horse. For all his male listeners' deference
to "The Professor," Tom Leykis is first and foremost a radio guy
obsessed with the art of drawing and holding a crowd, a guy whose
success in a turbulent market is a testament to his wits and love of
craft, says L.A. radio historian Don Barrett. "Tom knows everything
about every radio station in this country.... This guy just bleeds
radio."</TE>
<TE>   His five-year stint on KLSX is his third in L.A. He was first on
KFI between 1988 and 1992 as a more conventional liberal talk-show
counterpoint to Limbaugh. (After a dispute whose nature he won't
discuss, he was replaced by ex-Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates.)
He worked fill-in shifts in several cities before landing an AM
syndication deal in '94 that brought him back to L.A. When KLSX
offered him an afternoon show in 1997, he said, it meant creating a
style that would be close to Stern's young-man, breast-obsessed
demographic without appearing to copy him.</TE>
<TE>   "So we had to evolve the show in this new direction," he said
matter-of-factly, "which was grinding loud music, grinding
production, and we stepped up the rudeness factor."</TE>
<TE>   He's now in about 50 markets, including Seattle, San Francisco and
Dallas, with a national base several times less than icons like
Limbaugh, Laura Schlessinger and Stern. He has the largest afternoon
male audience on L.A. radio in every age range except his target
demographic -- 18 to 44 -- where he trails rock and hip-hop stations
KPWR and KROQ, according to the latest Arbitron ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Leykis boasts of other survey data that reflect an affluent
audience and high-end advertisers. When you point out that his
predominantly male callers sound far less successful or confident, he
reminds you not to confuse the callers (who are his foils) with his
listeners (who make him rich). "Anybody who takes this show really
seriously doesn't get it. The callers are 1% of the audience....
People who make a good living and have high intelligence usually
don't have 45 minutes to stay on hold."</TE>
<TE>   Ask Leykis if sexual politics is as intellectually satisfying as a
show that covers more ground, and he suggests you've asked the wrong
question. "I never forget I'm in this business to make money. I never
had ratings this high. I never made as much money as I do. If I wanna
talk politics, I'll go to a park." Evil snicker. "I'll call up Warren
Olney one day."</TE>
<TE>   Ask how he got on the air at 14 and he tells about being a gifted,
bored child who was reading the New York Times in the first grade.
About being a ninth-grader living in an isolated Long Island suburb,
missing the bustling Bronx neighborhood where he'd grown up, sitting
on the stoop with a portable radio, wishing he could jump inside.
About winning a contest to be a DJ for an hour on the local radio
station, then being asked back.</TE>
<TE>   He tells about hosting a cable-TV public-access-station game show
at 16, about trying to get on the air as a student at Fordham
University but failing and dropping out after a year and half.</TE>
<TE>   About working a series of day jobs, the most pitiful being
telemarketing. About getting hired at a variety of low-paying jobs at
small radio stations in places like Albany, N.Y., and Stanton, Va.,
and Miami, spinning records and engaging in chatter and groping for
gimmicks to get noticed. About recognizing he'd embarked on a nomadic
career that would subvert marriage or stable relationships.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers inventing a male chauvinist character in 1979 who
called in, voicing many opinions that riled listeners -- opinions
that a DJ could voice on the air in that gentler time but that were
the first stirrings of Leykis' KLSX voice.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers discovering how the most audacious opinions could
generate buzz. ("I would never serve in the military under any
circumstances. I just missed the draft of the Vietnam War, and if we
had another war I wouldn't go. Let somebody else be cannon fodder.
Now let's go to the phones.")</TE>
<TE>   You had to take that extra step. "It wasn't enough to have lesbian
nuns on the show. You had to have them on Good Friday."</TE>
<TE>   He says he never thought he'd have this kind of success or
longevity in L.A. And it sounds positively heartwarming until he
mentions why he won't be going to his 30th high school reunion, even
though he'd figure to be a magnet for all the, uh, chicks who turned
him down when he was a geek.</TE>
<TE>   "I said this on the air: 'I wouldn't touch any of you women with a
10-foot pole,' " he says, " 'And you know why? Because I can now
afford your daughters.' " Evil snicker.</TE>

<TE>   The role of women in society, according to the freewheeling Tom
Leykis</TE>
<TE>   Leykis on gender:</TE>
<TE>   I am tired of being with women trying to prove they're smarter
than I am, telling me to make my own dinner, to do it myself, women
so concerned about appearing independent that they have to have
careers. I don't want to be confused anymore when I go home about
what my job is.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leykis on when to marry:</TE>
<TE>   Never marry somebody you knocked up unless you know you're gonna
be with them forever and you really love them and you really love
that kid and you really want to be there. But if you can't answer
"yes" to all those, don't marry these broads.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leykis on prolonged adolescence:</TE>
<TE>   I want my childhood to last as long as it can.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leykis on how marriage changes a relationship:</TE>
<TE>   She'll do whatever you want until she gets you to sign on the
dotted line and suddenly it's like, "I don't like having sex on any
day that ends in 'y.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leykis on what he teaches male listeners:</TE>
<TE>   I am the professor who teaches you how to get sex for the least
amount of money and without having to listen to women go on and on:
"Blah-bla-blah-bla-blah-bla-blah-bla-blah." Broads never shut up.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leykis on his looks:</TE>
<TE>   If I were really attractive, I would be on TV making real
money.... I wouldn't be doing some dopey radio show.</TE>

<HD>Theaters pull plug on 'Enduring Freedom'</HD>
<DH>Regal denies it was motivated by complaints about the
military documentary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Calvo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To the chagrin of its producers, Regal Cinemas has abruptly pulled
"Enduring Freedom: The Opening Chapter," a movie trailer by the U.S.
Marines and Navy that had played on hundreds of screens since
mid-September.</LD>
<LD>   Initially, the company said it was planning a gradual national
rollout for the short film. The decision to stop running the
4-minute, 48-second piece came Tuesday, the same day The Times
published a story on the unusual $1.2-million project and viewer
reaction to it.</LD>
<LD>   Executives said they were not acting in response to complaints
that it had overtones of propaganda or that it had exposed children
to a disturbing image from Sept. 11, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   "It's run its course," said Kurt Hall, chief executive of Regal
CineMedia, a subsidiary of Regal Entertainment Group, which owns
Regal Cinemas. Hall said it was yanked from theaters in Los Angeles,
Denver, New York and Knoxville, Tenn., because the company had
completed limited testing of new digital technology that enables
Regal to download advertisements and trailers from a satellite,
rather than relying on a traditional reel.</TE>
<TE>   It has not ruled out the possibility of replaying the trailer in
January, after the glut of holiday movies,with its consequent fierce
competition to place film trailers before audiences, has subsided.</TE>
<TE>   In Tuesday's story, The Times quoted one mother concerned that her
children had to see a passenger jet crashing into the World Trade
Center before a showing of the G-rated "Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie."</TE>
<TE>   Others said they saw inappropriate political commentary in the
trailer.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a single thing in there about Iraq, other than 'This
is what the military is about,' " said Eric Vesbit, a 31-year-old
recording engineer in Philadelphia who saw the trailer online and
sent an outraged e-mail to Regal, the nation's largest movie
exhibitors. "But the difference is that the Bush administration is
gearing toward a war that I firmly disagree with. Therefore, I do
view it as propaganda and not just advertising. This is kind of a
tame version, a non-Iraq version, which is just getting us used to
the idea that the military is going to be putting these sorts of
films in front of our eyes."</TE>
<TE>   "Enduring Freedom" is not a recruiting commercial but a look at
the work of the 80,000 soldiers and sailors who have been deployed
around the world since the terrorist attacks on New York and the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Even though it was played for general audiences, the trailer was
not rated by the Motion Picture Assn. of America because it was
categorized as a documentary.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. James Kuhn, who created the trailer, said the military
was simply attempting to make moviegoers aware of the sacrifices the
armed forces make.</TE>
<TE>   "All those young Marines and sailors are willing to put their
lives on the line to have a country where we can have this kind of
dialogue -- people disagreeing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For Lance O'Connor, owner of American Rogue Films, which made and
produced the film, Regal's decision was disappointing. He spent
months gaining unprecedented access to military operations and
several months whittling down 250 hours of film. On Thursday morning,
when Kuhn told him Regal had pulled "Enduring Freedom," he was
furious.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone's creating trouble by saying we're creating rah-rah
propaganda reaching 5-year-olds, and the Pentagon doesn't confront
trouble," O'Connor said.</TE>
<TE>   "But because of the 5% of the population who says they saw it with
their kids and were offended, or that it's propaganda, they're
ruining it for everyone," he added.</TE>
<TE>   When pressed about complaints circulating on e-mail and phone
lines, Hall said the cinematic project attracted far more positive
comments than negative ones.</TE>
<TE>   "The Marine Corps was trying to get this qualified for an Academy
Award," Hall said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very good piece of filmmaking, and as with any piece of
filmmaking, there are people who are going to like it and people who
are not going to like it."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Regal and the military conducted surveys of
theatergoers who saw the trailer, and they say the data will be
available next week. They expect to be able to show there was broad
support for the project.</TE>

<HD>Bob Crane as a prisoner of warp</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Auto Focus," the strangely wonderful and weirdly touching new
film from Paul Schrader, the comedy and the tragedy keep getting
mixed up. The film is based on the rise and lurid fall of the late
Bob Crane (Greg Kinnear), the television actor whose great claim to
fame was lobbing jokes at the world's dumbest Nazis in the 1960s
sitcom "Hogan's Heroes."</LD>
<LD>   By all accounts Crane was as bland and unmemorable as the
character that made him famous, save for the fact that like Hogan he
was also a captive of sorts. Instead of a POW camp, Crane was locked
inside his addictions -- to sex, to video technology, to fame.</LD>
<LD>   Like a lot of Americans, he was hooked on celebrity, the
difference being that the famous face that made him smile the most
was his own.</LD>
<TE>   Crane isn't an obvious subject for Schrader; his specialty is men
whose terminal aloneness inevitably leads them into crisis. He's a
genius of male panic -- in scripts such as "Taxi Driver" and films
such as "Affliction" -- brilliant at creating characters who, in the
words of critic Kent Jones, "exist in a state of spiritual
emergency." But instead of popping pills or slitting their wrists,
Schrader's lonely men lash out at the world, unburdening their anomie
with a vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   If Crane hadn't been bludgeoned to death in 1978 it's doubtful
that Schrader, who likes his antiheroes more macho, would have looked
in this lightweight's direction.</TE>
<TE>   The violence in Crane's life, at least in the beginning, was
self-inflicted. A onetime symphonic drummer, he was an untrained
actor who parlayed his twinkling affability and Ken-doll looks into
all-American celebrity. "Auto Focus" opens in the mid-1960s, when
Crane was working as a disc jockey for a morning drive-time show at
the Los Angeles radio station KNX. Happily married with three young
children, Crane wanted more. Standing in the office of his agent (a
splendid Ron Leibman), and holding a pair of drumsticks, he beats out
a complaint that his career is going nowhere. The agent tenderly pats
a script on his desk and coos, "I've got something of interest for
you," laying out the premise for a comedy set in a World War II
prison camp. "Oh," says Crane, "with the funny Nazis."</TE>
<TE>   The sarcasm didn't last. Crane may have wanted better material,
but he also wanted to be famous: "I can be Jack Lemmon," he wails to
his agent. The problem, as both the film and Kinnear's terrific
performance suggest, is that Crane couldn't even be himself, mostly
because there wasn't much there to begin with.</TE>
<TE>   In Robert Graysmith's true-crime "The Murder of Bob Crane," a book
as literal as its title, and which provides the skeletal framework
for Michael Gerbosi's screenplay, the actor appears at once
hard-working and unfocused, almost blurry. Outside of a vague sense
of entitlement to the spotlight, he didn't seem driven by anything
specific, certainly not a muse or creative itch.</TE>
<TE>   Schrader has his own ideas on what made Crane run, and it's the
filmmaker's sharp, at times startlingly funny read on the actor as
both a figure of absurdity and tragedy that lifts "Auto Focus" out of
the gutter of tabloid biography. You expect ideas from Schrader,
who's certainly had more ups as a writer than as a director, but what
makes "Auto Focus" so pleasurable is the absolute ease of the
filmmaking. His last feature, "Forever Mine," was a dud (the film
didn't receive a theatrical release) but there isn't a scene in "Auto
Focus" that doesn't feel right, however light or dark. Working with
cinematographer Fred Murphy, the filmmaker makes the most of Crane's
early life, with its Populuxe interiors and martini-glass sparkle, as
much as the latter part, when the color starts to smear and to bleed,
as if in anticipation of the gruesome denouement.</TE>
<TE>   Schrader keeps the film from getting bogged down in his ideas by
keeping the tone balanced on the razor's edge of satire. He isn't the
sort of artist who could be accused of having a light touch, but in
"Auto Focus" he's continually mixing the comedy in with the tragedy,
playing with mood the way he plays with set design, costume and the
performances. (The re-creations of "Hogan's Heroes" are a blast,
epitomized by Kurt Fuller's pitch-perfect riff on Werner Klemperer
a.k.a. Col. Klink's trilling of his antagonist's name -- "Hooo-gan!")
Kinnear is indispensable to the film's quicksilver changes. The
performance is an amazing conjuring trick, not only technically but
because Crane fundamentally comes across as a cipher. (For the
record, some of Crane's family object to this portrayal.)</TE>
<TE>   In "Auto Focus" Crane always seems on the verge of disintegrating.
Soon after he begins working on "Hogan's Heroes," he meets the man
who would play a crucial part in his decline, a video tech salesman
named John Carpenter (no relation to the movie director, and played
by Willem Dafoe). Then a sales representative for Sony, Carpenter
helped seed interest in the company by selling video-equipment
prototypes to famous Americans such as Elvis and President Johnson.
Crane's co-star, Richard Dawson, was one of his clients, and it was
the British actor who introduced Carpenter to Crane. It was, at least
on Carpenter's end, obsession at first sight. Carpenter began
furnishing Crane with the very latest video equipment, which the
actor embraced with the fervor of a convert.</TE>
<TE>   Hungrily hanging on Crane's every word and gesture, Carpenter was
at once every agent, publicist and Hollywood yes-man rolled into one
cadaverous smile, existing only in relation to the actor's approval.
The casting is inspired. Dafoe is routinely cast in the role of
villain, but he has an innate vulnerability that too often goes
untapped. There's heartbreaking neediness etched in his face, with
its skin stretched so tight you can see the bones underneath, which
works in sublime contrast to Kinnear's impassivity.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after he got his first camera in "Auto Focus," Crane, a
devotee of what his first wife (Rita Wilson) disgustedly calls "shady
magazines," started frequenting strip clubs, where he sometimes sat
in with the band. Already bored with his family scene, he began
pointing his sights at other women, often in the company of
Carpenter. A hobby burgeoned into a lifestyle, then a mania. The pair
trolled for women, bringing them back to the technician's bachelor
pad, where they videotaped them every which way. Crane's family
eventually dropped from view and "Hogan's Heroes" was canceled. The
years bombed by -- the women unzip miniskirts, then midis -- but the
tapes kept rolling, all the way until the night somebody smashed
Crane's skull in with a tripod.</TE>
<TE>   As in Graysmith's book, the implication in the film is that it was
Carpenter who probably killed Crane; Schrader isn't really
interested. What gets him going is how Crane's desire for fame
dovetailed with his addiction to videotape and how our culture of
celebrity can quickly become a cult. Crane floundered after "Hogan's
Heroes," in time hitting the dinner-club circuit. By then he had left
his first wife and married one of his sitcom co-stars, Patti Olsen
a.k.a. Sigrid Valdis (Maria Bello), with whom he had another son.
Throughout it all he had his ups and downs with Carpenter, which
manifested itself in some hilarious sexual anxiety (at one point,
while watching one of their group sex videotapes, Crane is outraged
to see where his friend's hand has strayed). The men fought,
separated, but couldn't live without each other. Carpenter may have
been Crane's pusher, but he was also an addict, hooked on Crane and
his fame.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Crane's celebrity waned, Carpenter stayed. The dynamic
between the men, at least as Schrader would have it, was one of
mutual destruction. (Carpenter started out as Mephistopheles to
Crane's Faust, but by the end the roles seemed reversed.) Meanwhile,
even as his friend nibbled at him, the actor ate at himself. He was
addicted to sex but somehow along the way that obsession got mixed up
with his addiction to Bob Crane; he kept albums filled with nudie
photographs, trophies and evidence of the women with whom he'd slept,
maybe even proof he was alive. Surrounded by a cast of thousands, the
permanent star of a production that would only end with his death, he
was a cathode-ray Narcissus who spent hours, then finally days, in
front of a television monitor getting lost in his own image. He
videotaped, therefore he was -- then somebody cut the juice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPPA rating, R for strong sexuality, nudity, language, some drug
use and violence. Times guidelines: quite a bit of nudity, some
blurry scenes of group sex, one scene of graphic violence.</TE>

<LD>"We don't like to be touched"</LD>
<LD>   -- Sharona Fleming</LD>
<LD>   speaking for her obsessive-compulsive boss, Adrian Monk.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Americans are hearing continually about terror in the Washington,
D.C., area. And as always in such matters, TV news is wildly and
irresponsibly on the loose, too, providing a turnstile for
speculating heads who spew rumors unchecked.</TE>
<TE>   This would not be happening had the nation's best detective
attended to this from the start. No time for major fright or media
frenzy when a murder case is solved in 45 minutes, plus commercials,
by Adrian Monk.</TE>
<TE>   The hero of "Monk" -- which is ending a delectable first season on
cable's USA Network tonight while rerunning Thursdays on ABC in
advance of the delayed new "Dinotopia" -- would wrap up the mystery
pronto. His powers of observation and detection are that stunning.</TE>
<TE>   Monk: "You and your wife are having problems, sir?"</TE>
<TE>   Startled suspect: "Why would you say that?"</TE>
<TE>   Monk: "You're not sleeping in the same room. There's a travel
alarm on the end table and some slippers under the couch."</TE>
<TE>   Eat your heart out, Sherlock.</TE>
<TE>   Monk is hardly wrinkle-free as an occasional consultant nailing
murderers who stump his ex-colleague, Capt. Stottlemeyer, in San
Francisco, where Monk was renowned until losing his cop badge when
messed up emotionally by the slaying of his wife, Trudy.</TE>
<TE>   Played flawlessly by Tony Shalhoub -- famous as the cabby on NBC's
"Wings" before acclaimed roles in such films as "Big Night" and "The
Man Who Wasn't There" -- Monk has this, er, problem that requires a
bit of maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   It's called severe obsessive-compulsive disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Monk longs to get back his badge, but fat chance. Proceeding with
boundless angst, speaking with whispery softness and walking like a
meek trespasser, he is unique in a vast constellation of crime
busters. He is TV's most original sleuth ever (apologies to Morse,
Columbo, Kojak, Poirot, Nero Wolfe, ABC's Andy Sipowicz and FX's
rogue cop, Vic Mackey) by reason of his many phobias.</TE>
<TE>   He is incapable of making even trivial decisions, but carries
neatness and orderliness to exotic extremes.</TE>
<TE>   He shrank from eating recently when seeing no separation between
food items on his plate. When entering a chaotic murder scene in one
episode, his first impulse was to straighten the lamps. In another,
when a ceiling crashed down and knocked him to the floor, he called
for a broom while still dazed and on his stomach.</TE>
<TE>   He fears the dark, requiring a five-watt (no other wattage will
do) night light for sleeping.</TE>
<TE>   He fears heights. "I can assure you ... that this particular
aircraft has an excellent safety record," an airline employee
promises him tonight when circumstances force Monk to fly with his
complaining but devoted and protective nurse-assistant Sharona
Fleming (Bitty Schram).</TE>
<TE>   "Can I see it?" Monk asks.</TE>
<TE>   He fears milk and germs, showering three times a day with a
star-shaped nozzle, sterilizing his toothbrush in boiling water and
storing even his socks in individual plastic bags.</TE>
<TE>   Before boarding tonight (it's his first flight), he asks when the
jet was last disinfected. Strapped into his seat, he wonders aloud,
"How can we be sure we have the best people sitting near the exits?"</TE>
<TE>   He also fears crowds. And physical contact, when someone brazenly
shakes his hand? Crisis city. Out come the moist towelettes that
Sharona stashes in her bag for Monk's bacteria-driven panic attacks.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing laughable about obsessive-compulsive disorder. In
that regard, the roots of Monk's pain, gnarled emotions and fragility
-- underplayed with delicate nuance by Shalhoub -- are addressed with
sensitivity, his haunting fixation on Trudy with tenderness.</TE>
<TE>   His symptoms, and how he loosens their grip just long enough to
nab killers, generate most of the humor.</TE>
<TE>   It helps that Shalhoub is fidgety, neurotic perfection in this
comedy-mystery and that Schram is jolly fun as a gaudy single mother
with attitude. In fact, "Monk" is such a glorious kick and this pair
so grand together that USA has picked up the Andy Breckman-created
series for a second summer season, in 2003, and last week granted its
fans a Sunday-long Monkathon.</TE>
<TE>   The show's average weekly audience of 4.5 million on USA is golden
for basic cable. And though its 6.7 million ABC viewers last week
placed it in the bottom third of prime-time ratings compiled for
broadcast networks by Nielsen Media Research, combining these
audience totals bodes well for character-driven "Monk."</TE>
<TE>   Plots are simplistic, but Monk, in particular, is meticulously
written. His bumbles evoke other famous detectives. Yet differing
from slobby Columbo, whose foibles were a ruse, Monk's personality
tics are real. And unlike French clown Clouseau, who couldn't find a
fly on his nose, Monk is brilliant, his sleuthing instincts
triumphing over his phobias, his face hardening and sad eyes turning
accusatory when it's time to expose guilt.</TE>
<TE>   That happens tonight only after swell nonsense with Shalhoub's
wife, Brooke Adams, as a flight attendant, Garry Marshall as his
seatmate and "Wings" star Tim Daly as himself. Monk tells Sharona he
never saw the show.</TE>
<TE>   Other inspired "Monk" moments:</TE>
<TE>   In "Mr. Monk Meets Dale the Whale," Monk faced his old nemesis, an
800-pound apparent murderer (played with relish by Adam Arkin) who
hadn't seen his toes or left his bed in 11 years. When Dale lifted
his satin sheets to display his epic blubber, Sharona lost her
supper.</TE>
<TE>   In "Mr. Monk and the Psychic," Monk picked lint from the lapel of
a former police commissioner while offering to help investigate his
wife's death. Capt. Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) later found Monk
waiting in his office, and his desk clutter inexplicably absent.
Monk: "I took the liberty of straightening up a little."</TE>
<TE>   In "Mr. Monk Takes a Vacation," Monk soaked up the hot sun in a
business suit and straw hat on a beach before solving a murder with a
hotel detective (the supremely funny Polly Draper) who took her cues
from screen cops such as Dirty Harry.</TE>
<TE>   It made my day.</TE>
<TE>   So watch Monk and love him. Just don't touch him.</TE>

<LD>Miramax's "Gangs of New York," which stars Leonardo DiCaprio, hits
the streets on Dec. 20. That's five days before DreamWorks rolls out
"Catch Me if You Can," another DiCaprio vehicle.</LD>
<LD>   "It was probably not in anyone's best interest to release it on
the same day as 'Catch Me if You Can,' " Miramax chief operating
officer Rick Sands said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Miramax's Dec. 20 release date still enables the film to draw from
the herd of college students who are home for vacation and tend to go
see movies "with immediacy," Sands said.</LD>
<TE>   "Gangs of New York," directed by Martin Scorsese, is Miramax's
largest movie ever, with a budget that ran well over the $100-million
mark, a completion date a year late and star power including Cameron

<HD>Vietnam says actor not jailed; penalty mulled</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vietnamese actor Don Duong, branded a "national traitor" for a role
in a movie about the Vietnam War starring Mel Gibson, has not been
jailed, but authorities were considering how he would be punished, a
spokesman for the Vietnamese government said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "The movie 'We Were Soldiers' did not reflect correctly the truth
of history of the just war by the Vietnamese people, not forming the
image of the soldier of the Vietnamese People's Army," Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Phan Thuy Thanh said in Hanoi.</LD>
<LD>   The movie depicts a 1965 battle in which men from the 7th Air
Cavalry led by Lt. Col. Hal Moore, played by Gibson, triumphed over a
more experienced and much larger North Vietnamese force. Duong played
the role of the senior Vietnamese military officer.</LD>
<TE>   Responding to media reports that Duong has been jailed for his
movie roles, Thanh said, "Actor Don Duong is not arrested, not in
jail or barred from traveling, as reported." A senior official at the
department of cinematography under the Culture and Information
Ministry said authorities were considering what punishment Duong
would get but had made no final decision.</TE>
<TE>   Duong, 45, lives in southern Ho Chi Minh City and could not be
reached for comment.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Viacom Inc. has been sued by a Riverside woman who claims she was
seriously injured during the taping of an MTV "Jackass" show, which
features outrageous stunts.</LD>
<LD>   Wendy Linden was onstage during the "Jackass: Town Hall Meeting"
show at Hollywood High School in April when a cast member hurtled
himself into the lectern where she stood. Linden said the lectern
knocked her over and caused a spinal injury that required surgery.</LD>
<LD>   "Like cigarette manufacturers, MTV and Viacom target young,
impressionable teenage viewers who imitate behaviors seen on
television," according to the suit filed in Los Angeles Superior
Court. Phone calls to Viacom and MTV representatives weren't
immediately returned. The show carries warnings about copying any of
the stunts.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The frightening, ongoing mystery of the Washington-area sniper is
proving a compelling story for cable news networks, which have
attracted their largest audiences of the year.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Fox News Channel averaged 1.12 million viewers, CNN
had 1.06 million and CNN Headline News had 294,000. For each network,
it was the most-watched single day of the year, according to Nielsen
Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   That was the day after the sniper claimed its latest victim,
47-year-old FBI analyst Linda Franklin, outside a Home Depot in Falls
Church, Va. The story dominated the news networks.</LD>
<TE>   For all of the networks, Tuesday's audience was bigger than it was
for the first anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>

<LD>A couple of days before the life and loves of Frida Kahlo appear in
movie palaces, in the Miramax film "Frida" opening next Friday,
Southern California fans of the Mexican painter can peruse a
different account of her private affairs.</LD>
<LD>   Various items from a little-known archive -- including letters and
notes Kahlo wrote to her celebrated artist husband, Diego Rivera, and
the certificate of their second marriage to each other -- will go on
view at Sotheby's Beverly Hills showroom Tuesday and Wednesday, 10
a.m.-5 p.m. An unidentified descendant of Rivera has consigned the
36-document archive to auction. Valued at $200,000 to $300,000, it
will go on the block at Sotheby's New York on Dec. 13.</LD>

<LD>The Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra has suspended concerts for 45 days
after filing a bankruptcy notice in court.</LD>
<LD>   The move is the latest in a series of steps the orchestra has
taken in recent years to try to rid itself of debt that now totals
more than $650,000. Under the bankruptcy filing, a court-appointed
interim official is drawing up a new business plan for the rest of
the season. It includes a smaller orchestra, fewer performances and a

<HD>A day of madness made real in gripping 'Bloody Sunday'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was, as a character says, a moment of truth and a moment of shame.
It was a savage blow delivered 30 years ago that the Northern Irish
city of Derry has yet to put behind it. It caused a national furor so
durable the British government was recently forced to reopen its
investigation into the event. And it has inspired first a classic
song by U2 and now an exceptional film, a compelling, gut-clutching
piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of
emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day.</LD>
<LD>   "Bloody Sunday," which shared the Golden Bear award at the Berlin
Film Festival, shows the power of real events dramatically conveyed.
Made by writer-director Paul Greengrass out of a sense of communal
outrage that has not gone away, this film never wavers, never loses
its focus or its conviction. It takes us from dawn to dusk on Jan.
30, 1972, a day in which British troops opened fire on unarmed civil
rights marchers. Twenty-seven people were hit, at least five shot in
the back; 14 died.</LD>
<TE>   Though he's made some dramatic features, Greengrass is best known
for his 10 years of doing documentaries for a top British TV series.
Starting from the painstaking book ("Eyewitness Bloody Sunday" by Don
Mullan) that led to the reopening of the case and taking Gillo
Pontecorvo's landmark "Battle of Algiers" as a model, Greengrass and
his team (production designer John Paul Kelly, editor Clare Douglas
and director of photography Ivan Stasburg) have re-created the events
of that day with such potency you feel you are there with the
marchers, personally experiencing the awful inevitability of history
gone terribly wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Cinematographer Stasburg deserves special mention for the way his
expressive, jittery hand-held cinema verite camerawork, lurking
around corners and eavesdropping on conversations, creates the
immediacy of newsreel footage. "Bloody Sunday" plays like it's the
work of a documentary crew with great instincts and total access. It
manages the difficult trick of conveying chaos while allowing us to
recognize the patterns in the madness. It's both spontaneous enough
to resemble reality captured on the fly and focused enough to be
intensely dramatic.</TE>
<TE>   "Bloody Sunday's" narrative device retains its potency throughout
the film: Everything is structured around cutting back and forth
between two of Northern Ireland's perennial antagonists, the
beleaguered British Army and the province's restive Catholic
minority.</TE>
<TE>   The Catholics, ironically led by their Protestant member of
Parliament Ivan Cooper (an outstanding James Nesbitt), are holding a
press conference restating their determination, as believers in
peaceful protest in the Martin Luther King tradition, to march the
next day for civil rights and against the British practice of
internment without trial.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time the British Army, personified by the
ultra-confident Maj. Gen. Robert Ford (the impeccable Tim
Piggott-Smith), is holding a press conference of its own, reiterating
that marches are banned and that people "organizing such events are
liable to immediate arrest. Any responsibility for violence must rest
on their shoulders."</TE>
<TE>   Though both sides speak the same King's English, genuine
communication is nonexistent. Fortified by internal logic and vocal
supporters, the army and the Catholics are equally sure they are in
the right, a situation that led to a fatal end.</TE>
<TE>   "Bloody Sunday" focuses on a quartet of protagonists, two on each
side, representing a kind of "Upstairs/Downstairs" look at the day's
events as they unfold. The youngest character is 17-year-old Gerry
Donaghy (Declan Duddy, himself the nephew of a 17-year-old who died
on that day). A Catholic boy just three weeks out of prison for
throwing stones, he needs to stay out of trouble but doesn't want to
miss the excitement The youngest person on the other side is Soldier
027 (Mike Edwards), one of the hated, red beret-wearing British
paratroopers who've been secretly brought into the city to snatch up
the march ringleaders and stamp out stray hooligans. Authentically
played by ex-military men, the Paras perfectly convey the feeling of
cogs in a military machine whose programmed eagerness to get out and
do what they were trained to do proved catastrophic.</TE>
<TE>   The commander of British troops in the city, Brig. Patrick
MacLellan (Nicholas Farrell), also feels hamstrung, caught between
local leaders who want peace and the obdurate Gen. Ford, determined
to teach the Catholics a lesson about exactly who is in charge.</TE>
<TE>   Far from being a hothead, Ivan Cooper, the man in charge on the
other side, feels exceptionally responsible for the marchers' safety.
He even convinces his colleagues to change the route so as to lessen
the chance of hostilities. "We just want a peaceful march," he says.
"This is our day."</TE>
<TE>   Yet what happened turned out to be beyond anyone's control.
Emotions on both sides proved impossible to contain, and "Bloody
Sunday" conveys to an almost unbearable extent the chaos that
resulted.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's clear where its sympathies lie, the film has been
careful not to treat even the British as anything other than fallible
individuals operating under hellacious pressures. Once positions
hardened, tragedy was all but inevitable, and "Bloody Sunday" does
the spirit of that awful day full and unforgettable justice.</TE>

<AU>Al Martinez</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For a reason I couldn't understand at first, I have been caught up in
the fortunes of the Anaheim Angels, displaying an enthusiasm that is
quite unlike me.</LD>
<LD>   I watched just about every one of the playoff games and even sat
up straight on the couch when something, like a clutch hit or a great
catch, excited me. For me, that's the emotional equivalent of jumping
up and down and waving my rally monkey.</LD>
<LD>   This abrupt departure from form puzzled me. I haven't been to a
sporting event in years. I don't own a Dodger hat and I don't fly a
pennant from the antenna of my car when the Lakers win. In short, I'm
not a fan of the people who hit, run, jump, catch or otherwise
display physical agility.</LD>
<TE>   But there I was nonetheless excited about the abilities of guys
like Adam Kennedy and the kid, Francisco Rodriguez, and hip-hooraying
them with surprising ardor. Then, on the day following their final
victory over Minnesota, it struck me.</TE>
<TE>   The epiphany occurred at a Mark Taper Forum play called "Nickel
and Dimed," by Joan Holden. It's based on the book by Barbara
Ehrenreich, who spent three months living on minimum wages in order
to write about how the working poor survive.</TE>
<TE>   The play is no "Grapes of Wrath," that's for sure, but it did have
the effect of turning me away from baseball and into the world of
32.9 million Americans who exist at the poverty level. And it made me
realize that my sudden interest in the fortunes of the Angels was,
conversely, pulling me away from a world in turmoil.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A reminder of hard times</TE>
<TE>   I guess that's what sports are all about, diverting us from more
worrisome concerns. You don't dwell so much on the fate of humanity
when you're concerned about Troy Percival's pitching arm. It worked
for me for awhile, until I saw "Nickel and Dimed." The play brought
back hard times.</TE>
<TE>   I can remember as a kid during the Depression being so poor we had
nothing to eat, and as a married adult living on the edge of an
economic abyss. Poverty challenges the very nature of one's being,
lowering the threshold of civility to just above that of a dog.</TE>
<TE>   As a 10-year-old, I stole, rummaged for edible food in garbage
cans and sold pulp magazines from door to door. At one time I worked
pitting apricots for pennies, and another time hauled back-breaking
tins of cookies in the unbearably hot basement of a cracker factory.</TE>
<TE>   But we got by in those terrible years because we had goals, and
because there were so many of us in the same fix. Today, it's
different for those at the poverty level, and for the 6.4 million who
are the working poor. We live in an age of possessions in this
country, in an age of million-dollar salaries. The gap between those
who have and those who have not is a chasm, too wide and deep for the
dispossessed to cross. And it's bound to get worse.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Escape, for a night</TE>
<TE>   I didn't really mean to go off on all this. I was going to write a
baseball column, one of those airy efforts that would take me to a
place I rarely visit, which is to say sports. Not that I was ever
going to paint my face red or stand in line all night for a World
Series ticket, but I did put aside a biography on Charles Bukowski to
watch the Angels power-play their way to a win.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until I saw "Nickel and Dimed" that I began to analyze
my interest in the playoffs. I sat up long after Cinelli had gone to
bed and gazed out toward a vista of oak trees illuminated by the pale
light of a crescent moon. Incoming fog diffused the light, creating
the kind of faint glow that brightens fantasies. It's my thinking
view.</TE>
<TE>   I decided that even though the play wasn't what it could have
been, it achieved a purpose for me anyhow. It's what art can do,
alerting the senses to cultural conditions. It reminded those of us
in the audience of the desperation that lies not too far from the
Music Center, just beyond the streetlights.</TE>
<TE>   It brought back all those memories and turned my attention once
more to the plight of the poor, especially the working poor, who are
struggling to achieve something that is beyond their reach. I guess
they're never too far from my consciousness. Experience clings to
memory like underlying pain.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball did its job by diverting me if only momentarily from the
ache that never goes away. And art did its job by bringing me back to
the realities. But I'll still try to escape for a few days starting
tomorrow as the World Series commences. We all need to pause
occasionally. I might even get me one of them jumping monkeys.</TE>

<LD>Finders Keepers</LD>
<LD>   The Story of a Man Who Found $1 Million</LD>
<LD>   By Mark Bowden</LD>
<TE>   Atlantic Monthly Press; $23, 210 pages</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "FINDERS Keepers" is a brisk, sad story about a feckless young
longshoreman in South Philadelphia who found a package of $1.2
million in $100 bills that bounced out of an armored truck near his
home one February day in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   For a week, the tale of how the money was lost from a truck taking
it from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia enchanted the local
media. For a week, the finder, Joey Coyle, tried to hide it, tried to
multiply it.</TE>
<TE>   But he was as inept as the Philadelphia police and the FBI were
dogged. Coyle was so excited by his sudden good fortune that he
couldn't help bragging about it. He told his friends, his girlfriend,
a bartender he didn't know.</TE>
<TE>   As Mark Bowden, a former Philadelphia Inquirer reporter and author
of three other books, including "Black Hawk Down," accurately
reports, South Philly is a close-knit clump of ethnic neighborhoods.
There are few secrets.</TE>
<TE>   Coyle had none of his own left by the time he finished
broadcasting his luck. Along the way he had gone to a local
representative of organized crime -- "he had connections," Coyle said
-- to help him invest some of the loot.</TE>
<TE>   After he was caught at the end of the week, as he tried clumsily
to flee the country, the press tried to portray him as a lovable
boy-next-door type who just got carried away. All that money, after
all. What would you do? The armored car company was insured, wasn't
it? The Federal Reserve wouldn't miss it, would it? Nobody would
really lose, would they?</TE>
<TE>   The truth was darker. Coyle was addicted to methamphetamine. He
needed that money for dope. He was manically high on meth from the
time he found the cash until the cops caught him at New York's
Kennedy Airport bound for Acapulco. Coyle, poorly educated, was
essentially aimless until meth got him by the throat. Because he was
likable, even charming, his family and friends accepted him and tried
to protect him.</TE>
<TE>   But when he found the money, he brushed aside their advice to give
it back and take the offered $50,000 reward. For Coyle, the money was
the biggest thing that had ever happened to him. It made him
somebody. He was no longer the young man with an addiction he was
ashamed of.</TE>
<TE>   That flight from reality ended when he was arrested. All the
missing money was recovered, except for $196,000, which went into the
pockets of those guys who were "connected."</TE>
<TE>   At his trial, the evidence of his addiction was suppressed, and
his lawyer argued to the jury that his good fortune had made him
temporarily insane. The jury acquitted him of all charges: theft,
conspiracy to commit theft and receiving stolen property.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, Coyle went out and got high. He was unhappy, but he
still wanted to make it big.</TE>
<TE>   Enter the movies. Disney moved in. It hired Bowden as a
consultant. Producer Tom Musca and director Ramon Menendez were
interested; they had just done the hit "Stand and Deliver." They had,
Bowden writes, different approaches: "Musca saw it as an urban folk
tale, a comedy. Menendez saw it as a window on a larger social
problem, the declining industrial base and the loss of blue-collar
jobs in the Northeast. Joey would be a lovable victim offered a
sudden, irresistible way out."</TE>
<TE>   John Cusack would play Joey Coyle. His view was like Menendez's.
But in the movie, Joey Coyle would definitely not be a drug addict.
It wouldn't sell. The movie was made for $11 million. Bowden says it
failed to satisfy anyone: "It wasn't humorous enough for Disney, and
it wasn't dark enough for Menendez." The studio lost interest. There
would be no big opening.</TE>
<TE>   And three weeks before its release date, Coyle hanged himself. He
was terrified of the publicity, Bowden writes; ashamed of his
addiction, which he had fed with the $70,000 the studio paid him;
afraid Philadelphia would try to take even that money away from him.
Coyle "was paranoid," Bowden writes near the end of the book, "the
way he got whenever he was high, which was most of the time. The
movie money had just enabled Joey's addiction, which poverty had
actually kept under some semblance of control."</TE>

<HD>Striking 'Naqoyqatsi' rounds out trilogy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Burlingame</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Filmmaker Godfrey Reggio and composer Philip Glass reunite for
"Naqoyqatsi," the conclusion of their film trilogy that began with
"Koyaanisqatsi" (1983) and continued with "Powaqqatsi" (1988). The
concept is laudable: a provocative fusion of image and music designed
to examine the trappings of contemporary civilization and its
negative impact on the planet and ourselves. It worked, to a large
extent, in the visually stunning "Koyaanisqatsi," although
"Powaqqatsi" turned out to be an insufferable bore.</LD>
<LD>   Happily, "Naqoyqatsi" is closer to the first in impressive
imagery, and the music is, for the most part, more successful as a
score than both predecessors. Ironically, Reggio uses all the
high-tech editing, computer animation and digital colorization at his
disposal to sound a warning about the effect of technology. The film
breaks down into three general areas: the wired world, our obsession
with sports and competition and the pace of 21st century life. Along
the way, Reggio tackles medical advances and cloning, the stock
market and globalization and the growing tendency to turn to violence
for problem-solving.</LD>
<TE>   As in "Koyaanisqatsi," much of this is involving, although the
pace is so relentless that it leaves little time to breathe or grasp
precisely what Reggio is attempting to say. The absence of dialogue
or narration is, again, an interesting conceit, but an on-screen
title now and then might have helped to clarify Reggio's often murky
ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Glass' patented minimalist style (which can range from hypnotic to
maddeningly repetitive) is surprisingly effective. The choice to do
this with an orchestra instead of synthesizers -- the latter a more
obvious way to score a film about a frightening future -- was smart,
and employing cellist Yo-Yo Ma as featured soloist was even smarter.
He lends a refreshing human element to the enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   Glass' use of a wordless mezzo-soprano, the Australian didjeridoo
and other offbeat sounds also helps to stave off the aural ennui that
marked the music of the previous films.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rated PG for violent and disturbing images and brief nudity.
Running time: 1 hour, 29 minutes. Exclusively at the Egyptian
Theatre, 6712 Hollywood Blvd., L.A. (323) 466-3456.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hong Kong action trash meets bottom-of-the-barrel British gangster
flick in "Formula 51," an execrable mess that leaves no genre cliche
unturned or human body or soul untrammeled. Samuel L. Jackson stars
as Elmo McElroy, an American pharmaceutical genius who travels to
Liverpool to peddle his latest creation, a drug manufactured from
legal ingredients that combines the effects of cocaine, LSD and
Ecstasy in one little blue pill. The pill, as Elmo puts it, makes you
feel "like you're God," a questionable recommendation that
nonetheless soon has all of Liverpool trying to grab a piece of the
action, usually by brute force.</LD>
<LD>   Sporting a smirk and a kilt, Jackson has the look of a star
marking time on his way to St. Andrews, while the rest of the cast
telegraphs the distracted concern of lesser mortals who just want to
get paid. Among the talent director Ronnie Yu squanders are British
actors Robert Carlyle, Rhys Ifans, Ricky Tomlinson and Anna Keaveney,
none of whom looks believable whether squeezing triggers or trying to
force life into screenwriter Stel Pavlou's inert dialogue.</LD>
<TE>   Pavlou and Yu's contribution to the genre is best illustrated by
one scene in which skinheads are overcome by diarrhea and another in
which a man erupts after swallowing an explosive, leaving the place
covered in what looks like Ragu. Your tolerance for this sort of
thing may depend on the pills at your disposal as well as your hunger
level.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rated R for strong violence, language, drug content and some
sexuality. In general release.</TE>

<HD>Long-winded 'Happiness'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Takashi Miike's "The Happiness of the Katakuris" is in the Japanese
tradition of pitch-dark absurdist comedy. It combines a spoof of the
cliches of the Hollywood musical with a plot that faintly echoes that
of the French classic "The Red Inn" (1951) but with the difference
that the few guests of this film's inn tend to wind up dead
inadvertently rather than intentionally.</LD>
<LD>   "Happiness," however, having skewered every aspect of family life
imaginable, seems to go sentimental in the final reel, extolling
family solidarity and the capacity of mankind to endure. Miike may
actually be spoofing these vaunted sentiments, but it's hard to say
for sure, because he gives the impression of constantly shifting
positions. Not helping matters is that the film is long-winded and
ultimately uninvolving.</LD>
<TE>   Having lost his longtime department-store job, Masao Katakuri
(Kenji Sawada) has somehow managed to finance the construction of a
comfortable guest cottage by the side of a dirt road in a forest with
the idea that he and his family, which includes his elderly father
(Tetsuro Tamba, veteran samurai and yakuza star), will eventually
cash in big with the planned construction of a highway nearby. Their
ill-fated guests include a guy who persuades Katakuri's gullible
daughter to believe that he's the half-Japanese nephew of Queen
Elizabeth, and a sumo wrestler with his decidedly underage inamorata.
None of this is nearly as hilarious as surely it was meant to be.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Through Thursday, exclusively at the Nuart, 11272 Santa Monica
Blvd., West Los Angeles, (310) 478-6379. In Japanese with English
subtitles. Running time: 1 hour, 53 minutes. Unrated. Some violence,

<DL></DL>
<LD>In its quiet way, Reza Mir-Karimi's "Under the Moonlight" is
courageous and daring, for while it upholds Islam, it reveals the
extreme hardship of those left behind in an Islamic society. It has
the simplicity typical of Iranian films of social comment: The
central figure faces an unexpected loss or challenge that propels him
on a mission that passes through a revealing cross section of people
and circumstances.</LD>
<LD>   Hossein Parastar stars as Sayyed Hassan, a young rural seminarian
who arrives in Tehran with an instantly frowned-upon sports magazine
and cell phone in hand to take the final step in becoming a clergyman
to please his father. The seminary's abiding concern for form in
precise detail causes Sayyed to question the course of his life, yet
he goes ahead and orders the long robe and turban he must have for
his ordination ceremony. He picks up the completed garments, only to
have them stolen aboard a subway by Jojeh (Chick), a resilient little
street urchin.</LD>
<LD>   His pursuit of Chick leads him to a community of homeless men who
have set up a makeshift camp under a highway bridge on the outskirts
of Tehran, which proves to be a transforming experience for Sayyed.
"Under the Moonlight" is overly preachy and maudlin but is saved by
its obvious sincerity and forthright sense of purpose, and further
enhanced by its rich color cinematography.</LD>

<HD>Brokering peace at KPFK</HD>
<DH>A retreat seeks common ground between new general manager
Eva Georgia and those who say she's undemocratic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Carney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Radio by collective -- with listeners and volunteers joining staff in
programming and management decisions -- may seem a ludicrous notion
in this era of corporate, consultant-driven radio, with playlists
tighter than 'N Sync's choreography. But it's seen as a birthright at
KPFK-FM (90.7), the Los Angeles outlet of the left-leaning Pacifica
radio network.</LD>
<LD>   So staff unrest nearly percolated into mutiny only four months
into Eva Georgia's tenure as general manager when a large contingent
of employees and volunteers at the community-supported station were
calling for her removal, or at least criticizing her for running a
non-democratic workplace. Georgia, on the other hand, said that after
years of upheaval at the station, any organization might be
interpreted as authoritarianism.</LD>
<LD>   "Trying to put structure where you have chaos comes across as, my
management style is, yeah, dictator or whatever," said Georgia, who
got her start in community broadcasting in apartheid-era South
Africa. "This is a group of hard-working and committed people, but
they worked in a structure where they pretty much managed
themselves."</LD>
<TE>   One general manager was fired early this year, and the station had
two interim GMs before Georgia was hired in June. Since then, she
said, she's been trying to bring some stability to the workplace, but
some employees saw it differently. At the end of September, workers
signed a petition criticizing the "corporate structure" and lack of
transparency in decision-making.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a travesty that this progressive institution, which covers
the labor struggles of countless workers all over the nation and the
world, is functioning as a workplace where there is no job security,
and frequently inadequate or nonexistent benefits," the staff wrote.
Sonali Kolhatkar, host of the station's weekday "Morning Show," wrote
an open letter accusing Georgia of intimidation and of firing
staffers who oppose her.</TE>
<TE>   Which is all part of why the staff and management are embarking on
a retreat this weekend, to polish their communication and
conflict-resolution skills. And why officials from the Pacifica
Foundation, which operates KPFK and four other stations in its
network, is working with the station to establish a program council,
a committee with a set of guidelines to democratically change
programming at the station.</TE>
<TE>   Lydia Brazon, chairman of KPFK's Local Advisory Board, said the
staff unrest stems from basic sources -- they've been working without
a union contract for a year, they lack benefits, many workers have no
job descriptions, and others who were temporary hires wanted
permanent jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "Because it's KPFK, because it's Pacifica, because the
expectations are so enormous, that for a time raised it to this fever
pitch," Brazon said.</TE>
<TE>   Founded by pacifists in Berkeley after World War II, the Pacifica
Foundation was the first to develop listener-supported radio, at
KPFA-FM, and grew to a five-station network that also owns stations
in Houston, New York and Washington, D.C. But the network had been
beset by years of vicious infighting, with a group of disgruntled
listeners and Pacifica board members charging that those running the
network were softening radical programming, quashing dissent and even
trying to sell off stations. Last year, as part of a lawsuit
settlement, the dissidents took control of Pacifica, saying they
rescued the network from those more aligned with corporate interests
than the social-justice ideals of its founders.</TE>
<TE>   But after a half-dozen years of pickets, protests, campaigns and
intrigue, suspicions can be hard to shake. "People will always assume
that decisions are being made behind closed doors, and we need to
change that," said David Fertig, an Altadena-based attorney and the
Los Angeles representative to the Pacifica national board of
directors. "We need to develop a dynamic where we're not running
things by political power play and petition. If everyone is willing
to come to the table, we can make it happen."</TE>
<TE>   Georgia's critics say that she's unfit to run KPFK, pointing to
reports from South Africa that she mismanaged the staff and budget of
the community radio station she founded there, Radio Atlantis. But
Georgia said the tales are home-grown fabrications by her enemies,
and said threats against her from gangsters and vigilantes because of
her muckraking forced her to seek asylum in the U.S. in 1999. Critics
also question her firing a year ago from the Gay and Lesbian
Community Center of Greater Long Beach. But Georgia, alleging racial
discrimination at the center, filed a wrongful termination lawsuit
that's still pending.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia said she's already cleared up allegations about her past
for her bosses but won't do the same for her accusers. "I'm no better
than them if I get into this muddy fight."</TE>
<TE>   Once the questions arose, Pacifica executive director Dan Coughlin
said, the network hired an independent investigator to verify what
Georgia had said and what had already been examined in the background
check before she was hired.</TE>
<TE>   "We were concerned, obviously," he said. "The questions that
community radio activists raised about the hire were of tremendous
concern." But he said a thorough and independent inquiry "determined
that the hiring of Eva should not be reversed and was sound."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, suspicions and conflicts continue. Esther Manilla,
the station's interim program director until she resigned a week ago,
initially refused to give Georgia a set of keys to KPFK, after
hearing allegations about Georgia's background. Later, Manilla
refused to co-sign a $50,000 check, a loan from Pacifica
headquarters, without an assurance it would be repaid. Georgia fired
her for insubordination, then reinstated her.</TE>
<TE>   "They say I'm an obstructionist, but I think I did the right
thing," said Manilla, who was one of three staff members on the
search committee that picked Georgia. "I don't think we made a good
decision. It was a rushed decision," Manilla said. "She doesn't have
the station's best interests in mind. It's all personal. Morale is
just so low -- everybody there is looking to get out or waiting for a
miracle."</TE>
<TE>   Georgia countered, "Am I a strong-willed person? Oh, absolutely. I
push really hard. I have high expectations; I have high expectations
for myself. Is that challenging for people? Absolutely."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the station is soldiering on. After a tight budget and
delayed repairs had the station's signal at 8,000 watts for several
months, KPFK's transmitter is back to full power, broadcasting at
112,000 watts. And an August fund drive raised $300,000 for the
station.</TE>

<HD>Filmmaker sees trilogy as a wake-up call to Earth</HD>

<LD>Filmmaker Godfrey Reggio thinks we are living in a time of war,
although the war he refers to is not one conducted with bullets and
bombs between nations, but a far more encompassing one: the war
between humanity and technology. And technology, he fears, is winning
out.</LD>
<LD>   "It's about the complete transformation of the environment in
which we're in," he says. "Technology means power, control,
homogenization, mass man. To me, it's very negative, it's taking us
out of our human orbit; it's wrecking the Earth."</LD>
<LD>   For Reggio, the embrace of technology has been accompanied by the
embrace of homogenization -- or, as he puts it, "the Los Angelization
of the planet, where things are becoming more similar than
dissimilar. For me, this is a tragedy.... My film is an attempt to
raise questions about a subject in which there is very little
questioning going on. This is an attempt through art to raise
questions about the world in which we live."</LD>
<TE>   His wake-up call has taken the form of a film trilogy, made over a
quarter of a century, in close collaboration with composer Philip
Glass. Like its predecessors, the latest and last installment,
"Naqoyqatsi," is hard to describe, let alone pronounce
("nah-KOY-kahtsee"). The film, which opens today, presents an
impressionistic cascade of images and music, without actors or
dialogue to guide our way. Buildings dissolve into waves, and
stream-of-consciousness sequences show news footage of marching
soldiers, riots, and faces famous (from Madonna to Fidel Castro to
Billy Graham) and anonymous, the globe as an integrated circuit, and
a dizzying tunnel of zeroes and ones.</TE>
<TE>   A seeming cacophony, but serious themes are embedded within,
Reggio says. Each film's title offers a clue; they were taken from
the Hopi language to avoid familiar associations. "Koyaanisqatsi,"
released in 1983, was about "life out of balance"; "Powaqqatsi,"
released five years later, translates as "life in transformation";
and "Naqoyqatsi" is about "life as war."</TE>
<TE>   "Naqoyqatsi" opens with Bruegel's 16th century painting of the
Tower of Babel, depicting a biblical story in which people unified by
the same language began to build a tower toward heaven. As a former
Christian Brothers monk, Reggio has studied the Bible more closely
than most, and his explanations are sprinkled with religious
references.</TE>
<TE>   "From the beginning, I felt this story was a prefiguration, a
prophecy of the future," he recalls, speaking by telephone from his
home base of Sante Fe, N.M. "I feel it mirrors precisely the moment
we're in right now -- where through the hubris of one language, one
idea, one way, one world, we feel like we can do anything, that we're
like unto God. The new god is the computer; it becomes the new
nature."</TE>
<TE>   Born in New Orleans in 1940, Reggio attended Catholic schools.
Turned off by the fast social life and striving he saw around him, he
was impressed with his Christian Brothers teachers, especially "their
idealism, their generosity, their willingness to be there for other
people, their seriousness and their playfulness." At 14, he got the
calling and entered the order.</TE>
<TE>   But while Reggio was devoted to the charitable purposes of the
order, some of the specifics rankled him. Fourteen years later, he
left over a dispute about his work with street gangs. It seems to
some extent that Reggio still sees himself as an educator, and his
solemn, gravelly delivery has a pedagogical tone.</TE>
<TE>   In 1959, he had moved to Sante Fe to continue his training as a
brother, and he has remained there ever since. In 1972, he co-founded
the Institute for Regional Education, a nonprofit organization whose
first project was to raise awareness of how technology was being used
to invade privacy and control behavior. Its next project was
"Koyaanisqatsi," which started out modestly enough as a half-hour
project on 16-millimeter film until the institute realized that a
full-length, 35-millimeter film might gain wider distribution.</TE>
<TE>   During the early stages of production, Reggio was introduced to
the music of Philip Glass -- and immediately knew he would be the
ideal composer for his film. Never having done a film score before,
Glass was initially reluctant.</TE>
<TE>   Then Reggio came to New York in 1978 with a sample clip overlaid
with previously recorded Glass music, and the composer agreed to take
on the project. It was Glass who suggested making a trilogy, an idea
Reggio adopted.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, "Koyaanisqatsi" has become recognized as an art film
classic, and it won a large audience when it was aired on PBS. Glass
has been pleasantly surprised by the reception, and now he regularly
takes "Koyaanisqatsi" and "Powaqqatsi" on the road, performing the
music with a live orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   "Each film bridges a new gap, goes to a new place," Glass says.
"Each film score was also radically different. 'Koyaanisqatsi' was
really an amplified ensemble piece; 'Powaqqatsi' was really world
music with musicians from all over the world. The third one, we went
to an acoustical orchestra, with Yo-Yo Ma playing the solo. You might
say, as the films became more visually radical, I sought a common
ground with the spectator by going to a more acoustical and
traditional sound."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the art house success of his first two features, Reggio
hit a major stumbling block trying to fund the last of his trilogy.
"Any small success those other films had were an anomaly. I looked
for angels -- people willing to take on a bad deal for the love of
the project -- rather than for serious investors."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, he found his angel in the form of another filmmaker,
Steven Soderbergh. Two years ago, Soderbergh read a New York Times
article about Reggio's fund-raising problems and he offered start-up
money for the production from his own pocket. Reggio flew to Los
Angeles to meet with him.</TE>
<TE>   "There was remarkable clarity and soberness on his part. I felt
enormously charged by the meeting," Reggio said. "It was he that
brought in [Miramax co-founder] Harvey Weinstein. To me, it showed he
[Weinstein] was a lover of film; obviously, this is not going to be a
big box office hit." (The film is being distributed by Miramax.)</TE>
<TE>   In order to work closely with Glass during the 18-month
production, Reggio set up shop in New York. Following a broad outline
he had written, he and his team had been collecting a massive
selection of illustrations, photographs, commercials, television
shows and stock footage, which was augmented with original footage of
their own. Most of it was then manipulated through digital technology
by producer and techno-whiz Joe Beirne.</TE>
<TE>   Reggio quickly admits he is using technology to combat technology.
"I'm not trying to find an excuse for this contradiction," he says.
"I'm only saying that technology is the lingua franca of the
technological order, and that if I wish to talk in that world,
technology is the medium to do so."</TE>

<HD>Digging up truth, not anger</HD>
<DH>To re-create Bloody Sunday, even as reconciliation
continues, filmmaker Paul Greengrass brought together British and
Irish, Protestants and Catholics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Desowitz</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irish director and producer Jim Sheridan ("My Left Foot" and "In the
Name of the Father") refers to Bloody Sunday as an event the Irish
can never forget and the British don't want to remember. Thanks in
large part to Don Mullan's influential 1997 book, "Eyewitness Bloody
Sunday: The Truth" the British government launched a new inquiry a
few years back and publicly exonerated the participants in the 1972
march. And thanks to U2's blistering song "Sunday Bloody Sunday," the
violent day has become known throughout the world.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes "Bloody Sunday," a film inspired by Mullan's book. The
movie, written and directed by British filmmaker Paul Greengrass,
viscerally dramatizes the horrific 24 hours in gritty documentary
fashion. Greengrass, a former journalist who covered the IRA hunger
strikes in the early '80s and previously made another fact-based
drama about political injustice, "The Murder of Stephen Lawrence,"
sought from the outset to be as inclusive as possible through a
British-Irish co-production.</LD>
<LD>   The director joined forces with British-owned Granada and
Sheridan's Hell's Kitchen production company, among others. He then
invited Mullan to collaborate as co-producer. In addition to writing
his book, Mullan was a young eyewitness to one of the murders.</LD>
<TE>   "Our movie became a metaphor for unity and bringing an
extraordinary diverse group of people together on the set," Mullan
says. "People from Northern Ireland who are Catholic and Protestant;
people who had lost loved ones on Bloody Sunday; eyewitnesses to the
event; lots of volunteers who had known about the event; and our
soldiers, former British soldiers who were in Northern Ireland at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   "We created a chemistry that really works in the film, but it
could've been a Molotov cocktail that blew up in our faces. Everyone
had a shared vision in trying to find the truth so that we could
consign it to the past."</TE>
<TE>   They filmed in Derry, where the march took place, wherever
possible. But restaging the arrival of hundreds of troops and the
firing of dozens of rounds of ammunition during the sensitive peace
process was out of the question because the site of the shootings had
long since been demolished, so they settled on a housing development
in north Dublin.</TE>
<TE>   "The hardest part was not to make a film that just stirs up anger
and resentment," Greengrass says. "We're building a peace in Northern
Ireland. The idea was to make a film that kept a clear sight of that
injustice but yet became an experience of reconciliation. In a way,
the film, stripped of its [historical and political] context, becomes
a macabre dance between protest and intransigence and how it erupts
and leads to violence."</TE>
<TE>   The model for Greengrass' film was "The Battle of Algiers" (1965),
director Gillo Pontecorvo's landmark re-creation of the anti-French
terrorist revolt, which was shot on location and relied on actual
participants.</TE>
<TE>   "What struck me in thinking about 'Algiers' was that its
idealistic message wasn't applicable here," the director explains.
"My whole life has been framed by the 'Troubles.' We live in a time
of post-colonial conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me that the legacy of Bloody Sunday -- the meaning of
it -- is about the primacy of the civil rights movement. The fact
that most of the civil rights movement was destroyed that day, a
message that has lived on and has come to fruition today, is a
message applicable to many parts of the world. Which is why the film
feels so contemporary. The ideas in it are urgently relevant."</TE>
<TE>   The film's central character is march leader Ivan Cooper (James
Nesbitt), a civil rights activist and Protestant member of Parliament
who was inspired by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. but who left the peace
movement after Bloody Sunday. For the real Cooper, who visited the
set one day, watching "Bloody Sunday" last January was a daunting
experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I watched it in the course of a special showing for the relatives
of those who died on Bloody Sunday," he said in a recent interview.
"Some of these I had not met since that fateful day. Once the film
started to run, with the brutally realistic soundtrack, I was right
back in the Bogside on that day. I was back amongst the terror, the
terrible fear and the terrible tragedy of it all. I was most
apprehensive about watching the film. The relatives, however, were a
great source of support to me. It is so very starkly realistic."</TE>
<TE>   The screening deeply affected Greengrass as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the families of those innocent people watch this film and
react not with anger and bitterness, but with great generosity and
with a yearning for peace," he recalled. "And I thought of the core
of the civil rights message, that we all of us inhabit these
beautiful islands scattered on the northwestern edge of Europe and
that we hold so much more in common than that which divides us."</TE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're in the mood for a righteous scare this Halloween season,
scurry through the gathering mist to "The Woman in Black" at the Road
Theatre. There are no blood or guts or graphic eviscerations to be
found here, only the kind of old-school suspense that relies on
slamming doors, blustery winds and things that go bump in the night.
If you prefer the gothic to the gory, this finely crafted period
ghost story will put you so on edge, you'll likely require a full
chiropractic adjustment afterward.</LD>
<LD>   The longest running London hit since "The Mousetrap," Stephen
Mallatratt's deft adaptation of Susan Hill's novel has been a hit in
the West End for the past 14 years and counting. Hill's novel is a
worthy source material, the basis for an underrated 1989 film version
that is possibly one of the scariest made-for-television movies ever
made. However, in Ken Sawyer's masterful staging at the Road, the
theatrical version is even scarier than the film -- and that's saying
something.</LD>
<TE>   The story offers the classic elements of the genre -- a huge and
isolated country house; a crumbling graveyard just beyond; a
protagonist who ignores the veiled warnings of the terrified locals
and insists on staying at the eldritch estate all by his lonesome.
Mr. Kipps (Joe Hart), a solicitor, is dispatched to a remote seaside
village to sort through the papers and effects of his firm's longtime
client, until her death the sole resident of Eel Marsh House, a
rambling residence accessible only at low tide. Transportation is
arranged to the estate, but other than that, few are willing to go
near the place -- with the exception of an invited guest, a
mysterious woman in black whose identity remains obscure until later
... too late.</TE>
<TE>   That basic plot line is enough to give anyone a permanent
bouffant, but Mallatratt's ingenious innovation of confining the
action to an empty London theater -- an eerie locale perfectly
realized in Desma Murphy's shadowy set -- expands the piece's
possibilities exponentially. In Mallatratt's adaptation, the main
events of the story are already past. Kipps has hired the Actor (Paul
Witten) to help him rehearse a staged reading of Kipps' written
reminisces of Eel Marsh House, a performance he hopes will exorcise
his lingering horror over his inexplicable experiences there. For the
purposes of the reading, the Actor plays Kipps, while Kipps plays the
lesser roles. It's a brilliant device, a tour de force for Hart and
Witten, who subtly calibrate the emotional rhythms, from the music
hall broadness of the initial scenes all the way to the genuine
horror and anguish of the denouement.</TE>
<TE>   The play's suspense relies largely on the absolute precision of
the lighting and sound cues. Sawyer and David B. Marling's sound and
Robert L. Smith's lighting are first-rate, while Mary Jane Miller's
costumes, David Burnham's scenic art, and Jeff Marsh's music complete
the ghastly trimmings on this frightful, delightful treat -- a
knee-knocker at Halloween.</TE>

<LD>There is little doubt that everyone involved in the making of "The
Grey Zone," a film about Jewish prisoners forced to man the gas
chambers and crematoriums at Auschwitz, had the best of intentions
when they embarked on this project. That holds especially true for
writer and director Tim Blake Nelson, whose struggle to shoot, then
secure distribution for the film reads like an exemplary tale of
heroic independence in the face of base commercial indifference. The
problem is that good intentions are as useless as artistic ambitions
at Auschwitz, where neither art nor sentimentality has a place. It
isn't just that there's something unsettling about a film that
aestheticizes a crematorium; it's that there's something trivializing
about the very effort.</LD>
<TE>   Based on a play by Nelson first staged in 1996 and named after a
chapter in Primo Levi's memoir "The Drowned and the Saved," "The Grey
Zone" unfolds just as a squad of these Jewish prisoners, called the
Sonderkommandos, is planning a revolt. As the day and night wear on,
the men argue and plan the uprising against a backdrop of their
horrifying daily labor -- escorting prisoners, other Jews mainly,
into the gas chambers, then disposing of their corpses in the ovens
and fiery pits. Levi called the Sonderkommandos "National Socialism's
most demonic crime." They were men, he wrote, in whom "the tradition
of hostility toward the stranger makes of them monsters of asociality
and insensitivity."</TE>
<TE>   You get glimpses of these monsters in "The Grey Zone," as when a
Sonderkommando fatally beats an arrival to the sounds of the man's
screaming wife. The scene is horrible to watch and yet nowhere
horrible enough. None of it is. Steven Spielberg's decision to show
water rather than Zyklon B flowing from shower heads in "Schindler's
List" may have been misguided, but you can understand why he opted
not to re-create the agonies of the gas chambers: It would have been
unbearable. The crimes committed at Auschwitz were unspeakable; at
their worst, they were beyond what entertainment cinema, which
demands realism but not necessarily truth, can show us.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson nonetheless tries by re-creating the camp's violence with
excruciating detail. He shows us men, women and children in transport
trains. (Still, the train cars are too roomy; unlike the real
deportees, the actors can sit, stand and breathe freely.) He shows us
the gas chambers, the ovens, the pits and the truckloads of ash being
hauled off for burial. He shows the gas chambers being scrubbed clean
of smears of blood and excrement, then whitewashed so the horror can
begin again. It's almost as if Nelson believed that if he could
re-create the mechanism of death, he could crack its code, get at its
meaning, even refute Levi's famous observation -- spoken to him by a
camp guard -- that there was no "why" at Auschwitz. But Nelson can't,
which is why sections of "The Grey Zone" resemble nothing so much as
a ghastly process film.</TE>
<TE>   This material meticulousness stands in perverse contrast to the
screenplay and the performances, both of which seem to belong to some
other film. Nelson's dialogue, pumped up with stilted, theatrical
cadences, may have worked fine on a New York City stage, but sounds
ridiculous coming out of the mouths of the likes of David Arquette,
Steve Buscemi, Mira Sorvino, Natascha Lyonne, Daniel Benzali and
Harvey Keitel. (The actors playing Nazis speak in German-accented
English; most of the rest of the principals converse in their normal
voices, a surreal touch in the case of the Brooklyn-born Buscemi.)
The cast looks persuasively miserable but only David Chandler, as a
Sonderkommando, and, in the film's best performance, Allan Corduner
as a Jewish doctor working for Dr. Mengele, transcend the abject
text.</TE>
<TE>   It helps that Corduner and Chandler have unfamiliar faces. Sorvino
and the other name actors may have secured the film's finances, but
they are a distraction: There isn't a moment when she's on screen
that you're not aware that Sorvino's sepulchral cheekbones are as
much an actor's conceit as the pitch of her character's cries. In
this regard it's inconceivable that Nelson didn't consider the
ramifications of casting Arquette in the lead role, not simply
because the actor has yet to demonstrate he has the depth the part
demands, but because he's best known for the "Scream" franchise. "The
Grey Zone" is filled with such miscalculation, including a subplot
concerning a young girl who survives the gas and becomes the spur to
a palpably false debate, the stuff of high school ethics, as to
whether one life is worth hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson has said that he was inspired to tell the story of "The
Grey Zone" after learning about the Sonderkommandos, realizing, as he
put it, that "I was an able-bodied man in his 30s. That could have
been me. So it became very personal." The desire to personalize the
Holocaust is reasonable but it is a hazardous point of departure for
a story as difficult and immense as that of the Nazi extermination
camps, in part because personalizing that story is to risk trading
understanding for empathy, even where none is warranted. Nelson
either can't bear or simply refuses to create characters as monstrous
as Levi described. But just as there is no need for drama at
Auschwitz, in which everyday life was an epic of suffering, neither
is there a place for sentimentalism.</TE>

<HD>Watching the Series with the boss? Hit a dinger</HD>
<DH>Here are some tips to help even a baseball know-nothing
sound game-savvy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. Michael Kennedy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So the Series is about to start, and the boss has invited you over to
watch the first game. Trouble is, your knowledge of baseball consists
of a few games played in fifth-grade PE. Here, then, is a primer that
should help you bluff your way through the game and keep you in line
for that big raise. And remember to bring beer.</LD>
<LD>   First, a couple of don'ts. Under no circumstance do you ask how
many points have been scored. It's runs and runs only. Second, about
foul balls: Don't ask how they can be strikes some of the time but
not others. Until the batter has two strikes, fouls are bad things.
After that, they are referred to as "battling" the pitcher, a good
thing. That's baseball.</LD>
<LD>   Now let's move on. Here are some phrases, sayings, pieces of
trivia and observations that you can use in the course of the game.
And remember to compliment the boss on the bean dip.</LD>
<TE>   "Can-uh-corn": Actually it's "can of corn," but saying it that way
is a dead giveaway of your rookieness. Mutter this several times
during the game on easy fly balls to the outfield.</TE>
<TE>   "I bet Kennedy never even hit three homers in a Little League
game": a nonchalant reference to the fact that Adam Kennedy hit three
home runs -- tying a major league record -- in the game that put the
Angels in the World Series. Follow it up with the fact that the
Baseball Hall of Fame has asked for the bat.</TE>
<TE>   "Salmon is the real winner in all of this": An allusion to Angel
veteran Tim Salmon, who's never played for any other club and who
signed a five-year contract in 2001 rather than test the free agency
market. Mention, too, that he was the 1993 rookie of the year, the
only Angel ever to win that title.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why they call it the hot corner": Say this once when a
ball is hit hard to the third baseman.</TE>
<TE>   "My favorite columnist is Rick Reilly": Subtly tells the boss you
subscribe to "Sports Illustrated."</TE>
<TE>   "I remember when the Angels played in Dodger Stadium": for older
employees only. The Angels played in Dodger Stadium from 1962-65.
Follow up with the fact that the Angels played their first year in
Wrigley Field ... the one that was in L.A., not Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "This pitcher's got some cheese": Cheese means speed. "Heat" can
also be used. Breaking pitches like curves and sliders are also
called "junk." When a pitcher throws a particularly good breaking
ball, use this phrase admiringly: "Man, that pitch was dirty."</TE>
<TE>   "Talk about a frozen rope": a hard-hit line drive.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll take a Texas Leaguer any day": a bloop single that just
clears the infield.</TE>
<TE>   "That ball had eyes": a ground ball that somehow gets through the
infield for a hit.</TE>
<TE>   "Dinger": another name for a home run. Other terms include
"homer," "four bagger," "round tripper" and "tater." Dingers are
often hit on a "meatball" pitch, which means one right over the
plate. As in: "My grandmother could have hit that meatball out of
there."</TE>
<TE>   "Painting the black": when a pitcher is throwing with such
precision that the ball is going over the outer edge of the plate,
which is outlined in black.</TE>
<TE>   "59": the professed age of the immortal Satchel Paige when he
threw his last pitch in pro baseball. He may actually have been
older. This is between-innings filler while munching on the nachos.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish Gene could be here": a l nod to Gene Autry, the
now-deceased cowboy film star who owned the Angels for many years.
Another phrase to drop, "I wonder if the bums at Disney are going to
sell them now."</TE>
<TE>   "That guy always gets on": For Barry Bonds, the Giant superstar
who gets on base on average more than once out of every two at bats,
a phenomenal statistic. "I've never seen him smile so much": more
Bonds, who's actually been seen grinning. Normally he looks as if
he's had vinegar for breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   "Tools of ignorance": another name for catcher's gear.</TE>
<TE>   If all this is too much to remember, just agree with everything
the boss says. And don't forget the beer.</TE>

<HD>New VH1 series explores jailhouse rock</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Musicians like to brag about the tough crowds they've played to, but
few can top the intimidating audience Pennsylvania heavy metal band
Dark Mischief faces regularly. We're not talking unruly types who
hurl insults -- or even beer bottles -- but thieves, rapists and
murderers.</LD>
<LD>   Dark Mischief's world tour consists of one venue: the Pennsylvania
State Correctional Institution at Graterford, a maximum-security
prison that allows inmates to play music in their free time.</LD>
<LD>   And talk about performance pressure: If their fellow criminals
give Dark Mischief a bad review, the members can lose the privilege
of rehearsing and performing for a year.</LD>
<TE>   Dark Mischief is profiled in a new VH1 series, "Music Behind
Bars." Tonight's premiere is the first of an initial batch of eight
episodes on prison music programs around the country.</TE>
<TE>   "My facility is a maximum-security facility, and many of the guys
who are involved in the band here are doing life or extensive lengths
of time," says Jeff Merrill, the warden at Maine State Prison in
Thomaston, which is featured in a later episode. "For them, it's a
way of coping, a way of expressing themselves and a way of making the
time go faster. It reduces the idleness and, as a result, they don't
seem to get in so much trouble. I see it as a win-win all around."</TE>
<TE>   For VH1, the series lets the cable music channel expand the
parameters of its original programming while keeping music central to
the equation.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been noodling around with lots of different ways to show
how music plays an important role in all our lives," says VH1's Rob
Weiss, executive producer of the series. "What really struck us here
is that one way it can be powerful is in a redemptive way, and in
prison, music can have a profoundly positive impact."</TE>
<TE>   Not that it turns murderers into choirboys.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the main points ... was that in showing the redemptive
aspect of music in prisons, we would be showing how these music
programs take some of the most violent prisoners and makes good
prisoners out of them," says "Music Behind Bars" producer Arnold
Shapiro, best known for his 1979 documentary "Scared Straight."</TE>
<TE>   "That makes it safer for the correctional officers who work inside
these prisons without weapons, as well as the dozens of men and women
who go in and out every day: doctors, lawyers, psychologists and the
rest."</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro says the idea wasn't to celebrate or glorify any of the
prisoners, but to present an unvarnished view of their lives and the
crimes they committed and allow viewers to see how music soothes
these savage breasts.</TE>
<TE>   Many who are involved with the inmates find it a tremendously
moving experience.</TE>
<TE>   "A favorite song of theirs is 'The Rose,' " says Anna Willis, who
leads the choir at the New Hampshire State Prison for Women in
Goffstown. "The first time I heard them sing it, I got out my
keyboard and started playing along. I couldn't believe what I saw and
heard. It was like they left that room. They were out the window,
through the bars, over the razor wire. It was clear what the role of
music was for them: They became free. I just sat there and cried."</TE>
<TE>   Most prison music programs are merit-based. "To be honest," Maine
warden Merrill says, "the population realizes it's such a privilege
they wouldn't sacrifice that. To date, nothing bad has happened here.
We've been very fortunate."</TE>
<TE>   Do any of these would-be rock stars dream of fame and fortune when
they get out?</TE>
<TE>   "Most of them are pretty realistic," says series co-executive
producer Jay Blumenfield. "They're doing it to get by, they're
enjoying it and it's helping them on the inside. Some may hold on to
the rock 'n' roll dream of getting out and making it, and maybe one
or two will."</TE>
<TE>   For most, the reward that music offers is more immediate.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys feel free when they're playing music," says
Blumenfield, a former member of the band Too Much Joy. "I felt the
same way when I was playing, and I wasn't a prisoner: I felt free and
it was unbelievable. For these guys, it's 4 billion times that. It's
the only moment in their day when they feel anything like that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Music Behind Bars" premieres at 10 tonight on VH1.</TE>

<HD>A line for the Carousel</HD>
<DH>How hot was Barbara Davis' charity ball? It had a waiting
list of more than 100.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gina Piccalo and Ann Conway</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was Jay Leno in the Beverly Hilton Hotel lobby, testing his
stage material on the arriving crowds. ("From the senior section,
ladies and gentleman: Mr. Don Rickles and Mr. Bob Newhart!") In the
dining room, Elton John huddled with fellow Brits Sting and Elizabeth
Hurley. Down the hall, Sidney Poitier smiled graciously as a guest
told the actor that his role in "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"
changed his life. Hotel owner and resident Merv Griffin watched the
crowd and quipped, "People come to this event from around the world,
and I come downstairs."</LD>
<LD>   The event was the the biennial Carousel of Hope Ball, held Tuesday
night. And there, in a cloud of glitter-shot pink chiffon designed by
Oscar de la Renta, her neck and ears dripping with "40-year-old"
diamonds and rubies, stood the evening's hostess, Barbara Davis. "I
wanted to feel like a fairy princess," said the 71-year-old wife of
Denver oilman Marvin Davis. On this night, Davis was as close to
royalty as an American billionaire gets. That is, Hollywood deemed
her party the (non-Oscar-related) event of the season and turned up
in droves. More than 100 people were on the waiting list, ready to
spend $5,000 per ticket.</LD>
<TE>   The gala is considered the world's premier fundraiser for
childhood diabetes. Since its inception in 1978, it has raised more
than $60 million for the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes
in Denver, which treats 4,000 children each year. Tuesday's ball,
attended by an estimated 1,300 people, raised $4.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually everyone moved into the palatial ballroom, where the
chairs and tables were covered in pink satin. The Davises sat with
their favorite A-listers. To their right was Elton John. To their
left was Oprah Winfrey, who introduced the hostess. "Barbara, girl,
you know how to throw a fancy-shmancy party!" she said from the
stage.</TE>
<TE>   Davis took the podium, rattled off several famous names in
attendance, sighed dramatically and said, "It's overwhelming!" She
went on to explain her devotion to the cause. "We won't accept
blindness," she said of the potential ravages of diabetes. "We will
not accept the loss of limbs!"</TE>
<TE>   Just then, the notoriously late Elizabeth Taylor, carrying a copy
of her new book, "Elizabeth Taylor: My Love Affair With Jewelry,"
made her way through the crowd with her dermatologist, Arnold Klein.
While hundreds of guests dined on sirloin, "Dame Liz" picked at a
custom-ordered cheeseburger.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, midway through B.B. King and Kelsey Grammer's
performance of "Let the Good Times Roll," Lakers owner Jerry Buss'
head fell to his chest and he turned stark white. Word spread that
he'd had a heart attack. "Is there a doctor in the house?" Grammer
shouted. Within moments paramedics arrived. (Later, a spokesman for
Buss said that he suffered a pinched nerve in his neck when he turned
his head too quickly. He was treated and released from Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center the same night.)</TE>
<TE>   As Buss was placed on a stretcher and transported to a waiting
ambulance, Elton John looked at Taylor and said, "See, Elizabeth,
what you still do to men?"</TE>

<HD>'Pipe Dream' makes sweet sense of a plumber's ruse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't get David Kulovic wrong. It's not that he's unhappy in his
work, but the kind of attractive, available women he'd like to meet
aren't interested in, well, plumbers. But movie directors, that's a
different story. Or so David thinks.</LD>
<LD>   "Pipe Dream," a smart, sweet and playful romantic comedy starring
Martin Donovan and Mary-Louise Parker, shows what happens when David
gets to live out his (and a lot of other people's) fantasies and
pretend he's ace New York director David Copelberg (named after the
only two filmmakers whose work he knows).</LD>
<LD>   Set in Manhattan's independent film scene, "Pipe Dream" takes wry
pleasure in poking fun at the mores of a business in which no one
would even think of telling the truth, and in which rumor, evasion
and small lies are the order of the day. And that's not the plumbing
business either.</LD>
<TE>   "Pipe Dream" was directed and co-written (with Cynthia Kaplan) by
John C. Walsh, who made a small splash with his completely charming
1996 Sundance film "Ed's Next Move." The two films share Walsh's
unmistakable sensibility, a gentle and unforced way of examining the
vagaries of human behavior that is as sure-handed and insightful as
it is understated.</TE>
<TE>   Casting is key in films like this, and both Donovan, last seen in
Christopher Nolan's "Insomnia," and the Tony Award-winning Parker are
just what's needed for their respective roles. Parker's intelligent,
confident performance is especially noteworthy because she gave it
during the day while appearing on Broadway in "Proof" at night.</TE>
<TE>   Parker plays Toni Edelman, an aspiring screenwriter who lives in
the same building as the handsome plumber. They connect for a single
night, but her chagrin at actually getting involved with someone so
menial stings him so much that he decides to take corrective action
and leave the invisible serving class behind.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of RJ (Kevin Carroll), a casting director friend who
owes him money, and some script pages he purloins from an
unsuspecting Toni, David sets himself up as a director looking for
actors and promptly develops a crush on tyro actress Marliss Funt
(Rebecca Gayheart). Against all reason, and partly fueled by the
rumor that Robert Redford is a silent producer, David's movie (also
called "Pipe Dream") becomes quite the hot property, as does David,
even though he's such a naif that he thinks questions about
representation have to do with whose congressional district he lives
in. Naturally, Toni gets wind of all this, and no end of
complications ensue.</TE>
<TE>   "Pipe Dream" manages to be funny about numerous aspects of
moviemaking, from agentry to craft services, without losing track of
its core notion that it's who you are as a person, not your position
in the pecking order, that finally counts. Even glamorous directors
could do worse than take that to heart.</TE>

<LD>"Real Women Have Curves" teams appealing newcomer America Ferrera and
beloved veteran Lupe Ontiveros in a mother-daughter tug-of-war,
alternately painful and funny, set in the warm embrace of East L.A.'s
Boyle Heights. It marks a winning directorial debut for Patricia
Cardoso, who gracefully brings to the screen George LaVoo and
Josefina Lopez's adaptation of Lopez's popular 1990 play. In a
beguiling instance of perceiving the universal in the particular,
"Real Women," winner of the audience award at Sundance this year, has
built-in crossover appeal for anyone who either pulled himself or
herself up by the bootstraps or dealt with weight issues--or both.</LD>
<TE>   Ferrera's beautiful but plump Ana, however, doesn't see herself as
having a weight problem, even if her mother, Carmen, reminds her of
it continually, seeing it as a barrier to landing a husband. But then
Ana and Carmen don't see eye to eye on anything. The bright and
ambitious Ana has somehow finagled admission to Beverly Hills High
School, where she is a senior, and struck up a friendship with a
wealthy classmate (Brian Sites). Her English teacher (George Lopez)
has encouraged her to apply for college and scholarships, but Ana's
family is dead set against it, insisting that it's more important for
her to help out her older sister, Estela (Ingrid Oliu), with her
struggling garment factory, where Carmen works as a seamstress.
Estela's father (Jorge Cervera Jr.) reasons that once Estela has her
business on a firm footing--hardly a certainty--then Ana can think
about college. Outvoted, Ana submits to her family's united front.</TE>
<TE>   It's at Estela's factory that "Real Women" cuts to the heart of
the matter, which is the impact the free-thinking Ana and the
tradition-minded Latinas she works with have on each other. Stuck
with ironing the assembled garments, Ana is brought face to face with
the sweatshop conditions Estela and Carmen and their co-workers
endure to make a living. Ana is appalled to hear that Estela receives
as little as $18 for a beautiful evening gown that will sell at
Bloomingdale's for $600. Ana sees the value in helping out the
resilient but sometimes intimidated Estela, who has real designing
talent worth nurturing. At the same time, she becomes increasingly
determined to escape the grinding factory existence yet is steeped in
the Latino tradition of family solidarity.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ana and Carmen keep each other in a constant state of
exasperation at home and at work. Carmen at heart is surely a loving
mother only wanting what she thinks is best for her younger daughter,
but she is demeaning and shamelessly manipulating Ana. If Carmen
weren't so funny in her superstitions and outrageous tactics, she
would surely seem a monster. This is a wonderful role for an actress
of the skill and stature of Ontiveros, whose innate warmth is crucial
in maintaining Carmen's humanity. Most important, the role of Carmen
is major and allows us to see what Ontiveros has always been
throughout all those maid roles--at least 150 by her own count:
America's own Anna Magnani, an actress of such star personality,
skill and talent that she intuitively selects the revealing gesture,
and holds the pause or the glance or inflection just the right length
of time. Yet Ontiveros could not seem more spontaneous and natural;
Indeed, it takes conscious effort to uncover and track the art of her
self-disguising technique.</TE>
<TE>   Ontiveros' radiant presence sparks a screen full of terrific
performances, above all, Ferrera's multifaceted portrayal of the
conflicted Ana, who ultimately has a liberating effect on her
co-workers, her mother seemingly excepted. There are plot
developments here and there that are a bit of a stretch, and the
distaff semi-"Full Monty" moment that gives the film its title
probably plays more credibly on stage than screen, for all its lovely
exuberance. Even so, "Real Women Have Curves" is honest and wise
enough to strike the right bittersweet note.</TE>

<HD>Chilling 'Ring' stops just short of horror</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We've all had the experience of seeing a videotape we're sorry we
watched, of wishing we could go back in time and take those unhappy
images out of our minds. It's like that for the characters in the
supernatural thriller "The Ring," only worse. A whole lot worse.</LD>
<LD>   "Have you heard about this tape that kills you when you watch it?"
a bored teenage girl (the movies recognize no other kind) asks her
friend Katie in the opening scene. "When it's over, the phone rings
and someone says, 'You will die in seven days.' " The girl giggles
and then notices something. Katie isn't giggling.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, friends, Katie has watched this particular tape (which begins
with the image of a ring) and has received that very phone call, and
no good will come of any of it -- for her or for anyone else. Within
scant minutes, the prophecy is fulfilled and the story of that deadly
video kicks into a higher gear.</LD>
<TE>   "The Ring" does the best it can with this splendid premise, one of
the creepiest, spookiest notions in years. It came from Japan, where
novelist Koji Suzuki wrote the original book, and the film that
resulted was such a sensation that it inspired a sequel and a
prequel.</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks acquired the remake rights and, perhaps not
surprisingly, gave Ehren Kruger's efficient script to director Gore
Verbinski, a solid generalist who previously made "Mouse Hunt" and
"The Mexican" for the studio.</TE>
<TE>   Verbinski is a bit of a rarity these days -- someone who, as his
credits show, can be counted on to do a reliable job in a variety of
genres. (Which is probably why DreamWorks also used him to spell
Simon Wells when the latter faced exhaustion during the making of
"The Time Machine.")</TE>
<TE>   Having someone like Verbinski in charge of "The Ring" means that
while the premise and his competence ensure that the film will be
unnerving, things could be scarier still if a director who lived only
to chill the blood was behind the camera.</TE>
<TE>   It's not only Katie, as it turns out, who saw the tape; three of
her young friends watched it with her and they all died at precisely
the same time exactly one week later. This unsettling coincidence
catches the eye of Katie's aunt, crack newspaper reporter and single
mom Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), who's already been asked by her
sister to figure out what's going on.</TE>
<TE>   Also affected by Katie's death is her cousin, Rachel's young son,
Aidan (David Dorfman), a solemn, spooky little person who has "I see
dead people" written all over him.</TE>
<TE>   Ever the intrepid reporter, Rachel traces the tape to the sinister
Shelter Mountain Inn and, being a fearless modern person, watches the
video (which has something of the look of a bad student film) for
herself.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, things start to happen that convince Rachel this tape
is for real. She contacts her video whiz friend Noah (Martin
Henderson) and is astonished and chilled to learn that this tape in
effect has no fingerprints, no clues as to where it was made.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel perseveres, and her discoveries, which end up involving --
among other elements -- dead horses, a lighthouse, a mental hospital
and potent cameos by Brian Cox and Jane Alexander, culminate in a
clever enough ending.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ring's" shrewd premise is fueled not only by the omnipresence
of video copies that turn up in our lives from who knows where, but
also by a particularly modern feeling of powerlessness, by a sense
that forces out of our control have a profound and unhappy effect on
our lives.</TE>
<TE>   One of the keys to making "The Ring" work as well as it does is
the strong performance by Watts, who came to prominence with her dual
role in David Lynch's "Mulholland Drive." It's up to her to lend
credibility to this strange scenario, and her presence succeeds in
making us believe.</TE>
<TE>   Helped as well by the foggy atmosphere of its Pacific Northwest
setting, "The Ring" is certainly acceptable. But no one seeing it is
going to feel as spooked as executive producer Roy Lee, the man who
introduced the film to DreamWorks, did when he first saw the Japanese
version. He was so scared, he told a reporter, that he simply turned
off the movie, and more than once.</TE>
<TE>   To make an audience feel that intensely, you need a different kind
of director and a different kind of film.</TE>

<HD>In homage to defiant French filmmakers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bertrand Tavernier's superb "Safe Conduct" ("Laissez-Passer") is an
engrossing homage to those French filmmakers who, during the
occupation, managed to maintain their integrity and professionalism
under the most repressive circumstances.</LD>
<LD>   At once intimate drama and stirring historical epic, the film is
loaded with suspense, for its central figure, an assistant director
named Jean Devaivre (Jacques Gamblin), displays the same
unflappability on the set as in his Resistance activities.</LD>
<LD>   Tavernier drew his richly detailed and shrewdly observed account
of grace under pressure -- and greedy collaborationist opportunism as
well -- from the reminiscences of Devaivre and the late Jean
Aurenche, whose career was revived when Tavernier chose the veteran
screenwriter to help him launch his own career in the 1970s.</LD>
<TE>   Jean Cosmos, another veteran, not only collaborated with Tavernier
on the script for "Safe Conduct," but also contributed to their
script incidents from his experiences as a young man living in Paris
during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Because Tavernier has always been as passionate a film historian
as he is a filmmaker, "Safe Conduct" has an acutely authentic sense
of time and place. Devaivre was a champion cyclist, which comes in
handy more than once, and has an athlete's resilience, which is put
to the test when he reluctantly accepts a job at the German-run
Continental Films. As a Resistance member, however, Devaivre will
gain a measure of protection as a Continental employee and possible
intelligence-gathering opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Devaivre is first assigned to work with the important pioneer
director Maurice Tourneur (Philippe Morier-Genoud), who after a long
and innovative sojourn in the U.S. had in the mid-'20s returned to
France with his American wife.</TE>
<TE>   There's a pleasing contrast between the sober Devaivre and the
rumpled, fun-loving, woman-chasing Aurenche (Denis Podalydes), who is
forever moving from place to place, his possessions packed into two
battered suitcases. But he is as resolved as Devaivre that he will
contribute nothing to German propaganda through films. As we meet a
raft of characters -- there are 139 speaking parts -- "Safe Conduct"
builds tension as Devaivre's Resistance activities expose him to
increasing danger and jaw-dropping adventure.</TE>
<TE>   With production designer Emile Ghigo's vividly evoked Paris under
the occupation and Valerie Pozzo di Borgo's accurate costumes, this
film brims over with the humanity, seriousness, good humor and
commitment that mark all of Tavernier's work.</TE>
<TE>   "Safe Conduct" is crammed with incident, and bristles with passion
and energy. Tavernier treats his actors, every last one of them
impressive, as an ensemble, and they are continually being required
to shift moods abruptly in response to the tremendous danger and
uncertainty of the times, a period between 1942 and 1944 when an
ultimate Allied victory was far from assured, and when France's Jews
were transported or driven into hiding.</TE>

<LD>The AFI Fest 2002, to be held next month, will feature 134 films from
around the world, including 48 U.S. debuts and six world premieres.</LD>
<LD>   The films, selected from among 2,080 entries, represent works from
internationally known directors such as Korea's Im Kwon-Taek, Spain's
Pedro Almodovar, and England's Ken Loach as well as efforts by
lesser-known first- and second-time directors.</LD>
<LD>   Fifty-six selections will compete in three international
categories: feature, documentary and shorts. Asian, European, Latin
and American features will screen in noncompetitive categories. A
"Made in Germany" program will also be presented along with four
special screenings.</LD>
<TE>   The festival, to be held Nov. 7-17 at the ArcLight Hollywood, is
aimed at reflecting the diversity of Los Angeles as well as
representing voices and visions from 37 different countries,
according to director Christian Gaines.</TE>
<TE>   "We strive to be a thorough festival of record for international
cinema in order to make better films at home in the film capital of
the world," Gaines said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's especially important, more now than ever, to look to our
counterparts abroad and learn from them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the highlights include Korean master Im Kwon-Taek's
"Chihwaseon," a film chronicling the life of an artist; "Spider," a
film directed by David Cronenberg and starring Ralph Fiennes about a
man overcoming a traumatic event early in his life; and two films by
Australian Phillip Noyce, "Rabbit Proof Fence" and "The Quiet
American."</TE>
<TE>   Other highly anticipated screenings will include: "Blind Spot:
Hitler's Secretary," a documentary by Austrians Andre Heller and
Othmar Schmiderer about the woman who served when she was 22 as the
personal secretary to Adolf Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   The festival will open with the U.S. premiere of "Antwone Fisher,"
a film about the inner troubles of a grown foster-care child, marking
the directorial debut of actor Denzel Washington, who also stars in
the film. It will close with Almodovar's "Talk to Her," a drama
centering on a nurse who cares for two coma patients. The U.S.
premiere of Canadian writer-director Atom Egoyan's "Ararat," about
the 1915 Armenian genocide, will be held at the festival's
Centerpiece Gala on Nov. 12.</TE>
<TE>   The festival will also honor actor Michael Caine with a tribute
hosted by critic Leonard Maltin. Six of the actor's films will be
shown Nov. 11-13 at the Skirball Cultural Center. Caine also stars in
"The Quiet American," to be shown Nov. 17 at the ArcLight.</TE>
<TE>   The festival will be headquartered for the first time at ArcLight,
at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street in Hollywood.
Entertainment and live music will be presented in the ArcLight
courtyard, while the films will be shown in five screening rooms
upstairs. A "cinema lounge" will be dedicated for filmmakers and
pass-holders.</TE>
<TE>   Jury awards will be presented Nov. 15 at a private party and
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets for the festival go on sale today. More information may be
obtained by calling (866) AFI-FEST or visiting the festival Web site
at www.AFI.com.</TE>

<HD>'Mound Builders' is worth all the talk</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>F. Kathleen Foley;DAVID C. NICHOLS;--PHILIP BRANDES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lanford Wilson's "The Mound Builders," now at the Open Fist, is one
of the playwright's strongest works, a discursive yet pointed drama
that only occasionally lapses into the self-conscious chatter to
which Wilson is prone.</LD>
<TE>   A multiple Obie winner in the mid-1970s, the play has been
infrequently produced in recent years. Now director Martin Bedoian
and his superlative cast give local audiences the chance to see it
done to a fine turn. The plot, which flashes back and forth in time,
concerns a summer excavation of an ancient Indian village -- an
undertaking made all the more complicated by the new dam nearby that
is causing the valley to slowly fill with water. When they're not off
at the nearby dig, the chief archeologists, professor August Howe
(Bart Tangredi) and his assistant, Dan Loggins (Kevin T. McCarthy),
are sequestered in a nearby cabin (Donna Marquet's convincingly
ramshackle set). Also in residence are Howe's wife, Cynthia (Hope
Shapiro), their daughter Kirsten (Mary Ann Springer) and Dan's
pregnant wife, Jean (Amy Watt), a gynecologist on leave from her
practice. Under Howe's dispassionate eye, Cynthia has been carrying
on a brazen affair with Chad Jasker (Ryan Honey), the local youth
whose father owns the land where the excavation is taking place. Chad
is romantically obsessed with Jean while at the same time nursing a
covert homosexual attraction for her husband. When Howe's famous
sister, D.K. (Jennifer Pennington), is toted onto the scene in a
state of alcoholic collapse, the emotional round robin is given
vertiginous new momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Before the inevitable topple into tragedy, we are privy to
fiercely intelligent interactions, far-ranging conversation, cultural
clashes and frustrated romantic yearning, with a bracing dose of
female bonding thrown in for good measure. Under Bedoian's firm
guidance, the funny, fiercely intelligent performers glide over their
occasionally long-winded exchanges with style and grace.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mound Builders," Open Fist Theatre, 1625 N. La Brea Ave.,
Hollywood. Fridays-</TE>
<TE>   Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Nov. 16. $15. (323)

<TE>   Multiple plot lines snarl in 'Cotillion'</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Sirk meets Radclyffe Hall in "Cotillion," playing at the
Renberg Theater as part of the Edge of the World Festival. This Lucid
by Proxy production of Jeanette Scherrer's coming-of-age play has an
interesting premise; its content is another coming-out party
altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Set in 1957 Alabama, Scherrer's plot centers on 18-year-old Becky
Teasdale (Shannon Nelson). Her recently remarried father is
perpetually away on business, leaving his daughter in the uneasy care
of her socially minded stepmother, Mae Belle (Tina Gloss).</TE>
<TE>   Mae Belle distracts herself from spousal neglect and stepchild
indifference by focusing on the upcoming debutantes' ball. Becky is
reluctant to attend, though wealthy neighbor Johnny (Robert Porch) is
mad to be her escort.</TE>
<TE>   Childhood confidante Nattie (Sarah Culberson), daughter of the
Teasdales' housekeeper, Celie (Kila Kitu), thinks Becky the luckiest
girl in town. Meanwhile, Becky secretly carries a torch for Johnny's
sister, Cassandra (Sara Weller).</TE>
<TE>   Scherrer's direction elicits good work from her actors, with the
wide-eyed Nelson especially fresh casting. However, the script's
cramped narrative line defeats the multiple plot convolutions, with
the racial intolerance thread almost a different play.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict resolution between Mae Belle and Celie, for all of
Gloss and Kitu's talent, plays out like an "ABC Afterschool Special,"
while Weller's bad girl is a compendium of cliches. Something special
lurks within "Cotillion," but it requires serious rewriting to fully
emerge.</TE>
<TE>   "Cotillion," Renberg Theater, L.A. Gay &amp; Lesbian Center, the
Village at Ed Gould Plaza, 1125 N. McCadden Place, Hollywood.
Saturday, 2 p.m.; Oct. 26, 8 p.m. Ends Oct. 26. $15. (818) 786-2229.

<TE>   'Supreme Being': Don't analyze this</TE>
<TE>   Perched at the outer edge of EdgeFest 2002, "Supreme Being" at
Stages Theatre Center affords a rare local opportunity to enter avant
theater figure Richard Foreman's idiosyncratic ontological-hysteric
zone, at the intersection of metaphysics and paranoia.</TE>
<TE>   Conventional expectations of plot, character and realism are best
checked at the door. Foreman's signature method is to construct
pieces out of his daily written musings, unedited and with no
predetermined assignment of words to individual characters.
Structure, such as it is, surfaces in the rehearsal process, building
on the text's resonances in the performers.</TE>
<TE>   Tanya Kane-Perry, who has worked with Foreman as actor and
director, set out to preserve the integrity of that process in
staging "Supreme Being," which is assembled from Foreman's voluminous
notes (many of which are downloadable from www.ontological.com). In a
surreal limbo called the Radio Hotel, five women intone, sing and
puzzle over the curious lines that seem to pop spontaneously from
their lips -- hotel existence as a form of self-discovery. Carla Melo
spends most of the piece lounging in a cube frame. Zeljka Gortinski
mines witty reactions to the diverse assortment of poles she's stuck
with, Mari Garcia lip-syncs salsa tunes in a hula skirt, and Naomi
Azar flits about the stage like Ariel on angel dust.</TE>
<TE>   Among "Supreme Being's" cerebral conundrums are "Let's suppose
that consciousness is a way of lying about the world"; "I talk to
myself, which means I don't have to move my lips"; "The food that
enters the mouth mirrors the mind"; "Hunger is something you should
consider an obligation"; and "Ready ... set ... don't think."</TE>
<TE>   That latter is particularly good advice. Rational analysis will
only get you in trouble here. Far better to let the text and images
wash over you, and allow meaning to emerge from the show's
recombinant associations and repetitions -- not unlike the music of
Steve Reich, in which the listener extracts patterns from a series of
notes constantly shifting in and out of phase with one another
(Reich's "Desert Music" is even used at one point).</TE>
<TE>   Like all Foreman pieces, this one will never be remounted, but the
lines could be recycled in fortune cookies for a Mensa party or a
mental ward -- I'm not sure which.</TE>
<TE>   "Supreme Being," Stages Theatre Center, 1540 N. McCadden Place,
Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 11 p.m. (additional 4 p.m. show this
Saturday); Sundays, 1 and 8 p.m.; Ends Nov. 3. $12. (323) 465-1010.
Running time: 1 hour, 5 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   'AmeriKafka' in need of a pruning</TE>
<TE>   "AmeriKafka," Ken Prestininzi's world-premiere play at the MET, is
a disappointingly haphazard exercise inspired by the life and
writings of Franz Kafka. The action is set in Prague in 1924, the
"threshold moment" just before Kafka's early death from tuberculosis.
As Kafka (Silas Weir Mitchell) gasps his last, we are privy to his
disjointed dying thoughts, a hallucinatory reverie that takes us back
and forth in time and in and out of reality.</TE>
<TE>   The freewheeling plot vacillates between loosely adapted scenes
from "Amerika," Kafka's early, unfinished picaresque novel about an
Eastern European youth's bizarre experiences in the promised land of
America, and incidents from Kafka's life, with particular emphasis on
his friendship with Itzhak Lowy (David Razowsky), a prominent
director and actor on Prague's Yiddish theater scene.</TE>
<TE>   Within that framework, director Loren Rubin, acclaimed for last
season's production of "The Master and Margarita" at the Zoo
District, attempts a sweeping and ambitious staging, complete with
dance and song sequences, live klezmer music (a highlight) and
complicated design elements. Certainly, Kafka's highly visual and
wildly inventive writing lends itself to dramatization, as countless
other theatrical adaptations have proved. But Rubin's direction seems
oddly flat, the play philosophically muddled, the actors ill-equipped
to handle the vocal requirements of the original songs by music
director Brenda Varda and Beth Bergman.</TE>
<TE>   Using surrealism as a springboard, Prestininzi tries to make the
leap from the prosaic to the profound, employing events from Kafka's
admittedly uneventful life to make grandiose statements about
American decadence, the Nazi scourge and the indispensable role of
the theater in Jewish culture. Perhaps with a lot more stagecraft and
a little more pruning -- particularly of those painfully atonal
musical interludes -- he can yet make his case.</TE>
<TE>   "AmeriKafka," MET Theatre, 1089 N. Oxford Ave., Hollywood.
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends Nov. 17. $20. (323)

<DH>The story so far: Harley has decided what he wants to draw
for his first homework assignment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Louise Downer</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's finally homework time. I take out a sheet of construction paper
and my box of crayons and get to work.</LD>
<LD>   I use a yellow crayon to draw a circle in the upper corner of my
paper for the sun. I make yellow triangles jutting out to show it is
shining. I use a gray crayon to draw some round, fluffy clouds.</LD>
<LD>   On the upper left side of my paper I draw a big green circle with
a long brown stretched-out square underneath. It turns out to be a
pretty-good-looking tree. I make orange circles for fruit and make
two blue circles, one larger for the body and one smaller for the
head. Once I add a triangle to the head for a beak and another on the
body for a tail, it becomes a little blue bird. I give it a round
brown nest so it has a place to sleep. Below the tree I scratch lines
with a green crayon to show grass.</LD>
<TE>   Finally I draw Gramma.</TE>
<TE>   She's in her garden, so I draw lots of flowers with round pink and
purple petals and spiky triangles for leaves.</TE>
<TE>   Gramma is easy to draw. Her head is round, and so is her face. I
draw a circle for her body above her waist and a bigger one for her
shape below. Stretched-out circles make her arms and legs. I use a
black crayon to make a half-circle for her smile and two small
circles above it for her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Since I am showing Gramma doing what she likes to do best, she is
planting little round seeds in little round holes.</TE>
<TE>   Already, I've used nine colors. Mrs. Arturo will like that. In the
bottom corner of the paper, I use a red crayon to write my name.
Below my name I draw a circle and a square to show I can draw
anything.</TE>

<HD>Salonen plays up the drama of Shostakovich's ominous Sixth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"What does it mean?" one member of the Los Angeles Philharmonic
audience was heard asking after Esa-Pekka Salonen finished conducting
a striking, important performance of Shostakovich's Sixth Symphony on
Wednesday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. It's an excellent
question.</LD>
<LD>   What it doesn't mean is actually a lot easier to answer. Although
claiming to express the moods of "spring, joy, youth, lyricism,"
Shostakovich began with a slow and bleak 20-minute first movement.
Next comes a short and sarcastic dance movement, and finally a brisk,
ferocious march that concludes the symphony with a vulgar flourish of
show business. The year was 1939, and in Comrade Stalin's Soviet
Union, all was wrong with the world.</LD>
<LD>   In recordings by Yvgeny Mvravinsky, who premiered the work with
the Leningrad Philharmonic, you sense the immediate drama of the
times, of the rush to war. Leonard Bernstein, in his late, perversely
drawn-out but overpowering performances, treated the Sixth as if it
revealed life to be an enormous cosmic joke.</LD>
<TE>   Under Salonen there are new things to be heard. Bringing out all
that is momentous and lonely in the first movement, he put
Shostakovich's startling solos -- the piercing distant scream of a
piccolo, the haunting lament of the horn, the deathly, distant
trumpets, the eerie glow of the celesta -- under a cold, but clearly
illuminating light.</TE>
<TE>   The thrusting drama he then brought to the two shorter movements
proved extraordinarily compelling. He made it seem as though
Shostakovich was saying that we'd suffered all we could bear, and as
he watched war fever spread, it was time for grotesque celebration, a
chilling but irresistible dance of death.</TE>
<TE>   Context meant a great deal to this performance. Saving the Fourth
and Fifth for later in the season, Salonen has leapt forward in his
five-year Shostakovich "plan," which began with the first three
symphonies last season, all of which are full of genuine youthful
enthusiasm and Leninist optimism. This Shostakovich, a decade later,
having withstood Stalin's withering criticism, is not broken, but no
longer whole.</TE>
<TE>   But more immediate in making that point was the contrast with the
music of the first half of Wednesday's concert, which included
Ravel's "Le Tombeau de Couperin" and Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 17,
K. 453, music that tells us all is right with the world.</TE>
<TE>   Mozart's concerto was written by a 28-year-old composer brimming
with life, fresh ideas flowing from a inexhaustible creative source.
Peter Serkin was the elegantly fluid soloist, and at times in his
lovely performance, Mozart almost seemed to be playing the pianist
rather than the other way around.</TE>
<TE>   In the opening orchestral tutti, for instance, Serkin silently
played along with the orchestra, his fingers touching the keys as
lightly as a feather. When the piano sound finally arrived with the
first solo passage, it was as graceful and natural as a bird taking
flight.</TE>
<TE>   Also right with the world was Ravel's loving tribute to Couperin
and, more important, to French music, which Salonen conducted as
burbling, refreshing chamber music, the Philharmonic winds in
exquisite shape.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Philharmonic, all around, is in excellent shape. Some
Russian members have become vocal critics of their music director in
their native repertory -- to judge from the accents of the anonymous
phone calls to The Times -- but say this for them and for Salonen,
they give him all the brilliance he asks for.</TE>
<TE>   On their own, four Philharmonic string players offered a bland, if
well-played pre-concert performance of Shostakovich's Sixth String
Quartet, a reading pleasant enough on the surface but that made
little impact amid the comings and goings in the Grand Hall.</TE>

<HD>All buildup, no payoff in disappointing psychological
thriller</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Abandon" is a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the
audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with
suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the
viewers home. The trouble with this well-worn approach to suspense is
that all the while the filmmakers are upping the ante for themselves,
generating expectations that they can't deliver on.</LD>
<LD>   That's what has happened to writer Stephen Gaghan, an Oscar winner
for his crackling "Traffic" script making his directorial debut here.
"Abandon" is all buildup and no payoff, a mystery that essentially
offers only two alternative solutions, which diminishes the element
of surprise and strings the viewer along way past caring which
possibility proves to be true.</LD>
<LD>   Agatha Christie always gave us myriad possibilities for solving a
crime; Alfred Hitchcock said that true suspense is generated by
letting the audience in on what's up and keeping the protagonists in
the dark and in increasing peril. Either approach of these masters of
suspense could have better set off this film's portrait of a young
woman, Katie Burke (Katie Holmes), a college senior under pressure to
wrap up her thesis and prepare for finals while vying for a big-time
job in the world of high finance.</LD>
<TE>   Not helping matters is that she is contacted by police Detective
Wade Handler (Benjamin Bratt) about a renewed investigation of the
disappearance of her wealthy boyfriend, Embry Larkin (Charlie Hunnam,
the underage gay in the original English version of "Queer as Folk.")
two years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface Katie would seem to be the girl who has it all --
and all under control: looks, personality, intelligence and drive,
but she is an up-by-her-bootstraps individual who has struggled hard
to better herself and her opportunities. A tall, tousled blond and a
brilliant iconoclast in the arts, Embry swept Katie off her feet only
to let her down with a thud when he disappeared. Never knowing
whether he met foul play or merely dropped out, Katie, who has not
since dated, pulled herself together by pouring all her energies into
her studies and pursuing career goals.</TE>
<TE>   Now, at the worst possible moment, she is flooded with painful
memories. Then she begins to catch glimpses of Embry back on campus:
Has he actually reappeared or is he but a figment of Katie's
imagination? In the meantime considerable empathy gradually develops
between Katie and Wade, who is getting a second chance at his police
career after having been derailed by what he calls "extreme substance
abuse."</TE>
<TE>   Amid a flurry of fast forwards and flashbacks, "Abandon" proves to
be more contrived than inspired and therefore unable to make fresh
its venerable men-are-such-beasts sentiments. However, Holmes, a
"Dawson's Creek" regular with a burgeoning big-screen career, shows
she can handle a large, demanding part. The droll Zooey Deschanel
lends a welcome light touch, but the film does Bratt no favors.
Having turned in an electrifying, Oscar-caliber performance in
"Pinero," he would be well-advised to avoid sketchy supporting roles
like Handler.</TE>

<HD>Brady's new line: talk-show host who listens a little too
well</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Sachs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If those mysterious TV king-makers ever tried to assemble the perfect
talk-show host in their laboratory high in the Hollywood Hills, the
resulting entity might come out looking an awful lot like Wayne
Brady.</LD>
<LD>   At the tender age of 30, the Florida native is already a veteran
of the stand-up comedy circuit, his improv skills have earned him a
pair of Emmy nominations as a member of the "Whose Line Is It
Anyway?" troupe, and he can sing better than 99% of the popified
poseurs on today's Top 40 list.</LD>
<LD>   Throw in his smooth good looks, sure stage presence and the
effortless warmth he projects with guests and audience members alike,
and Brady would seem to be a talk talent of monstrous proportions.</LD>
<TE>   The buzz has been so strong that even when the weekly prime-time
variety show he helmed last year for ABC ran aground, it was blamed
on time-slot problems and other vagaries of the business, and so a
new project, a syndicated daily talk show, was launched Sept. 2.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that "The Wayne Brady Show," which airs here
weekdays at 10 a.m. on KCAL, seems to be a good fit for the host, and
executive producing pros Robert Morton and Bernie Brillstein are on
hand to oversee the show's direction and ongoing fine-tuning.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Sundance Kid, Brady seems most on target when he's on the
move, using his quicksilver wit while prowling the stage in loosely
constructed bits that allow for improvisation. Behind the host's
desk, however, he can become too good a listener, failing to rein in
guests whose anecdotes wander into nowheresville.</TE>
<TE>   It's a daily high-wire act, but I don't think Wayne Brady would
have it any other way.</TE>

<HD>'Pipe' filmmaker's real experiences led to his faux
director</HD>
<DH>Treated deferentially after just one movie, John Walsh
based his next feature on how preconceptions can alter behavior.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rachel Uslan</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Walsh is still processing the last few years of his life, the
ones that took him from aspiring writer-director to writer-director
verite. After years of making a film "out of bubble gum and spit,"
his debut, "Ed's Next Move," was picked up for distribution in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   It was surreal, Walsh, 40, recalls, as he, a "Joe Schmo struggling
to get a movie made, suddenly had people acting like I was a
director." The reverent way he was treated -- during casting
sessions, at film festivals, by old friends -- struck him profoundly,
and out of his desire to explore what he calls "perception
categories," his second feature, "Pipe Dream," was born.</LD>
<LD>   Walsh's new film, which opens today, centers on David, a plumber
who has become increasingly convinced that people only see him as his
job. "I'm the serving class. I'm invisible," David (Martin Donovan)
explains to his friend RJ (Kevin Carroll), a casting director.</LD>
<TE>   Walsh and co-author Cynthia Kaplan, herself an actress-writer,
know of what David speaks. Over the years, Walsh has been a busboy,
bellhop and waiter, and Kaplan, a waitress. Donovan, too, worked as a
drapery installer "for longer than I care to admit," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I've ridden up a lot of service elevators. I've been there. Most
people were nice, but I can clearly see where David is coming from,"
Donovan says.</TE>
<TE>   In the film, David's mood has been exacerbated by a woman, his
neighbor Toni (Mary-Louise Parker). After a drunken yet tender
one-night stand, David awakens to hear Toni on the phone whispering
to a friend, "I don't know where my brain was. He's a plumber."</TE>
<TE>   Wounded, David visits RJ at work, where he is briefly mistaken for
a director. Floored by the winning look he receives from an
attractive actress, David basks in her incorrect perception until RJ
breaks the spell. With that, David's mind is set. He's going to pose
as a director at a fake casting session that RJ will set up. He'll
barely speak; people will just assume he's deep in thought. For a
script, he'll steal from Toni, a corporate video writer with her own
pipe dream of selling a screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   David's deception succeeds, but not in the way he expects. Toni's
script turns out to be a find, and both the project and its
inscrutable director become buzz words overnight. With the help of
Toni, who sees an opportunity and offers Cyrano-type directions to
David through a headset, the ruse perceived as a film actually
becomes a film.</TE>
<TE>   As "Pipe Dream" unfolds, Walsh and Kaplan introduce several
variations on their theme: the power of people's perceptions. At the
center are David and Toni, dragging their feet toward affection in
the tradition of the romantic-comedy genre. Inspired by such
directors as Howard Hawks, George Cukor and Preston Sturges, Walsh
and Kaplan aimed at what kept their films timeless.</TE>
<TE>   "The great romantic comedies really do have something to say about
people, society and relationships," Walsh says. "Comedy is going to
have much more resonance if there are real social issues underlying
the comic situations."</TE>
<TE>   Walsh admits some people read "Pipe Dream" and "didn't quite get
it," particularly its elements of farce. "If you do something that's
a throwback to an older style, they don't know quite how to take it,"
he says.</TE>

<HD>'Flower Drum' merely pleasant in N.Y.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Winer</AU>
<BD>Newsday</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In the 44 years since "Flower Drum Song" was a Broadway hit, the show
has been dismissed as an inconsequential musical comedy with
ravishing songs by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II and Asian
American characters almost as stereotyped as they were foreign to the
form.</LD>
<LD>   A radically rewritten "Flower Drum Song" opened Thursday night at
the Virginia Theatre. The songs -- including "You Are Beautiful" and
"Love, Look Away" -- are as gorgeous as ever. The show has a
completely new book by David Henry Hwang, author of "M. Butterfly"
and "Golden Child." His work here is merely pleasant when we yearn
for the wonderful.</LD>
<LD>   There is no sin in pleasant, certainly, but it is shameful that
there has been no second musical about Asian Americans in almost half
a century. Hwang, with his acute antennae for cultural contradictions
and his smart way with indignation, might still create the important
new musical that brings their multilayered narrative to a broad
audience. Short of that, if anyone could rescue this flawed but
charming project from the small shelf of Rodgers and Hammerstein
castoffs, Hwang would seem to be the man.</LD>
<TE>   He has come up with a new story into which to thread the
ready-made songs -- a technique that has more similarities to the
"Mamma Mia!" trick than he and his serious creative team might like
to admit. For all the thought that has gone into a reported six-year
gestation and a successful run at the Mark Taper Forum in Los
Angeles, however, the modest production superimposes a
paint-by-number show-biz quality on the clash-of-cultures
generational story.</TE>
<TE>   Mei-Li, the new immigrant in San Francisco's Chinatown, has been
made a political refugee instead of the mail-order bride from the
original musical, based on the novel by C.Y. Lee. When played with
the lyric purity, pluck and knowing stillness of Lea Salonga -- best
known as Miss Saigon herself -- the character has an honesty that
makes us overlook the more awkward, even ludicrous, developments
around her.</TE>
<TE>   The brightest new idea is to center almost all of the 1960 story
in the Golden Pearl Theater, where first-generation immigrants are
failing to find an audience for their classic Peking Opera. One night
a week, Wang (Randall Duk Kim), a star in the pre-Mao old country,
reluctantly turns over the run-down theater to his son Ta (Jose
Llana) for a Chinese burlesque. Before long, the old theater has been
converted into a popular nightclub. Thus, most of the songs become
source material in a backstage culture-clash musical -- always a
graceful way to reconcile stories in which people sing and dance.</TE>
<TE>   The cast is first-rate and Robert Longbottom, late of the serious
"Side Show," finds ample opportunity to run with the
campy-extravaganza sensibility of his off-Broadway hit "Pageant." But
we feel knocked around by the flip-flopping styles, which begin with
a generic, knee-jerk cartoon scene of Communist Chinese oppression
before getting comfortable with fabulous club numbers that slyly mock
stereotypes and enjoy them. In "Chop Suey" the cheesecakey,
fresh-off-the-boat dancers swan around wearing takeout containers.</TE>
<TE>   Most disturbing is a first-act change in Wang's character, from
bitter, proud traditionalist to vaudeville hotshot, that should have
audiences suing for emotional whiplash. Kim, so impressive in
Shakespeare throughout a rich career, is not just saddled with having
to make an impossible personality switch seem natural. He also is
given the worst of Hwang's lame attempts at Broadway jokes --
including "I expect women to walk six paces behind me, except when we
walk into traffic."</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Allen lives up to Nancy Kwan's star turn as Linda Low, the
stunning nightclub singer who may, someday, realize the downside of
assimilation. Allen has a wicked time with "I Enjoy Being a Girl."</TE>
<TE>   Llana's usually strong crooner voice hinted at a head cold at
Tuesday's preview, but he brings a poignant sensitivity to the
questing young Chinese male. And he sings "You Are Beautiful" to
Mei-Li with all the sweetness and ardor of passionate ambivalence.</TE>

<LD>Kahn and Selesnick's entrancing new series of photographs, "City of
Salt," clearly isn't set in the present or in the immediate vicinity.
But the stories it tells in words and pictures are familiar. Using
the intensified language of myth, the work chronicles the eternal
human quest for the secrets of existence, the treasures of the Earth,
power, and glory. These ends remain, of course, elusive. That mixed
blessing, fundamental to the story of humankind and its aspirations,
invests Kahn and Selesnick's stagy work with real poignancy.</LD>
<LD>   Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick have worked together for more
than a decade as photographic storytellers. Their previous work in
L.A. was an elaborate, sepia-toned historical fiction that presented
itself, coyly, as documentary evidence of a mid-20th century
expedition. The new series, of which only a part is shown here, sheds
the pretense of being old while still adopting a tone and a look
vaguely from the past.</LD>
<TE>   The images are panoramic (most are 8 inches high and about 3 feet
wide), digital laser prints in pale, muted tones. Even without
regarding the companion texts, the pictures read as epic in nature,
full of travelers on lonely, heroic journeys. In one image, a man
surfaces in a small, isolated pond. With just his head above water,
he blows into a long, curved horn (identified in the text as the
"trumpet of creation"). In another, men in slightly old-fashioned
business attire writhe upon marshy ground, presided over by a
daunting, helmeted demon, each of his four arms clasping a weapon.
The photographs don't cohere into a single narrative, but are bound
by consistent flavor and imagery: pelts, turbans, and a landscape of
sand and bog, relentless in its expanse.</TE>
<TE>   Like the moralistic photographic tableaux of 19th century
photographer Oscar Rejlander, Kahn and Selesnick's work is threaded
through with lessons. "City of Salt," both the series and the
individual photograph by that title, are meditations on the power of
illusion and desire, the vanity of our pursuits, and the lure of the
forbidden. The city pictured is a dense accretion of small domed and
spiral-topped structures built on a ground of gritty white salt. It
was built, so the story goes, by a king who intended it to be his
funerary monument, but he visits the place one night and loses his
bearings. Is he dead, he wonders? Is this what he wanted, he asks
himself, bringing the parable home, to wander for eternity in a city
of his own illusions?</TE>

<TE>   Spinning stories in our minds</TE>
<TE>   In the back room at Rose Gallery hangs a game in pictures, devised
by British photographer Martin Parr. It consists of two sets of
portraits, one of young women, and the other of young men. For the
original version of the game Parr made in 1972, he pasted these
pictures onto wooden blocks, "Love Cubes," that were then supposed to
be paired according to who might go with whom.</TE>
<TE>   What do we have to go by in this guessing game? Just what's
revealed by the appearances of these men and women: their clothing,
hairstyle and posture. From there, our minds spin narratives. A third
set of photographs hanging here shows the couples paired off, so we
can check the accuracy of our presumptions.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of this mildly amusing, mildly discomfiting show contains
work from different series of the past 30 years, all of it operating
on the same premise: How people present themselves is key in
revealing who they are -- and is entertaining, to boot.</TE>
<TE>   This is especially true of Parr's 1992 photographs, "Signs of the
Times," which are stills from a television series about the
relationship people have with their domestic interiors. Captions
drive home the point that Parr had little interest in such
relationships if they were healthy, caring only if they were absurd,
laughable, pathetic. In one photograph, for instance, a woman appears
seated on her couch in an interior busy with competing patterns. Her
quote: "When I looked at the wallpaper and the wallpaper looked at me
we instantly fell in love."</TE>
<TE>   Parr shoots in a cool, straightforward manner, allowing the
vulgarities of middle-class taste to reveal themselves as obvious. He
certainly mocks his subjects, and he can be mercilessly acute. What
passes as humanism in his work is more of a condescending sympathy
for the aesthetically challenged.</TE>
<TE>   Parr shares this turf with Americans Garry Winogrand, Bill Owens
and others, but he's been the dominant snide voice in Britain since
the '70s. A series of images made in Ireland in the early '80s tweaks
the crisp, dispassionate style of New Topographic photography by
adding a visual punch line. One picture shows a suburban house viewed
straight-on. In the foreground stands a plaster poodle -- fearsome
sentinel guarding the gate. His "Last Resort" shots of seaside
tourists in New Brighton elicit a louder snort. Several of them here
focus on food: sour-faced customers at a grungy snack counter, kids
whose ice cream cones drip like glue over their hands and legs.
Parr's images of people eating expose us most starkly for what we
are: animals presuming a higher rung on the evolutionary ladder.</TE>

<TE>   Images on brink of disintegration</TE>
<TE>   The tenuousness in Patrick Graham's work is not easy at first to
embrace. His images feel on the brink -- not of crystallization but
of disintegration. The paper is torn; the words are smudged; the
thoughts, when legible, express doubt, fear, vulnerability. Slowly,
slowly, it sinks in that Graham's gently tortured surfaces are apt
analogues of emotional experience. Indeterminacy is the broad
foundation from which we operate, punctuated by peaks of clarity and
valleys of impossibility and despair.</TE>
<TE>   Graham's extraordinary work at Jack Rutberg Fine Arts is a diary
of the struggle of its own making. Although there are large,
vigorously worked canvases here as well, Graham's mixed-media works
on paper prevail in both number and impact. Each is a layered thing,
made of blue-gray drawing paper, usually torn and often wrinkled,
adhered to a larger surface of mat board. Graham writes, draws and
paints on both surfaces, sometimes attaching other notes and scraps.</TE>
<TE>   These works on paper chronicle the artist's challenges and
concerns in rendering meaning out of what's given in art and life. In
one piece, he has written what appears to be these words across torn
strips of lined notebook paper, then smeared them to
near-illegibility: "all this stuff comes in and without coding or
analysing it, it [plays?] for and against my wish, desire ... longing
to make something beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the "stuff" that Graham processes in his work is art
historical. Interpretations of the odalisque recur here, echoing
Ingres' lovely image but also spinning off into coarser, more animal
forms. Representations of religious subjects thread their way through
the work as well, from the Pieta to the Resurrection. Graham's
personal history is more "stuff" he's had to contend with, from his
early facility as a draftsman -- which imposed on him the concomitant
burden of potential -- to his troubles with alcohol, and his
reckoning with the conditions of politics and faith in his native
Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   He had to let go his "glossy gifts," as he once called his
technical skills, before he could pursue deeper truths in his work.
External likeness is of little consequence in work as interior as
Graham's. He is after something more elusive, and reaches it: an
ability, through minimal, graceful means, to render the body's
fluidity, its weight when dead, and its lightness when lifted by
wings and divine breath.</TE>

<TE>   Periscopic view bends reality</TE>
<TE>   "Being Ernest Shackleton" is a clever installation that begins
with the Antarctic explorer as its theme, but ends up with more to
say about the dynamics of theatrical illusion and the power of
mediated reality. Collaborators Jim Ovelmen and Mark Jones have built
a stage set of sorts on the roof of London Street Projects. A ship's
mast, a winch and jagged-edged Styrofoam panels transform the rooftop
into a scene evocative of Shackleton's harrowing expedition.</TE>
<TE>   But it's the translation of this humble mess into a seamless video
image that does the trick. Ovelmen and Jones have mounted a video
camera on the roof, atop a thick, gray pole that descends into the
gallery below. The pole's handles allow it to be turned like a
periscope, just short of 360 degrees. Turning it controls the view
the camera sends to a large circular screen on the gallery's back
wall.</TE>
<TE>   The monochrome video image smooths out the installation's rough
edges, homogenizing its textures into one convincing, filmic veneer.
This hardly comes as a revelation in a city famous for putting
glorified reality on screen, but the installation has a playful charm
that enlivens even this familiar transformation.</TE>
<TE>   Also, it's a transformation that we can witness both sides of, by
sneaking a peek of the roof after seeing it on screen, or by shifting
the periscope's view past the contrived set to the edge of the roof
and beyond. The periscope becomes what Ovelmen calls a "legitimized
peephole" for the permission it grants us to survey distant, exotic
worlds at our private leisure.</TE>

<HD>Southwest Ekes Out Modest Profit</HD>
<DH>Three other airlines post third-quarter losses amid slump.
Delta plans to shed 8,000 more jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three more airlines posted third-quarter losses, totaling $114
million, while low-fare leader Southwest Airlines Co. again eked out
a modest profit amid a grim travel slump. But even Southwest said
Thursday that it might suffer its first loss in a decade during the
current quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Delta Air Lines Inc. further underlined the industry's gloomy
state by saying it would shed as many as 8,000 more jobs, or about
10% of its work force, as the carrier scrambles to slash costs in the
face of weak revenue. Delta, with 76,000 employees as of Sept. 30,
this week posted a third-quarter loss of $326 million and had planned
to eliminate 1,500 flight attendant jobs.</LD>
<LD>   Northwest Airlines Corp. reported a third-quarter loss of $46
million, or 55 cents a share; Continental Airlines Inc. lost $37
million, or 58 cents; and America West Holdings Corp. said it lost
$31 million, or 92 cents.</LD>
<TE>   Southwest -- the largest airline in California and the only major
carrier to stay in the black since the Sept. 11 attacks -- said
third-quarter profit was $74.9 million, or 9 cents a share, down 50%
from $151 million, or 19 cents, a year earlier. But the latest
quarter included $48 million that was the last installment of
Southwest's share of the $5 billion given to the industry by a
post-Sept. 11 federal bailout.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest shares rose $1.18 to close at $14.48 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The airlines warned that conditions show no sign of improving, and
Dallas-based Southwest said it couldn't predict whether it would turn
a profit in the three months ending Dec. 31. The last time Southwest
lost money was in the first quarter of 1991, during the Persian Gulf
War.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest and the other carriers also said a U.S. war with Iraq
would be another devastating blow to travel and their financial
health. "It's going to be catastrophic for us" unless the U.S.
government immediately arranged more aid for the carriers, said
Continental Chairman Gordon Bethune.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, lackluster travel demand is preventing the airlines from
hiking fares to narrow their losses. "The world is on sale today for
the holiday period" surrounding this Thanksgiving and Christmas, said
Tim Griffin, Northwest's executive vice president for marketing.</TE>
<TE>   So the carriers are relying on cost cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Delta plans to eliminate 7,000 to 8,000 jobs -- including
management positions -- and said it hopes that most will occur with
voluntary retirement programs. But if they are not enough,
"involuntary furloughs will be necessary," Delta Chairman Leo Mullin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest said it is still planning to grow in spite of the weak
market. The airline, which mostly flies trips of under 1,000 miles,
is starting another transcontinental flight between San Jose and
Baltimore on Jan. 12. Southwest added the flight after seeing its new
Los Angeles-Baltimore service get off "to a tremendous start," Gary
Kelly, Southwest's chief financial officer, said in a call with
analysts.</TE>

<HD>For Enron's Belden, 'Success Bred Power'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks and Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Timothy N. Belden got out of college around 1990, he found
himself entering an arena that couldn't have been sleepier.</LD>
<LD>   He joined Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a research
operation backed by the Energy Department, where he was a utility
policy analyst who wrote detailed studies on the most arcane
subjects. Among the many reports he co-authored was the abstruse
"Theory and Practice of Decoupling."</LD>
<LD>   A decade or so later, however, Belden found himself in a very
different world as head of Western electricity trading for Enron
Corp.</LD>
<TE>   The Houston-based company was then the biggest and most aggressive
player in a field that had become incredibly fast-paced and
high-stakes in the wake of the deregulation of energy markets in
California and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Belden had evolved from an idealistic,
environmentally conscious policy wonk to the quintessential Enron
company man: smart, innovative and aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the 35-year-old Belden paid the price for going too
far with that aggressiveness. He pleaded guilty to a single count of
conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with illicit trading
tactics during California's 2000-01 energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "I did it because I was trying to maximize profit for Enron,"
Belden told a federal judge in San Francisco. He agreed to cooperate
in the continuing investigation and pay back $2.1 million in
ill-gotten gains.</TE>
<TE>   Those who've known Belden for a long time were left trying to make
sense of how a person they considered supremely trustworthy had
gotten caught up in a huge corporate scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the most decent person I know in the whole energy industry
-- bar none," said Steve Stoft, an energy consultant who hired Belden
at the Lawrence Berkeley lab.</TE>
<TE>   Stoft fondly remembered his friend's passion for the environment,
noting how Belden had once bought into a windmill company "because he
wanted to invest in alternative energy."</TE>
<TE>   But as the years passed, and Belden abandoned his life as a
researcher to go to Portland General Electric Co. and then Enron, he
seemed to become interested in a different sort of power: his own.</TE>
<TE>   One energy consultant who worked with Enron in its glory days
remembers Belden as "sufficiently smart and sufficiently intimidating
to call his own shots. In that culture, success bred power."</TE>
<TE>   At Enron, Belden was at the nerve center of a vast operation that
bought and sold electricity around the clock. About 100 traders
worked in constant activity under Belden on the high-tech trading
floor that Enron occupied in the World Trade Center in Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Deal after deal was lined up for the next month, week, day -- or
even minute -- with the Golden State's official markets, the
California Power Exchange and California Independent System Operator,
or with traders from the dozens of other energy companies operating
in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Belden and his lieutenants -- some of whom now are scrambling to
cut their own plea agreements with prosecutors -- were particularly
talented at playing one market off another or at wringing payments
out of Cal-ISO to relieve congestion on the transmission grid,
internal Enron memos show. Frequently, Enron's traders created the
electron traffic jams they were then paid to fix, the documents
indicate.</TE>
<TE>   This year, a state Senate committee investigating alleged energy
market manipulation by Enron and other companies received five
compact discs containing Belden's e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   In one e-mail on May 12, 2000, just 10 days before electricity
prices first spiked, Belden sent a tantalizing message to another
Enron executive in Houston:</TE>
<TE>   "We long. Pricing keep going up. So far so good."</TE>

<HD>As Stocks Surge, so Do Bond Yields, Signaling Market
Reversal, Some Say</HD>
<DH>A further spike could hurt investors who have poured into
bond funds this year, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is the bull market for Treasury bonds over?</LD>
<LD>   That's what a growing number of investors and portfolio managers
are wondering as yields on government debt have surged in the last
week while stocks have rallied. Thursday, the yield on the benchmark
10-year T-note leaped to 4.2% from 4.05% the day before. Since Oct.
9, it has surged from a generational low of 3.57%.</LD>
<LD>   "We probably saw the inflection point last week," said Richard
Hoey, chief investment strategist at Dreyfus Corp., who believes
stocks are likely to outperform Treasury bonds over the next year or
two, reversing the trend of recent years.</LD>
<TE>   That could sting investors who have piled into bond mutual funds
in record numbers this year, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "What the bond market is telling you is that the irrational 'fear
premium' is starting to exit," said Bill Hornbarger at A.G. Edwards &amp;
Sons in St. Louis. "People need to be very careful because bonds as
an asset class look very rich right now."</TE>
<TE>   Among big bond funds, Pimco Total Return has lost 1.5% since Oct.
9 and Vanguard Total Bond Market has lost 1.8%, according to
Bloomberg News, offering a taste of what can happen when bond yields
reverse course suddenly.</TE>
<TE>   Bond yields have risen as investors shift money out of
low-yielding Treasury securities and into stocks, helping Wall Street
post big gains over the last week. In addition, with the U.S. economy
still growing, hopes are fading for another Federal Reserve interest
rate cut this year.</TE>
<TE>   Many institutional investors such as CalPERS, the giant California
public pension fund, are shifting their asset allocations away from
bonds and into stocks or "alternative investments" such as venture
capital, rebalancing their portfolios in light of the powerful run
for bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Even billionaire Warren Buffett is rumored to be shifting money
from bonds to stocks, according to published reports.</TE>
<TE>   The fear is not about the safety of interest payments or principal
repayment because there is no question the government will make good
on what it owes. But if rates continue backing up, the market value
of Treasury securities bought at recent prices and yields would
plunge. That could mean losses for investors forced to sell before
the securities mature, or for investors holding bond mutual funds
loaded with Treasuries.</TE>
<TE>   A further spike in yields also would pull interest rates higher,
affecting consumer and corporate borrowers. It could slow the flurry
of mortgage refinancing that has helped bolster consumer spending.
However, it could provide some relief for savers bedeviled by low
returns on money market accounts and other savings vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Still, although many strategists believe the U.S. economy is
recovering, the data remain mixed, and there is no assurance that the
stock market surge has staying power. In the fourth quarter of 2001,
bond yields rose even more during the stock market's "head fake"
rally -- until it fizzled in early January. Newport Beach-based
Pimco, for one, believes stocks "are still in an overall bear
market," said portfolio manager Mark Kiesel.</TE>
<TE>   Mideast tensions and the potential for rising energy prices are
among the factors that could derail stocks, analysts say. If the U.S.
slips back into recession, Treasury yields probably will fall again,
and bond total returns -- interest plus price appreciation -- would
be all the more likely to score their third straight winning year
over stocks.</TE>
<TE>   That winning streak has pulled huge sums into fixed-income
investments. Bond funds took in a net $104 billion this year through
August, compared with the record $88 billion for all of last year,
based on the latest official data.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the popularity of fixed-income funds, some investors agree
with the pros, saying it may be too late to jump on the bond
bandwagon.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't want to go into bonds right now," said Greg Orloff, a
retired consultant from Santa Monica. "It's the kind of thing where
you say, 'I wish I would've been there for the ride, but now is not a
good time.' "</TE>
<TE>   Analysts applaud investors who are using bonds to diversify their
portfolios. But they say performance chasers could get burned, just
like those who piled into tech stocks 2 1/2 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "In the late 1990s stock investors came to expect 15% per year and
they got a rude awakening," said Scott Berry, an analyst at
Morningstar Inc. "Hopefully the same thing doesn't happen with the
bond market."</TE>

<HD>Banks Beat Forecasts Amid Growth</HD>

<LD>The companies that operate Union Bank, World Savings and California
Federal Bank reported higher earnings Thursday despite the struggling
economy, as low interest rates drove demand for mortgages, deposits
increased and no new lending problems surfaced.</LD>
<LD>   * Union Bank's parent, UnionBanCal Corp., earned $138.2 million,
or 88 cents per share, for the quarter that ended Sept. 30, up 10.5%
from $125.1 million, or 79 cents per share, in the same period a year
earlier. Revenue for the San Francisco-based bank rose 4.2%, from
$552 million to $575.1 million. Troubled loans decreased despite what
Chief Executive Norimichi Kanari called "challenging business
conditions."</LD>
<LD>   * CalFed's parent, Golden State Bancorp Inc., earned $128 million,
or 88 cents per share, for the quarter that ended Sept. 30, up 24%
from $103.3 million, or 72 cents per share, in the third quarter of
2001. The San Francisco-based savings and loan is in the process of
merging with Citigroup Inc.</LD>
<TE>   * World Saving's parent, Golden West Financial Corp. in Oakland,
earned $244.5 million, or $1.56 per share, for the quarter that ended
Sept. 30, up 18.8% from $205.8 million, or $1.28 per share, in the
same quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose from $471.4 million to
$553.5 million, a gain of 17.4%. Chairman Herbert M. Sandler
attributed the higher profit to growth in mortgages, plus a wider
spread between the interest rates Golden West earns on loans and the
rates it pays to depositors.</TE>
<TE>   All three companies beat analysts' expectations for earnings, and
their stocks, which all trade on the New York Stock Exchange, rose:
Golden West was up $2.39 to $68.27; Golden State Bancorp rose $1.16
to $35.67; and UnionBanCal gained $1.50 to $42.10.</TE>
<TE>   That helped boost shares in other California banks and thrifts
including Downey Financial Corp. and City National Corp., both of
which had fallen on Wednesday after less rosy earnings reports.</TE>

<HD>Cox Radio Rejects Payola-Like Practice</HD>
<DH>The station chain owner will stop accepting fees from
independent record promoters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cox Radio Inc., one of the nation's largest radio chains, plans to
sever its ties with independent record promoters to distance itself
from a payola-like practice rampant in the music business.</LD>
<LD>   The decision makes Cox the first big broadcaster to revolt against
the record labels' three-decade-old practice of hiring independent
"middlemen" to push songs to radio programmers. Critics say the
promoters' existing deals with major radio companies smack of payola,
or undisclosed payments made in exchange for airplay.</LD>
<LD>   "We felt uncomfortable with these relationships because the system
does invite abuse," said Robert Neil, Cox Radio's chief executive.
"The record companies have been trying to get people to play records
in different ways for a long time. The more we found out about this,
the less comfortable we became."</LD>
<TE>   Cox will not renew contracts with record promoters whose contracts
have expired in recent weeks, Neil said, and will end its remaining
promotional contracts as they expire during the next year.
Independent promoters, including Jeff McClusky and Jerry Brenner,
currently have deals with 14 of Cox's pop, rap and rock music
stations and pay Cox an estimated $1 million a year in "promotional"
fees.</TE>
<TE>   McClusky and Brenner could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta-based Cox, a unit of Cox Enterprises Inc., runs 79 radio
stations, with major outlets in Miami, Long Island, N.Y., and across
the South. It ranks seventh nationally in the number of stations owed
but is third in sales.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time a major radio company took this step," said Peter
Hart, an analyst with watchdog organization Fairness &amp; Accuracy in
Reporting. "Cox is making a wise decision....But this is only the
first step. This practice still demands a congressional
investigation. Other companies won't take the same step without
pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Radio scandals in the 1950s prompted the passage of the federal
anti-payola statute, which prohibits radio stations from accepting
money for playing songs unless they disclose it to listeners. Record
labels have gone to great lengths to avoid such sponsorship tags and
have backed independent promoters since the early 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   The five major record conglomerates now spend about $100 million a
year on independent promoters to influence radio airplay. Promoters
attempt to sidestep the anti-payola law by paying radio stations
annual fees -- often exceeding $100,000 -- that they say are not tied
to airplay of specific songs. In return, stations give promoters
advance copies of playlists. Promoters then bill record labels for
each new song that gets played.</TE>
<TE>   "They're paying you $100,000 a year just to know what your adds
[newly added songs] are? Why is that of value to them? It makes no
sense unless they feel they have some influence on their individual
records," Neil said. "If somebody put you in front of a congressional
committee and asked you to explain this, would you want to do that?"</TE>
<TE>   This year, record industry officials called for a federal
investigation into the radio business, saying independent promoters
often violated the law and stifled new music getting airtime.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.) has introduced legislation to
ban the practice. In the last three years, the Justice Department has
reviewed complaints about cash payments allegedly made to programmers
at urban stations, and obtained payola-related tax convictions
against several record label and radio executives in the Latin music
field.</TE>
<TE>   Hilary Rosen, chief of the Recording Industry Assn. of America,
applauded Cox's move, saying, "I'm sure regulators will look
favorably on this."</TE>
<TE>   Record executives also criticize Clear Channel Communications, the
nation's biggest radio broadcaster with 1,200 stations, and Radio
One, the largest chain catering to African American audiences, for
requiring record labels to pay designated promoters to pitch songs to
their stations.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel could not be reached for comment late Thursday. In
the past, the company has said its promotion deals are legal. This
year, a Radio One executive said her company would be "crazy not to
try to tap into" the millions of dollars labels spent on independent
promotion by authorizing a single promoter to represent the company.</TE>
<TE>   Neil, a 43-year-old former program director, said Cox decided
"it's not worth it to sacrifice your ethics for that bit of money.
This is a way to show you're going to be responsible in a world where
people sometimes aren't responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Even after independent promoters lose their contracts with Cox
stations, Neil said, record executives could directly offer money,
travel packages or other bribes to station personnel. But he
downplayed the idea that his programmers would be swayed: "We have a
level of ethics and integrity at our urban, top 40 and rock stations
such that I have a level of confidence it won't happen."</TE>

<HD>EBay Profit Up 224% on Rise in Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Colker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Online auctioneer EBay Inc. said Thursday that its third-quarter net
income rose 224% over last year, indicating that the public's desire
to bid on everything from used CDs to luxury cars has not yet topped
out.</LD>
<LD>   The San Jose-based company earned a record $61 million, or 21
cents a share, for the period ended Sept. 30, up from $18.8 million,
or 7 cents a share, a year ago. Unlike the vast majority of Internet
companies, EBay has been profitable every quarter since it went
public in September 1998.</LD>
<LD>   The report came as no surprise -- analysts polled by Thomson First
Call had expected earnings of 20 cents a share.</LD>
<TE>   The company said its revenue, derived almost entirely from fees
paid by sellers who auction merchandise on the site, was $288.8
million, compared with $194.4 million a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Meg Whitman attributed the site's success to its
small scale and individual sellers who have turned to EBay "in this
difficult retail climate, or perhaps because of it."</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call to analysts, she cited growth in several of
the site's auction categories, including the EBay motors division,
which offers cars and motorcycles. She said the site gives
individuals a national platform on which to sell vehicles, increasing
the chance they will get higher prices.</TE>
<TE>   "We make inefficient markets efficient," Whitman said.</TE>
<TE>   The total value of completed EBay auctions and fixed-price sales,
which recently were added to the site, was $3.77 billion for the
quarter, an increase of 60% over last year.</TE>
<TE>   EBay shares rose 17 cents to $58.15 in regular Nasdaq trading
before the results were announced. The shares dipped as low as about
$56.50 in after-hours trading.</TE>

<HD>KPWR to Reveal Ties to Rapper</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chuck Philips</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>KPWR-FM decided Thursday to inform listeners about its business ties
to rap act Shade Sheist -- whose music the station has played more
than any other broadcaster in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   The move follows an article this week in The Times disclosing that
Sheist's music is produced by a senior executive at KPWR-FM and
released by Baby Ree Entertainment, a company financed by Emmis
Communications Corp., the Indianapolis-based radio conglomerate that
owns KPWR-FM.</LD>
<LD>   Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting called KPWR's heavy airplay of
Sheist's music a "dramatic" conflict of interest -- an allegation the
company denied.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, Emmis radio President Rick Cummings said the radio
chain had no legal obligation to disclose the business arrangement,
but decided to begin airing Sheist's music along with an
identification tag in an effort to eliminate confusion.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intention here is to go one step further to be above
reproach," said Cummings. "We're going to air disclosure, if it makes
people feel better. We don't have to. We see this as an extra effort
to try to separate church and state for the audience."</TE>
<TE>   Cummings said Emmis had consulted with Federal Communications
Commission attorneys about the arrangement and followed their advice
before airing Sheist's music. That's why, Cummings said, the company
barred executive Damion Young from discussing Sheist's music during
KPWR's weekly programming meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Cummings said the only reason KPWR played Sheist's music was
because it continued to rate high in listener tests.</TE>
<TE>   "Our job is to get ratings -- and KPWR is No. 1," Cummings said.
"You don't get to that place by making programming decisions that
don't benefit your audience," Cummings said. "[Sheist's] record is
testing this week in the top 10 among our listeners. The audience
wants to hear it. That's the only reason Power 106 plays it."</TE>

<HD>Intertainer Shutters the Show -- for Now</HD>
<DH>The video-on-demand firm wants to have a working model for
its deal with movie studios.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intertainer Inc., a pioneering Culver City video-on-demand company,
won't be entertaining anyone for a while.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Jonathan Taplin announced Thursday that
Intertainer would suspend its operations Oct. 23.</LD>
<LD>   "We plan to take the site down until we can work out a fair
business model" with the movie studios owned by AOL Time Warner, Sony
and Vivendi Universal, which Intertainer has sued for antitrust
violations, Taplin said in a message posted on Intertainer's Web
site.</LD>
<TE>   Financed by such corporate heavyweights as Sony, Intel Corp. and
Comcast Corp., Intertainer developed one of the first services
delivering entertainment on demand to TV sets and computers. Using
technology from another investor -- Microsoft Corp. -- it transmitted
copy-protected movies securely through digital cable systems or
high-speed Internet services.</TE>
<TE>   The company spent millions acquiring movies from leading studios,
amassing the largest library of its kind on the Internet. But its
relationships with Sony Pictures, Warner Bros. and Universal Studios
soured over the last two years, and the number of films in its
library dropped precipitously.</TE>
<TE>   Intertainer blames its Hollywood suppliers for its troubles. Some
of its competitors, however, blame Intertainer for spending too much
at a time when the potential market is small and demand is weak.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Intertainer filed an antitrust lawsuit against the
three media firms and Movielink, an online movie service they created
with two other major Hollywood studios, Paramount and MGM. It also
has supported an antitrust investigation that the Justice Department
has launched of Movielink and the studios' licensing practices.</TE>
<TE>   Taplin said the company decided to suspend operations because "we
realize that this lawsuit might take longer than we originally
thought -- like, two or three years." He added, "The fact that the
studios asked for a delay in their initial response to the [lawsuit]
gives us some intimation that they're going to try to draw this out
forever."</TE>
<TE>   Intertainer had raised $120 million in six years, mainly from its
corporate benefactors, Taplin said. It now has less than $1 million
left in the bank.</TE>
<TE>   The company plans to let go about 12 of its 18 workers.</TE>
<TE>   The company boasted 147,000 registered users, but it lost money on
every movie customers ordered. "The smartest thing to do," Taplin
said, "is to try to get the business model right, then come back into
business....</TE>
<TE>   "Our backers are willing to back something that makes sense
economically," he said. But the current deals, which require
Intertainer to pay guarantees of $1 million or more to the major
studios, serve mainly to keep Intertainer from competing with
Movielink, Taplin contended.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the studios being sued by Intertainer declined
to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Intertainer's problems with several of the studios began when it
tried to make its service widely available over the Internet, instead
of limiting it to selected cable systems and high-speed phone lines.
The studios claim that Intertainer's move violated its contracts, but
Taplin said they were just stalling to help Movielink.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Moskovits, co-founder of rival MovieFlix.com, said
Intertainer was done in by its own ambition.</TE>
<TE>   "They collapsed under the weight of these deals," said Moskovits,
whose company has yet to strike any deals with major studios. "These
deals were supposed to make them the biggest, the baddest, the best
... [but] there just wasn't the demand to do that."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Moskovits said, the shortage of high-speed Internet
connections and the Net's technological shortcomings prevent
companies from delivering a high-quality video-on-demand service to
the masses. "It's going to get better some day," he said, "but it's
not there yet."</TE>

<HD>Upbeat Profit News Helps Lift Stocks</HD>
<DH>The Dow rises 239 points, wiping out Wednesday's drop. IBM
helps raise investor confidence with its strong earnings report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another wave of positive earnings news from companies such as IBM
propelled stocks higher Thursday, giving Wall Street its fifth
advance in six sessions. The Dow Jones industrials jumped 239 points,
bringing its recent advance to just shy of 1,000 points.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said investors were becoming more optimistic after a week
of good news from companies ranging from General Electric to Advanced
Micro Devices. A belief that stocks were oversold, after hitting
multiyear lows last week, is adding to the good mood, despite
Wednesday's steep decline</LD>
<LD>   "I think economy-wise the worst days have passed," said Stuart
Freeman, chief equity strategist for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons. "We are
very likely in a phase where stocks are catching up from the
bottoming of the economy several quarters ago."</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 239.01 points, or 3%, to
close at 8,275.04, more than wiping out Wednesday's drop of 220
points. Since hitting a five-year low Oct. 9, the Dow has surged
988.77 points. The Nasdaq composite index rose 39.87 points, or 3.2%,
to 1,272.29. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index gained 19.18 points, or
2.2%, to 879.20.</TE>
<TE>   Winners beat losers by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq in active trading.</TE>
<TE>   IBM rose $7.30, or 11.3%, to $72.20. After the closing bell
Wednesday, the technology giant reported third-quarter earnings that
beat analysts' expectations by 3 cents a share and reaffirmed its
fourth-quarter outlook, prompting a Merrill Lynch stock upgrade.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft rose 36 cents to $50.77 ahead of its fiscal
first-quarter earnings report. After the market closed, the software
giant reported earnings that beat analysts' estimates by 7 cents a
share. In after-hours trading, Microsoft climbed more than 4%.</TE>
<TE>   Investors took heart from a government report Thursday showing
housing construction rebounding strongly in September to a 16-year
high, and shook off two other surveys indicating a dip in industrial
production and a jump in jobless claims.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors have only been responding to the negative numbers. Now,
eyes are being open to the positive numbers," Freeman said. "What
happens at major turns in markets is that investors' responses to
some of the negative numbers become less dramatic."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Wednesday's pullback was expected after a four-day
rally helped end six straight weeks of sell-offs. They remained
hopeful that the market could continue its advance with more
third-quarter earnings reports, which overall are expected to beat
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the confidence is coming back, the accounting scandals
are past us, the banks are reporting better-than-expected results and
the balance sheets are slowly being cleaned up," said Jason R.
Graybill, senior portfolio manager and managing director at Abner,
Herrman &amp; Brock Asset Management.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts acknowledged lingering uncertainties about the
strength of the economic recovery as well as a possible war with
Iraq. Wednesday's selling intensified after President Bush signed a
resolution allowing him to use force against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the bottom from last week ... is really going to be the
lows in the markets. But we don't see a runaway on the upside,"
Graybill said.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   * Investors continued to pull money out of the bond market. The
yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose for a sixth
straight session, closing at 4.20%, up from 4.05%.</TE>
<TE>   * Advanced Micro Devices jumped 84 cents, or 24.1%, to $4.33,
after the computer microprocessor maker said it expected sales to
improve significantly in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   * Eastman Kodak rose $2.09 to $32.44 after the film company raised
its third-quarter outlook, citing improved performance.</TE>
<TE>   * Nokia gained $1.60 to $16.60 after the cell phone maker reported
an unexpectedly large rise in third-quarter profit.</TE>
<TE>   * Losers included Sears, which fell $10.80, or 31.8%, to $23.15,
after reporting a 26% decline in third-quarter earnings that missed
analysts' expectations. The retailer also reduced its outlook for the
rest of the year, citing uncollectable credit card debt.</TE>
<TE>   * Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average finished 0.8% higher. In
Europe, France's CAC-40 rose 3.8%, Britain's FTSE 100 gained 2.8%,

<HD>Shares of Mattel Soar 18% on Strong Bounce in Earnings</HD>
<DH>But the toy maker's chief executive sounds a note of
caution about the fourth quarter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Abigail Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mattel Inc.'s net income grew 40% in the third quarter, driven by
strong gains in international toy sales and modest domestic
improvements, the company said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The El Segundo-based toy maker's stock rose more than 18% on the
news, its biggest one-day gain in 15 years. Mattel closed up $2.93 to
$18.73 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls and Matchbox cars, reported net
income of $280.6 million, or 63 cents a share, for the three months
ended Sept. 30. That's up from $199.8 million, or 46 cents a share,
during the same period a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   Earnings in the most recent period included a $5.5-million pretax
charge related to Mattel's ongoing financial realignment and a
one-time gain of $27.3 million, a payment from Gores Technology
Group's liquidation of Mattel's former Learning Co. division, which
Mattel took over last year.</TE>
<TE>   Sales for the quarter grew 6% to $1.67 billion, from $1.58 billion
a year ago. While U.S. sales grew 2%, international sales rose 17%,
the company's ninth straight quarter of sales gains abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Mattel's upswing this year, Chief Executive Robert Eckert
warned that the shaky economy and disruption at West Coast ports
could weigh heavily on the company's performance in the critical
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We are making progress toward achieving our goals, but we are
also experiencing some major challenges domestically," Eckert told
analysts in a conference call before the market's open. "Last year we
were faced with the devastating effects that the events of Sept. 11
had on the economy and consumer confidence. This year it has been an
uncertain stock market, the threat of impending war and finally the
unfolding drama of the West Coast port dispute."</TE>
<TE>   Eckert said Mattel has $75 million to $100 million in inventory
stalled on ships off the coast of California. How long that will take
and the cost to the company, he said, is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the problems at the ports and with the economy, Sean
McGowan, a toy industry analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison in New
York, said he expected flat to modestly higher results for Mattel's
fourth quarter. He said he was pleasantly surprised by Thursday's
report and the longer-term outlook.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to find something to be concerned about in these
numbers," McGowan said. "They seem to have taken a lot of steps to
get themselves a better cost structure so that when the shipments are
there, they will be very profitable."</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Income More Than Doubles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph Menn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. profit more than doubled in the fiscal first quarter
as the biggest software firm forced large customers to accept
unpopular and more costly multiyear licensing deals or risk paying
even more for the future products.</LD>
<LD>   The Redmond, Wash., maker of Windows computer operating systems,
Office productivity software and programs to run servers, e-mail and
databases said earnings rose to $2.73 billion, or 50 cents a share,
from $1.28 billion, or 23 cents, a year earlier. Sales jumped 26% to
a record $7.75 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Without a $291-million charge for impaired investments, the
company would have reported earnings of 55 cents a share in the three
months ended Sept. 30, well above the company's earlier prediction of
42 or 43 cents.</LD>
<TE>   "This truly was an exceptional quarter," said Microsoft Chief
Financial Officer John Connors. "We saw broader customer adoption of
our licensing programs than we anticipated."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's stock rose 36 cents to $50.77 in regular Nasdaq
trading, then shot up to $53.14 in after-hours trading after the
earnings report. The stock has held more of its value than other
technology shares as Microsoft leverages its Windows monopoly in new
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Microsoft was benefiting from unparalleled clout,
execution and comparatively inexpensive offerings as it gets a bigger
share of companies' declining technology spending.</TE>
<TE>   "In about the worst information technology environment in memory,
Microsoft has just powered right through -- and they're only getting
stronger," said Banc of America Securities analyst Robert Austrian.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft slightly raised the company's projections for the rest
of the fiscal year. It now expects full-year revenue of $32.2 billion
to $32.6 billion and earnings per share of between $1.89 and $1.95.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft executives cautioned that new licensing deals may
decline in the next two quarters.</TE>

<HD>NASD Charges Irvine Brokerage With Fraud</HD>
<DH>National Capital Securities allegedly touted firms to
investors without saying they risked bankruptcy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Securities regulators charged an Irvine brokerage Thursday with
touting penny stocks to investors even though the companies in
question were flirting with bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   National Capital Securities Inc. issued fraudulent research
reports on 25 companies without telling investors that the firms had
been warned by their auditors that they might go out of business,
according to the complaint by the NASD. The NASD, formerly known as
the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, is the brokerage industry's
self-policing organization.</LD>
<LD>   National Capital, formerly known as Donner Corp. International,
also did not disclose that 15 of the 25 companies, as well as three
dozen others, paid Donner to write the complimentary reports to drum
up investor interest, according to the complaint. It is a violation
of NASD regulations -- as well as federal law -- to receive such
compensation without informing investors.</LD>
<TE>   The complaint also names Donner owner Jeffrey L. Baclet; Vincent
Michael Uberti, an analyst who allegedly wrote many of the reports;
and Paul A. Runyon, an analyst whom the NASD accuses of writing
misleading reports with Uberti after the two men founded another
brokerage.</TE>
<TE>   Uberti declined to comment and Baclet and Runyon couldn't be
reached. Baclet's attorney did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   On its Web site, Donner describes itself as a full-service
brokerage that "is poised to become a true world-class organization."</TE>
<TE>   The Web site also has a religious theme, with biblical quotes
scrolling across its home page and a link to a religious Web site.</TE>
<TE>   From March 1999 to May 2002, Donner published reports with
"fraudulent, exaggerated and unwarranted claims," according to the
complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the reports described the stocks as "highly undervalued"
but did not reveal that the companies had extensive financial
problems, including lack of capital and well-entrenched competitors,
the complaint said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the stocks traded on the over-the-counter Bulletin Board,
an electronic trading venue for companies that don't meet the
financial qualifications for a listing on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the firms surged briefly in late 1999 and early 2000 at
the height of the stock market "bubble" but have since fallen
dramatically and now trade for pennies on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Donner was based in Santa Ana for most of the period covered by
the NASD complaint. The firm recently moved to Irvine but lists its
main address as being in Oklahoma City, according to the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Donner and the individuals charged can request a hearing before an
NASD disciplinary panel to dispute the charges. If the panel rules
against them, they could be fined, suspended or permanently barred
from the financial industry.</TE>

<HD>Northrop Posts Bad News</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trouble in a fighter jet electronics program and at a New Orleans
shipyard swung Northrop Grumman Corp. from a profit to a loss in the
third quarter and sent its shares tumbling 12% on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles-based Northrop, one of the nation's largest defense
contractors, also lowered its outlook for the year and said it
couldn't provide reliable guidance for 2003 because of the
uncertainty of its pension asset returns.</LD>
<LD>   Northrop lost $59 million, or 56 cents a share, in the third
quarter contrasted with a profit of $79 million, or 84 cents, in the
same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 24% to $4.2 billion.</LD>
<TE>   The company also said it expects after-tax losses of $208 million
from its sale of Component Technologies, a commercial electronics
business based in Iselin, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop's loss in the third quarter included an $87-million
pretax charge on its Polar Tanker program, which has been hindered by
high turnover of workers at the Avondale shipyard in New Orleans,
where Northrop builds the giant double-hulled crude oil transports
for the petroleum industry.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop also took a $65-million pretax charge on its contract to
build F-16 fighter jet electronic warfare equipment and fire-control
radar as part of a Lockheed Martin contract to sell the plane to the
United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not happy to have to do this," Kent Kresa, Northrop's
chairman and chief executive, said of the charges.</TE>
<TE>   The charges were partially offset by a $69-million gain from
Northrop exiting a commercial cruise ship project it inherited with
its acquisition of Litton Industries last year and an additional $20
million from a technology contract.</TE>
<TE>   "Our core defense businesses are performing well," Kresa said.</TE>
<TE>   But Wall Street focused on the negatives, pushing Northrop shares
down $13.51 to close at $101.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shortly after the report, Standard &amp; Poor's analyst Robert Friedman
downgraded his assessment of the company's shares from "hold" to
"sell."</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of hope and dreams built into this stock price,"
Friedman said. "The quality of earnings in the defense industry as a
whole is not good."</TE>
<TE>   Northrop also lowered its earnings estimates for the current year
to reflect its discontinued operations and account for the charges.
The company now expects net income of $5.65 to $5.75 per share, down
from an earlier forecast of $6.10 to $6.60.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop won approval Wednesday from the European Union for its
planned $7.8-billion purchase of defense contractor and satellite
builder TRW Inc. U.S. antitrust officials also are expected to
approve the deal, which Northrop says will be completed by year's
end.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Groundbreaking for housing in September hit its highest level since
1986, while industrial output fell for the second straight month, the
government said in reports underscoring the uneven pace of the U.S.
economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Groundbreaking for homes jumped 13.3% last month to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.84 million units, the Commerce Department
said.</LD>
<LD>   Although the housing market remains strong, separate reports
showed that industrial activity during September slackened, and that
the labor market has yet to show signs of big improvement amid
growing uncertainties about the economy and stock market, and
potential attacks against Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   The number of workers lining up for state jobless benefits last
week rose by 22,000, surging well above the key 400,000 mark
economists consider a stalled labor market, the Labor Department
said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the Federal Reserve's latest data showed that
U.S. industrial output fell in September for the second month in a
row, leaving economists with little hope that the labor picture will
improve any time soon.</TE>

<LD>Vivendi Universal's long-suffering investors rallied behind the

<LD>The Treasury Department plans to shut down a tax shelter designed to
generate artificial capital losses through overseas transactions.
Proposed regulations would bar U.S. taxpayers from readjusting the
basis of stock they own by arranging for a partner in a country that
doesn't tax dividends to redeem shares in the same corporation and
treat the proceeds as a dividend.</LD>

<HD>Sun to Cut 4,400 Jobs Amid Loss</HD>
<DH>A second round of layoffs at the maker of computer servers
is expected to hit California hard. Broadcom and Gateway also report
quarterly losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. Huffstutter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sun Microsystems Inc. posted a $111-million quarterly loss Thursday
and announced that it would cut 11% of its worldwide staff, the most
aggressive move yet by a Silicon Valley bellwether to compensate for
lackluster sales by slashing costs.</LD>
<LD>   The layoffs -- which will begin in November and reduce Sun's
full-time staff by 4,400 -- will be supplemented by "widespread" cuts
among the computer maker's temporary and contract employees, said
Chief Financial Officer Stephen McGowan. The company also will shed
excess work space to save $100 million a year.</LD>
<LD>   Such cuts, which are expected to touch every unit and department
of the Santa Clara, Calif.-based firm, will hit California hard:
16,000 of the company's 39,400 employees work in the state. The bulk
of the California workers are based in the Bay Area.</LD>
<TE>   The news marks the second major round of cuts at Sun, which shed
10% of its staff -- or about 3,900 jobs -- a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Sun, which makes computers that manage high-tech networks and Web
sites, said it expects to return to profitability by June, when its
fiscal year ends. Yet executives brushed aside questions by Wall
Street analysts about any expectations for how Sun's business will do
in the immediate future.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so out of the forecasting game," said Chief Executive Scott
McNealy on a somber investor conference call Thursday afternoon. "It
doesn't even make sense."</TE>
<TE>   News of the most recent job cuts came amid Wall Street grumblings
that the company's expenses overwhelmed the computer server maker's
much-shrunk revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Sun's revenue totaled $2.7 billion for its fiscal first quarter,
slipping 7% from the same period a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Though Sun's sales dropped, it narrowed its loss for the three
months ended Sept. 29. The company's net loss of $111 million, or 4
cents a share, was a 38% improvement over the $180 million, or 6
cents a share, that Sun lost in the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   The loss includes special one-time charges tied to equity
investments, previous restructuring charges and tax issues. Excluding
these items, Sun would have lost $78 million, or 2 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Although the layoffs are necessary, they aren't enough to turn
around Sun's finances, Bear Stearns analyst Andrew Neff said. "What's
really the focus going forward is where revenue growth is coming
from," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Industry watchers have criticized Sun's reliance on high-end
proprietary hardware and wonder if the company's recent push into the
free Linux operating system market came too late. The shift is a bid
to stem a drop in sales as users seek less expensive products.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent research report, Merrill Lynch analyst Steve
Milunovich predicted that Sun could become "the Apple of corporate
computing -- cool but less relevant."</TE>
<TE>   Sun's shares rose 19 cents to close at $2.99 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Like Sun, chip maker Broadcom Corp. said Thursday that it would
cut jobs and slash other expenses in a bid to speed up its return to
profitability. The Irvine-based company said it would cut an
unspecified number of jobs as part of a restructuring designed to
focus on its highest-performing businesses and reduce quarterly
expenses 10% to 12% by the end of the year. Broadcom employed 3,067
people at the end of the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The company will move out of less desirable product markets and
review everything from facilities to travel expenses as it cuts
costs, executives said during a conference call. They declined to say
where cuts would be made.</TE>
<TE>   Its net loss was $183.3 million, or 48 cents, for the quarter
ended Sept. 30, compared with a net loss of $1.62 billion, or $6.36,
a year ago. The year-ago quarter included a $1.2-billion write-off
for goodwill from a dozen acquisitions. Revenue was up 36% to $290
million from $214 million.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway Inc., the troubled Poway, Calif.-based personal computer
maker, reported a net loss of $49.7 million, or 15 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $519.7 million, or $1.61 a share, in the same
period a year ago, which included a massive restructuring charge.
Revenue dropped to $1.12 billion from $1.41 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Although sales are expected to improve in the fourth quarter,
Gateway expects its full-year revenue to hit between $4.3 billion and
$4.5 billion -- lower than its earlier estimates of $4.5 billion and
$5 billion.</TE>

<HD>For Teens, Lavish Spending on Clothes Is So Last Week</HD>
<DH>After widespread expansion, retailers are seeing a big
downturn</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslie Earnest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fickle young female consumers have warmed to a surprising new trend:
the closed wallet.</LD>
<LD>   Fad-embracing teens and young women, normally vigorous shoppers
who keep store cash registers ringing even through tough economic
times, have trimmed their spending -- casting a pall over the
specialty apparel business.</LD>
<LD>   In recent months, youth-focused retailers including
California-based companies Wet Seal Inc., Bebe Stores Inc. and
Charlotte Russe Holding Inc. have reported downturns in same-store
sales compared with last year.</LD>
<TE>   Over the last five years, women ages 18 to 24 have boosted their
spending by an average of 7.7% annually, according to NPD
FashionWorld, a business unit of NPD Group, a market research firm in
Port Washington, N.Y. Last year, their spending jumped almost 16%,
even amid an economic slump and the aftermath of terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But this year, that same group of consumers has cut spending by
8%, as of the end of August.</TE>
<TE>   For companies that cater to this niche, several factors are at
play, analysts say. Specialty retailers have expanded aggressively in
recent years, crowding malls with stores such as Rampage, Arden B and
Forever 21. As a result, too many companies are chasing the same
customer.</TE>
<TE>   From 1995 to 2000, 14 teen apparel companies followed by Brian
Tunick, with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., expanded their store count
nearly three times faster than did the specialty retail sector as a
whole.</TE>
<TE>   An even bigger issue may be what's on retailers' shelves these
days. Apparel sellers are peering into a sort of black-hole of
fashion with no hot new trend on the horizon to take the place of
now-waning bohemian styles.</TE>
<TE>   In a downbeat bit of analysis, Joseph Teklits, with Wachovia
Securities Inc., said in a recent report that the bohemian trend may
have "marked a fashion 'bubble' from which consumers will retreat to
anti-fashion for some period -- not a pleasant thought for many teen
retailers."</TE>
<TE>   In many stores, jeans are about the only must-have item in stock,
and most young shoppers already have plenty of jeans in their
closets.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no newness in the products, no fad, no excitement," said
Walter Loeb, an analyst with Loeb Associates and a director of Wet
Seal, which operates the Wet Seal, Arden B and Zutopia chains.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly Jennifer Vinovich, 19, would welcome some new styles.
The Newport Beach resident, who frequents Rampage and Express stores,
said that a dearth of anything eye-catching has led her to spend less
of late than she normally does.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see anything I necessarily want to buy," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At least not at home. In Europe this summer, Vinovich collected
hip-huggers in Nice, France; a lacy spaghetti-strapped top in Paris;
a swimsuit in Florence, Italy; and a trendy little black purse in
Cambridge, England. The prices were right and the styles seemed
"maybe a step ahead of America," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it's a matter of frugality -- not just fashion -- that also is
damping Vinovich's enthusiasm for shopping. Concerns about the
economy, the UC Irvine student admits, have caused her to think more
recently about "saving for the future a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   When specialty apparel companies began their full-fledged charge
after shoppers such as Vinovich a few years ago -- rapidly opening
stores and creating concepts -- no one imagined that young consumers
would start fretting about the economy, let alone trim spending, said
Marshal Cohen, co-president of NPD FashionWorld.</TE>
<TE>   "They never thought it would happen because it hadn't happened in
the past," he said. Young women "were the ones that spent most of
their discretionary income on fashion. But times have changed."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, more and more it looks as though youth apparel companies
face the same troubles that other retailers do -- a rocky employment
market and mounting fear of war.</TE>
<TE>   Negative indicators abound.</TE>
<TE>   Wet Seal, based in Foothill Ranch, has logged a decline in
same-store sales for the last three months. Bebe Stores of Brisbane,
Calif., and Guess Inc. of Los Angeles have registered decreases in
same-store sales for six months, as has Ohio-based Abercrombie &amp;
Fitch Co., which caters to teens and college-age consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Even Aeropostale Inc., a New York-based teen retailer that has
been outperforming the competition -- partly, analysts say, by
offering lower prices -- slipped into negative territory last month
when its comparable-store sales dipped 2.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Some bright spots exist. Hot Topic Inc., a City of Industry-based
retailer that analysts say sets itself apart with counter-culture
styles, saw same-store sales jump 5.9% in the five weeks ended Oct.
5.</TE>
<TE>   Yet overall the outlook remains gloomy. San Diego-based Charlotte
Russe Holding, which operates Charlotte Russe and Rampage stores,
warned last month that comparable store sales probably will fall
short of previous expectations in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears as though the first part of October is shaping up
similarly to the back half of September," analyst Jennifer Black of
Wells Fargo Securities said in a recent report on Abercrombie. "Mall
traffic has been spotty and we do not foresee a turnaround in the
next month."</TE>
<TE>   With sales slackening, some retailers have slowed expansion plans
for this year and next. For instance, Wet Seal, which had said it
would open 100 to 125 stores in 2003, says it will trim its expansion
to 75 stores if current trends continue.</TE>
<TE>   Mall location also is part of the problem, retail experts say,
because more people now buy clothes outside shopping centers at
stand-alone stores such as Target, Kohl's, Ross or T.J. Maxx.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, 62.1% of apparel purchases took place in malls, J.P.
Morgan's Tunick said. By last year, that number had dropped to 55.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Mall-based retailers have responded with a flurry of promotions.
But lower prices aren't a panacea in today's difficult retail
environment, analyst Anne-Marie Peterson, with Thomas Weisel
Partners, noted recently.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it is possible consumers are responding less to
promotions, or becoming somewhat 'numb,' after extended retail
promotional activity," Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, analysts expect retailers will continue to rely
heavily on markdowns, despite the effect on profits.</TE>

<HD>Webcaster Royalty Measure Stalls in the Senate</HD>
<DH>The bill, said to have been blocked by Sen. Helms, would
have slashed payments to labels and artists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bill designed to save small Internet radio stations from bankruptcy
foundered Thursday, failing to win final approval from the Senate
before lawmakers adjourned until after the November elections.</LD>
<LD>   Many Webcasters face a potentially ruinous day of reckoning
Sunday, when four years' worth of back royalties are due to be paid.</LD>
<LD>   The bill by House Judiciary Committee Chairman F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), which was passed by the House last week,
would have slashed royalty payments that small Webcasters must make
to record labels and artists.</LD>
<TE>   The Copyright Office is expected to rule today on requests from
Foster City, Calif.-based Live365 and college radio stations to delay
the royalties, while other Webcasters have appeals pending in federal
court. The Senate leadership also may revive the bill if all
outstanding objections are removed.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to the proceedings said the bill was blocked
unexpectedly by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) at the request of
unidentified over-the-air broadcasters. Representatives of Christian
radio stations had voiced concerns about the bill's potential impact
on the royalties they pay to songwriters, among other issues.</TE>
<TE>   Helms could not be reached late Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But the measure had disappointed or displeased many interest
groups, including the radio industry's main trade association,
telecommunications firms, college radio stations, Webcasting
hobbyists and mid-size and large Webcasters. They complained that the
bill either set a bad precedent or failed to provide enough relief.</TE>
<TE>   The main proponents were a group of small commercial Webcasters,
the Recording Industry Assn. of America and artists' unions.
Expressing surprise and disappointment at the bill's failure to pass,
Hilary Rosen, chief executive of the RIAA, said, "We hope that the
Senate will work this out quickly. All parties who support this
legislation should contact their senators to urge passage of this
bill."</TE>
<TE>   At issue were the royalties for record labels and performing
artists that the librarian of Congress set in July. Basing his ruling
solely on an agreement between Yahoo Inc. and the record labels, the
librarian called for commercial Webcasters to pay about $100 annually
per listener, and noncommercial stations to pay nearly $30 annually
per listener.</TE>

<LD>The California Department of Education on Thursday released the
latest round of scores for the state's Academic Performance Index.</LD>
<LD>   The API, now in its fourth year, evaluates schools based on
results from the Stanford 9 exam and tests linked to California's new
academic standards in English-language arts. It is a cornerstone of
California's public school accountability system.</LD>
<LD>   The performance index tells whether schools are meeting
state-mandated targets of higher test scores each year. The scores
are widely discussed in academic circles, and scrutinized by
principals, school boards and parents.</LD>
<TE>   State officials reported data for more than 6,400 campuses this
year. The data show that California's public schools are improving at
a slower pace than in previous years: Fifty-three percent of schools
statewide met their test score targets this year, down from 72% two
years ago. To meet their targets, schools must show improvement
campuswide, as well as for racial and ethnic subgroups.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, 37% of schools statewide qualified this year for
financial awards for exceeding their testing score targets. The
figure two years ago was 69%. Teachers in previous years earned up to
$25,000 bonuses if their schools boosted scores above their state
targets, although funding for this year's awards is not budgeted and
prospects are uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified School District was an exception to the
trend: Seventy-two percent of its schools met or exceeded their API
targets this year, slightly up from 2000. And 67% of schools
qualified for awards, down 1 percentage point from 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified's elementary schools drove the school
district's performance. Officials said those schools have focused on
reading and math, introduced coaches for teachers and now regularly
evaluate students' progress.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just another indicator of the improvement we are making
in the elementary grades," Supt. Roy Romer said.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, more than 1,000 schools did not receive API scores
Thursday, primarily because they are correcting demographic
information or because of testing irregularities. These campuses are
expected to receive their scores in December.</TE>
<TE>   The data released Thursday also revealed that most of the schools
that could have faced state sanctions will escape that fate this year
because they showed growth in their test scores. Only 22 schools --
out of nearly 400 at risk -- will face some discipline, such as
having teachers reassigned or having outside managers take over.
State officials will meet over the next three months to decide what
action to take on these schools.</TE>

<TE>   What is the API?</TE>
<TE>   California's Academic Performance Index is the cornerstone of Gov.
Gray Davis' push to hold schools accountable for student performance.
These statistics indicate whether schools are meeting improvement
targets for the Stanford 9 and California's academic standards.</TE>
<TE>   Schools must meet those targets--for the school overall and for
sizable subgroups within each school--to qualify for cash awards that
the state set aside in previous years  to encourage academic
improvement. Funding is not available so far this year.</TE>
<TE>   The statewide list covers 7,493 schools. Readers who want to know
how a school in Los Angeles County is faring can use this index as a
guide.</TE>
<TE>   Starting next year, the API will include results from the state's
math standards test and its  high school exit exam.</TE>
<TE>   Last January, the state ranked schools on a scale of 1 to 10 based
on results of the 2001 tests, with 10 representing the top 10% of
schools. New rankings, based on the 2002 tests, will be released in
January. Results for schools and districts are available on the Web
at http://api.cde.ca.gov.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How the API Was Computed</TE>
<TE>   State officials took each school's test scores from last spring
and used a seven-step formula to obtain a score from 200 to 1,000. To
satisfy the Public Schools Accountability Act of 1999, officials set
a statewide API performance target of 800 out of 1,000. The annual
growth target for a school is 5% of the range between a school's API
and 800. For example, a school with a 2000 API of 500 is 300 points
below the statewide target; 5% of 300 is 15 points, so that school's
goal for the 2001 API would be 515.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify for possible awards, schools must also show significant
improvement in the scores of each sizable subgroup. For example, the
scores of Latino students, if they represented a significant subgroup
in 2001 and 2002, would have to rise by 80% of the growth target. The
same would be true of economically disadvantaged students.</TE>

<LD>Artists colony -- An article in Monday's California section about the
Brewery artists colony near downtown Los Angeles stated that the
colony "has little in common with the mostly residential and Latino
working-class Lincoln Heights." That statement was attributed to
Brewery resident Don Levy. Levy's point was that the artists complex
has little in common with the mostly residential bedroom community of
Lincoln Heights. The observations about the ethnic and class makeup
of Lincoln Heights were made by The Times.</LD>

<HD>Anaheim Looks to Annex 8 'Islands'</HD>
<DH>The areas adjacent to the city would be more efficiently
run, proponents say. But some residents don't welcome the change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight unincorporated communities in and around Anaheim would be
annexed by the city in a sweeping deal that the Board of Supervisors
will consider next week.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal marks a significant step in the county's effort to
cede control of dozens of unincorporated "islands" to adjacent
cities, arguing that the municipalities can more efficiently provide
services like police protection and street sweeping.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan, Anaheim would take control of 750 acres of county
territory with 8,000 residents.</LD>
<TE>   The largest of the communities is Colonia Independencia, which was
founded by Latino laborers who came to Orange County before World War
I to work in orange groves. The five-block district is made up of
wood-frame homes. As late as the 1970s, it lacked sewers, paved
streets and sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   Cities have traditionally been reluctant to take over
unincorporated areas because of the cost of providing municipal
services.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim would agree to the annexation if the county continues to
lease to the city a popular golf course on county property for $1 a
year for 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Details of the proposed annexation still need to be worked out and
win approval from the Local Agency Formation Commission -- a process
that officials said will take at least two years.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday will be asked to extend the
lease of the Dad Miller Golf Course for this two-year period while
annexation is finalized. The course is next to the location the Tiger
Woods Foundation wants for an education center to serve
underprivileged children.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim officials said the deal would be a milestone.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about one of the larger unincorporated areas in the
county," said Tom Wood, Anaheim's assistant city manager. "The county
has been working to eliminate these county islands for some time."</TE>
<TE>   The Anaheim City Council was expected to vote on the agreement
Tuesday. But that meeting has been postponed because the Anaheim
Angels are playing the San Francisco Giants in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   The county has been trying to unload unincorporated areas since
1994, when the board decided to focus on "core services," such as
social services, public protection and health care. Officials argued
that cities -- not the county -- should be in the business of
providing municipal services.</TE>
<TE>   More Islands Remain</TE>
<TE>   So far, county islands near Costa Mesa, Newport Beach and Garden
Grove have moved closer to annexation. But many more remain, from the
working-class district of El Modena in Orange to such upscale
communities as Rossmoor and Orange Park Acres.</TE>
<TE>   There are more than 70 unincorporated islands, with a population
of well over 100,000 people. Some, like Rossmoor, have fought to stay
independent. Others have remained in the county because nearby cities
had little interest in taking them over.</TE>
<TE>   Colonia Independencia is bounded by Broadway on the north, Katella
Avenue on the south, Brookhurst Street on the east and Gilbert Street
on the west.</TE>
<TE>   Resident Arturo Plaza said Thursday he will need to be convinced
that annexation would be a good thing. In the 11 years that he has
lived in neighborhood, he's seen many improvements.</TE>
<TE>   "The gangs are no longer here," he said, "and, the area is
cleaner, it's improved. Why do we need to change from the county to
the city? I'm not in favor of that."</TE>
<TE>   For residents, annexation would probably eliminate confusion over
police protection and such services as sewer and trash pickup.
Presently, one side of the street can have law enforcement provided
by the Orange County Sheriff's Department while the other can be
patrolled by local police, said Ken Lee, a project manager for LAFCO,
a state-mandated formation commission.</TE>
<TE>   One of the advantages of incorporation could be lower utility
bills, because Anaheim owns its own utility.</TE>
<TE>   "Our rates are running 25% to 40% less," Wood said. "Residents and
many businesses really like that."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly said it's important to listen to
island residents before making a decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Concerns of the residents have to be taken into account," he
said. "I'll tell you one thing, the people who live in the
unincorporated areas aren't asking for annexation."</TE>
<TE>   Residents Felt Ignored</TE>
<TE>   Residents in some unincorporated islands -- mostly poorer ones --
have felt ignored by the county, especially after the county's
bankruptcy in 1994. Some areas still are without curbs, sidewalks and
other basic amenities.</TE>
<TE>   Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad has pushed to
revitalize the county's unincorporated islands.</TE>
<TE>   She created a task force with officials from probation, housing,
social services and other agencies that move into community centers
and provide services.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Petracca, chairman of UC Irvine's political science
department, said cities should expect to invest money if they plan to
take over the poorer islands.</TE>
<TE>   "You're talking about areas in some of these unincorporated areas
that are dilapidated, and it's going to cost the city more money than
you're bringing it," he said.</TE>

<HD>Survey Finds Support for School Bond</HD>
<DH>Measure K, which would provide $3.3billion to build and
renovate L.A. Unified campuses, is backed by 64% in Times poll.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Solomon Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A $3.3-billion Los Angeles Unified School District construction
bond is likely to get overwhelming support from city residents in the Nov.
5 election, according to a new Los Angeles Times poll.</LD>
<LD>   Sixty-four percent of poll respondents said it would be a
good idea to pass the bond, which would fund construction of 120 new
schools and the renovation of 79 existing ones. The proposition needs
a 55% vote to pass.</LD>
<LD>   The poll found that the school construction bond is favored by
wide margins of voters throughout the city and in nearly all
demographic groupings -- by age, ethnicity, gender and income. Among
voter groups, the strongest backers of the bond are Latino men, 80%
of whom said they wanted to vote for Measure K.</LD>
<TE>   Under the district's plan, Measure K funds would match funds
provided by a statewide ballot measure, Proposition 47, if it also
passes in November. That would give the district about $5 billion
that it says it needs to build enough schools to get most students
off buses and into neighborhood schools.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified School District bond would raise property
taxes by about $60 per $100,000 of assessed property value within the
district.</TE>
<TE>   The Times poll did not measure support for the state proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Despite fears by district advocates that secession drives in the
San Fernando Valley and Hollywood could derail the bond campaign,
residents in those areas said they would pass the bond by wide
margins.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-five percent of those polled were against the bonds and 11%
were either undecided or unaware of the measure. Most opposed to the
measure were Republicans, who split evenly for and against Measure K.</TE>
<TE>   In follow-up interviews, those who were against the bond cited
past mismanagement by the district, including problems with the
downtown Belmont Learning Complex, which has not been completed
because of toxic dangers discovered in the soil.</TE>
<TE>   Others were critical of the district's handling of the last local
school facilities bond, Proposition BB, which provided $2.4 billion
for the district in 1997. District officials have acknowledged that
mismanagement caused their plans to fall $600 million short of
completion.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Vela, a 73-year-old retired construction supervisor who
lives in North Hollywood and describes himself as a conservative
Democrat, said he is against the bond because "it's a waste of money.
The purpose might be right, but they won't spend it right. Look at
the bond a few years ago. What happened to the money from that?"</TE>
<TE>   But supporters of the measure said in follow-up interviews that
they saw the need for better physical conditions at schools.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely need more schools out here," said a Gardena
resident, Mark Hirano. "The schools look terrible and they're
spending too much money to bus the kids."</TE>
<TE>   Hirano, 44, a general contractor and father of three children in
public schools, said that passing the bond would help schools attract
better teachers and help students' performance.</TE>
<TE>   Doubert Rothenberg, 80, of West Los Angeles doesn't have children
in public school anymore but said he would still support the bond.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the kids deserve a break, especially since we have so
many immigrants and newcomers in the county and the state," he said,
noting that he was the son of an immigrant to the East Coast. "They
deserve the chance to do something with their lives instead of just
being laborers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The poll, supervised by Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus, was
conducted by telephone from Oct. 5 to Monday. It surveyed 970 likely
voters. The poll has a margin of sampling error of 3 percentage
points in either direction.</TE>

<HD>Another Condor Chick Is Dead</HD>
<DH>Of three birds hatched in the wild under repopulation
program, two have now died, both this month. Lead is suggested as
cause.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second time this month, a California condor chick that was
brooded and hatched in the wild was found dead in a cave deep in Los
Padres National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of death is unknown, but biologists said the bird's
mother had elevated lead levels in her blood and both parents often
foraged for food, putting them at risk for lead poisoning that could
be passed on to the chick.</LD>
<LD>   The death leaves just one chick of the original three left in the
wild, dampening hopes for a new generation of condors born outside
zoos.</LD>
<TE>   The deaths "are two independent events that may have similar or
different causes," said Bruce Palmer, coordinator of the $35-million
condor project for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "All of our
hopes are in the next generation. Of course we'll have another shot
next year, but every bird counts."</TE>
<TE>   The latest fatality was discovered Tuesday after Allan Mee, a
biologist watching the cave in the Sespe Condor Refuge, lost sight of
the turkey-sized chick inside.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I didn't see any signs of the chick and thought it had
possibly [flown off]," Mee said of the 5-month-old bird. "But when
the father pulled the chick out of the shadows of the cave, I
realized it was dead."</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. Forest Service helicopter tried to reach the site Wednesday
but turned back because of fog. On Thursday, biologists were trying
to rappel down a sheer cliff face to grab the dead chick, which will
be sent to the San Diego Zoo for a necropsy.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, the first condor in 18 years to brood and hatch in
the wild was found dead on a ledge just below its cave. Its father,
which had gone foraging, is missing and presumed dead.</TE>
<TE>   That chick's hatching last April was hailed as validation of the
controversial captive breeding program that had boosted the condor
population from 15 to almost 200 over the last 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   A necropsy on that chick has not revealed a cause of death, but
blood tests are not complete.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, many condors have died from swallowing lead shot
in the carcasses of animals. Although dead calves are provided for
the birds, new parents often revert to foraging instincts that can
take them far afield to carrion containing lead.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said the parents of the most recent dead chick had been
tracked to the Tehachapi Mountains. The chick had been eating well
and was fed by both birds, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the last week, Palmer said, bone and feather samples from
condors that have died over the years were taken to try to determine
lethal lead levels.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to bring the best science to bear to understand the
magnitude of this problem," he said. "We don't want to jump to
conclusions. We know that birds have died from lead, and we are
trying to find out where the lead is coming from."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the condor program say lead is the chief threat to the
continued existence of North America's largest bird. They say that
Fish and Wildlife Service officials haven't pushed hard enough for
nonlead bullets because they don't want to pick a fight with hunters
and the politically powerful National Rifle Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said discussions are ongoing about all these issues, but he
rejects the notion that condors should not be released into the wild
because of lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's very important that we have California condors in
the wild while we address these problems," he said. "They will become
less wild if they spend a generation in the zoo. There will always be
sources of death for condors. We want a viable population that can
tolerate a certain mortality of its own."</TE>
<TE>   There are currently 76 condors living wild in California, Arizona
and Mexico and 126 in captivity. The goal of the program is two
populations of 150 birds in California and Arizona.</TE>

<HD>Lockups at 3 Courthouses to Close</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman and Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Superior Court announced Thursday that it will
close lockups at courthouses in Hollywood, Monrovia and South Gate,
forcing hundreds of criminal cases to be transferred and upsetting
some law enforcement officials and community members.</LD>
<LD>   Layoffs will also continue, with about 86 employees expected to
receive notice today that Oct. 31 will be their last day of work. An
additional 90 employees will be transferred with pay cuts of as much
as $7,000 annually. The affected employees range from senior court
managers to entry-level clerical personnel.</LD>
<LD>   Union representatives said they were relieved that there were
fewer positions slashed than first estimated, but they will continue
lobbying local and state officials to prevent more cuts.</LD>
<TE>   Court officials announced in August that they were facing a
$57-million deficit and would reduce expenditures by 10%. During the
first round of cuts, about 168 employees were let go, out of a work
force of about 5,500. Since then, judges and administrators have
tried to continue downsizing without affecting daily operations. The
results are better than expected, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've tried to minimize the impact as much as possible," said
Assistant Presiding Judge Robert A. Dukes. "We're happy this is all
we have had to do."</TE>
<TE>   No courthouses will be closed entirely. Nine judges will be
transferred to new courthouses, including Judge Lloyd M. Nash, who is
presiding over actor Robert Blake's murder trial. The court also
named the 29 courtrooms around Los Angeles County that will be shut,
including five in Van Nuys, two in Chatsworth, three in the
metropolitan courthouse, two in the downtown criminal courts building
and five in the central civil courthouse. Individual courtrooms are
being closed in several other locations, including Santa Monica,
Downey, Pomona and West Los Angeles. The changes take effect Nov. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Court administrators said they decided which lockups to close
based on volume, cost of operation and the ability of nearby
courthouses to take the caseload.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the closures, cases with defendants in custody will
move from Hollywood to downtown and from South Gate to either Downey
or Bellflower. All of Monrovia's criminal cases will be transferred
to Alhambra.</TE>
<TE>   Monrovia Police Chief Roger Johnson said that he must buy a new
vehicle to transport defendants and that his officers will have to
travel farther to testify.</TE>
<TE>   "There is going to be a greater burden for us," he said. "But we
can't just throw down our glove and say we're not playing. We still
have to ... work within the system we have available."</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce mounted a letter-writing
campaign to persuade officials to maintain the lockup at the
courthouse. They said the closure is contrary to the community's
20-year effort to rid the area of quality-of-life crimes such as
prostitution by creating a full-service courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   "The courthouse is one of the key linchpins in the revitalization
of Hollywood," said Leron Gubler, president of the Hollywood Chamber
of Commerce. "We are fearful of losing this momentum, that the lockup
is the first step to a possible closure."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, court employees and union members have held
demonstrations to try to save jobs. The unions are also lobbying
lawmakers in Sacramento to increase the local court budget, said
Sandy Stewart of Service Employees International Union Local 660.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Executive Officer John A. Clarke said he regrets
the layoffs and closures, but said there was no alternative. "As a
court system, we're not immune to the effects of the economy on our
operation."</TE>

<HD>Latino Leaders Urge Davis' Reelection</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregg Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prominent California Latinos on Thursday praised Gov. Gray Davis as a
steadfast friend and urged fellow Latinos to reward the Democratic
incumbent with reelection on Nov. 5.</LD>
<LD>   Amid chants in Spanish of "long live Davis" and "four more years,"
a beaming Davis accepted rousing endorsements from Latino
legislators, labor leaders, educators and community activists at a
Staples Center news conference in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   For Davis, who is leading Republican challenger Bill Simon Jr. in
the polls, the event was a calculated milestone in his courtship of
Latino voters -- a quest crucial to the Democrat's hopes of a second
term.</LD>
<TE>   "We've made a lot of progress with and for the Latino community:
better schools, better jobs, better opportunities for their
children," Davis said. "We will make more progress. Juntos podemos!
["Together we can!"]</TE>
<TE>   The show of support was arranged in part to counter criticism --
especially in Spanish-language media -- of Davis' Sept. 30 veto of
legislation that would have given driver's licenses to some illegal
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles), the bill's original
author, denounced Davis for breaking a promise to sign the measure;
it's a claim that Davis denies. Earlier this month, Cedillo led a
successful move to deny the governor an endorsement by the Latino
Legislative Caucus, a group composed of the 22 Latino Democrats in
the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Cedillo was conspicuously absent Thursday. But state Sen. Richard
Polanco (D-Los Angeles) and several other Latino legislators were on
hand to praise Davis lavishly, and 17 of the 22 Latino caucus members
were among the more than three dozen signatories to a Davis
endorsement that began running Thursday in the Spanish-language
newspaper La Opinion.</TE>
<TE>   With less than three weeks to election day, Davis has made shoring
up his support among Latinos a primary focus this week. Nearly 11
million California residents -- almost one-third of the total
population -- are Latino. Though many are not eligible to vote, 70%
of Latinos who did vote in 1998 supported Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Latinos are deciding a growing number of elections in California,
analysts say. "Given that everybody in politics senses we have a
turned-off electorate going into the election, and everybody is
worried about turnout, it makes a great deal of sense for the
governor to be focusing on motivating the [Democratic] base," said
Democratic campaign consultant Darry Sragow.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the national Republican Party is stepping up
efforts to lure Latino voters away from their traditional Democratic
tendencies. And recent polls suggest that Republicans are gaining
acceptability with Latinos. But in California, the GOP has struggled
to make inroads with Latinos because of persistent anger over former
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's support of 1994's Proposition 187,
which outlawed many services to illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has attempted to woo Latino voters, with mixed success. In a
Times poll this month, Davis led Simon by nearly 2 to 1 among likely
Latino voters. "The issue is whether large numbers of Latino voters
are going to vote," Sragow said. "I certainly see no evidence that
there is some sort of erosion for Gray Davis among the Latinos who
vote."</TE>
<TE>   Latino leaders on Thursday praised Davis for his support, ranging
from the appointment of a Latino state Supreme Court justice to the
expansion of health-care coverage to hundreds of thousands of Latino
children under the Healthy Families program. "We're going to make
sure Latino voter turnout is above par," Polanco said.</TE>
<TE>   Standing on the stage, soaking up the praise and endorsements,
Davis was flanked by fiery United Farm Workers union co-founder
Dolores Huerta. She thanked Davis profusely for signing legislation
that gave farm workers the right to a form of binding arbitration in
stalled negotiations with growers -- she had threatened to fast until
Davis signed the legislation -- and the two hugged and exchanged
kisses on the cheek.</TE>
<TE>   During a campaign stop in San Diego, Simon brushed off the show of
support for Davis, saying he has done more to appeal to Latinos than
the governor. He cited his focus on job creation and education.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Mr. Davis is having trouble shoring up his support in the
Latino community," Simon said after a speech to the San Diego Rotary
Club. "I think you'll find he reaches out because he feels he has to.
We, on the other hand, have been reaching out pretty much throughout
the general election."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Simon promoted his economic agenda at an exposition of
Latino business owners at the Los Angeles Convention Center. With a
band playing conga, he walked from booth to booth with Hector V.
Barreto, head of the U.S. Small Business Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Harold H. Martinez, president of Able Industrial Products of
Ontario, told Simon his costs for insuring workers injured on the job
had soared.</TE>
<TE>   Simon told him he would streamline the state's worker's
compensation system to ease the burden on employers.</TE>

<HD>An About-Face on Measure A</HD>
<DH>Taxpayers association drops its opposition, endorses
initiative to allow hillside housing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A taxpayers group has endorsed a ballot measure that would allow
1,350 homes to be built in the foothills and canyons overlooking
Ventura, reversing a position it took last week to oppose the
controversial initiative.</LD>
<LD>   The Ventura County Taxpayers Assn. board Wednesday night heard
from both sides of Measure A, which seeks voter approval for
development of six neighborhoods over 15 years in exchange for
donating 3,050 acres as public open space.</LD>
<LD>   After reconsideration, board members agreed their first decision
stemmed from misinformation and were persuaded that the hillside
housing project would benefit Ventura County taxpayers.</LD>
<TE>   "You have to do what's right," said association President Don
Facciano. "It's easy to not go back and reverse yourself, because
that is extremely rare and it took a lot to do that. But we value our
credibility quite a bit, which is why we wanted to go back and look
at it again."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of Measure A, who viewed the taxpayer group's original
support as a key to derailing the initiative, now contend that it
caved in to intense lobbying by landowners and other supporters of
the hillside development.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A foes spent $4,000 to print 30,000 brochures hailing the
association's initial position. Their requests for reimbursement have
been denied.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Bennett, co-founder of Save Open Space and Agricultural
Resources, which is battling Measure A., would not say whether his
group would use the brochures despite the reversal of position.</TE>
<TE>   "This demonstrates the power of the landowner to put the pressure
on a citizens' group," Bennett said of the board's vote. "It also
shows that this initiative is so complex, even the taxpayers
association can't figure it out."</TE>
<TE>   Measure A backers, however, said the debacle simply is a backlash
from what they say is a misinformation campaign by the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   And while measure backers admitted making phone calls to taxpayer
board members, they denied applying "withering pressure," as Bennett
alleged.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Facciano said he received more calls this week from those
opposed to Measure A than he had received from those in favor.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is this is what happens when you lie and someone
can prove you misled," said Margaret Merryman, Measure A spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Forbes, attorney for the landowners, said the 165-page Measure
A is not too complex for voters to understand.</TE>
<TE>   "The primary reason it's confusing is because the opponents are
telling people things that aren't in the initiative," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In its early discussions of Measure A, the taxpayer group's
government relations committee heard from both sides and decided to
endorse the measure.</TE>
<TE>   But a week later, when the full board was debating the issue,
Facciano said, one board member mistakenly said the initiative would
cap the amount of money the city could require of the landowner to
offset environmental problems -- an interpretation espoused by some
Measure A opponents.</TE>
<TE>   That led to the board's original vote to oppose the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday night, Forbes assured the board that the company will
supply all funds to make the project environmentally sound.</TE>
<TE>   "The burden will not fall on taxpayers," Facciano said. "We have a
commitment on that."</TE>

<HD>Fire Protection Is Not Proving a Hot Issue in Secession
Debate</HD>
<DH>Many cityhood backers in the Valley and Hollywood agree the
best way to get better service is to keep the LAFD -- and build on
it.</DH>
<SE>Fifth in a series of stories on Los Angeles city services.</SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>Fifth in a series of stories on Los Angeles city services.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Secessionists generally tout the advantages of smaller government,
but they too acknowledge that bigger sometimes can be better.</LD>
<TE>   When it comes to a fire department, for instance, they want more
firefighters, more paramedics and more stations in the San Fernando
Valley and Hollywood. The best way to achieve this, many breakup
advocates say, is to keep what they already have -- the Los Angeles
Fire Department -- and then build on it.</TE>
<TE>   If the Valley and Hollywood secede, the LAFD would be required to
serve the new cities for one year after they begin operations next
July. But the cities would have the option of launching their own
departments or contracting with the Los Angeles County Fire
Department, instead of the LAFD.</TE>
<TE>   Most secession leaders say they favor a contract with the LAFD, at
least for the foreseeable future, because they fear that cutting the
department loose would be disruptive and could put the public at
risk.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAFD is one of the best in the world," Valley secession
leader Richard Katz said. "I would hope the Valley would stay with
the department .... It's as good or better than starting over."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secessionist Gene La Pietra agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great department, it's competitive with other departments
and it's staying," he said. "You're not going to get a better deal
starting over."</TE>
<TE>   But the breakup proponents also see problems in the 3,577-employee
department, and they blame them on City Hall. They say an independent
Valley and Hollywood would improve the LAFD, primarily by pressing
Los Angeles to increase spending for more firefighters, paramedics
and equipment to the two regions.</TE>
<TE>   In one sense, secession advocates have an ally in the LAFD's rank
and file. Although the union representing city firefighters opposes
breaking up the city, it agrees that the department has its
shortcomings, in part because, the union says, the LAFD suffered
during Mayor Richard Riordan's years as mayor, when firefighters felt
neglected by his push to expand the police force. Riordan, who was
elected in the wake of the 1992 riots, spent millions of dollars to
hire and train new police officers, but he devoted comparatively
little attention to the Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   The department's staff-to-population ratio -- 0.84 firefighters
per 1,000 residents -- is about half the national average for
big-city fire agencies, according to the Washington, D.C.-based
International Assn. of Fire Fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "The overall crux of the problem in L.A. is staffing," said George
Burke, a spokesman for the association, which has 255,000 members.</TE>
<TE>   LAFD officials say the firefighter shortage helps explain why the
department ranks below many large agencies in response times to
emergencies. Also, the department's 650 paramedics have been
stretched thin by the closure of local trauma centers -- which means
longer trips to hospital emergency rooms -- and the growing number of
people without medical insurance who rely on the LAFD for emergency
medical services, said secessionists and department officials.</TE>
<TE>   More than 80% of 911 calls to the LAFD are for paramedics.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a long-term plan to expand the LAFD, Mayor James K.
Hahn increased its budget by 5% this year, adding 72 firefighters and
paramedics. The department also wants to add 100 paramedics annually
for the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   Ambulances are another concern. Some of the busier fire stations
have two ambulances at the ready, but 21 stations -- including eight
in the Valley and one in Hollywood -- have none. The department says
it will buy nine more ambulances by June, expanding its fleet to 115.</TE>
<TE>   After the transitional year in which the new Valley and Hollywood
cities would continue to receive services from the LAFD, their city
councils would decide whether to sign a contract with the department
or the county, or start their own departments.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley accounts for nearly half the LAFD's 470-square-mile
coverage area (the proposed Hollywood city is just 15 square miles).
The department's response times in the Valley are slightly longer
than the citywide average -- 5.6 minutes compared with 5.1 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Average response times for paramedics are 6.9 minutes citywide and
7.1 minutes for the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Residents have complained about response times for years,
particularly in hillside areas prone to brush fires.</TE>
<TE>   Glenridge Homeowners Assn. President Harold Tennen, who lives in
the hills south of Mulholland Drive near Beverly Glen Boulevard, said
the city has ignored the Fire Department's staffing and equipment
needs. A few years ago, the neighborhood raised $80,000 to renovate
its fire station and buy equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to do it, because the city wasn't," Tennen said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he plans to vote against secession, in part because he
doesn't want to see the LAFD broken up. "The firefighters do a good
job," despite a lack of resources, he said. "[Secession] would not be
beneficial in any way."</TE>
<TE>   Mel Wilson, a Valley mayoral candidate on the secession ballot,
said phasing out the Valley's relationship with the LAFD would
improve service.</TE>
<TE>   The former city fire commissioner is one of the few high-profile
secessionists who wants the Valley to create its own fire department.</TE>
<TE>   A new, locally controlled department, Wilson said, would be better
able to set spending priorities for hiring and upgrading.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying the LAFD doesn't do a good job.... But it's
important to have control of your own destiny," Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Los Angeles firefighters argue that their department
needs upgrading, they have steadfastly opposed secession as the way
to achieve it. Their union has contributed $200,000 to Hahn's
anti-secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles United Firefighters says a breakup would bring too
many uncertainties, and in the end could cut into staffing and leave
parts of the region underprotected. An LAFD report on secession
warned of similar circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   At Fire Station 88 in Sherman Oaks, Battalion Chief Greg West has
spent the last few months studying secession for the LAFD's report.
He paints a mostly grim picture for an independent Valley department.</TE>
<TE>   West said a smaller Valley agency would not have the deployment
flexibility of the LAFD. A Valley agency could call on the LAFD for
help under a "mutual aid" agreement, but that would invariably
involve delays in deployment, West said.</TE>
<TE>   "In an emergency," he said, "every second counts."</TE>

<HD>Father Pleads Not Guilty in Girl's Shooting</HD>
<DH>The Dana Point man maimed his daughter when he fired his
shotgun accidentally. He is charged with felony child endangerment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Dana Point man accused of wounding his 8-year-old daughter by
accidentally firing his shotgun pleaded not guilty Thursday in a case
that has ignited a debate about how far prosecutors should go in
punishing parents in gun accidents.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffrey A. West, who entered the plea in a Laguna Niguel
courtroom, faces up to nine years in prison if convicted of a felony
child-endangerment charge that was enhanced with an additional count
that he inflicted great bodily harm upon his daughter.</LD>
<LD>   Madison West lost part of her right arm and a kidney as a result
of the Sept. 27 shooting.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators say the girl was standing near her father in his
bedroom, watching him inspect his new shotgun, when the weapon
accidentally fired as he unloaded it.</TE>
<TE>   She is recovering at the San Diego County home of her mother, who
divorced West four years ago and shares custody of Madison and their
10-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   The case has left prosecutors, defense attorneys and gun advocates
at odds over whether it is fair to hold West criminally responsible
for a shooting that even investigators acknowledge was an accident.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Sheriff's Department and district attorney's
office say the charges are justified. They contend West was fully
aware his daughter was nearby and knew the gun was loaded, and that
he should have at least pointed it away from her, knowing the
possible consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "She was standing right next to him, in very close proximity,"
said sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino. "It appeared to be accidental.
Nonetheless, it's very careless. You don't load and unload guns next
to very small children. He put her in great danger."</TE>
<TE>   West's mother, sobbing outside the courtroom, said he is
devastated by the accident and does not deserve further punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Lori Andie said her son has had primary custody of Madison and her
brother, and described him as a devoted, responsible father who has
spent every day at the hospital since the shooting, washing his
daughter's hair and helping nurses any way he can.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a horrible tragedy, and one he has to live with the
rest of his life," she said, recalling a recent phone conversation
with her son. "He asked me if I had seen his baby, and he cried. She
really looks to her daddy for her strength. I think the reason she's
doing so well is because of her dad's care."</TE>
<TE>   West's attorney, Robison D. Harley Jr., characterized the shooting
as "nothing more than a tragic accident" that has left a single
father traumatized, depressed and unfairly separated from a daughter
he adores.</TE>
<TE>   "He's devastated. He's mortified," Harley said outside the
courtroom. Prosecutors "are trying to distort this tragedy into some
kind of crime. The fact is, it's still an accident, and there was no
criminal will involved. We've got an innocent man. He's a model
parent. And he's being abused by the system."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say it is difficult to compare this shooting to others
because gun accidents of this nature are rare.</TE>
<TE>   Most cases involving children occur in their handling an adult's
gun that wasn't stored properly, and many of California's gun
regulations focus on these situations.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County alone, charges have been filed in several
parent-child shootings over the last 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   * In 1992, a Santa Ana man who shot and wounded his 4-year-old
daughter while unloading his .44-magnum revolver in his bedroom was
sentenced to a three-year prison term on a felony charge of child
endangerment and four counts of illegally possessing a firearm.</TE>
<TE>   * In 1995, a Costa Mesa man who was intoxicated while he was
cleaning his gun fatally shot his teenage daughter in the neck as the
two talked in his bedroom. Charged with involuntary manslaughter, he
pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one year in jail and three years'
probation.</TE>
<TE>   * In 1998, a Laguna Niguel woman stood trial for murder in the
shooting of her 9-year-old son whom she said she shot accidentally
after hearing what she thought was an intruder.</TE>
<TE>   She was acquitted two years later and filed a $25-million lawsuit
against the county, contending authorities fabricated evidence that
the shooting was deliberate.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Michel, spokesman for the state chapter of the National
Rifle Assn. said that even if West acted "recklessly," charging him
with willful intent is "a big stretch."</TE>
<TE>   He said prosecutors may have information they have not made
public.</TE>
<TE>   "Speaking as a former prosecutor myself, I recognize this is a
tragic situation. But from what we know, it seems the D.A. may be
compounding the tragedy by overcharging the case ... unless they know
some aggravating circumstances that have not at this point been made
public," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, it would not surprise me if a big factor in making
this decision was politics or a prejudice against gun owners," Michel
said.</TE>

<HD>Screening Bottleneck Bogs Down John Wayne</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A computer malfunction combined with inexperienced screeners caused
some people to miss their morning flights at John Wayne Airport on
Thursday, one day after the federal government took over the
airport's security.</LD>
<LD>   "On the north side of the terminal the lines went back as far as
the doors that go to the parking lot, which is a long way," said Skip
Williams, security director for the federal Transportation Security
Administration, which began providing security at the airport
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, he said, passengers going through security
checkpoints from 7:30 to 9 a.m. faced waits of up to an hour, causing
some to miss their flights. "We don't know how many," Williams said.</LD>
<TE>   According to one report, only 64 of the 115 passengers booked on
an American Airlines flight to San Francisco were able to get through
security in time to board their plane. As the plane took off nearly
half empty, one passenger said, its captain apologized, citing
security delays.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the airlines could not confirm those numbers but
said anyone missing a flight is routinely booked on a later flight.
"I understand that several of our flights took delays to accommodate
passengers who were late," Tara Baten said, "but we can't hold a
flight indefinitely."</TE>
<TE>   Williams said the problem was caused by the breakdown of a
computer controlling the X-ray machine in one of the airport's four
security screening lanes, which took about five hours to fix.</TE>
<TE>   The situation was exacerbated, he said, by the fact that it was
only the second day on the job for 150 federal baggage screeners
beginning 60 hours of required on-the-job training.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to understand that this is a brand-new force still in
the training mode," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   The training began Wednesday as U.S. Transportation Secretary
Norman Y. Mineta inaugurated the use of federal screeners at the
airport and announced that high-tech equipment to check baggage for
explosives would be in place by December.</TE>
<TE>   To accommodate future delays, airport officials said, they would
reiterate suggestions that passengers arrive at least two hours
before their scheduled departures.</TE>

<HD>Better Data Sought on Latino Children</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jose Cardenas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Latino civil rights organization called Thursday for better
demographic research by the statewide commission that oversees the
spending of tobacco tax revenues earmarked for childhood development
programs.</LD>
<LD>   The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund addressed
its proposals to the California Children and Families Commission,
which held its monthly meeting in Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The statewide commission was formed to oversee the spending of
revenues raised by Proposition 10. It oversees the work of individual
county commissions that spend the money locally.</LD>
<TE>   Approved by voters in 1998, the proposition, which put a 50-cent
tax on each pack of cigarettes, provides services such as child care
and early childhood education to children up to 5 years old.</TE>
<TE>   The organization, urging that the needs of Latino children be
considered in the distribution of funds, proposed that agencies
offering services funded by the proposition collect data on the
races, ethnicities, national origins and languages of children and
their families.</TE>
<TE>   The group also suggested research to determine why relatively few
Latinas use prenatal health care.</TE>
<TE>   The group presented its findings on Latino children in the 14
counties with the biggest Latino populations, including Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego and Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   The report said that, in eight of the counties, at least 60% of
all children up to 5 years old are Latino. The report said many of
their parents work in low-paying jobs that limit their ability to pay
for early-childhood development programs.</TE>
<TE>   Only 24% of eligible Latino children are enrolled in preschool or
kindergarten, compared with 57% of eligible whites and 43% of black
children, the group said.</TE>

<HD>Medical Center Is Dedicated in Palmdale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Stassel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new $6-million medical center was publicly dedicated Thursday in
Palmdale on what could be the site of the city's next hospital.</LD>
<LD>   The South Valley Medical Center has a primary-care clinic, an
obstetrics clinic and an urgent-care facility. It also houses the
state-run Women, Infants and Children program.</LD>
<LD>   Plans call for eventually expanding the center into a 300-bed
hospital, said Gary Hill, chairman of the board of the Antelope
Valley Health Care District, which paid for the 25,000-square-foot
facility's construction.</LD>
<TE>   Although the center opened three months ago, the dedication was
delayed until X-ray equipment for the urgent-care facility arrived
recently. Since its opening, 3,300 patients have been treated at the
center.</TE>
<TE>   "This means close access to health care," Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   The medical center, at 38350 40th St. East, is critical to
Palmdale, which has been without a hospital since Palmdale Hospital
closed in 1996. Also, due to a budget shortfall, the Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors voted this summer to convert High Desert
Hospital in Lancaster into an outpatient center -- unless it can
start turning a profit by May.</TE>
<TE>   Staffing costs at the Palmdale center will be shared by the
Antelope Valley Health Care District and Los Angeles County.</TE>

<HD>Newhall Ranch Developer Agrees to Buy More Water for 21,600
Homes</HD>
<DH>The supplies would come from a private source in Kern
County, spokeswoman says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to allay fears about insufficient water supplies, the
developer of the massive Newhall Ranch subdivision has agreed to buy
additional water for the 21,600-home development from a private
source in Kern County, a spokeswoman said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement would allow Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. to purchase
1,600 acre-feet of water per year for its development, said Marlee
Lauffer, a Newhall spokeswoman. An acre-foot is 326,000 gallons,
enough water to supply two average-size families for a year.</LD>
<LD>   "We decided it was important to go out and purchase additional
water to cover all contingencies," Lauffer said. The subdivision is
expected to use 17,600 acre-feet of water per year.</LD>
<TE>   A judge has temporarily blocked construction of the
70,000-resident subdivision until the developer can prove it has
sufficient water supplies to support the project in multiple drought
years.</TE>
<TE>   The court ruling was prompted by lawsuits filed by opponents of
the project.</TE>
<TE>   The developer in January is scheduled to present the Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors with a more complete environmental
analysis of the project, including details on the project's water
sources.</TE>
<TE>   The developer, however, may still face some stumbling blocks.</TE>
<TE>   The new water arrangement has yet to be completed, and Newhall
Land has declined to name the source of the water, raising the ire of
environmentalists who went to court to stall a similar arrangement
that the developer struck with a local water wholesaler.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't answer all of the questions about total water supply
for the [project]," said John Buse, an attorney who represents the
environmental group Friends of the Santa Clara River. "Newhall Ranch
is a small city."</TE>
<TE>   The environmental group filed a lawsuit in 1999 challenging an
arrangement to transfer up to 41,000 acre-feet of water yearly from
the Kern County Water Agency to the Castaic Lake Water Agency, which
would supply a portion of the Newhall Ranch subdivision.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge ruled the Castaic Lake
agency's environmental impact report was inadequate and needed to be
revised. The state Supreme Court earlier this year refused to
interfere with the lower court ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The Newhall Ranch development -- the largest residential project
in Los Angeles County history -- was approved by Los Angeles County
supervisors in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   But the development has been stalled by lawsuits filed by Ventura
County and a host of environmental groups, who maintain the developer
has failed to prove it can acquire enough water for the development.</TE>
<TE>   Water isn't the only problem plaguing the project.</TE>
<TE>   Last month Newhall Land announced it had discovered on its
property a population of Los Angeles sunflowers, which were thought
to be extinct for more than six decades.</TE>
<TE>   The endangered San Fernando Valley spineflower has also been found
on the site, and the state Department of Fish and Game is conducting
an investigation to determine whether the company had destroyed any
of the plants.</TE>
<TE>   The developer has also pleaded not guilty in Los Angeles Superior
Court to one count of altering a stream bed on its property.</TE>
<TE>   A trial in that matter is set to begin Nov. 20.</TE>

<HD>Education Cash Awards Suspended</HD>
<DH>Budget crunch means schools and teachers won't get millions
of dollars they earned. O.C. schools do well, but fewer meet targets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Duke Helfand</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Davis administration has suspended its much-touted education
awards program for this academic year, apparently stiffing more than
2,300 high-performing campuses and teachers who had earned millions
of dollars in bonuses for their hard work.</LD>
<LD>   Administration officials acknowledged Thursday that the state's
budget crisis has made it impossible to fund the awards, a key
element of the state's accountability program that has slowly been
scaled back as economic woes have worsened.</LD>
<LD>   "It's frustrating, because you see people here put tremendous
effort into their work," said Principal Sue DiJulio of Carson Street
Elementary School in Los Angeles, which qualified for an undetermined
amount of award money this year.</LD>
<TE>   "None of us are doing it for the money, but when you're promised
it, you want to get it."</TE>
<TE>   The bad news came as state officials released the latest round of
scores for the Academic Performance Index, which is based on
standardized test scores and indicates whether schools meet
state-mandated targets for improvement each year.</TE>
<TE>   The data, drawn from more than 6,400 campuses this year, also
determine whether campuses face sanctions or qualify for awards.</TE>
<TE>   This year's results showed that California's public schools are
improving at a slower rate than in the past and that, had rewards
been available, fewer schools would have qualified compared to the
last two years.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, where students traditionally fare better on
standardized tests than their counterparts elsewhere in California,
schools again posted some of the highest API scores in the state.</TE>
<TE>   But the jubilation was tempered by the fact that the percentage of
schools meeting growth targets dropped for a second year in a row,
from 72% to 64%. The problem is with the state's accountability
system, said William Habermehl, Orange County superintendent of
education.</TE>
<TE>   "It is hard to get a lot of improvement at the top," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You are kind of bouncing off the ceiling, and it is hard for the
kids to see the rewards of the great efforts they are putting in."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis originally envisioned the bonuses as an annual
incentive for schools and teachers to improve student performance.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, schools earned tens of thousands in extra cash, and
individual teachers reaped bonuses of up to $25,000. Since the awards
programs were launched in 2000, the state has paid out nearly $822
million.</TE>
<TE>   But the budget crisis forced the state to scale back the ambitious
-- if controversial -- awards. Davis had proposed $207 million in
school awards this year but in negotiations with the Legislature
agreed to cut the funds to preserve other important programs, said
Hilary McLean, a spokeswoman for the governor. No replacement funds
have been found.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to make a lot of tough choices, including deciding not to
fund a program that is near and dear to his heart," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who is seeking reelection next month, will provide schools
with certificates honoring their progress, McLean said. "The governor
is every bit as proud of schools that have made significant gains as
he has been each and every year that we've had the API as a tool to
measure improvement," she said.</TE>
<TE>   State Education Secretary Kerry Mazzoni said one possibility would
be for the Legislature to allocate money in a special session;
another would be for Davis to include new funding when he submits
next year's budget in January. But she said prospects for that are
uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   The only money currently available in the budget for awards --
$144 million -- is going to retroactively pay last year's winning
schools, she said. The separate $100-million bonus system just for
teachers was dropped last year for lack of money and is not expected
to be funded retroactively.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of award money has dismayed some educators.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not good news at all," said Crystal Whitley, principal of
Fontana Middle School, which had planned to use award money for new
furniture, overhead projectors and textbooks. "We're talking about
losing basic things that kids and teachers need."</TE>
<TE>   Some teachers and principals, however, said they won't miss the
award money, calling huge bonuses for individual teachers divisive
and unnecessary. Many teachers and lawmakers said it was unfair to
reward some and not others.</TE>
<TE>   "I am glad we're not getting the money," said Nancy Sassaman, an
English teacher at Diamond Ranch High School in Pomona. "I would
rather students improved, not because schools got money, but because
they genuinely learned more."</TE>
<TE>   John Wilber, principal of Fillmore High School, said the money is
irrelevant to the more pressing goal: ensuring that all students pass
the state's new high school exit exam.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any difference in how hard our school tries on these
tests each year, with or without the economic rewards," he said.
"It's always nice to have extra money, but it doesn't make any real
difference."</TE>
<TE>   The API scores released Thursday are based on results from the
Stanford 9 exam and other standardized tests linked to new academic
standards in English-language arts.</TE>
<TE>   The results showed that 53% of schools statewide met their test
score targets this year, down from 58% last year and 72% two years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   To meet their targets, the schools must show improvement overall
as well as among separate racial and ethnic subgroups of students.
Thirty-seven percent of campuses would have qualified for awards this
year, down from 48% last year and 69% two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Mazzoni and other educators said they had expected progress to
slow as schools found it harder to raise test scores year after year.
In addition, educators said the state English-language arts standard
test--which was factored into API scores for the first time this
year--is much harder than the Stanford 9. The language arts test,
based on California's new academic standards, made it tougher for
schools to improve over last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say to everyone, 'Don't sit back on your laurels saying
you've done everything you can,' " said Charles Weis, superintendent
of Ventura County schools. "There's work to be done."</TE>
<TE>   About 40% of Orange County schools have met or exceed the 800 API
score the state set as a goal. Statewide, that number is only about
20%.</TE>
<TE>   Corona del Mar High School, for example, dropped 10 points this
year. It still scored 823, the 29th highest API in the state for high
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "There is always room for improvement," said Principal Sharon Fry.</TE>
<TE>   "But more important than that is consistent effort."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified School District defied the statewide
trend: 72% of its schools met their API targets this year. Last year,
the figure for the same schools was 67%; it was 70% two years ago.
L.A. Unified's elementary schools led the way, with 86% meeting their
growth targets, up from 81% two years ago. This increase was
expected, given the district's improved Stanford 9 test results this
year.</TE>
<TE>   District officials credited the positive showing in the elementary
grades to regimented instruction in reading and math, ongoing
coaching for teachers, regular testing to evaluate student
performance and demanding academic standards.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very strong evidence that we can get this job done if we
really focus," said Supt. Roy Romer.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are doing is paying off. I'm really pleased."</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified's results, however, were not complete. It did not
receive API scores for about 80 schools, most of them elementary
campuses, because they are correcting demographic information needed
to calculate the results. The missing information is not expected to
change the district's overall results dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, more than 1,000 schools did not get scores because they
are correcting demographic information or because of testing
irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   The state data revealed that most of the schools in California at
risk of state sanctions will escape that fate this year because they
showed at least marginal growth in test scores.</TE>
<TE>   Only 22 schools -- out of nearly 400 -- will face some discipline,
from having to be evaluated by outside experts to having teachers
reassigned to letting independent managers take over.</TE>
<TE>   State officials will decide over the next three months what action
to take with each school.</TE>

<HD>Orange's Focus: Growth, Finances</HD>
<DH>The City Council candidates foresee budget and development
challenges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Phil Willon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dealing with several large new developments and keeping the city's
finances in balance are the top issues in the City Council race in
Orange.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Mark A. Murphy is running unopposed, but seven candidates
have lined up for two seats up for grabs on the council, including
incumbent Carolyn V. Cavecche, who won a bruising special election
earlier this year.</LD>
<LD>   "One of the biggest challenges facing all cities in California is
the upcoming budget crunch," Cavecche said. "The fear is that they
are not making the cuts they need to in Sacramento and will grab our
license-fee money. We need that money; it translates into police
response, fire response and library hours."</LD>
<TE>   Although she has been on the council for less than a year,
Cavecche, a homemaker, got her first taste of politics a few years
ago when she led a campaign to have city merchants cover their
displays of pornographic magazines. She went on to join the Orange
Public Library Board of Trustees.</TE>
<TE>   Cavecche said the council needs members experienced in government
policymaking, not only because of the tough budget decisions that may
lie ahead but also because of the onslaught of developments destined
for east Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Council candidate Steven Frank Ambriz, who serves as policy
advisor to county Supervisor Todd Spitzer, said the council needs to
take an active role in shaping the Irvine Co.'s proposed 2,500-home
Santiago Hills development, which will be on land the city plans to
annex.</TE>
<TE>   Ambriz and other candidates said the Irvine Co. has a good
reputation when it comes to including open space and recreation
facilities, but he expressed concern about its decision to eliminate
a commercial center.</TE>
<TE>   That move was generally praised by city leaders. At the same time,
council members realized the loss of the commercial center would mean
less tax revenue to pay for city services in that area.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just keeping an eye on them. It's making sure they're
scaled in the right way," said Ambriz, who also worked for the city
as a community and special-events coordinator. "How are you going to
pay for infrastructure needs? How are you going to meet the demands
of fire and police services?"</TE>
<TE>   City Traffic Commissioner Mark J. Burkhardt, a council candidate,
said the council also must address traffic problems sure to accompany
the new developments, as well as the need for stepped-up traffic
safety enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a lot of poor planning [in the city]. Why do you
think we have such terrible traffic problems in Orange?" said
Burkhardt, a Realtor and longtime neighborhood preservation leader in
the city.</TE>
<TE>   Burkhardt said his experience leading neighborhood groups and
dealing with day-to-day issues affecting residents will bring more
common-sense leadership to the council.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Joanne Coontz, whose term ends in 2004 and is not up
for reelection, said the current batch of candidates seems to have a
lot of ideas for new city parks, library improvements and other
needed facilities. But, she said, the candidates need to realize that
the City Council has been careful to avoid the financial woes
suffered by some neighboring cities.</TE>
<TE>   The other council candidates are business owner Mike Perry,
contractor Ernest Glasgow, university student Fred Dageforde and
executive recruiter Jimmy Lona.</TE>

<HD>Inmate Lauded, Parole Doubtful</HD>
<DH>Her achievements draw hundreds to her cause after 22 years
served for a killing. The governor's usual veto is expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Warren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 1,000 Californians want Jerilyn Becker freed from prison.
Among them is the man who put her there.</LD>
<LD>   Retired Marin County Superior Court Judge E. Warren McGuire calls
Becker, who has served 22 years for a killing over a drug deal, "the
most successfully rehabilitated prisoner I've ever come across."</LD>
<LD>   But the opinion that counts belongs to Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<TE>   In his first term, Davis has agreed to free only two murderers
deemed ready for release by his appointees on the state parole board,
rejecting 141 others. With less than three weeks to go until election
day, few analysts expect the governor to soften up now.</TE>
<TE>   "The politically safe thing for him to do is to deny parole," said
Darry Sragow, a Democratic campaign consultant. "If you just say no,
nothing bad happens. Her timing is not real good."</TE>
<TE>   Davis must decide Becker's fate today, and his office has been
flooded with letters and petitions asking him to free her.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from her sentencing judge, she has support from Catholic
nuns, college professors, homemakers, retired bankers, 14 state
legislators and many others offering her jobs, money and shelter once
she's freed. The San Francisco Chronicle ran a full-page editorial
praising her transformation and urging parole.</TE>
<TE>   Becker's advocates say two main factors drew them to her cause:
the fact that she did not fire the bullet that killed the victim,
Rickey Caponio, and her record of helping others while behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   "The amount of good Jeri has done in the prison environment is
just extraordinary," said Arlene Goetze, director of Catholic Women's
Network, a nonprofit educational group. "I think that's what touches
most of us."</TE>
<TE>   There are those, however, who express a contrary view. At Becker's
parole hearing in May, a Marin County prosecutor argued that the
inmate remains "extremely dangerous," saying she threatened the life
of a witness during her 1980 crime.</TE>
<TE>   And Caponio's siblings say Becker should serve more time to atone
for the killing. The murder, they say, inflicted enduring trauma on
Caponio's young son, who ran for help as his father was being shot.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, one of Caponio's sisters said she is astonished
and angered by the portrayal of Becker, in news accounts and at her
parole hearing, as a reformed, remorseful woman who "only" killed a
drug dealer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as if they're saying, 'Oh, he was dealing, so he deserved
it,' " Ann Tramutola said. "It's extremely upsetting and offensive."</TE>
<TE>   Tramutola added that while Becker's supporters take comfort in the
fact that she did not fire the fatal gunshot, Becker was in fact
convicted of first-degree murder after being portrayed at trial as
the mastermind of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "She was the instigator," Tramutola said. As for Becker's
accomplishments behind bars, she added: "Aren't people supposed to
behave in prison? Isn't that what we expect? I just think she's
manipulating all these people rallying around her."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the governor said Davis would consider input from
all sides in deciding Becker's future, as well as the circumstances
of the crime and her conduct behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   While acknowledging the voluminous support for Becker, the
spokesman, Byron Tucker, called the murder "a brutal crime."</TE>
<TE>   "Gov. Davis will try to strike a balance in making a decision,"
Tucker said. "But he's cognizant of the fact that the victim cannot
speak out from beyond the grave to let his wishes be known."</TE>
<TE>   Paroles are parceled out by the nine-member Board of Prison Terms,
appointed by the governor. Each year the board holds about 3,100
hearings for murderers, rapists and kidnappers whose sentences make
them eligible for parole. (A much smaller number of inmates convicted
of more heinous killings are ineligible for release or awaiting
execution.)</TE>
<TE>   Board members grant or deny parole after evaluating the severity
of the crime, the inmate's behavior while incarcerated and other
factors. The law suggests that parole be granted unless the prisoner
remains dangerous, but the board's discretion is broad and parole
grants are rare.</TE>
<TE>   In California -- and only two other states -- the governor has the
right to reject or approve grants of parole. Shortly after taking
office, Davis seemed to indicate that he had no intention of letting
any murderers go free, saying in an interview, "If you take someone
else's life, forget it."</TE>
<TE>   His aides insist that the statement was political hyperbole. But
critics say the governor has pursued a blanket policy against parole.
One case involving an inmate from Calabasas, Robert Rosenkrantz, who
was denied parole by Davis, was recently heard by the state Supreme
Court. A decision is expected within 60 days.</TE>
<TE>   Becker is the latest high-profile convict to land before Davis for
review. Her crime took place March 4, 1980, on Caponio's small
houseboat in Sausalito, a transcript from her parole hearing shows.
Becker, a heroin addict, had paid Caponio $60 for a fix, and -- after
being put off for a day -- returned, angry and addled by the effects
of withdrawal, to collect the drugs with another addict, Bruce Cerny.</TE>
<TE>   Once on the houseboat, the two demanded the drugs and a fight
broke out as Caponio's son ran for help, the transcript says. After a
scuffle over the gun, Cerny shot Caponio in the chest, then turned
the gun on Caponio's girlfriend, intending to kill her to eliminate
witnesses. Becker convinced him to put the gun away, but later
threatened to kill the girlfriend if she snitched, according to trial
testimony, which Becker disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Both were arrested at the scene, convicted of murder and sentenced
to life with the possibility of parole. Becker, a middle-class kid
from Milwaukee who got hooked on heroin when she moved to San
Francisco as a teenager, was 29.</TE>
<TE>   Becker is 52 now, and her supporters say she has undergone a
metamorphosis over more than two decades at the California
Institution for Women in Corona, making her a model of what the penal
system ought to produce.</TE>
<TE>   She has served as a peer counselor and reading tutor for other
inmates; led drug and alcohol recovery groups; ministered to dying
prisoners; coordinated outreach programs for schoolchildren; and
helped raise $6,000 from other inmates for victims of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   She has one disciplinary citation -- in 1994, for picking
dandelions out of bounds -- and her work supervisors give her
excellent reviews.</TE>
<TE>   The prison psychiatrist who most recently evaluated her, Dr.
Robert McDaniel, said Becker has "a great deal of insight, remorse
and empathy regarding her crime" and would not pose a danger if
released.</TE>
<TE>   All of this was laid out at Becker's three-hour parole hearing in
May. So, too, were the objections by the victim's relatives and the
Marin district attorney. Prosecutor Barry Borden said that while
Becker's clean record was "commendable," it "in no way outweighs the
callousness of this crime."</TE>
<TE>   Becker agreed that, 22 years ago, she was "a raging, maniac
addict" and a danger to others.</TE>
<TE>   "Due to my severe addiction and my failure to admit to it at the
time, I cost Rickey Caponio his life. I cost Rickey Jr. his father,"
she told the parole panel. "I can't give that back, and I don't
minimize what was taken."</TE>
<TE>   "I can only express my sincerity to you today, to continue to do
good," she said. "And never again to harm or hurt another human
being."</TE>
<TE>   The panel concluded that Becker was suitable for parole and would
not pose a risk to public safety if released.</TE>
<TE>   In granting a parole recommendation, Chairwoman Sharon Lawin cited
Becker's "positive institutional behavior," the psychiatric appraisal
and her "maturation, growth and greater understanding."</TE>
<TE>   "I wish you good luck," Lawin said.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you.... I'm so grateful," Becker replied.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Ana school board voted Thursday to rescind last week's
order to pay for an examination of petition signatures gathered to
force an election to recall trustee Nativo V. Lopez.</LD>
<LD>   In a special meeting behind closed doors, the board voted 4 to 0
to reverse that decision, which could have cost the district up to
$30,000. Lopez, who had recused himself last week, did so again
Thursday and did not attend the meeting.</LD>
<LD>   The board had come under fire after the Oct. 8 vote, which some
called a politically motivated attempt to stall the recall at
taxpayer expense.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, the Orange County Registrar of Voters certified 9,685
recall-petition signatures, about 1,000 more than the minimum needed
to put the issue on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez and his supporters, however, alleged that thousands of those
signatures were gathered illegally, either through false
representation, improper use of paid campaigners or intimidation.
Recall organizers have denied the charges.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations were forwarded to several agencies including the
district attorney's office, which ruled last week that it had found
no evidence that state election laws were broken.</TE>
<TE>   But a letter from the district attorney's office stating so did
not reach school district officials until after the Oct. 8 vote.</TE>
<TE>   "Having subsequently received the findings from the district
attorney's office, I do not believe the authorization [of funds to
examine the signatures] is appropriate," trustee Nadia Davis said
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, John Palacio and Sal Tinajero last week voted for the
examination, saying it would ensure that a recall election, which
would cost the district more than $125,000, is not voided.</TE>
<TE>   The trustees said after Thursday's meeting that given the district
attorney's finding, coupled with the possibility that the inquiry
into the signatures may cost more than the originally estimated
$30,000, they felt it best to reverse their decision.</TE>
<TE>   Palacio and Davis, viewed by many as Lopez's allies, face tough
reelection bids Nov. 5. Many of those behind Lopez's recall are
campaigning for the pair's ouster as well.</TE>
<TE>   They blame the current board majority for failing to improve the
academic performance of the 62,000-student Santa Ana Unified School
District, one of the lowest achieving and most overcrowded in the
state.</TE>
<TE>   The district, however, received some good news Thursday with the
release of the state's Academic Performance Index scores. About 65%
of Santa Ana schools met their growth targets, a number higher than
the statewide average of 53%.</TE>

<HD>Ruling Halts Work on Ojai Housing</HD>
<DH>Judge finds 23-unit, luxury condominium project violates
municipal growth plan. City official says problem 'can be fixed.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gail Davis</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Construction on a luxury condominium project in downtown Ojai has
ground to a halt after a judge found it violated the city's overall
plan for growth.</LD>
<LD>   The 23-unit Los Arboles Townhomes, planned for three acres next to
the oak trees of Libbey Park, do not meet growth-conscious Ojai's
strict traffic and construction guidelines, concluded Ventura County
Superior Court Judge Melinda A. Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   "The city can only approve the project if it complies with all
elements of the city's general plan," Johnson wrote in a decision
this week. "It does not do so."</LD>
<TE>   The judge ruled on a lawsuit filed last year against the city by
Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, an environmental group that contended
city officials broke state law when approving the project.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's ruling blocks the project -- one of four approved by the
City Council since 1993. Developers have been grading the lot for
months and putting up retaining walls in anticipation of a positive
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson found the city had abused its powers by granting Ojai
developers Lance Smigel and Lois Rice an exemption to city guidelines
that require two-story structures in the downtown area to be
separated by 45 feet.</TE>
<TE>   The council approved plans calling for some of the development's
eight large buildings to be just 25 feet apart. The judge said there
was no evidence to support such special treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "The council clearly abused its discretion in granting the
variance, and it is set aside," Johnson said. She also found that
city officials changed estimates of traffic trips from the project
without explanation.</TE>
<TE>   A separate decision on whether the project meets Ojai's housing
guidelines is expected within days.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said they consider the ruling just one volley in an
ongoing battle, and said the judge ruled against the city in only two
of eight points in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not all that simple, but it can be fixed," City Manager Dan
Singer said. The City Council will consider an appeal in closed
session Tuesday, Singer said.</TE>
<TE>   But Russ Baggerly of the Ventura County Environmental Coalition,
and an Ojai Valley resident, said the ruling kills the project.</TE>
<TE>   "We will defend [against] any appeal vigorously," Baggerly said.</TE>
<TE>   City planners will most likely recommend that the council address
problems cited in the ruling, and then send the project back to the
Planning Commission and council for reconsideration, City Atty. Monte
Widders said.</TE>
<TE>   One judicial criticism was that city officials lowered estimates
of vehicle trips from the project from 137 a day to 82 without
explanation. Similarly, the judge found the city unaccountably
changed its estimate of daily trips on clogged California 150 --
Ojai's main street -- from 18,500 a day to 23,500.</TE>
<TE>   Such changes allowed the city to claim the project would not
significantly increase traffic in the downtown area, which is more
crowded on weekends with tourist traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling also criticized the alternative projects considered for
the site by the city.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line to each alternative was that it did not meet the
developer's [economic] needs," the judge found.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said alternatives were considered but did not meet
the developer's needs and the city's need to provide so-called
"in-fill" housing near shopping and jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Because the project would replace 29 run-down cottages and
single-family homes with 23 condominiums, developers argued there
would be no net increase in traffic.</TE>
<TE>   With a growth rate of only 0.3% a year in the 1990s, Ojai's
population is still under 8,000.</TE>
<TE>   And new construction is almost nonexistent.</TE>
<TE>   Developer Rice said the decision disappoints her because the
high-density project, with units costing about $500,000, should give
anti-sprawl proponents what they want.</TE>
<TE>   "What better place to build housing," Rice said, "than in the
heart of the city where there's property available?"</TE>

<HD>Education Awards Plan Suspended</HD>
<DH>Budget crunch means schools and teachers won't get millions
of dollars they earned. New test scores show slower improvement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Duke Helfand</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Davis administration has suspended its much-touted education
awards program for this academic year, apparently stiffing more than
2,300 high-performing campuses and their teachers out of millions of
dollars in bonus money.</LD>
<LD>   Administration officials acknowledged Thursday that the state's
budget crisis has made it impossible to fund the awards -- a key
element of the state's accountability program -- which have slowly
been scaled back as economic woes have worsened.</LD>
<LD>   "It's frustrating, because you see people here put tremendous
effort into their work," said Principal Sue DiJulio of Carson Street
Elementary School in Carson, which qualified for an undetermined
amount of award money this year. "None of us are doing it for the
money, but when you're promised it, you want to get it."</LD>
<TE>   The bad news came as state officials released the latest round of
scores for the Academic Performance Index, which is based on
standardized test scores and indicates whether schools meet
state-mandated targets for improvement each year. The data, drawn
from more than 6,400 campuses this year, also determine whether
campuses face sanctions or qualify for awards.</TE>
<TE>   This year's results showed that California's public schools are
improving at a slower rate than in the past and that, had rewards
been available, fewer schools would have qualified compared to the
last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis originally envisioned the bonuses as an annual
incentive for schools and teachers to improve student performance.
Previously, schools earned tens of thousands in extra cash, and
individual teachers reaped bonuses of up to $25,000. Since the awards
programs were launched in 2000, the state has paid out nearly $822
million.</TE>
<TE>   But the budget crisis forced the state to scale back the
ambitious--if controversial--awards. Davis had proposed $207 million
in school and teacher awards this year but in negotiations with the
Legislature agreed to cut the funds to preserve other important
education programs, said Hilary McLean, a spokeswoman for the
governor. No replacement funds have been found.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to make a lot of tough choices, including deciding not to
fund a program that is near and dear to his heart," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who is seeking reelection next month, will provide schools
with certificates honoring their progress, McLean said. "The governor
is every bit as proud of schools that have made significant gains as
he has been each and every year that we've had the API as a tool to
measure improvement," she said.</TE>
<TE>   State Education Secretary Kerry Mazzoni said one possibility would
be for the Legislature to allocate money in a special session;
another would be for Davis to include new funding when he submits
next year's budget in January. But she said prospects for that are
uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   The only money currently available in the budget for awards--$144
million--is going to retroactively pay last year's winning schools,
she said. The separate $100-million bonus system just for teachers
was dropped last year for lack of money and is not expected to be
funded retroactively.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of award money has dismayed some educators.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not good news at all," said Crystal Whitley, principal of
Fontana Middle School, which had planned to use award money for new
furniture, overhead projectors and textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about losing basic things that kids and teachers
need."</TE>
<TE>   Some teachers and principals, however, said they won't miss the
award money, calling huge bonuses for individual teachers divisive
and unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   Many teachers and lawmakers said it was unfair to reward some and
not others.</TE>
<TE>   "I am glad we're not getting the money," said Nancy Sassaman, an
English teacher at Diamond Ranch High School in Pomona. "I would
rather students improved, not because schools got money, but because
they genuinely learned more."</TE>
<TE>   John Wilber, principal of Fillmore High School, said the money is
irrelevant to the more pressing goal: ensuring that all students pass
the state's new high school exit exam.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any difference in how hard our school tries on these
tests each year, with or without the economic rewards," he said.
"It's always nice to have extra money, but it doesn't make any real
difference."</TE>
<TE>   The API scores released Thursday are based on results from the
Stanford 9 exam and other standardized tests linked to new academic
standards in English-language arts.</TE>
<TE>   The results showed that 53% of schools statewide met their test
score targets this year, down from 58% last year and 72% two years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   To meet their targets, the schools must show improvement overall
as well as among separate racial and ethnic subgroups of students.
Thirty-seven percent of campuses would have qualified for awards this
year, down from 48% last year and 69% two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Mazzoni and other educators said they had expected progress to
slow as schools found it harder to raise test scores year after year.
In addition, educators said the state English-language arts standard
test--which was factored into API scores for the first time this
year--is much harder than the Stanford 9. The language arts test,
based on California's new academic standards, made it tougher for
schools to improve over last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say to everyone, 'Don't sit back on your laurels saying
you've done everything you can,' " said Charles Weis, superintendent
of Ventura County schools. "There's work to be done."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified School District defied the statewide
trend: 72% of its schools met their API targets this year. Last year,
the figure for the same schools was 67%; it was 70% two years ago.
L.A. Unified's elementary schools led the way, with 86% meeting their
growth targets, up from 81% two years ago. This increase was
expected, given the district's improved Stanford 9 test results this
year.</TE>
<TE>   District officials credited the positive showing in the elementary
grades to regimented instruction in reading and math, ongoing
coaching for teachers, regular testing to evaluate student
performance and demanding academic standards.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very strong evidence that we can get this job done if we
really focus," said Supt. Roy Romer. "What we are doing is paying
off. I'm really pleased."</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified's results, however, were not complete. It did not
receive API scores for about 80 schools, most of them elementary
campuses, because they are correcting demographic information needed
to calculate the results. The missing information is not expected to
change the district's overall results dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, more than 1,000 schools did not get scores because they
are correcting demographic information or because of testing
irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   The state data revealed that most of the schools in California at
risk of state sanctions will escape that fate this year because they
showed at least marginal growth in test scores.</TE>
<TE>   Only 22 schools--out of nearly 400--will face some discipline,
from having to be evaluated by outside experts to having teachers
reassigned to letting independent managers take over.</TE>
<TE>   State officials will decide over the next three months what action
to take with each school.</TE>

<HD>Breakup: Too Big vs. Too Risky?</HD>
<DH>Pro- and anti-secession forces put forth their best
arguments in vigorous debate as election looms. An audience of 100
attends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy and Sharon Bernstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two sides in the secession campaign clashed Thursday night in a
spirited debate, with supporters of a breakup arguing that Los
Angeles is too big and ungainly to serve its residents well, and foes
claiming that splitting up the city would carry too many
uncertainties.</LD>
<LD>   The debate at the Universal City Hilton was held less than three
weeks before voters decide whether the San Fernando Valley and
Hollywood should break from Los Angeles and become their own cities.</LD>
<LD>   With a Times poll this week indicating secession is opposed 2 to 1
by likely voters citywide, Valley cityhood leaders such as Richard
Close sought to sharpen their message during the 90-minute debate.</LD>
<TE>   "This is all about services," said Close. "New York has 40,000
[police] officers for a smaller area. We are not getting the services
we pay for." Los Angeles has about 9,000 officers.</TE>
<TE>   He was joined on the pro-secession side by Valley Independence
Committee member Bob Scott and former state Assemblywoman Paula
Boland, who is running for city council in the proposed Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   "The Valley still feels disenfranchised," said Boland. Valley
residents "feel they can scream at their City Council members and
still not be heard."</TE>
<TE>   The anti-secession side was represented by City Controller Laura
Chick and City Council members Cindy Miscikowski and Eric Garcetti.
Chick said the city is improving services, and voters should give
ongoing reforms such as neighborhood councils a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "There are too many unknowns," Chick said of secession. "There are
not really substantive plans being proposed. Change for change's sake
is not necessarily the best way to go."</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski, whose district included a large part of the south

<TE>   "We are seeing better services," she added.</TE>

<HD>Debate Flares as Secession Vote Looms</HD>
<DH>Each side puts forth its best arguments -- too big vs. too
risky -- for an audience of just 100.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy and Sharon Bernstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two sides in the secession campaign clashed Thursday night in a
spirited debate, with supporters of a breakup arguing that Los
Angeles is too big and ungainly to serve its residents well, and foes
claiming that splitting up the city would carry too many
uncertainties.</LD>
<LD>   The debate at the Universal City Hilton was held less than three
weeks before voters decide whether the San Fernando Valley and
Hollywood should break from Los Angeles and become their own cities.</LD>
<LD>   With a Times poll this week indicating secession is opposed 2-1 by
likely voters citywide, Valley cityhood leaders such as Richard Close
sought to sharpen their message during the 90-minute debate.</LD>
<TE>   "This is all about services," said Close. "New York has 40,000
[police] officers for a smaller area. We are not getting the services
we pay for." Los Angeles has about 9,000 officers.</TE>
<TE>   He was joined on the pro-secession side by Valley Independence
Committee member Bob Scott and former state Assemblywoman Paula
Boland, who is running for council in the proposed Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   "The Valley still feels disenfranchised," said Boland. Valley
residents "feel they can scream at their City Council members and
still not be heard."</TE>
<TE>   The anti-secession side was represented by City Controller Laura
Chick and City Council members Cindy Miscikowski and Eric Garcetti.
Chick said the city is improving services, and voters should give
ongoing reforms such as neighborhood councils a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "There are too many unknowns," Chick said of secession. "There are
not really substantive plans being proposed. Change for change's sake
is not necessarily the best way to go."</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski, whose district included a large part of the south
Valley before redistricting shifted it to the Westside, said the
secession campaign is a "wake-up call for those who were elected last
year ... who said, 'We are going to do things differently.' "</TE>
<TE>   "We are seeing better services," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti, who represents part of Hollywood, said voters should not
be fooled into believing secession would break up the Los Angeles
Unified School District. "We are not voting on a breakup of the
LAUSD, pure and simple."</TE>
<TE>   But Close said new cities would have influence in Sacramento that
could lead to a split of the school district.</TE>
<TE>   He also predicted that if secession fails in the Nov. 5 election,
the city will end its efforts to improve services, and that
neighborhood councils will still lack clout.</TE>
<TE>   "When they set up neighborhood councils, they gave them no
authority to do anything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Close added that if the cityhood measures lose, they will be
resurrected in the near future. But the longtime secession backer
said a revived campaign would not include him.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't have the fire to start over again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The debate was organized by the Los Angeles Police Protective
League. The police officers union, a leading secession opponent, is
running radio commercials that claim a split could jeopardize public
safety.</TE>
<TE>   The event drew just 100 people in a ballroom with a capacity for
2,000.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Thursday, several Valley city council and mayoral
candidates said that, if elected, they would support the campaign
finance reform system known as "clean money" for the new
municipality.</TE>
<TE>   Under such a system, candidates who prove they have grass-roots
support receive funding from the city or state, but must not engage
in private fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates whose opponents do not participate in the voluntary
system receive the same amount of money the opponents raise, up to a
predetermined cap.</TE>
<TE>   It is an issue close to the hearts of many cityhood supporters,
whose campaign has been massively outspent by secession opponents led
by Mayor James K. Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Secession "is our one glorious chance to get clean money in Los
Angeles," said Terry Stone, a candidate for the 10th Valley council
district.</TE>
<TE>   Clean money "levels the playing field," said painting contractor
Jerry Hayes.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Thursday, Valley council candidate Frank Sheftel, a candy
maker in the 12th District, launched a cable television commercial.</TE>
<TE>   Made with donated labor, the 30-second spot features several
Valley candidates and Sheftel's mother pointing to her son's campaign
signs and asking, "Who the hell is Frank Sheftel?"</TE>
<TE>   Sheftel comes on at the end and introduces himself.</TE>

<HD>Swallowed by Urban Sprawl</HD>
<DH>Relocating to Inland Empire puts people in the midst of
what they fled, researchers find.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Gold and Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>RIVERSIDE</DL>
<LD>The Inland Empire, overwhelmed by unchecked growth and plagued by
helter-skelter development, is by far the nation's worst example of
urban sprawl, a team of researchers said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   For 20 years, the price of homes closer to the coast has
skyrocketed, forcing hundreds of thousands of families to search
inland for affordable housing. Many landed -- in Riverside or San
Bernardino, Corona or Ontario -- with the hope that they had left
behind the ills of urban life.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the study says, they have found themselves in a far-flung
dystopia, a region whose schools and roads cannot keep up with the
number of new residents, a sea of strip malls and chain restaurants,
all surrounded by just as much traffic, pollution and congestion as
they confronted in the city.</LD>
<TE>   The three-year study was conducted by researchers from Rutgers and
Cornell universities and released by a Washington coalition of
organizations interested in growth, known as Smart Growth America.</TE>
<TE>   The report faulted the Inland Empire for everything from its lack
of economic and social cores -- two-thirds of the massive region
lives at least 10 miles from a central business district -- to a
haphazard, poorly connected road system that makes walking and
bicycling perilous.</TE>
<TE>   Even the region's high number of traffic fatalities -- 49 of every
100,000 people die each year in car crashes -- is due to endless
hours spent negotiating highways and packed, high-speed arterials,
the study concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara McCann, a spokeswoman for Smart Growth America, said the
Inland Empire fits the dreaded metropolitan tag: "There is no 'there'
there."</TE>
<TE>   Home building and economic development organizations, which have
defeated several recent attempts to limit growth in the Inland
Empire, disputed the study's results.</TE>
<TE>   "I would call it a blatant joke," said Borre Winckel, executive
director of the Building Industry Assn.'s Riverside County chapter.
"I am not impressed by it."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday afternoon in Chino Hills, on the western rim of San
Bernardino County, scores of people were having lunch at tables
assembled in front of what passes for a central gathering place -- a
giant strip mall called Crossroads Marketplace. It features a Costco,
a Sport Chalet, a mattress store and an enormous Lowe's Home
Improvement Warehouse emblazoned with a slogan: "More of Everything."</TE>
<TE>   At one of the tables, Clysta Keller, 57, sat reading a book.
Keller said she and her family moved from Orange County to nearby
Mira Loma 20 years ago after her husband retired from the military,
largely because they could afford a nice home there on a third of an
acre. Back then, it was a quaint country home. Now it is in the midst
of perpetual construction and giant warehouse operations.</TE>
<TE>   The Inland Empire, weary of being a dormitory for the rest of
Southern California, has tried to create more local jobs, and Keller
has one of them, in Lowe's administration office. It still takes her
at least 35 minutes to drive 17 miles to work.</TE>
<TE>   Like many others, she said she found it difficult to reconcile how
there can be so much stuff in the Inland Empire, yet so little to do.
Even a highly anticipated soccer academy that was built near her home
failed because of a lack of attendance, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel most sorry for the children growing up here," she said,
recalling the difficulty she had finding things for her children to
do when they were younger.</TE>
<TE>   "The politicians like the idea of more people moving here. But
they aren't taking care of the schools, or the traffic -- or even
thinking of things for the children to do."</TE>
<TE>   Using a 'Sprawlometer'</TE>
<TE>   The Oxnard-Ventura region ranks ninth in urban sprawl, according
to the study.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles-Long Beach, San Diego and Sacramento metropolitan
regions all registered slightly better than 100, or average, on the
"sprawlometer."</TE>
<TE>   Such growth is difficult to measure, the researchers pointed out.
It is akin, they said, to former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter
Stewart's famous view on pornography -- it's hard to define, but we
know it when we see it. Previous studies have typically used limited
and subjective data to analyze it, often relying almost entirely on
density as their primary yardstick.</TE>
<TE>   In the new study, researchers spent three years developing a
four-category measure of sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   In 83 metropolitan regions representing half of the nation's
population, the researchers used 22 demographic databases to
calibrate density of development; the blend of homes, jobs and
services; the accessibility of streets; and the strength of downtown
areas and other "activity centers."</TE>
<TE>   To the cynic, it might seem that each category was devised atop a
bluff in Temecula, where the population doubled between 1990 and
2000, or along California 71, home to rows and rows of
Spanish-tile-roofed homes built with stunning efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   The Riverside-San Bernardino region scored poorly in every
category except density of development, in which the region was below
average -- a vestige of older developments that featured larger lots.</TE>
<TE>   The result: Riverside-San Bernardino scored 14.2 on the
sprawlometer. A score of 100 is average, researchers said, and the
lower the score, the worse the attendant problems are.</TE>
<TE>   The Inland Empire was the only metropolitan area that scored lower
than 45. It far outpaced the second- and third-place finishers, both
in North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty bad commentary," said Philip Lohman, executive
director of the Los Angeles-based Endangered Habitats League, an
environmental organization that helped with the study. Lohman spent
his teenage years in Redlands, in San Bernardino County, then earned
three degrees at UC Riverside before moving to Lakewood. "We can't
undo the damage that's been done. All we can do is protect what
remains," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Looking for Solutions</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County Supervisor Tom Mullen said such an effort is well
underway. For three years, Mullen and other Inland Empire leaders
have pieced together what they say is the nation's most ambitious
metropolitan development plan. It includes, Mullen said, a
$13-billion plan for four new highways, including a new connector to
Orange County, and a proposal to set aside 550,000 acres of open
space and animal habitat in western Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing is that we recognized that there was a
serious problem and that we needed to find an innovative way to deal
with it," Mullen said. "We know it is out there. And we are trying to
fix it."</TE>
<TE>   Colleen Smethers, a retired nurse practitioner in Mira Loma,
doesn't buy it. She said the Inland Empire is being built backward --
houses first, then stores, then infrastructure such as roads and
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "They call it the blueprint for the future," Smethers said. "They
think we are so stupid that we believe it. That's the part that's so
hard to swallow. We live here in this little country place,
supposedly out of the city. And we have big rig traffic on my
street.... We are choking out here."</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, a primary section of the metropolitan area that ranked
ninth in the study, several residents defended their lifestyle
Thursday -- and the "small town" atmosphere they say exists in their
community.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in front of the home that he and his wife bought last
year in Oxnard's Aldea del Mar tract, Jeff Starr, a critical-care
nurse, cited the positive side of growth: People have some elbow
room, some distance between themselves and other people, droning
freeways and belching buses.</TE>
<TE>   "You work in a high-stress job and you come home and you don't
want to be bothered by noise and commotion outside," Starr said.</TE>
<TE>   Starr's mother lives in Riverside County, and "every time we drive
somewhere, we see stuff that wasn't there the time before," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But, he asked, "What are you going to do? People gotta live
somewhere."</TE>

<TE>10 worst cases of urban sprawl</TE>
<TE>A report released Thursday rates the Riverside-San Bernardino area as
the nation's worst example of urban sprawl. Each metropolitan region
received an index score that reflects a combination of 22 measures,
such as poorly connected streets and the lack of economic and social
centers. A score of 100 is average. The lower the score, the worse
the problems associated with urban sprawl.</TE>

<HD>Lawyers Urged to Make a Long Story Short</HD>
<DH>Judges, frustrated by attorneys' long-winded written legal

<LD>"Not that the story need be long, but it will take a long time to
make it short."</LD>
<LD>   -- Henry David Thoreau</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Federal prosecutor Patrick O'Toole had a lot he wanted to say in
his petition for a new hearing in a drug case -- so much to say, in
fact, that he couldn't fathom keeping his arguments to the 15 pages
allotted for such briefs by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   So O'Toole, like many other lawyers who have trouble cutting their
prose, sent in his long brief with a request for permission to file
it.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit was not accommodating.</TE>
<TE>   Permission "to file a fat brief," a three-judge panel wrote, "will
be granted only upon a showing of diligence and substantial need."</TE>
<TE>   The court concluded its four-page order by tossing out O'Toole's
petition and demanding that he resubmit it in a more succinct form.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit panel's stance is similar to those of many courts
around the country. To keep long-winded lawyers at bay, they have set
many rules to limit written arguments.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, lawyers faced only page requirements. But when
computers became common, judges found crafty lawyers resorting to
tiny type and skimpy margins to squeeze ever more words onto a page.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only did you have more stuff to read, it was harder to read
it," said 9th Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski, who was on the panel that
rejected O'Toole's brief. "Lawyers don't quite realize what it is
like to read briefs all the time and how much of a strain it is."</TE>
<TE>   New requirements have followed, specifying everything from the
size of the type to the color of cover sheets.</TE>
<TE>   The California Supreme Court, for example, requires a petition for
review -- the initial appeal -- to be filed with 13 copies, each
bound in a white manuscript cover and each including the Court of
Appeal decision the party is appealing.</TE>
<TE>   The limit is 30 pages, excluding the table of contents, the table
of authorities and the Court of Appeal opinion. Margins must be 1.5
inches on the sides, 1 inch on top and bottom. Type may not be
smaller than 13 points -- slightly more than one-third larger than
the type in this article.</TE>
<TE>   In the 9th Circuit, the same sort of petition is called a notice
of appeal. It must be filed with 15 copies, each with a blue cover.
It is limited to 14,000 words with 14-point type, or 30 pages, if it
is written in a type size that allows 10.5 characters for each inch.</TE>
<TE>   Though such requirements may seem picky, virtually everyone agrees
that limiting lawyerly verbiage is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "There really have to be rules, because if you just let lawyers go
on, think what you would get," said UC Berkeley law professor Stephen
Barnett. "Lawyers, not unlike any other writer, would run on
excessively because they figure the more words they can use, the more
persuasive they can be."</TE>
<TE>   Not that Barnett, who takes private civil cases, is always a model
of brevity himself.</TE>
<TE>   "You have touched a sore subject," he said, "because I have right
in front of me an overlong brief that we are going to have to ask the
court for leave to file."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how long the brief was, Barnet demurred. "I don't want to
talk about it."</TE>
<TE>   O'Toole also did not want to talk about the court order that
rejected his voluminous brief. Did he find the order amusing?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that I found it as funny as some," said the San
Diego-based assistant U.S. attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he had experienced similar rejections by other courts,
O'Toole said he could not remember. "I don't know," he said. "I don't
think it is something that happens often."</TE>
<TE>   In rejecting O'Toole's request for extra pages earlier this year,
the 9th Circuit recounted the prosecutor's insistence that anything
shorter was impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "Counsel advises us that his original draft was 30 pages long,"
the court said in the 3-0 ruling. O'Toole had stressed that he even
had sought help from other lawyers to reduce the petition's length to
the 19 pages he submitted.</TE>
<TE>   With the brief still 1,305 words -- or four pages -- too long, the
court dryly observed: "We gather these efforts were not entirely
successful."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling then quoted O'Toole: "I believe that this is as short
as the petition can reasonably be and still do justice to the
important and difficult issues raised in this appeal."</TE>
<TE>   But the court disagreed. To justify exceeding the length
requirement, "counsel must show that the additional space is
justified by something unusual about the issues presented, the
record, the applicable case law or some other aspect of the case,"
the court responded.</TE>
<TE>   "Counsel has shown nothing of the sort; nor is it self-evident
what this something might be."</TE>
<TE>   The court concluded: "We have every confidence that when the
United States Department of Justice applies its formidable resources
to the problem, it will come up with a petition for rehearing that
complies with all our rules, yet presents the government's position
elegantly and forcefully."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling was unsigned, but anyone familiar with Kozinski's
writing would know that he had written it.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1992 law review article, Kozinski wrote that a "fat brief"
shows a lawyer has "a rotten case" and lacks an argument "capable of
being presented in simple, direct, persuasive fashion."</TE>
<TE>   Kozinski said in an interview that one of his favorite briefs was
written by a lawyer in Bellevue, Wash. The brief was short with wide
margins. "The white space is more important than the black stuff,"
Kozinski said.</TE>
<TE>   Although most lawyers don't realize it, keeping briefs brief is
usually an advantage in a case, judges say. One good point may be
obscured if the lawyer throws in five others.</TE>
<TE>   "The thrust of an argument can be lost in excessive verbiage,"
California Chief Justice Ronald M. George said.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing the problem, law schools these days stress writing
instruction. At Syracuse University College of Law, a full-time
writing program has been established to help would-be lawyers write
effectively. Succinct writing is emphasized.</TE>
<TE>   "Judges are very busy, and I think they appreciate a brief that
gets right to the point and makes a persuasive argument," said Daan
Braveman, former dean of the law school.</TE>
<TE>   There is no length requirement for judicial rulings, however, and
some lawyers believe judges should practice more of the brevity they
preach.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett, for example, regularly chastises the California Supreme
Court in legal newspapers and magazines for its "excessively long"
opinions.</TE>
<TE>   But Kozinski said no one is required to read judicial opinions
from beginning to end, whereas judges must read the briefs to decide
the cases before them. Kozinski favors keeping rulings short, though.</TE>
<TE>   "The more you say, the more likely people are going to cite things
out of context," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, Kozinski's stinginess with words makes for unusually
pithy writing.</TE>
<TE>   In dismissing a complaint about a hit record called "Barbie Girl,"
in which Mattel Inc. argued that the name of its doll had been used
unlawfully, Kozinski concluded with a blunt, six-word directive that
Barbie herself might have written.</TE>
<TE>   "The parties," he wrote, "are advised to chill."</TE>

<HD>Safety Rules for TV News Vans Are OKd</HD>
<DH>The state regulations were prompted by an accident that
injured an L.A. reporter.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's first safety rules for television news crews were
approved Thursday by state officials, two years after an accident
severely burned and paralyzed a Los Angeles TV reporter.</LD>
<LD>   Regulations enacted by the California Occupational and Heath
Standards Board are designed to prevent TV crews from accidentally
raising microwave antennas into overhead power lines at the scene of
news events.</LD>
<LD>   News vans will be required to have a "constant pressure" switch
that will force broadcast workers to stand where they can see the
antenna as they press the mast's lift button.</LD>
<TE>   The trucks also must be equipped with nighttime mast lights,
warning signs and an audible alarm that sounds if the van is driven
with the mast extended.</TE>
<TE>   Five Los Angeles-area television unions pressed for the
regulations after KABC-TV reporter Adrienne Alpert was injured when
her news van's antenna was raised into a 19,980-volt electric line
along Santa Monica Boulevard in May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules will take effect 30 days after final review by
lawyers, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   They also will mandate training for news crews and supervisors,
something that may make "management more sensitive to the time
pressures and dangers news crews face every day," said Gena Stinnett,
a KABC-TV videotape editor and president of the local branch of the
National Assn. of Broadcast Employees and Technicians.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 microwave vans in California will be covered by the
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to do everything possible to prevent what happened to
Adrienne from ever happening again," said Leslie Simon, a
representative of the American Federation of Television and Radio
Artists.</TE>

<HD>Study Assails Ventura County Sprawl</HD>
<DH>The survey, which ranks the region ninth in the nation,
points to a lack of prosperous city downtowns. But it wasn't all bad
news.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Gold and Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lack of town centers makes Ventura County one of the most sprawling
areas in the nation, according to a new study of unchecked suburban
growth.</LD>
<LD>   The Riverside-San Bernardino area scored highest on the study's
"sprawlometer" that gauged how well housing, jobs and roadways fit
together in 83 metropolitan areas.</LD>
<LD>   Billed as the first scientific survey of "urban sprawl," the
three-year study concludes that in one critical way -- the lack of
prosperous city downtowns -- Ventura County has fallen short. The
project was carried out by researchers at Rutgers and Cornell
universities.</LD>
<TE>   As thousands of families have moved out of big cities in search of
cheaper homes, cleaner air and safer streets, the study concludes,
they have found themselves in regions where schools and roads cannot
keep up with the number of new residents -- in a sea of strip malls
and chain restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   The study ranked Ventura County as the nation's ninth most
sprawling area, but the report wasn't all bad news.</TE>
<TE>   "The funny thing is, I think it shows us that although we're in
the top 10 nationally, we're doing better than we think," said Bill
Fulton, a Ventura resident and a national planning expert.</TE>
<TE>   The county's neighborhoods are fairly compact and its streets
relatively easy to get to and navigate. The county has an especially
healthy mix of homes, jobs and services. What is lacking in Ventura
County, and in most of California's suburban areas, is a core, the
study found.</TE>
<TE>   "We have density, but we don't have centeredness," Fulton said.
And creating centers of activity -- for commerce, government, culture
-- is "one of the most difficult things to create after the fact," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo, where Peter and Toni La Joy live, has one of Ventura
County's more defined town centers. But it's no Chicago, where the
couple grew up.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to sell everything and move back to Chicago," Toni said
Thursday, as she and her husband toured a tract home in Oxnard. "I
love the city. I love the shopping. And I have all my family there."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard is "sprawl city," Peter said.</TE>
<TE>   The study was released by a Washington coalition of organizations
interested in growth, known as Smart Growth America.</TE>
<TE>   It concluded that the Inland Empire -- one of the nation's largest
experiments in megasuburbia -- has failed most miserably in
clustering its growth.</TE>
<TE>   The report faulted the Inland Empire for everything from its lack
of economic and social cores -- two-thirds of the massive region
lives at least 10 miles from a central business district -- to a
haphazard, poorly connected road system that makes walking and
bicycling perilous.</TE>
<TE>   Even the region's high number of traffic fatalities -- 49 of every
100,000 people die each year in car crashes -- is due to endless
hours spent negotiating highways and packed, high-speed arterials,
the study concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara McCann, a spokeswoman for Smart Growth America, said the
Inland Empire fits the dreaded metropolitan tag: "There is no 'there'
there."</TE>
<TE>   Home building and economic development organizations, which have
defeated several recent attempts to limit growth in the Inland
Empire, disputed the results of the study.</TE>
<TE>   "I would call it a blatant joke," said Borre Winckel, executive
director of the Building Industry Assn.'s Riverside County chapter. "
... I am not impressed by it."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in California, the Los Angeles-Long Beach, San Diego and
Sacramento metropolitan regions all registered slightly better than
average on the "sprawlometer."</TE>
<TE>   Such growth is difficult to measure, the researchers said. It is
akin, they said, to former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter
Stewart's famous view on pornography -- it's hard to define, but we
know it when we see it. Previous studies have typically used limited
and subjective data to analyze it, often relying almost entirely on
density as their primary yardstick.</TE>
<TE>   In the new study, researchers spent three years developing a
four-category measure of sprawl. In 83 metropolitan regions
representing half the nation's population, the researchers used 22
demographic databases to calibrate density of development: the blend
of homes, jobs and services; the accessibility of streets, and the
strength of downtown areas and other "activity centers."</TE>
<TE>   The Riverside-San Bernardino region scored poorly in every
category except density of development, in which the region was below
average -- a vestige of older developments that featured larger lots.</TE>
<TE>   The result: Riverside-San Bernardino scored 14.2 on the
"sprawlometer." Ventura County scored 75.1. A score of 100 is
average, researchers said, and the lower the score, the worse the
attendant problems. The Inland Empire was the only metropolitan area
that scored lower than 45. It far outpaced the second- and
third-place finishers, both in North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty bad commentary," said Philip Lohman, executive
director of the Los Angeles-based Endangered Habitats League, an
environmental organization that helped with the study. Lohman spent
his teenage years in Redlands, in San Bernardino County, and earned
three degrees at UC Riverside before moving to Lakewood.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't undo the damage that's been done. All we can do is
protect what remains," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County Supervisor Tom Mullen said such an effort is well
under way. For three years, Mullen and other Inland Empire leaders
have pieced together what they say is the nation's most ambitious
metropolitan development plan.</TE>
<TE>   It includes, Mullen said, a $13-billion plan for four new
highways, including a new connector to Orange County, and a proposal
to set aside 550,000 acres of open space and animal habitat in
western Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing is that we recognized that there was a
serious problem and that we needed to find an innovative way to deal
with it," Mullen said. "We know it is out there. And we are trying to
fix it."</TE>
<TE>   Colleen Smethers, a retired nurse practitioner in Mira Loma,
doesn't buy it. She said the Inland Empire is being built backward --
houses first, then stores, then infrastructure such as roads and
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "They call it the blueprint for the future," Smethers said. "They
think we are so stupid that we believe it. That's the part that's so
hard to swallow. We live here in this little country place,
supposedly out of the city. And we have big rig traffic on my
street....We are choking out here."</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, a primary section of the metropolitan area that ranked
ninth in the study, several residents defended their lifestyle
Thursday. Standing in front of the home that he and his wife bought
last year in Oxnard's Aldea del Mar tract, Jeff Starr, a
critical-care nurse, cited the positive side of growth: People have
some elbow room, and some distance between themselves and other
people, droning freeways and belching buses.</TE>
<TE>   "You work in a high-stress job and you come home and you don't
want to be bothered by noise and commotion outside," Starr said.</TE>
<TE>   Starr's mother lives in Riverside County, and "every time we drive
somewhere, we see stuff that wasn't there the time before," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As in parts of Ventura County, the houses stack up beside the
freeways, but, he asked, "What are you going to do? People gotta live
somewhere."</TE>

<HD>North Star State Points the Way on Voting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joan Anderson Growe</AU>
<BD>Joan Anderson Growe was Minnesota secretary of state
from 1975 to 1999.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MINNEAPOLIS -- In 1974, the year I was elected Minnesota's secretary
of state, my state was the first in the nation to implement
election-day registration. Over 24 years in office, I supervised a
registration process that consistently gave our state the highest
voter turnout rate in the nation, with no increase in election fraud.</LD>
<LD>   On Nov. 5, voters in California will decide on election-day voter
registration. If Proposition 52 passes, California will join six
other states that have made improving voter participation a top
priority.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-eight years ago, we heard a lot of the same scare tactics
Californians are hearing today about the possible perils of same-day
registration. They didn't materialize. We've dealt with lines at the
polls by increasing the numbers of election workers. Welcoming more
voters at the polls is a "problem" we're happy to have.</LD>
<TE>   In Minnesota, we have a few voter fraud cases every year, but no
more than we did before the election reform was put in place.
California's Proposition 52 actually increases election security by
raising fines for fraud and making conspiracy to commit election
fraud a crime. The measure also requires last-minute voters to
present valid identification and proof of residency, something that
is not currently required.</TE>
<TE>   But the real reason California voters should say yes to
election-day registration is that it will increase turnout. In the
six states that now allow same-day registration, voter turnout has
increased by as much as 6%. California, with a high percentage of
voters who are young and highly mobile, can expect an even greater
increase.</TE>
<TE>   With a two-step registration process, young voters too often don't
make the effort. We need to do everything we can to get these young
people invested in our democracy and involved in our communities.
Research shows that voters are more likely to volunteer with schools
and civic groups.</TE>
<TE>   After years of proven success, election-day registration is simply
not an issue in Minnesota anymore, except when someone criticizes it.
Politicians and citizens from all parties -- and those who are
independent of any affiliation -- are proud of Minnesota's pioneering
role in election reform and even prouder of our first-place finish in
voter participation.</TE>
<TE>   California doesn't have to be afraid of same-day voter
registration. Election experts predict that the reform would bring
nearly 2 million more voters to the polls. That can only be good for
our democracy and good for California.</TE>

<HD>A Bombshell That's Actually an Olive Branch</HD>
<DH>In acknowledging its nuclear program, N. Korea opens door
to negotiations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leon V. Sigal</AU>
<BD>Leon V. Sigal is director of the Northeast Asia
Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Research Council
in New York and the author of "Disarming Strangers: Nuclear Diplomacy
With North Korea" (Princeton University Press, 1998).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What is going on in North Korea? First, the regime admitted in
September that it had abducted Japanese citizens in the 1970s and
1980s. Then, in talks with Assistant Secretary of State James A.
Kelly two weeks ago, it acknowledged what U.S. intelligence had long
suspected, that it has a covert program to enrich uranium, the
explosive ingredient in nuclear arms.</LD>
<LD>   In the first case, its admission opened the way to normalization
talks with Japan. With this new disclosure, Pyongyang wants to cut a
deal with Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Hard-liners in the Bush administration may want to use that
"confession" to punish the regime in North Korea, but more
sober-minded officials know that the crime-and-punishment approach
will not work.</LD>
<TE>   North Korea is no Iraq. It wants to end its lifelong enmity with
the United States and has demonstrated its readiness to give up its
nuclear, missile and other arms programs in return. By acknowledging
its covert nuclear program -- after being confronted with U.S.
evidence -- Pyongyang is putting it on the negotiating table.
Washington should take up Pyongyang's invitation to diplomatic
give-and-take.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s, North Korea's longtime ruler, Kim Il Sung,
decided he had no better way to provide for its security than to
improve relations with the U.S., South Korea and Japan. When
Washington, determined to put a stop to Pyongyang's nuclear arming
before easing its isolation, impeded closer ties to South Korea and
Japan, Pyongyang decided to barter its nuclear arms program for
better relations. However, it kept its nuclear option open as
leverage on Washington to live up to its end of the bargain. It is
still doing so.</TE>
<TE>   That became the basis of the October 1994 Agreed Framework,
whereby the North agreed to freeze and eventually dismantle its
nuclear arms program. That accord did not explicitly cover uranium
enrichment, but it would provide the basis for negotiating an end to
the uranium program as well.</TE>
<TE>   When Republicans took control of Congress in elections just weeks
later, they denounced the deal as appeasement. Unwilling to challenge
Congress, the Clinton administration backpedaled on implementation.
When the U.S. was slow to fulfill the terms of the 1994 accord, North
Korea threatened to break it.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Pyongyang also aimed to try again to end enmity,
this time using its missiles as inducement. That effort culminated in
2000 with Kim Jong Il's offer to end exports of all missile
technology and to freeze testing, production and deployment of all
missiles with a range of 300 miles or more.</TE>
<TE>   Pyongyang's tough bargaining tactics has led hard-liners in the
Bush administration to conclude that it is engaging in blackmail to
obtain economic aid, without giving up anything in return. It is not.
It is cooperating when the U.S. cooperates and retaliating when the
U.S. reneges.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing that, South Korea and Japan have moved to reconcile
with North Korea, opening the way to negotiations to improve their
security.</TE>
<TE>   Pyongyang now wants to make a deal with Washington. On Aug. 29,
Undersecretary of State John Bolton accused North Korea of having "an
active program" of chemical weapons, "one of the most robust
bio-weapons programs on Earth," being "the world's foremost peddler
of ballistic missile-related equipment, components, materials and
technical expertise" and not allowing international inspectors "to
complete all of their required tasks."</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 31, a North Korean foreign ministry spokesman responded by
citing all the concerns raised by Bolton and adding: "The DPRK [North
Korea] clarified more than once that if the U.S. has a will to drop
its hostile policy toward the DPRK, it will have dialogue with the
U.S. to clear the U.S. of its worries over its security."</TE>
<TE>   By threatening Pyongyang, the hard-liners could provoke a replay
of the 1994 nuclear crisis that put Korea on the brink of war. Then,
as now, the U.S. had three options: impose sanctions, which were
rightly deemed unlikely to be effective in curbing the North's
nuclear program; attack the North's nuclear sites; or negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. saber rattling is sure to alienate South Korea and Japan and
antagonize China. And how can nuclear sites be attacked if their
whereabouts are unknown? By refusing to negotiate, the administration
would leave itself with no other option than to live with a
nuclear-armed North Korea.</TE>

<HD>Jolt to Australia's Sense of Immunity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gerard Wright</AU>
<BD>Gerard Wright, an Australian freelance journalist,
lives in Denver.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A ripple crosses a small sea faster than a mighty ocean.</LD>
<LD>   This ripple was in fact a shock wave. Its epicenter last weekend
was Bali. It traveled instantaneously across the Timor Sea, and in
Australia it felt as though it touched everything in its path.</LD>
<LD>   There may be at least 119 Australians among the 200 or more
fatalities of the bombing of the Sari bar and nightclub. They were
honeymooners, jilted brides, mothers, fathers, children, surfers,
footballers and travelers. In a country as lightly populated as
Australia -- with 19 million people it is only a little larger than
Greater Los Angeles -- their situations were familiar, even if their
names were not.</LD>
<TE>   There is the daughter of Dawn, a friend and neighbor of my
parents, who suffered second-degree burns to 80% of her body.</TE>
<TE>   There were the eight women from Victoria, friends who would all
turn 40 this year. They decided to mark the occasion in Bali. Three
were killed. Another is missing.</TE>
<TE>   Bali is to Australians what Cabo San Lucas is to many
Californians: a tropical haven, close enough and cheap enough to be
accessible, just foreign enough to be exotic, just similar enough to
be comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   On the eastern side of the archipelago that is Indonesia, Bali was
"discovered," as it were, by Australian surfers in the late 1960s.
The rest of the population gradually followed. Within 15 years, a
holiday there had become such a middle-class travel cliche that the
Australian rock group Redgum would derisively sing, "Been there done
that / I've been to Bali too."</TE>
<TE>   For the sports of rugby and Australian football, the October
end-of-season trip is both rite of passage and minor bacchanal. In
Bali last weekend, Australian football was represented by the
great--including Jason McCartney of the North Melbourne Club--and not
so great--including the Kingsley Football Club, an amateur team from
Perth.</TE>
<TE>   McCartney, who was in a bar across the road from the Sari, has
burns over half of his body and a shrapnel wound in his back. The
Kingsley club may have lost seven players. Corey Paltridge, 21, the
only one whose body has been positively identified, was playing air
guitar on the dance floor to a song made popular by the Australian
band AC/DC when the second and larger bomb exploded.</TE>
<TE>   The Coogee Beach Dolphins from Sydney lost five players. The
Platypii of Forbes in western New South Wales left three teammates on
the island.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday will be a day of national mourning. That is not something
Australians have had much practice at in our 214 years of national
history.</TE>
<TE>   Though we contribute willingly to the security of other countries,
only once before, in World War II, has our own sense of immunity from
attack been compromised.</TE>
<TE>   The day of mourning will include a nationwide minute of silence at
midday. Prime Minister John Howard suggested that Australians wear a
sprig of wattle, a golden native blossom, as "a single unifying
tribute" to the fallen.</TE>
<TE>   But the Australian spring has been unseasonably warm, and the
wattles have mostly come and gone. The bloom is off that flower too.</TE>

<KH>ELECTION RECOMMENDATION</KH>
<HD>Vote Yes for Trauma Care</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County Measure B is a swallow-your-medicine tax increase
that comes with no sweeteners to ease its passage, not even a
guarantee that the money raised for trauma and emergency care would
keep all the county's beleaguered hospitals open. But the treatment,
however uncertain, is better than the alternative -- doing nothing
and waiting for the entire system to collapse.</LD>
<LD>   The measure would authorize the county to levy a parcel tax of 3
cents per square foot on homes, office buildings and other developed
properties, costing the owner of a 1,500-square-foot house $45 a
year. The $170 million raised would be earmarked for trauma and
emergency medical services as well as for a new, post-9/11
responsibility -- bioterrorism readiness.</LD>
<LD>   Given the traditional antipathy toward taxes and the number of
other measures sharing the Nov. 5 ballot, even $4 a month is a tough
sell, especially for a service no one thinks about until he or she
suffers a car accident, a heart attack or an anthrax scare.</LD>
<TE>   Anyone, rich or poor, insured or not, can need emergency care.
Providing that care is a money-loser. Even private insurance doesn't
fully cover the costs. Hemorrhaging money, so many emergency
departments have closed in the last 15 years that the system is
already stretched perilously thin, increasing waits and diverting
ambulances.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of Measure B argue that the county could find money by
cutting costs elsewhere or by asking for federal and state help. They
underestimate the enormity of the need. The overburdened, underfunded
emergency system is but one symptom of a larger health-care crisis.
Los Angeles County's uninsured rate is twice the national average and
30% higher than California's overall rate. To cut costs, the county
already has closed a dozen outpatient clinics. Still its health
department faces a deficit of about $600 million as an earlier
federal bailout is phased out.</TE>
<TE>   Measure B does not pretend to provide enough money to cure the
department's budget woes; it would generate less than one-third of
that $600-million gap. What Measure B would do is keep at least the
core emergency and trauma services going and probably save some lives
in the meantime. The federal government, which bears the
responsibility for the illegal immigration that strains the county's
health-care system, and the state government, which needs to
understand that what threatens Los Angeles also threatens
California's business and tourist climate, must still meet their
responsibilities in addressing this mounting crisis.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Los Angeles County residents can ignore all this
and hope that they can find a trauma center open if they need one --
or they can vote for Measure B, knowing that there's plenty left for
the state and federal government to do.</TE>

<HD>Congress' Fiscal Wreck</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The economy still sputters. Unemployment and the poverty rate are up,
while job creation and consumer confidence are down. But faced with a
budget crisis and a midterm election, lawmakers chose politics
Wednesday, shoving off their legislative agenda to a possible
lame-duck session next month. Congress' fiscal house isn't a mess;
it's a wreck.</LD>
<LD>   Congress has approved only two of 13 required spending bills to
fund government in 2003, though the new fiscal year started weeks
ago. To avoid a government shutdown, Congress has passed resolutions
that allow stop-gap funding at current levels but dodge tough debates
about a real budget. Congress alone cannot cure a slump, but consumer
confidence and economic stimulation are affected by its spending
decisions.</LD>
<LD>   Workers already hit by the downturn may soon feel its effects more
deeply. Unless Congress extends emergency unemployment aid, which is
scheduled to expire at the end of December, up to 3 million of the
out-of-work will be affected. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.) has backed modestly increasing the federal minimum wage to
$6.15 from $5.15 and extending unemployment benefits for 13 weeks,
with an additional seven weeks in high-unemployment states such as
California and Texas.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats might wish that such fragmented measures amounted to a
coherent alternative to the White House's chief economic aim of
making its 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut permanent and fully
abolishing the estate tax. But they are not enough.</TE>
<TE>   Enter House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), who
Tuesday proposed his own $200-billion stimulus plan of business
investment -- and even more tax cuts. He criticized the 10-year tax
cut that Congress approved last year but was silent about whether it
should be repealed.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Gephardt called for giving $75 billion in cuts and
rebates to working-class families and small businesses and spending
more on school construction, health care and the like. Gephardt
opened the door to a possible flood of new tax reductions that appeal
to the different constituencies of Republicans and Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   As Nov. 5 approaches, lawmakers won't touch the issue of rolling
back tax cuts. However, until Congress revisits the trillion-dollar
issue, it can rearrange the furniture all it wants but a real
housecleaning will never take place.</TE>

<LD>North Korea's surprising admission that it has secretly pursued
development of nuclear weapons raises the threat level in Northeast
Asia. But the acknowledgment of what was long suspected also could
set the stage for more-honest negotiations with the United States and
its allies.</LD>
<LD>   The unidentified Bush administration official who Wednesday night
disclosed the North Korean confession said the U.S. wanted "a
peaceful resolution" of its differences with Pyongyang that should
include removal of any nuclear weapons. That's good reason for
Washington to work with the governments of South Korea (where the
U.S. stations 37,000 troops), Japan and China to develop a strategy
to gain inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities while offering
Pyongyang the possible reward of eventual diplomatic recognition.</LD>
<LD>   In 1994, North Korea promised to freeze development of atomic
weapons -- for which it was using plutonium from its nuclear power
plant at Yongbyon -- in exchange for fuel oil and construction of two
civilian nuclear power plants that would use fuel less likely to be
employed in making nuclear bombs.</LD>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Pyongyang admitted to Assistant U.S. Secretary of
State James A. Kelly that it was pursuing a program to build nuclear
weapons using enriched uranium.</TE>
<TE>   That was its second recent admission. Earlier it disclosed that
for years it had kidnapped citizens of Japan and forced them to
instruct North Korean agents on the Japanese language and that
nation's customs.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration official speaking Wednesday said the
nuclear weapons message was "assertive, aggressive" rather than
apologetic. Even so, both disclosures can be read as North Korea's
attempts to open its books, admit past actions and resume
negotiations with its former enemies. However, because North Korea's
army and its weapons dwarf Iraq's, its troops are much closer to U.S.
forces than Iraq's and it may already have nuclear weapons on hand,
North Korea should move to the top of the Bush administration's
diplomatic problems.</TE>
<TE>   The administration should have disclosed the North Korean
admission before last week's congressional votes authorizing the use
of force against Iraq; doing so would have made for a more informed
debate.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea always has deserved skepticism about its words,
actions and motives. President Bush has taken a tougher line than
President Clinton, even lumping North Korea into an "axis of evil"
with Iraq and Iran. Pyongyang may in part be expressing anger at
Bush. But it should recognize that Russia isn't the ally it once was
and China, which fought on its side in the Korean War while the
United States joined forces with South Korea, also has distanced
itself.</TE>
<TE>   North Korean citizens are starving or freezing to death; those who
can reach foreign countries refuse to go home. If North Korea wants
respect or aid, it has to abandon nuclear weapons programs and allow
inspectors to verify that.</TE>

<LD>Re "Making Social Justice Part of the Curriculum," Oct. 9: A middle
school that includes social justice in its mission -- at the L.A.
Leadership Academy this doesn't mean providing an answer but rather
asking questions about fairness and well-being. We expect our
students to be critical, independent thinkers and ask them to find
their own answers, using evidence, considering alternatives and
understanding multiple viewpoints.</LD>
<LD>   Since a central motive for creating a public school system was to
prepare citizens to participate actively in a democracy, we are proud
to honor the duty so fully. Right now, the students in my community
action class are most concerned about child abuse. How gratifying to
be able to give them the tools to do something about it.</LD>

<LD>As usual, children are the victims of two so-called adults ("Campus
Dispute Comes to a Head," Oct. 10). Riverside County teacher John
Maurer's lawyer mentions "principles" and says, "Someone's got to
stand up for something." Well, great, Maurer took a courageous stand
all right ... for the right to wear a hat? Then he and his boss
engage in games of childish one-upmanship, resulting in harm to their
students. Shameful on the part of both of these "educators."</LD>

<LD>"For Iraqis, Vote for Hussein Is an Exercise in Democracy" (Oct. 15)
was frustrating to read. Not once did it attempt to explain the
mechanism by which about 99% of the population votes for Hussein. I
kept waiting for the punch line. Does the ballot have the voter's
name on it? Does a camera note how the person voted? There was no
explanation given: nothing, nada, zip.</LD>

<LD>Al Lohman (obituary, Oct. 15) and partner Roger Barkley were one of
the bright spots on the radio in Los Angeles. Many mornings in the
'80s I didn't get a lot of work done while they were on. Their cast
of silly characters helped us not to take life too seriously.
Oftentimes I borrowed one of the names they used for filling out
unimportant forms. There will never be another Lohman and Barkley.</LD>

<TE>   The morning drive was tolerable while listening to Ted J. Balogna,
W., Dominic Longo and, of course, the outstanding Maynard Farmer. It
was amazing to look around at the other cars on the freeway and see
other drivers laughing at the situations brought to us by the Lohman
and Barkley show.</TE>
<TE>   I remember them talking about their annual golf tournament and
"bringing out the sticks again," and Lohman said, "One year we should
try playing with golf clubs instead of sticks." The coffee stains
never did come out of my shirt, tie and pants. Thanks for the great
memories and R.I.P.</TE>

<TE>   I was the student speakers commissioner at UC Irvine. We booked
Lohman and Barkley to perform their live stage show on our campus.
The evening of the show a huge fire erupted in the hills close to
where Lohman had his home. I spoke with him the afternoon of the
performance, with flames licking at the perimeter of his house, and
asked if he still wanted to perform. He said he felt comfortable
enough to come to the school. Although Al was physically drained from
dealing with the fire, he and Roger entertained to the roaring
approval of their fans.</TE>
<TE>   Thus began a 20-year friendship that I will always cherish. I echo
those who have said what a kind, funny, talented and caring man Al
was. Just to hear his voice when I would call him in Rancho Mirage
brought a smile to my face.</TE>

<HD>Dissecting the Political Lives of Gray Davis and Bill Simon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was not surprised by The Times' endorsement of Gov. Gray Davis
(editorial, Oct. 15). However, it was not a very flattering
endorsement. You highlighted his "obsessive pursuit" of campaign
dollars and his inability and slowness to "grasp the lead on critical
issues," including his failure to act in a timely manner to head off
the energy debacle. You implore him to drop the "perpetual
fund-raising" and take the lead in finding solutions to the many
problems that have escalated during his term.</LD>
<LD>   In contrast, you describe Bill Simon's campaign as "one amateurish
gaffe and disaster after another" and allude to his "constant
campaign stumbles." Simon may not be a career politician. However, he
is focused on the issues and ready with ideas to address our Davis
budget deficit, energy debacle, education failure and transportation
congestion. Davis may have experience, but he has used it solely to
serve his own political ambition. Simon -- honest businessman (that
lawsuit was thrown out) -- has earned my vote.</LD>
<LD>   Colleen Hinman</LD>
<TE>   Rowland Heights</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your editorial states that Davis will not be raising money for his
next campaign so he will have time to govern during his second term.
Historically, he has gone from one elected job to another. What will
happen to this state if he really kicks fund-raising into high gear
and spends 2003 and 2004 campaigning to get on the Democratic
presidential ticket?</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Rendahl</TE>
<TE>   Torrance</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In your series on the major party candidates for governor I didn't
expect you to paint Simon as a blithering idiot with views to the
right of Pat Buchanan. But after the hatchet job you did on Davis
(Oct. 10-12), I didn't expect a love letter ("Simon Forged His Future
in Dad's Formidable Path," Oct. 15).</TE>
<TE>   Simon's blunders barely took up a paragraph, and even then were
dismissed. Other gaffes, such as his backing off on gay issues, were
not mentioned at all. Maybe The Times is afraid of being accused of
having a liberal bias, but after you painted Davis as a cold,
calculating man with no friends I guess I expected a similarly harsh
article on Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel McVey</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Ramirez's Oct. 15 editorial cartoon depicting Davis as a
prostitute is insultingly one-dimensional and personal. Does Ramirez
implicitly support limits on campaign contributions or the freedom to
exercise one's right to support the candidate of one's choosing?
Perhaps more government regulation is the answer. Can he name one
candidate in the U.S. who does not so "prostitute" himself? Could one
not apply the same simplistic brush to Bush's acceptance of
contributions from Enron's Kenneth Lay for his influence on this
administration's energy policy?</TE>

<LD>Re "N. Korea Discloses Secret Nuclear Arms Program," Oct 17: In the
two places where we left our business unfinished, North Korea and
Iraq, we now face belligerent dictators willing and able to threaten
our country. The war against North Korea was the first coalition
action of the new U.N. The fear of world opinion and communist China,
at that time weak, caused us to stop short, which left North Korea
alive and dangerous. It was another U.N. coalition action, against
Iraq, that again -- because of fear of world opinion and of its
neighbor Iran -- stopped short of ending that regime's threat against
us and its dreams of regional domination. Can we learn from history?
Can we now eliminate these threatening regimes before they become a
bigger danger to the U.S. and the rest of the free world?</LD>

<TE>   Re "Mr. Bush, Heed Carter and Learn," Commentary, Oct. 15: Robert
Scheer (Commentary, Oct. 15) is right that former President Jimmy
Carter is a great man with noble aspirations for peace. However,
President Bush's situation should hardly be compared to Carter's. It
would be impractical, if not impossible, for Bush to sit down at Camp
David with the Islamic radical terrorists who threaten our national
security. Attempts to negotiate with Saddam Hussein have gone
nowhere, yet Bush continues to pursue tough inspections rather than
war.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Carter was a great man and a peacemaker, but that is
precisely why he would have difficulty making decisions in these
times. In fact, the circumstances we live in today are much more akin
to those of the Iran hostage crisis. We cannot wait 444 days to
defuse threats to our security -- and perhaps that makes Bush the
best man for this job.</TE>
<TE>   Robert J. Meekins</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Perle's Passion Is Served" (Oct. 15) illustrates a one-sided
point of view in the administration on war with Iraq. An antidote is
provided in Scheer's commentary. Bush must listen to and heed voices
other than the "gang of bullies" in his administration. The American
people deserve to have all sides of an issue set before them -- and
in time -- for them to let their representatives know how they feel.
Most of us do not want an imperialistic foreign policy, and we do not
want to go to war.</TE>

<LD>President Bush and many of his supporters are quick to claim that his
press for war against Iraq is not politically motivated. If it isn't
politically motivated, why are many Republican candidates now
attacking their opponents on their stands regarding this war? I won't
be surprised if all this rhetoric cools off after November's
elections. Bush, just after getting his victory on the resolution,
took pride in the fact that the debate was "fair and balanced." Yet
his party's use of that debate is far from fair and balanced.</LD>
<LD>   I have some rhetorical questions that I hope people will answer
prior to voting in November: If you are so strongly in favor of this
war, will you either sign yourself or your children up first, so
others who don't feel like you do won't have to die for your views?
Are you truly better off today than you were two years ago? Are you
safer today than you were two years ago? And one for Mr. Bush:
Whatever happened to Osama bin Laden?</LD>

<TE>   Re "Bush Focuses Campaigning on Key Areas," Oct. 15: When did it
become the job of the president to be campaigning around the country
for candidates? Bush has been doing much of that lately. There are so
many serious issues to be taken into consideration; it would seem his
attention should be focused on them during this critical time.</TE>

<HD>8 Unincorporated Communities May Be Annexed by Anaheim</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight unincorporated communities in and around Anaheim would be
annexed by the city in a sweeping deal that the Board of Supervisors
will consider next week.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal marks a significant step in the county's effort to
cede control of dozens of unincorporated "islands" to adjacent
cities, arguing that the municipalities can more efficiently provide
services like police protection and street sweeping.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan, Anaheim would take control of 750 acres of county
territory with 8,000 residents.</LD>
<TE>   The largest of the communities is Colonia Independencia, a Latino
barrio founded by laborers who came to Orange County before World War
I to work in orange groves. The five-block district is made up of
wood-frame homes. As late as the 1970s, it lacked sewers, paved
streets and sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   Cities have traditionally been reluctant to take over
unincorporated areas because of the cost of providing municipal
services for the residents.</TE>
<TE>   But Anaheim would agree to the annexation if the county continues
to lease to the city a popular golf course on county property for $1
a year for the next 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Details of the proposed annexation still need to be worked out and
win approval from the Local Agency Formation Commission -- a process
that officials said will take at least two years.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday will be asked to extend the
lease of the Dad Miller Golf Course for this two-year period while
annexation is finalized. The course is next to the location the Tiger
Woods Foundation wants to build an education center for
underprivileged children.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim officials said the deal would be an important milestone.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about one of the larger unincorporated areas in the
county," said Tom Wood, Anaheim's assistant city manager.</TE>
<TE>   "The county has been working to eliminate these county islands for
some time."</TE>
<TE>   The Anaheim City Council was expected to vote on the agreement
Tuesday. But that meeting has been postponed because the Anaheim
Angels are playing the San Francisco Giants in the World Series, Wood
said.</TE>
<TE>   The county has been trying to unload unincorporated areas since
1994, when the board decided to focus on "core services" like social
services, public protection and health care. Officials argued that
cities -- not the county -- should be in the business of providing
municipal services.</TE>
<TE>   So far, county islands near Costa Mesa, Newport Beach and Garden
Grove have moved closer to annexation. But many others remain, from
the working-class district of El Modena in Orange to upscale
communities such as Rossmoor and Orange Park Acres.</TE>
<TE>   There are more than 70 unincorporated islands, with a population
of well over 100,000 people. Some, like Rossmoor, have fought to stay
independent. Others have remained in the county because nearby cities
had little interested in taking them over.</TE>

<HD>Aryan Group Focus of Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Rosenzweig</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal grand jury in Los Angeles has indicted 40 reputed members
and associates of the Aryan Brotherhood on racketeering charges that
include allegations of a string of murders and violent attacks
designed to expand the power of the white racist prison gang,
prosecutors said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty defendants are already in prisons around the country on
unrelated charges. Eight were arrested Thursday and two were listed
as fugitives.</LD>
<LD>   Law enforcement officers executed search warrants on prison cells,
homes and offices in California, New York, Louisiana, Illinois,
Pennsylvania, Georgia, Colorado, Massachusetts, Florida, Washington,
Nebraska and Connecticut.</LD>
<TE>   The indictments grew out of a six-year investigation into the
workings of the gang, which was founded at San Quentin state prison
in 1964 and has since spread to penitentiaries across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Those indicted were charged under the federal Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act, enacted as a weapon against the
Sicilian Mafia in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In the past several years, prosecutors have resorted to using the
1970 law, commonly known as RICO, with increasing frequency against
prison-based as well as street gangs.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican Mafia, the Nazi Low Riders, the Wah Ching and Los
Angeles' 18th Street gang are among the groups that have been hit
with RICO prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   The law contains tough penalties. Twenty-three of those charged
Thursday will be eligible for the death penalty if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Among them are Barry Byron Mills, 54, of Santa Rosa, and Tyler
Davis Bingham, 55, of Sacramento, both members of a three-man
commission that allegedly controls Aryan Brotherhood activities
throughout the federal prison system.</TE>
<TE>   Mills, currently housed at a maximum security prison in Florence,
Colo., is accused of personally committing one of 16 murders cited in
the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Bingham, also in custody at the Florence penitentiary, was accused
of ordering murders and assaults on Aryan Brotherhood opponents and
dropouts.</TE>
<TE>   A separate troika controls Aryan Brotherhood activities in the
California prison system, according to the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Many members are being held at Pelican Bay Prison in Northern
California, designed for the most troublesome inmates in the state
corrections system.</TE>
<TE>   Despite efforts to segregate and control them, Aryan Brotherhood
members at Pelican Bay have engaged in a lethal struggle for power.
At least six murders have occurred since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Charged in the indictment unsealed Thursday are three Pelican Bay
inmates who reputedly make all important decisions affecting Aryan
Brotherhood actions in the state penal system: Richard Lloyd
Terflinger, 55, and David Allen Chance, 45, both of Los Angeles, and
John William Stinson, 48, of Long Beach. All three are eligible for
the death penalty if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation that led to the indictments was headed by agents
from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms with
assistance from the state Department of Corrections and the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the 23 defendants who face death penalty trials,
the remaining 17 could receive life terms without the possibility of
parole if convicted.</TE>

<HD>Chick Urges L.A. to Redo Visitors Bureau Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City Controller Laura Chick called Thursday for Los Angeles to
renegotiate its contract with the Convention and Visitors Bureau,
citing an audit that concluded that a lack of controls may have
contributed to "extravagant" spending by the agency.</LD>
<LD>   The final audit released Thursday was commissioned by Chick from a
private consultant after The Times ran a series of articles on the
bureau's spending, including luxury travel and entertainment costing
as much as $3 million per year, paid for by the city-financed bureau.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, there has been a steep drop in the number of
conventions booked in the city, and 48 have canceled in the last
three years.</LD>
<TE>   "Lavish and extravagant spending of taxpayer money must be a thing
of the past," Chick said Thursday, adding that the current city
contract with the bureau contains "broad and undefined objectives
that literally make any expenditure related to Los Angeles tourism
allowable."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Mayor James K. Hahn and the City Council, Chick
recommended Thursday that the city renegotiate its contract to set
"measurable performance goals." The bureau was paid $16 million by
the city in 2001 to bring conventions and tourists to Los Angeles.
The sum represented about 65% of its budget. The rest came from
industry dues and payments.</TE>
<TE>   Chick said a renegotiated contract should include more oversight
of spending, including a prohibition on the disproportionate spending
of city funds on administrative overhead.</TE>
<TE>   Bureau Board Chairman Alan Rothenberg said in a written statement
that the nonprofit agency had begun implementing reforms and would
consider the audit's additional recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   "This audit will provide us with further guidance for reforms that
are already underway," Rothenberg said. "Given the opportunity, these
reforms will help make our operations as efficient as possible and
attract more conventions and tourists to Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Rothenberg declined direct comment through a spokesman on the
audit's conclusion that some of the bureau's expenses from industry
funds "appear extravagant."</TE>
<TE>   Those include Bureau President George Kirkland's $350,000 package
of salary and incentives, which the audit noted is significantly
higher than the $240,000 average provided to chief executives in
other major bureaus nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The audit also questioned a $230,000 annual premium paid by the
bureau on a $3.3-million life insurance policy for Kirkland.</TE>
<TE>   Other extravagant expenditures, the audit said, included "luxury
travel and meals."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, the audit noted that the bureau had spent more than
$250,000 on a dinner at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for event
planners holding a convention in L.A. in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   One document indicated that the retail value of the entertainment,
food and planning had exceeded $1 million, but that many venders had
donated services.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau bill included $120,000 in food and alcohol, with the
Patina Group handling the catering. There were 28 bartenders at the
dinner. The party featured a Las Vegas-style show featuring the Blue
Man Group, comedian Rita Rudner and singer Sheila E and her band.</TE>
<TE>   Chick said there is a value in entertaining event planners who can
bring business to the center, but she was uncomfortable with the
amount spent.</TE>
<TE>   "As city controller I have always believed we should err on the
side of being conservative in spending on parties," she said. "This
[party] is a little bit like show biz."</TE>
<TE>   The bureau's executive vice president, Michael Collins, defended
the party as necessary to "showcase" the city to the important event
planners.</TE>

<HD>Derek Bell, 66; Irish Harpist for the Chieftains</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irish harpist Derek Bell, whose impish sense of humor was often
masked behind a staid visage during his 30 years with a traditional
Irish music band, the Chieftains, died unexpectedly this week in
Phoenix. He was 66.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of Bell's death and even the day he died were not
immediately known, said Michelle Findlay, who represents the multiple
Grammy-winning Chieftains for Vancouver-based Macklam/Feldman
Management. He would have turned 67 on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The group, celebrating its 40th anniversary this year, had just
finished taping a television special in Nashville in conjunction with
its latest album, "Down the Old Plank Road: The Nashville Sessions,"
the group's second collaboration with American country music stars.</LD>
<TE>   Bell had remained in the country for a routine physical and minor
surgery, but had been cleared by doctors to return to Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   Findlay said no other details about the surgery were available.</TE>
<TE>   "His death comes as a great shock to all those close to him," the
band said in a statement Thursday. "His passing will leave a silence
that will never be filled. Anyone who has had the honor of meeting
Derek will know that the world will be a much less interesting place
without him. We will all miss him terribly."</TE>
<TE>   The statement was signed by Chieftains founder and leader Paddy
Moloney, fiddlers Sean Keane and Martin Fay, flutist Matt Molloy,
singer-percussionist Kevin Conneff, and former members Michael
Tubridy and Sean Potts.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bell brightened Chieftains shows with displays of dry
humor, such as the loud argyle socks he wore to offset his
conservative suits, Bell was an exceptional harpist and keyboardist
whose tastes encompassed ancient folk music, Mozart and Scott Joplin.</TE>
<TE>   He regularly tickled audiences in concerts by dropping the air of
restrained professionalism, frequently feigning to walk off stage
when Moloney made references to other harpists, or jokingly
disparaged his fashion sense. Or he would liven one of the
traditional Irish reels the Chieftains specialized in with a piano
break that referenced ragtime master Fats Waller or jazz great Oscar
Peterson.</TE>
<TE>   He is credited with helping rejuvenate interest in the Irish harp,
one of the traditional instruments whose popularity waned after World
War II when rock music swept the country, as it had the rest of the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Bell recorded dozens of albums with the Chieftains that championed
the country's musical heritage. He was central to their 1993 album
"The Celtic Harp," a tribute to 17th and 18th century musicologist
Edward Bunting, who created the Belfast Harp Society in 1813.</TE>
<TE>   The album was an anomaly among the Chieftains' far-reaching
projects over the last two decades, when the ensemble reached beyond
traditional Irish music to explore the ripples from the 19th century
Irish diaspora in cultures around the world.</TE>
<TE>   The group had also expanded its sound, collaborating with dozens
of guests including Irish classical flutist James Galway, Irish
rocker Van Morrison in a watershed 1988 collaboration, and dozens of
high-profile partners on individual tracks, including the Rolling
Stones, Jackson Browne, Elvis Costello, Linda Ronstadt, Los Lobos and
Ry Cooder.</TE>
<TE>   Bell also recorded at least half a dozen solo albums, including
two devoted to the music of 17th century Irish harpist-composer
Turlough O'Carolan and one featuring his own compositions. He
appeared as a guest on albums by numerous other pop, folk and
classical artists.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in Belfast and got his earliest musical training from
his father, a fiddler.</TE>
<TE>   He studied piano, xylophone and reed instruments including oboe
and the English horn.</TE>
<TE>   He received a degree from Royal College of Music in London in 1957
and a bach- elor of music degree from Dublin's Trinity College in
1959. Bell spent 11 years working with the chorus of the Northern
Ireland Radio &amp; TV Orchestra, and in 1970 began teaching harp at the
Belfast Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.</TE>
<TE>   His first job was as manager of the City of Belfast Symphony
Orchestra in the late 1950s and he was in his 30s before being
introduced to the Irish harp by fellow musician Alan Tongue, who also
introduced him to the Chieftains. His first recording after joining
the group in 1972 was on its "Chieftains 4" album.</TE>
<TE>   Bell is survived by his wife, Stephanie, his mother and two
sisters. No funeral or memorial services have been set.</TE>

<LD>A Modesto man has died after his wife held him down and bit him
repeatedly when he refused to have sex with her, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Kelli Pratt, 45, was booked on suspicion of elder abuse, domestic
violence and assault on a police officer. Homicide charges were
pending the outcome of toxicology results, said Sgt. Al Carter. Those
tests are not expected for several weeks, but they could show whether
the bites created an infection that killed 65-year-old Arthur Pratt.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities say he died Sunday at Doctors Memorial Center in
Modesto, six days after the attack. His skin was riddled with more
than 20 deep tooth marks, which may have contributed to the ailing
man's death, Carter said.</LD>
<TE>   "He was able to dial 911 that night," Carter said. "We have a tape
recording of him screaming while she was biting him. When officers
arrived, he was screaming that he'd been assaulted. She fought with
the officers and tried to bite them too."</TE>
<TE>   Carter said Arthur Pratt had been released from a hospital several
days before the incident. He suffered from diabetes, heart and
circulation problems, and other health issues.</TE>
<TE>   Kelli Pratt is being held on $50,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen cases where dogs have bitten kids, and blood loss or
infection led to death," Carter said. "I've never heard of anyone
being bitten to death before."</TE>

<LD>The president of a union representing the Los Angeles Police
Department's more than 8,000 officers will step down at the end of
the year, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Mitzi Grasso, who has served as the Los Angeles Police Protective
League's president for two years, will be replaced by Bob Baker, the
organization's vice president.</LD>
<LD>   Baker downplayed the change, saying that it was sought by Grasso,
who wants to spend more time with her family. She will continue to
serve on the executive board as a vice president, Baker said.</LD>
<TE>   The change comes as William J. Bratton prepares to take over as
police chief Oct. 28. Grasso has been an outspoken supporter of
Bratton.</TE>

<HD>2nd Condor Chick Hatched in Wild Dies</HD>
<DH>Lead could be cause of death. Just one of three birds from
new generation of repopulation program survives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second time this month, a California condor chick hatched in
the wild was found dead in a cave deep in Los Padres National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of death is unknown, but biologists said the bird's
mother had elevated lead levels in her blood and both parents often
foraged for food, putting them at risk for lead poisoning that could
be passed on to the chick.</LD>
<LD>   The death leaves just one chick of the original three left in the
wild, dampening hopes for a new generation of condors born outside
zoos.</LD>
<TE>   The deaths "are two independent events that may have similar or
different causes," said Bruce Palmer, coordinator of the $35-million
condor project for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</TE>
<TE>   The latest fatality was discovered Tuesday after Allan Mee, a
biologist watching the cave in the Sespe Condor Refuge, lost sight of
the turkey-sized chick inside.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I didn't see any signs of the chick and thought it had
possibly [flown off]," Mee said of the 5-month-old bird. "But when
the father pulled the chick out of the shadows of the cave, I
realized it was dead."</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. Forest Service helicopter tried to reach the site Wednesday
but turned back because of fog. On Thursday, biologists were trying
to rappel down a sheer cliff face to grab the dead chick, which will
be sent to the San Diego Zoo for a necropsy.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, the first condor in 18 years to brood and hatch in
the wild was found dead on a ledge just below its sandstone cave. Its
father, which had gone foraging, is missing and presumed dead.</TE>
<TE>   That chick's hatching last April was hailed as validation of the
controversial captive breeding program that had boosted the condor
population from 15 to almost 200 over the last 20 years.</TE>

<HD>Chief of CRA Is Leaving His Post</HD>
<DH>Riordan appointee was 'turnaround guy' for the troubled
agency. Board members praise his accomplishments despite his rocky
tenure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The head of the Community Redevelopment Agency is leaving his
position, clearing the way for the mayor and the new board overseeing
the agency to select a new management team.</LD>
<LD>   Jerry Scharlin, who was appointed by former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan, took over the troubled city agency in 1999 when it
faced serious financial and political problems. Scharlin was seen as
"the turnaround guy," said CRA board Chairman David Farrar.</LD>
<LD>   Scharlin, who had never worked in the public sector, quickly set
about to restructure the agency, facing controversy along the way. He
fired top administrators, who later claimed wrongful termination and
were paid money by the city to resolve those claims. He also hired a
private investigator to conduct an investigation into the agency's
finances.</LD>
<TE>   "I came in when the agency was in massive crisis, and the agency
is no longer in crisis," Scharlin said Thursday. "We've gone through
some very substantial improvements that I'm pleased about, that I
think will set the stage for the long-term success of the agency."</TE>
<TE>   Several of the current CRA board members, appointed by Mayor James
K. Hahn, said Thursday that Scharlin did a good job in reorganizing
the CRA but that they expected he would want someone else to lead it
into its next phase.</TE>
<TE>   His contract had expired, and a search firm was hired in July to
locate possible successors. Scharlin, an accountant, said Thursday
that he did not want to apply for the job.</TE>
<TE>   The CRA uses property tax money to provide incentives for
development in blighted areas, including purchasing land and selling
it at a discount to builders.</TE>
<TE>   The agency also has eminent domain powers, allowing it to seize
private property to put together multiple parcels for large
construction projects.</TE>
<TE>   The CRA has a $342.4-million budget this year, $226 million of
which is expected to be spent on programs.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook said the agency has the ability to
significantly improve various areas of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "If you use the tools the CRA has ... you can make a huge, huge
positive impact in the city," Middlebrook said. "This is a big
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Scharlin is credited with developing a strategic plan for the
agency, clarifying the budget and future cash flow, and repositioning
the CRA by developing three new projects: two in downtown and one in
San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   "Our budget had been going down, down, down" before Scharlin took
over, Farrar said. "It's turning the corner because of new projects
he championed."</TE>
<TE>   Doug Ring, a CRA board member, said he believes that Scharlin did
an admirable job under tough circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "His tenure has been rocky, but it's been rocky because he came
into an agency which had lots and lots of problems," Ring said. "He
made some faux pas that, had he worked in government before, he
probably wouldn't have made."</TE>
<TE>   Madeline Janis-Aparicio, a new board member, said there is new
commitment at the board level to revitalizing the city through CRA
projects.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Jerry's done a really good job of working the agency into
shape, especially internally," she said. "There's a desire now to
make great changes."</TE>
<TE>   A city controller's audit several years ago accused the agency of
overpaying for property; Scharlin put in place new controls,
including a project review team to examine all deals before approval.</TE>
<TE>   But when he fired two top administrators, including the chief
financial officer, the City Council was forced into paying $584,000
to settle wrongful discharge claims.</TE>
<TE>   Scharlin angered some council members too, along the way.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged last year that city politics and the CRA's
problems presented "a very difficult and chaotic environment."</TE>
<TE>   "I was in substantial shock," he said at the time.</TE>

<HD>Lawmaker Seeks Land Swap to Let Mojave Cross Stand</HD>
<DH>Under proposed federal legislation, the site in the
national preserve would be exchanged for five acres of private land.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Cart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 5-foot cross that has been a fixture in the Mojave National
Preserve for 68 years and the subject of intensive removal efforts is
now included in a proposed legislative land exchange that would
redraw the park boundary to place the cross in private hands.</LD>
<LD>   The white cross stands on a rocky slope called Sunrise Rock, about
11 miles south of Interstate 15 near the Nevada border.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration is backing the efforts of Rep. Jerry Lewis
(R-Redlands) to preserve the cross, which is fashioned out of metal
pipe and was erected in 1934 to honor World War I veterans. The issue
of a permanent religious symbol on the remote desert site has been
simmering for three years. The American Civil Liberties Union has
sued to have the cross taken down.</LD>
<TE>   Lewis has successfully interceded twice before. First, he
presented a bill to prohibit the Park Service from using federal
money to remove the cross.</TE>
<TE>   Then he inserted language in the 2002 defense appropriations bill
that declared the site a national memorial.</TE>
<TE>   The latest attempt is part of a massive federal lands bill
introduced last week in the House of Representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis' provision calls for one acre around the cross to be given
to the Barstow Veterans of Foreign Wars post in exchange for five
acres of land that would be donated by a private landowner who owns
property within the preserve.</TE>
<TE>   The exchange would allow local residents to continue to gather for
Easter sunrise services or other religious worship because the
ceremonies would take place on private land and satisfy the
constitutional requirement for separation of church and state.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the land swap is an effort to circumvent the July
ruling of a federal judge who ordered the cross to be taken down. The
Park Service has not complied.</TE>
<TE>   "It's truly amazing that what is a clear-cut constitutional issue
could engender the depth of legislative enactment and amount of
effort that has gone into saving this cross," said Frank Buono, a
former deputy superintendent at the Mojave National Preserve now
retired from the Park Service. It was Buono who notified the Southern
California ACLU after determining that the cross was on public land.</TE>
<TE>   Buono said he defends citizens' rights to worship and he supports
the idea of a veterans' memorial, as long as it is nonsectarian.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue, as a federal judge has ruled, is the permanent
placement of the cross -- a religious symbol -- on public land,"
Buono said.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis' spokesman, Jim Specht, said the congressman had acted on
behalf of constituents who oppose changes to the cross site. Lewis
regards the cross as a war memorial, rather than a religious symbol,
Specht said.</TE>
<TE>   Park officials have tried to be sensitive to residents who love
the site even though, officials say, the remote area is seldom
visited.</TE>
<TE>   "People out here feel very strongly about it, and we wanted to
work with them to find a resolution," said Mojave's chief ranger,
Sean McGuiness. "Taking it down wasn't a high priority for us."</TE>
<TE>   Religious symbols are not unknown on national parkland.</TE>
<TE>   The Chapel of Transfiguration is a major draw at Grand Tetons
National Park in Wyoming. But, to be allowed, the structure or site
must be found to have historical significance.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Mojave cross, a Park Service study found no
historical merit in the site, which has changed significantly since
the cross was first erected.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Sandoz has been taking care of the cross since 1983,
fulfilling a promise he made to a dying veteran. Sandoz, a retired
mine employee who lives nearby, said he has re-erected the cross more
than 18 times in 20 years, as the elements and vandals have had their
way with the isolated site.</TE>
<TE>   The cross began life as two wooden planks and is now made of
sturdy iron pipes welded together and sunk into concrete.</TE>
<TE>   According to Joe McGuire, quartermaster of the Barstow VFW post,
the Barstow area -- with its cluster of military bases -- is a mecca
for military retirees. McGuire said he could envision a tradition of
decorating the site on Memorial Day.</TE>
<TE>   "We look forward to having it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU's case is still pending. The Park Service has not
appealed the judge's ruling but has asked for a clarification. The
judge has not yet responded.</TE>

<HD>Dentist Settles Disabled Teen's Suit</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>A settlement has been reached in a lawsuit filed on behalf of a
Pasadena teenager who claimed she was left permanently disabled by a
sedative administered in her dentist's office, her attorney said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Stephen Belgum, an attorney representing Melissa McGrath, would
not disclose the terms of the accord except to say it will "provide a
significant amount of money and keep her from being a public ward."</LD>
<LD>   Belgum said McGrath was 15 when she suffered a severe adverse
reaction to an overdose of chloral hydrate in the Pasadena office of
dentist Drueciel Ford in March 1999. "She was an excellent student
before the incident, which stopped her heart for a significant period
of time," he said. "She will likely always have serious memory
problems, cognitive deficits and physical disabilities." McGrath
enrolled in a special school in Escondido and received a high school
diploma in June, he said.</LD>
<TE>   A jury in March found Ford not guilty of 60 criminal charges,
noted her attorney, Robert McNeill Jr., who denied that McGrath's
heart attack was caused by an overdose. The jury deadlocked on three
other charges, and prosecutors decided not to retry Ford on those.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Ford is planning to resume her practice," McNeill said.</TE>

<HD>Not Guilty Plea in Girl's Shooting</HD>
<DH>A Dana Point 8-year-old was maimed when her father fired
shotgun accidentally. He is charged with felony child endangerment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Dana Point man accused of wounding his 8-year-old daughter by
accidentally firing his shotgun pleaded not guilty Thursday in a case
that has ignited a debate about how far prosecutors should go in
punishing parents in gun accidents.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffrey A. West, who entered the plea in a Laguna Niguel
courtroom, faces up to nine years in prison if convicted of a felony
child-endangerment charge that was enhanced with an additional count
that he inflicted great bodily harm.</LD>
<LD>   Madison West lost part of her right arm and a kidney as a result
of the Sept. 27 shooting. Investigators say the girl was standing
near her father in his bedroom, watching him inspect his new shotgun,
when the weapon accidentally fired as he unloaded it. She is
recovering at the San Diego County home of her mother, who divorced
West four years ago and shares custody of Madison and their
10-year-old son.</LD>
<TE>   The case has left prosecutors, defense attorneys and gun advocates
at odds over whether it is fair to hold West criminally responsible
for a shooting that even investigators acknowledge was an accident.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Sheriff's Department and district attorney's
office say the charges are justified because West was fully aware his
daughter was nearby and knew the gun was loaded, and that he should
have at least pointed it away from her. "She was standing right next
to him, in very close proximity," said sheriff's spokesman Jim
Amormino. "It appeared to be accidental. Nonetheless, it's very
careless. You don't load and unload guns next to very small children.
He put her in great danger."</TE>
<TE>   West's mother, sobbing outside the courtroom, said he is
devastated by the accident and does not deserve further punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Lori Andie said her son has had primary custody of Madison and her
brother, and described him as a devoted, responsible father who has
spent every day at the hospital since the shooting, washing his
daughter's hair and helping nurses any way he can.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a horrible tragedy, and one he has to live with the
rest of his life," she said, recalling a recent phone conversation
with her son. "He asked me if I had seen his baby, and he cried. She
really looks to her daddy for her strength. I think the reason she's
doing so well is because of her dad's care."</TE>
<TE>   West's attorney, Robison D. Harley Jr., characterized the shooting
as "nothing more than a tragic accident" that has left a single
father traumatized, depressed and unfairly separated from a daughter
he adores.</TE>
<TE>   "He's devastated. He's mortified," Harley said outside the
courtroom. Prosecutors "are trying to distort this tragedy into some
kind of crime. The fact is, it's still an accident, and there was no
criminal will involved. We've got an innocent man. He's a model
parent. And he's being abused by the system."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say it is difficult to compare this shooting to others
because gun accidents of this nature are rare. Most cases involving
children occur in their handling an adult's gun that wasn't stored
properly, and many of California's gun regulations focus on these
situations.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County alone, charges have been filed in several
parent-child shootings over the last 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Michel of the National Rifle Assn. said that even if West
acted "recklessly," charging him with willful intent is "a big
stretch."</TE>

<HD>Paul Crump, 72; Former Death Row Inmate Wrote Novel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Crump, 72, a former death row inmate whose novel "Burn, Killer,
Burn," described a murderer who commits suicide to avoid being
executed, died Oct. 11 of pneumonia and lung cancer at Chester Mental
Health Center in Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   Crump had been held at the center since 2000 after being convicted
of harassing a family member and violating an order of protection.</LD>
<LD>   Crump served 39 years in prison for shooting a security guard to
death during the robbery of a Chicago meatpacking plant in 1953.</LD>
<TE>   His four accomplices received prison sentences, but Crump was
sentenced to die in the electric chair and escaped 15 dates with the
executioner.</TE>
<TE>   The sentence was later changed to 119 years by Gov. Otto Kerner,
and Crump was paroled in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   While in prison, Crump was inspired by a visit from writer Nelson
Algren and began reading classic literature. His novel was published
in 1962.</TE>
<TE>   Those who backed Crump's efforts for parole, including the Rev.
Billy Graham and gospel singer Mahalia Jackson, said the book proved
that Crump had been rehabilitated. Crump was also the subject of a
documentary by William Friedkin, director of "The Exorcist."</TE>

<HD>Former Priest Pleads Not Guilty to Molestation</HD>
<DH>Ex-cleric faces 29 counts of abuse. In another case, bail
is reduced for a retired clergyman accused of molesting seven girls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former priest pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of child
molestation Thursday as bail for a retired priest charged with
molesting seven girls was halved to $500,000.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Stephen Baker, 54, entered the not-guilty pleas to 29
counts in Downey Superior Court. Baker has previously admitted to
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony that he molested boys.</LD>
<LD>   He was arrested Sept. 25 and freed on $800,000 bail Oct. 7.</LD>
<TE>   Baker allegedly abused a boy between 1976 and 1985. Baker told
Mahony in 1986 that he molested young boys, and was reassigned.
Mahony later approved a secret $1.3-million payment to two men who
said they had been abused by Baker from 1984 to 1999. Baker left the
church in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday during a bail hearing for retired priest G. Neville
Rucker, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christina Fleming disclosed that nine
additional allegations of abuse had been reported to police since
Rucker had been plucked off a cruise ship in the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner Jeffrey M. Harkavy ordered
Rucker's bail reduced from $1 million to $500,000 at the request of
defense attorney Donald Steier.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming disclosed the new allegations after a Probation Department
report recommended that Rucker be released without bail, prosecutors
said.</TE>
<TE>   Steier has maintained that Rucker, who lives in a retirement home
and who entered court in a wheelchair, is not a danger to the
community.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have said Rucker knew he was the subject of an
investigation and was fleeing when he was snatched by authorities
Sept. 27 from a cruise ship that had been diverted to Alaska's
Aleutian Islands</TE>
<TE>   Steier said Rucker was on a two-month vacation cruise.</TE>
<TE>   Rucker is charged with 23 counts of child molestation between 1946
and 1976. He is alleged to have abused seven girls while he worked at
several churches in Los Angeles County, including St. Alphonsus in
East Los Angeles, St. Anthony in El Segundo and St. Agatha in Los
Angeles. All of the girls were younger than 14, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Rucker was one of seven priests removed by Mahony from the
ministry this year when the cardinal implemented a "zero tolerance"
policy for those who had abused minors.</TE>

<HD>Simon Targets Davis' Energy Plan</HD>
<DH>The GOP candidate vows to provide more protection for
consumers if elected. Incumbent cites his rival's Enron ties.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN DIEGO -- Returning to an argument he has made throughout his
gubernatorial campaign, Republican Bill Simon Jr. on Thursday charged
Gov. Gray Davis with failing to respond quickly to the state's power
crisis, and promised that if elected he would better protect
consumers. The GOP candidate said that despite the state's struggle
to keep the lights on during the summer of 2001, Davis still does not
have a long-term plan to solve California's chronic power shortages.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe one round of blackouts isn't enough to compel Mr. Davis to
put forward any proposal to end the energy crisis," Simon told a
friendly audience of several hundred members of the San Diego Rotary
Club at a downtown hotel. "By ignoring the early signs of power
shortages, Davis left us vulnerable to manipulation," Simon added.
"By taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from Enron and other
energy companies, he has tainted his decisions with the air of
corruption."</LD>
<LD>   In a telephone interview, Davis disputed Simon's contentions,
saying that he has not taken any money from Enron in more than two
years. The governor said he acted quickly when the power crunch hit
by protecting consumers from a 400% price increase and getting the
federal government to impose price caps, adding that he has worked to
get new power plants on line.</LD>
<TE>   "He has no basis to talk," the governor said, citing Simon's
onetime participation on the board of Hanover Compressor, a
Houston-based gas industry supplier that was later tied to Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a partner of Enron," Davis said. "When I was calling Enron
to account for misleading us and overpricing electricity, he was
saying, 'Let's give Enron a chance.' "</TE>
<TE>   Simon spokesman Mark Miner said the GOP candidate never worked
with Enron. "To say that he was affiliated with Enron is a complete
lie," Miner said. "He should apologize."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's jabs at Davis' performance during the energy crisis came
as the governor's race heads into its final stretch. Despite having
stumbled several times since the Republican primary, Simon said
Thursday that he remains confident of victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when you're the underdog, as Winston Churchill said, you
must never, never, never give up," he told the Rotary Club. "That's
why I believe that we're going to win in November, because I can feel
the surge, I can feel the momentum." Speaking with reporters after
his speech, Simon said Davis' decision Wednesday to replace all his
negative television commercials with positive ads signals the
governor's anxiety about motivating Democratic voters.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's an indicator that he needs to go back to his base and
shore up his support," the GOP candidate said. "It's an indicator
that he needs to get his own numbers up."</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign officials, however, said that they have turned to
upbeat ads because they are confident that Simon cannot make up the
ground he needs to defeat the governor.</TE>
<TE>   During his address, Simon told the audience that Davis panicked
during the energy crisis "and basically turned it into a
catastrophe." Now, he said, the state is locked into expensive
long-term power contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican nominee said that if elected, he will work to get
the state out of the power-buying business altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he would consolidate the state agencies and regulations
that govern power plants to encourage the construction of more
plants. He said he supports incentives for power carriers to expand
their transmission capacity. In addition, Simon said he would promote
conservation and the use of alternative energy sources. The candidate
read from a letter he received recently from an elderly woman who
complained that her electric bills increased by 300% in one month.</TE>
<TE>   "Something is dreadfully wrong and we need a fighter in our
corner," she wrote. "I am here to tell you and that nice lady that I
am in your corner," Simon said. "I will fight on behalf of honest
solutions and fight to bring the price of electricity down so our
people don't have to make a choice between paying their electricity
bills and paying their mortgage."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he has made large strides in increasing the supply of
electricity through the construction of six power plants. And by
invoking emergency powers, Davis said, he has slashed the amount of
time it takes to get emergency plants on line from a year to 21 days.
Simon's "solution to the energy crisis is for more deregulation,"
Davis said. "He's totally tone-deaf. The only way we got a handle on
this was by re-regulating."</TE>

<LD>Rep. Gary Condit's children are urging people to vote against the man
they say betrayed their father by challenging him in the March
primary for the 18th Congressional District seat.</LD>
<LD>   In Chad and Cadee Condit's one-page letter addressed to "Friends,
neighbors and fellow Democrats," they accuse Dennis Cardoza of being
self-centered.</LD>
<LD>   Cardoza, a Democratic assemblyman from Atwater, was a onetime aide
to Condit (D-Ceres). He beat the incumbent in the primary.</LD>
<TE>   Cardoza, who had initially said he wouldn't run against his
friend, entered the congressional race after Condit became embroiled
in the Chandra Levy scandal. Condit, 54, reportedly told police he
had an affair with the 24-year-old former federal intern. Levy's
skeletal remains were found in May. Police are continuing to search
for her killer, but Condit has never been named a suspect.</TE>

initiative to legalize casino gambling here didn't get enough
signatures to qualify for the Nov. 5 ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The initiative would have amended the state Constitution to
legalize gambling in this North Coast city for 28 years.</LD>

<LD>Closure of three national forests in Southern California because of

Forest. But that could change too.</LD>
<LD>   If a major wildfire erupts or Santa Ana winds develop, Los Padres
could also be closed, U.S. Forest officials said.</LD>
<LD>   For now, hunters from as far as San Bernardino County are
traveling to Los Padres in search of deer. Forest spokeswoman Kathy

<LD>A U.S. Defense Department worker who handles explosives at Ft. Ord
was accused of hoarding them at his home, a law enforcement official
said.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to a domestic violence call, authorities found a cache
of explosive materials -- rocket-launcher tubes, flash and smoke
grenades and detonating cord -- Oct. 6 in sheds outside the home of
Jeffrey Dean Trebler, 38.</LD>
<LD>   Trebler told investigators his job was to accept explosives from
members of the public and then destroy them. "The things he found
interesting, he just took home rather than destroy," a spokesman
said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second time in less than a year, a Campbell woman faced a
judge on drunk driving charges -- but this time she agreed to have
her trial set in a high school cafeteria.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, hundreds of students at Branham High School listened
with a jury to the state's case against Lorain Stanchina, 42. On Aug.
13, she allegedly backed into a pickup truck in a Jack in the Box
drive-through and drove off when confronted by the driver.</LD>
<LD>   Car accidents are the leading cause of death among 15-to
19-year-olds, with alcohol being the primary factor, said Paul Gratz,
director of Traffic Safe Communities Network, the trial-at-school
program coordinator.</LD>

<HD>It's FAA's Call: Game Flyovers Are Ruled Safe</HD>
<DH>Major League Baseball and some security experts object to
waivers allowing banner planes over World Series games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kimi Yoshino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Banner-towing planes are scheduled to fly over Edison International
Field during the World Series despite opposition by Major League
Baseball and local authorities worried about safety risks.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Aviation Administration, which instituted a temporary
ban on the planes above sporting events and large gatherings for the
anniversary of Sept. 11, began granting waivers a few weeks ago at
major events, including the baseball championships.</LD>
<LD>   Federal officials said they do not believe planes pose a terrorist
threat.</LD>
<TE>   But as baseball officials and local authorities scramble to create
a security plan for the high-profile event -- both on the ground and
in the air -- some are questioning the wisdom of allowing the
exemptions.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position for security would be to get a flight restriction
for everybody except emergency [aircraft]," Anaheim Police Sgt. Rick
Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   Some outside experts also expressed puzzlement at the FAA's
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, I'm kind of surprised," said aviation safety expert Rick
Charles. "We're under some unusual conditions, and unusual measures
are called for. I think the FAA is ... pretty much succumbing to
local commercial interests."</TE>
<TE>   Already, the planes have been spotted throughout the Angels'
playoff games, advertising hot tubs, Hondas and more. Even Republican
gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. got in on the act, with this
banner: "Vote Bill Simon for Governor! Go Angels!"</TE>
<TE>   Major League Baseball officials were hoping the waivers would be
reconsidered for the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "This is about safety, of course," said Kevin Hallinan, MLB's
senior vice president of security. "We're continuing our
conversations and dialogue to see if there is a middle ground here
that would allow us to cut back on those flyovers, particularly when
the game begins."</TE>
<TE>   This season, a small plane made an emergency landing in the Edison
Field parking lot. The pilot and passenger were unhurt, but the pilot
had experienced mechanical difficulties, cut away the commercial
banner, touched down in the lot, then crashed through a brick
retaining wall at the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The crash, which occurred a few hours before the Angels game,
highlights the potential safety threat for a stadium packed with
45,000 people and a parking lot jammed with cars, Hallinan said.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for pilots of small planes said the real issue
might have to do with Major League Baseball trying to control
advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Banners, for example, cost about $500 for 30 minutes of flying
time around the stadium, a fraction of the cost of in-park
billboards, said Tom King, president of the Southern California
Aerial Advertisers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "Banner towers are not a security risk," King said. "If somebody
wanted to bomb the stadium with a small airplane, he would be able to
do so anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball's traveling specialized security force -- a team of city
police officers from around the country with experience working
major-league events -- will be on alert for suspicious people and
packages. They will complement the hundreds of Anaheim police
officers and private security guards who will staff the Anaheim
games, Hallinan said.</TE>
<TE>   Hallinan and his crew will sweep the stadium before each game and
secure the ballpark's perimeter. Delivery trucks will be scrutinized
and searched. Cars will be kept a safe distance from Edison Field,
and no bags larger than 14 by 14 by 6 inches will be allowed inside.
Smaller bags will be searched at the gate. In late innings, security
will ring the field to keep fans in their seats, said John Drum,
director of operations for the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is it's another baseball game, but everyone in
the United States and all across the world can watch this game," Drum
said.</TE>

<HD>Deal Will Preserve a Large Area in the Sierra Nevada</HD>
<DH>A conservation easement will prevent development on a
13,000-acre ranch in the scenic Sierra Valley north of Lake Tahoe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Bailey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- A trio of nonprofit groups announced a $2.5-million
deal Thursday to put a 13,000-acre ranch off-limits to development in
the Sierra Valley, a sweeping and scenic alpine bowl north of Lake
Tahoe that is under increasing growth pressure.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement prohibits development on the Bar One cattle ranch,
which sprawls across 10% of the 130,000-acre valley, the biggest in
the Sierra Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   Funding came from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the
state. The deal was struck by the Truckee-based Sierra Business
Council, the California Rangeland Trust and the Nature Conservancy.</LD>
<TE>   The Sierra Valley has only a handful of tiny towns and scattered
ranch homesteads, some dating to the Gold Rush era when Swiss-Italian
families began setting down roots. But the valley, where cows seem to
outnumber humans, is fast coming under pressure from development.</TE>
<TE>   It sits just a half-hour drive from booming Truckee and the Tahoe
north shore, where affordable housing is growing ever more scarce.
The rapidly growing northern suburbs of Reno can also be reached in a
half-hour via the interstate.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, resort towns near the valley's snow-capped rim exert
another kind of growth pressure: the development of second homes and
trophy ranches for the wealthy. As a result, land prices have been
rising in the Sierra Valley. Real estate that used to fetch no more
than $1,000 an acre has lately been selling at triple that price.</TE>
<TE>   Preservation advocates worry that large parcels could be
subdivided into 80-acre plots for high-end residential and resort
development, virtually ending the valley's ranching heritage and
putting increasing pressure on wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   "It's caught in a pincers between some very fast-growing areas,"
said Jim Sayer, Sierra Business Council president. "This is the start
of trying to ensure that the community can stay in ranching."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Sparrowk, co-owner of Bar One, said the effort would help
"keep ranching at the forefront of the Sierra Valley's economy."</TE>
<TE>   Though it once was dominated by the dairy industry, beef and hay
ranches now cover the valley floor. Many of the ranches, which range
in size from less than 1,000 acres to more than 5,000, are owned by
descendants of the original settlers.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the agreement, a conservation easement will allow
the Bar One to continue as an active cattle ranch but will not permit
its sale for development.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement also requires ranch managers to adopt stewardship
measures to help protect the headwaters of the Middle Fork of the
Feather River. In addition, the easement will provide important
foraging for deer and habitat for threatened and endangered species
while preserving a largely unsullied pastoral landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Straddling the Sierra-Plumas county line, the valley is ringed by
7,000-foot peaks topped most of the year by snow. An ancient lake
once covered the entire floor, rim to rim. All that remains of it is
wetlands that feed the Feather River.</TE>
<TE>   Several animal species uncommon in other parts of the Sierra
venture into the vast valley, among them the pronghorn antelope.</TE>
<TE>   The valley also is home to the Sierra's largest concentration of
bird life, and was recently identified by the Audubon Society as a
national priority for protection.</TE>

<HD>Tatyana Velikanova, 70; Dissident Chronicled Soviet Rights
Abuses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tatyana Velikanova, a leading member of the Soviet-era dissident
movement who was arrested and jailed for chronicling human rights
abuses by the authorities, has died in Moscow of cancer. She was 70.</LD>
<LD>   "She was a symbol of the human rights movement," Sergei Kovalyov,
a prominent dissident persecuted by the authorities, said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Velikanova, a mathematician, first defied the authorities in
August 1968, when she appeared on Red Square with her husband and six
other people to protest the Soviet invasion in Czechoslovakia. After
her husband, Konstantin Babitsky, was arrested for taking part in the
protest, Velikanova became an active participant in the dissident
movement.</LD>
<TE>   In 1969, Velikanova helped found the Initiative Group for the
Defense of Human Rights and later played a leading role in publishing
the Chronicle of Current Events, a samizdat, or self-published
bulletin reporting human rights abuses by the authorities and news
about the dissident movement. The Chronicle was the cornerstone of
the dissident movement for many years.</TE>
<TE>   "She was absolutely reliable, a crystally honest person," said
Kovalyov, who worked on the Chronicle alongside Velikanova until his
arrest in 1974. "For me, [Andrei] Sakharov and Velikanova were the
brightest representatives of the Soviet human rights movement."</TE>
<TE>   Sakharov, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his human rights
activities, once hailed Velikanova as an "embodiment of the ...
purity and strength of the Soviet Union's human rights movement."</TE>
<TE>   After years of harassment by the authorities, Velikanova was
arrested in 1979 and sentenced to four years in a prison camp and
five years of exile in the steppes of western Kazakhstan. She was
pardoned by the government in 1987 as part of Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's reforms, but she refused to return to Moscow for half a
year.</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, Velikanova worked as a teacher at a Moscow
school away from the public eye. "She was very successful in that,"
Kovalyov said. He said that Velikanova died Sept. 19 of liver cancer
and was buried in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Velikanova is survived by three children, two brothers and two
sisters.</TE>

<HD>Dump the City Dump, Mayoral Panel Urges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Wendy Thermos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles should stop using Sunshine Canyon Landfill in June 2006
and turn to new technologies to dispose of trash, a mayoral advisory
panel said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The findings by the landfill oversight committee represent the
first official attempt to put a deadline on ending the city's use of
the landfill near Granada Hills.</LD>
<LD>   The dump is a source of irritation for many San Fernando Valley
residents because of the dust, noise and litter generated by trucks
hauling the more than 3,000 tons of trash collected daily from around
the city.</LD>
<TE>   The committee will recommend that the city use waste-to-energy
conversion, large-scale composting and trash-eating bacteria to
eliminate as much garbage as possible from the waste stream.</TE>
<TE>   Anything that cannot be diverted, the committee said, should be
shipped to landfills outside the city by rail.</TE>
<TE>   The committee did not assess whether garbage rates would increase
as a result of the recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Browning-Ferris Industries, which operates Sunshine Canyon
Landfill, has repeatedly said that residents will see higher bills if
the city stops using the dump.</TE>
<TE>   The panel's findings will be forwarded within days to Mayor James
K. Hahn, who will need the consent of the City Council to carry them
out.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor has pledged repeatedly to close the Sunshine Canyon dump
and also Bradley Landfill in Sun Valley, which takes commercial waste
but receives none of the trash collected by city sanitation trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Committee members noted that Sunshine Canyon would still be able
to receive trash from sources outside the city after 2006.</TE>
<TE>   But they said Los Angeles needs to end the practice of forcing
Valley neighborhoods to absorb the trash burden generated by
residents throughout the city.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to say to the city, 'You will find someplace else to put
our trash,' " said committee member Mary Edwards. "It's important,
because it's killing our neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   Edwards persuaded the committee to release its findings before the
Nov. 5 vote on Valley secession.</TE>
<TE>   "These are strong recommendations," she said. "I think people want
to know the city's stand on this issue before they vote."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>NO. 9 IOWA STATE (6-1)</LD>
<LD>   AT NO. 2 OKLAHOMA (6-0)</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   TV: None</TE>
<TE>   Line: Oklahoma by 9.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State update: Seneca Wallace is one of the nation's most
exciting quarterbacks, but he'll be going against a defense
determined to chew up any talk of Wallace contending for the Heisman.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma update: The Sooners picked off three of Chris Simms'
passes and sacked him three times in their 35-24 victory over Texas
last week. Wallace, at 5 feet 10 and 193 pounds, can't absorb much of
a beating -- but first they have to catch him.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: It's a top-10 clash, but Iowa State is a considerable
underdog. Still, the Cyclones gave Florida State a scare in the
opener, so you never know.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Oklahoma -- but wouldn't an Iowa State upset be fun?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 7 NOTRE DAME (6-0)</TE>
<TE>   AT NO. 18 AIR FORCE (6-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Air Force by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame update:  Notre Dame was outgained by Pittsburgh,
402-185 last week -- and won. Now the Irish face the prolific Air
Force triple-option, and although logic suggests they should be able
to handle the option, they've been vulnerable in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force update: California is the only decent team Air Force has
beaten, and that score was 23-21. No other opponent has a winning
record. But should the Falcons get past Notre Dame, Colorado State
might be the only team with a chance to keep them from running the
table.</TE>
<TE>   Story line:  It's time for one of the 10 remaining unbeatens to
fall.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Notre Dame. We'll go with size and speed over offensive
scheme.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 22 WASHINGTON (4-2)</TE>
<TE>   AT NO. 19 USC (4-2)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: USC by 8.</TE>
<TE>   Washington update:  Quarterback Cody Pickett is second in the
nation in total offense at 369.5 yards a game. Sophomore receiver
Reggie Williams had eight receptions for 184 yards and three
touchdowns against Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   USC update:  USC had plenty of trouble with California in a 30-28
victory -- even with the help of a touchdown Pacific 10 Commissioner
Tom Hansen later said was a blown call by officials and shouldn't
have counted. Injuries are a concern, especially with defensive
tackle Shaun Cody out for the season.</TE>
<TE>   Story line:  The loser probably is out of the Pac-10 race.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: USC, but the Trojans can't count on another gift
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 8 TEXAS (5-1)</TE>
<TE>   AT NO. 17 KANSAS STATE (5-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Fox Sports Net</TE>
<TE>   Line: Kansas State by 2.</TE>
<TE>   Texas update: Chris Simms threw three interceptions in the
Longhorns' 35-24 loss to Oklahoma, bringing his record against top-10
teams to 0-4 with a stunning 15 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State update: Although they beat Oklahoma State, 44-9, the
Wildcats had serious problems on special teams, with three blocked
extra points.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Simms and Coach Mack Brown try to get up off the mat
and back in the battle for the Big 12 title game a week after yet
another big-game loss to Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Kansas State. This kind of logic is often flawed, but
Kansas State beat Oklahoma State by 35 a week after Texas beat
Oklahoma State by two.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AUBURN (4-2)</TE>
<TE>   AT FLORIDA (4-3)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 3:45 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN</TE>
<TE>   Line: Florida by 8.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn update: Like Florida, the Tigers are coming off a loss and
badly need a victory. (Auburn lost to Arkansas last week and Florida
fell to Louisiana State.)</TE>
<TE>   Florida update: Three losses already and out of the AP rankings --
and Georgia and Florida State are ahead on the schedule. Quarterback
Rex Grossman is expected to start despite a sprained right knee</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Auburn upset then-No. 1 Florida last season. Now the
Tigers try to add some pain to Ron Zook's rapidly deteriorating first
season as Gator coach.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Florida. With Grossman, Earnest Graham and Taylor
Jacobs, the Gators have too much talent.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA (4-2)</TE>
<TE>   AT CALIFORNIA (4-3)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: TBS.</TE>
<TE>   Line: UCLA by 3.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA update: The Bruins had their shot against Oregon and Chris
Griffith missed a late field goal in a 31-30 loss. Still, the offense
has matured in recent weeks, with Cory Paus playing well and Tyler
Ebell adding punch to the running game.</TE>
<TE>   Cal update: The resurgent Bears have lost three games by a total
of 14 points -- all to teams in the top 25 (Air Force, Washington
State and USC). Cal leads the Pac-10 in scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: This is a key game in the battle for the conference's
second tier. Winner is in good shape; loser starts to slip.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: UCLA. Cal's defense has a ways to go.</TE>

<KH>Angel Report / NOTES</KH>
<HD>Rodriguez Giving a Sneak Preview</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No need to sway the voters with novelties, videos or mass mailings.
With each postseason strikeout before a national media contingent,
Francisco Rodriguez takes another giant step toward winning the
American League rookie-of-the-year award--in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   The Angel phenom pitched only 5 2/3 innings during the regular
season, so he retains rookie eligibility next season. In September,
he tied Nolan Ryan's franchise record with eight consecutive
strikeouts. In October, he became the first pitcher in major league
history to record his first four victories in postseason play and the
first to earn four postseason victories before age 21.</LD>
<LD>   "He certainly has name recognition," Angel pitching coach Bud
Black said.</LD>
<TE>   That name recognition, among the baseball writers who vote for the
award, makes Rodriguez the early favorite for 2003. Although setup
men rarely receive consideration for rookie of the year--Troy
Percival finished fourth in 1995, when he set up Lee
Smith--Rodriguez's postseason heroics this year do more to promote
him than any marketing campaign could do next year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the biggest stage in our industry," said Tim Mead, the
Angels' vice president of communications. "Even if you put the best
marketing machine in the world behind him, you can't market any
better than this."</TE>
<TE>   In the Angels' 42-year history, only outfielder Tim Salmon has won
the rookie award. Rodriguez said he is not concerned with following
in Salmon's footsteps.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too early to worry about that," Rodriguez said. "This year
comes first. Next year, we'll see."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angel hitters tore through the American League playoffs,
hitting .328 with 17 home runs in nine games. Because timing is so
critical to hitting, are the Angels concerned that the five-day
layoff between the end of the league championship series and the
start of the World Series will disrupt their timing?</TE>
<TE>   "Not at all," center fielder Darin Erstad said. "It's not going to
matter. It's like taking five days off if you're hurt. You come back
and, once you get in there, everything is fine.</TE>
<TE>   "You wait your whole life to play in the World Series, and I think
I can wait five days."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Erstad took ground balls at first base Thursday, for what he said
was the first time since spring training. With National League rules
in force when the World Series shifts to San Francisco, the Angel
coaches told Erstad he could play first base for an inning or two,
after a double-switch or other substitution.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them, let me at least stand out there and take some ground
balls so I can get the crust off my glove," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The way Angel Manager Mike Scioscia figures it, Dodger fans will
be rooting for the Angels during the World Series, if only as the
lesser of two evils. As a former Dodger catcher, Scioscia is well
aware that a Dodger fan's two favorite teams are the Dodgers and
whoever is playing the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   "They might be die-hard National League fans, but I can't imagine
them rooting for the Giants," Scioscia said. "That might be one step
too far."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Wooden, perhaps the most beloved sports figure in Southern
California, is scheduled to throw out the ceremonial first pitch
before Game 2 Sunday.... Jarrod Washburn, the Angels' Game 1 starter,
was excused from workouts Thursday because he had a mild case of flu.
Dr. Lewis Yocum, the Angels' medical director, said Washburn is
expected to start as scheduled Saturday.... Those big red noise
sticks cost about 60 cents a pair to make. At mlb.com, the official
Web site of the major leagues, you can buy a pair -- for $4. The
Angels will give away 20,000 sticks at a 6:30 p.m. rally tonight at
Downtown Disney, adjacent to Disneyland. Admission is free.... Angel
first baseman Scott Spiezio on the World Series media onslaught: "I
usually do one interview a week. Now I'm doing one every couple of
minutes."</TE>

<HD>O'Brien Has Plenty of Options</HD>
<DH>Trainer has 10 of 104 horses pre-entered for Breeders' Cup.
Rock of Gibraltar, Hawk Wing could run in Classic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In late August, his Ballydoyle training complex near Dublin
devastated by a virus that had most of the horses coughing, Irish
trainer Aidan O'Brien figured his year was ruined.</LD>
<LD>   But a month later, most of the horses got well, O'Brien force-fed
them into some of the toughest races in Europe and now the young
conditioner is armed with a solid group that could win one or more of
the eight Breeders' Cup races at Arlington Park in suburban Chicago
on Oct. 26.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 104 horses pre-entered Thursday for the 19th Breeders' Cup,
10 are trained by O'Brien, whose most difficult problem seems to be
picking the right races in which to run Rock Of Gibraltar and Hawk
Wing, the 3-year-old stable standouts who are eligible for more than
one race.</LD>
<TE>   By Wednesday, when entries are made and post positions drawn,
O'Brien must decide whether to mix or match. The races under
consideration are the $4-million Classic on dirt and the $1-million
Mile on grass.</TE>
<TE>   "The Classic is a big pot," said O'Brien, "although it would be a
different distance and surface for Rock Of Gibraltar. Nothing is
written in stone. It's possible that both of them could line up in
the Classic. I definitely think Rock Of Gibraltar would have a chance
if he ran in the Classic. But we'll see how they travel [early next
week] and then make the decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Rock Of Gibraltar has won a record seven consecutive Group One
races in England, Ireland and France, but has never run farther than
a mile. The Classic is 1 1/4 miles, a race that O'Brien, who turned
33 Wednesday, almost won in 2000, when his Giant's Causeway lost by a
neck to Tiznow at Churchill Downs. O'Brien got his only Breeders' Cup
victory last year, with Johannesburg in the Juvenile.</TE>
<TE>   British bookmakers list Rock Of Gibraltar as the favorite in the
Mile and another O'Brien colt, High Chaparral, as the favorite in the
1 1/2-mile Breeders' Cup Turf. O'Brien pre-entered five 2-year-olds
in the Juvenile, although he is likely to run only Hold That Tiger
and Van Nistelrooy, who was bought for $6.4 million as a yearling in
Kentucky. O'Brien's three other Juvenile eligibles are expected to
run Saturday in Newmarket, England.</TE>
<TE>   Hawk Wing has won four of nine starts and earned $1.4 million,
about $200,000 less than Rock of Gibraltar, but he's won only once
this year, finishing second four times. Having run three times at 1
1/4 miles or farther, Hawk Wing would appear to be better equipped
for a dirt debut in the Classic. Susan Magnier owns Hawk Wing and
runs Rock Of Gibraltar in a partnership with Sir Alex Ferguson,
manager of the renowned Manchester United soccer team.</TE>
<TE>   High Chaparral had won six consecutive races before his
third-place finish in the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on Oct. 6. The Arc
winner, Godolphin Racing's Marienbard, has been retired to stud and
will begin his career as a stallion next year in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen horses, the maximum, have been pre-entered in the
Classic. Besides the O'Brien pair, the others are Medaglia d'Oro,
Came Home, War Emblem, Evening Attire, Harlan's Holiday, Macho Uno,
Momentum, Perfect Drift, Milwaukee Brew, Volponi, E Dubai and Dollar
Bill. In a race that lacks a standout favorite, Medaglia d'Oro might
draw the most support by post time. The 3-year-old colt hasn't run
since his Travers win on Aug. 24 and will be facing older horses for
the first time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Also heading for stud service in Japan is Charismatic, who won the
Kentucky Derby and the Preakness in 1999. Charismatic spent his first
three breeding seasons at Lane's End Farm in Kentucky.... The
forecast for the Chicago area next week is for no rain until Friday,
when there is a 30% chance of scattered showers. There is a 20%
chance of rain on Breeders' Cup day, with temperatures in the 50s....
The California Horse Racing Board has approved 271 days of
thoroughbred racing in Southern California, starting with the Santa
Anita meet that opens Dec. 26 and runs through April 20. Other dates
for 2003 are Hollywood Park, April 23-July 20; Del Mar, July 23-Sept.
10; Fairplex Park, Sept. 12-28; Oak Tree at Santa Anita, Oct. 1-Nov.
9, and Hollywood Park, Nov. 12-Dec. 21.</TE>

<HD>At 0-6, They Can't Even Have a Good Bye</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>--Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Daugherty of the Cincinnati Post commenting on -- make that
ridiculing -- the 0-6 Bengals: "The Bengals have been outscored,
123-17, in the first halves of their games. They're out of games so
quickly, they still have time to scalp tickets....</LD>
<LD>   "The Bengals play Bye Week Sunday. They're three-point underdogs
in the early line."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   More Bengals: This writer can commiserate with Daugherty. I
covered the 1962 L.A. Rams for The Times. The team had a 1-12-1
record, the only win coming against the San Francisco 49ers, 28-14,
midway through the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NFL record for fumbles?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Picking on Phil: Dwight Perry in the Seattle Times: "News flash:
Phil Jackson is the new spokesman for the Positive Coaching Alliance,
which strives to make youth sports fun.</TE>
<TE>   "Said Jackson, claiming that coaches need better training to
handle young athletes: 'Our society puts too much emphasis on
sports.'</TE>
<TE>   "Exhibit A: Paying a coach $6 million a year -- like Phil
Jackson."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Still a showboat: Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News,
defending controversial 49er receiver Terrell Owens: "He is not a
fake, he does not back down, he backs up most of what he says, and
about once a season he either spikes the ball on the Texas Stadium
star or accuses his coach of being too nice or signs a ball after the
game-winning touchdown or who knows what next?"</TE>
<TE>   Comment: We dread to think about it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All that matters: When Chicago Blackhawk Coach Brian Sutter named
center Alexi Zhamnov team captain, Zhamnov admitted he hasn't always
been classic captain material.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a captain once before when I was 12," Zhamnov recalled. "I
took the team out of school and we went to a movie, missing a test. I
couldn't be captain after that, but the team liked me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tough crowd: Steve Rosenbloom in the Chicago Tribune: "University
of Illinois police booted 89 people from Memorial Stadium during the
Packers-Bears game, many for fighting, and I'm thinking, they
should've been given spots on the defensive line."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bored already: Mike Lupica in the New York Daily News: "It's only
taken a couple of weeks for the Angels' Rally Monkey to become more
tiresome than a George Steinbrenner concession speech."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Quarterback Warren Moon, 161, with four franchises.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Young and impressionable: Mississippi State football Coach Jackie
Sherrill, defending his mistake-prone players: "You can say I do a
terrible job. You can say I can't coach. But don't say those things
about 18-, 19-, 20-year-old kids."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Palmer, who pitched in six
World Series, commenting on Barry Bonds to Ron Rapoport of the
Chicago Sun-Times: "You just don't want to pitch to him. You watch
'SportsCenter' and you see that most home-run pitches are down the
middle, but that's not the case with Bonds. You throw him low and
away and it's over the fence."</TE>

<LD>CHICAGO AT DETROIT</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The line: Chicago by 3.</LD>
<TE>   Quick slant: Cosmo wants Harrington! Chicago wants Chandler!</TE>
<TE>   Plot: In its current issue, Cosmopolitan magazine includes Detroit
rookie quarterback Joey Harrington among its "Hottest Hunks in the
U.S." (In Detroit, one win in three starts for the Lions qualifies
one for "hot" status. Not sure about Cosmo's requirements.)
Meanwhile, in Chicago, where hot hunks are slabs of beef charred at
Ditka's, fans and media have tired of Jim Miller and are clamoring
for the city's most eligible backup quarterback -- this year, it's
Chris Chandler. The Bears have an injury-riddled defense and the
league's 29th-ranked rushing attack. Yes, it's Miller's fault.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Bears Botch Decisive Field Goal -- Chicago
Wants Chandler!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BUFFALO AT MIAMI</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Miami by 4.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Dolphins are 5-1 and reeling.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: For a few more hours, Miami rules the football world, with
the Hurricanes topping the college polls and the Dolphins perched in
the treacherous position as consensus No. 1 in the thousands of NFL
"power rankings," printed weekly because they need to be revised
weekly. Next week will be no different, as the Dolphins try to
outscore Buffalo's potent offense without quarterback Jay Fiedler
(out six to eight weeks because of a broken thumb) and, most likely,
first-team wide receivers Oronde Gadsden and Chris Chambers, also
injured. New quarterback Ray Lucas last started a game in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Dolphins Don't Party Like It's 1999"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CAROLINA AT ATLANTA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Atlanta by 4.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Having seen enough, Vick says, "Hit me!"</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Chris Weinke versus Doug Johnson -- this one had the makings
of, hmm, OK, a matchup that might have interested Florida State and
Florida fans before they knew better. Last week, Johnson, filling in
for injured Michael Vick, led the Falcons to a 17-10 road victory
over the Giants. Which explains why Vick declared himself ready long
before Coach Dan Reeves would. Vick says his shoulder is "95%" and
maintains his only concern is getting hit by a 300-pound Panther
lineman. That drew a laugh from Reeves: "I'd say there's a real good
chance Mike will get hit on Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Welcome to October: Weinke's In, Panthers Lose
Fourth Straight"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MINNESOTA AT NEW YORK JETS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New York by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Chad and Randy marshall forward.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Five years after they connected for 24 touchdowns for the
1997 Marshall Thundering Herd, quarterback Chad Pennington and
receiver Randy Moss are reunited, amid less than pleasant
circumstances. Pennington makes his second start for the 1-4 Jets,
Moss may or may not deem a few passes worthy of his attention for the
1-4 Vikings. Pennington has had to answer many questions about his
old college teammate, who declined all interview requests, presumably
because he was miffed he didn't think of Terrell Owens'
hide-the-pen-in-the-sock Monday night routine first.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Thundering Herd of Viking Fans Storms Off Moss
Bandwagon"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SEATTLE AT ST. LOUIS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: St. Louis by 5.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Bulgermania!</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Now that the Rams' first out-of-nowhere, feel-good, Chunky
Soup-ready quarterback story is sidelined because of a broken finger,
St. Louis has gone bonkers over its third-stringer-turned-hero in the
conquest of the Raiders, Marc Bulger. Bulger didn't throw much --
only 21 passes, a decent quarter's production for Kurt Warner -- but
he turned three into touchdowns, causing the NFC to name him its
offensive player of the week and Ram Coach Mike Martz to pretty much
lose it. Martz on Bulger: "Actually, he's the best passer we have."
Actual quote. Yes, it had been a long time between Ram victories.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Martz on Bulger: Well, OK, But He's Still
Better Than Dilfer"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DENVER AT KANSAS CITY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Denver by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Dick Vermeil's toast to the NFL: Points all around!</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Chiefs lead the NFL in scoring, averaging more than 34
points a game, and they are 3-3, suggesting the Kansas City defense
might not be quite up to snuff. Or possibly the worst defense of all
time. The Chiefs have allowed 2,580 total yards -- on pace to break
the '81 Colts' NFL record of 6,793. The Chiefs have also yielded
1,889 yards passing -- on pace to break the '95 Falcons' record of
4,541. On the plus side: Chief quarterback Trent Green has flung
enough touchdown passes to outscore his defense every other week. On
the down side: Green has a bad ankle and is only 60-40 to play
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Four More TDs for Holmes; Chiefs Fall to 3-4"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SAN FRANCISCO AT NEW ORLEANS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New Orleans by 2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Terrell Owens, travel writer, visits New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Plot:  Take some dictation, Mr. Owens: The Saints are the best
team in the NFC. New Orleans is 5-1, same as Tampa Bay and Green Bay,
with one difference: New Orleans is 2-0 against Tampa Bay and Green
Bay. The last time the Saints and 49ers met, San Francisco closed out
New Orleans' 0-4 season-ending skid, 38-0. Much has changed since
then, including the 49ers, who have injuries to receiver J.J. Stokes,
safety Zack Bronson and defensive end John Engelberger and are coming
off a short week. Write on, say the Saints.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "T.O. and His Pen: Mightier Than the Sword, but
Not the Saints"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   JACKSONVILLE AT BALTIMORE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Baltimore by 1.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Who's more valuable, Ray Lewis or Mark Brunell?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Raven linebacker Ray Lewis and Jaguar quarterback Mark
Brunell are both questionable for this unexpectedly important game.
Last week, the Ravens played without Lewis and, after yielding a
first-possession touchdown, held Indianapolis to five field goals and
60 yards rushing in a 22-20 Colt victory. At the same time, Brunell
was knocked out of the Jaguars' 23-14 loss to Tennessee by a
first-quarter hit by Samari Rolle, who denied intent to injure. "As
much as he throws the ball to me," Rolle quipped, "why would I try to
hurt him?" Brunell's backup is rookie David Garrard. Take a guess.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "It's Redman Over Garrard; Let's Leave It at
That"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOUSTON AT CLEVELAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Cleveland by 9.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Browns remember their past, forget their past.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Apparently, it isn't enough that the Cleveland Browns'
defensive players resemble traffic cones on the field. Management has
decreed they will dress the part as well, forcing the Browns to don
orange "classic" jerseys for their game against Houston. Yes, back in
1954, the Browns actually wore orange jerseys, once, in a 35-7 win
over Chicago -- then donated the shirts to a local high school after
fans complained they couldn't read the numbers. Orange football
jerseys in Cleveland? What, weekly nightmares of John Elway and the
Broncos in the playoffs aren't enough?</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Browns to Fans: Orange You Glad Houston's on
the Schedule?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SAN DIEGO AT OAKLAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Oakland by 7.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Chargers arrive in Oakland 5-1. Al Davis prepares the
usual skulduggery.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Dave Casper is scheduled to make an appearance at Sunday's
game but no, not at tight end. Casper is 51, only 11 years older than
Jerry Rice -- those two have more to talk about than Rice and, say,
rookie Phillip Buchanon. Casper is there to pick up his Hall of Fame
ring and flaunt it in the faces of the rival Chargers, most of them
too young to remember what Casper used to do to San Diego twice a
year. Pull up a chair, young Chargers, and listen closely: It was
nasty, it was very scary and it is about to happen again.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Casper, Ghosts Haunt Chargers"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DALLAS AT ARIZONA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Arizona by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Wake up, Arizona! The Cardinals are 3-2!</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Somewhat amazingly, the Cardinals have a winning record this
late in the season. Not quite full believers, the Arizona populace
has yet to embrace these upstarts -- or even fill more than half the
seats for home games. Searching for a reason, Coach Dave McGinnis
might have stumbled on it during last Sunday's week off. "I just
watched the ball games, like a normal human being," he told Sports
Illustrated, calling the action "fun stuff.... I can see why this
league is the 10,000-pound monster it is. It was that good. It was
that compelling." Of course it was. The Cardinals weren't playing.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Never mind, Arizona. The Cardinals Are .500"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WASHINGTON AT GREEN BAY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Green Bay by 7.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Steve Spurrier is convinced he has found the right
quarterback. It must be the receivers' fault.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Packers are 5-1, 22-6 since mid-2000 and Brett Favre is
68-12 at Lambeau Field, where Sunday's foregone conclusion is
scheduled. Perhaps for his own amusement, Washington Coach Spurrier
has decided to mess with his receivers -- beginning by benching
Derrius Thompson, then reinstating him, then benching the team's
receptions leader, Rod Gardner, and replacing him with Chris Doering.
Gardner is "baffled," but Doering suggests it "lets you know nothing
is permanent." In Spurrier's world, everybody is temporary help.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Spurrier Shuffles Back to D.C. 2-4"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TAMPA BAY AT PHILADELPHIA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Philadelphia by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: The Why Tony Dungy's Now In Indianapolis Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Jon Gruden, who served as the Eagles' offensive coordinator
from 1992-94, knows why he's here: His predecessor, Tony Dungy,
couldn't win a playoff game at Veterans Stadium -- couldn't figure
out how to score a touchdown in 21-3 and 31-9 defeats -- and so the
Buccaneers moved him out and traded for Gruden. Gruden's 5-1 in
Tampa, with the league's top-ranked defense, and the Eagles are 3-2
with the No. 3 defense. Gruden remembers driving to work during his
Philly years and being greeted by fans flipping him off. "Really, it
was fun, honest," Gruden told ESPN.com. Just as it will be Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "No Change, No Fun for Gruden, Bucs"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   INDIANAPOLIS AT PITTSBURGH</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Monday, 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7</TE>
<TE>   The line: Pittsburgh by 4.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Remember 1968!</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Since the Colts last defeated the Steelers in Pittsburgh,
the Colts lost to the Jets in the Super Bowl, the Colts defeated the
Cowboys in the Super Bowl, Bert Jones came and went, the Baltimore
Colts came and went. Baltimore or Indianapolis, the Colts haven't won
at Pittsburgh since 1968, and are 1-11 all-time there. Despite a 4-1
record and an upgraded defense, they are underdogs again. Three
reasons: 1) the Colts needed five field goals last week to hold off
the Ravens; 2) the Steelers have rediscovered the forward pass with
Tommy Maddox; 3) the game is in Pittsburgh.</TE>

<LD>Chris Downs ran for a career-high 212 yards and three touchdowns
Thursday night at College Park, Md., as Maryland cruised to its
fourth consecutive victory, 34-10 over Atlantic Coast Conference
rival Georgia Tech.</LD>
<LD>   Held to 29 yards in seven carries in the first half, Downs ran for
109 yards and two scores in the third quarter as Maryland (5-2, 1-1
in the ACC) turned a 6-3 lead into a 20-3 advantage.</LD>
<LD>   The Yellow Jackets (4-3, 1-3), in their first season under Chan
Gailey, endured their most lopsided loss since a 34-7 loss to Florida
State in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   Maryland Coach Ralph Friedgen said his staff made adjustments in
the blocking scheme at halftime. "I think our offensive line stepped
up, and Chris Downs ... well, what can I tell you?" Friedgen said.
"He had a phenomenal game."</TE>

<TE>   Quarterback Brooks Bollinger has fanned the fire of the
Wisconsin-Ohio State rivalry with a jab at the Buckeyes' stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Bollinger, who will start against the No. 4 Buckeyes Saturday in
Madison, Wis., inscribed "The Horseshoe.... They built it. We own it"
on a picture he sent to a woman in Ohio who is a Wisconsin fan,
according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. The woman's husband happens
to be an Ohio State fan, and the photo ended up in the hands of
former Buckeye quarterback and ESPN commentator Kirk Herbstreit.</TE>
<TE>   Bollinger led the Badgers to victories at Ohio State in 1999 and
2001. In 2000, after the Buckeyes won at Wisconsin's Camp Randall
Stadium, Ohio State players celebrated by dancing on the "W" at
midfield. The Badgers returned the favor last year after their 20-17
victory.</TE>

<TE>   It easy to see that San Francisco is the winner here. Under San
Francisco, the site lists a number of stadium-close bars. Under
Anaheim, is this: "Unlike all new stadiums in this country, Edison
Field is not part of a downtown hub of bars and restaurants. It is
Anaheim, which means it requires a car to get anywhere (much like its

<HD>Baker Unsure About Future</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The World Series is starting Saturday, and Dusty Baker, three-time
National League manager of the year, can't be certain whether this
will be his final assignment for the San Francisco Giants.</LD>
<LD>   Will Baker have his expiring contract extended? Does he want it
extended? Could he be moving to the Seattle Mariners as Lou
Piniella's successor, or to some other venue where the outdoor
options aren't as plentiful as in the Bay Area or Pacific Northwest?</LD>
<LD>   The media portrait is one of a deteriorating relationship between
Baker and Peter Magowan, the Giants' managing general partner. The
widespread reports touch on Baker's admitted belief that Magowan
created "undue pressure" with his spring boast that the Giants were a
World Series-caliber team and the best Giant team in the last 10
years. They theorize Magowan is resentful and envious of Baker's
acclaim and success.</LD>
<TE>   In a phone interview, Magowan insisted that "Dusty and I are not
in a contest for credit" and said his manager's uncertain status
should not be a World Series distraction.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed out that it was agreed to in spring training that
Baker's situation, along with that of General Manager Brian Sabean,
would not be addressed until the final game has been played.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be no surprise to anybody that those were the ground
rules," Magowan said. "A lot of people are writing with very little
information. They can speculate all they want, but this has nothing
to do with being envious of Dusty. I don't want any credit and don't
need any credit. But when people write about the Giants and all they
write about is Dusty Baker and Barry Bonds, I don't think that is
reflecting what has made us as successful as we are.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a consistently good team, the second-best record in the
National League over the last 10 years, and nobody writes that story.
The public perception is we've got a team with the best player in the
game and nothing else, and that's just false.</TE>
<TE>   "All I have ever tried to do was be sure our players got the
credit for being as good as they are, our general manager got the
credit for putting these players here and our fans got the credit for
giving us the support and revenue that allows us to bring these
players together.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not trying to knock Dusty Baker. I hired him when he was a
coach and I rehired him when we were in last place. He's the
second-highest-paid manager in the game [next to Joe Torre]. This
does not reflect an owner who doesn't like the performance of his
manager. If people want to write that they think that's the case, be
my guest, but all I'm saying is that Dusty and Barry have gotten
their fully deserved credit, that I'm glad for their success and
proud of them, but I want to see the other elements get the credit
they deserve as well."</TE>
<TE>   Magowan is walking a public-relations high wire, faced with a fan
backlash if it is perceived the popular Baker has been forced out.</TE>
<TE>   The manager chooses his words carefully. His focus and energy, he
insists, is on the World Series, and he doesn't make personal
decisions any more without consulting God, without a divine answer in
some form.</TE>
<TE>   In a phone interview before the Giants arrived in Anaheim on
Thursday, Baker said: "I haven't been offered anything, it's getting
late, and I've been here a long time, 15 years with the Giants, 10 as
manager. In every contract situation, people point to this problem or
that problem, this guy or that guy, but sometimes there doesn't have
to be a problem.... I was offered a four-year contract last time and
I changed it to two because I don't want to wear out my welcome.
Understand what I'm talking about?"</TE>
<TE>   If Baker seemed to be saying that his welcome is wearing thin, he
refused to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wants to make this the focus, but right now the focus
is the World Series," he said. "I'll worry about me in 10 or 12 days
and that's the God's truth. Right now I'm the same guy who was on the
Dodgers. It's about us right now. In any manager or player contract
situation, if you win, everything about your own situation turns out
all right. That's the order and preference I'm taking."</TE>

<LD>There was little reason for the Mighty Ducks to push the panic button
Thursday. The seriously concerned button, however, needed to be
pressed.</LD>
<LD>   Sifting through the rubble of the Ducks' 4-2 loss to the Kings on
Wednesday was the order of the day.</LD>
<LD>   "I watched it two times since [on video] and it's no prettier,"
Coach Mike Babcock said.</LD>
<TE>   "There was no excuse for the way we competed. They are accountable
to each other, they are accountable to the organization and they are
accountable to themselves." That was the message Babcock delivered
when he met with the team's veterans, individually and in small
groups. There was a sense of urgency in the dressing room. The Ducks,
already 1-3, play Vancouver tonight, Colorado Sunday and then head
off on a five-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   "We got to get this going right now, we got to play some desperate
hockey," team captain Paul Kariya said. "I thought the first three
games went well, even though we won only one of them. I saw good
signs. I thought it was definitely something we could build on, which
is why [Wednesday] night was such a disappointment."</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Francisco Manager Dusty Baker said Thursday he had not set the
25-man roster for the World Series or decided on a designated hitter
for the games played at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Rosters do not have to be finalized until 10 a.m. Saturday, giving
Baker time to consider his options.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not keeping it a secret from anybody, I'm still pondering,"
he said. "We haven't decided what our roster is going to be yet, but
I've got some flexibility."</LD>
<TE>   The designated hitter is Baker's biggest concern.</TE>
<TE>   Pitchers will hit when the series shifts to Pacific Bell Park for
Game 3 on Tuesday, but someone must fill the role for the Giants in
the games at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels seemingly have an edge because of the productive Brad
Fullmer-Shawn Wooten platoon, but Baker believes the Giants could get
some good matchups.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got some guys who hit left-handers well, some guys who are
high-fastball hitters against high-fastball pitchers," he said. "They
have some guys over there who get left-handers out better than
right-handers, even though they're right-handed pitchers, so we just
have to go over things, watch some video and come up with the best
choices."</TE>
<TE>   Utilityman Shawon Dunston, who batted .231 in 72 games, and
infielder Ramon Martinez, who also played in 72 games and hit .271,
are among the right-handed candidates with Angel left-hander Jarrod
Washburn scheduled to start Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   They batted .229 and .254, respectively, against left-handers
during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The rally monkey was a hot topic of conversation in the American
League championship series.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants apparently get a kick out of the gimmick.</TE>
<TE>   "I ain't afraid of no monkey," Baker said. "Now, if they had a
gorilla it'd be a different thing. I wasn't scared of Cheetah [the
monkey in the Tarzan movies] but I was scared of King Kong."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel closer Troy Percival, who played under Baker in 1992 on the
Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League, said he's not
surprised the Giants won the National League pennant.</TE>
<TE>   "What a great manager. What a great guy to play for," Percival
said. "I can see one reason why they are where they are."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Compton Centennial football players will play tonight's Pioneer
League opener against Morningside at Inglewood's Coleman Stadium
after attending the funeral for teammate Joseph Carter, who was the
victim of a drive-by shooting Oct. 6.</LD>
<LD>   Carter, a 16-year-old junior defensive back, and Joshua Wyatt, a
17-year-old former Centennial student, were victims of a gang-related
shooting outside a fast-food restaurant a mile from the school, said
Sgt. Martin Rodriguez of the Sheriff's Department homicide bureau.
Wyatt died at the scene and Carter died Oct. 8.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez said it isn't known if Carter, Wyatt or an unidentified
third teenager who fled the scene were gang members, but three
suspects in the shooting were known to have ties to a local gang.</LD>
<TE>   The funeral service for Carter is scheduled for 11 a.m. at
Faithful Central Bible Church in Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Fred Jackson said the 5-foot-5, 140-pound Carter was a
reserve who played in the Apaches' first five games.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very inspirational kid to the team," said Jackson, in
his first year as head coach. "He had a real desire and love for the
game. Joseph was a well-liked kid throughout the school."</TE>

<TE>   The Southern Section Council rejected a proposal Thursday that
would have allowed high school coaches in some instances to coach
their own players during off-season competition.</TE>
<TE>   The council is expected to take another look at the controversial
association rule, which prohibits coaches from running off-season
programs that involve their own players, at its next meeting Jan. 23.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern Section is the only section of the 10 in California
that still has an association rule, but attempts to repeal or alter
it have met with resistance.</TE>
<TE>   In other action:</TE>
<TE>   * The council took under advisement, rather than vote on, a
proposal that would set the maximum number of matches that a golfer
can participate in at 24, including four tournaments. The proposal
will be reviewed again in January.</TE>
<TE>   * Commissioner Jim Staunton announced that he was instituting a
$75 fee for eligibility appeals. The section rules on 300 to 500
eligibility cases a year, Staunton said, and about 20%-25% go to
appeal. He said funds would be used to defray costs incurred in
holding appeal sessions and to pay for annual seminars on eligibility
that his staff plans to implement.</TE>
<TE>   Staunton also announced the banning of plastic, tube-shaped noise
sticks from high school events because they violate section
guidelines prohibiting the use of noisemakers. The ban will be in
place for next month's playoffs.</TE>

<LD>Marquis Malcolm rushed for 225 yards and three touchdowns and Tustin
knocked off host Orange El Modena, 35-22, in the Century League
opener for both teams Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   The battle between the top two teams in the league figured to come
down to the ground game. El Modena (3-3, 0-1) rushed for 151 yards,
less than half its season average, while the visiting Tillers (2-4,
1-0) piled up 372 yards.</LD>
<LD>   El Modena scored on its opening drive but went three-and-out on
two of its next three possessions as Tustin built a 28-7 lead.
Malcolm, who had only 50 yards in the first half, rushed for 175
after the break, including runs of 41, 34 and 31 yards. The Vanguards
picked up 159 of their 260 yards and scored twice in the final
quarter.</LD>

<TE>   Los Alamitos 42, Huntington Beach 21 -- The Griffins surrendered
310 yards rushing and two touchdowns to Patrick Harrigan but didn't
allow him to score in the second half and The Times' No. 5 ranked
team took the Sunset League opener at Long Beach Veterans Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Senior quarterback Jeff Kline accounted for 293 yards and four
touchdowns for the Griffins (5-0-1). Kline, playing the entire game
with Justin Elway out two weeks with a separated shoulder, threw for
175 yards and two scores and ran for 118 yards and two touchdowns in
eight carries.</TE>
<TE>   With the game tied, 21-21, Harrigan opened the second half with a
39-yard run but the Oilers (4-2) couldn't sustain any drives.
Harrigan fumbled twice in the second half.</TE>

of the game for a 14-0 lead, then held Arlington (4-2) to only one
first down and 35 total yards in the first half. The Lions received
its second first down on a facemask penalty late in the third
quarter, then scored two plays later on a 32-yard touchdown pass from
John Sandoval to Carl Brewster.</TE>

<TE>   The junior rushed 15 times for 78 yards and touchdowns of 13 and
six yards. He gave the Conquerors (5-1) a 24-0 lead in the third
quarter on his punt return, which came after South Hills had a
36-yard scoring pass nullified by a penalty.</TE>
<TE>   South Hills (4-2), ranked No. 3 in Division VII, twice failed to
score in the first half when inside Los Altos' five-yard line. The

<DL></DL>
<LD>When newspapers and recruiting services were touting high school
football players to watch this season, running back Patrick Harrigan
of Huntington Beach High was rarely mentioned.</LD>
<LD>   He was an unknown talent because the Oilers finished 2-8 last
season.</LD>
<LD>   But first-year Coach Mike Groscost knew a secret about Harrigan.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew he had some great ability," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At midseason, Harrigan is the leading rusher in the Southland. He
has gained 300 or more yards in four of Huntington Beach's five
games. His 1,252 yards rushing already tops the 908 yards he gained
last season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a surprise to me," Harrigan said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Groscost: "He can do a lot of things. He can run up into the
hole and bang and make moves on people. He has great vision. He sees
things other backs can't."</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-1, 205-pound senior helped Huntington Beach win four of
its five nonleague games.</TE>
<TE>   "I never imagined this in my life," he said. "It's always been my
dream to have that winning year. I know it's going to be a lot harder
in league. I just hope we rise as a team."</TE>
<TE>   The Oilers began Sunset League play Thursday night against Los
Alamitos, No. 5 in The Times' rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Harrigan said losing 20 pounds has made him faster and improved
his elusiveness. But most of all, he gives credit to Groscost for
changing the team's mental outlook.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave us a positive attitude and a sense of direction,"
Harrigan said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another running back who has burst onto the scene is senior Jacob
Flowe of Chino. He's No. 3 in the Southland in touchdowns with 17.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, he was the backup to Kes Ekpre-Olomu. This season,
Coach John Monger decided to put both in the same backfield.</TE>
<TE>   Flowe, 6-1, 210 pounds, could be a fullback in college. He has
worked hard on becoming proficient as a blocker, runner and receiver.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, he's just an all-purpose back," Monger said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Despite sending its last three quarterbacks to California,
Stanford and UCLA, respectively, Newhall Hart fans weren't expecting
big things from junior quarterback Sean Norton. They would have
settled for ordinary.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Norton has been extraordinary. He hasn't thrown an
interception in 156 passes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty excited to go through the first five games without an
interception," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Boller, Kyle Matter and Matt Moore, respectively, never
accomplished that feat.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's a growing consensus that Mission Viejo (5-0) has the best
defense in the Southern Section.</TE>
<TE>   One reason is the play of linemen Chris Cole and Justin Williams.
Cole has eight tackles for losses and four sacks. Williams has seven
sacks.</TE>
<TE>   Is it too early to start contemplating a Hart-Mission Viejo
matchup in the Division II playoffs?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   La Puente Coach Rick Ward is thrilled with the play of 6-0 junior
quarterback Gene Ortiz, who has thrown 17 touchdown passes with only
one interception during the team's 4-1 start.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz, who also plays baseball, started as a sophomore for La
Puente, which is 2-0 in the Montview League. He figures to become the
school's all-time passing leader before he graduates.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The CaliFlorida Bowl IV is set for Jan. 4 at the Coliseum, and the
California team has selected an all-star collection of coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Redell of Westlake Village Oaks Christian will be head coach.
His assistants include Jim Benkert of Westlake Village Westlake, Jose
Casagran of L.A. Roosevelt, Ed Lalau of Wilmington Banning, Ron Mims
of Pasadena Muir, Willie Guillory of Long Beach Jordan and Pete Duffy
of L.A. Fremont.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There are lots of colleges wishing Thousand Oaks kicker Jesse
Ainsworth hadn't committed to Arizona State during the summer.
Ainsworth is seven of nine on field-goal attempts and has sent 11 of
12 kickoffs into the end zone for touchbacks.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In terms of winning percentage, Isaias Enriquez is the hottest rider
at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   The jockey, who is clicking at about 9% for the year, won with six
of his first 16 mounts at the Oak Tree meet.</LD>
<LD>   Those hoping to take advantage of this hot streak will have only
one chance this afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   Enriquez has a single mount on the eight-race card -- 20-1 shot
Serious Smoke in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   More power to Enriquez if he's able to get that one home. A
2-year-old Smokester gelding, he needed a trip to Pomona to break his
maiden, outlasting a weak field of $32,000 California breds in his
fourth start. In his first three races, at Hollywood Park and Del
Mar, Serious Smoke, who is owned by JP Racing, Inc. and trained by
Joe Parga, had finished fifth, fourth and sixth.</TE>
<TE>   There isn't much to get excited about on the rest of the program.
There are six favorites who are 7-5 or less on the morning line.
Starship Saratoga, who is dropping two levels, is 6-5 in the second;
Sligo Bay, who has been facing better, is 6-5 in the third; Ghost
Memo, who is facing a weak field of 2-year-old maiden claimers, is
6-5 in the fourth; Unfurl The Flag, who was second in a minor stakes,
is 7-5 in the fifth; Miss Continental, another dropper, is 7-5 in the
sixth, and Exsexy Cop, who is dropping for trainer Bob Baffert after
failing as the favorite at Bay Meadows, is 7-5 in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Graded stakes winners Shiny Band and Critical Eye
head the field in today's eighth at Belmont Park, a $58,000 allowance
at 1 1/16 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: A Bunch Of Maniacs. A 5-year-old Bertrando gelding, he
will be seeking his fourth consecutive victory and fifth in his last
six starts in tonight's seventh at Bay Meadows. He is co-owned and
trained by Jerry Hollendorfer.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Billy Badgett Jr. and Joe Aquilino. The trainers are a
combined one for 41 at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Decimate and
Excellentcharacter in the first, singling Starship Saratoga in the
second and using Sligo Bay, Venator, Trompolino and Hataab in the
third.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/32. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $27.80/$195.40. Total money bet: $224.</TE>

<HD>Long Drought Finally Ends for Smolinski</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>-- Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bryan Smolinski's second-period goal in Wednesday's 4-2 victory over
the Mighty Ducks was the first one he scored that was not into an
empty net in 43 regular-season games, a drought that dated to Jan. 5.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought he was very good," Coach Andy Murray said. "It's not
good enough for Bryan to be an average player. He has to extend
himself every night."</LD>
<LD>   Said Smolinski: "Well, I did have a couple goals in the playoffs,
so it wasn't completely frustrating. But it's nice to have the monkey
off my back."</LD>
<TE>   Smolinski sat out the last two periods Thursday night after
suffering a charley horse in a first-period collision with Brad
Larsen of Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After backup Jamie Storr stopped 31 shots against the Ducks, Felix
Potvin was back in goal against the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no goalie controversy," Murray said. "We have a clearly
defined ranking system, and Felix is No. 1. We have the best 1-a
goalie in the league in Jamie; we're very fortunate to have him. And
we have more back-to-back games [14 sets] this season, so that makes
him even more valuable."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jaroslav Bednar again filled in for Ziggy Palffy on the top line,
but Murray said Palffy, who has a strained groin, would "definitely"
play Saturday night against Vancouver.</TE>

<HD>Kings Are on a Bad Frequency</HD>
<DH>A familiar foe, Colorado, leaves them with a familiar
feeling after 4-1 loss, L.A.'s first of season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings don't always play the Colorado Avalanche.</LD>
<LD>   It only seems that way.</LD>
<LD>   Including exhibitions and the playoffs, the Kings have played 120
games since the end of the 2000-01 regular season, 23 against the
Avalanche.</LD>
<TE>   While familiarity sometimes breeds contempt, as in the unbecoming
verbal sparring between the coaches that enlivened a first-round
Stanley Cup playoff series last spring, it has also resulted in
spirited hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Such was the case again Thursday night at Staples Center, where
the Avalanche maintained the upper hand in the series, doubling its
goal total from its first two games and defeating the Kings, 4-1, in
front of a sellout crowd of 18,118.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the first in three games for the heretofore
struggling Avalanche while the loss was the first in four for the
Kings, who fell one victory short of equaling the best four-game
start in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   "They were hungry," King goaltender Felix Potvin said of the
Avalanche, which broke open a tight game with three goals in the last
13 1/2 minutes. "They outplayed us real bad in the first period, and
it's always hard to get back into the game against those guys. I
thought we battled, but we ran a little short at the end."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Forsberg scored two goals, his first regular-season goals in
19 months, and defenseman Adam Foote scored a back-breaking goal
midway through the third period for the Avalanche, which also got an
empty-net goal from Joe Sakic.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Belanger's goal for the Kings was his third in four games.</TE>
<TE>   All those games between the Kings and Avalanche couldn't help but
create a rivalry. "And obviously," King Coach Andy Murray said before
the game, "playing two seven-game playoff series only heightened it."</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche won both.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there seems to be little bad blood between the two teams,
other than Murray and Avalanche counterpart Bob Hartley exchanging
barbs last April.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be respect," Murray said. "We've fought tooth and
nail for two straight years in a 14-game playoff series. Of course
you respect the guy that's across from you, how hard he's battling
you, because you know that if you don't bring your best effort, you
might get beat."</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche scored only two goals in its first two games, a 1-1
tie against the Dallas Stars and a 2-1 loss to the Boston Bruins, but
took the lead 4 minutes 3 seconds into Thursday's game.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after tennis star Serena Williams dropped the ceremonial
first puck, Brad Chartrand of the Kings was called for roughing Radim
Vrbata. Forsberg, a force in the playoffs last season, scored his
first regular-season goal since March 11, 2001, netting the rebound
of a shot by defenseman Rob Blake.</TE>
<TE>   Already without Ziggy Palffy, who sat out for the second game in a
row because of a strained groin, and playing their second game in two
nights, the Kings played the last two periods without Bryan
Smolinski, who suffered a charley horse in a first-period collision
with Avalanche winger Brad Larsen.</TE>
<TE>   But they tied the score at 6:49 of the second period, Belanger
scoring a short-handed goal. With Adam Deadmarsh in the penalty box,
Ian Laperriere gathered a loose puck and started a two-on-one
breakaway before feeding a pass in the middle to the streaking
Belanger. Belanger, who scored 17 goals in his first two seasons,
beat goaltender Patrick Roy with a shot to the short side.</TE>
<TE>   Foote, however, gave the Avalanche the lead for good at 6:32 of
the third period, emerging from the penalty box and, with defenseman
Lubomir Visnovsky in pursuit, skating alone into the attacking zone
before flipping a shot past Potvin.</TE>

<KH>LAKER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Buss Ponders Size of Roster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laker owner Jerry Buss, courtside for Thursday night's exhibition
game against the Golden State Warriors, cringed at the fuss that
surrounded him for two days, starting the moment he grabbed his neck
in front of all those celebrities.</LD>
<LD>   "I tried to get off the stretcher twice on the way out," he said.
"I kept telling them I was OK."</LD>
<LD>   In his signature jeans and pullover sweater, Buss appeared hale,
having conducted team business for much of the day.</LD>
<TE>   Already well over the luxury-tax threshold and being tempted to
keep 13 or even 14 players, Buss met with team officials Thursday on
the subject of a roster that will be set in a week. The Lakers open
the season Oct. 29.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a meeting with Mitch Kupchak today," Buss said of his
general manager. "We made some decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Kupchak reiterated that a player who could help -- particularly in
light of injuries to Shaquille O'Neal and Mark Madsen -- could be
carried into the season, and that the cost would be minimal.
Contracts do not become fully guaranteed until nearly halfway through
the season.</TE>
<TE>   Center Soumaila Samake and guard Jannero Pargo have played well
enough for the Lakers to consider the cost of retaining them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buss spoke Wednesday night to Magic Johnson, who is considering an
offer from the Seattle SuperSonics to buy into that franchise and
divest himself of his partial Laker ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said earlier this week that he was leaning against the
deal, and Buss said he got the same sense in his conversation with
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said he was told to expect to be cleared to run in
"probably about a week," but not before his surgeon, Dr. Robert Mohr,
chastised him for rushing ahead of his rehabilitation schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me not to do that anymore," O'Neal said before Thursday's
game at the Arrowhead Pond. "He said I abused it."</TE>
<TE>   That said, team officials do not believe O'Neal did any lasting
damage by running on his surgically repaired toe earlier than
recommended.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers defeated the Warriors, 91-89, with Kobe Bryant scoring
22 points.</TE>
<TE>   Samake and Samaki Walker started in the frontcourt.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry, who has a mild case of tendinitis in his right knee,
did not dress. Brian Shaw has a strained left groin this week and did
not play.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox played in his first exhibition game. He missed the first
three because of a strained lower back.</TE>

<LD>Twenty-three 3-year-olds will compete tonight in three trials for the
$250,000 Los Alamitos Derby. The 10 fastest qualifiers in the
400-yard trials will advance to the Nov. 1 finals of the Grade I.</LD>
<LD>   Check Him Out, who won the Golden State Derby on Aug. 17, is among
the entrants; he will break from the rail in the seventh race, the
second trial.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by a partnership that includes trainer Blane Schvaneveldt,
Check Him Out will be ridden by Sam Thompson. A win would be the
Hennessy colt's ninth in 17 starts.</LD>
<TE>   The top two contenders in the first trial are Mountain Snow, first
or second in seven of nine races, and Miami Cartel, a consistent
Corona Cartel gelding trained by Paul Jones.</TE>
<TE>   A field of eight will go in the final trial, topped by Panther
Mountain, winner of eight of 14; Golden State Derby runner-up A Tac
First and Harley Man.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Special Reunion. 2. Alybobbob. 3. Ageless. 4. Bys
Bug. 5. Himes. 6. Mountain Snow. 7. Check Him Out. 8. Panther
Mountain. 9. Toll Tax Bac. 10. Evolution One.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Special Reunion and Sixes Quick in the first, Ambusher
and Alybobbob in the second, Ageless, Red Hot Tarasco and Miss Snazzy
Cash in the third and single Bys Bug in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Sassy Smith is better than his recent efforts
and could rebound in the sixth. Tiny Rocket Dash faltered at the
start in his last race and gets a new jockey, Eddie Garcia, in the
seventh.</TE>

at Foxboro, Mass
MVP: Marco Etcheverry, D.C. United
Eddie Pope's header off a corner kick four
minutes into overtime capped a D.C. United
rally from a two-goal deficit. The Galaxy
had taken a 2-0 lead on a rain-soaked
field on goals by Eduardo Hurtado and
Chris Armas. But D.C. came back behind
Etcheverry, who assisted on all three of
his team's goals

MVP: Ben Olsen, D.C. United
The Galaxy managed only two shots on goal,
and Olsen's goal in extra time at the end
of the first half after a poor clearance
by goalkeeper Kevin Hartman gave D.C.
United a two-goal lead that proved
decisive

<HD>Pomona Exhibit to Salute Prudhomme</HD>

<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He had one of the best nicknames in sports, and after 40 years of
participation, the public is getting its chance to take a closer look
at Don "the Snake" Prudhomme.</LD>
<LD>   Voted No. 3 last year among the NHRA's 50 greatest drivers,
Prudhomme will be honored at the NHRA Motorsports Museum in Pomona
with an exhibit that opens Saturday and runs through January.</LD>
<LD>   Though not big on sentimentality, Prudhomme is happy to be
showcased, with five of his cars on display, including the 1970
yellow Hot Wheels Plymouth Barracuda funny car that helped galvanize
the rivalry between the Snake and Tom "the Mongoose" McEwen.</LD>
<TE>   "It was quite a unique car back in its day," Prudhomme said. "It
was about a five-year project to get all the parts and pieces
[back].... That's the one that launched the Mongoose-Snake rivalry.
It was just parts and pieces around the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Back in those days, we couldn't afford to keep the car and park
it. You had to sell it to make enough money to build the next one. We
were just a bunch of hot-rodders, and we couldn't afford that. I
never thought there was any sentimental value, I was just trying to
make a living. We were always trying to build a bigger and better
one."</TE>
<TE>   Prudhomme won his first NHRA race, the 1965 Winternationals, and
went on to a 49-19 record in final-round appearances -- 35 victories
in 45 funny car finals, and 14 in 23 top fuel finals. His 49 national
victories rank fourth among NHRA leaders.</TE>
<TE>   He is in his seventh season as a team owner, with both a top
fueler and funny cars. Larry Dixon is on the verge of winning the
first top fuel title for Prudhomme. Ron Capps and Tommy Johnson Jr.
drive Prudhomme's funny cars. Capps is seventh, and Johnson eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "Snake is the one who made me aware that you could make a career
out of this in any aspect you wanted," said Dixon, 35, who was in
junior high when he started hanging around Prudhomme's Northridge
shop, and became Prudhomme's successor in 1995.</TE>

<TE>   Brandon Bernstein, who will replace his retiring father, six-time
NHRA champion Kenny Bernstein, next season, earned his top fuel
license this week after making two runs at Texas Motorplex in the
Budweiser King dragster.</TE>
<TE>   The NHRA mandates that a top fuel applicant drive two runs in 5.20
seconds or better, at 275 mph or faster. Bernstein's runs were 4.621
seconds at 322.23 mph, and 4.699 at 320.62. Brandon, 30, won the
Pacific division alcohol dragster crown last year but did not race
this year while acclimating himself to his father's routine.</TE>
<TE>   At least one opponent, Dixon, who has a 108-point lead over the
senior Bernstein, thinks Brandon will pick up right where his dad is
leaving off.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell people that Brandon has the potential to go quicker and
faster than his dad because he's 20 to 30 pounds lighter," Dixon
said. "That makes a big difference in those cars."</TE>

<TE>   Billy Hamill left little doubt who is the top rider in the United
States when he won Costa Mesa Speedway's national championship last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Hamill finished ahead of three-time champion Mike Faria, Gary
Hicks, defending champion Chris Manchester and John Cook in the
four-lap final.</TE>
<TE>   It is the first Costa Mesa title for Hamill, who has won three
nationals sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Assn., including
this year's three-race championship series.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, the AMA championship is the one that's recognized,
and it would be nice to see Costa Mesa and the AMA unify," said
Hamill, a Monrovia native now living in Carlsbad, who rides
professionally in the British Elite League for Coventry. "I think it
takes away from both of them. But we just unified the title."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since April, Ricky Carmichael failed to win a
race, and it cost him a championship as Honda rider Mike LaRocco put
together solid performances on consecutive nights to win the THQ
United States Open in Las Vegas. It ended Carmichael's 15-race
winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Carmichael finished fifth in the first night's 20-minute moto
after spinning out while leading on Lap 5. He won the second night's
moto, but LaRocco's third-place finish was enough to win the overall
title.</TE>
<TE>   Carmichael finished second, followed by Timmy Ferry and Chad Reed.</TE>
<TE>   "This season has been a phenomenon, a season you never expect,"
said Carmichael, who was trying to sweep Supercross, Motocross and
U.S. Open titles in consecutive seasons.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR is requiring its teams in Winston Cup, Busch Grand National
and Craftsman Truck series to use spotters in designated areas during
practice sessions, beginning with this week's events. The change was
made after Eric Martin was killed Oct. 9 at Lowe's Motor Speedway
during practice in an ARCA race. Martin had crashed, told his crew he
was OK, but about 15 seconds later was struck in the driver's side
door by a car driven by Deborah Renshaw.</TE>
<TE>   Former Indy Racing League driver Stevie Reeves, who spots for
Steve Park, suggests NASCAR go a step further and put caution lights
inside the cockpit as the IRL does.</TE>
<TE>   "While it won't tell you what or where, it would raise your
awareness level and even a slow-talking spotter wouldn't leave you
hanging," Reeves said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Roger Penske's Winston Cup drivers, Rusty Wallace and Ryan Newman,
will switch from Fords to Dodges next season. Newman is fourth, and
Wallace fifth in the standings. Bill Elliott, in eighth place, is the
highest-ranking Dodge driver.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Despite his stunning victory in only his second Winston Cup race,
Jamie McMurray won't be racing injured Sterling Marlin's Dodge at
Martinsville, Va., this weekend. McMurray will honor his Busch series
commitment in Memphis, Tenn. Mike Bliss will drive the Winston Cup
car this week only.</TE>

<TE>   Chris MacClugage of Baldwin Park had first- and second-place
finishes at the 21st International Jet Sports Boating Assn., World
Finals at Lake Havasu City, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   MacClugage won the Pro Runabout 1200 title by finishing first in
both 25-lap motos. He also took second in Pro Ski Superstock by
finishing fourth and first in two motos.</TE>
<TE>   MacClugage's Kawasaki teammate, Dustin Motzouris of South Africa,
won the Pro Ski Superstock title with 1-2 finishes in those motos.</TE>

<KH>ON BASEBALL / THE WORLD SERIES ANGELS VS. SAN FRANCISCO</KH>
<HD>Force Plays</HD>
<DH>Baker and Scioscia left the Dodger organization under
circumstances not of their choosing</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who knows, says Mike Scioscia, when and where a managerial
opportunity is going to arise?</LD>
<LD>   There is no "God-given ordainment" that it will happen with this
team or that team, Scioscia says, because "that's not the way the
system works, and it shouldn't."</LD>
<LD>   The way the system works, Mike Scioscia is in the World Series as
manager of the Angels and Dusty Baker is in it as manager of the San
Francisco Giants. They were once more than teammates with the
Dodgers, and if Baker was the undisputed clubhouse leader on those
Dodger teams of the late '70s and early '80s and a mentor to the
young Scioscia, it is not a stretch to think that Baker might have
ended up on the same track to manage the Dodgers as Scioscia would
seem to have been in the mid- and late '90s.</LD>
<TE>   "I know how hard his club has played, how hard Dusty has worked,
and I know what we've done on our side," Scioscia said. "I think it's
just an incredible accomplishment to get this far, and when you have
a guy on the other side who I respect as much as anybody I've ever
met, it's going to be fun and going to be a challenge. But I just
don't think there's any irony there."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not. Maybe you can't guarantee when and where that
managerial opportunity is going to evolve.</TE>
<TE>   But if it isn't ironic that it could have happened -- and maybe
should have happened for Baker and Scioscia with the Dodgers -- isn't
it ironic that it didn't because these two men who had been so
important in recent Dodger history were forced to leave the
organization in two of the most distasteful and disgraceful episodes
in that organization's recent history?</TE>
<TE>   "Both," Baker says, "forced out."</TE>
<TE>   Tarred, in Baker's case, by rumors and innuendos of drug
involvement, simply because he had grown close to the troubled Steve
Howe and had tried to give Howe the same guidance he'd given Scioscia
and the other young players. And because his brother, Victor, was a
financial advisor to more than half a dozen Dodgers and management
suspected him of being more than that and the Bakers of having too
much clubhouse influence.</TE>
<TE>   After eight years with the Dodgers, a period in which he played on
five playoff teams and three World Series teams, Baker was granted
free agency and signed with the Giants in 1984, after the Dodgers had
violated his contract by trying to trade him to the Oakland A's.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia left the Dodgers after managing their triple-A farm team
in Albuquerque in 1999, his 23 years as catcher, major league bench
coach, minor league catching coordinator and manager in the
organization, trashed when Kevin Malone came in and uprooted many of
those responsible for Dodger continuity, after Malone's minor league
coordinators, Jim Benedict and Rick Sofield, had turned the
Albuquerque experience into a nightmare for Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   The details were chronicled in a recent column -- "It was as if
the years of loyalty to the Dodgers meant nothing," said Mickey
Hatcher, Scioscia's batting coach then and now -- but Scioscia plays
it down. He acknowledges there were clashes and differences of
opinion with Malone's people but that the primary reason he jumped
off what had been that fast track to the managerial office in L.A.
was that he felt he was ready for a major league opportunity and no
longer saw it happening with the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "I talked with Kevin Malone that winter and they obviously had a
lot they wanted to do and it wasn't as if I was saying, 'Hey, I want
a major league job or else,' " Scioscia said. "It was, 'What's the
future? Where is the organization going?' and at that time it was
very unclear and I think with the opportunities that I thought were
going to be out there that it was best to leave and see what was
available. I have no hard feelings. No one is guaranteed a job."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia found what he was looking for with the Angels, and the
Angels found what they had long been looking for in Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   No one understands the issue of guarantees better than Baker.</TE>
<TE>   He is a man who has beaten prostate cancer, a three-time manager
of the year with an expiring contract and there is no certainty he
will be retained, or that he wants to be retained amid what is
portrayed as a deteriorating relationship with Peter Magowan, the
Giants' managing general partner.</TE>
<TE>   If his valuable performance with the Dodgers can be buried by
mysterious drug rumors, who is to say his popularity in the Bay Area
will lead to a new contract there?</TE>
<TE>   Does his departure from the Dodgers still weigh on him?</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes," Baker said, "but it doesn't bother me to the point
where I should have to relive it again, because those were very tough
times for me and my family and the real end of my career because I
never played regularly again, even though I knew I could still play,
still hit, still earn a lot of money."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Baker said, it "almost broke me as a man, broke my
spirit," but it "can either eat you up or you can get on with your
life and it also made me stronger and a better person." It became
part of "my formulation as a person and manager," and "not one to
take a whole bunch of stuff if I don't feel it's right and I don't
feel I should take it, like my team's slogan: 'We don't start
nothing, but we don't take nothing either.'</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, people don't understand what's inside and what's caused
this to be inside, and I get perturbed when they talk about my
sensitivity to criticism and all that stuff because they don't know
what I went through my first year in L.A. [when he struggled after
being traded by the Atlanta Braves] and what I went through at the
end there and having people drop all that innuendo on me after I had
left a whole lot of bones, ligaments and tendons out on the field.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a bunch of times I didn't have to play, but I played
for us, for the team, and then I hit .260 and suddenly I'm on drugs.
I mean, dude, people don't know, don't think about that, when they
talk about my sensitivity and all that."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia doesn't have to be told who Baker is, what he is.</TE>
<TE>   It was as if one leader was passing the baton to the other when
the young catcher came up to stay in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   "Dusty was definitely the leader on that club, the common
denominator, and whether it was in the clubhouse or in the back of
the plane, there were so many times he dragged me out of a card game
and said, 'Hey, we're going to talk, go over hitters, let's go,' "
Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "His favorite line was, 'Hey, you're messin' with my World Series
share,' and his point was that it's going to take contributions from
everybody to get the team where it needed to be, and, as a young
catcher on a championship-caliber club, I had a unique
responsibility. He wanted to make sure that part of it was as good as
it could be, and that was not only important to the success of our
club but to the esteem of a young player, and it came from his
genuine caring for people. He wanted to be sure that if I got the
opportunity to play, I made the most of it because he wanted me to
succeed."</TE>
<TE>   For Baker, it was nothing more than what Henry Aaron and so many
others had done for him and an "important thing on a team. I mean,
it's important that you don't simply possess the knowledge you
acquire, because you don't possess it, you give it to someone else,
you pass it along. Scioscia and I were locker mates and I remember so
many afternoons in Vero Beach when he would sit at the feet of guys
like Roy Campanella and John Roseboro and listen to them talk about
catching."</TE>
<TE>   Now, the Giants and Angels are prepared to play the first
wild-card World Series and there should be no asterisk appended
because they have laid waste to the rest of the deck, each having
eliminated two division winners and basically roared down the stretch
in August and September.</TE>
<TE>   Now too, as the Angels turn their back on years of futility and
Baker puts to rest his previous playoff frustrations, he gets to
experience an October reunion with "homies" from the Riverside
neighborhood where he grew up before moving to Sacramento, with Angel
coaches Alfredo Griffin, Bud Black, Ron Roenicke and Hatcher, who
crossed paths with him in important ways at other times in his
career, even with General Manager Bill Stoneman, the only pitcher to
have struck him out four times in a game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of Scioscia and the Angels," Baker said. "I knew it
wasn't going to take them long to be good, and you realized how good
they were when the A's won those 20 straight games and the Angels
were only two or three behind. In any other circumstances, at any
other time of the year or division, if they hadn't been playing as
good as they were, they might have been 15 or 16 back."</TE>
<TE>   Baker was talking via phone, and laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to watch out for Scioscia," he said. "He's not scared
and he's smart about it. I dug Mike from Day 1. He had a toughness
and intelligence you don't often see in a young player. You know he
has the Angels' attention because they're playing situational
baseball, good fundamental baseball the way he knows how to play, the
way we were taught to play in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The way Baker had taught Scioscia before Dodger blue took on a new
meaning for the mentor and, much later, for his apprentice.</TE>

<HD>No Monkey Would Be Bad News for Giants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Underdogs and rally monkeys?</LD>
<LD>   Peter Magowan, managing general partner of the San Francisco
Giants, likes the idea of both in the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, he's not at all intimidated by the Angels'
scoreboard simian?</LD>
<TE>   "One way of looking at it is that he's cute," Magowan said. "The
other way of looking at it is that if we see him, we're ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, if by any chance I should fall asleep during the World
Series and wake up to see that monkey on the scoreboard, I'll know
we've taken the lead, and that's where we need to be."</TE>
<TE>   Monkey business aside, Magowan predicted the Series should "excite
America."</TE>
<TE>   "You had four underdogs win each of the playoffs and I think
America roots for the underdog," Magowan said. "Now you have the two
biggest underdogs in the World Series. It should be interesting. Both
teams sail into it with the wind at their backs."</TE>
<TE>   He meant that both eliminated two division winners to reach the
World Series after blazing through the last six weeks of the regular
season.</TE>
<TE>   In the Giants' case, he said, out-competing the Dodgers for the
wild card ("they didn't lose it, we won it") set the tone, and a near
week of rest should benefit an older team.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he took pride in reaching the World Series with a tighter
payroll than customarily seen in the Fall Classic, Magowan laughed
and said, "I do, but only in Los Angeles would somebody refer to
somebody else's $75-million payroll as tight," referring to the
Dodgers' $105-million payroll. "We're spending more than we should be
spending, and our level of spending will cause us to lose money, even
leading the league in attendance and reaching the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "But we felt that the right thing for our franchise was to spend
the money with this team because we felt we had our best chance in 10
years. If we didn't do it this year with a 37-year-old catcher, a
34-year-old second baseman and a 38-year-old left fielder, etc., we
might lose out on the best opportunity we've had.</TE>
<TE>   "Under no circumstances are we able to spend what the Dodgers
spend, but hopefully over time the new labor agreement is going to
narrow those differences. We're going to have to pay a lot more in
revenue sharing now, but if it helps improve competitive balance on a
national scale, there will be more interest in baseball and every
team will benefit. The guys with the most revenue should share it
with the guys who have the least, and the more we can get surprises
in the World Series like this year, the better it is for the game."</TE>

<HD>Sluman Has Share of Lead at Disney World Classic</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeff Sluman shot a bogey-free nine-under par 63 Thursday to grab a
share of the lead after the first round at the Disney World Classic
at Lake Buena Vista, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Amid good conditions, 5-foot-5 Hidemichi Tanaka of Japan made 10
birdies to tie Sluman and Bob Burns, who is 118th on the money list
and needs a good week to secure his PGA Tour card for next year.</LD>
<LD>   Scott Hoch was among those at 64, and Stuart Appleby continued his
strong play from last week's Las Vegas tournament with a 65.</LD>
<TE>   Tiger Woods, playing for the first time since the Ryder Cup, was
in a large group at 66. "I'll take it," said Woods, who didn't hit
the ball particularly well but made enough putts to post his 18th
consecutive round at par or better.</TE>
<TE>   Woods was in the first grade when Sluman jump-started his career
20 years ago by winning at Disney World on the now-defunct Space
Coast Tour. The purse was $100,000; for this year's tournament, it's
$3.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Sluman did just about everything right on Thursday, with seven of
his birdies from inside six feet.</TE>
<TE>   He atoned for his only big mistake by making a 35-footer for
birdie on No. 10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colin Montgomerie defeated Fred Funk, 3 and 2, in their 36-hole
first-round match at the World Match Play Championship in Virginia
Water, England. Montgomerie will next play British Open champion
Ernie Els.</TE>
<TE>   In other matches, Ireland's Padraig Harrington defeated Canadian
Mike Weir, 4 and 3, and will face Sergio Garcia in the quarterfinals.
Vijay Singh won, 1 up, over England's Justin Rose, setting up a match
against Retief Goosen.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth match will be completed today because darkness stopped
play. Nick Faldo and Michael Campbell were all square after 42 holes,
with defending champion Ian Woosnam awaiting the winner.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Andre Agassi needed three sets to defeat Spaniard Feliciano Lopez
and reach the quarterfinals of the inaugural Madrid Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi won, 7-6 (6), 6-7 (8), 7-5, before a boisterous
center-court crowd at the Pabellon de Cristal.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi will next play French Open finalist Juan Carlos Ferrero,
who rallied to beat fellow Spaniard Alex Corretja, 3-6, 6-0, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Moya blew a one-set lead and a match point in the third set
before his home fans, losing to the Czech Republic's Jiri Novak, 6-7
(2), 6-4, 7-5, in another third-round match. Novak will play Paradorn
Srichaphan, who defeated Ivan Ljubicic, 6-4, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Alexandra Stevenson smacked 16 aces to defeat fifth-seeded Jelena
Dokic, 7-6 (6), 4-6, 7-5, and reach the Swisscom Challenge
quarterfinals at Zurich.</TE>
<TE>   Daniela Hantuchova fought off four match points and beat Elena
Dementieva, 3-6, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (6). Kim Clijsters advanced by
defeating Amanda Coetzer, 6-1, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   Meghann Shaughnessy of the United States pulled out of her match
at the VUB Open in Bratislava, Slovakia, because of a stomachache,
one of five seeded players to exit.</TE>
<TE>   In other matches, eighth-seeded Laura Granville was upset by
qualifier Iveta Benesova, 6-3, 6-4, and wild-card entry Eva Fislova
beat fourth-seeded Elena Likhovtseva, 6-3, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Chang defeated former UCLA player Zack Fleishman in the
second round of the USTA Challenger of Burbank. Chang, who will face
Brazil's Ricardo Mello in a quarterfinal match today, beat Fleishman,
6-4, 5-7, 6-2. In other second-round matches involving U.S. players,
Michael Russell downed Michael Joyce, 6-3, 6-2, and Brian Vahaly beat
Jack Brasington, 6-1, 6-2. Mello beat Robert Kendrick, 6-4, 6-2, to
advance.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball</TE>
<TE>   Lou Piniella doesn't know where he'll manage next, but it won't be
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Red Sox President Larry Lucchino said that the team has not asked
for permission to talk to the Mariner manager and doesn't plan to do
so.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Mets and Tampa Bay Devil Rays have expressed interest
in Piniella, but neither team has agreed with the Mariners on
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Daily News and Newsday reported that the Mets also
have received permission from Oakland to speak to Manager Art Howe.
Howe has a year left on his contract, but the A's have told the Mets
they would not seek compensation for releasing him.</TE>
<TE>   Passings</TE>
<TE>   Bob Gregg, known in auto racing as "Bullet Bob the Barefoot Boy"
because of his penchant for racing shoeless, has died at 82. Gregg,
who died Monday in Vancouver, Wash., raced on the West Coast for six
decades and once took the rookie test for the Indianapolis 500.</TE>

<HD>Owens Fined for Fashion, Not Autograph</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Terrell Owens was fined $5,000 Thursday by the NFL -- for an untucked
shirttail, not for his autograph touchdown celebration.</LD>
<LD>   Owens wasn't punished for pulling a pen from his sock to sign the
football after a touchdown catch in the San Francisco 49ers' 28-21
victory over Seattle on Monday night. Instead, the league sent him a
letter containing a much more common, minor fine for equipment
violations.</LD>
<LD>   Owens called it "nonsense ... a very nit-picky thing."</LD>
<TE>   "It states on the notice that I specifically wore my shirt out
during the game," Owens said. "I constantly tucked it in throughout
the course of the game, and people were tugging on me, and it just
came out."</TE>
<TE>   After beating cornerback Shawn Springs for the winning touchdown
in the fourth quarter, Owens produced a pen, signed the football and
presented it to his financial advisor in the front row.</TE>
<TE>   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Owens won't be fined or suspended
for the move, but similar displays will be punished.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Raider cornerback Charles Woodson was upgraded to probable
for Sunday's game against San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Woodson, a four-time all-pro, hasn't played or practiced with the
Raiders since injuring his shoulder in the second quarter of
Oakland's victory over Pittsburgh on Sept. 15.</TE>
<TE>   But Woodson has been working out on his own for several days, and
has shown enough progress.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta Falcon Coach Dan Reeves upgraded Michael Vick from
questionable to probable after the quarterback practiced without
pain.</TE>
<TE>   Vick, who suffered a sprain in his right, non-throwing shoulder in
an Oct. 6 loss to Tampa Bay, missed last week's 17-10 win at New
York.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Insisting that their teammate got a "raw deal," the Denver Broncos
plan to chip in to help cover the salary Kenoy Kennedy will lose
during a suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy was suspended without pay for one game because of his
helmet-to-helmet hit on Miami receiver Chris Chambers on Sunday
night. The suspension will cost Kennedy $25,294.</TE>
<TE>   Including two earlier fines this season, Kennedy has been fined a
total of $42,794 -- nearly 10% of his $430,000 base salary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Make it three consecutive seasons that former all-pro offensive
lineman Leon Searcy has missed because of injuries. Searcy underwent
surgery to repair a torn right triceps tendon and will not play this
season. The 32-year-old Searcy was competing for a starting job with
the Miami Dolphins when he got hurt Aug. 29.... Quarterback Joe
Germaine, a former Ohio State standout, was signed to the Cincinnati
Bengals' practice squad. The team released cornerback LaVar Glover.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Minnesota Wild no longer considers a victory over the Dallas
Stars to be an upset.</LD>
<LD>   Marian Gaborik scored two goals and Manny Fernandez made 33 saves,
giving the unbeaten Wild a 3-1 victory over the Stars on Thursday
night at St. Paul, Minn.</LD>
<LD>   "I come to work thinking not, 'How much are we going to lose by,'
but 'If we keep it tight, we can play with them,' " Fernandez said.
"I'm not going to lie. I thought we had a chance from the start."</LD>
<TE>   Pascal Dupuis had two assists for Minnesota (3-0-1), which handed
Dallas its first loss.</TE>
<TE>   Gaborik, the Wild's first-ever draft pick, scored his first two
goals of the season and reached 50 for his career.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 3, Calgary 3 -- Joe Thornton assisted on all three Bruin
goals in a tie with the Flames at Calgary, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   A streaker scaled the glass near the penalty box during a stoppage
in play with just over five minutes to play and went onto the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing only a pair of red socks, he slipped when his feet touched
down, and he landed hard on his back. He was apparently knocked
unconscious when he banged his head on the ice and was motionless on
his back beside the boards. After a delay of six minutes, he was
removed on a stretcher.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 3, Detroit 2 -- Andreas Dackell, Saku Koivu and Andrei
Markov scored as the Canadiens spoiled the home opener for the
defending Stanley Cup champions.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal goalie Jeff Hackett stopped 30 shots in his first start
in place of Jose Theodore, last season's Hart and Vezina Trophy
winner.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 4, Edmonton 3 -- Vincent Damphousse scored his 400th
career goal, and Vesa Toskala got his first NHL victory as the Sharks
won at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Owen Nolan scored a short-handed goal that broke a tie midway
through the second period, and Teemu Selanne had a goal as the Sharks
rebounded from two season-opening losses.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 4, Florida 1 -- Jocelyn Thibault stopped 15 shots, and
four Blackhawks scored in the victory at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Thibault has given up a league-low three goals in three games this
season. Lyle Odelein, Phil Housley, Kyle Calder and Mark Bell scored
for Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 7, Columbus 1 -- Keith Tkachuk and Eric Boguniecki
scored two goals each as the Blues won at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jackets, who have never won in six games in St. Louis,
lost their third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 2, Carolina 1 -- Peter Bondra and Jaromir Jagr scored
second-period goals, and Olaf Kolzig stopped 37 shots as the Capitals
won at Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, New York Islanders 3 -- Brad Isbister's goal with
2:08 left in the third period lifted the Islanders into a tie at
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo 4, New York Rangers 4 -- Pavel Bure scored his third goal
in two games with 8:51 left and the Rangers earned a tie at Buffalo,
N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Phoenix 3 -- Shayne Corson scored two goals at Toronto
as the Maple Leafs ended a three-game losing streak.</TE>

<LD>George Foreman joked Thursday that he hasn't retired from boxing. The
only reason he sat out the last five years, he said, was to become
eligible for the World Boxing Hall of Fame.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm coming right back," Foreman said. "I've got 10 kids; I'll be
boxing until I'm 100."</LD>
<LD>   Foreman, 54, who won world heavyweight titles 20 years apart, is
part of a class that includes five boxers and three others who work
in the sport. They will be inducted Saturday night at the Crowne
Plaza Hotel and Casino in Commerce.</LD>
<TE>   Inductees joining him on the dais at a luncheon Thursday at the
Crowne Plaza were former flyweight champion Miguel Canto, former
bantamweight and junior-featherweight champion Lupe Pintor, Mike
McCallum, a three-time champion in the junior-middleweight,
middleweight and light-heavyweight divisions; HBO boxing analyst
Larry Merchant and longtime publicist Bill Caplan.</TE>
<TE>   Also being inducted are former welterweight champion Luis
Rodriguez, who died in 1996, and trainer Freddie Roach.</TE>
<TE>   Vernon Forrest, the World Boxing Council and International Boxing
Federation welterweight champion, was introduced as the World Boxing
Hall of Fame fighter of the year. Forrest's trainer, Ronnie Shields,
was named trainer of the year.</TE>

<HD>Fishing Loses Tireless Advocate in Russ Izor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It won't go down as one of his greatest achievements, but it was a
fitting last gesture by a man who wasn't one to hide his feelings.</LD>
<LD>   Russ Izor, in the months before succumbing to cancer, launched a
bumper-sticker campaign in an attempt to effect change in the state
capital in November. The message: "Sportfishermen Unite -- No
Closures; Vote in 2002 for Anybody but Governor Gray Davis."</LD>
<LD>   "He spent $10,000 out of his own pocket to have those stickers
printed up," Bob Fletcher, president of the Sportfishing Assn. of
California, said of Izor, a staunch Democrat. "And he passed them out
at all the shows and meetings, and pretty much anywhere he went to
anyone who wanted one."</LD>
<TE>   They were appreciated by California's saltwater anglers, who are
struggling against environmentalist advocates supporting a series of
proposed marine closures and a state administration they accuse of
catering to environmentalists for purely political reasons.</TE>
<TE>   It should be said, then, that Russell A. Izor got his point
across, regardless of what happens in November. That, too, is
fitting, because with Izor that was usually the case.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The renowned boat builder, captain and fishing-line manufacturer,
died Saturday of pancreatic cancer. He was 79 and he leaves behind a
legacy his family and friends can be proud of.</TE>
<TE>   Based in the San Pedro area, Izor spent 41 years as one of the
Southland's most popular skippers. He was among the first to start
programs involving underprivileged children and introduced thousands
of them to fishing. He gave anglers an innovative and refined product
in Izorline. He helped build artificial reefs and restore kelp beds.
He once led a movement to win tougher restrictions for calico bass, a
species he loved to catch (and release), and one he wanted so dearly
to protect.</TE>
<TE>   But most of all, Izor was simply a friend of the fisherman.</TE>
<TE>   "I considered Russ to be a second father, as did a lot of the
people around the docks," said Terry Randall, owner of Art's Fishing
Tackle in Gardena. "If any of us had a question to be answered, we
went to Russ."</TE>
<TE>   His answers were rarely brief. Izor was one of those people who
cared about everything.</TE>
<TE>   "When we switched from typewriters to word processors, he got one
and went through three or four right away because he was always on it
writing, putting out letters about all of his concerns, whether they
were about mistreatment of people at a factory or about a fishery
issue," Randall said.</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher, a former deputy director with the Department of Fish and
Game, with which Izor feuded frequently over a variety of issues,
called Izor "rough around the edges" and said the two didn't always
see eye to eye.</TE>
<TE>   "But I will always appreciate the passion he had for the ocean and
its resources," Fletcher said. "He spent his whole life trying to
make things better."</TE>
<TE>   Izor's personality was reflected in the names of some of the early
boats he built: the Truth, the Maverick and the Indian. His pride and
joy, however, was his last and grandest endeavor in 1983: the 93-foot
First String, which remains one of the Southland's newest and most
luxurious party boats.</TE>
<TE>   With reluctance, Izor eventually retired as captain and sold the
vessel so he could concentrate on his fishing-line business.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 29 at 1 p.m., though, he will be given one last ride on
the sleek white sportfisher. His family and closest friends will take
his ashes to an area beyond the San Pedro Lighthouse, scatter them at
sea and return to 22nd Street Landing to celebrate his life.</TE>
<TE>   A tribute will be held from 2-4 p.m. at the 22nd Street Grill and
Bar. Izor is survived by his wife, Lura Kuhlman, daughters Lorry,
Kristen and Caryl Anne, and granddaughter Kaitlin.</TE>
<TE>   Showing Their Colors</TE>
<TE>   A special Fish and Game Commission hearing on proposed closures
within the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary is scheduled
Wednesday in Santa Barbara. It is the public's last chance to weigh
in before commission members decide how expansive the closures should
be.</TE>
<TE>   It's a hot issue. So hot that the United Anglers of Southern
California has accused the commission, as it moves closer to decision
time, of "caving in to corporate environmental interests" while
paying no attention to new evidence it says "damages the commission's
case for massive closures."</TE>
<TE>   That evidence will be presented formally Wednesday by sportfishing
leaders, who will be cheered on by perhaps hundreds of fishermen
wearing red shirts, not because they're Angel fans, but as a show of
unity. The meeting, which will also be attended by environmental
advocates, is scheduled for 10 a.m. at the Earl Warren Showgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Thrown to the Sharks</TE>
<TE>   Sportfishing and environmental groups in Mexico, on the same side
in a fight against commercial fishing interests trying to blaze their
way into waters long reserved for sportfishing, are rejoicing over
the withdrawal last week of the now-infamous shark norma.</TE>
<TE>   The decree, scheduled to become effective next month, would have
allowed commercial fishing for sharks inside the 50-mile
sportfishing-only zone and as close as a half-mile from the Mexican
coastline.</TE>
<TE>   "What the withdrawal of the norma represents to fisheries and
tourism is basically hope that overfishing in the southern Sea of
Cortez will slow down," said Rocio Lozano-Knowlton, a dive center
owner in La Paz. "We gained some time for management actions to take
place before it is too late, as it may [already] be for some
species."</TE>
<TE>   The shark norma would have allowed extensive use of long-line gear
and gill-nets, and thus the incidental by-catch of everything from
marlin and mahi-mahi to sea turtles, manta rays and even whales, all
of which are vital to the country's lucrative tourist industry.</TE>
<TE>   Sportfishing and environmental groups are also cheering the firing
this week of Jeronimo Ramos, a top fisheries official who openly
supported the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Casting Call</TE>
<TE>   Sister Carol Anne Corley, a.k.a. the "Tying Nun," is among several
noteworthy personalities scheduled to give presentations at the
International Women Fly Fishers Festival Oct. 31-Nov. 3 at the San
Diego Marriott in La Jolla. ABC news correspondent Judy Muller, an
avid fly angler, is the keynote speaker.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego has proclaimed the preceding day "International Women
Fly Fishers Day" and the festival, which also features area fishing
trips, is expected to attract hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   It is open to members and nonmembers for $225 and $250,
respectively. Those who don't wish to participate can attend the Nov.
2 dinner-auction for $50. Proceeds go to Casting for Recovery, which
works with breast cancer survivors. Details:
www.inltwomenflyfishers.org, or (925) 934-2461.</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   The indefinite closure of the Southland's parched national forests
has been bothersome to many, but none have been inconvenienced as
much as deer hunters holding tags for zones within the closed areas.
Many are outraged, thinking the closures were designed to keep them
out.</TE>
<TE>   Turner's Outdoorsman, one of the top sellers of the U.S. Forest
Service Adventure Pass, which is required for day and overnight use
throughout much of the forest lands, went so far as to accuse the
forest service of discrimination and is no longer carrying the
passes.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe implementing the closure now is discrimination against
the hunting public," Andy McCormick, spokesman for the chain of
sporting goods stores, said in a prepared statement. "Over 7,000
deer-tag users and probably an equal number of quail hunters are
being locked out of forests that are no more dangerous this month
than they were last month."</TE>
<TE>   All of the Angeles, Cleveland, San Bernardino national forests and
a portion of Los Padres are off-limits to all forms of recreation
until further notice.</TE>
<TE>   "The forest is closed to everyone, not just hunters," said Gail
Wright, spokeswoman for the Angeles National Forest. "There is no
recreation, so I don't know how that can be called discrimination."</TE>

<HD>They Can Win Out and Be Left Out</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>That thud you just heard was the bowl championship series door
slamming in the Left (Out) Coast conference's face ... again.</LD>
<LD>   This is the fifth year a rankings system will be used to determine
the national title-game participants and the fifth year the Pacific
10 champion will not (likely) get an invite.</LD>
<LD>   This would be another gut punch for a conference some indexes rate
as the nation's toughest, but welcome to Reality BCS TV.</LD>
<TE>   Oregon is the Pac-10's lone unbeaten team, one of 10 undefeated
teams in Division I-A, but Oregon has a problem.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, with one defeat, the Ducks finished the regular season
No. 2 in both national polls but lost the BCS computer points war,
finishing fourth behind Miami, Nebraska and Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of playing Miami for the national title in the Rose Bowl,
Oregon beat Colorado in the Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to get back to the Fiesta Bowl, which plays host to
this year's BCS national championship.</TE>
<TE>   Without a ton of help, though, we don't see how 12-0 Oregon gets
there.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Oregon was felled by the margin-of-victory component in
the BCS system, a perceived wrong that prompted BCS commissioners to
demand that that component be removed as a condition of remaining in
the system.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Oregon's problem is going to be strength of schedule.</TE>
<TE>   And, the kicker is, this may all be Michigan's fault.</TE>
<TE>   Say what?</TE>
<TE>   Oregon was supposed to play at Michigan on Sept. 21, but the
Wolverines asked to defer the game to 2007 because Michigan was
already playing two tough nonconference teams, Washington and Notre
Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon agreed, and replaced Michigan with a home game against
Portland State, a Division</TE>
<TE>   I-AA team.</TE>
<TE>   A win at Michigan, of course, would have done wonders for Oregon's
national portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, the Ducks are 6-0 without having defeated a team
currently ranked in either the writers' or coaches' poll.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon is in decent shape in three of the four BCS departments.
The Ducks have a No. 6 poll average and a 7.4 average in six of the
seven BCS computer rankings in operation (Peter Wolfe's first
rankings release will coincide with the unveiling of Monday's first
BCS standings).</TE>
<TE>   Oregon has no losses -- each defeat costs a team one point in the
BCS -- but figures to take a hit in the strength-of-schedule
component.</TE>
<TE>   In this week's Sagarin ratings, for example, Oregon ranks No. 81.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's standing will improve as it faces tougher opponents --
Washington, Washington State, USC -- but by how much?</TE>
<TE>   Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti had hoped the Pac-10's stellar
reputation would overcome the nonconference issue, but it may not be
enough.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were to run the table and not get there, yeah, it would be
pretty tough," Bellotti said this week.</TE>
<TE>   Bellotti also cautioned that it's too early to be concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have to see how the whole thing shakes out," he said.
"We're at the halfway point of the season, a lot of things can
happen."</TE>
<TE>   If Oregon continues to win, the school is going to need a lot of
things to happen.</TE>
<TE>   If the Ducks end up as one of three, four or possibly five
unbeaten teams, they are going to get aced out.</TE>
<TE>   To have a realistic Fiesta Bowl shot, Oregon needs at least four
of the five teams ranked ahead of it -- Miami, Oklahoma, Virginia
Tech, Georgia, Ohio State -- to lose, not to mention No. 7 Notre
Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Should Oregon and Notre Dame remain undefeated through the
weekend, the Irish are a cinch to be ranked higher than the Ducks in
Monday's first BCS standings.</TE>
<TE>   The irony is that a 12-0 Oregon, perhaps eliminated from national
title contention for not having played Michigan, would end up in the
Rose Bowl, where it might play ... Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Pac Bits</TE>
<TE>   You wonder how conference coaches keep their defensive
coordinators from sharp objects. Seven Pac-10 schools are averaging
33.4 points a game or better, led by California's league-leading
38.7. What's more, six conference quarterbacks rank among the top 15
nationally in pass efficiency. Yet, many weeks, giving up 30 points
on defense is enough to get you a win, not fired. In the Pac-10, you
have to put everything in context. "I think you have to walk a fine
line," Arizona State Coach Dirk Koetter said. "My defensive coaches,
they don't want to hear that, they don't want to hear me say, 'Hey,
just keep them under 30.' " Arizona State didn't have that problem
last week, giving up three field goals in a 13-9 victory over Oregon
State. That game was an exception, though. "I wouldn't want to be a
secondary coach in our league," Washington State Coach Mike Price
said.</TE>
<TE>   Further proof that defense doesn't necessarily win championships:
Washington State leads the Pac-10 with a 3-0 record and ranks sixth
in total defense and fifth in scoring defense. USC, which will
effectively be eliminated from the conference race if it loses to
Washington on Saturday, continues to lead the Pac-10 in total
defense.</TE>
<TE>   Looking way ahead (but that's what we do): If Ohio State finishes
undefeated and advances to play for the national title in the Fiesta
Bowl, the Rose Bowl does not have to take another Big Ten school to
match against the Pac-10 champion. The Rose Bowl would have the
option of choosing any BCS-qualified team, and would do cartwheels
down Colorado Boulevard if that team was Notre Dame. The Irish last
appeared in Pasadena in 1925, Knute Rockne's Irish defeating Pop
Warner-led Stanford, 27-10.</TE>

<LD>Moose Jaw, Salinas and Parkersburg.</LD>
<LD>   Not exactly Tinker to Evers to Chance, but these being the Angels,
mythology isn't always so neatly packaged.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes, the three most important things in your clubhouse
aren't your best infielders. Sometimes they're your three worst
memories.</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes, a championship race is not only about chasing.
Sometimes it's also about running away.</TE>
<TE>   The splendid desperation seen in the Angels during the last two
weeks didn't spring only from the sight of the New York Yankees and
Minnesota Twins.</TE>
<TE>   It also came from the thought of places like Moose Jaw, Salinas
and Parkersburg.</TE>
<TE>   Three independent league outposts where Angels were dumped after
losing their way.</TE>
<TE>   Three places where they found themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The itinerary for this club's unlikely World Series journey begins
there.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Weber once played for the Salinas Peppers, a team whose owner
was so slow in paying the average $800 monthly salaries, Weber led a
team walkout.</TE>
<TE>   Moments before the start of a game.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle of a pennant race.</TE>
<TE>   "Unbelievable," recalls Weber with a grin. "We walked off the
field and climbed on a bus and drove away."</TE>
<TE>   What did the fans do?</TE>
<TE>   "What fans?" Weber said.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Wooten once played for the Moose Jaw Diamond Dogs, a
Saskatchewan team that was so cheap, it had a total of 15 baseballs.</TE>
<TE>   "You hit a home run during batting practice and one of the workers
had to chase it down and bring it back," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And the bats?</TE>
<TE>   "If you broke one, you taped it up and used it for batting
practice," he recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Brendan Donnelly once played for the Ohio Valley Redcoats, a
Parkersburg, W.Va., team that played in a city park against
neighborhood kids.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember holding the ball on the mound, looking in at some kid
right out of high school, and thinking, 'What am I doing here?' " he
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   What were any of them doing there?</TE>
<TE>   They had failed, that's what.</TE>
<TE>   They had been cut from conventional minor league teams for lack of
talent or promise or hustle.</TE>
<TE>   They had been cut, as David Eckstein and Jose Molina had once been
cut.</TE>
<TE>   They had been ignored, as 33rd-round draft pick Orlando Palmeiro
and 38th-round pick Scot Shields had once been ignored.</TE>
<TE>   The history of these three independent league survivors typifies
the history of the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   So too does their resolve.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I got out of Moose Jaw, I said to myself, 'If I ever get to
put on a major league uniform, nobody is taking it away from me,' "
Wooten said.</TE>
<TE>   Slow-forward from Moose Jaw in 1996 to Edison Field two weeks ago.
Wooten homered, singled twice, scored three times and drove in two
runs in the Angels' clinching 9-5 win over the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Each time he crossed the plate, he had to fight through teammates
to find a seat in the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers Moose Jaw, and a fight of a different sort.</TE>
<TE>   At the Diamond Dogs' ramshackle home field, players had to walk
through the stands to get to the tiny clubhouse. One night, a team
from North Dakota bought tickets after its game in a nearby town had
been rained out.</TE>
<TE>   Coming off the field after a victory, the Diamond Dogs were mugged
by their beer-swigging rivals, starting a brawl that required police
intervention.</TE>
<TE>   "The wildest thing I've ever seen in baseball," Wooten recalled.
"Guys in uniforms and spikes fighting guys in tennis shoes and jeans.
It started to rain. Beer was everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I told myself, 'I'm never going back to a place like that again.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly said the same thing after his summer in Parkersburg,
where he'd signed in July 1994 after having been cut earlier that
summer by the Chicago Cubs' organization.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't thrilled about playing in a West Virginia sandlot, but
his only other option was continuing in his job as a private
investigator, serving subpoenas to those who didn't want them.</TE>
<TE>   He once dressed as a pizza delivery man. Another time, he
pretended he was a florist.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years later, he was striking out John Vander Wal to preserve
a lead in a Game 2 victory over the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "What I always tell people is, 'Keep that uniform on, and maybe
somebody will find you,' " Donnelly said.</TE>
<TE>   When Weber ended his 1996 season in Salinas, nobody could find
him.</TE>
<TE>   That's because he was dressed as the team's green pepper mascot.</TE>
<TE>   He had already been the team's hero earlier that year when the
walkout shamed ownership into paying the players regularly.</TE>
<TE>   Now he was going to celebrate what he thought was going to be his
final year in baseball by running around the field like a red-hot
fool.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the traditional race around the bases between the mascot
and a child picked out of the stands. This time, against all rules,
the mascot won.</TE>
<TE>   "I go sliding across home plate and get up dancing and everyone is
stunned," he said. "Then I look over and see this little girl
crying."</TE>
<TE>   The quick-thinking public address guy immediately announced that
the mascot had missed home plate, and so the girl was the winner.</TE>
<TE>   Weber's teammates then pulled off his mask.</TE>
<TE>   "Most fun I ever had playing baseball," Weber said.</TE>
<TE>   Until, of course, right now, the World Series providing a happy
ending to three fractured fairy tales.</TE>
<TE>   "Before these playoffs, everybody was talking about how we were so
inexperienced," Weber said. "Lemme tell ya, I was experienced. Maybe
not on the right levels. Maybe in some places you wouldn't want to
tell your kids about. But I was experienced."</TE>

<HD>'The Little Fat Kid' Was Early Bloomer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MORTON, Pa.</DL>
<LD>When they were kids living in a development called Stony Creek, a
place of solid brick houses and the smell of garlic and onions and
sausages in the air, Mike Scioscia and his buddies built a small
ballpark.</LD>
<LD>   "It was in somebody's backyard," says Fred Scioscia, Mike's older
brother, "and it had bleachers and a scoreboard and everything. It
was something else, what these guys built. They called it Decimal
Park. They named it after somebody's dog, of all things. It was a
piece of work, but that's just how it was for us growing up.
Everybody knew everybody else, we were mostly Italian Catholics and
we loved our ball. Sports of all kinds."</LD>
<LD>   It was here, west of Philadelphia, in Delaware County -- Delco to
the natives -- where Mike Scioscia became a baseball player and where
the foundation was laid for his move into managing. It was where he
made the decision that being calm was better than being emotional,
that being quiet worked better than being loud. He learned to be sure
of himself but not cocky, proud of his accomplishments but not
boastful. And this wasn't always easy.</LD>
<TE>   "From the time he was about 14 years old," Mike's uncle, Lou
Scioscia, says, "what you always heard around here was that the
scouts were coming to see the little fat kid from Delco. That's what
they always said. 'Gotta go see the fat kid in Delco.' "</TE>
<TE>   That would be Mike Scioscia, the fat kid with the big bat and the
big body to block the plate. Mike, the football guard and basketball
forward.</TE>
<TE>   Mike, who hit .532 as a high school sophomore, and was made a
starter by his coach, Ace Bell, after the starting catcher was
slightly hurt in the first game of the 1972 season.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew Mike should be starting," Bell says. "But I didn't have
the heart to pull the other kid. Then, lo and behold, the kid gets
hurt, blocking the plate, right off the bat. Mike comes in and, boom,
hits three straight line drives, lasers, right over the second
baseman. The other kid says, 'I'm not getting back at catch, right?'
At least he understood. He learned to play third base for us."</TE>
<TE>   In a display case at Springfield High in Delco (there also is a
Springfield High in Montgomery County, or Montco, and one must always
differentiate) there is a framed picture of Scioscia in his Dodger
uniform next to a picture of Bell, who taught and coached at
Springfield.</TE>
<TE>   It was no accident that Mike became a baseball player.</TE>
<TE>   Fred and Florence Scioscia had three children. Fred, 58, was the
oldest, an athlete of modest talent who took more to football than
baseball; Gail, 47, who put up with all the high jinks of her
brothers and their friends, and Mike, 43, the baby.</TE>
<TE>   Mike was born on Thanksgiving Day in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   Aunt Jane remembers Mike as a big baby. Uncle Lou, brother of
Mike's dad, remembers Fred saying, "That's my $100,000 bonus baby."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Scioscia had been a baseball player himself, a pitcher on a
semipro team across the state in Johnstown. Lou Scioscia was a
football player at Duke. There were athletic genes in the Scioscia
family and Mike got those genes. He also got the eating genes.</TE>
<TE>   Florence was always cooking big pots of pasta and sausages, always
too much, and Mike was always there to eat, Aunt Jane remembers.
Scioscia was always roly-poly, Uncle Lou says.</TE>
<TE>   Mike's brother says Mike showed talent early.</TE>
<TE>   When Scioscia was 2, he picked up a bat and a Wiffle ball in the
backyard and started blasting hits, spraying them all over the yard.
His brother says that their father put some pressure on Mike.</TE>
<TE>   "Pop wanted him to be a good athlete, no question," Fred says. "So
Pop pushed Mike some. Not in a bad way I don't think, but he pushed
Mike."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia's dad was a salesman for a beer distributorship and his
mom was a grade school teacher. When the family moved from South
Philadelphia, where young Fred was born, to Morton, a growing suburb
in a more upscale neighborhood, they were not alone</TE>
<TE>   "Let's see," says Fred, "there were six houses of relatives in a
two-block area. One street over from us was my grandfather and
grandmother on my mom's side and their second daughter and her
husband. Next door to them was my grandmother's brother and his wife
and kids and then in the next house, my mom's brother and his wife
and daughter and his wife's parents were down the street and so was
mom's younger sister and husband and five kids and around the corner
another block away was my mom's cousin and his wife and daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all involved, civically and with the church. Our dad was
president of the civic association. We'd do food drives for charity.
We'd all go caroling at Christmas. And Fourth of July, oh boy. Apple
pie-eating contests. Watermelon-eating contests, parades, the whole
thing.</TE>
<TE>   "And sports, all the time sports. Organized sports, disorganized
sports, pickup baseball, pickup basketball. My sister says Mike was
always breaking in a new glove. He was always rubbing a glove with
neat's-foot oil."</TE>
<TE>   As a boy, Scioscia was always the best in his age group, Fred
says. In basketball and football too.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody remembers Mike's father as being forceful and, as Bell
says, boisterous. Mike's brother also remembers that their father
"got real high and real low and I think Mike made a conscious
decision at a young age that he was going to be different than my dad
in that behavior. The way Mike is now, so calm all the time, I don't
think that's an accident," Fred says.</TE>
<TE>   From the first day Ace Bell saw Scioscia on the Springfield High
baseball field, he knew he had something special.</TE>
<TE>   "At that first workout," Bell says, "I put my arm around Fred's
shoulders and said, 'Fred, you have a No. 1 draft pick here.' And
Fred said, 'Honestly?' I said, 'Honestly.' The kid had the greatest
arm I had seen and he could hit. Boy, could he hit. Mike was never
going to be the fastest thing going, but it wasn't going to matter."</TE>
<TE>   By the time Mike was a senior at Springfield High, Bell remembers
as many as 18 scouts at every game. They started coming when Mike was
a sophomore and the Springfield Cougars were playing Radnor.</TE>
<TE>   "A Baltimore Orioles scout I knew was at the game," Bell says. "I
asked him who he was looking at and he said the Radnor pitcher. I
told him to keep an eye on Mike.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, this pitcher threw 90 miles per hour and Mike just hit the
heck out of him, line drive after line drive. After that game, the
scout came up and told me he wasn't going to miss another game Mike
played. And he didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia and Bell were perfect for each other. Bell had played
some minor league ball, including a year in Trenton, N.J., for a
Giants' farm team with Willie Mays.</TE>
<TE>   It was that association with Mays that made most of the kids pay
attention to Bell. But Scioscia didn't need that hook. Scioscia just
listened and learned because that's how he was taught -- to listen
and learn. Just what he expects players to do now -- listen and
learn.</TE>
<TE>   Bell taught Scioscia about the nuances, about the art of calling
pitches, of how to handle pitchers, about when to throw what and
where. Bell took Mike to tryout camps with the Yankees and Phillies,
to instructional camps where Tom Lasorda, who had grown up in nearby
Norristown, would speak. Scioscia showed Bell a deep love of baseball
and a humbleness about his talent.</TE>
<TE>   "I coached enough big-shot athletes," Bell says. "I know how they
behave. I know how they could get big heads. That was never Mike.
Mike was always just Mike."</TE>
<TE>   Clemson offered Scioscia a four-year baseball scholarship.
Florence Scioscia, the teacher, secretly hoped Mike would go to
college, but when he was chosen in the first round, the 19th pick, by
the Dodgers, there was never any doubt. Scioscia was going to be a
major league catcher.</TE>
<TE>   Fred and Florence are gone now. Florence died of breast cancer in
1982 and Fred of a stroke 10 years later. Mike's brother moved to
Illinois more than a decade ago. Gail moved to Illinois to attend
graduate school and stay with Fred and she too lives in Normal.</TE>
<TE>   But there are plenty of uncles and aunts and cousins around
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Scioscia, son of Lou and Jane, same age as Mike and his
partner in so many family sporting contests, is flying to Orange
County tonight. Craig, a baseball coach at Bucks County Community
College, once lived with Scioscia when he was a young Dodger.</TE>
<TE>   He was around when Scioscia met his wife, Anne. As Aunt Jane tells
it, Anne waited for Mike after a Dodger game with an offering of
chocolate chip cookies. Mike followed Anne, and the cookies, to
Anne's car.</TE>
<TE>   Bell tells of the scholarship Mike funds at Springfield High in
his mother's name. It is an academic scholarship to honor the woman
who was a lifelong educator.</TE>
<TE>   Aunt Jane laughs as she says that when Craig and Mike speak on the
phone, they compare weights. "Craig is up to about 260 I think," Jane
says. "Mike's right there with him."</TE>
<TE>   At Springfield High, Bell smiles proudly and blushes a little when
employees walk past and yell, "Telling stories about how you made
Mike a star?" At home in Gloria Dei Manor, Aunt Jane and Uncle Lou
say they cried when the Angels clinched the American League pennant
Sunday, just as his dad cried when Scioscia helped the Dodgers win
the World Series in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   About a year before Scioscia's Dodger playing days were over, Bell
asked him what he planned to do with the rest of his life. Something
not involved in baseball, Scioscia told his old coach. But Bell
suspected that wouldn't stick.</TE>
<TE>   When you have held a bat and hit a ball since you were 2, when you
built a baseball field in the yard, when the scouts searched you out,
the fat boy in Delco, because you played the game well and the right
way, you don't walk away. Ever.</TE>

<HD>A Beaten Path?</HD>
<DH>Revolution's march to MLS title game mirrors the Galaxy's
run of 1999</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The story goes something like this: Team struggles out of the gate,
coach gets run out of town, team responds, qualifies for a playoff
spot and makes an improbable run to Major League Soccer's
championship game under the new taskmaster, who is named the league's
coach of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Sound familiar?</LD>
<LD>   Sure, the Galaxy wrote that script three years ago, when Sigi
Schmid replaced Octavio Zambrano early in the 1999 season and steered
the Galaxy to the MLS Cup title match.</LD>
<TE>   But now New England has also followed the story line. The
Revolution, under interim coach Steve Nicol, staged one of the most
remarkable in-season turnarounds in league history and will meet its
role model Sunday at Gillette Stadium for the championship.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some similarities there, in terms of Stevie taking over
during the season and then being named coach of the year," Schmid
said of Nicol, who was feted by MLS on Wednesday. "If [the
similarities] carry all the way through, that will be great."</TE>
<TE>   Meaning the Revolution should lose the title game, just as the
Galaxy did MLS Cup '99?</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, if there's going to be similarities, then let's take it all
the way," Schmid said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   After all, a Revolution defeat this year would mean that the
perpetually runner-up Galaxy, which is 0-3 in league championship
matches, would finally have its title and could quiet talk that it is
MLS' equivalent of the Buffalo Bills and Minnesota Vikings.</TE>
<TE>   "The past is the past," Schmid said. "All we can do is alter the
future."</TE>
<TE>   The Revolution, meanwhile, changed its fortunes when it fired
third-year coach Fernando Clavijo on May 23 and replaced him with
Nicol, a first-year assistant.</TE>
<TE>   New England, which was foundering at 2-4-1 when Clavijo was shown
the door, responded immediately.</TE>
<TE>   A day after Nicol took over, the Revolution was involved in the
largest trade in MLS history, a six-player swap with the New York/New
Jersey MetroStars that rid the Revolution of Ted Chronopoulos,
Mamadou Diallo and Andy Williams, and landed it Daniel Hernandez,
Brian Kamler and Diego Serna.</TE>
<TE>   The next night, New England won Nicol's first game as Revolution
coach, beating the Galaxy, 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   The afterglow didn't last long, though, as New England stumbled,
dropping three consecutive games and five of its next six.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Revolution was in last place, seven points removed
from the the final playoff spot, 12 points out of first place, at
7-14-1 after a 2-0 loss to Chicago on Aug. 18.</TE>
<TE>   Then New England, which already had the league's leading scorer in
forward Taylor Twellman (52 points), turned to its defense.</TE>
<TE>   A strong finish, during which the Revolution surrendered only
three goals in its final six games, helped it go 5-0-1 to close the
regular season. The run enabled New England, which finished with
league highs in goals scored, 49, and goals given up, 49, to sneak
past its division rivals and win the Eastern Conference championship
and accompanying No. 2 seeding for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Including its 3-1-2 record in the playoffs, with series victories
over seventh-seeded Chicago and sixth-seeded Columbus, the Revolution
is 8-1-3 in its last 12 games and has not lost at home since the Aug.
18 shutout.</TE>
<TE>   And in six playoff games, the Revolution has yielded four goals
and is trying to duplicate the feats of San Jose and Kansas City,
teams that not only appeared in the MLS Cup title match the last two
seasons a year after missing the playoffs but won it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if 'challenge' is the right word for us playing the
Galaxy because we're enjoying this and we're not content to just be
in the final," said Nicol, who is actually in his second tour of duty
with the Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the former Scottish national team player was
brought aboard to serve as the Revolution's interim coach for the
team's final two games. He won both, but New England bypassed him for
Clavijo, and Nicol left the organization, returning last winter.</TE>
<TE>   The irony is not lost on Nicol, who still wears the interim tag
and has the rare opportunity to give New England owner Robert Kraft
championships in MLS and the NFL. Kraft also owns the Super Bowl
champion Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a completely different situation now than it was three years
ago," said Nicol, 40, who spent the last three years cutting his
coaching teeth as player-coach of the Boston Bulldogs of the Koming
League. "I wasn't ready then; I had only been in the country six
months. Now this is a good opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "We've become a team that started playing for each other, rather
than for themselves, because they started buying into [the team
philosophy]. We went from a team that didn't know how to win to a
team that doesn't know how to lose."</TE>

<LD>Fifty years ago, a man rose three hours before sunrise and drove
alone in his work truck along a two-lane road lined densely by orange
trees.</LD>
<LD>   En route to another job site in Orange County, home plasterer
Robert Bonds Sr. devoted time during the journey from his Riverside
home to the thoughts that inspire most good family men. He wanted his
children to have a strong work ethic, be well educated, avoid
discrimination and establish a successful life that could only be
improved upon by their children.</LD>
<LD>   "My father used to say, 'If God wanted you to go backward, he'd
have turned your feet around,' " said Rosie Bonds, one of Robert
Sr.'s four children.</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday, Elizabeth Bonds, the feisty, 88-year-old widow of
Robert Sr., will retrace her husband's old early-morning work route
when she is driven on the 91 freeway toward Anaheim, where she will
watch her famous grandson, Barry, play in his first World Series
game. Upon his introduction at Edison Field, Barry Bonds, wearing a
cross earring that stands as a symbol of his love for his deceased
grandfather, will greet another man whose Riverside roots are
unmistakable: San Francisco Giant Manager Dusty Baker.</TE>
<TE>   "This is indescribable to me," said Dusty's father, Johnnie Baker
Sr., who now lives in the Northern California town of Carmichael.
"I've been throughout the world, and I'm convinced the only place my
son could have accomplished something like this -- this journey from
the pits of despair to the very top -- is America."</TE>
<TE>   To hear the Bondses and Bakers tell it, Riverside, circa 1950-65,
was one of the few American cities that could so wildly encourage
families to chase such brilliant futures.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish everyone could know what Riverside was like back in the
day," Rosie Bonds said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Bonds Sr. arrived in Riverside from Texas in 1934. His
educational background was minimal, Rosie Bonds said, placing it at a
sixth-grade level. But his enthusiasm for work, family, religion and
community was infectious.</TE>
<TE>   "He coached us all about the importance of commitment," Rosie
said. "One of the things he was most committed about was getting his
contractor's license. We waited outside by the mailbox for days
before it finally came. I was only about 6, but I still remember what
he said when he finally got it: 'We're going to go places now.' "</TE>
<TE>   Johnnie Baker Sr. settled in Riverside in 1945 after Naval duty in
the Pacific as a gunner's mate. Working as a governmental sheet metal
technician at Norton Air Force Base, he and wife Christina had their
first child on June 15, 1949. Three years later, Johnnie Jr. earned a
new first name: "Dusty."</TE>
<TE>   "He wouldn't play in anything but dirt, and we had a big backyard
with fruit trees, a garden with vegetables, flowers and shrubs,"
Baker Sr. said. "He'd take off for that dirt like he was running a
race. There were a lot of baths, a lot of changes of clothes. So I
called him Dusty, and his mother started calling him it too."</TE>
<TE>   The Bakers' neighborhood was diverse -- black, white, Latino,
Asian -- as was Dusty's elementary school, Lowell.</TE>
<TE>   "Dusty was never intimidated by anyone racially as an adult
because he never had a reason to feel inferior in talking to and
playing with kids of all races," said Stan Davis, a longtime friend
of Baker's who lives in Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   "In those days, your neighborhood was your family," said Robert
Baker, the Bakers' second child. "We were raised in modest means, on
the poor side of town, but because of that we learned to do more with
less, to appreciate what we had, to understand the importance of
loyalty to your community. That has been real important in Dusty's
success in dealing with the diversity in the pros."</TE>
<TE>   So were his dad's obvious, subtle and hidden lessons. Robert Baker
remembered, "Dad never let us be half good at anything," and that
included the occasional assignments he gave them while running a
custodial service.</TE>
<TE>   Baker Sr. coached Dusty during most of his youth baseball days.
"Dusty was mischievous and active, you had to be stern with him,"
said Baker Sr., who once benched his 11-year-old son for a Little
League all-star game for being rebellious. "My philosophy was once
you decided to do something, you have to completely finish the job.
He said he wanted to play baseball, so I hit him hundreds of balls.
By the time he was 12, he was a very good player."</TE>
<TE>   By the time Dusty was 12, the emerging civil rights movement had
touched Riverside. Baker Sr. confronted Dusty's Central Junior High
principal for a policy that allowed black children to be dismissed
early from school so they could serve as caddies at Victoria golf
course, which was behind the Bakers' backyard wall.</TE>
<TE>   "That was strictly racist," Baker Sr. said. "I went right in there
and said, 'My boy is not going to be a caddie.' That was an exclusive
course, they limited [access to] blacks and Mexicans, and the school
was allowing these kids to miss school to help this course out. I
wanted to fight any policy I thought was intended to make my son a
mediocre person the rest of his life."</TE>
<TE>   Baker Sr. said he joined and helped lead other movements in the
city. The family adhered to Martin Luther King Jr. and John F.
Kennedy's nonviolent approach, with the children told to avoid
walking near a neighborhood mosque that embraced the teachings of
Malcolm X. Baker Sr. pushed for progress, bothered that blacks were
forced to the balcony for movies at the city's only theater and that
service was either denied or delayed at cafes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure Dusty knew I was in a movement, and I know he had to
battle his way through some of his own things, but I think we made
out all right," Baker Sr. said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Robert Baker: "Dusty was given books by my parents. I was
given music, African and jazz. No one in our family had ever
graduated from college, and that motivated Dusty and I. Our parents
raised us with a consciousness."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Baker family had become linked to the Bonds family.
Christina Baker asked her good friend Elizabeth Bonds to baby-sit for
her frequently, and Dusty deeply admired the athletic prowess of
three-years-older Bobby Bonds, a football, baseball and track star at
Riverside Poly High.</TE>
<TE>   "Bobby was Riverside's mega-god," Robert Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby went on to play in the major leagues. His older brother,
Robert Bonds Jr., played football at San Jose State. Rosie was an
80-meter hurdles finalist in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "Mama has always said it was because of her cooking," Rosie said.
"Nothing made her happier than to see a child happy and nourished."</TE>
<TE>   What made growing up in Riverside special, Rosie said, was that so
many other parents shared similar passionate concerns for their
children's welfare.</TE>
<TE>   "It was extraordinary -- it seemed like there was no crime, I know
no one locked their doors," Rosie said. "You couldn't say a bad word
on the street without three women stopping you to say, 'Excuse me?'
The boys played baseball at places like Patterson Park just for the
hot dogs they got for free after the game. Bands played wonderful
music at Lincoln Park."</TE>
<TE>   The Bonds' home was an extension of the atmosphere. Mama Bonds
hosted entire football teams, including coaches and cheerleaders, for
feasts of soul food, Mexican plates, Italian meals or whatever else
she decided to whip up. Occasionally, Rosie and her siblings shared
their bedrooms with children from broken or financially imperiled
homes. Then, into the warmness came a child on July 24, 1964: Barry
Bonds, the first son of Bobby and his wife, Pat. Bobby put a baseball
bat in his son's hands and took a picture.</TE>
<TE>   Barry would soon leave Riverside for a life on the baseball road.
Rosie Bonds recalled a time when she asked 3-year-old Barry what he
planned to do when he became his father's age. He answered, "I want
to be a superstar baseball player."</TE>
<TE>   Bobby was elevated from the minor leagues to San Francisco in
1968. He spent 14 seasons in the majors, hitting 332 homers, stealing
461 bases and winning three Gold Gloves.</TE>
<TE>   The Bakers moved to Northern California in 1965. Johnnie Sr.
landed a promotion in Carmichael. Robert Baker said as he walked to
school for the first time there -- the Bakers were told they were the
first black students at Del Campo High -- a white student drove by
and yelled a racial epithet.</TE>
<TE>   "Sports got us through there," Robert Baker said. "It made us
acceptable, like us or not."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the brothers concluded they left Riverside at an ideal
time.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of folks we were raised with didn't make it out in what
became the era of drugs, of war, of depression," Robert Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   One Riverside landmark close to the hearts of the Bakers and Bonds
remains depressed. The baseball diamond at Patterson Park, where
Dusty and Bobby and major leaguer Tom Hall played, has been
essentially deserted since 1995, when the shooting of a youth league
coach came a year after a man was shot and killed less than 40 yards
beyond the left-field fence.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 24, Dusty and Bobby are scheduled to attend a
revitalization ceremony for the park. "The gangs took it over," said
Leon Culpepper, a friend of the Bonds and Bakers. "The Rotary Club,
the city and the schools want to take it back."</TE>
<TE>   Not far from Patterson Park is the former site of University
Junior High, where Bobby went to school. It's now known as Bobby
Bonds Sports Complex and includes baseball and soccer fields, a
basketball venue and an Olympic-sized pool.</TE>
<TE>   Each afternoon, when Mama Bonds musters enough energy to rise from
the hospital bed in her bedroom, she has her full-time nurse wheel
her past Robert Sr.'s tattered, blue, foam-seated chair on the porch,
up the street to her son's sports complex. Children shout hellos and
ask Mama how she's doing. It's like old times again. Mama tells the
children to live right and say prayers, because that's what her
children did.</TE>
<TE>   Said Rosie: "We were always in the parks, the schools, the
churches. Never the streets."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bonds' and Baker's World Series involvement in Southern
California has provided family members a chance to relish their
perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Baker stood before the media throng Thursday, talking like his
father when someone asked him about his drive to avoid the
satisfaction of just participating in a World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to win," Baker said. "I've beaten my daughter in games we
play together, and she asks me, 'Why don't you let me win?' I tell
her, 'They don't let you win in life.' "</TE>
<TE>   Robert Baker, now a Diamond Bar-based insurance executive, said,
"Many people today might not know everything about the times we came
through. When Dusty and I were born, our birth certificates read
'colored.' We've said to each other, 'Not bad for two colored boys.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Rosie Bonds said she only wishes her father could watch the World
Series. He died of a stroke in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   "My father told his family it was good to be proud," she said. "We
know where we came from and we know where we went. Barry has taken
what we did and carried it on. I'm sure the next generation of Bonds
will continue from there.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad would be proud about how well we have used this life that God
gave us."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Galaxy forward Carlos Ruiz won Major League Soccer's goal-of-the-year
award for a game-winning volley on July 27 against the Columbus Crew.</LD>
<LD>   Ruiz, who led the league with 24 goals in his first season in MLS,
collected a cross from the far side by Alejandro Moreno and blasted a
right-footed shot from the corner of the six-yard box just inside the
left post to beat goalkeeper Jon Busch and give the Galaxy a 2-1
victory.</LD>
<LD>   Ruiz received 36% of the 9,175 votes cast online over the past
week at www.mlsnet.com.</LD>
<TE>   San Jose Earthquake midfielder Ronnie Ekelund was second at 24%

<HD>England's Goalkeeper on Hot Seat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newspapers in England Thursday called for the ouster of national team
goalkeeper David Seaman after another weak display by the 39-year-old
Arsenal player in Wednesday's 2-2 tie with Macedonia.</LD>
<LD>   "The time has come to recognize that Seaman's vulnerability to
long-range shots is a serious problem," the Guardian said in an
editorial calling for Seaman's removal. "This year, the slow drip of
spectacular errors has become a deluge."</LD>
<LD>   Said the Daily Mirror, which also called for his replacement, "His
legs are leaden, his movement hesitant, his positioning suddenly
unsure."</LD>
<TE>   England's Coach Sven Goran Eriksson, however, reiterated his
support for Seaman, who has played 75 times for his country.</TE>
<TE>   Portugal Coachless</TE>
<TE>   Agostinho Oliveria stepped down as caretaker coach of Portugal,
amid speculation that the Portuguese soccer federation would appoint
Fernando Santos as the new coach.</TE>
<TE>   Santos, formerly coach of FC Porto, quit Thursday as coach of
Panathinaikos in the Greek league, with newspapers in Portugal
predicting that he could take charge in the country that will host
the European Championship in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Capurro Plays On</TE>
<TE>   Costa Rica and Ecuador played to a 1-1 tie in a friendly
international in San Jose, Costa Rica, Wednesday night, but the
result was not the real news.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Capurro, a 41-year-old defender, was sent into the game by
Ecuador 11 minutes from the end to earn his 98th cap for the South
American team. Capurro made his national team debut against East
Germany in 1985, and Ecuador's soccer federation has promised him
that he will be permitted to reach the coveted 100 mark.</TE>
<TE>   Costa Rica, playing under interim coach Rodrigo Kenton while
awaiting the arrival of the recently appointed Steve Sampson, took
the lead on a left-footed shot by midfielder Steven Bryce in the 53rd
minute. Ecuador tied it 30 minutes later when Carlos Tenorio scored.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese on Tour</TE>
<TE>   Japan announced that it would play two games in South America in
March, one of them possibly against world champion Brazil. Also on
new Coach Zico's planned schedule are the four-nation Kirin Cup in
Japan and the eight-nation FIFA Confederations Cup in France.</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Miller Makes Fast Impression</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andre Miller made a lasting impression on the Clippers on the opening
day of training camp earlier this month. His was the only Honda Civic
in the players' lot at the College of the Desert.</LD>
<LD>   "That's what he's all about," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said with
a chuckle the other day, recalling Miller's economy car next to a
fleet of high-priced sedans and enormous SUVs. "He doesn't care. He's
a 'shot and a beer' kind of guy. What you see is what you get. Just
don't underestimate his competitiveness."</LD>
<LD>   For all those reasons, and a few more, the Clippers are pleased to
have Miller as their point guard this season. That mix of small ego
and large desire to excel and help his team win could be just what
the Clippers need to hold them together, keeping them pointed in the
right direction.</LD>
<TE>   Injuries and contract concerns have threatened to overshadow the
Clippers' great promise this season, splintering a young and
inexperienced team before it has a chance to play even one
regular-season game. Miller, acquired in a trade with the Cleveland
Cavaliers last summer, hasn't let it happen.</TE>
<TE>   "He seems to have an impact on the team," Gentry said. "Regardless
of the situation, he seems to say, 'Everything is OK.' He missed some
shots the other night [in an exhibition at Portland]. After the game,
it was as if he was saying, 'Don't worry. When the time comes, the
shots are going to go in.' "</TE>
<TE>   Gentry has resisted the temptation to play Miller more during the
Clippers' first five exhibitions, taking a good look at backup Marko
Jaric. With Miller and Jaric, the Clippers could be deeper at the
point than at any time in their history.</TE>
<TE>   "Seeing Andre out there, once we put it all together, it's going
to be quite a year," power forward Elton Brand said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers are expected to introduce Wang Zhizhi to reporters
today at Staples Center. The Dallas Mavericks declined to match the
Clippers' three-year offer sheet worth $6 million and Wang is set to
begin workouts with his new teammates when they return from a
three-game exhibition trip Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   With center Michael Olowokandi injured and his status in doubt for
the season-opening game Oct. 30 against the Cavaliers, Wang could be
the Clippers' starter.</TE>

<HD>Demand for Tickets Is Soaring</HD>
<DH>Relatively small seating capacity of stadiums makes the
search even harder. Some agencies charging more than $5,000 for a
ticket.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The big black-and-orange-clad crowd of San Francisco Giant fans
seeking World Series tickets Wednesday at Pacific Bell Park pleased
Russ Stanley, the club's vice president of ticketing.</LD>
<LD>   "The only problem," Stanley said minutes after the Giants made
tickets available to the public, "is that we really can't meet this
kind of demand."</LD>
<LD>   That's great news for ticket brokers -- and bad news for fans
hoping to find tickets at a reasonable price.</LD>
<TE>   Tickets for the Giant-Angel World Series are among the most
coveted in the event's history, baseball officials and brokers said,
with some agencies charging more than $5,000 for seats listed from
$110 to $175. They've found an eager market, capitalizing on
excitement about the all-California matchup and relatively low ticket
availability in San Francisco and Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   The buzz thrills baseball, but it causes concern too. Major League
Baseball is increasing efforts to protect fans from being duped by
ticket scalpers. Police in Anaheim and San Francisco are on alert and
expect to be busy.</TE>
<TE>   There aren't enough World Series tickets for everyone who wants
them, driving up prices and stirring action off the field.</TE>
<TE>   "We realize we're dealing with a unique situation," said Pat
Courtney, a spokesman for the commissioner's office. "The Angels have
never been in the World Series and the Giants haven't gone for such a
long time [1989].</TE>
<TE>   "Also, the size of the venues, with both of the ballparks seating
in the 40,000-plus range, and the excitement surrounding both of the
teams has a lot to do with what you're seeing with the tickets. We're
anticipating a very coveted ticket."</TE>
<TE>   How hot are tickets?</TE>
<TE>   Brokers in Los Angeles and Orange County said their phones began
ringing Sunday minutes after the Angels clinched the American League
championship with a 13-5 victory over the Minnesota Twins at Edison
Field. As of Thursday night, brokers were quoting prices of $440 to
$4,500 for the first two games in Anaheim and $600 to $5,000 for the
middle games in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Many brokers declined to be interviewed, saying they were fearful
of media criticism because of ticket prices. Two major Los
Angeles-based brokers spoke on the condition they would not be
identified by name.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say this is the hottest ticket since the Subway Series,"
said a longtime broker, referring to the 2000 World Series between
the New York Yankees and New York Mets. "That was the best; you could
get $7,500 for the first few rows at Yankee Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't quite as big, but it's good because there's such a
phenomenon with the Angels right now. Everyone is on the bandwagon.
They're excited. There's so much energy in the ballpark and they
haven't been there before. That's why there's so much demand. People
just want to be there."</TE>
<TE>   The commissioner's office doesn't make it easy on fans,
controlling about 11,000 World Series tickets for each game,
distributing them to corporate partners, the 28 other teams, players
and media members. Season-ticket holders of participating teams get
the next crack, sometimes through a lottery system, leaving the
public to fight for what's left.</TE>
<TE>   "You would like to get as many tickets as possible out to the
general public," Courtney said, "but you have to be fair to the
season-ticker holders because they're the ones who support the sport.
It's tough."</TE>
<TE>   Edison Field seats 45,030 and the Angels have a season-ticket base
of 13,000, excluding partial season packages. After the league office
took its cut, season-ticket holders bought postseason tickets in
August and the Angels fulfilled various commitments, the club had
about "9,000 to 10,000 tickets for sale for each game," said Kevin
Uhlich, senior vice president of business operations.</TE>
<TE>   Ticket brokers were ready to fill the void.</TE>
<TE>   "Ticket prices are always based on supply and demand and there's a
smaller supply this year because of the stadiums," said a broker with
several offices in Los Angeles. "There's always going to be a few
guys asking for a little more or a little less, but you can probably
get tickets for [Game 1 on Saturday] for between $350 to $2,500.
That's the solid market right now."</TE>
<TE>   Buying from ticket scalpers on the day of games can be a less
expensive, though riskier, alternative. Scalpers, trying to move
tickets moments before games begin, generally seek lower prices than
brokers, but the buyer should beware, said Kevin Hallinan, baseball's
executive director of security.</TE>
<TE>   "Counterfeiting is something we're always concerned about," he
said. "We're working very closely with law enforcement officials and
the company that produces our tickets to make sure that we indeed
have safeguards in there that are going to prevent counterfeiting of
the World Series tickets."</TE>
<TE>   The commissioner's office plans to have machines outside Edison
Field and Pacific Bell Park to authenticate tickets.</TE>
<TE>   "So if a fan is in indeed contemplating buying tickets, he might
suggest to the person he's buying them from, 'Hey, I'll see you at
that ballpark and we'll run the tickets through the machine to make
sure that they're good,' " Hallinan said. "You just insert the
tickets and get a red or green light. It's really that simple.
Hopefully it will help because we know that [scalping] does happen."</TE>
<TE>   Reselling tickets on stadium property is a misdemeanor in
California, carrying a maximum punishment of up to six months in
prison and a $1,000 fine. An Anaheim municipal code prohibiting
solicitation in streets also carries a fine of $250.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's just say if you have tickets and you want to sell them,
you'd better do it on a public sidewalk somewhere off the property,"
Anaheim Police Sgt. Rick Martinez said. "It's a law our department
does enforce regularly, and especially with the World Series we are
going to be out there."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This World Series is special to producer Michael Weisman. It will be
his 20th for national television. He was the coordinating producer or
executive producer for 15 at NBC, and this will be his fifth for Fox.</LD>
<LD>   And it was 30 years ago that Weisman worked his first World Series
-- as a production assistant.</LD>
<LD>   Weisman was originally hired as a page by NBC in 1971. His father,
Ed, who died in 1969, was a popular and respected publicist for NBC
Sports.</LD>
<TE>   Weisman moved up from page to production assistant within a year
and was the coordinating producer of NBC's baseball coverage by 1979.
He was named the executive producer of NBC Sports in 1983, the year
Vin Scully joined the network from CBS to become the lead baseball
announcer.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, Weisman, then 33, was Scully's boss. But he doesn't
look at it that way.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just an honor to work with Vin Scully, recognized as one
of the greatest baseball announcers of all time," Weisman said. "The
great thing about Vin, besides his expertise on the air, which
everyone could see, and his mastery of the language and his knowledge
of baseball, was that he was always the consummate gentleman."</TE>
<TE>   Weisman, a former New Yorker who now lives in Brentwood, learned
about baseball production from the master, legendary director Harry
Coyle. Weisman now enjoys that kind of stature as a producer.</TE>
<TE>   The 1988 World Series was the last Weisman worked with Scully at
NBC. And that was the year the Dodgers' Kirk Gibson hit his dramatic
home run in Game 1 against the Oakland A's.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone remembers Gibson's home run," Weisman said. "But what
made that home run so dramatic was the way Vin set it up during the
three-hour telecast. He knew just how important it was that Gibson
wasn't playing because of an injury, and he kept mentioning it. He
kept talking about the challenge facing the Dodgers."</TE>
<TE>   Weisman remembers Scully reminding the crew in the production
truck that Gibson might be able to pinch-hit.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of Vin, several times we panned the bench looking for
Gibson, which heightened the drama," Weisman said. "A stage manager
told us Gibson was loosening up in the clubhouse. So we were ready.
And then Vin tells the audience, 'And here comes Gibson.'</TE>
<TE>   "It was Vin's sense of the dramatic that made that moment, that
home run, so special. I don't know another announcer who could have
set the scene so dramatically."</TE>
<TE>   Weisman, who has also worked World Series with such play-by-play
legends as Curt Gowdy, Joe Garagiola, Bob Costas and Dick Enberg, is
now teamed with Joe Buck.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thrilled to be working with Joe," he said. "He's the next
great baseball announcer."</TE>
<TE>   But Weisman says Buck and Scully are different.</TE>
<TE>   "As a producer, you do things differently, depending on the
strengths of the announcer. With Vin, we could show him a shot of a
sunset or a young fan in the stands and Vin would say something
lyrical and wonderful.</TE>
<TE>   "With Joe, it's fun to take advantage of his off-beat sense of
humor and his pop-culture references.</TE>
<TE>   "What Vin and Joe have in common is their tremendous knowledge of
the game and their respect of the game."</TE>
<TE>   As the producer, Weisman oversees everything that has to do with
the telecasts. The director selects the shots that go out over the
air.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the viewer's advocate," Weisman says of his role. "I always
think of the viewer first -- what he or she wants to see or hear, or
doesn't want to see or hear. If I think a replay is inconclusive,
I'll ask for another. If I think we're showing too many shots from
the stands or too many shots of the rally monkey, I'll let Webbie
know."</TE>
<TE>   Webbie is director Bill Webb, whom Weisman puts in a class with
Coyle.</TE>
<TE>   Weisman, whose baseball coverage has won numerous Emmy Awards for
both NBC and Fox, likes to spread the praise. But he hasn't done too
badly himself.</TE>
<TE>   World Series Notes</TE>
<TE>   Those annoying virtual advertisements behind home plate, which
first appeared during last year's World Series, will again be part of
Fox's coverage. The virtual ads are controlled by the sales
departments of Fox and Major League Baseball, not the Fox production
crew.... Until this season, Buck was an announcer for the St. Louis
Cardinals, a team that employed his father, Jack, for almost 50
years. Is he disappointed the Cardinals didn't reach the World
Series? "In some ways, I'm relieved," Buck said. "I don't have to
field all those questions about bias. The only team I care about is
the Fox production team." ... Buck's partner, Tim McCarver, worked 20
Giant games for the San Francisco Fox affiliate this season. He
worked for the Yankees during the regular season in 2001, and they
lost the World Series to Arizona. But McCarver worked for the Yankees
the previous two seasons, when they won.</TE>
<TE>   Rory Markas and Terry Smith are not the only first-year Angel
radio announcers. So is Spanish-language announcer Jose Mota, who
works with Ivan Lara on XPRS (1090). Mota, the son of Dodger coach
Manny Mota,  has also done games in English. He worked a Dodger game
with Kenny Albert for Fox last season. Says the Dodgers' Jaime
Jarrin: "Not only is Jose a fine announcer, he is also a fine
gentleman." XPRS' listening audience increased 350% this season....
Mota will be co-host of a World Series special on KSPN (1110) tonight
from 7-11 with Jerry Gardner. The show will originate from the ESPN
Zone at Downtown Disney.</TE>
<TE>   KSPN's Joe McDonnell and Doug Krikorian will cover today's pep
rally, then Saturday and Sunday they will be broadcasting near Gate 2
at Edison Field from 1-4:30 p.m. Todd Donoho and Dave Stone will be
on after the game from the ESPN Zone until 11 p.m.... Angel flagship
station KLAC (570) and sister station KXTA (1150) will simulcast a
special preview show from 4-7 p.m. today with Markas and Smith....
Featured on KLAC's "Down in the Dugout" pregame show at 4 p.m.
Saturday will be an interview Markas taped with Enberg, who was the
Angels' lead announcer from 1973 to '78.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   NBC's Tom Hammond, 57, had heart surgery in Lexington, Ky.,
Tuesday and probably will miss the Breeders' Cup telecast Oct. 26....
Tim Hardaway has been hired as an NBA studio analyst by ESPN.... HBO
has signed Jim Lampley to a multiyear contract. Among his duties, he
will be host of a 12-part series on the best of HBO boxing, scheduled
for next spring.... Recommended viewing: The Laker season will be
previewed in a special titled "4-Ward March" on Fox Sports Net Sunday
at 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   Jim Pells, who died this week of complications after heart
surgery, wore many hats. He was a respected and well-liked sports
producer for Fox Sports Net, did video graphics for the Dodgers and
compiled statistics for many Southland announcing crews. After
graduating from Westchester High in 1970 and UCLA in 1974, he was a
fixture at Dodger Stadium, the Forum and more recently Staples
Center. He was 50 and the father of two young children.</TE>
<TE>   Said the Kings' Bob Miller, "Jim was a good friend and a
tremendous asset. He worked quietly and efficiently behind the scenes
and was more knowledgeable about a variety of sports than anyone I
know. Anytime I had a question, he always had the answer. He helped a
lot of announcers."</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With their most bruising running back out because of injury and a
kicker who has misfired more than usual, the Bruins are zeroing in on
their red-zone offense.</LD>
<LD>   Manuel White, UCLA's biggest back at 6 feet 3 and 243 pounds, will
sit out a second consecutive game because of a hamstring injury.</LD>
<LD>   New starter Tyler Ebell has been outstanding, but he is only 5-9
and 170 pounds.</LD>
<TE>   "That's where Akil [Harris] has got to play a little bit," Coach
Bob Toledo said. "But there are some places Tyler also can be in. The
short-yardage goal line is a concern because we don't have a big
back. Akil [6-0, 215] will assume some of that role."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins are 16 of 22 with 11 touchdowns and five field goals
when they get inside the 20.</TE>
<TE>   Twice they missed field goals inside the red zone, and once they
gave up the ball on downs. (The other three times they didn't score
because the game ended.)</TE>
<TE>   "We need to improve in the red zone area, obviously," Toledo said.
"You've got to make kicks when you're in the red zone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's interesting. Last week we weren't down on the goal line, we
made so many big plays. We practiced our goal-line offense and didn't
have to use it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll take those 70-yard touchdowns. I don't mind those either. If
we don't have to use goal-line or red zone, I'll be happy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Much of the concern about Chris Griffith was for his psyche after
his missed field goal in the 31-30 loss to Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   But he and the coaches also have tried to figure out what is going
on technically to contribute to him going seven of 12 on field goals
after missing only three of 13 last season.</TE>
<TE>   One problem has been the low trajectory of some kicks, in addition
to accuracy. "We think part of it was probably his plant foot,"
Toledo said. "We're not sure, but out here he's slipped a little bit,
not planting good. And he's just kicking it a little high [on the
ball]. He's not getting under it enough."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   About two dozen UCLA players are from Northern California, and
many relish the trip to the area.</TE>
<TE>   Two seniors, linebacker Marcus Reese from San Jose and cornerback
Joe Hunter from Vacaville, have yet to win at Cal or Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "For those particular guys, it's their last go-round," Toledo
said. "Even some of the underclassmen. You talk to [receivers Craig
Bragg from San Jose and Tab Perry from Milpitas.] They're excited
about going back too. Any time you're from an area, like kids that
come back to California, they want to look good in front of their
friends and family."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Jon Dubravac will not make the trip because of a bruised
back.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Roenicke will replace him.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Positioning itself as a possible national title contender, Azusa
Pacific plays Southern Oregon in a key game between two ranked
National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics football teams Saturday
night in Ashland, Ore.</LD>
<LD>   Azusa Pacific is 5-0 and ranked 14th after defeating Division II
Humboldt State, 35-22, last week. Senior quarterback Luke Winslow has
completed 62% of his passes for 1,175 yards and 10 touchdowns with
just one interception. Sophomore running back Ben Buys has already
scored 12 touchdowns to rank fourth in Cougar history in a single
season.</LD>
<LD>   Southern Oregon (4-1) was ranked second in the NAIA poll earlier
this season before losing Sept. 21 in double overtime to Linfield.
The fifth-ranked Raiders have won all three meetings between the
teams, including a 64-21 victory last season that ranks as Azusa's
worst defeat.</LD>
<TE>   Junior running back Dusty McGrorty is averaging more than 157
yards and keys a balanced offense that averages 416 yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   In the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference,
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps is off to a 4-0 start overall and shares first
place with Cal Lutheran and Redlands after one week of league play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The top-ranked USC women's volleyball team plays host to UCLA in
their first Pacific 10 Conference matchup this season tonight at the
Lyon Center. The teams meet again Nov. 15 at Pauley Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   USC (15-0, 8-0 in the Pac-10) is one of only four undefeated teams
in the nation and is off to its best start since 1977. UCLA (12-6,
5-3), which leads the all-time series 50-38, has won five of its last
six matches.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two soccer teams lost for the first time this season as the Loyola
Marymount men fell in double overtime to San Diego State, 3-2, on
Wednesday and the Pepperdine women lost to Loyola, 1-0, on Sunday.
The Lion men are 11-1-2 and ranked seventh by the National Soccer
Coaches Assn. of America. Pepperdine is 10-1-2 and ranked 17th....
UCLA (6-1-2, 1-0-0 in the Pac-10) faces top-ranked Stanford in a
men's soccer match tonight at Drake Stadium. The Bruins defeated
Stanford at home last year and earned a scoreless tie in Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton's 2003 baseball recruiting class was ranked
second by Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball magazines. UCLA
was ranked fifth and seventh, respectively, while USC's class was
judged to be ninth and 12th. Georgia Tech has the top recruiting
class, according to both publications.</TE>

<HD>Williams Will Start at Receiver</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>USC receiver Mike Williams worked longer and harder during practice
this week preparing for Saturday's game against Washington.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, it became apparent that the No. 19 Trojans will need
the freshman from Tampa, Fla., to start in place of injured senior
Kareem Kelly and play most of the snaps against the No. 22 Huskies.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly, trying to recover from a sprained right ankle suffered last
week against California, took part in limited drills but is still
feeling pain. He expects to play, but conceded that Williams deserved
the start.</LD>
<TE>   Williams rotated with Kelly during the first six games and caught
28 passes for 434 yards and four touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "I end up coming in the second play anyway so it's just like
starting," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   After dropping four passes in a loss at Kansas State, Williams is
emerging as the Trojans' main scoring threat.</TE>
<TE>   He caught two touchdown passes against Oregon State, had six
receptions for 112 yards and a touchdown against Washington State and
caught six passes for 103 yards and a touchdown last week against
Cal.</TE>
<TE>   "The K-State game was a pretty good thing," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kind of on a high and I came back down to earth because I
had a bad game. I tried to just improve off that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Running back Justin Fargas will return kickoffs against
Washington, a move to keep the senior transfer involved following
Sultan McCullough's 39-carry performance against Cal.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Hershel Dennis angered coaches when he tried to return a
kick from deep in the end zone against Cal.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans were also penalized on the play, resulting in poor
field position.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior cornerback Marcell Allmond will make his first start since
Sept. 30, 2000 when he played receiver against Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Allmond switched to the secondary during spring practice.</TE>
<TE>   He is replacing redshirt freshman William Buchanon, another
converted receiver, at left cornerback.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not pressure -- more excitement," Allmond said. "I have to
just try to control it and hope I don't go out there overexcited.</TE>
<TE>   "I just have to play the way I've been coached."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Safety Troy Polamalu participated in nearly every drill and said
he was prepared to play, and possibly start, against Washington....
For the second day in a row, kicker Ryan Killeen missed several kicks
during competitive drills.... Defensive tackle Shaun Cody said
swelling in his right knee is subsiding. He will be examined by a
doctor on Saturday and could set a date for surgery to repair a torn
anterior cruciate ligament.</TE>

<HD>France, Russia Bend on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Key Security Council members seem ready to accept a
compromise with the U.S. on a resolution to back up inspections with
force.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley, Robin Wright and Tyler Marshall</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- France and Russia appeared ready Thursday to accept
a compromise resolution that says the U.S. will consult with the
Security Council -- but not have to wait for its authorization --
before taking military action if Iraq blocks weapons inspectors.</LD>
<LD>   Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov said that he believes
there are "favorable conditions" for council agreement. Although
France had not formally accepted the U.S. compromise, reportedly
holding out for a few changes in the draft, diplomats thought that
there would be agreement soon. French diplomats declined to comment,
but others close to the process said Paris had informally signaled
its acceptance.</LD>
<LD>   "Their instinct is to push for more," said a council diplomat,
"but they won't let that kill the deal."</LD>
<TE>   Conversations with French and Russian colleagues "are going well,"
said Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who was in New York for a
scheduled speech but spent the day lobbying Security Council
ambassadors by phone and meeting with the U.N.'s chief weapons
inspector, Hans Blix. After the meetings, a senior State Department
official sounded optimistic that five weeks of negotiations were
finally coming to a close. "Everyone is feeling now we're in the
homestretch," the official said. "We've rounded the bend."</TE>
<TE>   The resolution proposed by the U.S. is a deliberately ambiguous
compromise that allows its main opponent on the council, France, to
take credit for keeping the U.S. from acting without the U.N.
Although the United States would prefer U.N. backing, the language of
the draft also ensures that it would not have to win a second
Security Council resolution to authorize a strike.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States does not need any additional authority, even
now, to take action to defend ourselves," Powell said. Any resolution
that emerges, he added, would preserve the right of the U.S. to act
in concert with other nations "even though the U.N. would not wish to
act."</TE>
<TE>   The French have been insisting on a two-step process designed to
keep the U.S. from launching a strike as soon as weapons inspectors
run into trouble in Iraq. The first resolution, under the French
proposal, would strengthen the inspectors' mandate and grant them
immediate access to any site in Iraq. If the inspectors were impeded,
the French would require a second resolution to approve war. In the
last week, however, French diplomats have amended their criteria to a
"second meeting, not necessarily a resolution," paving the way for
compromise.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. formula falls between its demand for a single resolution
and the French preference for two -- resulting, in effect, in a step
and a half.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. draft calls for the Security Council to convene
immediately if the chief weapons inspectors report "any failure by
Iraq to comply with its disarmament obligations, including its
obligations regarding inspections." The council would then "consider
the situation" -- and, the U.S. hopes -- declare Iraq in further
"material breach."</TE>
<TE>   A second resolution authorizing action would be welcome but not
necessary, U.S. officials insist. The declaration of "material
breach," a U.S. official said, would signal adequate multilateral
support for the U.S. to act without the formality of a resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "The French don't oppose military action if Iraq fails to
cooperate with inspectors," a council diplomat said. "They just don't
want the U.S. to go off on its own. The U.S. has said it will consult
with the council, but it doesn't want to be bound by it."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. draft represents a careful compromise, not only with the
Security Council but also with demands of hard-liners in the Bush
administration. Although French diplomats say they dislike the demand
for "consequences" -- implying but not specifying military action --
in the draft, the U.S. insists on keeping the term.</TE>
<TE>   Powell described "consequences" as one of the key elements of the
resolution. A resolution must make "clear that Iraq has been in
violation -- in material breach -- of U.N. resolutions for a long
period of time," he said. Inspectors must go in with "more powerful
instructions and with much more support. And third, there must be a
threat -- consequences for their continued failure" to comply.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott Abrams, special presidential advisor, accompanied
Ambassador John D. Negroponte to the Security Council chamber today,
reminding other ambassadors by his presence that the more hawkish
elements within the Bush administration limit the U.S. wiggle room at
the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gone as far as we can go," said an official, who requested
anonymity. "The hard-liners will not let us go any further. Just
going back to the Security Council is problematic for them."</TE>
<TE>   In the Security Council on Thursday, ambassadors from other
nations lined up to voice their opinion in a debate that has left out
most of them.</TE>
<TE>   Syria said it agrees that Iraq must disarm, but it demanded that
Israel also be forced to comply with the many Security Council
resolutions that cover the Israeli-Palestinian issue. "Israel has
shirked implementation of Security Council resolutions for decades,"
complained Ambassador Mikhail Wehbe.</TE>
<TE>   Britain's Jeremy Greenstock said his government has privately
assured President Saddam Hussein that, if he gives up weapons of mass
destruction, the United States will not launch a war on Iraq. "This
choice is being offered genuinely. It represents a single, final
chance for Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Russia's Sergei V. Lavrov repeated his government's initial
position that no new resolutions are necessary, but he acknowledged
that Moscow is willing to bend on that point. "We believe the crux of
the matter is: What are we waiting for? The inspectors can travel to
Iraq tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Ambassador Negroponte said that the United States was
offering Iraq one last chance to comply with U.N. requirements but
that Iraq's initial responses were not encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   "Not surprisingly, in the first test of the so-called new Iraqi
cooperation, Iraq has shown that they hope to return to the word
games, ephemeral commitments and misdirection of the past, while
continuing to develop the world's deadliest weapons," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the public debate, Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed Douri took a more
conciliatory tone than Hussein, who warned today that American blood
would spill if the U.S. invaded Iraq and that "the enemy will fall on
its face, despised, condemned and defeated."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Douri invited the inspectors to return to Iraq "tomorrow
or the day after tomorrow," and said that the U.S. portrayal of Iraq
as evasive and recalcitrant was a distortion. "I assure you," he
said, "we will not hinder the work of the arms inspectors."</TE>

<HD>Fear Seen as Driving N. Korea Disclosure</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Sonni Efron</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>What was Kim Jong Il thinking?</LD>
<LD>   As North Korea-watchers in Washington and Seoul on Thursday
digested the bombshell admission that Pyongyang has a secret nuclear
weapons program, speculation centered on what motivated the
secretive, Stalinist North Korean leader to fess up. At the same
time, they wondered whether the Bush administration can justify
negotiating with North Korea while threatening to invade a similar
nuclear aspirant, Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts agreed that only Kim himself could have made the snap
decision to admit to visiting U.S. diplomats two weeks ago that the
evidence they presented showing North Korea had been working for more
than two years on a uranium-based nuclear weapons program was
accurate.</LD>
<TE>   Some speculated that the regime's unapologetic confirmation that
North Korea has "a nuclear weapons program and more" was motivated by
the fear that the Bush administration, once it finishes a possible
invasion of Iraq, intends to turn its wrath on another nation that
President Bush has identified as a member of an "axis of evil": North
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't disregard North Korea's paranoia and its fear of a U.S.
attack," cautioned L. Gordon Flake, a North Korea expert and head of
the Mansfield Center for Pacific Affairs in Washington. "The more the
U.S. displays its capacity to and willingness to extend its reach --
and what some people see as violate the sovereignty of other
countries -- the more frightened North Korea becomes."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Niksch, an Asia specialist with the Congressional Research
Service, said: "The message is ... we have powerful weapons, more
powerful than Iraq, and if you're thinking about coming after us for
your next target after Iraq, you better think twice, because we can
hit back harder than the Iraqis can."</TE>
<TE>   The question for U.S. policymakers is how to appear to have a
consistent policy toward both "proliferators," while taking into
account the fact that the two nations pose dramatically different
security challenges.</TE>
<TE>   The fundamental difference is that North Korea once threatened to
turn Seoul into "a sea of fire" if attacked, and the U.S. has long
judged that Pyongyang is capable of doing so.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has a standing army of 1.2 million, about 70% of which
is forward-deployed within 60 miles of the demilitarized zone, and
about 10,000 artillery pieces dug into hardened positions within easy
range of the South Korean capital.</TE>
<TE>   Although North Korea would certainly lose a war with the
U.S.-backed South Korea, U.S. military planners have long concluded
that the South could suffer millions of casualties before the
Northern threat would be neutralized.</TE>
<TE>   "Seoul is held hostage," Flake said.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has frequently issued military threats to bolster its
diplomacy. Playing the nuclear card is the ultimate message to
Washington that however impoverished North Korea may be, its military
might is not to be underestimated.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the phenomenon was, 'I am North Korea. Hear me roar! I
can make nuclear weapons,' " a senior State Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   Others interpreted the confession as a characteristically clumsy
North Korean way of coming clean with the United States in hopes of
forging a new and better relationship. They note that North Korea's
recent charm offensive toward Japan featured Kim's awkward confession
that his military abducted Japanese civilians in the 1970s and '80s.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts saw the North Korean admission as a prelude to
proposing a bargain. During the Clinton administration, Pyongyang
repeatedly floated the idea that Washington might compensate North
Korea for giving up weapons sales -- an idea the Bush administration
finds ideologically intolerable.</TE>
<TE>   "At a minimum, he's trying to put North Korea back on the U.S.
radar screen," said Robert Einhorn, who spent years negotiating with
North Korean diplomats as the Clinton administration's point man on
missile control. "The Bush administration has not placed North Korea
at the center of its universe, and I think North Korea would like to
get [its] attention.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably signals that the North Koreans are willing to bargain
over this program," Einhorn added. "Whether the Bush administration
is prepared to bargain is another story."</TE>
<TE>   And some observers said that North Korea's decision to pursue a
weapons program as an insurance policy against superpower America and
its South Korean ally, while simultaneously seeking better relations
with Japan and South Korea, is not as irrational as it might seem.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're like us, they have a Foreign Ministry that wants to
have better relations and they have a Defense Ministry that wants to
have better weapons," said Gary Milhollin of the Wisconsin Project on
Nuclear Arms Control in Washington. "They're about as rational as we
are."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever Kim's motivation, the fact that the Bush administration
waited 12 days to make the news public -- and then made a vague
announcement only when the story began to leak out -- shows what a
dilemma the disclosure poses for American policymakers, foreign
policy experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The words "nuclear weapons program and more" are widely
interpreted to mean biological and/or chemical weapons, which the
United States and Japan have long suspected North Korea of
developing.</TE>
<TE>   That means North Korea could have virtually the same arsenal of
mass destruction that the United States insists Iraq must be denied.
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein denies having any such weapons, but
U.S. officials say they do not believe him.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Iraq's presumed chemical and biological arsenal, its
military threat is far less certain, defense experts said, and the
West does not believe that Iraq has a nuclear weapon -- yet.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody can foresee a low-cost war in North Korea, whereas some
people can foresee a low-cost war in Iraq," Milhollin said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, although the United States views Kim as a repressive
dictator who uses terror, runs a vast prison camp system and is
believed to have allowed his people to starve while he expanded his
weapons program, he does not have Hussein's track record of
aggression.</TE>
<TE>   "North Korea has never used weapons of mass destruction. Iraq
has," noted Mitchell Reiss, a former official with the Korean
Peninsula Energy Development Organization and now dean of
international affairs at the College of William &amp; Mary in
Williamsburg, Va. "North Korea in the last 50 years has not invaded a
neighboring country. Iraq has. North Korea is not in violation of any
U.N. Security Council resolutions. Iraq is."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration can nevertheless signal a consistent
approach by insisting that the North Koreans submit to unfettered
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, just as it
demands the Iraqis do.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the administration was signaling a cautious,
multilateralist approach that enlisted support from Japan, South
Korea, Russia and China in pressuring North Korea to allow such
inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Next, the Bush administration would likely try to reimpose stiff
international sanctions that would wipe out the political and
economic gains that North Korea has recently scored.</TE>
<TE>   If that should fail, the U.S. might increase the military pressure
on North Korea while stopping short of an attack, Niksch said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expressed fervent hope that the Bush administration would
find a face-saving way for the North Koreans to capitulate and allow
inspections, because the prospects for a favorable outcome to any
military confrontation are grim.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no good options on the Korean peninsula," Flake said.</TE>

<HD>Indonesia Will Use Decree to Go After Terrorists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, accused by neighboring countries of
heading a regional terrorist group, was named by Indonesian police
Thursday as a suspect in a series of church bombings and ordered to
appear for questioning.</LD>
<LD>   The move appears to be the first step in a crackdown on suspected
terrorists in Indonesia following a weekend car bombing on the resort
island of Bali that killed more than 180 people, mostly young
foreigners.</LD>
<LD>   President Megawati Sukarnoputri, who has been under pressure from
the United States for months to take action against alleged
terrorists, said Thursday that she will issue an emergency decree
enabling police to hold terror suspects without trial.</LD>
<TE>   The order could trigger the immediate arrest of Islamic militants,
including Bashir, who have been linked to terrorist activities by
authorities in other countries but are living freely in Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Megawati is expected to sign the decree today, and Bashir has been
ordered to report to police on Saturday. He denies any role in
terrorist acts.</TE>
<TE>   "To combat terrorism, the government needs a legal base," the
president told reporters. "So the government is going to issue a
[decree] soon."</TE>
<TE>   The presidential order will be similar to anti-terror legislation
that has been stalled for months in parliament. Under the
constitution, the president can bypass legislators in times of
emergency and enact laws by decree.</TE>
<TE>   The action has the support of parliamentary leaders, including
Speaker Akbar Tanjung, who appeared with Megawati on Thursday to
announce the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the situation we are facing at the moment can be
considered as an emergency," he told reporters after an hourlong
meeting with the president.</TE>
<TE>   While the decree has not been made public, a draft of the
legislation would allow the detention of suspects for up to a year
without trial. Justice Minister Yusril Ihza Mahendra told reporters
that the maximum penalty under the decree would be death.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights activists are concerned that the decree could be
abused by the military in places where the government is fighting
separatist guerrillas, such as Aceh and Papua regions.</TE>
<TE>   One of the main targets is Bashir, 64, who is accused by Singapore
and Malaysia of heading Jemaah Islamiah, a regional group Singaporean
authorities say plotted to blow up the U.S. Embassy and six other
targets in their nation last year.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say some members of the group have ties to Osama bin
Laden's Al Qaeda terror network and trained at Al Qaeda camps in
Afghanistan. More than 100 alleged members have been arrested in
Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines but none in Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir, a charismatic preacher who praises Bin Laden as an Islamic
warrior and says the use of violence is justified to defend Islam,
served more than three years in prison and spent 14 years in exile in
Malaysia for opposing the regime of former Indonesian strongman
Suharto.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the government has been reluctant to arrest Bashir for
fear of antagonizing Islamic militants, a small but vocal minority in
Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country.</TE>
<TE>   To provide a legal foundation for Bashir's arrest, the government
sent investigators to interview Omar Faruq, an Iraqi who was quietly
arrested by Indonesian intelligence agents in June and turned over to
American authorities.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say Faruq confessed he was a senior leader of Al
Qaeda in Indonesia and masterminded the simultaneous church bombings
on Christmas Eve in 2000 that killed 19 people. He also said he was
involved in two plots to assassinate Megawati.</TE>
<TE>   Information provided by Faruq about planned Al Qaeda bombings
prompted authorities to close several embassies in Southeast Asia in
September, but officials say he did not tip off investigators about
plans to blow up nightclubs in Bali.</TE>
<TE>   Brig. Gen. Saleh Saaf, national police spokesman, said Thursday
that Faruq repeated his confession for Indonesian investigators,
including naming Bashir as the leader of Jemaah Islamiah.</TE>
<TE>   Faruq has said the Christmas Eve bombings were planned with
Bashir's "knowledge, approval and logistical support." He also said
Bashir was involved in the bombing of a mosque and a shopping mall.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir denies ever meeting Faruq.</TE>
<TE>   Saaf declined to discuss who else Faruq had named but told
reporters to watch what police did next. "We want to show the world
and the Indonesian people that we are serious in dealing with
terrorists," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia has been criticized by neighboring countries and the
U.S. for not moving decisively against terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Only after the Bali bombing did Indonesian officials publicly
acknowledge that Al Qaeda is active in their nation. Officials
continue to maintain that Jemaah Islamiah does not exist in
Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush and Megawati talked by phone for 20 minutes
Thursday, agreeing that the Bali attack required a "swift and
decisive response."</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Announces Troop Pullback</HD>
<DH>Responding in kind to India's move, Musharraf orders the
withdrawal of forces from the nations' border but not from the
Kashmir cease-fire line.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Watson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Following India's step back from the brink, Pakistan announced
Thursday that it will begin withdrawing several hundred thousand
troops from front-line positions on the two nations' border.</LD>
<LD>   But even as the months-long military standoff eased, Indian
security forces claimed that they killed five suspected guerrillas
slipping into the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir, a bloody
reminder that the 55-year dispute over that region is far from over.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistan's announcement that it will withdraw its troops to
"peacetime locations" followed India's statement Wednesday that it
would start a phased pullback of forces from the border. Pakistani
President Pervez Musharraf met with top commanders and ordered the
withdrawal to begin Monday, a military source said.</LD>
<TE>   Both countries said they will keep their troops dug in along the
Line of Control, the 460-mile-long cease-fire line in disputed
Kashmir drawn at the end of their 1971 war. The line is still the
scene of frequent, and often deadly, clashes between Indian forces
and separatist guerrillas in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan insisted that
India needs to take the next step and start pulling its forces out of
the roughly two-thirds of Kashmir that it controls.</TE>
<TE>   "India has the largest concentration of forces in Indian-occupied
Kashmir -- over 700,000 security forces," Khan said. "For the sake of
the peaceful resolution of the dispute, those forces should also be
withdrawn.</TE>
<TE>   "After all, the people of Kashmir are also being affected by
that," Khan added. "And there have been so many casualties because of
that."</TE>
<TE>   In New Delhi, India's Foreign Ministry repeated Thursday that the
government wants an end to what it calls cross-border terrorism
before Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee will sit down for talks
with Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistani leader has repeatedly denied giving anything more
than moral and political support to what Pakistanis see as freedom
fighters battling mostly Hindu India's rule in the mainly Muslim
state of Jammu and Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   But when Kashmiris in the Indian-controlled portion began voting
for a new state government last month, U.S. Ambassador to India
Robert Blackwill said Washington believed that incursions from
Pakistani-held territory were on the increase again after a lull of
several months.</TE>
<TE>   Five guerrillas from the little-known Tehrik-e-Jelali, believed to
be an offshoot of Islamic militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, were gunned
down around noon Thursday crossing from Pakistani-held territory
through the town of Patridak, according to Lt. Col. S.P.K. Singh of
the Indian army.</TE>
<TE>   "Pakistani troops assisted them with mortar fire while they were
trying to infiltrate," Singh said by phone from the Kashmiri city of
Udhampur. "Fifty rounds of 82-millimeter mortar, all high explosives,
were fired by the Pakistanis."</TE>
<TE>   He said five rifles were recovered from the militants.</TE>
<TE>   Indian security forces also killed three fighters from the
militant group Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen on Thursday morning in the
Baramulla district of the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, Singh
said. The fighters were armed with two AK-47 assault rifles, a
pistol, three grenades and a radio set, he said.</TE>
<TE>   International efforts to start formal talks over Kashmir's future
may be complicated by the new political power that Islamic parties
gained in Pakistan after a strong showing in last week's general
elections.</TE>
<TE>   No single party won an outright majority in the National Assembly.
But a loose alliance of conservative Islamic parties, called the
Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal, or United Council of Action, came in third
and is trying to negotiate a role in government.</TE>
<TE>   Although the alliance's leaders include pragmatists who say they
aren't a threat to Musharraf's foreign policy, the mullahs are
hard-liners on the issue of Kashmir. They, and millions more
Pakistanis, consider the fight over the region to be a jihad, or holy
struggle.</TE>
<TE>   Maulana Fazlur Rehman, the Islamic alliance's nominee for prime
minister, had guarded praise for Musharraf's pullback order.</TE>
<TE>   Though Rehman called the withdrawal "a bit premature," he added:
"The government has played a wise move by throwing the ball back to
India's court, which will now be under international pressure to
respond to Pakistan's unilateral withdrawal of forces."</TE>
<TE>   As tensions between Pakistan and India mounted early this year,
Musharraf ordered his security forces to shut down offices,
fund-raising and training camps for most of the Pakistani-based
militant groups fighting in Jammu and Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   But at least one, Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen, still has an office in the
city of Peshawar, in Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province, and in
Muzaffarabad, the capital of the Pakistani-controlled portion of
Kashmir. Other groups continue to recruit fighters and raise money
less openly.</TE>
<TE>   India and Pakistan began massing hundreds of thousands of troops
along their international border late last year after a Dec. 13
terrorist attack on India's Parliament left 14 dead, including five
gunmen. India's Vajpayee made it clear that his patience with
Pakistan had run out after 34 people, more than half of them women
and children, were massacred in a May 14 terrorist attack on a bus
and military base near Jammu, the Indian state's winter capital.</TE>
<TE>   As India sent strong signals that it was preparing to attack
Pakistan, the U.S. said it secured a firm commitment from Musharraf
that he would stop cross-border infiltration, and the crisis was
defused.</TE>
<TE>   Despite India's claims that the incursions continue, both sides
have been taking tentative steps toward a resumption of negotiations
over Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee said Thursday that he will attend a regional summit in
Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, scheduled for February. If there
are no large-scale terrorist attacks before then, he may make an
overture to Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   India's charges of Pakistani backing for terrorists didn't stop
the two leaders from holding a summit near India's Taj Mahal in July
2001. It was the first meeting between the two countries' leaders in
two years, and hopes were high for a breakthrough in the Kashmir
dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The summit ended in failure, but Vajpayee and Musharraf still
agreed to meet again. The terrorist strike on India's Parliament,
however, put them back on a war footing.</TE>

<HD>News of N. Korean Arms Program Shocks Region</HD>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>SEOUL -- South Koreans and Japanese expressed shock Thursday over
reports from Washington that North Korea has a secret nuclear weapons
program, amid fears that tension in North Asia could rise
precipitously.</LD>
<LD>   And in a region where nuance and indirect communication are highly
valued, some questioned the blunt way Washington disclosed the
information, whether North Korea's statement might have been taken
out of context and why U.S. officials waited two weeks after
Assistant Secretary of State James A. Kelly's meetings in Pyongyang,
the North's capital, to drop such a bombshell.</LD>
<LD>   "The U.S. should not be in such a hurry to take us on a collision
course," said Moon Chung In, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Yonsei
University. "If the U.S. takes a hard-line stance against North
Korea, it's not good for Japan, South Korea, the U.S. or the entire
region."</LD>
<TE>   Yim Sung Joon, top national security advisor to South Korean
President Kim Dae Jung, told reporters Thursday that Kim plans to
raise the issue with President Bush and Japanese Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi at a three-way summit next week in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement that it
would raise the nuclear issue in ministerial talks between the two
Koreas set to begin Saturday in Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   "The president views this as a grave matter, and it is his
position that it is unacceptable under any circumstances for North
Korea to develop nuclear weapons," Yim told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Japan has also said it plans to raise the issue at a meeting with
North Korean officials in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, scheduled for late
this month.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say Washington has apparently decided to work through
Japanese and South Korean diplomatic channels on this issue in part
because it is stretched so thin with terrorism-related commitments
around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, South Korea and Japan have seen an improvement in
their respective relations with North Korea, and the prospect of
sliding backward, perhaps into war, is anything but welcome.</TE>
<TE>   Although many in the region suspected that North Korea had been up
to no good, the disclosure that it had violated its 1994 pledge to
freeze its nuclear program left many scratching their heads Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I was absolutely dumbfounded to hear the news," said Im Hee Keun,
44, an editor at a South Korean publishing company. "I vaguely
imagined they had the raw materials, but to hear them actually admit
it was something else again."</TE>
<TE>   Ordinary citizens, along with professionals in East Asian think
tanks, brokerage houses and the highest levels of government, this
week sought to fathom why North Korea would admit to having a nuclear
program, especially given its long history of intricate brinkmanship
and feints.</TE>
<TE>   Some suspect that North Korea hoped to entice Kelly into striking
some sort of bargain and badly miscalculated.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they sort of admitted, 'OK, we continued this secret
program, but we're prepared to make a deal,' " said Paik Jin Hyun,
international law and relations professor at Seoul National
University. "It's amazing to see how little they understand the Bush
administration. That was probably the last thing they should have
done."</TE>
<TE>   Others read it as another deliberate ratcheting up of the stakes.</TE>
<TE>   "North Korea wants to hold a more powerful diplomatic card," said
Toshiyuki Hijikata, a Korean peninsula security expert at Japan's
Teikyo University. "Up until now, they had a nuclear suspicion card.
Now they have a nuclear development card. They hope to gain more
leverage from negotiations."</TE>
<TE>   Longtime North Korea watchers said there's probably no single
motivation behind Pyongyang's recent disclosures, confessions and
apologies, but one thing is clear: The isolated state faces growing
financial problems as its economy implodes and hard currency falls
into increasingly short supply.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, North Korea has been able to secure grain, fuel oil,
cash payments and even herds of cows in return for reduced
hostilities and more "normal" behavior. Tokyo and Washington recently
have also dangled aid programs and access to loan packages in return
for improved diplomatic relations and an end to the development and
export of its most dangerous weaponry.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea's latest disclosure threatens to undermine a recent
upturn in the regional outlook.</TE>
<TE>   In a historic breakthrough, Koizumi visited Pyongyang on Sept. 17,
prompting a North Korean admission that its agents abducted 13
Japanese during the 1970s and 1980s, eight of whom allegedly have
since died. The apology has sparked talk of normalization between the
two nations, which have had no formal diplomatic relations since
World War II. Japan occupied the Korean peninsula for 35 years after
1910.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea has also seen things turn for the better with its
northern neighbor in the wake of a June 29 gun battle in the Yellow
Sea that killed four South Koreans and left another missing and
presumed dead. Since then, Pyongyang has issued something close to an
apology, initiated ministerial-level meetings and sent several
hundred athletes to compete in the Asian Games hosted by South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers noted, however, that Pyongyang's overtures toward
Seoul and Tokyo might have been an attempt to enlist allies against
the Bush administration, which has showed little willingness to back
away from its hard-line stance.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they've given up on driving a wedge between South
Korea, Japan and the U.S.," Paik said.</TE>
<TE>   But that could backfire. Kelly is in China today and scheduled to
visit Seoul and Tokyo this weekend to make sure that the allies are
all on the same page.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea's admission, along with reported comments that it
feels it no longer needs to abide by the 1994 agreement, has cast
growing doubt on the future of the framework, which was negotiated by
the Clinton administration. A key issue involves inspections by the
Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, which Washington
says must take place and Pyongyang has resisted. Each side accuses
the other of acting in bad faith.</TE>

<HD>Kuwaiti Youth With Carload of Gasoline Bombs Turns Himself
In</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KUWAIT CITY</DL>
<LD>Kuwaiti authorities arrested a teenager Thursday who had explosives
in his car near a high-rise where some U.S. military personnel live
about 15 miles south of Kuwait City, Kuwaiti officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The 17-year-old youth was arrested near the Alia and Ghalia towers
in Fintas, an Interior Ministry official said on condition of
anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   The youth had 10 bottles filled with gasoline, each with a cloth
fuse, and allegedly told police that he had received orders over the
Internet from someone in Pakistan to place the explosives in the
towers.</LD>
<TE>   However, the youth apparently reported the suspicious vehicle
himself, waited in the area and, when approached by police, admitted
driving the car containing the explosives, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   The car belonged to the youth's father, according to the Kuwait
News Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday, the Interior Ministry released a formal statement
to Kuwaiti media in which it said reports that the youth was
"carrying explosive material to use against that residential complex
are totally baseless."</TE>
<TE>   It said the youth who was arrested had told a security guard that
he had 10 bottles of fuel in his car parked near the complex.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the area went about their business, apparently
unaware of any trouble.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Firefight With Gunmen in Gaza Kills Six</HD>
<DH>The Palestinians were slain after troops reportedly came
under attack in a refugee camp.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A fierce exchange of fire between Israeli troops and Palestinian
gunmen Thursday turned a Gaza Strip shantytown into a battleground
where at least six Palestinians, including two women and two
children, were killed and an estimated 50 others wounded, according
to Palestinian hospital officials and witnesses.</LD>
<LD>   The deaths come amid criticism by the Bush administration and
Israeli human rights activists over a recent upsurge in civilian
deaths during Israeli military operations in the West Bank and Gaza.
Israel expressed regret over the latest loss of life but said
Palestinian gunmen often use crowded residential neighborhoods as
cover when attacking Israeli troops.</LD>
<LD>   The firefight in the town of Rafah, hard by the Egyptian border at
Gaza's southern tip, began when Palestinian gunmen fired on Israeli
armored bulldozers that were carrying out fortification work Thursday
afternoon on a road along the frontier, said Lt. Col. Olivier
Rafowicz, a spokesman for the Israeli military.</LD>
<TE>   Palestinian residents of the Rafah refugee camp described huddling
together as machine-gun fire and tank shells slammed into a crowded
warren of cinderblock homes threaded by narrow alleyways, known as
Block O.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids were crying -- I was trying to hold a 6-year-old kid who was
hurt, and a tank fired right toward us," said Hussein Abed Al, a
21-year-old Palestinian who was bloodied by shrapnel wounds to his
hand and leg.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ali Moussa, head of Rafah hospital, said that six people were
confirmed dead and that, based on statements from arriving wounded,
at least two more bodies were believed to be lying in the rubble.
During the fighting, which lasted more than an hour, heavy
machine-gun fire struck a boys school operated by the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency, forcing teachers and pupils to seek shelter
in the basement, the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   Gaza, long a flashpoint for violence and known to be a stronghold
of militant groups, has suffered a disproportionate share of civilian
deaths in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Israel says a string of recent army operations in Gaza is aimed at
uprooting the infrastructure and targeting the leadership of militant
groups, such as Hamas, that have carried out bombings and attacks on
Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   However, Gaza is an extremely crowded area, and it is difficult
for ordinary Palestinians to stay out of harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, a Palestinian toddler in Rafah was killed by falling
debris during an Israeli raid aimed at destroying infiltration
tunnels used by Palestinians to smuggle weaponry from Egypt. On Oct.
7, 17 Palestinians were killed and scores wounded in an army raid in
the southern Gazan town of Khan Yunis, during which a missile was
fired into a crowded residential area.</TE>
<TE>   Those deaths drew criticism from the Bush administration. Before
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's visit this week to Washington, the U.S.
had called on him to try to stem civilian casualties during military
operations.</TE>
<TE>   In the outside world, and the Arab world in particular, anger over
Palestinian casualties complicates efforts by the United States to
lay the groundwork for a war in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Israel, however, insists that Palestinian combatants bear much of
the blame for the carnage.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal, of course, is not to kill civilians," said Rafowicz,
the military spokesman. "Rafah is a war zone, because the
Palestinians have decided to use it as a war zone. They are firing at
us from residential areas.... They are endangering their own people,
and they know it."</TE>
<TE>   Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, speaking on Israeli
television, expressed regret over any civilian deaths and said the
circumstances would be investigated. But he, like other senior
Israeli officials, gave no indication that Israel would be deterred
from bringing heavy pressure to bear on militant groups.</TE>
<TE>   Military commanders "make every effort so as to avoid civilian
casualties. I am aware of the damage, the cumulative damage,"
Ben-Eliezer said. "We do not believe there is anything heroic about
killing children."</TE>
<TE>   In Rafah, angry crowds gathered outside the main hospital,
chanting calls for revenge and firing weapons into the air. Burials
for most of the dead were expected to be held today, which is the
main prayer day of the Muslim week, and funeral processions are
typically occasions for outbursts of wild fury.</TE>
<TE>   In volatile Gaza, Israel considers Rafah an area of particular
difficulty and danger. Officials say Palestinian militant groups use
a network of tunnels beneath the Gazan-Egyptian border to bring in
weapons. Some of these tunnels, they add, dead-end among a tangle of
buildings and passageways in the refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Eliezer said the armored bulldozers that were fired upon,
setting off the fighting, had apparently come across another tunnel.</TE>

<HD>Vanishing Monkeys, and Money</HD>
<DH>The titi's survival is a test for cash-strapped Costa Rica,
which has staked its tourist-driven economy on protecting the
environment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MANUEL ANTONIO NATIONAL PARK, Costa Rica</DL>
<LD>In the still of the early morning in the rain forest, a crash shakes
the trees. Then silence.</LD>
<LD>   Maurilio Cordero jerks his head up, straining to see through the
canopy and shafts of sunlight that slice through the jungle like
headlights in the dark. He shakes his head.</LD>
<LD>   "Just a bird," he says. "No monkey."</LD>
<TE>   Cordero, a nature guide, is searching for the titi monkey, a type
of squirrel monkey found only in Costa Rica and Panama. It's small,
cute and furry -- and in danger of vanishing from the Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Only 3,500 to 4,500 are left in the wild, and experts say they may
become extinct in the next several decades. Their habitat is
dwindling, chopped into smaller and smaller chunks by hotels, homes
and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Their survival has become a test for Costa Rica, which has staked
its international reputation -- and its tourism-dependent economy --
on protecting the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen years after casting off the taint of Central America's
civil wars and positioning itself as a rain forest on a hill, the
nation is struggling to fulfill its commitment to be a
conservationist's paradise.</TE>
<TE>   Government pledges to buy land to turn into national parks remain
unfulfilled. Mega-hotels are pushing to build golf courses and beach
resorts next to unspoiled rain forest. Water and air pollution remain
a serious problem in parts of the country.</TE>
<TE>   That is not to say there is a lack of political will. More than
any other recent administration, Costa Rica's new government has put
the environment at the center of its agenda, going to battle with
transnational oil and mining companies.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is a lack of resources. Although it is an island of
prosperity and tranquillity compared with its Central American
neighbors, Costa Rica still lacks the cash to pay for the country's
extensive network of social services and its ambitious environmental
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists are watching the nation with concern: If Costa
Rica cannot find a way to balance the demands of its growing
population with its strong desire to protect its environment, they
worry, what hope is there for other efforts around the world to
promote sustainable development?</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge issue," said Martha Honey, a scholar at the
Institute for Policy Studies in Washington and the author of a recent
book on ecotourism. "I don't think there's any developing country
that has moved as far as Costa Rica has in terms of making ecotourism
a business that involves locals and is part of national policy."</TE>
<TE>   And yet the monkey is in trouble. There is no comprehensive
government effort to save it, though it is perhaps the most
recognized of Costa Rica's endangered species and is the main
attraction at the country's most popular national park.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the monkey's salvation depends upon the uncoordinated
efforts of several small groups of concerned business owners,
nonprofit organizations and citizens who are struggling to find ways
to buy up habitat and educate people on the dangers the monkey faces.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Damalas is president of the Assn. for the Conservation of the
Titi Monkey, a group of local business owners who have banded
together to protect land where the monkeys live. The group stepped
in, he said, because the government simply wasn't doing enough.</TE>
<TE>   "If this symbol goes, it's the beginning of the end," said
Damalas, owner of a hotel near this stunningly beautiful national
park. "If we can't maintain the monkey as a species, everything else
will go as well."</TE>
<TE>   Costa Rica has long been at the forefront of the environmental
movement, establishing some of the first national parks in Central
America. More than 10% of the country has been set aside as protected
habitat over the years.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1980s, however, it suffered in the shadow of the Cold
War conflicts that embroiled neighboring countries such as Nicaragua
and El Salvador. Though Costa Rica played no major role in the
fighting, visitors shunned it and the rest of the war-torn isthmus.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in 1987, President Oscar Arias was given the Nobel Prize for
his efforts to broker peace accords in the region. The award put
Costa Rica on the map as a haven, and it flourished as a tourist
destination.</TE>
<TE>   Tourists began arriving in droves to take in the country's natural
beauty, from the gently rolling highlands dotted with green coffee
bushes to breathtaking stretches of rain forest along its two coasts.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, what had been a vague hope became reality: Costa Rica's
commitment to protecting the environment began paying off through
ecotourism, that sector of the tourist industry that puts visitors
directly in contact with nature and wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, more than 1 million tourists came to Costa Rica.
Tourism has become the country's largest generator of foreign income,
bringing nearly $1 billion per year. The country's high-tech and
coffee businesses, meanwhile, have been hit hard by recent declines
in those industries.</TE>
<TE>   When he took office this year, President Abel Pacheco quickly
showed his determination to put ecotourism at the center of the
country's economic future.</TE>
<TE>   He banned all new oil drilling and mining, burying the hopes of
U.S. oil companies seeking to drill off the Caribbean coast and
sparking a confrontation with a Canadian gold mining firm preparing
to dig in northern Costa Rica.</TE>
<TE>   He also has proposed a series of constitutional amendments -- the
first major changes in more than 50 years -- that would force courts
to consider the impact of any decision on the environment.</TE>
<TE>   "Costa Rica has decided that the environment is going to be a
pillar of our development," said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, minister of
energy and the environment. "These guarantees are transcendental and
important."</TE>
<TE>   While nobody questions that ecotourism has benefited the country,
some doubt it can solve all of Costa Rica's problems.</TE>
<TE>   The nation is generally economically stable, but its social
commitments -- including free health care and generous social
security benefits -- have left it with a huge public debt, nearly
equal to 50% of the country's $15.9-billion gross domestic product.</TE>
<TE>   This year, there's only $660,000 available for environmental
programs, including land acquisition, according to Rodriguez's
ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "The government does what it can with the resources it has, but
it's not nearly enough," said Joel Saenz, an ecologist at Costa
Rica's National University who has studied the titi monkey. "Like all
Latin American governments, Costa Rica doesn't have a lot of money."</TE>
<TE>   The economic pressures, along with a wave of illegal immigration
from Nicaragua and corruption that has allowed illegal development to
flourish in some places, have contributed to the government's failure
to fulfill many of its environmental commitments. Manuel Antonio
National Park is a prime example.</TE>
<TE>   The 1,684-acre park is the most visited in the national system and
perhaps the most striking. Tucked into a point of land jutting out
from nearby Quepos, it was once a getaway spot for executives from
the United Fruit Co., which controlled the vast banana plantations
that once dominated the region.</TE>
<TE>   Trails wind through dense tropical forest. Wildlife abounds.
Sloths dangle from soaring trees. Several different species of monkey
shake through the jungle. Hawks float overhead. Clear blue water laps
against broad, sandy beaches.</TE>
<TE>   Its most important role, however, may be as the sole protected
habitat in Costa Rica for the titi monkeys, also known as red-backed
squirrel monkeys because of the orange or red stripe running down
their backs.</TE>
<TE>   The small, friendly animals weigh about a pound and a half. They
are not aggressive and are often taken in as pets--an illegal but
common occurrence.</TE>
<TE>   It's actually not difficult to find a monkey. They thrive around
humans because they eat fruit from trees planted on small farms.</TE>
<TE>   Some bars around the park have made a habit of feeding the monkeys
in the evenings, resulting in "Monkey Hour" drink specials.</TE>
<TE>   The animals' seeming ubiquity has obscured the danger they face.
The population has declined from an estimated 200,000 in the early
1980s, mostly because of habitat fragmentation.</TE>
<TE>   The monkey spends most of its time in the trees and has the
unfortunate habit of using electrical wires to help it cross roads,
often resulting in electrocution.</TE>
<TE>   Experts fear that as their habitat is chopped up further,
different tribes of the monkeys will become more isolated, leading to
their eventual extinction through inbreeding.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel Antonio National Park, which has 200 to 300 of the monkeys,
forms the heart of conservationists' plans to string together a web
of protected areas and wildlife corridors.</TE>
<TE>   But the key is getting the money to buy the land. Government
programs to reforest or protect surrounding areas -- dominated by
ecotourism lodges and plantations of African oil palms and rice --
have foundered in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, the government paid local farmers to reforest or
leave undisturbed about 1,600 acres of forest in the surrounding
area. This year, there was only money for about 500 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, 30 years after Manuel Antonio park was founded, the
government hasn't even finished paying for it. About 30% of the land
remains in the hands of private owners, who are still waiting to be
compensated.</TE>
<TE>   "Poor farmers can't protect their land without money," said
Gerardo Abarca, a local forestry manager who is in charge of
conservation and reforestation programs. "The government is giving no
incentives to the farmers to protect the environment."</TE>
<TE>   That's where local businesses and nonprofit groups have stepped
in. Several different organizations have begun raising money to
either buy land outright or pay local landowners to not develop their
property.</TE>
<TE>   Damalas' group of local hoteliers and business owners dedicated to
ecotourism has begun buying trees to reforest habitat for the monkey.
Its argument is economic: Businesses should invest in the environment
to save the monkey, which draws tourists to the park.</TE>
<TE>   Another group is the Foundation of Preserved Lands, which is
trying to buy a farm on the southern Pacific Coast that is ideal
habitat for the animal. The property lies in the path of a proposed
dam project.</TE>
<TE>   Both groups are small and struggling. Damalas' organization has
only about 16 members from among the hundreds of local businesses.
And the foundation has raised only a few thousand dollars to purchase
the $800,000 property.</TE>
<TE>   But both have pledged to fill the gap left by the government.</TE>
<TE>   Damalas' group, for instance, already has planted about 5,000
trees along a strip of river south of Manuel Antonio Park.</TE>
<TE>   The hope is that the trees will provide a natural bridge over the
river, allowing the monkey access to more habitat without exposing it
to the danger of electrocution.</TE>
<TE>   Such efforts have energized people like Cordero, the nature guide.
Despite a fruitless meander through the park in search of the monkey,
he is hopeful about its future.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a big mistake in Costa Rica. We depended on the
government for everything," he said as he wandered down a sun-dappled
path. "Now, we are coming together and making our voices heard."</TE>

<LD>BEIJING -- Days before a U.S.-China presidential summit, Chinese
authorities have paroled a Tibetan nun thought to be one of the
youngest and longest-serving female political prisoners in China,
according to a U.S. human rights campaigner.</LD>
<LD>   Ngawang Sangdrol was granted parole by a Tibetan court that said
she was released nine years early because of good behavior, according
to John Kamm, director of the San Francisco-based Dui Hua Foundation.
She left Drapchi Prison in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, and has
rejoined her family, Kamm said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The case has not been mentioned in the Chinese press, and there
has been no official comment on her release.</LD>
<TE>   Ngawang Sangdrol was a member of a group of 14 female Tibetan
prisoners dubbed the "singing nuns" by human rights and Tibetan
independence groups that campaigned for her release.</TE>
<TE>   She was born in 1977 into a family of eight children; her father
and brother also have been detained for pro-independence activism.
According to human rights groups, she was arrested in 1992 at the age
of 15 after participating in pro-independence protests along with
others from the Garu Nunnery, north of the capital. She was sentenced
to three years for "counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement."
(The crimes were dropped from China's criminal code in 1997.)</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Ngawang Sangdrol and 13 other women in Drapchi
prison recorded songs protesting their treatment, calling for Tibetan
independence and praising Tibet's exiled religious leader, the Dalai
Lama. "May no others suffer like this/In the heavenly realm, the land
of snows," said one song on the tape smuggled out of Drapchi.</TE>
<TE>   Prison authorities considered Ngawang Sangdrol the ringleader of
the protests and singled her out for severe beatings, rights groups
allege, citing testimony from former Drapchi prisoners. Her sentence
was extended by six years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Ngawang Sangdrol was involved in prison protests against
Beijing's selection of the 11th Panchen Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's
second-highest cleric. Authorities put her in solitary confinement
and extended her sentence by eight more years. More protests earned
her another extension, with a release date of May 3, 2013.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, French President Jacques Chirac and several U.S.
lawmakers have raised Ngawang Sangdrol's case with Beijing. Last
year, Tibetan authorities said she had shown repentance, reduced her
sentence by 18 months and exempted her from hard labor.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the other "singing nuns" have been released or had their
sentences reduced. Kamm said China has released nine out of 18
Tibetan prisoners cited by the State Department in meetings with
Chinese officials last year in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Besides releasing prisoners, Chinese authorities this year have
allowed envoys of the Dalai Lama to visit Tibet, the first such trip
since 1985. They have also hosted visits to Tibet by U.S. Ambassador
to China Clark T. Randt Jr., U.S. congressional staffers and foreign
journalists.</TE>
<TE>   Citing those actions, Samdhong Rinpoche, prime minister of the
Tibetan government in exile, last month urged Tibetans and their
supporters to refrain from protesting Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
visit to the United States next week.</TE>

<DL>ZAMBOANGA, Philippines</DL>
<LD>Bombings of two department stores that killed seven people Thursday
bore similarities to an Oct. 2 blast that killed an American Green
Beret and three others at a marketplace in this largely Christian
city, the military said.</LD>
<LD>   Because of the comparison, suspicion fell on Abu Sayyaf, a Muslim
militant group the U.S. government believes is linked to Osama bin
Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network. Like the earlier attack,
Thursday's bombings apparently used dynamite. They came 30 minutes
apart and injured 152 people.</LD>
<LD>   There was no claim of responsibility, but military spokesman Lt.
Col. Danilo Servando said suspicion fell on an Abu Sayyaf faction
headed by Khadafi Abubakar Janjalani, one of five leaders of the
group indicted by the U.S. Justice Department in July for a mass
kidnapping last year that left a number of hostages dead, including
two Americans.</LD>
<TE>   Government officials have said Abu Sayyaf may have links with
Jemaah Islamiah, another Islamic militant group in Southeast Asia
that allegedly has ties to Al Qaeda. Philippine officials also have
alleged attempts by Bin Laden's lieutenants to provide Abu Sayyaf
with training.</TE>

<HD>Plan Is to Pressure North Korea</HD>
<DH>U.S. will seek to stop Pyongyang's nuclear arms program
through peaceful means and maintain its focus on threat posed by
Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter and Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush believes North Korea's disclosure that it has a secret
nuclear weapons program is "troubling, sobering news," his spokesman
said Thursday, but the administration and many members of Congress
insisted that Iraq remains the primary threat facing the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   A day after U.S. officials reported that North Korea had
acknowledged the bomb-building program, presidential spokesman Scott
McClellan said Bush intends to "seek a peaceful solution" through
diplomacy to stop the North's nuclear program.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the president plans to talk to heads of state and
government about the issue at a gathering next week in Mexico City,
and with Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Oct. 29 during a summit at
the Bush ranch near Crawford, Texas.</LD>
<TE>   Washington was jolted by news that North Korea had secretly forged
ahead with an enriched-uranium program, despite an 8-year-old pledge
to drop efforts to develop nuclear weapons in return for aid and a
chance for improved relations.</TE>
<TE>   The development threatens the nuclear balance in East Asia and
adds a new challenge for an administration that is already struggling
to root out Al Qaeda and Taliban foes in Afghanistan, prepare for a
possible attack on Iraq and cope with the worldwide terrorist threat.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Bush administration official said the U.S. goal is a
diplomatic initiative that will bring pressure to bear on North Korea
from its neighbors to end its program.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to nuke them; we're going to use pressure," said
the official, who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese and South Korean officials indicated Thursday that they
too prefer to negotiate an end to the weapons program through
diplomatic channels.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials believe that North Korea's enriched uranium program
is at least 2 years old but may have been going on since shortly
after a 1994 deal in which the North pledged not to carry on nuclear
arms development.</TE>
<TE>   The senior administration official said U.S. authorities believe
the North Koreans thought they could carry on with the secret program
even as the United States gave them civilian nuclear power
facilities, oil and other benefits agreed upon in the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "They thought they could have their cake and eat it too," he said.
"But they can't."</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said he believes the North
Koreans not only have a nuclear weapons program but also have "one or
two" nuclear bombs. While CIA reports and some military officials
have made similar suggestions, Rumsfeld is the highest-ranking
official ever to make such an assertion.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Rumsfeld said in response to a reporter's question that
Iraq remains the most significant threat. "Iraq has unique
characteristics that distinguish it and that suggest that it has
nominated itself ... for special attention because of the threat of
what they're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said he saw no point in conducting inspections in North
Korea, since the country has acknowledged a program that would
constitute a breach of four international treaties it has signed.</TE>
<TE>   He also disagreed with some analysts who have taken it as a
positive sign that the North has owned up to its violations.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's any way in the world anyone could say it's
a good sign," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. lawmakers reacted with outrage to news of the North Korean
weapons program.</TE>
<TE>   Some called for a reassessment of American policy toward North
Korea, and some urged a program of economic sanctions and political
pressure to compel the Stalinist regime to halt the program. But many
key members of Congress who spoke on the issue seemed to support the
administration's plan to cautiously consider its options and avoid
becoming distracted from the effort to deal with Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, said North Korea's "reckless brinksmanship must be met
with firm and united resolve." But he stressed joint action on the
threat, saying that South Korea, Japan, Russia and China "must play a
vital role in the next few weeks in reducing the regional tensions
created by these violations."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said that "obviously,
North Korea is a matter of concern. But clearly, the one we have to
deal with immediately is Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, called on North Korea "to immediately end its
nuclear weapons program" and to come into compliance with the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty, which it signed. Biden added that he
commended the administration for its plan to work with East Asian
allies in seeking a solution.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) called on North Korea to
halt its development of unconventional weapons and to open up for
international inspections.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, a few members called for more forceful action,
some arguing that the threat of a nuclear-armed North Korea was more
menacing than that of Iraq. "We regard the North Korea weapons of
mass destruction threat to be at least as serious as the threat posed
by Iraq," Reps. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), Benjamin A. Gilman
(R-N.Y.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) said in a letter to Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "We urge you to take a strong and vigorous response to this threat
before it is too late."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz), joining the lawmakers at a news conference,
urged the administration to "come down very hard" on North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The lawmakers called on the administration to request urgent
action by the U.N. Security Council to condemn North Korea for
violating its nuclear nonproliferation commitments and provide for an
"appropriate response" if the North's leader, Kim Jong Il, fails to
comply.</TE>
<TE>   They also called on the administration to cut off all economic
aid, other than food and medicine.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the U.S. was
not contemplating the sort of military assault it has been
threatening against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not planning anything of that nature right now," he said as
he emerged from a meeting with chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans
Blix. "We have a serious situation in Northeast Asia.... North Korea
has some explaining to do to the international community."</TE>
<TE>   One expert on North Korea's nuclear capabilities said that if
containment fails, the North Koreans could easily reactivate the
plutonium stockpiles that they put under guard as part of the 1994
agreement with the international community to freeze their nuclear
program.</TE>
<TE>   "We know they have enough spent fuel [to make] another five to six
weapons within a period of six months," said Mitchell Reiss, now dean
of international affairs at the College of William &amp; Mary in
Williamsburg, Va.</TE>
<TE>   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the U.S. came
across the information that revealed the North Korean program last
summer.</TE>
<TE>   He said U.S. officials had delayed their disclosure of the program
for 12 days after the North Koreans acknowledged it because
"basically we looked for an opportunity to conduct consultations with
our friends and allies in private" ahead of time.</TE>
<TE>   Another administration official also acknowledged that North Korea
may have gotten key components for its nuclear weapons from another
country.</TE>
<TE>   While the official declined to discuss which country may have been
the source, many analysts believe the chief suspects are China,
Russia or Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   If Pakistan was the source, it could mean a major new complication
in the U.S.-led war on terrorism, of which Pakistan has become an
important part.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Enron Trader Admits Rigging Energy Market</HD>
<DH>Executive's guilty plea to a conspiracy charge vindicates
Gov. Davis and others who alleged criminal acts led to California
power crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Joseph Menn and Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- A former top Enron Corp. executive pleaded guilty
Thursday to a federal conspiracy charge for rigging California's
electricity markets during the power crisis, giving the state
powerful ammunition in its claim for $9 billion in refunds from
energy companies.</LD>
<LD>   Timothy Belden, 35, Enron's chief energy trader in the West and a
corporate vice president, became the first person convicted of a
crime in connection with California's 2000-01 energy crisis. He also
agreed to cooperate with investigators in a widening probe that could
lead to charges against executives at Enron and other companies.</LD>
<LD>   The guilty plea -- which also requires Belden to forfeit $2.1
million in "criminally derived" compensation from Enron -- was
vindication for California Gov. Gray Davis and other state officials
who have alleged criminality was at the root of the crisis. Last
year, Vice President Dick Cheney suggested California was to blame.</LD>
<TE>   "These charges answer the question that has long troubled
California consumers: whether the energy crisis was spurred in part
by criminal activity," said Kevin Ryan, U.S. attorney for Northern
California. "The answer is a resounding yes."</TE>
<TE>   The investigation is being led from Ryan's San Francisco office,
but in an indication of its importance, the plea agreement was
announced at the Justice Department's headquarters in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In a scripted proceeding before U.S. District Judge Martin Jenkins
in San Francisco, the slight and balding Belden stood flanked by his
two attorneys and repeatedly acknowledged his role in schemes with
colorful names such as Fat Boy and Get Shorty.</TE>
<TE>   Belden agreed to plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to
commit wire fraud arising from various Enron strategies for
manipulating California markets. He hesitated only when Jenkins asked
him why he had committed the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did I do it?" Belden repeated. "I did it because I was trying
to maximize profit for Enron."</TE>
<TE>   Exactly how much money Enron made from the schemes was not clear,
although Deputy Atty. Gen. Larry Thompson said the revenues brought
in by Belden increased sixteenfold over a three-year span ending in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   "During the period of the ... conspiracy, Enron's revenues from
Belden's trading unit rose from $50 million in 1999, to $500 million
in 2000, to $800 million in 2001," Thompson said. "A portion of these
increased revenues was due to the execution of these schemes." He
would not comment on what that amount might be.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, California is seeking $9 billion for alleged
overcharges by Enron and other power sellers. Those claims are based
on an analysis of market data by the state's power grid operator done
before the extent of Enron's questionable trading strategies was
known.</TE>
<TE>   The initial analysis from May 2001, which tallied more than $6
billion in potential overcharges, blamed Enron for a small portion,
about $28 million. The study noted, however, that Enron consistently
bid high prices for electricity it was selling into the market,
showing it "clearly exercised market power to inflate prices." The
overall claim of market overcharges was later increased by the state,
but a new company-by-company breakdown has not been produced.</TE>
<TE>   The criminal plea should bolster the state's demands for payback.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe it's another round of ammunition in our battle for
refunds," said Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary. "It's proof
positive that there was market manipulation."</TE>
<TE>   Enron's trading schemes were first detailed in Enron memos
released this spring by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The
memos said other companies had adopted similar tactics, prompting
FERC to quickly widen its investigation. Most energy traders denied
they used the Enron tactics, and FERC's investigation is continuing.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's schemes sought to take advantage of California's
deregulated energy market to boost profits, according to Belden's
plea agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The ploy dubbed Death Star involved creating artificial congestion
on the power grid by scheduling electricity service that Enron did
not intend to complete. The company would then collect payments to
relieve the contrived bottleneck. Another -- dubbed Ricochet --
involved transmitting power out of California and then selling it
back at higher prices.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department investigators concluded that the strategies
relied on false information fraudulently submitted by Enron to
California regulators. Enron was paid by bank wire transfer, giving
rise to the wire fraud charge.</TE>
<TE>   Belden's guilty plea should be the first of many convictions,
suggested Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).</TE>
<TE>   "I do not believe this fraudulent activity begins or ends with
this one individual," Feinstein said. "In fact, we know traders from
other companies have engaged in similar behavior."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said the federal investigation is "active and ongoing."</TE>
<TE>   Belden's plea Thursday triggered speculation about which
individuals and companies might be targeted next.</TE>
<TE>   Belden could possibly implicate higher-ranking Enron executives,
criminal attorneys said, such as former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and
former Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling. Another possible target
is former Enron President Lawrence G. Whalley, who oversaw Enron's
trading operation from Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Court documents filed Thursday said Belden was assisted by "other
Enron officers and employees," but did not name any other
individuals. In San Francisco, Belden's attorney said her client was
following corporate policy.</TE>
<TE>   "He learned how to do these trading strategies at Enron, and he
was never disciplined," said lawyer Cristina Arguedas, adding that
Belden didn't mastermind the operations and was not "some kind of
Lone Ranger."</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, what Belden said today through his attorney is that he
was, in the vernacular, only following orders," said Stephen L.
Meagher, a former federal prosecutor who now is a partner with
Phillips &amp; Cohen in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Tim Belden is extremely dangerous to a lot of people," said
Christian Schreiber, an investigator with the state Senate select
committee to investigate price manipulation of the wholesale energy
market.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure there are people across the industry sweating today upon
this news."</TE>
<TE>   Lay's lawyer could not be reached for comment. Attorneys for
Skilling and Whalley said they were not worried.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Whalley has been cooperating with all the regulatory agencies
in this investigation," said his attorney Zachary Carter, "and he
will continue to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Meagher also said Belden may help investigators looking at trading
practices at other companies, because the Enron memos noted that the
trading ploys had been adopted by competitors.</TE>
<TE>   California's demand for nearly $9 billion in electricity refunds
is pending before FERC, separate from the Justice Department
investigation. FERC Chairman Patrick Wood said Thursday that he
expects a preliminary decision on refunds by an administrative law
judge in December and a final determination early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Deflecting questions about how the Belden plea would affect the
refund case, Wood said: "We have not said 'no' to refunds. We have
the judge trying to calculate them."</TE>
<TE>   Belden could face up to five years in prison and a fine of
$250,000, in addition to the $2.1 million he has agreed to pay in
restitution.</TE>
<TE>   That money, from his personal accounts at brokerage Charles
Schwab, represents the portion of Belden's salary and bonus
attributable to the schemes, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Matthew
Jacobs.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors promised to recommend leniency only if Belden
continues providing "substantial assistance" in the probe.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in a gray suit and blue shirt, Belden did not respond to
reporters' questions. He was joined at the hearing by his parents,
and was released without paying bail. Both sides asked for his
sentencing to be delayed at least six months as the government
follows the trail he is showing investigators.</TE>
<TE>   After Enron's collapse, Belden was employed briefly by UBS
Warburg, which acquired the firm's energy trading business. But his
lawyer said the former trader now is out of work.</TE>

<HD>'Sobering' State Report Calls Autism an Epidemic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas H. Maugh II</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An explosion in autism cases in California over the past 15 years is
not the result of changes in diagnostic criteria or an improvement in
diagnosis, but represents a real epidemic that is sweeping the state,
according to a major new study sent to the state Legislature on
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The number of people with autism being served by the California
Department of Developmental Services surged by 273% from 1987 to 1998
-- and is still growing by about nine cases per day. That increase
cannot be explained away by better data, immigration to the state or
any other simple rationale, the report said.</LD>
<LD>   Experts believe the epidemic is affecting the rest of the country
-- and most industrialized nations -- as well, but California is a
bellwether because it is the only state for which good data are
presently available.</LD>
<TE>   "Autism is on the rise in the state and we still do not know why,"
said Dr. Robert S. Byrd of UC Davis' MIND Institute, the primary
author of the report. "The results of this study are, without a
doubt, sobering. They increase the urgency of trying to find an
answer about what causes autism."</TE>
<TE>   Experts said the report should quell the controversy over whether
the epidemic is real.</TE>
<TE>   "This study will prove to be a landmark in that it clearly dispels
many myths and misconceptions regarding the reality of the widely
discussed epidemic of autism," said Bernard Rimland of the Autism
Research Institute in San Diego. "The epidemic is very real. There
has been an enormous increase in the prevalence of autism, and the
increase cannot be explained by artifacts."</TE>
<TE>   The growth of autism cases in California has been startling: from
4,911 cases in 1993 to 18,460 cases as of July. Of that latter
number, 13,935 are children younger than 18.</TE>
<TE>   The surge in cases forced the department to seek additional
funding of $17.2 million this year to treat all of them, according to
Cliff Allenby, director of the Department of Developmental Services.
"This is really straining our resources," he said.</TE>
<TE>   California has been particularly affected by the epidemic because
it is required by state law to provide services to any resident
diagnosed with autism or other mental disorders, Allenby said.</TE>
<TE>   Services in other states "are limited by their budgets," he added.
The increase may well be happening there also, "but they don't see
it."</TE>
<TE>   Autism is a severe developmental disorder in which children seem
isolated from the world around them. There are a broad spectrum of
symptoms, marked by poor language skills and an inability to handle
social relations. No cure exists, but many problems can be alleviated
with intensive behavioral therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd's three-year study was commissioned by the Legislature after
a 1999 report of the 273% increase in autism cases over a decade.
During the same period, in contrast, the department's enrollment of
children with other disorders, such as epilepsy or cerebral palsy,
increased 30% to 40%, consistent with the growth in the state's
population.</TE>
<TE>   His team enrolled 684 children who receive services from the
department, dividing them into two age groups 7 to 9 years of age and
17 to 19, representing the periods before the rise in new cases and
after it. The team found that 375 children had autism and 309 had a
diagnosis of mental retardation.</TE>
<TE>   Comparing the two groups, the team concluded that there had been
no loosening in the criteria used to diagnose autism. Furthermore,
more than 90% of the children in both groups were born in the state,
eliminating the possibility that the increase was the result of
families coming to California to seek better services.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an important first step because it removes the suspicion
that things are changing in terms of diagnoses," Allenby said. "Now
it is incumbent on investigators and us to try to find out why it is
happening, because we don't know yet."</TE>
<TE>   Genetics clearly plays a role. Researchers have so far identified
at least half a dozen genes that predispose people to the development
of autism. But virtually everyone agrees that genes are not the sole
answer. "Genes don't cause epidemics," Byrd said.</TE>
<TE>   Many parents believe that vaccines are at the root of the problem.
Some think the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is the primary
villain, some maintain that a mercury-based preservative in the
vaccines is the problem, and others argue that the 20 or more
vaccinations infants receive by the age of 2 simply overwhelm their
immune systems.</TE>
<TE>   But "there is absolutely no evidence for that," according to Dr.
Robert Edwards of UC San Francisco.</TE>

<HD>Vatican to Reject Parts of U.S. Bishops' Abuse Policy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vatican officials are expected today to turn down central elements of
the sexual abuse policy adopted by U.S. bishops last June.</LD>
<LD>   Pope John Paul II met privately Thursday with several leading U.S.
bishops as the Vatican completed its long-awaited response to the
"zero tolerance" policy that would discipline priests accused of
sexually molesting minors.</LD>
<LD>   The response, which is scheduled to be formally unveiled at a news
conference in Rome, is expected to caution the American hierarchy
that key sections of the policy should not be implemented until a new
joint U.S.-Vatican commission can rewrite key sections dealing with
the rights of priests accused of sexual abuse.</LD>
<TE>   Although details of the Vatican's response remained few, experts
in the canon law of the church have said for weeks that Vatican
officials had decided that some elements of the policy go too far and
violate rights of priests guaranteed by church law.</TE>
<TE>   "The Vatican is especially concerned about protecting the rights
of the accused -- here they are acting like the ACLU or the U.S.
courts in response to the U.S. Department of Justice's actions since
Sept. 11," said Father Thomas Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine
America.</TE>
<TE>   "Just as the ACLU does not want to protect terrorists, neither
does the Vatican want to protect sex abusers, but both are concerned
about due process," Reese said.</TE>
<TE>   Even a partial rejection of the plan would be a cause of
embarrassment for U.S. bishops and could be expected to introduce new
tensions into the American church.</TE>
<TE>   Reports from Rome on Thursday that the Vatican was not prepared to
accept the policy in full quickly brought expressions of
disappointment from leaders of groups that support victims of abuse
by priests.</TE>
<TE>   David Clohessy of the Survivors Network for Those Abused by
Priests said bishops should implement their policy, no matter what
the Vatican may say.</TE>
<TE>   "Dozens of bishops have gotten in trouble for protecting
predators. Now maybe it's time some of them get in trouble for
protecting children," he said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   The policy, known as the Charter for the Protection of Children
and Young People, was approved last June in Dallas by the U.S.
Conference of Catholic Bishops at the height of the sexual abuse
scandal that has rocked the church since January.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, it removes any church statute of limitations
and sets down a policy of "zero tolerance" by the church for sexual
abuse of minors, "past, present, or future."</TE>
<TE>   It also calls for the immediate removal of a priest, deacon or
other church employee whenever there is a credible accusation of
sexual abuse. If the accusation later proves unfounded, the person is
to be returned to ministry.</TE>
<TE>   The charter's definition of sexual abuse goes beyond civil law to
include activity that may not involve physical contact.</TE>
<TE>   Though American bishops have said that each bishop is free to
voluntarily put the charter into effect in his individual diocese --
and virtually all have said they have done so or will soon -- the
charter is not mandatory until it receives the Vatican's recognitio,
or endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   But if the charter runs afoul of canon law, even determined U.S.
bishops may find themselves hard-pressed to follow it.</TE>
<TE>   Noting how politicized the debate has become, Reese cautioned that
both sides seemed to be trying to influence public perception of the
Vatican's statement before it is issued.</TE>
<TE>   "I have argued from the very beginning that the Vatican would give
the bishops a yellow light -- proceed with caution -- not a red light
or a green light," said Reese, who has followed developments closely.</TE>
<TE>   Canon lawyers have noted several problems with the policy. Among
others, "the present policy has one punishment for all the crimes,"
said a Boston College theology professor, Thomas Groome.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the pillars of Western jurisprudence is that punishment
should fit the crime, and, in this document, it doesn't," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican statement, contained in a letter to be made public
today, said the Vatican was well aware of the seriousness of sexual
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   When the pope met last April with U.S. cardinals, he said there
was no room in the priesthood for those who would sexually abuse
minors. The pope not only said that sexual abuse is a sin, but he
also acknowledged that it is a civil crime.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Doyle, a professor of religious studies at the University
of Dayton, a Catholic university, said the Vatican was expressing a
legitimate concern that accused priests be given adequate opportunity
to defend themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "The proposed policies were formulated in an atmosphere of crisis
in which many voices were demanding 'zero tolerance' for offenders.
Such slogans may sound good on a common-sense level, but they do not
address the intricacies of specific cases involving complex human
beings," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles said
that Cardinal Roger M. Mahony's intention is to implement the policy.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever happens, the sexual abuse policies of the Los Angeles
archdiocese will not be changed. No priest who's been found to have
abused a minor will be returned to ministry," spokesman Tod Tamberg
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to comply with state laws on mandated reporting
and we will continue to cooperate with civil authorities who are
investigating allegations of sexual abuse by clergy."</TE>

<HD>Convictions of Boys in Father's Death Overturned</HD>
<DH>Judge may order a new trial, saying the prosecutors'
differing theories of the slaying had violated the rights of the
Florida youths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John-Thor Dahlburg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A judge on Thursday threw out the adult murder convictions of two
Florida boys, found guilty in the beating death of their father with
a baseball bat when they were 12 and 13.</LD>
<LD>   Circuit Judge Frank Bell in Pensacola said prosecutors violated
the boys' rights by arguing two contradictory theories of the slaying
at the same time, calling the tactic "unusual and bizarre." Bell said
he would order a new trial for the brothers, Alex and Derek King, if
prosecutors and defense attorneys couldn't agree among themselves on
how to resolve the case.</LD>
<LD>   Alex, now 13, and Derek, 14, had been facing prison terms of 20
years to life because prosecutors had charged them as adults in a
murder case that attracted national attention.</LD>
<TE>   The brothers' trial, which ended Sept. 6 with guilty verdicts for
second-degree murder without a weapon and arson, was the latest in a
number of Florida court proceedings where juveniles have been tried
for murder as adults and sentenced to long stretches in adult
prisons.</TE>
<TE>   The boys' father, Terry King, 40, was killed by repeated blows to
the head from an aluminum bat last Nov. 26 as he dozed in his
recliner. His home in Cantonment, Fla., was set on fire.</TE>
<TE>   In an odd legal maneuver, prosecutors charged King's two sons in
the killing, but held a separate murder trial for a family friend and
convicted child molester, Ricky Chavis, 40. He was acquitted, but the
verdict was kept sealed until jurors returned a verdict in the boys'
case.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors from the boys' trial said they came to believe that it was
Chavis who bludgeoned the elder King with the bat, while the boys
helped by letting him in the house. They were shocked to learn that
another jury had acquitted Chavis.</TE>
<TE>   "We never thought that these boys committed the crime. Never,"
Lynne Schwarz, the forewoman, said during a rally held Thursday
morning on the brothers' behalf outside the Pensacola courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Corder, one of the lawyers for Derek King, accused
Assistant State Atty. David Rimmer of prosecutorial misconduct, a
serious charge, for organizing two trials based on different theories
for the same murder.</TE>
<TE>   "In trial one, he said Mr. Ricky Chavis did it, and in trial two,
that Derek King did it," Corder said in a telephone interview. The
prosecution claimed the younger brother stood by and egged him on.</TE>
<TE>   After the killing, the boys gave taped confessions to police
exonerating Chavis, but later contended that Chavis had bludgeoned
their father as they hid in the trunk of his car.</TE>
<TE>   Alex King also testified he had been molested by Chavis. The man
still faces separate trials for the alleged sexual molestation and on
charges of evidence tampering and being an accomplice after the fact
to murder.</TE>
<TE>   Rimmer, the prosecutor, could not immediately be reached for
comment after Bell's ruling. But he told the Pensacola News Journal
beforehand that he was satisfied with the trials' outcome and planned
to ignore the morning rally.</TE>
<TE>   "That's their right if they want to protest," the News Journal
quoted Rimmer as saying. "Personally, I don't have time to argue with
every little yellow dog that barks along the highway."</TE>
<TE>   Corder said the brothers' trial had yet again revealed a "hole" in
Florida's criminal justice system for minors accused of serious
crimes. "There is no sane middle ground," he said. "The juvenile
system can only hold someone until he is 18, but to put someone
[tried and convicted as an adult] in prison for the rest of their
life is over the top. If this were a U.S. citizen accused in a
foreign country and they were exposed to that, we'd say what an
incredibly unfair justice system they have."</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz, the former jury forewoman, said Thursday she and the
other members of the panel never dreamed a guilty verdict might lead
to a prison sentence for the King brothers.</TE>
<TE>   "We always thought that there was going to be some kind of
rehabilitation, that the boys were going to be taken somewhere where
they could have a new life and be productive citizens," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In his arguments to Schwarz and the other jurors, Rimmer had urged
them to ignore the brothers' angelic appearance, and read a letter
Alex King had written to his father that accused him of mental abuse
and referred to their home as a prison.</TE>
<TE>   Two other Florida teenagers were convicted of murder as adults and
sentenced last year to long prison terms: Lionel Tate to life without
parole and Nathaniel Brazill to 28 years.</TE>

<HD>Bush Helps Out Brother in Florida</HD>
<DH>Visits there and to Georgia enhance coffers of GOP
candidates, who are in tight races.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>ATLANTA -- President Bush campaigned Thursday for two Republican
upstarts in Georgia -- one seeking to unseat an incumbent governor,
the other hoping to oust a sitting senator -- then traveled to
Florida to help his younger brother's bid for another gubernatorial
term.</LD>
<LD>   With control of the House and Senate at stake in the Nov. 5
elections, the president plunged with relish into the final campaign
"sprint" that is expected to take him coast to coast in the next 2
1/2 weeks.</LD>
<LD>   During his stop in Atlanta, Bush spoke at an $800,000 luncheon to
benefit Rep. Saxby Chambliss, the GOP Senate candidate, and former
state Sen. Sonny Perdue, the gubernatorial candidate.</LD>
<TE>   Georgia's closely contested Senate race has turned nasty, replete
with a Chambliss advertisement that, in criticizing his opponent,
Democratic Sen. Max Cleland, features photographs of Osama bin Laden
and Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Chambliss, who chairs the House subcommittee on terrorism and
homeland security, used those images to attack Cleland's opposition
to Bush's proposal to create a Department of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   Like most Democrats, Cleland supports the agency's creation, but
only if its employees are accorded certain labor rights. The dispute
has stalled the legislation, which the Republican-controlled House
has passed.</TE>
<TE>   The ad outraged Democrats, in part because Cleland is a decorated
Vietnam veteran who lost both legs and one arm during that war.</TE>
<TE>   Cleland issued a furious rebuttal. "Accusing me of being soft on
homeland defense and Osama bin Laden is the most vicious exploitation
of a national tragedy and attempt at character assassination I have
ever witnessed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Chambliss campaign has since altered the ad to remove the
images of Bin Laden and Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   In the gubernatorial contest, Perdue desperately needed the cash
infusion provided by the Bush visit. His campaign coffers had just
$450,000 at the end of last month, compared with $7.5 million for
Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes.</TE>
<TE>   Chambliss has reported $1.76 million in campaign funds, to
Cleland's $203,086. But a Cleland spokesman said the campaign already
has paid for its television ads up to election day.</TE>
<TE>   In both races, the Democratic candidates are slightly ahead in the
latest polls.</TE>
<TE>   During his brief remarks in Atlanta, Bush refrained from making
any overtly partisan remarks. But he did remind his audience that
Chambliss had voted to create the homeland security agency, which
would coordinate the domestic fight against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question in my mind, if Saxby Chambliss were in the
Senate, I would not have to worry about his leadership or his vote on
this important matter," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The president went on to New Smyrna Beach, Fla., where,
accompanied by his brother, Jeb, he delivered a speech on education.</TE>
<TE>   Jeb Bush is locked in a neck-and-neck race with Democrat Bill
McBride, who has made education a key campaign issue and just
launched a television ad attacking the governor's record on
education.</TE>
<TE>   Jeb Bush introduced his brother as "America's first advocate" for
reading and education. The president returned the favor, saying that
his passion for the subject is "shared by your governor."</TE>
<TE>   After the public function at Reed-Patillo Elementary School, the
brothers attended a $900,000 fund-raiser for the Florida Republican
Party at a residence in Daytona Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters were barred from the event.</TE>

<HD>Review of Cheney Files Incomplete</HD>
<DH>U.S. lawyers say they have not finished study of documents
from vice president's energy task force. Judge calls it 'startling
revelation.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Government attorneys admitted Thursday they haven't completely
reviewed documents from Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task
force, despite claiming that they "all involve sensitive
communications between and among the president and his closest
advisors" that should be kept secret.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ordered task force documents to
be made public by Nov. 5 and said he was shocked the Justice
Department attorneys had not examined all the documents after
asserting for more than a year that each of them involved
confidential information.</LD>
<LD>   "That is a startling revelation," Sullivan said, after rejecting
the Bush administration's claim that he lacks authority to order the
papers' release.</LD>
<TE>   The judge directed the government attorneys to either produce the
documents or supply a list of each one being withheld, and an
explanation of why it is so sensitive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like everyone else has to do," Sullivan said in explaining
why the task force should have to provide papers on its inner
workings. Sullivan said his intent was "to carve out a middle ground
because obviously the battle lines have been drawn."</TE>
<TE>   The judge said he wanted the documents or the list by Nov. 5 --
election day -- but gave the government an opportunity to first file
objections.</TE>
<TE>   He set another hearing for Oct. 31 but said that a federal appeals
court may end up deciding the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Shannen W. Coffin, a deputy assistant attorney general, said
attorneys for the White House "haven't completed a document review"
and that "we're not going to ask our clients to complete the review"
because doing so would be "too burdensome."</TE>
<TE>   Sharply questioned by the judge, Coffin tried several times to
explain himself more fully, then said he had misspoken.</TE>
<TE>   "We have done a review. We haven't completed it," he said finally.
"We haven't done everything necessary for a [document] production."</TE>
<TE>   In court papers the Justice Department handed out at Thursday's
hearing, the government asserts that the task force documents involve
"sensitive deliberations at the highest levels of the executive
branch, including presumptively privileged presidential
communications."</TE>

<HD>Einhorn Guilty of Murdering His Ex-Girlfriend</HD>
<DH>Jury finds hippie guru bludgeoned Holly Maddux to death in
September 1977. He gets life sentence and harsh words from judge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John J. Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>A jury took less than three hours Thursday to find Ira Einhorn guilty
of murdering his former girlfriend and hiding her body in a trunk,
ending a long struggle to bring the onetime counterculture guru to
justice.</LD>
<LD>   Einhorn stood flanked by his lawyers and swallowed hard when the
verdict was announced. He declined when the judge gave him an
opportunity to speak.</LD>
<LD>   "The sentence of this court is you be remanded to the prison
system for the rest of your life," said Judge William J. Mazzola. He
delivered a scathing critique of Einhorn, who fled Philadelphia on
the eve of his trial in 1981 for bludgeoning 30-year-old Helen
"Holly" Maddux to death in September 1977.</LD>
<TE>   Mazzola called Einhorn "an intellectual dilettante who preyed on
the uninitiated, uninformed, unsuspecting and inexperienced people."</TE>
<TE>   The judge pictured him as a "pseudo-classist" and "someone who
buys a book and reads the first and last chapter ... and gives the
implication he is drowning in insight."</TE>
<TE>   After guards took Einhorn away, Mazzola permitted the jury to
reenter the courtroom to answer questions from reporters.</TE>
<TE>   One juror, echoing the sentiment of the other five men and six
women on the panel, offered a harsher evaluation of Einhorn. "He had
a warped mind on life. You can't say it any plainer. He thought he
was God," Tracy Garett said.</TE>
<TE>   "I am still mad he was able to have a trial without the death
penalty," Garett added.</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn was discovered in France living in a comfortable farmhouse
under the alias Eugene Mallon.</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn was returned to the United States in 2001, after
prosecutors assured French authorities that he would be retried and
would not face the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn had been tried in absentia in 1993, and was convicted and
sentenced to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn's lead attorney, William T. Cannon, said his client would
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The 18-day trial, which moved faster than lawyers anticipated,
provided a brief window into the Age of Aquarius and the pre-AIDS
'70s, when Einhorn was a Philadelphia hippie celebrity with a talent
for picking up women, writing voluminous diaries, and, witnesses
testified, inflating his resume.</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn, who called himself the Prince of Flower Power, was
accused of killing Maddux after she ended their sometimes-turbulent
five-year relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors pictured the case as a classic example of domestic
violence and jealousy.</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn's defense presented a different theory: That some agency,
perhaps the CIA or another intelligence service, had placed Maddux's
mummified body in a locked trunk in a locked closet in Einhorn's
apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the closet were boxes containing Maddux's clothing and a
cloth purse with her driver's license, Social Security card and other
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecution witnesses testified that after Maddux told Einhorn she
had found another boyfriend, he threatened to throw her belongings
into the street. She then traveled to Einhorn's apartment in
Philadelphia to retrieve her possessions.</TE>
<TE>   When Maddux failed to contact her parents or sisters, family
members hired private detectives to find her.</TE>
<TE>   The investigators grew suspicious when they learned that Einhorn
had asked two friends to dump into a river a trunk he said contained
secret documents. They refused.</TE>
<TE>   On March 28, 1979, police armed with a search warrant entered the
apartment and found Maddux's mummified remains.</TE>
<TE>   In his closing argument, Cannon claimed in Common Pleas Court the
mere fact Maddux's body was found in Einhorn's apartment was "just a
piece of circumstantial evidence."</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't mean at all that Ira Einhorn is responsible for her
murder," the defense lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Joel Rosen called Cannon's claim "so laughable and so
ludicrous, it is outrageous" and told the jurors that they should be
offended.</TE>
<TE>   "If a woman wasn't brutally murdered, you would almost laugh at
it," the assistant district attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecution witnesses testified that Einhorn tried to buy a book
on how to mummify a body, and former neighbors related how distressed
they were by a foul-smelling liquid dripping into their apartment
from his closet.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the strongest evidence, jurors said, came from entries in
Einhorn's 20,000 pages of diaries that related his satisfaction after
beating and choking two other women who wanted to end relationships
with him.</TE>
<TE>   Before sentencing, Margaret Wakeman spoke briefly to the court.</TE>
<TE>   She described her slain sister -- a former cheerleader and
graduate of Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia -- as gifted and
compassionate and the "leading light of our family."</TE>
<TE>   When the proceedings were finished, Elizabeth Hall, another of
Maddux's sisters, called Einhorn "a common abuser and a common con
man."</TE>

<HD>CIA 'Plan' Helped Foil Terror Plots</HD>
<DH>Tenet discloses for first time an effort before 9/11 to
capture Bin Laden. He says 3 attacks targeting Americans were
thwarted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Drogin and Josh Meyer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a world of cloak and dagger, one of the CIA's most secret
campaigns was called simply "the Plan."</LD>
<LD>   For two years before the Sept. 11 attacks, it was the official
operational strategy that the CIA, the FBI and other U.S. agencies
jointly adopted for their clandestine -- and still largely
unsuccessful -- campaign to capture terrorist Osama bin Laden and his
chief aides.</LD>
<LD>   CIA Director George J. Tenet described "the Plan" publicly for the
first time Thursday during hearings in which he battled with
lawmakers over his agen- cy's effectiveness leading up to the Sept.
11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   He insisted that the covert war had successfully foiled a series
of previously undivulged terrorist plots against Americans at home
and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet said U.S. intelligence and law enforcement had helped thwart
three separate waves of attacks by Bin Laden's followers in Europe,
the Middle East and Asia between the fall of 1999 and Sept. 11, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   One foiled plot included the use of chemical weapons, Tenet
revealed, while others involved hijackings, kidnappings and bombings
of hotels, airports, buses and other targets.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA also helped secretly deliver 70 suspects to foreign
governments, a process known as "renditions" that human rights groups
say tacitly permits the use of torture. Among the weapons seized:
antiaircraft missiles.</TE>
<TE>   "It saved lives -- perhaps in the thousands," Tenet said of the
hitherto hidden effort. "And it prepared the field for the rapid
successes in Afghanistan last winter."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet provided the rare look at the CIA's covert counter-terrorism
war as part of his testimony before the joint congressional panel
that is investigating the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Some committee members, staffers and witnesses have sharply
criticized the CIA in previous hearings for failing to aggressively
pursue Bin Laden and his terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet also provided new details of Bin Laden's direct role in the
Sept. 11 plot. Noting that planning for the attack began three years
earlier, he added, "we understand that when one of his associates
proposed to Bin Laden that the World Trade Center be targeted by
small aircraft packed with explosives, Bin Laden reportedly suggested
using even larger planes."</TE>
<TE>   Although the CIA initially regarded Bin Laden as a financier of
terrorism, he came into focus as a more direct threat after his
support was confirmed in attacks on U.S. military forces in 1992 in
Aden, Yemen, and again the next year in Mogadishu, Somalia, Tenet
said.</TE>
<TE>   Concern intensified when the CIA learned that Al Qaeda, the terror
network started by Bin Laden, "had attempted to acquire material used
in pursuing" weapons of mass destruction and had hired a Middle
Eastern physicist to work on nuclear and chemical projects in Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA set up its "Bin Laden Issue Station," known internally as
"Alex Station," at its Virginia headquarters in 1996 after Bin Laden
moved to Afghanistan, and stepped up its effort after Bin Laden's
followers bombed two U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Tenet said, he asked for a "new comprehensive operational
plan of attack" against Bin Laden and his network. "Its priority was
plain," he said, "to capture and bring to justice Bin Laden and his
principal lieutenants."</TE>
<TE>   As part of "the Plan," the CIA made greater use of informants and
spies than in the past. Reports from such sources, known as human
intelligence, or "humint," rose from about 600 in 1998 to 900 in the
first nine months of 2001, Tenet said.</TE>
<TE>   The first fruits of the plan came in late 1999 when the CIA warned
U.S. policymakers that Bin Laden operatives planned from five to 15
attacks against U.S. and allied targets during the millennium
celebrations. Luck played a role: A plan to bomb Los Angeles
International Airport and other targets was detected when Ahmed
Ressam panicked and was arrested at the Canadian border.</TE>
<TE>   "We mounted disruption and arrest operations against terrorists in
eight countries on four continents, which also netted information
that allowed us to track down even more suspected terrorists," Tenet
said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the plots disrupted was a major terrorist cell in Jordan
that had planned to blow up a Radisson Hotel, Christian holy sites
and Israeli tour buses "and that had plans to use chemical weapons,"
Tenet said.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA has not previously claimed that Bin Laden operatives had
specific plans for chemical weapons. A former senior U.S.
counter-terrorism official said several cells were known to have
considered using industrial-strength chemicals and other means to
poison water supplies in tourist areas.</TE>
<TE>   The senior official confirmed that the CIA warnings at the time
made officials all the way up to the senior White House level
"screwed to the ceiling with fear."</TE>
<TE>   "For people working counter-terrorism prior to 9/11, the
millennium alert was a seminal event," the official said. Tenet "was
driving the train on the millennium response. He put his whole
operation on battle stations and he cashed in every chit that he
had."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and allied governments averted a second wave of potential
attacks during the Muslim Ramadan period in November and December
2000, or shortly after Al Qaeda operatives had bombed the U.S.
destroyer Cole in Yemen, killing 17 U.S. sailors, Tenet said.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorist cells planning attacks against U.S. and foreign
military and civilian targets in the Persian Gulf region were broken
up, capturing hundreds of pounds of explosives and other weapons,
including antiaircraft missiles," Tenet said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Ramadan arrests and operations "also netted proof that
some Islamic charitable organizations had been either hijacked or
created to provide support to terrorists operating in other
countries."</TE>
<TE>   The third "peak threat" period, Tenet said, was in the spring and
summer of 2001. The National Security Agency, for example, obtained
more than 30 warnings from electronic eavesdropping and other means
that "something was imminent," said Lt. Gen. Michael Hayden, the NSA
chief, who also testified before the committee.</TE>
<TE>   But none, Hayden said, contained details of the coming attacks on
New York and the Pentagon, or suggested that four passenger airplanes
would be used as weapons. Indeed, none of the intercepts
"subsequently correlated with terrorist attacks."</TE>
<TE>   The increased attention paid significant other benefits, however.
Tenet said U.S. authorities "stopped some attacks and caused the
terrorists to postpone others," as he revealed a series of covert
operations for the first time in public.</TE>
<TE>   He said the CIA helped break up another terrorist cell in Jordan
and seized a large quantity of weapons, including rockets and high
explosives. A separate operation, he said, "broke up a plan to attack
U.S. facilities in Yemen."</TE>
<TE>   In June 2001, he said, the CIA and a Middle Eastern government
arrested two Bin Laden operatives planning attacks "on U.S.
facilities in Saudi Arabia." Other CIA operations helped delay
several terror plots, he said, "including an attack against the U.S.
military in Europe."</TE>
<TE>   Another Middle Eastern government, he said, helped arrange the
detention of "a terrorist who had been directed to begin an operation
to attack" a U.S. embassy or cultural center in Europe. A separate
arrest with CIA help, he said, netted "an operative described as Bin
Laden's man in East Asia."</TE>
<TE>   A CIA handing-over of "a senior Bin Laden associate" to an unnamed
government, he said, proved critical when "information he provided
included plans to kidnap Americans in three countries and carry out
hijackings."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he added, the CIA expected much worse.</TE>
<TE>   "In the months leading up to 9/11, we were convinced Bin Laden
meant to attack Americans, meant to kill large numbers and that the
attack could be at home, abroad or both," Tenet said. "Our collection
sources 'lit up' during this tense period. They indicated that
multiple spectacular attacks were plan- ned, and that some of these
plots were in the final stages," he added.</TE>
<TE>   He said the intelligence, however, was "maddeningly short on
actionable details," such as time or place. "We considered whether Al
Qaeda was feeding us this reporting, trying to create panic through
disinformation, yet we concluded that the plots were real."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, he said, "the Plan" helped the CIA and other agencies
respond quickly after the Sept. 11 attacks, both in Afghanistan and
in rolling up terror cells around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet said authorities have arrested 3,000 suspects around the
world, far more than previously disclosed. The arrests have provided
"real-time intelligence collection [that] is an order of magnitude
different than it was before 9/11," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he ended with a warning. "Based on what we have learned about
the 11 September plot, an attempt to conduct another attack on U.S.
soil is certain," he said. "Even with the increased government and
public vigilance ... the danger is still great."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>The widow of a man who died after almost 10 months with an artificial
heart has filed suit against the maker of the device and the hospital
where it was implanted, saying her husband wasn't adequately informed
of the ordeal he would have to endure.</LD>
<LD>   James Quinn, who died Aug. 26 after a stroke, came to regret
taking part in the trial of the self-contained heart and had talked
about suing several months before his death, said his attorney, Alan
Milstein.</LD>
<LD>   Milstein said Quinn, 52, told him, "No human being should have to
go through what I'm going through."</LD>
<TE>   Rather than physical pain, Milstein said, "I think he was
referring more to just the act of being an experimental subject, the
prodding and the probing and the feeling that you were just an
object."</TE>
<TE>   But the suit, which seeks damages in excess of $100,000, also says
shortly before his death Quinn could barely breathe "and was in
constant, unbearable pain."</TE>
<TE>   A Hahnemann University Hospital spokeswoman had no comment on the
lawsuit.</TE>

<HD>Senate Clashes Mount Over Homeland Security Bill</HD>
<DH>The impasse persists as Democrats and Republicans argue
over management and union issues. Passage before elections seems
unlikely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Once considered almost unstoppable, a sweeping proposal
to reshape the federal government to help combat terrorism has lost
its aura of inevitability and could die this year amid partisan
warfare in Congress.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, senior Senate Democrats and Republicans again clashed
publicly over remaining disputes in legislation that would create a
department of homeland security.</LD>
<LD>   The continuing impasse centers on labor and personnel issues
within the proposed agency, with Republicans wanting more power for
management and Democrats wanting to preserve union rights.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, a bill once embraced by Republican and Democratic
congressional leaders is stuck in limbo, more than six weeks after
the Senate began to debate it and more than four months after
President Bush proposed it.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would shift all or part of 22 federal agencies into one
Cabinet superagency with roughly 170,000 employees, responsible for,
among many functions, securing airports, seaports and borders.</TE>
<TE>   Backers say the reorganization, which would be the most
significant since the modern Defense Department was started more than
50 years ago, would help focus the government's now-splintered
response to threats exposed by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But with little more than two weeks left before the Nov. 5
elections and Republicans and Democrats fighting for control of
Congress, chances are fading that the Senate will pass the bill
before the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Some advocates hold out hope for passage in a lame-duck session,
but that too is iffy. Further talks on a possible compromise still
are likely to prove difficult.</TE>
<TE>   And both parties will be looking ahead to the start of the next
Congress in January.</TE>
<TE>   If the legislation is not enacted before then, it will leave
little more than a legislative record as epitaph: proposed by Bush,
passed the House, died in the Senate. R.I.P.</TE>
<TE>   Finger-pointing has already begun on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers are
anxious to dodge blame for failing to act on homeland security, after
last year's terrorist attacks awakened the public to previously
little-noticed vulnerabilities.</TE>
<TE>   In the House, which passed its version of a homeland security bill
in late July, 295 to 132, Republican leaders taunt their Senate
counterparts for failing to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   "Al Qaeda doesn't have a Senate," said House Majority Leader Dick
Armey (R-Texas), referring to the terrorist organization.</TE>
<TE>   Within the Senate, each party accuses the other of stifling
compromise.</TE>
<TE>   In a sharp exchange on the Senate floor Thursday, Majority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) noted that his party had urged the
administration to create a new domestic security agency months before
Bush announced his proposal on June 6 in a nationally televised
speech.</TE>
<TE>   Now, after Republicans had repeatedly thwarted his efforts to
force action on a version Democrats favor, Daschle accused the GOP of
torpedoing the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a Republican filibuster, plain and simple," Daschle said.
"Democrats want to finish this bill ... but the other side would
rather have an issue."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) replied that Democrats had refused to
take any steps that would cross their allies in government employee
unions.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, he said, believe voters will support the president's
demand for greater management powers to fight terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to pass a homeland security bill, and Americans
are going to the polls, and they're going to make a decision," Gramm
said.</TE>
<TE>   At issue in the dispute are arcane points of federal personnel
policy that may elude many Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The House-passed bill would preserve an authority presidents have
held since the Carter administration to dissolve collective
bargaining agreements in government agencies when a national security
matter is at stake. It also would allow the president to draw up new
civil service rules in several areas, giving him more leeway than he
would otherwise have to hire, fire, promote, demote, deploy and
classify employees.</TE>
<TE>   Gramm and most Republicans, allied with a lone Democrat, Sen. Zell
Miller of Georgia, are fighting to keep the Senate at or near the
House position.</TE>
<TE>   But most Democrats, joined by a breakaway Republican, Sen. Lincoln
Chafee of Rhode Island, have lined up behind an alternative.</TE>
<TE>   It would force the president to make certain findings about the
terrorism-fighting role of employees within the department before he
could use his national security authority to dissolve collective
bargaining agreements.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic position also would grant Bush some of the
flexibility he seeks in civil service rule making, but would force
him to consult with unions first. Disputes could be appealed to a
presidentially appointed mediation board.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has continually slammed Democrats for opposing him. In a
speech in Atlanta on Thursday for Georgia Republicans, he said: "The
Senate debate revolves around whether or not there ought to be a
thick book of rules micromanaging the process."</TE>
<TE>   The president repeated his pledge not to accept "a bill that will
tie the hands of this president and future presidents."</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators have tried for weeks to bridge the gap.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) said he was still working on a possible
compromise with Tom Ridge, White House homeland security director. "I
don't think we ought to count the bill dead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Nelson acknowledged that the measure is in jeopardy. Noting
the momentum it once enjoyed, he added: "The question is, what
happened?"</TE>

<HD>Panel OKs Terrorism Insurance Bill</HD>
<DH>Under the measure, the government would become the insurer
of last resort for damage exceeding $10 billion, up to $100 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A tentative agreement on long-stalled legislation that
would provide a federal safety net to the insurance industry for
future terrorist attacks was reached Thursday between key
congressional negotiators and the White House.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement would usher in another major government program --
the second after an airline industry bailout -- that seeks to aid an
industry from the economic fallout of last year's attacks. Supporters
of the measure say it is just as critical to the nation's security as
air marshals, new controls on the border and surveillance cameras at
dams.</LD>
<LD>   Under the bill, the government over the next three years would
become the insurer of last resort for any damage caused by a
terrorist attack exceeding $10 billion, up to $100 billion.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush has repeatedly beseeched Congress to pass a
terrorism insurance bill, casting the issue as an economic stimulus
measure. The unavailability of terrorism insurance since Sept. 11,
2001 -- or the high cost of it -- has made it difficult for
businesses to get financing for projects.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has said that the bill would allow construction projects
around the county to move ahead, providing 300,000 or more jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe we've got an agreement," Sen. Christopher J. Dodd
(D-Conn.), a lead Senate negotiator, said Thursday. "We're on the
brink of doing something very worthwhile in the closing hours of this
Congress."</TE>
<TE>   White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan added that the
administration is "very pleased that Congress is making progress
toward reaching a final agreement" on a terrorism insurance bill.</TE>
<TE>   All of the House-Senate negotiators still must formally approve
the agreement, which would pave the way for passage from the full
House and Senate. One of the negotiators still could snag the accord.
But a top Republican involved in the talks, Rep. Michael G. Oxley of
Ohio, said: "In any conference agreement, everyone must compromise,
and that is what we have done here."</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear how soon the measure could be brought before the
House and Senate for approval, but it may not be until after the
November election.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance industry expects to be able to pay the estimated $40
billion to $50 billion in claims stemming from last year's terrorist
attacks. But industry officials have said they cannot insure against
the incalculable liability from future attacks without government
assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses from builders and mortgage bankers to hotels and sports
teams lobbied for the bill, contending that the unavailability or
high cost of terrorism insurance has stalled more than $15 billion in
projects.</TE>
<TE>   After last year's attacks, insurance companies stopped writing
terrorist insurance or dramatically raised premiums, especially for
tenants of high-profile landmarks such as sports arenas and
skyscrapers. Of those who could get insurance, many faced caps on
their coverage, high deductibles, exclusions for chemical and
biological attacks or premium increases of as much as 200%, industry
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the measure, insurance companies would be responsible for
paying out a certain amount in claims -- a deductible -- before
federal assistance becomes available. For losses above a company's
deductible, the federal government would cover 90%, while the company
would contribute 10%.</TE>
<TE>   The industry would be required to repay the government -- through
a surcharge on policy holders -- up to $10 billion for the first
year, $12.5 billion for the second and $15 billion for the third year
of the program.</TE>
<TE>   Losses would be capped at $100 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Some consumer and taxpayer groups questioned whether the bill was
needed.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no crisis in the terrorism insurance business," said
Jill Lancelot, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Torres, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, added that
the bill would force American consumers to underwrite the losses of
the insurance, real estate, and construction industries.</TE>
<TE>   "While those industries get a substantial financial benefit, they
would not have to mitigate potential losses or address possible
threats by taking appropriate precautions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dodd disagreed. "This is anything but a bailout," he said. "All I
hear from are policy holders -- people who can't get [terrorism
insurance] at any price ... Business cannot function if you cannot
get insurance. If you cannot get insurance, banks don't provide
money. If banks don't provide money, projects don't move."</TE>
<TE>   The bill had been stalled for months because of a dispute mainly
over one issue: whether individuals injured in a terrorist attack
should be permitted to sue firms for punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans wanted to prohibit such suits, contending they would
be tantamount to a second attack on a victim of terrorism. And Bush
accused Democrats of doing the bidding of trial lawyers in opposing
the ban.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats countered that without the threat of punitive damages,
businesses would not take precautions to protect workers.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the administration agreed to drop its demands for a
ban.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed that there are not additional protections on
the liability front against abusive suits, but what is in the bill is
good and an improvement over the process," said the administration
official.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman for the American Insurance Assn.,
said the organization has yet to see details of the measure.</TE>

<HD>CIA Director Defends Agency at 9/11 Hearing</HD>
<DH>Lawmakers criticize Tenet and FBI's Mueller over missing
warnings about terrorists before the attacks. New alerts also are
raised.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Miller and Josh Meyer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A defiant CIA Director George J. Tenet sparred with lawmakers
Thursday in his first public response to a year of mounting criticism
over pre-Sept. 11 intelligence efforts. He rebuffed attempts to cut
his testimony short, shifted blame to budget-cutting policymakers and
revealed a new list of terrorist plots his agency had foiled before
last fall's attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet also warned that Al Qaeda remains a serious threat to the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   "The threat environment we find ourselves in today is as bad as it
was last summer, the summer before 9/11," Tenet told lawmakers.
Recent attacks in Yemen, Kuwait and Indonesia show that Al Qaeda has
"reconstituted, they are coming after us, they want to execute
attacks."</LD>
<TE>   He singled out Los Angeles International Airport, saying that Al
Qaeda has a history of revisiting targets. He added that a disrupted
plot to detonate a bomb at the airport around New Year's 1999
probably has "only been delayed."</TE>
<TE>   The day's congressional proceedings also produced a wealth of new
and embarrassing information about the FBI's mishandling of terrorist
threats in the years before Sept. 11, including several warnings
about aviation-related plots that apparently went unheeded.</TE>
<TE>   In a hearing marked by hostile exchanges, Tenet said his agency
was engaged in an aggressive campaign against Al Qaeda long before
last year's attacks and that his agency's work has saved thousands of
lives.</TE>
<TE>   After being pressured twice to cut short his hour-long opening
statement, Tenet refused to relent, telling lawmakers, "I've been
waiting a year" to tell the CIA's side of the story.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's testimony was in large part a pent-up reply to months of
damaging disclosures about CIA and FBI failures to heed persistent
warnings about a Sept. 11-style attack and bungled opportunities to
uncover the plot. Tenet appeared alongside FBI Director Robert S.
Mueller III and Lt. Gen. Michael V. Hayden, director of the National
Security Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Their appearance was the culmination of a month of public hearings
held by lawmakers overseeing an ongoing congressional investigation
into intelligence breakdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet, Mueller and Hayden seized the opportunity to answer
criticism and defend legions of employees they portrayed as
heroically dedicated but ill-equipped and overworked.</TE>
<TE>   The directors' testimony did not appear to sway key lawmakers, who
seem increasingly skeptical of agency excuses and appear to be losing
patience with Tenet in particular.</TE>
<TE>   At one point during the hearing, Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.)
peppered Tenet and Mueller with questions about their agencies'
failures to act on information that would have allowed authorities to
intercept two of the Sept. 11 hijackers long before the attacks. The
CIA had identified the men, Nawaf Al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, as
Al Qaeda figures at least 18 months before the attacks. The agency
failed to notify the FBI or put the men on terrorism "watch lists"
even after the CIA learned they held U.S. visas and had entered the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Levin expressed outrage after Tenet and Mueller could not produce
the names of employees involved in some of the mishaps and admitted
that no employee at either agency has been disciplined or fired for
any Sept. 11-related failure.</TE>
<TE>   "People who failed in their responsibilities have got to be held
accountable," Levin said. "You don't even know the names of people
who were responsible for failures."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet scoffed at the suggestion, saying that one employee involved
in the watch list matter is a top performer who had inadequate
training. "She's a real hero in this story," he said, "and the notion
that I'm going to take her out and shoot her is about the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard."</TE>
<TE>   During a break in the hearing, Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.)
said the lack of accountability in the agency "starts at the top.
Director Tenet certainly has not stepped up and assumed
responsibility for any of the failures that have happened on his
watch, and there are many."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet is under particular pressure in the investigation because he
has been director at the CIA for more than five years, and therefore
is among the few Bush administration figures responsible for
decisions regarding Al Qaeda dating back to the late 1990s, when
Osama bin Laden was recognized as a potent enemy of the United
States. Mueller, by contrast, was named FBI director just days before
the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet acknowledged that the agency "made mistakes" leading up to
Sept. 11 but has steadfastly refused to say the attacks were an
intelligence failure. "The record will show a keen awareness of the
threat, a disciplined focus and persistent efforts to ... bring to
justice Bin Laden and his lieutenants," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the months before Sept. 11, there was an avalanche of
intelligence suggesting that Al Qaeda was planning a major attack,
Tenet said, but it was "maddeningly short on actionable details."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet spent much of the hearing seeking to redirect blame toward
Congress and, without saying so explicitly, the Clinton
administration. He complained that the agency's efforts were
undermined by short-sighted budget cuts in the 1990s and timid
policies that kept the United States from destroying Al Qaeda's
training camps in Afghanistan before it was too late.</TE>
<TE>   With the end of the Cold War, Tenet said, budget cuts eliminated
nearly one in four CIA positions. "This loss of manpower was
devastating," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several lawmakers dismissed that line of argument. "It's not
enough to say that we do not have enough money or enough people,"
said Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), the ranking Democrat on the
House Intelligence Committee. "No one does. It's always the case."</TE>
<TE>   A report released Thursday by the congressional joint inquiry
staff pinned several Sept. 11 failures on the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the agency received reports that a terrorist organization
planned to bring students to the United States to study aviation, and
that a member of the group had frequently expressed an intention to
target civil aviation in the United States, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet another terrorist organization, in 1999, allegedly wanted to
do the same thing," it added. That 1999 alert was serious enough to
trigger a request from FBI headquarters to 24 of the FBI's 56 field
offices to investigate "and determine the level of the threat."</TE>
<TE>   "To date, our review has found that the field offices conducted
little to no investigation in response to that request," said the
report. It offered no details of which terrorist organization was
suspected of sending members to the United States in either of those
cases, but it said the FBI essentially did nothing about either of
them.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials had no comment Thursday. But in his lengthy
testimony, Mueller responded that his agents did all they could to
investigate terrorist threats, but that they were overwhelmed by work
and undercut by ineffective technology.</TE>
<TE>   In its report, the congressional staff said the FBI's electronic
communication system was so bad that many such memos seeking
assistance never reached their intended recipients, including the
heads of specialized units at FBI headquarters responsible for
tracking Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The report also said it found that the FBI recently determined
that it has 68,000 "outstanding and unassigned leads" assigned to its
counter-terrorism division that date to 1995.</TE>
<TE>   There was also new information about the so-called Phoenix memo in
which an Arizona FBI agent warned headquarters, to no avail, that
terrorists might be training at U.S. flight schools. The staff's
report said the memo mentioned the possibility that "there was a
coordinated effort underway by Osama bin Laden to send students to
the United States for civil aviation-related training." Mueller
acknowledged Thursday that three of 10 men named in the memo still
are under investigation for possible connections to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The memo's author, FBI Agent Kenneth Williams, also said he
believed Bin Laden had sent a top operative to Phoenix to set up a
terrorist sleeper cell in the 1980s, and that "this network is still
in place."</TE>
<TE>   The report also contains new information suggesting that the FBI
should have been quicker to focus on Zacarias Moussaoui, suspected of
being the intended 20th hijacker but arrested in Minnesota before the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Based on Moussaoui's "possession of weapons and his preparation
through physical training for violent confrontation," an FBI agent in
Minneapolis warned, the field office believed that Moussaoui, a
roommate named Hussein al-Attas and "others yet unknown" were
conspiring to seize control of an airplane.</TE>

<HD>Sniper Turns Fall Into 'Lost Season' for Young People</HD>
<DH>October is not just any month for teens, it's the month.
That ended when killings began.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Faye Fiore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Va.</DL>
<LD>Around here, the annual Cub Scout bonfire has become a rite of fall.
Dads stoke the flames until they crackle and roar. Little boys huddle
under blankets and sing. Marshmallows sometimes catch fire right on
the stick. And storytellers weave ghost tales made all the spookier
by the dark woods around them.</LD>
<LD>   Now, though, the woods are scary for another reason: a roving
sniper who has killed nine people and wounded two in 16 days of
terror. So tonight, the Scouts in this Northern Virginia suburb will
move the ritual inside a church recreation hall -- their fire
becoming an illusion of red streamers and lights, their flashlights
illuminating the cold linoleum floor, the marshmallows for s'mores
melting in a microwave.</LD>
<LD>   "I always ask the kids at the end of the year what their favorite
event was and the bonfire is always near the top," said Steven
Knizer, a scoutmaster in Arlington. "Now we just have to rig
something up. It's terrible."</LD>
<TE>   Fear has gripped all that was once ordinary here; Arlington was
home to the 47-year-old FBI analyst who was shot dead in the parking
lot of a Home Depot this week. From filling a gas tank to walking the
dog, it may have fallen hardest on the children -- who woke up one
day to find huge chunks of their lives canceled, contained or made
tedious by the fact that they cannot go outside.</TE>
<TE>   Outdoor recess is a dimming memory. Football games, soccer matches
and track meets are suspended. College recruiters have no game films
to watch. Scholarships are in jeopardy. Pep rallies have moved into
the gym. Cross-country runners sprint in the hallways. Cafeterias are
packed with students who would otherwise leave campus for lunch. Even
once-inviolate safety rules are in question as administrators weigh
one threat against another; for now, fire drills are considered a
more immediate danger than a fire.</TE>
<TE>   For young people, this is shaping up to be the Lost Season.
October is not just any month in a high-schooler's year, it is the
month. Marching bands compete, homecoming queens are crowned. It is
the reason some kids sacrifice their last month of summer traipsing
around a scorched field with tubas on their backs or running wind
sprints in the heat.</TE>
<TE>   All of that seems wasted now. The mood at Yorktown High School
here is typical of most schools in the area, where students have been
under security lockdown almost daily since Oct. 2, when the killings
began.</TE>
<TE>   The football team grunts and yells with a diminished sense of
purpose at afternoon practice held in the lobby outside the
auditorium. Last year the Patriots were the district champs. This
year, the season effectively ended Oct. 5, until further notice. They
could finish a humiliating 1-4.</TE>
<TE>   "It's horrible," said senior Brett Merkel, 17, the Patriots'
co-captain. He's been playing football since he was 7, a defensive
end. Football could be his ticket to an Ivy League education, if he
gets the chance to show the college scouts what he can do. "This year
I played decently but I didn't do anything amazing. But every game it
seemed like I was getting better. Just one amazing play would open up
my college options -- huge."</TE>
<TE>   The marching band is no better off. The musicians spent a week
last summer at a Pennsylvania academy memorizing a halftime show they
never had much chance to perform. It takes as much as 25 hours to
learn one page of music and footwork and they learned 50 pages -- all
of it leading up to this weekend's state marching band festival in
Charlottesville.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the district waived the field trip ban and granted
them permission to travel. But they'll have to stand still to play.</TE>
<TE>   "Two weeks ago we died -- everything stopped. We can't remember
all the moves. So they'll be judged by their music alone," said
Timothy Niebergall, the school's director of bands. "This was
supposed to be our ultimate experience. A lot of the kids are
disappointed. The group is dissipating slowly but surely."</TE>
<TE>   For adults the anxiety is palpable; some have even taken to
walking a zig-zag pattern for distances greater than 20 feet. But the
children talk more of frustration than fear.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are a senior, you can leave for lunch, that's one of the
things you get to do as a senior. But we can't," Danielle Oulin, 17,
complained. "People are guarding the door. It's boring, it's tedious,
you have to stay here and you can't do anything."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, daily routines have changed in measurable ways -- so many
students are staying on campus that food service sales are up 80%,
district officials report. And there is no end in sight as some
parents and teachers question how much longer the lockdown can
continue.</TE>
<TE>   Looming in their thoughts is a police investigation that, publicly
at least, does not seem to be making much progress. District
superintendents are looking for ways to salvage the year, including
moving sporting events out of the county or centralizing them on one
highly secured field where teams take turns playing.</TE>
<TE>   Experts in art, health and physical education are brainstorming
alternatives "to assist teachers who may have exhausted their
repertoire of indoor activities," Supt. Jerry D. Weast of Montgomery
County (Md.) Public Schools wrote in a memo this week.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, teachers have been stretched to their creative limits. At
one elementary school in Montgomery County, where the killings began,
the children enter and exit through alternate doors; the little ones
think it's a "secret passage," but the older ones know better.</TE>
<TE>   First-graders made paper hats one day and marched in an impromptu
parade, blowing whistles through the halls of one Arlington school.
Kindergartners embarked on a hunt for a gingerbread man and ate the
spoils. Parents bake cookies, send videos and volunteer to tell
stories. Some in the younger grades still know nothing of a sniper,
believing it's disease-carrying mosquitoes that have made outside a
dangerous place.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a challenge for the teachers. They have students
eating in the classrooms with them, they are on duty much more," said
Janice Siegel, a psychologist with Arlington Public Schools.</TE>
<TE>   Even beyond school, children feel the strain in the community at
large. Some parents forbid outdoor play. Police once available to
demonstrate bicycle safety can no longer be spared. Fall festivals
that raise money for some PTAs are scuttled. And the Cub Scouts'
annual food drive is in jeopardy, an effort that last year collected
57,000 pounds of goods for the Arlington food bank -- a six-month
supply.</TE>
<TE>   For some, life has been altered in a way that cannot be
recaptured.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night's homecoming game at Wakefield High is off, so
instead of riding in a convertible across the football field under
the bright lights at halftime, the king and queen will be crowned
tonight at a pep rally in a sweaty gym.</TE>
<TE>   The words "there's always next year," are irrelevant for a
graduating senior and of little consolation to teenagers accustomed
to living in the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think an adolescent mind operates that far into the
future," said Niebergall, the band director. "Maybe that's just
Mother Nature's way of insulating them. Someday, though, they'll
think back and realize what was lost."</TE>

<HD>9/11 Memorial Finalists Unveiled</HD>
<DH>The six proposals for the display at the Pentagon evoke
elements of the Vietnam memorial. All include the names of the 184
victims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Dewy glass walls and the infinite sky could be components of a
memorial to victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the Pentagon, according
to a panel that unveiled six finalists Thursday in the competition to
design the monument.</LD>
<LD>   Inspired by the ripple effect of the tragedy and the location of
the site -- across the Potomac River in Arlington, Va., under the
flight path of American Airlines Flight 77 -- the finalists used
metaphors and aesthetics that evoked elements of the haunting Vietnam
Veterans memorial.</LD>
<LD>   "We began to realize what a powerful effect or influence the
Vietnam memorial had on our thinking," said jury member Terence
Riley, chief curator of the department of architecture and design at
New York City's Museum of Modern Art. "It has changed everyone's
thinking about what a memorial is."</LD>
<TE>   The Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall, designed by Maya Lin, is a
V-shaped wall engraved with the names of the 58,209 Americans who
died during the war.</TE>
<TE>   It is designed to resemble healing, outstretched arms, and Lin
hoped that visitors would find a place of quiet reflection. Mourners
are frequently seen making rubbings of the inscribed names.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the final six Pentagon memorial designs, chosen from
1,126 entries, sought interaction between visitors and the monument.
Like the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Pentagon memorial would be
inscribed with the names of all 184 victims.</TE>
<TE>   One design, by Jean Koeppel of Brooklyn, N.Y., features a pool
from which water would condense onto 184 glass monoliths perched over
it, giving visitors ephemeral spots to rub messages into the dew.</TE>
<TE>   Another, by Mason Wickham, also of Brooklyn, is a communal table
surrounded by a walled garden. The table is lined with 184 benches on
which visitors could sit.</TE>
<TE>   In a third design, the visitors themselves would be the monument.
Designed by Michael Meredith of Clifton Park, N.Y., the memorial
would be a pedestal angled toward the Pentagon, set amid cherry trees
and benches. The design "leaves the memorial unfinished, only to be
completed by those who visit and stand upon it," Meredith wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Still another features 184 benches perched over lighted reflecting
pools, designed by Julie Beckman of New York City. A fifth, designed
by Shane Williamson of Toronto, proposes a structure of alternating
blocks representing the lives lost and voids representing the world's
loss.</TE>
<TE>   The sixth entry, designed by Jacky Bowring of Canterbury, New
Zealand, proposes 184 concrete wells of "calm water" with mirrors at
their bases and etchings chosen by the victims' families inscribed on
each top.</TE>
<TE>   Not included in any of the finalist designs is a direct view of
the Pentagon's rebuilt west-facing wall. The families of the victims,
Riley said, felt that the sight would be too disturbing. Instead, the
wall around Wickham's communal table would reflect the image of that
facade, which will stand only 165 feet from the memorial.</TE>
<TE>   The sky also plays a role in the designs. The condensation on
Koeppel's monoliths would fade the higher the glass stands over the
water, "like veils that optically disappear toward the sky."</TE>
<TE>   And backdrop of Bowring's "calm water" etchings would be the
heavens, reflected in the mirrors at the base.</TE>
<TE>   Because the attack was so personal and the loss indescribable,
Riley said, the jury picked designs that left interpretation up to
visitors. "They can kind of find in it that which they are hoping to
find," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The finalists will each be given $20,000 to further develop their
plans, and the jury aims to pick a winner around the first of the
year, said project manager Carol Anderson-Austra of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers.</TE>

<HD>Noelle Bush Gets 10-Day Jail Term</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John-Thor Dahlburg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>MIAMI -- Her hands cuffed behind her back, Noelle Bush, the
president's niece, was sent to jail Thursday to serve a 10-day
sentence for violating the terms of her court-ordered drug
rehabilitation program.</LD>
<LD>   Workers at a treatment center in Orlando allegedly found a piece
of crack cocaine last month in the heel of a shoe belonging to Bush,
25, the daughter of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.</LD>
<LD>   "I sincerely apologize for what happened," Noelle Bush told
Circuit Judge Reginald Whitehead before he found her in contempt of
court. "I promise to do well at the Center for Drug-Free Living from
now on."</LD>
<TE>   Whitehead gave Bush yet another chance to straighten out her life,
noting that she could have faced additional charges in connection
with the alleged rock cocaine discovery.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't look at the worst part of this, but look at the overall
situation," the judge told her. "You could have very easily been
charged with a new felony offense. This is a great opportunity for
you to show yourself that you can do well. You don't have to show
anybody else."</TE>
<TE>   Jeb Bush, a Republican seeking reelection against an increasingly
strong Democratic challenger, did not attend the hearing in an
Orlando courtroom, saying he did not want to prompt additional media
coverage. Noelle's uncle, President Bush, arrived in Florida later in
the day to campaign and raise money for his younger brother.</TE>
<TE>   "Words cannot express the sadness that Columba and I feel about
what has happened with our daughter Noelle today," Jeb Bush said in a
statement, speaking for himself and his wife. "Nonetheless, as
governor, but most importantly as her father, I know she must face
the consequences of her actions."</TE>
<TE>   In January, Noelle Bush was arrested in Tallahassee on a felony
charge that she used a phony prescription to try to purchase Xanax,
an anxiety drug that is taken by some cocaine users. Under Florida's
drug court program, she was enrolled at a rehabilitation center and
must complete the program to avoid prosecution on the prescription
forgery charge.</TE>
<TE>   That requirement, though, did not prevent an incident of
backsliding in July, when Bush was sent to jail for three days after
she was found with an unauthorized prescription drug.</TE>
<TE>   "I am disappointed. You let a lot of people down," the judge told
her Thursday. "What's important is, you shouldn't let yourself down."</TE>
<TE>   Randy Means, executive director of the state attorney's office in
Orlando, said prosecutors concurred with Whitehead's decision to
stake out a middle path between possible new criminal charges for
Noelle Bush and continuing the therapy to wean her off drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "The state has a lot of failure rate in these programs,
obviously," Means said. "The way to catch the attention of the person
who is failing is to put them in jail for a few days."</TE>
<TE>   According to a police report, a worker at the treatment center
gave a written statement that 0.2 grams of crack were found in Bush's
shoe on Sept. 9, but ripped up the statement when a supervisor
ordered him not to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 30, Judge Belvin Perry Jr. ruled that Bush's therapists
could not be subpoenaed about the alleged cocaine discovery, saying
federal confidentiality laws protect her as long as she resides in a
drug treatment center and is under a judge's supervision. Prosecutors
have appealed, contending that a crime is a crime, even if it occurs
in a drug treatment center, and that Bush's confidentiality as a
patient is not threatened.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think having her found with an alleged piece of rock in
her heel is a medical record, and we don't think the name of whoever
supplied it is a medical record," Means said. "We don't want to
create a nirvana [inside the rehabilitation center] for drug sellers
and users."</TE>
<TE>   Sydney Smith, a Miami criminal defense lawyer and former public
defender in Miami-Dade County, said Perry's ruling was without
precedent.</TE>
<TE>   "What a client says to a therapist, yes, in my view, that would be
privileged," Smith said. "But evidence of a crime, which in this case
was possession of cocaine, I've never heard of anyone having the
privilege to" keep that information away from authorities.</TE>
<TE>   However, Catherine O'Neill, an attorney with the New York-based
Legal Action Center, which represents people being treated for drug
and alcohol dependency, said it was important to remember why federal
laws protecting their privacy have been on the books since the early
1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "The treatment center's interest is to provide the sort of
confidentiality that will foster treatment," O'Neill said. "The key
societal interests here are, let's reduce crime, and let's promote
people's recovery from addiction."</TE>
<TE>   Some have suggested that the governor's daughter has received
special treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's the question that all Floridians should be asking: Why is
Noelle Bush sitting in a rehab center while other drug-law violators
are rotting in prison?" Steve Dasbach, executive director of the
Libertarian Party in Washington, D.C., said in a statement this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, "The Boondocks," a topical and controversial comic
strip drawn by Aaron McGruder, accused someone identified as "Jeb" of
hypocritical double standards on the drug treatment issue.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Bush has asserted that far from receiving special treatment,
his daughter has been subjected to the unforgiving and unhelpful
glare of national media attention.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to wave a magic wand and have this devil be, you know,
exorcised from her -- from her life, from her soul, so that she can
make clear decisions for herself and live an independent life and a
joyful one," he said in a television interview Tuesday. "But I can't.
She has to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Noelle Bush was joined in court by an aunt, Dorothy Koch, whom she
kissed before being handcuffed and led off to the Orange County Jail
in Orlando.</TE>

<HD>4 Illinois Men Cleared by DNA Are Pardoned</HD>
<DH>The 1986 homicide raised allegations of coerced confessions
and botched evidence even before tests on evidence from victim's
body, car.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Four men who spent years in prison before DNA evidence exonerated
them in the rape and murder of a Rush University medical student have
been pardoned by Illinois Gov. George Ryan.</LD>
<LD>   "It was very clear to him by looking at the totality of the
circumstances that there was a terrible injustice that occurred,"
Ryan spokesman Dennis Culloton said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The four -- Marcellius Bradford, Omar Saunders and cousins Calvin
Ollins and Larry Ollins -- were convicted in the 1986 death of
medical student Lori Roscetti in Chicago. Calvin Ollins was 14 at the
time, an eighth-grade special education student who could barely
read.</LD>
<TE>   The case raised allegations of coerced confessions and botched
evidence even before DNA evidence from Roscetti's body and car led to
the release of Saunders and the Ollins cousins in December. The three
had faced life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Bradford already had been released after pleading guilty in
exchange for a 12-year sentence. He says his confession was coerced.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say the new evidence linked two other men, Eddie
Harris and Duane Roach, to the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Culloton said the pardons may help secure state funding for a
lawsuit against police, the county and crime lab workers.</TE>
<TE>   Calvin Ollins, who also confessed, says he did so because police
promised to let him go in return. Chicago police have denied the
allegations.</TE>

<HD>Conferees Agree to Bill That Tightens Port Security</HD>
<DH>House-Senate team clears obstacles, backs added Coast Guard
powers, employee background checks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>House and Senate negotiators broke an impasse Thursday over a bill to
tighten security at the nation's ports, giving the Coast Guard
additional powers and requiring background checks of some port
employees and new tracking systems for commercial ships.</LD>
<LD>   The bill also requires every seaport to create a security
committee involving federal, state, local and private law enforcement
agencies.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.)
said the bill's need was underscored by the recent terrorist attack
on a French oil tanker near a Yemeni port and the economic effect of
a labor dispute at West Coast ports.</LD>
<TE>   "The dire consequences of a terrorist event at our ports -- in
human lives and economic disruption -- would be devastating,"
Hollings said. "Completion of this legislation represents a
significant step forward for the nation's security."</TE>
<TE>   The measure must be approved by the full Senate and the House,
which won't consider it until after the Nov. 5 elections.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, 2001, concerns have been raised about possible
terrorist attacks on ships containing highly flammable liquids or on
fuel farms near ports, as well as the possibility of a nuclear weapon
or other device hidden inside a container ship.</TE>
<TE>   House Transportation Committee Chairman Don Young (R-Alaska) was
especially pleased that the bill expands the Coast Guard's role, said
his spokesman, Steve Hansen.</TE>
<TE>   Young sponsored the House version of the bill, which would require
the Coast Guard to assess every U.S. port's vulnerability to
terrorism and security standards at foreign ports served by ships
that call on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Ships from ports that don't meet those standards could be barred
from entering U.S. ports, and the Coast Guard would be given new
powers to board ships to deter hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen said that the House and Senate have agreed on about 90% of
their differences.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not reached a final agreement, but things are going very
well," Hansen said. The House and Senate differ over language
requiring vessel operators to provide background information about
crews, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The House and Senate had each passed a port security bill and
worked out their main differences in conference, but couldn't agree
on how to come up with the $1.2 billion to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would fund such security measures as cargo scanning
equipment and transponders to keep track of ships.</TE>

<HD>Witness' Sniper Tale Discarded</HD>

<DL>ROCKVILLE, Md.</DL>
<LD>A witness' account of a sniper suspect in a cream-colored van, which
touched off a furious dragnet late Monday involving police
helicopters and roadblocks in two states, has been thrown out, law
enforcement officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The latest frustration in the case underscored the scant evidence
police have assembled, despite more than two weeks of shootings that
have terrorized the Washington region, leaving nine dead and two
wounded.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators Thursday could not complete a composite drawing of a
suspect or a getaway vehicle used in the most recent shooting, in
Falls Church, Va., based on available information. Police also cast
doubt on reports that a dark-skinned gunman fled the murder scene
Monday night in Northern Virginia, an account that was provided by
the discredited witness.</LD>
<TE>   But they maintained that any damage to the investigation has been
minimal. "I hope that this has not set back the investigation," said
Montgomery County Police Chief Charles A. Moose. "Reports of the van
were inaccurate, reports of an olive-skinned person were inaccurate,"
the Maryland lawman said.</TE>
<TE>   The witness, whom police declined to identify, emerged soon after
the shooting of Linda Franklin outside a Falls Church Home Depot
store.</TE>
<TE>   Just minutes after the first officers from Fairfax, Va., arrived
at the open-air parking structure where Franklin had been hit, police
began taking action based on the witness' account that an
"olive-skinned" man driving a "cream-colored" van with a silver
ladder rack on top and a burned-out left taillight had fled the
scene. The witness also told police he had seen the gunman wield an
AK-74, a .223-caliber assault rifle of Russian origin.</TE>
<TE>   Based on that initial report, Fairfax police broadcast an alert
for the suspect vehicle and driver. Officers raced into position on
major highways, bridges and other roads, all in search of the
cream-colored van.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the alerts did come from this," Fairfax Police spokeswoman
Lt. Amy Lubas said Thursday. At the same time, she added, the
erroneous lookout was one of a number of "bulletins and alerts sent
all over the place that night" by police who were fed accounts by
witnesses at the Home Depot and on the roads nearby. "Did it cripple
the investigation? No," Lubas said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators remain intensely interested in reports of a white
van, possibly a Chevrolet Astro or Ford Econoline, and task force
officials have released composite drawings of such vehicles based on
witness accounts from a shooting in Spotsylvania County, Va. Police
also have released a composite picture of a white box truck reported
by witnesses near crime scenes in Montgomery County.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of light-colored vans were stopped after the shooting
Monday night, and dark-skinned drivers were detained -- in some cases
at gunpoint -- before they were released.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Thursday they still were uncertain whether the witness
had purposely given a false report or was overcome by the emotion of
the moment. But Lubas said Fairfax police were suspicious enough of
the man's motives to launch "a secondary, separate investigation" of
his actions. Lubas declined to say what charges the man might face,
saying only that "there are a number of possibilities."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his faulty descriptions of the van and its driver,
the discredited witness also gave police a partial license plate
number that proved false, police said. But investigators received
other license plate reports they believe are credible, and those
numbers are being run through the Maryland Department of Motor
Vehicles' database, an official said.</TE>
<TE>   At a news briefing, somber-looking officials announced that the
witness account had fizzled, despite initial hopes that the careful
sniper may have left critical evidence at the Home Depot shooting
scene. Indeed, investigators were not willing to say even that the
sniper was male or female, backing off previous conclusions that the
killer is a man.</TE>
<TE>   However, Police Chief Thomas Manger of Fairfax County said
authorities are "following up on a number of leads."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also cautioned the media about naming specific types
of rifles that may have been used in the shootings because inaccurate
reports could undermine witness accounts. On Thursday, Michael
Bouchard, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
told reporters that at least 30 types of rifles can discharge bullets
of the .223 caliber that have been linked to the sniper attacks. "You
can't just go by what someone thinks it is," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials refused to divulge whether the discredited
witness was the same observer who reportedly saw a gunman firing a
rifle at Franklin from 40 yards away. Such a primary witness would be
crucial, officials said, because until the Home Depot shooting, no
one had reported seeing the gunman fire a weapon during the previous
attacks, which killed eight and wounded two.</TE>
<TE>   Lubas and Montgomery County Police Capt. Kathy Demme would not say
precisely what led investigators to question the story of the
discredited witness.</TE>
<TE>   It was only as investigators compared accounts from all of the
Home Depot eyewitnesses, a federal task force official said, that the
man's story "looked more and more shaky."</TE>
<TE>   "This guy was talked to several times until we were sure there
were too many inconsistencies," said the official, who asked not to
be identified. "It just didn't add up."</TE>
<TE>   Demme added that investigators used some of the stronger,
corroborated accounts from other observers to discredit the faulty
witness' statements.</TE>
<TE>   The chilling episode of sniper shootings began with a fatality in
suburban Maryland on the night of Oct. 2, exploding into a spree of
four fatal shootings the next day. Overall, nine people have been
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two wounded, a 13-year-old boy shot outside his middle
school in Prince George's County, Md., was upgraded Thursday from
critical to serious condition, hospital officials said. The other
surviving victim, a Virginia woman, was released from a hospital last
week.</TE>
<TE>   The sniper has not killed on weekends. The shootings have been
concentrated on weekday mornings, as people head to work and school,
and during the evenings. The scenes have tended to be near major
highways. Four people have been shot while at gas stations and two
people while loading packages into their cars.</TE>
<TE>   The victims appear to be random strangers. Each has been shot one
time by a rifle that probably could be used for military or hunting
purposes.</TE>

<HD>Heart Disease, Strokes Are Growing Global Problems</HD>
<DH>Once considered concerns mostly for the West, both killers
are becoming more common in developing nations, U.N. study says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas H. Maugh II</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Heart disease and stroke, long considered diseases of industrialized
nations, are making major inroads throughout the rest of the world as
well, killing as many as 12 million people prematurely each year,
according to the World Health Organization.</LD>
<LD>   But that death toll could be halved in as little as five years
through a combination of simple, cost-effective national actions --
such as lowering the amount of salt in processed foods and increasing
tobacco taxes -- and the widespread use of inexpensive drugs,
according to a WHO report to be issued this month.</LD>
<LD>   If such actions are not taken, the number of premature deaths will
increase 25% by 2010, the study says.</LD>
<TE>   "The world once thought of cardiovascular disease as a Western
problem, but clearly that is not the case," said Dr. Anthony Rodgers
of the University of Auckland in New Zealand, one of the report's
primary authors. "We are seeing that conditions like high blood
pressure and high cholesterol are much more prominent in developing
countries than previously thought, and contribute significantly to
their overall disease burden."</TE>
<TE>   Building on research during the last decade, the report concluded
that high blood pressure and cholesterol levels are responsible for
as much as 75% of cardiovascular disease, far higher than the
one-third to one-half previously thought.</TE>
<TE>   Obesity, inactive lifestyles, tobacco use and low fruit and
vegetable consumption are also important factors.</TE>
<TE>   High blood pressure is a particular problem.</TE>
<TE>   "The global disease burden due to blood pressure is twice as much
as was previously thought," said Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, director
general of WHO.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, 10% to 30% of adults in almost all countries suffer from
high blood pressure, the report said, and an additional 50% to 60%
would be in better health if they lowered their blood pressure. Even
small reductions in blood pressure would reduce their heart attack
and stroke risk, Rodgers said. A similar pattern occurs for
cholesterol as well, he added.</TE>
<TE>   That problem could be attacked immediately with a regimen of three
drugs: aspirin, cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins, and blood
pressure drugs called diuretics and beta-blockers. Such a regimen
could be made widely available for as little as $14 per year per
person, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   "This drug combination could cut death and disability rates from
cardiovascular disease by more than 50% among people at risk," said
Dr. Christopher Murray, executive director of WHO's Cluster on
Evidence and Information Policy. "More people at high risk for
cardiovascular disease should start taking the combination now,
before they have heart attacks and strokes."</TE>
<TE>   "Even $14 is too much for many countries now, however," Rodgers
said, and there are other approaches that should be given the highest
priority. Most critical is the reduction of fat and, especially, salt
in processed foods. Levels of both are much too high in the cheapest
foods, which are what the urban poor subsist on.</TE>
<TE>   The report notes that bread and crackers are commonly about 50% as
salty as sea water, many breakfast cereals are as salty, and soups
are often three times as salty.</TE>
<TE>   "That comparison really brought it home to me that you don't have
to eat that much to get a really high salt intake in the diet,"
Rodgers said. Most people get 75% of their salt from processed foods.</TE>
<TE>   If governments could get food manufacturers to reduce salt content
by 5% per year for five years, he said, people would never notice the
change in taste and "it could bring surprisingly large benefits
across the population."</TE>
<TE>   Rodgers cited the case of Japan which, in the late 1960s, "had
extraordinarily high levels of salt intake and the highest stroke
rates the world has ever seen." The government convinced food
processors to reduce salt levels and instituted other blood pressure
measures, and the stroke rate has dropped by 80%.</TE>
<TE>   "That's quite an extraordinary success story," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another easy way to increase cardiovascular health is to raise
tobacco taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "A $7 pack of cigarettes will go a long way toward persuading
smokers to quit and nonsmokers not to start," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Such approaches "are very inexpensive, so that even countries with
limited health budgets can implement them and cut their
cardiovascular disease rate by 50%," said Dr. Derek Yach, executive
director of WHO's Cluster on Noncommunicable Diseases and Mental
Health.</TE>
