<HD>Arson Is Suspected in Northwest</HD>
<DH>Wildfires: Officials say about 20 recent blazes have been
set in isolated areas. They appeal for the public's help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA ASHTON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>NACHES, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Arson is suspected in about 20 wildfires, most of them started in the
last two weeks, east of Mt. Rainier, federal authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just a matter of time. If it continues, we'll have a major
disaster," said Sonny O'Neal, supervisor for the Okanagon and
Wenatchee national forests.</LD>
<LD>   The largest of the wildfires, the 2,286-acre Oak Creek II fire,
burned within a mile of Tieton Middle School, 15 miles west of
Yakima, before it was contained Aug. 16. There were no injuries or
structures damaged in any of the blazes.</LD>
<TE>   All of the fires have been in Yakima and Kittitas counties, and
most of them have been in drainages along Washington 410, the
east-west route across Chinook Pass, and U.S. 12, the east-west route
across White Pass.</TE>
<TE>   The suspicious fires probably date back about a month, but most
have occurred in the last two weeks, said Paul Hart, a spokesman for
the two national forests in central Washington.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 12 fires appear to have been set in a single day, often
in areas where people would not typically go, said Gary Berndt of the
state Department of Natural Resources.</TE>
<TE>   Most have been set in the late evening or early morning, possibly
with a cigarette lighter, Berndt and O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   Two fires were started Friday. Both were snuffed out quickly,
burning less than an acre, as has been the case with most of the
other blazes.</TE>
<TE>   Arson is suspected in some of the largest fires in the West this
year. A Forest Service employee was charged with arson in the biggest
wildfire in Colorado history. She has been fired.</TE>
<TE>   In New Mexico, a federal Bureau of Indian Affairs forestry
technician has been indicted in six fires started on or near the
Mescalero Apache Reservation.</TE>
<TE>   In Arizona, a contract firefighter is accused of starting a fire
in dry grass on the Fort Apache Reservation that merged with another
blaze to become the largest wildfire in the state's history.</TE>
<TE>   And in California, a woman is accused of starting a fire in
Sequoia National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   All four deny guilt.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe one or possibly two people may be
responsible for the central Washington fires, and the possibility
that it could be a firefighter has not been ruled out, O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   A reward of up to $10,000 is being offered for information leading
to arrest and conviction in the fires, and a tip line has been
established: 800-55ARSON.</TE>

<HD>These Are Two Confident Volunteers</HD>
<DH>College football: Quarterback Clausen, receiver Washington
make a formidable, and self-assured, pair for Tennessee passing game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH A. DAVIS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>KNOXVILLE, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Ask Tennessee receiver Kelley Washington about playing with
quarterback Casey Clausen this season, and he won't even stop to
think about the answer.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to go out and be that one-two punch, probably one of
the best in the nation," Washington said.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, he sounds cocky. But Clausen, who's got a fair share of
swagger himself, doesn't mind.</LD>
<TE>   "Hey, you have to have confidence in yourself and your abilities.
It's just his personality," said Clausen, a third-year starter whose
last two top receivers are in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   And after all, Washington's predictions usually come true.</TE>
<TE>   Washington, 23, is entering his second and probably last college
season. When he walked on the team in 2001 after four years of minor
league baseball, he said he just wanted a chance to show what he
could do.</TE>
<TE>   He did.</TE>
<TE>   By the third game against LSU a year ago, Washington set a school
record with 256 yards in 11 catches, all for first downs.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great coming out party for him," Clausen said.</TE>
<TE>   He even made a habit during the season of pointing at his mother
in the stands after each touchdown. Washington explained that he
likes to "excite and electrify the crowd."</TE>
<TE>   At 6-foot-4 and 225 pounds, Washington is taller and stronger than
most defensive backs.</TE>
<TE>   He channeled his natural abilities into catching and route-running
as the season progressed, and coaches felt more comfortable moving
him into different slots. Even a sore left foot that kept him out of
practice didn't slow him down.</TE>
<TE>   There's no reason he won't be even better this year, Coach Phillip
Fulmer said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is amazing what he was able to accomplish last year with his
inexperience and injury. Hopefully we're going to have one of those
tremendous breakout years," Fulmer said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be really disappointed if he doesn't get a bunch of
footballs thrown his way this year."</TE>
<TE>   Fulmer expects big things out of Clausen this season, too.</TE>
<TE>   "Casey Clausen is ready to take off and take control of this
offensive football team," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Clausen finished last season with 2,969 yards passing, including
393 yards in Tennessee's 45-17 win over Michigan in the Citrus Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The California native with spiky blond hair was lured east by
watching Peyton Manning play. His first start as a freshman came in
2000 after the two previous starters had no spark and the Vols were
2-3.</TE>
<TE>   Even as a freshman, Clausen was so confident it scared the
coaches. Fulmer regularly jokes that his hair is grayer because of
coaching a freshman quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Clausen tested the coaches' nerves with his tendency to change the
called play at the line of scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   His first audible came against Alabama in his first start when the
Vols were down on the three-yard line and he threw a touchdown to
Cedric Wilson instead of going with the called running play.</TE>
<TE>   "In previous games we ran enough second-and-ones or
third-and-goals and kicked field goals," Clausen recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'We're not kicking a field goal.' I checked out to Ced
and threw that fade and got seven points."</TE>
<TE>   Clausen also has become a vocal team leader.</TE>
<TE>   He criticized teammates for a lack of intensity after Tennessee
lost to LSU in the SEC championship.</TE>
<TE>   A win would have sent the Vols to the Rose Bowl against Miami for
a shot at the national title.</TE>
<TE>   Over the summer, Clausen and Washington practiced together three
times a week and got to know each other better.</TE>
<TE>   Their different displays of confidence complement each other.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not the flashy type person like I am, but you know deep down
he's so confident in himself," Washington said about Clausen.</TE>
<TE>   This season, fans can expect even more flash from Washington.</TE>
<TE>   He's been practicing some dance moves. Washington promises they'll
be legal and not against the excessive celebration rules.</TE>
<TE>   "No penalties, just a lot of dancing behind the scenes. It's going
to be fun," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Clausen hasn't seen Washington's dance yet. But don't expect this
to be a duet.</TE>
<TE>   "I can dance," Clausen said. "But on the field, I won't dance."</TE>

<HD>Still Buzzing About the NBA</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Charlotte officials say town can support a
team and they continue to seek the league's next expansion franchise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNA FRYER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>For three months, the retired jersey of Bobby Phills hung alone in
the rafters of the Charlotte Coliseum, the only remaining sign that
the NBA ever existed in this city.</LD>
<LD>   When the Hornets packed up and moved to New Orleans after 14 years
in Charlotte, they left behind the tribute to Phills, a popular
player and team captain who was killed in a car accident more than
two years ago. Now it too is gone, removed recently and given to
Phills' widow.</LD>
<LD>   City leaders have moved on, too--already negotiating with the NBA
in hopes of landing an expansion team.</LD>
<TE>   The timing of the effort seems peculiar--the Hornets just left,
after all, insisting they could not survive any longer in the market.</TE>
<TE>   But city officials are adamant that the NBA can flourish in
Charlotte and the Hornets only failed because of apathy-- and
antipathy--toward owners George Shinn and Ray Wooldridge.</TE>
<TE>   "When George Shinn secured an NBA franchise against all odds, it
began the upward movement in economic prosperity and positive name
recognition for Charlotte," said Lynn Wheeler, head of the City
Council's Economic Development Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "In losing an NBA team, it's a definite black eye for Charlotte
and ultimately could produce economic hardships that we want to
avoid. Basketball can be good here, we just need a clean slate to
work with."</TE>
<TE>   Although attendance and support were down in the Hornets' final
two seasons, there's no doubt Charlotte was at one time a fertile
basketball market.</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets led the league in attendance for seven years in their
leanest times. Fans gave players a standing ovation following a
40-point loss in their first game and a parade at the end of that
long, losing season.</TE>
<TE>   But fans eventually tired of Shinn allowing top players to leave
via free agency. And when he was sued on a sexual assault accusation,
they tuned out permanently, even though he won the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Charlotte, for a long time, was a very strong basketball market,"
said NBA Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik. "The thought is that it can
be once again, given the right circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   So the city and the league are working on those circumstances and
have apparently put their efforts on the fast track.</TE>
<TE>   At least three groups have expressed interest in owning an
expansion team in Charlotte. The NBA is trying to decide first
whether the city is ready.</TE>
<TE>   City manager Pam Syfert has met with NBA officials once and plans
another meeting soon. Dates and locations are kept secret in an
attempt to keep the negotiations quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Everything was public--too public, some say--in the Hornets'
on-again, off-again relationship with the city.</TE>
<TE>   "I strongly think this needs to be done in a neutral location and
in privacy because the feeding frenzy surrounding the Hornets was
absolutely absurd," Wheeler said.</TE>
<TE>   The number one thing keeping the NBA from coming back to Charlotte
is a new arena.</TE>
<TE>   Granik insists that no team will ever play in Charlotte unless the
Coliseum, which lacks moneymaking luxury suites, is replaced.</TE>
<TE>   But to hammer out a lease agreement, a solution must first be
found to a $50 million gap in the city's arena-building plan.</TE>
<TE>   The city is willing to build a $231 million arena for an expansion
team, getting $100 million advance from Bank of America, Wachovia and
Duke Energy.</TE>
<TE>   City officials had hoped to take about $50 million in the first
arena revenues--from suite and club-seat deposits, naming rights and
beverage rights--to repay the corporations' half of their investment.</TE>
<TE>   But NBA officials could insist that that money go to the new team.
If that happens, the city will be hard-pressed to find the cash to
repay the corporations because leaders are committed to not using
property taxes to fund the arena or pay back the debt.</TE>
<TE>   If the details can be worked out in the next month or so, the
league could vote on expansion at its Board of Governors meeting in
October. If expansion is approved, the NBA would present the
agreement and expansion fee to potential owners and choose the group
that will be awarded the team.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA has indicated it doesn't want a new team in Charlotte
until the 2004-05 season -- a year later than potential owner Steve
Belkin wants to see a team on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in striking while the iron is hot," Belkin said.
"Basketball has been in Charlotte and the longer the city goes
without it, the harder it will be to drum interest back up.</TE>
<TE>   "I would still like to see a team on the floor in 2003, and I
continue to hold out hope that it will happen. But it's looking more
and more like '04 at the earliest."</TE>
<TE>   Belkin, a Boston-based businessman, is head of a group that
includes Hall of Famer Larry Bird and former Celtics coach M.L. Carr.
The three have already gone to work building their case as the
ownership group the NBA should choose.</TE>
<TE>   Bird has been to Charlotte at least once to meet with city and
business leaders, and Carr has been here for months as president of
the WNBA's Charlotte Sting.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not a summer vacation for me here in Charlotte," Carr
said. "There will be basketball again here in this city and our group
has put the work in to get it."</TE>
<TE>   The early involvement from the Belkin group has given them the air
of a favorite. The inclusion of Bird, who led the Boston Celtics to
three NBA titles and coached the Indiana Pacers to an Eastern
Conference title, only strengthens their chances.</TE>
<TE>   Bird would be the team's director of basketball operations and
Carr would handle community relations.</TE>
<TE>   "The signal that the NBA has sent by making M.L. Carr the head of
the Charlotte Sting is major, in my opinion, and I see it only as an
indication that they are the front-runner," Wheeler said.</TE>
<TE>   But the other suitors--Black Entertainment Television founder
Robert Johnson and Miami Heat investor Bob Sturges--can stand on
their own merits.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, if awarded the franchise, would be the league's first
black majority owner, and he has the financial ability to immediately
buy an expansion team.</TE>
<TE>   His net worth is estimated at $1.3 billion in the most recent
Forbes 400 list. He tried to buy a piece of the Hornets in 1999, but
Shinn chose Wooldridge as a partner instead.</TE>
<TE>   And Sturges, a former Carnival Cruise Lines executive, has NBA
experience through his limited ownership of the Heat.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the main reasons for visiting Charlotte is to have people
understand how I see this franchise being run and to hear from people
there what needs to be done," Sturges said after a recent visit.</TE>

<HD>Success of Saratoga Has Come at a Price</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BEYER</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>People start arriving at Saratoga Race Course as early as 7 a.m. to
stake out a position where they will spend the afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   They may be content to spread out a blanket on a small patch of
ground where they can't see a live horse and can barely see a
television monitor.</LD>
<LD>   For much of the last week they had to endure oppressive heat and
humidity. This weekend, they will cope with even longer-than-usual
lines at betting windows, concession stands and rest rooms as nearly
60,000 people pack the track for the Travers Stakes.</LD>
<TE>   It is an extraordinary phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   This is, after all, an era when thoroughbred racing's popularity
has declined; many tracks depend on simulcasts to generate their
business, so that live racing is almost an anachronism.</TE>
<TE>   But the public can't get enough of Saratoga, and visitors gladly
put up with inconveniences and discomforts to be here. The track
produces attendance and betting figures that once would have been
unimaginable.</TE>
<TE>   Wagering on the races this season has averaged $16.6 million per
day--a figure that will smash the North American record set here last
year.</TE>
<TE>   However, Saratoga's boom has come at a price. The massive crowds
have changed the character of the place, and some of the track's
longtime loyalists will say that success has spoiled Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   For many decades, the appeal of Saratoga was its intimacy. When
the racing fraternity gathered here in August, the charms of town and
track were a well-kept secret.</TE>
<TE>   The crowds at Saratoga were small enough that horses were saddled
under the elm trees in the paddock, where fans could stand within an
arm's length of them. But in the 1980s the outside world discovered
Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   Off-track betting had given people in the region year-round
exposure to the sport via television and they were hungry to see the
real thing. Vacationers started flocking here, too.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Schwartz, chairman of the New York Racing Association, is
also the CEO of Calvin Klein Inc., and he said, "In my business we
call certain stores 'destination resources.' Saratoga has become a
destination spot in New York. Everybody planning a trip through the
Adirondacks comes through here."</TE>
<TE>   Why does Saratoga appeal so strongly to non-hardcore fans, while
most other tracks can't entice newcomers at all?</TE>
<TE>   Its mystique has several components. Saratoga offers what is
arguably the best day-to-day racing in the country, and even the most
casual fans understand that they are seeing the sport's elite horses,
stables and jockeys.</TE>
<TE>   The brevity of the six-week season makes every day at Saratoga
seem special--a contrast to the endless continuum of racing at most
tracks.</TE>
<TE>   The track's location, alongside the grand, beautifully preserved
old houses on Union Avenue, underscores the fact that this place is
steeped in history, tradition and class.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps the key element of Saratoga's boom is the simple fact
that success breeds success. The American sporting public loves to be
where a crowd is.</TE>
<TE>   Beautiful Belmont Park has no drawing power on days when a few
thousand people are there, but everybody with a mild interest in
racing wants to be amid 100,000 others for the Belmont Stakes. People
love to be part of the bustling Saratoga scene, and the only ones put
off by the crowds are those who remember how wonderful the place was
in its tranquil past.</TE>
<TE>   The Saratoga season was the central part of my gambling life for a
quarter of a century, but by the 1990s I found that a day at the
races here had become as much an ordeal as a joy. The 1994 season was
abominable, plagued by rain scratches and small fields, and NYRA
sometimes made fans wait 35 or 40 minutes between races.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the season, I appeared on the in-house handicapping
show and made this public declaration: "You won't see me here again
for the rest of the millennium." I kept my word.</TE>
<TE>   Returning here after eight years, however, some of my love for
Saratoga has been rekindled. Since the '94 season prompted an
overhaul of the track's management, Saratoga has offered consistently
high-quality racing with fields of respectable size. The time between
races is reasonable, and the track finally has begun to offer
out-of-state simulcasts to entertain those of us who are not content
playing nine races a day.</TE>
<TE>   NYRA has coped as best as it can with the large crowds, turning
almost every available inch of its grounds into a massive picnic area
filled with television monitors and concession stands.</TE>
<TE>   "We've created an environment that's very fan-friendly," Schwartz
said. "When you walk through the grandstand it's like being at a
country fair."</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, I might have replied, snidely, that if I wanted a
country-fair atmosphere I'd go to a country fair, not a racetrack.
But I am more tolerant of the carnival atmosphere here now. While
Saratoga may be too hectic and crowded for comfort, racing fans have
seen too much of the alternative.</TE>
<TE>   As attendance has dwindled at most American tracks, the atmosphere
at them has become dispiriting. Belmont Park is a magnificent
facility--superior in many ways to Saratoga--but with 5,000 people
rattling around the cavernous grandstand on a weekday, it is spooky
and depressing. A horseplayer can't help thinking that he's a relic
playing a dying game. In Saratoga, where the track is packed every
day and the whole community is preoccupied by racing, no such
negative thoughts are possible.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Team Is No Longer King of World</HD>
<DH>Basketball: Other nations take aim at Americans during
World Championships, and many believe an upset is possible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS SHERIDAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Sooner or later, a team of NBA stars representing the United States
is going to lose an international basketball game.</LD>
<LD>   If it happens before Athens 2004 or Beijing 2008, maybe it'll
happen right in the heart of Hoosierville between now and Sept. 8.</LD>
<LD>   It all depends on how much the world has caught up--along with how
good of a team the United States is sending.</LD>
<TE>   "If we take this like an All-Star game, we can get beat," U.S.
Coach George Karl said. "If we take it like a playoff game, I don't
think we can get beat."</TE>
<TE>   What is about to transpire at the RCA Dome and Conseco Fieldhouse
is viewed in other parts of the world as an event much, much bigger
than the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   If the improbable happens and some other team walks away with the
gold, there will be bedlam in the streets of Belgrade, Barcelona,
Buenos Aires or some other burg.</TE>
<TE>   Despite what many American hoops fans may believe, such a scenario
is no longer farfetched. A decade after the original Dream Team
waltzed through Barcelona, the international basketball community is
no longer in awe.</TE>
<TE>   Quite to the contrary, America is the target.</TE>
<TE>   "It's American arrogance that says the Olympics are the biggest
thing," Karl said. "America has glamorized the Olympics as the
championships, right or wrong, good or bad. But three or four of
these teams have already pinpointed this tournament as more
important."</TE>
<TE>   The teams from Yugoslavia, Turkey, Argentina and other countries
have been training for months, drilling and preparing for the
tournament that comes around once every four years.</TE>
<TE>   With the worldwide growth of the sport in recent years, a
procession of walkovers by the U.S. team is no longer a lock. The
United States still holds the edge in talent from the top to bottom
of its roster, but many of the competitors have an edge in
familiarity by having played together for several years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really about who brings the best athletes to the
tournament, but who brings the best team," said U.S. guard Jay
Williams. "It's just like the NBA: On any given day, any team can
beat any team."</TE>
<TE>   That's a pretty strong admission from a player whose country, for
the past decade, has not only been expected to win every game -- but
also to do it with ease and flair.</TE>
<TE>   The United States enters this tournament with a record of 53-0
since NBA players began representing it at international
competitions.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team will be a prohibitive favorite again, but there will
be several NBA players on the rosters of other nations.</TE>
<TE>   Yugoslavia can field a team of five players--Vlade Divac, Predrag
Drobnjak, Peja Stojakovic, Vladimir Radmanovic and Marko Jaric--who
earn their living playing in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's lineup includes Hedo Turkoglu of the Sacramento Kings,
Mehmet Okur of the Detroit Pistons and Mirsad Turkcan, who played
briefly with the Knicks and Bucks.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie of the Year Pau Gasol of the Memphis Grizzlies will play
for Spain; Dirk Nowitzki of Dallas plays for Germany; Utah forward
Andrei Kirilenko will suit up for Russia; Oscar Torres of the Houston
Rockets will be playing for Venezuela; and Yao Ming, the No. 1 pick
of the Houston Rockets in June's NBA draft, will represent China.</TE>
<TE>   "It's much different now," said Reggie Miller, who at 37 will be
the oldest member of the U.S. team. "If you look at our past All-Star
game, a lot of our superstars were international superstars. The
international competition as well as the level of those teams is far
better because of those guys' expertise."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the best American players, including Shaquille O'Neal,
Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan and Tracy McGrady, will not be
playing in this tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans will still field a formidable team of Jermaine
O'Neal, Ben Wallace, Antonio Davis, Raef LaFrentz, Elton Brand, Shawn
Marion, Paul Pierce, Williams, Reggie Miller, Andre Miller, Baron
Davis and Michael Finley.</TE>
<TE>   American teams have had a pair of extremely narrow victories over
the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, only a last-second miss by
Lithuania allowed the United States to escape with a two-point
victory. And at the 2001 Goodwill Games in Brisbane, the U.S. team
was taken into overtime by Brazil before finally prevailing.</TE>
<TE>   Four players from the Goodwill Games team remain on the U.S.
roster, but there are no holdovers from Sydney. The only player with
Olympics or World Championships experience is Reggie Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the United States has a 109-2 record in the Olympics, its
record in the World Championships is only 91-23.</TE>
<TE>   Yugoslavia is the defending champion, having won in 1998 when an
NBA lockout resulted in the United States fielding a team of
collegians and minor leaguers.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team is well aware of the high standard it is expected to
uphold: Not only winning the gold medal, but also finishing with its
record still unblemished.</TE>

<HD>Lights, Cameras, Laughter From Kabul</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Once silenced by the Taliban, a beloved
program returns to the airwaves, to residents' delight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TODD RICHISSIN</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Cue music. (Man with accordion assaults the ears.)</LD>
<LD>   Lights! (They flicker a bit, but the studio brightens.)</LD>
<LD>   Cameras! (The picture seems slightly unfocused, but it will do.)</LD>
<TE>   And ... finally: Live, from Afghanistan! It's Saturday night! (So
what if it's only live in a sort-of kind-of way.)</TE>
<TE>   More than 700 people applaud wildly. Those who can whistle do. For
after more than six years in the dark, Afghanistan's longest-running,
even if limping, variety and quiz show is back on the airwaves,
drawing standing-room-only crowds to the theater where it is taped
and attracting people to the country's few remaining televisions like
moths to lightbulbs.</TE>
<TE>   In a country with so much misery behind it and mountains of
problems ahead, the show, "Zehni Azmoyena" (in Pashtu), "Azmonga
Zehni" (in Dari) or "Test Your Brain," has reclaimed its slot as the
program that people just have to talk about the next day. To find a
television at 9 o'clock on a Saturday night in Afghanistan is to find
a laughing crowd.</TE>
<TE>   The show is part David Letterman, part Academic Challenge, part
Monty Python, and the show of shows as far as people in Afghanistan
are concerned. It began in 1979, survived the Soviet invasion and the
subsequent civil war before going off the air in 1996, when the
Taliban took control. It returned to the airwaves last winter, and
the audience, as best as anyone can tell, keeps growing.</TE>
<TE>   "People like us because they can laugh and learn at the same
time," says the show's director, Muhammad Usman Azimi. "We are very
proud of what we do here, even if we have some problems."</TE>
<TE>   The lights give out now and again, the microphones are the size of
garbage can lids and about as high-tech, the cameras hardly provide a
lifelike image, and 20-year-old editing machines make the
presentation anything but seamless. (The show, taped live, goes on
for four hours before being edited down to 70 minutes.)</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knows how many people watch the show, by far the most
popular of 18 being produced by the government-run television
station.</TE>
<TE>   But in Kabul, at least, which most nights has electricity, the
people love testing their brains with a laugh; and if they don't own
a television, they will pile into a neighbor's house or even stand in
front of a tube pulled onto the sidewalk. "Zehni" is broadcast with
frequent shots of audience reaction, and it is difficult to spot a
person who can contain his laughter any better than the people
howling on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday night, two contestants played a game often featured on
the show. They were asked simple yes-or-no questions by the
hostess--"Is your name Omar? Do you live in Kabul?"--and they were to
say one answer while providing its opposite visually. That is, they
were to answer "yes" while shaking their head side-to-side to
indicate "no." Or they were to answer "no" while nodding their head
in the affirmative. By the third question, the heads turn in a
circular motion.</TE>
<TE>   Milton Berle never made America laugh so hard.</TE>
<TE>   (As a sign of the show's popularity, the bit about shaking the
head "no" while saying "yes" has been a running joke, continuing
during the years the Taliban pulled the plug on the program.)</TE>
<TE>   "People come up to me on the street and ask me about the show and
thank me for bringing laughter," says the hostess, Rida Azimy. "I see
it makes them happy, and that makes me happy."</TE>
<TE>   "Zehni" goes beyond laughs, however, to offer light-hearted social
commentary and serious education wrapped in comedy. On a recent show,
the announcer apologized for starting late but explained that he had
been stuck in Kabul's traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a message to the government that this traffic is crazy,"
the director says. "They watch too."</TE>
<TE>   Between questions and puzzles, comedy skits are performed by an
ensemble that slips in a helpful message here and there.</TE>
<TE>   In one skit, a man performs a traditional Pashtun dance because he
is, finally, about to be married. But in a message to noisy neighbors
everywhere, he's quickly reminded that he should not dance on the
third floor of an apartment building because it will disturb those
below.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the quizzes are the heart of the show. "In what month did
Al Qaeda destroy the Buddha?" goes one question.</TE>
<TE>   "If a man flies to Japan and it takes 90 minutes to get there, why
does it take 1 1/2 hours to return?" goes another.</TE>
<TE>   In one segment, in English to encourage education, two teams are
told: "A man walks out into the rain for a half-hour with no hat and
no umbrella. He doesn't get a single hair on his head wet. How can
this be?" Answer: The man is bald.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Taliban, enough businesses supported the program that
contestants could win TV sets, motorcycles and refrigerators.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as Afghanistan struggles, the prizes are more modest. A woman
won chewing gum on a recent program. A man won some Pepsi.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe the prizes will get better again," Azimi says, "but I don't
think they care. The prizes are not the point."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the tradition of the show includes awarding a grand prize
at its conclusion. A child is called to the stage to pick among
hundreds of numbers. Every audience member has one, which corresponds
to his seat.</TE>
<TE>   "D-12!" the announcer shouts from a pulled raffle ticket. A young
man, maybe 17, bounces onto stage looking like he has just won all
the stars in the sky.</TE>
<TE>   Today's grand prize: three cartons of milk and a box of blank CDs.</TE>
<TE>   That, in Afghanistan, is show biz.</TE>

<HD>Frozen Peas, Carrots -- and Bible</HD>
<DH>Europe: A factory has become the repository of thousands of
soggy Czech treasures, damaged in this month's devastating floods.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VANESSA GERA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOCHOV, Czech Republic</DL>
<LD>Just past a room stocked with spinach and peas, music scores written
by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart lie frozen in a factory that until
recently concerned itself with nothing but packaging vegetables.</LD>
<LD>   "And there's the Prague Bible," manager Vladimir Blaha said,
pointing to another shelf in a frigid room stacked with bundles of
papers wrapped tightly in plastic. The 1488 edition of the Bible is
the first ever printed in the Czech language and is one of just 12
surviving copies.</LD>
<LD>   Until this month, these treasures -- and tens of thousands of
other historic books and documents -- were stored safely in the
basements of museums, libraries and other cultural institutions
throughout Prague.</LD>
<TE>   Then the worst flooding in 175 years caused ground water and
sewage to surge into cellars, and the guardians of the nation's
historic treasures had to scramble to salvage what they could.</TE>
<TE>   Putting the soggy materials into the arctic storerooms at the
Mochovske Mrazirny company is a time-buying tactic meant to prevent
further damage to the documents until officials can find the
equipment and resources to restore the paper.</TE>
<TE>   Prague's municipal library, owner of the 1488 Bible, was the first
to seek the company's help. By late last week, , 18 other
institutions also had trucked documents to the factory near Mochov, a
village 12 miles east of Prague.</TE>
<TE>   At the factory, a handwritten list on notebook paper tracks the
depositors: the National Museum, the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra,
the Academy of Science, the former Nazi concentration camp
Theresienstadt at Terezin.</TE>
<TE>   The government estimated that damage to cultural sites totaled $73
million, including costs for repairing buildings and restoring
documents and the value of destroyed manuscripts.</TE>
<TE>   The director of the municipal library, Tomas Rehak, said he turned
to the vegetable company after one of his employees found in
researching the Internet that the only solution for saving the soggy
documents was to freeze them immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Special equipment will be needed to vacuum out the moisture later.</TE>
<TE>   "We just opened the yellow pages to look for someone with freezing
capabilities, and this was the first one," Rehak said.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew the name from the back of frozen vegetables. Actually, all
of us were used to buying these vegetables."</TE>
<TE>   Rehak phoned the factory to ask whether its managers would be
willing to freeze and store 20,000 of the library's most valuable
manuscripts, some several centuries old.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first heard that, I thought, 'You're crazy!,' " Blaha
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   But within five hours, both the factory's director and the
government had approved the emergency plan, Rehak said.</TE>
<TE>   Blaha said health officials later imposed conditions that all
papers must arrive sealed in plastic and that they not be kept in
freezer rooms with food.</TE>
<TE>   At the factory, workers cart bundles of papers into the freezer
unit, a room about half the size of a tennis court and 26 feet high.</TE>
<TE>   It's not known how long the materials will have to remain frozen.</TE>
<TE>   The Czech minister of culture, Pavel Dostal, said it could take up
to 100 years to restore the frozen documents.</TE>
<TE>   But Jana Tomsu, an art restoration expert with the National
Museum, said it could even take longer, noting it would take one
restorer working alone 5,000 years to repair 20,000 books.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion [the freezing] doesn't make sense. It is only a way
of delaying the solution," Tomsu said. "Nobody has any experience
with it here."</TE>
<TE>   It's still unclear who will pay Mochovske Mrazirny for the big
chill. The emergency measure was made in such haste that there was no
time to talk about payment.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an agreement that they will freeze and store our books,
but nothing about money," Rehak said. "We will probably pay
something, or maybe the state will pay something. I just don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Blaha said the company doesn't know whether it will be paid
anything, but he thinks it deserves something.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no idea how this preservation process works," he said.
"But this stuff could be frozen here for years."</TE>

<HD>Is Water a Human Right or a Commodity?</HD>
<DH>Environment: Already marketed worldwide by companies, the
privatization of 'blue gold' is likely to be a key topic at an
upcoming U.N. conference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MORT ROSENBLUM</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>In a world fast running short of fresh water, a new debate rages:
Private companies are free to exploit oil, "black gold," but what
about the infinitely more valuable resource of "blue gold"?</LD>
<LD>   Two French companies alone -- Suez and Vivendi Environnement --
supply water to 230 million people worldwide, from such U.S. cities
as Atlanta to urban centers throughout the Third World.</LD>
<LD>   Hardly noticed a few years ago, the issue of water privatization
will probably be a big topic at the United Nations' World Summit on
Sustainable Development that begins Monday in South Africa.</LD>
<TE>   It raises a deceptively simple question: Is water a human right or
a commodity?</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is that it's both," said Peter Gleick of the Pacific
Institute in Berkeley. Everyone has a right to safe, clean water, he
said, but because of government failures, 1.1 billion people lack
access to it.</TE>
<TE>   A new trend is clear. Both Suez and Vivendi expect double-digit
annual growth in their water business, and each already has contracts
that total more than $10 billion a year. Puerto Rico just hired Suez
to distribute its water.</TE>
<TE>   RWE, a German energy conglomerate, is buying small water companies
to challenge the French ones. Hundreds of other private operators
hold concessions to pump, treat and distribute water.</TE>
<TE>   Although companies are granted rights to market water -- not
ownership of the water itself -- Gleick and others worry that an
inevitable expansion of the private sector might escape essential
public control.</TE>
<TE>   "Privatization has the potential to grow enormously because of the
desperate need for water in the developing world, but water is too
important to be left in purely private hands," Gleick said.</TE>
<TE>   The World Bank, U.N. agencies and a number of governments support
a concept they call "PPP," or public-private partnerships. They
encourage companies to invest heavily in the pumps, mains and other
infrastructure for delivering water in exchange for profit.</TE>
<TE>   In many big cities, up to half the water is lost to leaks and
broken mains. Billing is often chaotic. Public water utilities,
usually short of cash and expertise, struggle to meet fast-growing
demand.</TE>
<TE>   Suez and Vivendi each point to cases throughout the world where
they have expanded service, sometimes with lower rates.</TE>
<TE>   Both insist that they sell service, not water, and they stress
that they operate on concessions that must be renewed.</TE>
<TE>   They say better systems mean that many poor people now have access
to reliable water for much less than they paid vendors.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the money and the expertise, and we believe we can manage
water better than states can," said Jacques Petry, head of Ondeo,
Suez's water division. "We don't own these resources. We manage them
and protect them."</TE>
<TE>   But Ondeo's American subsidiary faced a storm of protest after it
took over Atlanta's water supply in 1999. Consumers reported
mysterious cuts, confused billing and long delays for service.</TE>
<TE>   Managing water is a business fraught with economic and cultural
complexities. A 2000 uprising in Cochabamba, Bolivia, underlines the
dangers. Consumers revolted when Bechtel doubled water rates. Seven
people died in the violence, and the U.S. firm lost its concession.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian activist Maude Barlow, author of the book "Blue Gold,"
makes her position clear in its subtitle: "The Fight to Stop the
Corporate Theft of the World's Water."</TE>
<TE>   While agreeing that the private sector has some role to play, she
says water must remain firmly in public hands with no confusion
between human right and commercial asset.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't have both as equal in law," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Barlow praised the Cochabamba uprising in glowing terms.
Today, she acknowledges, the current cooperative-run water system is
in shambles, with neither capital nor experience.</TE>
<TE>   "Why can you find money for a private company and not a public
company?" she asked, arguing that global agencies should help local
officials run their water utilities.</TE>
<TE>   Other activists worry that there is a flaw in the logic of
privatization: If firms make money by delivering water, won't their
incentive be to sell as much as they can rather than to conserve a
scarce resource?</TE>
<TE>   But William Cosgrove, a Canadian consultant who helped draft the
World Water Vision paper for an environmental summit last year in The
Hague, insists that most people, company executives included, believe
water is a basic right.</TE>
<TE>   "This is controversial simply because it's not understood," he
said. "As long as it is accepted that governments set up regulatory
frameworks and define objectives, they can make the best use of water
they have."</TE>
<TE>   Executives at Suez and Vivendi agree.</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Luc Trancart, a Suez spokesman with long experience in French
water management, argues that private companies fill a vital need. "I
always tell activists if they really want to hurt us, they should
make the public sector work better," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pierre Victoria, community relations director at Vivendi, says
government must take a regulatory role, and he argues that private
management is bound to fail if people do not see better service at
fair rates.</TE>
<TE>   In the long term, Gleick at the Pacific Institute believes private
companies are not likely to be the prime movers. Already, he said,
large American cities with good municipal systems are thinking twice
about privatization.</TE>
<TE>   "If the big-profile examples like Atlanta get ugly, that will slow
things down fast," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And business opportunities are limited in countries without strong
civil societies.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll pick the low-hanging fruit -- the municipal systems
already in operation but in need of expertise or cash, serving
middle-and upper-class segments of society," Gleick said. "The poor
will continue to be left out."</TE>

<DL>MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Khair Muhammad, who says he's 10 -- "maybe" -- sits on the floor
working amid the noise and toxic smells of a workshop at the Sherzad
Plastic Factory.</LD>
<LD>   He expertly cuts excess material from molded water pitchers with a
small knife held by equally small hands stained red by dye.</LD>
<LD>   For his 10 1/2 hours of labor, Khair will earn 13,000 Afghanis --
about 20 cents. His six-day week will bring in $1.20.</LD>
<TE>   But that sum will help support his family of eight, struggling to
survive because the children's father is too old to work. "We don't
have anything to eat at home, so I have to work to earn money," says
Khair, who has a firm handshake learned from two years on the job.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,000 children are working in the northern city of
Mazar-i-Sharif, plus thousands more throughout the country, said
Robert Ffolkes, head of Afghan operations of Save the Children, a
British charity.</TE>
<TE>   Drought, war and a long history of poverty make child laborers a
vital part of the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you can stop it," Ffolkes said. "They can't afford
not to work, and their families can't afford for them not to work."</TE>
<TE>   The problem is particularly acute in Afghanistan because the
Taliban didn't allow women to work and augment their families'
incomes, said Martha Bragin, a child protection consultant with
UNICEF.</TE>
<TE>   At the Sherzad factory, owner Ramatullah Sherzad says 800 of his
1,000 workers are under age 18. He says his youngest is 13 --
although Khair standing nearby is clearly younger.</TE>
<TE>   Sherzad says he made no special effort to recruit child laborers.
"They have money problems and they have to work here," he says. "We
don't bring them here -- they come to us."</TE>
<TE>   Besides wages, the workers get two meals a day: bread with tea and
sugar for breakfast, and beans for lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Among the products the factory makes are small water pitchers with
the word "Titanic" and a teddy bear printed on them, a product
Sherzad says resulted from requests by children who saw the hit
movie.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, his day off, aren't much of a break for Khair. He can't
name any game he likes to play. He says he enjoys bringing his family
water. He can't read.</TE>
<TE>   Child laborers like Khair aren't hard to find here.</TE>
<TE>   In a sweltering, cramped room piled to the ceiling with firewood,
14-year-old Sadiq is rocking a cauldron in a circle to sugarcoat
peanuts and make noqol, an Afghan sweet. He attended school up to
third grade, but as the oldest in his family, he dropped out and went
to work. His father is a farmer, but he has been unable to make a
living the last few years because of the drought.</TE>

<HD>Blond Lions Don't Have More Fun, Study Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RECER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>On the Serengeti plain, the lady lion prefers a swain with a black
mane.</LD>
<LD>   That's the finding of a study analyzing how the dense collar of
hair about the neck of male lions affects the love life of Africa's
biggest cat.</LD>
<LD>   Peyton M. West, a researcher at the University of Minnesota, said
it's the mane color, not the length, that matters most to the female
lions of Tanzania.</LD>
<TE>   "We were completely surprised by this," said West, first author of
the study appearing last week in the journal Science.</TE>
<TE>   West said the female lions may instinctively be drawn to the black
manes because males with darker manes seem superior in a number of
ways.</TE>
<TE>   "A dark mane is apparently a marker the female uses to evaluate
the fitness of a male," she said, suggesting that lions' manes
evolved over time through sexual selection.</TE>
<TE>   Dark-maned male lions generally have a higher level of
testosterone, "which means they are more aggressive fighters," West
said. This can be key to raising cubs successfully.</TE>
<TE>   An aggressive male is better able to chase away invading bachelors
who try to take over the pride, West said. This is important because
if there is a change in male leadership of a pride, the new dominant
male routinely kills all the young cubs sired by the deposed male.
Thus, by choosing to mate dark-maned, aggressive males, a female lion
gives her young a better chance of surviving.</TE>
<TE>   West said that records collected for decades by scientists
observing lions in Tanzania's Serengeti National Park show that male
lions with dark manes are more likely to recover from wounds. Why
this is so remains a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   She noted that dark manes seem to intimidate other male lions,
which means a lion with a black collar of hair has to fight less
often and therefore has fewer injuries.</TE>
<TE>   West and her co-author, Craig Packer of the University of
Minnesota, investigated the effects of mane color by setting up
life-sized models of lions near where the animals lived in the
Serengeti.</TE>
<TE>   She said they found that female lions, when given a choice, would
try to seduce the models that had the darker mane, ignoring those
with blond hair.</TE>
<TE>   Male lions, West said, were more likely to attack the lion models
with short manes or with light-colored manes, while avoiding the
models with black manes.</TE>
<TE>   West said that most prides have a surplus of female adults and
that during mating season the female lions will try to lure the males
into fathering cubs. She said the researchers discovered that females
gave most of their attention to the males with the dark manes.</TE>

<HD>In Mideast Conflict, a War of Euphemisms</HD>
<DH>Politics: The verbal arms race between Israelis and
Palestinians began long ago, but has burgeoned in the last 23 months
with new words.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MYRE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>When Israeli soldiers track and kill a Palestinian militant, the army
calls it "focused prevention." When Palestinian suicide bombers
strike, their backers cheer "heroic martyrdom operations."</LD>
<LD>   In the linguistic combat of the Mideast, Israelis and Palestinians
are remarkably creative in sanitizing descriptions of the ways they
kill each other.</LD>
<LD>   The verbal arms race predates the September 2000 eruption of the
current Palestinian uprising, but the lingo has been greatly
increased over the last 23 months.</LD>
<TE>   "These terms catch on very quickly with the public," said Lior
Yavne of the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem. "It's important
that we don't allow this language to hide what is really happening."</TE>
<TE>   Even the conflict's name is a fuzzy term. Palestinians call their
violent uprising against Israeli control the intifada, which means
"shaking off" in Arabic. Still, the term is so ingrained, even
Israelis use it.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides have so honed their skills that they can detail lethal
events entirely in euphemisms.</TE>
<TE>   Relying mostly on combat helicopters, Israeli forces began killing
Palestinian militants suspected of attacking Israel and initially
labeled the assaults "preemptive strikes." Palestinians called them
"assassinations."</TE>
<TE>   The army then rolled out the phrase "pinpoint preventive
operations." Despite its alliterative allure, that never took hold,
and it was ditched in favor of an even more benign term: "focused
prevention"--as in, "the Palestinian terrorist was eliminated during
a focused prevention operation."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side, "a heroic martyrdom operation against the
Zionist entity" is the way the militant Islamic movement Hamas
typically claims responsibility for a suicide bombing. Hamas has
carried out more suicide bombings than any other faction, although it
never employs that term. It also avoids using the word "Israel,"
which it refuses to recognize.</TE>
<TE>   A number of Israeli officials also reject the term suicide
bombers, saying it focuses on the assailant, not the victims. They
favor "homicide bombers."</TE>
<TE>   Some Palestinians call suicide bombers "F-11s," a nickname that
plays off the Palestinians' view that they don't have high-tech
firepower like Israel's F-16 warplanes. "We have F-11s," they say,
wiggling their index and middle fingers simultaneously to approximate
the legs of a suicide bomber walking toward a target.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the Mideast conflict is about winning international
support, with each side attempting to demonize the other and present
itself as a victim acting in self-defense. The sides frequently
complain to journalists, diplomats and anyone else who fails to adopt
their phrases.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most bitterly disputed word is "terrorist," which the
Israelis employ liberally, expanding it on occasion to cover
low-level activists with no clear involvement in violence. The army
has on several occasions announced the killing of a "terrorist," only
to retract that later and acknowledge that it was an unarmed civilian
killed unintentionally.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Palestinians normally avoid the word
altogether--except when referring to Israeli military attacks on
suspected militants. They call those "Israeli state terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Under intense U.S. pressure, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat made
rare use of the word in a Feb. 3 op-ed piece in the New York Times.
"I condemn the attacks carried out by terrorist groups against
Israeli civilians," Arafat wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian leaders, including Arafat, give full-throated support
to the Palestinian uprising. But in most cases, they are
intentionally vague in comments to journalists and in official
statements when talking about violence by Palestinians. They use
phrases such as "legitimate resistance" or "military operations."</TE>
<TE>   Explicitly endorsing attacks would anger Israel and leaders in
many other countries. Denouncing attacks would risk alienating the
majority of Palestinians who support them.</TE>
<TE>   Another euphemism got in the news recently, after Israeli soldiers
surrounded a wanted Palestinian militant at a house in the West Bank
village of Tubas and dragooned a 19-year-old Palestinian next door
into helping them.</TE>
<TE>   Nidal Daraghmeh was forced to put on a bulletproof vest, knock on
the door and bring out everyone inside. As he approached the house,
he was shot in the head and killed--although it's not clear who fired
the fatal shot.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians and human-rights groups denounced the army's use of
"human shields." The army said it was employing its long-standing
"neighbor procedure."</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is that a person is going in to warn people inside and
explain the situation," said an army spokesman, Capt. Jacob Dallal.
"It's done for the safety of everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Israel is now attempting to expel a trio of Palestinians from the
West Bank to the isolation of the Gaza Strip, for allegedly assisting
siblings who attacked Israel. The army has a term for this: an "order
limiting the place of residency."</TE>
<TE>   The verbal feud reaches the top levels on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat returned from exile eight years ago, yet there's no
agreement on his title as head of the Palestinian National Authority.
Palestinians call him "President Arafat." Israelis refer to "Chairman
Arafat," saying there's not yet a Palestinian state to be president
of.</TE>
<TE>   It's doublespeak that is even in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
accords of nearly a decade ago. Israel's government agreed then that
Arafat's title would be rais, an Arabic word meaning leader--allowing
the Palestinians to translate it as president and the Israelis as
chairman.</TE>

<DH>Mexico City: Escribanos help all comers with love letters
and legal forms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA J. ADAMS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>The young man in baggy jeans and a Nike cap hunches over his
notebook, trying to decipher emotions laid bare in a tangle of
scribbled ink.</LD>
<LD>   "Our relationship isn't like it was. I feel bad. You're drifting
away from me slowly but surely.... I look forward to your response. I
love you," 28-year-old Jose reads haltingly, then looks up at the man
next to him.</LD>
<LD>   "How does that sound?" he asks.</LD>
<TE>   Jesus Tenorio, 33, stops tapping at the keys of his electric
typewriter. "It's good, but I think we should add this," he says,
jotting a thought in the margin that only the two can see.</TE>
<TE>   Jose leans over, looks, nods. "Yeah, I like it."</TE>
<TE>   The love-struck man could have composed his anguished missive in
an e-mail at an Internet cafe or dialed up his estranged girlfriend
from the cell phone dangling from his hip.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he has come to the Plaza Santa Domingo, a square in the
heart of Mexico City where for more than 200 years scribes like
Tenorio have been drafting legal forms, love letters and the like for
all comers.</TE>
<TE>   In an age of Palm Pilots and personal computers, the escribanos
represent a colorful vestige of Mexico's colonial past that is as
rooted in the plaza as its two monolithic stone buildings that once
housed Mexico's customs house and Inquisition tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   Historians believe the first quill-wielding scribes went to work
sometime in the 18th century, serving custom house clients and
Inquisition victims who were illiterate or unfamiliar with government
procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the clerks began putting form to feelings, writing original
love letters, "Dear John" notes and apology messages for clients.</TE>
<TE>   The quill gave way long ago to pens, then to manual typewriters,
and then to the electric typewriters that still sit atop a series of
small wooden and metal desks set up under the stone arches of the
17th century building known as the Portal Santo Domingo. Computers
have yet to make an appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Talking over the shouts of printers hawking their services and the
clank and thunk of antique hand-operated presses, customers dictate
facts and feelings to the escribanos or seek advice on completing
government forms -- all for 10 to 50 pesos a page, about $1 to $5.</TE>
<TE>   "We serve as guides -- on how to fill out applications, how to
write a letter, whom to direct it to," says Miguel Hernandez Ordonez,
51, who has been a scribe for 29 years. "You can't get that kind of
personalized service at an Internet cafe."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez is secretary-general of the union that represents the 40
scribes and more than two dozen old-fashioned print machine operators
who work at the plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Being an escribano is "in some ways like being a psychologist,"
says 40-year-old Enrique Acevedo Salas, a fixture in the plaza for 18
years. "You have to figure out what each individual needs. They come
so that we can advise them."</TE>
<TE>   Acevedo says he has dealt with "every class of person, from the
most humble to doctors and lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   "Unfaithful wives send anonymous notes to their lovers," he adds,
giggling conspiratorially. "Then there are the timid lovers who need
help coming up with just the right words for their letters."</TE>
<TE>   But even the most nervous customers have faith that the escribanos
will guard their secrets.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, you're dealing with the utmost discretion," says veteran
scribe Jose Edith Gonzalez, 62. "We don't betray the customers. They
deposit their trust in us."</TE>
<TE>   For 35 years, Gonzalez has held court on a small patch of public
concrete at Portal Santo Domingo No. 12. He still uses a clunky,
decades-old manual Remington 17 typewriter with the letters worn off
the green plastic-covered keys.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez obviously is attached to the old relic. "It's very
egotistical. If someone asks to borrow it, it immediately breaks down
and refuses to work," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But when all is said and done, "it doesn't matter what kind of
machine I have," Gonzalez says. "What matters to the client is that I
understand what his needs are."</TE>
<TE>   "I no longer see him as a typist. I see him as a friend," says
Fausto Diaz Orozco, 72, a journalist who has relied on Gonzalez's
sharp editing eye for 20 years. "Thousands of people have come here
to reap the benefit of his knowledge and experience."</TE>
<TE>   The scribes' tradition owes its survival in large part to the
families who pass it down through the generations like an heirloom.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique Acevedo's grandfather labored here from 1936 to 1980, when
he retired at age 80. His father started 35 years ago and at 75 still
puts in several hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lovely thing, to be here helping people," Acevedo says. "I
am very proud of what my grandfather left me, and that I am able to
keep this tradition alive."</TE>

<DL>CIMARRON, N.M.</DL>
<LD>Delayed by a threatening forest fire and a daily climb up a sheer
cliff, archeologists excavated and cataloged a seasonal rock dwelling
they say may have been used 1,500 years ago by an ancient Indian
family.</LD>
<LD>   Warren Lail, a 51-year-old attorney-turned-archeologist, has
headed University of Oklahoma excavations at the Philmont Scout Ranch
for two successive summers. He's focusing on a little-known area
occupied by eastern Anasazi, believed to be ancestors of several
Indian tribes.</LD>
<LD>   Last year's site on Middle Ponil Creek has been radiocarbon-dated
at AD 780. The nearby site excavated this summer on North Ponil
Creek, Lail said, is about 200 feet higher and may be 200 years older
-- atop a high rock ridge that requires mountain-climbing gear to
reach. By late July, the team had gathered more than 800 artifacts,
such as arrow points.</LD>
<TE>   But the four-member group came close to losing everything. When
lightning started several fires on the Scout ranch in late May, the
team was asked to stay clear of its excavation. The Ponil Complex
fire burned 92,500 acres.</TE>
<TE>   When the team did return 22 days later, they found charred brush
less than 100 feet from the excavation, with its crisscrossing of
yellow string and laser-leveled camera.</TE>
<TE>   The archeologists plan to use a digital camera next year to
photograph each square meter of the dig each day.</TE>
<TE>   Lightning, a perennial hazard at a ranch overseeing 20,000 Scouts
each summer, drives the research team off the canyon rim nine days
out of 10, says graduate student Brian Lizzo of Chicago. The team
usually pulls out by 3 p.m., when the rumblings start. The digs
generally begin every day by 5:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been rushed off the mountain a few times," Lail said.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Lail had said that if carbon-dating showed the sites
studied in 2001 and 2002 were used concurrently, that could indicate
they had been used by the same family migrating from site to site as
seasons changed.</TE>
<TE>   This summer's site is believed to have been used during the fall
for hunting and gathering nuts. It is believed to have been used far
more frequently than the 2001 site had been. But the fact that it
also seems to be 200 or more years older, from AD 500-700, may
preclude the same family's having used it. Carbon-dating will help
determine its precise age.</TE>
<TE>   Both sites are nearly 200 miles east of Anasazi ruins at Chaco
Canyon and Mesa Verde.</TE>
<TE>   An oddity for their estimated time frame, though, is the lack of
pottery fragments, Lail said. Pottery normally would have been part
of their culture by AD 700. But these hunter-gatherers were not that
far along culturally, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a little bit behind," he said. "Ideas may have been slow
to travel."</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier, Lail found an arrowhead that he estimated could
date as early as AD 400. It was perfectly formed with subtle flaking,
and he said it seemed never to have been used.</TE>
<TE>   Although fire delayed their work this summer, he said, it may make
future summers easier. Fire has a way of burning off the cover that
hides archeological sites and subsequent rains wash artifacts out
into the drainages and riverbeds.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that's going to be the case up here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some arrow points have already washed down from the burned area
across North Ponil Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   "My intention is to survey the entire area now that it's burned,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Bear Necessities Don't Include Hunting, Alaska Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY CAMPBELL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE</DL>
<LD>A rare white-colored black bear got a reprieve from hunters Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In a teleconference meeting, the Alaska Board of Game ordered an
emergency closure on hunting of all "white phase" black bears in the
Juneau area. Effectively, that covers only one known white bear, the
one spotted and photographed recently by Pat Costello.</LD>
<LD>   Costello petitioned the board last week, asking that the animal
he's dubbed "Spirit Bear" be exempt when hunting season opens Sept.
1. "I'm thrilled with what the board did," Costello said Friday.
"They realized there's an extreme interest in this bear."</LD>
<TE>   Costello had the backing of hundreds of e-mail messages received
in the last week after he posted a picture of the bear on his Web
site, www.juneauphotos.com. People all over the world don't want to
see the bear harmed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "People recognize this is a unique animal. It's important to them,
whether they ever get to see it or not," he said. "They don't want to
see it just made into another rug."</TE>
<TE>   The game board's executive director, Diana Cote, said board
members agreed, and the state Department of Fish and Game told the
policymaking panel that it also supported the ban. State game
officials say they also have been flooded with phone calls and
e-mails urging them to spare the bear.</TE>
<TE>   The bear is creamy white, almost like a polar bear, but with a
distinctive raccoon mask around the eyes. Most likely it is a
variation of what biologists call a glacier bear -- genetically a
black bear, but with a light fur coat that can run from cinnamon to
golden retriever blond to blue-white.</TE>
<TE>   Although glacier bears are somewhat scarce, a bear this white is
rare even among glacier bears. Biologists in southeastern Alaska said
they have not seen another like it.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, there are a lot of different color morphs with black
bear," said Neil Barten, Douglas area biologist with the Alaska
Department of Fish and Game. "But not quite this white. This is
definitely unusual."</TE>
<TE>   The hunting ban will last at least until the game board's regular
meeting Nov. 1, when it will ask for public testimony and decide
whether to extend the ban through the rest of the hunting season,
which ends June 30.</TE>
<TE>   State biologists in the area have known of the bear's existence
for a few years. However, knowledge of it became public after
Costello took its picture.</TE>
<TE>   The bear had emerged from some woods near town while Costello was
waiting to take pictures of other black bears. The state's capital
city has a continuing problem with bears coming into town and raiding
trash cans and bins.</TE>
<TE>   Costello said he found himself standing in awe at the first
sighting and hadn't snapped a shot before the bear disappeared into
the trees.</TE>
<TE>   The white bear showed up again about 45 minutes later, Costello
said, "and I took 22 shots in about 60 seconds. Then it went back
again into the woods. It was exciting. I was visibly shaking."</TE>
<TE>   Taking any black bear out of season in Alaska is a Class A
misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in jail, a maximum $5,000
fine and a $600 restitution fee for the value of the bear to the
state. Conviction would also result in forfeiture of the weapon used
to kill the animal.</TE>

<HD>Warden 'Putt Off' by Driving Range</HD>
<DH>Nevada: Inmates can play ball instead, prison director
decides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRENDAN RILEY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARSON CITY, Nev.</DL>
<LD>When some Nevada inmates who wanted to work on their golf game
started to build a driving range, the state prison director got a bit
teed off. So now the range is a ball field.</LD>
<LD>   Prisons director Jackie Crawford said convicts at the prison
system's 100-inmate Tonopah Conservation Camp got the idea for their
own driving range after volunteering time to build one for the city.</LD>
<LD>   "Our inmates made a beautiful driving range for the city,"
Crawford said when asked Friday about the convicts' activity. "Then
they said, 'Why not make our own?'"</LD>
<TE>   "So they cleared sagebrush and they moved a lot of rock and they
moved some sand around -- but it [the inmates' range] never
materialized."</TE>
<TE>   "I told them to take the rocks and the sand away. It's a softball
field now."</TE>
<TE>   "I can assure you that there are no golf courses at our prisons,"
she added. "Not under this director."</TE>
<TE>   Softball's another matter, she said, adding, "That's something all
the prisons should have. It helps expend energy."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the driving range had remained, it wouldn't have been a
big expanse of green grass -- not in the arid central Nevada desert.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to laugh," Crawford said. "It would be like a golf
course on the moon."</TE>
<TE>   The driving range the inmates built for the city of Tonopah has an
artificial turf area where golfers stand. The balls are smacked into
the desert.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one nice thing that came out of this," Crawford said. "The
city has a driving range for its residents, and we were happy to do
that for them."</TE>
<TE>   The director, who has developed a reputation for making changes
within Nevada's prison system, said golf for convicts won't be one of
the changes. "But what we are going to do is make contributions to
the community, give something back to the community."</TE>
<TE>   Besides community service, inmates at the minimum-security Tonopah
camp serve on state Forestry Division crews.</TE>

<HD>Parolees Stymied in Bid for Normalcy</HD>
<DH>Justice: Every year, 400,000 parents are released from
prison. Many face legal obstacles as they try to rebuild their lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID CRARY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>If parole officers wrote a textbook called "How to Go Straight,"
Derek Ingram would merit a mention.</LD>
<LD>   Convicted at age 16 for his role in a 1971 gang killing, he left
prison in 1976, kept his record spotless and earned glowing
references during a 24-year career as an orderly and nursing
assistant at health-care facilities in and around Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   But when a background check in March 2001 turned up his
second-degree murder conviction, he was summarily fired by a hospital
that had eagerly hired him three months earlier. He has been unable
to get another health-care job.</LD>
<TE>   The firing demoralized Ingram, forced him to cut back on child
support for his twin 6-year-old daughters and dashed hopes of getting
medical coverage that would ensure quality care for the girls'
chronic health problems.</TE>
<TE>   "This is truly affecting very innocent people," he wrote in June
in a long-shot application for a pardon to clear his record. "It is
horrible when you cannot meet the needs of your children."</TE>
<TE>   According to advocacy groups working with ex-offenders, the number
of parents getting out of prison has grown to about 400,000 a year.
Many--like Ingram--face legal obstacles as they try to rebuild their
lives and families.</TE>
<TE>   The scope of those obstacles is detailed in a comprehensive new
report by two advocacy groups--the Center for Law and Social Policy
in Washington and Community Legal Services Inc. of Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "As these parents struggle to make a fresh start, they will
encounter a myriad of legal barriers that will make it
extraordinarily difficult for them to succeed in caring for their
children, finding work, getting safe housing," says the report,
titled "Every Door Closed."</TE>
<TE>   The barriers include state and federal laws, mostly enacted within
the last two decades. "Every Door Closed" acknowledges that genuine
public safety concerns are behind the laws, but the report urges
authorities to apply them with discretion.</TE>
<TE>   "Cumulatively, these civil consequences of a criminal record can
be devastating and will continue to punish an ex-offender--and his or
her family--long after his or her formal sentence has been served."</TE>
<TE>   Among the barriers detailed in the report:</TE>
<TE>   * Employment: Criminal records often result in bans against
working in certain types of jobs. In Illinois, for example, more than
50 job categories are off-limits to ex-offenders, including being a
barber or working around children. "You can't wash windows at a
school or clean the grounds at a hospital," said Rep. Danny K. Davis
(D-Ill.), who wants Congress to do more to help ex-convicts stay
straight.</TE>
<TE>   * Housing: Backed by federal law, many local housing authorities
refuse to allow ex-offenders into subsidized housing projects, which
sometimes are the only affordable option for low-income families.
Although some housing officials mostly try to exclude violent
criminals, others extend the bans to people convicted of car theft,
disorderly conduct and misdemeanor drug possession.</TE>
<TE>   * Child welfare: Parents who serve more than a brief prison term
may risk losing their parental rights, especially when children are
placed in foster care rather than with a relative. Under the federal
Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, parental rights can be
terminated if a child has been in foster care 15 of the previous 22
months.</TE>
<TE>   * Public benefits: The 1996 federal welfare reform law imposes a
lifetime ban on welfare and food stamps for people with felony drug
convictions, regardless of any progress toward rehabilitation. Though
30 states have lifted or modified the ban, it remains in effect
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Donna Gathright, who served six months in prison after her 1991
arrest for selling marijuana in Lebanon, Pa., relied on welfare
benefits after her release to care for two young children. She would
have been ineligible for benefits under the 1996 welfare law, and
testified against the ban last year in Pennsylvania's Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "Being able to get welfare when I needed it made it possible for
me to change my life," said Gathright, whose current job includes
counseling imprisoned women. "The women I work with now need help
just as much as I needed it."</TE>
<TE>   One of the harshest consequences of Gathright's conviction was
losing her driver's license for seven years. Upon release, the only
job she could find was a night job across town; she had to walk to
work.</TE>
<TE>   "That was an awful barrier," she said. "If you live in a rural
community and you work a second-shift or third-shift job, good luck."</TE>
<TE>   Gathright persevered, earning an associate degree at a community
college, marrying, and getting a job at a battered women's shelter
that she enjoys despite the low pay: $7.75 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   At age 38, she would like to get a better-paying job but fears her
criminal record will be an obstacle--for example, if she sought work
in drug rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy doing what I'm doing, but the pay is shelter pay," she
said. "To get any of the good jobs, that might be impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Vicki Turetsky, an attorney with the Center for Law and Social
Policy, said interest in helping ex-offender parents seems to be
increasing as many state governments rethink hard-line policies that
caused prison populations to soar in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   She notes bipartisan support for programs promoting fatherhood in
low-income communities. Many of the men targeted by these programs
have criminal records, but authorities are realizing that helping
them also can help strengthen families, Turetsky said.</TE>
<TE>   "For mothers and fathers, very often the only thing that gets them
through prison is thinking how to do right by their kids," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The report includes scores of recommendations for improving the
chances of an ex-offender to succeed as a spouse and parent. Among
them:</TE>
<TE>   * Allow ex-offenders to receive public benefits, unless their
crime involved fraudulent receipt of benefits.</TE>
<TE>   * Require public housing authorities to examine admissions and
evictions on a case-by-case basis so families of offenders--in
particular their children--aren't unduly penalized.</TE>
<TE>   * Promote contact between imprisoned parents and their children so
that chances for reunification are maximized.</TE>
<TE>   * Avoid rigid criteria in determining when parental rights should
be terminated.</TE>
<TE>   * Avoid rigid, broad bans on ex-offenders working in certain
occupations.</TE>
<TE>   * Make it easier for rehabilitated ex-offenders to clear their
records.</TE>
<TE>   Either of the last two recommendations might help Ingram, who
blames his inability to get a new health-care job on a 1998 state law
that bans any convicted felon from jobs caring for older people.</TE>
<TE>   "It's eating away at my soul," he said. "I can't even feel
comfortable visiting with my kids now. I'm suffering and they're
suffering."</TE>
<TE>   Ingram, 47, has resorted to working in a warehouse more than two
hours from his home, earning $8.25 an hour, without benefits. His
hospital job paid $11 an hour, plus benefits.</TE>
<TE>   His main source of hope is a legal challenge that he and Community
Legal Services are mounting against the 1998 state law.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, after I was terminated, I felt like a punch-drunk
boxer," he said. "Now, I want to fight back."</TE>
<TE>   Ingram also hopes the state Board of Pardons will approve his bid
to clear his record, though his attorney, Sharon Dietrich, said the
chances are slim.</TE>
<TE>   Dietrich said Ingram is among many ex-offenders whose chances for
getting jobs, loans and decent housing have been hampered by recent
state laws.</TE>
<TE>   "People like Derek, who thought they'd made it," she said, "are
finding what they did decades ago coming back to haunt them."</TE>

<HD>North Dakotans Are Cool to Global Warming</HD>
<DH>Climate: Farmers conditioned by state's variable weather
react with indifference to government's call for adaptation to
change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MALCOLM RITTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA MOURE, N.D.</DL>
<LD>The federal government says that global warming has begun, and that
it will change the conditions that farmers like Larry Sandness deal
with as they raise crops.</LD>
<LD>   But Sandness, who's seen a lot of weather while farming for more
than a quarter-century here, isn't so sure about that.</LD>
<LD>   Not that the weather hasn't been a little weird. For about a
decade, Sandness and his neighbors have enjoyed unusually long
growing seasons and abundant summer rain -- which fits in with the
kinds of changes global-warming experts are forecasting for this
region.</LD>
<TE>   Some farmers have compared it to the corn belt. Sandness' crops
were great last year.</TE>
<TE>   Then the climatic gravy train stopped. Take that day in May, for
example, when Sandness had to stop planting corn ... because it was
snowing.</TE>
<TE>   "Where is this global warming they're talking about?" he joked to
his wife, Karen.</TE>
<TE>   The cold also stunned a corn crop Sandness had already planted on
another field. There, most seedlings sputtered and died by late May
without breaking the surface, having put out little leaves that never
saw the sun.</TE>
<TE>   So he replanted that field and saw shoots come up in six days --
just in time to encounter a wicked drought. By July 4, in fields
around La Moure, dried-up heads of wheat were waving like little
white tombstones, corn leaves were folding in the afternoon as if
praying for rain, and if you stepped on the yellowed grass, it went
"crunch."</TE>
<TE>   But shortly after July 4, the rain came. One farmer found fields
with whitecaps. It was too late to help the wheat and barley. But
that and later rains made farmers optimistic that corn, soybean and
sunflower yields will be normal.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Sandness and his wife are skeptical that global
warming has arrived here yet or will in the future. "We know it could
be happening," Karen Sandness said. But recalling the cold May, she
added: "When you don't see it affecting you day to day, it's real
tough to take it seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Fact is, you hear comments like that over and over again if you
bring up the topic with farmers around La Moure, a place of rolling
prairie where deer gracefully hop fences and white pelicans glide
along the muddy James River.</TE>
<TE>   The fact also is that you'll have to bring it up, because it's
just not something farmers around here chat about when they play
early-morning card games at the Dairy Bar Cafe, or share the shade
behind the backstop at a late afternoon baseball game for the kids.
Mostly, as with Sandness, it's just the butt of a joke on a cold day.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where this global warming comes from," said Dan
Stroh, 58, who raises soybeans, corn and wheat on a place he took
over from his father in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had hot summers; we've had cool summers ... I think it's
just somebody trying to start something."</TE>
<TE>   But couldn't it show up in the future? "If I was guessing," he
said after plucking a tick off his border collie, "I'd say no."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Frauenberg, 44, starts each day by consulting the weather data
and forecasts that stream into his satellite dish. But he recalls
that the snow-filled winter of 1997 seemed like the front door to an
ice age, while this past June and early July were frying his bean
crops. So who can tell about the future?</TE>
<TE>   "Mother Nature, she's a woman," he concluded. "You ain't gonna
tell her what to do. And she ain't gonna tell you what she's gonna
do."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, a cold snap doesn't disprove the idea of global warming
any more than a few hot summers prove it. North Dakota's climate is
notoriously variable, and nobody is claiming that human-induced
climate change will suddenly turn it into the tropics.</TE>
<TE>   But the federal government insists that American farmers will
increasingly have to contend with the effects of global warming. In a
report to the United Nations last May, the government said that if
farmers can adapt, the changing climate may actually increase the
nation's farm productivity for at least the next several decades.
Yields of cotton, soybeans, wheat, barley and other crops could rise.</TE>
<TE>   Here in North Dakota, the government says, global warming could
raise temperatures by maybe 3 degrees in the summertime over the next
century, and 4 degrees in other seasons. Precipitation could rise by
10% in summer and perhaps 25% in the winter.</TE>
<TE>   North Dakota farmers might encounter more variability in climate,
making adaptation more difficult, the analysis says. They might
actually have to irrigate more because of increased evaporation. But
yields on the wheat, barley and hay crops might rise marginally, the
government concludes.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's tough to get excited about projections of
temperature and precipitation that cover 100 years. Critics say that
precipitation projections are especially suspect, and that projected
temperature increases are tiny compared to the year-to-year
variability in the state's climate.</TE>
<TE>   And talk of statewide averages doesn't mean much in a summer like
this one, when a farmer near La Moure could stand by his bone-dry
rain gauge in early July and see dark blue clouds about to drop a
load just an hour's drive away.</TE>
<TE>   If the federal government wants farmers to adapt, the folks around
La Moure got plenty of practice in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   It was "just about bliss in farming," said Frauenberg, who racked
up several awards for his corn yields. "We've been growing crops just
like down in the corn belt .... It's been awesome."</TE>
<TE>   The growing season expanded by 10 days, with the killing frost
delayed to early October rather than mid-September, said Al Ulmer,
the La Moure County agent.</TE>
<TE>   And rain was abundant. During the growing season, Ulmer said, the
county's rainfall often averaged 13 or 14 inches rather than about 9
inches. Even when the total wasn't particularly high, rain just
seemed to come along at the right time for crops.</TE>
<TE>   "For 10 years we didn't have to consider dryness, and dryness is a
way of life in North Dakota," said organic farmer and gardener David
Podoll, who believes global warming has arrived on the Plains.</TE>
<TE>   The extra moisture made Sandness abandon sunflowers. The extra
rain encouraged a lethal mold in that crop. It also led to more
cattail plants around the countryside, which in turn attracted
blackbirds, which sat on sunflowers and picked out seeds, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, poor wheat prices made him turn away from that crop,
which was also suffering moisture-related disease around the county.
So he moved into corn and soybeans instead, and he wasn't alone. La
Moure County had about 8,300 acres of soybeans in 1993, but about
150,000 acres last year, Ulmer said. And acreage in corn jumped from
less than 5,000 acres to more than 100,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Corn and soybeans can be profitable, but corn requires lots of
moisture, and soybeans must have it at critical times. Both also
thrive in warm weather and longer growing seasons, so the new climate
regime encouraged farmers to go after them. Besides moisture and crop
prices, the shift was also driven by corn hybrids more suitable for
North Dakota, and farm payment provisions of the 1995 farm program,
Ulmer said. Farmers adjusted to those changes too.</TE>
<TE>   What now? As they contemplated the dry months of this summer,
Stroh and Sandness said they might go back to raising sunflowers if
the dry years return. Sandness said a prolonged dry spell might
persuade him to take up no-till farming, a technique that preserves
soil moisture by disturbing the earth as little as possible.</TE>
<TE>   As for global warming, Stroh is pragmatic: "We'll just live with
whatever comes and deal with it then. Whether it comes or not, you go
on."</TE>

<HD>Grown-Ups Drawn to 'Lame Games'</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Kids' games like kickball are edging out
extreme sports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELISSA TRUJILLO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>In the 1990s, adults "grinded" on inline skates and "shredded" on
snowboards. They were extreme.</LD>
<LD>   These days, many are kicking red rubber balls, swinging plastic
bats and jumping rope just like ... well, kids.</LD>
<LD>   Move over extreme games. Wiffle ball, kickball, dodge ball, even
jump rope are becoming increasingly popular with adults.</LD>
<TE>   Darby O'Brien calls them "lame games." The Massachusetts
advertising executive predicted they would be the next trend in adult
recreation after the extreme games craze. He should know; he
predicted that trend too.</TE>
<TE>   Lame games, he said, are providing a simple, much-needed break
from complicated lives.</TE>
<TE>   Angus Durocher of San Francisco started a kickball league of
primarily dot-com workers almost two years ago. Before the industry's
bust, the league had about 20 teams playing on a weekly schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all working 80-hour weeks," Durocher said. "It was an
exciting time, but we were definitely all spending way too much time
at our computers."</TE>
<TE>   Kickball, he said, gives his players simplicity in their changing
business.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just something fun and stupid to do," he said. "And it
doesn't technically require you to put your beer down when you're in
the outfield."</TE>
<TE>   Lame games also allow adults to forget the uncertainties of the
economy and the war on terrorism, O'Brien said.</TE>
<TE>   "People aren't as open to looking forward, especially now,"
O'Brien said from South Hadley, Mass., where he publishes "The Gut,"
a quarterly trade publication that predicts national trends. "There's
some comfort in playing kickball."</TE>
<TE>   That's why Ervin Reynoso started a kickball league in Seattle this
spring. Four teams, made up mostly of 20-somethings, played the first
season at a neighborhood elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not threatening at all," Reynoso said about the sport. "I
think most people associate it with good memories from elementary
school."</TE>
<TE>   In Schaumburg, Ill., dodge ball has become a way for adults not
only to remember but to relive their childhood. More than 300 adults
played in the third-annual National Amateur Dodge ball Assn.
championship tournament in early August.</TE>
<TE>   The league's first championship team, the Bexley Reckers, even
have a children's attitude about team uniforms. The men wore bike
shorts and tank tops the first year of the tournament, Speedo swim
trunks and cutoff tank tops the next and white sports bras and short
shorts this year.</TE>
<TE>   But for all the silliness, lame games are competitive.</TE>
<TE>   The United States Amateur Jump Rope Federation had to create an
adult division after so many expressed interest in competitively
jumping rope. About 80 adults compete in the league's
30-years-and-older division. Some are in their 60s. They jump for
speed or complete tricks, sometimes while jumping double-dutch.</TE>
<TE>   "They're still doing practically all the events," executive
director Bud Pickett said. "They're jumping to win."</TE>
<TE>   And while their scores are lower than their younger counterparts,
they can still compete. Although the sport, especially the speed
events, are dominated by youngsters, a few of the grand national
champions from the USA Jump Rope National Tournament were from the
over-18 division.</TE>
<TE>   For many, participating in "lame games" is the last chance to be
competitive. Maybe they've lost some speed after years with a
softball team. Or maybe they haven't played organized sports since
high school and are out of shape.</TE>
<TE>   In Wiffle ball, experienced athletes can be outplayed by couch
potatoes. The game is played with a plastic ball designed to twist
and curve. It's similar to baseball, except the batting team has
ghost runners who advance according to where the ball is hit.</TE>
<TE>   There's no running, so players don't need speed, and no deep
center fields, so the weakest player can hit home runs. And Wiffle
balls can't be thrown as fastballs, so there's no need for arm
strength.</TE>
<TE>   "We realize it's not baseball," said Jeff Delma, commissioner of
the Washington State Wiffleball Assn. "It's Wiffle ball, a stupid
plastic ball. Games are real competitive, but it's so ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   For Delma, that's the true beauty of sports like Wiffle ball.
There's a perfect balance of competition and silliness, seriousness
and laughter.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to win," he said, "but we're going to bring a big cooler
with us and a lot of grilled meat."</TE>

<HD>Manute Bol Back in U.S. -- as a Refugee</HD>
<DH>Sports: Ex-NBA player pays a heavy price for activism in
his war-torn Sudanese homeland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LUO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST HARTFORD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Manute Bol lopes across the lawn toward his house, covering the
distance in a few giant strides.</LD>
<LD>   At 42, Bol's joints ache from rheumatism, but he still carries his
7-foot-7 frame erect and proud. His face is a little fuller than it
was during his years in the NBA, when his celebrity and singular
ability to block shots earned him millions.</LD>
<LD>   The money is gone. The house he lives in is sparsely furnished;
the furniture, slightly ragged. The rent is paid by Catholic
Charities, a group that helps political refugees. That's what Bol is
now.</LD>
<TE>   He moved here with his wife, son and half-sister a few months ago,
having finally made the painful decision to leave the Sudanese
homeland that he loved but could not find a place in anymore. He
ended up making a daring escape, complicated by the Sept. 11 terror
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Bol never forgot Sudan during the years of wealth and fame. He
couldn't, he says.</TE>
<TE>   That cost him nearly everything.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manute Bol was born in Turalie, a remote village in the southern
part of Sudan, a nation where, during the last 19 years, civil war
has left 2 million people dead. Most casualties have been in the
south, where Christian and animist rebels battle a northern Islamic
government, based in Khartoum.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Sudan is the home of the Dinkas, the tallest people in
the world and Bol's tribe. Bol was the tallest man ever to play in
the NBA, until Gheorghe Muresan, a Romanian with a pituitary gland
condition, beat him out by a few centimeters.</TE>
<TE>   Bol's grandfather, Bol Chol, reputed to be 7-feet-10, was a
powerful chieftain and had 40 wives. Bol's father, Madut Bol, was
only 6-feet-8 but had seven wives and a large cattle herd -- a sign
of great wealth. His second wife, Okwok, was 6-feet-10. After having
stillborn twins twice, she gave birth to Manute, whose name means
"blessing from God."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his city-dwelling cousins, Bol never went to school.
Instead, he herded goats and cattle.</TE>
<TE>   When he was 15, at the suggestion of relatives, he gave basketball
a try. Bol walked three days from his village to join his first team.</TE>
<TE>   An American college basketball coach, in Sudan for a summer,
learned of the tall athlete and soon arranged for Bol and a
translator friend to fly to the United States in 1982. Bol wound up
at the University of Bridgeport.</TE>
<TE>   Games at the small Connecticut school's 1,800-seat gymnasium
suddenly became packed, frenzied events.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, Bol blocked 15 shots a game and averaged 22.5 points. He
made Division II All-American.</TE>
<TE>   After just a year at Bridgeport, Bol joined the Rhode Island
Gulls, a pro team in the United States Basketball League. A few
months later, he was picked up by the Washington Bullets in the NBA
draft.</TE>
<TE>   Many speculated that Bol's 205-pound frame couldn't take the
wear-and-tear of the NBA. But Bol ran away with the league title in
blocked shots with 397 in 1985, the second highest total in league
history.</TE>
<TE>   During the next 10 years, Bol cycled through four different teams,
the Bullets, the Golden State Warriors, the Philadelphia 76ers and
the Miami Heat.</TE>
<TE>   Bol was essentially a one-dimensional player, averaging just 2.6
points and 4.2 rebounds a game, but he lived the NBA high life,
making $1.6 million a year at one point.</TE>
<TE>   His loopy sense of humor and accented trash talking, full of
hilarious malapropisms, made him popular among his teammates. But he
remained a stranger in his adopted land.</TE>
<TE>   A knee injury in 1994 relegated Bol briefly to the Continental
Basketball Assn. and then to a league in Italy. It seemed he would
just retire and enjoy his earnings.</TE>
<TE>   But his heart was still in Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bol visited his native country regularly -- nearly every summer
during his NBA career.</TE>
<TE>   On one of his early trips, he met and married his first wife,
Atong, then 18, a southern Sudanese refugee.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in 1991, Bol began making visits to southern Sudanese
refugee camps. Many of Bol's relatives were leaders in the Sudanese
People's Liberation Army, the rebel movement.</TE>
<TE>   He became an important backer of the rebels, contributing an
estimated $3.5 million. Bol and his cousin Ed Bona, a former college
basketball player at Fordham, met with dozens of members of Congress,
warning of Muslim extremists and begging for American intervention.</TE>
<TE>   Hope came in 1996, when a group of southern Sudanese split from
the SPLA to sign a cease-fire with the government. A leader of the
splinter group invited Bol to join a government delegation in talks
with the SPLA in Kenya.</TE>
<TE>   Despite accusations of betrayal, Bol flew to Nairobi.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, the talks collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Bol returned to Khartoum, where the government, promising more
talks later, offered him a post as minister of sport. Their offer was
conditional, however. He would need to become a Muslim first. A
Christian since childhood, Bol refused.</TE>
<TE>   As time passed with no progress toward peace, Bol began to feel
used. On visits to refugee camps, he told his people that there was
still hope, even though he didn't think so.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to say it for my safety," he says.</TE>
<TE>   A lone bright spot was his second marriage, to Ajok, a tall
21-year-old. (Bol's first marriage had soured. Atong later remarried
and moved to New Jersey with their four children.) Bol met Ajok
through her father, an SPLA leader. In the Dinka tradition, Bol paid
150 cows for her. Soon, they had a son, Bol Manute.</TE>
<TE>   In August 1998, Bol was sitting on his roof in Khartoum to escape
the heat when an explosion half a mile away lighted up the night sky,
followed by 15 to 20 more.</TE>
<TE>   President Clinton had ordered the cruise missile strike on a
Sudanese pharmaceutical plant suspected of aiding the manufacture of
chemical weapons. It was retaliation for the bombings of American
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, linked by U.S. officials to Osama
bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   Worried for his family's safety, the attack was a turning point
for Bol. The government accused him of being a spy, he says.</TE>
<TE>   He tried to leave in 1999 but the government stopped him. His
money dwindled as he supported himself and as many as 20 relatives.</TE>
<TE>   On his second attempt in 2001, Bol marched to the immigration
office and demanded an exit visa. An officer told him to come back
with a bribe.</TE>
<TE>   Bol peddled his furniture. Meanwhile, in Connecticut, friends
swung into action, buying plane tickets in London and secretly
shipping them to Bol via a travel agent in Khartoum.</TE>
<TE>   In July 2001, Bol, his wife, son and half-sister, Achuil, then 9,
flew to Cairo, with the idea of going on to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In Egypt, U.S. consulate officials explained he needed to apply
for refugee status if he wanted to bring his entire family. Bol
settled in to wait.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sept. 11. Bol thought of the warnings he'd given to
members of Congress on Islamic extremism. It wasn't until March 7,
nearly six months after his arrival, that Bol's family finally
departed, catching flights that brought them to Hartford.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Today, friends are shopping around a screenplay on Bol's life in
two very different worlds.</TE>
<TE>   He has made a few public appearances, for small fees, and plans to
petition the NBA to give him an advance on his NBA pension, roughly
$24,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   His height remains an access pass -- and his strange celebrity was
underscored in one especially strange event.</TE>
<TE>   Fox TV's Celebrity Boxing show invited him to fight another
oversized athlete from an earlier era, William "The Refrigerator"
Perry.</TE>
<TE>   Bol agreed to the bout, so long as Fox agreed to air a toll-free
number for the Ring True Foundation, a West Hartford-based charity he
set up to benefit southern Sudanese children. He donated his $35,000
fight fee to the group.</TE>
<TE>   Bol's trainer told him to keep his distance from Perry, a former
NFL lineman. But Bol went after him -- and won the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Manute Bol doesn't mind being a spectacle, he says, as long as it
means helping his people.</TE>
<TE>   Though relieved to be out of Sudan now, he still dreams of
returning home. His ideal retirement would be split between the
countries he's called home.</TE>
<TE>   "I want my country to be like this someday," he says. "This is my
dream."</TE>
<TE>   That way, he could settle down on a farm and go back to herding
cows.</TE>

<HD>'We Can't Let the Bad Guys Win'</HD>
<DH>Terror: A Sept. 11 survivor's message to loved ones was
e-mailed around the world. A year later, he reflects on what he has
learned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM MAYBLUM</AU>
<BD>FOR THE ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Editor's note: Adam Mayblum was working for the May Davis Group
investment firm on the 87th floor of the World Trade Center's north
tower when the first plane hit on Sept. 11. He escaped down a
stairwell with a wet piece of T-shirt around his face. The day after
the terrorist attacks, he wrote an e-mail to friends and family
totell them he was safe. It was forwarded around the world and
Mayblum received thousands of responses from people he'd never met.
Now Mayblum, 36, of New Rochelle, N.Y., shares his thoughts.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the soldiers in the barracks in Lebanon or the heroes of
the Normandy landings know what "it" is like. But, then again, they
were professionals. They knew that they were in harm's way 24/7. We
were professionals of a different sort. Lawyers. Bankers. Brokers.
Traders. Waiters.</LD>
<LD>   I was having my daily iced coffee. Light with skim and two Equals.
Then "it" arrived. Hell on Earth. It was an hour-and-a-half climb
down 87 crowded, hot and smoky flights. It was fires and sparks and
doors that wouldn't open. It was stepping over twisted steel and God
knows what else. It was losing dear friends.</LD>
<TE>   I look back at the attack as a whole event unto itself. Not the
thousands of little occurrences along the way. The attack and its
consequences are of such a magnitude that I still cannot fully absorb
it. I think I am better off that way.</TE>
<TE>   I do, however, have some demons to deal with. There are those two
events that won't go away. I remember seeing my friend Harry Ramos
helping people out of one stairwell while I was helping them into
another. What would I have done if I knew then that it was the last
time I would see him? Would he have done it anyway if he knew he
wasn't going to make it home that night? Did he know that he was
crossing that fine line between bravery and death? Did he even think
about it? I doubt it. None of us did. But in hindsight, I get to ask
these questions and he doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the third floor. Almost out. Almost home. I can
almost smell the fresh air. And then there was that rumbling. That
low vibration I could feel in my bones, followed by this
inconceivable shaking. Then the lights went out. Pitch black except
for some glow-in-the-dark paint and a flashlight.</TE>
<TE>   It was, in reality, the World Trade Center's south tower
collapsing. But in my world, at that very moment, I was sure it was
my stairwell collapsing down upon me under the weight of thousands of
people. I was going to die. All I could do was shrug my shoulders,
look up at the stairs above, and wait for the pain. Then it passed. A
miracle, I thought. It turns out that my miracle was also the death
of more than a thousand people. Almost a year later, I cannot hear
(feel) a train roll by without a flashback.</TE>
<TE>   I have been told that sometimes a person learns things that cannot
be unlearned. I have learned that I am not safe anywhere or at any
time. Who would have thought that the opening salvo in a war would be
a 767 slamming into the office during breakfast?</TE>
<TE>   This knowledge has changed me forever. I don't step out into
traffic anymore. I drive slower, more cautiously. I guess this will
fade with time. On the other hand, I am more focused and driven than
ever. I even learned to ski.</TE>
<TE>   I just started working at a new firm, just a few blocks from
ground zero. I will not be chased from there. It is my statement to
the terrorists. I work in The Financial Capital of The World. You
have not destroyed us.</TE>
<TE>   If I had my way, I would rebuild the trade center as it was, if
not taller. What better memorial is there to those who perished that
day? My friends were proud to work there. They were the embodiment of
capitalism and America. From the traders to the waiters, we all knew
that we were part of something special.</TE>
<TE>   Life goes on. My wife and I are expecting another child in
October. Why? Because now we live a little more for today than
tomorrow. Because we can't let the bad guys win. Because we love each
other. Because people we knew can't. Because when I hold my son,
Ethan, nothing else matters, and I want more of that feeling in my
life.</TE>

<HD>Secret Eyes Spying on Manhattan</HD>
<DH>Technology: Outraged resident gives tours of borough's
surveillance cameras, most of which belong to private companies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED SHAFFREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>As if there weren't enough reasons to look over your shoulder in New
York City these days, take a walk through Midtown with surveillance
camera tour guide Bill Brown. He'll give you dozens more excuses to
be anxious.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm just an average person who is trying to figure out what is
going on in the city I was born in and love," explained Brown, a
Brooklyn native. "I don't think I'm paranoid -- I think the people
who are paranoid fill the streets with cameras."</LD>
<LD>   Part performance artist, part privacy advocate, Brown, 43, a
free-lance copy editor, has been giving free walking tours of
Manhattan's most camera-dense neighborhoods on Sundays for the last
two years.</LD>
<TE>   Focusing on such areas as Times Square, Chelsea, the United
Nations, Washington Square Park and Fifth Avenue, Brown tells his
tour groups there are roughly 5,000 cameras watching the streets of
Manhattan. And those are just the ones he can see.</TE>
<TE>   Standing on 16th Street between Eighth and Ninth avenues, he
points out 16 cameras Most are easy to spot.</TE>
<TE>   "This block is a kind of an open-air museum of different cameras,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown says 90% of Manhattan's surveillance cameras belong to
private companies concerned about protecting property and lower
insurance rates.</TE>
<TE>   Others, he claims, are police cameras -- such as one at Eighth
Avenue and 14th Street, which at first glance looks like a
streetlight.</TE>
<TE>   Police don't dispute his claim, but won't discuss their methods.
"Any security-related issues we don't comment on," said Officer John
Sullivan, a spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Sunday, Brown did a little dance in front of one
camera, holding up a copy of the Constitution -- which he claims
outlaws such surveillance. He then smacked an eye-level sticker on
the pole that read: "You Are Being Watched, Surveillance Camera
Notice."</TE>
<TE>   He went through a similar routine in front of the city's traffic
light-scofflaw cameras at Ninth Avenue and 20th Street, and yet again
outside an office of American District Telegraph, a 130-year-old
international electronic security provider.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Volinski, Manhattan sales manager for ADT, is unabashed
about surveillance cameras.</TE>
<TE>   He says the closed-circuit TV monitoring industry is growing by
15% a year. Companies install cameras primarily to let employees know
someone is watching and to record activity in and around their
premises, Volinski said.</TE>
<TE>   "I can show you equipment through which you can look in at what's
going on at your company's Puerto Rican or California headquarters --
not to mention your own front door," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's tours, which are free, attract only a handful of people.
Even on his best days, Brown says, he draws only about a dozen. He
doesn't advertise, but he does place items in local newspaper
calendars and publicize the tours on his Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Volpe of Brooklyn, who signed up for Brown's tour after seeing
his Web site, was dismayed by the surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disturbing. It's symptomatic of our civil liberties and
privacy being encroached upon," Volpe said.</TE>
<TE>   The same tour group included a German television crew, portraying
Brown as a lonely voice of outrage against the Patriot Act, a
post-Sept. 11 law that broadened government surveillance powers.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said his tours are partly based on a list of surveillance
cameras compiled by the New York Civil Liberties Union.</TE>
<TE>   "When you can't walk down the block without someone capturing you
on camera you lose your anonymity, your privacy, whether it's from
the government or private entities," said Donna Lieberman, executive
director of the NYCLU.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone, Brown said, has something they'd rather keep to
themselves, whether it's a tryst, a political opinion, a cry or a
drunken fall.</TE>
<TE>   One large camera, pointing down on 16th Street, particularly
disturbed Brown during a recent tour.</TE>
<TE>   "This one is predatory, raptor-like," he said. "It epitomizes what
is even the aggressive language of cameras -- you 'shoot' something,
you 'capture' something."</TE>

<HD>Tall Ship's Restoration Sets Sail on Love</HD>
<DH>History: Devoted volunteers refurbish the 100-year-old
Gazela, a former Portugese fishing vessel. They hope to finish by
November.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL BERGSTROM</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Surrounded by plentiful ash and cedar trees in the 1700s,
Philadelphia was a shipbuilding center to rival New England, but got
an assist from the Pacific Coast with its latest tall ship repair.</LD>
<LD>   A new lower mizzen mast for the three-masted Gazela arrived on
Pier 40 as part of a refurbishing job that will return the ship's
105-foot-tall silhouette to Philadelphia's waterfront by November.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Philadelphia Ship Preservation Guild -- the
nonprofit group of about 150 members who repair, caulk, scrape,
paint, scrub and sail the Gazela -- watched a crane unload the log,
an 80-foot Douglas fir, from a railroad flatcar.</LD>
<TE>   Weyerhaeuser, a timber company, donated the 8,000-pound log,
chalk-marked "GAZELA SPAR" on the end; CSX Corp. shipped it
cross-country for free; and the services of the crane were donated in
the kind of promotional coordinating feat the group must pull off
regularly to operate a more-than-a-century-old wooden ship long past
its moneymaking days.</TE>
<TE>   "I was there for the arrival of the big stick," said Bobby
Flemming, one of the volunteers who donate hard labor to keep the
ship afloat and maintained. The volunteers count every hour because
the payoff is a chance of adventure aboard the 177-foot-long former
Portuguese fishing vessel as it plies East Coast ports and makes sea
voyages to Newfoundland and Bermuda.</TE>
<TE>   "She can be out for months on end," said Scott Cointot, 32, who
has been sailing on Gazela since 1985 and has been one of its
captains for the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   A tugboat operator in his paying job, Cointot looked forward to
resuming sailing trips on the Gazela after two years of refurbishing.</TE>
<TE>   While the Douglas fir is crafted into a lower section for a mast
damaged by rot and carpenter ants, new deck beams and planking are
being fashioned by paid shipwrights. Volunteers work in a barge
alongside, where the ship's bell and its varnished, spoked, wheel
hang from the ceiling ready to install.</TE>
<TE>   Kvaerner Philadelphia Shipyard also decided to help, sandblasting
and applying three coats of tough white paint to the steel cabin that
sits on deck and houses the galley with its huge iron oil-burning
stove. Kvaerner also supplied three new water tanks and a holding
tank installed during the project.</TE>
<TE>   The group hoped to finish in time to sail the ship up the Delaware
River for a festival in Bristol on Oct. 19, but a November completion
appears more likely, Cointot said.</TE>
<TE>   The festival appearance is quite a contrast to 70 years of
grueling sails -- until 1969 -- from Portugal to the Grand Banks
fishing grounds off Canada, when it would return loaded to the gills
with fish.</TE>
<TE>   Now the ship that hauled 350 tons of codfish sets sail for events
like the Operation Sail parade of tall ships in New York Harbor that
celebrated the nation's bicentennial.</TE>
<TE>   "She's been on all the Op-Sails, 1976, 1986, 1992 and 2000,"
Cointot said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, the ship was used for the filming of "Interview With a
Vampire" in New Orleans. And in spring 1999, Cointot sailed the
Gazela to Louisbourg, Nova Scotia, where it was used in making a
French film, "La Veuve de St. Pierre."</TE>
<TE>   The Gazela was chosen after the director declared the ship
"perfect" but made sure of two things -- that it could be towed by
men rowing in dories and that a horse could be lifted aboard for
essential scenes.</TE>
<TE>   The movie was another fund-raising coup, bringing in $40,000 that
paid for a new propeller shaft and propeller, and fixed a vibration
problem that had slowed the ship when traveling under engine power.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to repairs and maintenance in port, there's plenty of
work for volunteers on trips. Whenever the ship isn't under way,
Cointot said, "I have half the crew washing down the ship and half
doing rowing practice."</TE>
<TE>   "I've stood watch on her with sleet in my face," said Flemming,
69. She began volunteering on weekends or evenings after her job at a
bank, put in more time after she retired and earned her first trip,
from Miami along the Atlantic Coast to New England, in 2000.
Volunteers range from their teens to 80.</TE>
<TE>   "We invite people to come and try us before they join us. It's not
just a nice clean group where you can go to meetings and express
ideas," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "When the masts were taken out in December 2000, we were all down
here at 6 a.m. shoveling snow off the deck."</TE>
<TE>   Ed Stemmler, a University of Pennsylvania information-technology
team leader who coordinated the mast's donation and transportation,
said the Gazela owes it to "sheer generosity."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what I said," Stemmler said. "There's just the sense
of adventure in a person to think that they are helping a
100-year-old sailing ship in an age when everything else is steel and
powered by fuel."</TE>

<HD>A Diary of Voyages Aboard the Gazela</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Highlights of recollections by David Frantz, in charge of running the
Gazela's 1930s-vintage, four-cylinder, 11-inch bore diesel for a time
in the 1970s, published in the spring 1998 edition of "Sea History":</LD>
<LD>   4 July 1976: Nineteen tall ships and countless others pass in
review for President Ford, aboard USS Forrestal, there up beyond the
George Washington Bridge ... New York is suddenly like a small town
....</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   7 October 1976: We approach Bannister's Wharf in Newport at dead
slow. A full-astern bell comes down and two men lean on the reverse
lever. A mild shudder, stop, we eye each other. When finished with
engines ... we discover that the bowsprit has swept the wharf,
clearing it of some minor structures, but thanks to Gazela's
well-stocked boson's locker, the repair party is already at work. No
hard feelings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   13 October 1976: Arriving in Gloucester with little advance
notice, we ask the harbormaster if we can have a berth. "If an old
Banks fisherman can't find a place to tie up in Gloucester, that will
be the living end." We tie up alongside the Quincy Market Cold
Storage pier.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   9 June 1977: Heading south from New Bedford for New York ... I
wake up in the morning sure that we are becalmed; the motion below is
that of a ship in a dying sea. Poking my head out of the companionway
hatch I find us storming along, a 35-knot northeast breeze on the
quarter, lower topsail only, logging close to 10 knots. Beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   27 June 1978: Grant Gambell, the sailmaker, and I are furling the
mizzen topsail for the night when a pod of perhaps five whales
appears off the port bow on a collision course, preceded by a much
greater number of dolphins. The whole parade drops under us and
surfaces on the quarter, retreating into the advancing darkness.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   4 July 1978: Bill Gaynor is on the bowsprit when she takes green
water over the bow. Thanks to his harness, he stays with us but with
a badly sprained leg....It's a sad sight in the fo'c'sle; Bill
horizontal and the doctor losing his lunch into a No. 10 can while
ministering to the injured.</TE>

<DH>ESSAYS ON MUSIC, By Theodor W. Adorno, Edited by Richard
Leppert, Translated by Susan H. Gillespie and others, University of
California Press: 744 pp., $34.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Adam Kirsch is the author of the book of poems "The
Thousand Wells."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Given that whole careers are devoted to elucidating the thought of
Theodor W. Adorno, an interested neophyte reader might well approach
his work with trepidation. The ideal reader of his essays on music
would have a thorough knowledge of the classical repertoire since
Bach and philosophy since Kant as well as Adorno's other work, which
runs to 20 volumes in the German collected edition.</LD>
<LD>   Yet this new selection of Adorno's "Essays on Music," edited with
great skill by Richard Leppert, is designed to be accessible to the
serious general reader, who will be amply rewarded if he approaches
the book with patience. For even at his most abstract and
theoretical, Adorno's writing is always oriented toward real life.
Like Marx, he seeks to understand the world in order to change it.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Germany in 1903, Theodor Wiesengrund--he adopted his
mother's maiden name later in life--grew up in one of those Jewish
households that revered German culture. As a young man he studied
composition in Vienna, immersing himself in the challenging work of
Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg and the Second Viennese School. Though
he continued to compose avocationally throughout his life, Adorno
turned to scholarship, and by 1932 he was associated with the
Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt. Along with Walter
Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse and Max Horkheimer, Adorno would become one
of the powerful minds of the Frankfurt School, where critical
theory--a sophisticated application of Marxist thought to cultural
and social practices--was born.</TE>
<TE>   With Hitler's rise to power, the institute left Germany in 1934
for New York, where it became associated with Columbia University.
Adorno went to London. By 1938, he too had immigrated to America,
living first in New York and then, from 1941 to 1949, in Los Angeles,
where he joined Thomas Mann and Schoenberg in the local galaxy of
German emigres. Unlike those two, however, Adorno returned to Germany
after the war, settling in Frankfurt by 1953 and remaining there
until his death in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Adorno's time in Los Angeles was tremendously important for his
development: "I believe 90 percent of all I've published [since
returning to Germany]," he wrote in 1957, "was written in America."
To give an idea of the range of Adorno's interests, his Los Angeles
period produced not only major philosophical works such as "Dialectic
of Enlightenment," but also a book on composing for films and a
monograph analyzing the Los Angeles Times astrology column. At the
same time, he gave crucial assistance to Mann in the writing of
"Doctor Faustus."</TE>
<TE>   The paradox of Hollywood in the 1940s--Schoenberg on the one hand,
Louis B. Mayer on the other--is writ large in "Essays on Music." Most
of these pieces, which span his entire career, fall into two
categories: those dealing with popular music, which Adorno treats as
a commodity churned out by the "culture industry," and those dealing
with serious, or "classical" music, which has a genuine spiritual and
social function.</TE>
<TE>   Adorno regards music from a Marxist point of view: Culture is the
superstructure built on the foundation of economics, and inevitably
it reflects the injustice and alienation of society under capitalism.
But the focus of Adorno's analysis is not, as in classic Marxism, the
proletariat: It is the thinking individual.</TE>
<TE>   In the bourgeois 19th century, this individual, or "subject," was
in a heroic phase of struggle, hoping to reconcile individual freedom
and social justice. Music, especially that of Beethoven, expressed
this humane aspiration and marks a high point in the world's
spiritual history. The corruption of capitalism had not yet
permanently divided the artist from the ordinary listener. In the
20th century, the rise of monopoly capitalism and mass culture has
"colonized" the subject, turning the individual into an
interchangeable unit within an oppressive economic and cultural
system. As a result, serious music--that which expresses and
confronts the human predicament--is condemned to be difficult,
rebarbative, the pursuit of a few; while "light music," really a form
of mass distraction and false consciousness, seeps into the
subjectivity of almost everyone else. The analysis of the New Music
of Schoenberg and the critique of popular music forms such as jazz
are two parts of a single diagnosis.</TE>
<TE>   Adorno's essays on serious composers are the more difficult, since
they assume an extensive knowledge of European music, and are
frequently extravagantly theoretical and metaphorical. His thesis,
however, becomes clear: Music is at bottom an expressive art,
analogous to language, though it does not speak in concepts or
specifics. Rather, in a semi-mystical sense, "music tends toward pure
naming, the absolute unity of object and sign." But from Beethoven to
Schoenberg, composers increasingly felt that what they had to
express--the growing alienation of the individual in society--was at
odds with the musical language they inherited. Tonality and
traditional form became inadequate to the mounting sense of crisis
produced by capitalism.</TE>
<TE>   The composers Adorno admires confronted this disparity head-on and
addressed it either through parody--as did Mahler and, to a lesser
extent, Weill--or through a complete break with musical tradition, a
la Schoenberg, for whom Adorno has immense admiration. This new music
earns respect because it faces our true situation:</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody really believes in the 'culture' any more, the backbone of
spirit [Geist] has been broken, and anyone who pays no attention to
this and acts as though nothing had happened, must crawl like an
insect, not walk upright. The only authentic artworks produced today
are those that in their inner organization measure themselves by the
fullest experience of horror." But as T.S. Eliot wrote, "human kind
cannot bear very much reality." Most listeners want only to be
distracted and entertained, and so they flee from music that offers a
full experience of horror. The most authentic music is, almost
necessarily, the least popular. Music is "tolerated as the private
activity of specialists" but is prevented from becoming the
liberating force that Adorno believes it can and should be. As long
as society remains sick, music will be sick. As Adorno movingly says,
"the idea that music today could save itself with its own powers has
something absurd about it, while at the same time it can scarcely be
saved otherwise than with its own powers." But though serious music
is shriveling, popular music is spreading like a cancer, its
fecundity a proof of its morbidity. It is in his discussion of
popular music that most readers will take issue; indeed, even Leppert
is notably apologetic about some of Adorno's conclusions. But it is
exactly here that his critical intellect becomes most passionate and
exhilarating, and no one who reads these essays attentively will ever
look at popular culture the same way again.</TE>
<TE>   For Adorno, popular music is anti-music, a product shoved down the
throats of passive consumers by a culture industry devoted to profit.
It is not just a substitute for good music but a drug, a poison:
"Regressive, too, is the role which contemporary mass music plays in
the psychological household of its victims. They are not merely
turned away from more important music, but they are confirmed in
their neurotic stupidity.... "</TE>
<TE>   Whereas art music is demanding and enlightening, pop music is
formulaic and soothingly familiar: "The composition hears for the
listener." At the heart of this Marxist analysis is the idea that
such music is an opiate for the masses, encouraging a false and
unjustified pleasure in the midst of actual despair and alienation.
Enjoying jazz is a form of false consciousness: "The illusion of a
social preference for light music as against serious is based on that
passivity of the masses which makes the consumption of light music
contradict the objective interest of those who consume it." The
passion of this critique leads Adorno into penetrating, detailed
analysis of the way pop music is produced, sold and heard. Writing in
the 1930s and 1940s, he comes up with an analysis of "plugging"--the
selling of hit songs--that uncannily describes the Britney Spears
phenomenon. He convincingly explains the phenomenon of
"corniness"--the mockery of the trends of the recent past, familiar
to any watcher of "That '70s Show"--as a form of self-hatred:
"[L]ikes that have been enforced upon listeners provoke revenge the
moment the pressure is relaxed. They compensate for their 'guilt' in
having condoned the worthless by making fun of it."</TE>
<TE>   This analysis is bound to provoke resistance. Adorno neglects the
important category of irony, so central to our dealings with mass
culture, which allows us simultaneously to use and reject the
inferior products that surround us. He also refuses to see any
gradations in popular culture--what appears to us as the wit of the
Gershwins, the liberating improvisation of Louis Armstrong or the
authentic testimony of Billie Holiday vanishes for Adorno into a
thick slab of pablum.</TE>
<TE>   To some extent, this seems simply a bias in favor of the German
high culture in which he was raised. But even Adorno's approach to
serious music raises some questions: His idea of musical progress
seems to imply that every composer must contain and advance upon
every previous composer, a technological conception that certainly
does not hold true for, say, literature. Yet to read Adorno
dialectically--to respond actively, rather than consume passively--is
to remain true to the rational, liberating impulse of his work. As he
says about difficult music, Adorno's writing "demands the work and
effort of listening, the force of attention and memory, actually
love."</TE>

<HD>Will the Real Clint Eastwood Please Stand Up?</HD>
<DH>CLINT: The Life and Legend, by Patrick McGilligan, St.
Martin's Press: 612 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLEN BARRA</AU>
<BD>Allen Barra is the author of "Inventing Wyatt Earp: His
Life and Many Legends" and "Clearing the Bases: The Greatest Baseball
Debates of the Century." He is a sports columnist for the Wall Street
Journal and book critic for Salon.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twenty-odd years ago I was writing for a prominent New York weekly
paper with a bohemian-leftist slant. One day, while standing outside
the office of the arts editor, I was astonished to overhear a phone
conversation that included the editor, the paper's lead film critic
and actor-director Clint Eastwood, who had called to thank them for a
favorable review and invite them to a film festival where he was
appearing. I say I was astonished because the paper's unspoken policy
was to savage all Republicans, particularly Reagan Republicans, and
yet Eastwood's name was as sacred in the paper's arts section as
Jesse Jackson's was on the political pages.</LD>
<LD>   How, I wondered, did Eastwood do it? How did the man who made
government a dirty word in "The Outlaw Josey Wales" (1976) and whose
philosophy of law and order as expressed by "Dirty Harry" Callahan
delighted so many right-wingers seduce so many limousine liberals?</LD>
<LD>   Patrick McGilligan's "Clint: The Life and Legend" is the book that
tells you how he did it. Published in Great Britain, "Clint" has
apparently been bouncing around U.S. publishers amid rumors of
threats from Eastwood's lawyers. It isn't difficult to see why.
"Clint" is perhaps the most thoroughly demythologizing book yet
written on modern Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   Contrary to a carefully cultivated public image that practically
had him related to the Joads of "The Grapes of Wrath," the future
star was raised in thoroughly middle-class surroundings. Authorized
biographies have suggested that Clint left the Oakland area's
Piedmont High School because he had become, according to the official
bio written up by Eastwood's company, "acutely conscious that there
were no blacks in Piedmont, no Asians, only one or two Jewish
families." But the future Dirty Harry's departure from the high
school may have had more to do with what McGilligan characterizes as
"mounting delinquency."</TE>
<TE>   The man who would one day romanticize the Korean and Vietnam wars
in "Heartbreak Ridge" (1986) remained stateside as an Army swimming
instructor. Like John Wayne, he would eventually approve of the
Vietnam War; unlike Wayne, Eastwood "made his endorsement of the war
tacit, and refused to be pinned down." But the private lives of all
movie stars differ from fairy tale versions concocted for official
biographies. McGilligan's revelations of Eastwood's private life,
fascinating though they are, would be of only minor interest to film
fans if they didn't undermine the carefully constructed Eastwood
mythology, a brew so potent that even Clint's mother, in interviews,
seems to have sipped from it. (Though, as McGilligan points out, "If
Norman Mailer [in a profile in Parade magazine] can be forgiven for
swallowing the bunk, mothers above all should be allowed to stretch
the truth.") McGilligan reveals, step by step, how an actor of such
limited resources--his director in the so-called spaghetti westerns,
Sergio Leone, felt that Eastwood "had only two expressions: with or
without a hat"--built an image not only as an actor but also as an
auteur, culminating in the 1992 Oscar for best picture going to his
"Unforgiven."</TE>
<TE>   From the very beginning, Clint "knew when and how to turn on the
warmth and humor. Journalists felt an intimacy with him,"
particularly those from Associated Press, United Press International,
Hollywood Reporter, Variety and the Los Angeles Times. The French
critic Pierre Rissient was so beguiled by "The Beguiled" (1971) and
its star that he arranged for important critics from several French
publications to see advance screenings. Monsieur Rissient would
become Eastwood's French press agent while continuing to write pieces
about him. Jerry Lewis should have been so lucky.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Eastwood fashioned a press corps perfectly willing
to leave out discussions of his private life, including incessant
womanizing; two out-of-wedlock children; the neglect of his wife,
Maggie; and, eventually, their messy ongoing divorce. (McGilligan's
account of the demonization of Sondra Locke, Eastwood's leading lady
for six films and live-in companion for a decade and a half, by
Eastwood and his devoted press is practically a book within this
book.) Thus did Eastwood gain a reputation as a star who "rarely
gives interviews and hardly ever makes public appearances" while at
the same time being perhaps the most interviewed and accessible (to
his coterie) of stars.</TE>
<TE>   As the years went by, Eastwood was able to build up a "solid Clint
bandwagon of U.S. reviewers" (and McGilligan isn't afraid to name
names) or, rather, Eastwood wasn't afraid to round up the suspects in
a Playboy interview in which he mentioned "the better, more
experienced reviewers" such as Jay Cocks of Time magazine (who was
"casually drafted into Clint's social circle" after giving "Dirty
Harry" its only positive review in a major publication), the Village
Voice's Andrew Sarris and the New York Times' Vincent Canby and
Bosley Crowther. Many other critics have been loyal even to
Eastwood's failures: Gary Giddins, who wrote an adoring cover story
on Eastwood for Esquire, hailed the slapdash flop "The Rookie" (1990)
as "a knockout" and "the best action movie since 'Lethal Weapon 2.' "
To Eastwood's most devoted fans, comparisons with other filmmakers
aren't enough. Peter Biskind in Premiere likened Eastwood's westerns
not to John Ford's, but to Elizabethan tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   "Many critics," writes McGilligan, "because they liked Clint in
person as well as on the screen, strove to find artistic merit in his
films, even though there emerged a basic contradiction between the
films they supported and those which audiences loved. The audiences
wanted the omnipotent Clint, while the critics preferred the
uncharacteristic films in which Clint found himself powerless or
defeated." Eastwood was really able to reconcile the two Clints only
one time, in "The Unforgiven," by allowing himself to be beaten and
humiliated and still return to do what the man with no name had done
at the beginning of "Fistful of Dollars," namely to kill everyone and
ride off.</TE>
<TE>   And so Clint Eastwood, who had made a career out of posing as the
consummate anti-star, seemingly indifferent to the Oscars--"I will
never win an Oscar, and do you know why?," McGilligan quotes him as
saying, "First of all, because I'm not Jewish. Secondly, because I
make too much money for all those old farts in the
academy..."--walked off with an Academy Award that crowned his
career. Or it would have crowned his career had he not gone on to
make several more turkeys.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, if Eastwood remains "an enigma" to his objective
biographer, it may not be a failure of McGilligan's abilities as a
researcher. McGilligan seems to reveal that when one arrives at the
heart of Clint Eastwood, one finds, as Gertrude Stein wrote of the
Oakland where he grew up, that "there is no there there."</TE>

<LD>ANOTHER CENTURY OF WAR?</LD>
<LD>   By Gabriel Kolko</LD>
<LD>   The New Press:</LD>
<TE>   176 pp., $15.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   Gabriel Kolko, the author of "Century of War," and "Anatomy of a
War," does not mince words. "September 11 confirmed, if any
confirmation was needed, that the United States has abysmally failed
to bring peace and security to the world." "Cease meddling," he warns
our politicians. Cease "buttressing tyrants," "protecting American
corporate interests" and "selling or giving arms to nations that have
rebellious populations or grievances against neighboring states." Put
an end to our 50-year role of destabilizing the Middle East. Stop
trying to make distinctions between freedom fighters and terrorists.
In short, mind our own business and look to our own domestic
problems. While we tell the rest of the world to stop building its
arsenals, our military budget has increased by $3.1 billion in the
last year.</TE>
<TE>   But Kolko is not optimistic: "Neither the American population nor
its political leaders are likely to agree to such far-reaching
changes in foreign policy, and there is not the slightest sign at
this point that voters will call their politicians to account."</TE>
<TE>   Kolko builds to a shrill level in this short volume, which reads
like a very long op-ed piece: Realpolitik doesn't work. Our pursuit
of oil has created alliances that are the forebears of organizations
like Al Qaeda. Competition for oil will increase, particularly from
China. Our policies have endangered our people. The world hates us.</TE>
<TE>   Our "irrational ambition to run the world," writes Kolko in his
last, stinging sentence, "will inflict wars and turmoil on many
nations as well as on its own people."</TE>

<TE>   WHEN THE EMPEROR WAS DIVINE</TE>
<TE>   By Julie Otsuka</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 144 pp., $18</TE>
<TE>   This gentle, understated novel takes on one of the most
embarrassing episodes in American history: the internment of
Japanese-Americans during World War II. Seen through the eyes of one
family, step-by-step as they descend into the hell created for them,
it is a story that has more power than any other I have read about
this time.</TE>
<TE>   First come the anonymous signs posted, in this case, in Berkeley
in the spring of 1942. The mother, whose husband has been taken weeks
earlier, buys some duffle bags, packs their things, shoots the family
dog, frees the parrot and dutifully takes her boy, age 7, and girl,
10, to the Civil Control Station.</TE>
<TE>   From there they are sent to live in barracks in a camp in Utah,
where they live for three years and five months. The children receive
letters from their father, who has been taken from his home in his
bathrobe and slippers and sent to another camp, but the letters are
heavily censored.</TE>
<TE>   When the family returns home to Berkeley, their house has been
ransacked, the children are ignored or harassed at school, and the
mother cannot find a job--no one will hire her. When the father
returns, they can barely recognize him, so stripped is he of vitality
and dignity.</TE>
<TE>   Otsuka permits herself one outburst, in the very end of the novel,
a chapter that she calls confession (referring to the confession her
father was forced to make) and that seems like a separate essay: "I'm
the slant-eyed sniper in the trees ... the traitor in your own
backyard ... your houseboy ... your cook ... your gardener .... I'm
sorry. There. I've said it. Now can I go?"</TE>

<TE>   LADY GREGORY'S TOOTHBRUSH</TE>
<TE>   By Colm Toibin</TE>
<TE>   University of Wisconsin Press:</TE>
<TE>   128 pp., $19.95</TE>
<TE>   This is a biographical essay Toibin has written about a figure in
Irish history who he feels has been largely misunderstood or
overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1852, Augusta Persse became Lady Gregory when she married
Sir William Gregory in 1880. Sir William was the unfortunate creator
of something known as the Gregory clause, a portion of a bill that
contributed a great deal to the number of deaths in the Irish Famine
by insisting that small farmers could not apply to a workhouse
without losing their leases, even if their land was unproductive.</TE>
<TE>   Lady Gregory, a mixture of "high ideals and natural haughtiness,"
was a conservative with a conscience. She supported her husband, but
when he died in 1892, her political and creative self emerged. She
became very close with poet W.B. Yeats, began research on the
folklore and early literature of Ireland and began writing plays.</TE>
<TE>   She wholeheartedly took up the cause of the Irish peasantry (what
was left of it), developed a very public disdain for England and was
founder and director of the Abbey Theatre, which featured the plays
of Yeats and Synge and O'Casey. Toibin's essay is a sort of
resurrection; she may have been a hypocrite, he writes, but so were a
lot of other people in Ireland in those times. Toibin's bleak fiction
is full of judgment and reprisal; his view of history, for better or
worse, seems kinder and gentler.</TE>

<HD>In Search of the Raw and the Cooked</HD>
<DH>BLUE LATITUDES: Boldly Going Where Captain Cook Has Gone
Before, By Tony Horwitz, Henry Holt: 416 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>Bob Drogin is a Times staff writer covering national
security issues in the Washington, D.C., bureau and has visited many
of the Pacific island nations and regions that Cook explored.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Aug. 26, 1768, Capt. James Cook set sail from England for the vast
void of the Pacific. For three years, the plain-spoken British
navigator and his men aboard H.M. Bark Endeavor explored the third of
the globe that was still unknown to Europeans with orders for "making
Discoveries of Countries hitherto unknown." By the time he returned
to London, Cook had literally redrawn the map of the world, preparing
charts of Australia, New Zealand and other Pacific islands so
accurate that some were still in use in the 1990s. He probably named
more places than anyone else in history.</LD>
<LD>   Cook also transformed Western art and science. Led by financier
and botanist Joseph Banks, artists, astronomers and naturalists
aboard Cook's first voyage of discovery collected thousands of
previously undocumented flora and fauna, vastly expanding the known
natural universe. Their dramatic stories and graphic drawings of
exotic locales and unfamiliar practices--from orgiastic sex to human
sacrifice, from tattoos to taboos--provided the template for
generations of legend and myth.</LD>
<TE>   Cook's two follow-up expeditions were also epic. He explored from
the Arctic to the Antarctic, from Tasmania to Tierra del Fuego, from
the South Seas to the Aleutians. He survived coral reefs, icebergs
and attacks by islanders. By the time Cook was killed in 1779 by an
angry mob of natives in what he had named the Sandwich Isles (now
Hawaii), he had sailed about 200,000 miles. He had opened huge new
territories to Europe's colonial and commercial empires--as well as
to Europe's slavery, syphilis and wars.</TE>
<TE>   In "Blue Latitudes: Boldly Going Where Captain Cook Has Gone
Before," journalist and author Tony Horwitz retraces much of Cook's
remarkable journey and explores the profound legacy of one of
history's greatest explorers. It is a vivid narrative--part history,
part travelogue--and mostly just great fun. He brings the same
insatiable curiosity and wry wit to this book that he did in his
"Confederates in the Attic," a bestseller on the Civil War. Here too
he plays the role of re-enactor--swabbing decks and reefing sails for
a week on a replica of Cook's vessel. And here too, he weaves a
meticulously researched historic tale with his own amusing
misadventures.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Theroux and Simon Winchester, among other authors, have
toured--and largely trashed--the not-so-happy isles of modern Oceania
in recent years. Horwitz is far more judicious, if only because he
reviews and discards more of the biases and blinders that have shaded
our view of "native" Pacific cultures since the days of Rousseau's
noble savage.</TE>
<TE>   The myths are deeply ingrained. Think of Cook's much-maligned
mate, William Bligh, whose sadistic misrule later triggered the
mutiny on the Bounty and at least three Hollywood movies. Horwitz
reminds us that Bligh flogged his men less often and fed them better
than did many British officers of the time. And the Bounty's mission
was hardly noble: The ship was to carry Tahitian breadfruit to the
West Indies to provide cheap food for slaves.</TE>
<TE>   Horwitz also finds small treasures as he travels. My favorite:
Cook named the kangaroo after gangurru, the term used by Aborigines
on the northeast coast for local large, gray marsupials. Cook didn't
realize that Australia's widely scattered Aborigines had numerous
languages and the word was foreign to most of them. But Cook took the
word to England, and British settlers soon carried it back to
Australia, where it was ultimately accepted. Ironically, Horwitz
writes, the Aboriginal clan that Cook first met had 10 different
words for kangaroo. As an Aborigine tells him: "If Cook had asked
about a small red one, the whole world would be saying nharrgali
today."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Horwitz's book has its flaws. He has a sophomoric eagerness
to describe each time he and Roger, his boozy Australian sidekick,
get drunk, throw up, smoke dope, get seasick, get drunk again and so
on. Roger is on his own quest here--for "crumpet," Australian slang
for women. Their search for Cook's trail soon resembles Animal House
at sea. Their escapades are entertaining, but wet T-shirts and
interviews with barflies get old fast. We get less the enduring
insights of Herman Melville than the addled antics of Hunter
Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   But this is history on a global scale, and Horwitz tells it
surpassingly well. When Cook first embarked in 1768, the known world
was surprisingly small. Much of the globe remained blank on European
maps, or was filled with sea monsters and imaginary continents. Map
makers labeled much of the Pacific "nondum cognita," not yet known.
To help fill the gaps--and to record a rare astronomical event, the
transit of Venus across the sun--King George III agreed to send the
little-known Cook to the Pacific. Tahiti was the first stop.</TE>
<TE>   Reports from Cook's men of bare-breasted women apparently eager to
engage in public sex helped create the myth of Tahiti as primitive
paradise. In reality, the first Western ship to visit Tahiti two
years before had brought venereal disease. Smallpox, measles,
alcoholism and other ills soon spread with devastating effect. The
population plummeted in less than a century from more than 200,000 to
about 7,000.</TE>
<TE>   We know little of how Pacific islanders viewed their first contact
with the West. Cook's visit to New Zealand is a rare exception.
According to interviews later conducted by British settlers, natives
thought his ship was a giant bird or a floating island. Clan elders
thought it came from the spirit world, and the men were goblins. Many
Maoris today apparently agree. Horwitz lends a sympathetic ear to
angry local activists who view Cook as a racist invader who unfairly
depicted their ancestors as criminals and savages. "With hindsight,
the line between exploration and exploitation, between investigation
and imperialism, seems perilously thin," he concludes.</TE>
<TE>   Cook next sailed west, becoming the first European to reach the
east coast of Australia. His ship foundered and nearly sank on the
Great Barrier Reef, and he was glad to finally get out alive. Many
who followed were not so lucky. His reports on Australia's timber,
fish and other resources led Britain to choose the new colony to
replace the rebellious American colonies as a place to dump
prisoners. The first prison ships landed in 1787, and 160,000 British
convicts ultimately followed. Aborigines were hunted and killed as
vermin, and their land taken at will. In Australia, Horwitz writes,
the two societies didn't so much meet as violently collide.</TE>
<TE>   It was a pattern repeated in varying degrees across the Pacific.
Many of the lands Cook ultimately claimed for Britain "became
wretched colonial outposts," Horwitz correctly notes. Indeed, he
points out, "the notion of 'discovery' also rings hollow" since
nearly every place Cook visited was already inhabited. "In Polynesia,
the true discoverers were pioneers who set off from Asia in sailing
canoes several millennia before Cook, eventually settling the vast
triangle of ocean bounded by Easter Island, New Zealand and Hawaii,"
he tells us.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Cook's legacy is a matter of perspective. Was he a
savior who brought Western trade and civilization to benighted lands?
Or a despot who ravaged native populations and traditional cultures?
Horwitz argues that he was both, a humane and just man who grew so
accustomed to being treated like a god that he ultimately became
petty and cruel.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, Cook's lengthy journals rarely explain why he did what he
did. But Horwitz cites one entry that perhaps explains his motives
most clearly. "Ambition leads me not only farther than any other man
has been before me," Cook wrote, "but as far as I think it possible
for man to go."</TE>

<HD>On Shaky Ground</HD>
<DH>AFTER THE QUAKE: Stories, By Haruki Murakami, Translated
from the Japanese by Jay Rubin, Alfred A. Knopf: 182 pp., $21</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Haruki Murakami remains one of the most accessible Japanese writers
for Western readers. His works give us little of the feeling we have
when reading Yukio Mishima or Yasunari Kawabata--that we are entering
a new world in which our expectations of how people should think or
behave must be suspended.</LD>
<LD>   Murakami's characters, by and large, are easygoing people, fully
engaged in contemporary international culture. They drink Scotch,
listen to jazz and rock, vacation in Paris or Hawaii, read Jack
London and John Updike. Their concerns are ours: sex, love, jobs,
family relationships, making sense of the world.</LD>
<LD>   True, the world in Murakami's novels, such as "A Wild Sheep Chase"
and "Dance Dance Dance," has pockets of surreal mystery, and making
sense of it isn't easy. The six stories in "After the Quake" are all
related to the catastrophic Kobe earthquake of January 1995--not
through the direct experience of victims but through the tremors that
are felt, the cracks that open, in the lives of people seemingly at a
safe remove. Americans should have no trouble empathizing with them
after the shocks of Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, Jay Rubin has translated these stories into a smooth,
decidedly American English, so cultural barriers are minimized. We
enter each tale confident that we're on firm ground until, under the
characters' feet and ours alike, it gives way.</TE>
<TE>   In "UFO in Kushiro," a woman obsessed with earthquake coverage on
TV leaves her affable husband, claiming he has "nothing inside." When
a new lover he encounters on a trip to the northern island of
Hokkaido jokes about this, he finds himself for a moment "on the
verge of committing an act of overwhelming violence." In "Landscape
With Flatiron," a young woman who has dropped out of school and left
her family to live on the opposite coast from Kobe with a thuggish
surfer is drawn to an older man, an artist, who builds bonfires on
the beach. What begins as a friendly meeting at night to view the
flames turns into a double-suicide pact.</TE>
<TE>   "All God's Children Can Dance" features a young Tokyo man whose
mother, a convert to Christianity, told him as a child that he had no
father but God, and only belatedly indicated that he may in fact be
the son of a doctor who advised her about contraception in her wild
years. The young man thinks he sees that very person and follows him
on the subway, by taxi and on foot. The pursuit, typically for
Murakami, seems to pass through a wrinkle in reality and ends on a
deserted baseball diamond.</TE>
<TE>   In "Thailand," a Japanese doctor vacationing at a Thai resort,
hears of the quake and hopes that a lover who betrayed her 30 years
ago has been killed. Instead, she must learn from her Thai guide that
carrying grudges won't keep her from growing old. "If you devote all
of your future energy to living," he tells her, "you will not be able
to die well." The last two stories deal with the quake by means of
fairy tales--for what good does reason do, Murakami seems to ask, in
a country perpetually threatened by quakes and volcanic eruptions?</TE>
<TE>   In "Super-Frog Saves Tokyo," that city-- site of the Great Kanto
Earthquake of 1923, which killed more than 100,000 people--is indeed
saved from a post-Kobe disaster by a 6-foot amphibian and his
unlikely ally: a short, skinny banker who has grown tough trying to
collect bad loans after the collapse of Japan's economic bubble of
the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "Honey Pie" also has an optimistic ending. The quake follows the
breakup of a once-happy couple, and it impels their best friend, a
short-story writer who let his handsomer, more assertive buddy claim
the woman in college, to declare his own love for her. He does this
obliquely by telling stories about lovable bears to calm her
4-year-old daughter, who has nightmares that an Earthquake Man is
stuffing her into a box. "I want to write stories," he says, "that
are different from the ones I've written so far."</TE>

<HD>The Once and Future Karel Capek</HD>
<DH>KAREL CAPEK: Life and Work, By Ivan Klima, Translated from
the Czech by Norma Comrada, Catbird Press: 266 pp., $23 CROSS ROADS,
By Karel Capek, Translated from the Czech by Norma Comrada, Catbird

<AU>MICHAEL HENRY HEIM</AU>
<BD>Michael Henry Heim teaches in the departments of Slavic
languages and literatures and comparative literature at UCLA and has
translated numerous works by Milan Kundera, Gunter Grass, Bohumil
Hrabal and others.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Literary fortunes come and go. Karel Capek (1890-1938) once enjoyed
the kind of international acclaim vouchsafed more recently to his
fellow Czech--and great admirer--Milan Kundera. His
dramas--especially "R.U.R.," which introduced Capek's term "robot" to
the world--played to packed houses throughout Europe and the
Americas; his stories and novels (such as "Tales From Two Pockets"
and "War With the Newts") were translated as soon as they appeared.</LD>
<LD>   He also wrote animated and engaging travelogues ("Letters From
England," "Letters From Holland," "Letters From Italy," "Letters From
Spain"), political works (including a biography of the first
president of the Czech Republic, "Talks With T.G. Masaryk") and
personal essays ("The Gardener's Year"). And despite the diversity of
genres and styles and an enormous output within a relatively brief
period (he had a late start because of World War I and, as we shall
see, an early end because of the German invasion of his country in
1938), Capek was anything but a graphomaniac: Every line is
thoughtful and thought-provoking.</LD>
<TE>   Why then did he virtually vanish from the literary horizon? The
main reason, I would argue, is that the times called for a less
temperate voice than his. His basic position was one of pluralistic
acceptance, the commensurability of opposing views. It was so basic
that he built it into his works, even structured them around it,
predicating what some consider his masterpiece, a trilogy of novels
("Hordubal," "Meteor," "An Ordinary Life," available in English in
one volume as "Three Novels"), on the principle that no account of a
life--or even an isolated incident--is entirely valid or invalid. The
result is a Rashomon-like revisitation of characters and events from
varying points of view.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Capek's relativism by any means extended to an acceptance
of National Socialism. Since the Nazi regime was totalitarian, it
excluded pluralist thought by definition, and if only for that reason
was anathema to him. His last major novel, "War With the Newts," can
be read on one of its many levels as a brutal satire of Hitler and
his policies, and he was so demoralized by the German takeover that
several months later he succumbed without resistance to a bronchial
inflammation. Yet he had repeatedly called for tolerance vis-a-vis
the German minority in Czechoslovakia, and, as tensions mounted,
popular sympathy for tolerance declined.</TE>
<TE>   If after the war Capek failed to make an immediate comeback in his
own country, the new geopolitical situation was to blame:
Czechoslovakia had been thrust into the arms of the century's other
main totalitarian regime, and his pluralism made him a prime
candidate for the blacklist. Nor did it help that he had written a
short but pointed essay titled "Why I Am Not a Communist."</TE>
<TE>   To trace the battle to republish his works and his reinstatement
as a leading force in Czech letters ("rehabilitation," in the jargon
of the time) is to trace the liberalization of the regime from the
deep Stalinism of its origins to the Prague Spring of 1968.</TE>
<TE>   The time has come for a rehabilitation beyond the borders of his
native country. In ours, as the two books under review demonstrate,
it has begun. Thanks to the selfless labors of Robert Wechsler, who
founded his Catbird Press with the express intention of making Capek
available again in English, the major works are in print. Wechsler
has also enlisted a number of translators (primary among them the
highly gifted Norma Comrada) to provide revitalized versions of the
works.</TE>
<TE>   It is not by chance that the movement to bring Capek back has been
so active in the United States. As Ivan Klima makes abundantly clear
in his fine biography, "Karel Capek: Life and Work"--commissioned by
Wechsler and the first in any language--Capek was unusual among
continental writers in taking the American intellectual tradition
seriously. In this he was not alone among Czechs: Masaryk based the
political institutions of the First Czechoslovak Republic, which owed
its existence to President Wilson's vision for post-Hapsburg Europe,
largely on American models.</TE>
<TE>   Capek found American philosophy attractive as well, especially in
the person of William James. In 1918 he published a book-length essay
titled "Pragmatism, or a Philosophy for Practical Life." The
relativism that so infuses his work derives largely from the Jamesian
pragmatic method of interpreting each notion "by tracing its
respective practical consequences." Should it have no practical
consequences, we are free to create our own truths--as long as we
accept the responsibility for their fallout and do not think of them
as absolute (and thus try to force them on others). What counts is
reality, the world waiting to be fashioned by our activity.</TE>
<TE>   This American-inspired optimism served to steel Capek first, in
the 1920s, against the ideology that had just triumphed in Russia and
promised a radiant future, and then, in the 1930s, against the
ideology that was triumphing in Germany and promised a millennium of
Aryan rule. It appears in literary guise in "Tales From Two Pockets,"
published at the decades' juncture, a volume of four-to five-page
detective stories in which the detectives range from scruffy police
inspectors as simple-minded as the murderers they seek (and therefore
capable of finding them) to a poet who uses metaphors to reconstruct
the particulars of an accident. Anyone can be a detective. What could
be more democratic?</TE>
<TE>   The devotion to American-style democracy comes across on another
level as well. "Capek devised splendid plots," Klima perceptively
notes, "to support the idea that almost everything that appears
mysterious can be reduced to something banal or everyday." In other
words, extraordinary events have ordinary explanations. At the
apocalyptic conclusion to "War With the Newts" we learn that the
newts' bid to take over the world would not have occurred had not a
modest Czech doorman brought two of the protagonists together. The
message is that the accumulation of small actions speaks louder than
a single large one, that "little people," not the larger-than-life
hero, constitute the moving force of history.</TE>
<TE>   For all their political and philosophical concerns, Capek's works
are unfailingly entertaining: Capek is never heavy-handed, and his
tongue is never far from his cheek. The stories brought together in
"Cross Roads"--from "Wayside Crosses" (1917), translated here for the
first time, and "Painful Tales" (1921), skillfully translated
afresh--show him still coming into his own: in the former he has yet
to demystify mystery, and the puzzle of a lone footprint in the snow
remains unsolved; in the latter, to quote the 1929 New York Times
reviewer of the earlier English version, he "takes his place in that
school of the short story which includes Chekhov, Katherine Mansfield
and our own Sherwood Anderson," and in fact the stories deal
masterfully and in the open-ended fashion of a Chekhov, Mansfield or
Anderson with a variety of frustrated lives.</TE>
<TE>   Klima's biography is ideal for helping the reader to determine
where to go from here. A prominent Czech writer who has clearly
learned many a lesson from his subject, Klima delivers more homage
than scholarly disquisition. As follows from the "life and work" in
the subtitle, his is an exercise in an unabashedly conventional
criticism: For Klima, the author is understandably far from dead; he
is very much alive, and his life (his relationship to his family, his
health, his loves) a key--if not the key--to his works, each of which
receives due attention.</TE>
<TE>   They deserve our attention too at a time when, mercifully, the two
messianic ideologies that silenced Capek are a thing of the past and
possibly the humane democratic society in which he believed is
beginning to unfold. If anything, then, his works are more timely now
than when he wrote them, and his lightness and sureness of tone, his
ability to combine elements of fable, psychological realism and
science fiction, of satire and parody, but most of all the obvious
pleasure he takes in the old-fashioned art of storytelling make him a
joy to read.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Footprint' (included in `Cross Roads')</TE>
<TE>   Walking outside, Boura hesitantly sinks his feet into the
untouched snow ... coming towards him on the road is someone dressed
in black and covered with snow ...</TE>
<TE>   "You see that footprint over there?" said the snow-decked man, and
he pointed at an imprint perhaps six yards from the side of the road.</TE>
<TE>   "I see it: it's a man's footprint."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, but how did it get there?" Someone was walking there, Boura
started to say, but he held back, puzzled: the footprint was alone in
the midst of a field, and neither before nor behind it was there a
trace of other footsteps. The print was quite clear and distinct
against the white, but it was solitary: nothing led either to it or
away ...</TE>
<TE>   Boura pondered the matter with utmost concentration. "Perhaps
there was a natural depression in the ground over there, or a
footprint left in the mud that froze, and snow fell into it. Or else,
wait a minute, perhaps a cast-off boot was standing there and a bird
carried it away when the snow stopped falling. In either case there
would be a snow-free spot similar to a footprint. We must look for
natural causes."</TE>
<TE>   "If a boot had stood there before the storm, there'd be black
earth left under it; but all I see is snow."</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps the bird carried away the boot while it was still
snowing, or in mid-flight he dropped it into the fresh snow and then
carried it off again. It simply cannot be a footprint."</TE>
<TE>   "Tell me, can this bird of yours eat boots? Or build a nest in
one? A small bird can't pick up a boot, and a big one couldn't fit
inside of it. We need to solve this on general principles. I think
that it is a footprint, and since it didn't come up out of the earth,
it must have come from above. You fancy that it was carried off by a
bird, but it's possible that it might have fallen from--from a
balloon. Maybe someone was hanging from a balloon and placed his foot
down into the snow just to make fools of us all. Don't laugh, it's
embarrassing to try to account for this in such a far-fetched way,
but--I'd prefer it not to be a footprint."</TE>

<HD>The Enigma of Sappho</HD>
<DH>IF NOT, WINTER: Fragments of Sappho, By Sappho, Translated
from the Greek by Anne Carson, Alfred A. Knopf: 400 pp., $27.50</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMIE JAMES</AU>
<BD>Jamie James is the author of "Andrew and Joey: A
Novel."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No poet of antiquity has been more widely adored than the Greek lyric
poet Sappho, the most influential woman in world literature until
modern times. Although she lived and wrote 2,600 years ago, she is
vibrantly alive to us, a more distinctive companion to the reader
than almost any writer who followed her, at least until Dante. Sappho
is a woman one knows. She sang her verses, accompanying herself on
the lyre; in the poems one hears her voice, as familiar as an old
friend calling hello at the front door.</LD>
<LD>   When she tells her beloved, "I loved you, Atthis, once long ago /
a little child you seemed to me and graceless," the words--here, in
Anne Carson's faithful new translation "If Not, Winter"--come as
close as literature can to life, to a direct reflection of
experience. How easy it would be to say instead, as a lesser poet
might, that the girl she loves is graceful--and how lifeless. Yet
when Sappho says that her first impression of Atthis was one of
gracelessness, it has the vivid, surprising power of life.</LD>
<TE>   What makes Sappho's poetry so enduring and what makes her palpable
human presence in the poems so remarkable is that we know almost
nothing about her--hardly surprising, given that she lived so very
long ago, more than a century before the age of Pericles and
Sophocles, on the remote island of Lesbos. She probably lived in
exile in Sicily for a time, a tradition bolstered by some
heartbreaking poems addressed to her daughter, lamenting that she
can't dress her as she would at home.</TE>
<TE>   It might be safer to say, as some recent scholars have, that in
fact we know nothing at all about her except what may be gleaned from
the poems--which are literature and therefore suspect. Almost
everything we once thought we knew has been proved to be false. My
Encyclopaedia Britannica, for example, still innocently repeats the
old canard that Sappho was "married to Cercolas, a wealthy man from
the island Andros"--a joke from a bawdy ancient comedy about the poet
("Cercolas" is a phallic pun, and Andros simply means "man"). There
are many more legends, all of which have considerably less historical
basis than George Washington's cherry tree; the most widely known is
the traditional account of Sappho's death, that she leapt from a
cliff, her heart broken by a young sailor named Phaon.</TE>
<TE>   Sappho's verse, too, has been almost entirely obliterated. Of the
nine books of poems attributed to her by tradition and celebrated in
the ancient world, only fragments remain, a few hundred lines that
include just one complete poem, the thrilling "Hymn to Aphrodite,"
and isolated words and phrases rescued from citations by ancient
grammarians and rhetoricians. The destruction of the works of the
poets of pagan antiquity is usually blamed on the early Christian
church fathers and the crusaders. Sappho's reputation for
licentiousness provoked Pope Gregory VII to have her books publicly
burned in AD 1073; according to another tradition, the last complete
copy of Sappho went up in smoke with the library of Constantinople in
AD 1204, when the fourth Crusade sacked the city.</TE>
<TE>   The few fragments that survived have inspired readers to rapturous
delight for centuries. Joseph Addison, introducing the first
published English translation of the "Hymn to Aphrodite" by Ambrose
Philips, in 1711, neatly captures the reason for Sappho's perennial
appeal: "Her soul seems to have been made up of love and poetry. She
felt the passion in all its warmth, and described it in all its
symptoms." The Victorians were mad about her, creating a sentimental
cult with titillating undercurrents. J.A. Symonds painted a gorgeous
myth of life on 6th century Lesbos. In his vision, the ladies of
Lesbos had unlimited freedom and leisure, which they beguiled with
music, dance and poetry as they strolled in exquisite gardens, "where
the rose and hyacinth spread perfume," or along "marble cliffs,
starred with jonquil and anemone in spring." Symonds didn't have to
remind his readers that the amorous, talented women in the myth also
made love to each other.</TE>
<TE>   Much of classical literature, despite the protestations of
popularizers, really is remote to contemporary readers; the battle
scenes in the epics, the endless odes to the winners of footraces,
the tips to farmers are difficult for most of us to grasp or care
about. Yet Sappho is always fresh and thumping with life: In fragment
47, she declares herself: "Eros shook my mind like a mountain wind
falling on oak trees." With Sappho and love, it's always a fight to
the finish.</TE>
<TE>   The fragments of Sappho constitute a compelling demonstration of
the tragic power of the word, its capacity to make us feel loss as
deeply as we do in life. The lines just quoted are all that survive
of the original poem, recovered from a paraphrase by an obscure
orator named Maximus of Tyre. We will never know what happened after
Eros shook the poet's mind, or who caused the tempest. The sensitive
reader, confronted with fragment 47, must attempt something like an
imaginative reconstruction of the whole poem, as it might have been.
Despite the impossibility of the undertaking, the longer the lines
play in the mind, the closer the lost poem comes glimmering toward
the surface.</TE>
<TE>   There have been many fine translations of the fragments of Sappho
since Philips' day, and now Anne Carson, a distinguished Canadian
poet, offers her version. Carson restores to us the Sappho who fell
in love with a girl because she reminded her of a graceless child and
strips away the mawkish cliche of the odd musical lady leaping off
the cliff (admittedly less of a problem now than when classical
literature was widely read).</TE>
<TE>   Carson is in many ways the ideal translator, an accomplished
classicist who frequently writes on Hellenic themes in her own verse
(among others, the brilliant book-length "Autobiography of Red," a
love story based upon the fragments of the lyric poet Stesichorus,
Sappho's near-contemporary). Her command of language is honed to a
perfect edge and her approach to the text, respectful yet
imaginative, results in verse that lets Sappho shine forth without a
lot of fuss. Most of Carson's translations are elegantly literal, but
every now and then she sweetens the lines with a bit of traditional
versification, as in this couplet, fragment 50: "For the man who is
beautiful is beautiful to see / but the good man will at once also
beautiful be." The old-fashioned rendering emphasizes the lines'
sententiousness, an extremely rare quality in what survives of
Sappho's work.</TE>
<TE>   Carson has arrived at a fine solution to one of the most
perplexing problems of Sapphic scholarship: what to do with the heaps
of papyrus dug up over the last hundred years, which are slowly
enlarging the poet's oeuvre (in some cases just a few words at a
time). Since the end of the 19th century, archeologists in Egypt have
excavated large quantities of tattered papyrus, shredded manuscripts
of Sappho and other ancient poets, which were used to make
papier-mache or simply thrown out with the garbage. Some of them
consist of halves of many lines, a papyrus page torn vertically;
others consist of a few isolated words.</TE>
<TE>   In her translations, Carson indicates the lacunae with brackets,
to give the reader a sense of the incompleteness of the papyrus. (The
parallel text is also an aid here, even to readers with no Greek.)
Here, for example, is her translation of fragment 93:</TE>
<TE>   ]</TE>
<TE>   ]</TE>
<TE>   ]</TE>
<TE>   ]I have</TE>
<TE>   ]of girls</TE>
<TE>   The effect, unintentional and unavoidable, is similar to that of
the quaint enigmas of concrete poetry, experimental verse from the
1950s and 1960s. The words form a shadowy little world, approaching
the very threshold of nonexistence, which pushes the challenge of
reconstruction to the limit.</TE>
<TE>   Poets make the best translators of poetry, but they are often
irritating introducers and annotators. Carson's introduction is the
weakest part of the book, five elliptical pages that include little
of the basic information contained in this review. She is
surprisingly reticent on the subject of Sappho's sexuality, saying
only, "It seems that she knew and loved women as deeply as she did
music. Can we leave it there?" and adding a baffling quotation from
Gertrude Stein to cast further darkness on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   No, we can't leave it there: Symonds and others may have made a
romanticized muddle of Sappho's life in the absence of reliable
biographical information, but most readers of Sappho will wonder
about the passions that produced the poetry: It's an interesting
question. After all, there is a fundamental difference between the
love of music and carnal love, which Sappho's crushes on girls have
every sign of having been.</TE>
<TE>   However, Carson's notes are enormously enjoyable. She takes the
reader to the very heart of the process of translation in a
three-paragraph note devoted to the two words that constitute
fragment 38 (which she translates "you burn me"). After justifying
her rendering, she makes an admission that few scholars, if any,
would be brave enough to utter: "On the other hand, I may be reading
this sentence all wrong." It's a wonderful sentence, gleaming with a
candor worthy of Sappho herself, which inspires confidence that in
"If Not, Winter" Carson is getting it right, all right.</TE>

<LD>To the Editor:</LD>
<LD>   May I quietly point out, in response to Lee Siegel's noisily
shouting piece (Book Review, Aug. 11) on the Partisan Review
conference (to which I contributed, though I did not attend) that
when an essay--mine, in this instance, which he calls "sour" while
sourly misrepresenting it--is delivered "humanely and elegantly," it
may be because the content is in fact humane and the writing is in
fact worthy.</LD>
<LD>   Unless Siegel believes that a silk purse can be made out of a
sow's ear? I have experimented with that possibility--I have tried
reciting Siegel's first two paragraphs aloud--and found that it
cannot be done.</LD>

<HD>Poetry's Just Another Word for Nothing Left to Lose</HD>
<DH>OPEN GATE: An Anthology of Haitian Creole Poetry, Edited by
Paul Laraque and Jack Hirschman, Translated by Jack Hirschman and
Boadiba, Curbstone Press: 238 pp., $15.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAI MARISTED</AU>
<BD>Kai Maristed is the author of, among other works,
"Belong to Me: Stories" and the novel "Fall."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christopher Columbus named his first landfall Hispaniola, in honor of
his Spanish employers, declaring its blue natural harbors and lush
hills a paradise on Earth. The island was called "Ayiti," or "high
land," by native Ciboney Indians, soon to be eradicated by European
germs and steel.</LD>
<LD>   Today, Hispaniola hosts two separate worlds. The fertile eastern
plain belongs to the relatively viable Dominican Republic, a country
whose export earnings are augmented by a booming tourist industry.
The mountainous western third remains Haiti--Ayiti still in the
people's language--though it would surely be unrecognizable to a
time-traveling explorer from 1492. Parched, denuded of forests, the
scant remaining water polluted with bacteria and parasites, Haiti is
home to 8 million mostly illiterate souls "living" on an average of
$300 a year. This is not paradise. Surely it must be hell:</LD>
<LD>   Poverty makes all things faded,</LD>
<TE>   crooked, cracked, emaciated,</TE>
<TE>   wasted away, dingy, stupid, ground-down,</TE>
<TE>   pocked ....</TE>
<TE>   On Saturdays, the whole town on the coast</TE>
<TE>   gets off by throwing their bodies into the sea</TE>
<TE>   like people in heat.</TE>
<TE>   Around here, life burns!</TE>
<TE>   These lines are by Georges Castera, born in 1936 in
Port-au-Prince, one of the grand poets of Haiti. Castera, along with
such masters as Felix Morisseau-Leroy and Paul Laraque, helped
spearhead the movement to create a world-class literature in the
Haitian Kreyol language--indeed, to standardize in writing what had
been strictly an oral language. Despite the repressive snobbery of
Haiti's French-speaking upper crust, Kreyol is a language of
remarkable sound-beauty and supple expressiveness, a long-evolved
mingling of primarily French vocabulary, spiced with Indian and
English influences and governed by West African grammatical
structures.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a taste, from the pen of Pierre-Richard Narcisse: "renn
chantrel kote-ou? / si van vini l'a karese-w / si jou vini l'a
kouwonnen-w" In translation: "singing queen, where are you? / if the
wind comes, it will caress you / if the daylight, it will crown you."
Thanks to a groundbreaking new anthology brought out by Curbstone
Press, English readers can discover and savor an array of these
modern Haitian poets in both Kreyol and English. "Open Gate: An
Anthology of Haitian Creole Poetry" takes its title from these lines
by Paul Laraque: "This is the open gate of poetry / for us to enter /
together / the promised land of liberty."</TE>
<TE>   There's said to be little market for poetry here; probably even
less for poetry from a country whose existence is essentially denied
by our government, for whose refugees we reserve a policy of
incarceration or deportation, and from which the U.S. has for years
withheld hundreds of millions of dollars of promised aid in the
frustrated hope of toppling an overwhelmingly popular president.</TE>
<TE>   The considerable collaborative effort leading to this publication
included dedicated editors Laraque and Jack Hirschman and reached
beyond them to other translators, financial supporters and the poets
themselves. With "Open Gate" in hand, one is tempted to say that news
of the death of responsible American publishing may be premature.</TE>
<TE>   Often the greatest poetry has been born of passion in those who
have nothing to lose. For all the insult and suffering, these verses
dazzle with love of life. The volume gathers the voices of 40 poets,
along with brief biographical notes. Three groupings--the Pioneers,
the Society of Fireflies and the New Generation--take readers from
the 1950s (the darkest days of Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier's rule)
through a period characterized by cycles of hope and cynical
repression, to the present day and mood of bitter desperation,
coupled with the poets' renewed demands for action and for
self-reliance.</TE>
<TE>   "Zombies Arise" was first published in 1980 by the mysterious and
probably pseudonymous Alexander Akao in the diaspora journal Idees:
"Since I was a kid they've been choking me / They grab me, they stuff
me into a barrel / Too small for me ... They're burying us all alive
/ They're stuffing us in the earth / Like slaves locked up in a
canefield / When it's not a horsewhip, papa / Making us walk a
straight line / It's a tonton macoute gun ... / But this morning I
wake up / With salt on my tongue ... / I say it's time they let up /
Choking me, smothering us / I say it's time all zombies / Arise!</TE>
<TE>   Images and even emotions taken from the voodou tradition enrich
much Haitian poetry. A spirit of creative juxtaposition is at work,
as in these lines from Morisseau-Leroy: "There's a loa of revolution
boiling in my blood ... / A lambi of revolution is sounding / If
you've the courage take my hand / My horse is saddled / Let's go." (A
loa is a voodou spirit; the lambi is a conch horn.)</TE>
<TE>   The poems in "Open Gate" have been chosen by politically conscious
editors. One would welcome a second volume that is inclusive of a
broader sensibility. But before reopening the hoary debate on whether
political agenda "cheapens" art, we should reflect on the astonishing
phenomenon of a rich stream of visual and written art pouring from
any place as ground-down as Haiti, the poorest country by far in our
hemisphere. There are delights on these pages: devices of syncopation
and repetition from the oral tradition, startling imagery.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the poets whose work is represented here live in the
diaspora, but most are in Haiti, putting words on paper--precious
stuff in a country where the state hospital recently had no paper
left on which to write diagnoses or prescriptions. Bertolt Brecht
famously declared, "First comes food / then comes morality." If
poetry, in its reach for truth and essence, is a form of morality,
then these poets have stood old Brecht on his head.</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Max Manigat rejoices:</TE>
<TE>   I never knew you were a magician</TE>
<TE>   But you do wonders that leave me speechless</TE>
<TE>   In your hand a pen becomes a ritual rattle</TE>
<TE>   Making all creole words convulse ....</TE>
<TE>   Magician, maestro, quartermaster</TE>
<TE>   Shake the ason, roll the drum, dish out the food</TE>
<TE>   All creole words are falling into the dance</TE>
<TE>   To damnwell strut our stuff in the face of misery</TE>

<DH>THE BOXER: A Nove, By Jurek Becker, Translated from the
German by Alessandra Bastagli, Arcade: 278 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MERLE RUBIN</AU>
<BD>Merle Rubin is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Very few European Jews lucky enough to survive the Nazi concentration
camps chose to live in Germany after the war. Among the exceptions
was the father of novelist Jurek Becker, who settled his family in
East Berlin. Born in Lodz two years before the war, young Becker
spent his early childhood first in the ghetto, then in the
concentration camps of Ravensbruck and Sachsenhausen. His survival
itself seems a miracle. He grew up to become one of the leading
lights of postwar German literature, starting in 1969 with his first
novel, "Jakob the Liar," which was also made into a film.</LD>
<LD>   His novel "The Boxer" (published in Germany in 1976) is a
remarkable book: the deceptively simple, low-keyed story of Aron
Blank, a Holocaust survivor who quietly picks up the few remaining
pieces of his shattered life and goes on living it as best he can.
Aron's story is told years later, by a man interviewing him about his
past. Thus, the story of Aron's postwar life is framed by the
developing relationship between interviewer and interviewee, two men
of different ages and backgrounds.</LD>
<TE>   Aron is a kind of Everyman, an unexceptional individual who
happens to have made a rather exceptional decision in choosing to
remain in Germany. Becker portrays him not as a type or archetype,
but as an ordinary man, scarred by his experiences, yet capable of
compassion, reasonably intelligent but far from intellectual: "He did
not think books superfluous, dispensable accessories; on the
contrary, he thought of himself as pro-rather than anti-book. But one
should beware [he felt] of overestimating their importance ... living
more through books than through life."</TE>
<TE>   As a Holocaust survivor, Aron is eligible for some benefits,
including, it seems, the right to move into an apartment previously
occupied by a Nazi functionary: "[I]t was hard for him to get used to
the fact that all these objects belonged to him.... There was a
luxurious, king-sized bed ... with soft blankets. When he went to bed
the first night, he sighed with pleasure--at last, a decent bed. But
the anticipated pleasure proved to be fleeting.... Aron lay awake and
found no protection from the past. His thoughts rummaged in it, in
death and suffering, his two starving children lay beside him, his
wife was repeatedly dragged from the room crying.... The nauseating
smell that his bedmates in the concentration camp exhaled--to which
he must also have contributed--would not leave him.... Hours later,
he figured that the bed was too wide." Taking a blanket, he wanders
the apartment and finally lies down on the floor of the storage room.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the previous owner was a Nazi affects him strangely.
Many of the furnishings distress him for reasons he doesn't quite
understand: a painting of a farmer with his horse and plow, for
example: "It had been carefully painted and had pleasant colors. Yet
now it disturbed Aron though he could not logically explain why. He
could only convey, in passing, random concepts: return to nature,
love of the land, the innocent word Arbeit." The Nazi nightmare has
poisoned the meanings of images, words and ideas that once seemed
harmless or even appealing.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of an organization called Rescue, Aron locates what
seems to be his sole remaining child, Mark, who was transported to a
camp at age 2. Although they can't be certain that this Mark is the
same child, Aron accepts him. It is many months before the little
boy--fragile, starved and mentally backward--can be released from a
medical facility.</TE>
<TE>   Novelistically, the uncertainty surrounding Mark's provenance
functions not as a plot device (this is no mystery tale of mistaken
identity), but as part of the pervasive sense of disjunction that
shadows Aron and other survivors. After what he has experienced,
nothing seems quite the same, yet he must make do.</TE>
<TE>   In a diffident, almost unintentional way, Aron becomes involved,
first with a Jewish woman from Rescue who has aided him in his
search, then with a German gentile nurse who has cared for Mark at
the rehabilitation facility.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to his tenuous relationships with these women is his
devotion to his little boy. When the child comes home from school one
day, savagely beaten, Aron arranges for him to take boxing lessons.</TE>
<TE>   The plan works, providing Mark with the wherewithal to defend
himself. Aron, too, in a metaphorical sense, has become a boxer:
Although far from bellicose, he goes through life in a defensive
mode: alert, self-protective, determined not to be victimized again.
Yet as Mark grows up, father and son find it increasingly difficult
to understand one another.</TE>
<TE>   Aron's conversations and interactions with other people, including
with the interviewer, provide Becker with opportunities to touch on a
variety of issues such as the treatment of former Nazis, the bombing
of Hiroshima and immigration to Palestine. Tersely, yet vividly,
Becker conveys how his characters feel, and why. In their
unpretentious, plain-spoken exchanges, the large questions are
epitomized and crystallized with admirable economy and
expressiveness. Restrained, yet quietly intense, "The Boxer" has a
veracity and scrupulousness that place it in a class of its own.</TE>

<DH>THE GHOST WITH TREMBLING WINGS: Science, Wishful Thinking,
and the Search for Lost Species, By Scott Weidensaul, North Point
Press: 342 pp., $26 THE EXTINCTION CLUB By Robert Twigge, William
Morrow: 222 pp., $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANICE P. NIMURA</AU>
<BD>Janice P. Nimura is a contributor to numerous
publications, including the New York Times, the Washington Post and
the Chicago Tribune.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scott Weidensaul ranks among an elite group of
writer-naturalists--Bruce Chatwin, John McPhee and David Quammen come
to mind--whose straightforward eloquence elevates ecology to the
level of philosophy. Weidensaul never holds forth; he describes and
explains as if you were hiking next to him, and, at least until you
close the book and start thinking seriously about mosquitoes,
scorpions and leaking tents, you wish you could sign on for his next
field trip. "The Ghost With Trembling Wings" is more than a lament
for species in peril, it is a meditation on the intersection of
biology and hope, and a peripatetic exploration of the complexities
of conservation.</LD>
<LD>   If all you read is the jacket copy, Robert Twigger's "The
Extinction Club" sounds as if it might make a good companion volume.
It promises to tell the story of the odd-looking Pere David deer,
known in its native China as Milu, where for centuries it existed
only in the emperor's forbidden game park. On the brink of extinction
a century ago, it was snatched from the chaos of the Boxer Rebellion
and brought to the English estate of the 11th Duke of Bedford, where
a herd still survives.</LD>
<TE>   But though Weidensaul sets out to follow the faint traces of
missing species through the remotest reaches of places such as
Tasmania, Brazil and St. Lucia, as well as the dusty archives of
natural history museums around the world, Twigger seems more
interested in the circuitous and unmarked pathways of his own mind.</TE>
<TE>   Weidensaul builds thoughtful, thought-provoking conclusions from
meticulous (and sometimes painful) research. Twigger, magpie-like,
assembles a collection of glittering historical curiosities and uses
them to decorate a book that is essentially about himself.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn a lot--about biology, natural history and human
nature--from Weidensaul. "The Ghost With Trembling Wings" is,
variously, history, travelogue, adventure story and ecological
mystery, packed with intriguing data but never mired in it.</TE>
<TE>   Weidensaul has a keen eye, a deft wit and a knack for narrative
momentum. A subtitle as broad as his invites fuzzy thinking, but he
presents the shape of his ideas in a crisp spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   First, there are the species that haven't been seen in a long
time, relatively ordinary creatures whose gradual disappearance makes
them suddenly notable, like "a relative who isn't appreciated until
she's gone."</TE>
<TE>   Weidensaul opens the book with an account of his own search for
the Caribbean Semper's warbler, an otherwise "dull little bird" that
has been sighted only a handful of times in the last 80 years, and
then proceeds to cite a menagerie of tantalizing absentees from the
Costa Rican golden toad to the ivory-billed woodpecker of the
American South. But proving a negative is next to impossible--"an
absence of evidence is not evidence of absence," and Weidensaul
proceeds to list cases in which a species takes itself off the
extinct list by showing up, like the Indian forest owlet or the
prehistoric coelacanth, rediscovered by canny sleuthing or,
sometimes, dumb luck.</TE>
<TE>   Their stories make headlines, but the celebration may be
misplaced--maintaining a viable population of a severely endangered
species in the wild is like "trying to build an airplane without
instructions," a process of trial and error so intricate and
expensive that each black-footed ferret bred in captivity for release
back to the Great Plains costs an estimated $10,000 to produce.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, there are the animals that probably aren't there at
all, but that humans keep on sighting anyway, from black panthers in
the hedgerows of central England to the Yeti. So what keeps us
fascinated, either by the missing species or the ones that may not
exist at all?</TE>
<TE>   "We want there to be hidden valleys and unclimbed crags, forests
where the shadows linger, rivers whose sources remain unknown," he
explains, a desire that springs in part from the uncomfortable
knowledge that the Earth's extinction rate--roughly 30,000 species
per year, the highest in 65 million years--is a direct result of our
presence.</TE>
<TE>   And, especially in the case of the larger carnivores, there is a
spiritual component to ecological loss: "Our nerves remember, even if
our waking minds do not. When wild country loses its pinnacle
predator, that loss leaves a hole, and it's one that we notice, if
only subconsciously." A big cat, in those terms, can become a "totem
of wilderness," and the unlikely reports of its presence "an
unarticulated longing for a less denuded, less denatured
environment." What "lost" species provide, Weidensaul concludes, is
"an opportunity for hope."</TE>
<TE>   "The Ghost With Trembling Wings" is vividly eclectic but somehow
always unified; Weidensaul never loses sight of his Big Idea.
Twigger, a British journalist, seems not to have had one in the first
place.</TE>
<TE>   "The Extinction Club" is composed of brief vignettes in many
modes: historical, fictional, confessional, ironic, self-mocking and
occasionally earnest. This kind of creative nonfiction demands a
strong narrative voice, but Twigger too often hides behind a smirking
sarcasm that makes him hard to trust. The phone call in which his
agent suggests he write about Milu is cast as a mini-screenplay, at
the conclusion of which author and agent exclaim together: "It's
Bambi with history!"</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, there is a good deal of information here about the
actual deer: its exalted place in Chinese lore, its identification by
the Basque missionary who became its namesake, its life today in
Bedfordshire. But in the course of his research, Twigger is willingly
distracted, whether by the branching paths of history or by his own
musings--the Pere David becomes a convenient platform for a zany
meditation on extinction, survival and writer's block. The
endearingly eccentric veers perilously close to the annoyingly
egocentric; the book's subtitle could have been "What I Thought About
While I Was Supposed to Be Writing About That Deer."</TE>
<TE>   What he thought about can be entertaining, ranging from the petty
insecurities of the semi-obscure writer to the nature of truth to
fin-de-siecle Anglo-Chinese pornography. But these jump-cut ideas pop
like soap bubbles without a larger theme, and the best one Twigger
can muster is that "everything old and interesting and valuable was
just disappearing" --species, certainly, but also rare books,
traditional skills and human individuality.</TE>
<TE>   "The Extinction Club," full of fascinating loose ends and
unfinished thoughts, is a wasted opportunity. In "The Ghost With
Trembling Wings," Weidensaul comes across as the kind of guy you wish
you'd had as a professor in college: expert, eloquent, unpretentious
and infectiously excited about his material. Next to him, Twigger is
a grinning undergraduate, clever but flighty, and too undisciplined
to follow any path to a conclusion larger than himself.</TE>

<DH>SURVIVING THROUGH THE DAYS: Translations of Native
California Stories and Songs, Edited by Herbert W. Luthin, University
of California Press: 632 pp., $24.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG SARRIS</AU>
<BD>Greg Sarris is the author of "Watermelon Nights" and
the Fletcher Jones professor of creative writing and literature at
Loyola Marymount University. He is serving his sixth elected term as
chairman of the Federated Indians of the Graton Rancheria in Santa
Rosa.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My great-grandfather caused the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. It was
in a contest of power with another shaman or, as we say, Indian
doctor near the town of Bodega, about 50 miles north of the big city.
He was a Coast Miwok, known to the local nonnative community simply
as an old Indian named Tom Smith.</LD>
<LD>   About the earthquake, fact or fiction? Depends on whom you ask.
California native peoples produced--and clearly continue to
produce--stories as wondrous and complex as the landscape itself. And
it was this landscape of redwood forests, foothills and wide-open
plains, deserts and ocean shores that was home to one of the most
linguistically and culturally diverse peoples in the world, indeed a
home that was the most densely populated in North America at the time
of first European contact.</LD>
<TE>   Most Californians know little more than what they learned in
fourth grade about the state's indigenous peoples: that the Indians
were in the missions. Although scholars, most often linguists and
anthropologists, recorded and translated an abundance of stories and
songs from various California Indian tribes, most of the work has
remained on wax cylinders and tapes locked away in university
basements or serving as reference material for dissertations. The
small amount of material available to the general public has usually
been as significantly rewritten stories for children or anthologized
stories devoid of information about the culture and storyteller from
which the tale comes.</TE>
<TE>   Without cultural context, the stories often seem flat, at best
confusing. Translations, even by the most sensitive scholars, can jar
an English reader's sensibility. Seemingly meaningless repetition,
for example, or language that is forever elliptical and allusive can
be maddening, keeping the reader from any understanding of the text
that might transgress his or her culturally biased beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   The task, then, in presenting a book of California Indian stories
and songs to the general public in a meaningful way is daunting. Yet
Herbert W. Luthin has managed to assemble a sampling of California's
native oral literatures in translation so that we can not only
appreciate the richness and complexity of the texts but, as a result,
can also see and understand, in a way so many of us haven't before,
the place we call home.</TE>
<TE>   Luthin divides the selection of stories and songs according to
four geographic regions: northwestern, north-central, south-central
and southern. The cartographic approach, though arbitrary in that a
geographic region doesn't necessarily delineate distinct cultures and
languages, lends a shared landscape to the texts, if nothing else.
And it is the particular features of that landscape that figure so
prominently in the stories and songs. A mountain range, an
outcropping of rocks, a small spring may serve as mnemonic pegs on
which legend and tradition hang.</TE>
<TE>   Luthin prefaces each of his 27 selections with an introductory
essay, anticipating "confusions and [to] fill in some of the cultural
gaps." Each selection contains a single tale or a series of songs. He
also provides readers with suggestions for more reading with each
selection in case "problems nag or an interest is kindled."</TE>
<TE>   The introductory essays prove particularly helpful, explaining
within specific cultural contexts those textual features--such as
repetitions and elliptical and allusive language--that might
otherwise stump the reader. Linguist Robert Oswalt, introducing the
Southern Pomo tale "The Trials of Young Hawk," as narrated by the
late elder Annie Burke, not only gives a concise history of the
Southern Pomo in Sonoma County and a description of their culture,
but also writes about ritual numbers, personal names and kinship
terms pertinent to the tale.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the heavyweights in the field of California Indian
languages and cultures--William Bright, Catherine Callaghan, Dorothy
Demetracopoulou, Leanne Hinton, Oswalt and William Shipley--also
contribute essays. The giants of anthropology are here, too: J.P.
Harrington, Dell Hymes and Alfred Kroeber. Yet Luthin doesn't use the
so-called experts to explain "Indian culture." In footnotes to the
introductions and elsewhere, he often comments on methods used for
the translation of the respective tale and notes antiquated attitudes
toward native people that the scientists, though well-meaning, may
have held, say, at the early part of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   Further, Luthin often uses native scholars and storytellers to
introduce stories and songs from their cultures, allowing them the
opportunity to comment on the effectiveness of the translations and
so forth. Julian Lang, noted Karuk scholar and storyteller, writes
about how "the awesome power and energy of the Ikxareeyav, the spirit
inhabitants of myth-time, was unleashed with the telling [of mythical
tales]" for the Karuk people and then comments on the story "Coyote
and Old Woman Bullhead," told to an anthropologist 70 years ago.
Loren Bommelyn tells his story in his native Tolowa and translates it
into English.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the introductions, however helpful, can only heighten our
sense of what is, for the most part, already apparent about these
stories and songs: their poignancy, humor and sheer beauty. In
"Creation" by Eastern Pomo narrator William Ralganal Benson, you find
that the present world is accounted for not only by a single Creator,
or God, but as a result of action and dialogue between two God-like
spirits, Marumda and his elder brother, Kuksu, both of whom mature as
characters as they create Earth and its people.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Contest Between Men and Women," a Tubatulabal tale from
the state's south-central part that accounts for gender roles played
out in the tribe, you can't miss the bawdy humor when a mythical
woman who hasn't seen men feels their presence, noting, "the edge of
my vagina is shaking." Nor can you miss the provocative power of a
love song, as when Wintu singer Harry Marsh chants:</TE>
<TE>   Hinini, hinini</TE>
<TE>   Hinini, hinini</TE>
<TE>   Where he walks about, where he walks about,</TE>
<TE>   Pushing the deer decoy away from his face,</TE>
<TE>   Right there in front of him</TE>
<TE>   May I come gliding down and fall!</TE>
<TE>   Hinini, Hinini</TE>
<TE>   Hinini, Hinini</TE>
<TE>   or the grace and beauty of the song from which Luthin takes the
title of the book, "Chalaawaat Song," sung by the late Luiseno elder
Villiana Calac Hyde, of the Rincon Reservation in San Diego county:</TE>
<TE>   I suppose I've survived the first little month</TE>
<TE>   I suppose I've survived the first big month</TE>
<TE>   Oh, I am surviving through the days</TE>
<TE>   I am surviving through the days.</TE>
<TE>   In an informative essay on Native California oral literatures at
the end of the book, Luthin relates that "estimates of the
pre-Contact Native population range from a conservative 310,000 to
nearly a million. By the end of the nineteenth century, that
population had fallen to 20,000 or even less--even at the most
conservative estimate, a loss of more than 90 percent .... Genocide
is a hard word but the only right one for what took place." Yet
despite the brutal history Native Californians experienced with the
Spanish, Mexican and early American invasions, they indeed survive
the days, and it is to Luthin's credit that he gratefully
acknowledges so many of the Native storytellers and singers who
worked with the linguists and anthropologists to keep their
traditions alive, among them Benson, Mabel McKay, Grace McKibbin,
Hanc'ibyjim, Lucy Thompson, Mary Yee and, yes, Ishi.</TE>
<TE>   This collection is more than testimony to the tenacity of the
human spirit, as if that were not enough. The stories teach and heal.
Imagine what it meant--and might yet mean--to live in a world where
people with different languages and cultures got along with one
another for more than 10,000 years, where bilingualism--even
trilingualism--was the rule, not the exception, where the world was a
garden, where there was very little physical warfare and where
respect was considered the highest virtue. Darryl Babe Wilson, in his
Atsugewi Creation tale "Kwaw Labors to Form a World," reminds us that
all of the myths, tales and songs herein are "lesson-legends" and
that "not long ago there was great magic in the land of my people."
Linda Yamane, a Rumsien Ohlone from the San Francisco Bay Area, says
"the stories help non-Indians feel more connected to the place where
they live [which] gives them a better understanding--not just a
mental understanding but an emotional understanding."</TE>
<TE>   And speaking of Yamane, I wonder what she'd think about my
great-grandfather's causing all that shaking in her tribal land. Had
she heard about Tom Smith? And what stories does she have for me? Oh,
how we keep talking. And how fortunate that so many now have the
opportunity to listen with Luthin's spectacular new reader.</TE>

<DH>YOUTH: Scenes From Provincial Life II, By J.M. Coetzee,
Viking: 170 pp., $22.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE SIEGEL</AU>
<BD>Lee Siegel is a contributing writer to Book Review and
the recipient of the 2002 National Magazine Award for reviews and
criticism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Are J.M. Coetzee and V.S. Naipaul the same person? More likely they
drink from the same inspirational well, like two men on a desert
island sharing a canteen. "Youth: Scenes From Provincial Life II,"
the second volume of the South African Coetzee's fictionalized
autobiography, and Naipaul's "Half a Life," the Nobel laureate's far
more fictionalized but equally autobiographical novella (published in
the fall), might well have been created by a single sensibility.</LD>
<LD>   Both are portraits of an artist's development; both present a
dismal picture of artistic frustration expressed through sexual
despair; both are set in London, to which city the protagonist in
each book has fled from his colonial birthplace. And both novellas
are written in an eerily similar pared-down style, through which
irony and humor pass like a chill wind almost imperceptibly stirring
the naked branches of a thoroughly disenchanted sensibility. John,
"Youth's" protagonist, even has a sympathetic Indian friend who
shares with John a dangerously marginal cast of mind.</LD>
<LD>   The ideal form of the novelist's fictionalized account of his or
her artistic growth is, of course, James Joyce's "Portrait of the
Artist as a Young Man," another novel written by a young colonial
inhabiting a repressive, parochial culture.</LD>
<TE>   Like Stephen Dedalus, Joyce's persona in that novel, the
mysterious protagonist of "Boyhood: Scenes From Provincial Life," and
now "Youth," awakens to the tug of libido and the pull of the
imagination at the same time. As Dedalus sits in class listening to
the priests describe the torments of hell that await carnal sinners,
he feels the "lambent" flame of desire flickering on his cheek.
Joyce's ingenious language represents a beautiful reversal of values:
Christ, the "lamb" of God, is restored from an inhuman, punitive
eschatology to the redemptive realm of fleshly human joy.</TE>
<TE>   Though Coetzee has Joyce's novel very much on his mind, "Youth"
has nothing of Joyce's affirmative poetry. It is a dark, dour and
depressing book. Having graduated from college, John finds himself in
an increasingly violent and repressive South Africa. After the
Sharpeville riots, he abandons, in one stroke, both a political
system he detests and a stifling mother and a failure of a father who
weigh his destiny down like stones in his pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Joyce, about to embark for Paris at the end of his novel, famously
sought to "forge ... the uncreated conscience of my race." "Youth"
begins, as it were, where "Portrait" leaves off, in a new place far
from the old constraining conditions. Yet, rather than finding
liberation and the consummation of his destiny, John begins a steep
decline into loneliness and self-doubt and creative paralysis.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear why Coetzee, the author of several universally
acclaimed novels--"Waiting for the Barbarians" and "Age of Iron" are
the two best known--has begun using the form of the novel to examine
his own life. Much of his fiction has bordered on parable and
allegory; he is less powerful when taking up a realistic style.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the unremitting despair of the young Coetzee in these two
volumes explains the mature novelist's flight into allegory. His
excruciatingly beautiful laconic style makes the perfect counterpoint
to expansive symbolic content. However, in a realistic setting, the
style comes across as almost redundant. Only Hemingway could apply a
matter-of-fact style to matter-of-fact subject matter, and that was
because his plain surface was actually highly mannered artifice.
Coetzee has no manner. His style is as affectless as his protagonist.</TE>
<TE>   In London, John, trained in mathematics but aspiring to high
artistic achievement, lands a soul-killing office job with IBM. He
drifts with equal soullessness from woman to woman, lacerating
himself for his lack of prowess and passion. His attempts at poetry
and then prose come to naught. He fails at friendship. Like the
protagonist of "Half a Life," he fears that he is following in his
ne'er-do-well father's footsteps. His mother's letters arrive like
infantilizing blows to his ego. John seizes on every setback and
drives it like a dagger into his self-image.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, an enormous vanity underlies John's self-dislike.
Somewhere deep inside him is the certainty of an exceptional fate.
Indeed, he interprets every horrendous experience as one more step in
the life of an artist: There is the lesson of sexual experimentation
and disillusionment; the lesson of what he pleases himself to think
of as madness; the lesson of total alienation from one's fellow
humans, etc.</TE>
<TE>   These bursts of naivete are sometimes funny and always, and
deliberately, ludicrous. But they are also apprehensions of the way a
fresh and open mind grows into its special destiny: "He is ready for
romance, ready even for tragedy, ready for anything, in fact, so long
as he will be consumed by it and remade." Such a sentiment is both a
comical absurdity and a profoundly truthful ambition. John's naivete
allows reality to enter his consciousness unobstructed by the caution
experience teaches.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, John's extravagant self-criticisms are his way of
sharpening the "splinter of ice" Graham Greene once said lay inside
every artist's heart. The fruit of John's dramatic tussle with
himself is the distance from self that is the essential quality for
making art. This is why, though "Youth" is autobiographical, Coetzee
has written it in the third person. It is the "I" rinsed of its ego,
shorn of its self-interest.</TE>
<TE>   Though "Youth" and "Boyhood" are like etudes, limbering-up
exercises for a writer capable of much greater writing, they offer a
nice antidote to present-day memoirs. They demonstrate, to anyone who
is interested, that there is a way to write about one's life without
writing about one's self.</TE>

<HD>The Mosaic of Plenitude</HD>
<DH>REVERSIBLE MONUMENTS: Contemporary Mexican Poetry, Edited
by Monica de la Torre and Michael Wiegers, Copper Canyon Press: 678
pp., $20 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ILAN STAVANS</AU>
<BD>Ilan Stavans is the Lewis-Sebring professor in Latin
American and Latino culture at Amherst College and the author of
"Octavio Paz: A Meditation." His book "On Borrowed Words: A Memoir of
Language" was recently issued in paperback.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It might still be difficult to assess the influence Octavio Paz
exerted over Mexican literature--especially over poets and
poetry--throughout the 20th century. Like T.S. Eliot in Britain and
the United States, Paz was at once a role model, a source of
inspiration and a fearful tyrant. His charisma, voracious appetite,
encyclopedic knowledge and eclectic talents opened up Mexico to the
world. But he also eclipsed others, and his gargantuan standing
distorted a landscape that was understood abroad only through his
personalized lens.</LD>
<LD>   "Reversible Monuments," an ambitious anthology of present-day
poetry from Mexico edited by Monica de la Torre, a translator and
graduate student at Columbia University, and Michael Wiegers, the
managing editor of Copper Canyon Press, is as appropriate an
instrument as any to estimate the health of poets south of the border
and to ponder the landscape after Paz's aesthetic battles were
fought.</LD>
<LD>   The title comes from one of Paz's "Topopoemas," which, the editors
write, is a "concrete poem in the shape of a rhombus that has
different images that reflect on each other vertically as well as
horizontally. The poem can be read in many different directions, in
the same way one can read poems in translation. The poem is circular,
has neither a beginning nor an end."</LD>
<TE>   They add: "We like to think in these terms about translations,
which are never final, and about generations of poets who owe as much
to the poets who came before them as to the ones ahead of them who in
turn will keep their poetry current."</TE>
<TE>   The anthology is made up of 31 authors, handsomely rendered in
English. The format is bilingual, with Spanish and English versions
facing each other. The volume was born in a 1998 exchange, sponsored
by the Academy of American Poets and the Mexican Cultural Institute
in New York, which enabled six poets from each country to read del
otro lado--on the other side of the divide. Once the exchange was
finished, De la Torre and Wiegers invited dozens of other Mexican
poets born since the middle of the 20th century (with one justifiable
exception, born in 1934) to submit samplers of their work.</TE>
<TE>   The result is, for the most part, enthralling. On occasion a
translation stumbles, but this is to be expected when more than two
dozen translators, both experienced and untrained, are involved. Some
of the editorial choices are questionable too, but no anthology can
fully satisfy the conflicting demands of its readership. This work
succeeds in that it makes a statement about the state of the universe
at a given time and place. Through his numerous translations of other
people's poems (from the French, English, etc.) and also in his
capacity as editor in chief of the monthly literary magazine Vuelta,
Paz served as a bridge between Mexico and the rest of the world. As
one of his legion of assiduous followers south of the Rio Grande, I
became acquainted with Joseph Brodsky and Nadezhda Mandelstam, with
Milan Kundera and Hans Magnus Enzensberger.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of such acquaintance is everywhere in "Reversible
Monuments," composed of works from the generation of Mexican poets
that came of age in the 1970s and '80s as contemporaries of the world
and not, as was the case before World War II, in a parochialism that
turned the country into an island of sorts. The authors are
multifarious in their inspiration: echoes of Isaac Babel, Novalis,
"The Iliad," Seamus Heaney, the poets of the Spanish Civil War, the
critic Damaso Alonso and the colonial nun Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz
are amplified in this box of resonance.</TE>
<TE>   This is also a generation that moved away from a dogmatic
ideological engagement that was sine qua non in 1960s Latin America.
Take David Huerta, born in 1949 and responsible for "Incurable,"
arguably the longest poem in Mexican literature. Huerta's father,
Efrain (born in 1914, the same year as Paz) is known as Mexico's
Pablo Neruda: a committed leftist whose poetry ranges from propaganda
to moments of rare candor. Efrain belongs to the generation that
matured around the magazine Taller, whose readers used the Spanish
Civil War, fascism and Stalinism as points of reference. His poetry
is one of battle, hope and denunciation, enlightening people to the
inhumanity of capitalism.</TE>
<TE>   In David Huerta's verses, ideology is pushed to the margins. Even
though his model remains the politicized but sentimental Neruda ("it
happens that I grow tired of being a man"), Huerta is far more
individualistic and more cynical than his father. His verses are
ornate, cerebral, bookish, apocalyptic to the point of abstraction,
as in his "Bolero at Armageddon:"</TE>
<TE>   Let the world under law be smashed to bits, startled fingernail</TE>
<TE>   covered in grime, silent path, and last conflagration.</TE>
<TE>   The saxophones of Jericho, the plutonium crossbows, the goodbye</TE>
<TE>   you gave me with a frown: what way is this</TE>
<TE>   for things to end, what cluttered form of collapse, I, you, the</TE>
<TE>   cacophonous shadow deleting the world ....</TE>
<TE>   The spirit that emanates from "Reversible Monuments" is the
product of migrations--a pluribus, a symphony able to celebrate
Mexico not as a collection of folkloric paraphernalia. Fabio Morabito
is Egyptian and Italian; Gerardo Deniz (a.k.a. Juan Almela) is a
descendant of Iberian emigres; and Gloria Gervitz's Judaism infuses
her explorations with an inquisitiveness allowed only to itinerant
souls. (She is the author of the memorable "Shajarit" and "Yiskor,"
only fragments of which have been published in this country.) Mexico
emerges as a mosaic of backgrounds, Emersonian in its quest to
establish a connection between the poet and the Muses. The Frida
Kahlo syndrome, the emphasis on the autochthonous at the expense of
authenticity, is, fortunately, absent.</TE>
<TE>   These are poets in conversation with their ancestors: Quevedo,
Jorge Luis Borges, Vicente Aleixandre. Sounds become voluptuous. The
endless possibilities of alliteration are delved into without
hesitation. Poets like Coral Bracho, Antonio Deltoro and Eduardo
Milan squeeze the music out of words and the result is hypnotic.
Female voices are handsomely represented, which, to my knowledge, is
an exception in anthologies of this sort, from Paz's "An Anthology of
Mexican Poetry," published in 1958, bizarrely translated by Samuel
Beckett, to an anthology edited by Mark Strand in 1970 and onward to
volumes published in the early '90s under the editorship of Forrest
Gander and Juvenal Acosta.</TE>
<TE>   For example, poet Pura Lopez Colome is fascinated by the
melodiousness of rhetoric exemplified by her translations of Paul
Celan. There is an atheistic religiosity in her oeuvre, a lack of
sincerity that is effective. (To her translator, she said: "Sincerity
and veracity are distinct.") She seems to be stationed in a single
place while the labyrinthine universe rotates around her. Her poetry
is an alchemy through which she lets herself travel, as if in a
dream, though the layers of stimulation that envelope her, such as in
her work "Death of the Kiss:"</TE>
<TE>   formed of loving, desiring, deciphering the pure,</TE>
<TE>   the impure figure, a language that says</TE>
<TE>   In the beginning</TE>
<TE>   conjugated and sublimated:</TE>
<TE>   I am that I am,</TE>
<TE>   come to me,</TE>
<TE>   approach with your mouth open,</TE>
<TE>   feel my breath,</TE>
<TE>   fill yourself on the Name,</TE>
<TE>   open your eyes and you will see</TE>
<TE>   Nothing.</TE>
<TE>   The most enjoyable feature in "Reversible Monuments" is the
inclusion of non-Spanish-language poets, the palpitating verses of
poets active in pre-Columbian tongues, such as Nahuatl, Tzeltal,
Zoque, Mayan. Among them is Buffalo Conde (a.k.a. Pedro Perez Conde),
whose pieces in the guttural Tzeltal are paraphrases of the Song of
Songs. Conde's choice of ur-text is significant: He seeks to
reconcile the Bible and pre-1492 mythology, to chant the affairs of
King David in a non-European speech--a subversive endeavor, no doubt,
yet one perfectly in tune with the mestizaje, the cross-fertilization
of races and languages that has formed Mexico since the arrival of
the Iberian conquistadors. One of the three poems by Conde in the
volume is "Xnich k'anal tak'in" or "Flower of Gold:"</TE>
<TE>   Fountain in the orchard of my beloved,</TE>
<TE>   watermill sanctified in my honor,</TE>
<TE>   that flows from the fields where the buffalo rests:</TE>
<TE>   come here my legendary Beloved.</TE>
<TE>   "I've come to my field, oh beloved, my companion;</TE>
<TE>   I've drank of my water and my juice, my wife:</TE>
<TE>   now you should drink plentifully of this juice, my beloved."</TE>
<TE>   It is the voice of my husband that calls.</TE>
<TE>   The poetry of Juan Gregorio Regino, who writes in Mazatec; and of
Victor Teran and Natalia Toledo, who write in Zapotec, is stirring.
Its inclusion is an accomplishment. In the past "alternative" voices
have seldom had a large audience. Not too long ago, W.W. Norton
released an estimable anthology, "In the Language of Kings," edited
by Miguel Leon-Portilla and Earl Shorris, in which Mesoamerican
letters were traced from the 13th century to the present. The
continuity proved that Spanish, the weapon of imperial Spain in the
16th century, managed only halfheartedly to homogenize the population
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean, and that aboriginal traditions
remain alive, even under the mantle of modernity.</TE>
<TE>   This is evident in the wake of the Zapatista movement in Chiapas
that erupted in 1994 just as the North American Free Trade Agreement
was implemented: The Indian past has not been altogether erased; it
is simply ignored by the status quo. The widespread popularity of
vocalists like Lila Downs, the daughter of a Mixtecan mother and a
gringo father, able to deliver her rhythms in English, Spanish and in
various pre-Columbian tongues, is proof that the return of the
indigena is not exclusive to literature and politics.</TE>
<TE>   Paz's magisterial presence is felt almost everywhere in this
volume. Indeed, he himself is a monument: a lighthouse, a map, a
compass. A few of the poets in this anthology invoke him directly,
yet the threshold he passed through is crossed instinctively, almost
mechanically, by his successors. Their habitat isn't a little town
made of tortillas but Western civilization as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   Paz, of course, inaugurated this trend, but they have gone beyond
his horizons: They have awakened to a democracy, a complicated system
of government that imposes demands on them that Paz never experienced
before he died in 1998, pluralism, and with it the eruption of an
Indian self in search of its place in the national pantheon. This
Mexico is polychromatic, and perhaps rowdy too--a welcome change.</TE>

<HD>Against the Odds</HD>
<DH>FOR SOLO VIOLIN: A Jewish Childhood in Fascist Italy, By
Aldo Zargani Paul, Dry Books: 230 pp., $15.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEXANDER STILLE</AU>
<BD>Alexander Stille is the author of several books,
including "Benevolence and Betrayal: Five Italian Jewish Families
Under Fascism" and "The Future of the Past."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the gradual passage of those who survived the Holocaust and
World War II as adults, we have an increasing number of memoirs of
the generation that experienced that time as children. Aldo Zargani
was born in 1933 and was 5 when Benito Mussolini passed the racial
laws that forced him to leave Italian public schools and cost
Zargani's father, a violinist, his job. Zargani was 7 when Italy
entered World War II and 10 in 1943, when Italy tried to withdraw
from the war and was occupied by Nazi Germany, forcing the
Zarganis--father, mother and two sons--to spend a terrifying year and
a half in hiding.</LD>
<LD>   "For Solo Violin" is a gracefully written, elegiac memoir of
childhood that effectively renders the pain, psychological
dislocation and fear of coming of age under the shadow of fascism's
racial laws and Mussolini's disastrous alliance with Hitler's
Germany. The book is a useful corrective to the many books and
articles that have tended to downplay the havoc that Mussolini's
racial policies wreaked because they stopped short of the
extermination program of Nazi Germany. As Zargani notes, he did not
distinguish as a child between fascism and Nazism because by the
German occupation of 1943, Italian fascists and German Nazis were
working together to arrest and deport the country's Jews.</LD>
<TE>   Zargani paints a number of affecting thumbnail sketches of the
many relatives and family friends who were captured and killed. While
others have stressed that Italy's Jews had among the highest survival
rates of Europe's Jewish population, Zargani notes that between a
quarter and a third of those left in the country by 1943 perished,
which, given the brevity of the Germany occupation, means that
deportation and death were hardly exceptional events.</TE>
<TE>   Because these are childhood memories, "For Solo Violin" is more a
series of fragmentary scenes and vignettes than a coherent, complete
narrative of the family's experience. Following the promptings of
memory, Zargani moves back and forth in time, producing a narrative
that is, at times, poetical and finely re-imagined but also, at
times, choppy and confusing. This impressionistic approach leaves us,
however, with some powerful memories that convey the sense of
material life at that time: the excitement and luxury of riding in an
automobile in Italy in the 1930s; learning to skin moles and cook
chestnuts during the terrible hunger and deprivation of the war; a
boy whose only word is "goat"; a poor, illiterate family that lives
on hunted cats and small-time theft.</TE>
<TE>   One vignette perhaps best sums up the weird combination of
anti-Semitism and generosity that Zargani experiences. After the war
ended, the old peasant woman who had helped hide his family asked
Zargani's mother: "Please explain to me, Madam, if you don't mind,
how nice people like you can eat babies every year at Easter?" The
woman had evidently absorbed the centuries of Catholic preaching
about Jewish ritual murder and yet it did not prevent her from
risking her life to save a Jewish family.</TE>

<DH>THE AGE OF GOLD: The California Gold Rush and the New
American Dream, By H.W. Brands, Doubleday: 550 pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WHITE</AU>
<BD>Richard White is the author of "'It's Your Misfortune
and None of My Own:' A New History of the American West." He is a
professor of American history at Stanford University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "The Age of Gold: The California Gold Rush and the New American
Dream," H.W. Brands, a wonderfully skilled narrative historian,
retells oft-told stories with such verve that he makes it easy to
understand why they were told in first place.</LD>
<LD>   But his exuberant retelling of episodes about mid-19th century
California also brings problems: Brands gilds these tales with
extraordinary claims of significance. He is not alone. Much of
popular history about the West these days couples familiar stories
with grand claims that they caused history to veer from its
accustomed tracks.</LD>
<LD>   The Civil War was a turning point in American history, but the
Pacific Railroad and the Gold Rush, let alone the Lewis and Clark
Expedition, do not rise to this standard. By attaching a plethora of
turning points to one section of the country during one part of a
century, popular history spins and staggers like a drunk. It's time
to sober up.</LD>
<TE>   Brands concentrates not so much on the Gold Rush as on various
figures who appeared, sometimes quite briefly, in California from
1849 through the early 1850s. They are an interesting, and familiar,
crew. He gets John C. Fremont from Allan Nevins' 1928 biography,
Fremont's memoirs and the writings of Fremont's much smarter wife,
Jessie. William Swain comes from J.S. Holliday's bestselling "The
World Rushed In." Holliday pretty much owns Swain, and the Gold Rush,
for that matter.</TE>
<TE>   Brands also makes extensive use of diaries and memoirs made
familiar in other recent histories. Like Patricia Limerick, Brands
gives a detailed account of William Manly's trip through Death
Valley, and like Susan Lee Johnson he uses Jean-Nicolas Perlot,
Vicente Perez Rosales and the real (and legendary) Joaquin Murieta.
The net effect is like watching a good lounge band do covers of
golden oldies. There is not much new, but the book is entertaining,
lively and reassuringly familiar.</TE>
<TE>   That the retelling of familiar stories about familiar people has
become the stock in trade of bestselling histories forces even an
academic historian such as Brands--whose profession rewards the
new--to conform to popular standards. Although he acknowledges the
recent burst of scholarship on the work on the Gold Rush and
California that accompanied the sesquicentennial, he has no intention
of following the new directions it took: Brands doesn't go near the
questions of race, sexuality and gender that Johnson explored.</TE>
<TE>   Here, good stories matter above all else. Manly's struggle through
Death Valley was dramatic, as were Fremont's often disastrous
travels. Brands is relatively easy on Fremont, who had a tendency to
get lost. His men had a tendency to get hungry, and sometimes,
according to rumors, ate each other. But the price of good stories is
sometimes a lack of context: Most overland migrants neither got lost
nor ate each other. They just walked a very long way, and what they
recorded was tedium.</TE>
<TE>   Brands spends roughly as many pages getting his various characters
to and from California as he spends detailing what they did while
they were there. The last section of the book follows the later
careers of people such as Fremont, as well as William Tecumseh
Sherman and Samuel Clemens. California sometimes seems to function
simply as a plot device to keep disparate stories about disparate
people together in a single volume.</TE>
<TE>   "The Age of Gold" has a multicultural lineup (only Indians are
given short shrift) with women migrants as well as men, but they take
their place in familiar plot lines: Sutter discovers gold; the world
rushes in by sea and land; San Francisco develops and the vigilantes
appear. Then follows the denouement: the Civil War and the railroads,
and, in a great leap, Silicon Valley. Brands hopes to create a kind
of Gold Rush mosaic--a whole larger than the attractive pieces.
Instead, we get more of a Rorschach test to which Brands attributes
certain meanings.</TE>
<TE>   The stories are so nicely told that it seems caviling to harp on
analytical shortcomings. Brands attempts to make his case that the
Gold Rush was a turning point in modern American history through a
series of breathless assertions and impressive free-associating. But
these assertions don't even attempt to grapple with some seemingly
obvious counter-arguments.</TE>
<TE>   The Gold Rush, Brands writes, marks the point where Americans
abandoned old ambitions of patiently acquiring a simple sufficiency
and became entranced with instant wealth. Except that, as Malcolm
Rohrbough has revealed through his study of miners' letters and
diaries, the argonauts came to California not for instant wealth but
because California promised them a shortcut to the farm or small
business--the independence and sufficiency--that they, like their
parents, desired. There was no sharp break.</TE>
<TE>   Though Brands suggests that California was central to the crisis
that brought on the Civil War, it was Kansas and the controversy
there over the expansion of slavery that served as the kindling.</TE>
<TE>   Brands also suggests that California gold was critical to the
Union victory, but it would be more accurate to say that
greenbacks--which were not secured by gold--and massive borrowing
through a new bond market were the key to the Union's financial
advantage. And though California was part of the new national market
that fueled American industrialism, it was only a small part.
California did not grow that much in the years following the Gold
Rush, and the new national markets were really formed through the
union of the East and the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   This entertaining book by an accomplished writer ends with the
Silicon Valley, and this may be fitting in a different way than
Brands intended. Silicon Valley, too, built a world of hype and
grandiose claims that it could not sustain. But it sure did make for
a good story.</TE>

<LD>The invites were out, the caterers booked and the glossy
centerpiece--a poster-sized image perched on an easel--was set up at
the host couple's house. Dale Franzen, director of the Madison
Theater project, had everything ready for her upcoming party. In
fact, she was looking forward to the chance to thank recent
contributors to the proposed $15-million, 500-seat performing arts
facility in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the Madison project's honorary chairman, Dustin Hoffman, was
wary of donor party business as usual. "Dustin said to me, 'Let's not
do any boring speeches,' " Franzen recalls. "But the purpose of a
party is usually to thank new donors, so there's a lot of boring
speeches that have to be made."</LD>
<LD>   What's a project director to do? Armed with a list of donors'
names she envisioned as the raw stuff of lyrics, former opera singer
Franzen enlisted the help of composer Alan Chapman. "I told him, 'I
want you to write me a song,' " she says. "I instigated what I'm
going to do from here on in, which is, I sang the song at the party."</LD>
<TE>   Recalling the tale, Franzen can't resist a reprise.</TE>
<TE>   Bread, bread</TE>
<TE>   We need a lot of bread....</TE>
<TE>   Theaters are expensive things to build....</TE>
<TE>   And all I'm hoping for</TE>
<TE>   Is 11 million more.</TE>
<TE>   She sings, in a clarion soprano that resonates through the doors
of her office and down the hallways of Santa Monica College's Madison
campus, on Santa Monica Boulevard between 10th and 11th streets,
where the theater is to be built.</TE>
<TE>   "And in between," she adds, back in speaking voice, "I thanked all
these donors."</TE>
<TE>   Brava! Apparently the ditty was a hit. "The next day, the phone
was ringing off the hook," Franzen recalls. "It's not like I'm a
shrinking violet anyway, but there's a million people out there
trying to get money from the same people. Everybody remembers who I
am now."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed. While artists have been singing for their supper for ages,
it's not the usual modus operandi of arts administrators. Yet given
the soft economy and a record number of Southland arts organizations
trolling for dollars to pay for new projects or expansions, it may be
just the kind of ingenuity that's needed.</TE>
<TE>   The project is not only on track, it has also gotten to this stage
relatively quickly as these things go. In the works for three years,
it probably will break ground next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically one-third of the money is in, and our hope is by the
time we do groundbreaking, somewhere in 2003, we will be close to
90%," says Piedad F. Robertson, Santa Monica College president. She
adds that a March donation of $1 million, from the Santa Monica
College Foundation, brought the funds raised to $4.5 million. "The
total amount needed for construction is $13 million and the total
project cost, when you figure other technologies and equipment, is
another $2 million to $2.5 million more."</TE>
<TE>   If all goes as hoped, the theater will become a significant
addition to a Westside performing arts landscape dominated, in terms
of mid-size and larger venues, by the Geffen Playhouse in Westwood
and the UCLA Center for the Performing Arts. Other ventures in the
works include the Mark Taper Forum's renovation of the Culver Theater
in Culver City, the Geffen Playhouse's plans for a second theater in
Westwood, and the Skirball Cultural Center's campaign to add an
amphitheater and other expansions of its facilities. The mid-size
options, particularly in Santa Monica proper, are limited. In fact,
although donors and others ask Franzen many questions, the one they
don't ask is why the theater should be built. "No one has said to me,
'We don't need this on the Westside,' " she says. "They all say we
desperately need this; why wasn't it done 10 years ago?"</TE>
<TE>   That's what inspired Hoffman to get involved. "In 1956, I was a
student at SMC and took my first drama class," says the actor, now in
London shooting a film. "Many years later, I was approached by the
college to become involved in the capital campaign of this new
theater, and I was very pleased to be able to give back and support a
school that meant so much to me in my early years of acting and to
help in the creation of a small, accessible theater for this
community where I live.</TE>
<TE>   "The more theaters, performances, artists, the more avenues for
young people to choose wonderful, productive alternatives that will
enhance their lives and the lives of the whole community," he adds.
"Here in Los Angeles we are coming into our own, culturally, and
realizing how theaters in every community should be the norm, the way
it is in Europe."</TE>
<TE>   Many people who live on the Westside are interested in the
performing arts, but not all of them are eager to travel downtown or
elsewhere. "I don't mind driving to get to the opera or the symphony.
But a lot of people, unless you make it very accessible, will not
participate," says Robertson. "This is a project that has the ability
to have an impact on this community for generations to come."</TE>
<TE>   The Madison site consists primarily of a former elementary school
built in the 1920s and a large parking lot. "Believe me, that is the
crux of the project," Franzen says. "Parking was everything--parking
and ladies' bathrooms."</TE>
<TE>   When Robertson, former secretary of education for Massachusetts,
came to Santa Monica College in 1995, the Madison site had fallen
into disrepair. "We spent $4.5 million bringing Madison up to code,"
she recalls. "When we looked at the auditorium, built in the 1920s,
it needed so much work that we just decided that we can't do anything
here."</TE>
<TE>   Franzen, who performed in many productions with Los Angeles Opera
during her singing days, had been exploring new career paths. In the
late '90s, she was a consultant to Santa Monica College on the
creation of the Academy for Entertainment and Technology, a campus
dedicated to classes for those who want to work in the entertainment
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson asked Franzen to develop a vision for the Madison site.
"I remember Dale standing up on the auditorium stage and starting to
sing," says Robertson, recalling their first visit to the
now-shuttered auditorium. "The two of us are a little bit crazy, so
it was a perfect combination."</TE>
<TE>   Franzen began by musing on her own experience. "I started to think
about what is missing in this community," says Franzen, who lives in
Topanga Canyon and is married to attorney Don Franzen. "My kids went
to the Santa Monica school district until we moved out of Santa
Monica, and I began to think about what was I missing here as a
parent, as a community member."</TE>
<TE>   She started researching other arts facilities, including New
York's 92nd Street Y, a multiuse cultural arts and education center,
which proved a key inspiration. "We began to think of this as a small
visual and performing arts center," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of that initial idea, the theater was one component, and very
quickly after that, the college decided to move the art gallery that
was on the main campus over here to enrich that idea. And the latest
idea is that they're going to move parts of the music department
here."</TE>
<TE>   The theater component will be high profile by virtue of Hoffman's
involvement. The Santa Monica College alumnus intends to form a
resident theater company at Madison that will offer two productions a
year, each running six to eight weeks. Hoffman is partnered in the
venture with theater producer Ron Kastner, whose credits include
"Angels in America" and revivals of "The Real Thing" and "True West."</TE>
<TE>   Plans for the theater have drawn praise and support from an
impressive array of arts stars, including Los Angeles Opera artistic
director Placido Domingo, dancer-choreographer Mikhail Baryshnikov,
actors Edward James Olmos and John Lithgow, and opera singers Marilyn
Horne and Frederica von Stade.</TE>
<TE>   In the interest of drawing more attention to the project, Franzen
didn't wait to have a building before she started programming free
performances at the site. Shows have included artists as varied as
African musician Prince Diabate, singer Lila Downs, tap dancer Mark
Mendonca, dancer-choreographer Lula Washington, L.A. Philharmonic's
brass trio and the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   This fall will mark the fourth year of free concerts, in addition
to other programs at Madison. "We're doing this mini-Russian festival
where we're bringing a young curator of an art gallery in St.
Petersburg to do an exhibit in our art gallery in January, and then
we're going to tie it in with some lectures and perhaps a reading of
a new play, and Russian singers will also do a concert."</TE>
<TE>   Because opera remains Franzen's first love, she launched a youth
opera camp in collaboration with Los Angeles Opera. The two
organizations will also team up to present a children's opera this
fall.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be premiering a new piece that Los Angeles Opera's
doing based on 'Girl of the Golden West,' " she says, referring to
the Puccini opera that will open the Los Angeles Opera season on
Sept. 4. " 'Girl of the Golden West' is not only about California,
it's about the Gold Rush, and the Gold Rush is fourth-grade
curriculum in the public school system."</TE>
<TE>   With fund-raising and programming moving forward, all that was
needed was the building. Santa Monica architect Renzo Zecchetto,
whose designs include the $78-million California Center for the Arts
in Escondido, was hired to design the theater.</TE>
<TE>   A primary goal was making the building accessible. Easy parking is
key, but there's more to it than that. "On the Westside there's
nothing of this sort that is easy to come to, that is accessible,
where you would park, go a few steps and be greeted by this nice
outdoor experience," Zecchetto says.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who come to the theater would park quickly and walk to the
entry garden. We have a circulation path where the elderly and those
in wheelchairs or whoever can be dropped off. Normally, you have to
go through the subterranean parking experience, and you have to work
hard to undo that negative. Access is a critical component of the
success of this."</TE>
<TE>   Although considerable thought was given to accessibility, the
interior design also posed challenges. Because the theater will
present a range of performing arts, the acoustics had to be variable.</TE>
<TE>   "Of all of our parameters, acoustical ones took precedence,"
Zecchetto says. "So the visuals are acoustic. We invented what we
call this orange peel, layers of double curving walls that reflect
sound in particular ways, for the musicians and the audience. We're
trying to create an atmosphere where the room remains the same
visually, so we have these layers where we conceal things. We placed
lighting and other needs of the theater in such a way where they're
integral to the design. You don't have the architecture, the
acoustics and the lighting: It's all one thing."</TE>
<TE>   The facility will have to accommodate not only a range of art
forms, but also the needs of Santa Monica College's curriculum. The
college will use the theater 35% of the time. It will serve as an
educational facility Monday through Thursday mornings, and be used as
a lecture hall Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evenings.</TE>
<TE>   That will still leave plenty of room for Franzen's programming.
She anticipates relying mostly on presenting rather than producing,
at least initially. "The first three years, I'll start with 15% to
20% producing because I'm assuming that it's going to take me the
first year or two just to get my feet off the ground," she says.
Finding the artists won't be a problem. There are more performers in
search of venues than venues in search of performers. "There are many
excellent companies right now that are performing in much smaller
venues," Franzen says. "They're ready to make a step to a larger
venue, but they don't have the internal nonprofit support."</TE>
<TE>   It's a step up for Franzen too, from on stage to offstage, from
being responsible for her own performance to supporting the work of
many performers. She views her new role as an opportunity to give
back not only to the communities of L.A. and Santa Monica, but also
to the community of artists.</TE>
<TE>   "In the climate we're about to go into, for at least the next two
years, the nonprofits in the city will have even less money," she
says. "One of the things I can do is pull up the slack there. I feel
like my passion for that aspect of this job is because I worked in
that world."</TE>

<LD>An Olmec head has landed, mounted on a lunar landing module, in the
Fisher Gallery at USC. Around it are car tires that suggest craters,
coiled silver-colored serpents, and an astronaut, a la Neil
Armstrong, planting a fluttering American flag--except this
spaceman's suit is encrusted with stone-textured snakes and hands,
his backpack contains a giant heart, and the flag is made of
perforated sheet metal, mounted on a pole of soldered chain links.</LD>
<LD>   Einar and Jamex de la Torre, brothers based in San Diego and
Ensenada, Mexico, are the creators of this elaborate installation
that dizzily melds pre-Columbian native mythology, Roman Catholicism
and American space exploration. It's a dramatic statement about the
"post-border condition," which is what the Fisher's latest
exhibition--"Mixed Feelings: Art and Culture in the Postborder
Metropolis," opening Sept. 4--intends to explore.</LD>
<LD>   Thirteen works by 15 artists were commissioned by curators Michael
Dear, USC professor of geology and director of the Southern
California Studies Center, and Gustavo Leclerc, a trained architect
and head of the university's Border Cultures Project. Because they
were particularly interested in addressing "space and place," the
works are all installations and/or videos.</LD>
<TE>   "We were interested in the way art and culture were reflecting
urban changes happening around us," says Dear, sitting with Leclerc
in the Fisher Gallery entry as the show is being installed. "A few
years ago, we began to look at art and work at the border, the border
being the most dynamic place in this country." He's talking
specifically about the U.S.-Mexico border, although the show
investigates other borders as well.</TE>
<TE>   With initial funding from the center and the Fisher Gallery, Dear
and Leclerc held a series of meetings with artists and writers who,
in their estimation, "were doing interesting work, exploring fluid
places to construct identity, hybridity and new types of
cosmopolitanism," Leclerc says. Their aim, Dear says, was for "as
much of a variety as possible--cross-race, cross-generational,
cross-gender." Of course, he adds, "they had to be good."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the participants live and work in the area that stretches
from Ventura County to Ensenada, which Dear and Leclerc consider a
single metropolis, "Bajalta." Most are also of Latin descent, and a
number, such as the De la Torre brothers, Laura Alvarez or Ruben
Ortiz Torres, live part-time in Mexico or visit there regularly.</TE>
<TE>   For the artists, the result is this exhibition; for the writers, a
book of essays will be published next year.</TE>
<TE>   The three main Fisher galleries feature three to five works each,
with one artist's work in an annex. Like the De la Torre brothers,
most jumble images borrowed from pop culture and show it transformed
by border crossings and exchanges. Mark Bradford's "Jericho" turns a
beauty salon chair into an idol, with the nearby doorway framed by
cast-plaster praying hands with nails painted in 10 imaginative
styles. Ortiz's "The Garden of Earthly Delights" is a customized lawn
mower that dances to music derived from sounds made by Latino
gardeners using the tools of their trade. The action is seen on
video.</TE>
<TE>   The lunar landing tableau of the De la Torre brothers' "Colonial
Atmosphere" dominates the adjoining gallery. In scale and complexity
of elements, it is perhaps the most ambitious of the works. The
10-foot-high Olmec module has custom-made glass panels, some embedded
with crushed aluminum cans--brands available on both sides of the
border--and a couple of panels replicating the famous Mayan
bas-relief in Palenque that UFO fanatics have labeled an ancient
space traveler.</TE>
<TE>   In the cockpit, a golden-haired cherub, in the pose of a Christ
child and covered with bits of green feathers, stretches out his
hands. It's a reference, according to the brothers, both to the Mayan
ruler Pakal and to Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent of Toltec
mythology.</TE>
<TE>   Other artists focus on more earthbound matters. Marcos Ramirez
Erre and Laura Alvarez address the very real phenomenon of Mexican
laborers crossing the border to find work. Based in Tijuana and San
Diego, Ramirez is a former construction worker who began exhibiting
artwork in 1989; one of his installations was included in the Whitney
Biennial in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Fisher installation, "Walls," recalls the skills, materials
and workaday experiences of his previous occupation. Two walls, one
made of brick and one of 2-by-6 framing studs, stand parallel to one
another, about six inches apart. Projected onto screens on each are
short videos. On the brick side, Mexican workers build a
brick-and-mortar wall using the traditional labor-intensive methods.</TE>
<TE>   "It is almost like a caress," Ramirez says. "It's not such a rush
as on the other side."</TE>
<TE>   The scenes projected on the other wall show Mexican workers in the
U. S. machine-assembling a frame wall with power saws and nail
drivers. The videos also include scenes of mealtimes. On the Mexican
side of the border, workers put up a makeshift grill, toss on
tortillas and share their food. In the U.S., each worker purchases
individual meals and beverages from a truck vendor, no sharing. For
Ramirez, it's about two ways of living and how "people tend to lose
their own identity when they cross the border."</TE>
<TE>   While Ramirez's videos use documentary footage, Alvarez has
invented a persona, Double Agent Sirvienta (played by herself), for
"Suenos Intermedios" (In Between Dreams). The protagonist is a
svelte, model-chic Latina housemaid--who's actually an undercover
agent trying to thwart the corporate takeover of local taco trucks.
She "infiltrates" households of wealthy white Westside families to
gather information about the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   "Her whole story is existing on both sides of the border," Alvarez
says. California-born and now Santa Monica-based, she has in the past
worked cleaning homes. Her character was also inspired by "watching
Mexican soap operas where a maid might be a minor character, but she
knows what's really going on in the household, she holds a lot of
power."</TE>
<TE>   Amalia Mesa-Bains is one of the few artists to directly address
the border as a physical entity. The Rio Grande is her subject in
"What the River Gave to Me."</TE>
<TE>   "I really wanted to do a river," says the artist by phone from her
home in Monterey.  "I've been aware of the increasing tensions around
the border, the militarization of the border." For her, the
exhibition was a chance to do something different from her familiar
altar-like installations dedicated to famous women, a chance to do
something a little more abstract.</TE>
<TE>   Set on a platform, "What the River Gave to Me" is made of
shattered plate-glass bits cascading between two earth-colored
shores. Mexican places of departure and American places of landing
are written into the two sides, and the names of those who made the
crossing are inscribed on blown-glass orbs that tumble, like bubbles,
over the surface of the riverbed. The names are largely illegible,
Mesa-Bains says, in order to be evocative rather than specific.</TE>
<TE>   "I've started to move into the idea of spiritual landscape," she
says, "where people look for the sign of the sacred in nature
itself." She also considers the work a memorial to those who died
crossing the border.</TE>
<TE>   California Conceptualist Norman Yonemoto, who often works as part
of a team, with his brother Bruce, chose to address the borders of
physical limitation. His " 'Self' Portrait" includes an office
cubicle containing a computer with an oversized monitor and a
wheelchair--Yonemoto uses a wheelchair because of a stroke.</TE>
<TE>   The monitor shows prerecorded searches on the Internet using his
name as the keyword and ends with animation of the continents
reuniting. For Leclerc, it's about "the Internet as a medium to
manipulate your borders--you could be anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Yonemoto says he see globalization as necessary to overcome the
concept of the Other, "capital O. The Internet is the symbol for this
globalization and how difficult it is to control. As far as I can see
there's no turning back."</TE>
<TE>   Even after two years of exploration, Dear and Leclerc aren't so
much defining the post-border metropolis as simply identifying it
through art.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been driven by a question about whether or not there is a
post-border art," Dear says. "My conclusion is that clearly it
exists. You can see that in the production of art and the existence
of a market that extends beyond New York and Mexico City. Something
new is going on here, something new is being manufactured."</TE>
<TE>   Leclerc doesn't want to overemphasize geographic or ethnic
specificity. Identity and place are important, he says, but these
artists "are really consciously looking for a new type of aesthetic."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, what makes the show satisfying are the basics. "These
are beautiful pieces," he says. "They have poetic, complex qualities
and multiple dimensions."</TE>

<DH>Tired of her loose-cannon image, Juliette Lewis seeks adult
roles like a single mom in an HBO film</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I get these comments, 'Oh my God, you're so much prettier in
person,' says Juliette Lewis, who looks so much prettier in person
than she does on screen.</LD>
<LD>   "It's kind of a backhanded compliment. 'Oh, so I've been ugly all
this time in film.' But I never played the vanity girl, so I don't
mind. I'd rather be the rebel, be harsh." There is nothing rebellious
or harsh about Lewis, at least at the moment. She is promoting a new
HBO movie called "Hysterical Blindness," directed by Mira Nair
("Monsoon Wedding") and airing tonight, about a pair of "Jersey
girls" on the other side of 25 who wonder where their youth--and
their youthful aspirations--went. Lewis plays a happy-go-lucky single
mom and long-suffering friend of Uma Thurman, who's very tall, very
permed and very blocked emotionally. It's a sidekick role, but Lewis
makes the most of it--without, as many actresses would, making too
much of it. It is possible to be too New Jersey.</LD>
<LD>   "It could be really kitsch and cliche because you're dealing with
two things: Jersey accents and the '80s," Lewis says.</LD>
<TE>   "There are some traps there. I never like people to think about
the technique or the accents. I just want people to feel me, so to
speak, just to feel the person. But you don't want to go too small
because the people are really colorful. I was looking at Uma and me,
and I could almost smell our hair.</TE>
<TE>   "Here are the facets of Beth," she continues, describing her
character. "She had a child at 17, so she's kind of stunted; she's
still like a teenager. 'I just want to have fun, what are we going to
do?' So she has that thing of being a teenager and not knowing her
level of responsibility yet."</TE>
<TE>   "She just embodied the part, literally," says Nair, laughing.
"Tube tops and miniskirts--she just carried it off with such elan."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis is best known as Nick Nolte's daughter in Martin Scorsese's
remake of "Cape Fear" (1991), in particular for a scene in which
Robert De Niro, playing an ex-con who is terrorizing her family,
sticks his fingers in her mouth. It's one of the most erotic and
disturbing screen moments in memory, and earned her an Oscar
nomination for best supporting actress.</TE>
<TE>   The 29-year-old Lewis, who was raised in the San Fernando
Valley--her parents are actor Geoffrey Lewis and Glenis Batley--has
been acting since she was 12. She became legally emancipated at 14
and performed in such films as "National Lampoon's Christmas
Vacation" (1989) and "Crooked Hearts" (1991).</TE>
<TE>   Although she appeared in a variety of films after "Cape Fear,"
including Woody Allen's "Husbands and Wives" (1992), "That Night"
(1993), "Kalifornia" (1993), and "What's Eating Gilbert Grape"
(1993), it's her role as gun moll Mallory Knox in Oliver Stone's
"Natural Born Killers" (1994) that cemented her image as a kind of
cinematic loose cannon. It's an image that has dogged her for years,
professionally and personally.</TE>
<TE>   "I think only narrow-minded people would think that, because for
the most part, other actors and filmmakers have gone, 'Oh, you've
done complicated work' and have given me respect," she says. "I can't
say for certain [that she's been typecast]. Maybe studio people. They
want predictability, what's comfortable, and I'm always trying to do
something different."</TE>
<TE>   Nair says a notion of Lewis based solely on her "Killers" role is
"such a limited vision of what Juliette Lewis can do. It's laziness
on the part of directors. I'm not trying to sound gooey about her,
but she can carry anything off because she's so thoughtful and she
has a process and she's so experienced. She makes it all look totally
effortless. I'd like to see her in a corset with an accent. That's a
stretch, you'd think, but she can do it."</TE>
<TE>   With big-screen nihilism on the wane toward the end of the '90s,
Lewis fell off the radar screen, displaced by less-threatening
ingenues like Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett. She may have been
able to present herself in a different light to directors and
executives who had pigeonholed her as a punk, but she says she
wouldn't play the publicity game--though she was in the public eye
because of a long relationship with Brad Pitt. A session in rehab and
an 18-month acting sabbatical probably didn't help her case either.</TE>
<TE>   "I always think the work should speak for itself and people should
see that more than see what you're wearing," Lewis says.</TE>
<TE>   "I never wore the right things or said the right things. So now
even though I'm in a second chapter of a career, whatever you want to
call it, it has to be about performance and material. Even 10 years
ago, there was less of this 'Do ABCD and you become a star.' There's
this socialite school practically. I would flunk out of that school.
So I just have to get good work."</TE>
<TE>   She starred in the 1999 Garry Marshall comedy "The Other Sister"
and a year later appeared in "The Way of the Gun," the directing
debut of "The Usual Suspects" writer Christopher McQuarrie, which
starred Benicio Del Toro and Ryan Phillippe. "I've done a couple of
movies [recently]. Some haven't gotten distribution. 'The Way of the
Gun' was in theaters for about a second."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis says that she first heard of the role in the HBO project
during a conversation with Thurman at a party about three years ago.
Thurman asked Lewis if she wanted to do a table reading. Although
that never happened, Thurman didn't forget about her. As it turns
out, Nair also had Lewis in mind, independently of Thurman, who had
been shepherding the project and is one of its producers.</TE>
<TE>   Now Lewis probably will be offered nothing but airhead roles. It
would be the path of least resistance for studios, especially since
she has a slightly spacey quality. ("Lamentably," Nair says of the
impression she gives. "But she isn't.") Now that she's 29--a fact she
brings up more than once--Lewis is eager for more adult roles,
perhaps in keeping with her settled personal life, which seemed to
suffer in the expectations game the same way her career did.</TE>
<TE>   "I think when I was younger I could give the appearance of being
aloof or disaffected," she says. "I was shy. I felt good for the most
part in front of the camera, even though I was self-critical. But
since I've grown, I'm not aloof; I'm expressive. It's probably been
the problem. I'm married now [to pro skateboarder Steve Berra, for
three years], but for a while I just scared guys away. I would just
say what I felt. I didn't play the game. I always thought, 'God, I
should have been mysterious.' Actually, mysterious is boring.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be mysterious. It's too much work. I would be
right in his face, 'God, I like you. We should hang out.' And then
you don't get the phone call."</TE>
<TE>   Nair thinks that Lewis will be getting calls in the wake of
"Hysterical Blindness." Among the ones Lewis would like to receive
would be an offer to do a romantic comedy although obviously it
wouldn't be conventionally warm and fuzzy. But it wouldn't be some
sort of renegade romance either.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't know that I'm a very lighthearted person and very
positive," Lewis says. "But you must know that it will be my own take
on it. And I don't mean neurotic. It'll be my own version. I have my
own idiosyncrasies, so they'll come out somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Hysterical Blindness" airs Sunday at 9:30 p.m. on HBO. The
network has rated it TV-14.</TE>

<DH>With a finger on the pulse of the local music scene,
bookers like Mitchell Frank have a talent for discovery</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If you ran into Mitchell Frank at a club, you'd probably think he's
just another guy making the scene. Stocky, laid-back and 40-ish, he
tends to wear sneakers and T-shirts sporting a picture of his baby
nephew.</LD>
<LD>   You would hardly guess that Frank is an arbiter of taste who's had
a hand in minting the "It" rock bands of this year and years past,
among them Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Clinic and the Vines. These
acts have recently popped up on the radar of mainstream music fans,
but Frank was hip to them in their obscure days. He brought the
now-celebrated Detroit duo White Stripes to Los Angeles three times
when it was mostly squeaking by as an opening act for Weezer and had
not yet been decreed the great hope of American rock 'n' roll.</LD>
<LD>   Frank, 41, is the talent booker for the Silver Lake club
Spaceland, and for a big chunk of the past nine years, he has
handpicked the nightly lineup there. The club sprouted in the
mid-'90s and under his direction morphed into the mother venue of the
alternative music scene in Los Angeles, showcasing the spectrum of
international independent rock, from garage rock to introspective
folk to cutting-edge electroclash.</LD>
<TE>   Spaceland remains a pit stop for artists on their way to
mainstream recognition, and a platform for some of the best local
bands. Everybody from Sean Lennon to Cornershop to Beck got up to
play on Spaceland's rinky-dink stage. And that was because Frank
thought they were cool enough to be there.</TE>
<TE>   Frank and his counterparts at some of the city's other key
nightclubs--the Troubadour, the Knitting Factory Hollywood, the
Garage, the Fold, et al-- are crucial links in the rock chain, the
people who plug curious music fans into nascent movements. By setting
the agenda for the club scene, they give music lovers a chance to
discover new bands, and offer touring acts an opportunity to make
converts, or at least gas money.</TE>
<TE>   Their job description? Preach the gospel of good music and make
sure that people come to listen. Embark on a needle-in-the-haystack
quest for the bands that are going to happen next, and book 'em
before anybody else does. Watch, inevitably, as said bands get too
big and famous to play clubs like Spaceland. Repeat.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the new bands that have broken big this year were not
discovered by record label scouts, but rather developed a steady
following by playing in small venues around the country until they
grew ripe and ready for big-time contracts.</TE>
<TE>   When acts reach that kind of critical mass, they move on to rooms
way larger than Spaceland, which fits about 260 people tops. And that
doesn't bother Frank in the least. "We're a knowing and willing
steppingstone. We take a band up the chain."</TE>
<TE>   Drawing crowds remains a concern, of course, but talent bookers
such as Frank say they are motivated by much more than financial
success. To the extent that a club has a personality, it is the
booker that develops it.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to book good bands, I think we definitely have a statement
about what we like," says Frank, sitting in his tiny office in
Glendale, where a tornado seems to have blown through and deposited
CDs, music magazines and posters. "It's like being a disk jockey with
live bands."</TE>
<TE>   Talent bookers in Los Angeles play a significant role in the fate
of musicians, says Ron Laffitte, an A&amp;R executive for Capitol
Records. "Those people have their fingers on the pulse more than
anybody," he says. "Some bookers are very good at identifying, before
it hits the mainstream, who the kids want to pay to see play."</TE>
<TE>   In the business of music, that is nothing short of the Holy Grail.</TE>
<TE>   So how do club bookers do what they do?</TE>
<TE>   The recipe is simple: a lot of disciplined research with a
sprinkling of witchcraft.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to be three to six months ahead of everybody else," Frank
says. A booker's goal is to ride a trend right before it crashes into
the mainstream--but not a minute too early. "Sometimes I was two
years ahead of the curve, but ideally, you want to be only three
months out there," he says.</TE>
<TE>   To keep abreast of trends, Frank and his booking partner, Jennifer
Tefft, check out everything from record charts to tour schedules to
magazines. He also goes to see bands play live around town and sifts
through tons of demonstration recordings.</TE>
<TE>   From this angle, the pursuit of cool can look a little geeky.
There is a lot of paperwork to be filled out, a fair amount of grunt
work (helping bands lift drum sets on stage, for example), a lot of
time spent in the office chatting on the telephone, shooting the
breeze with various elements clued in to the music scene.</TE>
<TE>   In that respect, a club booker is not unlike a reporter on the
police beat who routinely places rounds of calls to the cops just to
keep warm in case a big homicide story breaks. "I know a lot of bands
in town, so we interact with them. It's like a filter," Frank
explains. "If someone I know tells me there is a good band, I give
the band a call."</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows more than I do, but I just talk to them," says
Paul McGuigan, who booked bands for West Hollywood's Troubadour for
eight years.</TE>
<TE>   And you better be good with numbers, because a central part of
what a booker does is figuring out how much a band gets paid for
playing in a club. Fees range widely at these rooms, says McGuigan,
who after his stint at the Troubadour has been booking bigger bands
at larger venues for the promotion firm Goldenvoice. Local bands are
likely to make their money from a percentage of the ticket sales,
while touring acts usually get an upfront fee, which can range from a
few hundred to a few thousand dollars.</TE>
<TE>   In Frank's office, "The MBA Guide to Accounting and Finance"
occupies a prominent spot in his Ikea-style bookcase, and Frank has a
business degree under his belt. "Look at all these contracts," he
says, ruffling little mounds of paperwork strewn all over his desk.
There are even more contracts stuffed into several white filing
cabinets with orange trim.</TE>
<TE>   Propped against the wall is a wood cassette rack storing Frank's
prized collection of old demo tapes. They belong to some of the bands
Frank first booked at Spaceland, some of which remain obscure today
(Touchcandy, Giant Sand, PopDefect) and some of them better known,
such as Eels. "These are tapes of the bands I liked," he says, easing
them out of their plastic shells and handling them like valuable
china.</TE>
<TE>   Before he began booking in earnest, Frank, who grew up in L.A. and
lives in Los Feliz, dabbled in other music-related projects. He
played keyboards and percussion for Gutbucket, an act that combined
samples, live beats and rap into space-funk routines. He ran the
indie label Nickelbag in partnership with the Dust Brothers, and was
a fellow in the directing program at the American Film Institute
before leaving to run a recording studio with a friend.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1993, he started his first club prototype, Pan, at a
Top 40 and Latin music bar called Dreams on Silver Lake Boulevard.
The seeds that would eventually blossom into the epicenter of the
Silver Lake scene were planted there in early 1995, when Frank threw
himself into his most ambitious enterprise yet. It took two years of
nightly travails, he says, to launch Spaceland into orbit.</TE>
<TE>   He's still at it.</TE>
<TE>   These days, he may spend less time cobbling together every night's
lineup and more time overseeing the club's artistic direction, but
the fact is, he's in the office eight to 10 hours a day--sometimes on
weekends too. And he still finds time to see the acts he books--as
many as 15 shows a week, he says.</TE>
<TE>   He splits his time between Spaceland and the Echo, a smaller club
in Echo Park that specializes in DJ acts and dance fare, where he's a
co-managing partner and talent booker. Frank operates under the
banner of his own mini-booking agency, Spaceland Productions, which
was partly responsible for the impressive bill of this weekend's
Sunset Junction Street Fair, with Sonic Youth, grunge pioneers
Mudhoney and original riot grrls Sleater-Kinney among the headliners.</TE>
<TE>   Spaceland Productions, which works as an outside contractor for
the owner of the Silver Lake bar, also puts on the occasional rock
show at UCLA's Royce Hall, and Frank has plans to funnel his booking
smarts into a planned club network--"a la House of Blues, but with
smaller venues."</TE>
<TE>   Above all, Frank is still on the hunt for new cool, and depends on
his nose for spotting the one group with a bright future in a lineup
of competent ones. He stores several music reference books in his
office, although he appears to have already accumulated enough
information about music acts--local, foreign, deceased, broken up, on
the cusp--to write a music encyclopedia himself. Throw any band name
at him and he bounces back with a quick comment, a descriptive
phrase, a flicker of recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really easy when there were only a few hundred bands to
remember," Frank laments. "Now I have to remember a few thousand!"</TE>
<TE>   For an anthropologist of cool, there is a lot of slogging through
dry patches, but it's definitely worth it.</TE>
<TE>   "There is only one thing that gets me elated now--discovering a
new band," Frank says. "The record company suits are these guys who
have zero clue--I mean, they are definitely competent people, but
they have lost sight of what good music is," Frank says. They focus
instead only on what promises quick record sales.</TE>
<TE>   When big-label scouts come to a club show, their eyes are fixed on
the audience and its response, not on the band on stage, says Toast,
a woman who made her reputation booking the storied downtown dive
Al's Bar. She now helps local bands secure cross-country engagements
and occasionally books for the Garage in East Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   She says immediate payoff is not her first consideration when she
books a band. "I've had some different club owners accuse me of doing
bad business because I booked bands that didn't draw. But I know when
a band is good enough that they will draw.... Most bands do when
people give them a chance," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Her favorite example is the Riverside-based BellRays, a band that
has simmered for years in the Southland and seems to have become a
prophet in a land other that its own, recently generating lots of
buzz in England.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at them and realized instantly, this is a professional
band. You hear that band and you know it's talent, and it's my job to
expose them to more people," says Toast, who says that she is more
"curator" than scheduler of bands. The key to being a successful
booker is to put on a lineup that is "unpredictable but reliable,"
she adds. A music club can flourish and continually expose audiences
to fresh, quality acts only when a loyal community of clubgoers comes
to trust a booker's choices for the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be willing to book bands that you don't necessarily
like, because it's financially necessary to do so," says McGuigan.
You have to be careful that you're not burning people out on the same
shows, on the same bands."</TE>
<TE>   Still, a booker may have ulterior motives to line up a band for
repeat gigs. At Spaceland, Frank introduced monthly residencies for
selected acts, who get to play free shows for four Mondays in a row.
In July, the Monday-night slot went to Silversun Pickups.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's a chance to highlight a band and give them a chance
to develop and hone their set," says Frank. And the musicians can
draw benefits from playing the venue beyond the obvious one--a chance
to get up on stage and reach an audience.</TE>
<TE>   "If the band keeps playing again and again, they're gonna get
better," says Silversun Pickups bassist Nikki Monninger. "Sometimes a
booker can make a difference with a band. If they like your music,
they are likely to give your demos to their friends, and their
friends tend to be people who [have some clout] in the music
industry."</TE>
<TE>   She adds, "People respect a booker's opinion."</TE>

<LD>Rock artists, from Bruce Springsteen to the Vines, dominate this
edition of Calendar's guide to keeping up with what's noteworthy in
pop music on a budget of $50 a month. But a soul legend and a
trailblazing British singer-songwriter also squeeze their way onto

<LD>   July</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Springsteen's "The Rising" (Columbia). The anthem-like,
post-9/11-themed "Into the Fire" and title track are getting most of
the attention, but it's the intimate moments, including "Empty Sky"
and "You're Missing," that are the most eloquent and moving on
Springsteen's first studio album with the E Street Band since "Born
in the U.S.A." Not everything works in the 73-minute package, but the
highlights reflect the soulfulness and commentary that have made
Springsteen such a vital figure for so long.</LD>
<TE>   Solomon Burke's "Don't Give Up on Me" (Fat Possum). This soul
great has always had the voice, but it's been a long, long time since
he had material this stirring, arrangements this tailored and a
record company this devoted to promoting him. Burke's pleading vocal
on the title track (co-written by Dan Penn, who also helped craft
such R&amp;B standards as "Do Right Woman--Do Right Man") is enough to
win a Grammy nomination, but there's a lot more to enjoy here,
including songs by Van Morrison, Tom Waits and Bob Dylan.</TE>
<TE>   Beth Orton's "Daybreaker" (Heavenly/Astralwerks). Orton, whose
music combines elements of the singer-songwriter and electronica
traditions, has been slow to follow up on the promise of her 1997
debut album, "Trailer Park." But she is right on target in this
confident, alluring work, whose complexity and depth require you to
spend time to fully appreciate its charms.</TE>
<TE>   August</TE>
<TE>   The Vines' "Highly Evolved" (Capitol). Craig Nicholls sounds like
a tortured Kurt Cobain here and a pastoral John Lennon there, which
makes you wonder whether he's the real deal or just a quick study who
knows classic rock values are in vogue. Six numbers into the Aussie
rock quartet's passionate performance at the Roxy, I cast my vote.
His rock vision is still fuzzy, but he brings an intensity and
commitment to his best music--whether it's the desperate, punk-driven
"Get Free" or the more melancholy and searching "Homesick"--that
feels drawn from deep inside.</TE>
<TE>   Bright Eyes' "Lifted" (Saddle Creek). Conor Oberst, who has
already given us one of the year's rock delights with the
Desaparecidos' "Read Music/Speak Spanish" album, returns with a
73-minute assault filled with so many dazzling images and rhymes that
you wonder whether his real name isn't Zimmerman. After all, he's
from the Midwest and he tends to spit out his words the way a young
Dylan did. There are times when this cocky young songwriter seems
guilty of just showing off, but there's an independent spirit here
that makes him exciting, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Division of Laura Lee's "Black City" (Burning Heart) If you're in
love with the Hives and are looking for something else from Swedish
rock, D.O.L.L. is a good choice. Where the Hives listened a lot to
Mitch Ryder &amp; the Detroit Wheels before putting together their garage
rock and punk, D.O.L.L. stocked up on Jesus and Mary Chain CDs,
meaning the sound is darker and more obsessive.</TE>

<HD>Genius Gets Some Help</HD>
<DH>Frank Lloyd Wright overreached with Fallingwater, but new
technology has provided much-needed support</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BLAIR KAMIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MILL RUN, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Frank Lloyd Wright's greatest house strikes a bracing balance between
opposites. It seems to be soaring through the air even though it's
firmly anchored to the ground. It evokes our instinctive need to seek
shelter in caves, yet it recalls our equally strong desire to peer
off the edges of cliffs. It appears to be in complete harmony with
nature, yet it also appears distinctly man-made.</LD>
<LD>   But the most precarious of all the balances associated with the
structure known as Fallingwater has more to do with physics than with
aesthetics: Six years ago, it became clear that if nothing was done
to shore up the house's heroic projecting terraces, they eventually
would collapse into the tumbling stream below.</LD>
<LD>   To anyone familiar with the house, now 64 years old, the news came
like a thunderclap, the equivalent of learning that Beethoven had
gotten the harmonies wrong in his Fifth Symphony or that Picasso's
hand had faltered as he painted "Guernica."</LD>
<TE>   Geniuses aren't supposed to make mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet geniuses probably are more prone than the rest of us to push
things to--or beyond--their limits. Now with an $11.5-million,
five-year renovation nearly concluded, that seems to be precisely
what has happened at Fallingwater. It has taken the latest structural
technology to rescue Wright's masterpiece from the architect's
stupendous overreaching.</TE>
<TE>   Masterminded by New York City engineer Robert Silman, the
structural fix has corrected the problems that threatened to destroy
Fallingwater and renewed the house that the American Institute of
Architects in 1991 voted the best work ever designed by an American
architect. The project is scheduled to be completed in October.</TE>
<TE>   "The house won't have looked this good since it opened," promises
Lynda Waggoner, Fallingwater's director and vice president of the
Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, the nonprofit group that has owned
and operated the house since 1963.</TE>
<TE>   It is an extraordinary time to visit Fallingwater, 70 miles
southeast of Pittsburgh and three miles south of the nearest town,
Mill Run. In early August, the woods around the house were lush, and
Bear Run, the stream it stretches over, was moving smartly. Enough of
the house was back in place that it looked like Fallingwater. Yet
there were spots where the underlying structure remained exposed,
like a life-size cutaway diagram.</TE>
<TE>   Plainly visible on the house's east terrace, for example, was a
concrete beam almost big enough to carry a bridge over an expressway.
Except, of course, Fallingwater isn't a bridge. It's based on the
structural principle of the cantilever, in which a horizontal beam
extends beyond a vertical support. Think of a diving board on
steroids.</TE>
<TE>   At Fallingwater, the cantilevered portion of the main floor, which
rises directly above the waterfalls that give the house its name,
weighs 75 tons, according to John Matteo, Silman's project manager.
The master bedroom terrace weighs nearly 50 tons. Ironically, all of
this heavy lifting creates the impression of incredible lightness.</TE>
<TE>   It is no accident that a visitor feels compelled to applaud this
structural drama. Long before the current crop of "spectacle"
buildings--such as Santiago Calatrava's Milwaukee Art Museum
addition, which flaunts a moving sunshade that is wider than the
wings of a 747--Fallingwater had the market cornered on
gravity-defying, jaw-dropping architecture.</TE>
<TE>   Although the structural undergirding of the terraces is one of the
house's big surprises, the other shock, paradoxically, is that
Fallingwater turns out to be far more intimate than it looks in the
pictures of the mid-20th century photographers who were all too eager
to emphasize its monumental form.</TE>
<TE>   Anybody who walks through the big but cave-like living room, the
tiny kitchen or the ample but hardly sprawling bedrooms will come
away with a distinctly different impression: Fallingwater is a
house--a grand house, to be sure--but not a palace. It's 5,330 square
feet, and nearly half of that, 2,445 square feet, is the floor space
of the terraces.</TE>
<TE>   The house is filled with artful contrasts, like the one between
the smooth, sleek terraces and the highly textured walls of
Pottsville sandstone, which was quarried just downstream. And while
Fallingwater thrusts horizontally through space, Wright also reveled
in the vertical dimension with elements such a stairwell that leads
from the living room to a landing just upstream of the waterfalls.
The stairs poetically underscore the house's grand theme of uniting
man and nature.</TE>
<TE>   Wright designed Fallingwater for the family of Pittsburgh
department store owner Edgar J. Kaufmann Sr., whose son, Edgar Jr.,
was one of the apprentices in the architect's Taliesin Fellowship,
the school Wright invented to give him a source of income that would
him see him through the Depression.</TE>
<TE>   "The Kaufmanns fell at once under Wright's spell," Brendan Gill
wrote in "Many Masks," his 1987 Wright biography, "and to do so was,
of course, inevitably, to spend money." According to Waggoner, the
Kaufmanns' budget for Fallingwater was $45,000. The actual cost of
the house, she adds, was $155,000, excluding Wright's fee of $8,000.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the Kaufmanns had camped at the site, swimming in
shallow pools beneath the waterfalls, sunning themselves on a large,
smooth boulder that overhung the falls and enjoying views from a spot
on the opposite bank. So they were taken aback when Wright showed
them a design that put the house over the falls, following the
example of a cantilevering rock there.</TE>
<TE>   When the elder Kaufmann asked why the family wouldn't be able to
see the waterfall from the house, Wright replied, "E.J., I want you
to live with the waterfall, not to look at it."</TE>
<TE>   It is indeed odd to be at Fallingwater, which Wright (not the
owners) named, and to be forced to bend over the terrace walls to see
the waterfall below. But you can easily look downstream and see water
spilling over another set of rocks. And wherever you are in the
house, you can hear the water.</TE>
<TE>   When the last tour ends at dusk, as Harvard architectural
historian Neil Levine has written, "the natural reaction is to assume
that as the lights are turned off in the house the falls will be shut
off with them." When that doesn't happen, Levine adds, "one begins to
grasp the complex and irreducible reality of Fallingwater."</TE>
<TE>   But Fallingwater's structural woes have been all too reducible:
Even before the house was finished in 1938, its terraces sagged and
cracked. By the mid-1990s, the main-floor terrace was sagging by as
much as seven inches. Although other Wright buildings, including
Unity Temple in Oak Park, Ill., have suffered structural woes
deriving from the architect's preference for the cantilever, those
problems paled next to Fallingwater's, which represented Wright's
most dramatic--and risky--use of the device.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Kaufmann apparently never felt certain that the building
was structurally sound. Wright may not have either, although he
defended his design when engineers consulted by Kaufmann called it
dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fascinating that Wright didn't promote the building,
especially at a time in his career when he wanted to be out there,"
Waggoner says, alluding to the architect's low status in the 1930s,
when many wrongly perceived him as a has-been.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Wright overreached in an effort to one-up his rivals from
Europe, Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the champions of
International Style modernism who threatened to relegate him to the
ash heap of architectural history. Yet if Fallingwater proved that
Wright could beat his rivals at their own game, his sleek terraces
exploding into space in a way that was unprecedented, even Wright
could not defeat the force of gravity.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, a University of Virginia graduate student in
engineering, John Paul Huguley, ran computer models that raised the
possibility that Fallingwater's main-floor terrace might be in
trouble. That led Waggoner to consult engineer Silman, whose credits
include fixing the structural problems associated with the "wigwam"
roof at Wright's Wingspread house in Racine, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   Using radar to perform the equivalent of a noninvasive diagnosis,
Silman's team concluded that although the main-floor and master
bedroom cantilevers appear to support themselves independently,
they're actually interdependent, with the main-floor cantilever
supporting both. The key clue: T-shaped window supports, known as
mullions, were embedded in the walls of the main-floor terrace to
support the master bedroom terrace.</TE>
<TE>   "The living room terrace works on its own," says project manager
Matteo. "When you add the substantial load of the master terrace
above, it doesn't." Simply put, there wasn't enough reinforcing steel
in the concrete beams to support the main-floor cantilever.</TE>
<TE>   After Silman reached that conclusion in 1996, the main-floor
terraces were shored up the next year with temporary steel supports
and Fallingwater was, in effect, ordered to the gym for a strict
regimen of weight-lifting.</TE>
<TE>   Construction workers removed sandstone floors and built-in
furniture showing the effects of more than six decades of humidity
from the adjoining stream. (The furniture was later cleaned and
conserved.) The workers stripped both the terraces and two-thirds of
the house's living room down to their faltering, steel-reinforced
concrete beams. Then they placed new steel cables alongside the beams
and tightened the cables with hydraulic jacks, giving the faltering
old bones the extra muscle they needed to lift the house over the
waterfalls. The technique, known as "post-tensioning," has been
widely used since World War II but rarely in historic preservation.</TE>
<TE>   The effort, which stopped the sagging rather than reverse it, was
completed in March, and nobody worries about the terraces falling
into the stream these days. Thetemporary steel shoring will be
removed in the fall after the stairs that lead from the living room
to the stream has been repaired.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, visitors to Fallingwater still hear both the whir of
construction workers' drills and "the music of the stream," as Wright
called it. Workers are reassembling sandstone floors like pieces of a
jigsaw puzzle and installing new waterproofing membranes to plug the
leaks that so often plague Wright's flat-roofed houses. "I won't
guarantee the roof," Waggoner quips.</TE>
<TE>   Does the renovation diminish Wright's accomplishment? Perhaps. His
design surely exceeded the limits of the technology available to him.</TE>
<TE>   But if he did go too far, think, too, of where he's brought us.
And think of the world without Fallingwater. It's like imagining life
without Beethoven's Fifth or Picasso's "Guernica": which is, of
course, unimaginable. Instead of cutting Wright down to size, a visit
to Fallingwater merely confirms that he was, and remains, America's
greatest architect. More important, we can see his masterpiece as a
living, heavy-lifting work of architecture, not simply as a precious
icon floating above a stream.</TE>

<HD>Taking Her Cues as a Director</HD>
<DH>Melanie Mayron relies on her acting experience to bring
insight to her directing skills in a new teen satire</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Melanie Mayron finds that no matter how hard she tries, she keeps
getting typecast both as an actress and a director.</LD>
<LD>   "I have played the best friend to some of the biggest and best
movie stars," Mayron says, laughing. "In the leads I have done, I was
the best friend--the movie was about the best friend."</LD>
<LD>   And as a female director working in a still predominantly male
profession, she tends to get the "softer" projects. So she's become
even more proactive as a director. "I just cut together an action
reel for myself," says Mayron, who won an Emmy 13 years ago for
playing the neurotic Melissa Steadman on the ABC yuppie angst series
"thirtysomething."</LD>
<TE>   "I had done three 'Nash Bridges' and four 'New York Undercover'
and there were a whole lot of action sequences and stunts and
shootouts and people falling down stairs. And nobody knows I had done
any of that. So when somebody says, 'She couldn't do that,' I'll say,
"Take a look at this tape."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Mayron has done well for herself behind the camera since
making her directorial debut 12 years ago on an episode of
"thirtysomething."</TE>
<TE>   Mayron, 49, has directed numerous episodes of TV series, such as
"Providence," "State of Grace," "Ed" and "Dawson's Creek," and
several TV movies--she received a Directors Guild of America
nomination in 1997 for "The Wonderful World of Disney" family comedy
"Toothless." She made her feature debut six years ago with the family
film "The Baby-Sitters Club."</TE>
<TE>   Now she's back on the big screen with "Slap Her, She's French."
The teen satire--sort of an "All About Eve" set in a Texas high
school--that opens Sept. 20.</TE>
<TE>   Set in the fictional nouveau-riche town of Splendona, "Slap Her"
stars Jane McGregor as Starla Grady, the most popular girl in high
school. She's a beauty pageant winner and the head cheerleader, and
is dating the school's quarterback (Matt Czuchry). Her main goal in
life is to host a national morning TV talk show. But her world is
turned upside-down when her family decides to have a French foreign
exchange student, Genevieve LePlouff (Piper Pearbo), live at their
mansion.</TE>
<TE>   Timid, shy--someone Helen Gurley Brown would refer to as a
mouseburger--Genevieve arrives in Splendona complete with beret and a
French accent as thick as her glasses. Although Genevieve professes
an undying love and devotion to her new family, Starla soon realizes
to her horror that Genevieve is intent on becoming the top girl on
campus.</TE>
<TE>   The script for "Slap Her," Mayron says, says had originally been
at DreamWorks and then Fox Searchlight before landing at Constantin
Films, which produced it. Mayron admits that the subject was "really
broad on paper." The actors, she added, had a "tendency to go big. I
really was trying to make it as real as possible. It was a fine
line."</TE>
<TE>   McGregor, who makes her film debut in 'Slap Her," says Mayron was
very helpful in helping her find the right tone for Starla. "Because
she was an actor, she was understanding," says the 19-year-old
actress. "She would listen to me babble and go off when I was
struggling. It was helpful."</TE>
<TE>   During a recent interview at an office near the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art, Mayron says she loves to make people laugh--but she
also believes that audiences should learn something while they are
laughing. The message of this film, she says, is about self-image and
being comfortable in your own skin.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandmother--she passed away a few years ago--was a Russian
Jew. She moved in her late 20s to Philadelphia from Kiev. She was so
concerned growing up about what people thought of her--you had to be
a certain way and live a certain way even if it wasn't in your heart.
That's kind of Starla's thing. She is with this guy because that's
who she is supposed to be with. She has got these friends because
they are the pretty girls."</TE>
<TE>   With just 43 shooting days, Mayron had no time to rehearse her
cast. Plus, she says, the production encountered weather problems
shooting last winter in and around Plano, Texas, a suburb of Dallas.
As Mayron describes it: "There was rain, ice and snow. It was all
just trying to keep up with everything."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Mayron was at her wits' end during three all-night
football game shoots.</TE>
<TE>   "We ended up shooting it in mid-January. It was between 25 and 30
degrees, if not between 20 and 25 degrees," she recalls. "They told
us we would have 3,000 extras and I had a big crane and we were going
to shoot some magnificent camera stuff. But we only had 300, and by 5
in the morning there were 30 people."</TE>
<TE>   She had to keep shuffling the dwindling crowd around the stands to
make it look like they had 3,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a fiasco," Mayron says with a sigh. "I put my head in my
hand at like 4:30 in the morning on the second night of shooting and
said, "What am I doing here?' "</TE>
<TE>   Not only did Mayron audition numerous young actors, she also had
to do cow casting for several scenes that show the more rural side of
Splendona. "Milky Way was our hero cow," she says, laughing. "We
would move her to different locales. They bought me pictures of cows
off the Internet. I used three of them: Milky Way and two supporting
cows."</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia-born actress has long had an interest in
photography--as it happened, Melissa Steadman in "thirtysomething"
was a photographer as well--and she believes that led to her interest
in directing.</TE>
<TE>   "When we were shooting the movie 'Girlfriends' that Claudia Weill
directed, we were shooting at a real place--a railroad flat apartment
on the Upper West Side of New York City." Mayron was the star of the
1978 comedy-drama about a young woman who must adjust her life when
her roommate-girlfriend leaves to get married.</TE>
<TE>   She wanted to do a scene where the roommate was outside the
bathroom door talking to me in the bathroom, and I would be sitting
on the toilet. But it was so narrow in the hallway they couldn't get
all of us in the shot. I was sitting on top of the toilet rehearsing
and saw that the medicine chest and sink were in front of me. I took
the mirror on the medicine chest and moved it. I said, 'Can you see
me?' They said yes, because my reflection was in the mirror. I heard
Claudia say, 'That's the shot.' She said, 'You have a good eye.' I
was 22 or 23 at the time."</TE>
<TE>   Not only does Mayron have a keen visual sense, but being an
actress has naturally made her sympathetic to her cast's needs and
open to their suggestions. "I have worked with wonderful directors
like Herbert Ross, Paul Mazursky, Daniel Mann and Costa-Gavras," she
says. "These directors direct like other actors who are directors
direct. They respect the actor. Actors are smart and they usually
have great instincts and great ideas about their characters."</TE>
<TE>   McGregor found that Mayron was particularly supportive and
sensitive. "Being a woman, there is a lot of scary stuff out there,
and being a young female actor there is a lot of exploitation," she
says. "So having a woman director who is also an actor and knows how
vulnerable you feel.... Actors are so insecure and often directors
not being an actor don't know that. Melanie has been there and she
knows how to deal with that."</TE>
<TE>   Mayron hasn't given up her acting career--she recently appeared in
a cameo in the kids' film "Clockstoppers." But her acting slowed down
after "thirtysomething" was canceled 11 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "When we were canceled, all of us had trouble getting acting
jobs," she explains. "It was a weird period because we were so known
as our characters." Much to her surprise, though, offers to direct
episodic TV began to pour in.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to my agent, 'How am I getting so much work?' He said,
'Because you're good.' I said you mean being good can get you the
job? That never happened to me before. If you are an actor and if
you're good, that doesn't mean you get the job."</TE>

<DH>Michael Mizerany's new work has everything from gay issues
to time travel. He admits he wants to make people 'a little
uncomfortable.'</DH>

<LD>A press release cautions that "Edgewalkers" contains nudity and
pervasive sexual themes. Indeed, as Ella Fitzgerald sings "Ants
invaded my pants," from the witty Rodgers and Hart classic
"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered," the work's lead dancer and
choreographer, Michael Mizerany, will doff that particular article of
clothing. He will also be completely naked.</LD>
<LD>   And in bed with another man.</LD>
<LD>   The provocative piece is Mizerany's first evening-length work, and
the first the choreographer has made for such a large number of
dancers--nine including himself. Mizerany Dance premieres it this
weekend at Los Angeles Theatre Center. Funded by a $9,000 grant from
the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department, the work combines
classical modern dance, a bit of cabaret theatrics and a dose of
good, old-fashioned melodrama: There's a smoking gun, some Walt
Whitman, and a transsexual chanteuse.</LD>
<TE>   With a nonlinear story line, "Edgewalkers" tackles various aspects
of being gay--political, sociological, personal--from the viewpoint
of a man who travels back and forth in time between the 19th and 21st
centuries, only to learn that life is basically the same in both
eras.</TE>
<TE>   It's a bit surreal--a "portal" allows the dancers to move fluidly
between the centuries--but Mizerany, an artist who could be called an
envelope-pusher, also approaches his work with a certain degree of
pragmatism.</TE>
<TE>   "I could never go into schools with this work," he acknowledges,
saying that he hates shows that use nudity just for the sake of
nudity. "But I have to do what I care about," adds Mizerany, whose
character is the only one in the work called upon to take off all of
his clothes. "I want to go to a point where it makes people a little
uncomfortable, but where it doesn't intrude on the narrative."</TE>
<TE>   The narrative in this case concerns a man (Jeff Bulkley) who is
engaged to a woman (Stephanie Scott) but finds he prefers men,
ultimately following his libido into back alleys and bedrooms. There
is also a witch (Laila Abdullah), albeit a good one, who helps guide
him through a life dictated by oppression.</TE>
<TE>   The two-act work uses music from Bach and Bartok to Big Bad Voodoo
Daddy, Fitzgerald and excerpts from the hard-edged 2000 film "Requiem
for a Dream." Mizerany's partner of eight years, Marco De Leon,
designed the sets, including the 10-by-6-foot muslin-draped,
backlighted portal. Diana MacNeil created the costumes, which are
most elaborate for the women: high-collared, tight bodices and
floor-length skirts representing the past, and sequined cocktail
dresses with feather boas for the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   "This production is a big deal both personally and
professionally," says Mizerany, "because my work before was mainly
solos, duets and trios. Career-wise, I hope it will lead me to
getting presented by some of the bigger venues."</TE>
<TE>   It's the seventh week of rehearsals for "Edgewalkers," and the
dancers are in the L.A. center's Theater 3, a 324-seat auditorium
that Mizerany has rented for the production and hopes to fill for the
eight performances. (The work is scheduled to repeat at Electric
Lodge in Venice in December for a weekend.)</TE>
<TE>   Mizerany, who has been nominated five times for the Lester Horton
Dance Award for Individual Performance, winning twice, in 1995 and
1996, has just run through a sizzling pas de deux with Bulkley, in
which the choreographer leaps into Bulkley's arms and passionately
kisses him while a quartet of women sway their hips and execute foxy
hand motions.</TE>
<TE>   During a rehearsal break, Mizerany, unpretentious in baggy sweats
and a T-shirt, discusses his work. "In the 19th century, being gay
wasn't a lifestyle, it was a behavior. Today, though you can live
life 'out,' there is still oppression; the government does more
things to push us down. Marriage rights don't exist and hate crime
laws are hard to pass. Not that it's not better," he adds, "it is.
But people in power today still think like they did in the 19th
century. After Sept. 11, Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson blamed gays
and abortionists for the attacks, though they did retract the
statements."</TE>
<TE>   Mizerany says that in taking on such serious issues, he also feels
the need to infuse the work with comedy, otherwise "it becomes too
preachy, too heavy-handed. That's why Lisa [Gillespie] lip-syncs
songs as a transsexual cabaret singer, and I've made a conga line
dance with jazz club-type music. It may be heavy on sexuality, but
it's kitschy too. And everyone was really game."</TE>
<TE>   Mizerany had worked with Bulkley and Gillespie before, but he
auditioned the other dancers. He says he storyboarded the 13 scenes,
created the movements he wanted in the studio, then put them on his
dancers. "You have to be able to show what you want physically, but
it doesn't look the same, so I alter moves. They're not me. I
experiment a bit on their bodies."</TE>
<TE>   And the body is still the tool through which Mizerany best
communicates. He came to Los Angeles in 1989 from his hometown of St.
Louis to dance with Loretta Livingston and Dancers. He stayed with
them until 1996, when he joined Bella Lewitzky Dance Company for its
final season of touring. He began choreographing in 1994, and snagged
the two Hortons in 1995 and 1996 for his solos "Tin Soldier" and
"Bump in the Road," respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Mizerany, 39, who still dances with Livingston as well
as with Los Angeles-based Francisco Martinez Dancetheatre and San
Diego-based John Malashock, has made nearly a dozen dances. In 2000,
he was awarded a C.O.L.A. fellowship (from the city of Los Angeles)
for "Necessary Depravity," a satire about homosexual conversion
therapies, and in 2001 he founded Mizerany Dance, he says, to do more
work about lesbian and gay issues. A nonprofit, he says, gives him
better access to grant money earmarked for creating work.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Mizerany premiered "Bible Wall," in which he
also danced nude at one point. It ran for three weeks at North
Hollywood's Whitmore-Lindley Theater Center. Smaller and more
personal than "Edgewalkers," the coming-out piece was supported by a
$2,650 Cultural Affairs grant. Chris Pasles, in the Los Angeles
Times, praised him as "a finely honed dancer ... [who] knows how to
occupy and cut an expressive figure in space. The surprise is how
good a writer he is in balancing seriousness and comedy, the general
and the particular."</TE>
<TE>   For all of its playfulness, seriousness abounds in "Edgewalkers."
When the rehearsal continues, Mizerany oversees a rigorous duet
between Bulkley and Scott. As the yearnings of Bach's Mass in B minor
permeate the theater (all of the Scott-Bulkley duets are danced to
Bach), the couple executes a series of yoga-like poses, after which
Scott soars into Bulkley's arms.</TE>
<TE>   Bulkley, who knew Mizerany in St. Louis and moved to Los Angeles a
year and a half ago to dance with him, sees his part as an acting
challenge, not least because he's straight. "It's more kissing than
I've done, but since I've acted--I was in the [gay-themed] play
"Jeffrey"--when I'm on stage, it's part of a whole performance."</TE>
<TE>   Scott, a recent transplant to Los Angeles from Texas, studied
dance at CalArts and dances with another local ensemble, Frit and
Frat Fuller's Kin Dance Company. "For me, the choreography is
brilliant, because of the way Michael tells stories and adds humor to
everything he does, so it doesn't get so dark," Scott says. "It helps
me as a dancer, because we have a story line, an emotion that we're
supposed to fill."</TE>
<TE>   Mizerany points out that "Edgewalkers" has a universal theme, and
that he hopes everyone will have a personal take on the show. "I'm
conveying a serious message but with a little sugar," he adds. "I
always feel like I'll be striving--there will be some good work and
some bad work. But I want people to know I'm trying."</TE>

<HD>Piecing It Together</HD>
<DH>An unusual Getty project focused not on an 18th century
French portrait, but on the far more dazzling wood around it</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget paintings. The frame of frames is ready for its close-up.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, take the tram to the top of the hill at the Getty
Center, walk up the broad staircase to the museum and continue
through the plaza to the South Pavilion. Then go to the second floor
and proceed to the French galleries. There you will find a newly
installed wonder of French craftsmanship, both old and new--a frame
that outshines the painting it holds in value, importance and
candlepower.</LD>
<LD>   It surrounds an 18th century portrait of a grandee in full
regalia, and the frame is part of the pomp and circumstance.
Measuring 88 inches high and 66 inches wide, the elaborately carved
and gilded creation is topped off with an extraordinary sculptural
flourish: a coat of arms that includes a near-life-size eagle, an
ermine cloak, a lacy crown, a wide-brimmed hat and a trio of swords.
Each detail is carved to perfection and gilded to a mellow glow with
dazzling highlights.</LD>
<TE>   But it wasn't always so. The portrait arrived at the museum 14
years ago, a pretty picture of Louis-Charles d'Orleans de
Saint-Albin, in a badly butchered frame.</TE>
<TE>   Painted in 1723 by Hyacinthe Rigaud, the leading court painter of
the time, the portrait was probably commissioned to celebrate
Louis-Charles' appointment as archbishop of Cambrai. He was the
illegitimate son of Philippe, Duc d'Orleans, who never officially
recognized him but helped him rise in the church hierarchy. And here
he is--dressed to the nines in the satin, lace and fur robes of his
office.</TE>
<TE>   The frame was expressly made for the painting, and it has equally
important credentials. The work of Gilles-Marie Oppenord--chief
architect and designer for the Duc d'Orleans during the Regency
period (1715-23), when he was head of state--it's a prime example of
the golden age of French frame-making, when early 18th century
virtuoso craftsmen created vast, sculptural frames for ceremonial
portraits.</TE>
<TE>   But the Getty didn't know that when it acquired the painting. With
the frame, all it had for sure was what conservators call a
carcass--the skeleton of a once-vibrant work of decorative art.</TE>
<TE>   At some point in the 224 years between the archbishop's death and
the Getty's acquisition, all the ornamentation that extended beyond
the frame's rectangular core was cut off and discarded or lost. The
massive coat of arms was gone. Acanthus-leaf corners, entwined with
serpents, and a seashell on the bottom were also missing. Instead of
20 inches of decoration on the top of the painting and 11 inches on
the sides and bottom, the carcass--albeit beautifully carved--was
merely an 8-inch-wide border.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything that didn't coincide with a rectangle was just lopped
off," says Scott J. Schaefer, the Getty's curator of paintings.</TE>
<TE>   Another frame was found for the portrait and it went on display,
first in Malibu, then at the new museum in Brentwood. But the old
frame was a source of curiosity. Was it a 19th century reproduction
or a real 18th century frame? Even in its greatly diminished
condition, the quality of the carving and gilding suggested to some
frame lovers that it might be the work of a master.</TE>
<TE>   But what, if anything, to do about it? The carcass was in no
condition to go on public view and nothing was known about its
missing parts. Stashed away but not forgotten, it joined the Getty's
collection of old frames, where inferior examples go to die and
superior ones get recycled when the right painting comes along.</TE>
<TE>   It would take 14 years of advocacy and research on the part of
Getty conservators, a key discovery by a French scholar, and finally
the skill of two 21st century artisans with 18th century skills to
put the archbishop's frame back together again--with every last eagle
feather, serpent scale, silk tassel and tuft of fur in place.</TE>
<TE>   In hiring Rigaud and Oppenord, Louis-Charles entrusted his image
to the most fashionable court painter and designer of the day.
Rigaud--whose best-known work, a full-length portrait of Louis XIV,
is at the Louvre--brought a high degree of formality to the tradition
of court portraiture. Oppenord, who rose to prominence when French
interior decoration reached its zenith, played an influential role in
the development of Regency and Rococo styles while remodeling the
vast Palais-Royal in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   "It was about presentation," Schaefer says of the portrait and
frame. "Louis-Charles wanted you to be overwhelmed not only by his
presence, but also by what he could do in spending money."</TE>
<TE>   After the death of Louis-Charles in 1764, the provenance of the
portrait is sketchy. Apparently sold when his estate was dispersed,
it landed in one or more private collections in Europe. The Getty
bought the painting for an undisclosed price from a London dealer in
1988.</TE>
<TE>   As for the butchery of the frame, "we don't know why this was
done," says Gene Karraker, the Getty's frames conservator. One theory
is that the coat of arms at the top of the frame was deemed offensive
and chopped off during the French Revolution. "That makes a good
story," he says, "but the frame could have been cut down to make it
fit a particular space." Another possibility is that "it was damaged
and it was just easier to cut everything clean than to repair it."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the fact that the carcass continued to frame the painting
for more than two centuries indicates that its value was recognized.
"It's gilded wood," Schaefer says. "You have to remember that the
frame probably cost far in excess of what the picture cost."</TE>
<TE>   At the Getty--where specialists know that 18th century French
frames can rank among the finest decorative art objects of the
period--the carcass may have been relegated to storage, but it
continued to come up for discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Rothe, a senior conservator of special projects who has
developed considerable expertise in frames, and Elisabeth Mention,
associate conservator of paintings, were among the early advocates.
When Rothe noticed that faded areas of the canvas matched the inside
contours of the frame, he concluded that it was more than a fine
piece of 18th century craftsmanship; it was the painting's original
frame.</TE>
<TE>   Gillian Wilson, the Getty's curator of decorative arts, and Brian
Considine, conservator of decorative arts and sculpture, eventually
came to the same conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   All of them wanted to solve the mystery, if only to satisfy their
professional curiosity. In 1989, at the suggestion of Wilson and
Considine, Mention wrote to Christian Baulez, chief curator at
Versailles, requesting advice. After seeing a photograph of the
frame, Baulez responded that it was probably made by Oppenord and
recommended that she contact French scholar Bruno Pons, the leading
expert on his work.</TE>
<TE>   She took his advice and went to Paris to meet with Baulez and
Pons, with additional photographs of the frame in hand. Pons did some
research and came up with a stunning piece of evidence: an engraving
in a book of Oppenord designs that laid out part of his plan for the
frame.</TE>
<TE>   "Without that, we wouldn't have known how to proceed," Karraker
says.</TE>
<TE>   But even then, what to do about the frame wasn't clear. It simply
wasn't a high priority during the Getty's big growth spurt in the
early '90s--when the museum was aggressively building its collections
and planning for the new building in Brentwood, which opened in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "We had so many issues on the front burner, given the move into
the Getty Center and getting the galleries ready for that," says Mark
Leonard, who heads the museum's paintings conservation department.
"The frame was one of those things we set aside and knew we would get
to eventually."</TE>
<TE>   Once they did, the task was formidable. The Oppenord engraving was
merely a preliminary plan of sculptural elements, without much
detail, and it didn't show all the missing parts. How could the frame
be accurately re-created? And who could possibly do the job?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just restoration; it's reconstruction," Leonard says.
"That's very different from most of the work we do here. Re-creating
a massive loss is something you want to approach thoughtfully."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the problem was twofold: "Finding a carver and gilder
skilled enough to do the work, and finding the funding for it,"
Karraker says.</TE>
<TE>   He talked with frame dealers in London, without success: "They do
incredible restoration work, but it was just too much for them."</TE>
<TE>   Then Considine had a bright idea: Bruno Desnoues and Youri
Dmitrenko. Desnoues, a carver, and Dmitrenko, a gilder, have separate
studios in Paris but frequently work on joint projects. The one that
caught Considine's attention was an 18th century French canopied bed
at the Getty. The top of the canopy was missing when the museum
acquired it in 1994, but Desnoues carved a replacement and Dmitrenko
did the gilding.</TE>
<TE>   "The amazing thing is, we didn't find a photograph of the complete
bed until the work was done," Karraker says. "Then we saw that Bruno
had re-created it exactly, without ever seeing it."</TE>
<TE>   The Getty paid for the frame project with funds set aside for
outside services. As for the cost of the reconstruction and
restoration, Getty spokesmen will say only that it's just a fraction
of the frame's value.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was $50,000, it was money well spent," says Larry Shar,
president of Julius Lowy Frame &amp; Restoring Co. Inc., a major frame
dealer in New York. "If it was $100,000, I would like to have had the
job."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it took to revive the Oppenord, it is now the most
valuable frame in the museum's collection, conservators say. That
puts it in the vague but lofty range of hundreds of thousands of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   In Paris, 18th century frames are plentiful and the restoration of
decorative arts is a thriving--if highly specialized--business. But
even in the ateliers of the best craftsmen, re-creating the authentic
spirit and flamboyantly decorative life of a huge Oppenord carcass is
a rare and daunting challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "It was, I think, the most difficult work I ever did," Dmitrenko
says.</TE>
<TE>   The project began in 1996, when the frame was sent to France. Its
first stop was Desnoues' studio, a sparsely furnished unit in a
picturesque courtyard in the 12th Arrondissement, on the east side of
Paris. Metal gates on a major thoroughfare lead to a shady lane,
where grapes are still grown and turned into wine. The studios on
both sides of the path might appear to belong to another era as well,
except for their modern furnishings and computers.</TE>
<TE>   Slim, animated and intensely involved in his work, Desnoues has
the demeanor of a professional who gets to the point and works
quickly. Why, then, did it take him four years to do his part of the
Getty project?</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, he didn't have a deadline. For another, he had
other jobs to do and couldn't devote all of his time to the frame.
But the primary reason is the unusual nature of the project and
Desnoues' personality.</TE>
<TE>   "To say that Bruno is an eccentric is somewhat of an
understatement," Karraker says. "The frame sat in his studio for a
year with very little work being done to it. He said he needed to
look at it every day so that when he started to work, he wouldn't
have to think about it. He felt that if he looked at it and studied
it long enough, he would become Oppenord's carver and just proceed in
the style of the original designer."</TE>
<TE>   Crazy as that may sound, it makes sense to other restorers. The
goal is look at an object over an extended period of time, so that
"your understanding of it becomes second nature," the Getty's Leonard
says. "Therefore, there is less of a danger of imposing yourself on
the object. You know the object so well that it guides you."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time that Desnoues was living, breathing and, he says,
"dreaming the frame," he was doing a lot of research. He had worked
with other Oppenord material and knew his style, but the Getty frame
was a puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   Pulling large binders off a shelf and laying them out on a table
in his studio, Desnoues talks of digging through libraries and
archives for clues that would help him reconstruct the frame
accurately. He also recalls scouring the Louvre's decorative arts
storage areas and going to Versailles, where he found documentation
of individual elements on the frame. In one small but essential
breakthrough, he and Dmitrenko discovered that a mysterious,
ribbon-like form on the carcass was the tongue of a serpent that
weaves through foliage around a corner.</TE>
<TE>   Desnoues started the construction process by making a plaster cast
of what remained of the old frame. Then he made drawings and paper
cutouts of proposed additions and attached them to the plaster, to
see how the proportions worked. When he had a model that seemed
right, he carved it in Plasticine, an oil-base modeling paste. The
final, working model was a plaster cast of the Plasticine frame with
its new additions.</TE>
<TE>   That was all preliminary to actually re-creating the missing parts
of the frame. First, Desnoues glued together blocks of European lime
wood, which is similar to poplar, in a rough approximation of the
original contours. He also cut small blocks so that he could replace
little tips of fur and other bits that had been knocked off the
carcass. Then he carved the pieces and attached them to the carcass,
before sending the whole thing to Dmitrenko's atelier. Desnoues came
as close as possible to the original, but there is no way to
calculate the precision of his work.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking at Bruno's finished carving, you think you couldn't get
any more detailed," the Getty's Karraker says, flipping through
photographs of the process. "But that is only half of it. His job is
remarkable, but what Youri had to do was to make this remarkable
object extraordinary. A lot of the detail that we see in the finished
project is only done in the gesso," he says, referring to a white,
chalk-and-glue fluid applied to wood as a ground for gilding.</TE>
<TE>   Dmitrenko, who has painstakingly finished the frame during the
past two years, plies his obscure trade in a modest storefront studio
in the outer reaches of the 20th Arrondissement, a working-class
district in the process of gentrification. On a quiet weekday
morning--two months before the frame was shipped to Los Angeles by
air in a specially designed, heavily padded wooden crate-- the only
action on his street takes place at a nearby Renault garage. No sign
or street number marks Dmitrenko's shop. The only indication that
someone might be working behind the large, smoked-glass windows is a
slip of paper taped to the door bearing a handwritten message in
French: Knock loudly and wait patiently.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the walls are hung with antique frames and furniture
awaiting the ministrations of Dmitrenko, his wife, Anne, and two
assistants. Each of the four sides of the Getty frame sits on a
different table or work station. A well-fed cat snoozes on one table,
beside a gilded section that will soon be patinated.</TE>
<TE>   When the frame arrived at his studio, Dmitrenko cleaned the
original components and sealed the new sections with rabbit skin
glue. Then he covered them with several coats of gesso, which can be
carved in greater detail than wood and provides a better surface for
gilding. With the consistency of heavy cream, the gesso fills
crevices and softens edges. When it dried, Dmitrenko recut the shapes
Desnoues had carved and added the fine points, creating a
sharp-edged, multifaceted surface that is highly reflective when
gilded.</TE>
<TE>   "Regence recutting is probably the most ornate," Karraker says,
referring to the Regency period when the frame was made. "It's one of
the hardest to reproduce. There are very few people in the world who
can do it as well as Youri."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I am the best," Dmitrenko says, while cutting veins
in an acanthus leaf with a curved blade made of agate. "But if the
Getty chose me, there must be a reason."</TE>
<TE>   Among the reasons is that he goes beyond what might be expected,
even in the top echelon of his craft. "On the back of the fur pelt
that drapes over the top of the frame, he recut a brocade pattern
because he found that the back of the leather would have been tooled
during this period," Karraker says. "He had to research what pattern
would have been used and then put it on the back. That's a detail the
public is never going to see, but it's a detail he has to do. Or that
he does do."</TE>
<TE>   When the recutting was complete, the gessoed surfaces were covered
with bole, a finely ground earth composed of clay and iron oxide.
Then gold leaf was applied, one tiny flake at a time, and burnished
to heighten the brilliance. The final challenge was to apply a patina
that would match the original gilding.</TE>
<TE>   When the frame was new, it was bright gold, but tastes have
changed and the painting itself has aged. What's more, silver and
copper mixed with the original gold leaf had oxidized, Dmitrenko
says. Gilders tend to guard the formulas they devise for patinas, and
Dmitrenko is no exception. "I have many jars to choose from," he
says, pointing to a row of potions on a shelf but giving away no
secrets.</TE>
<TE>   If the patina is his final signature on the project, Desnoues' is
a tiny wooden fly that appears to have alighted on the brim of the
hat at the top of the frame. "Bruno does have a sense of humor,"
Karraker says. "He wanted his own mark on the frame, so he included
himself as a fly."</TE>
<TE>   Pictures that remain in their original frames for more than a
century are rare. Of the 447 paintings and pastels in the Getty
Museum's collection--which covers the 13th through the 19th
centuries--only 31 are in the frames initially made for them. And
that includes seven early Italian works in which the frame and the
painting are made from a single block of wood.</TE>
<TE>   "Tastes change. Decorating habits change. People remove frames and
throw them out or use them for other things," paintings curator
Schaefer says.</TE>
<TE>   When the Getty acquires an artwork with a frame that is deemed
unsuitable, the search is on for a "new" old frame. Conservators
first scour their storeroom. If they are lucky, they find something
of the right style and period that can be cut down or built out to
fit. If not, they turn to the international marketplace or reproduce
a period frame.</TE>
<TE>   As for what to choose, "it comes to what presents the painting
best," Karraker says. "Too much ornamentation really detracts from
the painting."</TE>
<TE>   Current taste at the Getty calls for "bringing the quality of the
frame to match the quality of the painting, but never to overshadow
it," Karraker says. "I focus on frames because that's what I deal
with every day, all day. But I also realize that people don't come
here to look at frames. When they take the tram down from the museum,
I want them to remember the paintings, not the frames."</TE>
<TE>   The Oppenord frame is a special case, however. Crowned with an
eagle, entwined with serpents and whimsically signed with a fly, it
isn't likely to be overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   "When I came here, I have to admit that I thought the painting was
not the greatest Rigaud I had seen," says Schaefer, who arrived at
the Getty in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "But when this frame goes around it, it will step up. We are doing
a separate label for the frame, simply as an object. The label for
the frame will be equal to the label for the painting."</TE>

<HD>Now for the Real Badly Drawn Boy</HD>
<DH>His debut was acclaimed, but Damon Gough says it didn't
reflect him the way his new album does.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Damon Gough, a.k.a. Badly Drawn Boy, did pretty well with the critics
on both sides of the Atlantic with his 2000 debut album, "The Hour of
Bewilderbeast." The earthy, homemade-sounding collection won the
U.K.'s prestigious Mercury Music Prize and finished 18th in the
Village Voice poll of U.S. music journalists.</LD>
<LD>   This year, the Englishman's songs-and-score soundtrack for the
movie "About a Boy" also earned him much acclaim.</LD>
<LD>   But the first review of his upcoming album, "Have You Fed the
Fish," was harsh.</LD>
<TE>   "I played it for my girlfriend," Gough says. "And she said, 'I'm
missing you in it.' That put me out."</TE>
<TE>   Gough admits that there's a leap from the shambling feel of the
first album to the more polished approach on this one, which was
recorded in Los Angeles with producer Tom Rothrock (Beck, Elliott
Smith) and had such touches as strings and horns.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough thing," he says. "I'm sure there would be a lot of
people who dug 'Bewilderbeast'--my naivete and freshness, and the
sequences and links I used because I wasn't confident the songs stood
alone," he says. "I was just happy to be recording. I'd never been in
studios before."</TE>
<TE>   But at age 32, with changes in his life including the recent birth
of his and girlfriend Claire Hewitt's second child, he believes that
"Have You Fed the Fish," due Oct. 22, has him all through it.</TE>
<TE>   "In January, writing songs for the record, there was a lot of
spontaneous subject matter," he says. "I tended to come out with
questions about what this job entails for me--the amount of traveling
I do, the time away from home.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Bewilderbeast' was about the search for a relationship or
series of relationships that I encompassed into one for the cycle.
I've got my security and fan base and everything I wanted, but it's
still tough. A lot of that got on the record."</TE>
<TE>   He singles out one line from the new song "How?"</TE>
<TE>   "Talking with people on the street, they expect something of you,
to add something to their lives," he says. "I've got a line, 'How can
I give you the answers you need, when all I possess is a melody?' "</TE>
<TE>   Not that he's complaining or that the songs convey bitterness. The
title track, "Born Again," and "All Possibilities" are as ultimately
optimistic as they are self-examining, and the fuller arrangements
trade the personably rough edges of "Bewilderbeast" for buoyant
exuberance and confidence. A few shorter pieces, including a
whimsical "Intro" skit and the instrumentals "Theme" and "Interlude,"
were added to give a flow along the lines of the debut.</TE>
<TE>   And making the album with Rothrock, who also co-produced the "Boy"
soundtrack music, wasn't that different at the core. The songs were
written or at least sketched out in a two-night burst that produced
two bags full of cassettes and 35 songs-in-progress, 16 of which made
the final cut.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really only me that provided the music, and Tom found ways
to make it sound the way we wanted to," Gough says.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a case of finding arrangements after we'd jammed the songs
down. Tom and me sat in a room and I played different instruments,
fishing for sounds, fishing for favorite phrases. Only me and Tom
were the judge and jury--me as the No. 1 judge. But it was relaxed,
not searching for cool sounds that fit with the culture of the day,
but something of the moment, of me."</TE>
<TE>   It's a moment that he believes will be meaningful as his career
unfolds further, even if fans (not to mention his girlfriend) have
trouble adjusting to it at this point.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing I'm really proud of is tackling the subject matter,
particularly as you get to the middle of the record," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "The songs 'You Were Right' and 'How?' not just musically but
lyrically capture what I want to say as reconciling my two worlds of
normal life and pop life. If we look back in 20 years and it's a
record that challenges those things, then it's a success."</TE>
<TE>   ROCKTOBER: It's a good bet David Lee Roth won't be at Sammy
Hagar's annual birthday bash Oct. 4 and 5 at his Cabo Wabo club in
Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. But perhaps the clashes between the two
former Van Halen singers on their recent co-billed tour inspired one
part of Hagar's event. Starting Thursday, his Cabo Wabo tequila
company and the Hard Rock Cafe chain are putting on a national battle
of the bands, with the champion being flown to Cabo to serve as
Hagar's opening act both nights.</TE>
<TE>   Bands who have never had a recording contract can compete first in
weekly regional contests, with the 12 winners heading to a national.
That roster will be trimmed by public voting in an Internet poll, but
the finals will be judged "American Idol"-style by a panel of music
industry figures and celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   Not coincidentally, Hagar has a new album, "Not 4 Sale," which
despite its title will be go on sale Oct. 1 on the independent 33rd
St. Records.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Mark Everett, better known as E of the Eels, has been
hired for his first film-scoring job, composing music for "Levity,"
starring Billy Bob Thornton as a man freed from prison after serving
19 years for a crime he didn't commit. Morgan Freeman, Holly Hunter
and Kirsten Dunst also will star in the drama, which is planned for
release next year.... "Our Little Corner of the World: Music From the
Gilmore Girls," a soundtrack album for the WB network's show, is due
from Rhino Records on Sept. 24. Featured is a new song, "Smile," by
L.A. singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips, who has been seen in a
recurring role as a roving troubadour on the series. There's also a
new Sam Phillips song, "Tell Her What She Wants to Know," and a new
full-length recording of the theme song, "Where You Lead," by Carole
King and her daughter, Louise Goffin.... Singer-songwriter Dar
Williams tapped several stars of the jam-band scene to help out on
her next album, "Beauty of the Rain," due from Razor &amp; Tie Records in
February. Violinists Stefan Lessard (Dave Matthews Band) and Mike
Kang (String Cheese Incident), harmonica player John Popper (Blues
Traveler) and organist John Medeski (Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood) are on
board, along with fusion banjo picker Bela Fleck and bluegrass
fiddler Alison Krauss.... Krauss and her Union Station band have
recorded their first live album, a two-CD set due from Rounder
Records in early November, with a simultaneous release of a DVD
featuring bonus material. The recordings were done at April 29 and 30
shows at the Palace Theater in Louisville, Ky.</TE>

<LD>***  1/2 DIXIE CHICKS, "Home", Open Wide/Columbia</LD>
<LD>   The Chicks aim for music that offers a message as well as
entertains, and the female country trio blends those objectives
engagingly in the opening 24 seconds of its third album (due in
stores Tuesday).</LD>
<LD>   Before the first line of lyrics in "Long Time Gone," the sparkling
banjo-fiddle exchange catches your ear and serves as a statement: The
Chicks are sticking to their traditional country roots rather than
playing the pop crossover game that has taken the heart out of so
much country music.</LD>
<TE>   The song itself, written by Darrell Scott, also carries a message.</TE>
<TE>   It's the story of a young musician with dreams of becoming part of
country music's soulful legacy. But he discovers that the legacy is
largely history in Nashville, and he takes a slap at what is left on
the radio:</TE>
<TE>   Now they sound tired, but they don't sound Haggard.</TE>
<TE>   They've got money, but they don't have Cash.</TE>
<TE>   They have Junior, but they don't have Hank.</TE>
<TE>   It's a knockout track and not just a token message. The album also
contains some rousing, bluegrass-spiked numbers, including the
goofball novelty "White Trash Wedding." Banjo, fiddle, dobro and
slide guitar elements are also spread throughout the other
selections.</TE>
<TE>   But "Home" isn't backward-looking. There is a modern sensibility
that runs through the album, chiefly in the way various songs (a
third of them written by the trio) reflect on the complexity of
relationships. In their earlier albums, the Chicks spoke about
breaking loose, finding freedom and self-affirmation.</TE>
<TE>   With each member of the group now married, they selected songs
that frequently focus on matters of home and heart, examining love in
all its forms, and relationships between people and even countries.</TE>
<TE>   The range is a little too scattered for the album to have the
searing impact of Willie Nelson's "Phases and Stages" or Vince Gill's
"The Key," two of country's best looks at romance. But "Long Time
Gone" confirms the Chicks' place in the Haggard, Cash and Williams
tradition.</TE>
<TE>   --Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   *** QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE, "Songs for the Deaf", Interscope</TE>
<TE>   Meteorologically, it's tempting to attribute this musical storm
front to the reaction between the Queens' arid Southern California
desert rock and the soggy Northwest sensibility of new key
collaborators Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters) and Mark Lanegan
(Screaming Trees).</TE>
<TE>   For all their reputation as dangerous, deranged renegades, Queens
mainstays Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri have come up with a second
album of psychedelic-tinged hard rock (due Tuesday) that's
painstakingly modulated and pretty restrained. Its superstructure of
mighty chording is honed, sleek and verging on progressive, an
impression reinforced by a visit from Alain Johannes and Natasha
Schneider from L.A. complex-crunch group Eleven (recent collaborators
with another Seattle stalwart, Chris Cornell).</TE>
<TE>   But it's also bracingly primal, from its moments of punk rant to
its predominantly taut, ominous aura. The Northwest input results in
moments that don't sound too far from old Soundgarden--sad, soulful
and dreamy--and drummer Grohl is a particularly notable energy
source.</TE>
<TE>   --Richard Cromelin</TE>
<TE>   ***  1/2 AIMEE MANN, "Lost in Space", SuperEgo</TE>
<TE>   Sonically, at least, it's more like lost in the spaciousness, as
the lush music on the singer-songwriter's fourth album (in stores
Tuesday) prettily sprawls to infinity while remaining grounded in her
usual themes of emotional codependency, romantic disillusionment and
unshakeable self-doubt.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. resident doesn't address the glaring spotlight that comes
with being a fleeting sensation, although she might have, given the
media attention she got in 2000 after receiving a best song Oscar
nomination for "Save Me," and from joining other
talented-but-trend-free musicians deemed unprofitable by major labels
in selling her "Bachelor No. 2" album largely through the Internet.
Instead, she looks at the addictive power of obsession in the dreamy
"High on Sunday 51" and exposes a nasty character in the muscular
"Guys Like Me."</TE>
<TE>   Still, even the spare moments are larger than life, cinematically
lavished with acoustic guitar, eerie slide work, gurgling keyboards
and soaring strings.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mann has long mined this emotional territory, such
numbers as "Humpty Dumpty" and the quietly despairing "This Is How It
Goes" give the collection a poignant sense of isolation.</TE>
<TE>   The smooth production evokes '70s pop radio but isn't really
nostalgic.</TE>
<TE>   Each part is crisply defined, even as the layers of
instrumentation and Mann's icily passionate vocals meld seamlessly.
"Lost in Space" is certainly Beatles-esque, but it's also very
California: laid-back and almost too lovely to be real.</TE>
<TE>   Yet upon closer examination, it's rather unsettled, and
unsettling.</TE>
<TE>   --Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   **  1/2 EVE, "Eve-Olution", Ruff Ryders/Interscope</TE>
<TE>   With Lil' Kim getting more attention for her breast implants than
her music, and Foxy Brown dealing with a bevy of personal issues as
well as the public's indifference toward her most recent album, Eve
has become hip-hop's go-to girl.</TE>
<TE>   However, on her third collection (in stores Tuesday), the
Philadelphia rapper fails to distance herself from the pack. This
batch of songs doesn't extend the artistic panache exhibited on her
Grammy-winning single with Gwen Stefani, "Let Me Blow Ya Mind." The
single "Gangsta Lovin'," with Alicia Keys, reeks of lazy calculation,
not the power one would expect from two such talented artists.
Likewise, the cat-and-mouse "Figure You Out" and the
end-the-relationship tune "Let This Go" sound derivative.</TE>
<TE>   As much as Eve continues to position herself as a slick pop star,
her strength lies in her gritty side. Best displayed alongside Snoop
Dogg ("Hey Y'all") and label mates the LOX ("Double R What"), Eve's
attitude here makes her a compelling listen, a stark contrast to her
overly radio-friendly sounds.</TE>
<TE>   --Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   ***  1/2 MALI MUSIC, "Mali Music", Astralwerks/Honest Jon's</TE>
<TE>   Toting a beat-up melodica, Blur singer and Gorillaz co-founder
Damon Albarn traveled around Mali in July 2000, sitting in and
recording with just about any musician he encountered, from
internationally known kora player Toumani Diabate to amateur street
players. Home in England, he augmented and reworked the recordings
before sending them back for further additions by Malian musicians.</TE>
<TE>   That journey isn't very evident on the first track, "Spoons,"
which could easily be a sample of French film music. But what soon
unfolds works both as colorful cross-cultural collaboration and audio
travelogue. Albarn never merely puts a beat behind samples of the
field recordings, as much so-called world music does, nor does he
seek to create a Malian-pop fusion. Rather, he goes for complementary
aesthetics and musical dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes he wisely stands back and lets the Malian music be. At
other times, he takes matters into his own hands as the sole musician
("Le Relax," sporting the reggae dub touches he favored with
Gorillaz). The most arresting tracks, though, are the boldest:
"Makelekele" is space-age Euro-dance with the accent on the source
music's cadences, while the quietly evocative collage "Tennessee
Hotel" feels like a happy entry in Albarn's Mali journal.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** Beenie Man, "Tropical Storm," Virgin. Shaggy's 2001 album,
"Hotshot," made adulterated reggae safe for Carson Daly fans, and now
Beenie Man, his closest rival in the dancehall subgenre, is trying to
claim some of Shaggy's valuable turf. Beenie Man, a.k.a. Anthony
Davis, has tasted crossover success before: Like his silly, sing-song
1997 hit "Who Am I," this album is a carefully calibrated bid to
please mainstream music fans without alienating his hard-core
constituency. The jerky beats and synth accents of dancehall are
front and center. Although Beenie Man sneaks in a fair share of R&amp;B
vocal hooks and dumbed-down lyrics, "Tropical Storm" is sturdily
grounded in his native reggae.</TE>
<TE>   --Marc Weingarten</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Kelly Willis, "Easy," Rykodisc.</TE>
<TE>   Having weathered several roots-country, pop-country and
alt-country make-overs, Austin, Texas-based Willis has settled in
comfortably on her fifth album as part folky singer-songwriter, part
honky-tonk angel. A sense of ease in both her gorgeous, unforced
singing and her relationship-oriented themes marks her largely
acoustic, twang-spiked songs. Only on the late Kirsty MacColl's
jaundiced "Don't Come the Cowboy With Me Sunny Jim!" and Marcia
Ball's torchy "Find Another Fool," though, does she stray from
too-familiar blueprints.</TE>
<TE>   --S.H.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 P18, "Electropica," EMI Latin. As an electronica
soundscaper, former Mano Negra member Tom Darnel is one tasteful
alchemist, and on his group's new album, the keyboardist-composer
uses strictly organic ingredients such as rumba chants, Cuban
percussion and even a sax solo by Afrobeat star Femi Kuti. P18's
intriguing take on the Afro-Latin electro wave is always pleasant,
but the collective's second outing loses steam halfway through and
never quite recovers from drum machine overkill.</TE>

<HD>Refashioning a Dance Scene</HD>
<DH>Don't mourn Dance Kaleidoscope's demise. Others have taken
up the uneven showcase's mantle, and the result is more interesting
work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent announcement that the Dance Kaleidoscope showcase series
had folded after 13 years because of the board's inability to recruit
a new artistic director created a negligible stir. It may have been
regrettable, but it essentially changed nothing.</LD>
<LD>   As late as summer 2000, Dance K presented 30 local artists or
companies over three weekends. But last year, the series offered only
a token, one-performance farewell to its departing leader, Don
Hewitt. By that time the dance community had already begun changing
to prepare for the post-Kaleidoscope era.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the landscape is noticeably different than in Dance K's
heyday. If the series represented, in the words of a board member,
"the mirror in which the local dance community sees itself," that
mirror shattered with the last full-scale Kaleidoscope season. Now,
pieces of its mission have been picked up by new leaders. Moreover,
several institutions and performance series have redefined their
identities to accommodate the needs of a wider range of Southland
dance artists.</LD>
<TE>   In this changing dance environment, there is a welcome assertion
of artists' visions and, in some cases, higher standards.</TE>
<TE>   Dance K and its classical spinoff, BalletFest, were shaped by
Hewitt's priorities. He was a distinguished teacher who proved, year
after year, in my view, to be less committed to quality control than
to giving emerging talents their big break. As a result, the series
often sank to a sub-professional workshop level.</TE>
<TE>   The recent 2002 BalletFest, under new direction, showed what we'd
been missing: curatorship focused on excellence in the here and now.
No company danced poorly, and the aim seemed to be not merely
celebrating the existence of ballet in California, but making it
matter.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of prestige, the annual C.O.L.A. Awards (from the city of
Los Angeles) arguably developed into the premier local dance event
during Dance K's twilight, offering Southland choreographers not
merely increased exposure, but also genuine financial support in the
form of grants to create work. There may be only four chosen dance or
performance artists per year on the honors list, but the visibility
of new repertory at the Los Angeles Theatre Center downtown over two
weekends has become a major community event.</TE>
<TE>   Also sponsoring new work is the county's curated summer
performance series at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre. In the past,
companies might have moved from a multi-company Kaleidoscope night at
the Ford to a full evening of their own there. Now, the Ford series
has been expanded, giving an impetus to ensembles to seek the brass
ring: the dance mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   Still, without Dance K, a big gap exists between such alternative
performance spaces as Highways Performance Space (no less important
than before as a haven for experimental work) and bigger stages such
as the Ford and Grand Performances' Watercourt. Helping companies
bridge that gap, Howard Ibach's L.A. Dance Invitational, an annual
charity benefit, most recently at the Doolittle, has morphed from a
commercial dance event to a ritzy display of local diversity. Rock
and show biz routines still set the pace, but plenty of other kinds
of work amplified and deepened it this year.</TE>
<TE>   New multi-company theme events, often artist-organized, are
growing more important. One this year spotlighted African American
achievement through the disorganized but promising Black
Choreographers Festival at the L.A. Theatre Center; another
considered feminist innovation in the ambitious Dance Moving Forward
festival at Highways. One more, just announced, will open the
Skirball Cultural Center to site-specific dance starting in November.</TE>
<TE>   At best, such series reflect the artists' passionate sense of
mission, rather than a something-for-everyone approach a la Dance K.
And within the limits of the themes, it has been good to see that a
sense of generosity and responsibility to fellow artists informed
such events.</TE>
<TE>   Self-presentation has also blossomed in the wake of Dance K,
sometimes in those theme events. The city has provided opportunities
for self-presentation at the L.A. Theatre Center, and the youthful,
fearless Dance L.A. troupe, led by Brian Pelletier, took the bait
several times in the past year--most notably in its multi-company
"Instinct" program, a kind of do-it-yourself approximation of a Dance
K mixed bill. The results were spotty, but the initiative was
impressive.</TE>
<TE>   Self-presentation is also finding a home at the El Portal space in
North Hollywood. Relatively low cost is a major factor, but it also
matters that an upgrade of its more problematic facilities (sound
insulation, for starters) is reportedly in the offing. And its
location, perceived as safer than LA Theater Center, helps.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest change in the landscape involves the ascendance of
Deborah Brockus' Spectrum series to the role of Dance Kaleidoscope's
natural successor. The word "spectrum," of course, expresses the same
sense of variety as "kaleidoscope"--although it conveys,
appropriately enough in this case, a more purposeful sense of
organization. In the multiple duties of dancer, choreographer,
company leader, series producer and sometimes even the technician
responsible for running video projectors backstage, Brockus has had
to be organized or die.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend's Spectrum is the 12th in the series, now running
four times a year at the tiny Ivar Theatre in Hollywood. It showcases
17 local dancers and companies. In addition, Brockus started what she
hopes will be two additional series: a children's showcase ("New
Perspectives") and a multimedia event ("Caught Between: Dancing for
Camera and Live Audience").</TE>
<TE>   Multiply the number of performances in her three series by the
average number of performing groups on view, and she's clearly the
front-runner in local dance presentation, already out-achieving Dance
Kaleidoscope in scope of activity, although not yet in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Some members of the local dance community view Brockus with
suspicion because she presents her own work on each of her programs
(except for the children's series), and because she specializes in
pop or jazz dance, a form always plentiful in the Southland but not
always respected by those coming from the ballet or modern dance
worlds.</TE>
<TE>   Those who share this suspicion used to put down Spectrum as a
showcase of nonentities, but after Jamie Nichols took home multiple
Lester Horton Dance Awards this year for work presented in the
series, that attitude slipped quietly into obsolescence.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly Spectrum differs from Dance K in the inclusion of much
more pop choreography and, thus far at least, far less world dance.
(Brockus has said she wants more, and the lineup for Spectrum 12
offers some evidence of progress.) Moreover the emphasis on short
pieces means the audience sees twice as many companies a night as
Dance K programmed.</TE>
<TE>   The choices reflect Brockus' curatorial philosophy and she's
entitled. The reality of Southland dance in 2002 is that some of the
hottest choreographers work everywhere--pop modernist Robert Gilliam,
for instance, has presented work for Brockus, Ibach, the Ford series
and even the monthly, late-night, all-pop Choreographers Carnival at
the Key Club on the Sunset Strip. Stephanie Gilliland's hybrid Tongue
dancers turn up nearly as often. In a freewheeling, nonsectarian
society, can dance afford to enforce boundaries?</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, the integration of concert dance and popular culture is
a fertile subject for another essay, but Brockus' Spectrum often
makes the juncture seem imminent as well as exciting. In the
meantime, any local choreographers or company leaders who don't have
her on their Christmas card lists just aren't paying attention.</TE>

<LD>*** HAIRSPRAY, Original cast, Sony Classical</LD>
<LD>   "I used to hate musical comedy," writes bizarro filmmaker John
Waters in the liner notes to the cast album of the musical based on
his "Hairspray," which opened on Broadway Aug. 15. However, he claims
that this score, by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, has "turned me
into a real show-tune queen." Gee, do you think it's just a
coincidence that the show that transformed his taste is one from
which he'll take royalties?</LD>
<LD>   Beyond that, his comment unfortunately may raise expectations a
little too high. The sound of "Hairspray" isn't radically different
from that of "Grease" or "Little Shop of Horrors" or several
less-well-known musicals that use pop styles of the late '50s and
early '60s.</LD>
<TE>   Waters' notes also make a big deal out of a couple of topics that
the lyrics address: the racial integration of teenagers' social
institutions in 1962 Baltimore, and fat liberation--the show delivers
a message that girth can be great, that big women can be the life of
the party. Still, judging only from the recording (I haven't seen the
show), "Hairspray" is not exactly searing social commentary.</TE>
<TE>   The recording is a fun, finger-snapping confection that is most
distinguishable from similar shows by the presence of Harvey
Fierstein in the drag role of Edna, the warm-hearted mother of the
leading character. His patented croak is here in all of its
cellar-dwelling glory.</TE>
<TE>   The album does its essential job well: It makes the show, which is
staged by Jack O'Brien of San Diego's Globe Theatres, sound as if it
would be a lot of fun.</TE>
<TE>   ***AUDRA McDONALD, "Happy Songs", Nonesuch</TE>
<TE>   The title of this album (due in stores Sept. 17) is surely
someone's idea of a joke. Most of these songs are not "happy." One
sample lyric: "My heart is broken, it won't ever mend." A couple of
sample song titles: "Ill Wind (You're Blowin' Me No Good"), "Beat My
Dog."</TE>
<TE>   Not that the album is a downer. The characters in these songs
aren't necessarily defeated. But they are people who are struggling
with life, not people who are blissfully content with what they have.</TE>
<TE>   Broadway star McDonald (or should we say, incipient TV star
McDonald? She has a role on an upcoming NBC series, "Mister
Sterling," as well as a new baby, so presumably she won't have much
time for appearing in musicals any time soon) displays her usual keen
sense of style in her selections, as well as her impeccable
musicality in her performances.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the songs were copyrighted between 1927 and 1954. They
include three very familiar standards: "I Wish I Were in Love Again,"
with its dazzlingly witty Lorenz Hart lyric; "More Than You Know";
and "He Loves and She Loves," which is performed here with a slow,
tender guitar arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the vintage selections won't be nearly as familiar to
McDonald fans. The opener, "Ain't It De Truth?," was cut from the
film "Cabin in the Sky" and included in the 1957 musical "Jamaica."
McDonald sings the Brazilian folk song "Bambalele" in Portuguese and
vocalise--no words at all--in Duke Ellington's "On a Turquoise
Cloud." Irving Berlin's "Supper Time," from the 1933 show "As
Thousands Cheer," is a raw lament by an abandoned wife and mother who
sounds as if the Depression is hitting home.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald usually supports contemporary composers too, and two are
represented here: Jay Leonhart ("Beat My Dog") and Michael John
LaChiusa ("See What I Wanna See"). Both selections are amusingly
grouchy, fitting in well with the general theme of unhappy songs.</TE>
<TE>   ** BROADWAY INSPIRATIONS, Various artists, Fynsworth Alley</TE>
<TE>   "Happy Songs" would actually be a better title for this new
compilation than it is for Audra McDonald's latest. In fact, "Happy
Songs" would be a much better title than this album's real moniker,
"Broadway Inspirations," considering how many of the uplifting songs
on this album were never in any Broadway show.</TE>
<TE>   It even opens with a song from a movie, "Newsies," and includes
selections from such non-Broadway theatrical fare as "Heartbeats,"
"Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens" and "Kicks: The
Showgirl Musical"--in addition to eight shows that really were on
Broadway. The album title is an example of a larger phenomenon:
attaching the "Broadway" label to any form of musical theater other
than opera, perhaps on the dubious grounds that the tourists who
populate Broadway know nothing about any other venues where they can
see musicals.</TE>
<TE>   Packaging aside, this album has some genuinely inspirational
moments--for example, the late Laurie Beechman singing a power-pop,
gospel-shaded arrangement of "You'll Never Walk Alone." But it also
has some dross, such as the supposedly grand finale, "These Are the
Good Times," from "Kicks," also sung by Beechman. This song is the
epitome of the sort of shallow, feel-good anthem that turns some
people off to the whole idea of musicals. It shares some of the same
sentiments as Stephen Sondheim's "Our Time," from "Merrily We Roll
Along," which is also on this album, sung by Liz and Ann Hampton
Callaway. But the Sondheim song is an artfully written jewel by
comparison.</TE>
<TE>   The album has a couple of intriguing, bass-dominated jazzy
arrangements of unlikely songs: "It's Today" from "Mame," sung by
Paige O'Hara, and "You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile" from
"Annie," sung by Jason Graae--who, oddly enough, is the only male
soloist (compared with nine women soloists and two female duets) on
the album.</TE>
<TE>   **  1/2 THE BOYS FROM SYRACUSE, 1963 London cast, Rudy Vallee,
Frances Langford, Decca Broadway</TE>
<TE>   The 1938 musical comedy "The Boys From Syracuse," like its
precursors by Plautus and Shakespeare, was about twins. So perhaps
it's fitting that this new album offers two separate, albeit partial
renditions of the Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart score.</TE>
<TE>   First up are 14 tracks from the 1963 London production. These are
followed by six songs recorded in December 1938, less than a month
after the original Broadway production opened--but not with the
original cast. Instead, Decca recruited two of its contract singers,
Rudy Vallee and Frances Langford, to sing six songs from the score as
a "souvenir" record. No original cast album was recorded.</TE>
<TE>   Most musical theater scholars would have preferred the chance to
hear the original cast. Still, Vallee and Langford were in fine,
mellow form, and the remastering job is excellent.</TE>
<TE>   Comparisons between Vallee/Langford and the 1963 London cast
aren't always appropriate, because Vallee sings two songs sung by
women in the real score, "Oh, Diogenes!" and "Sing for Your Supper."
However, Langford brought a darker sound to "Falling in Love With
Love" than did her London equivalent, Lynn Kennington, and the
Vallee/Langford duet on "The Shortest Day of the Year" is more
interesting than the Denis Quilley solo from the London cast.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the London cast isn't especially notable. To American
ears, the English accents ("This Cahn't Be Love" instead of "This
Can't Be Love") sound a little out of place in such a prime example
of old-fashioned American musical comedy. Too bad no recording of the
last L.A. "Syracuse," the 1999 Reprise! production, is available.</TE>
<TE>   *** GETTING TO KNOW WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, Various artists, Echo
Peak Productions, for the Road Scholar series</TE>
<TE>   A new series of introductory audio biographies, Road Scholar,
opens with a documentary on the Bard of Avon.</TE>
<TE>   Smoothly narrated by Fred Child and written and produced by Joy
Wake, with contributions from a variety of Shakespeare scholars and a
couple of actors, and ample musical selections, the program covers a
surprising amount of territory in just 74 minutes. It even delves
briefly into such issues as the bisexual implications of the sonnets
and the question of whether others could have written some of the
plays (probably not, is the general conclusion).</TE>
<TE>   The pacing keeps the program moving along, but without any kind of
a hurried feeling. There isn't time for detailed analysis of all the
great plays, but several are examined for a few minutes each. The
best audience for this isn't Shakespeare novices or scholars, but
rather the large group that falls in between those two descriptions.</TE>

<HD>A Joni Mitchell-esque Breakthrough for Patricia Barber</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite critical raves and a following of dedicated fans, Patricia
Barber has not broken through to the level of public awareness
achieved by such shooting stars as Diana Krall, Norah Jones and Jane
Monheit.</LD>
<LD>   It's unlikely that she is overly concerned about the more visible
competition, or that she would in any way diminish what she has to
say to reach a larger audience. Even in her last album, "Nightclub"
(released in 2000), a program of familiar standards, she transformed
the songs through her multilayered aesthetics.</LD>
<LD>   In her new CD, "Verse" (****, Blue Note), Barber traverses even
more compelling territory with her first collection of all original
material. It is a stunning musical accomplishment.</LD>
<TE>   It may be the kiss of death to say that this remarkable recording
is important, that it sets a level of creativity and musical quality
that is beyond definition, even though it could only have come from
the world of jazz. But hopefully not. Because there is so much to
hear in this brilliant collection of songs, that it offers revelatory
experiences with each repeated hearing.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, I've questioned Barber's over-generosity with her
musicians, if only because she seemed at times to diminish her
presence by offering them so much space. Here, however, accompanied
by a sterling ensemble that includes the particularly vivid presence
of guitarist Neal Alger and trumpeter David Douglas, Barber crafts
their participation in a fashion that integrates every musical and
lyrical element into a unified statement.</TE>
<TE>   Barber has described the songs on "Verse" as her homage to Joni
Mitchell. The link is understandable, given the artful blend of
lyrics and music, the literary quality of the words, and the vantage
point on relationships that ranges from dark longing to sardonic
irony.</TE>
<TE>   But there was never any doubt that Mitchell's music grew from folk
roots, enhanced by a perceptive ear for engaging harmonies. Barber,
like Mitchell, enriches her words with metaphors that are
intellectually and emotionally stimulating. A few examples from
different songs: "If I were blue, like David Hockney's pool"; "I
could eat your words, melt objection with stimulation, simmer truth
with prevarication"; "Syllogistically speaking, if 'A' is you and 'B'
is me, logical progression will lead to 'C.' "</TE>
<TE>   But Barber's melodic phrases, the arc of her melodies and the
propulsiveness of her rhythms are the product of the musical
sophistication of jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Equally worth noting, although Barber's piano work plays a modest
role on the album, her solo on "You Gotta Go Home" firmly stands on
its own as an improvisational expression, and other tunes--"Lost in
This Love," "Pieces" and "Regular Pleasures"--employ offbeat meters
with coherence and logic.</TE>
<TE>   Add to all of the above the intriguingly dark timbre of Barber's
low alto voice, and the way she remains in touch with the music while
dipping into provocative thoughts and story lines, and the result is
an exquisite, not-to-be-missed creative adventure.</TE>
<TE>   In her description of the work, Barber writes that "the task of
any artist is to create a ruthlessly individual vision of the art
from the inside out." With "Verse," she has taken a giant step in
that direction.</TE>
<TE>   Barber's not the only gifted vocalist with a new album. Here are a
few others that have just arrived or are on the immediate horizon:</TE>
<TE>   Karrin Allyson, "In Blue" (***, Concord Records). Allyson is a
canny artist who wisely conceives of her recordings in thematic
terms. Her recent CDs have included outings devoted to the music of
John Coltrane, as well as a collection of songs in French, Italian
and Portuguese.</TE>
<TE>   This time out, she is focused on the blues and blues-related
songs. At first thought, Allyson's velvety textured, ingenue-innocent
voice might not seem to be the best vehicle for numbers such as Oscar
Brown Jr.'s "Long as You're Living" and "Hum Drum Blues." But by
playing against type, she manages to bring the songs alive. When
she's singing tunes that fit more logically into her stylistic
metier--Bobby Troup's rarely heard "The Meaning of the Blues," Joni
Mitchell's "Blue Motel Room," Blossom Dearie's gently swinging "Bye
Bye Country Boy," her atmospheric scat singing on "Angel
Eyes"--Allyson once again affirms her status as a gifted artist with
an omnivorous musical appetite.</TE>
<TE>   Tuck &amp; Patti, "Chocolate Moment" (***, T&amp;P Records). It's never
been quite clear why the married team of guitarist Tuck Andress and
singer Patti Cathcart hasn't attracted a larger following. Part of
the problem may be their insistence on working as a duo of guitar and
voice. For all of their ability to find colorful variations of sound
and rhythm--intensified by Andress' astonishing virtuosity--the
combination has built-in limitations in sound and substance.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Tuck &amp; Patti have been particularly successful with
original takes on standard and current pop tunes. This time out,
however--their first release on their own label--they have elected to
go with all original material. That's a demanding task for most
performers, but the duo comes up with a number of impressive songs,
some filtered through a vaguely country-like style. "Rejoice," for
example, manages to blend country and calypso qualities. On
"Reverie," Cathcart's smoky bourbon sound flows easily through lush,
jazz ballad harmonies, and on "Wildflower," voice and guitar merge
around sliding glissando string textures. (Tuck &amp; Patti perform at
Catalina's on Monday night.)</TE>
<TE>   Jenna Mammina, "Meant to Be" (***, Mamma Grace Records). The
name's probably not familiar, but Bay Area singer Mammina has been
doing imaginative work for more than a decade. Like Allyson, her
sound is light and airy--ranging toward a Blossom Dearie childlike
quality on some numbers.</TE>
<TE>   But there's nothing immature about her interpretations or choice
of material, and on some tunes she employs that sound to her
advantage, as in a rendering of "Honeysuckle Rose" that calls up
memories of Rose Murphy's coy '50s version. Mammina's other choices
are amazingly far reaching: U2's "Running to Stand Still," Steely
Dan's "Dirty Work," James Taylor's "You Can Close Your Eyes," as well
as Duke Ellington's "In a Mellow Tone" and Gordon &amp; Warren's "The
More I See You."</TE>
<TE>   That's a demanding selection of material, but Mammina delivers it
well, respecting the original sources, yet placing her
interpretations in appealing jazz settings. Toward that end, she is
aided by players such as soprano saxophonist Paul McCandless,
violinist Darol Anger, bassist James Genus, keyboardist Matt Rollings
and others. The only question is why this absorbing collection is not
on a more widely distributed jazz label. Mammina deserves to be more
widely heard. (Available at www.jennamammina.com.)</TE>

<HD>Brother, Father, Politician, Martyr</HD>
<DH>Linus Roache felt the pull of Robert F. Kennedy's charisma
while preparing to play the politician in an FX movie.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Before he was cast as Robert F. Kennedy in the FX movie "RFK,"
premiering Sunday night at 8, British actor Linus Roache knew very
little about the slain U.S. senator from New York.</LD>
<LD>   "I was 4 years old when he was killed," says Roache ("Wings of the
Dove"). "It was very interesting speaking to my peers and people of
my generation--they know very little about him."</LD>
<LD>   But when Roache began his research into the third son in the
Kennedy clan, he immediately felt a strong connection, one he didn't
completely understand. "It's part of the whole Bobby Kennedy thing,"
he explains, "in terms of: Why did everybody feel so connected to
this man?</LD>
<TE>   "My feeling is that he was a very real human being," the actor
adds. "He went through this extraordinary change and came to a point
in this own life where he found a conscience that was genuine and,
therefore, as he spoke about very big issues, they became very real
and possible. He seemed to express the fact that we can do better,
that change is possible. As soon as you hear a human being speak like
that, you feel this incredible connection to something that is truly
possible."</TE>
<TE>   "RFK," which was directed by Robert Dornhelm ("Sins of the
Father," "Anne Frank") and written by Hank Steinberg ("61*"),
chronicles the final five years of Kennedy's life, from the
assassination of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, in November
1963, to his own assassination in the kitchen of L.A.'s Ambassador
Hotel in June 1968.</TE>
<TE>   The story focuses on Kennedy's personal transformation from a pit
bull of an attorney general during his brother's administration to
the controversial and passionate presidential candidate. The film
also explores Kennedy's underdog status in his own family and his
guilt and pain over the loss of his brother.</TE>
<TE>   James Cromwell portrays President Lyndon Johnson, with whom
Kennedy had an adversarial relationship; David Paymer is Kennedy
staffer and friend Dick Goodwin; and Martin Donovan is the ghost of
JFK.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg says one of the biggest challenges writing an historical
project like "RFK" is not to get bogged down in events.</TE>
<TE>   "It is incredible to me that anyone would endeavor to tell the RFK
story from birth to death. You couldn't do that in two hours. Even in
those five years, there was an incredible amount of just very, very
dramatic things that happened that you didn't have time for. So you
just had to get down to the emotional essence."</TE>
<TE>   The first idea Steinberg came up with was having Kennedy carry on
an inner dialogue with the ghost of his late brother. "It was
executive producer Robert Cooper's idea to tell the RFK story between
the time that Jack died and the time Bobby died and to talk about
that transformation," he says. "As I was doing the research and
thinking about the fact that you have someone who is haunted by the
death of his brother and the brother had such a powerful influence on
him, it just seemed to me to be a great way to show he was haunted by
his brother. All that family stuff in the movies makes it like a
Shakespearean tragedy. If you look at Shakespeare, it is all about
these dysfunctional families and brothers and fathers."</TE>
<TE>   Roache says he had a hard time separating himself from RFK as the
production wound down, "because I had been living with him" for so
long. The final scene shot in the movie was the assassination
sequence. "It was a real letting go. We literally moved piece by
piece from the ballroom into the first section of the kitchen, down
the corridor onto the kitchen floor. It was then just a close-up on
Bobby. We were doing it just after midnight, the same time that it
happened."</TE>
<TE>   "RFK" can be seen Sunday at 8 and 10 p.m. on FX. The movie has
been rated TV-PG (may not be suitable for younger children).</TE>

<HD>Mother Church of a Secular City?</HD>
<DH>The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels Could Become the
Spiritual Center of This Disconnected City. Then Again, It Could
Become a $200-Million Reminder of Just How Little We Have in Common.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two dramatic processions, one joyous and one solemn, will advance
toward the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels within nine days
of each other next month.During the first, 3,000 people, including
Nigerian and Scottish drummers, a family carrying the relics of
saints, and 700 deacons, priests, bishops and cardinals in vestments
of various hues of white and adobe, will approach the cathedral's
three-story bronze doors to be greeted by Cardinal Roger M. Mahony.
"Brothers and sisters in Christ, this is a day of rejoicing," he will
begin. Then, to the exultant strains of Beethoven's "Ode to Joy," the
entourage of believers will proceed into the 21st century cathedral
for the first time, joining in an ancient Roman Catholic rite of
consecration. That will be followed by a nearly three-hour liturgy
steeped in poignancy and power, faith and tradition, to commission
the $200-million cathedral and conference center as the Mother Church
of the nation's largest Roman Catholic archdiocese.</LD>
<LD>   Nine days later, on Sept. 11, a second procession of uniformed
firefighters and police officers will leave City Hall in emergency
vehicles following a moment of silence on the first anniversary of
the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. They will drive the
two blocks to the cathedral for an interfaith prayer service infused
with patriotism and national resolve.</LD>
<TE>   The processions, one rich in Roman Catholic theology and
tradition, the other an expression of solidarity in the public
square, represent two distinctly different missions the cathedral
hopes to claim for itself as the city's new spiritual showcase. It
should become, in the vision of Cardinal Mahony, the Roman Catholic
archbishop of Los Angeles, the fulcrum where the secular and sacred
are joined for the glory of God and the good of the city. "The
cathedral is not only the center of the life and prayer of the local
church," Mahony declares, "but also a symbol evocative of the deepest
aspirations and hopes of the whole polis, the whole people of Los
Angeles, t! he earthly city yearning for consummation, the completion
yet to come in the new Jerusalem."</TE>
<TE>   It is a noble vision, and a tall order, but the cardinal is not
alone in his hopes. The cathedral is seen as the place where the soul
of the church is enshrined in sacred architecture, a spiritual center
for seekers of all kinds, a booster for downtown development, a
servant of the poor and disenfranchised, a patron of music and the
arts, and a place where prophetic preaching and political activism
call individuals to a higher moral consciousness, and shape public
policy.</TE>
<TE>   But in a horizontal city that even now is straining to remain
unified in the face of centrifugal forces that threaten to spin off
the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood, will Mahony and the
archdiocese have not only the faith but the marketing moxie to make
it work? Can the cathedral become common ground in an urban geography
that is economically and culturally disjointed, a fact that shows up
on U.S. Census maps as multicolored islands of disparity and
difference? And, in an entertainment capital where diversions are
many, will the cathedral be as important to the vast majority of
Southern Californians as say, the Getty Center, or Staples Center,
where nearly 18,000 fans come out to cheer during each Lakers game?</TE>
<TE>   In short, can the cardinal pull it off?</TE>
<TE>   Infinite futures await this cathedral. "What are we going to do
with it?" asks Pam Haldeman, chair of the sociology department at
Mount St. Mary's College in Los Angeles. "The people involved are
going to be so crucial. It doesn't matter what it looks like in its
form. The players, the actors, will provide all of the meaning it has
as a symbol in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   It will take more than heart-rending preaching, beautiful music,
liturgical excellence and ministries for the poor. In many ways, the
degree to which the new cathedral is embraced by Los Angeles will
involve its user-friendliness-everything from knowledgeable tour
guides and the cost of cathedral parking to the accessibility of the
cathedral conference center for groups interested in meeting there.</TE>
<TE>   Daunting public relations challenges also lie ahead, among them
the national scandal over the sexual abuse of minors by Catholic
priests and bishops, and a controversy over the costly price of
cathedral burial crypts that may limit that last resting place to the
rich and famous. Just getting people downtown-teeming with commuters
during the week but forsaken on weekends-can be a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   There will be precious little time to get all this right.</TE>
<TE>   "The first six months are going to be really critical in setting
the tone of welcome and inclusion and engagement with the broader
community," says Stephen D. Rountree, executive vice president and
chief operating officer of the J. Paul Getty Trust, who played a key
role in overseeing the building and the opening of the Getty Center.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony has a game plan right out of the Bible, a passage from
Isaiah. Our Lady of the Angels is to be "a house of prayer for all
peoples," as is inscribed on the cathedral's cornerstone.</TE>
<TE>   Call it marketing or call it holy hospitality, it is an
irreducible commitment that Mahony says he will stress in his
inaugural sermon, one he has been writing since late last year. "It
is really critical that it be a place for all people, that everyone
feel at home," he says. "I'm hopeful that a lot of people who are not
Catholic, in a way, will walk away and say, 'I belong here. This is
for me also.' "</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what a Los Angeles cathedral must become if it is
to appeal to Southern California's rainbow population. Public
relations missteps could leave the impression that the cathedral is
aloof or unconcerned with the lives of most people. But the cathedral
has a lot going for it. People of all walks of life and beliefs want
it to bind the city together, not as a symbol of a great faith's
triumphalism-which it may be in part-but as an icon of civic unity."</TE>
<TE>   Angelenos deeply want to experience community," Haldeman says. "We
don't go about our lives acting that way, but I think we're less
individualistic than we pretend to be. When there are solidifying
events such as the Lakers winning the championship, there's a
tremendous rally and a strong sense of group. I think the potential
is there. It just depends whether leaders bring it out in us.
Cathedrals and Staples type places can bring us together in a
heartbeat, or divide us."</TE>
<TE>   To succeed, the cathedral must make real the welcome implicit in
its art and plaza-a quilt of symbolism honoring diversity, from its
statues to its iconography to the stone in its fountains. It should,
in short, practice what its symbolism preaches. The cathedral and
plaza must become a crossroads where rich and poor, housed and
homeless, share common ground. It should be a place where lovers
meet, school children gawk and learn, friends meet over coffee, and
where seekers of transcendence or those who simply want a break from
daily routine may sit in the silence of one of 11 chapels, or bask in
natural light streaming into the cathedral proper through towering
clerestory windows of Spanish alabaster.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, who may think as often about marketing as miters, says he
is aware of the challenges. Few details have escaped his attention.
Recently, he was "amazed" to learn that the 10 parking spaces planned
for tour buses next to the cathedral may not be enough. He also
thinks they learned a few things from the Getty Center about toilets.
After hearing of how the center had to quickly add portable toilets
to accommodate the crush of visitors in the opening weeks, Mahony
says the cathedral decided to build more restrooms. There will be 2
hours of free parking for worshipers during Mass, otherwise it's
$2.50 for each 20 minutes with a $12 a day maximum.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese is working closely with the Los Angeles Visitors
and Convention Bureau, and Msgr. Kevin Kostelnik, Mahony's longtime
secretary who has been named pastor of the cathedral, sits on the
Central City Assn. Mahony has even talked to the MTA about improved
directional signs at the Red Line Civic Center subway station
pointing the way to the cathedral. For the longer term, he has
personally lobbied the state transportation department to build a new
offramp from the Harbor Freeway for better access to the cathedral
and the nearby Music Center and Walt Disney Concert Hall. The offramp
is at least four years away. The state says it will cost $25 million
and that construction will begin in six years.</TE>
<TE>   Just getting people to come downtown may be a formidable
challenge. European cathedrals were located in the heart of the city.
They were a focal point of civic life. Indeed, one reason they were
so large was so they could accommodate everyone in town when events
called for it. The 3,000-seat Los Angeles cathedral is not in the hub
of the city but in one of many urban hubs. While the number of
central city residents in apartments and artists lofts is growing,
downtown remains for now a daytime city filled by commuters.</TE>
<TE>   On weekends, the government buildings that surround the cathedral
are empty. It's as if a neutron bomb had exploded, wiping out all the
people while the high-rise towers and government buildings remained
intact. "The county government buildings on weekends don't have life.
They draw life away because no one likes to be near a building that
is empty," says Los Angeles architect and urban designer Doug
Suisman. What is needed, he says, is for the Los Angeles County Board
of Supervisors to commit "a great act of civic generosity" and give
up its private parking lot near the corner of Grand Avenue and Temple
Street so that a restaurant can be built. "</TE>
<TE>   In medieval cities there were always a number of cafes,
restaurants, even bars, right near the cathedral. That adds to the
feeling of a place to go and to stay with the family," Suisman says.
At the moment, there is a risk that the cathedral with its enclosed
plaza will come off as a sacred precinct.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles architect Barton Myers is even more critical. He says
the cathedral, the new Walt Disney Concert Hall downtown and the
Getty Center in Brentwood are each located in "isolated" areas that
don't generate activity around them. "That's hundreds of millions of
dollars spent that doesn't leverage hundreds of millions of dollars,"
Myers says. "That's the disappointment of Los Angeles; we haven't
been able to build the connections the way we should have."</TE>
<TE>   It will be important for private property owners, the city and the
county to follow through with plans they have talked about for five
years to transform Grand Avenue-which connects the financial
district, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Walt Disney Concert
Hall, Music Center and cathedral-into a landscaped,
pedestrian-friendly promenade. Another phase calls for development of
shops, entertainment and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, the cathedral is not without attractions. The
Cathedral Conference Center, located across the plaza from the
church, will have a coffee shop and restaurant. Its conference rooms
are similar to those available at major downtown hotels. The
conference center's second floor seats 700 and the kitchen has the
capacity to serve 1,000 meals. A number of groups are meeting there
even before the cathedral's dedication, among them the Downtown
Rotary Club. There are 600 underground parking spaces. Plans are
afoot for a food festival on the plaza.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the cathedral hopes to leverage its location
near the Music Center and the Walt Disney Concert Hall to attract
worshipers and visitors. Indeed, the Los Angeles Philharmonic,
conducted by Esa-Pekka Solonen, will perform at the cathedral on
Sept. 27, followed by the Los Angeles Master Chorale on Nov. 10. Also
planned are recitals featuring the cathedral's 6,019-pipe organ,
including one in January 2003 by Samuel Soria, who was organist at
Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago before coming to Our Lady of the
Angels as cathedral organist and assistant director of music.</TE>
<TE>   "The mission of the place is to bring people together and to bring
them closer to God," says Frank Brownstead, the cathedral's director
of music. "Music is the thing that can most easily do that."</TE>
<TE>   Cathedral officials also plan to coordinate evening prayer
services with events at the Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Music
Center. Msgr. Kostelnik thinks patrons may wish to stroll Cathedral
Plaza or attend evening prayer services before proceeding to concerts
and plays a block or two away.</TE>
<TE>   The city around the cathedral surely will change over the
centuries, as did the Pantheon in Rome that once stood remote and
supreme but is now surrounded by apartments and cafes. In time, Our
Lady of the Angels could be the center of life in this secular city.
The more immediate and formidable challenge will be shaping
perceptions of the cathedral. What feelings will stir visitors as
they stand in the nave and look to the ceiling 10 stories above them,
or when they lift up their eyes to the 15-story bell tower from which
will eventually ring 18 bells heard for six miles. Will those
feelings bring us together?</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Mahony says the pealing of the bells in times of public
joy, the tolling of bells in times of public mourning, the daily
ringing out to invite the faithful to Mass will help connect the
community that surrounds the cathedral. "People are very used to
seeing the cathedral now," Mahony says, "but they're not used to
hearing the cathedral. When the bells are in, there will be many
people who will not see the cathedral but will be touched by
it-people in the too many downtown prisons who can't see them but
will hear the bells, patients at the neighborhood hospitals, rest
homes, people who are lonely and can't leave their homes. The bells
have their own way of saying, 'Don't worry. Don't be concerned. God
is nearby.' "</TE>
<TE>   That's how the cardinal sees it. But cathedral art and
architecture, even the sound of bells, are merely suggestive. "It's
sort of up now to L.A. to create the meaning," says Sandra L. Harte,
a sociology professor at Mount St. Mary College.</TE>
<TE>   The church's location in Los Angeles' principal business and
government power center may send mixed messages. On one hand, it s!
peaks of a commitment to the city. But in the eyes of some, among
them the Catholic Worker, a grass-roots activist group which serves
the poor, the location and the monumental size of the cathedral peg
the cardinal as part of the power structure.</TE>
<TE>   At the cathedral's southwest corner at Grand and Temple stands the
Music Center. The Walt Disney Concert Hall is one block farther
south, followed by the Colburn School of Performing Arts, the Museum
of Contemporary Art and the financial district, with its towering
high-rises. Two blocks to the southeast is Los Angeles City Hall. The
county supervisors' chambers are directly across Temple from the
cathedral. For the dispossessed and marginalized-and perhaps many in
the middle class-these cultural, governmental and business venues may
come off as centers of wealth, power and privilege.</TE>
<TE>   But downtown also is a melting pot where many cultures and income
groups work in close proximity. Within walking distance of the
cathedral lie Little Tokyo and Chinatown. Then there's Olvera
Street-the historic core of Latino Los Angeles-and the teeming
Broadway commercial district, which largely caters to
Spanish-speaking shoppers. And if some people live in luxury
apartments and condos on Bunker Hill, others sleep beneath freeway
overpasses.</TE>
<TE>   Within the downtown boundaries the cathedral will serve as a
parish church, the median household income is $14,193, according to
an estimate this year by Claritas Inc., which tracks demographic
information. Nearly 53% of the area's 26,811 residents earn less than
$15,000 a year. Another 15% earn less than $25,000 annually. The
population reflects Southern California's ethnic diversity, with
Hispanics accounting for 32% of the downtown population, and white
non-Hispanics 18%. Another 22% are Asian, and 24% are black
non-Hispanics, according to an analysis of the 2000 U.S. Census."</TE>
<TE>   Its [location] is making the statement that it's an urban
cathedral," Harte says. "The challenge will be, is it going to be a
cathedral of power or a cathedral of the people?"</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, powerful people and corporations contributed the bulk of
the millions raised to build the church. Among the biggest
contributors have been Sir Daniel Donohue, head of the Dan Murphy
Foundation,which contributed the first $25 million, while the Thomas
and Dorothy Leavey Foundation and Rupert Murdoch's family foundation
each gave $10 million. Other contributors include Betsy Bloomingdale,
Roy and Patty Disney, former Mayor Richard Riordan, former Dodgers
owner Peter O'Malley, Bob and Dolores Hope, the late Lew Wasserman,
chairman of Universal Studios, and the Times-Mirror Foundation, which
gave $500,000. By contrast, $1.5 million has been raised so far from
more than 5,200 individual donors who paid anywhere from $50 to
$5,000 to purchase 15,000 paving stones for the cathedral's floor.
Many of the contributors are everyday Catholics who want to be a part
of history.</TE>
<TE>   For a cathedral that is determined to be a house of prayer for all
people, money can be a sensitive issue. "One of the key questions
will be their relationship to the corporate community," says the
Getty's Rountree, who was one of the jurors on a panel that
recommended Jose Rafael Moneo as the cathedral's architect. "There is
a lot of desire among the business community to use and be seen at
exciting new places like the Getty Center and Disney Hall. Given some
of the criticism about the cathedral and the money that's been spent,
I would think [the church] would want to think very carefully about
that."</TE>
<TE>   Rountree adds that Mahony is well aware of the challenge.
Anticipating that the Getty Center could be seen as elitist, Rountree
says the center launched a marketing campaign focused on welcoming
families, schools and community groups. More than two years ago
Mahony confidants asked Rountree's advice on how the archdiocese
could best manage a very public and very civic place.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Dietrich of the Catholic Worker, which runs a downtown soup
kitchen and works with the homeless, has criticized the cathedral
project from the beginning. He remains skeptical, despite the
inauguration of Cathedral Charities, a nascent program to help the
homeless, work with youth and visit jail inmates."</TE>
<TE>   I just don't think this is going to be the centerpiece of the
cathedral," Dietrich says. "I think the grand meeting place and the
parking lot that costs $15 is going to be the centerpiece, as well as
the crypts in the bottom of the cathedral. These clearly have much
more focus than the social justice aspects of the cathedral."</TE>
<TE>   Sister Patricia Geoghegan, who has been named director of
Cathedral Charities, rejects that charge. "I appreciate the good the
Catholic Worker does, but I don't think they have that part of it
right," says Geoghegan, whose most recent assignment was working on
nutrition programs for poor children in Haiti. She has already lined
up volunteers who are providing a modest 75 lunches twice weekly for
poor immigrants and the homeless who live beneath bridges and
overpasses. The meals are distributed by a nonprofit organization
known as Jovenes Inc., run by Father Richard Estrada, a founding
director. She also is lining up volunteers to visit prisons and
jails.</TE>
<TE>   The effort pales in comparison to the extensive programs
undertaken by more established churches and groups, but it's a start.
Geoghegan admits she has virtually no budget and the bulk of the
effort depends on volunteer help. But no ministry, including the
cathedral's music ministry, has its budget yet. Earlier this year,
the archdiocese was forced to trim its budget by $4 million and cut
back staff because of the falling stock market, in which Mahony says
the archdiocese has long invested. Mahony "has a long history of
social work and caring for the poor," Geoghegan says. "The motivation
is purely the long-term motivation of the Catholic Church-to reach
out to the forgotten people."</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese's public relations acumen is already being tested
by controversy over the expected price of 1,300 crypts and 5,000
niches for cremated remains in the cathedral undercroft. There is no
price list yet, but one knowledgeable church official said a $50,000
starting price for crypts would not be unreasonable.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, an archdiocesan spokesman bristled at a Times story that
quoted an unnamed theologian as calling the expensive crypts "the
ecclesiastical equivalent of a sky box." The fees will be placed in
an endowment fund to help meet the cathedral's operating costs. At
this point, the archdiocese won't even venture an estimate for the
cathedral's annual operations budget, and pleads that it will take a
year of operations before anything is known. It costs $3.5 million
annually to maintain St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York. Nationally,
the average cathedral budget is $550,000.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese continues to struggle with the protracted scandal
over the sexual abuse of minors by priests and bishops, and that is
likely to cast a shadow over the dedication of the cathedral, the
most visible symbol of Mahony's reign as archbishop of Los Angeles.
The crisis so far has seen investigations of 70 present or former Los
Angeles priests, and while that may be only a footnote in the history
of a cathedral built to stand 300 to 500 years, how Mahony continues
to respond will shape Southern California's perception of him and the
cathedral. "The man and the place are inextricably connected,"
Haldeman says.</TE>
<TE>   During an interview for this story, Mahony held up the cathedral
as "a new beginning." Later he elaborated on his remarks with an
extended, single-spaced e-mail-a sign of how seriously Mahony takes
the scandal's potential impact on his cathedral."</TE>
<TE>   The claim that a church or cathedral has valid meaning only when
it is built and used by saints leaves most of us standing on the
outside looking in," he wrote. He turned the issue again to the issue
of welcoming, the watchword of the cathedral's marketing. "While
saints and blessed are always welcome, those who have failed and
those who have sinned are particularly welcome. The cathedral will
achieve its greatest role precisely when, like Jesus, its arms/doors
swing open wide for those most in need of God's mercy and healing.
What other public, civic or cultural facility in our community offers
forgiveness, healing and renewal?"</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 14, Mahony plans a solemn day of atonement at the
cathedral for the sexual abuse of minors. The nation's Catholic
bishops, chastened by the scandal, have committed themselves to such
observances in their dioceses. But the fact remains that by holding
the Los Angeles ceremony in the new cathedral, Mahony will be trying
to position it not as a symbol of abuse but as a champion for
renewal. That, he insists, is what the new cathedral is all about.</TE>
<TE>   If architecture is idea made tactile, Our Lady of the Angels
virtually shouts the message that it is an ecclesiastical United
Nations and a place of welcome to all. Its bronze doors, designed by
artist Robert Graham, are emblazoned with icons of Mary and symbols
of human virtues expressed through the artistry of various cultures.
There are Japanese signs of heaven, a Hebrew depiction of the hand of
God, a tai chi symbol for harmony, a dog to symbolize loyalty, a
peacock to symbolize resurrection, a Celtic evangelist, a Croatian
cross, a Samoan kava bowl. A winding grapevine, symbolizing the
church, curls around the symbols to bring unity to the whole.</TE>
<TE>   Appropriate for a cathedral named after Mary, the doors' upper
panels honor various cultural representations of the mother of Jesus.
There is Mexico's Our Lady of Guadalupe, the Peruvian Virgin of
Pomata, the Colombian Virgin of Chiquinquira, Spain's Virgin of
Montserrat and Our Lady of Loreto, to name a few. Our Lady of the
Angels is also Our Lady of Diversity writ large.</TE>
<TE>   Crowning the doors is a life-size statue of Mary with outstretched
arms. Like Southern California, Graham's Mary breaks the conventional
mold. No veil covers her head. She is not wrapped in the swaddling
clothes of biblical times, but a full-length dress with billowing
sleeves, suggestive of Filipina attire. She could even pass as a
personal trainer from the Westside. She is youthful, with a feminine
sinuousness and understated athleticism. Her ethnicity? Latina?
African American? Caucasian? She is a woman for all people.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the great nave, which is a foot longer than St. Patrick's
Cathedral in New York, rich tapestries depicting "the communion of
saints" hang from the adobe-colored walls. The faces of the saints
recall everyday people seen on the streets and byways of Southern
California, along with familiar historical renditions of exemplars
such as St. Francis, with his circular monk's haircut. In the
ordinary faces of saints-children and youth, women and men-the church
hopes visitors will see intimations of themselves, and their own
potential to lead holier, fuller lives.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2.5-acre plaza, a grand staircase beckons visitors from the
sidewalks below to an urban oasis of calm and beauty amid the hustle
and bustle of Los Angeles. There is a grove of olive trees and palms
reminiscent of the Holy Land. Even the fountains and waterfalls pay
homage to Southern California's diversity. One fountain in particular
is a dramatic statement of solidarity with Jews, a course the Roman
Catholic Church set upon during Vatican II in the mid-1960s and
energetically pursued by Pope John Paul II, who in March 2000 visited
the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem. The $2.5-million fountain,
financed by a gift from an as yet anonymous Jewish couple from New
York, is inscribed in both Hebrew and English with words from ancient
Jewish sages. ("Three pillars uphold the world; divine teaching,
ethical service, and loving kindness.") It is finished in Jerusalem
stone shipped from Israel to Los Angeles, which has the
second-largest Jewish population in the nation. Another fountain is
engraved with Jesus' description of "living water." There is a shrine
to Our Lady of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   The symbolic soul of the city is here," Cathedral Pastor
Kolstelnik says. "The cathedral stands as a sacred space. It is
rising up as the opportunity for people to get most deeply in touch
with themselves, most deeply in touch with God." And perhaps with the
city as well.</TE>
<TE>   For the Catholic faithful, sharing the liturgy with their bishop
in a cathedral is a powerful sign of unity. There on the
cathedra--the bishop's throne--sits a successor of the apostles. To
have a bishop place his hand on your head in blessing is to be
touched by a hand that was touched by a hand that was touched by
hands going back in time to the Apostle Peter, who was touched by the
hand of Christ. Powerful stuff, that.</TE>
<TE>   A cathedral can be a unifier in the public square as well. In a
city that has seen its dark side in the riotous fires of injustice
and hate, as well as its good in everyday kindnesses and uncommon
heroism, a cathedral can stand as a beacon of universal values in the
secular city. It can move and motivate us to fulfill the promise of
our most authentic humanity and common good. It can encourage those
things that are noble and just, and remind all of the self-evident
answer to the biblical question, "Who is my neighbor?"</TE>
<TE>   But will it?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thank you for the wonderfully written and well-documented story on
Seattle ("The Decline and Fall of Seattle," by Kim Murphy, Aug. 4).
As a former Seattleite who had to move to find work, I agree with
much of what was described. I have seen Seattle grow, kicking and
screaming, into the world of large cities (while still wanting that
small-town mentality) and have seen the general attitude go from
friendly to downright sultry. Many times while walking down the
street, I would nod at others with a smile and get nothing in return.
People would look straight ahead, as if I didn't exist. Seattle has
become cold, frigid and, in the words of one friend, prudish on many
levels.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle is in a paradox. It wants to be the city it was in the
1960s, yet it also wants to be the city of today--two conflicting
ideals that don't necessarily mix. Its pollution and traffic are just
two glaring negatives to deal with. It is a city of a lot of meetings
and no action, and it has been so for as long as I can remember.</LD>

<TE>   My wife and I lived in Seattle for 2 1/2 years during the decline
before moving to Los Angeles. Murphy's cover story was quite
accurate. Thank you for printing it and not flinching from the truth.
It paints a true, if depressing, portrait of the city.</TE>

<TE>   As a '90s resident of Seattle, I think Murphy built an interesting
case for why it has become less desirable to migrate there. But she
didn't focus on the real problem: about 150 days of rain a year! I
had to put my Orange County-native wife on suicide watch the first
year we were married--the winter of '98-'99--when rain fell in the
Puget Sound region for 90-plus consecutive days.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thomas Curwen's article "Steelyard Blues" (Aug. 4) is a nice story on
Tamco Steel. Indeed, Tamco is the last remaining melt shop of its
type in California. However, his description of the rise and fall of
Henry Kaiser's steel mill is not quite the whole story. While it is
true that the California Speedway now resides on the site of some of
Kaiser Steel's operations, the rolling mills are still in operation
today. California Steel Industries is the largest producer of
flat-rolled steel in the Western United States, producing 2 million
tons annually.</LD>

<LD>I cried after reading David Wharton's "Saving Anthony" (Aug. 4).
Having taught high school English for 30 years, I have known many
"Anthonys," one of whom told me as I passed by his desk one day that
I was the only honest adult in his life. I could go on with the
stories, but if Wharton's is true, I hope he will continue his good
work with other "Anthonys." There are so many kids out there, even
from good, affluent families, who, like Anthony, may not let you know
it at the time but who glow inside and grow because a caring adult
came into their lives.</LD>

<LD>How moving to read of Jack Sheldon's lasting dedication to his music
("Last of the Hepcats," by Steve Lopez, July 28). Lopez's account
perfectly captured Sheldon's inspiring endurance--from his big band
and television career to his current happiness. Still taking horn
lessons and now appearing in a "burger and beer joint" in Glendale!
What a fine tribute to a real artist. Sheldon shows us how the joy of
artistic expression can, if honored, last a lifetime.</LD>

<BD>Matthew Heller last wrote for the magazine about
environmental activist Julia Butterfly Hill.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't much of a tip, certainly not much to justify a 1,400-mile
round trip to California's most remote prison. The letter, written by
Pedro ''Pete'' Zuniga in almost microscopic print, said something
about ''numerous of issues'' and alluded to an Oxnard gang member
convicted of drive-by shootings. ''Remember Chava,'' it said, using
the gang member's street name. ''This time way bigger than that was .
. . it will be worth your while.''</LD>
<LD>   The writer was another member of the Colonia Chiques gang, and
Oxnard Police Det. Dennis McMaster had used him as an informant in a
few cases. And for McMaster, Ventura County's best known gang
investigator at the time, any lead was worth following-even if it
meant going all the way to Pelican Bay State Prison in the northwest
corner of California.</LD>
<LD>   So there McMaster was on a summer day in 1999, cloistered in a
small office with Zuniga as prison guards hovered outside. The
interview only lasted about 10 minutes and, McMaster would later
recall, ''It was borderline ridiculous.'' Zuniga-concerned that the
room was wired or the guards would snitch on him to other
inmates-added little information to what he'd put in his letter. He
scribbled several answers on scraps of paper, which he then retrieved
from McMaster and swallowed.</LD>
<TE>   What the detective did manage to glean involved a murder in Santa
Barbara for which Zuniga's cellmate, Efren Cruz, had been convicted
in December 1997. McMaster had testified at Cruz's trial as the
prosecution's expert witness on Oxnard street gangs. According to
Zuniga, it was not Cruz who had fired a gun in a downtown parking
lot, killing one man and wounding another; it was Gerardo ''Big
Gera'' Reyes, Cruz's cousin and a Colonia Chiques member with a
reputation for violence.</TE>
<TE>   Zuniga had come to his conclusion after many conversations in his
tiny cell with Cruz. Of course, convicts protesting their innocence
are about as rare in prison as gang tattoos. But Zuniga knew both
Cruz and Reyes from the Oxnard streets-and which one of them might be
capable of shooting someone in cold blood. ''He knew that type of act
was more [like] Gerardo Reyes,'' McMaster says.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called Lot 10 case wasn't in McMaster's jurisdiction, and
it wasn't as if Oxnard didn't have plenty of its own crimes to solve.
But he believed Zuniga was reliable and he knew Reyes' history. Based
on his familiarity with Reyes, McMaster had told Santa Barbara police
within hours of the gunfire that Reyes was the likely shooter. He
wasn't the sort of cop to just let this go.</TE>
<TE>   ''You have to go home and sleep every night knowing that
potentially there's a guy in jail that shouldn't be there and you're
not doing anything about it,'' McMaster explains. ''You have to do
what you have to do.''</TE>
<TE>   During the investigation, McMaster worked his contacts in the gang
underworld for corroboration of Zuniga's claims, picking up nuggets
of information from people who normally keep their distance from
cops. ''A lot of them don't have phone numbers,'' he says. ''And you
can't just go to their house and knock on the door.'' After pulling a
regular nine-hour shift working Oxnard cases, he would put in another
couple of hours on the Cruz case. He made another grueling road trip
to Pelican Bay, sometimes stopping to recline in the back seat to
rest his aching back. For months, he negotiated with prison system
officials in a futile effort to get Zuniga transferred to Ventura
County.</TE>
<TE>   McMaster's doggedness eventually had some remarkable
consequences-Reyes' secretly recorded confession to the Lot 10
shootings; a court hearing that pitted Santa Barbara authorities
against their neighboring Ventura counterparts, including McMaster; a
ruling by a Santa Barbara judge that Cruz was wrongfully convicted,
and, ultimately, Cruz's release from Pelican Bay after nearly four
years in prison. The case was McMaster's swan song. After a year on
disability, he retired in March because of back and neck injuries
sustained in an on-duty traffic accident. Cruz, now 28, is suing
Santa Barbara police and prosecutors for violating his civil rights,
alleging in part that they ignored McMaster's early opinion
implicating Reyes. So McMaster and Santa Barbara law enforcement may
meet again in the federal civil courts.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most remarkable of all is what McMaster may have done for
his much-maligned profession at a time when police scandals have
become almost routine, each one adding to public cynicism toward law
enforcement. Cops shoot and frame gang members on the mean streets of
LAPD's Rampart Division; cops moonlight as bodyguards for rappers;
cops rape prostitutes and sodomize suspects with broom handles. The
dust hasn't yet settled from that violent, videotaped arrest in
Inglewood this summer, but the stain is undeniable. The rogue cop
character is a staple of Hollywood, from ''Dirty Harry'' and ''L.A.
Confidential'' to ''NYPD Blue'' and ''The Practice.''</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement colleagues see McMaster as an antidote to all of
the cynicism. ''With the Rampart scandal and everything else out
there,'' says Ventura County gang crime prosecutor Bill Haney,
''people need to know there are guys like Dennis trying to do the
best they can.''</TE>
<TE>   McMaster would prefer that people not know about him. ''If you
heard about me being modest, it's true,'' the 43-year-old former cop
says during an interview at an Oxnard restaurant a few weeks after
Cruz's release. The Cruz investigation was ''just doing good police
work. This is what the public pays us to do.''</TE>
<TE>   McMaster shows up for the interview in a maroon T-shirt and jeans.
With his tall, burly build, shaved head, walrus mustache and
close-set eyes, he has an intimidating presence. But there's
something reassuring and rock-solid about him, a soft-spoken,
''just-the-facts'' straightforwardness that perhaps explains why even
hard-core gang members such as Pete Zuniga would trust him. ''He's
just an honorable man,'' says Haney. ''You know where you stand with
him.''</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement, moreover, wasn't just a job to him. ''It [was]
his whole life,'' says Len Newcomb, a former Oxnard police officer
who now works as a private investigator. McMaster won't discuss his
private life, but colleagues say he is single and devotes whatever
spare time he has to an auto repair shop he owns. Although Oxnard has
a population of more than 170,000, he operated like a small-town cop,
even helping some gang members find jobs. ''There've been cases where
I have referred people'' to employers, he says.</TE>
<TE>   McMaster worked for the police department as an Explorer while
still attending Channel Islands High School in Oxnard. He made police
cadet before becoming a full-time officer in 1980. ''I enjoyed the
work,'' he says. ''That was basically it.'' He brought some bedrock
values to the job, although he is typically vague about where they
came from. ''Maybe I was taught that right is right and wrong is
wrong.''</TE>
<TE>   Phillip Dunn, an attorney for Cruz, was a deputy public defender
in Ventura when McMaster was a young patrol officer. He remembers him
as gung-ho, to say the least. ''We used to call him 'Supercop' and
'Batman,' '' he says. ''He'd pull people over for the most trivial
violations.''</TE>
<TE>   Some defense lawyers ''did not like him.'' They thought ''he was
out of control.'' But McMaster's arrests stood up in court because he
didn't cross any legal lines. ''The bottom line was I could never
catch him in a lie,'' Dunn says. ''He doesn't break the rules.'' For
his first assignment as a detective, McMaster worked narcotics. Then,
as Oxnard beefed up its anti-gang enforcement, he joined a newly
created unit in 1995. By that time, the gritty coastal city was home
to eight mostly Latino gangs-the largest, with 1,200 documented
members, being the Colonia Chiques. ''Colonia'' refers to Colonia
Road, which runs through the gang's territory on Oxnard's east side;
''Chiques'' refers to a slang name for Oxnard. ''They are without a
doubt the most violent gang in the area,'' Haney says.</TE>
<TE>   With McMaster and his partner, Trent Jewell, on the gang beat,
conviction rates ''soared,'' according to Haney. McMaster tracked
gang members like a hawk, jotting down their vehicle license plates
in his notebooks. Once sheriff's investigators came to him for help
in solving a drive-by shooting in Camarillo. All they had was a
partial license plate and a description of the vehicle used by the
gunman. McMaster identified the plate as that on a vehicle belonging
to Oxnard gang members. Sure enough, the car matched the description,
giving investigators the evidence they needed to make arrests.</TE>
<TE>   McMaster also assiduously cultivated informants. ''You have to
have people on the street telling you what's going on,'' he says.
''Chava,'' also known as Salvador Carrillo, was arrested for several
''ride-by'' shootings committed on a bicycle after McMaster received
a tip from Pete Zuniga.</TE>
<TE>   The detective believes even hardened gang members such as Zuniga
have a moral code, that they do not always fit the stereotype of
police-hating outlaws. ''A lot of them do want to do the right
thing,'' he explains. ''They realize there are people on the street
that need to be stopped.''</TE>
<TE>   Informants who committed a crime might get a break in return for
their cooperation. But when Zuniga helped commit a home-invasion
robbery in 1996, McMaster was there to bust him. ''That was a serious
felony,'' he says. ''He crossed the line.'' Zuniga was sentenced to
11 years in prison, and the informant apparently bore no hard
feelings. ''They can respect you for that.''</TE>
<TE>   Gang violence in Oxnard isn't quite up to Los Angeles levels. ''We
don't have the type of gang members who are out there shooting every
weekend,'' McMaster says. One whom he did have his eye on was Gerardo
Reyes, a Colonia member known for his large stature and as a suspect
in five gun-related incidents between January and June 1995,
according to court documents. In one case, he allegedly shot and
wounded a guest in the face at a graduation party. But McMaster could
never make a case against Reyes-in part, he says, because witnesses
were too afraid of the Colonia member to testify.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 25, 1997, Reyes got together with several other Colonia
members for a Saturday night outing to Santa Barbara. Also along for
the ride was a cousin of Reyes who had recently enrolled at Oxnard
College after being honorably discharged from the Army. Efren Cruz
was not known as a gang member or a troublemaker. He'd never crossed
McMaster's radar screen. But that night, according to Santa Barbara
police, he turned into a cold-blooded killer.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble started soon after midnight in a bar on State Street,
downtown Santa Barbara's main drag and a mecca for tourists and
revelers. The Oxnard group, about 10 in all, exchanged words with a
smaller crowd of local men at the Hurricane Club. Bouncers intervened
promptly, escorting the out-of-towners out the front door and the
others out the back.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes and his friends had parked next door to the club in the
multilevel Lot 10. So, unfortunately, had the Santa Barbara group.
They confronted each other again on the ground level. Taunts and gang
signs flew. Then about six shots rang out. Michael Torres, a
23-year-old Santa Barbara resident, was fatally wounded in the head;
his friend, James Miranda, 21, took a bullet to the neck. After
delivering a few kicks to the victims, the Oxnard group scattered.</TE>
<TE>   Police responded almost immediately. They found Cruz wandering the
ground level in an apparent daze. He was the only suspect arrested at
the scene, Reyes and his friends having made their getaways. On the
second floor, officers found the murder weapon, a chrome .38-caliber
revolver.</TE>
<TE>   Almost a year earlier, a suspected Ventura gang member had wounded
four pedestrians during a drive-by shooting east of downtown Santa
Barbara. At the time, police described it as one of the worst gang
incidents in the city's history. What happened in Lot 10-a fatal
gang-related shooting in a public parking garage just off the tourist
strip-could hardly have been a more brazen attack. Santa Barbara
police, who knew Cruz was from Oxnard and had some experience with
Oxnard gang members, were soon heading down the coast to round up
additional suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Several detectives spent time that Sunday with Dennis McMaster at
the Oxnard police station. They brought with them a grainy
black-and-white surveillance camera videotape recorded before the
shooting outside the Hurricane Club. Viewing the tape, which showed
patrons entering the club, McMaster recognized Leo Gonzales, Gerardo
''Little Gera'' Palencia, Ramiro Reyes and Big Gera.''</TE>
<TE>   Listen, this guy's got to be the shooter,'' McMaster said,
pointing out Big Gera.</TE>
<TE>   He asked the detectives if a revolver had been used because, as he
stated later in a court document, ''my knowledge of Gerardo [Reyes]
was that he favored revolvers.'' He also told them about Reyes'
alleged history, including the graduation party shooting. The Santa
Barbara officers weren't interested, however. ''We've already got the
shooter in custody,'' one of them said.</TE>
<TE>   ''That kind of shut me up,'' McMaster says. ''I wasn't going to
argue. I had no knowledge of the case.''</TE>
<TE>   By the time of a preliminary hearing, Cruz and three alleged
accomplices-Gonzales, Palencia and Gerardo Reyes-were facing murder
charges. Ramiro Reyes, who is not related to Gerardo, was a fugitive.
Judge Joseph L. Lodge endorsed the prosecution's theory that Cruz was
the shooter and also bound Gonzales over for trial. The prosecution's
key evidence included gunshot residue found on Cruz's hands at the
time of his arrest and the testimony of Kenneth Freese, a motorist
who was heading out of Lot 10 when Torres was shot and who identified
Cruz as the shooter from the Hurricane surveillance tape.</TE>
<TE>   But Lodge couldn't find sufficient evidence to hold Palencia and
Big Gera, forcing the prosecution to dismiss the charges against
them. Gonzales would later plead guilty to being an accessory after
the fact and get credit for time served in jail; after being arrested
in New Mexico, Ramiro Reyes would be convicted of assault and spend a
couple of years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara Dist. Atty. Tom Sneddon had assigned one of his most
experienced and aggressive deputies, Hilary Dozer, to the Lot 10
case. At Cruz's trial, which began in October 1997, Dozer argued that
Cruz had killed Michael Torres to enhance his standing in the Colonia
Chiques. Dozer turned to McMaster as his gang expert, and McMaster
provided the jury with a primer on the Colonia Chiques. From
photographs introduced as exhibits, McMaster concluded on the witness
stand that Cruz at least was an associate of the gang. In one
photograph, he appeared to throw a ''C'' sign and wore a Dallas
Cowboys shirt, which was favored Colonia Chiques clothing.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 1, 1997, Cruz was convicted of second-degree murder and
attempted murder. Judge Frank J. Ochoa sentenced him to 41 years to
life in prison. ''This crime is senseless, disgusting and it speaks
to the worst,'' he said. Back in Oxnard, McMaster had no reason to
think he would have anything more to do with the Lot 10 case.</TE>
<TE>   McMaster leafs through the binder he has brought to the interview.
From it, he produces a copy of Pete Zuniga's letter, the words
crammed onto a lined piece of paper. This is the letter that landed
on McMaster's desk in June 1999 and plunged him back into the Lot 10
case. ''Long time no see,'' Zuniga wrote from Pelican Bay. ''I've
grown up a lot. I'm not the little boy that you knew.''</TE>
<TE>   For two hours, McMaster talks freely about his Lot 10
investigation. He knows almost every twist and detail. He is in his
element, focused on the police work and techniques that clearly
fascinate him. He tries to avoid overt criticism of Santa Barbara law
enforcement and their very different view of the evidence. But his
frustration still comes through. ''This could have come together
nicely,'' he says. ''It came together, but not nicely. It was kind of
ugly.''</TE>
<TE>   Zuniga's letter came to McMaster via an aunt of Efren Cruz. Cruz
and his family, who were still hoping to prove his innocence, didn't
expect much of McMaster-after all, he had testified at trial for the
prosecution. They also knew his reputation as one of Oxnard's
toughest cops. But that apparently didn't matter to Zuniga. ''He felt
comfortable going to him,'' Cruz says. McMaster's brief meeting with
Zuniga at Pelican Bay in 1999 was so tense that Zuniga communicated
much of the time with hand movements. But, McMaster says, ''I had no
reason to not believe him.'' Zuniga indicated that he would expect
some time off his sentence in return for his cooperation. A few days
later, McMaster relayed Zuniga's tip about Gerardo Reyes to Dozer
during a work-related visit to Santa Barbara's Fiesta weekend. He
also told Dozer that Zuniga was willing to wear a body wire and
elicit a confession from Reyes. ''I left very optimistic,'' McMaster
says.</TE>
<TE>   McMaster thought he could simply assist a Santa Barbara
investigation by acting as a liaison to Zuniga. But at a meeting in
Oxnard on Aug. 26, 1999, he claims he got a chilly response from
Dozer and three other Santa Barbara law enforcement officials, who
suggested to his dismay that Zuniga had gotten together with Reyes
and Cruz as part of a conspiracy to free Cruz. ''I felt [I was]
fighting a losing battle,'' he says. Citing Cruz's pending civil
suit, Dozer declined to comment for this article. In earlier comments
to a reporter, he said that McMaster's information was ''very limited
. . . He had nothing other than he had used Zuniga in the past as an
informant.''</TE>
<TE>   At this point, McMaster could have backed out. Technically it was
Santa Barbara's case, and he didn't want to ruffle any political
feathers. But he had the support of his supervisors and Ventura
Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Bill Haney. And he just couldn't rid
himself of the thought that an innocent man could be ''sitting in one
of the worst prisons in California,'' exposed every day to danger.</TE>
<TE>   Still, McMaster faced the problem of getting Zuniga into the same
room as Reyes. The inmate's transfer from Pelican Bay to Ventura
County Jail ran into red tape, forcing McMaster to travel to the
prison again to make sure Zuniga, who was nearing his original
release date, still wanted to cooperate. ''He really wanted to do
it,'' McMaster says. ''He didn't want to leave Efren Cruz in there.''</TE>
<TE>   Zuniga's deal may have become a secondary consideration for him,
the motives of the gangbanger having aligned themselves, remarkably
enough, with those of the cop. For Zuniga, too, it was about not
putting an innocent man behind bars for something he didn't do. ''It
offended him that Gerardo Reyes had sold his cousin down the road,''
McMaster says. ''We did kind of mesh on that.''</TE>
<TE>   McMaster left Pelican Bay encouraged. ''I knew at least things
were good on [Zuniga's] side. But I still didn't know what [law
enforcement] was going to do.''In March 2000-nine months after Zuniga
first contacted McMaster-the detective got a break when Reyes was
arrested for a stabbing at an Oxnard restaurant. Now Reyes was in
jail, making it easier to find a pretext to have Zuniga talk to him.
And the more McMaster looked into the case, the more troubled he
became. For one thing, the key eyewitness, Kenneth Freese, had
identified Cruz from the surveillance tape rather than a photographic
lineup, as is customary police practice. The gunshot residue was not
conclusive because anyone within a radius of 15 feet can pick up
residue when a gun is fired. ''Dennis couldn't stay away from it,''
says Det. Trent Jewell, McMaster's former partner. ''He knew the
evidence [to free Cruz] was there.''</TE>
<TE>   Zuniga finally was transferred to Ventura County Jail in May 2000.
After several more delays, Ventura prosecutors agreed to have Zuniga
released from prison within a year of wearing a wire. As long as
Zuniga cooperated by wearing the wire, he would get his deal no
matter what Reyes said. On Aug. 25, 2000, investigators arranged for
Zuniga and Reyes to go to court on the same day. In a courthouse
holding cell, Zuniga got his "homie" to talk about Lot 10, their
every word-much of it gang slang-traveling from Zuniga's wire to a
tape recorder.''</TE>
<TE>   I did it, dog,'' Reyes confessed, explaining that he had tried to
protect Cruz and grabbed the gun from his car. Torres started
yelling. Reyes mimicked the sound of a gun to suggest what happened
next. ''And I just 'bah!' ''</TE>
<TE>   Some 10 months later, the trail Dennis McMaster started following
in Pelican Bay brought him to a Santa Barbara courtroom. Reyes'
confession had provided defense lawyers with evidence for a habeas
corpus petition seeking Cruz's release. A habeas proceeding allows
convicts to go before a judge and present new evidence that they were
wrongfully convicted. Despite Reyes' taped confession, the
prosecutors in the Santa Barbara D.A.'s office still maintained that
Cruz was the Lot 10 shooter. So Cruz's petition came before Judge
Ochoa for a hearing that began in June 2001 and featured both
McMaster and Haney-as witnesses for Cruz. Haney called it a
''twilight-zone experience.''</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing, Dozer's strategy was to discredit the confession,
claiming that Reyes was just shooting his mouth off to bolster his
reputation and that McMaster was not qualified to interpret the
evidence. In March 2001, Reyes told Santa Barbara police that he had
lied to Zuniga to get Cruz released and knew Zuniga was wearing a
wire. But questioned by defense attorney Phillip Dunn, McMaster
insisted it was a ''righteous confession'' and ridiculed the
prosecutor's theories.''</TE>
<TE>   There is no reason at all for [Reyes] to claim that he did this
murder unless he did it,'' McMaster said.</TE>
<TE>   When Dozer asked how Ventura County could give Zuniga a deal based
on a ''cryptic, short discussion'' at Pelican Bay, Haney rose to
McMaster's defense. ''You have to understand,'' he lectured his
fellow prosecutor, ''our information source was Det. Dennis McMaster,
and he's not your average detective.''</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa was as emphatic in his Oct. 12 ruling that reversed Cruz's
convictions. ''[T]here is clearly more than a preponderance of the
substantial credible evidence to prove that Gerardo Reyes, and not
Efren Cruz, was the shooter in Lot 10,'' he wrote. He also singled
out McMaster for praise: ''When a police officer is as eager to
pursue evidence to exonerate the innocent, even post-conviction, as
he is to convict the guilty, we have an example of police conduct we
can, and should, all be proud of.''</TE>
<TE>   When McMaster is reminded of those comments, he shrugs. ''That's
flattering,'' he mumbles. But the kudos don't matter to him. What
does is maintaining the credibility of police work. ''What kind of
credibility do you have for investigating crimes if no one wants to
follow up on [information]?'' he asks. ''That's where gang members
get the idea they can't trust the police. And you've got to get the
right guy in jail. If you don't, he's going to kill again.''</TE>
<TE>   Efren Cruz has moved out of state and is taking college computer
classes. ''There's not enough thank-yous I can tell [McMaster] for
what he did,'' he says. ''He's out there for the truth, even if that
means [showing] there was a mistake made.'' McMaster, understandably,
is having a hard time adjusting to life off the force. ''I've been
doing [police work] for 22 years,'' he says. ''Then all of a sudden
I'm out of the loop.'' While he would prefer ''something that has to
do with investigations,'' he has yet to decide his next career move.</TE>
<TE>   The Lot 10 case, too, is unresolved. Although Ochoa ruled that
Cruz could not be retried since he had determined Cruz was not the
shooter, Santa Barbara prosecutors have appealed that decision. ''We
have no credible evidence that has convinced our office to change our
opinion as to the person who's responsible'' for the Lot 10 murder,
Dozer told a reporter in response to Ochoa's criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Gerardo Reyes, meanwhile, is serving 12 years in prison for the
restaurant assault. Legal experts doubt that the Santa Barbara
district attorney could ever prosecute him for the Lot 10 shooting,
and Dozer acknowledged that his office would be at "a substantial
disadvantage" if it did. ''I would expect defense lawyers to throw
back at us our presentation'' in the habeas hearing, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara authorities still maintain that the gunshot residue
and eyewitness evidence pointed to Cruz as the shooter. But both
forms of evidence are less than unimpeachable. And if Santa Barbara
police had followed McMaster's hunch 51/2 years ago, there would be
less chance of someone possibly getting away with murder.</TE>
<TE>   The loose ends, the lack of resolution, bother McMaster. Back at
the Oxnard restaurant, he sighs and shakes his head. ''I'm frustrated
it turned out the way it did,'' he says. ''I don't think it's right''
that Reyes is not facing charges. But for McMaster, the job is done.
''I did what I could do. I can't do any more.''</TE>

<DH>Sixteen Years After Their Arrival in L.A., the Ahmadi
Brothers Have Transformed Themselves From Penniless Afghan Immigrants
Into International Businessmen. But There's More Than Commerce at
Stake.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FAGER and CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>Chris Fager, an entertainment executive, is an antique
rug collector who teaches a course on Oriental rugs through UCLA
Extension. Corie Brown, a Times staff writer, profiled Barry Diller
for the magazine in March.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A tour of L.A.'s best-known oriental rug gallery offers more than an
opportunity to ogle great works of art-an antique Persian Tabriz, for
example, or a Turkish Oushak. Step inside the Melrose Avenue shop and
you'll get a crash course on cutthroat competition. Hanging between
those $50,000 objects of desire is a brand new rug, woven by Afghan
refugees in Peshawar, Pakistan. Its mix of traditional patterns and
soft, modern colors stands out in a room full of classic carpets. But
don't ask where it came from.</LD>
<LD>   ''It's nobody's business where I get my rugs,'' says the owner of
the Mansour gallery. He won't name names and dismisses his suppliers
''as mostly pickers without enough capital.'' Nonetheless, he has
tried to corner the Los Angeles market for their rugs. And he has
company.</LD>
<TE>   The ''pickers''-brothers Zabi and Zubair Ahmadi-have been selling
their carpets across the country as quickly as they can produce them.
They've even moved into a storefront on Robertson Boulevard, just
around the corner from Mansour. It's a space where dozens of the
Ahmadis' signature rugs-distinguished by a short pile, lustrous wool
and light colors with an antique patina-are stacked against the
walls. ''Sometimes when dealers come by to see our new shop, they
don't believe it's us,'' says Zubair, recalling their days dealing
antique rugs in a low-rent hole in the wall on La Cienega Boulevard.
''They expect to see an older guy here with us.'' At 26, Zubair
shrugs off that the brothers are a generation younger than their
peers. ''They couldn't see that we were capable of this. Some of them
put the word out that we would not make it.'' Almost no one outside
the insular Los Angeles rug world knows about the Ahmadis. They
started out working the edges of the local market as menders and
small-time traders, currying favor with many retailers in L.A.'s prime rug
district--La Cienega Boulevard between Santa Monica Boulevard to the north
and 3rd Street to the south, bounded by Melrose Place to the east and the
Pacific Design Center to the west, with many shops on Melrose and
Robertson.  The brothers rose within this usually impenetrable world
because of their knot-by-knot knowledge of rugs, sidestepping the
deception and aggressive haggling
that can define L.A. rug dealing. Their expertise has enabled them to
build their new rug business and thrive as antique dealers in the
face of big-time competitors-shops such as Mansour, Aga John and
Caravan Rug Corp.-that dominate the rug trade with gigantic
inventories and bank accounts to carry them.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen years after arriving in Los Angeles, the brothers have
transformed themselves from penniless Afghan immigrants into
international businessmen who have manufactured carpets in Pakistan
and, now, in Afghanistan. But they have more than a business at
stake. They dream of reclaiming a heritage.</TE>
<TE>   With dozens of world-class shops, Los Angeles is arguably the
world's third-largest market for antique decorative rugs, behind New
York and London. The local business was once the province of Armenian
dealers until the influx of Persians into L.A. before the 1979
Iranian revolution. Now Persian businessmen dominate the market. On
busy days at large emporiums such as Caravan on Wilshire near
Robertson or Aga John in the Pacific Design Center, where new carpets
are priced by the square foot, the shops look more like freight yards
than galleries. Laborers scurry around with dollies amid the
overpowering smell and dust from the wool, turning over stack after
stack of big rugs for designers and hauling them off in vans for
''tryouts.'' The L.A. rug market, dealers say, is driven by interior
designers who want only the pattern du jour. Carpets are selected
more for their color and size-''fabric for the floor'' that can be
changed like drapes, says one designer-and less for authenticity or
quality. Pricing policies are fuzzy; in fact, at mid-size and smaller
retail shops, the carpets rarely carry price tags. Retail customers
in these smaller stores often hear, ''Tell me what you are looking
for because I have many more carpets in the warehouse.'' This is L.A.
''rug-speak'' for the backdoor networking that dealers do among
themselves, sharing the profits as rugs are shifted from shop to shop
in search of buyers.</TE>
<TE>   But dealers have been known to fight over customers as well. One
L.A. shopper looking for a particular size and color left a store on
Robertson only to be followed by the dealer to another stop on La
Cienega. There the two dealers argued in Farsi over who ''owned'' the
customer. In some cases, such routine arguments have festered into
bitter rivalries. Rumor has it that competition in a few cases became
so intense that there were threats of violence by one dealer against
another.</TE>
<TE>   Zabi and Zubair Ahmadi first learned about rugs at their
grandfather's carpet factory, which opened in Kabul in 1919. At its
peak in the early 1980s, the factory employed more than 100 workers
who manned 50 looms to create silk rugs for the European market. All
of the Ahmadi children grew up weaving. ''We made a copy of the
Pazyryk carpet [the oldest surviving knotted pile carpet on record,
dating from 300 to 500 BC] when we were kids,'' says Zubair-a
challenge for adults, let alone children.</TE>
<TE>   When the Ahmadi family left Afghanistan 19 years ago, patriarch
Ghulam Ahmadi knew nothing about L.A.' s rug market or that he would
bring his family here. His only concern was getting his 10 children,
ages 5 to 20, away from the Soviet soldiers who were occupying their
country. He joined a group of about 100 other refugees heading for
the Pakistani border. ''The government wanted all people to become
Communists,'' says Ghulam, 66, then a high-ranking government
agricultural scientist who had studied in Texas and maintained his
American contacts. ''I did not agree, and I saw that if I didn't
leave I would be in jail. ''We could not take anything, not even
scraps of paper in our pockets, because they would arrest anyone they
thought was leaving.'' Except for a few photographs saved by an aunt
who stayed behind, the family has little by which to remember their
comfortable life in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   The journey to the Pakistani border, usually a day's drive from
Kabul, took about three weeks. The night they grew close to the
border, battle flares lighted the night sky and the ground shook as
Soviet helicopter gunships fired rockets nearby. Hearing the
explosions, the Ahmadis fled their truck. Their driver, moving
without lights on a bright, moonlit night, hid the vehicle in a
ditch. The next morning the family learned that two truckloads of
families ahead of them had been killed. Once in Pakistan, with the
family jammed into a small apartment in sweltering Islamabad, the
Ahmadis survived as rug menders, accepting repair jobs from local
merchants. For Zabi, now 30, it was the end of childhood. ''There was
no school for us,'' he says. ''There was nothing else for us to do.''
Two years later, in 1986, the family arrived in the San Fernando
Valley with only $500.</TE>
<TE>   Zabi felt like an outsider in school and found a place to belong
alongside his cousins Ahmad and Alex Ahmadi, repairing rugs and later
working part time at their rug shop on La Cienega. As his cousins
rose in prominence, Zabi learned about antiques and the Los Angeles
rug world while doing mostly menial chores. The cousins now operate a
high-end shop, Ariana Rugs on Melrose Place, where two other
prominent stores are located: the Raymond Benardout Gallery, operated
by L.A.'s most celebrated antique rug and textile dealer, and J.
Iloulian Rugs. Zabi eventually wanted his own business as well. After
six years of working in his cousins' store, he and Zubair opened a
one-room shop in 1995 on La Cienega near Santa Monica Boulevard. The
brothers were then 23 and 18. They hung the one rug they owned on the
wall and put the only other rug in their inventory, a repair job, on
the floor.</TE>
<TE>   They made a living repairing and wholesaling antique rugs to L.A.
dealers, living at home with their parents and most of their
siblings. Zabi scoured Santa Barbara, Boston, New York,
Paris-anywhere he could make friends with carpet traders. This
searching for rugs at wholesale prices by ''runners'' or ''pickers''
(Zabi finds the latter term derogatory) is a key part of the
business. Zabi would offer his finds to dealers and the occasional
collector cruising La Cienega. Drawing on their experience as
repairers, the brothers developed a knack for finding and restoring
battered, inexpensive rugs that other dealers thought too damaged to
sell. Over the years, as they sold more carpets to dealers at
wholesale prices, the Ahmadis' open, soft-spoken manner earned them
entrance to the dealers' ''club.'' ''Compared to many people in the
rug business, they are never argumentative or aggressive,'' says
Raymond Benardout. ''And they are absolutely honest.'' But as both
outsiders and small operators, the Ahmadis often found themselves
squeezed by the larger retailers. Dealing exclusively in antiques was
another problem in the designer-driven L.A. market with its
preference for new rugs. To thrive, the Ahmadis needed more rugs-a
steady stream of rugs.</TE>
<TE>   ''When I made my first trip to Pakistan in 1997, I was thinking we
might make new rugs, but I just went to look around,'' says Zabi.
While in the rug market in Peshawar, a bustling rug center created by
the influx of thousands of Afghan refugee weavers, Zabi encountered
one of the men who had helped run his family's rug factory in Kabul.
''I grew up with this guy and I had confidence in him,'' says Zabi.
''When we started talking about making new rugs, he said he would do
it with me.'' That first trip to Pakistan became a monthlong sojourn,
with Zabi buying wool, setting up looms and managing the production
process. The Ahmadi weavers craft their new rugs in the traditional
centuries-old way, using hand-spun wool and mostly natural dyes. They
are part of a revival of carpet weaving abandoned in the late 1800s
and replaced by ''modern'' European methods using machine-spun wool
and chemical dyes. Emmett Eiland, author of ''Oriental Rugs Today: A
Guide to the Best in New Carpets From the East,'' calls the return to
the old ways a ''renaissance.'' Now, in addition to their antique rug
trade, the Ahmadi weavers produce about 600 to 700 square feet of
carpet per month, some 100 pieces ranging in size from 4 feet by 6
feet to 16 feet by 25 feet.</TE>
<TE>   It was difficult running a business in Pakistan, and the brothers
say the turmoil in the region forced them to cut production by 40%.
But the establishment of operations there had a side benefit: In
Peshawar, family friends introduced Zabi to Lina Noori, who, after a
three-year courtship, moved to Los Angeles last year for their
wedding.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Saturday, Zubair Ahmadi warmly greets a local dealer
who has stopped by the shop, now called Amadi Gallery, to see a
shipment of new arrivals. Speaking in Dari, a common language of
Afghanistan, Zubair offers the traditional cup of tea. He is building
a loom for the storefront and shows the dealer skeins of the soft,
hand-spun yarn the brothers use in their carpets. When fully
assembled, and with the weaving of a rug in progress, visitors will
be able to see the exact process of making a knotted pile rug. ''We
are not just dealers. We are weavers,'' Zubair says. ''We were born
in this business. As soon as we were old enough to hold a tool, we
learned to weave.'' Today the brothers' eight siblings, including
Murtaza and Wahid, help in the family enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   With dreams of a stable Afghanistan, the Ahmadi brothers are
finally in the process of moving their production back home-to Kabul.
When the move is complete, their plan is to close the Pakistan
operation. Even though they have spent more of their lives in America
and consider Los Angeles their home, ''Afghanistan is our soil,''
says Zubair. ''We would rather spend our money in Afghanistan than
Pakistan. Imagine if all the business people who left Afghanistan
started doing business there again. We could make a difference.'' In
the meantime, the Ahmadi brothers will continue to face the
challenges of entrepreneurship. In the rug community, day-to-day
gentility prevails despite the tension of competition. Dealers will
frequently visit one another, often without notice. An owner may
greet a rival at the back door with offers of tea sweetened with
sugar cubes-but that's where the sweetness ends. ''One dealer here in
Los Angeles offered to buy everything we produce,'' says Zabi. He
flashes a quick smile. ''He even wanted us to ship the rugs to his
place directly.'' The Ahmadis declined the offer.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nicolai Ouroussoff's "A Core Dilemma" (Aug. 18) failed to mention a
major hurdle to the rebirth of downtown Los Angeles: The north-south
one-way street patterns on the west side of the area. I can't tell
you how many times I have been told that "I won't come back ... it's
too hard to get around."</LD>
<LD>   Just try to get from the 110 Freeway to the Convention Center in a
direct fashion. The city Department of Transportation will cluck that
we have "streetcar-wide streets" and that something has to be done.
However, the solution creates evening traffic jams that madden
drivers and put pedestrians at risk.</LD>

<TE>   Eli Broad deftly and succinctly punctures L.A.'s pretensions of
being a "great" city or even much of a city at that. Absent a
mythical and elusive "vital core" and a transportation system to link
it to outlying areas, L.A. will remain what it is: the biggest small
town in the world.</TE>

<TE>   While I appreciate Nicolai Ouroussoff's examination of the
difficulties faced by those trying to figure out what to do about
downtown, he seems to make the same mistake as a lot of those he
criticizes. A good downtown isn't lively because of buildings, it's
lively because of streets.</TE>
<TE>   I work at 4th and Broadway, at the bottom of Bunker Hill, and go
up to Grand Avenue frequently to visit the museums, theaters and
restaurants. The most obvious difference between the two is that the
street life on Broadway is facilitated by shops open to the broad
sidewalks. Sure, a lot of the merchandise is tacky, but people walk
there, talk there, interact there.</TE>
<TE>   Compare that with what's going on at the top of the hill. The new
cathedral demonstrates the problem--pedestrians brave enough to walk
anywhere walk beside cold, stone walls. Maybe, if they can make it
safely inside, there will be a wonderful experience, as there is at
MOCA, or the Taper, or many of the restaurants. But a city should be
more than discrete experiences separated by car trips.</TE>
<TE>   Until the folks developing downtown L.A. understand how important
street life is, the problems Ouroussoff outlines will continue.</TE>

<TE>   I would love to sell our townhouse in the San Fernando Valley and
buy a loft in the downtown area, and experience the urban culture
that could be a possibility--if only those who are planning actually
plan.</TE>
<TE>   It would be nice to walk to a mass transit depot and ride to my
job as an aerospace quality engineer in the Santa Clarita Valley. But
will there be sufficient mass transit? Will there be any mass
transit? Or do I drive? Oh, wait, I forgot. I live in the city of Los
Angeles, the land of the CMTP (convoluted mass transit plan).</TE>
<TE>   What else prevents me? For one, a planned, viable infrastructure.
Are there plans for a supermarket or a local grocer? A department
store? Will there be doctors and dentists? Museums, architectural
schools, music centers and the planned parks are nice, but they will
not support a community. They are but the frosting.</TE>
<TE>   This "build it and they will come" philosophy has overlooked the
obvious: the everyday needs of the hopeful resident. There is a huge
difference between being developers and being builders of a
community. And you wonder why the secessionist movements thrive?</TE>

<HD>Cher, Reconsidered</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I can well imagine being exasperated at Cher if I were a music critic
("Written Off ... Unfairly?," by Robert Hilburn, Aug. 18). As one of
the masses, however, I have the ability to sit back and take in her
movies, her plays, her TV shows, her celebrity, as well as her music.</LD>
<LD>   I had the pleasure of catching Cher's farewell tour in Oakland,
and she mentioned that although she's giving up the grand arena
spectacles, she will continue to make her "own little records." Her
recent "little record" "not.com.mercial" shows, I think, where Cher's
artistic direction is pointed (have a listen to it, it's at
www.cher.com). It will be exciting to see where Cher's style heads
now that chart-topping is no longer her MO.</LD>
<LD>   It is sad that she is not thought of as a trailblazer. But there's
life in the old girl yet and, as she always does, I'm sure she will
be surprising, unexpected, delightful. And someday, her name will
take pride of place in that pesky hall of fame.</LD>

<TE>   Thanks for the reconsideration of Cher. Those of more recent
vintage may not realize what an influence Sonny and Cher had. While
hall of fame membership is a dubious yardstick (aside from a couple
of good records, what's the real lasting impact of Dion, Del Shannon
or Martha &amp; the Vandellas?), surely Sonny &amp; Cher's mid-'60s output
qualifies them over others who have been inducted. If Dusty
Springfield, then why not Cher?</TE>
<TE>   Too often the hall of fame seems to be open to anyone who ever had
a hit regardless of importance to the development of the music. It
ought to be more than that.</TE>

<LD>Jaime Scholnick's upcoming exhibit at POST gallery, "Hello Kitty Gets
a Mouth," sounds like the most ignorant example of the Ugly Liberal
American going overseas to another country and wagging her
disapproving finger at an unfamiliar culture ("If Kitty Could Talk,
She'd Mouth Off," by Scarlet Cheng, Aug. 18).</LD>
<LD>   It is patronizing and rude of her to suggest that modern Japanese
women do not have any control or self-awareness over their own
existence. The example she cites of the oppression of Japanese women
(the student who is beaten up by her boyfriend) could very well be an
isolated incident that is taken out of context just to suit
Scholnick's agenda. Domestic violence pervades all cultures, not just
Japanese.</LD>
<LD>   Asians in general and Japanese in particular have very few
universally recognized pop-culture icons except for Godzilla or Hello
Kitty. Scholnick's mocking of the Hello Kitty character, and its
popularity within Japanese female culture, is condescendingly racist
toward the very people she is supposedly sympathetic to.</LD>

<LD>Two of L.A.'s prescient bookers--Mitchell Frank (Spaceland, the Echo,
et. al) and Paul McGuigan (formerly of the Troubadour, now with
Goldenvoice)--zero in on hot bands.</LD>
<LD>   Frank</LD>
<LD>   Silversun Pickups. "Indie rock-grunge act with melodies.... I am a
person that enjoys good vocals, interesting melodies, good
performances, good musicianship, and something a little bit off the
beaten path."</LD>
<TE>   Moving Units. "Postmodern punk rock that updates the Factory
Records sound."</TE>
<TE>   Dengue Fever. "They're a different kind of band and performance, I
can't describe it." Cambodian-born Chhom Nimol sings in her native
tongue, and the band reworks jazzy saxophones and droning guitars
into a fresh version of Cambodian pop."</TE>
<TE>   Autolux. "They have been getting very big locally--they sell out
the Troubadour or bigger venues. I don't wanna jinx them; they're
just a great band."</TE>
<TE>   Tyde. "Last year, their record was [among English pop weekly]
NME's top 50 best records, but they got no local play. Some of the
members are in the Beachwood Sparks."</TE>
<TE>   Tape. "They're just edgy and interesting. They are doing our
Monday-night residency in August."</TE>
<TE>   McGuigan</TE>
<TE>   Autolux. "As a band, I think Autolux is really gonna take off.
It's dark rock, a bit like Jesus and Mary Chain, but not as noisy."</TE>
<TE>   The psychobilly scene. "It's mostly bands like Necromantics, from
Denmark. It's a good example of a band that comes over here and gets
a thousand kids that you probably wouldn't see at other kinds of
shows, going out really being part of the subculture, really throwing
themselves in the scene the way people might have done a few years
back with punk. It's still very underground. Those shows take place
in bowling alleys and rented-out spaces, but I see those starting to
come into the mainstream a little more."</TE>
<TE>   The Kinison. "They're a great, great band. There's a whole trend
of post-At the Drive-In bands--kids who were exposed to that rawness
and energy in music. It's almost the way punk rock was, say, in the
'70s, when it kind of inspired people to pick up instruments. At the
Drive-In inspired a lot of kids, and now that they are gone, there is
a slew of bands trying to fill that gap."</TE>

<HD>Oil Runs Deep in U.S. Stance on Iraq</HD>

<LD>Oil plays a role in the U.S. determination to end Saddam Hussein's
rule in Iraq--a role that goes far beyond the concerns that convulsed
commodity markets last week.</LD>
<LD>   The price of crude oil rose to more than $30 a barrel last week, a
very high level, because of financial market concerns about a
possible U.S. invasion of Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Prices fell back by Friday after President Bush threw cold water
on the idea of an imminent invasion, even though he clearly indicated
that a "regime change" in Iraq was what his administration wants.
It's "in the interests of the world," Bush said.</LD>
<TE>   Oil is one reason for wanting to displace the Iraqi regime,
although the more important reason is the need for political and
economic reform in the Middle East. But oil is part of that equation.</TE>
<TE>   Bluntly put, the world will need Iraq's oil as the solution to a
looming energy shortage. Iraq has the second-largest oil reserves in
the world--after Saudi Arabia-- and many experts put its potential as
equal to that of the Saudi kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   Yet because of a decade of sanctions and rules, OPEC member Iraq
is producing far below its capacity and even below its
2-million-barrels-a-day production rate of recent years.</TE>
<TE>   That's why oil prices are unusually high, even without the "war
premium" of $4 to $5 a barrel that nervous markets added on last
week. These current high prices haven't yet shown up at gasoline
pumps in the United States, but they will over the next six weeks,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Persistent high oil prices, despite slow economic growth around
the world, "tells me that oil is in tighter supply than most people
believe," says Mark Raskir, an energy fund portfolio manager for
Milwaukee-based Strong Financial Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, because of sanctions against Iraq that cut development of
new wells, and continued growth of oil consumption in Asia and
elsewhere, OPEC countries' surplus of production capacity is down to
2 million barrels a day, from a surplus of 5 million barrels a day at
the time of the Persian Gulf War 11 years ago, estimates Amy Jaffe in
studies done for the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy
at Rice University.</TE>
<TE>   A smaller surplus makes for nervous markets, with traders pushing
up prices at any hint of disruption of supplies. The International
Energy Agency, the Paris-based organization of petroleum-consuming
countries, Thursday requested that OPEC raise its production quotas
next month as a way of easing tensions in the markets.</TE>
<TE>   Accelerating economic development in China, India, Russia and
Central Asia will surely strain the capacity of OPEC and other
oil-producing nations, which already have little spare capacity, say
the Baker Institute studies. New oil development in Central Asia and
Russia itself would not be enough to alleviate a potential
shortage--and oil from those regions is projected to be very
high-cost compared with the oil of Iraq, Saudi Arabia and other
Middle Eastern countries.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's reserves total 112 billion barrels, compared with Saudi
Arabia's 262 billion, and experts agree that more reserves remain to
be discovered in both countries. But development of Iraq's oil
potential is impossible while Saddam's regime, with its threats and
weapons of mass destruction, remains in power, Washington experts
say. A new Iraqi regime would launch aggressive development and use
oil revenue to pay for the country's rebuilding, says Patrick
Clawson, deputy director of the Washington Institute for Near East
Policy, a research organization.</TE>
<TE>   Factors Complicating the Oil Situation</TE>
<TE>   Two factors are complicating the oil situation and the outlook for
the Middle East. One is an increasingly public quarrel between the
United States and Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, a high-level Defense Department advisory panel
heard a report from a Rand Corp. analyst calling Saudi Arabia "the
most dangerous opponent" in the Middle East. And Saudi private
investors were reported last week to have shifted $100 billion in
investments out of the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   However, Treasury securities traders at Payden &amp; Rygel in Los
Angeles and other firms discount the investment reports because no
evidence of such massive shifts have shown up in the bond markets. At
the end of the week, Saudi officials took pains to say that their
country would hike oil production to prevent any supply disruption if
the U.S. attacked Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The other factor that will continue to affect prices for oil is
that oil companies in general, and particularly independent refining
companies such as Valero Energy Corp., Tesoro Petroleum Corp.,
Premcor Inc., are holding low inventories of oil these days. They are
doing so because credit is less available to energy companies in the
wake of Enron Corp.'s collapse and the widespread troubles of other
energy firms, and because oil prices are volatile and refining profit
margins thin. What that means for consumers, analysts say, is that
gasoline, heating oil and jet fuel prices will go up.</TE>
<TE>   What lies ahead? Oil probably will be in relatively short supply
no matter what happens. Energy economist Philip Verleger warns
against counting on significant additional supplies from a future
Iraq. After Iran's wells were shut by sanctions in the 1980s, "they
never came back to previous production levels," Verleger notes. Iran
produces 3.4 million barrels a day, down from 5 million barrels a day
historically.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook Depends on Mideast Peace</TE>
<TE>   But all economic projections hinge on the emergence of a peaceful
and progressive Middle East. Dangers are obvious, experts note.
Saddam, reacting to invasion or moves to oust him, could destroy
Iraqi oil fields as he did a decade ago when he set fire to Kuwait's
fields.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the replacement of Saddam's regime would spur
development of Iraq, a country with a large middle class and an
educated population that--with U.S. help--could reform its country
and benefit the whole region.</TE>

<HD>Give Students a Crash Course in Personal Finance Before
College</HD>
<DH>Debt: Lessons in money management learned early can save
parents and children from headaches later.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA STERN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's back-to-campus time and, chances are, your student has a
complicated financial life, little experience managing money and not
enough of the actual green stuff.</LD>
<LD>   The typical student juggles a college loan, a checking account, a
savings account, a credit card, an ATM card, a debit card, a prepaid
phone card and a stored-value student identification card, according
to a survey by Student Monitor, a Ridgewood, N.J., research firm.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, students might not have experience paying bills
or covering their living expenses, especially on tight budgets.</LD>
<TE>   It's easy to mess up.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, college students generally do a better job managing
money than they are given credit for.</TE>
<TE>   Most--three of five--pay off their credit cards monthly. Most
carry just one credit card and work at part-time jobs during the
school year or breaks, according to the Student Monitor survey.</TE>
<TE>   But they could do better.</TE>
<TE>   The survey found that 81% of students think they are the first of
their friends to buy new products. Only 30% like to buy things when
they are on sale, and most admit to impulse buying.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some tips for campus-bound money managers.</TE>
<TE>   * Get one credit card. . It's hard to book plane tickets, shop
online or do much of anything in this society without a credit card
and a decent credit rating. One card, in the student's name, with a
moderate limit of $500 gives a student the space to learn how to
manage plastic. More than one card gives new card users the
opportunity to get into more debt than they can get out of easily,
and also sets them up to juggle one card against the other.</TE>
<TE>   One card, offered by the College Parents of America
(www.collegeparents.org), gives parents oversight of their child's
account. That might be good for students who already have proved they
need help learning to handle credit, but it does compromise their
independence a bit.</TE>
<TE>   Parents who want to give their children more room should remind
them that a credit card is more properly viewed as a convenience, not
as a loan.</TE>
<TE>   * Learn to balance a checkbook. Develop the habit of entering
withdrawals while standing at the ATM machine waiting for your cash.</TE>
<TE>   * Beware the debit and stored-value cards. They're convenient, but
if lose them, you've lost a lot. For the most part, stored-value
cards such as gift cards are not replaceable. Besides, small amounts
of money left on the card aren't always usable.</TE>
<TE>   If you lose a debit card linked to your checking account, you'll
eventually be protected from loss. But a thief could empty your
account before you straighten it all out.</TE>
<TE>   * Keep track of spending. The average student goes through $200 a
month in discretionary spending. All the tried-and-true money saving
tips work: Read library books, rent movies with groups of friends,
buy a few clothing items you really love instead of lots of items
that will clog the dorm room or apartment.</TE>
<TE>   * Put less on your campus food account than you think you'll need.
Most students underuse their dining hall budget and overuse the pizza
and wings joint down the street. Be realistic about what you'll
really eat on campus and don't pay for more.</TE>
<TE>   If you live in an apartment, cook. Big meals with friends are fun
and far less costly than the convenience store snacks that are the
biggest drain on most student budgets.</TE>
<TE>   * Shop for travel deals. One of the best opportunities students
have for saving money is on the trips back and forth to visit family
or to sultrier climes for spring break. With those speedy campus
Internet connections, it shouldn't be hard to find good deals on
flights. Know your calendar so you can book busy times early, when
sale fares might apply.</TE>
<TE>   * Share. Come home at Thanksgiving and trade sweaters with your
high school friends. Share a grill or a vacuum cleaner with friends
in nearby apartments. Sell back or pass along textbooks you're done
with.</TE>
<TE>   * Take advantage of that student ID. Go see everything, and give
yourself credit for the bargains you're snagging. It will be 40 more
years before you get discounts for plays, concerts, sporting events
and more because of your age.</TE>
<TE>   * Invest. Given the current state of the market, the
twentysomething who manages to stash some money in stock mutual funds
right now will look absolutely brilliant in 10 years, when the kids
and house down payments start coming along. Parents who can afford to
should match their child's salary in a Roth IRA account every year.</TE>

<LD>So the pizza companies want to raise prices at the risk of losing

<LD>   I will make a deal with Domino's, Papa John's, Pizza Hut and all
others: You raise your rates by calling it a delivery charge and I
will be more than happy to stop buying pizza.</LD>
<LD>   It also has another advantage: I lose weight. So go right ahead

<DL></DL>
<LD>My initial reaction to "Planet Hollywood Made Insider Deals" [Aug.
14] was that Planet Hollywood ran a pretty slick Ponzi scheme because
they intimated that they would allow us access to the rarified air of
fame by way of Lucite-enclosed props and clothing that were somehow
given iconic status simply by virtue of actually having had physical
contact with a celebrity's skin.</LD>
<LD>   Then I realized that I was being unfair: This was no Ponzi scheme.
This was a business that saw the obvious and sold stock in the notion
that it could get rich by selling awful, overpriced food and feeding
society's bizarre and insatiable hunger for all things celebrity for
the price of an awful hamburger and an overpriced T-shirt.</LD>
<LD>   Investors counted on our culture's obsession with fame and
celebrity. And it was their own greed that bought the stock.</LD>
<TE>   Stockholders, stop whining. You threw huge amounts of money at
people who know that some of us have a sick need to be in the
presence of fame and celebrity, even though separated by thin
plexiglass.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing that the stockholders got was the shaft.</TE>

<HD>Tapping IRA Spigot Early Can Endanger Retirement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I am a tax preparer and have a 40-year-old client who, four
years ago, needed money because of a layoff and burnout from the
corporate world. She began taking substantially equal distributions
from her individual retirement account. By following IRS guidelines
that base the withdrawals on her life expectancy, she has been able
to tap her IRA without paying penalties, although she still owes
income taxes on the withdrawal.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is that the value of her account has decreased so much
that it's possible she will deplete the account much sooner than we
expected. I have researched this subject at great length and cannot
get a definitive answer as to what her options are. Can you help?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: It's possible your client can benefit somewhat from new
Internal Revenue Service guidelines that have changed the way most
IRA distributions are figured. But first the two of you need to take
a hard look at this woman's portfolio.</LD>
<TE>   She's obviously heavily invested in stocks, which usually makes
sense, given her age. Once she started withdrawing money from her
IRA, however, and depending on it for her living expenses, she should
have radically shifted her asset allocation away from stocks and into
bonds and cash. In essence, she was converting herself from a young
wage earner, with decades ahead to save for retirement and ride out
market swings, to a retiree who should have been most concerned about
preserving principal.</TE>
<TE>   The problem here is that to preserve principal, she must give up
much potential for future growth, and she's way too young to do so.
Even if she manages to scrape by without entirely depleting her
retirement funds, she won't have much left when she hits real
retirement age. This is yet another reason that tapping retirement
funds early is such a bad idea.</TE>
<TE>   And as you know, she's pretty much stuck with a bad plan. Now that
she's started taking substantially equal distributions from her IRA,
she's required to continue doing so until age 59 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   She might be able to reduce the amount somewhat by using the new
IRS life expectancy tables, which permit smaller future payouts,
according to retirement tax expert Nicholas Kaster.</TE>
<TE>   Although the IRS hasn't given definitive instructions, Kaster, who
works for the tax research firm CCH Inc., has studied the new
regulations and believes they allow taxpayers to satisfy the
substantially equal periodic payment requirements by using the new
mortality tables.</TE>
<TE>   Once you've figured out her new withdrawal amounts and have
suggested she reposition her investments, you might encourage her get
over her burnout and get a job. She's going to need to set aside a
sizable amount of money on her own to overcome the damage she's
already done, and will continue to do, to her retirement funds.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes Rollovers</TE>
<TE>   Are Not the Best Plan</TE>
<TE>   Q: My husband and I each have three 401(k) accounts from current
and past jobs. I have thought about rolling them over into one
account, but I'm not sure whether the entire amount or only the
vested portions would roll over. We are not yet fully vested in any
of the accounts. When you roll over a 401(k), does the full amount
get transferred, or only the vested portion?</TE>
<TE>   A: Unless your previous employers were somehow related to your
current ones, you probably stopped vesting the minute you left those
old jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Vesting is the process in which you gradually become eligible for
the money your company contributes to your 401(k). Though you always
are fully vested in your own contributions and can access them when
you leave a job, it generally takes five to seven years to become
fully vested in an employer's contributions. Vesting can continue if
you leave one arm of a corporation for another but typically stops if
you leave your employer entirely.</TE>
<TE>   You can always roll old 401(k) accounts into IRAs or into a new
employer's plan if the employer accepts such rollovers. It's
generally a good idea to consolidate those old accounts, because you
can simplify your life and keep better track of your investments at
the same time.</TE>
<TE>   If you roll over your 401(k) into an individual retirement account
at a brokerage, you'll have more investment choices. But your account
may be more vulnerable if you should get sued or declare bankruptcy.
Though 401(k)s are protected from creditors, IRAs may not be--it
depends on your state's laws. That's why it may be best to leave your
401(k) where it is, unless your investment choices in the plan are
truly awful.</TE>
<TE>   You can't combine your accounts with your husband's, however.
Retirement plans are strictly a his-or-hers arrangement, with no
commingling allowed.</TE>

<HD>New Health-Care Plans May Not Be a Panacea</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Efforts to contain costs have sparked interest
in 'consumer-driven' programs, but some fear they may shift the
burden to employees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Companies that are trying to save money on employee health-care
benefits increasingly are turning to a new type of plan that may make
coverage more affordable--and available--but also could saddle some
workers with sharply higher medical bills.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called consumer-driven insurance plans have been embraced
by companies such as Lattice Financial, a software firm in Princeton
Junction, N.J., where President Adam Berger signed up his 10
employees because traditional insurance had become unaffordable.</LD>
<LD>   "Our insurance carriers came back to us with a 30% increase in
premiums last year," Berger said. "I can't say what our experience is
going to be with this new program, but at least people are given the
right incentives."</LD>
<TE>   American workers probably will hear a lot more about
consumer-driven health plans in coming months for much the same
reason. Insurers, consultants and business owners are looking for new
solutions to rising health insurance costs as the promise of cost
containment through managed-care programs is fading.</TE>
<TE>   With corporate health insurance costs up 10% last year and
expected to jump 16% in 2002, according to consultant Hewitt
Associates, employers are flocking to solutions that at least provide
hope of cost containment. A recent survey by Mercer Human Resources
Consulting indicates that 29% of large U.S. employers will be
offering a consumer-driven plan, or CDP, by next year.</TE>
<TE>   That's already creating some concern among consumer advocates, who
fear that the plans will penalize workers who have a lot of health
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Offering these new products is like stepping into a cold lake.
You go slowly, with a lot of fear," said Bob Hunter, director of
insurance for the Consumer Federation of America in Washington. "It's
always a danger to buy these products when they are in the first few
years of release because it's unclear how they are going to emerge."</TE>
<TE>   CDPs combine a high-deductible health insurance policy with a
health-care spending account that's funded by the employer. The
spending account usually can be tapped the moment the consumer has a
qualified medical cost, providing the ever-popular "first dollar
coverage" that workers have come to expect.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a catch. The spending account usually doesn't amount
to as much as the deductible on the insurance policy. The gap between
the medical expenses paid by the spending account and those paid by
the insurance policy must be filled by the consumer. At some
companies, that gap is small--$100 or $250, like the deductible on a
traditional health plan. At others, it can be a chasm amounting to
$1,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, a plan may offer an employee a $1,000 annual
health-care spending account, coupled with an insurance policy that
has a $2,500 deductible. Once the employee runs through the first
$1,000 in medical expenses, the next $1,500 must come out of his or
her own pocket before insurance coverage will kick in. At that point,
the insurance will pay 80% of any additional medical costs.</TE>
<TE>   For those with consistently high medical expenses, that can be a
problem, consumer advocates note. Paying both the employee's portion
of the health insurance premium, plus potentially thousands in
uncovered costs each year, could bankrupt an otherwise solvent
employee who has a chronic ailment such as diabetes or high blood
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers with chronic ailments who are given a choice of coverage
may choose to avoid the plans. So, too, might a couple planning to
have a child or someone facing $3,000 knee surgery. In these cases,
an employee's out-of-pocket medical costs probably would be thousands
of dollars more than they would be in a health maintenance
organization or other type of plan.</TE>
<TE>   Interest in CDPs has mounted since the Internal Revenue Service
ruled in June that unspent funds in the spending account portion of
these plans can be retained by the employee and rolled over from year
to year. That provision could allow healthy workers to create a
portable savings account for medical expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Theoretically, a healthy worker could accumulate thousands of
dollars in a spending account, using it to bridge the entire gap if
the employee became sick while still employed or to pay health
insurance premiums in retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "Big companies are looking at this as a way to finance medical
benefits into retirement," said Amit Gupta, president of CareGain, a
Monroe, N.J., health-care management company.</TE>
<TE>   But in practice, the plans vary widely. Some employers say they'll
allow workers to roll over all the money left in their spending
accounts each year; some plan to take back a portion of it; some may
leave the spending accounts alone but contribute less if their
workers build up balances--or if the company's finances get tight.
But because the oldest such plans have been in operation for less
than two years, the long-term results of any of these models are
unknown.</TE>
<TE>   "For people with resources, the strategy of having a large
deductible and holding aside some money in an account is a good one,"
Hunter said. "But there ought to be some guarantees that [funds in
the savings account portion of the plan] is your money that the
employer can't ever take away from you."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer-driven plans are united by one common theme-- if
consumers are given an economic stake in the medical decisions they
make, they may spend more prudently, said Tony Kotin, leader of
knowledge and service delivery at Mercer Human Resources Consulting
in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional insurance and managed-care programs give consumers
little incentive to watch their usage, said Marc Backon, chief
marketing officer at Destiny Health Inc. in Oakbrook, Ill., which
also sells CDPs.</TE>
<TE>   In traditional plans and managed care, once the employee pays a
relatively modest deductible, all medical bills are paid by
insurance. From the consumer's point of view, that made all care
appear to cost roughly the same--just the $5 or $10 co-payment for an
office visit or prescription, Gupta said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, health-care consumers often are insensitive to such
factors as the price disparity between brand-name and generic drugs,
Kotin said. The traditional model also doesn't discourage people from
rushing to a doctor at the first sign of a sniffle, when the more
cost-effective and possibly healthier solution could be to stay in
bed.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, those who sign up for a CDP are expected to be
more cost-conscious because they will see money coming from their
accounts. Depending on how the plan is set up, they also may have the
promise of an economic reward if money is left over at the end of the
year--and the threat of personal cost if they spend more than they're
given.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers will be able to see the doctors of their choice and buy
brand-name or generic drugs, Gupta said. They also will see--and
possibly feel--the economic effects. That could encourage an employee
with allergies, for instance, to use a generic medication that costs
$50 for a 90-day supply instead of a well-advertised brand name for
$300, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But it's tough to do comparison shopping for some medical
services, Kotin acknowledged. Although several Web sites provide
detailed information on differences in drug prices and even medical
outcomes for surgical procedures, doctors generally don't publish fee
schedules. Even if they did, the costs might be misleading because
you're often getting a la carte prices for services that essentially
are sold as a package, Kotin said.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the doctor's fee is only a small portion of the
total cost of knee surgery, Kotin said. There's also anesthesia,
physical therapy and recovery time. One doctor may charge more for
the surgery but have such good results that the physical therapy
requirements are diminished, he noted. That can make looking for a
cheaper doctor an inadvisable alternative on both an outcome and an
economic basis.</TE>
<TE>   Experts also worry that some consumers might become so
cost-conscious that they won't get checkups, immunizations and other
preventive care. Many plans are attempting to head off such
inadvisable economizing by making checkups and immunizations a
"no-cost" benefit, Kotin noted.</TE>
<TE>   "The intent of these plans is not to prevent people from consuming
appropriate care," he said. "It's the discretionary piece that
they're trying to manage."</TE>
<TE>   No one is claiming that CDPs are the latest health-care panacea,
Kotin said. Although they appear to have promise, their flaws
probably will become apparent with time--just as was the case with
managed care. But experiments such as this are necessary to address
prices that are rapidly outpacing the ability of both companies and
consumers to pay, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what doesn't work," Kotin said. "We're still working on
what does."</TE>

<LD>Two essential questions face investors who are trying to position
their portfolios for the next few years or longer-term:</LD>
<LD>   * What kind of returns do you expect, on average, from stocks,
bonds, real estate, short-term cash accounts and other major asset
categories?</LD>
<LD>   * How much does your portfolio need to earn to get you where you
want to go?</LD>
<TE>   Some financial advisors say the order of those questions should be
reversed: If you're struggling with asset-allocation decisions, they
say, first think about the amount of money necessary to fund your
life, and lifestyle, and then map out an investment mix that could
generate the returns you need.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of basic portfolio structure has become critical for
most investors over the last two years as stock prices have
plummeted. Before the bear market began, many people simply opted to
shovel all of their savings into stocks, trusting that Wall Street
would continue to produce superior returns. Now the outlook for
equities is much more sober.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Rodriguez, veteran manager of the Los Angeles-based FPA
Capital and FPA New Income mutual funds, believes that stock market
returns will average 5% or less annually over the next five years,
about half the historical average return, as the market struggles to
recover from the excesses of the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez is more pessimistic than many of his peers. But even if
equity returns turn out to be between, say, 5% and 8% in the next
five years, investors should consider how that would compare with
potential returns on other assets--in particular, corporate bonds,
the yields on which are tempting because they are historically high
compared with yields on Treasury securities and bank CDs.</TE>
<TE>   For the bulk of almost any portfolio, the choice is between assets
that may produce capital gains (the primary reason most people own
stocks) and assets that do produce income (bonds, bank CDs, etc.).</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s it seemed that stocks only went higher, and
substantially so each year. In that environment, when earning 20% or
more annually in equities was a slam dunk, there was little appeal in
the much lower yields provided by bonds and CDs.</TE>
<TE>   But now the tables have turned. Investors have a greater
appreciation of the risks involved in owning stocks. Despite the
market's rebound of the last five weeks, there is no assurance that
the longest bear market in a generation ended in late July. And even
if it did, the issue is what level of returns stocks can generate
from here, versus what's available on other investments.</TE>
<TE>   Any asset allocation decision involves guesswork and risks, of
course. Which is why many financial advisors start with a potentially
simpler question: What level of portfolio return would meet your
goals?</TE>
<TE>   If earning just 4% a year on your money for the next 10 years
would allow you to live comfortably and fund future obligations,
there's a simple solution that involves none of the risk of owning
stocks: Just buy 10-year Treasury notes, which now yield about 4.2%
annually.</TE>
<TE>   You'd be assured of getting back the face value of the bonds if
you hold them to maturity, because nothing is safer than Treasury
securities in that regard. But there is risk, nonetheless. If
inflation were to rise over the next decade, your fixed return could
be badly eroded.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, if you had to sell your Treasury notes before
maturity, you might get much less than face value, depending on the
level of market interest rates at that moment.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking Safety</TE>
<TE>   Many investors this year have decided that the long-term safety of
principal afforded by Treasuries outweighs the inflation risk. That's
apparent because demand for Treasuries--and mutual funds that own
government bonds--has pushed yields on those securities to 40-year
lows in the last few weeks. Those yields have since risen somewhat,
but they're still extraordinarily depressed.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the surge in cash inflows to federally insured bank
savings accounts this year is a powerful sign that many Americans now
crave safety of principal above all else.</TE>
<TE>   Not FPA's Rodriguez, however. He can own a mix of bond types in
his New Income fund, and his view of Treasuries is unequivocal: "I
find no value in high-quality bonds, especially Treasuries," he said.
"I will not commit capital at these levels."</TE>
<TE>   Individual investors should be casting a similarly wary eye on
super-safe assets, if the question is whether to buy more, many
financial advisors say. If earning 2% on bank savings accounts, or 4%
on long-term Treasuries, isn't going to get you very far toward
meeting your financial goals in the long run, you'll have to consider
whether it's a better time to be adding higher-risk assets that may
produce higher returns.</TE>
<TE>   There are stocks, naturally. But some Wall Street pros believe
that investors are missing a great opportunity in corporate bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds have declined this
year, but the "spread" between corporate yields and Treasury yields
remains near record levels.</TE>
<TE>   The Lure of Junk</TE>
<TE>   A Moody's Investors Service index of the average annualized yield
on AAA-rated corporate issues was at 6.37% late last week; on
BAA-rated issues (still considered investment-grade, but lower down
the quality ladder) the average yield was 7.58%.</TE>
<TE>   On corporate junk bonds--those considered below investment
grade--yields remain near their highest levels since the recession of
1990, though buyers jumped into the junk market last week, driving
yields down a bit. The average yield on a junk index tracked by KDP
Investment Advisors fell to 11.63% on Friday, down from a 52-week
high of 12.28% set on Aug. 14, but still far above the 8% to 9%
yields that prevailed on junk in 1997-1998.</TE>
<TE>   Why are investors so skittish about corporate bonds? There are a
number of reasons, but the most obvious is concern that the economy
might fall back into recession. Given that junk bond defaults already
are running at record levels in terms of the dollar volume of
securities, investors fear that another wave of defaults could be
ahead if the economy falters.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for investors who are willing to bet on equities at this
point--which is, after all, a bet on a better economy--corporate
bonds may make as much sense, or more.</TE>
<TE>   With bonds, assuming the issuing company can pay its bills, you're
at least assured of a certain annual income return through the bond's
maturity.</TE>
<TE>   Like all bonds, corporate issues face the risk that their fixed
returns could be eroded by inflation. But those risks are lower with
corporate issues than with Treasuries, for the simple reason that
corporate yields are much higher.</TE>
<TE>   Cautious Approach</TE>
<TE>   There's also a potential kicker with corporate issues: If the
economy is indeed recovering, the prices of many depressed bonds
should recover as well.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Malvey, fixed-income strategist at brokerage Lehman Bros. in
New York, said he's advising clients to begin committing money to
corporate bonds, though slowly, because he remains worried about the
economy and the risk of an outside shock, such as a U.S.-Iraq war.
But he believes investors should definitely be looking in the
direction of corporate issues.</TE>

or bond mutual funds that they're comfortable with. For help,

<LD>U.S. Seeks $20 Million</LD>
<LD>   From Enron Ex-CFO</LD>
<LD>   Justice Department officials said they would try to seize $20
million in profits illegally reaped by former Enron Corp. Chief
Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow based on information provided by
another Enron executive, Michael J. Kopper, who pleaded guilty to
conspiracy.</LD>
<TE>   Fastow hasn't been charged but has been portrayed as the
mastermind of three allegedly fraudulent off-the-books partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Kopper, a former director in Enron's global finance unit and a top
aide to Fastow, appeared before a federal judge in Houston to admit
that he broke wire-fraud and money-laundering laws. Kopper agreed to
hand over $12 million in illicit profits, money that will be returned
to investors who lost billions when Enron collapsed, government
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Kopper faces a maximum of 15 years in prison, but his cooperation
with prosecutors may ensure a more lenient sentence from Judge Ewing
Werlein Jr., experts said.</TE>

<TE>   Sell-Off Disrupts Recent Stock Rally</TE>
<TE>   Stocks ended the week on a sour note with the Dow Jones industrial
average tumbling 180 points and taking some of the shine off another
winning week for the market.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about the prospects for technology earnings and renewed
worries about corporate accounting and accountability--stoked by news
of deepening problems at Citigroup Inc. and AOL Time Warner
Inc.--fueled the end-of-the-week sell-off.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the loss, the Dow, with a 1.1% gain for the week, and
the S&amp;P 500, up 1.3%, notched their fifth straight weekly gains. The
last time the S&amp;P 500 achieved that feat was in the period ended
Sept. 1, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The tech-focused Nasdaq composite index, which fell 3% on Friday,
was up 1.4% for the week for its third straight weekly gain.</TE>

<TE>   AT&amp;T Is Subpoenaed in Analyst Probe</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Corp. received a subpoena from the New York attorney
general's office, which is trying to determine whether Citigroup Inc.
analyst Jack Grubman raised his recommendation on the telephone
company two years ago to help the bank get an advising role in a
$10.6-billion transaction two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup faces more than two dozen lawsuits in addition to
criminal probes, congressional subpoenas and regulatory
investigations over allegations that Grubman violated rules by
functioning as an investment banker for companies while he also wrote
research for the bank's Salomon Smith Barney unit.</TE>
<TE>   New York prosecutors are seeking to determine whether Grubman
raised his recommendation on AT&amp;T to help the bank win a role
arranging a $10.6-billion stock sale in 2000. AT&amp;T said it is
cooperating. Grubman resigned last week and received a $32.2-million
severance package.</TE>

<TE>   AOL, AT&amp;T Alter</TE>
<TE>   Cable TV Partnership</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Inc. and AT&amp;T Corp. agreed to dissolve their
complex Time Warner Entertainment partnership in a $9-billion deal
that also will create a publicly traded cable TV company.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner will pay $3.6 billion in cash and stock to AT&amp;T
and get 100% ownership of  HBO and Warner Bros. film studios, plus a
controlling stake in the new cable company, Time Warner Cable Inc.
Time Warner Cable, the nation's second-biggest cable operator with
10.8 million subscribers, plans an initial public offering, perhaps
as early as next year.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, expected to close early next year, simplifies AOL Time
Warner's financial structure, positions it to buy more cable TV
properties while prices are down and gives its troubled America
Online unit a long-sought means of offering high-speed Internet
connections to millions more customers on AT&amp;T's cable-TV network.</TE>

<TE>   U.S. Approves Steel Tariff Waivers</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration approved a seventh and final round of
steel tariff exclusions, waiving import duties on 178 products and
further reducing the threat of a trade war with Europe and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The latest batch of waivers raises to 727 the number of products
that have been exempted from the stiff tariffs imposed by President
Bush to give ailing U.S. steel manufacturers more time to clean up
their balance sheets and consolidate their operations.</TE>
<TE>   Steel companies criticized the exclusions as excessive;
steel-consuming industries said they were not extensive enough.
Industry experts predicted that the effect on U.S. steel prices would
be minimal but their political effect substantial.</TE>

<TE>   U.S. Opposes Order to Pull Paxil TV Ads</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department has asked a federal judge to reconsider an
order that GlaxoSmithKline pull all television ads that claim that
one of the company's bestselling drugs is not habit-forming, even
though the ads had satisfied the Food and Drug Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The order by U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer of Los Angeles
was directed at GlaxoSmithKline's anti-depression drug Paxil, which
accounted for more than $2 billion in sales in 2001. Pfaelzer ruled
that TV ads for the drug were misleading in that they discounted the
severity of withdrawal symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling came in a suit filed a year ago on behalf of 35
patients who said they suffered withdrawal symptoms such as nausea,
fever and so-called electric zaps to their bodies once they stopped
taking Paxil. It would take effect Sept. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA and lawyers for both sides said they had never heard of a
judge banning ads that had been approved by the agency.
GlaxoSmithKline said it would appeal.</TE>

<TE>   Vivendi Executives Discuss Deals for Assets</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal's top executives have begun exploratory talks
with several companies interested in Vivendi's U.S. entertainment
assets, sources told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The prospective deals could involve either a buyout of Vivendi's
movie, television and theme park properties or the creation of a new
entertainment company to be run by Barry Diller, chairman of Vivendi
Universal Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who have expressed interest are cable industry magnate
John Malone, who already owns 3.5% of Vivendi. DreamWorks SKG, the
8-year-old entertainment company financed by Microsoft co-founder
Paul Allen and owned and run by filmmaker Steven Spielberg, veteran
studio executive Jeffrey Katzenberg and music industry icon David
Geffen, also talked with Diller.</TE>
<TE>   The sale of Universal Studios, estimated to be worth at least $20
billion, would go a long way toward solving Vivendi's crippling debt
problem if buyers would be willing to pay something close to what the
assets are worth.</TE>

<TE>   Feinstein Urges MWD to Kill Mojave Project</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called on the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California to vote down a $150-million proposal
for a water storage program in the Mojave Desert as unnecessary and a
potential environmental threat.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein's comments, in a letter to the MWD, could be the most
damaging blow yet to the Cadiz water storage program.</TE>
<TE>   The Cadiz program, proposed in 1997, has become the signature
project of Keith Brackpool, an entrepreneur who has been a generous
financial backer of Gov. Gray Davis and one of Davis' trusted
advisors on water policy. Brackpool's company, Cadiz Inc., which
would be MWD's partner in the project, borrowed heavily on the
expectation that the project would be approved earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein's letter came amid indications the Interior Department
is poised to issue, over her objections, the final federal
environmental permits needed for the project to go forward. But MWD
sources say the board may be near a decision to put the project on
hold anyway, in part because of doubts that sufficient surplus water
would be available from the Colorado River.</TE>

<TE>   Vanguard More Activist in Proxy Voting</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard Group may be best known for its "passive," index-style
investing, but the mutual fund giant said it would begin taking a
more activist role in corporate governance: The firm has revamped the
standards it will follow in proxy voting, putting companies on notice
about key governance issues.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime activist investors representing pension funds hailed the
move by the second-largest mutual fund company, but some governance
experts called the new policies limited in scope.</TE>
<TE>   Valley Forge, Pa.-based Vanguard, whose funds hold about $300
billion in stocks, posted on its Web site a letter recently sent by
Chairman John J. Brennan to leaders of companies in which Vanguard
holds a major stake. The letter addresses new standards in such areas
as director independence and stock option programs.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Push Strategic Free Trade Agreements</HD>
<DH>Policy: The White House will seek pacts with Chile and
Singapore, along with other nations, while continuing global and
regional negotiations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Armed with greater bargaining power, the Bush administration is
pushing forward with an aggressive market-opening campaign aimed at
promoting growth and countering global concerns about U.S.
protectionism, and a top priority is completion of free trade
agreements with Chile and Singapore.</LD>
<LD>   The White House also has said it plans to initiate bilateral trade
talks with Central American nations and Morocco and is considering
adding Australia and South Africa to the list.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration calls this strategy "competitive
liberalization." That means striking up bilateral agreements with
strategic countries while also making progress on the regional Free
Trade Area of the Americas and a new round of global trade talks,
both of which have a 2005 deadline.</LD>
<TE>   Lowering tariff barriers in Chile for U.S.-made tractors and wheat
and getting U.S. bankers a bigger piece of Singapore's lucrative
financial market are just part of the goal. Equally important, U.S.
officials say, is that this month's hard-fought passage of a bill
giving the president so-called fast-track authority to negotiate
trade agreements sends a message to trade partners in Europe, Asia
and Latin America that the U.S. is aggressively returning to the
negotiating table.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials say the bilateral agreements can be used
as a testing ground for resolving contentious issues and will
increase the pressure on recalcitrant trading partners worried that
they will be squeezed out of the lucrative U.S. market.</TE>
<TE>   "A fundamental aspect of our trade policy is to create competition
for liberalization," said a top U.S. trade official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. "Doing a bilateral agreement with Chile or
the Central American countries provides more stimulus for other
countries in Latin America and makes sure we're on track for the
hemispheric agreements like the FTAA."</TE>
<TE>   Tactic Could Backfire</TE>
<TE>   Trying to push on so many fronts is risky, some contend, because
the results can backfire. When the U.S. gave Ecuador duty-free access
to the U.S. market for its tuna as part of a trade pact aimed at
discouraging drug trafficking, it triggered an outcry from hard-hit
seafood producers in the Philippines, a key U.S. ally in Asia.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get a lot of things happening like this, it can create
messed-up trade regimes and a lot of foreign policy headaches," said
Edward Gresser, a former Clinton administration trade official now at
the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington. "My hope is they
focus on the big things, like FTAA, and not quite as much on
bilateral agreements."</TE>
<TE>   During a visit to Latin America this summer, U.S. Trade
Representative Robert Zoellick said he wanted to complete the Chile
and Singapore negotiations by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   The governments of Chile and Singapore are friendly to the United
States and eager to strike deals that would expand their exports and
improve their regional stature. The U.S. has free trade agreements
with Mexico, Canada, Israel and Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Bush administration's economic summit in Waco, Texas,
two weeks ago, President Bush and other key Cabinet officials have
been traveling the country trumpeting open borders as a key to
America's turnaround. But this message has been greeted with
skepticism, particularly among foreign governments unhappy with
recent U.S. moves to restrict steel imports and boost farm subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Agricultural reform is one of the most contentious issues in
global negotiations. Developing countries argue that they have not
been able to benefit from trade liberalization because they can't
compete against heavily subsidized farmers in the U.S., Europe and
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Lowering Barriers</TE>
<TE>   To address those concerns, the Bush administration last month
floated a far-reaching proposal in the World Trade Organization to
reduce barriers in farm trade. The U.S. suggested phasing out export
subsidies, cutting the global average farm tariff to 15% from 62% and
restricting subsidies to 5% of a country's agricultural production.</TE>
<TE>   Europeans, who spent $2 billion on export subsidies in 2000,
compared with $20 million by the U.S., dismissed the plan as
unworkable. But other countries viewed the proposal as evidence that
the U.S. was willing to take painful steps to move its trade agenda
forward, according to the U.S. trade official.</TE>
<TE>   "Since that proposal was made, we have been getting a lot better
reaction from countries," he said. "It helped restore their
confidence that we're still on track to maintain reform in
agriculture."</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture also is a sticking point in the U.S.-Chile
negotiations. A regional farming powerhouse, Chile poses stiff
competition in the U.S. for California grapes and wine and Alaska
salmon. But U.S. farmers want greater access to Chile's market,
particularly in protected areas such as wheat and vegetable oil.</TE>
<TE>   Elimination of Chile's 6% tariff also would help U.S. firms whose
share of the Chilean market has declined to 18% from 24% since 1997.
The National Assn. of Manufacturers attributes much of that $800
million in lost sales to competition from countries such as Canada
and Mexico that negotiated free trade agreements with Chile.</TE>
<TE>   Advantages for Chile</TE>
<TE>   For Chile, a trade agreement with the U.S. would provide a
powerful vote of approval at a time when many of its neighbors in
Latin America are struggling to stay afloat.</TE>
<TE>   "To be a member of this rather exclusive club would imply that
Chile would be singled out in international financial circles as a
country that is reliable," said Andres Bianchi, Chilean ambassador to
the U.S. "The main advantages for us would be to increase and
diversify our exports, reduce the cost of external financing and
attract more foreign investment."</TE>
<TE>   Singapore, a prosperous city-state hit hard by the technology
downturn, also is seeking trade alliances to bolster its status as a
regional entrepot. In return, the U.S. wants greater access for U.S.
companies in tightly controlled areas such as banking and accounting.
In the lucrative area of retail banking, only five foreign firms,
including Citigroup Inc.'s Citibank, are licensed to operate in
Singapore, according to the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   As an influential member of the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations,
Singapore carries clout within the region and frequently has offered
itself as a counterweight to Western concepts of human rights and
social justice. Although Singapore is regarded as one of the most
open economies in the world, its government has drawn criticism for
its tight control of political opposition and the media.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Hufbauer, a senior trade analyst at the Institute for
International Economics, said Singapore's regional prominence makes
it more difficult to sign on to a trade agreement whose provisions on
labor and the environment could be viewed as an infringement of
sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   Under provisions of the fast-track trade legislation, U.S.
negotiators must ensure that trade agreements include provisions to
deter governments from watering down their labor or environmental
laws to attract business from abroad. Congress can approve or deny
but not modify any agreements negotiated by the president.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore "may not be willing to sign because it would be regarded
as a sellout to the U.S. and a benchmark that would be used in Asia,"
Hufbauer said. "I regard those as the trickiest issues for the U.S.
and Singapore to negotiate through."</TE>
<TE>   New Approach Possible</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Polaski, a former State Department official who worked on
labor issues, said the eagerness of Singapore's government to
conclude such a trade deal gives the Bush administration room to be
creative. For example, Brazil prefers using fines rather than trade
sanctions in cases in which a government fails to uphold its labor or
environmental laws. One compromise would be the model used in the
North American Free Trade Agreement in which trade benefits are
withdrawn only if the offending party refuses to pay a fine for such
violations.</TE>
<TE>   Another potential flashpoint is the inclusion of an investor
dispute provision aimed at protecting U.S. firms that do business in
countries with weak or corrupt judicial systems. This obscure measure
gained notoriety under NAFTA, when foreign investors began suing the
governments of Canada, Mexico and the U.S. for actions that were
allegedly discriminatory or trade-restrictive. In the first case
targeting a U.S. environmental law, Canadian firm Methanex Corp. sued
the U.S. for $970 million in damages claiming that it was harmed by

<TE>   By establishing a model for handling these controversial issues,
the Bush administration could help address the growing unease among
Americans that increased trade threatens U.S. jobs, leads to
exploitation of foreign workers and increases environmental abuse,
according to Polaski, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a case where the [Chile and Singapore agreements] could
provide momentum to the entire trade agenda or it could be a
self-inflicted wound that continues to keep our policy debate
fractured," she said.</TE>

<DH>Men's briefs are riding lower to match their jeans</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alberto Mendez has had his fashion highs--and now he's riding low in
hip-hugging skivvies for the low-rise jeans that have infiltrated his
closet.</LD>
<LD>   He's tried boxers and briefs under the low-slung trousers he wears
on the weekend to show off the tattoo above his tailbone. But the
styles "would rise and bunch up," he says. "I didn't know what to
wear. I had to go commando a couple of times," says the 27-year-old
assignment editor at KCBS, who dresses corporate-style for work. Then
he purchased low-rise briefs. Since then, he's been wearing them not
just with his jeans but daily with his business slacks.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Hewlett, an avid low-rise trouser aficionado, doesn't do
boxers. They're not "sexy enough" for the blond 27-year-old importer
who operates Hewlett &amp; Son Worldwide Inc. in Los Feliz. He prefers a
briefer cut. "I like the short underwear that falls just below the
hipbone. You know," he says pausing pensively, "underwear can be a
complicated piece of clothing, which is why I have all the brands."</LD>
<TE>   Men are finding more options than ever in their quest to drop
their shorts--in a manner of speaking, of course--for their low-rise
looks, a trend that once was the domain of women.</TE>
<TE>   From pint-sized briefs to body-hugging boxers, many of the newer
styles are so compact that they look as if they have shrunk in the
dryer. Just this month, Jockey and Joe Boxer joined the low-rise
posse that includes the likes of Calvin Klein, 2(x)ist and Playboy,
which are churning out seamless, no-fly, body-contoured designs made
of high-tech fabrics that promise to be lighter, faster drying, as
soft as cotton and 1 to 3 inches lower on the waist.</TE>
<TE>   The current dip at the hip trend--a popular European guy style for
several years--is not about flaunting elasticized labels and boxer
prints above baggy trousers, a la hip-hop-wearing nation. It's about
making sure you're covered underneath those sexy low-riders, which
can be tricky when you stand up and potentially encounter a cheeky
situation.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it: In the world of men's clothes, there are only so
many silhouette options," says Randy Heil, men's fashion director for
Macy's West. "To tweak a pant and create a new must-have look is
exciting. But nothing is more exciting in retail than one product
creating a demand for another. And if you've got the new jean, you're
going to need the new briefer brief."</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of fashionable ultra-low jeans: Frankie B. Men,
Diesel, Guess, Buffalo, Eisbar, Fever, Seven, Calvin Klein and even
Levi. Other design firms are paying attention, including DKNY, slated
to trot out a low-rise men's jean line next spring. And come
December, 2(x)ist, a company known for sexy underwear since its start
in 1992, will introduce its first sportswear product: a low-rise
men's jean.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, it's about tying in our low-rise underwear with the
low-rise jean trend," says Jeff Danzer, the company's executive vice
president, about the denim collection. "These days, a guy wearing a
low-rise garment isn't about being gay or straight. It's about being
confident and secure and not thinking about what people think."</TE>
<TE>   So Low They Had to Go</TE>
<TE>   At a July men's runway show in Milan the jeans on a model were so
low that they slipped down as he turned to make his exit. "He caught
them halfway down his cheeks," laughs David Wolfe, creative director
of the Doneger Group, a New York-based consulting firm that analyzes
fashion trends. "As embarrassing as the incident was for the model,
it illustrated the need for low, low briefs. And you can bet that
underwear companies will send out the product because style today is
all about sex."</TE>
<TE>   Last week at a photo shoot in New York, male models were wearing
low-slung jeans. "We had to keep jamming down the waistbands of their
underwear so they wouldn't show. That just wasn't sexy," says Wolfe.
"The look today isn't about showing underwear. Who wants to see more
underwear? Skin is in."</TE>
<TE>   Less than two years ago, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. quietly began making a
low-rise jean for men called the Skinner, with a three-button fly and
a 9-inch "rise," which refers to the length of the seam from the top
of the waistband to the joint seam in the crotch. A standard jean has
a 12-inch rise. The Skinner proved a success, so, nine months ago,
Levi delivered an even lower low-rise called the Offender with a
two-button 7-inch rise sold exclusively at Barneys New York stores.</TE>
<TE>   "That jean is so low that you have to wax." says Jimmy Hanrahan,
director of product publicity, about the style that has been selling
out. For Levi's, the low-rise trend "is about addressing the need of
the consumer," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "For years, guys have been wearing standard jeans on the hip, low
and baggy. That pretty much has been the mainstream norm," he adds,
which is why earlier this month the company launched a more modest
low-rise for men with a 10-inch rise. "We just decided to put jeans
where men want to wear them and at the same time show off their
assets. This was not about chasing a trend. The Levi's brand is too
old to get trendy." It even offers size 40 low-rise jeans.</TE>
<TE>   Following Pants Trend</TE>
<TE>   With Levi and other brand names competing for the men's low-rise
market, naturally the $1.7-billion men's underwear industry would
follow, says Marshal Cohen, co-president of NPDFashionworld, a Port
Washington, N.Y.-based company that tracks apparel industry trends.</TE>
<TE>   "The low-rise brief has the potential to be the new rising star
and could possibly stay for a long while," he says, adding, "There's
not a lot of reason to wear low-rise skivvies if you are wearing
basic pants, but if the wearer likes them--even though he may not
like the low-rise trouser--he'll wear them because it's the consumer
who ultimately will determine the longevity of this new style."</TE>
<TE>   But the future may ultimately rest with women. Cohen says NPD's
research shows that more than 65% of women purchase underwear for
men. "This is also about women liking the low-rise look on their men
or relating to it themselves. They had to buy low-rise undergarments
for their low-rise pants, too. Women understand."</TE>
<TE>   The philosophy at Intimo Inc., is that men's underwear can be just
as sexy, elegant and stylish as women's lingerie, head designer Tommy
Nathan says about his line of men's undies. American men have become
the new women, spending $3.5 billion for grooming products. More than
1 million had plastic surgery last year, an all-time high.</TE>
<TE>   With all the choices out there, men are likely to experiment with
different styles. As Cohen puts it, "Who's going to know besides the
wearer? It's like a guy wearing a holey sock. If you don't see it,
who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   More than a year ago, Jim Noble, senior vice president for Jockey
International Inc., heard about the low-rise trend for men in
Britain--and even before that, in Spain, France and Austria, "where
men are more daring. It was bound to become a trend in America, too."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lifestyle garment," says Noble, adding that Jockey
introduced the first U.S. men's bikini in 1959--also Euro-inspired.
"The trick for us was to tweak the original brief made in 1934 so
that it's comfortable for the low-rise look without it riding too
low. The wearer shouldn't have to keep pulling it up," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles companies with more experience designing the new
briefs know what works. "With low-rise briefs, the cut has to be
proportionate. You have to have the high-cut legs to balance the
low-rise waistband," says Greg Olvera, owner of Go Softwear. "A brief
can be skimpy, but it also has to be comfortable or it doesn't sell."</TE>
<TE>   Drawstring Styles</TE>
<TE>   Today's styles include low-rise drawstrings, a popular style for
the Rips brand. "We did more business last month than we did the
entire year of 2001," says one of Rips' founders, Garrett Cunneen.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about guys in their teens and early 20s who are
just as vain as women now and are no longer self-conscious about
wanting to look good even in underwear," says Rips co-owner Storm
Jenkins.</TE>
<TE>   Still, not everyone is sold on the low-rise concept. Jack
Herschlag, executive director of the National Assn. of Men's
Sportswear Buyers trade group in New York, says he doesn't "like to
throw cold water on fashion ideas, but I don't understand it. I bet
against it being a big trend. The young beach-type guys will look
good in low-rise, but that's not the mainstream market."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not, but even designer Nick Graham, who built the San
Francisco-based Joe Boxer brand on bold old-fashioned boxers peeking
above regular trousers, introduced low-rise underwear this month at
Kmart. That doesn't mean he's abandoning the aesthetic that put him
on the map, though. "I still think it's kind of cool to show
underwear," he said.</TE>

organizing America's Ride 2002, a trip from San Diego to New York
City and Washington, D.C., to commemorate the events of Sept. 11. The
benefit ride begins Sept. 2. It's a way for Americans to "bond
together and celebrate our freedom as we approach the first
anniversary of 9/11," Morrison said.</CP>

<HD>A Trip to the Store for Milk, Bread --and Germs?</HD>
<DH>A grocer enters the antibacterial battle, arming shoppers
with sanitizing wipes</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In these germ-phobic times, you begin to wonder: Just how long do you
have before lurking viruses and bacteria take you down? Oh, but this
is America, land of the pre-moistened towelettes, where
scary-sounding microbes--think flesh-eating bacteria, if you
will--purportedly can be warded off with a little know-how.</LD>
<LD>   Walk into any Gelson's market, for instance. At a kiosk near the
entrance, you'll find the kind of free offering that could keep us
all from going down the road to a bubbled Biosphere 2: hospital-grade
antibacterial wipes to whisk away germs from the handles of shopping
carts and baskets.</LD>
<LD>   Executives of the upscale Encino-based grocery chain began
planning the towelette service a year ago, before the anthrax scare
that prompted many companies to provide antibacterial soaps in
restrooms. Talk about hitting the Zeitgeist with surgically gloved
precision.</LD>
<TE>   Gelson's move came at a customer's suggestion, said company
President Bob Stiles. "She's a very concerned lady about the
transference of germs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Germs have become the buzzword for a danger people want to
eliminate from their surroundings," wrote Dr. Stuart B. Levy, a Tufts
University microbiologist, in the June 2001 issue of the journal
Emerging Infectious Diseases.</TE>
<TE>   According to a July 2000 study by Consumer Reports, more than 700
everyday products labeled "antibacterial" or "disinfectant" were
introduced from 1997 to 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that the American Medical Assn. has asked federal
regulators to review products such as antibacterial soaps and similar
cleansers to determine whether they pose a health threat by
encouraging the growth of super bugs, or resistant
microorganisms--and wiping out the so-called good bacteria that help
fight off germs. The Soap and Detergent Assn. trade group has
countered that such products can kill or inhibit the growth of
bacteria such as salmonella and E. coli.</TE>
<TE>   The antibacterial concept is hard to turn away from: the promise
of good hygiene in a pocket-sized bottle of multi-tasking "hand
sanitizer" gel, with aloe, moisturizers and vitamin E.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the alternative, the experts' advice on how to
potentially protect yourself from getting sick, particularly when
those around you have succumbed to a cold or flu: Give your hands a
good 30-second scrubbing, using regular soap and paper towels, each
time you touch your nose or use the bathroom. That's the
microbiologists' sound but not very practical equivalent of saying
drive at 55 mph--who has that kind of time?</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the public turns to the convenience of antibacterial
goods such as the towelettes that Gelson's began providing six months
ago in its 18 stores.</TE>
<TE>   In their search for towelettes that would not cause allergic
reactions, company officials decided to tap a pharmaceutical company
that provides the same product to hospitals. Of course, there's no
assurance that the wipes will keep a customer in good health, Stiles
said. "If you really stop to think about it, there are so many ways
[to pick up germs]," he said, such as "money that gets passed back
and forth between people."</TE>
<TE>   The wipes, which cost the company 3 or 4 cents each, also are
being used by people who want to clean off their hands or the
shopping cart's child seat. Customer reaction has been overwhelmingly
positive, Stiles said. "Gelson's thinks of everything," one customer
said. In the single negative reaction, a customer said, "You've taken
it too far. You've gone over the edge."</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing particularly germ-laden about a shopping cart
handle or supermarket, said Dr. Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious
diseases at St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers in New York City.
"This is daily life. There are germs all over the place. You can be
paranoid, or you can be appropriately cautious."</TE>
<TE>   So how far will we go in our impossible quest for germ-free
living? You can buy the antibacterial SaniGuard, a dry spray that
allegedly kills germs on public telephones, gym equipment and other
possibly contaminated items. You can hang Air Supply, "the world's
first wearable air purifier," around your neck so that "viruses and
bacteria ... are molecularly destroyed." You can avoid shaking hands
or touching someone on the arm.</TE>
<TE>   And then you can figure out how to explain to children that
everyday human contact really is not such a very bad idea.</TE>

<LD>Gurmukh Kaur Khalsa is an expert on yoga ("Earth Mother, Yoga Star,"
Aug. 16). She obviously knows what she is doing to give mothers
relaxation and serenity, and this doubtless has a positive effect on
the unborn child. But she demonstrates the fatal flaw of many
"gurus." Charles Lindbergh was an expert on aeronautics, but he
expounded on (and was listened to about) politics when he had no more
expertise than the person in the street. Gurus have an obligation to
be careful about the spillover halo effect.</LD>
<LD>   Where does she get her expertise about childhood vaccinations? If
she truly cares about the unborn child, she will refrain from
discouraging mothers from protecting their children based on her
"opinions." Scientific, reliable, reproducible and accurate
information abounds that supports the overwhelming benefits of
immunization.</LD>

<HD>It's Time to Combat the Notion That Guns Are a Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My pulse quickened and my hands began the old familiar tremble as I
perused the picture of an adult in camouflage uniform holding a gun
and instructing a group of likewise-attired children not yet in their
teens ("They're Gunning for the Enemy as Junior James Bonds," Aug
15). It did not matter to me that the gun was a paintball gun. What
so distressed me was the mesmerized, attentive look on the children's
faces. I've seen that dull, unquestioning look before--on the faces
of so many ammo-draped children carrying the all-too-real, deadly
weapons of war: mortar rounds, grenades, rocket launchers and assault
rifles.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever are the parents of the children in the photo thinking?
Don't they understand that their children, shooting simulated guns,
are being desensitized about pointing weapons at other human beings?
Don't they know that the vocabulary of this paintball "game" prepares
these children to dehumanize other people, using words like "enemy,"
"hit," "take out," "knock down," and even "wound" and "kill"? Does
the article really have to tell us that these impressionable kids
think instructor "Rocky," a veteran of the Australian military, is
"cool"?</LD>
<TE>   What does it matter to these parents that they may have to
sacrifice their children? What does it matter that their children may
be only teenagers when they are called to serve in a war? What will
it matter when their children are crippled or killed?</TE>
<TE>   As a military veteran of 23 years, I can tell you: It will matter
a lot. Not even the free American flag they will receive, for which
they sacrificed their children, will much assuage their lifetime of
grief. They will certainly question the utility of war and the
horrible prices that have to be paid.</TE>
<TE>   From one who was a real "James Bond" for half of the 10 years I
served as an officer for the Defense Intelligence Agency: Put away
the guns; master at least one other language; become conversant in
several others; intensively study world geography, economics, history
and religions. After all that, you will probably be too wise to
either participate in war or to be "James Bond."</TE>

<LD>Thank you so much, Reed Johnson, for your beautiful remembrance of
Galen Rowell ("The Sky Was His Limit," Aug. 15). It was Rowell's work
in the Sierra Club desk calendars during the 1970s that in part
inspired me to get an undergraduate education in environmental
biology. Many years later, I named my now 7-year-old son after him.</LD>
<LD>   For all of us who cherish the Earth's wild places, his loss is
tremendous. I cannot think of how many thousands of times over the
past 20 years, trapped inside an office somewhere, I looked at his
photos on my desk and mentally escaped to some another place. I hope
there is a young photographer out there somewhere striving to carry
on his work.</LD>

<HD>Old Notions About Rape Victims Persist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sitting on my porch on a warm Sunday evening, I read Sandy Banks'
column on "rape victim anonymity" ("A Vanishing Point for Rape Victim
Anonymity," Aug. 11) ... and read it with interest, as I am a rape
victim. My attack occurred more than 20 years ago, and the legacy of
that horrible afternoon has stayed with me. It's an odd legacy, equal
parts rage and fear, but one that is ever present.</LD>
<LD>   Would printing my name in a paper, saying it on TV, somehow lessen
that pain? I hardly think so, but I can't explain why. Nor can I
explain the curiosity people have with rape and its victims, a
curiosity that runs through the column.</LD>
<LD>   Do people want to know our pain? Or do they want details? You make
a point, early on, that an old attitude blaming victims, assuming the
victim either deserved the attack or didn't fight hard enough against
it, has faded. And then (surprisingly!) the column ended with praise
for the girls for the "risks they took" and their "strength." The
suggestion there--and everywhere--is still the same: The good ones
avoid rape or get away, the rest of us deserve it for being weak.</LD>
<TE>   The problem with rape has little to do with the names of its
victims or any shame they may feel. (Most of us don't feel shame,
because we were present at the crime and know that fault had nothing
to do with the violence.) And we know that rape has precious little
to do with sex, and everything to do with overwhelming fear for one's
own life. It's the public that persists in its notion of rape as a
wild, dangerous form of sex, made more exciting by the fact it's been
stolen. We don't need the public's prurient interest to help us come
to terms with rape, much less "recover" from it, as Banks suggest we
must.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As a mother of triplets (now age 5), born healthy at 36 1/2 weeks, I
felt immediately compelled to comment on this story ("Pregnant With
Unexpected Grief," Aug. 11). I believe it gives a one-sided view
about multiple pregnancy and perpetuates mass public
misunderstanding.</LD>
<LD>   Too many women are still being told (many times by their doctors)
that selective reduction (which, by the way, risks the loss of all
the fetuses) is the only way to ensure a healthy outcome. Though it
is true that MFPR (multi-fetal pregnancy reduction) is controversial
and new research is being done all the time, there are national
nonprofits such as the Triplet Connection, a national organization
for higher order multiple families who strive to educate the public
in general and expectant mothers of multiples in particular early in
their pregnancies so they can make an informed choice before they
make the decision to end the life of one (or more) of their children.</LD>

<HD>Celebrity Magazines Minus the Stars</HD>
<DH>Media* When the daily spotlight dims on Martha, Rosie and
Oprah, their publishing arms could wither too. Ad sales drop along
with readership.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TARA WEISS</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Celebrity magazines always seem like such a good idea at the time.
The formula is simple: Take a celebrity with a well-established
message, and parlay that into a magazine bursting with her
personality. As in Martha Stewart Living, Rosie and O, the Oprah
Magazine.</LD>
<LD>   But what happens when that celebrity's image is tarnished or her
talk show ends? Martha Stewart, Rosie O'Donnell and Oprah Winfrey are
all in different circumstances--Stewart is accused of insider
trading, O'Donnell is battling her magazine's editorial staff and
Winfrey is ending her show after the 2005-06 season--but their
magazines may suffer similarly.</LD>
<LD>   Branding a celebrity to a magazine establishes an immediate, eager
audience, but it also increases the risk of alienating those readers
when something in that celebrity's life is altered.</LD>
<TE>   Stewart's case is the most dire. The queen of crafts, cooking and
homemaking is getting slammed in the media for selling shares of
ImClone Systems Inc. just before U.S. regulators rejected the
company's cancer drug and its stock value plummeted. Now a House
committee is joining the list of those trying to figure out exactly
what she knew and when.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Stewart's Omnimedia shares have lost more than half
their value this year as the investigations hurt sales. Chief
Financial Officer James Follo said last month that some advertisers
are holding back from buying ads in Stewart's magazines until
investigations are over.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you can diminish the effect that this scandal can
have on her magazine," says Karl Barnhart, a managing director of
CoreBrand New York, a corporate branding and communication company.
"On the newsstand, where there is more of a spontaneous purchase,
people might be less likely to pick it up. She took the positioning
that she's very moral and upstanding and that she is the epitome of
American values. All of a sudden, there's a chink in the armor."</TE>
<TE>   "While the media frenzy surrounding Martha has obviously not been
helpful, most of our major advertisers continue to focus on the
strong demographics and brand loyalty of our readers and viewers, and
to buy advertising in our media properties," says a spokeswoman for
the magazine. "Our sales teams continue to work diligently with our
advertisers to best meet their needs. The September 2002 issue of
Martha Stewart Living magazine closed up in ad pages year over year.
Ad pages in our October 2002 issue, which closes next Friday, are
currently expected to be flat over 2001."</TE>
<TE>   O'Donnell's situation is more complicated. Launched in May 2001,
O'Donnell's magazine took over what was formerly McCall's. She set
out to capture a TV audience that was attracted to her no-nonsense
style and discussions of children and adoption. She serves as the
editorial director and writes a feature called Cutie Patootie, in
which she interviews a child every month.</TE>
<TE>   In May, she ended her 6-year-old show, and in April, in her book
"Find Me," she revealed that she is gay.</TE>
<TE>   "When she left her show, she lost her pulpit," says CoreBrand's
Barnhart. "She lost her No. 1 awareness-builder for her magazine."</TE>
<TE>   Now reports are surfacing that O'Donnell is trying to impose a
heavy hand at the magazine. She's disagreeing with the magazine's new
editor, Susan Toepfer, about what should and shouldn't go on the
cover. O'Donnell wanted Boy George on the cover; Toepfer said no.
O'Donnell wanted her pregnant partner to appear in the magazine;
Toepfer said no. Toepfer wanted to include low-calorie foods in a
Valentine's Day section; Rosie said no.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to work things through and would like to continue
publishing a successful magazine," says Sue Geramian, director of
corporate communications at Gruner &amp; Jahr USA, the magazine's
publisher.</TE>
<TE>   Newsstand sales are starting to slip. During its first six months
the magazine's newsstand sales averaged 550,000. Some issues in 2002
have fallen to 200,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mixed bag, and that's what publishers always have to
remember with any entity that ties itself with one person," says
CNNfn's Susan Lisovicz. "They had a venerable but dusty publication
in McCall's and needed to update it in a competitive and crowded
marketplace. She's great, the lovable queen of nice. It was the
perfect marketing platform. But they didn't see that Rosie didn't
want to do the talk show anymore. She didn't like the editorial
decisions being made.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a risk that one takes when you tie one person to a brand,
and it's absolutely playing out with Rosie."</TE>
<TE>   One media observer takes it a step further.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Rosie's magazine will be with us for a long time,"
says Samir Husni, a magazine expert and journalism professor at the
University of Mississippi. "Rosie was supposed to be a women's
magazine that took over from McCall's. Readers didn't want a preachy
magazine. They can get Ms. if they want that."</TE>
<TE>   As for Winfrey, her magazine continues to do well. But with her
talk show ending after the 2005-06 season, she will lose a major
platform. Winfrey also added an extra level of personal security by
installing her best friend, Gayle King, as an editor. King is
responsible for ensuring Winfrey's viewpoints get into the magazine,
and she serves as a liaison between Winfrey and the magazine's
editorial staff. So far it's worked.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Stewart and O'Donnell should look for best friends.</TE>

<HD>The Army's Mad Lab</HD>
<DH>Courage pills and spray-on clothes are among the offbeat

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NATICK, Mass.</DL>
<LD>When he jabbed a nightstick into the geezer sleeping in the snow, the
cop figured he was saving the old guy from freezing to death.
Instead, he inadvertently disrupted an offbeat 1958 experiment
involving polar explorer Hubert Wilkins and a heap of chicken
feathers. Wilkins, then 69, was a researcher at one of the strangest
science labs on the planet.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last 50 years, he and his colleagues at the Natick Labs
have walked through flames, tangled with radioactive cockroaches and
devoured weird foods in the name of military science.</LD>
<LD>   Employed by the Army, they work to develop futuristic gear for
soldiers. But many of their technological leaps eventually invade
civilian life--from chicken McNuggets and freeze-dried coffee to
bulletproof vests and self-heating parkas.</LD>
<TE>   Still on the drawing board: courage pills, spray-on clothing and a
modified nicotine patch that delivers vitamins and nutrients to
people who don't have time to eat. Perhaps the lab's most outlandish
project is a uniform that would change colors like a chameleon and
enable troops to leap over 20-foot walls.</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, the U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center (as the lab
is officially known) could pass for a sleepy college campus. Set on a
grassy lakeside peninsula 20 miles west of Boston, it encompasses
scattered buildings, tennis courts and a softball field.</TE>
<TE>   But on closer inspection, things definitely get peculiar.</TE>
<TE>   The air-conditioning can be set to 70 below zero. The chefs serve
meals in toothpaste tubes. And the local church is an "instant
chapel" that can be parachuted into war zones, complete with
camouflage Jewish prayer shawls, compasses that point toward Mecca
and a digital hymnal programmed to play hundreds of worship songs.</TE>
<TE>   "There are all kinds of toys here," says Natick Lab spokesman
Jerry Whitaker.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in a cubbyhole full of blinking lights and whirring
machinery, research physical scientist Thomas Endrusick outlines
Natick's storied history. Wavy-haired and trim, Endrusick is one of
the lab's few links to its past. When he signed on in 1973 as a boot
tester, some of the original scientists were still around, recounting
various exploits.</TE>
<TE>   "World War II was the real impetus for this place," Endrusick
says, hovering over a computer screen that flashes photos and charts
to accompany his narrative. When U.S. forces plunged into combat in
late 1941, their gear was absurdly out of date. The joke was that
soldiers entered World War II with equipment left over from World War
I, but the situation was actually much worse.</TE>
<TE>   Because of isolationist sentiment between the wars, military
planners assumed future combat would take place only on American
soil. Thus, items designed to withstand the rigors of muddy trench
warfare in France had been modified to handle little more than life
on a military base in Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   "We could fight in Minnesota in the winter and Florida in the
summer, but that was it," says Army historian Steven Anders.</TE>
<TE>   The results were near-disastrous. Tents in the south Pacific
disintegrated after two weeks because their fire-resistant finish
lacked a fungicide to stop mildew. Food shipments got dumped at sea
after the cans rusted. And when U.S. troops invaded the icy Aleutian
Islands wearing uninsulated boots, they suffered more injuries from
trench foot and exposure than from the enemy, Endrusick says.</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed Army officials hired Georges Doriot, a former Harvard
business professor, to whip things into shape. In 1942, he opened the
Army Quartermaster's first Research and Development branch,
headquartered in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Before that, "it was unheard of to measure the width of foot space
in a tank to see how much area a man's shoes might use," wrote Army
historian Marcia L. Lightbody in a 1998 paper delivered to a
conference of military historians.</TE>
<TE>   Doriot recruited Ivy League professors, captains of industry,
mountaineers, textile makers and jungle experts. To test cold-weather
clothing, his team commandeered a frosty building in Lawrence, Mass.,
that was built to freeze-clean wool. For experiments on shoes, they
trekked to a Virginia track rigged with gravel, concrete, mud,
bricks, logs and a stream. Other researchers journeyed to Alaska,
Indiana or Ohio to conduct work.</TE>
<TE>   When the war ended, Doriot lobbied for a centralized research
center. An "institute of man," he called it. After Congress ponied up
$11 million for the project, Pentagon officials reviewed 278
proposals from 40 states and decided to build the lab in Natick,
Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Long before the Army arrived, Natick had a reputation for
quirkiness. Founded by Puritan missionaries in 1651, the town was
built as a "praying Indian" village where Native American converts
could live in wigwams on suburban-style plots of land. The original
residents helped draft the first Indian translation of the Bible.
Other innovations followed.</TE>
<TE>   In 1858, the first modern baseball was created and manufactured in
the town. In 1949, General Electric chose Natick as the site for its
"House of the Future," a showcase residence outfitted with such
newfangled conveniences as the television, air-conditioner, garbage
disposal, dishwasher and Stratoliner oven.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the military that jolted the tiny suburb into the Space
Age. Before the lab, Natick was a slumbering hamlet of 19,600 set
amid farms, orchards and an old-fashioned downtown dominated by a
Grandmother's Mincemeat factory, a saw manufacturer and the old
baseball plant (later converted to condos). The future Army base was
a wooded grove known for its juicy blueberry patch. "No one was keen
on losing that," says lifetime resident Dorothy Deslongchamps, 67.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere slowly shifted once the lab opened in 1954. One
sign was the local high school science fair, where student
experiments veered into such arcane territory as "radioisotopes in
agriculture" and "loss of effectiveness of DDT and chlordane on body
lice and cockroaches."</TE>
<TE>   For residents accustomed to knowing each other by name, the lab
also brought lots of unfamiliar faces. (Today, the lab employs 1,000
people, mostly civilians, and the town's population has swelled to
32,170.)</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most fabled new arrival was explorer Wilkins, a
swashbuckling Australian whose pre-Natick feats included the first
airplane flight over the North Pole and the first submarine voyage
under the Arctic cap. He also achieved renown as a combat
photographer during World War I, strapping himself to an airplane
wing to snap pictures, says Paul Dalrymple, a retired Army scientist
who worked with Wilkins.</TE>
<TE>   The daredevilry continued at the Natick Labs. After developing a
prototype flameproof suit, Wilkins tested it himself by walking into
a roaring gasoline fire. And when someone stuffed an experimental
sleeping bag with processed chicken feathers, it was Wilkins who got
poked by the policeman's nightstick while trying it out.</TE>
<TE>   Fittingly, the arctic chamber in Natick's climate simulation
building was named after Wilkins following his death in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   Other early researchers shared his penchant for unorthodox testing
methods. During World War II, when Doriot's team was tinkering with a
bulletproof vest made from glass and nylon, two Navy officers
regularly volunteered to try it out. "One would get up [and] put the
vest on, and the other one would take a revolver out and shoot at
him," Doriot recalled in a 1977 speech.</TE>
<TE>   Endrusick adds: "There were no rules back then. No oversight
committees or safety regulations."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, some of Natick's experiments got mighty weird.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1960s, scientists tried to figure out if sunscreen
could shield soldiers from radiation. So they rubbed some lotion onto
anesthetized pigs and herded them into the lab's solar furnace, a
curved mirror the size of a drive-in theater screen (now located in
White Sands, N.M.) that focused the sun's rays so intensely it could
burn holes through blocks of metal. "That wouldn't be allowed today,"
Endrusick says.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, researchers zapped a bunch of flying cockroaches with
ultraviolet radiation in a pest control experiment that went awry.
According to a recent story in the Boston Globe, the bugs were then
shoveled into plastic garbage bags, doused with carbon tetrachloride
(a liquid pesticide) and shipped to the town dump.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, the carbon tetrachloride dissolved the bags and, within a
few months, surrounding homes were crawling with jumbo roaches. Marco
Kaltofen, a local environmental activist and amateur town historian,
says it took six months of daily DDT and chlordane spraying to
eradicate what he refers to as the "Attack of the Mutant Giant
Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches."</TE>
<TE>   Partly because of such incidents, nobody was too shocked in the
early 1990s when groundwater beneath the lab was revealed to be a
soup of toxic chemicals. Natick was designated a Superfund cleanup
site in 1994, and the Army is shelling out nearly $1 million a year
to decontaminate the area, a task expected to continue for at least
27 more years, according to the Boston Globe.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than that, the lab is a pretty good neighbor," says Jay
Ball, one of Natick's five town selectmen. "For the most part, it's
like they're not even there. They have a very low profile."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, jumbo winged cockroaches aren't the only things that
military research has produced for mankind. Napoleon launched the
canning industry in the late 1700s by offering 12,000 francs to
anyone who could develop a reliable method of food preservation for
his troops. Likewise, margarine was invented at the behest of
Napoleon's nephew, who needed a butter substitute for the French navy
in 1870.</TE>
<TE>   Natick's legacy is far more extensive. When astronaut John Glenn
orbited Earth in 1962, he squeezed dinner from an aluminum toothpaste
tube of applesauce prepared by Natick chefs. (The lab's current tube
menu--which includes sloppy Joes, clam chowder and toffee pudding--is
still used by Air Force U2 pilots.) Natick also supplied NASA with
freeze-dried salads, sandwiches and ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   However, the military denies responsibility for Tang.
"We're always given credit for that," says Jerry Darsch, director of
Natick's food lab. "But General Foods invented it."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Lachance, a Rutgers nutrition professor who ran NASA's
space-food program, says Natick was his "right arm" for feeding
Mercury and Gemini crews. The lab's work paved the way for the
backpacking food industry, he adds.</TE>
<TE>   Chicken McNuggets and McRibs also owe their existence to the Army.
"Whether Natick is the official grandfather of McNuggets, I don't
know," says William Benjy Mikel, a food science professor at the
University of Kentucky. "But the lab did a lot of early research in
the field of 'restructured' meats," the technology McDonald's later
made famous.</TE>
<TE>   The forerunner to today's energy bars was a chocolate-and-kerosene
concoction devised in 1937 by Paul Logan, an Army colonel at the
Quartermaster's Food &amp; Container Institute, which later became part
of Natick. The idea was to create a compact food source for
emergencies. Working with the Hershey chocolate company, Logan added
raw oat flour to keep the bar from melting in tropical weather--and a
splash of kerosene to discourage GIs from eating the bar as a snack.
The kerosene was soon removed, but Logan needn't have worried about
troops eating the candy in nonemergencies. Even without petroleum
additives, the bar "had a tendency on occasion to produce headaches
and nausea," according to Army archives, which offered no further
details.</TE>
<TE>   Natick officials also boast of the military's role in developing
Spam, M&amp;Ms, freeze-dried coffee and process cheese spreads, among
other things. However, some of the claims are subject to dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Although Spam was a staple of GI rations during World War II, most
experts say the Army had nothing to do with inventing it in 1937.
Darsch, Natick's food lab chief, agrees: "I'm not sure we want to
take credit for Spam."</TE>
<TE>   The origin of M&amp;Ms is tougher to pin down. Official Mars Inc. lore
says candy baron Forrest Mars Sr. got the idea while visiting Spain
during the Spanish Civil War. After watching soldiers gobble "pellets
of chocolate encased in a hard sugary coating," he returned home to
formulate M&amp;Ms in 1941. Other sources suggest Mars copied Smarties, a
British candy introduced in 1937. Natick officials offer a third
story: The Army asked Mars to develop a chocolate product that would
melt in your mouth, not in your desert sands.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure if our urban legend is more valid than theirs,"
Darsch says. "But we talk to Mars people at various trade shows and
they have never disagreed with our story." (Mars officials didn't
respond to a Times request for comment.)</TE>
<TE>   On the coffee and cheese fronts, Natick might be on firmer ground.
Although the history of freeze-dried java and non-refrigerated cheese
spreads is hazy, several sources indicate the Army commissioned
research in the field.</TE>
<TE>   Possible embellishments aside, it's clear the lab has played
a major role in food research, especially in perfecting food
irradiation. The latest breakthrough is the "indestructible
sandwich." Similar in taste and appearance to the Hot Pockets
sandwiches sold in supermarkets, Natick's tangy barbecue chicken
recipe has the added benefit of being able to endure 80-degree
temperatures for three years without spoiling.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers spent eons plotting how to stop the barbecue sauce
from making the bread soggy. "We took the sandwiches to hospitals and
ran MRIs on them to check moisture activity," Darsch says.</TE>
<TE>   More oddities are in the pipeline, including a prototype combat
uniform that would give soldiers Superman-style eyesight and jumping
ability. The bulletproof suit would also include wrist-mounted
weapons fired by voice command and battery-powered T-shirts
containing miniature heaters and air-conditioners. Sensors would
monitor the soldier's vital signs, warning him if he gets dehydrated
or needs to load up on food.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these gizmos already exist; others await advances in
nanotechnology, a budding field in which atoms and molecules are
altered to give a material new properties. For instance, clothing
fibers could be engineered to sense their surroundings and change
colors to blend in. And eyesight could be enhanced by implanting
microscopic night-vision devices in human eyes.</TE>
<TE>   The ability to jump over walls in a single bound might come from
energy-storing shoes, according to a March press release from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which is working on military
nanotechnology with Natick, DuPont and Raytheon.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine the psychological impact upon a foe when encountering
squads of seemingly invincible warriors protected by armor and
endowed with superhuman capabilities," said MIT nanotechnology
apostle Edwin Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, sophisticated gadgetry can't do everything. That's why
Natick's John Munroe wants to find a courage pill. During a study of
war games in Louisiana, he says, researchers noticed that 10% of the
soldiers made 90% of the kills.</TE>
<TE>   If a chemical to reduce fear were synthesized, GIs would be far
more effective, he reasons. "You can give our guys all these neat
gadgets, but if they get out there and freeze under fire, it's all
useless," says Munroe, whose Natick ID card hangs from a neck strap
that reads, "Nowhere to hide."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just about how much high-tech stuff we have," he
concludes. "It's about who we are inside."</TE>

<HD>Working With This Test Dummy Is No Sweat</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ROY RIVENBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not every Natick Lab employee is human.</LD>
<LD>   One of the oldest staffers is a $386,000 copper dummy nicknamed
Uncle Wiggly because of the jerky motions he makes when programmed to
march. Wired to computers and heated to human skin temperature, the
dummy tests the insulation of clothing and sleeping bags. Natick
researchers have hauled Uncle Wiggly to mountaintops, deserts,
jungles and the coast of Florida, where he evaluated wetsuits.</LD>
<LD>   The dummy even posed for a Vogue fashion shoot in the 1980s.</LD>
<TE>   "The manikins are great employees," says scientist Thomas
Endrusick, who also supervises two copper feet and a fiberglass hand
for testing boots and gloves. "They come to work every day; they
never complain."</TE>
<TE>   Using data from the dummies, Natick researchers can gauge how
humans will hold up under virtually any weather conditions. In 1982,
when the wind-chill factor in Cincinnati hit 59 below zero before an
NFL playoff between the host Bengals and the San Diego Chargers,
league commissioner Pete Rozelle phoned Natick scientist Ralph
Goldman to ask if it was dangerous to play.</TE>
<TE>   Don't worry, Goldman advised. If the sun is out and heated benches
are installed on the sidelines, the players will be fine. The game
went on, with the Bengals winning, 27-7.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Uncle Wiggly's days might be numbered. Natick
honchos recently met with a salesman who demonstrated a
state-of-the-art fake leg (the rest of the body is still under
construction) that can be programmed to sweat Evian water through
millions of tiny pores. In contrast, Uncle Wiggly must wear a layer
of water-soaked cotton to simulate sweating. (Scientists track the
evaporation rate to test a fabric's "breathability.")</TE>
<TE>   The new model, called Adam, has 150 individually controlled sweat
zones and a simulated lung system that mimics the humidity of
breathing.</TE>
<TE>   Adam can be programmed to react as a male or female of any body
type.</TE>
<TE>   "We're contemplating buying it," says Endrusick, who adds that the
sweating-dummy industry is bustling (it even held an international
convention in Switzerland last year).</TE>

<LD>Walk down any of the lab's endless hallways, open a random door and
something weird usually turns up. Here's a sampling of Natick
projects--past, present and pipe dream.</LD>
<LD>   The Biscuit Machine Gun: Proposed in 1962, the
"Automatic Rapid-Fire Biscuit-Shooting Oven" was supposed to reduce
biscuit baking time from seven hours to 45 minutes. Soldiers could wheel
it to the front lines, pour in water and dough mix, and biscuits would
pop out the other end.</LD>
<LD>   The Portable Village: Outfitted with Ping-Pong tables, big-screen
TV, laundry machines and a gift shop, this 550-person military base
can be airlifted anywhere in the world and set up in two weeks. "It
offers soldiers a slice of home," says project supervisor Michael
Hope. Thirteen tent cities are already in use, each guzzling 2,200
gallons of diesel fuel and 15,000 gallons of water per day. One
spinoff of the portable city: the portable multi-faith chapel
equipped with camouflage Bibles and digital hymn machine.</LD>
<TE>   Algae-Filled Mashed Potatoes: In the early 1960s, Army scientists
considered a plan to stretch food supplies by blending protein-rich
algae into noodles, soup and mashed potatoes. In recent years, Natick
has completely overhauled military combat menus, adding such items as
burritos, vegetarian pastas and Jamaican pork chops. How do they
taste? A Popular Mechanics writer commented: "Napoleon is reputed to
have mumbled something about an army traveling on its stomach. Had
his troops dined on [Natick's food], you might be reading this in
French."</TE>
<TE>   Spray-On Clothes: A waterproof but breathable fiber that sprays
onto any surface. The result: a "second skin" that also breaks down
toxic chemicals. Heidi Schreuder-Gibson, a chemist who previously
brewed rocket fuel for the Air Force, hopes to have a prototype in
five years.</TE>
<TE>   Inflatable Surgery Center: A Humvee with a rear compartment that
inflates into a biochemical-proof emergency room. Patients enter
through a decontamination tube after removing their clothes and being
spritzed with a light bleaching solution. Scheduled to go into
service this year.</TE>
<TE>   Pseudo Mt. Everest: An altitude chamber that can simulate
elevations up to 30,000 feet. Used for studying the effects of
altitude on equipment and soldiers, the chamber includes a $100,000
toilet. (The vacuum-system commode is necessary because air-pressure
differences with outside sewage networks would cause a regular toilet
to spew its contents.) Scientists use the chamber to answer questions
from the field. For example, if it takes 20 people two days to set up
base camp at normal elevations, it will take 24 people for the task
in Afghanistan because the high altitude will sideline two of every
10 soldiers with pounding headaches from mountain sickness. In 1999,
the chamber was used to replicate conditions aboard a disabled,
sunken submarine.</TE>
<TE>   The Food Patch: Officially known as the "Transdermal Nutrient
Delivery System," this device would send nutrients directly into the
bloodstream of soldiers on the run. Natick hired 3M, makers of the
nicotine patch, to study feasibility.</TE>
<TE>   Fake Peasant Footprint Boot: A Vietnam-era shoe with a sole that
created footprints resembling a peasant's bare foot. A prototype was
made, but the concept was rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Bulletproof Spiders: A strand of spider silk as thick as a pencil
could stop a Boeing 747 in flight. But attempts to harvest the fibers
from captive spiders have failed because arachnids are notoriously
cannibalistic. Natick has helped research ways to duplicate the silk
in a laboratory. Possible uses: bulletproof vests, artificial
tendons, parachute cords.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellaneous: Other Natick testing facilities include a rain
room; climate chambers with wind tunnels; a simulated parachute drop
machine; a biomechanics lab for measuring stress on the body from
backpacks, helmets and shoes; and a laser body scanner for
custom-fitted uniforms.</TE>

<LD>I am at my desk--but I'm not. I have been away--but I have never
left.</LD>
<LD>   I have, as you may have guessed, just returned from vacation.</LD>
<LD>   That vacant stare? It is not concentration. What it is, is a
vacant stare.</LD>
<TE>   That telephone I just answered? It wasn't my phone ringing.</TE>
<TE>   Still, I am trying to review the events of the past few weeks. But
it is difficult to differentiate between reality and heat
wave-induced ravings.</TE>
<TE>   Thought is a dull thud.</TE>
<TE>   Communication is a garbled whine.</TE>
<TE>   Memory is a purple haze.</TE>
<TE>   Was George W. Bush's likeness added to the lineup of presidents on
Mt. Rushmore? I'm sure I saw such a photo. I mean, I knew he was
popular, but wow.</TE>
<TE>   And was Sen. Lieberman really hanging out in front of a giant cow
carved out of butter at the Iowa State Fair?</TE>
<TE>   (You know, perhaps the time has come to add the summer gin and
tonic to the list of things best avoided.)</TE>
<TE>   If the Lieberman sighting is true, though, it is cause for
concern.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, it is probably not a good idea to have a
presidential primary system that places so much political power in
the hands of people who carve giant cows out of butter.</TE>
<TE>   For another, it is a fresh indication that Sen. Lieberman, despite
our pleas that he come back to us--remember "Hot Tub Woman?"--is
still suffering from a raging case of Potomac Fever.</TE>
<TE>   But then again, maybe none of this happened.</TE>
<TE>   When you take a break from the real world, the news tends to get
jumbled, fuzzy, surreal:</TE>
<TE>   Did major league baseball players, multimillionaires who can't
chew tobacco without drooling juice all over themselves, vote to go
on strike?</TE>
<TE>   Did 75,000 Elvis fans show up in Memphis to commemorate the 25th
anniversary of the King of Rock 'n' Roll's--some say death, I like to
believe--disappearance?</TE>
<TE>   Was there an economic summit, and was it in Waco?</TE>
<TE>   Did a doctor in Boston really leave a patient on the operating
table while he went to the bank to cash his paycheck?</TE>
<TE>   And tell me this was just a bad-clam hallucination. We may soon
have an airline called "Hooters' Air?" (Talk about friendly skies.)</TE>
<TE>   You know what:</TE>
<TE>   Put the lime in the coconut and call me in the morning.</TE>

<LD>Proving again that a parking lot can be a chic gathering place,
Project Angel Food presented its annual awards benefit behind its
West Hollywood headquarters and raked in $400,000 to feed people
disabled by HIV/AIDS.</LD>
<LD>   Recognized at the gala for their support of the organization were
actor Eric McCormack, star of NBC-TV's "Will &amp; Grace"; his wife,
Janet McCormack; and television producer-philanthropist Loreen Arbus.</LD>
<LD>   More than 600 guests swept along a red carpet to the party scene,
where the asphalt was camouflaged with black AstroTurf, the dinner
tables were topped with pots of fruit and sunflowers, and the
stage--where headliner Jennifer Holliday performed--was framed with
sculpted hedges.</LD>
<TE>   "What we love about this organization is its immediacy," said Eric
McCormack, who plays Will on the popular TV sitcom. "It puts smiles
on the faces, and meals in the stomachs of people who need it right
now."</TE>
<TE>   Arbus, whose gift of $150,000 earlier this year marked the largest
individual donation in the organization's 13-year history, said she
wanted to "support the basic needs of life."</TE>
<TE>   "Since 9/11, more than ever I am wanting to put food on the tables
of those who would otherwise not be able to eat," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Using food prepared at its facility, the organization's 100
volunteers bring one large luncheon daily to 1,200 HIV/AIDS patients
in Los Angeles County, said John Gile, executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Guests included TV star Camryn Manheim (of ABC's "The Practice")
who said that Project Angel Food was a favorite charity. "I could
just burst into tears talking about this compassionate organization,"
she said. "It says everything good about humanity."</TE>
<TE>   Guests dined on South American-themed fare while they watched the
awards ceremony and a concert by the Tony Award-winning Holliday, who
thrilled partygoers with a gospel rendition of "America the
Beautiful" and her famous "And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going" from
her Broadway role in "Dream Girls." Nancy Lovett and Dante Di Loreto
were co-chairs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mancini Musicale</TE>
<TE>   "I want to talk to you as a singer," Academy Award-winning actor
Kevin Spacey told the crowd gathered to honor Phil Ramone, legendary
recording industry producer-engineer, at the Mancini Musicale at
UCLA's Royce Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "Phil and I have been quietly working for the past year on my
preparation to play Bobby Darin" in a film, Spacey said. "And I've
got to tell you what it's like to be in a studio with Phil
Ramone--it's like having a great chef, a rich interpreter, your
daddy, a psychiatrist ... this is what he's probably done for every
artist he has worked with in his extraordinary career."</TE>
<TE>   Then Spacey, head cocked and fingers snapping, broke into an a
capella version of "I Found a New Baby," a la '50s pop idol, Darin.
"Without Dr. Phil--the real Dr. Phil--I wouldn't have had the guts to
do that," Spacey said.</TE>
<TE>   The actor's appearance at the Aug. 17 benefit that raised $220,000
for the Henry Mancini Institute was a surprise to Ramone, who was
there to receive the Hank Award. The award-- given annually to an
artist who, besides having a successful musical career, regularly
mentors aspiring musicians--is named for Mancini, composer of such
pop standards as "Moon River."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm choked up," said Ramone, an impresario who has worked with
Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Billy Joel and Paul McCartney. "This
honor is one of the greatest thrills I've ever had."</TE>
<TE>   About 350 guests paid $275 each to dine on the Ahmanson Terrace
before enjoying the musicale featuring the Henry Mancini Institute
Orchestra under the baton of artistic director Patrick Williams.
Included on the program: a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald by singer Patti
Austin and a performance by jazz pianist Gerald Clayton.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, the institute presents scholarships to emerging
professional musicians who, for four weeks, train with Williams on
the UCLA campus, said Ginny Mancini, president. "We must nurture the
next generation of musicians or we won't have any good music at all."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Women of Action</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney Nancy G. Haffner received a standing ovation
at the seventh annual Women of Action Luncheon benefiting the Israel
Cancer Research Fund. And not only because she was an honoree.</TE>
<TE>   Haffner was in the middle of her acceptance speech at the Beverly
Hills Hotel when a phone call came from actress and breast cancer
survivor Diahann Carroll--on the bill to receive the group's Lifetime
Achievement Award--who, only days before, had canceled due to another
commitment. Haffner stepped away from the podium as Carroll's
apologies were piped into the ballroom.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, she returned to the stage to pick up where she left
off, when the 450 guests rose to their feet to applaud her
sportsmanship.</TE>
<TE>   Also honored for community leadership were urologist Jennifer R.
Berman and her sister, therapist Laura A. Berman--co-directors of the
Female Sexual Medical Center at UCLA--and business management
consultant Julie C. Miller.</TE>
<TE>   The Aug. 14 event raised $80,000 for cancer research.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of the Israel Cancer Research Fund is to provide
"critical cancer research by Israel's scientists," Jaqueline Bell,
board chairwoman of the fund's Los Angeles chapter, told guests.</TE>
<TE>   "Why Israel? Because Israel has the highest population of
scientists and physicians in the free world, but not the financial
means to support their research," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is crucial that we support them so this precious medical
resource will not be wasted."</TE>
<TE>   Event co-chairwomen were Norma Fink and Joyce Harris.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<LD>"Mom, aren't we going away this summer?" Rachel asked as she set the
table for dinner.</LD>
<LD>   "Yes," her mother answered. "Last night Dad and I decided we'd go
away next week."</LD>
<LD>   "Where are we going?" asked Rachel's brother, Matt.</LD>
<TE>   Their mother smiled. "I'm not supposed to tell you. Dad told me to
give you this."</TE>
<TE>   She handed Matt an envelope.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel giggled. "I know," she said, "it's a crossword puzzle."</TE>
<TE>   Matt nodded and pulled the puzzle and a note out of the envelope.</TE>
<TE>   He read the note aloud.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Rachel and Matt,</TE>
<TE>   It's time for vacation. Solve this crossword puzzle to know what
we are doing and where we are going.</TE>
<TE>   Love,</TE>
<TE>   Dad</TE>
<TE>   "I'll get a pencil," Rachel said. "Matt, you read the clues."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel got a pencil and sat down at the table.</TE>
<TE>   Matt handed her the crossword puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   "First clue," Matt said. "No. 1 down: It takes two batteries to
make it shine."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel laughed. "That's easy!" she said, And she printed
f-l-a-s-h-l-i-g-h-t in the proper spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "Good!" Matt said. "Are you ready for the next clue?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes." Rachel nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "All right," Matt said. "No. 2 across: A circus has a big one, but
nobody sleeps in it."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel frowned.</TE>
<TE>   Matt counted the spaces. "I know," he said. "It's tent.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I know what we're doing!" Rachel said. "Read the next
clue, Matt."</TE>
<TE>   "No. 4 across." Matt said. "These are fun to toast over a fire."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel bounced in her chair.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm right!" she said. She printed the answer where it belonged.
"We're going camping!"</TE>
<TE>   "Now let's find out where," Matt said. "No. 3 down: It's bigger
than a pond, but not as big as an ocean."</TE>
<TE>   "That's a lake!" Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   Matt nodded. Then he said, "Last clue. No. 2 down: Some of it is
in California and some in Nevada."</TE>
<TE>   "I know where we're going!" Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   "So do I!" said Matt.</TE>
<TE>   Do you know where Rachel and Matt are going?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Answers to puzzle: 1 down, "flashlight"; 2 across, "tent"; 4
across, "marshmallows"; 3 down, "lake"; 2 down, "Tahoe."</TE>
<TE>   Sue Alexander has gone on several summer vacations to the same

<HD>By Looks of Things, He'll Take Manhattan</HD>

<LD>What's a macho stock car driver doing with Drakkar Noir cologne as a
sponsor?</LD>
<LD>   When Jack Wiswall, president of L'Oreal USA was looking to
rejuvenate the Drakkar brand, he said, "People told us, if you want
the 18-35 demographics, you have to have Dale Jr."</LD>
<LD>   So Dale Earnhardt Jr. is showing up these days at perfume counters
wearing a black T-shirt and jeans, causing stampedes.</LD>
<TE>   "He's been fantastic," Wiswall said after a chorus of screams
greeted the Winston Cup driver at the Herald Square Macy's in
Manhattan as he worked his way through a police escort and a squad of
bodyguards. "He's a special kid, very gentle. He speaks well, he
looks the part. He's cool."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: The last time the Boston Red Sox won a World Series
was 1918. Who were their winning pitchers?</TE>
<TE>   The way it's done: Curt Schilling has won 21 games and has walked
only 20 batters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's command," the Arizona Diamondback pitcher explained.
"Control is the ability to throw strikes. In the big leagues,
everybody has control. Command is the ability to throw quality
strikes. And when you add preparation to command, good things will
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Schilling has a compact disc on which he records of every pitch he
has thrown to a major league batter. He even keeps track of each
umpire's strike zone.</TE>
<TE>   Opening day: Since 1978, of the 330 NFL teams that won their
opening games, 176 went to the playoffs and 95 won division titles.
Of the 330 losers, 76 went to the playoffs and 42 won division
titles.</TE>
<TE>   That was Chick: Times reader Gordon Grigg saw Chick Hearn and his
wife Marge standing in line at the post office on White Oak Avenue in
Encino a few months ago. When the person in charge learned that the
Hearns were there, he came out and offered to move them to the front
of the line. Hearn said no, thanks, that they'd just wait in line
like everybody else.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) plans to introduce a bill to
have that post office named after Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   Working tradition: Ron Adamson is quarterback of Mount Union,
winner of the last two Division III national titles. Besides throwing
passes and running the offense, Adamson washes the team's uniforms.
It's a tradition at the Alliance (Ohio) school, which offers no
athletic scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Ballard, quarterback of the 1993 Purple Raiders, started
washing uniforms. Every starting quarterback since has performed the
task.</TE>
<TE>   "They all want the job now," said Ballard, now quarterback of the
Indiana Firebirds in the Arena Football League.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Babe Ruth and Carl Mays. Ruth beat the Chicago
Cubs, 1-0, in the first game and 3-2 in the fourth. Mays won the
third and fifth games.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Nebraska's cheerleaders have been grounded. No more
acrobatics and tumbling across the end zone. A new policy prohibits
off-the-ground stunts to reduce injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big disappointment," said Kellie Bowman, co-captain of the
Cornhuskers' Spirit Squad. "Cheerleading has been more than just
standing there, waving pompoms."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Nebraska agreed to a $2.1-million settlement with a
former cheerleader paralyzed in a 1996 accident.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>He may not be living as large as Jann Wenner, but in L.A.'s hip-hop
publishing scene, Meshack Blaq is the man. Blaq started Kronick, an
underground chronicle of hip-hop culture, out of his West Adams home
office in 1994. Eight years later, his staff of one (himself) has
swelled to seven, and advertisers such as Universal and Nike are
booking space in the 60-page, bimonthly 'zine distributed free in
record stores across the city and beyond. Rapping with Mr. Blaq, 36,
it's clear that when it comes to hip-hop, he means business.</LD>
<LD>   What sets Kronick apart from bigger music magazines?</LD>
<LD>   The respect I get from the artists. They give me more of
themselves than they would a mainstream publication because they see
me handling things from top to bottom. The Source and Vibe are good
examples of [hip-hop] magazines well-staffed with black people, but
the name at the top is white. That means we're seeing the culture
through white spectacles. That's where I come in.</LD>
<TE>   What do you think about whites trying to be "down" with hip-hop?</TE>
<TE>   I love it. I call hip-hop a Martin Luther King type of music,
because it brings everyone together. It's also an equal opportunity
"disser" in that if you have skills, you get respect, like Eminem.
Then there are the kids, like the ones parodied in the movie "White
Boyz," who watch music videos to see how kids [in the 'hood] are
living, and try to portray that lifestyle. But the biggest consumers
of this music are white boys in the suburbs. They are our biggest
supporters, so how can I be angry with that?</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, what are the most important changes you've seen in
the art form?</TE>
<TE>   Going from a handful of records coming out a year, to thousands a
year. That means opportunities for someone like myself, or a music
video director, or even a dancer, to make a good living.</TE>
<TE>   Indie publishing is precarious, to say the least, yet you've been
at it for more than a decade. What makes Meshack run?</TE>
<TE>   I'm a role model to my son, and to kids who see me walking up and
down the street each day--in my dreadlocks, not in a suit--doing my
own thing. It's important that they see that whatever they want to
do, they can do it. And it's not just being in front of the camera,
rapping to a beat. You can be behind the camera, with the rappers,
and make money.</TE>
<TE>   You've got some fat ad accounts for a regional 'zine. How'd you
hustle that?</TE>
<TE>   I'm internationally accepted, nationally recognized, and locally
respected . . . and if you keep banging on the door asking for
scraps, eventually they'll come around.</TE>
<TE>   What's the biggest problem you run into as a black indie
publisher?</TE>
<TE>   Getting major advertisers to take me seriously. The other thing
is, I really try to get artists, athletes and entertainers who aren't
black in order to broaden the scope of my magazine, but many of
them--or the people who represent them--don't want to open themselves
up to a black publication. Hip-hop is not a segregated culture, but I
get turned down more often than not by a Stephen Dorff or a Jay Mohr.</TE>
<TE>   Where are the best L.A. spots to observe rappers in their natural
habitat?</TE>
<TE>   The Beverly Center, the W Hotel in Westwood, House of Blues, The
Highlands, and The Conga Room on Thursday nights.</TE>
<TE>   The hottest slanguage right now seems to be "chuuch." Please
define.</TE>
<TE>   It's some pimp language from the Midwest. It basically means, it's
all good, all gravy, everything is taken care of. It's like when you
raise your glass and say "L'Chaim!"</TE>
<TE>   What would make your life "chuuch"?</TE>
<TE>   Putting out a million copies of my free 'zine. I'd be like the
black Hugh Hefner.</TE>

<DH>Seas Salts Are the Food World's Latest Commodity</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES PURVIANCE</AU>
<BD>Jamie Purviance's latest book is ''Weber's Big Book of
Grilling.''</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Without it, our nerves would misfire, our muscles would cramp and our
blood would thicken. Of course, most Americans eat so much more salt
than we need that the chance of suffering from a lack of it is close
to nil. In fact, the trend today is toward more salt--more kinds,
colors and origins.</LD>
<LD>   All salts come from the sea, though some of them from ancient,
dried-up seas that today are trapped underground. The salt mined from
these underground deposits is called rock salt. Ordinary table salt
is a ground and refined rock salt with the addition of an anti-caking
agent and, sometimes, iodine (a trace element that prevents goiter).
Kosher salt is a refined rock salt without additives, and it is
commonly used in restaurants because it has none of the bitter
metallic flavor of ordinary table salt.</LD>
<LD>   Sea salt is not rock salt. It comes directly from the sea, often
from shallow pools along the coastline where the water evaporates and
leaves large-grained crystals. The sea salts from Brittany and
Normandy, with their subtly sweet taste of pristine oceans, have been
the darlings of chefs for decades, yet lately salt fanatics are
talking about salt sources as distant as South Africa, Sicily and
South Korea.</LD>
<TE>   Many of these sea salts now retail for more than $50 per pound,
begging the question: Are they really worth the price? You have to be
suspicious when you read the back labels and find stories like the
one about an ancient ocean trapped under Peru feeding a spring 10,000
feet high in the Andes, which evaporates into terraced pools located
in the Sacred Valley of the Incas. Talk about romanticizing sodium
chloride! Or how about the red and black Hawaiian sea salts that
incorporate the color and taste of red clay and prehistoric beds of
lava? It seems laughable that after thousands of years of trying to
make salt white, connoisseurs now pay extra for colors.</TE>
<TE>   In the highfalutin food world, nothing today is as trendy as salt.
Like cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oils were in the 1980s, sea
salts are all the rage, and gourmets are giddy about the nuances in
Celtic gray salt, Indian black salt, Danish smoked salt and many
others. For the ultimate cachet, it is hard to beat fleur de sel.
This is the ''flower of salt,'' created when conditions are just
right in the checkerboard of pools on France's Atlantic coast. If the
wind blows steadily and the sun beats hot on the water, delicate
flakes of salt bloom along the surface. Years ago, salt farmers broke
through the network of fleur de sel because it slowed the evaporation
of the brine below, but today they carefully skim off the moist,
glittering crystals and sell them for almost twice the price of most
other sea salts.</TE>
<TE>   I must admit that I am smitten by the taste of pure sea salts. I
keep a few kinds in my kitchen cabinet and sprinkle a pinch on my
food just as I am getting ready to serve it. The tiny bursts of
crystallized saline on salads or roasted meats have an infinitely
better quality than ordinary salt, or even kosher salt. But when you
get right down to the chemistry, it is startling how little
difference there is between them. Ordinary salt is 99% sodium
chloride. Sea salt is 99.99% sodium chloride. And the difference
between sea salts of all kinds amounts to about .01 of a percent. So
I guess the proverbial drop in the bucket is worth more than the
bucket and everything else inside.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Roasted Rack of Lamb with Rosemary, Shallots and Sea Salt</TE>
<TE>   (Serves 4 )</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon sea salt</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon finely chopped shallots</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 frenched, trimmed racks of lamb, each about 1 pound and 7 to 8
ribs</TE>
<TE>   In a medium bowl, combine the balsamic vinegar with 1/4 teaspoon
of sea salt. Whisk to dissolve the salt. Add the oil, rosemary,
shallots, mustard and pepper. Whisk to create a smooth paste. Evenly
cover the lamb meat on both sides with the paste.</TE>
<TE>   Set a large skillet over high heat. When the skillet is very hot,
sear both racks of lamb, fat side down, until browned, 2 to 3
minutes. Turn the racks over and put the pan in a 375-degree oven.
Roast to the desired doneness, 15 to 20 minutes for medium-rare.
Transfer the racks to a cutting board; allow to rest for about 3
minutes. Cut into chops. Season with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of
sea salt, or more to taste. Serve warm.</TE>

<HD>Chasen's: The Legend Continues</HD>
<DH>The Storied Restaurant is Still a Movie Star Haunt</DH>

<LD>Like errant tankers and small planes drawn inexorably into the
Bermuda Triangle, the famous, the lovely and the powerful still feel
the centrifugal pull at the intersection of Beverly and Doheny, home
of the original Chasen's restaurant. L.A.'s ultimate celebrity
watering hole is today a Bristol Farms market in West Hollywood, but
the old glamour lives on in the Bristol Cafe, a small eatery between
the deli and the sushi bar where customers can slide into an original
Chasen's booth and order the famous Chasen's chili, a household word
since 1962, when Elizabeth Taylor had 10 quarts shipped to Rome
during the filming of "Cleopatra." "Ronald Reagan proposed to Nancy
where we now have the cheese area," says store director Louis
Fajardo.</LD>
<TE>   The barbecue stand opened by vaudeville entertainer Dave Chasen in
1936 became a hangout for W.C. Fields, John Barrymore, Clark Gable
and James Cagney. An expanded Chasen's later became the place to
party after the Academy Awards; regulars over the years have included
Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, Greta Garbo, Frank Sinatra, Humphrey
Bogart, Lucille Ball and Howard Hughes. Chasen's wife Maude once
boasted that she hosted "every president since 1936 except Roosevelt.
And Mrs.Roosevelt came." After her husband's death in 1973, Maude
Chasen carried on until the original Chasen's closed its doors on
April 1, 1995. Most of the silverware, fixtures, barstools and sinks
were auctioned in October 1999; Bristol Farms opened in November
2000.</TE>
<TE>   But the restaurant's proud heritage as a discreet but convivial
celebrity oasis is still alive at Beverly and Doheny. Fajardo says
the store draws a lot of famous traffic, but won't name names beyond
the cryptic hint that "if you were a young man and had a pop idol,
you'd see her coming in here." Bristol Farms also maintains the
Chasen's ban on media lenses. "We chase away paparazzi when
celebrities are shopping," Fajardo says. The store sells newspapers
and magazines, but tabloids are strictly taboo. "It's company
policy," Fajardo says. "We want them to feel comfortable. Some come
in with sunglasses and their hats pulled down." On the other hand,
Bristol Farms has an agreement with MTV for shooting "The Osbournes"
during family shopping forays, and the market has been a location for
scenes from the HBO program "Six Feet Under." Nancy Reagan, who
entertained former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at
Chasen's as recently as 1995, has been spotted having lunch at
Bristol Cafe.</TE>
<TE>   A few original Chasen's lights and doors are also still on the
premises, along with the knotty pine paneling and--according to
neighborhood lore--the shades of ghostly regulars from beyond the
grave. Fajardo admits that employees have reported hearing shopping
carts going down the aisles when the store is closed, and grocery
manager Pablo Solis says some of his night crew have been spooked.
"Our former night maintenance man said a woman in white tapped him on
the shoulder and said, 'Excuse me. It's dirty inside in the
restaurant and the tables need to be cleaned.' She just disappeared.
He looked in and the tables hadn't been cleared. He was really
scared." Fajardo prefers to downplay the "haunted Chasen's" rumors,
but when it comes to the mystique, he's a believer. "A legend never
dies."</TE>

<LD>INVITED TO: Chrysalis Foundation's First Annual Butterfly Ball at the
Green Acres Estate in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<TE>   WHERE THE BUTTERFLIES ROAM: "I'm really excited. All of this is my
idea," says actress Rebecca Gayheart, acting hostess at this
Venetian-style summer ball. The lush setting is merely the backyard
of supermarket magnate Ron Burkle's palatial Mediterranean spread. As
Gayheart tells it, "I basically stalked him until he agreed to
provide his house for free." Burkle's abode remains off-limits for
the duration, but the exterior is impressive enough. "It's like
another league--a beautiful home," comments actor Owen Wilson. "I
think I could put my house in the Jacuzzi," adds Russell Simmons, Def
Jam co-founder and a co-honoree tonight along with Universal Pictures
production presidents Scott Stuber and Mary Parent. Simmons' brother,
Run-D.M.C.'s Rev. Run, also represents. "I was out here promoting our
new sneakers," he says. "Russell's being honored and we're touring
together, selling these sneakers." You can cut the synergy with a
knife, but the real purpose of this $500-a-head affair is to raise
money so that Chrysalis can continue to help the homeless find
meaningful work. "We got to get real and grab each other's hands and
hold each other," says Uberproducer Quincy Jones, his eye firmly on
the prize. "It means something when people outside the zone reach
out. That's what my whole life has been about."</TE>
<TE>   MONEY TALKS: "You ever see that movie 'Leaving Las Vegas' with
Nicolas Cage?" asks the evening's testimonial speaker, a
Skid-Row-addict-to-office-tower-paralegal Chrysalis success story.
"That was me." (Actually, sitting a few feet away, there is Nicolas
Cage.) His remarks, which follow a fashion show by Jack Nicholson's
designer daughter, Jennifer, keep things real before the usual round
of charity speechifying. Simmons sprinkles his plea for the less
fortunate with NC-17-quality locutions. "Thanks, Russell, for opening
up the house, I didn't know we could curse," announces emcee Cedric
the Entertainer before unleashing the mother of all expletives. The
crowd thusly amped, director Brett Ratner cajolingly homes in on the
four-and five-figure pledges, and the room turns giddy with
philanthropy. Sir Anthony Hopkins, who takes his third turn as
Hannibal "the Cannibal" Lecter in Ratner's upcoming "Red Dragon,"
offers a gallant $25,000. Cage gives up $20,000. Even unexpected
arrival Macy Gray pledges $5,000, helping cap the evening's total at
$350,000. "I came because my boyfriend is the deejay," says the
helium-voiced R&amp;B siren. "I gave because I used to live in my car."</TE>

<LD>As Internet cafes become yesterday's news and Web kiosks pop up
everywhere from hospitals to carwashes, 21st century task-combiners
can also welcome the Internet laundromat. Lavanderia.tv's billing as
"Earth's First Internet Laundromat" may be a bit hyperbolic (indeed,
a Web search turns up cyber-mats ranging from Sud City in Redondo
Beach to the Clothes Wash Cafe on Tobago, a tiny island in the West
Indies). Nonetheless, the washeteria is indubitably one of the first
L.A. establishments where Web terminals go mano a mano with the
washers. "It's a natural fit," says co-owner John Danpour. "You've
got to do something while you wait for your clothes, so why not go
online?"</LD>
<LD>   Danpour, along with brothers Henry and Sauli, opened Lavanderia.tv
in May on a parcel near La Brea and Pico that had been vacant since a
shopping center on the site burned down during the '92 riots. (Their
development company, the Phoenix Group, invests in low-income
neighborhoods.) "We wanted to support bridging the digital divide and
bring the Internet to people who may not have access to computers,"
he says.</LD>
<TE>   For $6 an hour (half the rate at Kinko's), latter-day Lavernes can
e-mail friends, check sports scores, read movie reviews or surf at
will after sorting their colors and whites. Danpour offers preset
shortcuts to links including Yahoo, Hotmail and his own investment
site. The two DSL-enabled terminals are also equipped with printers
and software that restricts, um, inappropriate use--at Lavanderia.tv,
they keep it clean.</TE>

<HD>Rave Parties That Show Some Decorum</HD>

<LD>At first blush, the all-night bashes held downtown every couple of
months by Karen Kin Hartstein and her husband, Greg Hartstein, look
much like traditional raves. There's always an abundance of glow
sticks, a steamy underground atmosphere and nonstop high-decibel
electronica. But in a subculture where youth is the order of the day
and infant pacifiers had a long run as a hot fashion accessory, the
Hartsteins' events are almost, well, grown-up.</LD>
<LD>   These raves are a little cleaner (functional bathrooms and toilet
paper); a little less edgy (well-lit parking and security guards);
less iffy from the legal standpoint (IDs required, with more costumes
than chemicals in sight); and offer bands rather than deejays.
Indeed, the Hartsteins are unqualifiedly grownups (Karen is 35, Greg
33), and most of the 500 revelers at their recent Mid-Summer Night's
Jam in a downtown warehouse seemed to hover near the 15-year high
school reunion mark. "If everyone was 22 I don't think I'd stay,"
says Wendy Profit, 30.</LD>
<TE>   Not to call the proceedings sedate or anything; April's event in a
former church downtown had an "Alice in Wonderland" theme. Profit, an
assistant to a media consultant, attended the summer blowout in a
pink wig, wings and silver body paint. While only about 25% of
attendees seemed to be in costume, dressing up is part of the draw
for Profit. "You get to be that little fairy inside. You're never too
old for that."</TE>
<TE>   Or for live music all night long, say the Hartsteins. The Newbury
Park couple founded Party Harty Events (www.partyharty.net) a year
ago, inspired by Karen's native Buffalo, N.Y., where bars offering
live sounds stay open until 4 a.m. and somebody with an extra 20
acres can always be counted on to throw an all-nighter. "People are
more diverse here, but it's still just an upstate New York farm
party," says Karen, who works as a massage therapist and yoga
instructor when not producing raves (Greg doubles as a TV sound
engineer). Admission runs from $15 to $20 and the only point, she
says, is good, more-or-less clean fun--9 p.m. to 5 a.m. "Our parties
are fantasy, a place to pretend you're not a banker or a waitress.
Just for one night."</TE>

<HD>Paying the Price for Logging on the Cheap</HD>
<DH>Old-growth trees are far more than fiber-by-the-foot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When George W. Bush poses for a photo op in a burned-over public
forest, he's right about one thing: It's a shame what we've done. And
it's a worse shame what we're doing--more of the same, squandering
the last of our treasure just about as fast as we can.</LD>
<LD>   There is always an excuse for logging public forests on the cheap.
During Bill Clinton's administration, the excuse was jobs. Now it's
fires. Tomorrow it will be something else. I'll take a guess: We'll
thin the forests in the guise of reducing fire danger then we'll have
a series of big El Nino storms. Because the canopy is thinned out,
trees won't be able to rely on each other to share the work of
breaking the wind. There will be massive blow-downs. We'll have to
rush in and "salvage" that lumber too.</LD>
<LD>   Taxpayers will subsidize all this--paying more for the logging
roads and survey work than they receive in timber sales. But managing
public forests at a loss is nothing new. And as long as we're going
to have a 19th century approach to our forests, why change the
fundamentals, eh?</LD>
<TE>   The Big Lie that we're asked to believe is that our public forests
are managed as a "sustainable" resource. That when trees are cut, new
ones are planted, sometimes two for one. When a timber broker feeds
you that bull, ask whether he would trade you that piece of green
paper in his wallet that says $100 for two pieces of the same paper
that say $1. That's what passes for sustainable forestry.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a tree hugger, yes. But I'm also a tree user. I'm a woodworker
in my free time, not to mention I earn my living thanks to the
availability of newsprint. The maddening truth is that conservation
and consumption are not incompatible when it comes to trees--never
mind the contrary tone of our dead-end debates about national
forests. You can love forests as the place where nature reaches full
glory, as havens for animals and cathedrals for our soul. At the same
time, you can cherish them as a storehouse for that most tactile,
warm and beautiful of our raw materials.</TE>
<TE>   We could enjoy our forests for both purposes and for generations
to come if only we regarded trees for their value, not their volume.
Too bad we're running out of time. When a 500-year-old fir is cut
down and peeled into plywood to be nailed on a wall and covered with
paint, a sensible person would say that something is wrong. It's like
the mugger who steals a Rolex and pawns it for $50 and considers
himself ahead. A 500-year-old tree has far greater social value
standing in the forest than loggers pay to cut it down. Likewise,
these trees are worth more on the market as the ingredients for
heirloom furniture and large-dimension architectural display features
than as cheap wallboard.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, that wood may disappear before we recognize it. Only after
the Japanese and the Europeans cut down their forests did they
understand the value of ours. Today, straight-grained fir logs from
the Pacific Northwest can command six or 10 times as much abroad as
they do at home.</TE>
<TE>   How can this be happening? Simple. In the antediluvian mind of the
American lumbermen, wood is just fiber measured by board-feet. Old
trees grow slower than young ones. Thus, there is a premium on
ridding forests of the biggest trees for quick profit, making way for
saplings. Timber lobbyists like to use agricultural analogies. But
they overlook the fact that if you harvest all of your pumpkins when
they are one inch around, you don't have much to offer come
Halloween. No industry in the land is run with such little
imagination and brazen profligacy.</TE>
<TE>   What can we do? Also simple. We acknowledge that a 200-foot tree
has more significance in the forest than 10 20-footers. That's both
for the sake of humans who visit and creatures that depend on it. We
shouldn't allow these trees to be cut for less than the standing
value of leaving them alone. And when big trees are felled, it should
be at a rate no faster than they can replenish themselves. That's
sustainable harvesting in the honest meaning of the term.</TE>
<TE>   But that will make them too expensive, you say. No, it won't.
We'll come to realize the value of what we have before it's gone.
Yes, this wood would cost more, and it should. That way, our
great-grandchildren will have trees in their public forests that make
them crane their necks to behold. And we'll have beautiful, mature
wood, now and tomorrow, worthy of dining room tables and ceiling
beams and wood-strip canoes--things that bring the pleasure of nature
into our everyday lives.</TE>

<HD>Help in Educating Kids With Tourette's</HD>
<DH>Revised act should address the syndrome's special needs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD DREYFUSS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fifteen years ago, as I witnessed the birth of my godson, I never
dreamed I would be so profoundly and forever touched by a vexing,
often misunderstood and frequently misdiagnosed condition known as
Tourette's syndrome, a neurobiological disorder characterized by
involuntary motor and vocal tics.</LD>
<LD>   Since personally experiencing the pain, anguish and family havoc
that Tourette's can wreak, I have lent my voice to radio and TV
public service announcements and devoted significant time to events
aimed at bolstering awareness of the condition.</LD>
<LD>   That's why I'm concerned about the details of the forthcoming
legislation to reauthorize the Individuals With Disabilities
Education Act, or IDEA, which provides a free, appropriate public
education to eligible children with disabilities.</LD>
<TE>   The purpose of the reauthorization is to improve, not harm, a
system that provides individualized instruction to 6.4 million
disabled infants, toddlers and students up to the age of 21.</TE>
<TE>   The reauthorization should allow disorders such as Tourette's a
chance to be included as a recognized disability. Tourette's is often
accompanied by other associated disorders, most commonly
obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder and nonverbal learning disabilities. But most children with
Tourette's have different and distinct educational needs beyond those
youngsters with other conditions and therefore should be recognized
as such by IDEA.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, a child with Tourette's in an elementary school
setting. It's easy to understand how large motor tics might interfere
with classroom performance. If a child's head jerks from side to side
or an arm flails continuously, the interference is obvious.</TE>
<TE>   However, some of the barely noticeable tics can be the most
disruptive to learning in a classroom setting. One very common facial
tic is constant eye blinking. Try reading or writing while your eyes
are constantly blinking. It is nearly impossible. Yet this is a tic
that few educators pay attention to because it does not disturb
others in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, a child with a finger-crossing tic may go unnoticed
because of the quiet and unobtrusive nature of the symptom. Writing,
however, becomes extremely difficult for such a child, if not
impossible, and taking notes becomes a most frustrating experience.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their will to succeed, children with Tourette's sometimes
find that their symptoms make learning almost impossible without
special assistance.</TE>
<TE>   IDEA could be an enormous help to these children; however, the
assistance would be more effective and reach more such children only
if the following recommendations were implemented in the course of
reauthorizing the federal act:</TE>
<TE>   * Tourette's syndrome must be listed as a separate and distinct
disability under the appropriate IDEA category of "other health
impaired." Educators continue to mistakenly see Tourette's as a
behavioral or conduct disorder, which results in the improper
placement of many of these children. The condition is a
neurobiological health impairment and should be recognized as such
under the proposed reauthorization of IDEA.</TE>
<TE>   * The eligibility for special services and accommodations should
be based on the presence of symptoms that compromise school
performance. In many cases, as it stands now, a child must first fail
before qualifying for services.</TE>
<TE>   * Discipline provisions in the law need to be written so they do
not punish children for the expression of Tourette's symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Educators acknowledge that any behavior that is harmful to others
must be controlled and that students with Tourette's are responsible
for their behavior. However, tics, both vocal and motor, are very
frequently misinterpreted as bad behavior or intentional classroom
disturbances. Tics are uncontrollable and irresistible neurologically
based urges.</TE>
<TE>   * In order to achieve the best academic and social results for
children with Tourette's, early diagnosis is paramount.</TE>
<TE>   The law should require and provide training for teachers regarding
Tourette's syndrome and its accompanying neurobiological disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, there have
been great strides made to help children with disabilities receive a
free, appropriate public education. But more needs to be done.</TE>

<HD>Hussein's Victims Live Under a New Cloud</HD>
<DH>If war is launched, Iraqi Kurds worry they'll again be
targets of gas attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAUF NAQISHBENDI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The demise of Saddam Hussein and his regime has become the
preoccupation of George W. Bush, and rightly so.</LD>
<LD>   It is believed that Hussein has stockpiled weapons of mass
destruction. The threat he poses is real and potentially devastating.
That threat manifested itself the first time through the use of
chemical weapons against the Kurdish minority in northern Iraq in
1988.</LD>
<LD>   Among the towns hit by Hussein's poison chemicals was Halabja.
From time to time, Halabja and its 5,000 fatalities are used as the
justification for replacing the current Iraqi regime. It is
inevitably mentioned how Hussein used poison gas on his own people.</LD>
<TE>   I was born in Halabja. In 1988, I was living as a citizen in the
United States and witnessed on television the horror in my native
town. I lost dozens of family members, including my grandfather. My
father was blinded, and others who survived are living with the
aftermath of disease, pain and suffering.</TE>
<TE>   This inhumane action against innocent civilians faced no challenge
from the world community, in particular the superpowers, and, as a
result, Hussein got away with genocide.</TE>
<TE>   The tragedy didn't end there. The town became a common place for
incurable diseases and birth defects. Now, as they hear rumors of
another war, the people of Halabja fear that Hussein will come back.</TE>
<TE>   The Kurds do not count on anyone's sympathy or help because of the
world's inaction after the 1988 attacks. When I talked to one of my
relatives recently about possible U.S military action aimed at
toppling Hussein, he responded, "We have seen Saddam in action once,
and we can't endure another episode of that."</TE>
<TE>   When Hussein devastated my hometown with his fatal chemical bombs,
his atrocities became headline news. Journalists eloquently described
the dead bodies of Kurdish children lying like dolls in their
traditional clothes.</TE>
<TE>   My hometown had a population of 70,000 then; the 5,000 who were
killed died in just minutes.</TE>
<TE>   What worries me now is the possibility of another episode of
Hussein's ungodly wrath. If he is ousted, he will not go alone. For
certain he will take with him as many as he can.</TE>
<TE>   This time his evil probably will not be limited to a little town
but will spread to cities of millions, such as Mosul, Sulaymaniyah
and Arbil. These cities are well within range of his killer missiles.</TE>
<TE>   If only there were a way other than a bloody war to get rid of
Hussein. After all, my people are not the ones who aided the rise of
this evil; it was the West that allowed it. After a new war with
Hussein, President Bush may feel good about getting rid of a tyrant,
but the Kurds could inherit the casualties and a new leader who might
be no different than several of his predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   As the talk of war grows, so does my fear. My mother and my father
now live in Sulaymaniyah. Where do I tell them to hide?</TE>

<HD>Quest for a World of Difference</HD>
<DH>Sequel to the Earth Summit will open to high expectations
and urgent needs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMARTYA SEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The World Summit on Sustainable Development, which begins in
Johannesburg on Monday, is a major global event. What is it, what can
it achieve and how may we assess its achievements?</LD>
<LD>   The meeting is a sequel to the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro
10 years ago. That meeting did a lot to advance environmental
consciousness in public discussion. It also helped to generate the
understanding that "environment and development are inextricably
linked," in the words of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</LD>
<LD>   The 1987 Brundtland Report defined the sustainability of
development as the requirement to meet "the needs of the present
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
own needs." Economist Robert Solow gave a more exact formulation by
insisting on the condition that the next generation must be left with
"whatever it takes to achieve a standard of living at least as good
as our own and to look after their next generation similarly."</LD>
<TE>   The need to think about the environment cannot really be
dissociated from the nature of the lives that people, especially
deprived people, live today. Indeed, if people have a miserable
living standard currently, then the promise of sustaining that
pitiable standard can hardly be thrilling.</TE>
<TE>   The goal has to include rapid reduction of today's deprivations
while making sure that whatever is achieved today can be sustained in
the future.</TE>
<TE>   Global cooperation is needed to alleviate today's deprivations and
to safeguard our future. And that is what the summit in Johannesburg
is trying to achieve.</TE>
<TE>   Do the prospects of effective global cooperation look promising?
One issue is the need for development assistance and finance, and the
extent to which the richer countries are willing to help the
development efforts of the poorer ones. On this front, things do not
look particularly promising.</TE>
<TE>   The chasm between expectation and delivery is beginning to look
big. For example, the financial expectations entertained by the
so-called New Partnership for Africa's Development, or NEPAD, seem to
be radically out of line with the level of assistance that can be
realistically expected at this time from the richer countries or from
international financial institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it is extremely important to be clear that fruitful global
cooperation can take many different forms, not just general financial
assistance. On the environmental side, the ground that has been lost
by the slowing down of international agreements and also by the
reneging on past understandings (for example, by the United States on
the Kyoto Protocol) needs to be reversed. On the economic side, the
importance of reducing entry barriers in the richer countries for
products from the poorer ones deserves much greater acknowledgment.</TE>
<TE>   Also, there is wisdom in Annan's observation that people tend to
be much more "responsive when you present them with a major human
problem and a credible strategy for dealing with it." The response to
the HIV/AIDS pandemic is one obvious field, but the more general need
for concerted efforts in basic health care and education calls for
more global commitment.</TE>
<TE>   There are also many institutional reforms urgently needed for the
global economy. For example, there is a strong case for making patent
laws more efficient and equitable. The existing laws do not
facilitate the use of desperately needed medicines in less-affluent
countries because the obligatory royalties for patents often cost
many times more than the actual production costs.</TE>
<TE>   There are many positive things that the poorer countries can do
for themselves. In this context, we can even question the general
strategy of defining sustainable development only in terms of
fulfillment of needs, rather than using the broader perspective of
enhancing human freedoms on a sustainable basis. The essential
freedoms must, of course, include the ability to meet crucially
important economic needs, but there are many others to be considered,
such as expanding political participation and broadening social
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   There are many rewards to seeing people as "agents" who can
exercise their freedoms rather than merely as "patients" whose needs
have to be fulfilled. Important as financial assistance may be, there
are also other ways forward, working on one's own or in collaboration
with others. Johannesburg offers a major opportunity.</TE>

<KH>At His New Beachside Restaurant, Tim Goodell Shows His
Playful Side</KH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm seated at the bar at Red Pearl Kitchen, a chic new Asian
restaurant in Huntington Beach. My chopsticks are poised to snatch
the last of the Chinese dumplings on the platter when I notice a
cluster of people giggling at the end of the bar. The guy I'd noticed
earlier showing off his digital camera now has it aimed squarely at
the small of his girlfriend's back.</LD>
<LD>   What's so interesting?</LD>
<LD>   Her tattoo, of course. "Want one?" the bartender asks, casually
holding out a stack of decals with the restaurant's logo. On a
red-and-yellow background, inky brush strokes outline a Chinese
woman. Below her, Red Pearl Kitchen is spelled out in kitschy
"Oriental" letters.</LD>
<TE>   Only 5 months old, Red Pearl Kitchen is already the hippest place
to eat along the beach. The restaurant is a big departure for Tim
Goodell, one of Southern California's most interesting chefs. At
Aubergine in Newport Beach, his first restaurant, he turns out
intricate, precisely focused French-California cuisine. He and his
wife, Liza, also recently opened a restaurant in the new Viceroy
hotel in Santa Monica called Whist.</TE>
<TE>   Both are serious restaurants. At Red Pearl Kitchen, though,
Goodell indulges his playful side. The small beachside locale is the
kind of place where he and his crew would like to hang out after
hours. He's been slipping Asian touches into his menu at Aubergine
for years, but here he has room to follow his interests wherever they
take him--whether it's to Shanghai, Japan, Thailand or Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   With a blood red awning, bronze dragon door pull and tall, rustic
Chinese tables, the restaurant's design is attention-grabbing without
going over the top. Columns of candles flicker in odd corners, and a
riotous collection of shapely red, orange and pink silk lampshades
casts a sexy glow over the small dining room. Images from kung fu or
Japanese monster movies flood across a large plasma screen mounted
next to the discreet takeout counter.</TE>
<TE>   At the bar, set squarely in the middle of the room, two bartenders
wield cocktail shakers like marimbas, concocting a daunting parade of
drinks for an ardent crowd. The Manhattan is the best I've ever
tasted. Made with good bourbon, it's barely sweet and capped with a
slurry of shaved ice.</TE>
<TE>   People eat at the bar, too. Lone diners read the paper between
sips of clams with green curry in a lemon grass broth or bites of
noodles. Others come just to pass the time while they wait for
friends or a table.</TE>
<TE>   Red Pearl Kitchen is perfect for grazing through a slew of little
dishes. When Vietnamese egg rolls arrive, I'm quick with my
chopsticks. Piping hot, these are not the innocuous egg rolls I've
come to expect at Asian restaurants pitched to a young urban crowd.
The meat filling is spicy, liberally spiked with ginger and garlic
and rolled up in a lettuce leaf with sprigs of intensely perfumed
mint. "Little Dragon'' dumplings are a swirl of pleated dough,
anchored by a bright-tasting pork and shrimp filling. Next arrives a
big bowl of the absolutely terrific spicy chicken wings. They're
slathered in a sambal honey glaze that's sweet, complexly spiced and
fiery, and we gobble them down even though they're hot enough to burn
our fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Goodell is on to something here. This is what P.F. Chang's and
other restaurants of that ilk should be serving instead of the bland
low-quality fare they're foisting on Middle America. In a stylish
setting, Red Pearl Kitchen offers Asian food with some integrity.
Goodell and his chef, Jeff Armstrong, are using good ingredients. His
flavors are gutsy and authentic. And the beach crowd seems to be
going for it.</TE>
<TE>   Thai green curry with chicken, Thursday night's special, is the
color of spring grass faded to a paler hue once the coconut milk is
stirred in. Topped with feathery leaves of fresh cilantro, it's a
study in green etched with fresh spices. Red beef curry wouldn't win
any beauty prizes, but the milky sweet curry fuses the flavors of
braised short ribs, fingerling potatoes and rice into something much
better than any of its parts. This may be my single favorite dish.
Don't miss the crispy pork belly either, thick slices of melting
tender pork striated with delicious fat and served with a pile of
greens and a dipping sauce of honey with Sichuan peppercorns.</TE>
<TE>   The kitchen makes some missteps. Too many dishes exhibit a heavy
hand with the salt. A couple of items were so excessively salted,
they were virtually inedible. Fried rice tends to be oily. On
occasion, the simple, appealing rice noodles tossed with Chinese
sausage are marred by burnt chunks of the sweet sausage. Pork spare
ribs permeated with Chinese five spice powder are butter tender, but
if you're dreaming of barbecued ribs, these will disappoint. (Note:
Barbecued is not mentioned anywhere in the description.)</TE>
<TE>   On weekends, diners often form a line around the block waiting for
the restaurant to open (the restaurant doesn't take reservations). On
Wednesdays through Saturdays a live deejay charges the room with
energy. On Thursdays, Mr. Danny Love dances and sways over his
equipment, spinning the room into what feels like the shimmy of a
rocket takeoff.</TE>
<TE>   Aubergine's pastry chef, Shelly Register, does the desserts here,
too, and they're wonderful. I don't use the word irresistible very
often, but that's an accurate adjective for her dreamy cardamom pot
de creme. Served in a cafe au lait bowl, it's thick and satiny,
topped with a cloud of whipped cream. Her pineapple upside down cake
is made with fresh pineapple. The brown sugar topping seeps deep into
the cake and caramelizes the fruit. Who knew this dated housewife's
staple could be so delicious?</TE>
<TE>   Times are changing when you're able to find such sophisticated,
daring food in surfer territory. If only more restaurateurs in the
beach cities would take up the challenge.</TE>

<LD>They erupt like their rockets into our consciousness, these amazingly
complex space explorations, and then fade a long while as their
distance grows into numbers beyond mortal comprehension. Radio
signals to and from the Voyager I and II spacecraft, dispatched from
our galactic neighborhood 25 years ago, take 12 hours each way--at
the speed of light.</LD>
<LD>   NASA's Contour project was launched July 3 with the familiar
complex rocketry, dramatic rumbling and starburst publicity of these
now-regular space explorations. But suddenly Contour has become a
silent, deep-space mystery--and may remain so forever.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine planning and projecting these intragalactic blind dates.
The $159-million Contour mission was designed to position the
2,138-pound craft to meet and study two comets, one late next year
and one in mid-2006. Comets are moving archeological digs portaging
refuse from our solar system's creation. NASA plans other launches,
including the 2004 departure of a spacecraft called Messenger that
will swing by Mercury and Venus and then, five years later, orbit
Mercury.</LD>
<TE>   It's courageous to sail into unknown seas. It's something more to
design, package, launch and guide a robot craft from Earth through
several years of outer space, anticipating its every need and
difficulty in that hostile, freezing, radiation-ridden environment.</TE>
<TE>   Contour orbited Earth successfully, 140 miles above the planet at
one point and 71,000 at another. On Aug. 15, on a pass over the
Indian Ocean just beneath earshot of deep-space antennas, it was to
fire into outer space. Something else happened. Silence. Such craft
are programmed, like E.T., to phone home automatically 90 hours after
a last command. Nothing. Huge telescopes have detected several
objects moving along Contour's projected trajectory. None answer.</TE>
<TE>   Explorers disappear, sometimes for years, sometimes forever, as
they seek New Worlds or Northwest Passages. Columbus was gone more
than a year, and Henry Hudson never did return. Even astronauts lose
radio contact for some minutes during reentry. Maybe Contour will
make contact next summer, when its winter hibernation was to end
before a first comet encounter. That's the drama in going to new
places and doing new things--possibly not returning.</TE>
<TE>   For the clever scientific teams assembled to design, build and
nurture their mechanical wanderings and wonderings, the remnants of
Contour are disappointing chunks of debris speeding 3.8 miles farther
from home every second.</TE>
<TE>   For the rest of us, those objects, now in effect man-made
mini-comets probably destined to circle the sun uselessly for many of
our earthbound lifetimes, can still ignite our imaginations to wonder
what primordial secrets their cometary colleagues will now keep a
good while longer.</TE>

<LD>This year publishers are flooding bookstores with works lamenting how
U.S. political and business leaders in the 1990s lost sight of the
ideals on which the United States was founded. One new book, however,
rises above wistfulness and recreates that original vision.</LD>
<LD>   A biography of Benjamin Franklin by Edmund S. Morgan breathes new
life into core American values. Franklin combined charity, curiosity
(which led him to invent everything from bifocals to a stove) and
frugality ("Make no Expence but do good to others or yourself: i.e.,
Waste nothing"). He was no saint, but that makes him all the more
believable as an antidote to self-absorption and materialism.</LD>
<LD>   The 86-year-old Morgan, an emeritus history professor at Yale, is
revered by many historians for his rebuttals of shopworn orthodoxies.
For example, his 1944 book "The Puritan Family" showed how the
rituals and beliefs of "ordinary" Americans, then disregarded as
historically insignificant, helped shape history. In 1975, Morgan's
"American Slavery, American Freedom" showed that the colonies'
demands for greater freedom, portrayed as yearnings for liberty and
justice, were largely driven by white colonialists' sense of
entitlement upon acquiring black slaves. In 1990, Morgan's "Inventing
the People" showed how business and political leaders clothe
self-interested agendas in democratic, populist language.</LD>
<TE>   Morgan is just as provocative in debunking conventional wisdom
about Franklin. Whereas the dull schoolbook depictions of Franklin
portray a modest, portly man who advocated chastity and temperance,
Morgan's Franklin is an athletic man, swimming in chilly rivers into
his 70s, who had numerous affairs in which he succumbed, in his own
words, to "that hard-to-be govern'd Passion of Youth." He was also
ambitious, if slyly so. As Morgan puts it, Franklin believed that
"the way to advance oneself was to show no interest in advancing it.
He was, in a sense, too vain to allow a show of vanity to diminish
his reputation."</TE>
<TE>   Most provocative of all is Morgan's depiction of how Franklin
spent most of his life campaigning for causes in which he did not
himself believe. He spent "10 years arguing for a natural right [to
own property] that existed in American opinion but not quite in his
own. He then spent eight years in charming the French into helping
the Americans fight a war against the British, even though he
believed that war was not a cost-effective way of settling
differences."</TE>
<TE>   Were Franklin alive today, unforgiving pundits might dismiss him
as a spineless hypocrite. Morgan, however, recognizes that America's
greatest leaders have been torn between their respect for democracy
and their own sense of what's right. To him, Franklin was "a man with
a wisdom about himself that comes only to the great of heart.
Franklin knew how to value himself and what he did without mistaking
himself for something more than one man among many. His special brand
of self-respect required him to honor his fellow men and women no
less than himself."</TE>

<HD>Crying Out on Health Care</HD>

<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the face of marches and protests by patients and health workers,
the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors last week stuck with its
plan to close 11 primary-care clinics and four school-based clinics.
Are the supervisors grandstanding? Or are they just trying to keep
the fraying health-care system from going under and taking the county
with it? Both.</LD>
<LD>   There is certainly an element of brinkmanship in the board's
threat of even more dire cuts in October unless the federal
government helps assuage a looming $800-million deficit. But the
board has to somehow win the attention of Gov. Gray Davis and the
Bush administration. Both seem bent on ignoring the problem of
uninsured workers, even when the county with the largest uninsured
population in the nation is nearing a meltdown.</LD>
<LD>   State health officials say they need to study the county's plan
before Davis can pitch it to the federal government. Fair enough. But
they shouldn't use their questions as a delaying tactic to help the
governor dodge responsibility. If they don't like the county's plan,
they should offer an alternative.</LD>
<TE>   Today's crisis is partly the fault of county bureaucracies and
other inefficiencies. Streamlining should have begun a decade ago.
But ultimately the problem is, as Supervisor Gloria Molina put it,
"We have too many working poor and no one willing to pick up the
tab."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995 and 2000, the Clinton administration bailed out the county
by waiving federal rules that reimbursed hospitals for caring for
uninsured people, but not outpatient clinics. In theory, pushing the
county to offer more outpatient care should save money by keeping
patients out of hospitals. In turn, the county can then use the
savings to run clinics as the waiver is phased out over the next
three years.</TE>
<TE>   The projected savings have not materialized. Clinics and hospitals
alike are overwhelmed by growing numbers of uninsured patients.</TE>
<TE>   With its large immigrant population and high percentage of jobs
without medical coverage, Los Angeles County may be the epicenter of
the uninsured crisis, but it's not alone. UC Irvine Medical Center
just announced cutbacks, saying it could no longer shoulder caring
for Orange County's uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   This is not solely a county problem. And it won't be solved until
the state and federal governments quit backing away from a problem
that is theirs too.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As the newly elected president of the Inglewood School Board, I am
compelled to reply to "Parents Lose Fight Over Inglewood 'Honors
High' " (Aug. 16), on our City Honors High School. The doom-and-gloom
tone of your article was very unfair to the 17,000-plus students who
attend schools within this district. While the board is very
concerned with the 74 students who were displaced by the decision of
West L.A. College to deny space to them for an additional year, we
were judicious in our efforts to find a suitable location to house
this program.</LD>
<TE>   Because we know the importance of maintaining a program of this
caliber, this board directed our staff to work with the parents to
look at numerous locations and submit their findings to us, with
budgets attached. Keeping in mind that any site must meet the state's
education code in order to house students, the costs to move this
program were prohibitive. Another caveat was the looming possibility
of budget cuts from the state and federal government. While the
choice may not have been popular with the parents of City Honors High
students, this board is cognizant that the decisions we make also
affect our 17,000-plus other students. We recognize that this program
will be housed on the campus of one of our designated
"underperforming" schools, but on that site we are still educating
children, we are intensifying our teacher recruitment efforts and our
seniors are graduating and attending institutions of higher learning.</TE>

<LD>Re "Fox Plugs Bill for Energy Reform," Aug. 21: It's ludicrous to
think that Vicente Fox's "free-market agenda" helped him get elected
as president of Mexico: That is the agenda of his core constituency
only. Fox won the Mexican presidency because the Mexican people
wanted to get rid of the old regime and realized that he was the
candidate with the best chances of doing it. When it comes to
advancing his political, moral, religious or economic agendas, he has
to put up a fight. So far, he has failed to win many matches, and
many Mexicans who voted for him are probably glad.</LD>

<LD>Re "Women Must Be Freed From Koranic Brutalities," Commentary, Aug.
21: Kudos to Frida Ghitis for calling a spade a spade! In defense of
his modernization efforts in Turkey, Kemal Ataturk made a prescient
observation nearly a century ago. He said that as long as Islamic
societies continued to deny their women basic rights, such as social
emancipation, equal opportunities in education and, most important,
complete equality under the law, generations of Muslim children would
be born to mothers or nations that were, in effect, half-paralyzed.
Thus, the rights of women are inextricably linked to the development
of nations.</LD>
<LD>   It is critical that an honest dialogue on the issue of women's
emancipation begins in the Islamic world, otherwise it risks becoming
that proverbial cripple.</LD>
<LD>   Saeeda Wali Mohammed</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ghitis' commentary accurately reflects the dismal state of affairs
faced by many Muslim women around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Many Muslims, men and women alike, reject the narrow
interpretation of Islamic texts that results in gross injustices that
clearly violate basic rights guaranteed by Islam.</TE>
<TE>   However, The Times, by your choice of headline for this piece,
mistakenly blames the Koran, which does not, in any verse, call for
capital punishment of the adulterer.</TE>
<TE>   It is true that adultery is a major sin in Islam, as in other
faiths, and in an Islamic state it constitutes a sex crime. But the
requirements for proof of adultery are nearly impossible to meet
(four eyewitnesses to the act of intercourse). The majority of
jurists do not consider pregnancy alone as valid evidence of
adultery, nor is it referred to as such in the Koran. Unfortunately,
the religious leadership in Nigeria subscribes to the minority view,
resulting in an unjust interpretation of Islamic law.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Woman's Stoning Sentence Is Upheld," Aug. 20: As the former
director of the National Islamic Center of Washington, D.C., allow me
to make clear that there is no such dictum in the Koran to allow the
stoning death of an adulteress; the penalty the Koran prescribes is
lashing. It is unfortunate that many of those who profess to be
Muslims are unaware of what the Koran prescribes; thus, this alleged
Sharia court in Nigeria is staffed by people who are following tribal
customs, not Islam.</TE>

<LD>   If I were governor, I would have the last word on this one, come
what may. I would ask millions of Californians who have health
insurance to pass an emergency bill for $31.3 million to show some
kindness for our neighbors in their time of need, suffering and
unimaginable worry and fear. The cost? Never miss it: a Dodger dog, a
Lakers Pepsi, a Mickey Mouse trinket from Disneyland or a small
popcorn with butter from one's favorite theater in Hollywood.</LD>

<TE>   Where are the values and priorities of our elected officials? I'm
sure I don't understand all the reasons why the county Board of
Supervisors chose to balance the budget on the backs of those who
need help most, but I have to express my outrage! A healthy and
educated state and nation are more important to the survival of our
democracy than anything I can think of. Is there no other way? Is it
that the poor don't have a voice? I know how much some of these
people, who have no insurance and cannot afford doctors, depend on
the county health services. If any of our supervisors have a heart
and a conscience for the future, I plead with them to find a way to
restore these urgent and necessary services.</TE>

<LD>Re "Florida Wants All the Details From Mothers in Adoption Notices,"
Aug. 21: Three valid questions: How many people are there in the
Florida Legislature? Is this a rare case of group dementia? Was there
not one single person who thought this out and considered the
consequences?</LD>
<LD>   The very idea of a woman or child required by law to publish her
sex life in one or more newspapers sounds like something the Taliban
would have come up with. If this law is enforced, I would like to see
published nationally the sex life of every bonehead person involved
in passing it.</LD>

<TE>   Requiring mothers in Florida to run a gantlet of embarrassing
procedures to give up a child for adoption is a giant step in the
wrong direction. You don't have to be a student of unintended
consequences to realize that this will result in increased child
abuse up to and including infanticide.</TE>
<TE>   We won't know what the real rate of infanticide is. All we know
for sure is that some mothers are foolish enough to put the baby or
the body in a dumpster. The Florida Legislature needs to think about
this one a little more.</TE>

<HD>Improving Some Test Scores Will Take Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As an LAUSD teacher in the upper grades, I was restrained in my
response to the rise in standardized test scores ("L.A. Unified Hails
Reforms as Test Scores Rise for Fourth Year," Aug. 21). I was
gratified that lower-grade scores had climbed again but disappointed,
though not surprised, that upper-grade scores needed improvement. I
hope people understand that it will take time to raise
secondary-school scores because the basics must be of primary
importance in the lower grades. In the early stages of education, a
child will retain those basics well into middle and high school.</LD>
<LD>   Currently, a vast number of high school students have no mastery
of the basics, and it is often too late to motivate students to even
care about the testing for several reasons. First, students
begrudgingly take the tests with the idea that the tests measure
teacher performance, not theirs.</LD>
<LD>   Second, some students feel that the test scores are of no
consequence because the scores have no effect on grades. I've given
standardized tests and seen students finish in less than five
minutes, randomly darkening any circle. Third, some students give up
trying to grasp the basics because they feel it's too late. Given
time, I know all scores will improve, but patience and persistence
are required.</LD>

<TE>   A conspicuous omission in your analysis of why LAUSD's test scores
rose was the short-lived reduction of class size in the primary
grades. However this mini "golden age" for LAUSD youngsters has
passed. Who remembers when California shared its revenues with
children at the pre-Proposition 13 levels? We all must shoulder the
shame of what the world's seventh-largest economy offers its
citizens.</TE>

Likewise, violence against Palestinian citizens by the Israeli army

and murdered that we do not also thirst for vengeance and perpetuate
the cycle of violence.</LD>

<KH>VALLEY SECESSION</KH>
<HD>Sound of Silence Among Blacks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>Susan Anderson is a writer and consultant and the
author of the report, "African American Political Strength:
Background and Implications for Los Angeles."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In most quarters, it's a foregone conclusion that African American
voters will react as a bloc against Valley secession on the Nov. 5
ballot. In fact, blacks are the only racial or ethnic group in which
more than 50% oppose the breakup. But the nuances in black sentiment
shouldn't be ignored. A substantial group of black voters--nearly a
third--says it favors the Valley leaving Los Angeles. And there is a
great diversity of opinion even among the majority of African
Americans who do support a unified Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   African Americans were among the founders of L.A., and throughout
the city's history, they have continued to gamble on it as a place
conducive to fulfilling their dreams. "We are here like other
people," declared a 1913 edition of the Los Angeles Liberator, "to
share these splendid conditions, buying houses and contributing to
the common cause, building up this great [city]." Black Angelenos
have always known that their dreams came with the price of civic
commitment, a willingness to lead the political fights to tear down
barriers to participation. But not this time.</LD>
<TE>   One oddity of the secession fight is the uncharacteristic silence
of many African American leaders. Mayor James K. Hahn has managed to
bring in businessman and former basketball star Magic Johnson to
speak for keeping the city together. But beyond him, there is
silence. From San Pedro to San Fernando, high-profile black elected
officials, clergy and other leaders are echoing county Supervisor
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, who said, "I have taken no position. I'm
looking at all the facts."</TE>
<TE>   A primary cause of the silence of African American leaders is
their desire to use their power to best advantage, given the high
stakes. The black vote, many feel, is what put Hahn in office a year
ago, something he has taken for granted. Now, a mobilized black
electorate could provide the decisive edge in November. But after the
fracas over the firing of former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks, there is deep suspicion of Hahn, and many question enlisting
in his battle. Black community leaders may be deliberating out of
public earshot, but they are nonetheless sending a message: In this
political contest, African Americans are not to be taken for granted.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor in blacks' reticence on the issue is deep
ambivalence. Secession has some possible benefits. Smaller cities
might indeed be better for neighborhoods and businesses. And a
smaller Los Angeles could boost black power by upping the proportion
of blacks and making the city more liberal. But secession is also
viewed skeptically as just a latter-day form of white flight, a way
of abandoning the urban challenge rather than fighting for its
promise. Many worry that a patchwork of localities could not
effectively address regional issues such as aging infrastructure and
need for business development. And there is a real question about
whether the reduced tax base of a smaller city would be adequate to
address the needs of its people.</TE>
<TE>   For African American Valley residents, both the potential benefits
and the potential pitfalls loom large. Their tenure in the area dates
back generations, peaking after World War II when low-income military
housing was moved from Griffith Park to Pacoima, and the Joe Louis
subdivision was developed for black homeowners. According to research
that will be published this year by Cal State Northridge
demographersJames Allen and Eugene Turner, the black Valley
population is no longer consolidated in Pacoima but has dispersed to
Van Nuys, Canoga Park, Sunland and other areas. "This community has
changed," says Joseph E. Holloway, a professor in Northridge's
pan-African studies department. "If you can afford to buy the
property, you can live anywhere you want."</TE>
<TE>   A lifetime Valley resident and member of the Los Angeles County
Human Relations Commission, the Rev. Zedar E. Broadous serves on the
executive committee of Valley VOTE, the group leading the secession
charge. He says he joined the group because he shares its view that
the L.A. bureaucracy has been unresponsive to local problems, and he
believes that voters have the right to decide on cityhood. But
despite his involvement with pro-secessionists, Broadous says, "I'm
on the fence, because I'm looking at both sides of the issue."
Broadous cites as a positive of the proposed breakaway the
possibility that "by having a smaller government located here, you
would have more access." But he's skeptical about a new Valley city,
saying "because there's no truly black geographical district,
politicians will not be beholden to the African American community."</TE>
<TE>   According to yet-to-be released research conducted by Eugene
Grigsby of UCLA's Advanced Policy Institute, Valley blacks are 4.3%
of the voting-age population and 5.6% of registered voters. The data
suggest that, although their rate of electoral participation exceeds
their proportion of the population--as it does elsewhere in the
city--black Valley residents uncoupled from more numerous African
Americans in Los Angeles would have less clout in the new city.
Grigsby's research also discredits the belief held by some that
without the Valley, African American political leverage would
increase in the remaining Los Angeles. The UCLA figures show that the
proportion of African Americans of voting age in a post-secession
L.A. city would increase from its current 11% to only 14.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Andrae Crouch, a Grammy-winning gospel performer and co-pastor of
the 1,000-member New Christ Memorial Church in Pacoima, has a more
personal reason for opposing secession. "We've invested a lot" in Los
Angeles, he says. "Our church is one of the most beautiful churches
in the city.... It's too late for us to change direction. I don't
want to go from a limousine to a Volkswagen. Why go from a mansion to
a hut?"</TE>
<TE>   A study by the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, to be
released in September, suggests another reason that nonwhite voters
might want to be particularly wary of secession. The Local Agency
Formation Commission plan for a new Valley city, researcher Mary
Cummins says, sidesteps state laws protecting union workers and
collective bargaining agreements by putting employee salaries under
control of the new Valley city with no safeguards for workers. Since
African Americans work in large numbers in city government--they make
up 11% of the L.A. population but 21% of city employees--they would
be at greater risk than other ethnic groups for unemployment and
economic loss.</TE>
<TE>   Many blacks who oppose secession do so on economic grounds. Gene
Hale, president and founder of G&amp;C Equipment Corp., worries that
separating the Valley and the city would threaten the economic
vitality of both entities, discourage corporations from locating in
the area and hurt small business. Hale strongly supports Hahn's
anti-secession campaign, arguing that secession could harm chances
for investment in the region because of possible lower credit ratings
and uncertain financial burdens for both the new city and Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Others worry that the proposal has strong racial overtones. The
association of key members of Valley VOTE with the anti-busing and
Proposition 13 movements in the 1970s has led some to view secession
as a revival of the desire to create a majority-white city. As Karen
Bass, executive director of Community Coalition and an 8th Council
District candidate put it: "Ironically, the reduction in resources
that resulted from passage of Proposition 13 is one of the major
reasons for scarce resources for schools and city services
today"--big complaints of secessionists.</TE>
<TE>   Valley VOTE's main link to South Los Angeles has been the Rev.
Frederick Murph of Brookins Community AME Church. Murph helped found
the Secession Exploration and Education Committee to independently
analyze and disseminate facts on "one of the hottest issues facing
the community in a long while." SEEC was formed, Murph says, in the
aftermath of the firing of Parks as LAPD chief when Murph and others
realized "that we can no longer follow politicians, regardless of
their race." But the discussions between Valley VOTE and SEEC have
not made a secessionist of Murph. "I would not jeopardize my
community nor attack the mayor just because we had a disagreement."
Like many other black leaders, Murph won't commit yet to a position
on secession, but his views nevertheless come through. "We have to
work together to help L.A. become what it can become: a world-class
city," he says.</TE>

<KH>TERRORISM</KH>
<HD>It Takes a Network</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ARQUILLA</AU>
<BD>John Arquilla is professor of defense analysis at the
Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey and coauthor of "Networks and
Netwars: The Future of Terror, Crime, and Militancy."</BD>
<DL>MONTEREY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>In the last year, our defense posture has shifted. We used to be
focused exclusively on nations; now we are also focused on networks.
Networks like Al Qaeda are dangerous adversaries. They have loose,
difficult-to-trace organizational structures. Vigorous efforts must
be made to connect the dots of the network and its various dark
allies. Yet, for all our new focus on winkling out networked terror,
we seem to have learned few lessons about the nature of "netwar." Our
lack of understanding of this network-driven mode of conflict has led
to three serious stumbles.</LD>
<LD>   The most egregious error has been to pronounce the effort a "war
on terror." The simple war metaphor, which has clearly been used to
galvanize public support, implies that the current conflict is of a
traditional type, that it can be waged like other wars, where more
force is almost always better. Thus, the campaign in Afghanistan
began with a month of ineffectual, old-style aerial bombardment, and
enormous efforts were made to take out Osama bin Laden. But in a
netwar, like the one we find ourselves in now, strategic bombing
means little, and most networks don't rely on one--or even
several--great leaders to sustain and guide them.</LD>
<TE>   True, the Taliban has fallen, and Al Qaeda's hub in Afghanistan is
largely gone. But this resulted mainly from the efforts of highly
interconnected special operations forces guiding smart bombs in
attacks on fleeting small targets. And the Taliban's fall has done
little to eliminate the terrorism network, which has operatives
distributed around the world, readying for new strikes. That network
will persist even if we conduct another successful special forces
campaign, this time in Iraq against Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   To cope with the continuing threat from Al Qaeda operatives still
in the fight, the Bush administration is on the verge of receiving
congressional approval to create a Cabinet-level Department of
Homeland Security. This is a second major misstep. A hierarchy is a
clumsy tool to use against a nimble network: It takes networks to
fight networks, much as in previous wars it has taken tanks to fight
tanks.</TE>
<TE>   If we are up against opponents who are in close touch with each
other and can swarm to the attack, as Mohamed Atta's hub-and-spokes
team did on 9/11, then we must build an interconnected strike force
of our own that can swarm together to overwhelm such an enemy. This
kind of organizational suppleness won't result from creation of a new
hierarchy, and in fact a new department-level entity could well slow
us down even further.</TE>
<TE>   The third failure brought about by our lack of understanding of
networks and networking is our continued insistence upon taking the
lead in the current conflict. To be sure, last year's attacks on the
U.S. provided just cause for fighting. But if we are to hope for
sustained international support in what is likely to be a protracted
conflict, we must persuade, encourage and inspire rather than simply
command. While we have done well in learning to network our combat
forces, there has been much less learned about how to conduct the
"battle of the story," which will turn less on spinning propaganda
and more on weaving a web of common interests and beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   A network is empowered by the adherence of its members to a shared
goal. Al Qaeda operatives, for example, are linked by their devotion
to a vision of the world in which the shadow of American power is
sharply reduced. Our own network must draw its strength and loyalty
from a commitment to fostering a global civil society that promotes
and protects democracy and human rights. Care must be given to
crafting such a network, and to explaining it in a way that engenders
loyalty to it. The kind of network we need can't be formed or
sustained through coercive comments about being "with us" or "against
us."</TE>
<TE>   Our leadership and, indeed, most other leaders around the world
are new to this type of warfare. Clearly, the most important step
they all can take right now is to learn all they can about networks
and network-style conflict. Raising their level of awareness would
open up the possibility of waging this war in new ways, rather than
continuing to stumble along in a more traditional and ineffectual
fashion. A good way to start is by drawing lessons from those who
have already shown some aptitude for networking.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, we have much to learn from the skillful networking
orchestrated by Singapore late last year as it neutralized a major
terror network node that was planning an ammonium nitrate
truck-bombing campaign against American targets there. Some of our
European allies have also moved together skillfully, taking out much
of Al Qaeda's logistical and financial support structures there. And
in June, the Moroccans captured members of an Al Qaeda terror cell
that intended to attack American and British vessels moving through
the Strait of Gibraltar. In short, we have the beginnings of a good,
functioning counter-terror network. So let's learn from what has
worked and not louse things up by imposing too centralized a command
on ourselves and our allies.</TE>
<TE>   If we do loosen the reins and see ourselves as just part of a
network fighting for civil society worldwide, good things are going
to happen. And good things will keep happening as long as our police,
military and intelligence agencies come to realize that their
strength grows from networked information-sharing with each other.
This is a lesson not yet learned at the top, despite the examples
provided by real successes of networking achieved by our allies.
Failure to learn this lesson would leave us ill prepared to defend
the U.S. against either Al Qaeda or other networks likely to rise in
the coming years, in emulation of Bin Laden, the dark pioneer of
netwar.</TE>

<AU>ANN LOUISE BARDACH</AU>
<BD>Ann Louise Bardach is the author of the forthcoming
"Cuba Confidential: Love and Vengeance in Miami and Havana" and the
editor of "Cuba: A Traveler's Literary Companion."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Aug. 13, Fidel Castro turned 76. Across the Florida Straits on the
same day, Castro's most zealous foe, U.S. Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart,
had a birthday as well.</LD>
<LD>   The two are joined by more than a birthday--and they are divided
by more than ideology. Diaz-Balart is Castro's nephew by his first
marriage and the son of his former best friend, Rafael Diaz-Balart.
In 1953, Fidel Castro declared war on his powerful in-laws when he
attacked the Moncada garrison in Santiago de Cuba, became a national
legend and eventually sent them fleeing the country. "I may not live
to see the end of him," Rafael Diaz-Balart told me recently, "but my
sons certainly will." And we are reminded that this nearly
half-century, high-stakes showdown is, in some respects, a bitter
family feud.</LD>
<LD>   It's hard to say who has the upper hand in the feud. The last few
weeks have been tough for Castro, Cuba's ruler for life. First, 23
young Catholic Cubans defected in Canada during a pilgrimage to see
Pope John Paul II in early August. Then, a former high-level
official, Alcibiades Hidalgo, washed up in Miami and told reporters
that despair drove him to flee Cuba on a raft. Word then slipped out
that Roberto Robaina, the former foreign minister and Castro
favorite, had been tossed out of the Communist Party in May, followed
by a videotaped tongue-lashing from Castro's brother Raul.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, Castro faces off against his 10th U.S. president, one
who has placed more Cuban Americans in key positions of power than
any other. All of President Bush's Cuban appointees--from Mel
Martinez and Frank Jimenez at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development to Otto J. Reich at the State Department to Emilio
Gonzalez at the National Security Council--are exiles of the
hard-line persuasion, hellbent on maintaining and bolstering the
40-year-old trade embargo, along with the travel ban.</TE>
<TE>   But Castro has always thrived--almost perversely--on adversity,
and the kind of U.S. intransigence favored by Diaz-Balart and his
allies has always been good news for him. Ironically, he will
confront far more daunting challenges when Congress abolishes the
failed embargo and overrides a promised presidential veto--an event
that could happen as early as next month. At that point, forced to
abandon his role as the beleaguered David staving off his nasty
northern Goliath, the indomitable Castro will truly have to reinvent
himself.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, he has had plenty of good material to demonize
his northern nemesis. Calling U.S. corporate scandals "bald-faced
robbery" and "criminal swindling" recently, Castro's implicit message
is that capitalism has fallen on the heels of communism--and so,
surprise, Fidelismo is the answer.</TE>
<TE>   Castro continues to assault the day with the energy of an
adolescent. Lately, he has been telling friends that he hasn't felt
so well in years. An eccentric hypochondriac, Castro maintains a
program of rigorous exercise. Hoping to extend his life--and his
reign--he has recently adopted a strict macrobiotic diet under the
tutelage of one of the medical wizards in the Ministry of Health.</TE>
<TE>   Castro's most bedeviling challenges, which will exponentially
expand once the embargo is lifted, are not with his health, but with
his people. In his efforts to upstage the Bush administration, Castro
indulged Jimmy Carter when the former president met with dissidents
Oswaldo Paya and Elizardo Sanchez and endorsed their reform
initiative, the Varela Project, on live Cuban television. Heeven sat
through a thrashing of Cuba's human rights record from Carter. But
the Varela Project, with its 11,020 signers urging democratic
reforms, clearly hit a tender spot for the Cuban leader.</TE>
<TE>   The petition hoped to qualify its proposals--free elections,
freedom of speech, the right to own a business and amnesty for Cuba's
political prisoners--in a national referendum to be scheduled by the
National Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   The petition has never been acted upon. Instead, Castro has sought
to stamp it out with a vengeance normally reserved for infectious
diseases and plagues. With Carter safely off his island, he hammered
through an amendment to the country's constitution, holding a massive
signature-gathering campaign in which he claims 99% of the Cuban
electorate called for making socialism in Cuba "eternal" and
"untouchable." The Varela Project, meanwhile, has become virtually
unmentionable--so much so that law students at the University of
Havana who recently requested a copy for academic study were refused.</TE>
<TE>   But Castro's overkill may come back to haunt him sooner rather
than later. Over drinks a few weeks ago in Havana on a trip for the
American Journalism Foundation, I heard fury from a source I had long
regarded as an unwavering Fidelista. "I have always regarded myself
as an authentic person, so this is the first time I have done
something I do not believe in," he said, explaining why he signed
Castro's petition. "I waited until the end of the third day--the last
day of voting. Then my daughter visited me and said it could cost her
husband his job, and I knew the CDR [Committee for the Defense of the
Revolution) was waiting for me to vote, and I was afraid of the
consequences."</TE>
<TE>   His belief that only a minority of Cubans think Castro should
leave the stage further dejected him, he said. "I think we are only
about 35% of the country," he said plaintively.</TE>
<TE>   Many Cubans, he said, are worried about losing their health and
education benefits--as happened to their former patrons, the
Russians. "We also have a history with the Mafia, and no one wants to
go back to that," he said. "You see, Castro is the devil we know."
Still, he said, Castro's action had helped the dissidents' cause.
"Now everyone in the country knows about the Varela Project."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Castro's dilemmas are of his own making.</TE>
<TE>   Having ushered in the highest literacy rate in the hemisphere, he
must now cope with the inquisitiveness of a population with a
superior education. Many Cubans now have access to the Internet, and
cybercafes have sprouted up around the capital. Fearless and natural
entrepreneurs, Habaneros have somehow secured an estimated 20,000
illegal satellite dishes this year delivering images from beyond
Cuba's borders into virtually every neighborhood in this city of 2
million. Dishes have even found their way into the provinces, and
those who can't afford them make their own antennas of mop handles
and used kitchen and car parts. There are sporadic sweeps to seize
the offending saucers, but the genie won't be easily returned to the
bottle.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz-Balart has now appropriated the David role for himself in his
fight to stop the erosion of the U.S. embargo. Mentored by his
father, who has hosted a show on Radio Marti, the U.S. tax-funded
propaganda station, Diaz-Balart has been brought up to want
vengeance--perhaps even more than victory. Castro must not be allowed
to simply slip away: He must be brought to his knees, punished and
humiliated.</TE>
<TE>   For 40 years, the Diaz-Balart family has argued that the embargo
is an essential component of American policy toward Cuba. But like
King Lear, they have been blinded by their rage. Clearly, the winds
of discontent in Cuba could well turn into a gale once the island
nation is opened to U.S. markets and culture. But the angry men of
Miami, like the old man in Havana, cannot bear to admit that they
made a mistake.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Last month, the Chinese government announced that some 45.8 million
of its citizens had access to the Internet. Three years ago, only 2
million Chinese people were online. At this rate, half of China's
nearly 1.3 billion people will be online in five years.</LD>
<LD>   For supporters of a free and open exchange of ideas, this sounds
like progress. But while the rapid development of the Internet in
China is indeed impressive, we must not ignore a less cheerful
corollary development: The country's leaders are also escalating
efforts to strengthen the "Great Firewall," which controls what
information China's Internet users can view and distribute.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1995, more than 60 laws have been enacted governing Internet
activities in China. More than 30,000 state security employees are
currently conducting surveillance of Web sites, chat rooms and
private e-mail messages--including those sent from home computers.
Thousands of Internet cafes have been closed in recent months, and
those remaining have been forced to install "Internet Police 110"
software, which filters out more than 500,000 banned sites with
pornographic or so-called subversive content. Dozens of people have
been arrested for their online activities; in 2001, eight people were
arrested on subversion charges for publishing or distributing
information online.</LD>
<TE>   This month, a court in Tianshui City, Gansu province, sentenced
former police officer Li Dawei to 11 years in prison for downloading
and printing 500 "reactionary" articles from the Internet, which
could include a broad range of information that the government simply
finds politically unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   The newest section of the Great Firewall is a set of regulations
enacted Aug. 1 requiring Web publishers to censor their own sites or
risk being shut down. Having realized that censoring the millions of
Web sites now online is a behemoth task, the government has compelled
private Internet service providers, Web publishers and Internet cafe
owners to do the job for them.</TE>
<TE>   Such restrictive regulations clearly trample the Internet's spirit
of free expression and democracy. They are also destroying the buds
of free expression in China by directly threatening tens of thousands
of individual Web sites publishing increasingly independent and
diverse viewpoints. In response, Chinese Internet users have launched
new protests against state censorship of the Web. At the fore of this
movement is the widely circulated Declaration of Internet Citizens'
Rights, which demands free expression and freedom of information and
association on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The declaration's authors challenge the constitutionality of the
new regulations and defend their rights to publish online by quoting
the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the
International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights. The Internet
declaration then states: "A modern society is an open society. As the
Chinese people again face a historic transition into a modern society
... any measure that closes China only harms China's emergence into
the international community and Chinese society's peace and
progress.... Defending Internet freedom is an urgent matter."
Initiated by 18 prominent writers, lawyers and private Web masters,
the declaration immediately gained the support of more than 600 Web
publishers, Internet users and other Chinese "netizens."</TE>
<TE>   Among the 18 initiators of the declaration is Wan Yanhai, Web site
publisher of the AIDS Action Project, a Beijing-based education and
activism group whose offices authorities closed in June. With
reporting on AIDS officially censored in the state media, Wan's Web
site, now on a server outside China, is the only independent source
of information about the impending HIV/AIDS crisis. (A U.N. report
has predicted that 10 million people in China will be infected with
HIV by 2010.) On Aug. 1, Wan initiated a rare act of civil
disobedience in China by circulating an online appeal to all
independent Web publishers, asking them to join him in protesting the
new regulations by turning themselves into authorities for operating
"illegal" Web sites. Since then, Wan has continued to push the
boundaries of free expression by using Internet chat rooms, online
forums and e-mail groups to boldly advocate for his cause. Overseas
organizations have helped amplify domestic voices like Wan's by
providing distribution channels, content that is forbidden
domestically and technological means to evade the firewall. While
Chinese citizens are fighting against Internet censorship, the
reaction from some leading international high-tech corporations has
been shameful.</TE>
<TE>   Since March, more than 300 businesses, government offices,
universities and other organizations have signed the Public Pledge on
Self-Discipline for China's Internet Industry, drafted by the
government-approved Internet Society of China. Signatories agree to
refrain from "producing, posting or disseminating harmful information
that may jeopardize state security and disrupt social stability."
Yahoo, an Internet pioneer that designed one of the Net's most
popular search engines, was among the first foreign companies to sign
the pledge, and a visit to the Yahoo China site demonstrates the
company's compliance. Its search engine has effectively filtered out
the vast majority of sites containing terms usually considered
subversive by the Chinese government--including "human rights,"
"Falun Gong" and "Tiananmen 1989."</TE>
<TE>   This self-censorship is shocking, especially since Yahoo is
currently defending itself on freedom-of-expression grounds in a
legal battle with the French government over the right of French
users to access online auctions of Nazi memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   The growing Internet rights movement is at the forefront of using
Internet technology to open Chinese society. International
corporations can and should facilitate this goal by refusing to abide
by domestic Internet regulations that violate China's international
obligations, including those that come with World Trade Organization
membership. As a first step, corporations should refuse to sign the
self-discipline pledge and instead support the Internet citizens'
rights declaration. The 45.8 million Internet users are also Chinese
citizens, and this is what they want and deserve.</TE>

<BD>Al Meyerhoff is a partner with Milberg, Weiss, Bershad,
Hynes &amp; Lerach. He represents the plaintiffs challenging the Bush
administration decision to open the Mexican border to cross-border
trucking.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the next few weeks, President Bush is likely to issue an executive
order opening the Mexican border to cross-border trucking. Tens of
thousands of big rigs from Mexico will then be free to travel
throughout the United States--bringing with them serious
environmental consequences, especially for California and other
border states. Caving in to diplomatic pressure, the Bush
administration has chosen to simply ignore American environmental
laws. Bush is compromising public health in the process.</LD>
<LD>   The North American Free Trade Agreement originally provided that
Mexican trucks be allowed access to border states in 1995 and
throughout the U.S. by January 2000. Citing safety concerns, however,
the Clinton administration allowed Mexican trucks to operate only
within a 20-mile buffer area inside the border. In 2001, a NAFTA
trade panel took up the issue, ultimately ordering the U.S. to allow
Mexican trucks to operate throughout the U.S. Since then, Bush has
indicated his intention to lift the Clinton moratorium, insisting
that NAFTA requires him to do so. But there are ways to satisfy the
requirements of NAFTA other than by simply throwing open our borders.</LD>
<TE>   Mexico's fleet of tractor trailers is much older--and
dirtier--than that in the U.S. Before 1993, truck engines in Mexico
were unregulated. Even engines manufactured more recently don't begin
to meet environmental standards being phased in for U.S. engines.
Yet, in deciding to open the border, the administration declined to
consider the environmental impacts of these diesel-spewing behemoths.</TE>
<TE>   As a condition to opening the border, Congress required the
Department of Transportation to promulgate regulations governing the
process. But in doing so, the agency simply ignored the mandate of
the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires that the
government fully evaluate the impact of any "major federal action" on
the environment and public health. Instead, without any significant
evidentiary or scientific support, the department issued a "finding
of no significant impact," insisting that opening the borders would
not harm the environment.</TE>
<TE>   In reaching its conclusion--a ludicrous one in light of studies
showing that Mexican trucks on average generate 150% more
smog-forming nitrogen oxide and 200% more dangerous particulate
matter than U.S. trucks--the administration looked at the effect of
opening the border on the nation as a whole. The potentially heavy
impact on border states was balanced against the far lighter effect
on, say, New England states.</TE>
<TE>   This was ridiculous. California already has some of the most
polluted, unhealthy air in the nation, the cause of respiratory
disease and premature death. The brunt of increased Mexican truck
traffic will fall most heavily on Southern California, in
municipalities like Los Angeles, which is already far out of
compliance with the federal Clean Air Act. In fact, the act prohibits
the federal government from causing or contributing "to any new
violation of any [clean air] standard [or] increas[ing] the frequency
or severity of any existing violation" in already troubled areas.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed presidential action once again raises a question
central to the NAFTA debate: Must increased free trade come at the
expense of American environmental standards and the public health?</TE>
<TE>   The short answer is no. Had the Bush administration chosen to
follow American environmental laws rather than run roughshod over
them, the transition to increased cross-border trucking from Mexico
could have occurred in an orderly fashion. The trade agreement with
Mexico requires us to allow Mexican trucks access to U.S. roads, but
that doesn't mean we have to exempt the trucks from all U.S. laws.</TE>
<TE>   Pre-1994 trucks, which make up 80% to 90% of Mexico's fleet, could
be excluded from U.S. roads unless they were retrofitted. Better
emissions inspections at the border could ensure that Mexican trucks
met U.S. standards. Illegal so-called "defeat devices" (which allow
diesel engines to run dirty when on the open road), now being removed
from U.S. trucks, could be removed from Mexican trucks as well. And,
most important, the Bush administration could require that, starting
in 2007, any Mexican truck entering the U.S. meet the very strict
engine and fuel standards that will apply in the U.S. starting that
year. Instead, the administration, intoxicated with the idea of
deregulation, simply assured us there would be no negative effect.</TE>
<TE>   To oppose this threat to public health, a collection of
environmental, labor and business organizations, including the
California Trucking Assn., Public Citizen, the Teamsters, the
California Labor Federation, the Natural Resources Defense Council
and the Planning and Conservation League, has filed a lawsuit in the
9th Circuit Court of Appeals. California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has
supported the suit as a friend of the court. But the Bush Justice
Department has indicated that the administration will not wait on the
court's action to open the border to Mexican trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Congress acted to prevent the Bush administration from
moving ahead. Hearings were held, testimony was taken and concerns
were expressed about the safety of Mexican trucks and the training of
their drivers--as well as about possible terrorism. As a result, by a
wide majority, the Republican-controlled House passed a rider to the
Transportation Department appropriations bill preventing Bush from
opening the border. The Senate followed suit, but in the face of a
veto threat compromise legislation was enacted requiring various
safety checks before the border could be opened. Those safety checks
must address environmental concerns, because a truck that increases
the risk of cancer or other diseases through its pollution is not a
safe truck.</TE>

<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>In some ways, it feels like 1991 all over again. Tensions are
mounting by the day between the United States and Iraq. Newspapers
scream headlines like "If Attacked, Israel Might Nuke Iraq" and "The
Target: Saddam."</LD>
<LD>   Yet it's really not the same at all.</LD>
<LD>   Last time around, the situation was tangible, concrete. In the
summer of 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, upsetting the international
order. It was clear that the powers that be, led by the U.S., were
not going to allow a new status quo to take hold. And from the moment
Saddam Hussein declared that, if Iraq were attacked, he would set
fire to "half of Israel," the countdown began. Israelis began
stocking up on gas masks and reserve rations for their shelters and
basements and duct tape and plastic sheeting to create hermetically
sealed rooms for protection against chemical warheads.</LD>
<TE>   This time, it's much more surreal. There was the 9/11 tragedy,
which President Bush keeps hinting has something to do with his
announced intention to remove Hussein from power. But he has not
demonstrated a clear connection between the two. There is no Kuwait,
no announcement from Hussein that he intends to attack Israel, no
concrete reason for a countdown to begin. There is also no grand
coalition being built to carry out a coordinated strategy. Only Bush
and British Prime Minister Tony Blair (with the majority of the
British public opposed to a preventive war).</TE>
<TE>   Here in Israel, the difference between 1991 and today is sharp.
Back then, we were a cohesive nation pulling together as we braced
ourselves for attack. If you listen today only to Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, you might think we
were once again a country united. Our prime minister has outspokenly
urged the Bush administration not to delay a strike against Iraq,
insisting that a postponement "will not create a more convenient
environment for action in the future." The foreign minister, who in
1981 opposed then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin's unilateral military
initiative to attack Iraq's nuclear weapons reactor, has echoed
Sharon's position.</TE>
<TE>   But among the Israeli public, there is a wide divergence of
opinion.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that anyone loves Hussein. Most Israelis would prefer to
see the Iraqi president disappear, along with his aspiration to
develop unconventional weapons and delivery systems that could
threaten Israel's existence.</TE>
<TE>   For some of Israel's pundits, that is reason enough to support the
overthrow of Hussein. "Israel should hope that those calling for war
[in the U.S.] gain the upper hand," independent security analyst
Reuven Pedatzur wrote in a recent newspaper column, "because if
Saddam is not toppled, it will not be long before Israel is
threatened by nuclear weapons, not to mention biological and chemical
ones." This view was seconded by Moshe Arens, Likud defense minister
during the Gulf War, who recently wrote in a newspaper article of his
own that "finally, the world recognizes that the continuation of
Saddam Hussein's quest for nuclear weapons and his increasing
stockpile of ... weapons constitute a danger to the world, and a
means of neutralizing this danger must be found before it is too
late."</TE>
<TE>   The pro-government Jerusalem Post has staked out a similarly
hard-line position. "Ousting Saddam is the linchpin of the war on
terrorism, without which it is impossible to begin in earnest, let
alone win," the paper editorialized recently. "So far, except for
ousting the Taliban, the war has been the equivalent of spraying DDT
against terror; Saddam's fall would begin to drain the swamp."</TE>
<TE>   But other voices are being raised as well. Many in Israel worry
that Sharon's desire for a war in Iraq is more about politics than
policy, that he sees war as a way to keep the country's attention off
his failings. Haaretz diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn summed it up
this way: "Sometimes it seems as if Saddam was invented by sly
campaign managers as a wonder drug for political distress."</TE>
<TE>   Haaretz's senior commentator, Yoel Marcus, raised in a recent
column the concerns many Israelis have about the possibility of
Sharon's using nuclear weapons in response to an Iraqi attack. "Don't
our leaders realize that they are implying Israel will be the first
atom-bomb dropper since the days of Hiroshima and Nagasaki?" he
asked. "Don't they realize the impact this will have in the Islamic
world?"</TE>
<TE>   Nachum Barnea, the most widely read political commentator in the
country, recently expressed nostalgia for Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's
prime minister during the Gulf War. Considered the most ideological
right-wing prime minister in Israel's history, Shamir was the epitome
of restraint during the Gulf War, staying out of the conflict and
even allowing 39 Scud missiles to land on Israeli soil without
retaliation, so as not to upset the delicate balance in the Middle
East. "Restraint appears to be much more difficult for Sharon and
Peres," Barnea wrote in the newspaper Yediot Aharonot.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the opinions for and against U.S. action in Iraq, there is
a deeper reaction in Israel: weariness. In 1991, the country
mobilized quickly and efficiently to protect its populace, and people
responded with vigor. Today, even the latest announcement that 15,000
rescue workers will be inoculated against smallpox in case of germ
warfare has not motivated the masses to update their anti-chemical
and biological warfare kits. Hussein? Yes, he's a threat. But for
many Israelis, the ongoing suicide bombings, the declining economic
situation and the prospect of early elections in 2003 are more
significant concerns.</TE>

<HD>Girl Trouble</HD>
<DH>Judging by all the recent bad ink, our daughters are having
serious problems. But are they really the demons we've made them out
to be?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN STABINER</AU>
<BD>Karen Stabiner is the author of "All Girls: Single-Sex
Education and Why It Matters."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If girls are made of sugar and spice, the spice must be hot pepper
flakes--or so it would seem from the run of bad press they have
received this summer. A spate of new books tells us our daughters are
mean or aspiring to be, sexually aggressive or about to be, wilder
than we want to think, downright nasty and as self-doubting as ever.
We seem particularly eager to read about the mess we have made: Check
any bestseller list and you will find teen girls in trouble.</LD>
<LD>   "Fast Girls: Teenage Tribes and the Myth of the Slut" by Emily
White provides, according to the jacket copy, "an in-depth look at
the girls who were labeled high school sluts"; Sharon Lamb's "The
Secret Lives of Girls" includes 125 interviews with girls and women
about a hidden world of aggression, power plays and sexuality; and
Rachel Simmons, author of "Odd Girl Out," focuses on what she calls
"the back alleys and hidden corners of girl bullying."</LD>
<TE>   Even an author like Rosalind Wiseman, whose book "Queen Bees and
Wannabes" deals with both boys and girls, finds herself categorized
as a "teen-girls-in-crisis" writer. At a recent National Coalition of
Girls' Schools conference in Rhode Island, Wiseman, co-founder and
president of the Washington, D.C.-based Empower Program, told her
audience that her book was less about the myriad ways girls fall
short of the mark and more about how to teach teens to work together
in a collaborative, cooperative atmosphere. But, she said,
interviewers and reviewers tend to focus only on the part of her book
dealing with girls' inhumanity to girls.</TE>
<TE>   Why the sudden obsession with female adolescent angst? Girls are
actually doing quite well, thank you, attending college in greater
numbers, taking their rightful place in the previously male-dominated
worlds of math, science and technology, and competitive athletics.
Things seem to be going well--except on the bookshelf. There must be
something else going on here.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's this: We are still too quick to consider girls the
second sex. We assume that whatever they are doing, it is wrong. They
eat too little or too much; they are too silent or they wage verbal
warfare. Somewhere along the way, they must have hit a nice stretch
on the continuum, if only we had bothered to tell them.</TE>
<TE>   Our initial concerns were genuine; 10 years ago Carole Gilligan
and Lyn Mikel Brown sounded an important alarm about adolescent girls
and their sinking self-esteem. But in our guilt at having missed the
early signs of trouble, we seem to have overreacted. Now we take the
approach that girls need to be closely monitored, lest they slip
another problem by.</TE>
<TE>   As eating disorders became commonplace--the topic of
movies-for-television--we watched for new crises to confront.
Self-mutilation held our interest, but only briefly, and now we have
moved into the more promising field of psychosocial difficulties. The
potential is tremendous. A girl no longer has to show physical
symptoms to be branded a troubled teen. All she has to do is exhibit
some of what used to be considered typical transitional behavior, and
she risks being pigeonholed.</TE>
<TE>   Of course these problems exist. They break parents' hearts and
girls' spirits, and they require our compassion and attention. The
question is, are they as pervasive as they seem? Ask a teenage girl
and you might be surprised at how angry her answer is.</TE>
<TE>   I recently spent a year at Marlborough School, a private girls'
school in Los Angeles, and at the Young Women's Leadership School of
East Harlem, a new public school for disadvantaged girls in New York
City, researching a book on single-sex education. If the students I
met are any indication, girls do not see themselves the same way the
headlines do, and they are sick of their bad reputation. They would
like the world to know that good girls exist, and that the
aberrational behavior we read so much about does not represent the
majority.</TE>
<TE>   They reject the pathologizing of girlhood--the notion that almost
anything a girl does is by definition abnormal. While I was at
Marlborough, cultural historian Joan Jacobs Brumberg spoke to
students about her research into girls' self-image and how it had
changed in the last 100 years. She spoke of what she called an
epidemic of "bad body fever" among today's teenagers--a preoccupation
with good looks rather than good work. She talked about narcissism;
she encouraged the girls to think about the larger universe.</TE>
<TE>   Parents and faculty loved the presentation. The seniors who met
with Brumberg afterward did not. They were tired, they told her, of
being tarred with the same old brush; they were appalled by girls who
obsessed over losing five pounds and keeping their boyfriends. They
wondered at the illogic of adult expectations: In addition to being
excellent students, they were supposed to eat healthily, get enough
exercise and make a commitment to good grooming--but if they did so,
someone was sure to accuse them of worrying too much about their
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   As for the girls in East Harlem, they were on a quest to be the
first in their families to attend college and, in many cases, the
first to graduate from high school. The leaders of the class that I
followed were the ones who put in overtime to bring their grades and
test scores up to competitive levels. Girls who made the mistake of
acting up in class were shunned by their classmates, exiled to back
tables and left there unless they were prepared to make a better
effort. When a couple of girls did not move up with their ninth-grade
class because they had failed to heed warnings about their
performance, the survivors regarded them with genuine sorrow and
worked harder.</TE>
<TE>   The payoff came when they graduated in June, each one going on to
a four-year college, except for the one girl who had chosen to enter
the military. I have never attended such a jubilant graduation, with
"Pomp and Circumstance" played to ebullient shrieks and applause from
joyful relatives and friends.</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of good girls out there. We just don't hear much
about them.</TE>
<TE>   We cannot blame the media, though the tossing of blame in that
direction has become a semiprofessional sport. If we get trouble at
the top of the hour or the top of the page, it's because the ratings
reveal that is what most of us want.</TE>
<TE>   We have to look at our own expectations instead.</TE>
<TE>   We worry that our boys act up in class, let their attention
wander, have trouble expressing their feelings, but we believe they
will grow out of it someday. Our girls? We worry that they will fall
prey to an ever-larger assortment of chronic ills, all of which share
a component of self-doubt. Is it their doubt, or ours? We assume that
girls are more vulnerable and less resilient than boys--which is
unfair to every girl who wakes up in the morning feeling good.
Perhaps the real self-improvement work has to come from adults as we
discard a lingering, subtle sexism--a stale expectation of
strife--and pay attention to the girls, everywhere, who are ready to
do just fine.</TE>

<BD>Ron Unz, a political activist and Silicon Valley
software developer, is the founder and chairman of Wall Street
Analytics, a financial services software company.</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>Regulators looking at how stock options are accounted for have seen
cause for concern. I see opportunity.</LD>
<LD>   It's true that when actual expenses don't appear on an operating
statement it can make for some rude surprises--as at Enron and
elsewhere. But faced with the worrisome risk of our economy falling
into a double-dip recession, perhaps we should look at the potential
for even more creative exploitation of off-the-books transactions.</LD>
<LD>   All we have to do is follow the odd logic of numerous corporate
CEOs and Wall Street strategizers to its obvious conclusion. They
have vigorously defended the practice of not counting stock options
as expenses, arguing that since no actual dollars leave the corporate
treasury, no actual expense has been incurred. Under this analysis,
profits per share might fall but total profits would not.</LD>
<TE>   So why not apply this same argument to the issuance not just of
options--which give someone the right to purchase stock at a
guaranteed price--but also to the issuance of stock itself. Issuing
new stock also involves no direct outlay of corporate cash. So
shouldn't it too be excluded as an operating expense? Imagine the
possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   First, since stock has a clear market value, workers and
executives could easily be persuaded to take their entire
compensation in that form, some of which they could then sell to pay
their ordinary living expenses. This business innovation would allow
corporations to eliminate all salary costs from an accounting
perspective, since no actual cash is spent. Corporate profits could
soar, enormously boosting our economy.</TE>
<TE>   Even better, similar financial engineering would allow
corporations to barter their shares or options for rent, raw
materials, advertising, capital equipment and everything else they
require, thereby completely eliminating all these burdensome drags on
profit margins. Since not a single actual dollar would change hands,
corporations could reasonably reduce their total accounting expenses
to zero, allowing profits to equal revenues. Such an elimination of
all business expenses in our society would lead to an unprecedented
economic boom, far surpassing that achieved at the height of the
late-1990s bubble.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, if the issuance of stock were not considered an
accounting expense, companies could abandon the difficult task of
producing and selling actual goods or services, and instead could
switch their business activity to merely issuing and selling stock
and options directly into the marketplace. This would generate
enormous revenue at no cost whatsoever, with the only necessary raw
materials being blank stock certificates, which would be purchased
with--what else?--stock certificates.</TE>
<TE>   Although such financial techniques might seem risky, they have
already been partially exploited by some of America's largest and
most prestigious corporations, particularly in the innovative Silicon
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Take the case of mighty Intel: Its official 2001 profits would
have been reduced by over 80% without this effective use of options
accounting technology. In an even bolder use of the concept, hugely
profitable Cisco Systems would have actually lost vast sums of money
throughout most of the last decade had it fully accounted for the
stock options it issued. Financial analysts have suggested that
Cisco's reported 1998 profit of $1.35 billion would have become a
loss of $4.9 billion had it not employed this remarkable technique.
Effective use of options allowed Cisco to report the massive and
endlessly rising profits that led its market value to peak just north
of $500 billion, briefly establishing it as the most valuable company
in the world in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that Cisco has since encountered a few rough patches,
with more than $400 billion of that market value having disappeared.
But if Cisco CEO John Chambers remains steadfast in his commitment to
options technology--becoming a national leader on the issue and a
prominent speaker at President Bush's recent economic forum in
Waco--then why should the rest of us shy away?</TE>
<TE>   Chambers has demonstrated his patriotic commitment to his
principles by personally raising or directly contributing millions of
dollars to the Republican Party over the last several years, an
exertion made easier by the $239 million he earned by selling much of
his Cisco stock during its better days.</TE>
<TE>   His persuasiveness has led the Bush administration to adopt his
views on this important accounting issue. Meanwhile, Chambers'
high-tech allies have been equally persuasive with America's top
Democratic leaders, perhaps for many of the same underlying reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the effective business use of stock options by Intel and
Cisco are examples so universally typical of other, similar companies
that one could make a plausible case that in recent years the key
technology powering the financial success of Silicon Valley companies
has gradually shifted from the microchip and the fiber-optic strand
to reliance on options finance--which actually seems very closely
related to that Holy Grail of mechanical engineers, the perpetual
motion machine.</TE>
<TE>   Given this fact, perhaps we should encourage these same innovators
to apply their innovations to more mundane practical needs. Exactly
the same theoretical logic that permits companies to avoid counting
their stock options as expenses could easily be used to produce
mechanical devices that would allow us to run our cars without fuel
and our lights without electricity. An eager world awaits.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: We live in Redondo Beach, and our homeowner association
board said they "hired a management company to keep us abreast of all
the new laws."</LD>
<LD>   The management company does not have lawyers on staff, and the
only thing it has done successfully is teach our board how to fine,
penalize and control owners. The board's newfound power of sending
out memos ordering homeowners to "conform" and pushing "uniformity"
and then adding monetary fines is frightening. The board makes so
many demands upon owners that we no longer want to open our mail.</LD>
<LD>   Homeowners who don't do what the management company tells them to
do are threatened with a lawsuit for "diminishing the value of
association property" or the latest threat of "interference with
association business." We don't understand what these things mean.</LD>
<TE>   It is not a matter of board members following proper procedure for
implementing fines; they say they follow the Davis-Stirling Act.
Outstanding fines increase by the amount of penalty, and some fines
take away an owner's right to vote in elections or decision-making
processes affecting the association.</TE>
<TE>   There is a procedure for disputing the fines, but it is a facade.
The fines are purely subjective and are imposed at the whim of
whoever is on the board.</TE>
<TE>   The board delegated the entire subject to a committee that
consists of management company employees, and the notices come from
management on our association letterhead.</TE>
<TE>   The company gets to keep a certain percentage of all the fines it
generates and collects. I believe that much of the dissension is
caused by the prodding of management company personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Does the management company or the board have this authority? What
can happen to those of us who do not pay or abide by these notices?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Assigning the rights to fine homeowners to a management
company that keeps a percentage of the fines sounds like a scam, yet
the present law does not protect homeowners from such scams.
Resolution turns on whether your board followed procedures set forth
in the Davis-Stirling Act for instituting a system of monetary
penalties, and whether it followed those procedures for levying those
fines.</TE>
<TE>   Procedures must be fair. If your board did not follow the law, the
fines are illegal and need not be paid. As a result, any liens placed
on your property are also illegal and must be removed on demand of
the homeowner and at the association's expense.</TE>
<TE>   Failure to remove the illegal liens can result in the one placing
the liens having to pay the homeowner damages, which could include
the attorney's fees needed to have the liens removed.</TE>
<TE>   As for the alleged interference, most management companies raising
this argument do so as a scare tactic, recognizing that most
homeowners are not attorneys and will not know that such claims are
usually without legal or factual basis.</TE>
<TE>   Any claim of interference, especially when the homeowner is
exercising those remaining rights under the law, such as requesting
documents from the board, are efforts to frighten homeowners into not
acting on those rights or ignoring those rights when they move into a
deed-restricted development. Your attorney can advise the best course
of action.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two decades, the median price for condos and homes
in Southern California has risen substantially. If your management
company was only recently hired, it can hardly take credit for the
increase, but its actions might result in a decrease once people
discover that living in your complex makes them subject to management
company whims and the penalties associated with them. The retaining
of a percentage of the fines collected may subject the management
company to other laws, which it may be ignoring, not to mention the
breach of the fiduciary duty of the board to the homeowners in
permitting the management company to keep a portion of the fines.</TE>
<TE>   Your board's actions can have an impact when it's time for you to
sell your home. Unless the liens have been removed, you may have to
pay them before the sale can go through.</TE>
<TE>   Once you have sold, if you can establish that the board failed to
follow the letter of the law when it created and/or assessed the
fines, you may be able to recover them in an action against your
board and the management company. Although the courts may award
attorney's fees, as the prevailing party there is no guarantee this
will happen. If you can afford it, a lawsuit may be your only
alternative.</TE>

<LD>While most associations are a part of the existing landscape when a
new owner moves in, some communities without an association opt to
start one. Such was the case in Mar Vista.</LD>
<LD>   Although it has been around since the early 1900s, the community
didn't form a neighborhood association until 2000. Started by
resident Bryan Gordon and others, the Mar Vista Neighborhood Assn.
oversees 1,200 homes.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike many traditional associations, however, their focus is not
on the color of homes and where to park cars.</LD>
<TE>   "We started the association because we felt that our community
stood to gain a great deal by forming a group that could speak out
for the rights of our neighborhood," said Gordon, who worked on a
project to protect land in the Santa Monica Mountains before moving
to Mar Vista.</TE>
<TE>   "Since creating the association, it's been rewarding to see the
community becoming more cohesive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've spearheaded various beautification projects like tree
plantings, and there have been significant changes in formerly
dangerous traffic patterns. One four-way intersection now has stop
signs and the accident rate has gone down considerably."</TE>

<LD>When Tina Ohmstede moved into a gated condominium complex in Redondo
Beach almost four years ago, she had never lived in a community
association before.</LD>
<LD>   "I was shocked to find out that certain rules are strictly
observed," said Ohmstede, who recalled an occasion when a friend and
her 3-year-old daughter came to visit.</LD>
<LD>   "My friend announced her arrival by giving a little honk on the
car horn, and her little girl yelled for us in a cute little-girl
voice. I thought nothing of it until a week later when I got a letter
from the association board saying that honking or calling to people
from the guest parking is against the rules," Ohmstede said. "I've
become more vigilant now. When visitors come and begin to talk
loudly, I ask them to quiet down."</LD>
<TE>   Known as common interest developments, CIDs are located in many
types of neighborhoods from single-family homes to townhouses and
condominiums--but they are all similar in that they allow individual
owners the use of common property and facilities in exchange for
following the rules and paying required monthly dues. All have a
self-governing system that consists of a board, whose job it is to
oversee the running of the association. Some associations hire a
management company to handle the day-to-day operations; others rely
on volunteer managers.</TE>
<TE>   For some homeowners, associations are viewed as an advantage, a
convenient way to keep order in the community and prevent what they
consider to be potential chaos, such as motor homes languishing in
driveways and oddly painted units. More independent and creative
souls, however, find the rules too restrictive.</TE>
<TE>   Like them or not, associations have become a part of life for much
of Southern California. Virtually every new development has an
association, and there are more than 34,000 in California alone,
according to the California Department of Real Estate. One in four
Californians lives in a CID, and in Orange County the figure is even
higher--more than 50%.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowner associations grew quickly in the late 1970s as land
availability diminished. The passage of Proposition 13, a 1978
measure that slashed property taxes, also resulted in more limited
public funding for parks, swimming pools and other components of
residential communities. Mandated to provide some of these amenities
to home buyers and seeking to increase home sales, developers began
adding facilities such as swimming pools and clubhouses to their
developments. Associations were formed to oversee the maintenance and
care of such amenities.</TE>
<TE>   Though access to a community pool and freedom from mowing the lawn
are often touted as the big perks of joining an association, those
who choose the CID life know it involves much more.</TE>
<TE>   "Living in an association is a lifestyle choice," said Karen
Conlon, president of the California Assn. of Community Managers, an
organization of association property managers. "You gain access to
common amenities you might normally not be able to afford to build
yourself--such as pools, parks, tennis courts and lakes. But to enjoy
these amenities you must agree to abide by certain standards and
rules. Complications arise when homeowners don't truly understand the
association plan documents before they buy."</TE>
<TE>   The governing document is known as the Declaration of the
Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions, or CC&amp;Rs, which contains the
ground rules for the operation of each association. This often
lengthy document identifies an association's common area and
responsibilities and lists rules by which residents must abide.
Perhaps most important, it explains that the association must collect
assessments, or dues, and that the homeowners must pay those dues.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a contractual obligation between yourself and the
association to pay your dues," Conlon said. "They are like a mortgage
payment. The association is granted the authority by law to lien and
eventually foreclose on your home if you don't pay."</TE>
<TE>   In light of the regulations, some people aren't suited to
association life. For Amy Dee, it required a major adjustment in
attitude. She bought her Anaheim condominium 6 1/2 years ago with no
prior association experience.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very humbling experience when I realized that I had to
comply with a greater power regarding the exterior of my home," she
said. "If you're a creative person who likes to do your own thing,
association life can be tough. My ego took a few bumps and bruises."</TE>
<TE>   One problem Dee encountered was with her mailbox.</TE>
<TE>   "We have exterior mailboxes, but I was concerned about my mail
getting stolen, so I put a mail slot in my door," she said. "The
rules say that all of the mailboxes must match. When they came by for
a routine inspection, they spotted [it], and I had to remove it."</TE>
<TE>   On another occasion Dee had trouble with a satellite dish. When
the dish was installed, she broke a rule by putting it on the patio
roof and exposing wires--the only way she could get reception. The
association began fining her $100 a month for the infraction.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting with the board, she was allowed to paint the wires
an acceptable color. They eventually changed the rules and now allow
satellite dishes on top of patio covers--largely because other
homeowners had similar problems with satellite reception.</TE>
<TE>   If you're in the majority, things can run smoothly in an
association community, said Jason Weissberg, who lives in a
single-family home Tustin Ranch. "If you're not part of the majority,
however, you're out of luck," he said. "We found that out when we
voted to increase the size of the swimming pool and lost. Not enough
families found it important."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the restrictions he's faced, Weissberg agrees with the
belief that rules are enforced to improve the quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   Some homeowners seek out association life for the neat, consistent
lifestyle it can offer.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in a neighborhood where there was trash all over the
place and people didn't upkeep their landscaping," said Christopher
Ruffalo of Tustin Ranch, who is on the association board. "I much
prefer living in a community where everything is well cared for."</TE>
<TE>   Individuals who have the energy and determination to change things
in an association community can become board members, which is an
elected volunteer position. Ruffalo became a board member six months
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be a part of the betterment of the community, get to
know my neighbors and find out about changes before they occur," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Others who served as board members aren't as enamored of the
system. Bill Kelley of Anaheim Hills was a board member for two years
when he lived in Orange and came to a different conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   "Associations can be beneficial and have a viable use in
maintaining property values if they're not carried to the extremes,"
he said. "The trouble begins when you have militant people on the
board with unreasonable ideas. As far as I'm concerned, if someone
paints their house in green trim, even though the rules say all
brown--so what? Pink-striped trim might be troublesome.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge is finding reasonable people with common sense
regarding the use of the association's money. Some people would much
rather wield a big stick, be unfair and conduct themselves
inappropriately."</TE>
<TE>   Although the rules seem nitpicky at times, they can also work in
your favor, as Ohmstede of Redondo Beach has found.</TE>
<TE>   "My unit is right next to the pool, which is great when I'm using
it, but if people are swimming late at night, it's hard for me to
sleep," she said. "One night some very loud people were in the pool.
I called my neighbor, whose job it is to close down the pool at
night. She went out and had them out of that pool within five
minutes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Points to Consider</TE>
<TE>   If you're thinking about buying a home governed by a homeowners
association, consider the following:</TE>
<TE>   * Do you like the idea of abiding by certain rules that dictate
how the exterior of your home looks? Do you see having your home
painted the same color as your neighbors as an asset or a deficit?</TE>
<TE>   * Check out the association's CC&amp;Rs. Do they seem unreasonable? Or
do you agree with most of the rules? Don't assume rules will not be
enforced--they generally are.</TE>
<TE>   * Do you like the idea of living in close proximity to your
neighbors?</TE>
<TE>   * Can you afford the dues?</TE>
<TE>   * How does the board resolve disputes?</TE>
<TE>   * Talk to existing residents regarding the association.</TE>

Managers' Web site at www.cacm.org.</TE>

<LD>This 1926 Glendale house was designed by Lloyd Wright, the son of
architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Lloyd Wright designed several dozen
houses in the L.A. area but is probably best known for his work on
the Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes.</LD>
<LD>   Known as the Derby House for the name of its original owners--a
businessman and his wife--the house is distinctive for its dramatic
use of textured concrete block, wood and stucco. Wright designed
hieroglyphic-like patterns of plants in the blocks.</LD>
<LD>   Except for one bathroom and the designer kitchen, the
well-maintained structure is unaltered. The house is on the National
Register of Historic Places, which is under the domain of the
National Park Service.</LD>
<TE>   About this home: The owners have lived here for 28 years but are
moving to smaller quarters to be closer to their grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $1.2 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: The 3,281-square-foot house has five bedrooms, including
maid's quarters, and 2.75 bathrooms. The lot is 16,000 square feet;
three adjacent lots are available for an extra $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The house has a two-story living room with a fireplace
behind 8-foot-high wrought-iron gates. The grounds have mature oak
trees. The updated kitchen has granite counters, oak floors and
leaded-glass windows. The dining room is hexagonal and has a
floor-to-ceiling fireplace. The house has forced-air heating and
air-conditioning.</TE>

<LD>Red Buttons, the Oscar-winning actor-comedian who has a recurring
role in the Showtime series "Street Time," has sold his Westside home
of 37 years.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not talking about money," Buttons said. "I like the buyer so
much, I gave it to him as a birthday present."</LD>
<LD>   No Realtors were involved in the deal, but industry sources said
the house, on two acres in Bel-Air, could have sold for as much as $8
million.</LD>
<TE>   Built in 1950, the house has five bedrooms and five bathrooms in
slightly more than 5,300 square feet. The home also has a pool.</TE>
<TE>   Buttons, 83, is moving to a penthouse in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   After more than 65 years in the entertainment business, he has no
plans to retire. He still does a stand-up comedy act. "It's fun,"
Buttons said. "I still enjoy it."</TE>
<TE>   The red-haired comic said he got his name for the buttons on his
uniform when he was 16 and working as a singing bellboy in a New York
hotel. Early on in his career, he performed in the Catskills and
played in burlesque.</TE>
<TE>   In 1942, he made his Broadway acting debut in a supporting role in
"Vickie." He made his feature film debut in "Winged Victory" (1944).</TE>
<TE>   Adept in dramatic as well as comedy roles, Buttons earned an Oscar
for best supporting actor in "Sayonara" (1957). In the '50s, he had
his own comedy and variety show on CBS and NBC.</TE>
<TE>   He also appeared in "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" (1969) and
"The Poseidon Adventure" (1972).</TE>
<TE>   Buttons has been in such TV series and specials as "Knot's
Landing," "The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast," "Family Law" and
"Philly," on which he guest starred in January.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rap mogul Marion "Suge" Knight has purchased a Westside home for
about $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The house, on slightly more than six acres, has five bedrooms,
eight bathrooms, a media room and a library in about 10,000 square
feet. Built about three years ago, the contemporary-style home also
has a pool.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, co-founder and chief executive of Death Row Records in
1991, renamed the record company Tha Row last year, when he was
released from prison after serving about five years for a parole
violation on a previous conviction involving a fight at a Las Vegas
hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "Say Hi to the Bad Guy," a debut album by Long Beach rapper
Crooked I, is due out Sept. 24 as the first album from Knight's new
label, and a posthumous album from TLC member Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes
is expected to be released in October.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Knight received notice from the IRS claiming he owes
about $6 million in personal income taxes, according to his attorney
Arthur Barens. The notice came as "a surprise," Barens said at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, 36, is known professionally as "Suge," which is short for
"Sugar Bear," a nickname his father gave him as a child.</TE>
<TE>   In the music business, Knight was successful in persuading
established rappers to join his label and signing up new talent.
Within three years of co-founding Death Row Records, the company
recorded multi-platinum albums for Dr. Dre's "The Chronic," Snoop
Doggy Dogg's "Doggy Style" and the motion-picture soundtrack "Above
the Rim."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Hurwitz, president of Hurwitz-James in Beverly Hills, handled
the home purchase.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brian Beirne, known as "Mr. Rock 'n' Roll" on KRTH-FM where he has
been a radio personality for more than 26 years--and his wife,
Cindee, have put their Hollywood Hills home on the market for
slightly more than $1.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   The couple decided to sell the home because they bought another
one in Newport Beach. In addition to his KRTH show, Beirne also hosts
and produces concerts.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, the Beirnes built and designed the home they are selling.</TE>
<TE>   The four-story contemporary, with an elevator, has four bedrooms
and 5 1/2 bathrooms in slightly more than 5,200 square feet. The
master suite occupies an entire level. The house also has a family or
media room with a bar and a fireplace, a pool, a sauna and panoramic
city and canyon views.</TE>
<TE>   Jonah Wilson at Prudential California, John Aaroe Division in
Beverly Hills, has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bristol, R.I., estate of late actor Anthony Quinn has come on
the market at $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn, who died at 86 in June 2001, bought the 11-acre property,
with 400 feet on the water, eight years ago. The site includes a
7,300-square-foot Bermuda ranch-style home with two guest houses.</TE>
<TE>   The Oscar-winning actor, who played characters such as Zorba the
Greek, is buried on an abutting seven-acre site with a remembrance
garden.</TE>
<TE>   His widow, Katherine, is building a smaller home for herself and
their two children on another part of the property.</TE>
<TE>   Richard S. Dower of Barrington Properties in Barrington, R.I., has
the listing.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Eager to Buy? Join the Club" by Karen Nikos, Aug. 18:
Here's why they are turning down her offers--and I'd also like to
give some suggestions for making a better offer next time:</LD>
<LD>   * 10% down. It's more difficult to get loans with such a low down
payment. She should raise her down payment to between 20% and 25%. If
she had asked the sellers who refused her what offers they accepted,
they probably had a larger down.</LD>
<LD>   The larger the down, the more likely the loan will fund and close.</LD>
<TE>   * She's a first-time buyer. Again, there's a greater chance of the
loan being denied, especially with the 10% down.</TE>
<TE>   The seller wants a stronger deal that's more likely to close on
time. The seller's agent wants the same, so he or she can get paid.</TE>
<TE>   * Those pre-approval letters aren't worth anything, though she
should still keep handing them out for the heck of it.</TE>
<TE>   The lenders write those so the buyer may use them for the loan,
but those letters don't mean a loan will be approved.</TE>
<TE>   There's more to getting a loan than credit score and present
income. There are other factors such as how long you've been at your
present job and salary, profession, employer, whether you're a
first-time buyer, and whether you are a single person living on one
salary.</TE>
<TE>   * Make the offer extremely attractive. Give the sellers all the
terms they want with respect to escrow company, title company, term
of escrow, quick inspections and approvals. Offer to pay for more
costs.</TE>
<TE>   The market is tight now, so make a strong initial offer. Sellers
also don't want to negotiate back and forth, because they know there
may be more back and forth in escrow.</TE>

<TE>   I don't know many agents who would work with a buyer when she's
already working with three others. Another problem I see is resorting
to different out-of-area (sometimes out-of-state) lenders. If I were
a seller reviewing 10 offers ... all things being equal ... I would
go with the local lender. Why? Because local lenders generally work
with appraisers who know the area.</TE>
<TE>   I don't want to experience an eleventh-hour problem with a lender
who doesn't know the difference between Adams Hill and the West Adams
Historic District.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Proposed Closing-Cost Reforms Come Under Fire" by Kenneth
R. Harney, Aug. 11:</LD>
<LD>   Ethical mortgage originators have been anxiously awaiting HUD's
closing-cost reform package. The preliminary report was issued
recently for public comment.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal promises rewards for consumers that it won't ever
deliver, still allows opportunities for unethical originators to
abuse their clients, and creates a new opportunity for lenders to
make money at the consumers' expense.</LD>
<TE>   First, HUD promises $16 billion in savings to consumers. With 10
million loans originated annually, that amounts to $1,600 per
transaction. That far exceeds the entire profit of all settlement
providers in the average transaction, and it is a totally unrealistic
possibility.</TE>
<TE>   Second, mortgage brokers have always had to spell out their fees
on the Good Faith Estimate, but HUD does not have enough staff to
investigate abuses, so there are no penalties for lying.</TE>
<TE>   The new regulations propose that they spell out the maximum fee
they can charge, but that might be well in excess of what they might
expect to charge.</TE>
<TE>   A broker could still list its maximum fee as, say, 2 points while
telling the customer verbally, "That's just what we put on the form,
but we normally charge only 1 point." The broker could then gouge the
customer by charging 1.5 points but still be in compliance with the
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Third, a guaranteed closing-cost package is a joke. Other
settlement providers are regulated too, such as title insurance
companies, whose fee structures are approved by the California
Department of Insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers already have that portion of the package regulated.
Under the regulations, lenders will be able, under the guise of
providing a guaranteed package, to mark up the costs of other
providers, a practice now forbidden.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid being subjected to abuses, borrowers should become
educated about the process so they better understand their choices.
Armed with knowledge, they can then search for an ethical provider.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, it is possible to enter into a contract with a mortgage
broker who commits to a specific fee, not a maximum, for services.
Then ask the broker and lender to specify their fees to the escrow
company so it can prepare an estimated closing statement.</TE>

<HD>Before You Redo Your Loan, Do the Math</HD>
<DH>Mortgage* Even with low rates, refinancing may not be the
best move for everyone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As September approaches, students' thoughts inevitably drift to
back-to-school matters. The rest of us ponder refinancing.</LD>
<LD>   For those who have not yet refinanced during this period of
record-low mortgage interest rates or are thinking about refinancing
again, consider whether it's prudent to do so, mortgage experts say.</LD>
<LD>   It turns out that in some cases, it's actually better to stick
with what you have.</LD>
<TE>   "I've been speaking to three people a day who shouldn't
refinance," said David Soleymani, managing director of First Capital
Corp. in Santa Monica. "A lot of people are not generating enough
savings to offset the cost of refinancing. It's important to do the
math."</TE>
<TE>   Say your current $100,000 loan is at the fixed rate of 7%. Your
mortgage payments are $665 a month. If you refinance now, at about
6%, the monthly payment would be $599. After taxes, monthly savings
come to about $42.</TE>
<TE>   If you refinance with zero points, and just pay the closing
costs--typically $2,500--and divide that by the $42 you're saving
each month, it will take five years to break even on the money you
spent for the new loan. To make this refinancing worthwhile, you
would have to make sure you are staying in the house for at least
five years.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're moving up in three or four years, refinancing is just
not worth it," Soleymani said. "And the smaller the loan, the harder
to justify the refi."</TE>
<TE>   What about borrowers who already have refinanced, but want to inch
a bit lower before rates go up? Those who one year ago refinanced a
$200,000, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 7% interest would save only
$70 or so a month in lower payments with a rate of 6.5%, for example,
not much savings if you factor in closing fees, lenders say.</TE>
<TE>   The one exception to that rule of thumb is homeowners who are
paying private mortgage insurance, said Tom Swanson, a regional sales
manager for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   Mortgage insurance usually is required if the home's equity is
worth less than 20% of the property's value. The typical American
last year gained nearly $10,000 in additional equity. That gain
could, in some situations, save about $100 a month in insurance fees,
making the refinance worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners who already are more than halfway through with their
payments--more than 15 years into a 30-year loan--are advised not to
refinance, however, unless they're still paying a rate of about 9%.</TE>
<TE>   By signing on for another 30 years, the borrower will increase the
amount of interest paid over the life of the loan, said Doug Duncan,
chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America.</TE>
<TE>   But if that borrower simply cannot resist today's low interest
rates, Duncan recommends switching to a 15-year loan, which typically
features lower interest rates but higher monthly payments than
30-year loans.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowers who don't want the higher monthly payments--and
therefore refinance with another 30-year loan--still can pay off the
new loan in 15 years if they religiously make an additional payment
on the principal each month, said Dan Weiss, a mortgage broker at
Golden State Lending Services in Toluca Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss cautioned, however, that "they won't save any money on the
transaction if they use the extra cash every month on movies" instead
of higher payments.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, homeowners whose loans include a prepayment penalty are
strongly cautioned not to refinance.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, prepayment penalties are six months' interest on the
original loan balance. So if the original loan was for $250,000,
penalties would run about $15,000.</TE>
<TE>   The borrower also will have to pay about $2,500 in loan and escrow
fees, way too steep a price to refinance, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "More and more loans have prepayment penalties today," Weiss said.
"Lenders are trying to discourage borrowers from refinancing over and
over again."</TE>

<LD>Built to take the tough conditions of a desert, cactuses may seem
unfriendly, warding off all comers with sharp spines and prickly
hairs. But during the season (which differs for each plant) when the
cactus erupts in come-hither blooms meant to reel in pollinators,
spiky notocactus and echinocereus sport red and orange topknots;
mammillarias don crowns of pink, and the barrel-shaped discocactus
all but disappears under a white chapeau unfurling at night in a
cloud of perfume.</LD>
<LD>   "People are drawn to cactuses for their character and shape. But
the flowers are an added bonus," says David Bernstein, owner of
California Nursery Specialties Cactus Ranch, a Reseda nursery that
focuses on succulents. While each blossom might open only for a day
or two, many blooms can succeed each other on a single plant in a
show that lasts weeks or even months. With certain plants, such as
mammillarias, vivid fruit may follow the bloom and carry the party on
longer.</LD>
<LD>   Since most cactuses start growing when it's warm, most flower in
L.A. from late winter through spring and taper off in summer heat.
Those with bright blooms usually pop in sunlight and close up when
the sun departs. Their pollinators are day-active-birds, bees, flies
and other insects. Paler blooms, more apt to open at night, attract
nocturnal moths and bats, and they're often fragrant.</LD>
<TE>   Take Cereus peruvianus, one of the best-known night bloomers. Come
June, its creamy, 6-inch-wide flowers fill the air with a scent like
citrus. And long after the petals fall, you can enjoy the
fruit-called "cactus apple" or pitaya in Spanish. ''It's as sweet and
sugary as a kiwi and quite expensive if you can even find it in a
store,'' Bernstein says.</TE>
<TE>   The blooms of echinopsis, or Easter lily cactus, can be bigger
than the plant itself, rising around the squat green ball on multiple
stalks to form a 10-inch-tall forest. Then there are the splashy
red-hot or purple garlands that transform the otherwise rather
repulsive rat's tail cactus, and the fingerlike protuberances of
cleistocactus, pollinated by hummingbirds.</TE>
<TE>   Many cactuses need a couple of years' growth before they bloom.
For others, the wait can be even longer. The saguaro, which may soar
to 50 feet in the wilds of Arizona, blooms only when it's old-and
almost never in cultivation. Similarly, Cephalocereus senilis , the
aptly named "old man," with its shaggy white hair, seldom flowers
outside its habitat in Central Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The trick to coaxing out cactus blooms is to get plants to grow
well from the beginning. Bernstein starts his in a good,
fast-draining potting mix (he recommends half perlite and half
organic matter, or else a blend formulated for succulents) and waters
sparingly in winter to discourage rot. When warm weather arrives, he
says, it's time to water well, whenever the soil feels dry to touch.</TE>
<TE>   "Extra water and nutrients, especially for a potted plant, helps
it send out new growth, and that growth is what the flowers form on."
When you water, you should also fertilize.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein, who began collecting cactuses as a child 40 years ago,
feeds his own plants with an all-purpose, balanced, water-soluble
granular food, mixing in one-eighth tablespoon per gallon of water.
"Feeding a little bit more often is better than giving plants huge
meals once in a while," he says.</TE>
<TE>   In the cactus world, a lot can happen in a week. Those wartlike
growths on your chamaecereus become bright-red stars; your thorny
hoodia develops lavender cups; your notocactus holds a small bouquet
very gently amid its spines.</TE>

<HD>The Real America Revealed Through the Eyes of an Italian</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CIAO, AMERICA!, By Beppe Severgnini, Broadway, $21.95</LD>
<LD>   As the rest of the world frets over how the U.S. stands on United
Nations policies, global warming, Middle East hostilities and just
about everything else, it's reasonable for an American to wonder:
What do these foreigners know, and what do they think about the
smaller day-to-day workings of these United States?</LD>
<LD>   One gentle, amusing way to approach that question is this slim,
wry book from Severgnini, an Italian newspaper columnist and
correspondent for the Economist who spent a year in Washington, D.C.,
in the mid-1990s and returned briefly in 2000. He knows plenty about
us now.</LD>
<TE>   And reading him, you get a sometimes startling perspective on
minutiae from his daily life as a Georgetown renter: his great
difficulty acquiring a credit card (because, of course, he has no
debts); his astonishment at the ease of setting up a new telephone
number (one phone call); his hilarious and disquieting account of
himself and his Washington neighbors, cowering in the face of
defiantly unreliable city garbage men.</TE>
<TE>   "America reveals itself in the little things," Severgnini writes.
"And to discover them, you need the inquisitiveness of a new arrival
and the patience of a beachcomber, one of those mildly inappropriate
individuals who roam the shores in search of small treasures. The
seashore is America. The mildly inappropriate individual is me."</TE>
<TE>   Structured to follow him through the months of his year here,
Severgnini's book displays a consistently light touch, remarkable
given that his prose was first written for an Italian audience, then
passed through the filter of translator Giles Watson.</TE>
<TE>   In the course of the author's year, you do realize that
Georgetown, with its polymath population and general affluence, may
not be a perfect stand-in for American society at large. Also, for
this 21st century reader, some of Severgnini's riffs on life in the
'90s seemed too stale to save between hard covers, most notably his
quips on home computing and the ironies of staging the 1994 World Cup
competition in America.</TE>
<TE>   Also, there are the inevitable generalizations. Some are
irresistible. Of a Thanksgiving gathering, he writes that "we don't
say thanks in Italy--if we're satisfied, we merely refrain from
complaining."</TE>
<TE>   But as in so many books of casual cultural encounter--even gems
like Adam Gopnik's French tale of two years ago, "Paris to the
Moon"--the text loses traction with just about every sweeping
pronouncement, and gains it with each detail from the supermarket or
backyard. Severgnini is great with those smaller moments, from
house-hunting to the art of yard sale management. Here he is on being
an Italian in a sea of American ethnic census statistics:</TE>
<TE>   "We're not blacks. Neither are we Anglos. Quasi-Hispanics,
probably. In that case, we're going to have to work on our
pronunciation of nachos</TE>

<TE>   CALIFORNIA THE BEAUTIFUL, Photos by Galen Rowell,  VIA Books,
$16.95</TE>
<TE>   Galen Rowell, who ranks behind Ansel Adams and ahead of just about
everybody else among visual chroniclers of California, was among four
people killed in a small-plane crash Aug. 11 near Bishop, Calif. The
nature photographer's death at age 61 came just as VIA Books (a
creation of the California State Automobile Assn. in cooperation with
the Auto Club of Southern California) was releasing a collection of
85 color photos by Rowell with companion California quotations, from
Jack London to Joan Didion, compiled by Peter Beren.</TE>
<TE>   The format is curiously small for what would usually be called a
coffee-table book--it's just 6 1/2 inches square--but the price has
been reduced commensurately. And Rowell, who hiked and climbed
extensively in California's high country to capture many of his
pictures, is in all his color-drenched, wide-angled,
Sierra-cherishing glory here. These are the sorts of images that some
conservationists call "eco-pornography" -- extraordinary features,
theatrically lit, with little room for a homely field or stream in
humdrum midday light. But I see the book as self-help. Here are some
great places, Rowell and company are telling us. Now go find them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TIMEOUT: Rome, Eating &amp; Drinking, Penguin Books, $11.95</TE>
<TE>   This is part of a new series from the people who produce TimeOut
magazine, usually an excellent source for night life information in
London, Paris and New York. The first batch of these guidebooks
includes volumes on Rome and Barcelona, each 220 pages. Their size is
pocket-friendly. Their color illustrations are copious. The maps are
comprehensible. The prose, produced by staffers in London, is
occasionally Eurocentric (if you don't know that Mr. Whippy is an ice
cream snack or that Italy's soccer team is unlikely to win the Six
Nations Rugby Tournament, some punch lines don't work so well) but
witty and thorough.</TE>
<TE>   But what's this on page 4, and page 8 and page 54? It's paid
advertising, peppered throughout the 220 pages. I expect this in the
magazine, and it might not bother me much if these guides were priced
lower than comparable others. But Lonely Planet, to name one
competitor, has managed to put out its own new condensed guide to
Barcelona for $11.99 with no ads. It's good to be assured (as we are
on page 2) that TimeOut's reviewers visit eateries and bars
anonymously and make no deals to provide positive coverage. But
nobody goes to a movie theater to see the commercials beforehand
(even if they're for a fine newspaper), and nobody buys an
independent guidebook to read pitches from restaurateurs.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So many Americans are vegetarians that numerous tour operators,
travel consultants and summer camps have started to specialize in
vacations for them.</LD>
<LD>   One of the older organizations assisting vegetarian vacationers is
Green Earth Travel, founded in 1991 by travel veteran Donna
Zeigfinger. She organizes trips not simply for vegetarians but for
dedicated vegans, who do not eat fish, fowl or milk products. Call
Green Earth Travel, (888) 246-8343, or visit Zeigfinger's Web site,
at www.vegtravel.com, which offers extensive listings of vegetarian
bed-and-breakfasts in North America, Europe, Central America and the
Caribbean and postings on numerous veggie tours.</LD>
<LD>   If you're interested in bicycle touring in Britain, you might want
to contact Bicycle Beano Cycling Holidays. Although the firm
acknowledges that most of its clients are not vegetarians,
participants are served a gourmet vegan or vegetarian breakfast and
dinner each day and are dropped off at pubs (where vegetable-only
options are readily available) for lunch. Passengers cycle throughout
Britain, including the Upper Wye Valley in Wales and Pembrokeshire
Coast National Park. Rates range from $85 to $115 per day and include
breakfast, tea and dinner, accommodations, route sheets and the
services of a cycling guide and mechanic. Contact Bicycle Beano,
011-44-1982-560-471 or www.bicycle-beano.co.uk.</LD>
<TE>   VegiVentures Holidays, a British firm founded in 1989 by chef
Nigel Walker, organizes at least 10 group tours a year in Britain,
Peru and Turkey. The tours vary in their focus but always emphasize
vegetarian (or vegan) meals. During an English Lakes District trip,
for instance, mornings begin with an optional "stretch, breathing and
movement" class, and the rest of the day is spent trekking the
surrounding hills and mountains. For information, write to
VegiVentures, Castle Cottage, Castle Acre, Norfolk PE32 2AJ, England;
011-44-1760-755-888, www.vegiventures.com.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet is a growing source of information, enabling
vegetarians to share their recommendations with like-minded
travelers. Helpful Web sites for vegetarian travelers include
www.vegdining.com, www.vegsource.com/travel, www.vrg.org,
www.vegeats.com, www.vegetarian.about.com and
www.vegetarianworldguides.com.</TE>

<KH>Shopping: Denmark</KH>
<HD>Exploring Copenhagen, by Design</HD>
<DH>Clean, cool classics of mid-century modern furniture are
hot again as the capital celebrates the creations of Arne Jacobsen
and others</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DALE M. BROWN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>COPENHAGEN</DL>
<LD>Unlike some of our friends, we are lukewarm shoppers, particularly
when it comes to household furnishings. We don't like the overstuffed
items we see in the popular stores around the Washington, D.C., area,
where we live. But whenever we are in design-conscious Denmark, where
furniture is exquisitely made and unpretentious, we confront
temptation at every turn.</LD>
<LD>   Inevitably we end up coveting far more than we can buy. As we've
found over the years, bargains on high-ticket items await Americans
in Copenhagen. And there's no better year to go shopping here than
this one, as Danes celebrate the centenary of the birth of one of
their greatest designers and architects: Arne Jacobsen.</LD>
<LD>   Jacobsen, who died in 1971, may not be as familiar to Americans as
those other icons of modern design, Ray and Charles Eames, but all
three shared the ability to create household items of beauty and
simplicity that remain timeless today.</LD>
<TE>   Jacobsen's talents were multiple. Besides being an architect, he
was a superb watercolorist, an outstanding gardener and, like the
Eameses, a brilliant industrial designer, not just of furniture but
also of lamps, textiles, flatware, porcelain and other accouterments
of contemporary living. In the 1950s, Jacobsen, Hans Wegner and Finn
Juhl, among others, put Denmark on the world cultural map and gave
Danish furniture its reputation. Jacobsen, in particular, embraced
new technology and materials, using industrial processes to full
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   My wife, Liet, and I were in Copenhagen to attend a wedding in
July, a perfect time to be there because the Jacobsen centenary was
well underway. Denmark has gone all out to celebrate its native son,
with some companies reissuing several of his smaller designs in
limited editions. A huge retrospective of his work opens Friday at
the Louisiana Modern Art Museum, which, its name notwithstanding,
lies a few miles north of Copenhagen. The show will continue through
Jan. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly everywhere we went in the downtown part of the city, we
came upon examples of Jacobsen's legacy: buildings--the startling
block-long Bank of Denmark, with its six-story-tall lobby, for
one--and furniture. For sheer ubiquity, nothing beats his Egg and
Swan swivel chairs, which crop up in houses, apartments, offices and
shops all across the capital.</TE>
<TE>   The chairs are renowned for their sculpted contours and comfort.
In recent years they have become the darlings of art directors
because of their suave, quintessential modernity. Hardly a month goes
by when I don't spot one or the other in an ad or TV commercial or on
a magazine cover. Though more than four decades have passed since
they were designed, they are still so popular that production can
barely keep up with demand.</TE>
<TE>   Today, European, Asian and American collectors seem ever ready to
pay big bucks for Danish pieces from the '30s, '40s, '50s and
'60s--the prices depending on the items' rarity and condition.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two things you can sell forever," said Simon Andrews of
Christie's auction house in London: "the Eames lounge chair and the
Jacobsen Egg chair." Three years ago at a sale in Sweden, an early
Egg in tan leather and its accompanying ottoman fetched the highest
price ever paid for a Jacobsen piece: $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   Several stores, such as Dansk Mobelkunst and Klassik, have sprung
up in Copenhagen to cater to the new demand for the old originals. As
a measure of how much the interest in Danish design has grown in
recent years, two Americans living in Denmark, Marilyn and Reese
Palley, are trying to list every example of Danish furniture designed
and produced between the early days of the 20th century and the
present. So far, their database, which they are assembling under the
sponsorship of the RealDania Foundation, contains more than 10,000
items and 42,000 images. It should be available online this fall.</TE>
<TE>   To immerse ourselves in Jacobsen, we stayed at the 20-story
Radisson SAS Royal Hotel, which opened in 1960 diagonally across from
Tivoli, Copenhagen's charming amusement park. Not only was the
steel-and-glass structure designed by Jacobsen; so was everything in
it, from door handles, faucets, tableware and ashtrays to all the
furniture. In fact, the Egg and Swan first saw the light of day at
the Royal.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Jacobsen's international reputation, the furnishings and
much else that he designed received less than sensitive treatment
during a modernization several years ago. On a previous visit, I saw
a Swan, sitting forlornly in a corner, that had been reupholstered in
floral chintz and turned into an ugly duckling.</TE>
<TE>   Taste having come full circle, Jacobsen is back. The hotel
recently underwent a two-year-long, $10.5-million renovation,
bringing it into the 21st century but sacrificing some rare Jacobsen
features like the exquisite wenge wood paneling in the guest rooms.
In the earlier remodeling, the paneling had been painted white; now
it had to undergo the further indignity of being ripped out.</TE>
<TE>   During the hotel's recent face-lift, many Jacobsen furnishings
found their way into the marketplace and the hands of collectors.
Though the hotel has been altered, enough of Jacobsen survives
here--from the cantilevered lobby with its floating spiral staircase
to its top-floor restaurant with views over Copenhagen--to make
staying there worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   Newly manufactured examples of his furniture and lighting are
evident in every room, but particularly in No. 606, which has been
preserved as Jacobsen conceived it. Light green and restfully serene,
the room draws architects, designers and lovers of good design who
are willing to pay $513 a night to inhabit it.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever we are in Copenhagen, Liet and I make a point of visiting
Illums Bolighus, one of Denmark's most exciting home furnishings
stores, part of a series of elegant, interconnected shops on the
city's walking street, Stroget. Georg Jensen (silver), Royal
Copenhagen (porcelain) and Holmegaard (glass) are some of the other
stores in the glittering complex.</TE>
<TE>   We furnished the living room of our first apartment largely from
Illums Bolighus, and we regard the store as a museum of modern Danish
design where, happily enough, everything is for sale. Now, thanks to
the worldwide interest in mid-century modern decor, Illums Bolighus
is once again featuring Danish furniture classics of the '40s, '50s
and '60s, as well as some from earlier decades when the Danish design
movement was beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Some pieces displayed at Illums Bolig- hus never went out of
production. Others have been recently reintroduced to meet demand. We
saw a leather and mahogany handcrafted Chieftain chair designed by
Finn Juhl in 1949. Juhl was considered the most cosmopolitan of the
Danish designers, and his furniture is particularly elegant in
conception and execution. Illums Bolighus prices the Chieftain at
$6,374, and it's worth every penny, especially because only 78 were
made in Juhl's lifetime and the current production is small. The
Chieftain was beyond our budget, but there are many more affordable
pieces.</TE>
<TE>   The store sells the Egg in hand-stitched wool upholstery for
$3,194; in Washington, D.C., it starts at $8,116 and goes up. The
sleeker leather version fetches $5,170 in Denmark, $9,871--and
more--across the Atlantic. (The hand-stitching accounts, in part, for
the cost; only six or seven chairs can be produced in a week by this
meticulous method, which enhances the Egg's flowing contours.)</TE>
<TE>   On this trip, we dropped by Illums Bolighus with a mission. We
needed wool fabric in several shades of blue for four chairs, two of
them designed by Juhl, which we had bought in the 1960s and had since
banished to the basement of our house. Their beautifully crafted teak
frames were too handsome to discard, and we held on to them, hoping
that someone in the family would see their value. They caught the eye
of my younger daughter, Marissa, a furniture designer in New York,
who laid claim to them for her apartment and asked us to buy
upholstery for them.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of Bo Overgaard, a salesman fluent in English--as
many Danes are--we found the right fabric, soft yet tightly woven for
durability, and ordered several yards of it. Then we wandered among
the furniture on display, excited to see that some of the old
classics, once produced only in teak or rich, dark rosewood, are now
available in a range of light, fine-grained woods like beech and
maple.</TE>
<TE>   As Overgaard explained, it is still cheaper to buy furniture in
Denmark and ship it home than to purchase Danish pieces stateside.
For one thing, no importers are involved, nor is there a dealer's
markup to inflate prices. What's more, on orders of more than 300
kroner (about $39) in Illums Bolighus or any Danish shop, Americans
are exempt from the 20% VAT, the value-added tax that Danes must pay
on their purchases. The saving handily covers shipping expenses. Even
taking U.S. import duty into account, Americans who buy in quantity,
Overgaard said, can make up the cost of air fare.</TE>
<TE>   Costs can be cut further if you buy during Illums Bolighus'
monthlong sales in January and August.</TE>
<TE>   Another furnishings store we enjoy browsing in is Paustian, which,
like Illums Bolighus, sells new versions of 20th century classics.
Their line includes Jacobsen and Eames and also the work of
contemporary designers around the world, such as Frank Gehry and
Philippe Starck. The lofty and airy store on Copenhagen's waterfront
was designed by Jorn Utzon, the architect of the Sydney Opera House
in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Out of curiosity, we spent much of a morning strolling along
Bredgade, a sedate street that runs past one of the avenues leading
to the four Amalienborg palaces, home of Queen Margrethe and other
members of the royal family. On Bredgade are many shops specializing
in modern antiques. (Toward its terminus is the Industrial Arts
Museum, which houses masterpieces of the Danish design movement. The
wing featuring them is closed for renovation but is scheduled to
reopen in September. A couple of years ago, Liet and I spent an hour
or so examining its chronological display of items, which gives an
excellent overview.)</TE>
<TE>   Browsing in the stores, we were relieved to find more reasonable
prices than we expected; some of the furniture was going for less
than newly produced counterparts. For $1,597 we could have bought a
used mahogany-and-black-leather version of Hans Wegner's the Chair.
(Yes, it's called that, and it's even honored on a Danish postage
stamp.) The airy, long-legged, sculpted Chair is available new--the
design remains in production more than 50 years after its
conception--at Illums Bolighus for $2,236. That means that two Wegner
chairs we own were a once-in-a-lifetime bargain. When I bought them
fresh from Wegner's workshop in the late '50s, they were $145 each.</TE>
<TE>   Even our smaller Danish items have shot up in value. A gourd-like
stoneware pitcher I couldn't resist buying when I was a graduate
student in Copenhagen in 1954 now goes for $653. And an enameled
metal salad bowl we use daily has climbed from $7 to $98.</TE>
<TE>   Designer Danish furniture and household items are obviously a good
investment, but they are worth far more than money to us. Not only
are our chairs comfortable but they are also exquisitely made, a rare
conjunction of traditional craft methods and modern form that has all
but vanished in the commercial world of the 21st century. They have
yielded years of pleasure. What's more, they are something to pass on
to our daughters and, in all likelihood, their children.</TE>

<HD>Delta Charges $40 for Checking a Third Bag</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Checking a third bag will cost you $40 under a policy that Delta Air
Lines began Aug. 15, the day after announcing it.</LD>
<LD>   Although the short notice caused grumbling among consumer
advocates, the fee is less than several other airlines charge. Under
the policies, you can check two bags for free and carry on one bag on
domestic flights. Weight and size limits for international flights
vary; check with the airline.</LD>
<LD>   Since April, Northwest has charged $80 for a third checked bag for
passengers; first-class passengers can check three bags for free.
Continental implemented an $80 fee in May. United charges $75 and
Alaska Airlines, $50.</LD>
<TE>   Delta said it was imposing the fee to "better manage the dramatic
rise in checked baggage in our system." Since Sept. 11, customers
have been checking about 20% more luggage, it said.</TE>

<HD>Flooding Scuttles Cruise Ships Along Elbe, Danube Rivers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cruise operators on the Danube and Elbe rivers canceled and rerouted
trips last week as record floods displaced thousands and killed
scores of Germans and Eastern Europeans. The outlook for this week
remained uncertain as of the Travel section's press time Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The flooding affected hundreds of passengers, many of whom were
loaded onto buses or transferred to other vessels. Some cruise
companies were declining refunds to customers whose cruises were
altered instead of canceled, relying on standard disclaimers that let
them change itineraries for situations, such as the weather, that are
beyond their control. Others said they would consider refunds on a
case-by-case basis.</LD>
<LD>   The luxury German line Peter Deilmann Cruises, which has doubled
its riverboat fleet in the last five years, canceled the Aug. 17 and
24 sailings of its 106-passenger Dresden, which makes weeklong
sailings on the Elbe between Dresden and Hamburg, Germany. On the
Danube, the Aug. 17 sailing of the 200-passenger Danube Princess was
canceled, but the 204-passenger Mozart embarked on its Aug. 18
cruise; both ships make weeklong round-trip sailings from Passau,
Germany.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based Uniworld altered itineraries on the Danube but
did not cancel any cruises, said spokeswoman Denise Seomin. The
affected vessels included the 142-passenger Amadeus II, which sails
between Budapest, Hungary, and Prague, Czech Republic, and the
138-passenger River Empress, scheduled between Amsterdam and
Budapest.</TE>
<TE>   The flooding was another blow to the European river cruise
industry, which had been growing rapidly until the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're waiting for the locusts to show up," said Elliot Gillies,
spokesman for Germany's KD River Cruises of Europe, which was
offering a two-for-one sale even before the floods began. Cruises of
its Fontane and Schumann on its sister Viking line, which each carry
about 120 passengers and ply the Elbe between Prague and Magdeburg,
Germany, were expected to be postponed at least until Sept. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Among the flood-affected hotels was the Hilton Prague, expected to
be closed until mid-September. Many tourist attractions in popular
ports, such as Prague and Dresden, remained closed last week.</TE>

<HD>Caution Urged After Virus Outbreaks on Alaska Ships</HD>

<LD>ANCHORAGE--State and federal epidemiologists are urging cruise
companies to aggressively disinfect vessels after viral outbreaks
sickened hundreds of cruise passengers this summer in Alaska.</LD>
<LD>   Among passengers and crew affected by outbreaks, authorities said,
were more than 250 on the Ocean Princess in June, more than 170 on
the Ryndam in late July and 18 on the Wilderness Discoverer, a small
ship owned by Glacier Bay Cruiseline.</LD>
<LD>   In most cases, the cause has been identified as the Norwalk virus,
typically spread through fecal matter or vomit, epidemiologists said.
Symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.</LD>
<TE>   Cruise ships plying Alaska waters report clusters of illness
almost every year, said Dr. Beth Funk, a state epidemiologist. In
1998 the CDC recommended that anyone 65 or older or those who are ill
check with their doctor before embarking on a cruise.</TE>

<HD>Seeds of Change Inside Sequoia National Park</HD>
<DH>Far from wildfires, campers find a new museum and other
giant improvements</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN BLACKBURN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Ranger Kris Fister knelt beside a baby sequoia that had sprouted
along Big Trees Trail, near a new museum here. "Look at this little
one," she said. "With luck, this will grow to be another giant."</LD>
<LD>   Considering that a sequoia can shoot 300 feet high and weigh 14
1/2 tons, Fister's 6-inch seedling seemed far from giant size. Then
again, given how much this part of Sequoia National Park has grown
up, nothing would surprise me.</LD>
<LD>   I saw some dramatic changes last month on a camping trip with my
daughter, Courtney, 11. I had visited Sequoia in years past, but as
we pulled into the Giant Forest, I felt a bit lost. So little looked
familiar.</LD>
<TE>   The old store, fast-food center, gas station, lodge and cabins
were gone. In their place were new outdoor exhibits and the Giant
Forest Museum, which opened in December. The only thing I recognized
was the grand old Sentinel Tree, standing at attention. And with its
surroundings changed, even that looked different.</TE>
<TE>   The park service has spent more than $75 million to transform the
Giant Forest into mostly a day-use area. The 102-room Wuksachi Lodge
opened in 1999, but nearly 300 other buildings were cleared out, and
car and foot traffic was rerouted--all to protect these trees and
their intricate root systems.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer visitors have been coming to the park and experiencing these
improvements, partly because of the misperception that wildfires are
ravaging the area. A blaze that started July 21 did threaten ancient
trees in Sequoia National Forest to the south, but it never moved
into Sequoia National Park or neighboring Kings Canyon. Rangers said
the two national parks have been unaffected; though light smoke from
the fire is visible, it's so distant that the scent is undetectable.</TE>
<TE>   Which is all the more reason to go now or to plan a visit for
September or October, when the park's usual summertime haze begins to
clear anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney and I started out on a Friday, leaving Los Angeles for
the four-hour drive north on Highways 99 and 198 to Three Rivers,
just outside Sequoia's entrance. At the Gateway Restaurant, we
snagged a table overlooking the Kaweah River. Lunch--a hamburger for
Courtney, a club sandwich for me--was as good as the view.</TE>
<TE>   Winding 198, the Generals Highway, led to the Foothills Visitor
Center and then toward the heart of the park. We detoured seven miles
to Crystal Cave. With tour tickets, bought at the visitor center, we
reached the entrance and discovered why the park recommends warm
clothing. Although the temperature was in the 80s outside, it plunged
to 48 inside the cave.</TE>
<TE>   Guide Tim Morgan led our group to lighted rooms where we marveled
at stalagmites, stalactites, domes and other fascinating forms shaped
by mineral deposits over hundreds of years.</TE>
<TE>   Of course sequoias, not caves, are the main attraction. The trees
can live far longer than 2,000 years, and though not the oldest
living things on Earth, they are the largest. The park's General
Sherman Tree is the biggest by volume, an estimated 52,508 cubic
feet. It weights an estimated 2.7 million pounds, the equivalent of
about 10 blue whales.</TE>
<TE>   Convincing an 11-year-old to spend part of her weekend in a museum
dedicated to trees wasn't easy. But by the time we reached the Giant
Forest Museum and met Fister, the ranger, I realized Courtney
wouldn't want to leave.</TE>
<TE>   The structure was built in 1928 under the eye of Gilbert Stanley
Underwood, the architect behind the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite, then
altered repeatedly, from hotel office to market to fast-food
restaurant. Its latest renovation focused on restoring Underwood's
original vision: exposed frame, heavy timber throughout, river-rock
fireplace.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibits are just as naturally appealing, including
interactive ones that recount the extraordinary life cycle of the
giant sequoia. We learned how the park restoration team carefully
burned low-lying brush to spur sequoia growth in areas previously
covered by buildings or asphalt. The trunks of adult sequoias are
resistant to flames, so fire was used to provide the bare,
nutrient-rich soil that seeds need to germinate.</TE>
<TE>   A short walk from the museum is Big Trees Trail. Benches made from
sequoias have been added for the foot-weary, and 13 markers highlight
the history and plants of Round Meadow. During our visit, the field
was awash in cow parsnips (eaten by bears, actually), and farther
into the forest we came across eye-catching red snow plants (though
there's no snow).</TE>
<TE>   Lodgepole and Dorst Creek are the two main campgrounds by the
Giant Forest. Lodgepole, along the Kaweah River, is more centrally
located and has a nearby store, visitor center, deli and showers.
During the summer it's often booked. That's why our home for the
weekend was Dorst, 7 1/2 miles down the road. Though reservations are
required for some campsites, others are first come, first served.</TE>
<TE>   Our only complaints: In places the campsites are too close
together and the ground is too uneven to pitch a tent. We made do
with the kindness of campground strangers, who invited us to use a
flat part of their site.</TE>
<TE>   What Dorst lacks in design, it makes up for in excitement. "No
campground in the western region of the National Park Service has
more bear activity than we do," a ranger said. "Right now we have 11
active bears here."</TE>
<TE>   Courtney dug out salad from the bear-proof storage bins while I
whipped together Tuna Helper. After dinner, we spotted four young
mule deer near Dorst Creek that paid little attention to us. They
came so close that we could almost touch their velvety antlers. Back
by our tent, our energy waned with the flickering flames of the
campfire, and it wasn't long before we tucked ourselves in for the
night.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime around midnight, there arose such a clatter that we
sprang from our sleeping bags. In the moonlight we saw the commotion:
one large bear.</TE>
<TE>   Some campers banged pots and pans. Others yelled. The bear seemed
largely unimpressed, strolling from campsite to campsite. Soon it was
gone, and we fell back to sleep surprisingly quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning we set off for Crescent Meadow in hopes of seeing
a bear in the daylight. No such luck. So we packed up peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches, granola bars and trail mix, then tackled the
path to Tokopah Falls.</TE>
<TE>   The relatively easy route climbs along the Marble Fork of the
Kaweah and after less than two miles reaches the 100-foot-high falls.
Rocks near the base provide a spot to picnic in the company of gray
squirrels and fat golden marmots.</TE>
<TE>   Back at camp, I cooked pasta for dinner. Courtney did some summer
schoolwork and read. We fell into such a comfort zone that even when
a bear caused another late-night clamor, we shrugged it off as just
part of the Sequoia experience.</TE>
<TE>   Our last morning we hiked the trail between Crescent and
Huckleberry meadows. Around one bend a mule deer buck stood on a
small promontory. Nearby we spotted a mother bear and cub climbing a
tree--too far away for great photos but still fun to watch.</TE>
<TE>   On the way out, we bridged the gap between the park's wild wonders
and the civilization that lay back home with lunch at Wuksachi Lodge.
Courtney had a large club sandwich; I devoured a delicious citrus
salmon filet on a bun. And we drove away, giant sequoias receding
from view, the winding road guiding us home.</TE>

<LD>The golden years lost a little of their luster this summer when
several airlines ended discount programs for seniors. But that's no
reason to tear up your AARP card. There are plenty of deals, in the
air and on the ground, for older travelers.</LD>
<LD>   A new online guide, www.seniordiscount.com, has expanded from
25,000 listings of travel and other deals to more than 115,000 since
its launch last year, says David Smidt, the president and chief
executive.</LD>
<LD>   Joan Rattner Heilman, author of an annual guide to senior
discounts, is seeing no reduction in deals as she works on the 2003
edition of "Unbelievably Good Deals &amp; Great Adventures That You
Absolutely Can't Get Unless You're Over 50," due out next spring
(Contemporary Books; $14.95 for 2002 edition).</LD>
<TE>   In fact, "hotels are trying even more eagerly" to court the older
set as occupancy rates have sagged, she says. Since 1988 her book has
grown to 311 pages from 220, and its list of hotel chains offering
senior discounts has nearly tripled.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't seen any ... tailing off in offers," says Tom Ottwell,
spokesman for AARP, which affords travel and other discounts for its
slightly more than 35 million members, all 50 or older. (For a list
of offers, visit www.aarp.org.)</TE>
<TE>   The airline industry is an exception.</TE>
<TE>   In the last couple of months, several major airlines stopped
selling discount coupons to seniors. Typically, such books contained
four coupons, each good for one-way travel in the U.S. (and sometimes
Canada and Mexico) that had to be completed within a year of
purchase. Prices varied but usually hovered around $150 or $175 per
coupon--a good deal for some but not all flights, depending on fares
in a particular market.</TE>
<TE>   Some majors also ended 10% across-the-board discounts for seniors,
usually replacing them with more restricted fares and raising the age
of eligibility from 62 to 65.</TE>
<TE>   Cash-strapped airlines say the changes save them money and spare
them and customers the inconvenience of handling paper coupons. They
also note that leisure fares have dropped so low, especially on the
Internet, that coupons aren't the deal they once were.</TE>
<TE>   Others question the moves.</TE>
<TE>   "The wisdom of trying to eliminate [senior] discounts ... escapes
me completely," says Peter C. Yesawich, president of the Orlando,
Fla.-based marketing firm Yesawich, Pepperdine &amp; Brown. Seniors
represent a huge market that is "remarkably price-and
value-sensitive," given that incomes typically drop by 60% to 70%
after retirement, he says. He suspects discounts may return when the
airline business improves.</TE>
<TE>   In an informal online sampling by www.seniordiscount.com that had
drawn over 1,000 replies as of last week, more than 40% of
respondents said they would switch to other airlines to counter the
cutbacks, and nearly as many said they would look for discounted
Internet fares.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some airlines that still had senior deals as of the
Travel section's deadline Tuesday. Some apply the discount to a
traveling companion too; check with the airline for details. An
important caveat: The senior deal may not be the lowest fare you can
get. "Don't just ask for the senior fare," says David Castelveter, a
spokesman for US Airways. "Ask for the lowest fare on the market."
And be sure to check the airline's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   * America West: A 10% discount off most fares is available for
passengers 62 or older; not available on Internet-only fares,
although you can reserve online. A "Senior Saver Pack" with four
flight coupons costs $596, or $149 per one-way trip.</TE>
<TE>   * American, Continental and Northwest offer a senior fare,
requiring a 14-day advance purchase, that takes about 10% off the
lowest available fare in that category. You must be 65 or older. At
Northwest, the senior fare allows stays up to 180 days versus 30 days
for a regular leisure fare. (Last month Continental ended its
well-regarded Freedom Flight Club, with discounts of up to 20% for
seniors 62 and older.)</TE>
<TE>   * Southwest: Discounts vary from 20% to 67% off regular full
fares; in any case, the senior fare won't be more than $129 each way,
a spokeswoman says. You must be 65 or older. The senior discount can
be combined with other discounts. It does not apply to traveling
companions younger than 65, and it is not available on the Web; you
must call Southwest's toll-free number, (800) 435-9792.</TE>
<TE>   * United: Senior fare, requiring 14-day advance purchase, takes
about 10% off the lowest available fare in that category. You must be
65 or older. There's also a Silver Wings Plus club, starting at $75
for a two-year membership, for ages 55 and older with discounts on
air fares, car rentals, cruises and hotels; details at
www.silverwingsplus.com.</TE>
<TE>   As for major hotel chains, years ago they offered senior discounts
up to 25%; now they're typically 10%, author Heilman says. But a few
are more generous. The same caveat applies here as for airlines: Be
sure to ask for the lowest available rate, which may not be the
senior rate. Discounts may not be available when the hotel is heavily
booked, such as Christmas week.</TE>
<TE>   Among the chain-hotel deals:</TE>
<TE>   * Days Inn: You can better its usual discount of 10% (for seniors
60 or older or for members of "any senior citizen organization") by
joining the free September Days Club, which offers 15% to 50% off
standard rates for those 50 and older. (800) 241-5050,
www.daysinn.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Hyatt: Seniors save up to 50% at "participating" Hyatt hotels,
says the Internet site www.hyatt.com. (Translation: Senior discounts
may not be available at all hotels, a common caveat.) You must be at
least 62. When I checked rates on the Web site last week for a
September stay at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco,
the "Senior Citizen Guestroom" rate was $139 per night, beating the
$189 "Special Rate Guestroom" and the $149 "AAA Promo Rate
Guestroom."</TE>
<TE>   * Marriott: AARP members save 10% off the regular room rate or the
Marriott corporate rate, whichever is less. But members can save
more, at least half off regular rates, subject to availability, if
they book 21 days in advance. An important note: The 21-day rate is
nonrefundable. An added bonus for AARP members is 20% off food and
nonalcoholic beverages for up to eight people at hotel restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   * Radisson Hotels &amp; Resorts: The "Senior Breaks" program offers
25% to 40% off standard rates. You must be 50 or older in the U.S.
and Canada to qualify; 65 or older in Europe and Australia. Many
hotel restaurants also give discounts in off-peak dining hours.</TE>
<TE>   When traveling, don't forget to ask about senior or AARP rates for
movie tickets, car rentals, ski-lift tickets, park entrances and even
retail stores. The list is nearly endless and, experts say, not
likely to dwindle soon.</TE>

<DL>ISLE OF MAN</DL>
<LD>At the airport in Birmingham, England, the officer looked at our
German and U.S. passports and asked what our destination was.</LD>
<LD>   "Isle of Man," I answered.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, do you have family there?" she asked.</LD>
<TE>   "No, we're just going for vacation," my husband, Rolf, said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's rather odd, isn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   We must have looked confused, because she added: "Well, foreigners
just never go there unless they have family."</TE>
<TE>   It seems she was right. Only two U.S. addresses had been entered
in the guest book at our B&amp;B since 1989--and both belonged to Rolf.</TE>
<TE>   I had never been to England, and here I was passing up London, the
Lake District, Shakespeare's birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon and
Stonehenge in favor of an island few Americans are familiar with. But
Rolf loves this little jewel that's just 33 miles long and 13 miles
wide, and when life gets tough, he sometimes thinks about packing it
all up and moving here.</TE>
<TE>   It is easy to see why it would make an ideal escape from the real
world. From the window of the prop plane, I looked down on an emerald
green island with mountains, wooded glens, waterfalls, dramatic sea
cliffs and empty beaches. Cumulus clouds created shady splotches
across a patchwork of sheep-dotted pastures neatly separated by
hedgerows. Even the farm animals seemed to have sea views.</TE>
<TE>   The Isle of Man is in the center of the British Isles but is not
technically part of Britain. Its 76,000 residents constitute a
self-governing dependent territory of the Crown, with its own
currency (though it equals British pounds), parliament and culture.</TE>
<TE>   "We want nothing to do with the British," said Madeleine Heath,
owner of the Ashfield Guest House, our B&amp;B in the capital of Douglas.
"That is, until the British have a bank holiday, and then it's 'All
hail to the Queen!' and we take the day off."</TE>
<TE>   The Manx, as residents are called, are proud of their Celtic
heritage. Signs are in Gaelic and English, and the old tongue is
taught as a secondary language in the schools. Nearly every house
sports the Manx flag with the Three Legs of Man, first used
officially in the early 14th century on the Manx Sword of State. The
armor-clad legs, which were originally a symbol for the sun, run in a
clockwise direction. The motto, in Latin, says, "Whichever way you
throw it, it will stand."</TE>
<TE>   Rolf, our son Kai, 2, and I visited the island for four days in
July to break up a two-week visit with family in Germany. Most
tourists come between May and October. The island is right in the
Gulf Stream and even has palm trees, so while England had showers, we
had warm, albeit breezy, sunshine.</TE>
<TE>   The island is easily traveled by train and bus, but not with a
baby and his heavy paraphernalia. So the first order of business was
to rent a car, retool our brains to drive on the left side of the
road and find the Ashfield Guest House, just a couple of blocks from
the beach. The owners remembered Rolf because he had announced one
morning at breakfast that he intended someday to buy the Calf of Man,
an uninhabited islet nearby. It's not for sale. The Manx National
Trust keeps it as a bird sanctuary for cormorants, puffins, kittiwake
gulls and the crow-like chough, among others, but people can take a
half-hour boat ride to the islet and walk around.</TE>
<TE>   Our innkeeper, Heath, welcomed Kai, set up a crib in a third-floor
room with a bay view and directed us to the nearest grocery store for
toddler provisions.</TE>
<TE>   We pushed Kai in his stroller along the 1 1/2-mile-long Douglas
Promenade to breathe the sea air on the way to the market. Built in
the late 1800s, the promenade's hotel facades, antique street lights
and horse-pulled street trolleys make it easy to imagine people out
for their daily constitutional, women holding parasols and men with
their walking sticks.</TE>
<TE>   We made it into the store just before closing and asked where the
nappies (diapers) were. The cashier pointed and then said: "Oh, your
American accents! If I weren't already sitting down, I'd be weak in
the knees from laughter."</TE>
<TE>   We were an anomaly, I suppose, but I wondered why. Granted, the
air fare from London can be expensive, especially for a family, and
there is no Big Ben or Buckingham Palace. But we found the Isle of
Man to be a miniature of England, except more manageable for visitors
trying to see everything in a single trip. It has medieval castles
and ruins, ancient Celtic stones, Viking gravesites, Victorian steam
trains still in operation, scenic paths, friendly people and--sorry
to have to add this--bland English cuisine.</TE>
<TE>   Our first taste of the food was at a highly recommended restaurant
on the promenade called Min y Don. We wanted traditional English
cooking, so we ordered roast beef with Yorkshire pudding. The meal
came with boiled potatoes, mashed peas, boiled cabbage and carrots.
No matter how much salt and pepper we added, we could not elicit
flavor from the food.</TE>
<TE>   But back to the positive. The island is peaceful and
quiet--perhaps a bit too quiet to seem real. The most heinous deed in
the local newspaper's crime blotter: "A knicker thief has made off
with an assortment of ladies underwear. The burglary happened
overnight on Thursday at Top Drawer Ladies Wear Shop, Victoria
Arcade, Douglas." Another day, the only crime listed was a bicycle
theft. (The bike was found in the next town.)</TE>
<TE>   Feeling safe and mellow after only one day, we started our
sightseeing with Peel Castle, a must-see because of its fascinating
history and beautiful location on tiny St. Patrick's Island,
connected by a bridge to the Isle of Man's west coast. With audio
sets in hand and sun overhead, we climbed from ruin to ruin learning
about the castle's 1,000-year history, starting with Magnus Barefoot,
who probably erected a timber peel, or fortress, soon after his
arrival in 1089. We climbed around the foundations of several
churches, a 14th century round tower, fortress walls built to keep
out the Scottish in the 1500s and a medieval bowling alley, all
overlooking the sea.</TE>
<TE>   We nearly had the grounds to ourselves, except for schoolchildren
who were identifying the flora growing in cracked castle walls and
wildflowers scattered over burial sites. Lucky kids.</TE>
<TE>   After another tasteless lunch (scallops in an unseasoned tomato
sauce, white rice, salad with no dressing) at the Creek Inn
overlooking the boats anchored in the town of Peel, we drove to the
southern part of the Isle of Man to visit Cregneash Village Folk
Museum, a 19th century village restored to show how the
crofters--farmers and fishermen--lived. Visitors can see thatched
cottages, neat gardens and weaving and blacksmithing demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   The next day we climbed aboard the Snaefell Mountain Railway,
which travels to the summit of Snaefell (Norse for "snow mountain"),
the island's highest peak at 2,036 feet. On a clear day you
supposedly can see Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales. But how
often do the British Isles get clear days? At the top, clouds
shrouded the view, and icy gusts had us running from the train to the
depot gift shop and cafe, where a children's play area kept Kai happy
and all of us warm and fed with more local fare: sandwiches made of a
thin layer of pressed turkey on thin-sliced white bread with
mayonnaise.</TE>
<TE>   At least we had fun riding the narrow-gauge electric train, which
has been running up and down these hills since 1895. It passes Laxey
Wheel, billed as the world's largest water wheel, built in 1854 for
mining lead and zinc.</TE>
<TE>   Our next driving stop was Castletown, the capital of the island
until 1869. Its main attraction is Castle Rushen, built at the end of
the 12th century and home to lords and monarchs of England until
around 1800, when it became a prison.</TE>
<TE>   The castle satisfies those who want to see an authentic
storybook-style castle with turrets, a drawbridge, a dank dungeon,
candle-lighted banquet halls and wax statues of the historical
figures who lived there. Climbing the narrow, dark, twisting
staircases isn't easy with a small child. We had to keep a close eye
on Kai to guard him from darting off and falling through the cannon
openings in the turret walls.</TE>
<TE>   In the castle's museum, we read the original lists of 19th century
prisoners. Crimes included thievery, drunkenness and failure to pay
taxes. On the prisoners' menu: 8 ounces of bread daily except on
Sunday, when they got 8 ounces of gruel. Women got 6 ounces.</TE>
<TE>   Reading the menu made us hungry. But the island's restaurants are
rarely open between lunch (generally 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.) and dinner
(6 to 9:30 p.m.). Stay too long reading placards at museums, and you
pass up your chance for food. That happened to us twice and caused
the most frustration.</TE>
<TE>   On the way home from the castle, we stopped to feed and pet some
of the 50 horses at the Home of Rest for Old Horses, a 92-acre farm a
few miles south of Douglas. I've never seen such healthy-looking
horses, senior citizens or not.</TE>
<TE>   The Isle of Man is also home of the tailless Manx cat, and down
the road in Santon is the Manx Cat Sanctuary. Like the horse home,
this haven for homeless felines and a few other farm animals is open
daily for free. (Rolf isn't too fond of cats, so we didn't stop.)</TE>
<TE>   On our last day we headed for the beach at Port Erin to play in
the powder-soft sand and eat homemade Manx ice cream, the tastiest
treat on the island. Popular water sports here include sailing,
windsurfing and scuba, but the latter requires a dry suit; even a
wetsuit doesn't protect divers from the cold water.</TE>
<TE>   Before reaching the airport in the late afternoon, we drove over
some hills to see the roads used for two weeks in May for the annual
TT (Tourist Trophy) Races. More than 12,000 motorcycle riders from
across the world and thousands more fans descend on a 37 3/4-mile
course racing through quiet villages and over mountain roads. At
times a motorcycle rider would overtake our car at such lightning
speed that he and his bike were a blur. It was hard to imagine
thousands of them screaming through the pastoral setting.</TE>
<TE>   We left the island already planning a return trip. We hadn't
gotten to shop for sweaters made from the wool of the four-horned,
indigenous Loghtan sheep. We stopped only briefly to see the 5th
century Celtic crosses excavated from a farm in Andreas. And we
missed the Cashtal Yn Ard, Stonehenge-like megaliths from a
2,000-year-old Neolithic site in Glen Mona.</TE>
<TE>   Next time Kai might be old enough to walk the footpaths throughout
the island, each beckoning with a new view to admire or a historic
tale to tell.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding "Cruise Control: On Some Lines, Tips Are Automatic" (Travel
Insider, Aug. 18): As a cruise aficionado who spends six to eight
weeks on the seas every year, I am insulted by cruise lines that
imply that their passengers need counseling on how much to tip. I
resent being forced to tip staff that do not do an adequate job. Only
employees who do an extraordinary job should get a tip. Those who do
an ordinary job should learn to live on their salaries, no matter how
meager. If their wages are insufficient, they should change careers.</LD>
<LD>   I salute Royal Caribbean International for respecting the
intelligence of their customers enough to give them the freedom to
tip or not and for offering the added service of "automatic tipping"
to customers who request this feature on board.</LD>

<LD>Regarding "Getting a Bead on Anxiety and Greek Culture," Aug. 11: I
saw worry beads for the first time when I was a young man and spent a
couple of weeks on Corfu, Greece. I was in a cafe, and a man sitting
at a table by himself was rattling them in his hand. I figured he had
bought them as a bracelet for his girlfriend, and because she was
late in arriving, he was annoyed. It's funny how we can interpret or
misinterpret other cultures.</LD>

<LD>As a not-quite-sixtyish woman who has stayed in "youth" hostels from
San Francisco to Istanbul, I add my applause to Arthur Frommer's
recommendations ("Hostels Serve Young, Young at Heart," On a Budget,
Aug. 11). Hostels provide inexpensive lodging and unique
opportunities to expand cultural horizons.</LD>
<LD>   The hostel at Ft. Mason in San Francisco has a kitchen, where my
new hostel friends and I prepared an Italian meal. Not only was it
delicious, but it also allowed me to introduce my international
dining companions to a San Francisco delicacy: sourdough bread.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A long overdue but sincere thank-you to Amanda Jones for her article
"In Chile, Desert Adventures Deluxe" (June 9). In early June, my
partner and I were arguing about where to vacation. I wanted a
traditional see-the-sights excursion, and he wanted a traditional
lie-at-the-beach trip. I stumbled on Jones' story, and we decided to
go to Explora's Patagonia resort in southern Chile.</LD>
<LD>   Explora provided a wonderful way to discover Patagonia. We
recommend going in summer: The weather was temperate, and we had
Torres del Paine National Park almost to ourselves. By the end of our
stay, we were the only two guests at the resort. The sights were
spectacular, but what was more astonishing were the grand silences,
broken only by the sound of distant avalanches.</LD>
<LD>   We are planning to go to Atacama next year, thanks to Jones, who
satisfied our desires by introducing us to Explora and, more
important, to Chile.</LD>

<HD>Nevada's Big Empty</HD>
<DH>When it's not serving as a backdrop for the Burning Man
Festival, Black Rock Desert is an easily accessible wilderness of
vast vistas, natural hot springs, wild horses, bighorn sheep--and
very few people</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC RORER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BLACK ROCK DESERT, Nev.</DL>
<LD>Two trucks were coming toward us, just plumes of dust at first,
billowing out of the pancake flatness that stretched miles in all
directions. They rose through the shimmer of the desert--first the
roofs, then the windshields, then the entire vehicles. The pickups
rippled in the waves of convection, trails of dust swirling behind
them into an infinite yawn of blue sky, and their wheels didn't seem
to touch the ground.</LD>
<LD>   As I stared at those trucks floating in space, I realized why this
empty corner of northwest Nevada is home to the Burning Man Festival,
the ever-evolving fete that draws tens of thousands of artists,
nudists and run-of-the-mill partyers every year around Labor Day to
share works of art, to dance, to perform, to become, in effect, a
living, breathing art installation. Reality takes on different
dimensions on this vast, dry lake bed known as the Black Rock Desert,
two hours north of Reno. It's hard to imagine a better backdrop for
artistic and social experimentation.</LD>
<LD>   But for our group of seven men and five women, the backdrop was
the main attraction. In May, Burning Man was still months away (it
begins Monday this year) as we stood in the sunny brilliance of the
morning. Because of the high elevation, temperatures are usually mild
in the spring and fall, hot in summer and downright cold in winter.</LD>
<TE>   At any time other than Burning Man week, this is one of America's
most remote but easily accessible wildernesses, an outdoor playground
of endless vistas, natural hot springs, wild horses, bighorn sheep
and, despite all the attention Burning Man has brought to the area,
very few people.</TE>
<TE>   Desert Survivors, a low-profile, nonprofit Bay Area-based hiking
and conservation group, organized our trek. Its trips, publicized
only through the group's newsletter and Web site, are informal.
Trekkers bring their own gear and food, and they provide their own
transportation to and from the trail head. The price is right: Trips
cost $10. They're open to anybody in good physical condition, and
they don't require anything more than basic camping and backpacking
skills. The trip leaders have an impressive depth of knowledge about
the California and Nevada deserts. As with this trip, they take
people to places that are off the travel radar.</TE>
<TE>   Our destination was the northwest edge of the 30-by-10-mile lake
bed, at the foot of a rolling stretch of mountains called the Black
Rock Range, where we were to embark on a three-day backpacking trip.
The best way to get to the trail head is to drive straight across the
lake bed, or playa, as it's called. We had stopped in the middle,
just to experience what it's like to stand in the center of this
large, unbroken plain.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mirage effect," said Bob Ellis, the 61-year-old leader of
our trip, referring to the floating trucks that were coming toward
us, then vanishing into their own dust as they passed. "At long
distances, the bottoms of things get lost in the curvature of the
light, so they look like they're suspended in space."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks partly to the efforts of desert activists such as Ellis and
to the attention Burning Man has brought to the area, the Black Rock
Desert and much of the surrounding countryside was given protected
status in 2000 as the 760,000-acre Black Rock Desert-High Rock Canyon
Emigrant Trails National Conservation Area. Its name is a bit
misleading. Black rocks are uncommon in this landscape. The name
comes from a single rock formation on the west side of the lake bed
that 19th century explorers used as a navigation landmark.</TE>
<TE>   The lake bed is the heart of the conservation area. Its massive
size and almost perfect smoothness made it ideal for the
counterculture artists of Burning Man who needed a place to spread
out after the festival grew too large for its San Francisco setting.
The festival moved here more than a decade ago, and it has grown so
large that each year it becomes the fourth largest city in Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   The area is also attractive to record chasers: The land speed
record was set on the Black Rock Playa in 1997, when British driver
Andy Green broke the sound barrier, hitting a top speed of more than
763 mph in a jet-propelled car.</TE>
<TE>   At the far more humdrum speed of 50 mph, our group continued on,
making a beeline across the powdery clay of the lake bed toward Big
Mountain, formerly called Paiute or Pahute Peak--at 8,618 feet, the
highest summit in the Black Rock Range.</TE>
<TE>   The members of our group came from a variety of backgrounds: a
nuclear medicine technician, a yoga instructor, a financial advisor
and people of other stripes, most in their 30s or 40s. Many were
drawn to the trip because of their passion for desert exploration and
by images they had seen of Burning Man.</TE>
<TE>   From the middle of the lake bed, it took half an hour to drive to
our trail head in Clapper Canyon, named for Edward Clapper, partner
of noted 19th century explorer Peter Lassen. Both men were killed
near the mouth of the canyon in 1859, the mystery surrounding their
slaying never solved. There was no water in the canyon or anywhere
along our three-day route, so we had to carry our own--a gallon per
person per day, about 25 pounds for each of us. That, besides food,
sleeping bags and other gear, made for heavy packs.</TE>
<TE>   The load and 80-degree temperature--typical for a spring day in
this area--meant tough going that first day. There is no trail
through the canyon, so we had to pick our way over boulders and
through brush.</TE>
<TE>   A mile into the canyon we came upon the almost perfect skeleton of
a male bighorn sheep--legs, rib cage, skull and full-curl antlers,
all intact.</TE>
<TE>   We continued up the canyon and a couple of miles farther came to a
cave formed by the erosion of soft underground soils. Nearly 100 feet
deep and 20 feet tall, it opened to the south wall of Clapper Canyon.
It was cool inside, a good place to eat lunch and get out of the sun,
intense despite the relatively mild temperatures. We lingered almost
an hour, munching on salami, cheese, nuts, dried fruit and other
backpacker staples.</TE>
<TE>   After lunch we continued climbing up the canyon. The plan was to
get far enough up the south flank of Big Mountain to put its summit
within hiking distance for the next day. As the afternoon wore on,
the wind started to pick up, gusting with increasing force until it
was blowing at 20 to 30 mph. High winds are common in this area, and
Ellis, fortunately, had planned for them. He chose a sheltered site
for camping, a miniature valley between a small knoll and the main
part of the mountain, a little more than five miles from the mouth of
Clapper Canyon. It was a wonderful, well-protected spot.</TE>
<TE>   We set up camp, then lay on the knoll and stared up at the deep
blue desert sky, pondering brilliant white clouds as they sailed by
like mammoth Rorschach blots. "Look at that one," said Nick Vasquez,
a 36-year-old nuclear medicine technician from the Bay Area. "It
looks like a ... huge lung X-ray, stretched across the sky."</TE>
<TE>   My dinner that night was a repetition of lunch. On short weekend
backpack trips like this, I rarely take a stove, forsaking hot food
for a lighter pack, but several other people in the group prepared
elaborate meals: Japanese noodles with fresh shiitake mushrooms, and
couscous with dried vegetables and fresh Parmesan cheese.</TE>
<TE>   We slept outside our tents that night. We were more than 6,000
feet above sea level, and as the stars came out, temperatures dropped
to the low 40s. I zipped my down sleeping bag all the way up, pulled
the drawstring tight around my face and fell asleep watching Ursa
Major swirl through the inky blackness of the endless sky.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis woke us early the next morning for a long hike to the top of
Big Mountain, seven miles and 2,500 vertical feet away. The elevation
meant heat would not be a problem. In fact, as we headed up the
peak's south ridge, the wind started to blow again, and it became
clear that staying warm would be the main challenge that day. The
view started to open up behind us, the full stretch of the Black Rock
playa and a seemingly endless series of mountain ranges to the south,
a spectacular vista soon matched by equally dramatic views to the
east and west.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway up the ridge we saw a herd of wild mustangs, almost 200
strong, grazing on a small plateau about a quarter-mile west. We
watched them for several minutes, until something startled
them--perhaps the scent of a mountain lion, perhaps the scent of
us--and they broke into a full gallop, charging off the plateau,
seeming to capture for a few glorious moments the vestiges of
everything that's still wild in the American West.</TE>
<TE>   After almost three hours of hiking, we reached the summit of Big
Mountain. Northwestern Nevada and northeastern California swirled
around us, a vista so incredible that we admired it for almost an
hour. But the wind was blowing harder than ever, and it was starting
to take its toll. Although the temperature was in the 50s, the wind
made it feel 20 degrees colder.</TE>
<TE>   Trekking back down the mountain, our group started to spread out,
and for a while I was hiking alone. It was a nice feeling, just me,
the wind and all those miles of open space.</TE>
<TE>   The feeling ended abruptly when I stepped a little too close to a
4-foot-long prairie rattlesnake, camouflaged in the desert scrub. I
was well out of range, but the snake struck anyway, and I jumped.
When I landed, it coiled up and hissed at me, ready to strike again.
I stood there at a safe distance, studying the intricate patterns in
its skin, the blackness of its eyes and forked tongue, marveling at
how something so dangerous could be so beautiful. I stayed almost 20
minutes, and it never budged. When I walked away, it was still
coiled, ready to strike.</TE>
<TE>   We turned in early that night, tired from the hike and the wind.
Thankfully, the walk back to the cars the next morning was easy, all
downhill with packs that weighed about half what they had on our
first day because most of our food and water were gone.</TE>
<TE>   "Hot springs, anyone?" Ellis asked as we loaded our packs into the
cars. A collective "Excuse me?" rose from the group, all of us
somewhat struck by the possibility of soaking in hot water. Besides
being achy, none of us had bathed for three days.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis led our three-vehicle convoy down from the trail head,
winding around on dirt roads until we came to a small parking lot. It
wasn't until we walked over to the row of cattails on the far end
that we could see the water, the size of a small pond and deep enough
for swimming.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of the most inviting natural hot springs I've ever
seen. Ellis quickly stripped off his clothes, allaying any
apprehensions about doing so, and slipped into the 90-degree water.
The rest of us followed his lead, and there we all were, a dozen
strangers, naked in our own oasis, dragonflies buzzing around our
heads, some people swimming, some just floating on their backs,
staring up at the swirl of clear sky above. We soaked for almost an
hour, and when we finally climbed back into the desert sun, I don't
think any of us had ever felt cleaner.</TE>
<TE>   Later, as we drove back across the playa on our return home, I
asked Ellis about the first time he came to the Black Rock Desert.
"It was 1991," he said. "I'd never been on a playa before. I just
couldn't believe it. Something is triggered when I get on a big open
spot like this. I generally try to express it as a release. I feel
things getting pulled out of me in all directions. Whatever it
is--the urban pressures of living in a city, or just the stress of
daily life--you get out here and you feel those things getting pulled
out of you.</TE>
<TE>   "The space is different. The size of things is different. We don't
get to see that anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   I thought about that as we drove along the dry lake bed,
eventually coming upon the site of the Burning Man Festival, the
place where a small city capable of housing 20,000 people would be
constructed and dismantled. It would be a huge endeavor, spectacular
enough to draw people from the far corners of the country, even the
world. As we drove by, I turned and looked back at the playa, all
that emptiness, the mile upon mile of flatness, with the Black Rock
Range silhouetted on the horizon. I thought about the feeling of
being out there alone, as we had experienced it, and what it would be
like to be there with thousands of people. I wondered whether any of
those festival-goers would know what they were missing.</TE>

<TE>   Guidebook: Being in Black Rock</TE>
<TE>   Getting there: Nonstop service to Reno is available on American
and Southwest airlines, and connecting service (change of planes) is
offered on United and America West. Restricted round-trip fares begin
at $123.</TE>
<TE>   If you're driving, take Highway 395 north to Reno. From Reno, take
Interstate 80 east about 30 miles. Take the Wadsworth/Pyramid Lake
Exit 43 to Highway 447. Go a mile to Wadsworth and turn left, staying
on Highway 447 north. Go 75 miles to Empire, where gas and supplies
are available, then continue three miles through Gerlach, and keep an
eye out for entrances to Black Rock playa.</TE>
<TE>   Where to stay: The best way to experience the Black Rock
Desert-High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails National Conservation Area is
to camp. You can do so throughout the area, in established sites or
in sites of your own choosing. Permits are not required. But
remember, the area is very remote, so you need to take your own
supplies, especially food and water. There are no paved roads off the
playa. Cell phones will not work. Also be careful about plunging into
the hot springs; some can get close to boiling.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Henning Krebs of Northridge was driving through the
Middle Rhine region of western Germany last year when he came across
this rape field in bloom, perfect for a photo. One problem: an
unsightly tree stump marred an otherwise unbroken field of yellow
blooms. Krebs says he wondered why the farmer didn't remove the stump
from the field. He started to pan his camera when "I noticed that the
stump had turned into a young buck," Krebs says.  He zoomed in as
much as the camera allowed and captured his best shot.</CP>

<LD>Explore the far corners of the world, traveling by private jet with a
team of National Geographic experts to such exotic destinations as
Easter Island, the Serengeti Plain of Tanzania and Rarotonga in the
Cook Islands.</LD>
<LD>   The only downside is the price: $39,950 per person, double
occupancy.</LD>
<LD>   The Wonders of the World expedition, from Jan. 28 to Feb. 19,
links some of the planet's most interesting destinations. A maximum
of 88 passengers--traveling on a specially outfitted Boeing 757--will
circle the globe, beginning and ending in Washington, D.C.</LD>
<TE>   Stops are scheduled at Hayman Island in Australia's Great Barrier
Reef; the massive temple complex at Angkor in the Cambodian jungle;
and Cuzco and the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu in the Peruvian
Andes. The group will also visit the Galapagos Islands; Marrakech,
Morocco; and Katmandu, Nepal.</TE>
<TE>   What kind of traveler pays nearly $40,000 for a three-week tour?
Marketing director Anne Crawford, who has made the trip, said the
passengers are as interesting as the itinerary. "They're well
traveled and extremely knowledgeable about the regions we visit.
They're also very enthusiastic." Most are older than 50 and wealthy,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Expedition members stay at hotels and resorts along the route.
"Some places we stop have wonderful hotels. But in some regions there
isn't much," Crawford said.</TE>
<TE>   Included: accommodations, transportation, excursions and meals
aboard the private jet. Not included is round-trip air fare from LAX
to Washington, D.C. The single supplement is $4,990.</TE>

<LD>The end of summer does not mean the end of youth tourism services in
Ireland. Backpacker tours and transportation services are ready to
roll on through the fall and winter.</LD>
<LD>   From the modern music of the clubs to the traditional tunes in the
pubs, Ireland is known for its night life, and two Barnacles
independent hostels in Dublin and Galway can put youthful travelers
in the center of the action. The hostels, in the center of each
city's entertainment district, are open 24 hours year-round and cater
to backpackers, students, writers, artists and families. They have
modern kitchens for guests' use, currency exchange services, common
rooms with open fires and luggage storage.</LD>
<LD>   The Barnacles Temple Bar House, built in 1997, has balconies that
overlook the twisted cobblestone streets of Temple Bar, Dublin's
trendy district known for its shops, galleries, pubs, clubs and
interesting eateries. It's less than a five-minute walk to Grafton
Street, a pedestrian walkway and the city's main shopping area.</LD>
<TE>   A few minutes farther is Trinity College, where the library has on
display one of the oldest books in the world: the Book of Kells, a
Gospel written and elaborately illustrated around 800. The hostel is
also within easy reach of the city's other key sites: Christchurch
Cathedral, Dublin Castle, the Dublin Writers Museum (which celebrates
the works of George Bernard Shaw, William Butler Yeats, Samuel
Beckett, James Joyce, Jonathan Swift and Oscar Wilde) and the
National Museum of Ireland (where you can see Viking and Celtic
artifacts). Finish your sightseeing with a tour and a sample at the
Guinness Brewery.</TE>
<TE>   Rates range from $26 per person in a dormitory room to $58 for a
single room. Barnacles Temple Bar House, 19 Temple Lane, Dublin;
011-353-1671-6277, www.barnacles.ie/templebar/accommodation.htm.</TE>
<TE>   Galway, a university town known for its medieval heritage, is
considered Ireland's liveliest city after Dublin. The Barnacles Quay
Street House, in a renovated medieval townhouse, is opposite the
popular Quays Pub in the city center, an area known for restaurants,
clubs and pubs, and a 10-minute walk from trains. The hostel is at 10
Quay St.; 011-353-91-568-644,
www.barnacles.ie/quaystreet/accommodation.htm. A bed in a double or
single room costs $39 per night; a dorm bed is $24.</TE>
<TE>   For details on all Barnacles Hostels, log on to www.barnacles.ie.
For details on other hostels in Ireland, contact An Oige, the Irish
Youth Hostel Assn., 011-353-1830-4555, www.irelandyha.org, or
Independent Holiday Hostels, 011-353-1836-4700,
www.hostels-ireland.com.</TE>
<TE>   Touring Ireland's small villages, historic ruins and wilderness
areas is easy in the low season because many companies catering to
backpackers operate year-round. Their services are geared to
travelers ages 18 to 35 but are available to all.</TE>
<TE>   The Shamrocker is part of the Radical Travel Network,
011-44-131-557-9393, www.radicaltravel.com, which also runs
backpacker tours in Britain. The company offers three-, four-and
six-day tours in 35-seat buses with Irish guides. Departures depend
on demand. Guests are dropped off at hostels at night, but
accommodations are not included in the tour price. (Upgraded
accommodations can also be arranged.)</TE>
<TE>   This fall the six-day Southern Rocker tour is scheduled to depart
Dublin weekly and costs about $204. The guided tour stops at Galway,
the Cliffs of Moher, Killarney, Dingle, Cork, Cashel, Glendalough,
the Hill of Tara and the Blarney Stone. For details contact the
Shamrocker at 011-353-1672-7651, www.shamrockertours.com.</TE>
<TE>   Tir na nOg Tours has six-day tours departing about once a week,
and three-day tours about three times per week. Groups range from 15
to 22 people. Departing from Dublin, Irish driver-guides take you off
the beaten track and give commentary on myths and legends, historical
events and current affairs. All tours include transportation,
accommodations in hostels, light breakfasts and site entrance fees.</TE>
<TE>   The six-day southern tour departs Dublin on Mondays, costs $267
and covers the highlights from the Blarney Stone to the Cliffs of
Moher and from Dingle Peninsula to Galway Bay. Accommodation in
Dublin is not included but can be arranged if needed. Upgrades to
twin rooms are possible for an extra charge.</TE>
<TE>   For details, contact Tir na nOg Tours at 011-3531-836-4684,
www.tirnanogtours.com.</TE>
<TE>   Stray Travel Network also operates backpacker tours in England,
Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The Ireland programs range from one to
six days. Unlike Tir na nOg Tours, Stray allows you to set your own
pace and break up your trip along its route. Most passes allow you to
take up to four months to complete your trip. The company uses
28-passenger buses, which stop at popular tourist sites and hostels,
where beds are reserved for about $16 per night. The "All Ireland"
route takes a minimum of six days to travel and costs $235. It
departs each Tuesday and Sunday.</TE>

<LD>What's a macho stock car driver doing with Drakkar Noir cologne as a
sponsor?</LD>
<LD>   When Jack Wiswall, president of L'Oreal USA was looking to
rejuvenate the Drakkar brand, he said, "People told us, if you want
the 18-35 demographics, you have to have Dale Jr."</LD>
<LD>   So Dale Earnhardt Jr. is showing up these days at perfume counters
wearing a black T-shirt and jeans, causing stampedes.</LD>
<TE>   "He's been fantastic," Wiswall said after a chorus of screams
greeted the Winston Cup driver at the Herald Square Macy's in
Manhattan as he worked his way through a police escort and a squad of
bodyguards. "He's a special kid, very gentle. He speaks well, he
looks the part. He's cool."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: The last time the Boston Red Sox won a World Series
was 1918. Who were their winning pitchers?</TE>
<TE>   The way it's done: Curt Schilling has won 21 games and has walked
only 20 batters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's command," the Arizona Diamondback pitcher explained.
"Control is the ability to throw strikes. In the big leagues,
everybody has control. Command is the ability to throw quality
strikes. And when you add preparation to command, good things will
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Schilling has a compact disc on which he records of every pitch he
has thrown to a major league batter. He even keeps track of each
umpire's strike zone.</TE>
<TE>   Opening day: Since 1978, of the 330 NFL teams that won their
opening games, 176 went to the playoffs and 95 won division titles.
Of the 330 losers, 76 went to the playoffs and 42 won division
titles.</TE>
<TE>   That was Chick: Times reader Gordon Grigg saw Chick Hearn and his
wife Marge standing in line at the post office on White Oak Avenue in
Encino a few months ago. When the person in charge learned that the
Hearns were there, he came out and offered to move them to the front
of the line. Hearn said no, thanks, that they'd just wait in line
like everybody else.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) plans to introduce a bill to
have that post office named after Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   Working tradition: Ron Adamson is quarterback of Mount Union,
winner of the last two Division III national titles. Besides throwing
passes and running the offense, Adamson washes the team's uniforms.
It's a tradition at the Alliance (Ohio) school, which offers no
athletic scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Ballard, quarterback of the 1993 Purple Raiders, started
washing uniforms. Every starting quarterback since has performed the
task.</TE>
<TE>   "They all want the job now," said Ballard, now quarterback of the
Indiana Firebirds in the Arena Football League.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Babe Ruth and Carl Mays. Ruth beat the Chicago
Cubs, 1-0, in the first game and 3-2 in the fourth. Mays won the
third and fifth games.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Nebraska's cheerleaders have been grounded. No more
acrobatics and tumbling across the end zone. A new policy prohibits
off-the-ground stunts to reduce injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big disappointment," said Kellie Bowman, co-captain of the
Cornhuskers' Spirit Squad. "Cheerleading has been more than just
standing there, waving pompoms."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Nebraska agreed to a $2.1-million settlement with a
former cheerleader paralyzed in a 1996 accident.</TE>

<HD>Karzai Lays Down Framework to Facilitate Flow of Private
Capital Into Afghanistan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>President Hamid Karzai signed a long-awaited investment law Saturday
that may finally unclog the flow of much-needed private capital into
this war-ravaged nation.</LD>
<LD>   The law takes effect immediately and calls for the establishment
of a federal commission to assist foreign and domestic investors,
award permits and licenses, and channel money into areas where it is
needed most, presidential spokesman Said Fazel Akbar said.</LD>
<LD>   Economists and government officials maintain that private funds
are just as essential as foreign aid to finance Afghanistan's
reconstruction and get this country, one of the world's poorest and
most chaotic, back on its feet. More than 20 years of warfare have
left its economy and basic services shattered.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of investors, including many naturalized Afghan
Americans, have come to pitch business projects to local authorities
since an uneasy peace settled over the country late last year. Those
proposals include tourism, telecommunications and major real estate
projects.</TE>
<TE>   But the absence of a legal framework governing investor and
property rights has made many potential investors wary of committing
to multimillion-dollar deals, according to some who asked not to be
named. As a result, very little private money has been committed, and
few projects have been started.</TE>
<TE>   A draft of the investment law had been completed for some time.
But as recently as 10 days ago, federal officials were saying they
would need several more weeks to finish further revisions in a joint
effort with a German team of governance advisors. The government
reportedly decided to get the law on the books now rather than risk
losing projects put forth by increasingly impatient investors.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai's signature could also signal Afghanistan's desire to
demonstrate that it is making progress in the reconstruction effort.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in the Karzai administration have expressed
disappointment that some nations have failed to live up to pledges
made in Tokyo in January to provide $1.8 billion in aid for
Afghanistan this year. To date, only $660 million has been handed
over.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, much of the aid that has been delivered has been
diverted from reconstruction into relief efforts as the country
struggles to cope with a flood of returning refugees. That influx is
expected to total 2 million people this year, two-thirds more than
relief agencies expected.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Peter Hoekstra (R-Mich.), heading an 11-member U.S.
legislative delegation that stopped here in the capital Saturday,
hailed the investment law as an important step in the Karzai
government's efforts to bolster security and economic development.</TE>
<TE>   To those impatient with the pace of Afghan reconstruction,
Hoekstra said: "In America, we are sitting on the shoulders of
generations of Americans. Here, they're starting from scratch."</TE>

<HD>Azerbaijan Vote Stokes Opposition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BAKU, Azerbaijan</DL>
<LD>Azerbaijanis voted Saturday in a referendum on constitutional reforms
that the government says are needed to improve ties with the West but
that the opposition warns will be a blow to democracy in the former
Soviet republic.</LD>
<LD>   A preliminary count indicated that more than 88% of Azerbaijan's
4.4 million voters cast ballots, according to election officials. No
results were released.</LD>
<LD>   Opposition groups boycotted the vote, saying the proposed changes
appear designed to enable President Heydar A. Aliyev, 79, to transfer
power to his son Ilhan, an ex-playboy who is first vice president of
the state oil company.</LD>
<TE>   Aliyev, a former Communist Party boss who has ruled Azerbaijan
with an iron fist for much of the last decade, says the changes are
needed to bring the country's constitution in line with the European
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Freedoms as it
pursues closer ties with the West.</TE>
<TE>   Election officials said they received no reports of irregularities
from accredited observers, but the opposition reported widespread
tampering.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no point voting. Everything has been decided without us
taking part," said Eldar Gulieyev, 46, a member of one of
Azerbaijan's many opposition parties.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed reforms include allowing the president to be elected
by a simple majority, rather than a two-thirds vote, and eliminating
the "party list" system, in which voters cast ballots for parties in
addition to individual candidates. Opposition leaders want to keep
the list system, saying it is crucial for developing political
parties.</TE>
<TE>   Another proposed change would make the prime minister--a
presidential appointee--the No. 2 official. Currently the parliament
speaker, chosen by legislators, is second in line to the presidency.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ecuador's highest court issued a jail order for ex-Finance Minister
Carlos Julio Emanuel, who is accused of mismanaging state funds in a
corruption scandal that has rocked the Andean nation.</LD>
<LD>   Emanuel, who quit in June after the president fired several staff
members for allegedly running a bribery ring, is at the heart of a
broad scandal that erupted amid talks for a $240-million
International Monetary Fund loan accord.</LD>
<LD>   The jail order--requested by prosecutors to keep Emanuel from
fleeing--comes two days after the state auditor reported that the
ex-minister had doled out $108 million to local governments in 2002
while charging it to the 2001 budget.</LD>

to a southern island to help rescue four Jehovah's Witnesses abducted
last week by Muslim extremists.</LD>
<LD>   The deployment of about 70 members of the Light Reaction Company
is part of a larger military buildup on Jolo island aimed at wiping
out the Abu Sayyaf group, notorious for beheadings and kidnappings.</LD>
<LD>   Commander Lt. Gen. Ernesto Carolina said the unit, equipped with
night-vision goggles, two-way radios and bulletproof vests not
available to regular troops, will provide the "killer punch" against
the kidnappers if local officials fail to negotiate the hostages'

<LD>A nest of three endangered black storks has delayed the filling of a
Portuguese reservoir that will be the biggest in Europe, local media
reported.</LD>
<LD>   Filling of the Alqueva dam on the Guadiana River is expected to be
delayed five weeks until the storks are old enough to migrate to
winter nesting grounds in Africa, Lusa news agency and Expresso
newspaper said.</LD>
<LD>   The dam project has drawn fire from environmentalists who say it
will destroy the habitats of wildlife, including eagles and some of
the few remaining Iberian lynxes.</LD>

<HD>Pakistanis See FBI in Shadows</HD>
<DH>Asia: Counter-terrorism agents from the U.S. work alongside
local security forces that have long been accused of human rights
abuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON and JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>On the front lines of a shadow war against terror in Pakistan, FBI
agents are working undercover with local security forces who have a
long history of human rights abuses.</LD>
<LD>   The joint effort is cloaked in secrecy. The U.S. and Pakistani
governments won't officially discuss exactly how many FBI agents are
working in Pakistan, citing security concerns and the political
fallout that President Pervez Musharraf could face.</LD>
<LD>   Some Pakistani officials say privately that the number of FBI
counter-terrorism specialists in Pakistan is in the low hundreds. An
FBI official, speaking in Washington on the condition of anonymity,
confirmed that "between several dozen and a hundred" FBI agents are
in Pakistan at any one time, working closely with local and federal
police and intelligence officials.</LD>
<TE>   Some human rights experts contend that any FBI agents or other
Americans involved in the initial arrests share criminal
responsibility if the detainees are tortured or mistreated later.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan, according to the FBI official and other U.S. law
enforcement authorities, has become one of the most important--and
active--beachheads in the bureau's anti-terrorism effort. But it is
also among the most sensitive given the country's strong undercurrent
of Islamic extremism and anti-Americanism.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's precise activities are unclear. Officially, about a
dozen agents are providing "technical assistance," including sharing
information on terrorist groups and training Pakistani police to
track down and apprehend Islamic militants. Other agents are working
with Pakistani police in old-fashioned "search and arrest" dragnets.</TE>
<TE>   There have been some high-profile successes in the cooperative
effort, including the capture of a top Al Qaeda leader, Abu Zubeida,
and some of his lieutenants in March at a fortified safe house in
Faisalabad, and the identification of suspected "dirty bomber" Jose
Padilla.</TE>
<TE>   But there is mounting suspicion in Pakistan that U.S.
investigators, believed to be from the FBI or CIA, are involved in
the pursuit and arrest of people who have then disappeared, or
quietly been deported, as Musharraf's government tries to control
Islamic extremists.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, relatives of terrorist suspects have described
groups consisting of two to four foreigners participating in
Pakistani police raids, usually as silent observers who closely
monitor searches.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials, as well as a senior Pakistani military officer
involved in the anti-terrorism effort, confirmed that agents have
gone on many such raids dressed in local garb so as to not attract
attention. Those agents, said one FBI official, are acting in an
advisory capacity only.</TE>
<TE>   None of the detainees' relatives or lawyers suggested that U.S.
officials were directly involved in harming anyone, but they said
they do fear that Pakistani police are torturing the prisoners once
they are out of sight.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is a signatory to a 1984 treaty that bans participation
or complicity in the torture of prisoners or other forms of
mistreatment. The prohibition became U.S. law, said Kenneth Roth,
executive director of the New York-based Human Rights Watch.</TE>
<TE>   "If they are actively participating in the arrest and
incommunicado detention of a suspect, anyone involved in law
enforcement knows those circumstances are an invitation to torture,"
Roth, a former federal prosecutor, said from New York.</TE>
<TE>   "So they would have to demonstrate considerable naivete to think
these people were going to be put up in a five-star hotel," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some U.S. constitutional scholars and legal experts said that even
with the treaty, it would be nearly impossible to hold the United
States liable for the actions of its partners in the war on
terrorism, including the torture of a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   To do so, a plaintiff would essentially have to prove that the
torture was done at the direction of the United States, or with the
direct participation of U.S. officials, said Jonathan Turley, a
professor of constitutional law at George Washington University.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just make the case that the U.S. failed to intervene,"
Turley said. "It would require a very high level of proof.... It is a
very high threshold."</TE>
<TE>   In Pakistan, arrests without warrants, disappearing prisoners and
mysterious deaths in detention are chillingly common, human rights
reports by the U.S. government and private groups have shown.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the reports have shown a pattern of police abuses,
including torture, the rape of female prisoners and illegal
detentions to pressure the families of wanted suspects.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI official said the bureau and Justice Department are
acutely aware of the potential pitfalls of pairing up with local
police in countries such as Pakistan, where the accepted standards of
police behavior are lower than in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Many such countries, U.S. officials said, engage in torture of
suspects and other human rights abuses. How to conduct overseas
investigations in alliances with such governments is an ongoing
problem in the growing assault on terrorism, they said.</TE>
<TE>   These operations go beyond Pakistan, and beyond the FBI, which has
made the transition from a primarily domestic law enforcement agency
to one focused on gathering intelligence. The United States has
deployed CIA agents, State Department officials, military
intelligence operatives and others in covert capacities to go after
terrorism cells the world over.</TE>
<TE>   But Pakistan is considered critical because potentially hundreds
of Al Qaeda and Taliban members are thought to have found a haven
there after the U.S. military strikes in neighboring Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you do [otherwise]?" one FBI official said. "Not do an
investigation?</TE>
<TE>   "We go where our leads take us," the official said. "If there is a
presence in another country, we will work with the law enforcement
and intelligence services in those countries. But because a
particular intelligence service has been accused of abuses does not
mean you can walk away from investigating matters in that country."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and Justice Department officials would not comment on a
U.S. role in any particular raids. But witnesses to the arrest of
Atta ur Rehman, suspected leader of the radical Islamic group
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, connected to the kidnapping and murder of American
journalist Daniel Pearl, suspect that there were indeed U.S. agents
present.</TE>
<TE>   The June 16 police raid on the home of Rehman's family went down
just before the first call to prayer, when everyone was still asleep
in a shanty house targeted as a terrorist's lair.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani Rangers, whose officers use the assault rifles, armored
vehicles and heavy machine guns of a military force, kicked open the
flimsy front door. Then dozens stormed into the house waving assault
rifles and shouting for people to put their hands up, witnesses said.
Rehman's sister Kulsum Bano hurried into another room to hide her
face.</TE>
<TE>   By the strictures of purdah, the ancient tenet of orthodox Islam
that guides a woman's modesty, she could not be seen by any male
outside her family, let alone angry police who rousted her from bed.</TE>
<TE>   In another room, the police found the man they wanted: Rehman.
Police know him better by an alias, Naeem Bukhari, and say he
commands the notorious Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.</TE>
<TE>   Rehman had given them the slip two years earlier, but authorities
began searching for him in earnest after he and his militants were
accused of kidnapping and murdering Pearl and bombing the U.S.
Consulate here.</TE>
<TE>   Rehman was living in his family's home when the police came to get
him just two days after a suicide car bomber attacked the consulate,
killing 12 Pakistanis. FBI agents joined the investigation
immediately after the blast.</TE>
<TE>   Watching from the shadows while police searched her home, Bano
noticed four foreign men in plainclothes among the uniformed federal
Rangers. They didn't say a word but moved from room to room, closely
watching the search of cabinets, drawers and other areas, she
recalled recently.</TE>
<TE>   Because the foreigners never spoke, Bano said she has no idea who
they were.</TE>
<TE>   About half an hour after storming into the house, police dragged
Rehman by the hair and collar, and shoved him into a white car at
gunpoint.</TE>
<TE>   That's the last his family has seen of him. A provincial judge
ordered local police to produce Rehman in court. They insist that
they don't have him, and never did.</TE>
<TE>   "We fear that they will torture him to death because they are not
acknowledging his arrest and are not disclosing his whereabouts," his
sister said.</TE>
<TE>   The day after the raid, Bano's lawyer went to the provincial High
Court to file a habeas corpus application, which demanded that police
either charge Rehman or set him free.</TE>
<TE>   In the application, she accused police of taking her brother
without an arrest warrant, illegally detaining and torturing him, and
demanding a bribe of about $5,000 for his release.</TE>
<TE>   She named four officers from the Sindh provincial force's criminal
investigation division: Deputy Supt. Zulfiqar Junejo, Inspector
Sajjad Haider, Supt. Farooq Awan and Officer Fayyaz, whose first name
was not given.</TE>
<TE>   Anwar Alam Subhani, the force's law officer, denied in a July 31
affidavit that Sindh police had arrested Rehman.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavit also denied local newspaper reports, quoting unnamed
police officials, that said police seized a massive
arsenal--including four truckloads of ammunition, plastic explosives,
242 Kalashnikov assault rifles, 136 rocket launchers and 2,700 hand
grenades--when they arrested Rehman. Bano claims that police left her
house with only her brother and a roll of film, which she says were
wedding pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Three days earlier, police raided the Karachi home of another
suspected Lashkar-e-Jhangvi member, Mohammed Faisal Bhatti, around
4:15 a.m. In an affidavit, his mother, Shahzada Begum, accused three
of the police officers named in Rehman's case of kidnapping her son.
Three foreigners in plainclothes were with about 25 Pakistani police
in the family's apartment for about 10 minutes, Begum said.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking off the record, police have told Pakistani reporters for
several different publications that they have Rehman and at least two
other suspects in Pearl's murder locked up.</TE>
<TE>   They say they don't want to charge the men, or publicly
acknowledge that the suspects are in custody, because they would
undermine evidence that convicted the accused mastermind of Pearl's
murder, Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, and three accomplices last month.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani police investigators have also suggested privately that
they believe Rehman ordered that Pearl be killed. One Karachi police
source claimed that Rehman brought in three Yemenis to carry out the
murder and the dismemberment of Pearl's corpse.</TE>
<TE>   A Pakistani police officer who participated in a separate raid on
the Karachi hotel room of a U.S. citizen said four FBI agents, one of
them a woman, joined in the June 1 operation after Pakistani police
failed to persuade a desk clerk to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   Acting on information from U.S. officials, the police went to the
Metropole Hotel and asked the desk clerk to let them into the room of
an American identified as John Turner, said the source, who spoke on
condition he not be named to protect his job.</TE>
<TE>   Turner, the source added, was a documentary filmmaker traveling on
a U.S. passport, issued at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. It
contained valid visas to enter Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The desk clerk only let the police go up to his room after FBI
agents arrived and insisted that he let them in, the source said. The
FBI agents interrogated Turner for about two hours, and he told them
that he had been in Afghanistan working on a documentary in ethnic
Pushtun areas where the ousted Taliban regime is still popular.</TE>
<TE>   During the questioning, the police source added, Turner was
critical of U.S. policies in Afghanistan and what he called
Washington's support for Israel against the Palestinians. Both are
popular views in Pakistan, and Turner hadn't broken any local laws,
but the source said he was deported anyway.</TE>
<TE>   In a personal court action challenging the FBI's role, Karachi
lawyer Suhail Hameed went to court Aug. 2 to demand that Musharraf's
government show under what, if any, legal authority U.S. agents are
working in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Judges Zahid Kurban Alavi and Ghulam Rabbani dismissed the
petition. They said it was inadequately drafted because, for example,
it failed to include specific allegations of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer told the judge that he had kept it vague for fear of
being branded an Al Qaeda supporter but said he may return to court
seeking answers on FBI activities.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic extremists have already declared war on the FBI in
hundreds of leaflets distributed in Pakistan's North-West Frontier
Province and the South Waziristan tribal area, along the border with
Afghanistan, as recently as early this month. The leaflets name 120
people accused of spying for the FBI and say Al Qaeda members will
receive $100,000 for each one killed.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicion that FBI agents are aiding Pakistani police who
routinely break the law only feeds seething anger among a small but
very dangerous minority of Pakistani radicals, warned Khawaja Naveed
Ahmed, a Karachi lawyer who recently proved in court that police had
secretly detained four of his clients for more than two weeks in a
police station.</TE>
<TE>   "America is the flag-bearer of human rights all over the world,"
the lawyer said. "In our country, 70% of the people are silent. Only
people who are either political or victims are vocal. They naturally
are saying this is not a good practice. It's making new enemies."</TE>

<HD>Afghans Probe Inmate Deaths</HD>
<DH>Asia: A team heads to the site of reported mass graves near
a prison for Talibs who surrendered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>A team sent by President Hamid Karzai is in northern Afghanistan to
investigate the reported deaths of hundreds of Taliban prisoners
after the fall of the hard-line regime last year.</LD>
<LD>   Led by Mawlavi Hanif Balkhi, an advisor to Karzai, the team flew
to the city of Mazar-i-Sharif on Friday and was to travel east to
Dasht-i-Leili outside the town of Sheberghan, where the prisoners
were reportedly buried last year.</LD>
<LD>   Balkhi told reporters he would also discuss security problems in
the north with leaders of various factions, including Gen. Abdul
Rashid Dostum, an Uzbek warlord; Dostum's ethnic Tajik rival, Ustad
Atta; and leaders of the Hezb-i-Wahdat faction.</LD>
<TE>   "And about the mass graves, we will investigate and then report to
the central government," Balkhi said.</TE>
<TE>   The dispatch of the team by Karzai comes just days after the
United States threw its support behind calls for the Afghan
government to investigate the deaths of hundreds of Taliban fighters
who surrendered to the U.S.-allied Northern Alliance last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Newsweek magazine reported that as many as 1,000 prisoners died in
shipping containers after surrendering to Dostum's forces.</TE>
<TE>   Sayed Noorullah, a deputy to Dostum, said Thursday that about 200
Talibs died while being transported in the containers, although most
were badly wounded and weak from fighting. "There is no reason that
deaths happened deliberately," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The European Union's special envoy for Afghanistan said Friday
that anyone guilty of war crimes in the north of the country after
the fall of the Taliban must be brought to justice, regardless of the
political repercussions. Francesc Vendrell said he had raised the
issue with Dostum and stressed the importance of accountability.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not the first time there has been this kind of massacre. We
must put a stop to it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dostum, a deputy defense minister and Karzai's special envoy for
the northern region, has pledged to cooperate with the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations exhumed three bodies from a gravesite at
Dasht-i-Leili for autopsy, which showed that the cause of death was
probably suffocation.</TE>

<HD>Italy Intercepts Iraqi Kurds Off Coast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Italy's coast guard caught a boat carrying 202 Iraqi Kurds trying to
come ashore Saturday, capping a heavy week of illegal landings that
prompted prosecutors to accuse Italian fishermen of helping illegal
migrants.</LD>
<LD>   Several coast guard vessels accompanied the 60-foot white wooden
boat into the port of Santa Maria di Leuca, about 45 miles south of
Lecce, on the heel of boot-shaped Italy.</LD>
<LD>   On board were 202 Iraqi Kurds, including one woman and her
newborn, who were both taken to a hospital for a routine check, a
port official said. The others were taken to a holding center and
were expected to be sent home unless any qualified for political
asylum, the official said. Italian news reports said the boat
originated in Turkey.</LD>
<TE>   The landing was the latest in an unusually busy spell of illegal
arrivals, most of them in Sicily and its nearby islands. Last
weekend, more than 450 migrants arrived on the tiny island of
Lampedusa.</TE>
<TE>   A Sicilian prosecutor put five members of a fishing crew under
investigation after they said they responded to a distress call from
a boat carrying 151 immigrants off Ragusa, in southern Sicily,
Italian news reports said.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor is investigating whether crew members aided and
abetted illegal immigration, because they entered international
waters, picked up the migrants and brought them to Sicily rather than
nearby Malta. The fishermen say Maltese authorities didn't respond to

<HD>Israelis Tighten Belts, Keep Stiff Upper Lips</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Despite a crippled economy and high unemployment,
the public supports keeping up defense spending as budget wars loom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Jacob Alal, 47 and unemployed, sits in a cafe in Jerusalem nursing an
orange juice. Eighteen months ago, shortly after the start of the
Palestinian intifada, he lost his marketing job as the economy headed
south and hasn't been able to find anything since.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli makes regular trips to the government unemployment
office, but, in what he says are a sign of the times, the only
positions available are for security guards. The prospect of spending
his day intercepting would-be suicide bombers in front of stores or
restaurants isn't terribly appealing.</LD>
<LD>   Once a proud member of the middle class, Alal sees himself, his
family and many around him slipping dangerously backward. "Everyone
around me is in debt, and I'm living in poverty," he said. "I'm
reduced at my age to getting help from my parents. And no one in the
government seems to have any new ideas on how to fix the economy."</LD>
<TE>   For Israelis, the debilitating injuries and loss of lives have
taken a huge toll as the intifada heads into its third year. Less
obvious, but widespread, are the economic costs for a society
increasingly fearful and feeling under siege.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Not as Bad as It Looks--It's Worse," read a front-page
headline for a story on joblessness in Israel's Haaretz newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Despite mounting worries, however, even Israelis pushed to the
brink of economic desperation haven't spoken out.</TE>
<TE>   "It's seen as unpatriotic to criticize government spending
priorities these days," said Eli Shoval, a 45-year-old who lost his
film industry job after security-conscious Israelis stopped going to
theaters. "I'd demonstrate, but everyone's afraid of getting together
in large groups. And who knows if the police would bring out water
cannons? People are just worn down."</TE>
<TE>   The economy has been dealt a triple blow, because the violence has
coincided with a global downturn and high-tech meltdown. Industries
such as tourism and construction are weathering some of the worst
days in memory.</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, nagging security fears are scaring away foreign and
domestic investors, overseas business partners, sports teams, even
arts groups, adding to the country's sense of isolation.</TE>
<TE>   "Many attorneys have to fly to Cyprus now just to have a meeting,"
said Carmit Bar-On, a lawyer with Yehuda Raveh &amp; Co. "It's drastic."</TE>
<TE>   The numbers fill out the economic picture. Per capita gross
domestic product, a measure of economic growth, shrank 3.2% last year
and is slated to contract 3% more this year, unprecedented slippage
in the nation's history. Unemployment rests stubbornly above 10%,
exports are down 11.7%, the fiscal deficit is widening, and annual
inflation is pegged at about 8%. "We've paid a high cost in blood and
in our pocketbooks," Alal said.</TE>
<TE>   But in a classic case of rallying round the flag, Israelis voice
greater support for personal sacrifice than they did a year ago, even
as their personal fortunes have deteriorated, according to a poll
released last month by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Tel
Aviv. The survey found that 47% were willing to shoulder higher taxes
for defense spending, up 10 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves defense spending nearly sacred in looming budget
battles, a position it has enjoyed for most of Israel's relatively
short history.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we're in a severe economic crisis by all accounts,
ultimately the military will get what they want," said Stewart Cohen,
policy studies professor at Tel Aviv's Bar Ilan University. "There's
always a lot of moaning and groaning along the way, but they'll get
it."</TE>
<TE>   For most Israelis, there's little guns-versus-butter debate,
experts say, at least publicly. Rather, it tends to be a
butter-versus-butter showdown, as domestic constituencies and
pro-welfare lawmakers squabble over what's left of the pie.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Ariel Sharon wants the remaining slice to be as
small as possible--with the exception of funding for settlements. The
former general threatened this month to call early elections unless
lawmakers agree to across-the-board cuts affecting unemployment
insurance, medical care, education and other social welfare programs.</TE>
<TE>   It's a high-stakes game, however. "Sharon knows he's vulnerable on
the economy," said Joseph Alpher, a political analyst. "His
popularity is dropping"--by 15 percentage points in the last two
months, according to a newspaper poll.</TE>
<TE>   One doesn't have to go far to see why people are worried.</TE>
<TE>   On Jerusalem's Jaffa Street, Sbarro continues to dish out pizzas
and spaghetti a year after a high-profile suicide bombing killed 16,
including the bomber, and wounded 140. But a growing number of nearby
cafes and shops are out of business as people increasingly shun the
downtown area. As the economic pain has intensified, landlords are
reducing rents or, in a few cases, waiving them altogether until
tenants can get back on their feet.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be optimistic to continue," said Judith Hervitz,
owner of Pupi Gifts, a small knickknack shop on Hillel Street off
Jaffa that has seen business drop 40%. "We have no employees, and our
rent was cut nearly in half, so we're better off than some. But
people just aren't out shopping. They're just too afraid."</TE>
<TE>   Israel could benefit from at least a small tail wind next year if
the global economy picks up, analysts say. But few expect the
high-tech market to recover any time soon, while the
Israeli-Palestinian security situation is anyone's guess.</TE>
<TE>   A modest silver lining on the economic front, said Augusto
Lopez-Claros, a London-based senior economist with Lehman Bros., is
that vulnerable Israeli industries such as tourism and construction
have probably seen the worst of it.</TE>
<TE>   "They may not recover soon," he said, "but they won't collapse
further, either."</TE>
<TE>   That's small consolation to many on the front lines, however.
Furthermore, even if the fighting and violence were to end tomorrow,
it would take about nine months before investors edged back in,
bringing jobs and new ventures, economists say.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Gafni, an independent contractor, demolitions expert and
reserve paratrooper, says he doesn't remember things being this bad
for this long during his 53 years of living in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   His business has fallen off by 70%, and fellow contractors who
once built entire condominiums now hustle for small jobs to feed
their families. Palestinian workers can't enter Israel given the
travel restrictions, wiping out 80% of the industry's work force. And
West Bank quarries aren't able to deliver stone because their trucks
can't make it through checkpoints; nor would the Israeli army let
quarry workers use dynamite anyway to dislodge the rock.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Gafni believes that it's a price ultimately well worth
paying. "Israel could some day be a Garden of Eden," he said. "With
all the dangers and hazards, you still get up in the morning and feel
if you weren't here you'd be missing something."</TE>

<HD>A Battle of Wills at the Lake</HD>
<DH>China: With the Dongting exceeding danger levels and more
rain forecast, officials have vowed to defend the banks with their
lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DONGTING LAKE, China</DL>
<LD>It kept raining and raining.</LD>
<LD>   Then the water crept into the house and climbed up their thighs.</LD>
<LD>   "We didn't have time to take anything," said Wan Yunyong, 46, a
resident who fled the shores of China's second-largest freshwater
lake last week. "Everything we owned washed into the big river."</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of thousands of people have been driven from their homes
here in southern China's Hunan province in a summer of floods that
has claimed nearly 1,000 lives across the country and left more than
a million people homeless. Another million soldiers and volunteers
have rushed to their aid, shoring up dikes as flood waters continued
to rise to near-record levels.</TE>
<TE>   After a few days of clear skies, more rain could strike the area
today, dangerously coinciding with the cresting of flood waters
charging down the Yangtze River into Dongting Lake.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year it floods, and every year we run," said Wan's husband,
Li Yueping, as he stood Saturday in a condemned warehouse where his
family and about 200 other neighbors had sought shelter. "We are
tired of running."</TE>
<TE>   "But we could be pushed out again this weekend," his wife fretted.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, flooding is a way of life in this part of China.
The 1,400-square-mile Dongting Lake not only links up with the mighty
Yangtze but acts as a giant buffer against its chronic overflows.</TE>
<TE>   However, the lake's flood control capacity has been compromised
over the years by intense human settlement, the buildup of sediment
and poor dike maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   The controversial Three Gorges Dam, under construction now, was
designed to alleviate this ritual of disaster across the Chinese
heartland. But it won't be completed for at least seven years.</TE>
<TE>   About 37 floods have been recorded in this area in the last half a
century or so. The worst hit in 1998, when banks along both the
Yangtze and the Dongting burst. More than 4,000 people died as a
result.</TE>
<TE>   So far, authorities do not expect the same level of catastrophe
this year. But with the Dongting having reached 6 feet above danger
level, millions of people are potentially in harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials have declared a state of emergency for the entire
province and have vowed to defend the banks with their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "The danger level could persist for at least another 10 to 14
days," the provincial party chief told a local newspaper. "We must
prepare for a long and difficult battle ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Already the provincial capital, Changsha, has been under attack.
It stands on the banks of one of the four rivers that rush into the
Dongting. About 3,000 people living on an island in the middle of the
city had to be evacuated when their low-lying homes sank into the
swelling river.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, caravans of soldiers darted along bumpy rural
highways, braving a punishing heat wave to troubleshoot along
Dongting Lake's nearly 600 miles of dikes. Young cadets shoveled
gravel and passed sandbags in assembly lines to hold back weak walls.
Peasants jumped into the water to plug small leaks, sometimes using
bedding and even doors.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Cross Society of China has appealed for help around the
country, and donations of money and goods to the agency and others
have totaled more than $6 million. But supplies ranging from tents to
food are running low.</TE>
<TE>   "The world paid a lot of attention to the floods in Europe, as
they should," said Yang Xusheng, a Red Cross official based in
Beijing. "It's closer to their doorstep. But I wish they would also
pay more attention to us."</TE>
<TE>   If embankments fail to hold during the crisis point today, the
city of Yueyang and its 600,000 residents could be in big trouble. It
lies where the Dongting meets the Yangtze.</TE>
<TE>   But life there hummed along as usual Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   A crowd gathered in the middle of one street, lighting
firecrackers and greeting a bride. Old people danced beneath an
elevated freeway. Families stood in line for burgers at the local
McDonald's. The landmark pagoda overlooking the swelling Dongting
received tourists even as the lower garden area lay drowned by the
rising tides.</TE>
<TE>   Away from the city center, however, some smaller communities
already were submerged. In the district of Chenglingji, low-rise
homes and storefronts had been reduced to pointy shingled roofs
adrift like lamp shades in a swimming pool. Waves lapped against the
leaves of maple trees that looked as short as potted plants.</TE>
<TE>   Boys swam freestyle in flood water the color and clarity of split
pea soup. A mother breast-fed her baby. Knots of people fished, from
rooftops, in wooden bathtubs. One man dangled a hook from the roof of
a flooded public toilet.</TE>
<TE>   Squatters in abandoned buildings said they had stuck around
because there was no place else to go.</TE>
<TE>   They had seen armies of aid workers and carloads of government
officials inspecting disaster areas. But only on television.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody told us where or when to go, and nobody came to help,"
said Zo Binshan, 48. "We just ran to the highest place we could."</TE>
<TE>   Their savior turned out to be a local eyesore that was supposed to
have been bulldozed long ago. The four-story former headquarters of
the local grain depot was halfway demolished when officials ran out
of money. Squatters had covered gaping holes left by the wrecking
ball with plastic tarp or clotheslines hung with laundry.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God this building is still here, or else we refugees
wouldn't have any place to hide," said Zo, who used to own a food
stall. Now, he said, there was nothing for him to do besides nap,
fish or play mah-jongg like the other adults in the floating ghost
town.</TE>
<TE>   Down one dark corridor of the building, a man with a large beer
belly sat with his shirtless back to the encroaching waters, calmly
repairing his fishing pole.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been through it so many times we don't get scared anymore,"
said the off-duty security guard, surnamed Li. "That's why we call
ourselves 'sparrows on the Dongting'--small but brave."</TE>

<DL>JENIN, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Israeli troops killed a Palestinian militant in a shootout Saturday
as violence continued and talks to ease Israel's military grip on the
West Bank and Gaza Strip bogged down.</LD>
<LD>   In the gun battle in the West Bank city of Jenin, a 21-year-old
member of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militant group affiliated
with Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, was killed after he and two
other militants shot at the soldiers.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, an Israeli tank fired on stone-throwers in Nablus,
injuring at least six people, witnesses said. And on the outskirts of
Nablus, Israeli troops and Palestinians clashed after a joint
Arab-Jewish peace group tried to deliver food to Palestinians living
under curfew.</LD>
<TE>   About 400 members of the group Taayush were stopped at an army
checkpoint. Military officials said the activists, all Israeli
citizens, were blocked because they had not coordinated their entry
into Palestinian areas with the army.</TE>
<TE>   The clashes underlined the fragility of a week-old deal aimed at
pulling back Israeli troops from Palestinian cities and curbing
militant attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Israel withdrew troops from the West Bank town of Bethlehem on
Tuesday under an agreement that also called for lifting restrictions
on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip in return for Palestinian security
forces neutralizing militants targeting Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   But a new round of talks failed to yield agreement on an Israeli
pullout from Hebron, one of the six West Bank cities under closure.
"Israel has frozen the agreement," Nabil abu Rudaineh, a top advisor
to Arafat, said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer told Channel 1
television: "First of all, we must deepen the effort [to halt
violence] in Gaza and Bethlehem. It is pointless to move forward ...
unless there is quiet."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian militant groups have vowed to keep up attacks. Late
Saturday, Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade members said they killed a
Palestinian woman, Ikhlas Yassin, 35, whom they suspected of
collaborating with Israel.</TE>

<HD>Abusing the Power of Suggestion in Russian Ads</HD>
<DH>Media: Subliminal messages in commercials are illegal, but
they are still popping up. A state agency is working on a system to
trace them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Deep within a Russian television advertisement for a local beer,
Klinskoye, lurked a split-second message for another thirst-quencher:
Pepsi.</LD>
<LD>   An image of Palmolive Fruit Essentials soap was there and gone in
a blink on the NTV television network. Young viewers of Russian MTV
unconsciously absorbed marketing messages for Secret deodorant, the
New Musical Express newspaper and the Red Hot Chili Peppers album,
"By the Way."</LD>
<LD>   In fact, according to Russian scientists, subliminal television
advertising, although illegal in this country, is strewn across the
airwaves.</LD>
<TE>   Russian television stations insist that they have no way of
knowing whether video material provided by advertising agencies
contains subliminal messages. Advertising firms and the companies
whose products appear in subliminal messages deny any involvement.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very many cases. I'm surprised by the quantity," said
Svetlana Nemtsova, deputy director-general of the All Russian
Research Institute for TV and Radio Broadcasting, a state agency.</TE>
<TE>   "There are channels that are impossible to watch," she said,
referring to the amount of subliminal advertising broadcast. "There
are channels that don't overdo it, and there are channels that don't
do it at all."</TE>
<TE>   She declined to list the offenders.</TE>
<TE>   But time is running out for them. Nemtsova and other Russian
scientists at the broadcast institute have developed equipment to
trace subliminal messages that will constantly monitor Russian TV
airwaves by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Nemtsova said the institute hasn't pursued TV stations for
breaches. That would be the role of the Ministry for Press,
Broadcasting and Communications after the device goes into operation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still testing this device, but we can see what outrages are
going on the air," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The broadcasting ministry issued a joint warning in June to
television stations to stop using subliminal advertising. Those
caught could be removed from the air or fined, it warned.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, ATV, a television station in the Siberian city of
Yekaterinburg, was banned from the air for two months after being
caught bombarding viewers with the subliminal message to keep on
watching it.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission warned that
subliminal advertising--not consciously perceived by the eye but
apprehended subliminally--was "contrary to the public interest."
Broadcasters can be fined or sanctioned, but advertisers are not
barred from using the messages.</TE>
<TE>   But debate has raged in the U.S. about how effective subliminal
advertising really is. Many experts have concluded that there is no
evidence it is any more compelling than ordinary advertising,
although some contest this.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, there is no routine monitoring of
advertisements for subliminal messages because they are not seen as
an issue.</TE>
<TE>   In Russia, the issue is viewed with greater alarm. Subliminal
advertising is seen here as more persuasive and potentially damaging
than it is by many in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Grant Demirchoglyan, an expert on biology at the All
Russia Institute for Physical Culture and Sport, a state agency, even
suggested that terrorists could use subliminal images to "zombify"
targets, adding that it was possible that "psychotropic" viruses
could be transmitted subliminally through computer screens to damage
the human mind.</TE>
<TE>   Demirchoglyan said that it would require repeated viewing to
compel a viewer to act but that "any evil intention can be
transmitted subliminally."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for Procter &amp; Gamble and Pepsi denied knowledge of
any cases of subliminal advertising. A spokeswoman at Colgate
Palmolive in Moscow said no one was available to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Natalya Kolmakova, a spokeswoman for Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes
Secret deodorant, said the material aired for journalists at the
broadcast institute must be "either some mistake or else some prank."</TE>
<TE>   Alexander Shalnev, spokesman for PepsiCo Holdings, raised the
possibility that Klinskoye might have inserted a hidden advertisement
of Pepsi into its own beer commercial but acknowledged that such a
scenario made no sense.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even want to comment on this because it doesn't make any
sense," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Vasilyev, director-general of the Media Services Video
International advertising company, said he knows of no cases of
subliminal advertising on Russian television and argued that the
risks outweighed the benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's proven and published, it would be a horrible scandal," he
said. "I think the damage they might incur dwarfs the extra sales
they could get."</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Khudyakov, director of the advertising sales department at
NTV Media, said it's impossible for TV stations to tell whether video
material contains hidden inserts.</TE>
<TE>   "As of today, we are powerless to do anything," he said. "We are
victims of the same hidden advertisements, just like everybody else
around here.</TE>
<TE>   "But the advertisers' logic is obvious here," he said. "Even
though this practice is considered illegal, why not use it, since
there is no way of detecting it? They know they will always get away
with it.</TE>
<TE>   "The use of hidden inserts is known to be effective. Any normal
company would do it."</TE>
<TE>   Nemtsova said that her institute built its new detection device,
known as ODSV-1, at the request of the broadcasting ministry and that
it took four years to develop.</TE>
<TE>   The device actually casts almost too wide a net. Not only does it
capture subliminal images, but also frames with poor focus or
quality, and blank frames filled with black, white or another color.</TE>
<TE>   Some images are perplexing. In a clip aired on MTV, the body of a
woman wearing a T-shirt bearing the word "porn" was superimposed with
a man's head.</TE>
<TE>   "What is that? Something incomprehensible. I don't even know what
it's supposed to be!" Nemtsova exclaimed, before showing a string of
other cryptic subliminal images in video material bearing the MTV
logo.</TE>
<TE>   Demirchoglyan, the professor from the sports institute, argued
that subliminal messages are more effective because they are absorbed
by a viewer unknowingly and that his or her will is subdued. The
normal resistance to advertisements isn't triggered, he insisted.</TE>
<TE>   "The people in advertising understand this perfectly well," said
Nemtsova, showing a computer disc for the Russian advertising
industry that extolled the virtue of ads that bypass conscious
thought. One section described how to advertise using hidden
television messages. The maker of the disc, like many CDs and videos
bought in Moscow, was anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   The subliminal advertising controversy is long-lived. In 1957,
James Vicary, who had an interest in a company called the Subliminal
Projection Co., claimed to have aired subliminal frames at a New
Jersey movie theater over a period of six weeks urging the audience
to drink Coca-Cola and eat popcorn. He claimed an 18% increase in
Coke sales and a nearly 58% increase in popcorn sales during the six
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   But later attempts to reproduce his results failed. In 1962, he
admitted that he had overstated the case: "The story leaked out to
some newspaper guys, and we were forced to come out with [the
results] before we were really ready. Worse than the timing, though,
was the fact that we hadn't done any research, except what was needed
for filing a patent."</TE>
<TE>   The most recent U.S. controversy over subliminal advertising
occurred in the 2000 presidential election, when the word RATS
appeared briefly during a Republican ad while a voice-over criticized
then-Vice President Al Gore's policy on prescription drugs. The FCC
wrote to 217 television station executives, asking them whether they
were aware that the word RATS flashed on the screen and, if so, why
they had broadcast the ads?</TE>
<TE>   When the Russian detecting device begins work at the end of the
year, the broadcasting ministry will decide which cases are breaches
of the law and which are permitted.</TE>
<TE>   Nemtsova rejects the claims of Russian television stations that
they have no way of knowing whether they are airing subliminal
advertising in tapes received from ad agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Although the state will monitor all stations constantly, Nemtsova
believes that television stations should take responsibility upon
themselves for airing untainted video material. She says each station
should install the device to check the quality of the material being
broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   "Factories that make vodka or sausage check the quality of their
products," she said. "People who show video materials should be
responsible for checking the quality too."</TE>

<HD>Saudi Surrenders in FBI Manhunt</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Photo of man's passport is on a disc that also has
pictures of several Sept. 11 hijackers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A young Saudi Arabian man whom the FBI has accused of being
"associated" with the Sept. 11 hijackers has surrendered to
authorities overseas after learning that he was the subject of an
international counter-terrorism dragnet, his father was quoted as
saying Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Saud A.S. Rasheed, 21, showed up at his family's home in the Saudi
capital, Riyadh, and then turned himself in to officials at the
Interior Ministry there, the elder man told local journalists.</LD>
<LD>   Rasheed said he wanted to clear himself of any connection to the
terrorism attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,
according to his father, Abdulaziz Saud Rasheed.</LD>
<TE>   "We have no idea who this guy is," one senior FBI official said.
"But we sure want to find out."</TE>
<TE>   In interviews with the newspapers Al Yaum and the Arab News, the
father denied that his son had any links to terrorism and said he had
never visited the U.S. or any European country.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, officials at the Justice Department and the FBI
said they were aware of the news reports but had not yet been able to
determine conclusively whether Rasheed was in custody. If he is,
federal agents and counter-terrorism prosecutors will move swiftly to
either question him themselves or monitor interviews with him
conducted by the Saudi authorities, an FBI official said.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Saudi authorities have permitted U.S. officials to
monitor interrogations of terrorism suspects but not to participate
directly in questioning.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI issued a "be on the lookout" bulletin Tuesday seeking
Rasheed's immediate arrest after evidence was recovered that
authorities said linked him to the hijackers in the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   At least one photograph of Rasheed's passport was found on a
CD-ROM that also contained photographs of at least four of the
hijackers, according to FBI officials who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The importance of the CD-ROM was not discovered until Aug.
15, when investigators at the Justice Department came across it while
processing a mountain of evidence obtained during the war on
terrorism overseas.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI bulletin, which was also sent to Interpol, the
international police agency, said Rasheed was suspected of being
"associated with the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers."</TE>
<TE>   "Law enforcement agencies are requested to stop and detain
[Rasheed] and to contact their local FBI office," the bulletin said.
"He is considered armed and dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI also placed a photograph of Rasheed on its Internet site
and circulated the photo to other agencies around the world. The
bureau said Rasheed's whereabouts were unknown.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly a week, FBI agents have been working with their
counterparts in other countries to determine who Rasheed is and why
his photograph was included on the computer disc along with those of
some of the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   One FBI official said there were no other photographs on the disc,
fueling authorities' suspicions about the smiling young man wearing a
kaffiyeh in the photo.</TE>
<TE>   As of late Friday, a search of all U.S. intelligence and law
enforcement databases had turned up no trace of Rasheed, and initial
queries directed at authorities overseas had also drawn a blank, the
FBI official said.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be a harmless explanation as to why his photo and
theirs are together, but it doesn't look good," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Rasheed has not been charged with or indicted for any crime, but
U.S. authorities said they remained highly suspicious. The passport
was issued in Riyadh in May 2000, according to U.S. officials, who
said they were investigating the possibility that the document might
have been forged.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Saudi Embassy in Washington did not return calls
seeking comment Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In the Arabic newspapers, Rasheed's father insisted that his son
was blameless.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knows that ... the information published [by the FBI] is
baseless," he told the newspapers, according to the Associated Press.
"I asked him to come back fearing he might be arrested."</TE>
<TE>   The father reportedly promised to work with Saudi authorities to
establish the innocence of his son. He said Rasheed had spent a year
in Afghanistan to "take part in charity activities" and had returned
home "four months after the September attacks."</TE>

<HD>S. Africa Tries to Sell the Struggle</HD>
<DH>Tourism: Soweto is pitched to visitors as a showpiece of
nation's apartheid past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SOWETO, South Africa</DL>
<LD>The gleaming white bus pulls up in front of a sea of colorful
galvanized-metal shacks, and about 60 tourists from Europe, the
United States and Japan tumble out of the air-conditioned vehicle.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the tourists focus their expensive digital cameras on the
ramshackle homes, clicking away as they saunter down a dusty path. A
few stop to talk to residents, whose tiny barren yards are ringed
mostly by barbed wire.</LD>
<LD>   After 20 minutes, the tourists clamber into the bus and head for
the spot where a schoolboy was fatally shot in a 1976 student
uprising--an event that helped trigger international outrage against
this nation's racist apartheid system. The last stop is a local
shebeen, or unlicensed bar, to join a few locals for some beers,
pap--maize porridge--and mutton stew.</LD>
<TE>   As Johannesburg, South Africa, plays host to an estimated 100,000
people attending the United Nations' World Summit on Sustainable
Development this week, the city hopes to capitalize on its latest
organized tourist attraction: townships and other showpieces of its
apartheid past.</TE>
<TE>   Soweto, an acronym for South Western Townships, is the metropolis
that apartheid built. Just six miles southwest of Johannesburg, it
exploded from a small nest of settlements for poor black workers to a
60-square-mile area that by some estimates is now home to 3.5 million
people.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors will be encouraged to spend the night at private Soweto
homes, soak up the night life at shebeens and discover how the
majority of urbanites here live.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the good, the bad and the ugly," Joe Motsogi, a tour
guide, bellowed recently to a group of tourists packed into his
minivan. "Contrary to popular belief, you are not going to be killed.
You are about to meet warm and welcoming people of So-weyy-toow."</TE>
<TE>   Motsogi, a former beer and insurance salesman, likes stretching
his words like a televangelist. He uses the microphone and
loudspeaker in his minivan to answer questions--even when you're
sitting next to him.</TE>
<TE>   He is also among 15 tour operators who run thriving businesses
specializing in Soweto tours, which cost about $40, including lunch
at a shebeen. Soweto has become such a popular tourist destination
that Johannesburg decided to market it, inviting tourists to visit
"The Struggle Route."</TE>
<TE>   "For decades, the world was interested in the anti-apartheid
struggle," said Tasneem Carrim, a spokeswoman for the city. "People
are coming here to see for themselves what brought the apartheid
government to its knees."</TE>
<TE>   Interest in South Africa's apartheid past has been a boon for
Johannesburg's fledgling tourist industry. Until recently, visitors
typically shunned Johannesburg, with its carjackings and other crime,
for the Kruger game reserve, South Africa's wine country or Cape Town
and other coastal resorts.</TE>
<TE>   But after apartheid was dismantled nearly a decade ago, some of
the people who in their own countries had participated in protests
against the system or had boycotted companies investing in South
Africa began coming here to look at political symbols and places that
they had only seen on television or read about in newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the houses in Soweto are not shanties. With their
red-tiled roofs and uniform architecture, many would fit well in a
suburban California neighborhood. Motsogi likes to tell his clients
that more than 50 millionaires now live in Soweto.</TE>
<TE>   "And I," he said with a chuckle, "am a millionaire in training."</TE>
<TE>   Motsogi says he and other tour operators are trying to convince
locals that bringing tourists to their neighborhood will benefit them
and their country.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell them that they are not like animals being gazed at in a
zoo," he said. "People who come here want to understand history and
culture."</TE>
<TE>   During one tour, 58-year-old Kholekile Nkuhlusi stood next to his
blue galvanized shack--which measures about 8 by 8 feet--and watched
a small group of visitors walk by.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy that they are seeing how we live and how tough our
[existence] is," said Nkuhlusi, who has been unemployed for five
years. "But they must help us with a little something."</TE>
<TE>   The so-called Struggle Route includes the recently opened
Apartheid Museum and the Hector Pieterson Memorial, named after the
first schoolboy to die in the 1976 Soweto uprising.</TE>
<TE>   At the Regina Mundi Roman Catholic Church, where anti-apartheid
activists frequently sought refuge from police, church wardens point
to bullet holes in the ceiling and the stained-glass windows.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't sign your name next to Slick Willie," a church guide warned
one recent visitor, pointing to the signature in the visitors' book
of former President Clinton, who came to the church with his wife,
Hillary, in 1998. "Unless you know you're going to be the president
of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Behind the last pew is a quilt with messages to people lost to
AIDS, which by all accounts has ravaged Soweto.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our new struggle," the guide said.</TE>
<TE>   After the 3 1/2-hour tour ends, Motsogi drives his clients back to
their comfortable hotels and homes in upscale areas including
Sandton, where the World Summit will be held.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing that in the 21st century, people still live like
that," said one visitor who had entered a resident's shack.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the real South Africa," said another visitor, Noga Oron,
who lives in a million-dollar house in Rosebank, another up-market
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Motsogi says about 25% of his clients are white South Africans who
want to see Soweto for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all learning a lot about each other," he said. "After the
trip, they see the people here are not beasts but have the same hopes
and dreams that they have."</TE>
<TE>   His trips have also furthered his own education.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a member of the club that thought every white person was an
oppressor," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Only when I started to talk to white people, and found out that
they too helped and felt the same way about apartheid, then I began
to realize.... "</TE>

<HD>Supporters of Venezuela's Chavez March Against Ruling on
Coup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of supporters of President Hugo Chavez marched
through the capital Saturday to show faith in their leader despite a
recession and renewed opposition attempts to remove him from office.</LD>
<LD>   The former army paratrooper organized the march to protest a
Supreme Court ruling absolving four military officers accused of
leading an April coup. The president's supporters believe the ruling
tried to justify a coup that ousted Chavez for two days and saw the
dissolution of the constitution and democratic institutions.</LD>
<LD>   "We cannot keep quiet! We must express our complete rejection of
the Supreme Court's decision," Chavez told the crowd, punctuating his
words by pumping his fists. He joined the 8-mile march as it ended in
a rally near Congress.</LD>
<TE>   At least 100,000 people waved Venezuelan flags and carried
portraits of Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   One marcher shouted the names of the 11 justices who voted to
absolve two army generals, a navy rear admiral and a navy vice
admiral, citing lack of evidence. The crowd cried "Out!" after each
name. Eight justices voted to indict the officers.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition leaders are seeking ways to oust Chavez before his term
ends in 2007. They complain he has fueled class tensions and ruined
the economy. Figures released last week show Venezuela's economy
contracted 7% in the first half of the year. Chavez blamed a plunge
in oil revenue and the April coup.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Ask Iraqi Exiles to Step Up</HD>
<DH>Policy: The White House plans to train individuals to speak
out against Hussein. 'The principal engine for transforming Iraq is
the Iraqi people,' one official says.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has drawn up plans to escalate the war of
words against Iraq this fall, with new campaigns to increase pressure
on Baghdad and rally world opinion behind the U.S. drive to oust
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the State Department will begin mobilizing Iraqis from
across North America, Europe and the Arab world, training them to
appear on talk shows, write op-ed pieces and give speeches on reasons
to end Hussein's rule, among other things. At least four of the
scheduled participants are from California.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to put them on the front line of winning the public
hearts and minds. It's one thing for an American to get up and talk
about regime change in Iraq. It's quite another thing when Iraqis do
it," said one State Department official, who requested anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   The program reflects the administration's increasing focus on
making Iraqis key players in the quest to change both the leadership
and the political system in Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the principal engine for transforming Iraq is the
Iraqi people, and, ultimately, we hope that they are going to be
freeing themselves of Saddam's tyranny," Douglas J. Feith,
undersecretary of Defense for policy, said in an interview aired
Friday on Radio Sawa, a new U.S.-funded, Arabic-language station.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States will perhaps be in a position to help that
along, but the future that we see for Iraq is a future that would be
based on the Iraqi people freeing themselves from the oppression that
they are suffering," Feith said.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to other Middle East groups, Iraqi exiles have not
mobilized in most communities where they have settled. That is an
issue of increasing concern in Washington, which often appears to be
going it alone without much visible support from the estimated
300,000 Iraqis in the United States or the 4 million exiles
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraqi Americans have been invisible, which is a product of
Saddam's oppression. Iraqis have feared speaking out because of the
harassment and intimidation of family and relatives back home," said
Azam Wash, a geologist from Long Beach who was invited to the Aug.
27-30 training sessions in Washington. Wash left Iraq in 1978, when
he was 20.</TE>
<TE>   After Labor Day, U.S. officials intend to be more visible
themselves in explaining U.S. objectives in Iraq in public
appearances and overseas media, State Department officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no accident that we're torquing up the language. A decision
was made this week by the Iraq public diplomacy group to do more,"
said one administration official, referring to a group that includes
senior officials from the State Department, the Pentagon and the
National Security Council. "There's a feeling that it's time to start
moving the rhetoric forward."</TE>
<TE>   Feith's interview on Radio Sawa was part of the new initiative,
U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In tough language, Feith, an administration hawk, indicated that
the United States may no longer view the United Nations weapons
inspection regime as the key to disarming Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are interested in is not inspections as such. What we're
interested in is having an Iraq that does not possess weapons of mass
destruction," he said. "Inspections were merely a means to the end,
[and] they have not been a terribly effective means to the end....
Saddam some years ago was able to undo the ground inspection regime
altogether."</TE>
<TE>   The higher profiles of U.S. officials and Iraqis reflects a
short-term strategy to lay the groundwork for longer-term goals and
perhaps accelerate the process of change.</TE>
<TE>   "The question has been, in the absence of military action, what
can we do? So ratcheting up the rhetoric is the kind of thing we can
do now. We can stir the pot and see what happens. It could push
someone over the edge to act," the administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials and Iraqis outside their homeland hope that the
strategy will reframe the public debate, which is increasingly
questioning why Washington feels an urgent need to move against
Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to introduce new arguments in the media: Is Saddam a
legitimate president? Do Iraqi people have the right to gain their
freedom? Why isn't the opposition operating freely inside Iraq? And
why can't the Iraqi people, for example, assemble and conduct public
rallies inside Iraq if they're not happy with what the government
does? These are the questions that should determine what the United
States does," said Muhannad Eshaiker, an architect from Irvine who
will participate in the State Department's training. He left Iraq in
1977 at the age of 24.</TE>
<TE>   The program will bring in journalists and media personalities to
teach Iraqis how to "become shapers of public opinion" to counter
Hussein's "propaganda machine," the State Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll tell them: 'You know the message well. You know how brutal
Saddam Hussein is. You know the need for regime change and for us to
be more active. We want to turn all of you into more outgoing
spokesmen on this message. We'll give you the methodology to turn
this into a coherent message,' " the official said.</TE>
<TE>   But not all of the Iraqis who have been invited to participate in
training have fully signed on.</TE>
<TE>   Ilham Sarraf, a Los Angeles psychotherapist, said Saturday that
Iraqis are being repressed by "two evils"--Saddam Hussein's political
dictatorship and U.S. and U.N. economic sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   Sarraf, who came to the United States in 1962 as a teenager with
her new husband after an arranged marriage, still goes back to
Baghdad on missions with Physicians for Social Responsibility. Her
last trip was in 1999 as part of the Pencils for Peace mission, when
she took seven suitcases full of educational supplies.</TE>
<TE>   "The Iraqi people are trapped with severe sanctions, which are
intolerable to any human without food, shelter or safety," said
Sarraf, who describes herself as "the voice of the muffled voices."</TE>
<TE>   Mazin Yousif, an engineer in Orange County's Cowan Heights, has
long tried to coordinate the different factions of the Iraqi
community. He will come to Washington this week despite concern that
the United States might not be in sync with many in the Iraqi
diaspora.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm convinced the United States will attack Iraq, and I'm
convinced that the Americans will remove Saddam Hussein, but I'm not
sure if we're on the same page about not destroying the
infrastructure in Iraq and not simply putting some military officer
in power who will rule the country single-handedly," Yousif said.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, the question is: Will we see the emergence of yet another
dictator, or new, truly democratic rule? We will be the spokespeople
for this effort only if we're clear on this most important issue."</TE>

<KH>THE BLACK OKIES</KH>
<HD>A Lost Tribe's Journey to a Land of Broken Promises</HD>
<DH>'Going to California' was the rally cry of black
sharecroppers who traded one hardscrabble life for another in the San
Joaquin Valley.</DH>
<SE>THE BLACK OKIES / First of three parts</SE>
<AU>MARK ARAX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>   TEVISTON, Calif.--They emerged from the wind and the dust of
Oklahoma
more than half a century ago, hitching their dreams and cotton sacks
to the backs of old school buses and flatbed trucks.</LD>
<LD>   They headed to California across the same prairie that had
blown the white Okies west during the Dust Bowl. But these Okies were
black, and what they were fleeing wasn't drought but the pain of
their sharecropper past.</LD>
<LD>   Today, halfway between Hollywood and the Golden Gate Bridge, in
the shadow of America's richest farms, their tarpaper shacks rise out
of fields of salt and tumbleweed.</LD>
<TE>   The old migrants and their children, a lost tribe of Black Okies,
pass their last days in some of the worst poverty in the nation.
Their broken piece of the promised land sits in exile from the rest
of the state, a scattering of country churches and crooked huts that
seem lifted straight out of the plantation South.</TE>
<TE>   Some have no heating, some have no plumbing and some only a single
lightbulb to ease the night.</TE>
<TE>   Tucked away in a cranny of Highway 99 as it hurries past Teviston,
James Dixon sleeps on a 50-year-old bed of iron with a barley sack
for a pillow. The bed isn't quite long enough for his 5-foot, 5-inch
frame, so the 95-year-old Dixon rests his pillow on a beekeeper's
wooden box. He draws heat from a potbellied stove, burning the last
limbs of a pecan tree his uncle planted years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Weather and rats have chewed a gaping hole in his ceiling. To keep
it from falling, he wedges empty cans of Vienna sausage into the
crevices. Chickens in the San Joaquin Valley get a better roost.</TE>
<TE>   "Soon as I get into bed at night, I go to praying and singing," he
said with a stutter. "Church songs. I keep in good spirits."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon and his neighbors had come to this land in the 1940s
carrying a different dream. They left not only Oklahoma, but Arkansas
and Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, looking to keep alive their
rural souls, right down to the cotton picking.</TE>
<TE>   They were the great exception to America's great migration. Unlike
millions of other blacks fleeing the South and Southwest, liberation
for them wasn't Detroit or Chicago or New York City. Liberation
wasn't even Los Angeles or San Francisco, although some had worked in
the shipyards and factories for a time. Liberation was the fields of
white gold in the middle of California.</TE>
<TE>   Between 30,000 and 40,000 Black Okies, as they still call
themselves, arrived in the years after World War II. In a land rolled
out flat and never ending, they could be free from Jim Crow and the
forever debt that had turned tenant farming into a new form of
slavery.</TE>
<TE>   About 7,000 of them eventually settled in the Tulare Lake Basin,
where the biggest body of fresh water west of the Mississippi was
being drained dry by the nation's new cotton kings. On the alkali
flats of Tulare and Kings counties, they found what they cherished of
the old South--the same chickens to raise and hogs to slaughter, the
same junk to pile high and maybe one day use again, the same wooden
churches to fill with the same old slave songs.</TE>
<TE>   Now, nearly six decades later, the survivors of that forgotten
American exodus are dying one by one, a whole culture vanishing in
the white dust.</TE>
<TE>   "Ain't nothing but ghosts and the wind and a few of us ornery ones
still holding on," said Beulah Benton, a 93-year-old sharecropper's
daughter from Hearne, Texas. She traded in her cotton sack years ago
for a set of shears and a beautician's iron that steamed the kinks
out of her customers' hair. She is long retired now, living with a
Mexican man she met fishing one day on the ditch banks of the old
lake bottom.</TE>
<TE>   "Ain't nothing left but old smelly men and preachers here," she
said with a cackle.</TE>
<TE>   Their hamlets still sit in a no-man's land at the edge of towns
that long ago locked them out. Teviston, for one, is a glorified
squatters' village on the outskirts of Pixley. The city cops don't
come here, and neither do the city sewer lines. There are no
stoplights, no schools and no business, except for a soda machine.</TE>
<TE>   Every third house has been lost to fire from the blowing embers of
old wood stoves.</TE>
<TE>   Drugs and crime shatter everyday life. Brothers, fathers and
husbands sit in the cells of three state penitentiaries that rise
from the very cotton fields that brought their parents west.</TE>
<TE>   Like the irrigation water that flows to the big farms, the war
on poverty and the civil rights movement have passed over the Black
Okies. Many of the second and third generation left to pursue
opportunity in cities from San Diego to Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>Of those who stayed behind, some landed good jobs and moved into
stucco houses with fences and green lawns in Pixley and nearby
Hanford and Tulare. As a group, though, the 1,500 or so Black Okies
still living in the lake basin--the migrants, their children and
grandchildren and now great-grandchildren--have advanced in only the
barest of ways.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Williams, the 86-year-old widow of an Arkansas
sharecropper, lives with her son in a sagging house hidden by
long-needled cactuses and an intricate gathering of rusted washing
machines, ovens, refrigerators, camper shells, and piles of wood and
tires. There are chicken coops with too few chickens and hog pens
with no more hogs. "Don't feel sorry for me," Williams said. "Yes,
this is a shack, but it's my shack. God gave it to me. I ain't got
nobody coming to me saying, 'You owe me rent.' I sleep as long as I
want to and get up when I'm ready, and when the beautiful wind gets
to blowing, I can flap my wings when I want to flap them.</TE>
<TE>   "I sleep easy at night, right here in my little run-down shack by
the highway. It may not be your dream, but it's mine. Now you can
just turn around and leave us alone again."</TE>
<TE>   The Journey West</TE>
<TE>   Robert "Boots" Parker knew the Choctaw lands of Oklahoma like the
sting of his father's hand, having bootlegged wildcat whiskey out of
Broken Bow and Idabel during the Dust Bowl. Now it was 1948, and he
was about to become an improbable savior, the man behind the wheel of
a modern-day underground railroad. He would sneak blacks off the
plantations of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas and cart them
west.</TE>
<TE>   Parker had the perfect setup. Back home in McCurtain County,
Okla., sat his powerful white friend, Sheriff Walter Irons. Out here
in the San Joaquin Valley fields was Irons' little brother, Gus, who
had built a labor camp and needed to fill it with cotton pickers.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Irons was guaranteeing safe passage to any black tenant
farmer in Idabel who wanted to escape his debt. California was an
easy sell. Cotton kings such as Col. J.G. Boswell were paying $2.50
for every 100 pounds of fiber picked. A good worker could take home
$15 a day worth of tickets--the currency of the fields. There wasn't
a farm or factory job that came close to that in McCurtain County,
the moonshine capital of Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Going to California!'--that's all you heard," recalled Luke
Etta Hill, whose family decided to stay behind in Idabel. "I was a
kid and it looked to me like they were going on a picnic. And you
wanted to leave with them."</TE>
<TE>   The 1,500-mile road to freedom, known as Route 66, found Boots
Parker, a small, wiry man with bulging eyes, slouched over the wheel
of an old Texas school bus.</TE>
<TE>   "I made the journey into hell 32 times--Oklahoma, Arkansas and
Texas," recalled Parker, a 73-year-old farmhand who lives on the
north side of the Tulare Lake Basin. "The black folk never got out of
debt. Every year the boss man would tell them, 'Well, you almost got
rid of it this year.' They'd do anything to get their families out."</TE>
<TE>   Parker never encountered a problem in Idabel, where Sheriff Irons,
a big man in starched khakis and a gray Stetson, ran the show. He'd
tell blacks to gather at the courthouse on Sunday with a suitcase and
$35 each, the one-way fare. Trouble started when Parker had to cross
state lines to pick up blacks in Arkansas and Texas, two states that
didn't take kindly to sharecroppers and tenant farmers ditching their
debt.</TE>
<TE>   To sneak them out, he'd set up rendezvous points in the piney
woods and under bridges at 3 and 4 in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   "You weren't allowed on the plantation. I had to steal them off,"
Parker said. "Arkansas was the worst. If you got caught with a load
of blacks before you crossed state lines, they'd take the families
back, threaten them and burn up the damn bus."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until they reached the New Mexico-Arizona border
that they felt light enough to start cracking minstrel jokes and
singing old spirituals. If the squalid labor camps that greeted them
in Central California weren't exactly their vision of the Golden
State, they had plenty of time to make it right.</TE>
<TE>   Back home, the only water for cotton was the water that came out
of the sky. Here in the Tulare Lake Basin, with its maze of dikes and
dams and ditches channeling the water of four Sierra rivers, the
cotton stood waist-high and loaded with bolls. Each boll spilled a
fiber puffy and pure white. It took only a little walk down the row
to make 100 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Howard and Gertha Toney and their nine children from east Texas
couldn't believe their eyes that first morning out. "I was told that
there used to be a lake filled with water out there, but now it was
just cotton. Not a building or a house or a tree as far as your eye
could see. Just cotton," said Dorothy Toney, who was 10 when her
family settled outside Corcoran in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   Picking cotton was miserable work, damp and cold, and if the
migrants yanked too hard, the sharp edges of the bolls bit their
fingers. Gloves weren't an option because they needed to feel the
cotton.</TE>
<TE>   "There was every color and every kind working," said Gertha Toney,
95. "The thing I remember most is the chuck wagons with catfish and
hot links cooking right there in the fields. You could smell the
Louisiana hot sauce in the air."</TE>
<TE>   Some mornings, when the fog hovered too thick and the cotton
drooped wet, the call would roll across the field: Cotton too heavy.
This became an invitation to light a fire in an old tire, spread your
sack down at row's end and shoot craps until the fog lifted. Even
when it cleared, Juanita Noble might fill only a sack or two.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd pick enough to get a cotton ticket and then I'd lay that
ticket down in a game of tonk," Noble said. "If I lost, I'd pick a
little more and come back with another ticket. The games might last
two or three days. I'd go home with a few hundred dollars without
ever picking."</TE>
<TE>   Beulah Handsbur was introduced to the cat-and-mouse game between
picker and farmer as soon as she and her mother arrived from Okema,
Okla., in the summer of 1947. The crew boss had rigged the scale so
it began at five pounds in the negative. Each time she picked 100
pounds, she got credit for only 95. By week's end, a windfall of
thousands of pounds of cotton went straight into the boss man's
pocket.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long for Handsbur and the others to devise a
counter strategy. They stuck dirt clods and wild melons into their
sacks, adding back the missing pounds of cotton--and then some.</TE>
<TE>   "Did I feel bad? No," Handsbur said. "I had kids in school and
clothes to buy and food to shop for. The good Lord knew I had to make
it."</TE>
<TE>   Shack for a Home</TE>
<TE>   The plywood hut with an outhouse stands alone on the far side of
the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks. The weather-eaten door opens to
a 4-by-8-foot room with a single lightbulb overhead and cobwebs so
thick with dust that they seem to inhale and exhale with each draft.</TE>
<TE>   This is where James Dixon sleeps and prays and cooks meals on a
potbellied stove and keeps all the stuff that means the most to him:
a tattered suitcase that brought him from Louisiana to California in
1945 and a Christmas card, dated 1965, from his brother Joseph in
Pine Bluff, Ark. Joseph is gone like all the rest, 11 brothers and
sisters put to the ground in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Pine
Bluff. "I ain't got no Christmas cards in a long time," Dixon said.</TE>
<TE>   It is last fall and Dixon steps into his back room filled with
USDA food--generic applesauce, peanut butter, pork and beans, and
canned salmon. "No woman has ever cooked for me since my mother," he
said. "I cooked sirloin steak, pot roast and lamb chops on the Union
Pacific."</TE>
<TE>   At 95, he walks like a Marine. He trudges three miles to wash his
clothes in Pixley. Safety pins hold his shirts together. To keep his
pants from falling, he cinches a necktie around the waist. When it's
time to shave, he climbs into his broken-down '64 Chevy and lathers
up in front of the rearview mirror. He squeezes a golf ball at night
to beat back arthritis.</TE>
<TE>   But his shack has begun to crumble in a way he can no longer
ignore. He wonders if maybe he should reconsider that nursing home up
the road in Delano. He worries, too, about how far he can stretch his
Social Security and about the winter in front of him. "I don't mind
the heat, but it's hard to keep the cold out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He was just a boy in Arkansas, no more than 10, when he heard
those mystical words from his uncle: "Going to California." A decade
later, after his father had sold the family's 40 acres and moved back
to Louisiana, Dixon decided to join his uncle out west.</TE>
<TE>   It took him a while to get here. He joked that he talked with a
stutter and moved westward the same way--one state at a time. In
Missouri, he joined the Union Pacific, becoming a main chef on a
passenger line that ran between Kansas City and Denver.</TE>
<TE>   He was nearing 40 when he finally found his uncle in Teviston,
clearing out a stand of eucalyptus to plant a field of cotton. The
uncle died of a heart attack while digging a stump hole and never
sowed a single seed. Dixon buried him and began to rethink his own
life. He didn't want to keel over on some rail line between cities.
He quit the Union Pacific and, in 1948, moved into his uncle's shack.</TE>
<TE>   He picked some cotton and worked on a crew mixing concrete for
houses. He had a little well that pumped a trickle of water so putrid
that he hated feeding it to the collard greens, much less to himself.
Like his neighbors, he drove to the next town to fetch his drinking
water in milk pails.</TE>
<TE>   Then one day in 1958, a bearded Quaker in a red beret showed up at
his door with a harebrained scheme. Bard McAllister wanted to dig a
deep well and deliver fresh drinking water to the 150 shacks in
Teviston. Because Dixon's shack sat off in the distance, he would see
to it that he would get his own small well.</TE>
<TE>   McAllister was a gentle man from the hills of Kentucky. He
came west to work with farm laborers as part of the American Friends
Service Committee. He devised a plan to pay for the well with a
federal grant and a bond issue backed by the residents. But some of
the elders had been fetching water by hand for so long that they
wondered if it was really necessary.</TE>
<TE>   It took McAllister more than a year to persuade the kingfishes of
Teviston to form their own water district. They grabbed their shovels
after work and on weekends, digging and burying the pipes so fast
that the man on the trencher had to tell them to slow down.</TE>
<TE>   The turbine pump, a gift from the Jacuzzi family in Oakland,
arrived during Christmas week 1959. A photo of residents praying over
it ran in Time magazine, accompanied by a small story titled "The
Gift."</TE>
<TE>   "For the children this week, there were few toys, little tinsel
and only one Christmas tree. But the 300 Negroes of Teviston had a
promise of bounty that seemed greater than all the growing things in
the green valley: fresh water that would run to every house."</TE>
<TE>   If their hope was to build a black community of small farms and
shops, they needed more than tap water. They needed a surge of river
water from the canals that ran by their villages.</TE>
<TE>   By the force of gerrymandering, the Black Okies found themselves
excluded from the Pixley Irrigation District. They didn't have a vote
in the district's affairs and they didn't draw a drop of the river
water needed to coax crops from the ground. Still, they were assessed
$12 a year for the supposed benefits they derived from canal water
that seeped into their wells. Those who failed to pay watched the
district go to court and seize their land.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon still had his uncle's land but not the irrigation to make it
bloom. He had given up long ago on his hope of clearing the weeds and
planting a small stand of cotton. He raised and skinned rabbits to
put food on the table and was so frugal with his Social Security
checks that his neighbors swore he had a small fortune buried in the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as he approaches 96, Dixon dotes on two watermelon plants
that have come up from spit seeds. He keeps them alive with an
irrigation system that employs a plastic milk jug with a hole in the
bottom. He has calibrated the hole so that a gallon of water trickles
out over 20 minutes--enough time to achieve maximum soaking.</TE>
<TE>   But the water doesn't hold long in the thin, salty soil and
blistering heat. All that baby-sitting produces only a single melon,
a small one with a split down the middle.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, as the seasons change, he spends all day flattening
empty cardboard boxes and stuffing them into the plywood walls to
keep out the coming cold. "I worked all my days in the cotton fields
and on the railroad," he said. "I wasn't lazy. What happened to my
life?"</TE>
<TE>   A week before Christmas, after a night of freezing temperatures,
one of the pastors finds Dixon dead on the floor, his body lying next
to the potbellied stove. All the wood from his uncle's pecan tree had
been burned.</TE>
<TE>   Unfulfilled Promises</TE>
<TE>   What had happened to the promise of a new land?</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, the giant machines of California cotton began doing
the work of thousands of men. The Black Okies tried moving to other
crops. They swamped onions, bucked hay, pitched watermelons and cut
grapes. Then came the on-again flow of Mexican migrants willing to do
the work cheaper. By the late 1950s, the black field hands were more
or less expendable.</TE>
<TE>   For another thing, Jim Crow, California-style, came with a past
they knew little about. For decades, the Ku Klux Klan controlled
local boards of supervisors, police departments and school districts
across the valley. In the 1930s and '40s, as the Klan finally receded
in the fields, the racial baggage of the South rode out West in the
mass migration of white Okies.</TE>
<TE>   For a handful of blacks foolish enough to seek employment as city
and county workers, the reception was not unlike the one that greeted
Ruby Hill at the Delano Police Department in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   The star high school running back had entered the police academy
in Bakersfield without a hitch. Even though he was the only black
candidate, no one had bothered to whisper a word of discouragement as
he made his way through the six-week training program. He earned his
certificate and ran back to Delano to apply for an opening.</TE>
<TE>   The police chief, a big-bellied white man with a Sooner twang, sat
Hill down in his office. More than 40 years later, Hill recalls their
conversation this way:</TE>
<TE>   "How long have you lived in Delano, Ruby?"</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived here all my life, sir."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, in all that time have you ever seen a black policeman
in this town? It can't happen here, Ruby. It just isn't going to
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Hill shook his head but kept his cool. "I got a family. I need a
job."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, if it's a job you need, I can help you with that."</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of job?" Hill asked.</TE>
<TE>   "A garbage man," the police chief replied.</TE>
<TE>   Hill hauled away Delano's refuse for eight years, all the while
applying for police openings in Tulare, Porterville, Visalia and
Bakersfield. The response through the 1960s never wavered. He was
either one-third or one-half an inch too short or his muscular frame
too stout.</TE>
<TE>   The bigotry might have glowed a little more benignly in the
California sun, but that was all.</TE>
<TE>   "Out here, people had a smile on their face and a dagger behind
their back," said Wayne Franklin, who migrated from Houston to Los
Angeles in 1945. "It was a new kind of plantation, one without 40
acres and a mule. We were the mules."</TE>
<TE>   Their rural isolation had lulled them into a kind of slumber.
Throughout the civil rights era, they went about their business,
paying little mind to the outside world. None of the children who
came of age during the 1960s can recall a single march or protest
against the discriminatory practices of local governments and
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "These counties didn't care nothing about civil rights. We knew it
and we didn't push the envelope," said Lealga Fortson, a Texas
sharecropper's daughter who grew up in Delano. "I don't know why we
swallowed it."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they were too scattered and their numbers too paltry. But it
was more than that, they concede. A certain rural mind-set, a
sharecropper's shrug of the shoulders, had come west with them. "We
still have that slave mentality that God don't want us to reach any
higher because he's going to make it all right in heaven," said Leon
Richardson Jr., an auto body man who pulled himself up from a life of
drugs and did what so many redeemed men do here: He became a
Pentecostal preacher.</TE>
<TE>   "My father suffered from that same sharecropper mentality," he
said. "His house was being eaten up by these giant wood rats and he
didn't want to change a thing.</TE>
<TE>   "I was standing by the door one day talking to him and on the wall
I saw a wood rat that had to be 18 inches from head to tail. He was
just watching me and my dad talking, and I said, 'Dad, you see that
rat?' and he said, 'Yeah, he won't bother nobody.' And I got upset.
My dad was a decorated veteran, but it took me and the pastor to
convince him that he deserved better."</TE>
<TE>   The federal government, for its part, never set up shop here.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Mississippi Delta, the population of displaced cotton
pickers didn't seem large enough to justify a war on poverty. Except
for U.S. Department of Agriculture grants to build new water systems,
little of the $300 million earmarked each year for rural poverty in
California has made its way to rural blacks.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Boyer, a community worker with the nonprofit Self-Help
Enterprises, has spent 24 years patching up Teviston and gaining the
trust of the Black Okies. But even Boyer has a hard time pushing the
low-interest federal loans that are available to build new houses and
fix up old ones.</TE>
<TE>   The Black Okies mistakenly believe that such financing comes with
a hidden theft, that their property--the one thing they can actually
pass on to their children--will revert to the government when they
die.</TE>
<TE>   "They're suspicious of government, and who can blame them?" Boyer
said. "Teviston looks as poor as it did the day I started. I've come
to realize that I'm just helping them hang on."</TE>
<TE>   They hang on like the cotton in late fall. When picking time
finally comes, it must be clawed from the bolls. What cotton escapes
the machine's plunder still clings to the land, to tumbleweeds and
Chinaberry trees and the prison's razor wire. Months later, it still
holds on, dusty little balls clumped at the side of Highway 99.</TE>
<TE>   Turning to the Church</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday mornings they leave behind their solitary struggle and
join hands at the foot of altars beneath paintings of a Jesus who is
variously white and black and colors in between.</TE>
<TE>   In all its rural glory, the church is the one place where the
Black Okies become a community, where spirits soar above
circumstances. The old farmhands in brim hats chew Red Man tobacco
while the ladies in the basement, fingers white with batter, fry up
chicken thighs, and young boys chase young girls in the dust beneath
the mulberry trees.</TE>
<TE>   No matter its dislocations, black America has always turned to the
church to bear its burdens and keep alive its hopes. In the alkali,
where no other black institutions exist, the shoulders of the church
must be extra wide. There may not be a black-owned business for miles
around, but there are three dozen black churches standing solid
across the 30-mile Tulare Lake Basin.</TE>
<TE>   Rev. Alfred King tends to his flock in the middle of a cotton
field in Pixley. He worked for Sears &amp; Roebuck and a trucking outfit
before he came to his calling late in life. His Shilo Church of God
and Christ, founded in 1948, has just seven parishioners most
Sundays, too few for the pretension of a choir. They sing to
themselves right from their pews.</TE>
<TE>   In Stratford, downwind from a turkey farm, there is the Church of
God in Christ, where watching 100 people get seized by the holy ghost
is like watching kernels of corn sizzle and pop in hot oil. The
children sit patiently as the adults writhe their way through the
convulsive states. "Jesus died in agony but he didn't say a mumbling
word to save himself. They'll be a time when all our suffering will
pay off!" preacher Oratio Smith shouts.</TE>
<TE>   At the House of Prayer in Teviston, Pastor Lonnell Smith arrives
from Fresno 70 miles away for Sunday services and a Wednesday night
prayer. He feeds the congregation out of his own pocket--corn dogs,
doughnuts and fresh fruit--and on a Sunday in December he summons the
parish to join him on the altar. A rotund man in purple sunglasses,
he kneels down with two plastic bowls and washes every last foot.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the Calvary Baptist Church of Lanare, where the
walls inside are bare and the carpet is held together with duct tape.
The preacher, Denis Turner, wearing a Bert and Ernie tie, smears a
blessed oil on the hands of babies born prematurely to crack cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   On a hot June day, Rev. Turner calls forward Karen Elaine Bonner,
whose daddy was shot dead on Christmas morning more than 40 years ago
on these same grounds. It was a juke joint back then, and the
reverend leads Bonner past the spot that shattered her life when she
was 8.</TE>
<TE>   A towel in one hand, a Bible in the other, he takes her to the
edge of a wading pool where she will be baptized this Sunday morning.
"It looks like an ocean, don't it?" he said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Bonner wasted all her youth in anger, wondering how a man who came
with her father from Oklahoma could shoot him three times in cold
blood and leave her mother to raise eight children alone. Years
later, after he was released from prison and back in the
neighborhood, she tracked him down at a corner dice game. She began
playing in hopes that he would cheat or cross her, any little reason
to pull out her own gun and drop him dead. "That's how much
bitterness I had in my heart," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in a field of sunbaked weeds beside a garden of plum,
nectarine, fig, apple, apricot and pomegranate trees, Rev. Turner
dunks her in the plastic pool. She comes out shivering, scoured of
her old hates, of that old life.</TE>
<TE>   "God has been good to me," said Bonner, 50, a former correctional
officer who now works as a data processor for the Internal Revenue
Service. "In my other life, I was stabbed three times and beat over
the head with a pistol. I shot at people and fortunately never hit
anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "I did this to be part of a church family," she said. "When I die
now, the obituary is going say, 'Karen Bonner, she was a member of
the Calvary Baptist Church of Lanare.' "</TE>
<TE>   Death by Threes</TE>
<TE>   When they die, they seem to die in patches of three: a preacher, a
labor contractor, a homemaker. Born in Idabel, Okla.; born in New
Road, La.; born in Mineola, Texas. Died in Tulare, died in Teviston,
died in Lanare. The shorthand of the newspaper obituaries gives only
a hint of their part in an American exodus that defied the grain.</TE>
<TE>   Harbart and Gladys McKinney never doubted that they, too, would
die as they lived--in their little wood house at the edge of Highway
99.</TE>
<TE>   For 45 years, it had dodged the fires and sheltered four children
who grew up and found success in Fresno, Sacramento and San Leandro.
Then one day a few years ago, a snake showed up in the kitchen, the
biggest snake Gladys McKinney had ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   They tried pouring gasoline on its head and hitting it with a nail
attached to a stick, but the snake wouldn't go away. They called
their daughter in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "You gotta get out of there," she told them.</TE>
<TE>   That night, they decided to tear down the mossy old shanty on
concrete blocks and build a new stucco house with big front windows
and a real foundation.</TE>
<TE>   They would secure the financing through the same government
program that so many of their neighbors didn't trust.</TE>
<TE>   From start to finish, the new house took two months. They moved in
on Thanksgiving Day.</TE>
<TE>   "Three bedrooms and two baths," Gladys McKinney said, opening the
front door. "This is the kitchen. And this is the master bedroom. And
through this door is the two-car garage."</TE>
<TE>   She remembers the years of chopping cotton and the trips to Wasco
to dig potatoes from the hard earth. It was the worst work of all, a
belt strapped around the waist and a board with hooks across the
legs. On the hooks hung the itchy burlap sack.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept that potato belt to remind me that with God I can do all
things," she said. "He truly does all the blessing. He blessed us
with our first house and he blessed us to come from that house to
this home. We thank God for it every day."</TE>
<TE>   From her sparkling window, she watches the future roll in like
tule fog each late afternoon. The school buses from Pixley and Delano
rumble down Road 80 to drop off the children of Teviston. They are no
longer black but brown, the offspring of a new migration. The few
hundred Black Okies still left can hear the sound of hammers drift
across the cuts and trails. Young Mexican field hands are pooling
their resources and building houses and fences that enclose real
gardens and long-horned cattle.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the old black cotton pickers resent their presence. But
others, like 93-year-old Beulah Benton, who lives with a man from
Mexico, shakes her head in wonder.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got something we don't," she says with a catch in her
chuckle. "They got time."</TE>

<HD>Hard Choices in a Genetic Calamity</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Family seeks funds to treat a disease killing all
3 children--at most, hoping to save two.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>IONE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>When Tommy Bennett was born in September 1999, his parents were still
trying to figure out what was wrong with his older sister, Ciara. She
was slower than other children they knew. Was she hard of hearing? Or
maybe autistic?</LD>
<LD>   Last year, lab tests confirmed that Ciara had Sanfilippo syndrome,
a genetic disease that kills most victims by their teenage years.</LD>
<LD>   This February, the test results came back for John and Alicia
Bennett's other two children.</LD>
<TE>   "It was like getting hit by lightning," said Freda Bennett, John's
mother. "I was working in the garden when I heard my husband scream,
'No, no, no!' "</TE>
<TE>   Against all odds, John and Alicia Bennett of Amador County are
watching a deadly disease disable all three of their children: Ciara,
6; Hunter, 4; and Tommy, who will turn 3 next month.</TE>
<TE>   Their bodies lack an enzyme needed to break down chains of sugar
molecules. Over time, these molecules are stored in cells and begin
to build up, causing progressive organ damage. Sanfilippo affects
just one in 70,000 children. And as with many rare diseases that
don't generate much interest from researchers or drug companies,
there is no proven treatment or cure.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the Bennetts' insurer, Kaiser Permanente, denied their
request for an experimental stem-cell transplant at Duke University.
The Bennetts see that as their only hope. Although other insurers
have covered the experimental treatment for Sanfilippo, Kaiser said
the risk of dying from the transplant was too great, and that no
published research indicated it would work.</TE>
<TE>   The Bennett family's story pits two parents' desperate attempt to
save their children against the realities of health-care economics.</TE>
<TE>   "If we are going to hold costs down, some people are not going to
get treatment that might--just might--work, and some people are going
to die," said Michael Shapiro, a law professor and ethicist at USC.</TE>
<TE>   The Bennetts are hoping for a miracle. Reaching out to whoever
will listen, they have called newspapers and appeared on television.
They are trying to raise $1.5 million for transplants for Hunter and
Tommy.</TE>
<TE>   The couple said nothing will save Ciara; the disease has
progressed too far.</TE>
<TE>   Their close-knit community has rallied, as have supporters in
neighboring Sacramento County and beyond. Earlier this month, the
local American Legion lodge raised $10,000 at a dinner of tri-tips,
pasta, salad and a make-your-own-sundae bar. The next day, an
eighth-grade class collected nearly $2,400 at a carwash.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, the Bennetts have only about $80,000. They worry that,
if the pace of donations doesn't pick up, they will have to choose
which of the boys should undergo the procedure--a "Sophie's choice"
they are not prepared to make.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're both eligible, we have to decide: Do we try to save
Hunter and keep raising money for Tom? Or do we try to help Tom, who
has a better chance?" said Alicia Bennett, 34, who used to work as a
receptionist at a hospital emergency room.</TE>
<TE>   "We shouldn't have to choose which kid can live."</TE>
<TE>   Progress OK, at First</TE>
<TE>   When she was an infant, Ciara's progress was "right on key," her
mother said. The baby began walking 10 months after her May 1996
birth, and started speaking at about a year.</TE>
<TE>   But her speech was never quite right; she sounded as though she
might be deaf. The Bennetts began taking Ciara to specialists.</TE>
<TE>   "They all looked at me like I was crazy, but I know when there's
something wrong," Alicia Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   In August 2000, a new special education teacher at Plymouth
Elementary School took one look at Ciara's picture and suggested to
her colleagues that the youngster had Sanfilippo syndrome. The
teacher, Lisa Rhody-Buttner, who had worked with another Sanfilippo
child years earlier, recognized some telltale signs: puffy cheeks,
coarse hair and big eyebrows.</TE>
<TE>   Ciara was diagnosed with Sanfilippo in February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The day after last Christmas, doctors took skin biopsies from both
boys, confirming two months later that they also had the disease.</TE>
<TE>   "The doctors thought Hunter might, but nobody thought Tommy did,"
their mother said.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like getting hit in the kidney," said John Bennett, a
33-year-old trucker and volunteer firefighter, his voice trailing
off.</TE>
<TE>   The family had fared dismally in the genetic lottery. Unlike with
other diseases that strike at random, both of a child's parents have
to carry a defective gene for a child to acquire Sanfilippo.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, the chances are only 1 in 4 that such a couple's child
will have the disease. The chances of all three children being
affected are 1 in 64.</TE>
<TE>   John and Alicia Bennett said they know of no one else in their
families who has had the disease.</TE>
<TE>   The successive stages of Sanfilippo can be seen in the three
children. Ciara's vocabulary at one time was 200 words, but she no
longer speaks. Her walking is unsteady, and she trips often. She can
barely play with her brothers or with toys. She drools, and has
already begun having seizures, a sign that the disease is
progressing.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter, whose hair is pumpkin orange, says a few words, but uses
them sparingly. He walks and runs easily but often cries and pouts.</TE>
<TE>   And Tommy seems like a typical toddler, although he has not
started talking.</TE>
<TE>   During a visit earlier this month to Disneyland, Ciara, dressed in
a yellow "Princess University" shirt, chirped and moved her arms to
signal her pleasure on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. Hunter
cried because he hates the dark. Tommy slept, his head resting on his
mother's shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   This trip was intended to give everyone a rest. After leaving
Mickey's Toontown, Alicia Bennett bought the children sets of Mickey
Mouse ears, embroidered with their names.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to think about it," she said of the children's fate. "I
need a break from reality every now and then."</TE>
<TE>   Hope for Stem Cells</TE>
<TE>   Days after the boys were diagnosed, their mother e-mailed Dr.
Joanne Kurtzberg, director of the pediatric stem-cell transplant
program at Duke University. Kurtzberg is one of the few researchers
trying to find a treatment for Sanfilippo.</TE>
<TE>   She believes that stem-cell transplants, using umbilical cord
blood, may be able to stop its progression. The technique has worked
for similar neurological diseases by replacing defective cells with
healthy ones, and theoretically it could provide the enzyme that
Sanfilippo patients lack.</TE>
<TE>   Kurtzberg has transplanted stem cells from umbilical cord blood
into four children with Sanfilippo in the last 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   All are alive, but it's too soon to tell whether any of the
transplants were successful.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that this is the only therapy that offers
these children any chance," she said. "The alternative these kids
face is death and horrible neurological degenerative disease."</TE>
<TE>   The entire Bennett family flew to North Carolina in March to meet
with Kurtzberg and discuss the procedure.</TE>
<TE>   But Kaiser Permanente, California's largest insurer, has said it
won't cover the treatment. Dr. Mark Lipson, the insurer's geneticist
who treats the Bennett children, said the decision was personally
difficult but was medically justified.</TE>
<TE>   "The transplant offers no clear evidence that it will benefit
them, but it does offer clear evidence that it will cause them severe
pain, sickness and perhaps death," Lipson said. "Those are very real
risks."</TE>
<TE>   The transplant and chemotherapy beforehand obliterate the
children's bone marrow and the immune system, treatments that at
least 10% of young children don't survive.</TE>
<TE>   An independent panel of three pediatric specialists hired by the
California Department of Managed Health Care agreed unanimously with
Kaiser's decision.</TE>
<TE>   But other insurers have agreed to take the chance. Athena
Sarantinos of Seattle said her insurer, Premera Blue Cross, changed
its mind after initially denying coverage for the procedure. Her 2
1/2-year-old son, Luke, received his transplant June 28.</TE>
<TE>   She said family members had offered to sell their homes to raise
money if her insurer didn't come through. "We feel very
privileged.... Now we have hope where there wasn't any hope," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Citing members' privacy, Premera spokesman Scott Forslund said
that he couldn't address the Sarantinos case, but that for the last
two years his company has had a policy of covering cord-blood
transplants for Sanfilippo.</TE>
<TE>   Because the disease is so rare, he said, the insurer looks beyond
published studies, clinical trials and national guidelines to make
coverage decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Bowman said her insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Alabama, similarly approved the procedure for her 6-year-old son,
Andrew.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't know for a couple more years," she said of Andrew's
prognosis after his May 2001 transplant.</TE>
<TE>   'Holding His Own'</TE>
<TE>   "We just hope every day that he continues to talk, that he
continues to walk and that he continues to be Andrew. And right now,
he's holding his own."</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro, the USC ethicist, said insurance companies should not
necessarily be faulted for drawing the line at pursuing unproven
procedures.</TE>
<TE>   "If people want to keep a lid on health-care costs, society has to
stop things at some point," he said. But "in individual cases, it
looks like it is horribly unjust."</TE>
<TE>   As the Bennetts' story has become known, friends and strangers
have reached out to help.</TE>
<TE>   A room mother at St. John Vianney School in Rancho Cordova
encouraged eighth-graders to hold a carwash for the Bennetts.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the day's 105-degree heat, cars were lined up for nearly
six hours Aug. 11, raising nearly $2,400.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I met the kids, I realized that we needed to do something
about it," said Eric Watson, 13, who helped his mother organize the
event.</TE>
<TE>   Elanora Drake, secretary of the auxiliary for American Legion
Amador Post 108, said fund-raisers usually bring in $300 to $400. The
$10,000 raised a month ago was "really unusual."</TE>
<TE>   "We cooked it all, served it all, cleaned up," Drake said of the
event, which drew 250 attendees. "This is a small community. People
just get behind you."</TE>
<TE>   Malinda Goodman and her husband, Michael, donated two 10-day stays
at their home in Bali to be used in a raffle.</TE>
<TE>   "I told my husband, other than raising our son Samuel, I can't
think of anything more important or more worthwhile in my life than
to take this on," she said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bennetts have set up a Web site soliciting donations for their
children: www.helpachild.net. Donations also may be sent to the
Bennett Children's Fund, P.O. Box 1826, Jackson, CA 95642.</TE>

<LD>Dr Pepper is about to get expelled from public schools in Los
Angeles. So, too, are Coke, Pepsi and Mr. PiBB.</LD>
<LD>   In an effort to promote better health, the Los Angeles school
district's board is expected Tuesday to ban soft drink sales during
school hours at all of its 677 schools.</LD>
<LD>   Educators and legislators have been grappling for years with how
to curb junk food consumption on campuses. So far, only a handful of
districts, including the Oakland Unified School District, have
restricted soft drink sales.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to set a national trend," said Francesca de la Rosa of
the Center for Food and Justice at Occidental College's Urban and
Environmental Policy Institute. The Los Angeles Unified School
District, with 748,000 students, is the nation's second-largest.
"People will say, if you can do it at LAUSD, you can do it anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   But some principals and students at more than 200 middle and high
schools worry about replacing thousands of dollars they receive each
year from soft drink sales. That money helps fund field trips, school
dances and athletic programs.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Contreras, assistant principal of Los Angeles High School,
said his school stands to lose money for sports referees, dance
supervisors, student store managers and field trips. In the past,
Coca-Cola has offered the school $50,000 upfront for a three-year
exclusive contract, on top of the nearly $5,000 a month the campus
earns from soft drink sales.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only sell so many candy bars and have so many magazine
drives," Contreras said. "Honestly, some of those programs will be
hurt very badly, and I don't know what alternative we will have."</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Raymond, a 17-year-old senior at Dorsey High School, said
the ban would "be a real shocker" to students who depend on the money
to help pay for a number of activities.</TE>
<TE>   "When it is time for us to have dances and we don't have enough
money, we rely on money from vending machines," Raymond said. "Even
at pep rallies, we need to pay for our deejays. The school isn't
going to pay for that."</TE>
<TE>   School Board President Caprice Young said the district would phase
in the initiative slowly, in part to find alternative sources of
money. "We need to make sure the kids are drinking things that are
not unhealthy for them, and at the same time balancing the need to
have revenue for our clubs and sports," she said. "I think we'll be
able to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Genethia Hudley-Hayes, one of the three co-sponsors of the motion
before the school board, said the district should not be contributing
to the unhealthy lifestyles of children, particularly blacks and
Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Such children, she said, "suffer greater childhood obesity,
juvenile diabetes, asthma....Why do we let them get off of the bus
and have them rush immediately to drink a sugar-caffeinated drink,
and then say, 'OK, please now go participate in rigorous academic
training' ?"</TE>
<TE>   Hayes said she believes schools can make up money lost by selling
more healthful drinks.</TE>
<TE>   "People purchase what is available," she said.</TE>
<TE>   If the motion passes as expected, all schools will be prohibited
from selling carbonated drinks during school hours starting in
January 2004. Water, milk, drinks composed of at least 50% fruit
juice and sports drinks with less than 42 grams of sugar per 20-ounce
serving would still be allowed.</TE>
<TE>   A similar ban on sodas in elementary schools was signed into law
last October by Gov. Gray Davis, as part of legislation limiting the
sale of junk food and soda in public elementary schools. It will also
go into effect in January 2004. In May, a proposal to phase out sale
of sodas in all California public schools failed to clear the state
Senate's Education Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Similar unsuccessful legislation has been introduced in Maryland,
Oklahoma and Kentucky. Texas is the only state that bans the sale of
all junk food, including soft drinks, during lunchtime on its public
school campuses.</TE>
<TE>   The motion before the Los Angeles board is co-sponsored by Hayes,
Marlene Canter and Julie Korenstein. It was inspired in part by
research showing that nearly half the students in the district's
poorest schools were obese or at least overweight.</TE>
<TE>   A United States Department of Agriculture study conducted in the
mid-1990s showed that children ages 12 to 17 receive 11% of their
calories from soft drinks. A report published last year by doctors at
Children's Hospital in Boston showed that children who consume one
extra sugar-sweetened drink a day have a 60% greater chance of
becoming obese.</TE>
<TE>   "It's liquid candy, and it's screwing up our metabolism," said
Andrea Giancoli, a registered dietitian with Los Angeles Project
LEAN/Food on the Run, a state program that advocates healthier school
food and beverages.</TE>
<TE>   Sean McBride, spokesman for the National Soft Drink Assn., said
the board members' efforts to prevent childhood obesity are
misguided.</TE>
<TE>   "We are being singled out for a very complex problem," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The district should provide more nutrition education instead of
targeting soda sales, he said. "The one thing you simply cannot
ignore in this is the role of a sedentary lifestyle," he said. "This
is about the couch, not about the can."</TE>
<TE>   According to a 2000 study by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, half of U.S. school districts have contracts that give a
company the exclusive right to sell soft drinks on campuses.</TE>
<TE>   The 55,000-student Oakland Unified School District banned the sale
of soda and junk food during school hours last year, said Supt.
Dennis Chaconas. District schools earned nearly $500,000 from soft
drink sales each year. Chaconas said officials have not determined
how much money campuses have lost from the ban. He added, however,
that junior prom ticket prices went up this year because students
could no longer sell candy to help fund the event.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified's Venice High School, which is part of a state
program to help develop school nutrition policies, is set to remove
all soft drinks from its vending machines by the time school opens
Sept. 3.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never been the responsibility of our students to subsidize
their public education with their pocket change," said Jacqueline
Domac, a health teacher there. Since the school introduced water and
juice into its vending machines two years ago, she said, items such
as water and pure orange juice have proved highly popular and
Coca-Cola sales have decreased 17%. Domac said she has been working
to find vendors who offer more commission per bottle sold than
Coca-Cola does.</TE>
<TE>   Both PepsiCo Inc. and the Coca-Cola Co., which control the
majority of the soft drink contracts within the district, also sell
noncarbonated drinks that would still be allowed. Pepsi, for example,
also offers Aquafina water, Dole juices and Gatorade; Coke offers
Dasani water, Minute Maid juices and Powerade.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Phillips, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, would only say that his
company is continuing discussions with individual schools. Pepsi
officials could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the three co-sponsors of the motion, Young and
board member David Tokofsky say they support the ban. Board member
Jose Huizar could not be reached for comment Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The seventh board member, Mike Lansing, said he does not support
the motion because it does not go far enough. "Why just sodas?" he
asked. "Why not cheese chips? Why not candy or any fatty foods we are
selling in our cafeterias? We don't even prioritize physical fitness,
yet we're going to eliminate obesity by stopping soda sales?"</TE>
<TE>   For Veronica Reyes, 13, an eighth-grader at John Muir Middle
School in South-Central Los Angeles, being denied her joy of Pepsi is
almost unthinkable.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not used to water that much, even though my mom tries to make
me drink it," she said. "It's unfair because when we get thirsty we
need something to drink, and we don't want water. We want something
that has sugar."</TE>

<HD>To Holdouts, Offer to Buy Ohio Town Is Dust in Wind</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHESHIRE, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Boots Hern, 82, is balancing atop a ladder in her denim skirt and
sleeveless top, daubing white paint on her peeling front door. It is
an act of defiance.</LD>
<LD>   This Appalachian village, population 221, is about to be swallowed
by one of the world's largest electricity producers, an enormous
coal-burning plant that sprawls right up to Cheshire's backyards.</LD>
<LD>   American Electric Power is negotiating to buy the entire town: the
playground and the baseball field, the bait shop, the post office,
the brick bungalows and the double-wide trailers. Company executives
want their neighbors out so they can expand the plant--and put an end
to irksome complaints about flyaway ash and sulfur plumes.</LD>
<TE>   The deal is simple: The nation's largest utility will pay more for
Cheshire than it is worth, on the condition that residents go
quietly, pledging not to sue American Electric for any illnesses they
might be tempted to trace back to the plant.</TE>
<TE>   Most locals have snapped up the offer. The City Council is moving
to dissolve the town. County historians are taking pictures for the
archives. The post office bulletin board is crammed with posters
advertising property for sale outside Cheshire. Some residents
already are packing.</TE>
<TE>   "If you could have been here last night, you'd have wondered why
I'd ever want to leave. There was a full moon over the river and it
was beautiful," said Elizabeth Bailey, 82, who has lived in Cheshire
for three decades. "But as the old cliche goes, you don't fight city
hall."</TE>
<TE>   Boots Hern, clearly, puts no stock in cliche.</TE>
<TE>   On a sticky August afternoon, she stands on that ladder and
paints, grinning at her own saucy stubbornness. "See?" she says,
waving the brush. "I'm not going anywhere." The paint job is proof:
She's not leaving the house she and her husband built in 1954. "They
can try to twist my arm, but I'm too old," she calls down from the
ladder. "My arm won't twist."</TE>
<TE>   A few of her neighbors, perhaps half a dozen, have joined the
resistance, refusing to negotiate. Some complain that American
Electric, which reported revenues of $61 billion last year, is being
too stingy. For homeowners, the offer amounts to roughly two to three
times the assessed values of their properties.</TE>
<TE>   Others simply refuse to leave the one-stoplight village where they
raised their children, baked their pies, loved and lost, suffered and
survived.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where I set up housekeeping in February 1940, and I'm not
going to give it up," vowed Gladys Rife, 80.</TE>
<TE>   If she has to live amid coal piles and listen to barges unloading
night and day, Rife swears she'll do it. If the pizza parlor and the
beauty shop close, she intends to live in Cheshire all the same. If
they bulldoze the red-brick church and she has to preach the Sunday
sermon herself, she will, just so long as she can stay in her
immaculate two-story house, freshly painted and crammed with a
lifetime of memories.</TE>
<TE>   "Let the mayor and the council people get out of town," she
scoffs. "I watched 'em all grow up, but I can live without 'em if I
have to."</TE>
<TE>   The holdouts do have a slim hope of scuttling the deal. Town
lawyers are compiling a final list of who's in and who's out. If the
properties American Electric needs most for expansion are not
included, the utility can withdraw its $20-million offer for
Cheshire.</TE>
<TE>   Still, most everyone here expects to be getting checks--and
loading moving vans--within the next six to 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   If the deal does go through, it may make history. Environmental
contamination has forced the government to buy out several
neighborhoods in recent decades, most famously Love Canal in upstate
New York. Corporations, too, have at times moved neighbors away from
polluting facilities; the Doe Run Co., for instance, is in the
process of buying as many as 160 homes in Herculaneum, Mo., just
south of St. Louis, so families can escape fallout from the nation's
largest lead smelter.</TE>
<TE>   But officials who have dealt with environmental buyouts cannot
think of another case in which a company has taken over an entire
town.</TE>
<TE>   The pending dissolution of Cheshire has attracted enormous
interest, drawing French TV crews, German magazine writers and
reporters from across the U.S. to this impoverished corner of
southeast Ohio, where hay bales are scattered across the hilly
pastures and cows meander right up to the two-lane roads.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the media coverage has emphasized the presumed health
risks of living just yards from the power plant's twin smokestacks,
which puff swirls of smudgy vapors 24 hours a day. In fact, though,
few people in town seem much concerned about their health.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, folks here have looked out at the smokestacks from
their vegetable gardens and their backyard swings, from the
schoolyard, from the playground. The vapors smearing the sky have
been as much a part of the local landscape as the Ohio River. And few
have given it much thought.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't anything that was a problem to us," said Charles
Reynolds, 57, who owns the bait shop.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, locals did notice a problem, touched off ironically
when the utility installed new pollution-control equipment. The
devices did not work properly together, and residents began to
complain of burning eyes, blistered lips, nagging coughs and burn
marks on their cars. Now and then, on muggy days, they would spot a
blue haze hovering over the village, like exhaust from an alien
spacecraft.</TE>
<TE>   An outspoken few hired a lawyer. The gossip mill buzzed with
rumors of a suit. Then, someone suggested, perhaps half in jest, that
American Electric just buy the town out. To everyone's astonishment,
the utility agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The lawyers came to us and said, 'These people don't want to be
your neighbors anymore, so maybe you can buy the town,' " plant
manager Greg Massey said. "At first, you thought, 'They're crazy.'
And then you begin to think, 'Well we do need the land along the
riverfront [to unload coal], and the other property in town would be
a good buffer zone. So maybe it's not such a bad deal after all.' "</TE>
<TE>   Since the deal was announced in April, most residents say there
have been no major pollution problems. A $7-million repair job
appears to have taken care of the blue haze and blistering air. The
plant complies with federal and state air quality standards. (The
Environmental Protection Agency has accused it only once in recent
years of violating emission standards; plant operators are contesting
that citation, suggesting the data were misinterpreted.)</TE>
<TE>   Many residents--including a few who have been treated for
cancer--go out of their way to say they do not believe the utility
has caused any health problems. Indeed, several families plan to
remain within breathing distance of the plant's emissions when they
move out of Cheshire.</TE>
<TE>   To them, the crux of the deal is money: With the giant
smokestacks, coal piles and conveyor belts looming over Cheshire,
their property values are shot. They're thrilled with what they see
as a once-in-a-lifetime chance to unload their homes for at least
twice the assessed values.</TE>
<TE>   "We realize that even if there isn't any pollution, it sure looks
like there is," said Scott Lucas, 70, a former mayor. "We would have
been happy to stay here.... The danger is, if you don't sell [to the
plant], your house probably won't be worth a dime."</TE>
<TE>   Property owners just outside the town limits see that danger
clearly too, and are furious that they have been excluded from the
deal.</TE>
<TE>   Utility officials say they're moving Cheshire residents as a
matter of mutual convenience, not because of any health risks. So
they have no intention of buying other properties, including the two
schools just outside the town border or the scores of homes nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Hand-lettered signs posted on property just outside Cheshire spell
out the anger:</TE>
<TE>   "Left Behind." "Honk for Clean Air." "Caution, Hazardous Waste."</TE>
<TE>   "They're not even considering buying us out even though we're
breathing the same stuff," said Milford Gilbert, 57, drawing on a
cigarette. The wraparound wooden porch he is adding to his hilltop
home looks straight at the power plant. A sign painted with a skull
and crossbones looms from his lawn. "I guess the pollution must stop
at the village limits," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The bitterness tears up many in town, among them Gladys Rife. She
switches off an "Andy Griffith Show" rerun with a snort of disgust.
"Cheshire is nothing like that," she says, gesturing to the TV
screen. "Honey, listen, this deal has caused more problems.... Friend
against friend, neighbor against neighbor, family against family. So
many hard feelings. I'm praying it doesn't go through."</TE>
<TE>   If it does go through, it's unclear just what will happen to
Cheshire. American Electric may use some buildings as company
housing. Others may be knocked down. The plant will likely build a
new coal unloading station along the river. It may have to bend other
expansion plans around scattered holdouts, like Rife and Hern.</TE>
<TE>   "They say I'll be lonely and afraid if everyone else goes. Well,
I've got three dogs. I've got guns and they're loaded and I know how
to shoot them," Boots Hern said. "I have my telephone. And I talk too
much anyway."</TE>
<TE>   She has lived in Cheshire for 64 years. This is where she met her
husband, Charlie; where she married him and where she buried him.</TE>
<TE>   It's where she hangs her clothes on a line to dry in the river
breeze. Where she washes dishes while watching the Delta Queen cruise
past her kitchen window. Sunsets streak the hills pink at dusk.
Wildflowers parade in gold and purple. "There are memories," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy right here."</TE>

<HD>Remains Found in FBI Search for Oregon Girls</HD>
<DH>Crime: A shed in neighbor Ward Weaver's yard contained
human bones. Investigators will next focus on his newly installed
concrete slab.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Human remains were found Saturday in a shed behind the Oregon home of
Ward Weaver, a toolmaker with a history of violence toward women. The
discovery was as heartbreaking as it was gruesome.</LD>
<LD>   Weaver has said he is the prime suspect in the disappearance of
Ashley Pond, 12, and Miranda Gaddis, 13, who vanished this winter in
Oregon City and remain missing. Before announcing the discovery of
remains, FBI officials called the girls' mothers with the news.</LD>
<LD>   It was unclear how long the remains had been in the shed, said
Charles Mathews, special agent in charge of Oregon's FBI office. He
said they had been handed over to a medical examiner who will need
several days to make an identification.</LD>
<TE>   The search began at 10:30 a.m. Saturday with 40 FBI investigators
and a team of dogs. Mathews said the search would continue today,
with special focus on a concrete slab that Weaver apparently
installed in his backyard during the last few months.</TE>
<TE>   "The primary focus has been on the shed," he said Saturday
evening. "But the large saws have arrived, and we'll start on the
slab."</TE>
<TE>   Weaver's 1,200-square-foot rented home sits next to the apartment
complex where Ashley and Miranda lived, and relatives say Ashley
attended slumber parties at Weaver's house with his teenage daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The 39-year-old Weaver has denied he played any role in the girls'
disappearances. But his criminal history has not reassured family
members, who were already suspicious of him.</TE>
<TE>   He has served time in California for bashing his son's baby-sitter
with a 12-pound concrete chunk, and both of his ex-wives have filed
restraining orders against him. One alleged that he beat her with a
frying pan and threatened to kill her.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 9, Ashley failed to show up at the bus stop for school,
and Miranda and the rest of the community rallied to raise awareness
about her disappearance. Then, on March 8, Miranda never showed up at
school.</TE>
<TE>   Their disappearances spurred several jittery residents of the
apartment complex to move for fear of a serial kidnapper.</TE>
<TE>   The search for Ashley and Miranda had all but stalled this summer
until Weaver was arrested Aug. 13 for the alleged rape of his son's
19-year-old girlfriend. According to the Oregonian, his son told
authorities during a 911 call that Weaver had admitted he killed both
girls.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, as Weaver sat in jail on the rape charge,
Ashley's stepmother took the opportunity to snoop around his
backyard. Like most of the family members, Mary Campobosso had heard
the rumors that Weaver had recently installed a cement slab.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to the backyard to check it out and became so infuriated,"
Campobosso said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, she taped a huge sign to the concrete slab that said
"DIG ME UP!"</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Campobosso stayed glued to the television during the
search. "I'm just watching the minute-by-minute and just waiting,"
she said. "I'm very anxious. I have a flock of feelings colliding
right now."</TE>
<TE>   After learning that human remains were found, she broke into
tears.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver remains in jail on $1 million bail on the rape charge. He
pleaded not guilty, and his trial is scheduled to begin in October.</TE>

<HD>Shooting Scars on Arizona Land</HD>
<DH>Environment: Target practice is rife as urban growth pushes
up to the national monument. Only two officers patrol the
129,000-acre area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IRONWOOD FOREST NATIONAL MONUMENT, Ariz.--Darrell Tersey bumps the
four-wheel drive along a desert wash, steers up the bank and comes to
a dusty stop. The Bureau of Land Management agent steps out onto what
appears to be a dry lake bed. No living thing can be spotted within a
20-acre circle.</LD>
<LD>   The ground sparkles under the harsh sun. Closer inspection reveals
it is carpeted with shattered beer bottles and spent shell casings.
Tersey bends to collect what's at his feet and sifts through the
brass and aluminum shells in his palm, calling out their caliber: a
.38 Special, a 12-gauge (shotgun), a .357 magnum, a .45, some sort of
military-issue ammunition. With the toe of his boot, he pokes a live
.22 round.</LD>
<LD>   Locals call this area the Shooting Range, but it's not intended to
be. This national monument was set aside two years ago to allow
public access to a prototypical Sonoran desert landscape:
300-year-old saguaro cacti, 800-year-old ironwood trees, ancient rock
art and hiking trails through rugged mountains.</LD>
<TE>   But the surrounding urbanization has driven the Western tradition
of outdoor target shooting into the monument, about 12 miles
northwest of Tucson. Although such desert shooting is legal on
federal BLM land, it's not on state property, and Ironwood is a
patchwork of federal, state and private lands. Also not allowed is
destruction of property, plants and animals. Nor is endangering
public safety.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict pitting the right to target shoot against concerns
for public safety and the environment occurs on federal lands around
the country. But Tucson's growth of 20% in the last 10 years --twice
the national average--makes the problems here more acute. Officials
are seeking to address the problems, but with only two law
enforcement officers patrolling the 129,000-acre monument, the
shooting is likely to continue unabated.</TE>
<TE>   The scope of the damage done by so-called wildcat shooters is
breathtaking. Tersey walks 50 yards to a represso, a low-slung
livestock pond. Against the dirt berm are shattered computer
monitors, an exploded television set, a perforated car battery.
Someone cut a square sheet of tin and spray-painted a wraithlike
figure of a hooded Ku Klux Klansman in white. The figure's
red-painted eyes are shot out.</TE>
<TE>   Plants on the periphery of this improvised shooting range are
shredded. Bullets are embedded in the trunks of mesquite trees. The
skeletal carcass of a 12-foot saguaro cactus lists to one side. On
the ground are one of the plant's arms and the top 3 feet of the
cactus. The pieces have been shot off and are perforated with bullet
holes.</TE>
<TE>   At another shooting site, a hillside of mature saguaros has been
obliterated. Arizona's iconic plant is a notoriously slow grower: 4
inches in a wet year, not at all in drought years such as this. It
takes at least 75 years before a saguaro can sprout an arm. In an
afternoon's outing, centuries of growth can be erased with one
sweeping spray of automatic weapon fire.</TE>
<TE>   Tersey, who has worked in this part of southern Arizona for 14
years, shakes his head in disgust. He estimates that if this patch of
desert--also torn up by tire tracks--were left alone, it would
require 300 years to repair itself.</TE>
<TE>   That's not the only hazard posed by the shooting. With bullets
capable of traveling five miles through the air, safety concerns are
high for ranch families and livestock living within the monument and
those in subdivisions going up just outside it.</TE>
<TE>   Some argue that is it unsafe to shoot anywhere in the monument.</TE>
<TE>   The cherished tradition of freely shooting guns in the region's
vast open spaces is going the way of the open desert, disappearing
with Arizona's inexorable sprawl. As newly sprouted exurbs march into
once-empty desert, there are fewer and fewer places gun enthusiasts
may go for target practice. Commercial shooting ranges are closing,
done in by state laws mandating buffer zones--laws that were written
before anyone envisioned housing developments creeping to the edge of
the open desert.</TE>
<TE>   Hemmed in by growth, people are increasingly coming into public
land to shoot. One national forest in Arizona has already banned
shooting because of the overwhelming problems and lack of rangers to
patrol.</TE>
<TE>   What's happening at Ironwood Forest National Monument is not the
harmless target shooting and "plinking" of yesteryear. Rangers have
come across people firing cannons and tripod-mounted machine guns
here. One rancher who runs cattle in Ironwood says three of his
animals have been shot dead. Another says bullets have whizzed over
the heads of his three young children.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as the relatively new Ironwood monument is devising its
long-range management plan, it is also attempting to craft an
agreement with gun groups that would allow shooting within the
monument to continue. Officials believe what is decided here could be
a template for gun use on other heavily trafficked federal lands.</TE>
<TE>   "Freedom to shoot in the desert is one of the beautiful things
about living in the West," said Todd Rathner of Tucson, a board
member of the National Rifle Assn. "To go out in the desert and
plink, so long as you're safe and responsible--it's one of the
reasons I live in Arizona."</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "I don't agree with the destruction of property or
plants and animals. That has to be prosecuted. But we won't allow the
closure of public land to shooting. I believe we can work this out."</TE>
<TE>   Rancher Jesus Arvizu, whose family has been ranching here since
1847, said all of his No Shooting signs have been shot to pieces. His
livestock water tanks are full of holes. He wants to see the target
shooters restricted to designated areas within the monument.</TE>
<TE>   "I just had a guy out shooting next to my corrals," Arvizu said.
"Yesterday a guy shot a hawk and stuck him on one of my fences. Just
spread him out. Why would you do a thing like that? It's not safe
anymore. It's a major problem."</TE>
<TE>   The problems are manifold. In addition to the wildlife and
livestock that are endangered, so is their food source. The array of
vehicles that carry shooters deep into the desert destroy shrubs and
grass that deer and cattle eat. The tires break through delicate
desert soil, called the cryptobiotic crust, that can take generations
to replace. The denuded areas add to the dust problem.</TE>
<TE>   In the Los Robles Archeological District within the monument,
potshots have taken chunks out of centuries-old rock art found near
Ragged Top in the Silverbell Mountains. The extensive bank of
petroglyphs is part of the reason the district is on the National
Register of Historic Places.</TE>
<TE>   Another major problem is garbage, bulky items hauled in as targets
as well as whatever trash shooters leave behind. Last year,
volunteers hauled out 42 tons of junk from just one site.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pity," Tersey said, looking at another wildcat range where
a pockmarked refrigerator stood on its side. "I was raised shooting,
and the way I was raised, you don't shoot things that break. You pick
up after yourself. This offends me."</TE>
<TE>   Everything is a target. Lower down on the hill, what were large
boulders have been pulverized. In the debris field are a pierced golf
ball, a ragged bowling pin and tiny blasted parts from a toy.</TE>
<TE>   The shooters know they can come here with impunity. The BLM
manages more than 1 million acres in southern Arizona and has six
rangers to patrol that land. Of those, two are assigned specifically
to Ironwood. The rugged area is rife with lawbreaking; monument
officials estimate up to 2,000 illegal immigrants a week are shuttled
up from the U.S.-Mexico border along a corridor that also flows with
drugs and other contraband.</TE>
<TE>   In two years, officials say, law enforcement officers have made
about 300 stops about problem shooting. Officers prefer to give
warnings and have issued 20 citations since the monument opened.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have the people and we don't have the funding to deal
with this," Tersey said. "Anything we do will take time. There's no
immediate solution."</TE>
<TE>   That's not good enough for Steve Lehning, who manages the Agua
Blanca Ranch in the monument. Lehning, 44, is an ex-Marine and
emphatically begins his conversation by saying he grew up with guns,
learned firearm safety in NRA youth programs and is not anti-gun.
He's not out to pick a fight with gun enthusiasts, he says, but
safety is his biggest concern.</TE>
<TE>   Every school day Lehning ferries his youngest two children on the
back of an all-terrain vehicle to a distant bus stop. The five-mile
ride can be an obstacle course.</TE>
<TE>   "I had picked up my son and I was coming through the front gate,"
he said, recalling a recent incident. "A group of guys was firing
across the road. This guy had an AR-15 fully automatic assault rife
with a banana clip. He was just letting loose across the road. I had
to get down and talk him into letting me cross with my boy. It's
absolutely out of control."</TE>

<LD>It's a tragic story, one that shouldn't be repeated. But dog attacks
continue despite hard talk by authorities and the inevitable wave of
media coverage. This time, the victim was a helpless 2-year-old boy
in a La Habra neighborhood who was savagely mauled by a pit bull.</LD>
<LD>   Though the boy is now in stable condition, his scalp was torn from
his head; his forehead, cheek, chest, legs and eyelid were punctured.
Doctors say the boy's greatest danger now is infection. A surgeon
described the injuries as "of a very vicious nature." Had not
neighbors and roofers working nearby pulled the boy to safety, the
attack would have ended with his death.</LD>
<LD>   What is it going to take for people to recognize the fact that
dogs that traditionally have been bred for their fierceness have no
place in city and suburban life? Apparently, owners of these dogs
will act only when there is no longer any doubt that they'll be held
liable for their animals' actions.</LD>
<TE>   Dog attacks are going to occur. About 3,000 Orange County
residents have been bitten this year, and about 4,000 were attacked
last year. A majority of the attacks are thankfully mundane, and the
number of incidents hasn't risen in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The boy injured earlier this month luckily escaped with his life.
But the attacks are too frequent. Last week, a pit bull charged a
Garden Grove woman and bit her more than a dozen times. And a Los
Angeles postal worker was mauled by a pit bull and a shepherd mix
while delivering mail. All escaped with their lives, unlike Diane
Whipple, a 33-year-old San Francisco resident who was killed last
year by two ferocious dogs as she opened her apartment door.</TE>
<TE>   The pit bull involved in the recent attack will be put to death.
Its owner hasn't commented since the incident, but a family member
maintains that the dog never before exhibited this kind of
frightening behavior. Similarly, dog owners in the La Habra
neighborhood fret that the attack will further cloud the reputation
of pit bulls.</TE>
<TE>   But that dark shadow probably is the only way to underscore the
reality that certain dogs don't belong in urban and suburban
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to initiating criminal proceedings after attacks,
government should underscore the potential for danger by levying
heftier fees on breeders of animals known to create problems. Perhaps
the higher cost of buying these dogs will force potential owners to
think twice. Neighbors also must do their part by reporting incidents
involving dangerous dogs before a tragedy occurs. But those reports
will be made only if citizens believe law enforcement will take them
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   No one wants to take away or punish pets that serve as companions
and protectors. But owners must be made aware through fines and
criminal proceedings that humans are responsible when their animals
attack.</TE>

<LD>The Anaheim City Council did the right thing Tuesday night by
clearing the way for a Gigante USA supermarket at the Anaheim Plaza
shopping mall. The vote reversed a troubling city Planning Commission
ruling that would have prohibited the Mexico-based grocer from
opening its first store in Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   That's all the late-night talk show hosts would have needed: a
city hall so out of touch with its constituents that it bars a
Mexican-owned grocery store chain from selling a wide assortment of
tamales, tortillas and other items in a city where Latinos are the
largest demographic group, accounting for 47% of the population.</LD>
<LD>   The Planning Commission's wrongheaded move prompted everything
from charges of racism to questions on whether the North American
Free Trade Agreement has any teeth. In the end, the council's vote
reinforced the danger of government using its power to try to
engineer the look and feel of a community, as well as the necessary
role that free enterprise plays in society.</LD>
<TE>   Cities generally shouldn't be dictating what kind of retail
businesses belong in shopping malls. Granted, there is considerable
pressure to approve department stores and other retailers that
generate significantly more sales tax revenue than a supermarket.
Anaheim also was right to question whether Gigante's request for a
liquor license would swamp a neighborhood already awash in beer, wine
and liquor outlets. But Ralphs, Vons and Albertsons sell plenty of
Budweiser, so why pick on a grocery store where the beer sales might
be slanted more toward Tecate than Coors?</TE>
<TE>   The Planning Commission had no business suggesting that Gigante
wasn't the right kind of store for Anaheim Plaza. That smacks of a
Big Brother mentality that should have been put to rest years ago.
Consumers, not the government, should determine whether Gigante's
business booms or busts.</TE>
<TE>   The positive news flowing from the Gigante flap is that Orange
County political activists who rarely share the same stage closed
ranks in protest. Nativo Lopez, co-director of Hermandad Mexicana
Nacional, an organization that assists Spanish-speaking immigrants,
stood side by side with Curt Pringle, a former Republican speaker of
the state Assembly and one of five candidates for mayor in Anaheim in
November.</TE>
<TE>   We'll see whether political alliances formed during the Gigante
debate lead to anything more than a mutually beneficial photo op.
But, at the least, Anaheim managed to wipe some huevo from its civic
face.</TE>

<LD>Orange County's Joplin Youth Center, charged with the task of getting
youth offenders back on a civilized track, faces a big problem that,
left unsolved, will make it even more difficult to do the job.</LD>
<LD>   The situation boiled over earlier this month when a judge threw
out a county environmental impact report supporting a plan to expand
the Trabuco Canyon detention center. The judge said the county could
go back to the drawing board, but the delay means the county
Probation Department is likely to lose an $8.4-million state grant
needed to help finance the $18-million facility. That represents a
potentially fatal blow to the planned 90-bed Rancho Potrero
Leadership Academy, which would relieve overcrowding at the Joplin
facility.</LD>
<LD>   Trabuco Canyon residents who sued the county over the project are
welcoming the judge's ruling that the project isn't in keeping with
county plans for the rustic area. The ruling dovetails with one
nearby resident's complaint that the county has used Trabuco Canyon
as "a broom closet."</LD>
<TE>   Canyon dwellers, under assault by development, clearly don't want
to see an expanded county Probation Department presence. But the beds
are needed. By 2005, the county will need an estimated 300 additional
"nonsecure" beds like those at Joplin, along with 200 "secure" beds
like those at Juvenile Hall in Orange, to house offenders between the
ages of 12 and 17.</TE>
<TE>   The county's failure to produce a solid environmental impact
report is bad news for county residents because the youth offenders
who keep Joplin filled, and who would inhabit the proposed academy,
represent the next generation of adult criminals.</TE>
<TE>   Joplin has room for 64 teenage boys who are funneled into the
facility by the Probation Department for such serious offenses as
attempted murder, assault and battery, illicit drug use and
vandalism. Law enforcement recognizes 351 criminal gangs in Orange
County and, at this moment, about 10% have members in Joplin.</TE>
<TE>   Joplin and the proposed academy are society's chance to intervene
before it's too late. About 70% of Joplin's residents are one-time
visitors, so there's evidence that the program works. Probation
workers try to give these teens strategies to avoid potentially
explosive situations--like knowing better than getting into a car and
cruising a rival gang's neighborhood with a pistol under the seat.</TE>
<TE>   Joplin credits its success to putting rival gang members under the
same roof and forcing them to learn to get along. Residents eat,
attend classes and play basketball together at an old military
barracks that has been transformed into a dormitory. The program
forces potentially deadly rivals to recognize they're more alike than
most care to admit. Armed with that new knowledge, probation workers
say, youthful offenders are less likely to make emotional mistakes
that keep them on the wrong road.</TE>
<TE>   The county should press the state to keep the grant available at
least until the Probation Department determines whether it can submit
an environmental impact report that won't get thrown out of court.
Failing that, the county should press forward on alternative
locations. Probation officers warn that it's a matter of society
paying now or waiting until a bigger, more dangerous bill comes due.</TE>

<HD>County Should Obey Law in Building Camp</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Ruling May Kill Detention Camp," Aug. 17:</LD>
<LD>   The Times' recent coverage of the lawsuit heard in a San Diego
County court concerning the Rancho Potrero Leadership Academy project
states that local residents oppose the project because it would
"increase traffic and harm the rustic surroundings."</LD>
<LD>   However, the real gist of the lawsuit was that the county of
Orange had consistently violated the law in its attempts to proceed
with this project. Judge Lisa Guy-Schall found that not only was the
environmental impact report inadequate, but the public had not been
given proper notice under the California Environmental Quality Act
and that the Orange County Board of Supervisors' decision to amend
the Foothill Trabuco Specific Plan was illegal, arbitrary and
capricious.</LD>
<TE>   If county staff wants to set an example for their incarcerated
Probation Department juveniles, I suggest that they should obey the
state and local laws themselves when building and managing their
detention facilities. Anything less is not only an affront to the
citizens they serve, but according to Guy-Schall, it is illegal and
unacceptable.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Bring Peace to Land Battle," Aug. 18:</TE>
<TE>   As noted in your recent articles and today's editorial, our battle
to stop the proposed jail facility in Arroyo Trabuco was the opening
firefight of an environmental war in the foothills. There is the
299-home Saddleback Meadows development plus another subdivision of
180 homes in the Cook's Corners area. A 30-acre strip mall with a
12-pump gas station across from Cook's Corners is moving forward.</TE>
<TE>   The jail was planned near the upper reaches of Trabuco Creek,
while the other projects are at the headlands of Aliso Creek, with a
portion of the runoff going to Trabuco Creek. If the California
Environmental Quality Act adjudication of Aug. 16, in essence
overturning the county's own environmental impact report, is applied
to these subdivisions, they will further degrade the environment and
should not be built.</TE>
<TE>   These 479 additional homes and the strip mall will add toxic
contaminants to acknowledged polluted watercourses, and cumulatively
become a clear violation of the new storm water permit and the Clean
Water Act. Too often, environmentalists are seen as mere
obstructionists or NIMBY protesters, when in fact we are protectors
of a forward-thinking planning process.</TE>
<TE>   We must incur tremendous legal debts and engage our county in
protracted litigious battles on a piecemeal, site-by-site basis. The
county should save the taxpayers further legal fees and buy the land
or perhaps the development rights to achieve a "win-win" for the
open-space inheritance of its own residents' children. As your
editorial pointed out, these areas are "backwoods highways" for
wildlife and have intrinsic aesthetic value as well. "Wilderness for
its own sake," as Arne Naess said.</TE>

<LD>Re "What Does It Take to Get a Teaching Job?," Aug. 19:</LD>
<LD>   I just read Don Freeman's letter about trying to get a teaching
job and I can take it one step further. I have a valid life teaching
credential and 15 years of experience teaching social science. I have
a master's degree. I have applied to numerous districts to get back
into education and landed only one interview and no job.</LD>
<LD>   I really believe there is age discrimination in hiring in the
districts, and they do not want to hire people with a lot of
experience because we are too expensive. School districts can keep
moaning about not having enough qualified applicants as much as they
want, but there are many like me who could add to the quality of
education if those doing the hiring look beyond our graying hair and
education.</LD>
<TE>   Roy Rhino</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freeman's lament is answered in his own letter: He has a master's
degree, and if the degree relates to the subject covered by his
teaching credential, then he will continue to have a hard time
finding a teaching job. School boards don't want to hire the best
teachers. They want to hire the cheapest teachers.</TE>
<TE>   With a master's degree, Freeman would have to be paid more than
someone without that level of training and expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Worse yet, school boards today strive to hire people without any
credentials. People hired on deceptively named "emergency permits"
can be paid even less than the regular starting salary for newly
credentialed teachers and can be frozen at that low salary level for
as long as five years or until they earn a credential. Few do
because, for most, teaching is just a between-jobs fling. So kids are
being taught by a revolving door of untrained, uninterested people.
What a great future being created for our nation. The emergency
permit is supposed to be just that: a mechanism for dealing with an
unforeseen emergency that requires the hiring of teachers without
credentials. Today, however, the "emergency" is a routine way for
school boards to hire the cheapest teachers.</TE>

<LD>Re "Unlikely Alliance Backs Mexican Grocery Store," Aug. 17:</LD>
<LD>   Any opposition to political activist Nativo Lopez is certain to,
in his words, "smack of racism and racial profiling." Bright
politician that he is, Anaheim mayoral candidate Curt Pringle
recognizes that about half of Anaheim's population is Latino--and the
elections are just around the corner.</LD>
<LD>   Whether the reason for the city Planning Commission's rejection
was anti-Latino sentiment or an overabundance of liquor licenses, the
City Council should not overlook the cultural effect of allowing
Gigante to open a store in the city. Lopez accuses Anaheim of using
"social engineering" to deny the license.</LD>
<TE>   But for Anaheim to ignore Gigante's emphasis on Spanish signs over
English would be another politically motivated intrusion on our
Anaheim culture similar to recent immigration accommodations for
driver's licenses, tuition assistance, Mexican identity cards, and
health care--all of which are social-engineered programs that have
exacerbated illegal immigration problems.</TE>
<TE>   The council should not overlook the self-serving motivation for
Gigante support behind biased political activists like Lopez,
national co-director of Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, who demanded
that the council grant the license, or his fellow supporter Pringle.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Mexican Supermarket Meets Obstacles in Anaheim," Aug. 5:</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week as I was reading The Times, I ran across an
article regarding Anaheim and supermarket Gigante USA. The article
stated that a proposed store location was being denied. I was baffled
as to why this would be, given the ethnic makeup of our city.
Although city officials denied discrimination, I am curious to know
what would be a legitimate cause for them to deny this proposal,
which in my opinion would serve as a great opportunity for our
community.</TE>
<TE>   I am a proud American who genuinely believes in the American
dream. However, I continue to follow the traditions and culture of my
native Mexican parents. To me, this store would provide my community,
as well as me individually, the opportunity to find Mexican items in
a convenient manner.</TE>
<TE>   When Anaheim officials make decisions concerning our community,
they should keep in mind that a large part of their constituents are
of Latino descent. I hope that our city officials will reconsider. I
would still like to continue believing that you can succeed in this
country based on hard work rather than race or ethnicity. I still
have faith in the American dream.</TE>

Todd Spitzer and Thomas W. Wilson were doing their level best to
upset the "will of the people" as expressed in Measures A and S,
which would have made El Toro Orange County's second (and only
decent) commercial airport? I guess it depends on whose "will" you're
talking about. In Measure W's case, it was the "will" of the South
County tail wagging the county dog. The measure carried only in 11
South County cities.</LD>
<TE>   These South County residents are so eager to protect their
precious lifestyle from this monster airport. Can't they see that
lifestyle is even now disappearing under a sea of housing tracts,
shopping malls and other commercial development, with their attendant
increase in traffic congestion, air pollution and demand for air
transportation?</TE>
<TE>   It's time for South County politicians and residents opposed to an
El Toro airport to grow up and start acting like responsible adults
willing to shoulder their fair share of their own air transportation
needs.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Debate Over El Toro Airport Continues Anew," Aug. 18:</TE>
<TE>   Michael Kennedy wrote that the El Toro commercial airport won't
stay dead no matter how many stakes are put through its heart. That's
because the Freddy Krueger monster of airport demand will not stay
dead. We cannot ignore it and hope it will just go away.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy believes that a "V-Plan" would use western takeoffs and
send jets over Irvine and Newport Beach. In fact, that is false. The
east-west runway would be eliminated altogether because it has a
significant slope from one end to the other that would require
extensive regrading. There also is a strong daily wind in the
afternoon that would make it inoperable for several hours.</TE>
<TE>   Here is how the V plan would work. Aircraft would come from the
north, flying over Irvine Lake while avoiding any homes or schools in
the process. Takeoffs would go south with an immediate southwest turn
toward the Laguna Coast wilderness area, also avoiding any homes or
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to the popular divide-and-conquer myth, jets would go
toward El Morro Beach and not over homes in Newport Coast. By the
time the jets did make it to the coast, they would be 6,000 to 8,000
feet in altitude. This is a great plan that would not affect any
residential areas, including Kennedy's hometown of Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Now I would like to give Kennedy credit for stepping up to the
plate and at least coming up with a possible solution, which was to
expand the runways at John Wayne. While it is technically workable,
the downfall is this would require using eminent domain for
displacing numerous homes and businesses. At El Toro, nobody would be
forced to move. The land and the runways are already there. Let's
take advantage of what our federal taxes have already paid for.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Niewiarowski</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Heights</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For once, I find myself in disagreement with Kennedy's view. In
this instance, he is just as guilty of being as location-biased as
the Newport Beach and Costa Mesa letter writers he has indicted.
Since no one loves pollution, noise and traffic congestion, it should
come as no surprise that an international airport is not desired by
most in the affected communities.</TE>
<TE>   However, to suggest further expansion of John Wayne Airport is
truly irresponsible and reeks of pure self-interest. We cannot ignore
the fact that our county's population is still growing, and we must
plan for our future transportation needs now. NIMBY attitudes must
not be allowed to prevail over reason if a solution is to be found.
The question is thus: "If not John Wayne or El Toro, then where?"</TE>

<LD>Re "Monitoring of Coastal Waters Is in Question," Aug. 15:</LD>
<LD>   The story was proof that much of what local activist organizations
use for ammunition is not based on sound science. How else can one
account for the Natural Resource Defense Council's allegation that
there has been an 81% increase in beach closures over the last year,
even though this new study verifies that water quality has continued
to improve over the previous four decades in Huntington Beach?</LD>
<LD>   This misinformation has served as the foundation for strict new
storm water permits, which have been proposed by the local regional
water quality boards. As a member of the Orange County Regional
Chapter of Community Assns. Institute, I am well informed of the
financial burden these regulations will place on homeowner
associations across the county.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed storm water regulations will cost south Orange County
$1.4 billion, with homeowner associations paying much of these costs.
The regulations would force associations to spend thousands of
dollars for capturing, treating, monitoring, testing and performing
maintenance of on-site storm water facilities--all to create tiny,
hardly measurable improvements in water quality. Why should we have
to do this, which will raise the cost of housing, if water quality is
improving under old regulations?</TE>

<LD>Re "O.C.'s 'Dyke March' Is Small but Spirited," Aug. 18:</LD>
<LD>   I was very surprised at this inaccurate news story, which stated
that only about 100 people showed up at the rally at Lions Park in
Costa Mesa. There were between 200 and 300 in attendance, including
male supporters who enthusiastically marched in the event along with
hundreds of lesbian, bisexual and transgender women.</LD>
<LD>   What I witnessed was fabulous entertainment, exciting and
informative organizations presenting at booths and a feeling of joy,
freedom and sisterhood that permeated the day.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of people had the courage and conviction to march in the
streets in passionate support of ending homophobia in traditionally
conservative Orange County--that is the real story. The truth is,
this event was a huge success, and yes, there will definitely be more
dyke marches.</TE>

<HD>Cypress Citizens Should Control City's Growth</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "The Real Issue Is Revenue," Aug. 11:</LD>
<LD>   Your editorial on the Cottonwood vs. Cypress case states that "the
real issue is revenue," but the more fundamental one is: Can citizens
control the development of their own cities? Continuing a long
tradition, Cypress residents voted overwhelmingly in 1990 for
commercial development in the redevelopment zone near the Los
Alamitos Race Course.</LD>
<LD>   But Cottonwood Christian Center came in and picked off the prime
commercial location in the redevelopment zone, without first getting
a permit to build a church on it, and even in the face of a warning
from the city that a permit for a church probably wouldn't be
granted. It's clear that Cottonwood intended from the outset to
stiff-arm its tax-free land use through our zoning, under the cloak
of religious freedom. It's galling that this tactic seems to be
working with the judge and your editorial writer.</LD>
<TE>   The judge's comments and your editorial completely disregard the
vote of Cypress residents for commercial development. Don't our votes
count for anything?</TE>
<TE>   Earl R. Beck</TE>
<TE>   Cypress</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Well, of course, the real issue is revenue--revenue to support
schools and many other activities important to all citizens of
Cypress. Isn't that what all cities seek? I would hardly place
Cypress in the "cash-strapped cities" category, as you put it. The
city has built a solid tax base with its industrial park. We citizens
of Cypress appreciate that your editorial does admit we are not a
godless city and do have many churches here. So, people, lay off the
bigotry baloney!</TE>
<TE>   Regarding eminent domain: This is not an illegal process and the
Cottonwood Church realized such a thing existed when it acquired the
land. For the uninformed, Cypress is not taking away a church, as
none exists on the land. Also, Cottonwood is being offered
compensation as well as the opportunity to acquire property not far
away.</TE>
<TE>   My interest in all this? Not Costco, as I would probably never
shop there. Not Cottonwood, particularly after the mean-spirited
literature that was mailed and comments by some of its members.</TE>
<TE>   What I would like is for this whole mess to be resolved so that
the media and residents of communities removed from the situation
will stop dumping on my city.</TE>

<LD>Re "College District Seeks Bonds, Another Might," July 31:</LD>
<LD>   There is no doubt that the three colleges in the Coast Community
College District need repairs to aging buildings. At Orange Coast
College, for instance, there are loose ceiling tiles in the
classrooms, students and faculty have tripped on threadbare carpets
and classrooms and faculty offices lack heating or air-conditioning.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, the administration building is the most
comfortable place on campus. The temperatures are always proper, the
washrooms are immaculate and the carpeting is less than a year old.
Orange Coast (along with Golden West and Coastline colleges) are
heavily staffed with part-time teachers who vastly outnumber their
full-time colleagues and who are the lowest-paid college teachers in
the county and among the lowest paid in the state.</LD>
<TE>   They receive no medical or retirement benefits and have no office
space.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, the colleges need funds desperately. Some of our buildings
were built in the 1950s, and even then they were put up quickly to
solve an immediate need. Some of the deterioration is severe. This
year, drastic state cuts in funding to community colleges have
exposed many problems that could more easily be camouflaged in better
economic times.</TE>
<TE>   The district has mandated severe cuts in the three colleges. The
bulk of the cuts will come from academic programs. Administrative
cuts, if any, will be cosmetic. Over the years our administrators
have created an educational bureaucracy that is a money-devouring
disgrace. Tax dollars that are sorely needed for academic programs
are spent on everything but the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Those who run our district need to demonstrate a philosophy more
in tune with classroom needs than with their own comfort and
insulation. During the last several years, the importance of students
and quality education have gotten only lip-service. Until it is
clearly demonstrated that students come first, a bond issue might be
throwing good money after bad.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Sex Offenders to Be Listed on Web Site," Aug. 15:</LD>
<LD>   The Times reports that Los Angeles and Orange counties'
supervisors voted to create sex offender Web maps and that a law
enforcement agency made the Megan's Law list of sex offenders
available to Orange County fairgoers between rides and snow cones.
Such responses attempt to address people's understandable panic after
Southern California's two high-profile child abductions. But suspects
in those cases were not on the Megan's Law list. And, even if the
suspect in the Orange County case had been, the abduction occurred
miles from his home, so the girl's neighbors could not have
pinpointed him as suspicious.</LD>
<LD>   Local officials should avoid emotional pressures to offer costly,
counterproductive solutions. San Diego's sex offender Web maps, with
their sea of colored dots, pointlessly keep the public on edge. A San
Diego official was quoted as saying the Web map may be discontinued,
citing the "huge" maintenance effort.</LD>
<TE>   Maps and lists terrorize listed individuals. One lawyer gets 40
calls annually from people who committed crimes more than 25 years
ago and still get hate mail or who can't find a job because they're
on a Megan's Law list. Vigilante actions occur against listed people
and their relatives. Since loneliness and anxiety are contributing
causes of sex offenses, lists and maps probably have the perverse
effect of increasing recidivism. Elected officials should not succumb
to pressure to "do something" if that something causes more problems
than it solves.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bill Would Aid Toll Lane Purchase," Aug. 13:</LD>
<LD>   The diagram accompanying the article provides an excellent
description of this complex and costly expansion of the interchange
between the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways. The changes are needed
to help reduce congestion caused by cars weaving in from carpool
lanes. It should be pointed out that all this construction would not
have been necessary if there were no carpool lanes.</LD>
<LD>   Carpool lanes were supposed to alleviate congestion by encouraging
ridesharing. The lanes instead have left us with added congestion and
a $150-million bill to correct this mistake. A more effective and
less costly solution would have been to just convert the carpool
lanes to regular lanes.</LD>

<LD>Re "Transportation Fix That Isn't," Aug. 18:</LD>
<LD>   Although I've known Jack Mallinckrodt for about 58 years, attended
two universities with him (Notre Dame and Stanford) and consider him
a longtime friend, I strongly disagree with his proposition that
light rail causes more problems than it solves. He excelled at
measuring the acceleration of a rocket sled and in countless other
cases of high-tech problem solving. But I believe his rationale
negates the proper role of government, in this case to provide its
citizens with the best and most economical means of getting from one
point in the county to another.</LD>
<LD>   Since my youth, I've watched Orange County turn from orange groves
to subdivisions and strip malls--along with more freeways and auto
congestion. It's always easy for the fortunate of us to rail against
rail without considering the plight of those who can't afford a car,
or for that matter, even a home near work. If we don't begin to
correct the malaise that is Orange County transportation today, we
never shall.</LD>
<TE>   True, it will be difficult and costly beyond expectation. But for
one of the wealthiest places on Earth, surely we can find the moral
compass to right a wrong that is perpetuating itself with more and
more cars, roads and freeways.</TE>
<TE>   We must start measuring our society by what is possible and not by
what is fiscally irresponsible in the eyes of those who don't need
such services. One has only to visit Europe to see the success of
melding rail and road into a system that serves all fairly.</TE>

<TE>   Mallinckrodt was dead-on in his characterization of the CenterLine
folly trolley as worse for traffic than a hole in the ground into
which you pour your billions. The irony of his exposition is that his
technical information comes from Orange County Transportation
Authority studies and analyses. The mind-set at OCTA is: "We'll build
it no matter what our studies and our environmental impact reports
say!" That money could certainly be put to better uses to solve
traffic problems, as OCTA's own analyses have shown.</TE>

agency is to obtain and disseminate good information, not to mention
protect the common welfare.</TE>
<TE>   I am waiting for you to apply this standard to OCTA, which was
castigated by the Orange County Grand Jury's 1999 report. Yet OCTA
continues its deceit in its unabashed marketing campaign to promote
the CenterLine. Neither the citizens' welfare, as pointed out by
Mallinckrodt, nor the grand jury report is evident in OCTA's
propaganda.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps The Times should remind OCTA of the main job of public
agencies.</TE>

<LD>Re "It Looks Like Hard Times Ahead for the Caviar Crowd," Aug. 12:</LD>
<LD>   It seems that the research department missed one other variety,
beyond beluga, sevruga and osetra.</LD>
<LD>   Karaburun is actually the variety that the cognoscenti consider
the most treasured. Not surprisingly, it's also the least known. It
was only recently reintroduced to the U.S. market after its virtual
disappearance, due to the Iranian revolution, when the necessary ban
on Iranian imports was put in place. It too is found only in the
Caspian Sea.</LD>
<TE>   However, it occurs in the smallest of ranges within its waters and
its harvest is controlled exclusively by the Iranians.</TE>

<HD>Adoption Rises to Record Levels</HD>
<DH>Family: County reaches out to more parents, especially
Latinos, to join the foster-care program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A record 105 children were adopted last year in Ventura County,
nearly double the 55 adopted in 2000 and 56 the previous year.</LD>
<LD>   The increase was attributed to efforts by county social workers to
encourage more foster parenting and subsequent adoption, combined
with a change in federal adoption laws that has contributed to a rise
nationwide, said Linda Henderson, deputy director of the county's
Children and Family Services Department.</LD>
<LD>   A total of 18,000 more children were adopted across the country in
2001 than the previous year, said officials, who credit the federal
Adoption and Safe Family Act of 1997 with making it easier for
agencies to move children from foster care to permanent adoption.</LD>
<TE>   In Ventura County, the department is reaching out to parents,
especially Latinos, to encourage them to become licensed foster
parents, the first step in adoption, said Robin Heins, lead social
worker with the county agency. Nearly 52% of the 885 children in
foster care in Ventura County are of Latino descent, but only 8% of
foster families are Latino, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going in to small neighborhood communities and asking
people to take care of the children in their communities, to
literally take care of the kids on their own blocks," Henderson said.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, Ventura County residents seem to be more willing
than in years past to adopt children with special needs, which covers
a majority of adoptable kids, Heins said. Any child over the age of 3
falls into this category, as well as ethnic minorities, those with
physical disabilities or children whose biological parents are drug
addicts.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the credit has to go to the public and people adopting,"
Heins said. "Seven years ago, people came in wanting to adopt infant
Anglo kids with no health problems. But now they're more aware about
the kinds of children we have. They're savvy. They know a 4-year-old
needs a loving family just as much as a newborn does."</TE>
<TE>   The county has also been more aggressive in informing foster
parents about state financial assistance available to those who adopt
special needs children, including siblings and older children, Heins
said. The payments are available until the child reaches age 18 and
can cover such necessities as transportation to medical appointments.
"Once they go into adoption-land, parents need financial assistance,"
Heins said.</TE>
<TE>   Another change making it easier for families to adopt is the
portion of the 1997 federal law that limits the amount of time
biological parents can take to regain custody of their children in
foster care.</TE>
<TE>   When a child younger than 3 enters foster care, parents have six
months to overcome the problem that led them to lose custody, such as
drug or alcohol abuse. Children older than 3 have to wait one year
before a judge may legally sever the bond with their birth parents.
Previously, the waiting period was up to 18 months for all children.
In an effort to get children into permanent homes more quickly, the
county uses a process that allows social workers to develop an
adoption plan for each child in case reunification with the birth
family does not work out, Henderson said.</TE>
<TE>   "When we pick up a child out of a home, the emergency response
worker who makes the initial pickup begins to plan not only what's
going to happen next but what's going to happen two years from now
for this child," Henderson said.</TE>

<HD>Bridges Are Roadblocks for L.A. River Bikeway</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Concrete abutments prevent passage at several
points. Cyclist-friendly changes sought as part of city
rehabilitation project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whooshing past sycamore trees, flowing water and an occasional great
blue heron perched majestically on a rock, Jim Hanson pedaled and
pedaled as his bicycle glided in a streak through Silver Lake, past
Los Feliz and up into Griffith Park on the Los Angeles River Bikeway.</LD>
<LD>   But the Echo Park resident stopped abruptly when he neared the
edge of the San Fernando Valley on the north side of the park, where
this stretch of the proposed 52-mile bike path ends. Looking left and
right, the 46-year-old Web developer eased his bike into street
traffic as cars whizzed past.</LD>
<LD>   "It's my dream," Hanson said, "to see [the bikeway] go all the
way."</LD>
<TE>   For recreational cyclists and pedaling commuters like Hanson,
dreams of riding uninterrupted along the meandering river--from Long
Beach through downtown, traversing the Sepulveda Basin all the way to
Canoga Park--remain elusive. Among the roadblocks are many of the 41
bridges spanning the river as it courses through the San Fernando
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Although the bridges have long connected communities, they are now
viewed as obstacles to a future bike path because their vertical
bottoms stop at  the river's concrete-lined edge, leaving no room for
bike traffic to pass underneath.</TE>
<TE>   With a bridge-rehabilitation project underway across Los Angeles,
city officials and cycling advocates have joined forces to urge that
any improvement work also accommodate room for a bikeway.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're saying is, when you redo this bridge, give us some
space underneath," said Ron Milam, executive director of the Los
Angeles County Bicycle Coalition. "Why not cut a hole so a bike path
could go through it?"</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, a stretch of the river wiggling through Studio
City. Flanked by stately eucalyptus trees and far from the din of
busy streets, the wide banks on each side of the water would be ideal
for riding, cyclists say.</TE>
<TE>   But at several points, the riverbanks run into concrete abutments
that support a bridge. The only way a cyclist or pedestrian can go
around is to climb over the bridges through traffic.</TE>
<TE>   A pending Los Angeles City Council motion notes that "this vast
bikeway cannot be possible without bridge underpasses.... If the
bridge retrofit projects move forward without incorporating bikeway
needs, it will effectively kill the bikeway through the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   The motion directs the city's Department of Transportation and the
Department of Public Works' Bureau of Engineering to study ways to
accommodate the river bikeway as they rehabilitate the Valley's aging
bridges.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the city's transportation planners and engineers are "going
back and looking at the bridges to see which ones need redesign" to
help incorporate the bikeway, said Councilwoman Wendy Greuel, a
co-sponsor of the motion.</TE>
<TE>   Peter See, the city's bridge project manager, said his staff
supports the bikeway, but their work depends on funding.</TE>
<TE>   Funding has been secured to accommodate the bikeway under certain
bridges, such as those at Vanowen Street and Tampa Avenue in the
Valley, but not others, such as the one at Fulton Avenue, said John
Koo, another project manager. Unless funds are allocated, Koo said,
plans to widen the Fulton bridge will proceed without incorporating
room for the bikeway.</TE>
<TE>   Bureau staff will present a report to council members next month
outlining alternatives and costs.</TE>
<TE>   The price tag for the river bike path--which some call a "bicycle
freeway" because of its overhead lighting--runs about $1 million per
mile if the path is clear. Obstacles like bridges further inflate
costs. Tunneling a bikeway underpass through an abutment can cost as
much as $500,000, engineers say.</TE>
<TE>   A recently opened bicycle bridge--which allowed reclining cyclist
Hanson to travel in a graceful arc over the automobile traffic below
on Los Feliz Boulevard--cost $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing is impossible. If you throw enough money at it, you can
build anything," said Michelle Mowery, the bicycle coordinator for
the city's Department of Transportation. "The truth is, we have a
very small pot of money."</TE>
<TE>   Completion of the bikeway faces additional challenges when
engineers extend it further south into downtown Los Angeles, where it
will encounter a tangle of freeways, rail lines and utility
corridors. There are no official estimates on how much it would cost
or how long it might take to complete the 30 or so more miles of the
bikeway.</TE>
<TE>   Still, advocates remain hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   Progress has been made in the last few years, they say. Some parts
of the bikeway are in place. Another segment from Fletcher Drive in
Silver Lake to Barclay Street in Elysian Park is in the design phase.</TE>
<TE>   To extend the bikeway into the Valley, the city plans to apply to
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which has already provided
$11.5 million for the project over the last several years.</TE>
<TE>   And as the bikeway has grown, so has public awareness and support,
city officials say. The city's master bicycle plan to coax commuters
to stop driving and start pedaling is part of a larger effort to
revitalize the L.A. River and transform its banks into park-like
grounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a Central Park in Los Angeles. The River Greenway
and the commuter bikeway can do that for us," said Melanie Winter,
director of the River Project, a nonprofit group. "The river is one
thing besides freeways that connects communities in L.A."</TE>

<HD>Service Cuts to Begin at 2 County Health Clinics</HD>
<DH>Facilities: Walk-in services will end in North Hollywood
and Tujunga as the closing of 15 centers gets started.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The shuttering of 15 county health centers is scheduled to begin
Friday, a little more than a week after the Los Angeles County Board
of Supervisors approved the closures.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning Friday, walk-in services will no longer be available at
two clinics, the North Hollywood Health Center and the Tujunga Health
Center. Those are the first in a rolling schedule of service
reductions that, by Oct. 1, are to close clinics from Pacoima to
Norwalk.</LD>
<LD>   In the interim, there is much to do at the 11 clinics and four
school-based health centers slated for closing--from informing
patients of the shutdowns and transferring records to coordinating
patients' future medical care and moving the furniture.</LD>
<TE>   County officials have said that patients will be referred to other
facilities, and that county nurses and doctors will be transferred to
other sites.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the closings could prove a logistical nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the clinics that are closing logged 238,000 visits,
said John Wallace, a spokesman for the county Department of Health
Services. He said 17,359 patients will have to seek medical services
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just going to be difficult," said Julie Frederick-Mairs, an
administrator for two health centers slated for closing, in Pico
Rivera and Bell Gardens.</TE>
<TE>   Frederick-Mairs said there is a "very detailed procedure" for the
closings that is intended to minimize inconvenience for affected
patients, but she said that some problems are inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always someone out there who won't get the message, some
poor guy who will show up three weeks [after the closings] and wonder
what happened," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ernest Espinoza is the acting administrator of the Coastal Cluster
Health Center, which includes the Norwalk Health Center, which is
closing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty sad move for the staff and the patients because a
lot of relationships have been built between them," Espinoza said.
"It's unfortunate, because community-based primary care has proved to
be the right thing in so many cases."</TE>
<TE>   The board voted on Tuesday to close the clinics, which provide
primary care, to address a looming budget deficit. The county will
continue to operate seven primary-care clinics, though supervisors
have warned that more could close in October if new funds are not
made available.</TE>
<TE>   Patients will be directed to the remaining clinics, to public
health centers that are equipped to deal only with communicable
diseases, or to hospital emergency rooms, according to county
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a money issue," Frederick-Mairs said. "You don't have to
want to do it, you don't even have to like to do it. You just have to
do it, because it's your responsibility."</TE>

<HD>Coaches Need Training Too, With Civility Added</HD>
<DH>Sports: Ugliness on the high school field sparks classes to
keep winning from being everything.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an attempt to control win-at-all-costs coaches given to vulgar
language and poor sportsmanship, a south Orange County school
district is offering classes in civility.</LD>
<LD>   The "Pursuing Victory With Honor" class is part of a three-day
academy designed to steel Capistrano Unified School District coaches
for the pressures, responsibilities and liabilities that come with
the job. Other classes in the academy range from legal issues on the
playing field to detecting performance-enhancing drug use.</LD>
<LD>   The idea for the etiquette class, which has been offered to
district coaches seven times since December, has caught on at schools
around the state as administrators and athletic directors do battle
against boorishness.</LD>
<TE>   Coaching principles are covered in classes within the Los Angeles
Unified School District, where officials are seeking more funds so
the scope can be expanded to include sportsmanship. In the
Newport-Mesa Unified School District, a neighbor of the Capistrano
district, a class dealing strictly with sportsmanship is about a year
old.</TE>
<TE>   "High school sports cannot just be about the final score," said
Roger Blake, assistant executive director for the California
Interscholastic Federation, which oversees all high school sports in
the state. "We have to remind these people that the name "Coach"
equals "Teacher." We do not accept disrespectful behavior and
inappropriate language in a math class, so why is it acceptable in
the gymnasium or on the football field?"</TE>
<TE>   Tom White, Capistrano Unified's athletic director, kick-started
the drive to teach and reinforce sportsmanship after witnessing
dozens of ugly incidents on the field.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the best learning experiences were being overshadowed
because coaches, players and parents were losing their perspective,"
said White, a former athletic director and track coach at Capistrano
Valley High. "It was difficult to see a lot of the good in high
school athletics."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the visible flare-up of the enraged coach or the parent who
gets into a fistfight, White and others say, they are concerned about
the overall climate of the playing field.</TE>
<TE>   During Tuesday's class at San Clemente High, a Capistrano district
school, most coaches agreed that many in their field have forgotten
the true meaning of sports. They exchanged stories and talked about
the latest displays of less-than-dignified behavior in professional
sports and even the ongoing Little League World Series.</TE>
<TE>   The class is free-form to a degree. Coaches participate in group
discussions, going over examples of acceptable behavior and coming up
with a definition of good sportsmanship. They are lectured on the
virtues of "doing the right thing." And, finally, they are given a
sportsmanship handbook.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the school district appears to be coming down harder on
coaches who disrespect their players. In the past school year, a
coach was disciplined for abusive language. That coach has since
taken the class.</TE>
<TE>   Athletes and parents in Capistrano Unified will also be held more
accountable for their actions. Starting this school year, coaches,
athletes and parents will sign a code-of-conduct form emphasizing six
pillars of character: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility,
fairness, caring and citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Spectators are also being watched. The South Coast League,
composed mostly of Capistrano Unified schools, is instituting a
strict policy to deal with unruly fans.</TE>
<TE>   But the emphasis is indeed on coaches and their behavior, White
says. Since last year, the three-hour class has been optional for
coaches. But the course might soon become mandatory. The
superintendent is expected to make such a recommendation to the
school board by March.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Newport-Mesa district's sportsmanship class, which is
required of all coaches, district officials said the move was sparked
not by any major incidents but an accumulation of complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "There were rumblings of parents out of control, trash-talking at
basketball and football games by players and coaches not treating
students humanely," said Mike Murphy, Newport-Mesa's student services
director. "A lot of those calls go to the board members, so they were
all behind it."</TE>
<TE>   An attempt to make the Victory with Honor classes mandatory for
all coaches in the six-school South Coast League failed when some
schools balked. White hopes every Orange County coach will take the
class before stepping onto the field.</TE>
<TE>   "If we've got people from Fountain Valley, Trabuco Hills and
Garden Grove all talking the same language, it could be very
powerful," White said.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Nedler, a girls' basketball coach at Aliso Niguel High,
another Capistrano district school, said the class objectives are
worthy--especially now.</TE>
<TE>   "This winning-is-everything mentality permeates our society,"
Nedler said. "Look at what's happening at Arthur Anderson and Enron.
We need to start looking at what's right and wrong, not what gives us
the most success."</TE>
<TE>   Nedler said the class didn't necessarily enlighten him, but it
reinforced his belief system. Last year, that system was tested when
six of his players admitted drinking during a road trip. Though a
critical late-season game loomed, Nedler suspended the players.</TE>
<TE>   His team lost the game, costing the school a playoff berth. Though
painful, Nedler said, the decision taught his players a lesson.</TE>

<HD>Charitable Group Keeps Its Giving Simple</HD>
<DH>The annual dues of $5,000 per member go almost entirely to
one children's cause each year, minus 6% for operational costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In two years, a group of Southern California women has donated more
than half a million dollars to local charities.</LD>
<LD>   And it's been done without a single fund-raising dinner, without a
request that anyone else donate.</LD>
<LD>   The group's leader, Jacqueline Caster, said she has found a simple
way to help the less fortunate: She and 126 other women simply crack
open their checkbooks at the end of the year and pay membership dues
of $5,000 each to the EveryChild Foundation.</LD>
<TE>   Then nearly all of the money goes to one nonprofit group.</TE>
<TE>   It's a novel approach to giving back to the community, Caster said
recently from her Pacific Palisades home. Women who are interested in
helping children without having to deal with the extra stuff that
normally goes into philanthropy can do just that, she said.</TE>
<TE>   And by pooling their money to aid one charity, the women are able
to have a significant, visible effect.</TE>
<TE>   EveryChild awarded its 2000 grant to QueensCare, which used the
$230,000 to put together a mobile dental office. The facility serves
children from lower-income families who wouldn't otherwise visit a
dentist.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, with more dues-paying members, EveryChild awarded
$385,000 to the Wonder of Reading to create libraries at Los
Angeles-area elementary schools. The second library opened Aug. 9 at
Union Avenue Elementary School near downtown.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the group added even more members to its rolls and
expects to hand out more than $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Caster said that, at this rate, she expects EveryChild to be
handing out more than $1 million in just a couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   The members might vote then on whether to offer two awards instead
of one.</TE>
<TE>   All of the awards go to a children's charity to implement a new
program or to fund a project that the charity wouldn't be able to
establish otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   EveryChild grants cannot go toward regular operating expenses,
Caster said. Each project must help children facing disease, abuse,
neglect, poverty or disability, all part of EveryChild's mission
statement.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to feel like we've made a really substantial
difference," Caster said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we made a lot of little grants, it would be harder to monitor.
When we make one large grant, we can really impact one of those
needs."</TE>
<TE>   That's been the case with the Wonder of Reading grant, which will
fund 15 libraries in four years. It costs a minimum of $45,000 to
convert an existing classroom into a library, said Beth Michelson,
the director of Wonder of Reading.</TE>
<TE>   The grant pays for shelving and 10,000 books. Because there isn't
money for full-time librarians in the Los Angeles Unified School
District budget, trained aides will staff the libraries five days a
week.</TE>
<TE>   "This grant really helps us to go much further than we would have
been without it," Michelson said. The EveryChild grant was the
largest donation the organization has ever received.</TE>
<TE>   "Reading is the basic foundation of all learning," said Union
Avenue Vice Principal Fernando Cajero. "Our students deserve a big
and wonderful library that allows them to enjoy the wonderful world
of books at all times."</TE>
<TE>   The EveryChild approach was born partly out of Caster's
frustration with the usual fund-raising routine.</TE>
<TE>   She had grown tired of traditional benefit dinners that were
difficult to sell out, left organizers exhausted and reaped little
gain in relation to the effort involved.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard
University and the Boston University School of Law, Caster had tried
two careers, but found fulfillment in taking care of her family: her
husband, Andrew, and their two children.</TE>
<TE>   When the children were ready to begin school, she stopped working
outside the home and spent her days taking care of the household, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   One afternoon, while she soaked in a tub, the idea for EveryChild
hit her. She dressed quickly, then ran across the street to her
neighbor's house.</TE>
<TE>   In less than a day, Caster, 45, had assembled a board of
directors.</TE>
<TE>   Caster still runs the organization out of a post office box and
her home office. Aside from a consultant, EveryChild has no paid
staff. Caster said about 6% of the money raised covers operational
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia Alexander, one of the founding members, said Caster's idea
immediately struck a chord.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that I didn't want to go back to the kind of work that I'd
done before," said Alexander, 52, who previously worked as a project
manager for a marketing communications company. After having her
children--now 10 and 12 years old, Alexander had become a full-time
homemaker.</TE>
<TE>   When Caster knocked on her door that day with the idea for the
foundation, Alexander said, she knew she wanted to be involved.
"Partly I felt that I wanted to do something that really gave back to
the community and produced some kind of good results for the people
around me."</TE>
<TE>   The women incorporated EveryChild as a nonprofit organization and
hired the consultant to help them screen grant applicants.</TE>
<TE>   The consultant is paid $40,000 a year, EveryChild's largest
operating expenditure, Caster said.</TE>
<TE>   Membership grew mainly through word of mouth, Caster said. Every
member has an equal vote at the end of the year to decide who will be
awarded the next grant.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I can, so why not do it," said Caster of running
EveryChild. "I have the time, I have the means and I have the
organizational skills. I can't think of a better use of my time."</TE>

<LD>   Charlie Benitez was taken to UCI Medical Center with major head
injuries after the 6:40 p.m. accident in front of his house on Slater
Avenue just west of Jacquelyn Lane. According to police, the boy
apparently rode a big-wheel toy into the street in front of the car.</LD>
<LD>   "We have no description of the driver or the vehicle," said Lt.
Lloyd Edwards, a spokesman for the Huntington Beach Police
Department. "We have no witnesses."</LD>
<TE>   Anyone with information on the accident is asked to call the

<HD>Emergency Plan Would Allow State Payments</HD>
<DH>Budget: Legislators compromise in an effort to satisfy
thousands of claims. Davis prefers maintaining pressure on lawmakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO and JON ORTIZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Two months into a budget stalemate, California lawmakers began
crafting emergency legislation Saturday that would allow the state
government to make numerous payments without a spending plan.</LD>
<LD>   However, Gov. Gray Davis indicated earlier that he does not favor
such a measure, saying he believes it would ease pressure on
lawmakers to approve the overdue budget and leave the final decision
on the legislation in doubt.</LD>
<LD>   "The solution to the problem is to break the budget impasse, not
break the budget up into little pieces," the Democratic governor said
in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   The Senate approved a $99.1-billion budget plan on time in June.
However, Republicans in the Assembly have refused to supply the four
votes needed there for two-thirds approval. That margin is necessary
for passage because the measure contains more than $3.7 billion in
tax increases. Democrats, meanwhile, have refused the GOP's calls to
cut spending instead of raising taxes, saying the budget already
contains deep cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the budget stalemate has prevented payment of
nearly 384,000 claims totaling $116 million to elderly, blind and
disabled Californians who participate in a program of assistance for
homeowners and renters.</TE>
<TE>   The payments, which average about $302, usually go out in July or
August after a new state budget is approved. By law, the budget is
due each July 1.</TE>
<TE>   GOP lawmakers led by Assemblyman John Campbell of Irvine initially
brought forward limited legislation Saturday to make payments to a
smaller group of state vendors, and only through the middle of
September.</TE>
<TE>   "We in fact want to continue payments to people who need them,"
said Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   But the majority Democrats, led by Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh of
Los Angeles, intervened with amendments that made the bill, SB 676,
much broader, allowing the state to make ongoing payments to nearly
everyone as called for in the last budget.</TE>
<TE>   "They offer a broader vision of caring for Californians,"
Firebaugh said of his changes, noting that they allow for payments
for services to children and the disabled.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats' move touched off a raucous partisan debate on the
Assembly floor, but ultimately a bipartisan majority approved the
Firebaugh version on a 59-6 vote and sent it to the Assembly Budget
Committee for further discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the complaints of some GOP legislators, one group
was expressly excluded from being paid: legislators themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, no lawmakers appeared happy with the measure. Many
declared that they hoped to resolve the full budget problem soon,
instead. "We are going down the road of complacency, members," said
GOP Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy of Arcadia, who did not vote for the
measure because it would allow for continued funding for abortions,
which he opposes. "There is no endgame."</TE>
<TE>   In other action, the Assembly approved a measure that would bar
employers from forcing employees to take discrimination claims to
arbitration instead of court. The measure by Senate President Pro Tem
John Burton (D-San Francisco) passed on a 44-27 vote and now awaits
final passage in the Senate.</TE>

<HD>An 'Irrelevant' Library Leaves City Unserved</HD>
<DH>Literacy: Just 10% of Santa Ana system's books are in
Spanish, which most residents speak. Officials point to scarce
resources.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Santa Ana's public library invited best-selling mystery writer
T. Jefferson Parker to speak several years ago, fewer than a dozen
people showed up. An appearance by Mexican television anchor and
author Jorge Ramos at a Latino bookstore downtown last October drew
3,000.A growing number of critics--ranging from educators and
businesspeople to library experts--say the comparison shows that
Santa Ana's library system is out of touch with residents in a city
deemed the most Spanish-speaking of its size in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   In a community where 74% of residents speak Spanish, the library's
Spanish-language book collection comprises only 10% of the books in
its three branches. Other cities with large Latino populations devote
as much as half of their collection to books in Spanish, some entire
branches.</LD>
<LD>   "Santa Ana is probably one of the worst cases in California" when
it comes to serving its residents, said Elizabeth Martinez, former
executive director of the American Library Assn.</LD>
<TE>   The city's librarians "accepted the mantra that they can't do
anything," said Martinez, a UCLA library science professor from
Newport Beach who is among several librarians who have monitored the
Santa Ana library for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Richard, library director since 1986, doesn't disagree. "The
library got fat, dumb and happy," he said. "It became irrelevant to
the residents, so the [city] council never heard what it needed."</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the small collection of materials in Spanish is part
of a broader problem with funding of Santa Ana's library.</TE>
<TE>   It ranks 142nd of the 178 library systems in California in
per-capita spending. The library spends less per year on each city
resident--$12.51--than the cost of a bestseller.</TE>
<TE>   Library officials say they are doing the best they can given their
resources. But even after the city two years ago increased the
library's acquisition budget, only 17% of the book budget, about
$80,000, was spent on Spanish-language books this year.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, literacy advocates including Martinez--who has helped
libraries around the state develop programs for Latino patrons--say
Santa Ana could seek money from foundations and corporations to
improve its service to Latino residents, many of whom are poor and
largely uneducated immigrants from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin
America.</TE>
<TE>   Rueben Martinez of Martinez Books and Art Gallery, a Santa Ana
bookstore with a large Spanish-language collection, said the library
and its employees show little sense of excitement about books, which
is evident to people he has sent there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not so much the fact that the library doesn't have the books
they should," said Martinez, whose store hosted the overflow crowd
for Jorge Ramos. "No one makes you feel at home. You don't feel like
it's your library."</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro Moreno, a social worker who has helped unite troubled
families, says the library doesn't offer enough to recommend it as an
activity for his clients, as he used to do. "We don't feel welcome in
the libraries anymore," he said. "There is nothing for us."</TE>
<TE>   "The library often doesn't have what I'm looking for--it's out,
it's lost, it's just not there," said Ana Maria Salas, 45, an
immigrant who was a schoolteacher in Mexico. Instead, she shares
books she buys from Martinez with her friends.</TE>
<TE>   Libraries are not required to offer books in foreign languages,
but many do because they want to foster literacy.</TE>
<TE>   The American Library Assn. advocates that libraries serve
communities no matter what their dominant language. The association's
bill of rights stresses that encouraging literacy serves a public
good. "We are supposed to serve everyone and provide services without
barriers--be they fees or languages," said Maurice J. Freedman, the
organization's current president.</TE>
<TE>   Freedman noted that free public libraries were established in the
1850s--in great part to help immigrants become more literate and more
productive in their communities. Even then, collections included
newspapers in other languages, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone in Santa Ana city government believes the city should
supply Spanish-language texts or boost library participation.</TE>
<TE>   "I would question whether it is the city's duty to provide
materials that mirror the demographics of the city," said City
Councilman Jose Solorio, son of migrant farm workers who has a
master's degree from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of
Government. "If we go to another country, should we expect to see
books in English?"</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Alberta D. Christy, a bank consultant, said the city
has increased the library system's budget "as much as we possibly
can." She said that in the age of the Internet, fewer books are
needed, even for small children.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are 3 or 4 years old, you go on the Internet to Nickjr.com
[and] you have stories there. It's teaching them to read the words
and hear the stories," Christy said.</TE>
<TE>   Cities such as Miami and Los Angeles have tried harder to reach
out to Latino communities. In Kansas City, Mo., more than 50% of the
books in some library branches are in Spanish. In San Jose, an entire
branch is devoted to Spanish-language books and materials. Librarians
there hope to raise money by serving coffees from Latin America and
pan dulce.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana's libraries are concentrated near downtown and the
western edge that borders Garden Grove, but there are none in the
more heavily Latino southern part of the city. Richard dreams of
opening another branch, but says that would be nearly impossible; he
would need $4 million, plus land in a built-out city.</TE>
<TE>   Because of a budget constraints, Richard said he has "written off"
adults in favor of promoting youth programs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to change adult habits, but if we can get
kids off to a good start, we can make them lifelong readers," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana library's greatest successes have been with youth. .
This year, library officials say, children made 30,000 visits to a
reading club and 50,000 to a homework program at the branches. The
library also offered a math club, a Spanish-language story time, even
a recent teen pizza party. There are more Spanish-language story
times in Santa Ana than any library in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Free story times, puppet shows and movies rotate among the
branches about five days a week. Two bookmobiles travel to
neighborhoods far from the branches. One vehicle allows librarians to
read stories under an awning outside and even show a video on the
side of the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, some Latino parents interviewed say the offerings are
limited. "There isn't much here in Spanish, but we are happy to find
anything to help our children," said Marisol Jimenez, who had her
three children--4, 2 and 1--in tow on a recent trip to the city's
central branch. "We'd like more books in Spanish for children. You
want to read to them so they get ahead, and we [parents] can't read
enough English."</TE>
<TE>   Heninger Elementary School Principal Kathy Sabine said more
Spanish and bilingual books would help parents who speak little
English to read to their children. In addition, students learning
English can increase their literacy by reading in their native
language.</TE>
<TE>   Brooke Stewart, recently appointed library board president, who
successfully lobbied the council for more funds, agrees that more
needs to be done, and said she hopes to convince city officials, who
juggle a variety of demands for funds.</TE>
<TE>   "For years and years, the library board didn't seem to do much,"
Stewart said. "I started wondering if all we were supposed to do was
approve minutes.... I think we are seeing that if we make noise, we
can get something done."</TE>

<HD>Port Hueneme Lighthouse Leaves Tourists Beaming</HD>
<DH>Sightseeing: Coast Guard opens structure to the public,
delighting aficionados of old seaside beacons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nick Korstad had dragged his brother and his brother's girlfriend to
nearly two dozen lighthouses on their meandering trip down the coast
from Portland, Ore., to Los Angeles. By the time they reached Port
Hueneme, his traveling buddies had enjoyed about all the lighthouses
they could stand.</LD>
<LD>   But Korstad, a 21-year-old college student, was still
enthusiastic--particularly because he was among the first waves of
lighthouse fanciers allowed into Port Hueneme's previously off-limits
tower. A lighthouse has been there since 1874, but the Coast Guard
opened it to the public only last month.</LD>
<LD>   High up in a domed chamber called the lantern room, Korstad looked
out at pelicans skimming the water and tugs guiding in the Sea Pearl,
a freighter hauling tons of wood pulp from Brazil. Inches away, the
lighthouse beam brushed across his face as it scanned the horizon.</LD>
<TE>   "I recommend Hueneme," he said. "I'm so surprised they let people
all the way up to the top. At most lighthouses, they don't."</TE>
<TE>   At the far end of the highly restricted port, the lighthouse is
open only on the third Saturday of each month. Tourists park in a lot
just beyond the port's guardhouse and are taken to the tower in a
Coast Guard van.</TE>
<TE>   It looks nothing like the picturesque beacons on New England
calendars. At 48 feet tall, it's dwarfed by the smokestacks of
vessels chugging into the Port of Hueneme, the only deep-water harbor
between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Set on an asphalt lot, the
lighthouse looks like a California mission on a low-fat diet, built
along the hard, stark lines of an architectural style called Art
Moderne.</TE>
<TE>   But it's still a lighthouse, and there is a growing breed of
people who are crazy about lighthouses. Some build vacations around
them, signing on for lighthouse tours from Maine to Macao. Others
settle for weekend jaunts to working facilities like Port Hueneme's.</TE>
<TE>   For Wayne Wheeler, head of the San Francisco-based U.S. Lighthouse
Society, the beacons are the stuff of poetry.</TE>
<TE>   "You're out there with the lap of the wave and the caw of the
gull," said Wheeler, a former Coast Guardsman who founded the society
in 1984. "Lighthouses were the last thing the sailor saw when he left
terra firma, and the first thing he saw coming back. They were a
light against the dark, a hope against the dangerous sea."</TE>
<TE>   At Port Hueneme, aficionados troop up three sets of stairs and a
curved red ladder for an admiring look at the guts of the
operation--the lens.</TE>
<TE>   Most lighthouses have switched to plastic lenses. But Port Hueneme
still uses an exquisitely beveled, brass-encased set of glass prisms
called a Fresnel lens. About the size and shape of Darth Vader's face
mask, it's 105 years old and would be a museum piece if it weren't a
constant guide for banana boats, oil freighters and Sunday sailors.</TE>
<TE>   Designed by a Frenchman named Augustin Fresnel, such lenses are
still known for their beauty, complexity and dazzling efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   "Making them is a lost art," said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer
John R. Hurst, who is responsible for overseeing 11 lighthouses, 20
foghorns and 144 beacons from San Diego to Monterey. "To this day, no
one has come up with a better way of concentrating diffused light
into a focused beam."</TE>
<TE>   On the California coast there are 28 active lighthouses, each with
a distinct signal noted on navigators' charts. Originally fueled by
whale oil, Hueneme's light flashes white once every 30 seconds.
Visible for 22 miles out at sea, it's essential for boaters without
fancy navigational devices and a welcome backup for skippers whose
satellite-based systems may be balky, Hurst said.</TE>
<TE>   The first lighthouse at Hueneme was built in 1874. A rambling
Victorian home flanked by ornate sun porches, it was closed and sent
across the harbor by barge in 1941--the same year the current,
simpler structure opened. Used as a yacht club headquarters for a
while, the original structure was razed after years of decay. The
lens from the old structure was placed in the new one.</TE>
<TE>   The lighthouse was automated in 1972, ending a century of on-site
lighthouse keepers. Crews would come by to tend the mechanism, but
the building's paint peeled and its fixtures rusted. Finally deciding
to preserve the building, the Coast Guard authorized a $250,000
face-lift completed last year to make the tower ready for visitors.</TE>
<TE>   They are greeted these days by a Pasadena couple--Kim Castrobran
and his fiancee, Rose Ambicki. The two joined the Coast Guard
Auxiliary just to care for the lighthouse.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a lighthouse nut by osmosis," Castrobran said, pointing out
that his father spends his free time tending the one at Point Vicente
in Rancho Palos Verdes.</TE>
<TE>   Port Hueneme's "is a work in progress," he said, looking over the
old photos of the tower recently mounted on the walls and the old
lighthouse gear recently put on display. "The most surprising thing
is that so many people don't even know it exists."</TE>
<TE>   LaVerne Dornberger isn't one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Now 81 years old and living on Vashon Island, Wash., she was a
lighthouse keeper's daughter, living at Port Hueneme from 1927 to
1942.</TE>
<TE>   As a girl, she played on an empty beach and read by the light of
kerosene lamps. She remembers wind and fog and open fields.</TE>
<TE>   "We could hear the rum-runners going by," she said. "One day my
friend and I found the whole beach covered with bottles that had
washed up. We buried them, but after the tide came in we couldn't
find them again."</TE>
<TE>   She moved away when she was 21. She had married a sailor in the
Merchant Marine, a man she met when he was a student at the maritime
academy across the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, she came by to visit her girlhood home.</TE>
<TE>   "They wouldn't let us in," said Dornberger, a retired ferry boat
cook. "They told us it was a restricted area."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the light shines in her memories.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was lonely, I never realized it," she said. "It was a
wonderful place to grow up."</TE>
<TE>   The Port Hueneme lighthouse is open free the third Saturday of
each month from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. For more information, call (310)
732-7310. The Point Vicente lighthouse, the only other active one
available for tours in the Los Angeles area, is open free on the
second Saturday of each month from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. For more
information, call (310) 541-0334.</TE>

<LD>Nick Korstad had dragged his brother and his brother's girlfriend to
nearly two dozen lighthouses on their meandering trip down the coast
from Portland, Ore., to Los Angeles. By the time they reached Port
Hueneme, his traveling buddies had enjoyed about all the lighthouses
they could stand.</LD>
<LD>   But Korstad, a 21-year-old college student, was still
enthusiastic--particularly because he was among the first waves of
lighthouse fanciers allowed into Port Hueneme's previously off-limits
tower. A lighthouse has been there since 1874, but the Coast Guard
opened it to the public only last month.</LD>
<LD>   High up in a domed chamber called the lantern room, Korstad looked
out at pelicans skimming the water and tugs guiding in the Sea Pearl,
a freighter hauling tons of wood pulp from Brazil. Inches away, the
lighthouse beam brushed across his face as it scanned the horizon.</LD>
<TE>   "I recommend Hueneme," he said. "I'm so surprised they let people
all the way up to the top. At most lighthouses, they don't."</TE>
<TE>   At the far end of the highly restricted port, the lighthouse is
open only on the third Saturday of each month. Tourists park in a lot
just beyond the port's guardhouse and are taken to the tower in a
Coast Guard van.</TE>
<TE>   It looks nothing like the picturesque beacons on New England
calendars. At 48 feet tall, it's dwarfed by the smokestacks of
vessels chugging into the Port of Hueneme, the only deep-water harbor
between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Set on an asphalt lot, the
lighthouse looks like a California mission on a low-fat diet, built
along the hard, stark lines of an architectural style called Art
Moderne.</TE>
<TE>   But it's still a lighthouse, and there is a growing breed of
people who are crazy about lighthouses. Some build vacations around
them, signing on for lighthouse tours from Maine to Macao. Others
settle for weekend jaunts to working facilities like Port Hueneme's.</TE>
<TE>   For Wayne Wheeler, head of the San Francisco-based U.S. Lighthouse
Society, the beacons are the stuff of poetry.</TE>
<TE>   "You're out there with the lap of the wave and the caw of the
gull," said Wheeler, a former Coast Guardsman who founded the society
in 1984. "Lighthouses were the last thing the sailor saw when he left
terra firma, and the first thing he saw coming back. They were a
light against the dark, a hope against the dangerous sea."</TE>
<TE>   At Port Hueneme, aficionados troop up three sets of stairs and a
curved red ladder for an admiring look at the guts of the
operation--the lens.</TE>
<TE>   Most lighthouses have switched to plastic lenses. But Port Hueneme
still uses an exquisitely beveled, brass-encased set of glass prisms
called a Fresnel lens. About the size and shape of Darth Vader's face
mask, it's 105 years old and would be a museum piece if it weren't a
constant guide for banana boats, oil freighters and Sunday sailors.</TE>
<TE>   Designed by a Frenchman named Augustin Fresnel, such lenses are
still known for their beauty, complexity and dazzling efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   "Making them is a lost art," said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer
John R. Hurst, who is responsible for overseeing 11 lighthouses, 20
foghorns and 144 beacons from San Diego to Monterey. "To this day, no
one has come up with a better way of concentrating diffused light
into a focused beam."</TE>
<TE>   On the California coast there are 28 active lighthouses, each with
a distinct signal noted on navigators' charts. Originally fueled by
whale oil, Hueneme's light flashes white once every 30 seconds.
Visible for 22 miles out at sea, it's essential for boaters without
fancy navigational devices and a welcome backup for skippers whose
satellite-based systems may be balky, Hurst said.</TE>
<TE>   The first lighthouse at Hueneme was built in 1874. A rambling
Victorian home flanked by ornate sun porches, it was closed and sent
across the harbor by barge in 1941--the same year the current,
simpler structure opened. Used as a yacht club headquarters for a
while, the original structure was razed after years of decay. The
lens from the old structure was placed in the new one.</TE>
<TE>   The lighthouse was automated in 1972, ending a century of on-site
lighthouse keepers. Crews would come by to tend the mechanism, but
the building's paint peeled and its fixtures rusted. Finally deciding
to preserve the building, the Coast Guard authorized a $250,000
face-lift completed last year to make the tower ready for visitors.</TE>
<TE>   They are greeted these days by a Pasadena couple--Kim Castrobran
and his fiancee, Rose Ambicki. The two joined the Coast Guard
Auxiliary just to care for the lighthouse.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a lighthouse nut by osmosis," Castrobran said, pointing out
that his father spends his free time tending the one at Point Vicente
in Rancho Palos Verdes.</TE>
<TE>   Port Hueneme's "is a work in progress," he said, looking over the
old photos of the tower recently mounted on the walls and the old
lighthouse gear recently put on display. "The most surprising thing
is that so many people don't even know it exists."</TE>
<TE>   LaVerne Dornberger isn't one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Now 81 years old and living on Vashon Island, Wash., she was a
lighthouse keeper's daughter, living at Port Hueneme from 1927 to
1942.</TE>
<TE>   As a girl, she played on an empty beach and read by the light of
kerosene lamps. She remembers wind and fog and open fields.</TE>
<TE>   "We could hear the rum-runners going by," she said. "One day my
friend and I found the whole beach covered with bottles that had
washed up. We buried them, but after the tide came in we couldn't
find them again."</TE>
<TE>   She moved away when she was 21. She had married a sailor in the
Merchant Marine, a man she met when he was a student at the maritime
academy across the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, she came by to visit her girlhood home.</TE>
<TE>   "They wouldn't let us in," said Dornberger, a retired ferry boat
cook. "They told us it was a restricted area."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the light shines in her memories. "If I was lonely, I never
realized it," she said. "It was a wonderful place to grow up."</TE>
<TE>   FYI: The Port Hueneme lighthouse is open free the third Saturday
of each month from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. For more information, call (310)
732-7310. Point Vicente, the only other active lighthouse available
for tours in the Los Angeles area, is open free on the second
Saturday of each month from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. For more information,
call (310) 541-0334.</TE>

<HD>Lottery Board Awards Gaming Giant $300-Million Deal for New
Machines</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The California Lottery will get a face-lift in the coming year as
roughly 19,000 decade-old ticket-dispensing machines are replaced in
grocery stores and bars across the state.</LD>
<LD>   Under a contract approved this month by the Lottery Commission,
gaming industry giant GTECH Corp. will install sleek black and purple
machines that promise to work faster, better and more cheaply than
the last generation of terminals.</LD>
<LD>   GTECH was the sole bidder for the last such overhaul in 1992.
Complaints at the time that the lottery had grown too cozy with the
Rhode Island company cost the lottery director her job.</LD>
<TE>   Still smarting nine years later, lottery officials set out to
attract as many bids as they could from an industry with just three
major companies.</TE>
<TE>   They got two, and said they were happy for it.</TE>
<TE>   "We're thrilled," said the lottery's chief deputy director, Dennis
Sequeira. "It's been something hanging over our heads because of the
sensitivity of the contract, but it's really paid off."</TE>
<TE>   GTECH won the contract by bidding a whopping $307 million less
overall than Scientific Games International of Georgia. GTECH's
contract is worth an estimated $300 million over six years.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's only other major supplier of lottery equipment,
Automated Wagering International, chose not to bid.</TE>
<TE>   "No lottery in the United States is getting a lot of bids," said
Michael Huffenberger, lottery consultant for Battelle Memorial
Institute, a nonprofit consulting firm based in Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that easy to enter the business, and there aren't that
many companies in it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The latest GTECH contract not only dramatically undercut its
competitor's bid, it is approximately $45 million a year cheaper than
the Lottery's previous contracts for its gaming and related
telecommunications systems, according to lottery officials.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the lottery has hired one company to install and
maintain the machines that dispense Super Lotto, Daily Three, Fantasy
Five and other game tickets, and other companies to electronically
consolidate the data.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the lottery fashioned a "bundled" contract, so that
GTECH would be responsible for the computers as well as processing
the data, a job now done by Pacific Bell and Verizon.</TE>
<TE>   The new machines, which must all be installed by October 2003, are
smaller. That should please space-conscious store owners, who earn
roughly 6 cents for every dollar spent by Lottery players.</TE>
<TE>   "The obvious difference between the old and the new is
appearance," said Richard Yamadera, manager of the Lottery's Office
of Enterprise Information Technology. "It's the same games being
offered. It comes down to the look and the size of the machine."</TE>
<TE>   With the new machines, the Lottery may some day sell gift cards
worth $10, $25, $50 or $100, an innovation embraced by the Lottery
director, Joan M. Wilson, a former executive with 7-Eleven Inc.
"We're trying to run this like a business," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Business is better than ever. Sales hit a record $2.89 billion
last year with the help of two big Lotto jackpots and appear headed
to match or top that this year, Lottery official Sequeira said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the 17-year-old Lottery generated $1 billion for public
schools. By law, 34% of lottery revenue must go to education.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new contract, GTECH stands to earn between .99% and
1.19% of overall sales, depending on which pricing option the lottery
chooses.</TE>
<TE>   GTECH dominates the U.S. lottery business. In the 38 states with
lotteries, according to Huffenberger, GTECH holds about two-thirds of
the contracts, including those with the highest sales, among them New
York, Massachusetts and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Scientific Games handles the lotteries for Connecticut, Vermont,
Montana and New Hampshire, and has begun bidding on larger
venues--including California.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably did work to California's advantage that Scientific
Games was bidding against GTECH," said Huffenberger, who was hired by
the California Lottery to assess both bids. "Scientific Games has
been known as a very attractive pricer. That may have influenced
GTECH to be even more careful with their pricing."</TE>

<HD>Allen E. Murray, 73; Former Chief Executive of Mobil Corp.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allen E. Murray, the chairman and chief executive of Mobil Corp. from
1985 to 1994, has died. He was 73.</LD>
<LD>   Murray died Aug. 11 of a heart attack in San Diego during a trip
to California, said his son, Allen R. Murray.</LD>
<LD>   Murray, who lived in Syosset, N.Y., assumed control of Mobil when
it was the third-largest company in the nation. He was credited with
refocusing the company, now part of Exxon Mobil Corp., after a string
of investments, including the acquisition of the Montgomery Ward
department store chain.</LD>
<TE>   "He was very hands-on, very street-savvy," said Lucio Noto, who
succeeded Murray as chairman and chief executive in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "If you did something right, he had the courtesy to call and tell
you so, and if you did something not so right, he had the plain sense
to call and let you know about that too," Noto said.</TE>
<TE>   Murray unloaded the department store chain, along with Container
Corp. of America, a paperboard and packaging products company, at a
"very good value to shareholders," Noto said.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, both companies had weak earnings and were
disappointing Mobil's investors.</TE>
<TE>   Raised in New York City, Murray began working as a mailroom clerk
at the New York office of Gulf Oil in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   He left Gulf after being passed over for a training program and
joined the accounting department at Mobil.</TE>
<TE>   Before becoming chairman, Murray negotiated Middle East oil
contracts and ran the unit responsible for Mobil's Indonesian
businesses. He was promoted to president and chief operating officer
in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview that year, Murray said he excelled at a company
where "shrinking violets would have a little difficulty."</TE>
<TE>   As chairman, he spoke out on controversial issues, such as
supporting Arab countries when they came under criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his son, Murray is survived by his wife, Patricia; his
daughters, Marilyn Murray, Eileen Murray, Allison Morris and Ellen
Allen; and 10 grandchildren.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 44-year-old Bellflower man was killed early Saturday when he got
out of his overturned car on the Riverside Freeway, then was struck
by a hit-and-run driver.</LD>
<LD>   The incident occurred at 2:50 a.m. when a car driven by the victim
in the carpool lane became airborne and flipped over on the westbound
onramp from State College Boulevard, CHP officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The driver crawled from the overturned car and was hit by a

<HD>Friend's Spirit Will Propel Newport Paddleboarders in
Catalina Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Keith Munemitsu has added incentive to finish today's 32-mile
Catalina Classic paddleboard race: He's paddling in honor of a friend
who died this month of a rare form of cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Munemitsu and fellow Newport Beach residents Mark Schulein, Jack
Hamilton and Scott Lincoln will be among 80 paddleboarders tackling
the grueling course from Santa Catalina Island to the Manhattan Beach
Pier in tribute to Suzanne Leider, a former Newport resident who died
at age 35 on Aug. 8 after a decade-long battle against synovial
sarcoma.</LD>
<LD>   "You go through this world and you meet people who will always be
there for you," Munemitsu said. "She was one of my very best friends.
Her strength inspired me to live."</LD>
<TE>   When Leider was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma in 1992, she set
out to educate herself on how to live with the illness. But because
sarcomas account for fewer than 1% of new cancer cases each year, it
was difficult for Leider to find information.</TE>
<TE>   So in 1999, she founded the Sarcoma Alliance
(www.sarcomaalliance.com), a nonprofit organization dedicated to
providing support, education and guidance for those with the disease.
To raise funds for the Sarcoma Alliance, Munemitsu founded the Ocean
of Hope Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign members hope to raise at least $250,000 this year for the
alliance by participating in the Catalina Classic, an annual event
for more than 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "This literally changed my life, and it changed my outlook on life
in a sense," Munemitsu said of both his friendship with Leider and
his involvement with the campaign. "We are just humans going through
this world, and for me it personally took a friend's illness and
watching her face her own mortality that made me aware that we all
have to give back."</TE>
<TE>   During past Catalina Classics, Leider would wait at the Manhattan
Beach Pier to greet each of the campaign's paddlers as they came
ashore. Although he will not see Leider's smiling face as he wades
out of the water today, Munemitsu said he knows she will be there in
spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "She told me, 'If I'm not there, I'll definitely be watching from
the best seat in the house,' " Munemitsu said. "She will be there
with us."</TE>

<HD>Groups Rally to Protest Police Brutality</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Flanked by activists from throughout the state, a Los Angeles
anti-police brutality organization rallied Saturday in an Oakland
park to encourage unity against police brutality and injustice.</LD>
<LD>   Groups from Los Angeles, Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco and
other cities met at the Bobby Hutton Park in downtown Oakland. The
17-year-old Hutton, a Black Panther, was killed in 1968 during a
shootout with Oakland police.</LD>
<LD>   Students for Justice in Palestine, the Prison Rights Union and the
United Front were among the groups on a makeshift stage. More than
100 people made up the audience.</LD>
<TE>   "Police are lynching people on a whim for fun and games," said
Linda Luba, a Salvadoran woman who said she was fighting for the
freedom of political prisoners. "So, I have to be here, I have to
stand up and say something."</TE>
<TE>   "People of color get stopped, beaten, shot," said Meg Yarnell, a
white social worker who works in the Oakland public schools. "And
it's important for white people to stand with people of color when
these things happen."</TE>
<TE>   The "Stop Police Brutality Day" rally was organized by the Donovan
Jackson Justice Committee, formed after an amateur videographer taped
the beating of the 16-year-old Jackson at an Inglewood gas station.
On the tape, Officer Jeremy J. Morse is seen punching the handcuffed
Jackson and slamming him onto the trunk of a car.</TE>
<TE>   Morse and his partner, Bijan Darvish, were indicted in connection
with the beating. Morse has been charged with assault under the color
of authority and Darvish with filing a false police report. Inglewood
Police Chief Ron Banks recommended disciplining both but was blocked
by a judge until further court hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Talibah Shakir, Jackson's cousin, who heads the committee, said
Saturday's event kicked off a new phase in her group's campaign to
end police abuse. Shakir said people must become politically involved
and force change.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to hold elected officials accountable for what's
happening," Shakir said. "And if they don't do what we tell them to
do, then they need to go, no matter what color they are."</TE>
<TE>   About 40 members of the Donovan Jackson Justice Committee traveled
to the rally from Crenshaw.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles resident Lee Harris carried a 3-foot poster of her
son, Cornelius, and the words, "Cruel and Unusual Punishment."</TE>
<TE>   Harris said her son is serving 25 years to life in prison for
possession of cocaine. It was a third-strike case, said a relative,
Sylvia Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an addict, not a criminal," said Davis, a member of
Families to Amend California's Three-Strikes. "But the justice system
didn't care."</TE>
<TE>   Also at the rally was 34-year-old Leroy Franklin Moore, a Berkeley
resident suffering from cerebral palsy. Moore said he became an
outspoken critic of the way police treat the disabled after his own
run-ins with officers.</TE>

<HD>Prosecutor an Island of Calm in D.A. Office Whirlwind</HD>
<DH>Law: Bill Redmond has built a reputation for dependability
and integrity as gatekeeper for 25,000 Ventura County cases a year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County prosecutor Bill Redmond, once a genial national park
ranger at Alcatraz, remains an island of calm amid the crush of
criminal cases he directs as legal gatekeeper in the district
attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   For the last two months, Redmond, 46, has supervised both the
misdemeanor and general felony units of the 10th-largest prosecutor's
office in California. Before his appointment, two people oversaw the
office's 20,000 misdemeanor and 5,000 new felony cases a year.</LD>
<LD>   For felonies alone, that's 20 new cases a day. Redmond analyzes
each one, assigns a lawyer and helps decide what charge to file and
what penalty to seek.</LD>
<TE>   Redmond and 27 other attorneys handle the load, down from a staff
of 44 lawyers for the same duty a decade ago, even though the number
of cases is up 27%.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the type of job [that] if he hesitates or is indecisive, the
cases and issues just pile up," said Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Greg
Totten. "He makes decisions all day long. It's one of the toughest
jobs in the office."</TE>
<TE>   Redmond stands out, however, not because of the job he holds, but
by the way he holds it.</TE>
<TE>   In a high-pressure office where top managers are not always
beloved, Redmond is embraced.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was in the middle of battle and I had to pick one person to
be in a trench next to me, I'd pick Bill," said fellow Deputy Dist.
Atty. Ernesto Acosta. "He's loyal to his friends and he'll back you
up. He makes you feel good about doing your job."</TE>
<TE>   In a profession known for its rabid advocacy, even defense lawyers
say Redmond seeks justice.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not in the business of tooting the horn of prosecutors," said
defense lawyer Kevin DeNoce, a former prosecutor himself. "But you
can talk to Bill, and that's not code for 'Bill gives good deals.' It
means you get a fair hearing."</TE>
<TE>   In an office torn apart this spring by a bitter race to decide who
will succeed retiring Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, Redmond was
the only top prosecutor to decline to sign an advertisement endorsing
Totten, the odds-on favorite and eventual winner.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a big supporter, but he did it behind the scenes," Totten
said. "He took his responsibility as a prosecutor first. To me, that
is a measure of the man."</TE>
<TE>   Redmond is known as a straight shooter who works hard, filling in
for his staff members in court when they are sick and regularly
rolling out of bed when police need to serve a late-night search
warrant.</TE>
<TE>   But if one trait defines Redmond--a stocky 6-footer with the
square-jawed mug of an Irish cop--it is his knack for thinking before
he speaks.</TE>
<TE>   When Redmond finds himself in a tight spot, when he senses his
face reddening, his anger rising or his good humor failing, he
remembers his firefighter father.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't rush into burning buildings," Redmond said. "You don't
want to be in the flames wondering do I turn right or do I turn left.
You need to step back before you step in."</TE>
<TE>   One measure of Redmond's cool is a poster attached to the front of
his office door in the county courthouse in Ventura. For several
years, the "Billometer" posted by an underling has alerted colleagues
to his moods.</TE>
<TE>   They move Redmond's mug shot from one end of a scale to another,
from pale white to bright red.</TE>
<TE>   At 7:55 a.m., for example, a low-pressure Billometer reading
alerts colleagues to "Be Prepared to Hear About Alcatraz Island or
Days As a Park Ranger." As the day progresses, however, the chart
describes Redmond this way: "Lips Don't Move When Talking. Eyes Don't
Move."</TE>
<TE>   "People do actually move the picture. Someone moved it down after
they brought me some cookies," Redmond said with a smile. "I don't
think I've ever made it all the way to the far end."</TE>
<TE>   Redmond is the third of four sons born to Peter and Rose Redmond,
a 35-year San Francisco firefighter and a career clerk in the city's
data processing department.</TE>
<TE>   Raised in the blue-collar Mission District, a student at strict
Jesuit schools, Redmond said his was a no-nonsense family that got up
and went to work. A good student, he graduated from San Francisco
State University in 1979 with a political science degree and a desire
to teach high school civics and coach sports teams.</TE>
<TE>   But teaching jobs were scarce, so he parlayed his summer
employment as a supervisor with the U.S. Youth Conservation Corps
into a job with the National Park Service. After stints at Point
Reyes and Alcatraz--"eight months, exactly 832 tours" as a guide at
the old federal prison--he moved to the Santa Monica Mountains
National Recreation Area, where he became expert in flora, fauna,
fires and trailhead mediation among hikers, bikers and horseback
riders.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, a 30-year-old Redmond enrolled in Ventura College of Law
night school, and the next year joined the Ventura County Probation
Department in charge of 80 troubled juveniles in group homes and
boys' schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I visited each one every month," he said. "First I'd chew them
out, then I'd spend the next half hour shooting baskets and talking.
To those kids, I was both mom and dad. I loved that job."</TE>
<TE>   But in 1990, Redmond passed the State Bar of California exam. And
Totten, whom Redmond had impressed with his questioning in a law
school class, hired him. By 1997, after prosecuting misdemeanor,
fraud and embezzlement, juvenile crime and drug cases, Redmond was in
charge of the general felony unit and its two dozen lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   He has done that job, essentially, ever since, but now with the
misdemeanor responsibilities as well.</TE>
<TE>   A recent meeting, headed by Redmond, suggested the pace at which
he and his lawyers make decisions. It was a regular Friday session
called to analyze the strength of felony cases once a judge decides
there is probable cause for a suspect to be held for trial.</TE>
<TE>   Front-line lawyers evaluate their own cases, then Redmond and
other senior prosecutors ask questions and offer advice. A decision
is reached on what charges to drop and which ones will go to trial.</TE>
<TE>   "Give us the nickel tour," Redmond says to Daniel Feldman, a
three-year prosecutor from New York. The meeting takes only a few
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman said later that he likes Redmond's fatherly mentoring. A
few days earlier, Redmond had canceled his schedule for half a day to
walk Feldman through the quickest way to get an arrest warrant for a
robbery suspect.</TE>
<TE>   "When he's in one of those situations, he calls you 'lad,' "
Feldman said. "He says, 'Pay attention, lad, this is an education
moment.' "</TE>
<TE>   But Redmond is nobody's patsy, Feldman said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you meet with him, you have to make sure you have prepared,"
Feldman said. "If you haven't, you won't want to be around him. He'll
remind you why you were hired."</TE>
<TE>   Redmond doesn't want to be thought of as softie, especially by
defense attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   "We're supposed to be holding the bad guys accountable for their
crimes, and we do," he said. "There are cases where we absolutely go
after the maximum penalty: A drunk driver, I'm going to put him away
as long as I can. He took someone's life because he wanted another
beer."</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, after a new law allowed the prosecution of young
teenagers as adults, Redmond's unit got an attempted murder
conviction against a 14-year-old Oxnard gang member who shot three
kids who had given him a hard time at school. The sentence was 34
years to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "When someone uses a gun or a knife I'm at my most inflexible,"
Redmond said.</TE>
<TE>   But there are also cases where people commit crimes that are out
of character and a response to some singular disruption in their
lives: "We'll consider that, too, in the penalty or rehabilitation."</TE>
<TE>   Redmond is married to former probation officer Terry Redmond, whom
he met on the job. He says his goal is to work another decade in the
district attorney's office, then to see the world with his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Others say he might want to readjust his sights.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd vote for him in a second for district attorney or for judge,"
said veteran defense lawyer Louis Samonsky.</TE>
<TE>   "He's bright and he just has that certain something that gets the
job done well without irritating people," Samonsky said. "Even if you
don't get what you want, you feel you've been dealt with fairly.
That's a good characteristic for a judge, let alone a D.A."</TE>

<HD>Rodeo Shows the Old West Is Alive 'n' Kickin'</HD>
<DH>Events: Cowboy boots and hats abound as 5,000 attend Rancho
Mission Viejo's competition near San Juan Capistrano, bolstering an
American tradition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There seemed to be two types of footwear at Saturday's opening of the
second annual Rancho Mission Viejo Rodeo near San Juan Capistrano.</LD>
<LD>   There were, of course, the myriad of cowboy boots usually
associated with such events.</LD>
<LD>   And there were a fair number of Birkenstock sandals, which usually
aren't.</LD>
<TE>   "Birkenstocks?" exclaimed Diane Gaynor, a spokeswoman for the
ranch. "Hey, that's my kind of shoe."</TE>
<TE>   So it was that the Old West met modern Orange County on a warm
summer Saturday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it wasn't their first meeting. Back before modern Orange
County was modern, old-timers will tell you, the annual rodeo was an
important part of life on the ranch.</TE>
<TE>   The practice was followed for a time in the 1990s at various South
County locations including Rancho Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   And last year the family of Richard O'Neill Sr., which owns and
manages the 25,000-acre Rancho Mission Viejo as the county's oldest
existing large-scale cattle ranch, decided to resurrect the rodeo to
commemorate the 120th anniversary of its stewardship.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an opportunity for the family to perpetuate the great
American cowboy tradition and keep the West alive," Gaynor said.</TE>
<TE>   That seemed especially important in the wake of Sept. 11, she
said, as Americans began wrapping themselves in the red, white and
blue.</TE>
<TE>   Those colors, in fact, were much in evidence Saturday, beginning
with the skydiver who opened the two-day event by dropping into the
ranch's riding park with a huge American flag.</TE>
<TE>   And sales of the $20 admission tickets confirmed the appeal: About
5,000 spectators attended Saturday, about 1,300 more than expected.</TE>
<TE>   "That's really exciting," Gaynor gushed. "My advice is to come
early on Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   Those who did attend were treated to the usual rodeo fare: about
200 contestants in such events as bareback riding, steer wrestling,
calf roping, bronco busting and riding the bulls.</TE>
<TE>   With a purse of $132,500 to be distributed among 24 winners,
organizers were touting the event as the richest two-day rodeo in
America. And, they said, a percentage of the profits, last year
amounting to about $25,000, would be given to charity.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't enough, however, to dissuade a lone animal-rights
protester from standing at the entrance sporting a sign saying, "Real
Men Don't Hurt Animals."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here to let people know that animals get hurt in the rodeo,"
said Lucy Shelton, who said she'd come from Azusa for the event.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have to abuse animals for entertainment, nor should we
as a civilized society."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the rodeogoers seemed to ignore her.</TE>
<TE>   "We like the beauty of it," said Sonja Hoffman, 33, a Huntington
Beach mom with her 2-and 3-year-old daughters in tow, all wearing
matching white cowboy hats.</TE>
<TE>   "We love the country scene. With everything going on in the world,
it shows that we're still united."</TE>
<TE>   Ray Sanchez, 38, an active-duty Marine serving at Camp Pendleton,
said he'd brought his Thai wife to the event to "show her a little
American culture."</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally American," he said of the rodeo. "We're in a fight
for our culture today and it's great that we still have this."</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Erin Hachadoorian, 17, of Trabuco Canyon, who'd
come for reasons of her own.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the cowboys," she said simply.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to find one with really tight jeans and a big buckle. I
think it's cute when they ride the bulls."</TE>
<TE>   The rodeo continues today at 2 p.m.</TE>

<HD>M. Rose, 28; Doctor's Cancer Struggle Played Out on TV</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Marnie Rose, who allowed viewers of the reality television series
"Houston Medical" to witness her battle with brain cancer, has died.
She was 28.</LD>
<LD>   She died Friday afternoon at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center in Houston after being hospitalized the day before with
pneumonia, said her mother, Lanie Rose.</LD>
<LD>   Marnie Rose, a pediatric resident at Memorial Hermann Hospital,
appeared on the six-week summer series on ABC and made a dramatic
first impression when she pulled off her wig to reveal that she was
not only a doctor but also a patient.</LD>
<TE>   In the last episode, which aired July 23, viewers learned that
Rose's tumor had returned, and that its form--a glioblastoma--was
particularly bad.</TE>
<TE>   "Marnie Rose's dedication to her patients, her wry sense of humor
and her love of friends and family made her an inspiration to all of
us at Memorial Hermann and to the millions of viewers of 'Houston
Medical,' " said Beth Sartori, speaking on behalf of the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Rose said in May that she agreed to be on the TV program because
"it would be a good chance to let other people see that a positive
attitude can help, and that they're not alone out there."</TE>
<TE>   Rose grew up in the Houston area and graduated from the University
of Texas at Austin. She was a second-year resident at the University
of Texas Medical School in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day Friday, her mother said, Rose's hospital room
saw a stream of visitors: doctors, friends, other residents from the
medical school.</TE>
<TE>   "The show is certainly not a chronicle of Marnie's decline, but
rather a celebration of her life--and it was a fabulous life," said
Lou Gorfain, an executive producer of the program. "It was full of
courage, hope, humor and beauty."</TE>

<HD>Swami Satchidananda, 87; Yoga Master and Guru Preached and
Practiced a Life of Spiritual Unity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Swami Satchidananda, the yoga master and guru whose message of
spiritual unity brought solace to the Woodstock generation and
attracted followers from Hollywood to Virginia, died Monday in India.
He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   The swami lived in Yogaville, Va., a 1,000-acre community he
founded by the Blue Ridge Mountains near Charlottesville in 1979.</LD>
<LD>   He was in his native South India to address a peace conference
when he died suddenly from a thoracic aneurysm, a Yogaville
representative said.</LD>
<TE>   Brought to America in 1966 by psychedelic artist Peter Max, the
swami was part of a wave of Hindu teachers in the 1960s and '70s who
found among U.S. youth a curiosity about Eastern mysticism, music and
meditation. He became known as the "Woodstock guru" after he opened
that epochal music festival in 1969 by declaring music "the celestial
sound that controls the whole universe."</TE>
<TE>   He gradually shifted his base of operations from Sri Lanka to the
U.S. and opened branches of his Integral Yoga Institute around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Carole King a Disciple</TE>
<TE>   Among his disciples are singer-composer Carole King, who donated
600 acres to his Virginia ashram; jazz pianist Alice Coltrane; and
actresses Diane Ladd, Laura Dern and Sally Kirkland. Another adherent
is Dr. Dean Ornish, the best-selling author, who said the teachings
of the swami inspired his research and program for reversing heart
disease through diet and relaxation.</TE>
<TE>   The swami was a tall, lean man in a billowing white beard and
saffron robes. Followers often remarked on his penetrating,
otherworldly gaze. "When you looked in his eyes," Max recalled
recently of his first meeting with the guru 36 years ago, "nobody was
home except an ocean of love."</TE>
<TE>   The swami loved to fly planes and helicopters and had satellite
television installed in his modern house at the ashram. He was
fascinated by cameras and would usually be seen carrying the latest
models, presents from admirers.</TE>
<TE>   His followers regarded him as a fount of practical wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   Actress Lindsay Crouse recalled a meditation with the swami during
which a woman confessed how aggrieved she was by her lack of success.
"She said, 'I've really been trying to do good work, make independent
films, not commercial, but I just can't get anywhere with it,' "
Crouse recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," the swami replied, "people obviously don't want that--do
something else!"</TE>
<TE>   "He was very down to earth," Crouse said. "He gave very simple
advice, [so simple] it would make you feel sort of silly after a
while."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Chettipalayam in South India in 1914, he was the son of
wealthy landowners. As a young man, he worked in his uncle's auto
import business and learned welding. He also worked briefly in
India's film industry as a cameraman and producer.</TE>
<TE>   He married and had children. But when his wife of five years died,
he began, at age 28, his spiritual journey. He took the vows of a
renunciate and traded his given name of Ramaswamy for Satchidananda,
said to mean "existence, knowledge, bliss."</TE>
<TE>   He studied with some of India's greatest sages, adopting Swami
Sivananda as his guru in 1949. Four years later, he left for Sri
Lanka, where he opened a branch of Sivananda's organization, the
Divine Life Society. He remained for several years, opening an
orphanage and medical clinic, and joining a movement to welcome
untouchables to Hindu temples.</TE>
<TE>   In 1966, Conrad Rooks, a filmmaker, invited Max to Paris to help
him with a project, a movie about "the meaning of life." When Max
arrived, he was greeted by Rooks, Ravi Shankar and Swami
Satchidananda.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know what a swami was," Max said. But he was instantly
mesmerized by the Indian man with golden eyes. "I just told him,
'Swami, America needs you desperately to come there.' All the hippies
were running around, experimenting, trying to become sort of
enlightened."</TE>
<TE>   Under a visa identifying him as "Minister of Divine Words," the
swami came for a two-day visit, but wound up staying for the rest of
his life. He became a popular yoga teacher in New York City. Within a
year, his supporters had bought him a $1-million center on
Manhattan's Upper West Side.</TE>
<TE>   Finding an Inner Peace</TE>
<TE>   His integral yoga teaches Hatha yoga and other methods, as well as
meditation, chanting and cleansing practices.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a major figure who helped bring yoga to the West," said
Nora Isaacs, managing editor of the Berkeley-based Yoga Journal. "His
underlying message was that every person has peace within them, but
it's all covered up. By doing these practices, you uncover that."</TE>
<TE>   He reached a massive audience in 1969, in a cow pasture in New
York state. Max, his sponsor, knew Michael Lang, one of the
organizers of the Woodstock festival, and proposed that the swami
open the event.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting on a stage that would be shared by such countercultural
icons as Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead, the swami
challenged the throngs to use "the sacred art of music" to bring
peace to the globe.</TE>
<TE>   He attracted a celebrity following that included Mia Farrow,
George Harrison and Rascals vocalist Felix Cavaliere. Some of his
students became yoga teachers, such as King and Kirk- land, who has
taught Bob Dylan, Elia Kazan and Robert DeNiro.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very, very playful, which is why so many celebrities
enjoyed being with him," said Nirmala Heriza, a longtime devotee who
now directs the Integral Yoga Center of Los Angeles, as well as a
rehabilitation program for heart patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center that is based on the swami's precepts.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland nearly became a monk after meeting the swami in 1969. She
remembered that when she asked him if she should quit show business,
he said, "No, no, no, no, no. Your destiny is to be a public
person.... Just consider yourself a plainclothes swami."</TE>
<TE>   "If you met him today, you would feel you were in the presence of
a 12-year-old," Kirkland said. "He had such innocence and joy, and a
hysterical sense of humor."</TE>
<TE>   At the dedication of a $2-million, lotus-shaped temple at the
Virginia ashram in 1986, he flew in a helicopter over the site,
leaning out to pour holy water over the structure. The festivities
included a parade featuring a flame-tossing juggler, monks, priests
and rabbis. Leading the procession was a baby elephant named Bubbles.</TE>
<TE>   The lotus shrine is the focal point of the ashram. It features a
column of light ascending from a central altar that divides into 12
rays. The rays represent the world's religions, while the central
light symbolizes universal wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   The message, the swami once said, was "not to make one religion
out of 12" but to illuminate the central truths at their core. His
slogan was "Truth Is One, Paths Are Many."</TE>
<TE>   "Read the Bible, read the Koran, read the Torah, the Upanishads,
the Bhagavad Gita," the ecumenical guru said. "They all say: 'Refine
yourself. Get out of these definitions.' It's the definitions that
divide us."</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 1,500 mourners attended his funeral Thursday in
Yogaville. He will be entombed in a sarcophagus beneath a statue of
his likeness.</TE>

<HD>Self-Styled Russian 'Noble' Was Prince of Beverly Hills</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Hollywood stars went out at night during the 1940s and '50s,
Romanoffs restaurant was their playground, where highbrow desserts
and high-living actors mixed with celebrity fistfights and legendary
elan.</LD>
<LD>   Fans loitered at the entrance to catch a glimpse of their favorite
stars. Inside, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz would be doing the rumba
and Joan Crawford the Charleston. Myrna Loy and her producer husband,
Arthur Hornblow Jr., celebrated their divorce there, and Jayne
Mansfield famously upstaged Sophia Loren when her breasts
"accidentally" fell out of her dress.</LD>
<LD>   Errol Flynn hosted feasts of roasted suckling pigs there. MCA
executives held court to set actors' salaries. Gossip columnists
Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper finally made peace. And the
restaurant owner, a self-styled prince who called himself Michael
Romanoff, dined daily with his two English bulldogs--Socrates and
Confucius--and handed out toothbrushes to patrons.</LD>
<TE>   It was a time when everyone who was anyone in Hollywood ate at
Romanoffs, Chasen's, Perino's or the Brown Derby, then hit nightclubs
like the Mocambo, Ciro's, the Cocoanut Grove or the Trocadero.</TE>
<TE>   Those were the days when a star was a star and a restaurant was
not just a hangout or a famous dish but an establishment in which to
see and be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Romanoff, crowned by Life magazine as "the most wonderful liar in
the 20th century U.S.," helped to mold the culinary and social
character of Beverly Hills for more than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Under the mythical cloak of a suavely elegant Russian noble,
Romanoff was perhaps the world's greatest impostor. Legendary for his
charm and outrageous tall tales, he remained tight-lipped about the
stars' secrets. He rose from the slums of New York City to become a
toast of Hollywood. Almost everyone knew him to be a grand old fraud,
but they loved him in spite of it--or maybe because of it.</TE>
<TE>   Although he claimed to be part of the Russian imperial family to
win the hearts of celebrities, immigration officials listed him as
Hershel Geguzin, a name he later changed to Harry F. Gerguson. He was
born in 1890 in a Jewish village in Lithuania. His father died before
his birth, leaving a widow with six children to raise.</TE>
<TE>   When he was 10, his mother feared for the safety of her
incorrigible youngest and sent him to America with a cousin.</TE>
<TE>   Still rebellious, he ran away from the cousin, as well as from
orphanages and assorted brutal caretakers. He survived on the streets
of New York by working odd jobs as a newspaper boy and a bellhop. His
thirst for an education came late in his teens, when he worked his
way through a private high school.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating, he worked on a cattle ship bound for England.
There, he honed his skills and picked up an Oxbridge accent. When he
was caught impersonating an English aristocrat and throwing a lavish
party that he couldn't afford, he was tossed into jail for the
duration of World War I. Scotland Yard listed him as "a rogue of
uncertain origin."</TE>
<TE>   Before returning to America in the early 1920s, he lived in Paris,
working at a library where he met two Russian gentlemen who impressed
him enough to try his hand again as a master of disguise. This time,
he went with Russian nobility, calling himself Prince Michael.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the U.S., he hopscotched between the East and West coasts,
playing bit parts on Broadway and working in Hollywood as an extra.
He even grandstanded by democratically downplaying his supposed
imperial birthright--he said he was the nephew of the last czar--and
foregoing the title of grand duke. " 'Prince Michael' is good
enough," he'd say.</TE>
<TE>   Trail of Unpaid Bills</TE>
<TE>   Caught up in the swirl of cocktail parties and movie premieres, he
also left a trail of unpaid hotel and restaurant bills and a few
broken hearts. His charade as a Russian aristocrat was blown at a
Hollywood dinner party in the late 1920s, when former Maj. Gen.
Theodor Lodijensky of the Russian Imperial Guard confronted him.
Lodijensky, who was working as a technical director for one of the
studios, said he had known the original Prince Michael Romanov in
Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Romanoff "can't even speak Russian," Lodijensky snorted.</TE>
<TE>   But the truth didn't matter; the growing legend did. In the 1920s,
people loved fantastic stunt stories, and Romanoff was the darling of
the press. Despite the disclosure that he was an impostor, he
continued living his fantasy, eager to oblige the scandalmongers.</TE>
<TE>   When word spread that he was a regular at the Clover Club, a
casino, huge crowds followed. The club is said to have repaid
Romanoff for his presence by allowing him to win tidy sums.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1930s, restaurateur Dave Chasen invited him to eat for
free. It was there that Romanoff's restaurant career got going.</TE>
<TE>   Once he was reportedly dining with a group of unruly and drunken
friends, who felt ignored as they yelled orders at the waiters. Some
of them turned to him and said: "Mike, you're going to open your own
joint."</TE>
<TE>   In 1939, his friends, from financiers Harry Crocker and John Hay
"Jock" Whitney to celebrities Charlie Chaplin, James Cagney, Humphrey
Bogart, Darryl F. Zanuck, Joseph Schenck and Robert Benchley,
bankrolled him with a total of $8,000. With this and a few thousand
of his own, he leased space in a building at 326 N. Rodeo Drive and
opened that same year.</TE>
<TE>   Film studios supplied the wallpaper and decorations and, when
Romanoff's silver serving dishes hadn't arrived by opening time, the
Brown Derby lent him its ware.</TE>
<TE>   Bogart always occupied Table No. 1, where he ordered the same
lunch every day: two Scotch and sodas, an omelet, French toast, milk
and then, at the end, coffee and a brandy. When he wasn't busy
table-hopping at his own restaurant or putting real pearls in oysters
for friends as a surprise, Romanoff was appearing on the silver
screen. He made cameos in more than a dozen films, including "Fools
of Scandal" with Carole Lombard and "An Innocent Affair" starring
Fred MacMurray.</TE>
<TE>   As Hollywood careers rose and fell in the five choicest booths
near the bar, Romanoff gained renown for his palate-pleasers, such as
his "strawberries Romanoff"--berries sprinkled with orange and
strawberry liqueurs, cognac and brown sugar, folded into vanilla ice
cream and whipped cream.</TE>
<TE>   He readily confessed that the secret to a good restaurant was not
its owner, but a French chef.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't lay an egg, but I'm a better judge of an omelet than a
hen," he often boasted.</TE>
<TE>   In 1940, in a ploy to draw attention and reward a beautiful
employee, he held a contest in which co-workers chose waitress Jackie
Wilmott as "Cinderella Girl." He decked her out in a ball gown and
fur and escorted her to the premiere of the Oscar-destined film
"Rebecca."</TE>
<TE>   Romanoff was always impeccably groomed in a three-piece suit,
short-cropped hair and pencil-thin mustache. Smoking a cigarette and
carrying a gold-tipped walking stick, he cut quite a figure
hobnobbing with Bogart, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and other members
of the Rat Pack.</TE>
<TE>   Marriage at 58</TE>
<TE>   In 1948, at age 58, he put some of his drinking and carousing
behind him and married for the first time. His bride was his business
manager, 24-year-old Gloria Lister.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, in 1951, the popular eatery and watering hole
pulled up stakes and moved south of Wilshire Boulevard to 140 S.
Rodeo. The grubstake was a $25,000 donation from Alfred G.
Vanderbilt, who said, "This is the least I can do for my emperor."
Romanoff built a $400,000 restaurant, complete with a ballroom,
private and main dining rooms, cocktail lounge and penthouse.</TE>
<TE>   On the facade, "Romanoffs"--sans apostrophe--was spelled in large
wrought-iron letters with the signature "R" topped by a crown.</TE>
<TE>   When J. Edgar Hoover was in town, he enjoyed the wicked pleasure
of Romanoff's restaurants, at a table across from the likes of Bugsy
Siegel or Sinatra--both of whom his agency spied on</TE>
<TE>   Once, the notorious jewel thief Swifty Morgan, a friend of
Siegel's, is said to have tried to sell Hoover a hot diamond
bracelet. Hoover offered him $500.</TE>
<TE>   "Five hundred?" Morgan reportedly exclaimed as he snatched it
back. "Why, John, there's a $5,000 reward out for this!"</TE>
<TE>   Hoover would later pull strings to help Romanoff become a citizen,
which took an act of Congress because there were no records of his
birth.</TE>
<TE>   In 1951, Romanoff made headlines again when he rushed to the side
of a friend, film producer Walter Wanger, who--suspecting that movie
agent Jennings Lang was having an affair with Wanger's wife, Joan
Bennett--shot and wounded Lang in the groin.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Beverly Hills jail, photographers and camera crews
captured Romanoff--along with his maitre d'--delivering silver-domed
trays of Wanger's favorite foods, a pair of silk pajamas and a pipe.</TE>
<TE>   It was in front of Romanoffs, in 1952, that William Randolph
Hearst Jr., the eldest son of the late publisher William Randolph
Hearst, slugged it out with Horace Brown, the new husband of Marion
Davies. The actress had been the senior Hearst's longtime companion,
but when Brown invited the younger Hearst to their table, he refused.
The Hearst offspring were not fond of Davies. Brown took the refusal
as an insult; the two men stepped outside and swapped punches.</TE>
<TE>   Romanoffs began to decline after Bogart's death in 1957. It was
then that Sinatra took over as Rat Pack leader and invited Romanoff
along on trips and movie shoots around the world. With Romanoff and
his celebrity friends no longer dining at the restaurant, patrons
began to go elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   For the same reason, his two other restaurants, in Palm Springs
and San Francisco, were never very successful.</TE>
<TE>   Romanoffs closed on New Year's Eve in 1962. He was no longer
willing to spend the evening rubbernecking with young stars who
scoffed at the aura of formality.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no longer room here for an elegant restaurant of this
kind," Romanoff said. He also blamed the government for cracking down
on expense accounts.</TE>
<TE>   He sold the property in 1963, making a tidy sum. The building was
demolished a year later and replaced with an office complex.</TE>
<TE>   His death in 1971, at age 81, made national news, just as much of
his fraudulent but fabulous life had done.</TE>

<HD>Gathering Fights Those Who Deal in Human Lives</HD>
<DH>Border: Social workers, law enforcement and human rights
activists meet to devise strategies to combat criminals who
prostitute thousands of women and children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE-MARIE O'CONNOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>"Reina" was living with her abusive father when a charming stranger
appeared in her Mexican village with promises of a good job in the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, he allegedly forced the 15-year-old to serve as a
prostitute for as many as 50 men a day in rural San Diego camps along
with girls as young as 12.</LD>
<LD>   This grim byproduct of globalization will bring together local law
enforcement officers, social workers and human rights activists from
both sides of the border for a two-day conference beginning Monday to
discuss combating the international traffic in women and children.</LD>
<TE>   According to the U.S. State Department's Office to Combat
Trafficking in Persons, about 700,000 people--most of them women and
children--are trafficked across international borders worldwide each
year. As many as 50,000 land in the United States, and California is
a prime destination.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to join together and stop their exploitation," said
Marisa Ugarte, Reina's former counselor and chairwoman of the Safety
Corridor Coalition, which organized the conference.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge problem," said Manolo Guillen, program manager of San
Diego Youth and Community Services, a member of the coalition that
provided Reina, now 17, with safe housing until she was moved to
another state two months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Tenorio, an assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego, will
speak Monday on new avenues for prosecuting criminals opened by the
2000 Trafficking and Violence Protection Act. The measure
strengthened legal statutes, increased penalties and filled legal
loopholes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easier now to prove exploitation of juveniles forced into
commercial sex acts," Tenorio said. "Now, if it involves juveniles in
commercial sex acts, we don't have to prove violence [was used to
coerce them]."</TE>
<TE>   The legislation also provided money for certified victims of
trafficking, and created a special U.S. "T visa" that allows those
eligible to remain in the country permanently. There's a
hotline--(888) 428-7581--to report illegal dealing in human beings.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm really trying to do is let victims know they have
resources here, and if they come forward, there's protection,"
Tenorio said.</TE>
<TE>   Other speakers at the conference, which was also held last year,
will include local directors of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as
Mexican human rights officers who specialize in the trafficking in
women and children. Author and child-trafficking expert Richard Estes
will field questions.</TE>
<TE>   The conference will be held at the Recital Hall in Balboa Park--a
scenic preserve that was the site of a 1993 scandal involving
immigrant boys, some as young as 9, who survived by prostituting
themselves to American men in business suits and BMWs.</TE>
<TE>   Tenorio said law enforcement officers had been discussing
trafficking issues for a year when they decided to meet with the
Safety Corridor Coalition, composed mostly of social service
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "You see, this is really unique and you need to work together," he
said. "These are people who can take care of the psychological and
medical needs of the victims."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Hill, founder of Hawaii-based Sisters Offering Support, will
discuss psychological issues facing children pushed into
prostitution. She once counseled a 12-year-old girl.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never the kids' choice," Hill said. "They're put in a
situation where they feel they can't say no."</TE>
<TE>   Liz Pleitez Christie, program manager for a Planned Parenthood
migrant outreach program in Escondido, said she met 12-and
13-year-old girls working at "sex camps" in northern San Diego
County. "It's real easy to go down into Mexico and Central America
into these little communities and say, 'I can get you a really good
job as a nanny or a housekeeper in the United States,' " she said.
"When they get here, they're forced to have sex."</TE>
<TE>   Typically, she said, men learn by word of mouth when prostitutes
will be available some weekend at an old ranch. Prostitutes are told
that "if they leave, they will find where they are and kill them,"
she said. "They say they'll tell their families and their little
communities what kind of work they're doing."</TE>
<TE>   It was at such a camp that Pleitez Christie first crossed paths
with Reina. The man who brought Reina from central Mexico kidnapped
her 4-month-old son, telling her she would never see him again if she
refused to work for him, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   But eventually, in December 2000, Reina ran to a nearby home and
asked for help. The next day a San Diego County sheriff's deputy told
Deputy Rick Castro in Vista that he had picked up a girl--Reina--who
said she was forced into prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   Castro conducted surveillance and counted vans driving in and out
of the Oceanside camp, "like a shuttle service," bringing about 300
men who paid $15 to $20 each for visits with six girls, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The pimps had lookouts, cell phones and two-way radios, Castro
said. He said the ring involved 30 to 40 young women, half of them
younger than 18, some only 12.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies descended on the camp and picked up 15 young women. They
arrested 30 men, but federal prosecutors had trouble building cases
"because the girls were so intimidated," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One young woman who tried to flee the ring was beaten for two
hours with a clothes hanger in front of the other girls, he said.
Castro said pimps were holding other women's children too.</TE>
<TE>   More than half the men were simply deported, he said--and the
investigation remains open.</TE>
<TE>   "San Diego being so close to the border is making it a prime spot
for sex trafficking in minors, but it's overlooked," said Castro, who
plans to attend the conference.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't ask the right questions, law enforcement is not
going to realize the girls are being forced into prostitution," he
said. "We need to wake people up about this. It's become a big
business."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators found Reina's son with her captor's relatives, and
mother and child were finally reunited in May.</TE>
<TE>   While she waited, she spoke about her ordeal to about 100 people
at a conference on human trafficking at the University of San Diego,
disguising her identify with a yellow silk veil.</TE>
<TE>   Her captor is still at large, authorities say.</TE>

<HD>Latino Group Mixes Its Messages on Secession</HD>
<DH>Breakup: Mexican American Political Assn. officials
announce, then deny, their support of Valley cityhood plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A dispute within a national Latino political group over San Fernando
Valley cityhood has become public, with a vice president announcing
the organization's support for secession and the president saying no
such endorsement had been made.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides said the matter would probably be settled Saturday at a
meeting of the Mexican American Political Assn.'s national executive
board.</LD>
<LD>   "Until then, there is no national MAPA endorsement of Valley
secession," national President Steve Figueroa said.</LD>
<TE>   The organization's Hollywood area chapter supports Hollywood
secession, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute within the national leadership mirrors one at the
local level. A long-standing Valley chapter of MAPA voted to oppose
secession, but a new chapter is being formed in the Valley by
secession supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another example of secessionists trying to mislead the
Latino community," said Xavier Flores, vice president of the Valley
chapter that opposes secession.</TE>
<TE>   One association leader said the dispute may end up in court as the
principals consult with attorneys on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders have courted the civil rights group, which was
formed in the 1960s, because they see Latinos as a crucial voting
bloc in the November election.</TE>
<TE>   Secession supporters believe the group has sway within the Latino
community, even though the national organization appears to be in
disarray.</TE>
<TE>   Figueroa's board is one of two that have filed papers with the
California secretary of state's office to be recognized as the
national MAPA. The other group has not weighed in on the secession
issue.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Valley and Hollywood cityhood committees put out a
notice that national Vice President Al Castaneda would announce
MAPA's endorsement of both secession proposals on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   In an appearance with secession leaders in Pacoima on Friday,
Castaneda said the national group had endorsed the secession
proposals at a recent convention after it "came to the conclusion
that the people of San Fernando [Valley] and Hollywood are ready to
stand on their own."</TE>
<TE>   But in view of the national board's upcoming meeting, he added:
"We may be forced to recall that endorsement in the short future."</TE>

<HD>Ban on Hunting White Black Bear OKd</HD>
<DH>Biology: Alaska board's action applies to a rare animal
that was spotted by a photographer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE</DL>
<LD>A rare white-colored black bear has received a reprieve from hunters.</LD>
<LD>   In a teleconference Friday, the Alaska Board of Game ordered an
emergency closure on hunting of all "white phase" black bears in the
Juneau area. Effectively, that covers only one known white bear, the
one spotted and photographed recently by Pat Costello.</LD>
<LD>   Costello petitioned the board last week, asking that the animal he
dubbed "Spirit Bear" be exempt when hunting season opens Sept. 1.
"I'm thrilled with what the board did," Costello said. "They realized
there's an extreme interest in this bear."</LD>
<TE>   Costello had the backing of hundreds of e-mails received in the
last week after he posted a picture of the bear on his Web site,
www.juneauphotos.com. People all over the world don't want to see the
bear harmed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "People recognize this is a unique animal. It's important to them,
whether they ever get to see it or not," he said. "They don't want to
see it just made into another rug."</TE>
<TE>   The game board's executive director, Diana Cote, said board
members agreed, and the state Department of Fish and Game told the
policymaking panel that it also supported the ban. State game
officials say they also have been flooded with phone calls and
e-mails urging them to spare the bear.</TE>
<TE>   The ban will last at least until the game board meets Nov. 1, when
it will ask for public testimony and decide whether to extend the ban
through the hunting season, which ends June 30.</TE>
<TE>   The bear is creamy white, almost like a polar bear, but with a
distinctive raccoon mask around the eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Most likely it is a variation of what biologists call a glacier
bear--genetically a black bear, but with a light fur coat that can
run from cinnamon to golden retriever blond to blue-white.</TE>
<TE>   Although glacier bears are scarce, a bear this white is rare even
among glacier bears. Biologists in southeastern Alaska said they have
not seen another like it.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, there are a lot of different color morphs with black
bear," said Neil Barten, Douglas area biologist with the Alaska
Department of Fish and Game.</TE>
<TE>   "But not quite this white. This is definitely unusual."</TE>
<TE>   State biologists have known of the bear's existence for a few
years. But knowledge of it became public after Costello took its
picture.</TE>

<HD>Crews Close to Linking Fire Lines Around 2 Parts of Oregon
Blaze</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Firefighters on Saturday were within a mile of linking fire lines
around the western and southern sections of the nearly 495,000-acre
Biscuit fire in southwestern Oregon.</LD>
<LD>   Once connected, the two fire lines will form a minimal perimeter
stripped of fuel to keep the blaze away from communities along the
Oregon coast to the west and mountain towns to the northwest.</LD>
<LD>   Crews should have the line connected within the next few days, a
fire spokeswoman said.</LD>
<TE>   The blaze has become the nation's largest wildfire this year.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the Biscuit fire was 70% contained by 206 miles of
fully reinforced fire lines.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters made so much progress on fires in Oregon and
Washington in recent days that officials canceled plans to call up
about 700 soldiers from Ft. Bragg, N.C., said Doug Huntington, an
information officer at the Pacific Northwest Multi-Agency
Coordinating Group in Portland.</TE>

<HD>Doctor Accused of Anti-Islam Bombing Plot 'Knew His Stuff'</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Florida officials say the Tampa podiatrist had a
'mission template' and an arsenal powerful enough to level his
townhouse complex.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A doctor suspected of an elaborate plot to blow up dozens of mosques
and an Islamic education center had enough expertise and firepower to
carry it out, police said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Robert J. Goldstein, a foot specialist, possessed an arsenal
powerful enough to level the 200-unit townhouse complex where he
lives and a detailed "mission template" full of instructions,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "He was just a smart guy," said sheriff's Det. Cal Dennie. "He
knew his stuff. It was like a James Bond thing."</LD>
<TE>   Officials were still investigating Saturday, said Special Agent
Carlos Baixauli of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms. He wouldn't give details. Representatives of the U.S.
attorney's office in Tampa didn't return calls.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein, 37, was arrested Friday and charged with possession of
a nonregistered destructive device and attempting to use an explosive
to damage and destroy Islamic centers. He was being held Saturday
without bail.</TE>
<TE>   Police said that when they searched his home, they found a cache
of up to 40 weapons, including .50-caliber machine guns and sniper
rifles. They also uncovered more than 30 explosive devices, including
hand grenades and a 5-gallon gasoline bomb with a timer attached. "If
one of those bombs were to have gone off, that townhouse would have
been destroyed," Baixauli said. "If the others exploded, we would
have lost most of that townhouse complex."</TE>
<TE>   Deputies also found a typed list of approximately 50 Islamic
places of worship in the Tampa and St. Petersburg area and elsewhere
in the state, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Police went to Goldstein's home early Friday after his mother
asked that they make a safety check. Goldstein's wife, Kristi, said
her husband was threatening to kill her, according to an affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   Dennie said Goldstein's wife cooperated with investigators, but he
did not give details.</TE>
<TE>   It took police 30 minutes to coax Robert Goldstein out of the
home, which was rigged with trip wires and surveillance cameras. He
was placed in custody under a state law that allows involuntary
commitment for psychiatric evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing before a federal magistrate Friday, Goldstein sobbed
loudly and responded to questions in low mumbles. His attorneys said
he needed medications that he had been taking.</TE>
<TE>   "We do have some preliminary concerns about his competency," said
attorney Myles Malman of Hollywood, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The 11-point mission template for attacking the Islamic education
center covered everything from what to wear to getting rid of
fingerprints and dealing with hand-to-hand combat if needed,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "Set timers for approximately 15-20 minutes to allow for enough
time to get out of area, but to confirm explosions has [sic] been
successful," it reads. "The amount of explosives should be ample to
take down the building (s)."</TE>
<TE>   The director of an Islamic society whose mosque was found on
Goldstein's list said worshipers will increase their vigilance.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to open our eyes," said Mohammad Sultan, head of the
Islamic Society of Tampa Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein's fellow podiatrists were stunned by the arrest. One
said Goldstein did not mingle with fellow doctors.</TE>

<HD>Bush Ends His Fund-Raising Tour</HD>
<DH>Politics: At a West Los Angeles gathering, Bill Simon makes
light of the president's 'arm's length' relationship with him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN and MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>LAS CRUCES, N.M.</DL>
<LD>Dogged by small but hearty bands of protesters, President Bush on
Saturday wrapped up three days of fund-raising in the West that
brought in millions of dollars for Republicans, including more than
$2.5 million for Bill Simon Jr., the GOP gubernatorial candidate in
California.</LD>
<LD>   Before leaving California, the president spoke at a breakfast for
Simon in West Los Angeles, his third fund-raising appearance for the
beleaguered nominee since arriving in the state Friday morning.</LD>
<LD>   As his motorcade arrived for the fund-raiser, it was greeted by
several hundred jeering protesters corralled on the sidewalks at the
intersection of Westwood and Santa Monica boulevards.</LD>
<TE>   Shouting through bullhorns and pounding on drums, some
demonstrators waved signs that read: "No War for Oil," "Stop Bush"
and "Bush and Simon, Corporate Crooks."</TE>
<TE>   But there also were a few pro-Bush signs, with one reading: "Luvya
Dubya."</TE>
<TE>   Far above the commotion, the piped-in strains of Vivaldi set a
placid tone as 250 Republican donors gathered on the 17th floor of
the Regency Club.</TE>
<TE>   Introducing Bush, Simon made light of news reports that the
president had distanced himself from the nominee during public
appearances in Stockton and Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   "If keeping me at arm's length really means flying several
thousand miles out here to campaign with us for two days, and now
you've done five events with us, could you please keep me at arm's
length for the balance of the campaign?" Simon joked.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, the president expressed his pleasure in backing
"this good man in his quest to be governor."</TE>
<TE>   "I stand by his side because I know you can do better in
California," said Bush, who never spoke Gov. Gray Davis' name during
his visit. "The status quo is not acceptable.... Sacramento needs a
breath of fresh air, a new attitude."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the White House backed former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan in the GOP gubernatorial primary. After Simon's upset
victory, Bush dutifully supported Simon's longshot candidacy--only to
be blindsided by a recent civil jury award of $78 million against
Simon's family investment firm regarding allegations of fraud. Still,
the president followed through on his commitment to speak at the
three Simon fund-raisers--amid much speculation over how vigorously
Bush would promote Simon's candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Although the president unequivocally expressed his support for
Simon during the invitation-only fund-raisers, Bush did not do so in
the public events, during which he touted his policy initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   And once in New Mexico, Bush resumed his tough rhetoric against
executive wrongdoers, vowing to "rout those out who cook the books."</TE>
<TE>   In Las Cruces, Bush spoke Saturday afternoon at New Mexico State
University. "It's great to come to a place where you can see cowboy
hats and belt buckles and boots," the president quipped.</TE>
<TE>   It was while touting his initiative to create a Department of
Homeland Security that Bush sounded perhaps the most partisan note of
the three-day Western journey.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the objections of some Senate Democrats to some
provisions of that initiative, Bush fumed: "There are senators who
are more worried about the special interests in Washington than they
are about protecting the people. They are more interested in their
turf than they are about homeland security."</TE>
<TE>   Before returning to his ranch near Crawford, Texas, where he is
spending much of August, Bush attended a $1,000-a-plate dinner to
benefit Republican House candidate Steve Pearce, and John Sanchez,
the GOP gubernatorial candidate.</TE>
<TE>   The president's stops in New Mexico marked the end of a policy and
politics swing that began Thursday with a visit to Oregon, where he
touted a new policy to make it easier for the timber industry to
clear flammable underbrush and trees in fire-prone forests.</TE>

<HD>Ill. Governor Rejects Death Penalty Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Gov. George Ryan took legislation meant to punish terrorists with the
death penalty and altered it to include new safeguards in the state's
troubled capital punishment system.</LD>
<LD>   The changes he made Friday include having the state Supreme Court
more closely review each death sentence, barring the execution of
mentally retarded defendants and recommending that confessions in
capital cases be videotaped.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan drew national attention two years ago when he put a
moratorium on executions in the state, citing statistics showing that
since 1977, 13 death row inmates were freed because they had been
wrongly convicted.</LD>
<TE>   The Republican governor said in June that he might even propose
abolishing capital punishment in Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Now, lawmakers must decide whether to accept Ryan's changes, let
the anti-terrorism bill die or try to find enough votes to reverse
his action.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second time Ryan has rejected the legislation, which
has been pushed by state Atty. Gen. Jim Ryan in response to the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks. The governor and the attorney general are not
related.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-terrorism measure would give police greater power to
listen in on suspects' telephone conversations, make it a felony to
take a firearm on an airplane and let the attorney general freeze
terrorists' assets.</TE>
<TE>   It also would make terrorism a death penalty offense, something
the governor says is covered by existing laws. Ryan used his veto
power to remove that section from an earlier version of the bill, but
lawmakers restored it.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Ryan left the death penalty but added the highlights of
85 reforms recommended by his capital punishment commission in April.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators will consider Ryan's changes in November. They can
accept them with a simple majority vote or override them with a
three-fifths majority in each chamber.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan applauded the attempt to crack down on terrorism but said he
could not expand the death penalty until his reform proposals receive
"real legislative attention."</TE>

<HD>If Las Vegans Keep Wasting Their Water, All Bets Are Off</HD>
<DH>Environment: As the city's boom continues, many residents
ignore conservation messages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Before dawn, when the neon still glows and the rest of the city
sleeps, the trickle of water begins miles from the famous Strip. Slow
and steady, it swells into a stream, easing down a quiet neighborhood
street by the time the investigator arrives.</LD>
<LD>   Dennis Gegen parks his white pickup truck, grabs his video camera
and begins his case outside the stucco home. Efficient and almost
unnoticed, he inspects sprinklers and the flow from the leaky lawn.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes you can follow something like this for miles," he says,
pointing to a tiny flow.</LD>
<TE>   He hangs a white-and-yellow violation notice on the front
doorknob.</TE>
<TE>   This, he says, is the home of a water waster.</TE>
<TE>   Away from the fantasy of a desert oasis, reality is often a tough
sell to locals: This is a parched desert city whose residents live on
the edge of habitability.</TE>
<TE>   This is a place that gets an average of 4 inches of rain a year,
and triple-digit heat is the norm in summer.</TE>
<TE>   The wasted water running down neighborhood gutters came from 1,050
miles away in the Rocky Mountains, where global warming is apparently
altering conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Less water has made its way to Lake Mead, filled by the Colorado
River and the source of southern Nevada's drinking water. Lake levels
are the lowest since 1964.</TE>
<TE>   Water waste is rampant amid the most explosive growth in the
country, and the federal government says global warming will only
worsen the city's problems.</TE>
<TE>   Higher temperatures will lead to more heat-related illnesses, air
pollution will contribute to more respiratory problems and water woes
will increase, a government report says.</TE>
<TE>   Conserve or else, water officials say. Manage growth better or
stop it, environmentalists say.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1920s, when Las Vegas was nothing but a dusty railroad
town, no one knew the boomtown it would become. So when water rights
to the Colorado were given out in 1928, Nevada got the least.</TE>
<TE>   For a while, 300,000 acre-feet of water a year seemed to be
enough.</TE>
<TE>   An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, enough water to supply two
families for a year.</TE>
<TE>   But this year, metro Las Vegas, at 1.5 million people and
counting, will exceed its allotment for the first time by an
estimated 10,000 to 20,000 acre-feet.</TE>
<TE>   Water officials are convinced that Las Vegas has enough water to
keep growing until 2050, assuming the city meets conservation goals.</TE>
<TE>   So far, conservation hasn't been taken seriously.</TE>
<TE>   The city failed to meet its conservation goals for the last three
years. Last year, 10.4 billion gallons of water were wasted--enough
to wash 260 million cars, the local water authority says.</TE>
<TE>   Lawns in sprawling subdivisions require 90 inches of water a year
to stay healthy, but most residents use much more.</TE>
<TE>   Residents are forbidden from watering their lawns between noon and
7 p.m., but Gegen always finds a waster.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time," he says, shaking his head.</TE>
<TE>   The city's poor conservation forced the Las Vegas Valley Water
District to get tougher. Now, chronic wasters must pay a fine or
attend a conservation class.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Bell, a veteran of desert living after enduring Las Cruces,
N.M., before her move to Las Vegas in 2000, isn't impressed with her
fellow Las Vegans.</TE>
<TE>   "This town is watering streets and wasting water like I can't
believe," she says. "It's like going back in time 100 years. I can't
believe how backward they are."</TE>
<TE>   In Las Vegas, the heat is as constant as the neon. Summer
temperatures of 110 are not uncommon. Cars turn into ovens. Leaving
an air-conditioned building is like entering a sauna.</TE>
<TE>   "Hotter than hell," sums up Allean Blair, 65, as she sits inside
Derfelt Senior Center.</TE>
<TE>   The recent U.S. government report says that by 2100, global
warming will cause temperatures in Nevada to increase 5 or 6 degrees
in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say water waste is a sign that Las Vegas can't
manage its growth.</TE>
<TE>   "With dwindling water supplies, global warming and other factors,
I think Las Vegas will become the 'Apocalypse Now' of the American
West," says David Hogan, rivers program coordinator for the Center
for Biological Diversity.</TE>
<TE>   The city's growth must stop now for the city to survive, he says.</TE>
<TE>   But that would put Las Vegas in a battle against what made it what
it is. Stop growth and the image of an affordable city with a healthy
economy quickly would fade.</TE>
<TE>   City and county officials don't want to do that, so they're
changing the way the city grows.</TE>
<TE>   Compact development is being encouraged, so developers don't
"leapfrog" over vacant land.</TE>
<TE>   To help cool the city, new parking lots are required to have
trees. Front lawns of new homes can't be more than 50% grass.
Residents who rip out turf and install water-efficient landscaping
are rewarded with credits on their water bills.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says Clark County is in
serious violation of federal clean-air standards for dust and soot
pollution, mostly from construction activity and unpaved roads. The
county meets ozone regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Many scientists blame greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and
ozone for causing global warming, because the pollutants tend to trap
the sun's heat in the atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the senior center, talk centers on old Las Vegas, when you
could get from one side of town to the other in minutes, when water
was never an issue and cars didn't clog the highways.</TE>
<TE>   "When I grew up here, I saw the mountains every day," remembers
Linda Rolle, 45, a Las Vegas resident since she was 3. "And now, I
treasure the days I can see the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very selfish. I'd like to say, 'Stop. Don't let anybody else
in.' "</TE>

<HD>Alaska Voters to Consider Adding Instant Runoffs to
Elections</HD>
<DH>Politics: Backers say the plan would save money and boost
the chances of third-party candidates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JUNEAU, Alaska</DL>
<LD>Voters get to decide this week whether Alaska will become the first
state with instant runoff elections, something supporters say would
give third-party candidates a fighting chance.</LD>
<LD>   The initiative, appearing on Tuesday's gubernatorial primary
ballots, would replace Alaska's majority-vote election with
preferential voting similar to the method used in San Francisco city
elections and that used to elect lord mayor of London and members of
the Australian House.</LD>
<LD>   Voters would make their choices for an office in descending order
from most favored to least favored.</LD>
<TE>   If no candidate received more than 50% of the first-choice vote,
then the lowest vote getter would be defeated. Election officials
then would count the second-choice votes of voters who picked the
losing candidate and add those numbers to the totals for the
remaining candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The process would continue until one candidate received more than
50%.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, people are afraid to vote for anybody other than the
Republican and the Democrat," said Mark Chryson, chairman of the
Alaskan Independence Party. "This is to show you that you will not be
throwing your vote away."</TE>
<TE>   The measure is opposed by the Alaska League of Women Voters, in
part because it has drawn so little public debate, said league
President Cheryl Jebe. She said the move will be costly and complex.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears to compromise the well-established principle of one
person, one vote, established by the United States Supreme Court,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska has six recognized political parties and a long history of
independent voters.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Alaskan Independence Party and Democrats and
Republicans, the state recognizes Libertarians and the Green and
Republican Moderate parties.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska has never held an instant runoff election but has had
numerous elections in which the margin of victory was within just a
few percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Former Gov. Jay Hammond won his party's nomination in 1978 over
Walter J. Hickel by 98 votes--less than one vote per precinct.</TE>
<TE>   Current Alaska House Minority Leader Ethan Berkowitz first won
election to a House seat by 28 votes in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic Gov. Tony Knowles ends two terms having never won a
majority of the popular vote. He was first elected in 1994 by just
more than one vote per precinct over moderate Republican Jim
Campbell.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 52% of the state's registered voters classify themselves as
undeclared, nonpartisan or members of political parties other than
the six recognized state parties, according to the Alaska Division of
Elections. The state has 114,357 registered Republicans and 71,597
registered Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   The instant runoff would include state and federal elections but
would exempt the race for governor and lieutenant governor.</TE>
<TE>   The system would give voters more candidate choices and eliminate
the need for primaries and costly runoff elections, said Ken Jacobus,
a Republican attorney and petition organizer.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes sure that everyone who gets elected has a majority of
the voter support," he said.</TE>

<HD>Nevada Ponders Legalizing Possession of Marijuana</HD>
<DH>Drugs: Voters will decide the issue in November. Police
oppose the measure, which, if it passes, could add millions to state
coffers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>The state that legalized cathouses and craps is now considering
condoning cannabis.</LD>
<LD>   A voters initiative on the November ballot would permit possession
in Nevada of up to three ounces of marijuana--enough for 100 to 200
joints--by those 21 and older. They would be allowed to smoke it in
the privacy of their own homes, but not in their car or in public
places.</LD>
<LD>   While law enforcement officials are railing against the measure,
state officials are quietly pondering how the state-licensed sale and
taxation of marijuana might stoke the state's coffers by tens of
millions of dollars annually.</LD>
<TE>   Legalizing marijuana by amending the state Constitution is a
two-step process. If a simple majority of voters approve the measure
in November, it would need to be reaffirmed by voters in 2004. The
second vote could be avoided if the measure is adopted next year by
the Legislature, which already has decriminalized possession of
marijuana. That course is considered unlikely because most
politicians--including Republican Gov. Kenny Guinn--are not taking a
stand on the issue, saying they will defer to the voters' wishes.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada is one of nine states allowing use of marijuana with a
doctor's prescription, and one of 11 states that has lowered criminal
sanctions for marijuana possession. California also has done both.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio has the nation's most lenient marijuana possession laws,
issuing a civil citation and fining $100 for possession of up to 100
grams (about 3.5 ounces) of marijuana, according to the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.</TE>
<TE>   Only Alaska previously has attempted to legalize possession of
marijuana altogether. But even pro-pot proponents said the 2000
ballot measure went too far, because it didn't ban smoking in public
and it sought reparations for jailed marijuana users. The ballot
measure was defeated by 59% of the voters.</TE>
<TE>   State polls suggest Nevada voters are about evenly split on the
question. The state's largest newspaper, the Las Vegas
Review-Journal, has editorialized that the measure "would end the
needless harassment of individuals who peacefully and privately use
marijuana."</TE>
<TE>   Nevada may seem a logical place to test the issue because of the
state's renowned live-and-let-live philosophy, as already manifested
through its extensive gambling and rural houses of prostitution. And
as a practical matter, the debate can be financially waged in just
one media market here. Clark County is home to two-thirds of the
state's residents. But it is also its most unpredictable political
audience because of the region's explosive growth of non-Nevada
transplants over the last decade. Most of rural Nevada is
conservative; Las Vegas is not.</TE>
<TE>   The $375,000-petition drive, which collected more than 100,000
signatures to qualify the measure for the ballot, was spearheaded by
the Washington, D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project. One of its
policy directors, Billy Rogers, took a leave of absence to head the
local campaign under the moniker Nevadans for Responsible Law
Enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "Nevada is the only state in more than a decade to have passed
decriminalization legislation," Rogers said. "We believe we already
have a strong base of support in Nevada and that the Legislature
would give a good-faith effort to implement the necessary laws."</TE>
<TE>   Among public officials, the most vocal supporter of the measure is
Chris Giunchigliani, a schoolteacher and Democratic assemblywoman in
Nevada's part-time Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "We shouldn't be making criminals out of casual, at-home adult
users," said Giunchigliani, who last year successfully rallied
legislative support to reduce the penalty for possessing small
amounts of marijuana from a felony to a misdemeanor.</TE>
<TE>   "This measure is reasonably well-written and gets to the heart of
the matter: Our drug policy hasn't been working. We've created a
subculture of criminals among otherwise law-abiding citizens."</TE>
<TE>   If the initiative becomes law, state officials would have to
determine who would grow the marijuana (some suggest the state's
Agriculture Department), and how to make it available through
state-licensed retail outlets.</TE>
<TE>   The notion of mining marijuana sales as a state revenue source, as
the initiative calls for, is enticing, Giunchigliani said. "If people
are going to smoke it, we might as well tax it and get some funding
out of it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada, which does not tax personal or nongambling corporate
income, is casting about for additional state revenue, and the casino
industry is resisting perennial suggestions that its gambling profits
be taxed more.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to the marijuana initiative has not yet organized under
a single banner, but law enforcement officials throughout the state
are criticizing it.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most adamant is Dick Gammick, the Washoe County district
attorney in Reno.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't support legalizing any drugs until the Food and Drug
Administration says it's a beneficial drug that can be allowed in the
system," he said. "But for now, it remains a Schedule One controlled
substance, right up there with the most dangerous drugs we have."</TE>
<TE>   For a day or two, the pro-marijuana campaign rallied behind
reports that the state's largest police organization, the Nevada
Conference of Police and Sheriffs, had endorsed the initiative, as
its president had announced.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Anderson said that in telephone polling, the organization's
directors agreed that police officers believed it was a waste of
their time to go after small-time marijuana users. Immediately after
the news of the group's endorsement made local headlines, the board
members denied such a vote and said they were opposed to legalizing
marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson resigned in the controversy, but he maintains that he
clearly heard his colleagues' support of legalized marijuana. "When
we endorsed the proposal, a lot of pressure came down [from police
brass], and our guys got caught up in it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gammick said he is troubled by the message the marijuana
initiative sends to children. "We've been telling our kids--with
growing success--to stay off drugs. We're even hearing kids talking
proudly of drug-free schools. Now we want to make it legal for adults
to smoke pot? What are we telling our kids now?"</TE>
<TE>   But Giunchigliani countered: "People who raise that issue should
be looking at the parents who are smoking cigarettes in the home." As
to smoking marijuana in a home where children are living, "most
people have told me they wait until they put the kids to bed, sit
down and have a drag on a marijuana cigarette. They don't do it in
front of the children. Most parents are responsible."</TE>

<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of neo-Nazis and white separatists marched on the Capitol on
Saturday to protest U.S. support of Israel, chanting, "What do we
want? Jews out! When do we want it? Now!" and trading hostile words
with an equal number of counterdemonstrators.</LD>
<LD>   A variety of white supremacist groups--including skinheads from
Pennsylvania and separatists from West Virginia--carried giant Nazi
flags and frequently pumped their arms in the air yelling, "Sieg
Heil!" as they marched. They complained about non-European
immigration to the United States, shredded an Israeli flag and
chanted in support of Palestinian independence.</LD>
<LD>   The counterdemonstrators included students who said they had come
to preach peace; militants chanting, "Death, death, death to the
Nazis!" and anarchists dressed in black. They were joined by a
variety of others, including Palestinians who said they had come to
reject the white separatists' support for Palestinian independence.</LD>
<TE>   As many as 1,000 people demonstrated on each side, said Chief
Terrance W. Gainer of the U.S. Capitol Police.</TE>
<TE>   Police said their aim was to prevent the two groups from getting
close enough to harm each other. They were separated by about 1,000
police officers, metal barriers and plastic fencing. Some officers
marched in riot gear with batons drawn, while others were on
horseback or riding motorcycles.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said one man was arrested after he pried loose a large
cobblestone from the sidewalk at Union Station and hurled it toward
the white supremacists. The rock missed the demonstrators. Felipe
Benjamin Findley, 23, of Chicago was charged with disorderly
conduct/missile throwing and was released after paying a $50 fine,
the U.S. Park Police said.</TE>

<HD>Boycott Ends in Arkansas School District</HD>
<DH>Education: The leaders of the protest proclaim victory
after state and local officials hear complaints about board elections
and the poor condition of buildings.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LITTLE ROCK, Ark.</DL>
<LD>Leaders of a school boycott told parents Saturday to send their
children back to class, saying that the protest got state and
district officials to listen to their complaints about board
elections and school conditions.</LD>
<LD>   Parents in the Lee County School District should send their
children to school beginning Monday, the Rev. Agin Muhammad told a
community meeting of about 200. "It would serve us no benefit to
continue to keep our children out of school," Muhammad said. "This is
a victory we have achieved."</LD>
<LD>   Attendance at schools in the 1,750-student district in Marianna
had slowly built up from just 181 on the first day of school to 489
students on Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Parents in the poor, predominantly black district--where five out
of seven board members are white--say the election system favors
white incumbents over black candidates. However, board member
Phylista Stanley, who is black, says the race of board members is not
the root of the community discord; the board has had a black majority
in years past.</TE>
<TE>   Protest leaders also say they're concerned about poor conditions
in the school buildings, and that they have invited state and
district officials to visit the schools.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley spoke at Saturday's meeting and showed photos of restrooms
in the schools, including some with broken or missing toilets.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Simon, director of the state Department of Education, said
Saturday that an agency monitor has been on campus since school
started because the district is on the state's academic distress
list. He said he and the department were willing to help but that he
respects the authority of the local district to resolve what issues
it can first.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we'll certainly be available to offer assistance when we
feel our presence is appropriate," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Four residents sued the school board and various district
officials last week, claiming an unfair school board elections
process.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing is scheduled for Friday.</TE>

<HD>Friends Ponder Motive in Killings</HD>
<DH>Crime: Suspect blamed victim for recent breakup,
acquaintances say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WARSAW, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Naked and bleeding from a cut to her throat, a piece of duct tape
around one wrist, Carolyn Marksberry uttered a name as she collapsed
into a neighbor's house after a man killed two of her children and
wounded a third.</LD>
<LD>   "She was saying the guy's name--Marc Chapman," the neighbor, Mike
Schlachta, said Saturday, recalling how he was awakened early the
previous morning as Marksberry rang his doorbell and collapsed
inside.</LD>
<LD>   Marco Chapman, a youth soccer coach last fall in this Ohio River
town 45 miles southwest of Cincinnati, was arrested and jailed in
West Virginia, where he was awaiting extradition. Police in Kentucky
charged him with murder, assault and burglary in the attack that
killed Chelbi Sharon, 7, and her 6-year-old brother, Cody.</LD>
<TE>   Marksberry remained in critical condition Saturday at a Cincinnati
hospital. A 10-year-old daughter who survived the attack, Courtney
Sharon, was in fair condition.</TE>
<TE>   Marksberry had gone to Schlachta's home for help about 6 a.m.
Friday. As she was being put into an ambulance, Schlachta began to go
across the street to her house to check on her children when he
learned from police that there had been a multiple homicide.</TE>
<TE>   "I went down on the ground and started crying," Schlachta said.</TE>
<TE>   Marksberry's husband, Charles, a steel-company employee, was in
Spain for training at the time of the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I had told him, 'I'll keep an eye out on them,' " Schlachta said.
"I didn't do a very good job of that."</TE>
<TE>   Police have offered no motive for the attack, describing Chapman
only as an acquaintance of Marksberry.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and neighbors of Marksberry said Chapman had been dating
one of her close friends. That woman had broken up with Chapman
sometime before Friday's attack, said Lisa Asher, another of
Marksberry's friends.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard that he was upset about the breakup and blamed it on
Carolyn," Asher said. "I assume he felt she was the reason they broke
up."</TE>
<TE>   At the elementary school where Cody was a first-grader and Chelbi
a third-grader, snapshots of the two with classmates were pasted to
the wall above two small tables covered with white paper. Written in
black ink at Cody's table, one message read, "You're sweet smile will
always shine down on us."</TE>

<HD>Spending Isn't Best Measure of Caring</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CAMPBELL</AU>
<BD>John Campbell (R-Irvine) is an assemblyman.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My wife and I are the parents of two teenagers. Throughout their
lives, we have been confronted with the demands heard by parents
everywhere: "Daddy I want this." And the ever-present "Mommy can I
have that?"</LD>
<LD>   Usually, we answer no. We could afford to spend more money on
them, but for reasons apparent to most people, we don't. By all
accounts we have pretty good kids, and we think we have done an
acceptable job of parenting them.</LD>
<LD>   But if our parenting were judged by the same rules that work in
politics, we would be judged to be parents who "obviously don't care
about their kids." We might even be painted as inhumane and
heartless.</LD>
<TE>   You see, in the real world, spending more money is not the only
way to show that you care about something. In fact, spending more
money may result in spoiling the one you care about. Or it may be
covering up for the fact that you are unwilling to do what really
needs to be done to help that person or cause.</TE>
<TE>   Politics and government don't work that way. Over the last decade,
Democrats in Sacramento have led us into a political psyche that the
party that spends more cares more. If I am willing to spend more
money on education, I obviously care more about education than you
do. Conversely, if I believe we can spend less on social programs,
then I obviously care less about the poor.</TE>
<TE>   This mind-set has caused the largest deficit in California history
and is why we are facing multibillion-dollar deficits as far as the
eye can see. As long as the parties race to see which can spend the
most in order to show that it cares, we will never have fiscal
responsibility. We will always care about something with every dollar
we have, and we will never care enough.</TE>
<TE>   Are there other ways than money for government to show it cares? I
think so.</TE>
<TE>   One can care about education by wanting to reform the system so
that there is more local flexibility, more competition and more
recognition of merit. We can care more about health care by
eliminating employers and the government as the middlemen and
reconnecting the patient with health care and its cost.</TE>
<TE>   We can care more about the poor by supporting faith-based
organizations with a track record of cost-effectively helping people
with the selfless devotion that faith inspires.</TE>
<TE>   Others will show they care by throwing more money at the existing
decades-old system. But the only ones benefiting from this additional
spending are the government bureaucracies. They are the ones that
will raise the loudest hue and cry about not caring.</TE>
<TE>   The simple fact is that established bureaucracies and the
political contribution networks they have created are perpetuating
the mantra that those who spend more care more. But of course, they
are the beneficiaries of all this caring through higher salaries and
employment.</TE>
<TE>   Whether students, patients or the poor get any benefit is not of
consequence to these people. It is pernicious, but it is also
working. Real caring for those who use these systems involves the
courage to tear them down and start rebuilding. But the bureaucrats
don't want you to know that.</TE>
<TE>   The Beatles once sang that "money can't buy me love." The public
must come to understand that more money isn't the solution to all
public needs. Our budget woes will continue until we embrace the
concept that we can do more for less and that we can care about
things by trying to rebuild or reform institutions.</TE>
<TE>   The best parent is not the one who buys the most toys. And the
most caring government or politician is not the one that spends the
most money.</TE>

<HD>Political Switch in Anaheim</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED SMOLLER</AU>
<BD>Fred Smoller is chairman of the department of political
science at Chapman University and a member of the Orange County Human
Relations Commission.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tuesday night's decision by the Anaheim City Council to grant a
liquor permit that clears the way for Gigante USA's Mexican-themed
supermarket resulted from a perfect storm of political forces that is
unlikely to be seen again for some time.</LD>
<LD>   Not all that long ago, strong majorities of Orange County voters
supported state ballot initiatives to make English the official
language of California, end affirmative action and deny the children
of illegal immigrants access to school and health care. Orange County
was the home of Save Our State, the anti-immigrant group that erected
a sign at the California border warning illegal immigrants to stay
out.</LD>
<LD>   Opposition to people of color has taken other forms: declining
support for public schools that have seen a marked increase in Latino
children (the voucher campaign), opposition to bilingual signs at
John Wayne Airport and opposition to discount retail stores that
catered to the "wrong types of people."</LD>
<TE>   And, of course, it was the 1988 Curt Pringle/Tom Umberg state
Assembly race in which local Republican leaders, in an attempt to
galvanize their core voters, posted uniformed guards at heavily
Latino polling places in Santa Ana, along with signs warning illegal
immigrants not to vote. Conservative forces also worked hard to deny
the county's first Latino congresswoman, Loretta Sanchez, her seat in
the House of Representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Support, albeit diminished, for such sentiments remains, but it
didn't prevail in the Gigante case, in one of the county's more
conservative cities, for two reasons.</TE>
<TE>   First is the growing political power of Latinos. In 1980, census
figures show, 86% of the county was non-Latino white. Today, the
county has joined the state by becoming "majority-minority." One
result of this change is that Latinos are in the position to fight
back when attacked. Those, for example, who've tried to use Latinos
as political scapegoats for the state's economic and other
problems--notably former Gov. Pete Wilson and local Republican
leaders--have paid a heavy political price. Of greater significance
is the realization that this price will continue to grow.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Loretta Sanchez remains in Congress; Gaddi
Vasquez is head of the Peace Corps and everyone else who aspires to
political office--taking their cue from President Bush--is trying to
court the Latino vote. That includes Pringle, who is running for
mayor of Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the recent decision by Anaheim officials to deny Gigante a
liquor permit in a city that is 47% Latino created an unprecedented
protest blowback from the community.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the controversy split the pro-business libertarian and
socially conservative wings of the Republican Party. Libertarians
champion free enterprise and property rights and rail against Big
Government, so they were outraged by this brazen action of Anaheim
officials.</TE>
<TE>   The socially conservative Republican right--whether it admits it
publicly--is afraid of losing power and its culture as a result of
the increase in the number of Latinos in the community. No doubt
there are a number of socially conservative Democrats who agree.</TE>
<TE>   What I found interesting about the Gigante controversy is how the
liberal desire for diversity, racial tolerance and good relations
with Mexico--often achieved through government action--is, in this
case, best achieved by supporting the free market. If Gigante doesn't
cater to Anaheim's shoppers, then it will go out of business. Now
we'll find out who knows more about marketing tamales, a
redevelopment officer or the owners of a widely successful
supermarket chain.</TE>
<TE>   What really worried some Anaheim officials wasn't that Gigante
would fail, but that it would succeed.</TE>
<TE>   It was this unique combination of long-term trends and nature of
the issue that caused some rarely seen political alliances to form.</TE>
<TE>   We saw conservative Republican and former Assembly Speaker Curt
Pringle saddling up alongside Nativo Lopez, co-director of Hermandad
Mexicana Nacional, an organization that assists Spanish-speaking
immigrants, to speak before the Anaheim City Council in support of
Gigante. Liberal Democratic state Sen. Joe Dunn and conservative
Republican state Sen. Dick Ackerman co-wrote an article that did the
same. I even found myself, a proud liberal, exchanging e-mails in
agreement with libertarian Chapman University professor and newspaper
columnist Tibor Machan. We rarely speak, much less agree.</TE>
<TE>   With the opposition unified and the Republican Party split, the
City Council was forced to reverse the decision of the Planning
Commission. Whether such a unique amalgamation for political forces
will come together again remains to be seen.</TE>

<HD>Latinos Finding Nada on Library Shelves</HD>
<DH>Literacy: Just 10% of Santa Ana system's books are in
Spanish, which most residents speak. Officials point to scarce
resources.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Santa Ana's public library invited best-selling mystery writer
T. Jefferson Parker to speak several years ago, fewer than a dozen
people showed up. An appearance by Mexican television anchor and
author Jorge Ramos at a Latino bookstore downtown last October drew
3,000.A growing number of critics--ranging from educators and
businesspeople to library experts--say the comparison shows that
Santa Ana's library system is out of touch with residents in a city
deemed the most Spanish-speaking of its size in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   In a community where 74% of residents speak Spanish, the library's
Spanish-language book collection comprises only 10% of the books in
its three branches. Other cities with large Latino populations devote
as much as half of their collection to books in Spanish, some entire
branches.</LD>
<LD>   "Santa Ana is probably one of the worst cases in California" when
it comes to serving its residents, said Elizabeth Martinez, former
executive director of the American Library Assn.</LD>
<TE>   The city's librarians "accepted the mantra that they can't do
anything," said Martinez, a UCLA library science professor from
Newport Beach who is among several librarians who have monitored the
Santa Ana library for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Richard, library director since 1986, doesn't disagree. "The
library got fat, dumb and happy," he said. "It became irrelevant to
the residents, so the [city] council never heard what it needed."</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the small collection of materials in Spanish is part
of a broader problem with funding of Santa Ana's library.</TE>
<TE>   It ranks 142nd of the 178 library systems in California in per
capita spending. The library spends less per year on each city
resident--$12.51--than the cost of a bestseller.</TE>
<TE>   Library officials say they are doing the best they can given their
resources. But even after the city two years ago increased the
library's acquisition budget, only 17% of the book budget, about
$80,000, was spent on Spanish-language books this year.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, literacy advocates including Martinez--who has helped
libraries around the state develop programs for Latino patrons--say
Santa Ana could seek money from foundations and corporations to
improve its service to Latino residents, many of whom are poor and
largely uneducated immigrants from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin
America.</TE>
<TE>   Rueben Martinez of Martinez Books and Art Gallery, a Santa Ana
bookstore with a large Spanish-language collection, said the library
and its employees show little sense of excitement about books, which
is evident to people he has sent there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not so much the fact that the library doesn't have the books
they should," said Martinez, whose store hosted the overflow crowd
for Jorge Ramos. "No one makes you feel at home. You don't feel like
it's your library."</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro Moreno, a social worker who has helped unite troubled
families, says the library doesn't offer enough to recommend it as an
activity for his clients, as he used to do. "We don't feel welcome in
the libraries anymore," he said. "There is nothing for us."</TE>
<TE>   "The library often doesn't have what I'm looking for--it's out,
it's lost, it's just not there," said Ana Maria Salas, 45, an
immigrant who was a schoolteacher in Mexico. Instead, she shares
books she buys from Martinez with her friends.</TE>
<TE>   Libraries are not required to offer books in foreign languages,
but many do because they want to foster literacy.</TE>
<TE>   The American Library Assn. advocates that libraries serve
communities no matter what their dominant language. The association's
bill of rights stresses that encouraging literacy serves a public
good. "We are supposed to serve everyone and provide services without
barriers--be they fees or languages," said Maurice J. Freedman, the
organization's current president.</TE>
<TE>   Freedman noted that free public libraries were established in the
1850s--in great part to help immigrants become more literate and more
productive in their communities. Even then, collections included
newspapers in other languages, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone in Santa Ana city government believes the city should
supply Spanish-language texts or boost library participation.</TE>
<TE>   "I would question whether it is the city's duty to provide
materials that mirror the demographics of the city," said City
Councilman Jose Solorio, son of migrant farm workers who has a
master's degree from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of
Government. "If we go to another country, should we expect to see
books in English?"</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Alberta Christy, a bank consultant, said the city has
increased the library system's budget "as much as we possibly can."
She said that in the age of the Internet, fewer books are needed,
even for small children.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are 3 or 4 years old, you go on the Internet to Nickjr.com
[and] you have stories there. It's teaching them to read the words
and hear the stories," Christy said.</TE>
<TE>   Cities such as Miami and Los Angeles have tried harder to reach
out to Latino communities. In Kansas City, Mo., more than 50% of the
books in some library branches are in Spanish. In San Jose, an entire
branch is devoted to Spanish-language books and materials. Librarians
there hope to raise money by serving coffees from Latin America and
pan dulce.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana's libraries are concentrated near downtown and the
western edge that borders Garden Grove, but there are none in the
more heavily Latino southern part of the city. Richard dreams of
opening another branch, but says that would be nearly
impossible--he'd need $4 million, plus land in a built-out city.</TE>
<TE>   Because of a budget constraints, Richard said he has "written off"
adults in favor of promoting youth programs. "It's very difficult to
change adult habits, but if we can get kids off to a good start, we
can make them lifelong readers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana library's greatest successes have been with youth. .
This year, library officials say, children made 30,000 visits to a
reading club and 50,000 to a homework program at the branches. The
library also offered a math club, a Spanish-language story-time, even
a recent teen pizza party. There are more Spanish-language
story-times in Santa Ana than any library in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Free story times, puppet shows and movies rotate among the
branches about five days a week. Two bookmobiles also travel to
neighborhoods far from the branches.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, some Latino parents interviewed say the offerings are
limited. "There isn't much here in Spanish, but we are happy to find
anything to help our children," said Marisol Jimenez, who had her
three children--4, 2, and 1--in tow on a recent trip to the city's
central branch. "We'd like more books in Spanish for children. You
want to read to them so they get ahead, and we [parents] can't read
enough English."</TE>
<TE>   Heninger Elementary School Principal Kathy Sabine said more
Spanish and bilingual books would help parents who speak little
English to read to their children.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, students learning English can increase their literacy
by reading in their native language.</TE>
<TE>   Brooke Stewart, recently-appointed library board president, who
successfully lobbied the council for more funds, agrees that more
needs to be done, and said she hopes to convince city officials, who
juggle a variety of demands for city funds.</TE>
<TE>   "For years and years, the library board didn't seem to do much,"
Stewart said. "I started wondering if all we were supposed to do was
approve minutes.... I think we are seeing that if we make noise, we
can get something done."</TE>

<HD>Big Tobacco Is Cursing the Day This Expert Witness Took the
Oath</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first witness called to the stand in Department 19 of Los Angeles
Superior Court was a natty, bushy-browed chap of 89. Sir Richard Doll
had flown from England for this moment, and though he is frail and
bent by age, he sent a shudder through the dark heart of Big Tobacco
the second he took the oath.</LD>
<LD>   Doll, an epidemiologist, spoke elegantly and with great modesty of
the work for which he had been knighted by the queen of England.
Prodded by the attorney for a Newport Beach woman who is dying of
lung cancer and has sued the Philip Morris Cos., he told a medical
detective story that began in 1949.</LD>
<LD>   Great numbers of Londoners were being diagnosed with lung cancer
at that time, and doctors were stumped as to the cause. But Doll had
a hunch.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought it was something to do with the tar in the roads," he
said from the witness stand last week. There had been such an
expansion of paving in England of the 1940s, it was the only thing
that made sense.</TE>
<TE>   But when Doll set out to examine 700 patients who had been
discharged from hospitals with a preliminary diagnosis of lung
cancer, he made a discovery that startled him.</TE>
<TE>   "If the patient was a nonsmoker, the diagnosis of lung cancer was
almost always wrong," he told a rapt jury in the courtroom of Judge
Warren Ettinger.</TE>
<TE>   Doll, who had smoked cigarettes for 20 years, immediately quit and
implored his wife to do the same. He also stepped up his research,
and published a groundbreaking 1950 report contending that "smoking
is a factor, and an important factor, in the production" of lung
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   A smaller study in the United States reached similar conclusions.
But both were met with skepticism from doctors and the public. By
1956, though, Doll had convinced most of the world's scientific
community that he was right.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, the stooped, white-haired man who took the witness
stand last week is still David to Big Tobacco's Goliath. Doll got in
his first shot in 1949, and yet seven tobacco executives stood before
Congress in 1994 and claimed under oath that there was no scientific
proof that smoking causes lung cancer.</TE>
<TE>   That shamelessness, which has lured millions of people to early
death, has kept Doll on the case for half a century. Going on 90,
he's still investigating tobacco's role as one of the greatest
killers man has known.</TE>
<TE>   "Cigarette smoking is the most significant cause of death in
developed countries," Doll testified, and kills as many people as all
other causes combined.</TE>
<TE>   Dignified, affable and decorated with honors, Doll is a tobacco
lawyer's worst nightmare. He sits there with noble countenance and
solid science, his virtue unimpeachable, and wins the day. By the
time he was done answering questions from the plaintiff's lawyer, the
Philip Morris attorneys might as well have been representing Genghis
Khan.</TE>
<TE>   One of them rose, and in the gentlest way, led Doll to acknowledge
that the Newport Beach smoker could have reduced her cancer risk by
heeding warnings and kicking the habit. A few minutes later, the
attorney rested and slid back into his seat.</TE>
<TE>   If the trial goes the way several others have recently, Big
Tobacco is in Big Trouble. A devastating trail of dirty documents
that surfaced in the 1990s will be dragged out, establishing that the
industry hid knowledge of health risks.</TE>
<TE>   Outraged juries have stung tobacco for huge payouts. Michael
Piuze, the attorney for the Newport Beach woman, won a $3-billion
punitive judgment in a similar case last year. It was later reduced
to $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't quite dawn on me, until I left the courtroom with Doll
last week, whose company I was keeping. I was with a man who arguably
has helped save millions of lives, and I couldn't immediately think
of another person, living or dead, about whom I could say such a
thing.</TE>
<TE>   We glorify actors and make heroes of jocks, and the man who made
one of the most significant finds of the 20th century remains
virtually anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   Although an estimated 2 million people die annually from
smoking-related causes worldwide, the proportion of male smokers in
the United States and England has been roughly halved in the past
half century.</TE>
<TE>   "Sir Richard Doll is a giant in the field, and perhaps the father
of the science upon which all tobacco-prevention efforts are based,"
says Matt Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
"There aren't a lot of people I stand in awe of. But of Richard Doll,
I do."</TE>
<TE>   Doll remained modest as we chatted. For him, science speaks for
itself, and adding ego or politics is not a gentleman's way. When I
suggested his work helped save countless lives, he answered with
nothing more than a gleam in his eye. He said he respects the right
of Big Tobacco to sell cigarettes, but believes the industry
shouldn't be allowed to advertise, particularly if the marketing is
aimed at teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-five anti-tobacco lawsuits are pending in California. One
can argue, Doll acknowledged, that smokers help dig their own graves.
But it's all the more difficult to quit, he said, when tobacco
industry policy for decades was to "spread doubt about the harmful
effects of smoking."</TE>
<TE>   The motive, Doll said, was nothing other than greed. So
billion-dollar judgments against Big Tobacco are OK by him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they've been thoroughly immoral, and they deserve
whatever they get."</TE>

<HD>Owens Valley Deal Is in Jeopardy</HD>
<DH>Water: An agreement to restore 61 miles of river is hung up
over how much water Los Angeles needs and how big a pump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A dispute over the size of a pump is jeopardizing an agreement
between the city of Los Angeles and the Owens Valley that had been
supposed to ease nearly a century of discord over water policy.</LD>
<LD>   The argument centers on a plan to use water from the Los Angeles
Aqueduct to restore 61 miles of the lower Owens River. Some of that
water would then be pumped from the reborn river back into the
aqueduct. The sticking point is how much water and how big a pump the
city needs for the task.</LD>
<LD>   The 61-mile stretch has been mostly dry since 1913, when nearly
its entire flow was diverted into the newly constructed aqueduct.
That engineering feat gave Los Angeles the water it needed to grow
into a modern metropolis, but it effectively killed the lower river
and caused Owens Lake to dry up.</LD>
<TE>   The current disagreement between the Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power and Inyo County, which includes the Owens Valley, has
led to delays in a state-required environmental analysis of the river
restoration plan. The delay has prompted the Sierra Club and an Owens
Valley conservation group to sue both the Department of Water and
Power and Inyo County. According to the terms of an agreement signed
in 1997 by the DWP, Inyo County and the environmental groups, the
restored Owens River was supposed to flow again in 2003. All sides
concede that is unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists have contended that the DWP is stalling to keep
Owens Valley water for the city.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, the need for L.A. to have water is no excuse for the DWP to
not live up to their obligations," said Mark Bagley, an Owens Valley
resident and Sierra Club activist.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP has responded that the larger pump it wants would simply
allow Los Angeles to retrieve water it is entitled to.</TE>
<TE>   "Every single issue that comes up, they want me to get less
water," said Jerry Gewe, the DWP's assistant general manager for
water. "Basically, they want us to put in the smaller pump so there's
no possibility of getting that extra water back."</TE>
<TE>   The decades-old fight over Owens Valley water heated up in 1970,
when the DWP finished the second Los Angeles Aqueduct. To fill it,
the agency began sinking groundwater wells on land it owns throughout
the valley.</TE>
<TE>   The water table beneath parts of the valley dropped and springs
began drying up. In 1972, Inyo County sued Los Angeles, demanding a
study of the wells' environmental effects.</TE>
<TE>   The case dragged on until an agreement was struck in 1991 and then
revised in 1997, when Los Angeles promised to do what was once
unthinkable: restore the lower Owens River. In exchange, the DWP
could continue to pump ground water--a major source of water for the
city--and recover some of what it had put back into the river.</TE>
<TE>   The river's new flow would be a fraction of its historic carrying
capacity. But there would be enough to save native cottonwoods and
willows, provide habitat for four species of endangered fish, and
create opportunities for anglers to pursue trout and bass.</TE>
<TE>   On paper, both sides thought they had a good deal. L.A. would get
its water, the valley would get its river back. But soon the two
sides began arguing about the "pumpback station."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists and Inyo County water officials say the DWP
agreed in the 1991 deal to a station that could pump 50 cubic feet of
water per second. The DWP has acknowledged this, but said it is
entitled to pump 150 cubic feet per second under a later agreement
that it made to put more water in the lower Owens.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Prather of the Owens Valley Committee, a conservation group,
said he fears the larger pump would be a "Trojan horse."</TE>
<TE>   He said he believes the DWP is secretly planning to sink more
groundwater wells, and would need the larger pump to move that water,
along with the river water, into its aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Coufal, the DWP's aqueduct manager, said that Prather's
scenario "doesn't make any sense" and that there are no current plans
for more wells. But he didn't rule out more groundwater pumping in
the valley, providing that it wouldn't hurt the environment.</TE>
<TE>   The Environmental Protection Agency weighed in last February, when
Janet Parrish, a monitoring officer, wrote that the bigger pump would
be economically impractical, given the small amount of water it would
recover for Los Angeles, unless the DWP planned to drill more wells.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP said the economics do make sense: When it looks around
California, it doesn't see any new water sources.</TE>
<TE>   The city's take of Owens Valley water has fallen precipitously in
recent years. Though the valley once provided about 75% of the city's
water supply, it will send roughly 40% this year. Most of the rest
comes from far Northern California and from the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP and Inyo County are finally scheduled to issue the
environmental study of the river project in September. But the study
will still offer two options for the project: a small pump and a big
pump. So, the dispute will probably end up back in court.</TE>

<HD>Island of Calm in Whirlwind of D.A.'s Office</HD>
<DH>Law: Bill Redmond has built a reputation for dependability
and integrity as gatekeeper for 25,000 Ventura County cases a year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County prosecutor Bill Redmond, once a genial national park
ranger at Alcatraz, remains an island of calm amid the crush of
criminal cases he directs as legal gatekeeper in the district
attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   For the last two months, Redmond, 46, has supervised both the
misdemeanor and general felony units of the 10th-largest prosecutor's
office in California. Before his appointment, two people oversaw the
office's 20,000 misdemeanor and 5,000 new felony cases a year.</LD>
<LD>   For felonies alone, that's 20 new cases a day. Redmond analyzes
each one, assigns a lawyer and helps decide what charges to file and
what penalty to seek.</LD>
<TE>   Redmond and 27 other attorneys handle the load, down from a staff
of 44 for the same duty a decade ago, even though the number of cases
is up 27%.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the type of job [that] if he hesitates or is indecisive, the
cases and issues just pile up," said Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Greg
Totten. "He makes decisions all day long. It's one of the toughest
jobs in the office."</TE>
<TE>   Redmond stands out, however, not because of the job he holds, but
by the way he holds it.</TE>
<TE>   In a high-pressure office where top managers are not always
beloved, Redmond is embraced.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was in the middle of battle and I had to pick one person to
be in a trench next to me, I'd pick Bill," said fellow Deputy Dist.
Atty. Ernesto Acosta. "He's loyal to his friends and he'll back you
up. He makes you feel good about doing your job."</TE>
<TE>   In a profession known for its rabid advocacy, even defense lawyers
say Redmond seeks justice.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not in the business of tooting the horn of prosecutors," said
defense lawyer Kevin DeNoce, a former prosecutor himself. "But you
can talk to Bill, and that's not code for 'Bill gives good deals.' It
means you get a fair hearing."</TE>
<TE>   In an office torn apart this spring by a bitter race to decide who
will succeed retiring Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, Redmond was
the only top prosecutor to decline to sign an advertisement endorsing
Totten, the odds-on favorite and eventual winner.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a big supporter, but he did it behind the scenes," Totten
said. "He took his responsibility as a prosecutor first. To me, that
is a measure of the man."</TE>
<TE>   Redmond is known as a straight shooter who works hard, filling in
for his staff members in court when they are sick and regularly
rolling out of bed when police need to serve a late-night search
warrant.</TE>
<TE>   But if one trait defines Redmond--a stocky 6-footer with the
square-jawed mug of an Irish cop--it is his knack for thinking before
he speaks.</TE>
<TE>   When Redmond finds himself in a tight spot, when he senses his
anger rising or his good humor failing, he remembers his firefighter
father.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't rush into burning buildings," Redmond said. "You don't
want to be in the flames wondering do I turn right or do I turn left.
You need to step back before you step in."</TE>
<TE>   One measure of Redmond's cool is a poster attached to the front of
his office door in the county courthouse in Ventura. For several
years, the "Billometer" posted by an underling has alerted colleagues
to his moods.</TE>
<TE>   They move Redmond's mug shot from one end of a scale to another,
from pale white to bright red.</TE>
<TE>   At 7:55 a.m., for example, a low-pressure Billometer reading
alerts colleagues to "Be Prepared to Hear About Alcatraz Island or
Days As a Park Ranger." As the day progresses, however, the chart
describes Redmond this way: "Lips Don't Move When Talking. Eyes Don't
Move."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I've ever made it all the way to the far end,"
Redmond said with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   No-Nonsense Family</TE>
<TE>   Redmond is the third of four sons born to Peter and Rose Redmond,
a 35-year San Francisco firefighter and a career clerk in the city's
data processing department.</TE>
<TE>   Raised in the blue-collar Mission District and educated at strict
Jesuit schools, Redmond said his was a no-nonsense family that got up
and went to work. A good student, he graduated from San Francisco
State University in 1979 with a political science degree and a desire
to teach high school civics and coach sports teams.</TE>
<TE>   But teaching jobs were scarce, so he parlayed his summer
employment as a supervisor with the U.S. Youth Conservation Corps
into a job with the National Park Service. After stints at Point
Reyes and Alcatraz he moved to the Santa Monica Mountains National
Recreation Area, where he became expert in flora, fauna, fires and
trailhead mediation among hikers, bikers and horseback riders.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, a 30-year-old Redmond enrolled in Ventura College of Law
night school, and the next year joined the Ventura County Probation
Department in charge of 80 troubled juveniles in group homes and
boys' schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I visited each one every month," he said. "First I'd chew them
out, then I'd spend the next half hour shooting baskets and talking.
To those kids, I was both mom and dad. I loved that job."</TE>
<TE>   But in 1990, Redmond passed the State Bar of California exam. And
Totten, whom Redmond had impressed with his questioning in a law
school class, hired him. By 1997, after prosecuting misdemeanors,
fraud and embezzlement, juvenile crime and drug cases, Redmond was in
charge of the general felony unit and its two dozen lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   He has done that job, essentially, ever since, but now with the
misdemeanor responsibilities as well.</TE>
<TE>   A recent meeting headed by Redmond suggested the pace at which he
and his lawyers make decisions. It was a regular Friday session
called to analyze the strength of felony cases once a judge decides a
suspect should be held for trial.</TE>
<TE>   Front-line lawyers evaluate their own cases, then Redmond and
other senior prosecutors ask questions and offer advice. A decision
is reached on what charges to drop and which ones will go to trial.</TE>
<TE>   "Give us the nickel tour," Redmond says to Daniel Feldman, a
three-year prosecutor from New York. The meeting takes only a few
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman said later that he likes Redmond's fatherly mentoring. A
few days earlier, Redmond had canceled his schedule for half a day to
walk Feldman through the quickest way to get an arrest warrant for a
robbery suspect.</TE>
<TE>   "When he's in one of those situations, he calls you 'lad,' "
Feldman said. "He says, 'Pay attention, lad, this is an education
moment.' "</TE>
<TE>   Not a Softie</TE>
<TE>   But Redmond is nobody's patsy, Feldman said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you meet with him, you have to make sure you have prepared,"
Feldman said. "If you haven't, you won't want to be around him. He'll
remind you why you were hired."</TE>
<TE>   Redmond doesn't want to be thought of as softie, especially by
defense attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   "We're supposed to be holding the bad guys accountable for their
crimes, and we do," he said. "There are cases where we absolutely go
after the maximum penalty: a drunk driver, I'm going to put him away
as long as I can. He took someone's life because he wanted another
beer."</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, after a new law allowed the prosecution of young
teenagers as adults, Redmond's unit got an attempted murder
conviction against a 14-year-old Oxnard gang member who shot three
kids who had given him a hard time at school. The sentence was 34
years to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "When someone uses a gun or a knife I'm at my most inflexible,"
Redmond said.</TE>
<TE>   But there are also cases where people commit crimes that are out
of character and a response to some singular disruption in their
lives: "We'll consider that too in the penalty or rehabilitation."</TE>
<TE>   Redmond is married to former probation officer Terry Redmond, whom
he met on the job. He says his goal is to work another decade in the
district attorney's office, then see the world with his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Others say he might want to readjust his sights.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd vote for him in a second for district attorney or for judge,"
said veteran defense lawyer Louis Samonsky.</TE>
<TE>   "He's bright and he just has that certain something that gets the
job done well without irritating people," Samonsky said. "Even if you
don't get what you want, you feel you've been dealt with fairly.
That's a good characteristic for a judge, let alone a D.A."</TE>

<HD>Boat Cleanup Plan May Be Falling Short</HD>
<DH>Air: Many of the vessels refitted with more efficient
engines in a multimillion-dollar plan to reduce smog are often not in
L.A. Harbor area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A multimillion-dollar drive to reduce heavy smog around the ports of
Los Angeles and Long Beach may be missing the mark, officials
concede, because boats undergoing the cleanup are frequently gone
from Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   California air quality officials have spent $25 million over the
last four years on clean technologies for tugboats, ferries,
commercial fishing boats and "yard hostlers" that move cargo
containers. New engines, which burn diesel fuel more efficiently and
cut smog-forming emissions by up to 80%, have been installed in 139
vessels.</LD>
<LD>   Boats that have been equipped with the new engines are supposed to
operate near the Los Angeles coast most of the time, but many don't,
air quality officials acknowledge.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, officials say they do not keep close track of where the
vessels are. Boat operators are required to keep logs and submit
annual reports for review, but so far the South Coast Air Quality
Management District has not looked closely at the records, said Chung
S. Liu, the district's deputy executive officer.</TE>
<TE>   The adjoining ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach make up the
largest single source of air pollution in the region and the least
regulated.</TE>
<TE>   Boats and cargo ships release about 50 or more tons of
smog-forming emissions daily--more than one-fifth the amount emitted
by all the cars in the region. Pollution is expected to increase in
the next two decades as ship traffic grows by an estimated 70%, air
quality officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "The ports are clearly one of the largest sources of air pollution
in our region," said Barry R. Wallerstein, the AQMD's executive
officer. "Cleaning them up is one of the most difficult and complex
environmental challenges in the nation."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping tabs on vessels based at the port is part of that
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the seafaring tugboats are deployed to haul sand from Baja
California or steel parts from the Pacific Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   One tugboat, the Larcona, has spent much of the last year in
Ventura helping to build a new breakwater at the mouth of the harbor
there. Another, the Kahu, hauled sand-filled barges to San Diego and
pushed barges along the coast near Lompoc last year, though it is
required to "be used within the Long Beach/Los Angeles port area"
under a provision of a contract with the AQMD that paid $459,000 for
new engines on the vessel, AQMD and Coast Guard records show.</TE>
<TE>   When air quality officials held a news conference Tuesday in Long
Beach to tout the program, they had to schedule the event to coincide
with the arrival of the clean-running tugboat Joe Sause from San
Francisco Bay. Officials say the boat is permitted to spend up to 25%
of its time outside of California waters.</TE>
<TE>   Dale Sause, president of Oregon-based Sause Bros. Ocean Towing
Co., said his six tugboats that were refitted with new engines
through California clean-air programs operate only in California
waters and mostly in the Los Angeles area. However, officials at the
nonprofit Marine Exchange of Los Angeles/Long Beach Harbors, said
Sause Bros. tugboats are open-ocean tugs, used not for pilot work in
harbors, but for pushing barges of lumber, heavy equipment and raw
materials along the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't do any assist work. For the most part, they are doing
offshore work, towing up and down the coast. They are in the port of
L.A. and Long Beach less than 10% of time," said Dick McKenna, deputy
executive director of the exchange, which monitors vessel traffic at
the harbors.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike traditional regulatory approaches, the current cleanup
strategy relies on incentives, voluntary cleanup and public-private
partnerships, because state and local agencies have limited authority
over the ports.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has primary authority
over ship exhaust. Although the EPA has recently enacted emission
standards for the first time, they apply only to new vessels and
won't begin taking effect until 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, area businesses pay for the cleanups in lieu of funding
carpool programs for their employees, and in some cases businesses
earn smog credits for their efforts. Some of the cleanup is funded by
penalties that energy companies have paid for producing excessive air
pollution during the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists, who criticize California's smog-fighting
programs for relying more on incentives than regulatory edicts, say
the boat cleanup program needs improvement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very good program that has some very big flaws," said Todd
Campbell, policy director of the Coalition for Clean Air.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe the district can adequately monitor these boats.
They are doing the best they can with the resources they have, but
it's not easy to enforce a program this complex."</TE>
<TE>   Wallerstein, the AQMD chief, acknowledged the boat cleanup program
is "a work in progress." But he defended the program, saying
California air quality benefits whether the vessels operate near Los
Angeles Harbor or elsewhere along the coast.</TE>
<TE>   Ships and boats burn a grade of diesel fuel that contains about 40
times more sulfur compounds than allowed in fuels for trucks and
other heavy-duty equipment used in California.</TE>
<TE>   An AQMD study two years ago showed that diesel exhaust poses a
cancer risk for harbor area residents 1,000 times greater than
regulatory standards typically allow.</TE>
<TE>   Air quality officials are beginning to take steps to strengthen
the boat cleanup program.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 2, the AQMD governing board rescinded $1.8 million in
funds for marine cleanup projects because of concerns about where and
how vessels would operate and how emissions reductions are
calculated. The money instead will be spent to replace diesel-powered
irrigation pumps primarily in the Inland Empire.</TE>
<TE>   About one-third of the vessels that have been cleaned up have been
equipped with tracking devices to record their hourly movements, and
more vessels will be required to carry the device in years ahead, Liu
said. And in October, the AQMD is scheduled to consider rule
amendments to require the destruction of dirty, old engines once they
are removed from a boat.</TE>

<DH>Coast Guard: Maintaining massive navigation buoys is
dangerous and dirty work, but this bunch of riggers loves it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While most of the U.S. Coast Guard is preoccupied with homeland
defense, Lt. Bion Stewart, the skipper of the George Cobb, has
something other than Islamic terrorists on his mind--Lighted Bell
Buoy No. 1 off Anaheim Bay.</LD>
<LD>   The 7.5-ton navigation aid that marks the harbor entrance lands on
the tender's rolling deck with a thud. Its 26 feet of counterweight,
hull and bright green tower almost span the vessel's beam.</LD>
<LD>   Within an hour and a half, eight crew members scour a thick
blanket of mussels from the cylindrical hull. They check the light
system and replace 90 feet of worn mooring chain before carefully
lowering the huge buoy back into the sea. It's gritty, dangerous
work.</LD>
<TE>   "This might seem insignificant to many people," Stewart said. "But
there is nothing else in the Coast Guard I'd rather do than work a
buoy tender. We see the fruits of our labor every day, and it's a
good feeling to do something that helps."</TE>
<TE>   Stationed in the Port of Los Angeles, the Cobb is responsible for
maintaining 224 navigation, weather and scientific buoys from San
Diego to San Francisco. About 75 of them are moored in waters off
Port Hueneme, Orange County and the Los Angeles-Long Beach harbor
complex, the third-largest port in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the Coast Guard maintains about 50,000 navigation aids in
the United States and U.S. territories.</TE>
<TE>   They include buoys, beacons, lighthouses, radar deflecting devices
and sound signals such as foghorns, whistles and bells.</TE>
<TE>   The aids help mariners and boaters safely navigate the nation's
waterways, lakes, ports, coastal waters and shipping channels. They
warn of hazards and expedite the movement of cargo ships in busy
commercial harbors.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the devices in good repair falls on Coast Guard crews and
a fleet of 68 vessels that range in size from 65-foot river tenders
to 225-foot oceangoing craft that can handle the largest buoys. The
tenders also can be used for search-and-rescue, law enforcement,
recovery operations and responding to oil spills.</TE>
<TE>   Their functional design isn't much to look at, however.</TE>
<TE>   The Cobb's boxy superstructure, gaping buoy deck and squat black
hull lack the grace of the Coast Guard's sleek patrol boats and
handsome oceangoing cutters. The 175-foot ship tops out at only 12
knots, and the tender's flat bottom and shallow draft cause a
nauseating pitch-and-roll during heavy seas.</TE>
<TE>   But what the Cobb lacks in glamour it makes up for in risk. With
any kind of swell, buoys weighing up to 10 tons can become massive
wrecking balls if not properly hoisted and controlled.</TE>
<TE>   Taut winch cables and mooring chains with links the size of
footballs can snap or slide across the deck, crushing bone and
lacerating flesh.</TE>
<TE>   The giant concrete blocks that anchor buoys to the bottom can
weigh more than 4 tons.</TE>
<TE>   "There's lots of heavy equipment, lines and chains on deck," said
Boatswain's Mate 1st Class Gary Cavallo, who supervises buoy
operations. "When it's rocking and rolling out there, the work is
dangerous and challenging. But it is satisfying."</TE>
<TE>   About 45 minutes after getting underway on a late August morning,
the Cobb arrives off north Orange County to service two buoys that
mark the entrance to Anaheim Bay, home to hundreds of pleasure boats
and the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station. Both are moored about
three-quarters of a mile from the jetty.</TE>
<TE>   As the tender pulls alongside Lighted Bell Buoy No. 1, a dozen
seals lounging on the green hull slip into the water and regroup 20
yards away to watch for a few minutes. The sea is calm, and there is
a slight breeze out of the west.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen up," Cavallo shouts to his crew of seven riggers. "Let's
be safe. Let's not rush, but we need to be efficient. OK?"</TE>
<TE>   The group includes Boatswain's Mate 3rd Class Jerry Morfin; seamen
Chris Hurley, Jaime Alvarez and Carl Barlow; and seamen apprentices
Kim Booth, Cole Mason and Matt Young.</TE>
<TE>   Their dark blue overalls, orange life vests and black work shoes
are stained and caked with grime. There is little military formality,
and most of them address each other by their first names, even their
supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Cavallo makes crew members check their hard hats, chin straps,
safety glasses, knives, life jackets and steel-toed boots. Before
hoisting the first buoy on deck, the riggers huddle like a football
squad and extend their hands into the center.</TE>
<TE>   "Mud rats!" they yell.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes they pull the buoy onto the port side with boat
hooks and attach a line to the top of the tower.</TE>
<TE>   Next, the buoy is leaned over on its side so that the crane's
block and tackle can be fastened to the hull.</TE>
<TE>   By 11:10 a.m., Machinery Technician 1st Class Joe Twiddy, the
crane operator, slowly lifts the 7.5-ton buoy out of the water and
places it on deck, where a winch coaxes the steel structure onto a
set of wooden chocks. Using a sledgehammer, a rigger then pounds a
head block into place under the buoy's hull before everything is
lashed down with four lines.</TE>
<TE>   As Alvarez tries to secure the exposed mooring chain to a pulley,
the ship's movement causes the big links to slide across the deck
toward him. Young pulls his shipmate quickly out of harm's way by his
life jacket. No one is hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The buoy is encrusted with more than 3,000 pounds of mussels,
urchins and starfish that fill the air with a strong briny odor. The
growth, more than a foot thick in places, is removed with scrapers
and high-pressure hoses, scattering slippery organic debris
throughout the work area.</TE>
<TE>   By now, the buoy deck is filled with a cacophony of sledgehammers,
clanking chain, pneumatic wrenches and a whining power saw used to
cut open master links that connect lengths of mooring chain. Orange
sparks rain across the deck.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," said Chief Warrant Officer Dan Twomey, the Cobb's
executive officer, who has worked on buoy tenders for half of his
14-year career. "As an enlisted man, I got out of it for a while, but
when the opportunity arose again, I took it."</TE>
<TE>   Twomey is on the port side of the bridge, two decks above the
buoy.</TE>
<TE>   He keeps the Cobb in position with the help of global positioning
satellites, computers and a small joystick connected to one of the
most sophisticated propulsion systems available--Z-Drive.</TE>
<TE>   The Cobb, which went into service two years ago, has no rudder.
Instead, it is equipped with bow thrusters and two aft propellers
that can pivot. The ship can move sideways or rotate 360 degrees,
ideal for buoy tending.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of maneuverability was unheard of aboard the aging
Conifer, a World War II-era buoy tender that the Cobb replaced.</TE>
<TE>   The Conifer had a crew of 50 compared to the Cobb's 24, and the
vintage ship took much longer to perform some of the same tasks.</TE>
<TE>   The Cobb's navigation systems are so accurate it can reset a buoy
within three meters of the spot where it was removed.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to take one or two hours to get back on station by manual
triangulation," Twomey said. "It was a real challenge."</TE>
<TE>   On deck, the crew replaces 90 feet of the light buoy's mooring
chain with a technique they have dubbed "heat and beat." The pin of
the new master link is heated with a blow torch until red hot.</TE>
<TE>   Then Young and Morfin take turns smashing the softened steel with
sledgehammers. They look like a pair of railroad workers driving
spikes.</TE>
<TE>   After the electrical system and batteries are tested, Lighted Bell
Buoy No. 1 is ready to be lowered back into the sea.</TE>
<TE>   The crane operator puts tension on the line and the lashings are
removed.</TE>
<TE>   "Live buoy!" Cavallo yells. "Stand clear."</TE>
<TE>   The crane operator slowly lifts the navigation aid slightly off
the deck and eases it over the port side into the water. All lines
and tackle are removed before the Cobb backs away.</TE>
<TE>   "Buoy's clear," Cavallo says. "Good job this time. Good job."</TE>

Chris Hurley, Jaime Alvarez and Carl Barlow; and seamen apprentices
Kim Booth, Cole Mason and Matt Young.</TE>
<TE>   Their dark blue overalls, orange life vests and black work shoes
are stained and caked with grime. There is little military formality,
and most of them address each other by their first names, even their
supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Cavallo makes crew members check their hard hats, chin straps,
safety glasses, knives, life jackets and steel-toed boots. Before
hoisting the first buoy on deck, the riggers huddle like a football
squad and extend their hands into the center.</TE>
<TE>   "Mud rats!" they yell.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes they pull the buoy onto the port side with boat
hooks and attach a line to the top of the tower. Next, the buoy is
leaned over on its side so that the crane's block and tackle can be
fastened to the hull.</TE>
<TE>   By 11:10 a.m., Machinery Technician 1st Class Joe Twiddy, the
crane operator, slowly lifts the 7.5-ton buoy out of the water and
places it on deck, where a winch coaxes the steel structure onto a
set of wooden chocks. Using a sledgehammer, a rigger then pounds a
head block into place under the buoy's hull before everything is
lashed down with four lines.</TE>
<TE>   As Alvarez tries to secure the exposed mooring chain to a pulley,
the ship's movement causes the big links to slide across the deck
toward him. Young pulls his shipmate quickly out of harm's way by his
life jacket. No one is hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The buoy is encrusted with more than 3,000 pounds of mussels,
urchins and starfish that fill the air with a strong briny odor. The
growth, more than a foot thick in places, is removed with scrapers
and high-pressure hoses, scattering slippery organic debris
throughout the work area.</TE>
<TE>   By now, the buoy deck is filled with a cacophony of sledgehammers,
clanking chain, pneumatic wrenches and a whining power saw used to
cut open master links that connect lengths of mooring chain. Orange
sparks rain across the deck.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," said Chief Warrant Officer Dan Twomey, the Cobb's
executive officer, who has worked on buoy tenders for half of his
14-year career. "As an enlisted man, I got out of it for a while, but
when the opportunity arose again, I took it."</TE>
<TE>   Twomey is on the port side of the bridge, two decks above the
buoy.</TE>
<TE>   He keeps the Cobb in position with the help of global positioning
satellites, computers and a small joystick connected to one of the
most sophisticated propulsion systems available--Z-Drive.</TE>
<TE>   The Cobb, which went into service two years ago, has no rudder.
Instead, it is equipped with bow thrusters and two aft propellers
that can pivot. The ship can move sideways or rotate 360 degrees,
ideal for buoy tending.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of maneuverability was unheard of aboard the aging
Conifer, a World War II-era buoy tender that the Cobb replaced.</TE>
<TE>   The Conifer had a crew of 50 compared to the Cobb's 24, and the
vintage ship took much longer to perform some of the same tasks.</TE>
<TE>   The Cobb's navigation systems are so accurate it can reset a buoy
within three meters of the spot where it was removed.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to take one or two hours to get back on station by manual
triangulation," Twomey said. "It was a real challenge."</TE>
<TE>   On deck, the crew replaces 90 feet of the light buoy's mooring
chain with a technique they have dubbed "heat and beat." The pin of
the new master link is heated with a blow torch until red hot.</TE>
<TE>   Then Young and Morfin take turns smashing the softened steel with
sledgehammers. They look like a pair of railroad workers driving
spikes.</TE>
<TE>   After the electrical system and batteries are tested, Lighted Bell
Buoy No. 1 is ready to be lowered back into the sea.</TE>
<TE>   The crane operator puts tension on the line and the lashings are
removed.</TE>
<TE>   "Live buoy!" Cavallo yells. "Stand clear."</TE>
<TE>   The crane operator slowly lifts the navigation aid slightly off
the deck and eases it over the port side into the water. All lines
and tackle are removed before the Cobb backs away.</TE>
<TE>   "Buoy's clear," Cavallo says. "Good job this time. Good job."</TE>

<HD>Tiny-Book Publisher Is Losing Her Vision</HD>
<DH>Collectibles: Age-related condition will force closure of
Pennyweight Press, which has produced 530 miniature titles in 27
years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In her tiny world, no one looms larger than Barbara Raheb.</LD>
<LD>   The Agoura Hills woman is the nation's biggest little-book
publisher. Her leather-bound volumes have thumbnail-size pages with
lines of printed type so small that they can be covered by a shirt
thread.</LD>
<LD>   Coveted by serious collectors and dollhouse hobbyists alike, the
530 microminiature titles she has produced over the last 27 years
measure 15/16 of an inch high and 5/8 of an inch wide--about the size
of a small matchbox. Many are colorful pop-up storybooks that contain
minuscule cutouts of playful animals, trees and characters such as
pirates that come to life when pages are turned.</LD>
<TE>   No wonder there were gasps when collectors learned that Raheb was
closing her Pennyweight Press publishing house because she is going
blind.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't be doing any more books," said Raheb, 69. "I can't see
the pages. I can't read the type."</TE>
<TE>   Her vision loss is due to age-related macular degeneration, the
leading cause of blindness for people older than 60. Those with the
malady find that the central portion of their field of vision is
covered by a gray blob. All that is left is peripheral vision.</TE>
<TE>   Raheb's eyesight failed suddenly. She was working on a
French-English version of "The Owl and the Pussycat" when the writing
in front of her became distorted.</TE>
<TE>   "I was typing the text for it, and the words got real tiny and the
sentence seemed to be going downhill," she said. "My eyes felt
scratchy."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors discovered that Raheb was experiencing the "wet" form of
macular degeneration, characterized by leaking blood vessels in the
eye. They used a laser treatment to stabilize the bleeding.</TE>
<TE>   Raheb learned that she was a likely candidate for macular
degeneration because she has blue eyes and is nearsighted--so much
so, in fact, that in the past she could easily read her little books
without eyeglasses.</TE>
<TE>   Those with light-colored eyes and myopia seem to be more often
afflicted with the disease than others.</TE>
<TE>   Desperate to continue working, she purchased a $3,000 electronic
magnifier that uses a television camera and TV screen to enlarge text
printed in books and other materials. But Raheb was horrified to find
that even at 50-times magnification she still could not read the tiny
type in her beloved books.</TE>
<TE>   She tried for a time to assemble her miniature volumes by touch.</TE>
<TE>   She set up her boxy Optelec magnifier on the mahogany table
beneath her dining room chandelier and painstakingly attempted to
hand-color minuscule illustrations on printed galley sheets with
watercolors.</TE>
<TE>   In her upstairs workroom, she tried to operate the hand press that
stamps the titles on the cover before the pages are hand-stitched to
the binding. She devised a template to show her by feel where to
position the guillotine cutter that trims the pages. She struggled to
properly position the 5-pound piece of marble that presses the
finished books into their closed position.</TE>
<TE>   But she couldn't see how her finished books looked. When her
sister and niece examined the copies, they decided that about half
were acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   To Raheb, that was not acceptable: "I couldn't even cut straight
lines. I was through."</TE>
<TE>   Also finished was Raheb's next project. She had purchased a
guilding iron and was planning to include fore-edge painting that
would be visible on the sides of pages of an upcoming book. That kind
of illustration has never been done on a microminiature book, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I had grandiose plans. I'm a very visual person," she said.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Raheb is fielding phone calls and letters from
longtime clients who are ordering copies of her old books and
lamenting the closure of Pennyweight Press. Her books, which were
mostly printed in editions of 300, sold for $28 to $250.</TE>
<TE>   "It's terrible. Nobody in the world does what she does," said Joan
Lorson, whose Lorson's Books in Fullerton has stocked Raheb's books,
including her four-volume, 456-page "The Hound of the Baskervilles"
by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.</TE>
<TE>   While a professional lithographer handled the printing, Raheb did
everything else--"typesetting, the coloring, the binding, the layouts
and stamping," Lorson said. "It's heartbreaking she has quit."</TE>
<TE>   Closter, N.J., resident Grace Broecker is one of the country's
major collectors of microminiature books. She owns more than 600 of
Raheb's volumes.</TE>
<TE>   "I was devastated when I heard about her eyesight. I couldn't
believe it could happen to her," said Broecker--who is in the process
of donating a collection of Raheb's books to the Huntington Library,
Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino.</TE>
<TE>   That library already had 50 of Raheb's books in a 3,500-volume
collection of miniatures donated 10 years ago by Msgr. Frances J.
Weber, an author and expert on miniature books who is a historian
with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt Barbara's books are so unique they should be somewhere
people can study them," Broecker said.</TE>
<TE>   Worries about the quality of future books have prompted Raheb to
turn down offers to sell her little publishing house.</TE>
<TE>   A different owner of Pennyweight Press is something else she can't
see.</TE>

<HD>Garcia's Homer Beats Mariners</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Cleveland Indians are starting to make game-winning home runs
look routine.</LD>
<LD>   And they're doing it at the expense of the Seattle Mariners'
postseason chances.</LD>
<LD>   Karim Garcia hit a two-run homer in the bottom of the ninth inning
Saturday, giving the Indians a 5-3 victory over the Mariners.</LD>
<TE>   The homer came 16 hours after rookie catcher Josh Bard capped his
major league debut with a two-run homer that lifted the Indians over
Seattle, 4-2, on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Bard also homered in his first at-bat Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners have lost six of nine and fell two games behind the
American League West-leading Oakland Athletics.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a time to panic. This is just a little bump for us.
These things happen," Mariner second baseman Bret Boone said. "We
have to come out and beat somebody up."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia was given the bunt sign after Matt Lawton walked to start
the ninth against Doug Creek (2-2). Garcia missed the bunt attempt.</TE>
<TE>   "Karim's not a guy who has bunted a lot in his career, so we took
him off that," Manager Joel Skinner said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia hit the next pitch, an inside fastball, to right field for
his fifth homer.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia and Bard are among 20 players the Indians have called up
from triple-A Buffalo. Bard is among eight players to make their
major league debut this season with the Indians.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners threatened in the ninth, but Lawton threw out Jeff
Cirillo, who tried to score from second base on Dan Wilson's single
to left field.</TE>
<TE>   Starter Danys Baez held Seattle hitless for 5 2/3 innings, then
fell apart, giving up four consecutive hits, including a two-run
homer to Mike Cameron.</TE>
<TE>   Baez got out of the inning with help from second baseman John
McDonald, who dived into short right field to grab a hard-hit
grounder and throw out Mark McLemore.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians took a 1-0 lead in the third as Bard picked up where
he left off Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   The catcher hit a 406-foot drive into the left-field bleachers
after Jamie Moyer had retired the first seven batters.</TE>
<TE>   New York 3, Texas 2--Jason Giambi's tiebreaking homer in the
bottom of the seventh inning helped Roger Clemens earn his 291st
career victory.</TE>
<TE>   Clemens (11-4) gave up Alex Rodriguez's major league-leading 45th
home run in the first inning, then held the Rangers in check through
the seventh. Clemens struck out nine.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 6, Kansas City 5--Denny Hocking hit three doubles and
Cristian Guzman extended his hitting streak to 22 games to help lift
the Twins at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Guzman has the longest current string in the majors and the
longest for the Twins since Marty Cordova's 23-game streak in 1996.
Guzman doubled and singled. He is batting .366 (34 for 93) during the
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 4-8, Baltimore 1-3--Chris Woodward and Vernon Wells
homered to back a solid pitching performance by Esteban Loaiza, and
the Blue Jays completed a doubleheader sweep at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   In the first game, Pete Walker (7-3) gave up four hits in seven
innings to end Baltimore's four-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, Tampa Bay 2--Frank Thomas, Carlos Lee and Joe Crede
homered at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Wright (9-11) matched his career high with eight strikeouts
and overcame a couple of rough spots to win for the second time in
his last five starts.</TE>

<HD>Hudson Keeps Tigers at Bay</HD>
<DH>Baseball: A's hit three homers and two triples in 12-3
victory over Detroit, their 11th win in a row.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The Oakland batters gave Tim Hudson more than enough support.</LD>
<LD>   Ray Durham hit two triples and David Justice, Eric Chavez and
Terrence Long homered, and the Oakland Athletics won their 11th in a
row, defeating the Detroit Tigers, 12-3, Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   "It's nice to see that our bats have really stayed consistent for
about a week," Chavez said. "It's hard to explain. We're just
swinging the bat real well."</LD>
<TE>   The Athletics have scored 66 runs in their last eight games. But
it's the pitching that has carried the A's to a two-game lead in the
American League West over Seattle and the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson (11-9) won with his third complete game this season.
Hudson, along with fellow starters Barry Zito, Mark Mulder, Cory
Lidle and Aaron Harang, equaled a feat that hadn't been accomplished
in 46 years.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time that a starting staff posted 11 consecutive
victories since Bob Buhl, Lew Burdette, Gene Conley, Ray Crone and
Warren Spahn did it for the Milwaukee Braves in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   The Athletics jumped on Jose Lima (4-6) for 11 runs in 2 2/3
innings.</TE>
<TE>   "Great way to get started, huh?" Oakland Manager Art Howe said.
"Guys swinging the bat."</TE>
<TE>   Durham led off with a triple and scored on Scott Hatteberg's
sacrifice fly. Miguel Tejada doubled and scored on Jermaine Dye's
one-out single. Justice homered over the right-field fence to make it
4-0.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit rallied in the bottom of the first with a two-run single
by Robert Fick to pull within 4-2.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland added four runs in the second on Tejada's run-scoring
single and Chavez's 30th homer, a three-run drive.</TE>
<TE>   The Athletics scored three runs in the third inning on Durham's
two-run triple and a run-scoring single by Hatteberg.</TE>
<TE>   Long hit his 13th home run leading off the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson gave up eight hits, walked one and struck out seven.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kind of feeling for it the first two innings," Hudson said.
"Kind of felt my effort level was maybe too high....But I backed off
a little."</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>As all baseball-loving kids in New England did, Gary DiSarcina came
to Fenway Park to root for the Boston Red Sox. As a little boy, he
called the place "Friendly Park" because that's what he thought the
announcers said.</LD>
<LD>   He always dreamed of playing for the Red Sox. But the Angels
drafted him, and he served with distinction, their starting shortstop
from 1992-99. After two injury-riddled years, he was let go by the
Angels. He signed a minor league contract with the Red Sox, hoping to
play one game for his hometown team in friendly Fenway.</LD>
<LD>   Some dreams do not come true. He suffered a broken finger in
spring training, his shoulder still hurt, and he hit .243 as a
part-time second baseman at triple-A Pawtucket. He retired last
month, at 34, without regrets.</LD>
<TE>   "The gas tank was empty," he said. "There are other things in
life."</TE>
<TE>   DiSarcina brought his two kids to Fenway on Saturday, visiting
with his former Angel teammates and attending his first game here as
a fan since he was a kid. He might get into coaching someday, but for
now he is happy living on Cape Cod, hanging out with the family and
checking the Angels' box score first thing each morning.</TE>
<TE>   And how does he compare this year's Angels to his '97 and '98
teams that faltered in August and September?</TE>
<TE>   "They have a little better pitching," he said, his eyes twinkling
at the thought of Disney's old periwinkle-and-pinstripes costumes,
"and better uniforms. They look like a big-league team now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Infielder Chone Figgins, called up from triple-A Salt Lake to
replace injured outfielder Tim Salmon, said he stayed up all night
Thursday calling family and friends with news of his promotion, left
his Oregon hotel at 3:45 a.m. to catch a 6 a.m. flight and arrived at
Fenway at 5 p.m. Friday. On his first day in the major leagues, he
didn't play and didn't stop smiling.</TE>
<TE>   "To sit in the dugout, with Pedro Martinez on the mound and the
crowd yelling, and in a pennant race, it doesn't get any better than
that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With Salmon not expected to return by the time rosters expand next
Sunday, Figgins figures to remain with the Angels for the rest of the
season. The Angels plan to add another relief pitcher next Sunday,
and another outfielder if Salmon is not ready. After the Salt Lake
season ends--or sooner in case of injury--they will consider adding
another catcher, infielder and one or two pitchers.</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Angels returned reliever Mark Lukasiewicz to Salt Lake
to clear a roster space for Callaway, working on seven days' rest
after the Angels decided to promote him from Salt Lake to replace the
injured Aaron Sele in the starting rotation. Callaway won his first
major league start, for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 1999, did not win
any of his other three that year and has not started a major league
game since. He has not given up more than two earned runs in any
start this season; in his last four, he has pitched 26 innings,
striking out 26 and walking four. Lowe, the American League's
starting pitcher in the All-Star game, is 5-0 with a 1.30 ERA in his
last seven starts.</TE>

<HD>Appier Plays It Fast and Loose</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Angels' free spirit throws six shutout innings in
a key 2-0 victory over Red Sox.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Angels had the perfect antidote for pennant pressure. On a day
they desperately needed to win, their starting pitcher was their
resident goofball.</LD>
<LD>   Baseball etiquette demands that teammates stay away from that
day's starting pitcher, to let him prepare in solitude. Kevin Appier
wanders up to anyone who will listen--teammates, coaches, reporters,
clubhouse attendants--to chat and poke fun at people.</LD>
<LD>   "You try to stay away from him," third baseman Troy Glaus said,
"but he won't let you."</LD>
<TE>   With baseball's equivalent of Alfred E. Neuman on the mound--what,
him worry?--the Angels had no need for concern Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Appier never dominated, but he never surrendered, dancing through
six shutout innings with little margin for error in the Angels' 2-0
victory over the Boston Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels got one earned run off Boston knuckleballer and nemesis
Tim Wakefield, and that was good enough on a day they played smart
and played well.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels stole three bases--one despite a Boston pitchout--and
turned a season-high four double plays. The bottom two hitters in the
lineup, Adam Kennedy and Jose Molina, each singled home a run. First
baseman Scott Spiezio added to his Gold Glove portfolio, saving one
hit with a diving catch and another with a terrific stretch, and
turned a line drive into a double play.</TE>
<TE>   The best bullpen in the American League supported Appier with
three shutout innings--one each from Brendan Donnelly, Scott
Schoeneweis and Troy Percival--and the Angels reclaimed a share of
the lead in the AL wild-card race. They're tied with the Seattle
Mariners and 2 1/2 games ahead of Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Are the Angels watching the scoreboard? "We definitely are,"
Appier said.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with the possibility of losing to Wakefield on Saturday and
Derek Lowe today and falling behind Boston in the wild-card
standings, the Angels rebounded after losing three of the first four
games on this trip.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think our confidence has been shaken," Manager Mike
Scioscia said. "Maybe it has been tested, but it hasn't been shaken.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to go away. We're confident we're going to be a
playoff team."</TE>
<TE>   With Aaron Sele on the disabled list, Appier is the only Angel
pitcher to start a playoff game. That postseason experience, and 12
years of major league experience, enable him to control the
nervousness he freely admits precedes any start this time of year.</TE>
<TE>   That experience also enables him to act as his own pitching coach
at times, to make corrections on the fly, a valuable skill for any
pitcher and especially so for one with such an awkward delivery.</TE>
<TE>   "The impression you get at times is that he's out of sorts,"
pitching coach Bud Black said. "But pitch to pitch--knowing hitters,
knowing situations and knowing his stuff---this guy is as good as
anyone I've ever been around."</TE>
<TE>   For the third consecutive game, Appier walked the first batter on
four pitches. He threw 25 pitches in the first inning, 35 in the
fifth.</TE>
<TE>   "Every fifth or sixth pitch, I had no idea where the ball was
going," he said. "It was on its own program."</TE>
<TE>   Appier (12-9) joined Jarrod Washburn (15-5) in giving the Angels
two 12-game winners for the first time in five years. In his last
nine starts, Appier is 6-2 with a 2.37 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   In his first season with the Angels, he has been indispensable, on
the mound and in the clubhouse, as a mentor to younger pitchers and
as a carefree spirit. Percival calls him a "nut case" on the days he
starts.</TE>
<TE>   Said Glaus: "He's different, but it's about whatever it takes to
get yourself as comfortable as you possibly can.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's hiding in the corner, hide in the corner. If it's
standing on your head, stand on your head."</TE>
<TE>   No, Glaus said, he has not seen Appier stand on his head before
one of his starts. He was merely saying that. But there's still one
month left in the season, and you never know.</TE>

<LD>As it was transpiring, amid the dueling conference calls, as Rob
Manfred and Don Fehr were firing salvos at each other and listeners
wondered if either of the negotiators had ever been in the same room,
let alone across the same table from each other, the temptation was
to shout, "Stop it children, go stand in the corner."</LD>
<LD>   I mean, talk all you want about regressive proposals, as
management lawyer Manfred did in ripping union leader Fehr's
proposals on revenue sharing and payroll tax Saturday, how about
regressive behavior? How about talking to each other behind closed
doors instead of talking about each other to reporters?</LD>
<LD>   Incredible.</LD>
<TE>   Six days before the union's strike date, with the ghosts of eight
previous work stoppages to keep them company (well, there have only
been eight previous bargaining negotiations), Manfred and Fehr proved
that the industry has learned little about keeping its business
private.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it was all about image and public relations Saturday,
about who said what when, and while it may only have been posturing
and not a fatal bump in the path of a settlement before Friday (after
all, the sides are expected to be back negotiating today), it
shredded the last measure of civility from talks that had been
conducted amid a comparatively improved atmosphere, and it left
conference call operators working overtime.</TE>
<TE>   First, there was Manfred conducting his daily briefing with
reporters across the nation, saying the union's tax and revenue
sharing proposals represented "raw regressive bargaining" and that he
couldn't have been more disappointed or shocked.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Fehr conducting a conference call in response,
saying the union proposals were clearly not regressive, that he was
mystified as to how Manfred could be shocked and that if he had
problems with the proposals he should have discussed it across the
table rather than going to the media in another of his series of
attempts to influence the public and convince people (and the courts,
perhaps, if the owners ultimately try to unilaterally implement new
work rules) that they have been negotiating in good faith.</TE>
<TE>   If that should have been the end of it, guess again.</TE>
<TE>   Manfred couldn't resist having the commissioner's PR staff notify
reporters that he would have another conference call to respond to
Fehr.</TE>
<TE>   This time, as reporters ran out of paper and the batteries in
their tape recorders died, Manfred said that part of what the union
was proposing was "intellectually incomprehensible," that Fehr's
knowledge of what has been said at the table was limited because he
has frequently been absent while conducting his "summer tour" of all
30 teams and that he was "getting a little tired of Don telling
everyone what I should and should not have known" about what had or
had not been said during negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Think about it. Some three hours after beginning his first
conference call, Manfred ended his second, but not before he was
asked if the process hadn't been hurt by Saturday's public debate.</TE>
<TE>   His response was not without some final shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the union proposals helped us, I don't think Don
angrily walking away and taking a 10-day hiatus [without making a tax
and revenue sharing proposal] helped us, and, in all honesty, I don't
think these conference calls helped us," Manfred acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   So, what does it all mean? Where does it all stand?</TE>
<TE>   Well, it's still all about money.</TE>
<TE>   It's still all about the union's desire to limit the financial
damage to the high-revenue teams that drive the salary market.</TE>
<TE>   It's still all about the owners' desire to gain a measure of
control over salary growth through a payroll tax while significantly
increasing revenue sharing to improve the competitive chances of the
low-revenue teams.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Manfred said he would prepare a response to the
union's proposal, even though he didn't know how to respond to a
proposal that went backward, and that they probably will meet again
today would indicate that the process will continue and there is
still a shot at settlement before Friday's walkout.</TE>
<TE>   Fehr and Manfred are familiar with the verbal slings and arrows.</TE>
<TE>   The larger question is, can they close what now seems to be a
suddenly larger gap on revenue sharing and a still sizable gap on the
payroll tax, not to forget steroid testing and the worldwide draft
among other significant issues?</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of Saturday's blowup seemed to be the fact that the
union's proposal called for its revenue sharing numbers to be phased
in, the full transfer in the fourth year.</TE>
<TE>   Manfred said he hadn't known about any phase-in until Saturday and
that, because of the phase-in, the amount of revenue transferred to
the low-revenue clubs in the first two years of the union plan was
only minimally more than what was being transferred in the expired
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Fehr countered that Manfred has known of the phase-in since
mid-summer of 2001 and that the phase-in is necessary to give the
high-revenue clubs time to adjust their operation.</TE>
<TE>   "With due respect, Mr. Fehr hasn't ever run a club, so I'm not
sure how he would make that judgment," Manfred said. "He should stop
worrying about my clients."</TE>
<TE>   He also said that his "absolute nightmare scenario" was better
than what the union proposed Saturday, but enough of the rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't Fehr playing the piano for reporters in the lobby of
the Arrowwood Resort in Rye, N.Y., while he waited for an owners'
proposal during a futile negotiating session in 1994, but it
definitely was one of the more exasperating, colorful and potentially
combustible days in baseball's long, exasperating and combustible
labor history.</TE>
<TE>   How it affects the next five days remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the kids will come out of the corner and remember what's at
stake.</TE>

<HD>Owner Not the Only Militant Padre</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Labor File....</LD>
<LD>   * So, San Diego Padre owner John Moores, a leader of the militant
corps, said he is prepared to sit a season rather than ratify a bad
labor deal.</LD>
<LD>   How prepared?</LD>
<TE>   Well, Moores is ranked 14th in Fortune Magazine's list of the
"Greedy Bunch," having recently cashed in $646 million worth of stock
in his troubled software company.</TE>
<TE>   * Never afraid of a little controversy, Padre union representative
Phil Nevin told the San Diego Union-Tribune that owners are simply
"billionaires who need to have their messes cleaned up. It's hard for
me because our owner is one of the hard-liners. I love John to death
[but] they knew what they got into when they came here. I hate to say
it, but if you can't handle it, get out."</TE>
<TE>   Moores had a private little chat with Nevin and came away
suggesting that all players are simply puppets under union leader Don
Fehr, comparing it to Communists in the old Soviet Union. Moores said
that if the strike issue was put to a secret ballot "you'd find that
most players don't have the stomach" for it and added (with some
validity?) "they do what Fehr tells them to do. They'd be running the
bases backward from now on if Donald Fehr asked them to."</TE>
<TE>   * Of course, a year off might help Moores' Padres reorganize that
Master Plan that was supposed to have them competitive by 2004, when
they move into their new ballpark. The Master Plan has seemed to
disintegrate, if the 2002 standings and the fact that they have used
a major league-record 33 pitchers this season are any indication. To
be fair, injuries have contributed to that record, prompting the
Padres to do more force-feeding than any nursery.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm like a proud papa," pitching coach Greg Booker said. "Bring
'em on. The more the merrier. In North Carolina we say two's company,
and 33 is ... oh, well, you finish it."</TE>
<TE>   That's what Manager Bruce Bochy would like to do, be able to get
past the strike date and finish the season to see just how many
pitchers he can try to build some unity around.</TE>
<TE>   "Forty's easy," Bochy said. "Give me a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   * Texas Ranger owner Tom Hicks was floating on his yacht off San
Diego (you don't suppose he had dropped in for a little lunch and
strategizing with Moores) when he chose that rich man's setting to
preach his recent bit of hypocrisy, saying "a majority of owners,
including me, would probably like to have even stronger
cost-containment" than management negotiators have proposed.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, Hicks now realizes he needs help in controlling
himself. This is the same guy who blew the salary scale apart with
his $252-million signing of Alex Rodriguez, then compounded it with
the $65-million signing of Chan Ho Park, the $22-million signing of
Juan Gonzalez and the $16.5-million investment in journeymen pitchers
Jay Powell and Todd Van Poppel.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers have a $105-million payroll ($131 million for luxury
tax purposes) and are about to join the lamentable New York Mets as
the first teams with payrolls of more than $100 million to finish
last in their divisions, and Hicks is now saying it's the system that
doesn't work.</TE>
<TE>   Funny how the system works with good management. He could check
out the division-leading Oakland A's and Minnesota Twins as two
examples of how to get a real bang for your bucks.</TE>
<TE>   * It's his own distinguished career that former commissioner Fay
Vincent has tended to demean with his ongoing harangues and
criticisms of Bud Selig, such as those in Friday's editions of The
Times. Vincent was forced from office in 1992 by a coalition of
hard-line owners led by Selig, and it's as if he can't let it go.</TE>
<TE>   "He comes across as a bitter old man," said Rich Levin, baseball's
senior vice president of public relations. "I was very close to Fay,
but I'm disgusted. He was outsmarted by Bud 10 years ago, and it's
still bothering him.</TE>
<TE>   "He ought to remember how angry he would get when [former
commissioners] Bowie Kuhn or Peter Ueberroth would question or
criticize what he was doing. I mean, can you give me one thing he
accomplished as commissioner?"</TE>
<TE>   * Selig's beloved (and still family-owned) Milwaukee Brewers, who
Moores said are like the Padres' twin sister (which must mean both
are suffering from similar parental abuse), are another sad team that
might just as soon see the season end Friday.</TE>
<TE>   If it doesn't, the Brewers are headed for 100 losses for the first
time in a once-proud franchise history, an attendance drop of more
than 800,000 in only the club's second year in Miller Park and the
firing of Manager Jerry Royster (likely no matter when the season
ends).</TE>
<TE>   It's all just a little more rain on Selig's already soaked parade,
and that doesn't take into account the leaks in the Miller roof. So
much water poured through in a sudden storm Wednesday night that the
appropriately named pitcher Ben Sheets said, "We almost had a rainout
in the dome."</TE>
<TE>   * Free speech is wonderful, but isn't it time that Fehr puts the
same gag rule on his players that Selig has put on the owners
(although someone is going to have to show me those canceled checks
to prove he really fined Moores and Hicks $1 million for saying what
some believe he encouraged them to say)?</TE>
<TE>   I mean, the players might have some justification in thinking the
owners have backed them into a corner again, that they have to stop
the process on their own terms before the owners impose a lockout and
new work rules in the off-season, but the migraine kicks in every
time one of them says, "None of us wants to strike, but ... "</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>

<LD>St. Louis Cardinal pitcher Matt Morris was placed on the 15-day
disabled list Saturday because of a strained left hamstring.</LD>
<LD>   Morris, a 22-game winner last season who is 15-7 this year for the
National League Central leaders, hurt himself trying to beat out a
grounder Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "It was an idiotic play by me," Morris said. "I was just trying to
beat out a routine out. Sometimes, I can't control that intensity
when I'm in a game."</LD>
<TE>   Said Manager Tony La Russa: "It was stupid. I admire him, but it
was stupid."</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate word on how long Morris would be sidelined.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee designated catcher Raul Casanova for assignment, meaning
the club has 10 days to trade or release him if he doesn't accept a
demotion to the minors, which he said he won't.... Houston put
outfielder Richard Hidalgo on the 15-day disabled list because of a

<LD>What's a macho stock car driver doing with Drakkar Noir cologne as a
sponsor?</LD>
<LD>   When Jack Wiswall, president of L'Oreal USA was looking to
rejuvenate the Drakkar brand, he said, "People told us, if you want
the 18-35 demographics, you have to have Dale Jr."</LD>
<LD>   So Dale Earnhardt Jr. is showing up these days at perfume counters
wearing a black T-shirt and jeans, causing stampedes.</LD>
<TE>   "He's been fantastic," Wiswall said after a chorus of screams
greeted the Winston Cup driver at the Herald Square Macy's in
Manhattan as he worked his way through a police escort and a squad of
bodyguards. "He's a special kid, very gentle. He speaks well, he
looks the part. He's cool."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: The last time the Boston Red Sox won a World Series
was 1918. Who were their winning pitchers?</TE>
<TE>   The way it's done: Curt Schilling has won 21 games and has walked
only 20 batters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's command," the Arizona Diamondback pitcher explained.
"Control is the ability to throw strikes. In the big leagues,
everybody has control. Command is the ability to throw quality
strikes. And when you add preparation to command, good things will
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Schilling has a compact disc on which he records every pitch he
has thrown to a major league batter. He even keeps track of each
umpire's strike zone.</TE>
<TE>   Opening day: Since 1978, of the 330 NFL teams that won their
opening games, 176 went to the playoffs and 95 won division titles.
Of the 330 losers, 76 went to the playoffs and 42 won division
titles.</TE>
<TE>   That was Chick: Times reader Gordon Grigg saw Chick Hearn and his
wife Marge standing in line at the post office on White Oak Avenue in
Encino a few months ago. When the person in charge learned that the
Hearns were there, he came out and offered to move them to the front
of the line. Hearn said no, thanks, that they'd just wait in line
like everybody else.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) plans to introduce a bill to
have that post office named after Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   Working tradition: Ron Adamson is quarterback of Mount Union,
winner of the last two Division III national titles. Besides throwing
passes and running the offense, Adamson washes the team's uniforms.
It's a tradition at the Alliance (Ohio) school, which offers no
athletic scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Ballard, quarterback of the 1993 Purple Raiders, started
washing uniforms. Every starting quarterback since has performed the
task.</TE>
<TE>   "They all want the job now," said Ballard, now quarterback of the
Indiana Firebirds in the Arena Football League.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Babe Ruth and Carl Mays. Ruth beat the Chicago
Cubs, 1-0, in the first game and 3-2 in the fourth. Mays won the
third and fifth games.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Nebraska's cheerleaders have been grounded. No more
acrobatics and tumbling across the end zone. A new policy prohibits
off-the-ground stunts to reduce injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big disappointment," said Kellie Bowman, co-captain of the
Cornhuskers' Spirit Squad. "Cheerleading has been more than just
standing there, waving pompoms."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Nebraska agreed to a $2.1-million settlement with a
former cheerleader paralyzed in a 1996 accident.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kendyll Pope and Jerel Hudson stopped Iowa State quarterback Seneca
Wallace at the goal line on the final play Saturday night, giving No.
3 Florida State a wild 38-31 victory in the Eddie Robinson Classic at
Kansas City, Mo.</LD>
<LD>   It was a historic victory for Seminole Coach Bobby Bowden, who
passed Bear Bryant on the career victory list with 324. He trails
only Penn State's Joe Paterno (327) on the Division I list.</LD>
<LD>   But the Seminoles, who charged to a 24-0 lead, struggled in the
second half and Bowden wasn't in a celebratory mood.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel like we lost this game," he said. "That's how I feel right
now."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace scrambled 20 yards and was driven out of bounds on the
Florida State one with four seconds remaining, setting up the final
play. Wallace then ran an option play to the short side of the field
and was tackled by Pope and Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   "We put the ball with the best player on our team," Iowa State
Coach Dan McCarney said.</TE>
<TE>   If the Cyclones had won, it arguably would have been the biggest
victory in the school's 110-year football history. Iowa State has
never beaten a team ranked as high as No. 3 and has lost 30 in a row
to ranked teams.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to see if he could make something happen. If we had to
do it again, we'd still put the ball in his hands," McCarney said.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson said he recognized the play at once.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I saw the fullback go in motion, I knew it was coming.
They ran it before and I guess they thought they could run it again
on us," he said. "I just tried to stay behind the ball. I got him
inside-out. Kendyll got him outside-in and we got him stopped."</TE>
<TE>   No. 13 Ohio State 45, Texas Tech 21--Freshman Maurice Clarett, the
first freshman to start at tailback in a Buckeye opener, ran for 175
yards and three touchdowns in the Pigskin Classic at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Clarett scored on runs of 59, 45 and two yards and set up two
scoring runs by Lydell Ross as the Buckeyes gained 318 yards on the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   Red Raider quarterback Kliff Kingsbury, touted as a Heisman Trophy
contender but befuddled by the Ohio State defense, completed 26 of 44
passes for 341 yards and three touchdowns with one interception. Two
of his touchdown passes and more than 140 of the passing yards came
in the fourth quarter after the Red Raiders fell behind, 38-7. Texas
Tech ran for only 31 yards in 20 attempts.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina State 34, New Mexico 14--Philip Rivers passed for
three touchdowns and ran for two more as the Wolfpack cruised to a
victory in the Black Coaches Assn. Bowl at Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Rivers was 15 of 24 for 276 yards against the blitzing Lobo
defense that was ranked 18th in the nation a season ago. He has
thrown at least one touchdown pass in 21 of his 25 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Rivers drove the Wolfpack 80, 96 and 89 yards in the opening half
for a 21-0 lead in a game that was delayed 45 minutes because of
lightning.</TE>

<TE>   Doctors focused on a bacterium as the possible cause of a
mysterious illness that sent several Fort Hays (Kan.) State football
players to the hospital this week. A DNA test from one of four
players who had been hospitalized came back positive for the
bacterium mycoplasma pneumoniae.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LINCOLN, Neb.</DL>
<LD>Maybe Nebraska Coach Frank Solich can sleep more soundly now.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 10 Cornhuskers defeated Arizona State, 48-10, on Saturday
in the Black Coaches Assn. Classic, showing Solich that his new
starting quarterback can play well and that his defense has recovered
from two embarrassing losses at the end of last season.</LD>
<LD>   "I probably slept less before this game than any game in my
coaching career," Solich said. "There's a lot of new faces."</LD>
<TE>   Nebraska is replacing half its starters and among those who made
their debut was quarterback Jammal Lord, who was a pleasant surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Lord threw his first career touchdown pass and ran for 103 yards
and did not turn the ball over.</TE>
<TE>   The Cornhuskers were trying to forget closing last season with
blowout losses to Colorado (62-36) and Miami (37-14).</TE>
<TE>   "It feels great," said Chris Kelsay, who had one of four Nebraska
sacks. "Tonight some of that got put behind us. We came out, busted
our butts, got in their backfield and created havoc."</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska scored 38 points in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State's Chad Christensen, a redshirt freshman who was
starting his first college game, was six of 16 for 77 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we started well and showed we can compete," Christensen
said.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State was held to 258 yards, 52 of which came on the final
drive.</TE>

<HD>Sunny Side Is Up for Gagne</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: He ties club record with 44th save after Sheffield
loses ball in right field to set up rally in L.A.'s 4-3 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To Dodger closer Eric Gagne, save No. 44--the one that sealed a 4-3
victory over the Atlanta Braves before a sellout crowd of 54,212 in
Dodger Stadium Saturday; the one that tied Todd Worrell's franchise
record, set in 1996, the one that gave the Dodgers their 13th win in
16 games--did not carry a whole lot of significance.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not that big a deal," Gagne said after the Dodgers increased
their National League wild-card lead over San Francisco to 4 1/2
games and moved to within seven games of first-place Arizona in the
NL West. "It's fun to be a part of history, but first place in the
wild card is what I'm trying to think about all the time."</LD>
<LD>   To others in the Dodger clubhouse, it's more than a big deal. In
fact, if players don't go on strike this Friday and the Dodgers reach
the playoffs for the first time since 1996, it will be Gagne who
likely seals the deal.</LD>
<TE>   Right fielder Shawn Green is having another most valuable
player-type of season, which included a two-run homer in the third
inning Saturday, and the rotation and bullpen have been among the
league's best all season.</TE>
<TE>   But if there is one singular reason why the Dodgers are in playoff
contention, and why they are 24-11 in one-run games this season after
going 29-29 in such games in 2001, it is Gagne.</TE>
<TE>   The starter-turned-reliever with the 97-mph fastball and
devastating changeup is 44 for 47 in save opportunities. He is 2-1
with a 1.92 earned-run average in 63 appearances, striking out 89 and
walking 11--two intentionally--in 65 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   After starting the ninth inning Saturday by walking Gary
Sheffield--who two innings earlier had lost a fly ball in the sun, a
major factor in the Dodgers' winning rally--Gagne struck out Chipper
Jones, whose seventh-inning homer had given the Braves a 3-2 lead.
When shortstop Cesar Izturis' error allowed the Braves to put runners
on first and second with one out, Gagne got Vinny Castilla to bounce
into a game-ending double play.</TE>
<TE>   "Gagne has been fabulous--there really aren't words to describe
the guy," Manager Jim Tracy said. "The expectation level he's set for
himself ... [he just says] get that ball to me in the ninth inning,
and I'll close that door and lock it for you."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Shaw was a solid closer last season, going 3-5 with a 3.62
ERA and 43 saves, but he also blew nine save opportunities and didn't
have Gagne-caliber stuff, the kind of pitches that enable a closer to
dominate.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to take anything away from Shawn Green, but [Gagne] is
probably the biggest reason we're where we are today," said Marquis
Grissom, whose seventh-inning RBI single Saturday tied the score,
3-3. "He gives us the feel late in games that we're going to win.</TE>
<TE>   "And this could be something huge going on for a long time. With
his attitude and mentality, he has a chance to break some records. I
know it's early, but I know greatness when I see it."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers also know good fortune when they see it, and they got
just enough of it to beat the Braves for the second straight game. An
error by Castilla, the Atlanta third baseman, preceded Green's 38th
homer of the season in the third, and a well-placed celestial
body--otherwise known as the sun--keyed the Dodgers' comeback in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   After Green's homer--which gave him 100 runs batted in this
season--the Braves countered with single runs in the fifth, sixth and
seventh innings, taking a 3-2 lead on Jones' homer off reliever Jesse
Orosco in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Izturis opened the bottom of the seventh with a shallow fly to
right, but Sheffield, who played left field for the Dodgers in 2000
and 2001, lost the ball in the sun, allowing Izturis to reach on a
gift double.</TE>
<TE>   Jolbert Cabrera, called up from triple-A Las Vegas to replace the
injured Brian Jordan and working on three hours' sleep after flying
from Tucson Saturday morning, advanced Izturis to third with a
sacrifice bunt. Mark Grudzielanek walked, and Grissom lined an RBI
single to left for a 3-3 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Green then walked to load the bases for Paul Lo Duca, who got
under a Tom Glavine pitch but drove it deep enough to left field to
score Grudzielanek for the go-ahead run.</TE>
<TE>   "The sun was horrible--when I played left field [here] it was
never a problem," Sheffield said. "I tried to let the ball come out
of the sun, but I never saw it."</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Paul Shuey retired the final two batters in the seventh
to gain the win, Paul Quantrill threw a scoreless eighth, and Gagne
provided the finishing touch.</TE>
<TE>   "He has an awful lot to do with us being 24-11 in one-run games,"
Tracy said. "And we've given him a lot of practice."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Back Lands Jordan on Disabled List</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>The Dodgers, feeling they could no longer play a man short, placed
injured left fielder Brian Jordan on the 15-day disabled list
Saturday and recalled utility player Jolbert Cabrera from triple-A
Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan, who has a protrusion in his lower back, had missed 12 of
the previous 13 games and did not make enough progress to convince
the Dodgers he could return in the next four or five days. He was
placed on the DL retroactive to Aug. 17 and will be eligible to
return Sept. 1.</LD>
<LD>   "It's probably best for the team, and it's probably best for me,"
said Jordan, who missed two-thirds of the 1997 season because of a
bulging disk in his lower back. "They need a 25th player, and I can't
play."</LD>
<TE>   The question is, will Jordan be able to play at full strength
again this season? He had one epidural injection and does not want
another. And he doesn't want to come back too soon and risk further
damage.</TE>
<TE>   "You're dealing with a back, so you're definitely concerned,"
Jordan said. "If it was a knee or an ankle, you could play with that.
But a back, with all the twisting, it impacts your whole body. It's
scary.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to rush it and put myself in the same situation I
was in back in 1997. I had a shot, kept playing, and that made it
worse. I had another shot, and it didn't do anything. I've been
there, done that. I don't want to make the same mistake. I want to
rehabilitate it, come back and make an impact."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Jordan nor the Dodgers believe the injury will require
surgery in the off-season--Jordan is already planning to undergo knee
surgery this winter--but they don't want to take a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a guy's career you're talking about," Manager Jim Tracy
said. "You just don't continue to take epidural injections. The back
is nothing to mess around with because if you play at less than 100%,
it could become a nagging thing for the rest of the season."</TE>
<TE>   Cabrera made an immediate contribution Saturday, playing left
field in the seventh inning and third base in the eighth and ninth.
He sacrificed the eventual tying run to third base in the seventh
andstarted a 5-3 double play in the ninth to end the Dodgers' 4-3
victory over the Braves.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, who is anything but a
prototypical leadoff batter, led off for the third time this season
Saturday, but he wasn't about to change his approach to fit the role.</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek is a free swinger who has 18 walks in 426 at-bats
this season, including six walks in 149 at-bats since the All-Star
break, and he's not going to mess with a formula that has resulted in
a .336 average (50 for 149) in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to do something I'm not comfortable with,"
Grudzielanek said. "If it's there, I hit it. If it's a strike, I
usually swing at it. I'm not going to work the count, look for this
or that. I've been that way my whole career; I'm not going to change.
I might take the first pitch of the game, that's about it."</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek went 0 for 3, but he did walk and score the eventual
winning run in the seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tracy was planning to start Dave Roberts in the leadoff spot
against Atlanta pitcher Tom Glavine Saturday--Roberts, a platoon
player, has made only one start against a left-hander this
season--but the center fielder did not play because of a stiff neck.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts suffered the injury when he collided with left fielder
Marquis Grissom to make a superb leaping catch of Javy Lopez's drive
to the wall in left-center field in the seventh inning Friday night,
and he jarred the neck a few more times sliding head-first into third
base in the ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said he "hasn't ruled out" the possibility of Roberts, who
is batting .417 (10 for 24) against left-handers, starting against
Brave left-hander Damian Moss tonight.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Tripped Up by Burn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Galaxy had a chance to jump into a first-place tie with defending
Major League Soccer champion San Jose Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Dallas Burn forward Bobby Rhine knocked the Galaxy into
third place. Rhine's golden goal in the 96th minute gave the Burn a
1-0 overtime victory against the Galaxy at the Cotton Bowl and
tightened things up considerably in the Western Conference.</LD>
<LD>   San Jose, which lost to Colorado, remained at the top of the
standings (13-8-3, 42 points) while Dallas moved within two points
(11-6-7, 40 points).</LD>
<TE>   The Galaxy (12-9-3, 39 points) remained in striking distance with
five games left, including a home-and-home series with the
Earthquakes to close the season.</TE>
<TE>   In front of 15,883, Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman tied a career
high with 10 saves. But it went for naught as the Galaxy offense was
stagnant.</TE>
<TE>   Rhine's game-winner occurred immediately after the start of the
second overtime.</TE>
<TE>   With Paul Broome bringing the ball up the left side, the Burn
defender found Jason Kreis at the top of the box. Kreis then passed
to Rhine inside the penalty area and his shot went under the arms of
Hartman.</TE>
<TE>   In being shut out, the Galaxy's Carlos Ruiz was caught in the
league's individual scoring race by New England's Taylor Twellman,
who had an assist in the Revolution's victory over Chicago. Both
rookie forwards have 35 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three days after South Korean defender Hong Myung-bo's club team
reportedly rejected MLS' overtures for his release with the hopes of
subsequently signing and transferring him to Los Angeles, Hong said
he wants to come to the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   "If my club allows, I would like to play for [the] L.A. Galaxy
before Koreans [who live] there," Hong, whose contract is currently
held by the Pohang Steelers of the South Korean K-League, told the
Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Hong, 33, has been on the South Korean national team since 1990
and was awarded the bronze boot as the World Cup's outstanding
defender after leading South Korea to a fourth-place finish.</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy officials have said since June that they intend to sign a
prominent South Korean player to appeal to Los Angeles' burgeoning
Korean community.</TE>
<TE>   In other MLS games:</TE>
<TE>   New England 2, Chicago 1--Daouda Kante scored in the 89th minute
to lead the Revolution to victory before 15,887 at Naperville, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Curtin opened the scoring in the 50th minute, leaping above
the New England defense to head Ante Razov's free kick past
goalkeeper Adin Brown.</TE>
<TE>   After replacing Rusty Pierce in the 59th minute, Wolde Harris
evened the score in the 65th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 3, San Jose 0--Chris Carrieri scored on a 30-yard pass
from Carlos Valderrama in the ninth minute and David Kramer had six
saves as the Rapids won before 12,196 at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Zach Kinsley scored on a header off Mark Chung's corner kick in
the 66th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Chung scored on a penalty kick against Jon Conway in extra time
after Joe Cannon was ejected on a red card for tripping Seth Trembly
on a breakaway.</TE>

<HD>Allenby Still Shares Lead, but Woods in the Hunt</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Allenby ticked off the names of players he let back into the
hunt Saturday in the NEC Invitational at Sammamish, Wash.</LD>
<LD>   One stood out in particular.</LD>
<LD>   "You've got a guy like Tiger Woods sitting right up behind you,"
Allenby said after an even-par 71 that left him with a share of the
lead, which for him was about the best thing that came out of the
third round at Sahalee Country Club.</LD>
<TE>   "You've got the top three or four players in the world right on
your heels. You know one of them is going to have a good day. And I
can put a pretty good bet on one of them."</TE>
<TE>   Woods had a four-under 67 and is two strokes back as he tries to
become the first player in 75 years to win the same tournament four
consecutive years.</TE>
<TE>   Allenby needed a birdie on the last hole to share the lead with
fellow Australian Craig Parry, who had a bogey-free 66 to tie Allenby
at 10-under 203.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who finished second in last week's PGA Championship, will
play today with Ernie Els, who is also at eight-under 205.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Masters champion Craig Stadler, 49, shot a 65 to pull
within one stroke of leaders Chris Riley, Steve Flesch and Jonathan
Kaye in the third round of the $3-million Reno-Tahoe Open.</TE>
<TE>   Riley shot a 67 for a share of the lead at 12-under 204.</TE>
<TE>   Kaye shot a 69 and Flesch shot a 70.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Ellis shot a seven-under 65 to take a two-stroke lead
after the third round of the Betsy King Classic at Kutztown, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis, who is seeking her first LPGA Tour victory, birdied eight
of the final 11 holes to finish at 15-under 201, breaking the
tournament record for 54 holes set last year by Heather
Daly-Donofrio.</TE>
<TE>   Australian Karrie Webb was two strokes back after a 67, and South
Korea's Se Ri Pak (66), Kelly Robbins (65) and Angela Stanford (66)
followed at 12 under.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle Ammaccapane, who began the round tied for the lead with
Australia's Wendy Doolan at nine under, shot a 71 to fall five
strokes back. Doolan was another shot behind after a 72.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Barnes, a senior at Arizona, defeated Wake Forest junior
Bill Haas, 1-up, and Hunter Mahan, a junior at Oklahoma State,
defeated North Carolina junior Dustin Bray, 1-up, in the semifinals
of the U.S. Amateur at Bloomfield Hills, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Jacobs scored 24 points with two eagles and seven birdies for
a share of the second-round lead with Morris Hatalsky in the Senior
PGA Tour's Uniting Fore Care Classic at Park City, Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs and Hatalsky, who birdied four of the last six holes, each
had 30 points under the scoring format.</TE>

<HD>Medaglia d'Oro Edges Repent in Travers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't as easy as his warmup win on a fast track three weeks ago,
but Medaglia d'Oro was able to hold off Repent in the final 100 yards
to register a half-length victory Saturday in the $1-million Travers
at Saratoga.</LD>
<LD>   With War Emblem's camp electing to stay at Del Mar, where the
Kentucky Derby-Preakness winner will face older horses today in the
$1-million Pacific Classic, the 133rd Travers turned into a two-horse
race over a sloppy track. Medaglia d'Oro, who had won the Jim Dandy
at Saratoga by 13 3/4 lengths on Aug. 4, ran 1 1/4 miles in 2:02 2/5,
earning $600,000 for his fourth victory in nine starts and increasing
his career total to $1.4 million.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Edmund Gann of Rancho Santa Fe, trained by Bobby Frankel
and ridden by Jerry Bailey, Medaglia d'Oro paid $3.50 for $2. Repent,
the 7-2 second choice, finished 7 1/2 lengths ahead of Nothing Flat.
While Medaglia d'Oro slugged it out with War Emblem during the Triple
Crown, running fourth in the Derby, eighth in the Preakness and
second in the Belmont Stakes, Repent was recovering from ankle
surgery after his second-place finish to War Emblem in the Illinois
Derby. The Travers was Repent's first start since that race, which
was run on April 6.</LD>
<TE>   Medaglia d'Oro, Repent and War Emblem are on a collision course
that could wind up in the $4-million Breeders' Cup Classic at
Arlington Park on Oct. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Another stake on the Saratoga card also went to Frankel and Bailey
when favored Surya beat only two other horses in the $200,000
Ballston Spa Handicap. The race was taken off the grass, prompting
seven scratches. Also at Saratoga, Capsized, at 3-1, won the
Fourstardave Handicap, which was reduced from 10 to five starters
when it was moved to the dirt.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At Del Mar, Frankel missed by a nose of winning the $300,000 Del
Mar Oaks when Kent Desormeaux, winning his third race of the day,
rode favored Dublino ($4.60) to a victory over Megahertz and Alex
Solis.</TE>
<TE>   Dublino's time of 1:47 for 1 1/8 miles on grass shaved
three-fifths of a second off the stakes record, set by Twice The Vice
in 1994. Dublino missed by two-fifths of a second the track record,
set by Al Mamoon in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A.C. Valenzuela, the father of jockey Pat Valenzuela, died
Saturday at San Antonio Hospital in Upland after an extended illness.
He was 64. The best year for A.C. Valenzuela was 1959, when he won 57
races. He won 46 races in 1960.... Pat Valenzuela, facing a seven-day
suspension that was to begin Friday, will appeal the stewards'
ruling, said Nick Cosato, the jockey's agent.... Crowned Dancer,
winner of the Hollywood Juvenile, has a wrenched right front leg and
a virus and will not run in the Del Mar Futurity on Sept. 11....
Archrival Taz beat Black Ruby by a head in the $10,000 California
State Fair Open Mule Challenge at Sacramento.</TE>

<LD>The Huntsville Item has decided, after a poll of readers, not to run
any coverage of major league baseball until Friday's strike deadline.</LD>
<LD>   In its Sunday editions, the newspaper reported: "Item readers have
spoken. Asked to strike or not to strike, 82 percent of you said,
'Let's strike.' So, The Huntsville Item is going on a pro baseball
strike."</LD>
<LD>   The 7,000-circulation newspaper's self-imposed strike would be

<LD>Besides being a rare stakes race with an overflow field, the
$1-million Pacific Classic is also the start of a pick six that has a
$1-million guaranteed pool.</LD>
<LD>   There are no free spots in the pick six, so some players may pass
on today's card and hope there is a monster carryover for Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Those who insist on playing probably will be spreading the
Classic, a race that seems almost certain to fall apart in favor of
closers.</LD>
<TE>   Such a scenario would certainly favor Santa Anita Handicap and
Californian winner Milwaukee Brew.</TE>
<TE>   Making his first start in California in the Big 'Cap on March 2,
the 5-year-old Wild Again horse sat well off the pace and went on to
win by four lengths at the Pacific Classic distance of 1 1/4 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee Brew also has the advantage of being trained by Bobby
Frankel, who has won the Classic six times, including the last two
years with the now-retired Skimming.</TE>
<TE>   Momentum, who was a nose loser to Sky Jack in the Hollywood Gold
Cup last month, is another who should be helped by the probable race
shape.</TE>
<TE>   A longshot to pay attention to is Pleasantly Perfect.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Diamond A Racing Corporation and trained by Richard
Mandella, the 4-year-old Pleasant Colony colt has never run in a
graded stakes, but he is improving and the 10 furlongs will be ideal
for him.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Mandella will send out 123-pound highweight
Redattore in the $250,000 Longacres Mile at Emerald Downs in Auburn,
Wash. Jason Lumpkins will ride Redattore, who will break from post 11
in the field of 12.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Kevin Radke. The former hot apprentice in northern
California is the leading rider at Emerald Downs and is riding at
about a 21% clip.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Juan Marquez. The trainer, who currently has a string
at Sacramento, was three for his first 113 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta in the Pacific Classic using
Milwaukee Brew, Momentum and Pleasantly Perfect in the first two
spots and all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/59. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $20.20/$361.20. Total money bet: $476.</TE>

<HD>Labor Talks Take a Turn for Worse</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Gap widens as owners' lawyer calls union proposal
'regressive' and trades barbs with Fehr.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball labor talks took a negative turn Saturday as management
blasted players for making what it considered regressive proposals on
the core economic issues of revenue sharing and a payroll tax,
seemingly putting the sport on the brink of another work stoppage
with a strike deadline in only five days.</LD>
<LD>   The gap widened between owners and the Major League Baseball
Players Assn. as Rob Manfred, management's lead labor lawyer, accused
the union of "raw, regressive bargaining" for proposing that
increased revenue sharing be phased in during the length of the next
agreement. That's unacceptable for owners, who want the plan to be
fully implemented next season in an attempt to slow salary growth.</LD>
<LD>   "We could not have been more disappointed in the proposal,"
Manfred said. "I've never seen anything quite like it. When you get a
proposal like this ... [it] was so out of the realm of expectation
that it's going to take us a little time [to respond]."</LD>
<TE>   Union head Don Fehr expressed confusion about the owners'
position, and continued to jab at Manfred for his negotiating
strategy, saying players made a significant step toward the owners in
their latest offer. The union, trying to protect high-revenue clubs
that drive the market, is strongly opposed to the entire increase
beginning next season, but disputed the owners' contention that the
concept of phase-ins was dropped on them unexpectedly.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever the bar owner was in 'Casablanca,' " Fehr said, "was
shocked to find gambling, too."</TE>
<TE>   Manfred and Fehr slammed each other in dueling conference calls
with reporters, escalating a battle that could result in baseball's
ninth work stoppage since 1972. Negotiators are scheduled to meet
today in hopes of completing a deal before players strike Aug. 30,
but there are other hurdles too.</TE>
<TE>   The sides remain apart on drug testing (owners are seeking a
tougher plan than the union has offered) and the format of a
worldwide draft. Now, it appears talks might again stall on the key
issues as the deadline approaches, raising the stakes in a
high-priced poker game stirring tension throughout the major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't be here trying to figure out how to move this forward
if we thought it was hopeless," Manfred said. "Having said that, this
did not help."</TE>
<TE>   Owners have proposed transferring $268 million from high-revenue
to low-revenue teams next year, an increase of more than $100 million
from the existing revenue-sharing formula based on 2001 figures. The
union has offered transfers of $172.3 million in 2003, $195.6 million
in 2004, $219 million in 2005 and $242.3 million in 2006, meaning the
sides are close in the final year of the proposed deal.</TE>
<TE>   Clubs would share 33.3% of local revenue, up from 20% under the
current deal, under the union plan. Fehr said players had previously
been at 31% and owners at 37%, adding that the union adopted
management's method of redistributing revenue to favor
middle-of-the-pack teams. Moreover, Fehr said the sides had discussed
phase-ins for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   "The parties have discussed for a long time that when agreements
are eventually reached, changes will have to be phased in over time,"
he said. "They clearly understand this would be phased in. Therefore,
I am at a loss to explain what this is all about."</TE>
<TE>   Not so fast, Manfred said.</TE>
<TE>   "They had mentioned the concept of phase-ins a couple of times in
the last week or so," he said. "But nobody had ever given us any
reason to believe that the phase-in concept meant we were essentially
going to stay flat on revenue sharing for a year, or that we'd never
get to the full transfer value until year four of the contract.</TE>
<TE>   "There was never, ever, ever a phase-in proposal discussed until
[Saturday]. What went on [last year] is ancient history by the time
these talks got going."</TE>
<TE>   The union also infuriated owners by moving only $5 million toward
their tax threshold in each season.</TE>
<TE>   Owners want to tax the portions of 40-man payrolls over $102
million, and players have proposed thresholds of $125 million in
2003, $135 million in 2004 and $145 million in 2005. The union's
previous offer included thresholds of $5 million more in each season.
Based on projections, the New York Yankees and Texas Rangers are the
only clubs that would be affected by the tax under the union plan.</TE>
<TE>   Players have proposed tax rates of 15% to 40%; owners want 37.5%
to 50%. Owners also are upset players are fighting against a tax in
2006, the final year of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "If they had made any sort of move that was in our direction we
would have made a countermove already," Manfred said. "The thing
we're dealing with is how to respond to a move that went the wrong
way."</TE>
<TE>   Manfred, who had characterized negotiations with optimism until
recently, needled Fehr for giving a "20-minute monologue" before the
proposal on "Don's view of the world." A high-ranking baseball
official also took exception to what he considered especially
arrogant parts of Fehr's proposal, including that the union
participate in monitoring how clubs spend their revenue-sharing money
and that tax proceeds go to the union. The union wants authority to
sanction clubs that it believes are not spending enough to improve.</TE>
<TE>   "Don had one of his quotes that I've come to know and love out
there [recently]," Manfred said. "Somebody asked him how we were
going to get to an agreement, and his answer was that Rob knows what
he needs to do. My answer to that is apparently Don doesn't know what
he needs to do."</TE>

<KH>LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES</KH>
<HD>Louisville Will Face Japanese Team for Championship</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Zach Osborne pitched unbeaten Louisville, Ky., into the championship
game of the Little League World Series. Next up is a Japanese team
that also has a perfect record.</LD>
<LD>   Osborne struck out 11 and had an RBI double in Louisville's 4-0
victory over Worcester, Mass., in the U.S. championship Saturday
night to set up tonight's finale against undefeated Sendai, Japan.</LD>
<LD>   "Awesome job," Worcester Manager Fran Granger said of Osborne. "He
kept us off balance all night and kept hitting the corners--probably
one of the best pitching performances of the series."</LD>
<TE>   Osborne's shot to center field scored the first of Louisville's
four runs in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a curveball, and I just waited on it and came around on
it," Osborne said of the double, his first of two hits.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Hornbeck, who reached base when catcher Ryan Griffin
obstructed his path after a bunt, came home on Aaron Alvey's
sacrifice fly to left field, and Ethan Henry added a two-run homer to
right to complete the scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Louisville, the first Kentucky team to reach the title game, was
5-0 in U.S. play. Sendai, also 5-0, beat Willemstad, Curacao,
Netherlands Antilles, 4-1 on Saturday in the international final.</TE>
<TE>   Osborne (3-0) had at least two strikeouts in each inning except
the fifth, when the first two batters grounded out to the pitcher. He
gave up two hits and one walk, and no Worcester runner made it past
first base. "I know he had 11 strikeouts, and he had four assists on
the mound. They kept hitting to him," said Louisville Manager J. Troy
Osborne, the pitcher's father. "I think we kept them off balance
enough that they kept hitting the ball into the ground instead of
hitting it into the air."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rodney Hart will reach a milestone with his next victory.</LD>
<LD>   A trainer for about 50 years who earned his first victory at Los
Alamitos with Apple Jack Bee in 1960, Hart will become the fourth
trainer to win 1,000 races at Los Alamitos with his next victory,
joining Blane Schvaneveldt, Paul Jones and John Cooper in the
exclusive club.</LD>
<LD>   A Secret Account was the 999th winner for Hart, scoring a $25.60
upset in Friday night's ninth, beating a field that included Drop
Your Sox and Dashin Bye, the favorite and a Grade I winner. Ridden by
Eddie Garcia, A Secret Account, who is also owned by his trainer,
covered the 350 yards in 17.59 seconds.</LD>
<TE>   A native of South Dakota, Hart began his training career there
before coming to Los Alamitos 42 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   He had no starters on Saturday's night program or this evening's
nine-race card.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Cooper got his 1,100th victory at Los Alamitos when
Gonna Get A Ticket took the seventh under jockey Gary Boag.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Leaving The Fire. 2. Frolic's Flash. 3. Mini Can
Fly. 4. Maximillions. 5. Spit Happens. 6. Mustang Pilot. 7. First
Dance Dasher. 8. Crashin Bac. 9. Ponderosa Ruby.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Leaving The Fire, Sunday Blush and Judys Jazz in the
first, single Frolic's Flash in the second, use Mini Can Fly and
Mighty Smooth Dash in the third and Maximillions, Taught and
Applicator in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Taught is a first-time starter in a bad race in
the fourth and a top rider (Ramon Guce) takes the call. Word Angel
had trouble in his latest and switches to leading jockey Ramon
Sanchez in the fifth.</TE>

<LD>Reggie Barlow returned a punt for a touchdown, and Oakland's defense
looked vastly improved Saturday as the Raiders held off San
Francisco, 17-10, in an exhibition game before a half-filled Coliseum
at Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   The Battle of the Bay turned into the Battle of the Backups,
considering all the scoring drives were led by Marques Tuiasosopo and
Rick Mirer of the Raiders (1-2), and Tim Rattay of the 49ers (1-3).
Starting quarterbacks Rich Gannon and Jeff Garcia both played into
the second quarter, and each took a pounding.</LD>
<LD>   Oakland's defense, embarrassingly porous in a 24-14 loss at
Tennessee last week, limited the 49ers to 65 yards rushing and
frequently hurried Garcia or left him sprawled on the ground.</LD>

<HD>Clement Leads Cubs Past Diamondbacks</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After leaving his father's bedside to pitch against the Arizona
Diamondbacks, Matt Clement wasn't about to come out of the game.</LD>
<LD>   Clement persuaded Manager Bruce Kimm to leave him in after a
conference at the mound and got the last two outs for a three-hitter
as the Chicago Cubs defeated the Diamondbacks, 4-0, Saturday at
Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a nice win, and good for him," said Clement, whose father,
Paul, had quintuple-bypass surgery Thursday. "Unfortunately he
couldn't watch it, but he got updates. It was a nice win to get,
especially under the circumstances."</LD>
<TE>   Mark Bellhorn hit his 21st home run, and the Cubs handed the
National League West leaders only their second loss in 14 games.</TE>
<TE>   Clement (10-9) was undecided about leaving his father in a
Pittsburgh hospital room but spent Friday afternoon there and caught
a late flight for Phoenix. It didn't affect his stamina--he threw a
season-high 126 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no way that he wanted to come out of that ballgame,"
Kimm said. "At least 99% of the time you're ready to make a decision
in that situation, but this was one of those times you let yourself
be influenced."</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 5, Houston 3--Adam Dunn hit a two-run homer against Tom
Gordon in the 11th inning at Houston and the Reds ended a five-game
losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 4, St. Louis 0--Vicente Padilla (13-8) pitched eight
scoreless innings, and Bobby Abreu and Pat Burrell each homered at
St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   New York 5, Colorado 2--Timo Perez hit a two-run homer with two
out in the ninth inning at Denver and the Mets ended a 12-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 17, Milwaukee 10--Craig Wilson drove in four runs at
Milwaukee and Kip Wells (12-11) became the Pirates' first 12-game
winner in three years.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 8, San Diego 4--Derrek Lee hit a three-run homer, his
21st, and Kevin Millar drove in two runs at San Diego to help the
Marlins rebound from their worst loss this season, 18-2 to the Padres
on Friday.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Bartolo Colon took a look at San Francisco's batting order and let
out a sigh of relief. Then he pitched the Montreal Expos past the
Giants, 7-2, Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Facing a lineup without Barry Bonds, Jeff Kent and Rich Aurilia,
Colon stretched his streak of shutout innings to 18 before giving up
two runs in the sixth.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt relieved when I saw they weren't playing," Colon said
through an interpreter. "That put me more at ease. There's only a few
guys over there I've faced, so that was probably to my advantage."</LD>
<TE>   Colon (7-2) gave up five hits in six innings. He is 14-3 since May
4, including his time in the American League before Cleveland traded
him.</TE>
<TE>   Colon came out after six innings when his back stiffened. Vladimir
Guerrero had three hits, scored twice, drove in a run and stole a
base for the Expos.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal has won four of five against the Giants after going 2-3
last year. Overall, the Expos have won six of nine, and the Giants
have lost six of 10.</TE>
<TE>   Livan Hernandez (8-14) gave up four runs and seven hits in 5 2/3
innings. He started the season 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   "Livan was pitching good and lately we've had a couple of plays,
not necessarily errors, just bad plays, that have turned into runs by
them," Giant Manager Dusty Baker said. "We've got to make the plays
to back up the pitcher."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds didn't start because of sore knees and Kent didn't start
because of a strained left quadriceps. Aurilia was given the day off
but entered in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero put Montreal ahead with a run-scoring single in the
sixth, and the Expos added three runs in the inning with the help of
a throwing error by left fielder Tom Goodwin.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to walk Guerrero," Hernandez said. "I threw him a
slider down and away and he hit it."</TE>

<HD>Mears Sought Treatment for Drinking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four-time Indianapolis 500 winner Rick Mears was never scared in a
race car. Alcohol is a different story.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a guy who's always liked his beer," Mears said Saturday. "A
while back, I just felt like it was catching up with me, that I was
starting to drink too much."</LD>
<LD>   Mears, 50, revealed that he checked himself into a treatment
program twice--in mid-April and in late May.</LD>
<TE>   Mears retired from driving after the 1992 season and currently is
an advisor with Marlboro Team Penske. His story recalls that of Al
Unser Jr., another champion driver who sought treatment for alcohol
abuse earlier this month.</TE>

<HD>Mandella Has a Perfect Plan</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Trainer, no stranger to pulling upsets, says
Pleasantly Perfect is ready to go the distance against War Emblem in
the $1-million Pacific Classic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>You can't question trainer Richard Mandella's decision to run
Pleasantly Perfect in today's $1-million Pacific Classic at Del Mar,
even though the 4-year-old colt has never been in a stakes race.</LD>
<LD>   Mandella can't match Bobby Frankel in the Classic, Frankel having
won six of the 11 runnings, but Mandella has won the race twice and
in 1996 etched himself forever as the Del Mar giant killer when he
ganged up on Cigar with Dare And Go and Siphon. Now Mandella will try
to upset another favored Pacific Classic horse, War Emblem, the first
Kentucky Derby winner to run in the stake as a 3-year-old.</LD>
<LD>   "This is what a million-dollar purse is supposed to do," said
Mandella, explaining why Pleasantly Perfect and 12 other horses are
taking on War Emblem. "You're supposed to try harder when there's
that much money on the line."</LD>
<TE>   Mandella, who won in 1996 with Dare And Go, breaking Cigar's
16-race winning streak, and repeated in 1997 with Gentlemen, jokes
about how he decided on the Pacific Classic for Pleasantly Perfect.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking at the condition book, and this was the only
mile-and-a-quarter race I could find," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is that Pleasantly Perfect, a son of 1981 Derby winner
Pleasant Colony and a grandson of Affirmed, the 1978 Triple Crown
champion, is at his best when the races are the longest. In his last
start, at 1 1/16 miles at Del Mar on Aug. 4, Pleasantly Perfect won
by 3 1/2 lengths and seemed to be begging for more ground.</TE>
<TE>   "When I bought this horse [at auction in 1999 for $725,000], I
could see Pacific Classic written all over him," Mandella said.</TE>
<TE>   Pleasantly Perfect, who will be ridden by Alex Solis, the same
jockey who orchestrated Dare And Go's shocker against Cigar, is 15-1
on the morning line. With only seven starts--including three
victories and two seconds--he's the most lightly raced horse in the
field.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a virus near his heart sac when he was a yearling,"
Mandella said. "When they had him at the farm in Kentucky, he would
gallop a mile and get exhausted. His heart rate would go down instead
of going up after a workout. It took a lot of rest before he was
ready to be introduced to the races."</TE>
<TE>   He made that debut in May 2001 at Hollywood Park, but when
Pleasantly Perfect finished last in a field of 10, it was decided to
give him more time. He didn't run again until last January. Then, in
his third start of 2002, at Santa Anita in late February, the colt
broke his maiden. He goes into today's race off two consecutive wins,
an allowance victory at Hollywood preceding the Del Mar victory. He
has never raced at distances shorter than a mile.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's as good as he's going to get right now," Mandella
said. "If he fits in this race, we'll have some nice
things--including the Breeders' Cup [Classic]--to point to at the end
of the year."</TE>
<TE>   To beat Cigar, Mandella needed two horses, Siphon softening up the
1-10 favorite early and setting the stage for Dare And Go's late run.
For most trainers, such a feat would be a career benchmark, but
Mandella, who was voted into the Racing Hall of Fame last year, lumps
the fall of Cigar into a group of accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   "Beating Cigar was great, but it would be pretty hard to top what
happened to me at the Breeders' Cup in 1993," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That year at Santa Anita, Mandella saddled four stakes
winners--Kotashaan in the $2-million Breeders' Cup Turf; Phone
Chatter in the $1-million Juvenile Fillies, and Region and Memo in
hundred-granders on the undercard. Kotashaan was later voted horse of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   "The 1-2-3 in the [1997 Santa Anita Handicap] with Siphon, Sandpit
and Gentlemen was pretty sweet too," Mandella said. "And the dead
heat for the win with those two mares [Beautiful Melody and Reluctant
Guest in the 1990 Beverly Hills Handicap at Hollywood Park] is way up
there. Boy, did I have some strange emotions going into the winner's
circle that day."</TE>
<TE>   By definition, the 12th edition of the Pacific Classic is a
jockeys' race. What to do with War Emblem--how much to push him
early, how far back to position your horse--is what the 13 riders in
the race besides Victor Espinoza must sort out. Skimming won the last
two Pacific Classics by running on an uncontested lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we'll have a Skimming situation, not with all the
other speed in this race," said Mandella, who didn't have a starter
either year. "But who knows? The jocks might read all this stuff
about going out with War Emblem and then all of them decide to take
back with their mounts."</TE>

<LD>The Chicken is barking.</LD>
<LD>   His breath comes in short, loud bursts, straining to escape the
narrow opening in his foam beak.</LD>
<LD>   He sprints through the warm night, off the faded field, into a
windowless concrete storage room, plopping down on a folding chair.</LD>
<TE>   Outside, in the aluminum bleachers that ring this tiny baseball
stadium in the Northwest woods, the laughter dies.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the Chicken gasps.</TE>
<TE>   "Was it funny?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   He tears off his costume head, swallows air in giant breaths,
chugs a 20-ounce bottle of water, gulps more air.</TE>
<TE>   His blue vest is stained dark with sweat. His yellow leotard is
dotted with infield dirt.</TE>
<TE>   His black hair is plastered to a face that is pale from nearly
three decades of hiding. It is the smooth face of a boy on the
thickening body of a man who next year will turn 50.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," he asks again. "Was it funny?"</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he is told. It was great.</TE>
<TE>   He looked devious throwing the water balloons at the first base
coach. He looked helpless when players retaliated by showering him
with their own water balloons.</TE>
<TE>   He is told that many fans smiled, chuckled, held up little
children and pointed them toward this strange and wonderful creature
who has made this Saturday night so memorable</TE>
<TE>   He frowns. That's not what he asked. He wants to know about the
roar. Where was the roar?</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every summer night for most of his adult life, he has
surrendered his identity and hidden his face and changed his voice in
search of the roar.</TE>
<TE>   Did he somehow miss the roar?</TE>
<TE>   Outside, the inning is nearly over,</TE>
<TE>   an expectant hush descending upon several thousand fans who have
put down their Killer Kielbasas and Dippin' Dots ice cream to watch
what may</TE>
<TE>   be the final webbed footsteps of a legend.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the Chicken growls.</TE>
<TE>   "But was it funny????"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Put on the head.</TE>
<TE>   Go ahead, pick up the one-pound clump of feathers and
baseball-sized eyes and giant beak and put it on.</TE>
<TE>   Feel what Ted Giannoulas has felt for 29 years.</TE>
<TE>   Good luck enduring it for more than 29 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The inside of the head of the San Diego Chicken is sour, steamy, a
moldy shower stall in a darkened locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "First time I put it on, I couldn't believe it," said his sister
Chris. "I thought, how does he do this?' "</TE>
<TE>   And how does he see? The holes in the beak through which he views
the world are only inches wide, like a couple of cracks in a Venetian
blind. He cannot look below him, or above him, or beside him.</TE>
<TE>   Put on the chicken head and realize, Ted Giannoulas has gone
through life with the unique blessing of being exposed only to what
is directly in front of his face.</TE>
<TE>   He sees the children's smiles. He doesn't see the uncomfortable
stares from those who watch him increasingly strain to create that
joy.</TE>
<TE>   He sees baseball in all its flannel-and-leather-covered romance.
He didn't see the game's creeping selfishness and greed until it was
too late.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the most recognizable mascot uniform is no longer a
uniform, but a time warp, one in which Giannoulas finds himself
seemingly trapped.</TE>
<TE>   He is the best-known, highest-paid baseball mascot in history, a
star who still fills minor league stadiums and attracts autograph
lines that stretch for blocks.</TE>
<TE>   But for the first time, he did not work a major league park this
season, because the big leaguers no longer have the time or the
interest.</TE>
<TE>   In the Chicken's final days in major league clubhouses, players
cursed him, ran from him, even purposely missed throws that might
have hit him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so sad, there's such acrimony in there now," Giannoulas
said. "The players are way too cool. Guys who I had fun with in the
minor leagues wouldn't even say hello to me anymore."</TE>
<TE>   He is the father of modern sports entertainment, an accomplished
vaudevillian who invented the art of toying with an umpire and
dancing with a player.</TE>
<TE>   But there are nearly a dozen imitators out there now, slick and
hip traveling mascots with names like BirdZerk! and ZOOperstars!,
acts that allegedly steal the chicken's material and send him
screeching.</TE>
<TE>   "Few things stick in my craw, but this is one of them," Giannoulas
said. "Those laughs are my babies. My babies!"</TE>
<TE>   While never missing an event in 29 years--more than 6,000
consecutive games--Giannoulas has thrilled three generations of
children.</TE>
<TE>   But he wakes up today at 49 with no children of his own because he
never had the time.</TE>
<TE>   "You know how everyone always says that if they lived their life
over again, they wouldn't change a thing?" Giannoulas said. "Well,
that's bull. I would change things. I would have given more time to
myself."</TE>
<TE>   Observers agree his unique style of physical humor and mime would
make Giannoulas a great entertainer on any stage.</TE>
<TE>   But because he refuses to allow himself to be photographed outside
of his suit, nobody would recognize him.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-nine years of standing ovations for the Chicken, and not
once has anybody cheered Ted Giannoulas.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-nine years of fame, yet nobody has seen his face.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it's like I don't have a real life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the owners of other mascot costumes, Giannoulas also will
not allow anyone else to wear the suit and learn the trade.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a department store Santa Claus," he said. "There is only
one Chicken."</TE>
<TE>   So when Giannoulas retires, the Chicken will disappear forever.
Then what will happen to the man?</TE>
<TE>   It is a question he faces daily, yet never really faces, still
working more than 100 dates a year, hugging a happy child in Wyoming
one moment, dealing with a jerky first baseman in Fresno the next.</TE>
<TE>   Have you seen him? Do you remember your favorite gag?</TE>
<TE>   Was it when he marched onto the field followed by a line of
children dressed like baby chickens, a skit that ended with the kids
lifting their legs on the umpire? Or was it when he lost a dance
contest to a Barney look-alike, then punched him out?</TE>
<TE>   He's still doing the same things, only this summer, for the first
time, one of his gigs was a softball tournament. And while the San
Diego Padres hired a mascot to work one game at his home Qualcomm
Stadium, it wasn't him.</TE>
<TE>   In serving baseball, the San Diego Chicken has become like
baseball itself: a brilliant idea, born of innocence, bred with joy,
but now struggling to age gracefully through a building cloud of
impertinence and indifference.</TE>
<TE>   "Ted invented mascots, he was the first and funniest, I have
nothing but respect for him," said Dave Raymond, who spent years
wearing the costume of the popular Philly Phanatic. "But if you're
not careful, you can lose yourself in that suit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Chicken is dripping.</TE>
<TE>   Running off the field in 90-degree Fresno heat, he grabs for a
towel as he drops to a chair in a humid tunnel behind the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   As always, the head is the first thing to come off. But this time,
because of a skit involving a special costume, he must also peel off
the rest of his leotard and feathers.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you help me take off my suit, sir?" he asks a team employee,
gasping as he buries his exposed face in the towel.</TE>
<TE>   The usher doesn't understand.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicken pauses, stares up, asks again, a little louder.</TE>
<TE>   "Sir, please, can you help me get out of this suit?"</TE>
<TE>   The employee shrugs and steps forward, grunting and grabbing and
pulling and yanking and slowly stripping away the wet layers until
the Chicken becomes a man again.</TE>
<TE>   At which point Giannoulas, his face still in the towel, drops
breathless back into his chair.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen him for the last five years," whispers a nearby guard.
"But I've never seen him like this."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The search for the Chicken began earlier this summer during a
meeting with a 5-foot-5, middle-aged man standing outside a budget
hotel in Lake Elsinore.</TE>
<TE>   He was wearing blue jean shorts, an untucked blue Hawaiian shirt
and reading glasses propped on a full head of black hair. He looked
like a tourist. He looked like a science teacher. He looked like
anything but ...</TE>
<TE>   "Ted Giannoulas," he said, extending his hand.</TE>
<TE>   He saw the surprised look on his visitor's face. He shrugged. He
is used to the disbelief. It really doesn't matter. It's never about
him, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "I have plenty of Chicken stories," he said. "I'm afraid I don't
have any Ted stories."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, but he does.</TE>
<TE>   As the essence of baseball remains curiously timeless, so, too,
does the man underneath its mascot.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicken is a multimillionaire who commands in the neighborhood
of $7,500 an appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Ted Giannoulas has lived in the same modest suburban San Diego
house for 22 years.</TE>
<TE>   This is partly because it is within a mile of the home of his
mother, who still makes his costumes. This is also because the house
is near a good library. After spending his summer chasing a roar, he
spends his winters soaking in silence.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicken is also an effective salesman who makes big money in
affordable merchandising that includes everything from dolls to
videos.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Ted Giannoulas doesn't have an ATM card. No pager. No personal
e-mail address. Can't use the computer printer.</TE>
<TE>   When he arrives every night at the ballpark on his leased luxury
bus--he hasn't flown regularly for 10 years because of the hassle--he
is not carrying a wallet, keys or a cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicken is a perfectionist who carefully choreographs every
move and understands every nuance. He knows the size of every minor
league foul territory, the nature of every sound system, the location
of every bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when he talks to small children afterward in the autograph
line, he uses the words and high-pitched tones of a character from
Looney Tunes.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Pork chop!" "Hello, Wiener!" "Howyadoin', Sugar Cube?"</TE>
<TE>   Folks say this is part of what makes the Chicken different--and
more enduring--than other mascots.</TE>
<TE>   The other ones don't talk. They can't talk. To open their mouth is
to risk ruining the illusion by sounding different from the person
who wore the costume the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Chicken is the Chicken forever, he can talk, and so he
does, cackling on the dugout, whispering to the children, and
engaging in a running patter with fans in postgame autograph lines
that often last past midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Incidentally, he signs for free. He signs everything. He poses for
anything.</TE>
<TE>   On that summer night in Salem, seated at the head of a long line
winding through the right-field playground, how he chirped.</TE>
<TE>   "Have some Kentucky Fried Chicken!" announced one brave little
boy, plopping down a trademark bucket on the autograph table.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that's nobody I know," said the Chicken, staring at the
chicken.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks for helping us win tonight," mumbled a shy little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm your good-cluck charm," said the Chicken.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did the chicken cross the road?" asked a couple of teenage
boys.</TE>
<TE>   "To get away from stupid questions," said the Chicken with a
laugh.</TE>
<TE>   The question he is most often asked, of course, is a more basic
one.</TE>
<TE>   Is that really still him?</TE>
<TE>   It is asked by adult fans who bring him 20-year-old autographs in
search of comparative proof. It is asked by senior citizens who test
him with questions about an act in El Paso in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   In Tucson, the question stunned Giannoulas when it was asked by a
man in his mid-20s who brought him a photo of the Chicken performing
his trademark biting of a baby's head.</TE>
<TE>   "That baby was me," said the man.</TE>
<TE>   It is also a question increasingly asked by friends and family
members.</TE>
<TE>   Said Chris: "I'd like to see him finally relax and enjoy the
fruits of his labor. After a while, you've got to say, maybe I should
go home now."</TE>
<TE>   Said former mascot Raymond: "Can you imagine if he had decided to
share his knowledge, to teach others his craft? He would be running
the entire mascot industry today. He would be his own little Disney."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Chicken remains a huge man in a small world,
unfolding eye charts for young umpires, literally stealing bases for
old laughs, signing autographs that begin "Best Wishbones ..."</TE>
<TE>   "He's thought about retiring," said his wife, Jane. "But how do
you retire from yourself?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Chicken is crying.</TE>
<TE>   All night in this tiny ballpark in Butte, Mont., people have told
him that he must meet a boy named Matthew.</TE>
<TE>   "Matthew is looking for you."</TE>
<TE>   "Matthew wants to see you."</TE>
<TE>   Late in the game, the Chicken is finally directed to the child, a
4-year-old with huge eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "How are you doing, you little wiener?" the Chicken asks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really enjoying you," Matthew says.</TE>
<TE>   "Having fun?" the Chicken asks.</TE>
<TE>   "You are very funny," Matthew says.</TE>
<TE>   As Matthew tentatively reaches out to stroke the Chicken's suit,
his father leans over and whispers into Giannoulas' ear.</TE>
<TE>   "My son has been blind since birth."</TE>
<TE>   Giannoulas spends the rest of the game in tears.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine allowing a child to see with his ears," he says later.</TE>
<TE>   That night is what convinced him that, even after all these years,
this is what he must do.</TE>
<TE>   "That night," he says later, "laughter was the most powerful force
in the universe."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   His father never liked it. Up until two months before his death of
lung cancer in 1979, John Giannoulas was not proud that his son was
the Chicken.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up the only son of Greek immigrants in London, Ontario,
young Ted liked to rearrange the furniture, wear a cape and jump
around like Mighty Mouse.</TE>
<TE>   His father wanted him to stop clowning around.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband wanted Ted to be a doctor, something big, something
serious," Helen Giannoulas said. "He was a very traditional Greek
man."</TE>
<TE>   After third grade, Ted obeyed his father, turned his emotions
inward, tried to become that model man.</TE>
<TE>   "I always wanted to be the class clown, but I never had the
nerve," Giannoulas recalled. "So I would always sit next to the class
clown."</TE>
<TE>   Until that spring afternoon in 1974 at San Diego State.</TE>
<TE>   Giannoulas, a student, was sitting with other fellow workers at
the campus radio station when an executive from a local rock station
walked in and asked if anybody wanted to wear a chicken suit and pass
out promotional eggs during spring break.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody said anything. The executive looked at Ted.</TE>
<TE>   "You're the shortest," he said. "You can start tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Eager for the money and pining for adventure, Giannoulas said yes.</TE>
<TE>   "Sixty seconds that changed my life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That first job was boring, it was embarrassing, the chicken suit
looked awful.</TE>
<TE>   But something happened when Giannoulas put it on.</TE>
<TE>   Where he was once worried about behaving like a man, suddenly he
could act like a fool.</TE>
<TE>   What Ted Giannoulas could never do, the Chicken could do with
abandon.</TE>
<TE>   "I discovered an untapped personality in that suit," he said. "It
was like, now I have freedom. Now I'm no longer Ted."</TE>
<TE>   When the gig ended, he convinced the radio station owners to allow
him to remain in the suit long enough to attend 1974 opening day for
the Padres.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted a free ticket, and I figured that was a way to get
it," Giannoulas said.</TE>
<TE>   People tend to stare at a chicken in a seat. Giannoulas liked
those stares. He started performing gags in the stands.</TE>
<TE>   He became so popular that, several months later, Padre officials
invited him to the field during the game to shoot a commercial.</TE>
<TE>   He lifted his leg on an umpire, and a star was born.</TE>
<TE>   When he won a lawsuit that freed him from the radio station and
allowed him to wear the chicken suit anywhere, that star became
national.</TE>
<TE>   He has since performed at the White House, worked with Elvis
Presley, written top-selling memoirs, appeared on every sort of
national stage and screen.</TE>
<TE>   But the one performance he will never forget is the only one
witnessed by his father.</TE>
<TE>   John Giannoulas never really accepted his son's job. He scoffed at
the suit.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't worry about my boy," he would tell friends. "Even the
president of the United States used to wash dishes."</TE>
<TE>   But in 1979, while fighting lung cancer that would take his life
less than two months later, he finally agreed to watch Ted's act.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember him wearing a beret, and pulling an oxygen tank," Ted
said.</TE>
<TE>   He paused, and it was clear that wasn't all he remembered.</TE>
<TE>   "My father laughed," said Ted softly, his eyes wide, as if he had
just heard that roar.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Chicken is fuming.</TE>
<TE>   He shows up in a Chicago White Sox clubhouse to say hello to old
friend Frank Thomas, and the player starts shouting.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't come near me," Thomas says. "Don't look at me, don't talk
to me, I want nothing to do with you."</TE>
<TE>   The Chicken shows up in a Boston Red Sox clubhouse, and several
players are suddenly too injured to help.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicken shows up in Philadelphia, and catcher Bo Diaz agrees
to be part of a gag, but only for money.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicken arrives in Baltimore, and Eddie Murray refuses to give
him a warmup ball for a trick.</TE>
<TE>   "If only these players knew how much the fans needed to see them
having fun," Giannoulas says later. "If only they had a clue."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Amy Schneider, a young marketing assistant with the Cincinnati
Reds, was asked about the Chicken.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never heard of the Chicken," she said. "There's a level of
seriousness at a major league park now that doesn't lend itself to
outside entertainment. The players and umpires don't want to be
distracted."</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Seraphin, marketing vice president of the Kansas City
Royals, was asked about the Chicken.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all economics," he said. "The gap between the size of a
Chicken crowd and a regular crowd has declined."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Oldham, president of the Class-A San Bernardino Stampede, was
asked about the Chicken.</TE>
<TE>   He answered in a different language.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to raise my son to be a Chicken," Oldham said. "He's a
living legend, the best, he can still fill a minor league park, still
make a five-figure difference that night."</TE>
<TE>   On this night in Salem, the game had long since ended, but the
entertainment continues.</TE>
<TE>   The line for autographs is filled with fidgety kids and laughing
adults. After two hours, a guy named Ray Woods shows up in front of
the Chicken with nothing in his hands.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't need an autograph, I don't need anything," he says. "It
was my kid's first game and I just wanted to say thank you."</TE>
<TE>   The Chicken shakes his head. Sometimes there is nothing even he
can say.</TE>
<TE>   The clock ticks past midnight when two teenage girls appear out of
the darkness for one final photo.</TE>
<TE>   The seventh inning was hours ago. The players have long since
departed. The balls and bats and gloves are locked up.</TE>
<TE>   Yet as the girls approach the Chicken they are singing, softly,
soulfully, their words softening the night like an old friend.</TE>
<TE>   "Take me out to the ballgame, take me out to the crowd ... "</TE>
<TE>   It is not a roar. It will have to do.</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Red Sox had Pedro Martinez to pitch a gem Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels countered Saturday with the Gang of Four. Kevin Appier,
with sore everything, walked the first batter on four pitches. But
all of a sudden it's the sixth inning and Appier still has a shutout.</LD>
<LD>   So in came Brendan Donnelly, 31, a perennial minor leaguer until
the Angels invited him to Anaheim in June. Donnelly's blue eyes and
fastball are blazing and he retired the side in the seventh on eight
pitches.</LD>
<TE>   Donnelly walked the first batter of the eighth, so in came Scott
Schoeneweis, the only lefty in the bullpen, a fierce competitor who
is unwilling to say he is comfortable being a middle reliever. "Say
I'm acclimated," Schoeneweis says. It's an attitude to appreciate,
because Schoeneweis had always been a starting pitcher until he quit
throwing strikes in April and May.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis retired the side on five pitches. He coaxed
pinch-hitter Carlos Baerga into lining into a double play.</TE>
<TE>   Being a relief pitcher is hard, Schoeneweis says. It's a whole new
routine and Schoeneweis says he has always been a stickler for
routine. So now his routine is a different routine every day.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis adjusts.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to," he says, "because I want to be on a winning team and
in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   No pouters allowed on the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   No malingerers, no whiners, no excuse-makers.</TE>
<TE>   Troy Percival came in to pitch the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   If there is an Angel in the bullpen somebody east of Riverside can
name, it is Percival the closer. He needed three pitches to retire
Nomar Garciaparra and Manny Ramirez, two of the best hitters in
baseball. But they can't make this too easy. Cliff Floyd whacked a
wicked, curving line drive that bounced off the glove of right
fielder Orlando Palmeiro and was called a double.</TE>
<TE>   Shea Hillenbrand fouled off five Percival fastballs. But finally
the game ended on a hard-hit ground ball to first baseman Scott
Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   Shouldn't Palmeiro have maybe caught that line drive? That's what
Angel Manager Mike Scioscia is being asked, in several different
ways. No, Scioscia says, he shouldn't have. It was a hard-hit ball
taking a crazy path. It was a double. Move on.</TE>
<TE>   That's what the Angels do. That's what their bullpen does. Move
on. Al Levine, Ben Weber, Scot Shields, Donnelly, Schoeneweis,
Percival.</TE>
<TE>   This is what the Angels are about.</TE>
<TE>   The bullpen. The bullpen that leads the American League in ERA
(3.04) and is second in saves with 41. The bullpen full of guys other
teams threw back (Levine had been with the White Sox and Rangers,
Weber with the Giants, Donnelly with the White Sox) or never wanted
(Shields).</TE>
<TE>   "The guys you hear about are the guys who make a lot of money,"
Schoeneweis says. "None of us makes a lot of money. Yet."</TE>
<TE>   Because the Angels had lost three of their last four games, and
because today they must face Boston All-Star Derek Lowe with his 17-5
record and his 2.19 ERA while the Red Sox will get to bat against
Mickey Callaway, 27, whose major league career so far consists of
four starts and two relief appearances for the dreadful Tampa Bay
Devil Rays, this group pitching effort was hugely important.</TE>
<TE>   Is it heresy to say that Callaway should fit right in, then, a
low-paid, anonymous figure who will probably toss a four-hitter and
get the win?</TE>
<TE>   No one back home thinks that. Callaway will get pounded, Lowe will
be unhittable. There seems to be a certain fatalism back home.
E-mails started arriving after Friday's 4-1 loss to Martinez
suggesting that this is the beginning of the end for the Angels, as
if Pedro doesn't blow away everybody.</TE>
<TE>   Trust isn't something Angels fans have. They see Tim Salmon and
Aaron Sele hit the disabled list and panic.</TE>
<TE>   They don't see young John Lackey pitching smartly and well as a
rookie starter or the way Spiezio is fielding everything sent his way
at first base and hitting hot too.</TE>
<TE>   They don't see the calm approach of pitching coach Bud Black or
the way Palmeiro was watching video of his three strikeouts before he
had showered Saturday so that he won't repeat the mistakes again.</TE>
<TE>   They don't see Salmon sitting on a couch with struggling Troy
Glaus, Salmon extending his arm and pointing to Glaus' hand, the
injured veteran talking hitting with the struggling young talent.
Glaus had thrown his bat angrily after striking out to end the eighth
inning. Salmon gives counsel and a pat on the back.</TE>
<TE>   And they don't want to get optimistic about the way Appier fights
his aches and pains and complicated mechanics to give the bullpen a
fighting chance. They don't want to believe what they see, the way
Donnelly fires out of the bullpen, throwing pitches in his head on
his way to the mound and then forgetting them by the time he's back
on the bench, a good mental place to be, never agonizing over what
has already happened and always preparing for what's going to happen.</TE>
<TE>   "A year ago I was in triple A and didn't know what was going to
happen," Donnelly says. "How can I not be happy?"</TE>
<TE>   "Have some chicken, it's good," Percival says as he walks past the
postgame buffet.</TE>
<TE>   In the Angel bullpen, everything is good. That's how it is when
you're the best.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm writing about women's basketball today, which tells you what I
think about baseball players these days.</LD>
<LD>   I hear Jeff Kent and Barry Bonds aren't in the lineup Saturday
with the Giants battling to keep up in the wild-card race, and right
away I'm jumping to the conclusion they're resting up to walk the
picket line.</LD>
<LD>   I hear Ross Porter on the radio talking about how the Dodgers will
be playing the third, fourth and fifth games of the National League
Championship Series in Dodger Stadium Oct. 12-13-14 and ticket
information will be forthcoming, and I can already see the toll this
labor unrest has taken on some people.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SO I went looking for something refreshing Saturday, only to run
into a frightening bunch of women, and just so there is no
misunderstanding here, I am not referring to crowd the Sparks draw to
their games.</TE>
<TE>   Let me explain: The Sparks were told they might play all three
championship games in Staples Center if Washington advances, and
obviously I was interested in this unusual development, because oh
boy, I'd get the opportunity to go to three more Sparks' games. The
MCI Center, where the Mystics play, has rented the building to the
Benny Hinn Miracle Crusade, and Hinn's supposed to begin healing the
afflicted Thursday night, the same night the WNBA Finals are to begin
in the East.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't care about saving people here, so we've told the WNBA
we're available for the whole series," said Michael Roth, a spokesman
for the money-making Staples Center. "I don't know anything about
Benny Hill, but we don't have those events here."</TE>
<TE>   Some people might look upon Benny Hinn's evangelical work and
regard it as a Benny Hill skit, but a check of Hinn's Web site
indicated there are scores of poor souls who are suffering, and who
come to these events with the expectation of being cured. I wonder
what he could do for someone with an ailing big toe who holds the key
to the Lakers' championship hopes.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks dominate the WNBA like the Lakers do the NBA, so
allowing them to stay home to win the title would be a pretty serious
credibility flaw in the WNBA's effort to sell its game. It might even
be enough to keep me away.</TE>
<TE>   I asked a WNBA official about it, and she said the sick and dying
will be removed from the MCI Center to make way for women's
basketball, and I guess you have to have that kind of killer instinct
if you're a league fighting for survival.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE SPARKS trounced Utah on Saturday, and I was told there were
two celebrities in attendance: Penny Marshall, who is apparently
homeless and living in Staples Center, and Michael Clarke Duncan, who
had the ability to heal in "The Green Mile." I wonder what he could
do for someone with an ailing big toe who holds the key to the
Lakers' championship hopes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A COURTSIDE ticket to the Sparks' playoff game cost $110. A
courtside ticket to the Lakers' championship series cost $1,750
because you might find yourself sitting next to Heather Locklear. I
wonder what some of the Sparks' fans would pay to sit next to Heather
Locklear.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE SPARKS' Booster Club, and I only saw two ladies so I presume
that's the club, auctioned off a ballot box used to accept All-Star
ballots earlier this season. Lisa Leslie autographed the box, and
below her signature, she added, "MVP."</TE>
<TE>   When I told Leslie, "That would be like me signing my name: T.J.
Simers, and then adding 'good looking,' "' she said, "But I am a
MVP."</TE>
<TE>   I have no idea where you would put a ballot box in your home, but
someone took it for $350. Someone else bid $145 for a Sparks' media
guide. I wonder what I could get for a Grocery Store Bagger who
thinks the Sparks are cool?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A GOOD-looking blond by the name of Chris Wragge was doing the
sideline reporting for NBC at the game, so I thought it only right to
ask the male announcer if he has been approached to model in any
women's magazines.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE ARE always constant reminders about what life could have
been like had I not been married. I just learned, for example, that a
few weeks ago the Sparks had a mixer for singles in the Staples
Center Arena Club before a game, and a reporter from another paper
said, "There were lots of women there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LESLIE SAID if the Sparks win the title again, she'd like a
parade. I asked if she had a better parade route than what I
suggested a year ago--a Ralphs parking lot--and she looked at me like
she shops at Vons.</TE>
<TE>   "How about the same route as the Lakers?" she said. A year ago the
Sparks had a celebration outside City Hall, and a number of the
street people who sleep in the area turned out for the party.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SPARK COACH Michael Cooper sure does a good job. Too bad no one
notices. "Staples seemed so empty," Leslie said, and I guess that's
because most of the seats were not filled for the playoff game. They
announced 10,000-plus, but that had to include bobblehead dolls for
sale in the gift shops.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SPARK PRESIDENT Johnny Buss had a "spark" tattooed to his left
wrist after last year's title.</TE>
<TE>   This year he had a pearl implanted between his lower lip and chin
to celebrate the team's first-round victory.</TE>
<TE>   If the team wins another title, I presume he'll have the
championship trophy surgically attached to his arm.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Paul Raffer:</TE>
<TE>   "Don't be so sure the Chargers are going to be a joke this year.
At least one can laugh in San Diego without choking.'</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to see Phil Mickelson try that.</TE>

<HD>A Deserving Stage for a Hungarian and Spanish Hero</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of sports' more touching moments occurred last week in Budapest,
where Hungary and Spain played to a 1-1 tie in a game that was, as
much as anything, a tribute to a man who had played for both
countries.</LD>
<LD>   Ferenc Puskas, the greatest of the "Magical Magyars" of the 1950s,
did a lap of honor in a motorized wheelchair before the game. Now 75
and hospitalized for the last two years, Puskas was nonetheless on
hand to see the former Nepstadion renamed in his honor.</LD>
<LD>   Puskas had played there for Hungary against Sweden when the
stadium was inaugurated in 1953. He and his fellow national team
players had even been photographed there during its construction.</LD>
<TE>   The Hungarians, with Puskas as their centerpiece, were the
dominant team of the 1950s. They won the gold medal at the 1952
Helsinki Olympics--with Puskas scoring one of the goals in a 2-0
victory over Yugoslavia in the final--and went on a 32-game unbeaten
streak that included momentous 6-3 and 7-1 victories over England.</TE>
<TE>   It all came to a sad end when Hungary was upset, 3-2, by West
Germany in the 1954 World Cup final in Berne, Switzerland. Two years
later, the Soviet tanks rolled in to crush the Hungarian uprising,
after which a disillusioned Puskas moved to Spain.</TE>
<TE>   He had scored 84 goals in 85 games for his country and 154 in 179
games for his club, Kispest/Honved, which he helped to five titles in
seven seasons after making his debut at 15. But even more marvelous
achievements awaited him in Spain.</TE>
<TE>   There, Puskas won five Spanish championships and five European
Cups with Real Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   He scored four goals in the team's 7-3 demolition of Germany's
Eintracht Frankfurt before 135,000 fans in Glasgow, Scotland, in the
1960 European Cup final that still is regarded as one of the sport's
greatest games.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Puskas, as a dual citizen, also played four times
for Spain, but his heart remained in Hungary and when the
no-longer-communist government invited him to return home in 1990, he
accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Naming the national stadium in honor of its greatest player was
the most fitting tribute Hungary could bestow and for Puskas to be
there in person made for an even more special evening.</TE>
<TE>   One for the Books</TE>
<TE>   Manchester United midfielder and England's captain David Beckham
has signed a multimillion-dollar book deal with HarperCollins for an
autobiography to be published in the fall of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be my first real autobiography," said Beckham, 27,
ignoring that only two years ago "David Beckham: My World" was on the
bookshelves. "I reckon I've had a pretty interesting career so far,
and I'm looking forward to telling my story in my own words for the
first time."</TE>
<TE>   The Guardian, for one, is unimpressed. The Manchester newspaper
reported that Beckham's "squeaky voice is matched only by his squeaky
clean private life."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps HarperCollins should have allowed Beckham's Spice Girl
wife, Victoria, to pocket the reported $3-million rights fee and tell
the inside story.</TE>
<TE>   Better yet would have been a new Puskas biography.</TE>
<TE>   It's Just Criminal</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Akiga, Nigeria's Minister for Sport, has an interesting
way of explaining why his crime-ridden country should stage the World
Cup in 2010.</TE>
<TE>   "South Africa is not more crime-free than we are," he said. "I
used to be Minister for Police Affairs, so I can see it from both
sides."</TE>
<TE>   Akiga might have a point. South Africa's crime problem extends all
the way to Irvin Khoza, the man who heads its bid committee to host
the 2010 world championship series.</TE>
<TE>   Khoza, who is also vice president of the country's soccer
federation as well as its professional league, was arrested recently
on tax evasion charges. That investigation brought to light earlier
convictions for insurance fraud and an arrest for drug possession,
and also disclosed Khoza's ties to drug traffickers.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of the World Cup going to Africa grows more ludicrous by
the day.</TE>
<TE>   Inscrutable United</TE>
<TE>   The English Premier League is hugely popular in Asia, with clubs
such as Manchester United and Liverpool counting fans in the
millions, thanks to television coverage of their games.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Newcastle United has taken that interest a step further.</TE>
<TE>   The club has applied to the China and Hong Kong soccer federations
for permission to enter a team in the Chinese League.</TE>
<TE>   It would be known as Hong Kong United, would play at the former
English colony's Happy Valley stadium and would feature a mix of
European and Chinese players.</TE>
<TE>   The team from the northeast of England, coached by former England
coach Bobby Robson and featuring former England striker Alan Shearer,
already has formed a close alliance with the Chinese league club
Dalian Shide. "Our name is very big in China," Freddy Shepherd,
Newcastle's chairman, told the Guardian. "The Far East is a fantastic
market waiting to be tapped. We aim to be at the forefront with our
slogan: 'North East 2 Far East.' "</TE>
<TE>   Then again, maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   Athens 2004</TE>
<TE>   Soccer fans will not necessarily have to brave the chaos that will
be Athens in 2004 because the Olympic men's and women's soccer
tournaments will also be played in four other Greek cities.</TE>
<TE>   Three of them are Patras, Thessalonika and Volos.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most intriguing venue is Iraklion on the island of
Crete.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Get to Enjoy a Summer Breeze</HD>
<DH>WNBA: They advance to Finals with 103-77 victory over
Starzz that is highlighted by 24-2 run.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sparks are back, and they're waiting for company.</LD>
<LD>   The defending champions returned to the WNBA Finals on Saturday by
sprinting past Utah, 103-77, at Staples Center to clinch the Western
Conference title with a two-game sweep.</LD>
<LD>   Amid the giddiness of an afternoon when the Sparks set a WNBA
playoff record with 103 points and led by as many as 30, the question
on some people's minds was this:</LD>
<TE>   Will it even matter whether it's Washington or New York that wins
the Eastern Conference title today?</TE>
<TE>   "I never say never with anybody--Washington's a fabulous team, New
York's a fabulous team," Utah Coach Candi Harvey said. "But they
better be playing near-perfect basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to take it from Tiger [Woods], but they better bring their
A, double-A and triple-A game, the way this team is playing.... I
mean, who are you going to leave open? Who are you not going to
guard?"</TE>
<TE>   Harvey called the Sparks' performance Saturday "fabulous
basketball" and Coach Michael Cooper said it was "the best I've ever
seen this team play" in his 3 1/2 years with the team.</TE>
<TE>   Try leaving the analysis to Latasha Byears, the brash and bruising
Spark forward:</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't even matter which team it is," Byears said. "It could
be the Chicago Bulls right now. That's how confident I am."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was less than a month ago that the Sparks lost
successive games at home and were beaten by Houston in a critical
game.</TE>
<TE>   Their defense was suspect, and the offense seemed confused unless
it could get the ball to Lisa Leslie or watch Mwadi Mabika go
one-on-one.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, they are transformed.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie scored 25 Saturday in front of a crowd of 10,139, but every
other starter reached double figures too.</TE>
<TE>   DeLisha Milton, back in the lineup after a stint off the bench,
contributed 19 and her usual high-energy defense. Tamecka Dixon, the
darting guard who is peaking at the right time, had 15 points and
eight assists. Mabika had 15 points, nine rebounds and five assists
despite a sore ankle, and rookie point guard Nikki Teasley had 11
points and nine assists in 24 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks shot 51% overall, made 11 of 23 three-pointers and 16
of 18 from the line, and played an up-tempo, crisp-passing game that
led to 31 assists on 38 baskets.</TE>
<TE>   The 24-2 run they started seven minutes into the game took them
from six points behind to a 34-18 lead--and that was the ballgame.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt like the Lakers of the '80s," Dixon said. "We just let
the ball find the open player tonight, and that was evident with the
31 assists. Call it 'the zone'--and everybody was in it."</TE>
<TE>   Margo Dydek, the 7-foot-2 Utah center, gives plenty of teams
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "Margo against most teams is fabulous," Harvey said. "But against
this particular team, the way they take us outside and force us to
guard the three-pointer, their versatility at the post position
really, really bothers us."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie showcased her versatility at 6-5 with a baseline drive
punctuated by a spin move that would make a guard proud, and she made
one of three three-point shots as she continually drew Dydek away
from the basket.</TE>
<TE>   The Spark defense did its job too, rotating sharply and helping
force 18 turnovers that led to 28 points.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Marie Ferdinand, Dydek and Natalie Williams were held to
single digits, with Adrienne Goodson and Jennifer Azzi leading the
way for Utah with 16 points. Azzi added 12 assists.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so much of a mind-set with this team," Harvey said. "It's
not just physical, what to do X-and O-wise, but you better match
their mentality also."</TE>
<TE>   Their mentality is focused on the WNBA title.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the second championship, and I think most importantly, we
want our respect," Milton said. "It seems like whatever we do, no one
really wants to give us our just due."</TE>
<TE>   The only way they can get that is to win the series that will open
Thursday against either New York, a team the Sparks split with during
the regular season, or Washington, an upstart led by Chamique
Holdsclaw that the Sparks defeated in their only meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper doesn't think it matters which team it is.</TE>
<TE>   "[The players] understand now not only what it takes to become a
champion but to repeat as champion," he said. "This wasn't one of our
better seasons, so to say, if you want to call seven losses bad. But
right now, we're at the point where I think we were all last year."</TE>
<TE>   They just want to finish in the same place, too.</TE>
<TE>   "I just told Coop, I'm not going to allow us to lose another
game," Leslie said</TE>

<KH>TENNIS LISA DILLMAN</KH>
<HD>Who Might Have a 'Bye at the Open This Year?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This sport isn't one for grand farewell tours. There is an exception
here and there, of course, most notably Chris Evert's final U.S. Open
in 1989, which seemed to reduce everyone on the grounds to tears.</LD>
<LD>   A retirement usually comes at a hastily arranged news conference
(Steffi Graf) or is issued with a brief communique. Then, quite
often, you have the unretirement, like Boris Becker giving Wimbledon
one more try.</LD>
<LD>   Which is why it might be good to pay close attention at the U.S.
Open, which starts Monday, to the matches of Pete Sampras, Michael
Chang, Todd Martin, Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, Monica Seles and
Spaniards Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez.</LD>
<TE>   Rest assured, none of them has announced anything about
retirement, and Sampras even made a point of saying last week he
would assess his future at the end of 2003. Kafelnikov has veered the
closest to saying this might be it, especially if Russia should win
the Davis Cup this year.</TE>
<TE>   But who knew that Graf's loss in the Wimbledon final in 1999 would
be her final Slam? It's always difficult for a player near the end,
no matter the sport, to see a true picture. CBS and USA Network
commentator John McEnroe was asked about Sampras, who lost in the
second round at Wimbledon and has won three matches in his last three
events.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he sees it, but he doesn't want to admit it," McEnroe
said. "This guy has won 13 Grand Slams, seven Wimbledons, got to the
final of the Open last year. He's had fairly recent success.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard as an athlete in any sport to just walk away at the
right time, or to feel like you know when that time is or not to
believe. Especially a guy who's had the success of a Pete Sampras,
unprecedented. Why wouldn't he believe, at 31 years of age, that he
still can win? There's got to be a lot of conflict going on in his
mind. On one hand, he hasn't won a tournament since he broke the
record [at Wimbledon 2000], and on the other hand, he still believes
he can play with the best of them when he gets his confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Having said all that, McEnroe believes Sampras will continue
through 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be surprised if he walked away from it. I bet he would at
least give it through next year," McEnroe said.</TE>
<TE>   Said commentator and former No. 1 player Tracy Austin: "When is
the right time? We've had people [go] out when they're still at the
top. Chris went out still at the top. Steffi went out still at the
top. Martina [Navratilova] wasn't at the top anymore. It's tough to
time it perfectly. You really have to feel fulfilled. I think Pete
wouldn't be there if he didn't have a shot."</TE>
<TE>   Early-Round Fever</TE>
<TE>   Best first-round matches (men): Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain vs.
Wayne Arthurs of Argentina. Arthurs, often called the man who could
not be broken, is a nightmare opponent. The left-hander and his
formidable serve took out Andy Roddick on clay in the first round of
the French Open. Others worth watching are James Blake vs. wild card
Brian Vahaly and Marcelo Rios of Chile vs. Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   Best possible second-round match (men): Roddick vs. Taylor Dent.
They have never played in a Slam or ATP tournament, but Dent, of
Huntington Beach, has won a singles title more recently than Roddick,
taking his first career title in July, on grass at Newport, R.I.</TE>
<TE>   Interesting possible second-round match (women): Anna Kournikova
vs. Alexandra Stevenson. Of course, they have to get there.
Stevenson, who has struggled this summer, will play Stephanie Foretz
of France and Kournikova will face Angelique Widjaja of Indonesia. In
their last meeting, Kournikova defeated Stevenson easily this summer
at Carlsbad, reducing Stevenson to tears.</TE>
<TE>   Nod From Martina</TE>
<TE>   Navratilova is probably a better judge than most to assess the
Open, considering she has been playing doubles and observing at
Carlsbad, Manhattan Beach and Montreal, among other places.</TE>
<TE>   "I picked Serena [Williams] for the French and Wimbledon and she
won those," she said. "For the Open ... I think Venus [Williams]
should be the hungrier one. She seems to be playing well. I would put
Venus a slight favorite over Serena."</TE>
<TE>   As for potential challengers, with the emphasis on potential,
Navratilova pointed out Jennifer Capriati has been struggling and
Seles has been injured. She thinks Lindsay Davenport could be the
one.</TE>
<TE>   "She's going to keep getting better and better and she'll be fresh
and ready to go," Navratilova said. "So probably Lindsay would have a
better chance of beating either Venus or Serena than anybody, but you
still have to pick a Williams to win the whole thing because somebody
will likely have to beat both of them and that's proven pretty
difficult in the past."</TE>
<TE>   Positive Drug Test</TE>
<TE>   It was surprising enough that a female player was suspended for
three months and fined $23,347 for using a banned substance. What put
it on a different level was that the substance was cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the WTA announced that 21-year-old Lourdes Dominguez
Lino of Spain had tested positive for metabolites of cocaine. The
drug test was in March at a clay-court event in Acapulco.</TE>
<TE>   Though Mats Wilander and Karol Novacek tested positive for cocaine
in 1996 at the French Open, this is believed to be the first case on
the women's side. Dominguez Lino is ranked No. 158 and the penalties
will knock her out of the top 300.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Venus Williams is headed to the U.S. Open on a roll.</LD>
<LD>   The two-time defending Open champion beat Lindsay Davenport, 7-5,
6-0, Saturday at New Haven, Conn., to win her fourth consecutive
Pilot Pen title. She is the first woman to win the same tournament
four years in a row since Monica Seles did it in the Canadian Open
from 1995-98.</LD>
<LD>   Williams has won 13 straight matches heading into the year's final
Grand Slam event, which begins Monday.</LD>
<TE>   "Technically I feel pretty sound," said Williams, who has beaten
Davenport for the Pilot Pen title three of the last four years. "I
know in the big matches in the Open, the best players have to be able
to come through technically.</TE>
<TE>   "When my techniques start to break, that's when I start to lose
it."</TE>
<TE>   She hasn't lost much this year, improving to 51-6 with the win
over Davenport, who was playing in her fourth tournament since
returning last month from knee surgery. Davenport has made it to two
semifinals and two finals in her comeback.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport started out crisply. She broke the top-seeded Williams
in the first game with strong returns and passing shots.</TE>
<TE>   Up a break in the first set and leading, 5-3, Davenport began to
unravel with several unforced errors and went winless the rest of the
way, losing 10 straight games.</TE>
<TE>   "Against a lot of players you can have your kind of lapse and it's
not that big a deal," Davenport said. "Against her, she then takes
advantage of it. She's able to play better at the bigger moments."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Juan Ignacio Chela and Paradorn Srichaphan advanced to the final
of the of TD Waterhouse tournament at Commack, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Chela defeated Alex Corretja 6-2, 2-6, 6-4, and Srichaphan
advanced on a walkover when Tommy Haas was unable to play because of
injury.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was Chela's third in a row over Corretja on hard
courts this year.</TE>

<HD>Big Plays, Big Mistakes in Scrimmage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bruins were unanimous in their praise of Cal Lutheran as a
training camp site, but arriving home was sweet, especially with
about 2,000 fans, the band and cheerleaders at Spaulding Field on
Saturday afternoon to watch an intrasquad scrimmage.</LD>
<LD>   The defense dominated the two-hour scrimmage until the offense
scored several times in a row during a red zone drill on flashy plays
by running backs Jason Harrison and Manuel White, tight end Mike
Seidman and receiver Junior Taylor.</LD>
<LD>   Early on, several defenders made big plays, including safety Matt
Ware (53-yard fumble return for a touchdown), cornerback Ricky
Manning (interception), tackle Ryan Boschetti (51-yard interception
return for a touchdown) and end Kevin Harbour (two sacks).</LD>
<TE>   "I expected the defense to have the upper hand this early in
camp," Coach Bob Toledo said. "But we made a lot of mistakes, a lot
of things people can't see like missing assignments and not knowing
plays."</TE>
<TE>   And some things anyone could see, such as at least a half dozen
fumbles. Starting tailback Akil Harris fumbled twice, as did freshman
Tyler Ebell, who dropped a kickoff and a punt.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell also made the most electrifying play, a 53-yard touchdown
run, and led all rushers with 82 yards in seven carries.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really exciting," Toledo said. "Either he's going to make a
big play or he's going to fumble and they are going to make a big
play."</TE>
<TE>   Senior quarterback Cory Paus completed three of five passes for 50
yards, hitting Ryan Smith on a 27-yard pass. Paus also connected with
Seidman several times in the red zone drill, which was not reflected
in the statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Olson, the most impressive of three freshmen quarterbacks
most of the week, took a step back, completing only two of seven for
15 yards and giving Boschetti a gift interception when the ball
squirted out of his hand. Matt Moore completed six of 12 for 65
yards. Redshirt freshman John Sciarra was three for five for 36
yards.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Marcedes Lewis lined up at receiver and tight end and was
a frequent target on short passes, making five receptions for 41
yards.</TE>
<TE>   There were no serious injuries during the scrimmage. Reserve
linebacker Patrick Pierre-Louis hurt a shoulder and fullback Pat
Norton sprained an ankle.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   During the morning practice, receiver Craig Bragg hobbled around
with ice strapped to his sore left knee and pulled right hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was the Westwood turf, but upon returning to campus Bragg
shook off the injuries and participated in a handful of plays during
the scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal is to be 100% by the time we scrimmage at the Rose Bowl
on Wednesday," Bragg said.</TE>
<TE>   Bragg, a sophomore, led the Bruins with 29 receptions last season,
rushed for two touchdowns on reverses and also returned punts and
kicks. He is considered perhaps the team's greatest big-play threat.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want to make sure he doesn't aggravate those minor nicks
and bumps," Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Instead of gathering as usual when the horn sounded ending the
morning practice--the team's last at Cal Lutheran--all 104 players
walked to the 300 or so spectators lining the sideline and spent five
minutes shaking their hands and thanking them for their support.</TE>
<TE>   One of the highlights of what turned out to be an enjoyable,
distraction-free training camp at the Thousand Oaks campus was the
daily turnout of fans.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like being in an NFL camp," Seidman said. "It was a great
crowd every day."</TE>

<HD>Leinart Doesn't Pass Test</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last day of training camp could have been a showcase for USC
backup quarterback Matt Leinart.</LD>
<LD>   With Carson Palmer and almost every other starter held out of a
scrimmage on Saturday, Leinart was positioned to firmly grasp the No.
2 role that became available for the Sept. 2 opener against Auburn
when Matt Cassel was injured last week.</LD>
<LD>   Leinart, however, completed only eight of 18 passes for 62 yards
with two interceptions. His first pass bounced off fullback Chad
Pierson and was picked off by Sandy Fletcher. His second was dropped
by receiver Kareem Kelly.</LD>
<TE>   That set the tone for an offense that rushed for only 49 yards in
23 carries, fumbled three times and scored only one touchdown during
the 45-play scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   "Early on, we had a few dropped balls and I think everyone kind of
just fell apart," said Leinart, who also had two passes intercepted
in a scrimmage Monday. "It's my job to get the offense back together.
It's my job to keep things clicking, and I didn't do that."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Pete Carroll said the scrimmage "was not the final, 'OK
let's see where everything is' " test for a team that has been
riddled with injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "The offense just got kind of overwhelmed at the line of
scrimmage," Carroll said. "We didn't throw the ball very well, we
didn't run the ball--we didn't do anything. It was a defensive day,
totally."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There were no major surprises when USC released its depth chart
after the scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Fred Matua is listed No. 1 at right guard. However,
senior Zach Wilson is scheduled to return from a foot injury Monday
and his presence at guard or tackle could result in some shuffling.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Bernard Riley, recovering from knee surgery, is listed
behind sophomore Mike Patterson at nose tackle, and sophomore Gregg
Guenther and junior Alex Holmes are co-starters at tight end. Senior
transfer Justin Fargas missed a week because of a hamstring strain,
so seniors Sultan McCullough and Malaefou MacKenzie are co-starters
at tailback.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough and Hershel Dennis will return kickoffs and Kelly will
return punts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Dominique Byrd, converted from tight end to defensive end
last week, deflected a pass by Leinart that was intercepted by
freshman linebacker Dallas Sartz.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd is listed second on the depth chart behind junior Omar Nazel
and will see significant playing time against Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been working on getting off the line and being quick," Byrd
said. "They want me to be athletic and I think I've been showing what
I can do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said he was pleased with his team's performance during a
13-day camp that was notable for the number of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the attitude we took through the camp," he said. "I like
that guys came back after being hurt and we're back to just about
full strength going into game week.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a little bit untested right now. The Auburn game is going
to be huge. They're going to be good and loaded up and all that. It's
going to be very difficult."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tailback Darryl Poston, who has been slowed by hamstring and back
problems, gained 12 yards in five carries and scored on a six-yard
run.... David Davis kicked a 31-yard field goal.... Sophomore
linebacker Bobby Otani led the defense with five tackles.... Fargas
and cornerback Ronald Nunn ran sprints in the end zone before the
scrimmage. Both are expected to return from hamstring injuries
Tuesday.... The Trojans will simulate game-day procedures today at
the Coliseum.</TE>

Fame and the last pitcher to throw a no-hitter against the New York
Yankees, has died.</LD>
<LD>   Wilhelm died Friday of heart failure, said his widow, Peggy.
Baseball records listed him at 79 years old, though the funeral home
handling the arrangements said he was 80.</LD>
<LD>   Wilhelm played from 1952 to 1972 and when he retired, at 49, he
held the major league record for games pitched at 1,070. Jesse Orosco
and Dennis Eckersley have since passed that mark.</LD>
<TE>   "He had the best knuckleball you'd ever want to see," recalled
former Baltimore teammate Brooks Robinson, a fellow Hall of Famer.
"He knew where it was going when he threw it. But when he got two
strikes on you, he'd break out one that even he didn't know where it
was going."</TE>
<TE>   While known for his fluttering pitch--it was because of him that
catchers began using an oversized mitt--Wilhelm had a smashing debut
as a big leaguer.</TE>
<TE>   On April 23, 1952, Wilhelm hit a home run in his first major
league at-bat, connecting for the New York Giants at the Polo
Grounds. That turned out to be Wilhelm's only career homer.</TE>
<TE>   Wilhelm was 143-122 with 227 saves and a 2.52 ERA for nine teams,
including the Dodgers and Angels. A five-time All-Star, he played
mostly for the Giants, Baltimore and the Chicago White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Wilhelm was elected to the Hall in 1985. Rollie Fingers is the
only other reliever in the Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The White Sox held a moment of silence for Wilhelm at Comiskey
Park before Saturday night's game against Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Wilhelm is the third Hall of Famer to die in the last two months.
Ted Williams and Enos Slaughter also died.</TE>
<TE>   Wilhelm, who won a Purple Heart at the Battle of the Bulge, got a
late start to his major league career. He was in his late 20s when
the Giants decided to give him a chance in their bullpen in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants were glad they did, as the rookie went 15-3 with 11
saves and a league-leading 2.43 ERA in 71 relief appearances.</TE>
<TE>   In 1959, a year after his no-hitter against the Yankees, the
Orioles kept Wilhelm in the starting rotation. He went 15-11 and led
the AL with a 2.19 ERA--it was the last year in which Wilhelm did not
record a save.</TE>
<TE>   Wilhelm is survived by a son, two daughters, two brothers and six
sisters.</TE>

<HD>Red-Hot Liberty Forces Game 3</HD>
<DH>WNBA: New York shoots 71% in first half and stops Holdsclaw

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The New York Liberty shot 71% in the first half and contained the
league's leading scorer, Chamique Holdsclaw, as it rolled over the
Washington Mystics, 96-79, Saturday night before 13,851 at Madison
Square Garden.</LD>
<LD>   The Liberty returns to the Garden tonight for Game 3, hoping to
advance to the WNBA Finals for the fourth time in the league's
six-year history.</LD>
<LD>   The winner will play the defending champion Sparks.</LD>
<TE>   Tari Phillips scored 15 of her 23 points in the first half and
made 11 of 13 shots. Tamika Whitmore also had 23 points for the
Liberty.</TE>
<TE>   Vickie Johnson added 18 points, making all five of her three-point
shots. New York went seven for eight from behind the arc and shot a
WNBA playoff-record 66% (35 for 53).</TE>
<TE>   Holdsclaw had a quiet 14 points and two rebounds, sitting out the
final seven minutes with the game out of hand. She averaged 20 points
and 11 rebounds in the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first game in my life I've had one defensive rebound,"
Holdsclaw said. "We just have to throw this out the window and get
ready for the next game."</TE>
<TE>   New York had a 48-26 advantage in the paint.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy when you make every basket," New York Coach Richie
Adubato said.</TE>

<HD>Magical Moment for the Sparks</HD>

<LD>The Sparks beat Utah five times this year--twice in the
playoffs--because they were able to put up big numbers against the
Starzz. In their first game, July 7, the Sparks scored 102 points. On
Saturday, they got 103. In between, they never scored fewer than 75.</LD>
<LD>   But the numbers that got the Sparks back to the WNBA Finals were
24-2. That was the supersized scoring run the Sparks rolled on Utah
midway in the first half, a run that broke the will, the hearts and
the pride of the Starzz and led to a 103-77 victory at Staples
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Guard Jennifer Azzi's three-pointer with 13:15 left in the first
half gave Utah its biggest lead, 16-10. For the next 6:38, the Starzz
could muster only two free throws by Marie Ferdinand.</LD>
<TE>   And the Sparks got hot.</TE>
<TE>   DeLisha Milton began the surge with a 16-foot jumper. That was
quickly followed by a layup by Lisa Leslie, and another Milton jumper
to tie the score.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the pivotal play. Utah guard Adrienne Goodson rebounded
a missed Sparks' shot and turned up court. She didn't see Latasha
Byears, who had just replaced Leslie, standing in her path.</TE>
<TE>   Byears tapped away the ball, Nikki Teasley scooped it up and fed
Byears for an easy layup.</TE>
<TE>   Although the score would be tied, for the last time, on
Ferdinand's free throws, the Starzz looked like grilled steaks before
hikers returning from a 10-mile walk. The Sparks threw a net over
Utah, which didn't help itself by taking the first open shot it had.
The Starzz' misses were turned into fastbreaks by the Sparks.</TE>
<TE>   Tamecka Dixon slashed through the lane, threw in a 12-footer and
was fouled for a three-point play. Milton nailed a three-pointer.
Leslie, back in the game, dribbled toward the basket, then put a spin
move on Goodson that left her on Figueroa Street while Leslie had an
easy deuce. The next time down, all five Sparks touched the ball,
working it around until the Starzz were out of the way for another
easy shot.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Coach Lin Dunn, working as a television analyst on
Saturday, shook her head. "They're too good when they run," she said
of the Sparks. "You have to slow down every possession. You should
never shoot with more than three seconds left on the clock."</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen straight points later, the 24-2 run was done. The Sparks
were ahead, 34-18, and could start checking air fares to New York and
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "That was like the old Lakers' 'Showtime,' " said Coach Michael
Cooper, who should know. "You had some of everything in there in that
stretch. That was some of the best basketball I've ever seen us play
in my three years here. They executed on offense, executed on
defense, they were playing together; even the players on the bench
felt they were part of it."</TE>
<TE>   For the Sparks, it was just a matter of playing their game.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't really realize the kind of run you put on a team until
it's over, when someone calls a timeout or there's a dead ball,"
Dixon said. "Then you look at the scoreboard and go, 'Wow!' Then you
want to focus on not letting them back in the game. I remember seeing
we had a substantial lead and thinking, 'We have to put them away
now.' "</TE>
<TE>   But some of the Sparks sensed something special was taking place.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a scary feeling, because this is what we've been trying to
get to all season," Sophia Witherspoon said. "When we play like this,
we feel no one can stop us. The team is starting to see its destiny."</TE>
<TE>   Added Byears: "It was like a wave of energy that touched us. You
could see everybody was clicking. And it was beautiful to watch."</TE>
<TE>   Unless you were from Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "Basketball is a game of momentum," Azzi said. "And when a team
gets rolling, especially one with this much talent, they are
impossible to stop."</TE>

<HD>Courage Completes Drastic Turnaround</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Carolina, tied for last place in 2001, beats
Washington, 3-2, to win WUSA championship game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Danielle Fotopoulos scored one goal and set up another as the
Carolina Courage completed its turnaround season, holding off Mia
Hamm and the Washington Freedom for a 3-2 victory in the WUSA
championship game Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The Courage, which also won the regular-season title, denied Hamm
another milestone.</LD>
<LD>   The all-time leading international scorer in women's soccer
already had World Cup and Olympic championships on her resume. Hamm
came up short in the 2-year-old league she helped found, despite a
brilliant goal in the 64th minute.</LD>
<TE>   Carolina and Washington tied for last place in the eight-team
WUSA's inaugural season.</TE>
<TE>   Fotopoulos actually scored twice, deflecting a shot into her own
net for Washington's first goal. She redeemed herself in the 53rd,
scoring off a rebound to break a 1-1 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina scored again five minutes later to go ahead, 3-1, taking
advantage of a mistake by Washington captain Jennifer Grubb. When
Grubb cleared the ball lazily in front of her own goal, Birgit Prinz
took it away and scored on a breakaway against Washington goalkeeper
Siri Mullinix.</TE>
<TE>   Prinz was named the game's MVP.</TE>
<TE>   Hamm, who sat out nearly half the season after knee surgery, stuck
with her role as a reserve. She entered at the start of the second
half, drawing cheers from the announced crowd of 15,321 every time
she touched the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Hamm's goal brought the Freedom within 3-2. Defended by Staci
Burt, Hamm cut suddenly to her right and unleashed a right-footed
shot from about 15 yards that curled into the top corner of the net.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina goalie Kristin Luckenbill made a great save when Bai Jie
got loose in front of the goal in the 67th minute. Hamm had several
other chances to score, the best coming in the 82nd minute when a
close shot from a bad angle was swatted away by Luckenbill.</TE>
