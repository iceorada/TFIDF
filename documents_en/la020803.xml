<HD>Recalling Frank Inn: 'I Can Train Anything'</HD>
<DH>The animal acting coach is fondly remembered by the writer
who happily found 'People's Choice's' Cleo with Inn's help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRVING BRECHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was saddened when I read in The Times the obituary of Frank Inn, a
gentle and remarkably expert animal trainer who died last Saturday.
In 1955, I thought up a sitcom, "The People's  Choice,"  and cast
Jackie Cooper as the lead. Cooper was the memorable child star in the
1931 movie "The Champ." In my show, he played Socrates Miller, an
agent for the Bureau of Wildlife. Sock Miller lived in a trailer with
his dog, a slow-moving, droopy-eared and sad-eyed basset hound named
Cleo.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Inn's skill and patience as Cleo's "acting coach"--he liked
my calling him that, saying, "The dog respects me more"--had much to
do with the success of "People's Choice." Cleo was a smash. She did
her funny shtick on cue, but it was her one-liners that made her
hilarious and unique. Unique in that we didn't have Cleo talk. All
other movie and TV animals were made to move their lips, via
mechanical or chemical devices that were often cruelly painful.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, I tried something different that, happily, paid off.
Whenever Cleo saw or heard something to ridicule, we'd cut to a
close-up of her, eyes into the camera. You heard her thought, usually
some kind of stinging criticism, in a female voice with a Groucho
Marx-style of delivery.</LD>
<TE>   These throwaways, put-downs and off-the-wall comments were
directed at Cooper and his girlfriend, Mandy Peoples, played by a
lovely young actress named Patricia Breslin. This "thinking out loud
for comic results" device was copied years later in a John Travolta
movie, "Look Who's Talking," using a baby. I prefer my dog. Because I
had written two movies for Groucho and his brothers, writing Cleo's
dialogue--her "strange interludes"--was second nature for me.</TE>
<TE>   Show business is not necessarily recognized as famous for loyalty
or gratitude. But Frank Inn was. Certainly by me. He started his own
business in 1954, after working for Rudd Weatherwax, the
owner-trainer of dogs that played Rin Tin Tin and Lassie (who was
good-looking but dumb; never said a funny word--unlike Cleo). Cleo
was Frank's big break. He was a wizard. He showed incredible patience
and never got angry at the animal. He brought her every day in his
pickup to the studio on McCadden Place. I remember one time he
trained her to walk up to a fishbowl and stick her face right into
it, without harming the fish. (The goldfish was an actor too, working
for scale.)</TE>
<TE>   Despite the runaway popularity and appeal of Cleo, Frank never
demanded that we tear up his contract and increase his fees. I liked
that. I suggested he train the actors.</TE>
<TE>   He Wanted a Beagle; He Got a Basset Hound</TE>
<TE>   I lucked into Cleo in terms of casting. Before shooting the pilot,
I had some trainers bring in animals. Frank came in from Sun Valley
with five or six basset hounds on leashes. I said, "No basset hounds,
Mr. Inn. They're sad-looking, sweet animals, but very lethargic. I
need a beagle."</TE>
<TE>   Frank didn't have a beagle but urged me to give him a chance with
one of his bassets. He needed the opportunity, and while they were
milling around, one puppy slipped the leash and came running across
my office right onto my chair. I was smitten.</TE>
<TE>   I said, "Frank, do you think you can train this?" And with simple
confidence he said, "I can train anything."</TE>
<TE>   I tried several actresses to find the right voice to convey Cleo's
thoughts to the TV audience. And finally I struck gold with Mary Jane
Croft, whom I had used often on my radio show, "The Life of Riley."
Mary was a perfect Cleo. Her zingers never failed to get a laugh.
Cleo made the cover of TV Guide three times. In fact, after she hit
the air, more people began breeding basset hounds.  You used to see
quite a few of them around. The hound received fan mail from around
the country. Even proposals for marriage, signed by Rover or Spot or
Prince. I showed some of these to Frank. He sniffed the letters and
quipped, "If you want my opinion, Irv, these were not written by
animals."</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Cooper went on to star in "Hennesey" (1959-62), playing a
Navy medical officer.</TE>
<TE>   I went back to writing movies, and Frank Inn went on to help make
famous other four-legged performers like Arnold the pig and Benji.</TE>
<TE>   As I look back on my experiences working with some beautiful
actresses like Carole Lombard, Lucille Ball, Betty Hutton, Judy
Garland, Myrna Loy, Ann-Margret--all were wonderful to deal with and
very appreciative of my efforts. But Cleo was the only one who ever
licked my hand.</TE>

<HD>Many Scores and Several Years Ago ...</HD>
<DH>Music* David Raksin started his remarkable Hollywood
composing career thanks to Charlie Chaplin. As he turns 90, there's
little slowing down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON BURLINGAME</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Raksin--the composer of memorable scores for films such as
"Laura," "The Bad and the Beautiful" and "Forever Amber," and widely
considered the dean of Hollywood movie music--turns 90 Sunday, and he
approaches the milestone with a predictable measure of good humor.</LD>
<LD>   How does it feel?</LD>
<LD>   "One year better than turning 89," he quips.</LD>
<TE>   Seated in the living room of his modest Encino home, surrounded by
books, papers, CDs and a calendar still filled with commitments,
Raksin is almost as busy as ever and seems to be enjoying life.</TE>
<TE>   "I occupy a kind of special position in my profession," he says
with evident satisfaction. "I rarely work at it anymore. But I'm sort
of an honored elder citizen, which is a nice way to live. I'm
deferred to and all that. And as one of my old friends in
Philadelphia would say in this respect, 'That and a nickel will get
you a bus ride.' " Raksin is the last surviving major composer of
Hollywood's Golden Age.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has just two Oscar nominations (for "Forever Amber" in
1947 and "Separate Tables" in 1958), several of his other scores have
attained classic status, including "Force of Evil" (1948), "The Bad
and the Beautiful" (1952) and "Carrie" (1952). He also composed the
theme for TV's "Ben Casey" (1961) and the music for the much-watched
TV movie "The Day After" (1983).</TE>
<TE>   But Raksin will always be best known as the composer of "Laura."
Written in 1944 for the Gene Tierney-Dana Andrews detective drama, it
was a hit (with lyrics by Johnny Mercer) and spawned an estimated 400
recordings over the succeeding half-century.</TE>
<TE>   Raksin's symphonic arrangement of "Laura" is being played more
than a dozen times this year in commemoration of the composer's
birthday. The Henry Mancini Institute Orchestra will perform it
tonight at Royce Hall, and John Mauceri will conduct it with the
Hollywood Bowl Orchestra later this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Cole Porter once said that, of all the tunes that he didn't write
but wished he had, "Laura" topped his personal list. What made it so
popular, and why has it endured? Raksin's not sure, even after all
these years.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's an answer, I don't know," he says. "It has certain
qualities that make it memorable."</TE>
<TE>   He insists that he's not bothered by the notion that people
remember "Laura" but don't remember any of the other 120-plus scores
he's written for movies. "It's one of those things where you've got
to accept what people decide about you. The world is full of
composers who have written stuff, some of it probably better than
this, and nobody even knows who they are. So I am very, very glad to
be remembered."</TE>
<TE>   But Raksin's not just sitting around collecting the royalties for
"Laura." He's spent the past couple of years writing a book titled
"If I Say So Myself."</TE>
<TE>   "It is an autobiography, in a sense. An autobiography is when you
try to tell the truth. A memoir is when you try not to lie too
often," he adds with a laugh. He's nearly finished and says he's
looking at different publishers. He's hoping it will be accompanied
by a CD or two of his music.</TE>
<TE>   He also continues to teach in the film-scoring program at USC, and
to compose, although he hasn't written movie music since TV's "Lady
in a Corner" in 1991. "From time to time I will write a new song, or
come up with a melody that I think is worth writing down," he says.</TE>
<TE>   His last major work was for the concert hall, the result of an
Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation commission and performed at the
Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., in 1986. "Oedipus
Memneitai," Latin for "Oedipus Remembers," was a 38-minute piece for
six-part mixed chorus, 17-piece chamber ensemble and bass-baritone
soloist.</TE>
<TE>   It depicts the classic Greek tragedy figure on the last day of his
life. "Oedipus exemplifies the kind of person," Raksin says, "who has
an amazing fame, or notoriety, despite the fact that he was a
transgressor. I loved the idea of that."</TE>
<TE>   He is proud of the work ("it was very interesting and very odd")
and of the fact that the Library of Congress has also asked for his
papers, an unusual perk for a composer best known for his movie
music. "It's a very rare honor. I have so much junk," he says with a
wink, "it will be in good hands, instead of winding up under a lot of
dust."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Raksin house is top-to-bottom with letters, scores,
photographs and memorabilia for the Library of Congress--missives
from Aldous Huxley, Adlai Stevenson, Aaron Copland, Igor Stravinsky;
tapes of many of his radio appearances, including his 64-part 1970s
public radio series "The Subject Is Film Music"; scores for his film
and TV music, concert pieces and his 1946 Broadway musical, "If the
Shoe Fits," based on the Cinderella story; and even sketches by
Charlie Chaplin.</TE>
<TE>   Chaplin was the reason he came to Hollywood in 1935, from a
background of dance-band playing and arranging for Broadway and
radio. Raksin collaborated with him on the music for "Modern Times,"
writing down Chaplin's hummed and whistled tunes and arranging them
into an orchestral score.</TE>
<TE>   Chaplin soon fired him for insubordination--Raksin was 23 at the
time--but music director Alfred Newman, who saw what Raksin was
writing, persuaded Chaplin to reconsider, and the composer and the
comedian eventually became fast friends.</TE>
<TE>   That high level of self-confidence, and his tendency to say what
was on his mind, seems to have been a common thread throughout his
career. It cost him jobs because producers, directors or studio
executives "were not willing to be offended by a guy who said, 'I
think we can do better than that.' I was considered a bit too
independent." Still, he adds, "I got my way a great deal of the
time."</TE>
<TE>   He got out of the business "because I was very disheartened by the
way in which demands were put and jobs were offered. What they wanted
was something really rather cheap and vulgar, and I was not about to
do that on purpose when I was in danger of doing it accidentally," he
says, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   In conversation he often mentions his family, with whom he says he
will spend his birthday: son Alex (an editorial writer for The Times
who recently won a Pulitzer Prize), daughter Tina and grandchildren
Tobias, 3 1/2, and Amelia, 6 months.</TE>
<TE>   Raksin says he would like to be remembered "as a fellow who did
the best he could; who had an honorable attitude toward his work, and
who was respected for that. I think I had a gift for melody. I think
my music was unusual and a little original for its time. I'm very
pleased to believe that."</TE>

<HD>On 'Six Feet Under,' Love Has More Life Than Reality Shows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fresh carnage from the human mating game is splattered across the
broadcast network television schedule. The names of the shows, such
as "Blind Date," "Shipmates" and "Extreme Dating" may change, but the
premise of the staged, unscripted syndicated shows does not: Wannabe
actors and actresses try to vogue for the camera while finding a
telegenic soul mate.</LD>
<LD>   But over on pay cable, one of HBO's original dramas is exposing
contemporary sexual politics through actors who play characters
muddling through intimacy. It's a sober approach that may have less
instant gratification than, say, Fox's "Bachelorettes in Alaska," but
the strategy has earned "Six Feet Under" 23 Emmy nominations, six
million viewers (huge by subscription TV standards) and rave reviews.</LD>
<LD>   "We watch fairly normal neurotics deal with extraordinary
situations, made more extraordinary by the fact that there's also a
dead guy in the room," said funeral home director and author Thomas
Lynch, who watches the original drama each Sunday night without fail.
"We run around looking for meaning, but we should just be looking at
our human condition, as we live, as we breathe, as we die. I don't
see it as depressive."</LD>
<TE>   Executives at HBO said they were drawn to the show, created by
Alan Ball (a veteran sitcom writer who won an Oscar for his "American
Beauty" screenplay), because its underlying theme of death made all
of the relationships seem more urgent and vital. Characters could
never stray too far from honesty, even pessimism, with the prospect
of another funeral to arrange that week, said Carolyn Strauss, senior
vice president of original programming at the network.</TE>
<TE>   On "Six Feet Under" adult children reevaluate their newly widowed
mother's place in the dating world even as they do the same. Couples
are constantly fumbling with honesty, even as they try to be true to
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Take the dinner scene from last season when Brenda, played by
Australian actress Rachel Griffiths, arranges a dinner with a man she
hasn't seen in years--the man to whom she lost her virginity. He is
now married to a successful author, while Brenda is engaged to Nate,
the funeral director. The dinner goes surprisingly well, and both
couples seem to find each other down-to-earth and funny.</TE>
<TE>   Later that night, alone in Brenda's bungalow, Nate stares
glassy-eyed at the front door.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to find friends we don't hate," he says.</TE>
<TE>   With one phrase, he discards the annoying and unsatisfying
happy-ending mantra that permeates TV land.</TE>
<TE>   "In another story line, truth-telling and morality are foisted on
Nate's sister, Claire, who is played by Lauren Ambrose. Claire shows
incredible faith in her boyfriend Gabe, a surly neglected teenager,
played by Eric Balfour. One night he simply loses his temper and
shoots a man at a traffic light. It wasn't premeditated murder. In
fact, the teenager was so shocked by his own actions that he sped
away. But for Claire, it marks a turning point. She realizes that
although Gabe wants to be a better person, he is not capable of
making good decisions. She comes home, sits on a sofa in the funeral
parlor and tearfully tells the police what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "The depression and denial that a lot of persons find themselves
in is very subtle," said Peter Krause, who plays Nate. "You don't
realize it, until you start looking at yourself. There are a lot of
Nates out there, bumbling around trying to help other people. Brenda
and Nate are confronting themselves more than they're dealing with
one another."</TE>
<TE>   "Six Feet Under" continues to rotate the Rubik's Cube of
relationships, looking at the complications inherent in straight and
gay romances. Nate's younger brother and fellow funeral director,
David, played by Michael C. Hall, is involved with a police officer
named Keith, played by Mathew St. Patrick. The two men kiss often on
screen, but they also fight and get on each other's nerves. Either
Keith or David often wants to discuss the status of their
relationship while the other just wants to decompress from a hectic
day.</TE>
<TE>   "What I like about the portrayal of David and Keith is that it's
shown with just as much intensity and as much scrutiny as Nate and
Brenda's relationship," said Scott Seomin, entertainment/media
director for the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. "It's as
full of joy and full of angst as the heterosexual relationships.
Also, it gets equal air time. This is not a subplot in either air
time or depth."</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of the darkly funny "Six Feet Under" doesn't try to
satisfy the disaffected angst that is propelling other pieces of
culture to the forefront, works like Jonathan Franzen's well-received
novel "The Corrections." Instead, Ball is cynical and hopeful at the
same time, with characters desperate to connect but exhausted by the
process.</TE>
<TE>   "With the economy the way it is, and people thinking about things
more realistically, it's a great fit for where we are," said Rob
Bennett, a 33-year-old vice president of marketing for a software
company in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "The show is very realistic, and it isn't the typical family drama
where they work through their problems by the end of the episode. The
characters aren't role models. They're as screwed up as everyone is.
That has a lot of appeal."</TE>
<TE>   It's an approach that lies in stark contrast to the characters on
broadcast dating shows, giddy actors and actresses whose "real"
reactions are heavily edited. There are probably viewers who get
their fixes during the week on broadcast TV and then escape into the
dark humor of "Six Feet Under" each Sunday night. But they are surely
gleaning different things from the programs.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Markman, coauthor of "Fighting for Your Marriage" (2001)
and a professor of psychology at the University of Denver, thinks
viewers might be tuning in to "Six Feet Under" to learn. Adults in
their 20s and 30s have higher expectations about relationships than
ever before, he said, and the characters on "Six Feet Under" are very
upfront about that.</TE>
<TE>   "We want it all, but we lack basic relationship education," he
said. "People are very hungry for tools for information."</TE>

<HD>You're a Lone Voice, Lost in the Roar? Call for Backup</HD>
<DH>Female singers who want to test material with a band are
getting their chance at the monthly Chick Singer Night, at the
AlterKnit Lounge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a few hours before show time at the AlterKnit Lounge, and singer
Diana Williamson has just met her band. The husky-voiced Toronto
native is leading the attentive players in a rehearsal of one of her
earthy, mid-tempo songs, and after a hesitant start, the vocalist and
musicians are soon in sync, creating a confident, flavorful groove
redolent of Woodstock-era Band and Van Morrison.</LD>
<LD>   It's one of the 16 songs these four instrumentalists will learn
during the two-plus hours of afternoon rehearsal, an intensive
preparation that will afford four women a rare luxury: the chance to
put on a quality performance in an established room with a
professional band.</LD>
<LD>   That's the mission of the monthly concert series known as Chick
Singer Night, and Williamson, a first-time participant, is impressed.</LD>
<TE>   "Even though L.A. is a big city of musicians, it's hard to find
the right guys," says the singer, sitting in the nightclub's
restaurant area after her rehearsal. "I think I finally found
players. I've never had the right musicians to invite people down to
the show. I never felt confident enough before, so this is great."</TE>
<TE>   A lot of people--performers and spectators--seem to agree. After a
low-key first decade of existence in its Chicago birthplace, Chick
Singer Night has recently become a hot franchise. In addition to its
Los Angeles staging on the first Monday of each month at the
AlterKnit, the Hollywood Knitting Factory's 65-capacity secondary
showroom, the event has monthly branches in Chicago, Las Vegas,
Nashville and Miami, with a New York edition scheduled to launch Oct.
1.</TE>
<TE>   The unlikely overseer of this small empire is Lori Maier, a voice
teacher at Pepperdine University with no experience in the music
business. Though petite and unassuming, Maier is clearly running the
show at the rehearsal, whether sitting quietly and following a song
on a page of sheet music, joining the band to sing backup vocals or
holding a boombox up to a microphone so the musicians can hear the
next song they'll learn.</TE>
<TE>   Maier was writing songs and fronting a band in Chicago when she
started Chick Singer Night in November 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of friends who would sing backup for me were just kind of
curious about how I did it and how I was pulling all these events
together," says Maier, 40, during a break from the rehearsal. "I
basically did the first one for them. I used my band and wrote up
their charts for them and we pulled together this show, and it was
such a huge hit that I just kept doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Maier and her husband moved to Los Angeles in 1997, and she set up
Chick Singer Night last year at the mid-city music bar the Mint,
where it ran monthly before moving to the Knitting Factory in June.</TE>
<TE>   "It draws a great crowd," says Brian Smith, the Knitting Factory
booking assistant who helped bring Chick Singer Night to Hollywood.
"They're all just really nice people. There's no rock star
thing--it's almost like working-class women who are often overlooked
who can come in and show their craft off. It's really about the
songs. It brings a nice vibe into the club. It's more of a
neighborhood feel."</TE>
<TE>   Maier, a mother of two toddlers and a three-days-a-week instructor
at Pepperdine, says she listens to 30 to 40 tapes or CDs each week
submitted by singers. The candidates range from novices to moderately
well-established singers, and while the prospect of being discovered
is certainly a lure for many of the performers, Chick Singer Night
isn't primarily a talent-scout showcase. Publishing and record
company representatives do show up, but the biggest success stories
Maier can cite involve work as backup singers for the likes of Don
Henley and Stevie Nicks.</TE>
<TE>   "For women who may have taken a break from performing for a
variety of reasons, it's this easy opportunity to revive their
music," says Maier, who has also established a nonprofit foundation
to steer her network of songwriters into educational endeavors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a starting point for students who have never sung with a
live band before in front of an audience. It's a place for artists to
do material they may not be able to do with their regular band, for
whatever reason, or stretch out new material. It can be so many
things to so many different people."</TE>
<TE>   The arrangement with the clubs is the same in all its cities:
Chick Singer Night gets the door receipts, which typically cover
expenses, chiefly paying the band. The singers don't get paid, but
many get an irreplaceable moment.</TE>
<TE>   But why chick singers? Don't male musicians also have a hard time
catching a break in the music business?</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times the men are in positions of power in this
industry," notes Williamson, who co-wrote the recent Sasha Lazard
dance-chart hit "Awakening." "So you'll find people don't take you
seriously. You want to be taken seriously, so these types of
opportunities are very helpful."</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it was just closer to home to start a showcase for
women," says Maier. "But we have an 'Are you man enough?' slot for
the guys if they want to come sing with us."</TE>

<HD>Play-Along Learning Curve Is Heading Up</HD>
<DH>'Blue's Clues' starts fifth season with answers to its
success: Empower preschoolers with knowledge and make them laugh.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDITH S. GILLIES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you think "Blue's Clues" is just a cartoon for little kids, think
again. It's a carefully researched and designed television program
with a mission. It's also a billion-dollar business with a strong
brand that offers lessons for adults as well as preschoolers.</LD>
<LD>   The mission of the show, which launches its fifth season on
Nickelodeon with a special prime-time episode Monday at 8 p.m., is
"to empower, challenge and build the self-esteem of preschoolers
while making them laugh," said Angela C. Santomero, executive
producer and one of the creators.</LD>
<LD>   Her role is strategic, "to maximize what we are doing, turning
things on their head. For preschoolers, their work is their play.
They love to play, love to learn. We want to extend their learning in
play and are always asking how best to do that."</LD>
<TE>   Questions are an important part of "Blue's Clues" as young viewers
are invited into an animated world with a human host--originally
Steve, now Joe--who tries to figure out the day's puzzles with help
from a puppy named Blue. For example, the puzzle might be to figure
out Blue's favorite snack or story.</TE>
<TE>   The animated Blue puts her paw prints on three clues. The host
talks directly to the camera, asks questions to get help from the
audience and pauses for several seconds to allow preschool viewers to
respond aloud.</TE>
<TE>   The host draws the three clues in a "Handy-Dandy Notebook" and, at
the end of the show, sits in the "Thinking Chair" to review the clues
and solve the puzzle with the audience.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel we broke the mold for breakthrough interactive
television," Santomero said. "It's such a huge responsibility, the
way we tell stories and use educational learning theories."</TE>
<TE>   Each episode starts at an easy level and gets harder, she said.
The same show is aired all week because it allows young children to
master the concepts. "They are responding more verbally by the end of
the week, which helps them retain the information," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The show, which debuted in 1996, featured Steve Burns as host.
When Burns decided two years ago that it was time to leave, the
producers auditioned about 1,500 actors before choosing Donovan
Patton, 24, as host.</TE>
<TE>   In a three-part special that aired in April, Patton was introduced
as Steve's younger brother Joe, who came to visit and stayed on when
Steve headed to college.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's prime-time episode, "Joe's Surprise Party," is designed
to get children to think beyond themselves, Santomero said.
Preschoolers will be able to think about preparing for a party and
have a sense of cooperation with the show's characters as well as
doing something for someone else. The episode also will have animated
characters speaking directly to viewers, she said, a responsibility
usually borne by the host.</TE>
<TE>   "Blue's Clues" is one of the most-popular television shows for
preschoolers, Nick said. The show averages about 4 million viewers
each week on Nick and CBS, said Nielsen Media Research.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the best programs on the air for preschoolers," said
Ranny Levy, executive director of the Coalition for Quality
Children's Media, a nonprofit children's advocacy organization
headquartered in Santa Fe, N.M. "Kids respond well to it. It's well
thought out with colorful characters and music and is effective in
encouraging interaction."</TE>
<TE>   This year, "Blue's Clues" won a George Foster Peabody Award,
administered by the University of Georgia, which cited the show as "a
play-along, think-along animated series for preschoolers that
continues year in and year out to respect its very special audience."</TE>
<TE>   Alice Wilder, "Blue's Clues" research and development director and
producer, said, "Every episode is carefully designed with an approach
to learning--whether it be beginning reading skills or creativity or
life skills or math--that will enhance the life of a preschooler."</TE>
<TE>   Episodes of "Blue's Clues" are tested on three levels--for
scripts, animation and content--with children in public and private
schools in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, she said. Sometimes
the tests show that something isn't clear or that it might be too
easy, in which case changes are made in the program.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The season premiere of "Blue's Clues" airs Monday at 8 p.m. on
cable's Nickelodeon and will repeat Tuesday through Friday at 10 a.m.
in the Nick Jr. block. The series airs weekdays at 10 a.m. on
Nickelodeon.</TE>

<HD>West Africa's Rhythms Pulse in Traore Concert</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Skirball Cultural Center's sixth season of outdoor "Sunset
Concerts" opened with a burst of West African excitement Thursday.
Singer-songwriter Rokia Traore, an energetically charismatic
performer, galvanized an overflow crowd.</LD>
<LD>   Although Traore was born in Mali, she was raised with a global
perspective, living at various times in Algeria, Saudi Arabia, France
and Belgium. Her music, as a result, is tinged with global references
without losing its essential West African characteristics. Working
with two backup singers and a four-piece acoustic band, Traore
devoted most of her program to selections from her albums "Mouneissa"
and "Wanita."</LD>
<LD>   Initially, the selections varied between quiet numbers in which
she accompanied her expressive voice with her own guitar playing, and
more expansive pieces with the full ensemble. Traore is an important
member of a generation of African artists who emphasize contemporary
social issues in acoustic musical settings that differ in substance
and texture from the electronically underscored sounds of Afro-pop.
But the thoughtfulness that is at the heart of her style in no way
diminished the exhilarating qualities of her musical impact.</LD>
<TE>   In the closing segment, she emphasized those qualities by
revealing yet another aspect of her talent--remarkably lithe,
sensuously graceful dance movements, rooted in African style but
thoroughly invested with her own originality.</TE>
<TE>   Her audience, urged on by Traore's insistence that the open space
in front of the stage be filled, quickly joined in the rhythmic
display--a wonderfully amiable example of the power of good music to
reach beyond barriers of language and culture and simply bring people
together.</TE>

<LD>"A songwriter of no great depth or originality"? Excuse me, but how
long has Sheryl Crow continued to make award-worthy music ("Dancer,
Prancer, Vixen," by Richard Cromelin, July 29)? How many Grammys has
she won?</LD>
<LD>   Crow is an extraordinarily talented, versatile artist who has
performed with many other incredible artists in her career. The fact
that she has been able to create and produce work that in Cromelin's
mind is evocative of other artists' influence is--hello--no great
surprise.</LD>
<LD>   To put Crow down like that is tantamount to whining that Michael
Jackson is a so-so dancer because he emulated James Brown and Fred
Astaire, or that Albert Collins and Eric Clapton are insignificant
guitarists because they were influenced by the likes of Muddy Waters
and Robert Johnson, or that David Hockney is a shallow, unoriginal
painter because his development was steered by Picasso and Monet, as
no doubt they in turn were influenced by others before them.</LD>

<TE>   I did not see "All My Sons" at the Old Globe in San Diego, but I
read Tony Perry's grossly unflattering comments about the lead,
played by multiple Emmy Award-winning actor Daniel J. Travanti ("A
Grandfatherly Performance Undercuts 'All My Sons,' " July 29).</TE>
<TE>   I doubt there has ever been a more vicious butchering of an
actor's performance by any critic writing in the Los Angeles Times.</TE>
<TE>   It is my hope that before Perry wrote his criticism, he was
assured by the director that it was solely Travanti's "idea of
playing an old man ... continually pushing out his upper lip with his
tongue" and that Travanti insisted "playing him more like 81 [than
the text's 61]."</TE>
<TE>   If the director, Richard Seer, directed Travanti to play Keller as
described above, then it is Seer, not Travanti, who should be the
subject of Perry's disappointment.</TE>

Moonlight: Twice in the Same Week," July 25).</TE>
<TE>   There's no greater family entertainment anywhere that can match
the experience of a night at the Bowl. Moon, schmoon. It makes no
difference. If you've been, you know what I'm talking about. If you
haven't, give the family a treat--a night under the stars (or the
clouds). It's something they'll remember always.</TE>

<LD>It's sad, as an independent filmmaker, to think that the public will
believe the marketing campaign that Steven Soderbergh's "Full
Frontal" is a return to renegade filmmaking with a budget of "only $2
million" ("Are You Serious About No Catering Truck?" by Kevin
Maynard, July 30).</LD>
<LD>   Two million dollars with no makeup artist?</LD>
<LD>   Geez, on "Hot Wax Zombies on Wheels," I paid my makeup artist a
daily salary, shot 90 pages in 12 days with 39,000 feet of
35-millimeter film and finished with two Dolby answer prints and a
DigiBeta master--all for under $160,000. (Friends of mine have done
even better.) If I had had $2 million, it would have been an epic.</LD>

<LD>Good for our city attorney, Rocky Delgadillo ("Impersonating an
Officer Could Be Costly in Los Angeles," by Dava Calvo and Richard
Winton, July 31). Just about the time I figured Los Angeles had
realized that too many productions were carrying the "Made in Canada"
label, he finds another way of chasing production from our city.</LD>

department, but attacking the hand that feeds the city instead of
making adjustments within the department itself is crazy.</LD>

<LD>Regarding "Lazy, Hazy Music Days," by Sorina Diaconescu, July 27:</LD>
<LD>   Once again, we're ignored! Gary Mandell of Boulevard Music hosts a
wildly successful concert series in Culver City. Every Thursday
evening, hundreds of people pack the courtyard of Culver City Hall to
enjoy swing, western, blues, Cajun, Latin jazz and other wonderful
performances. The concerts and parking are free, and the 7 p.m. start
ensures great weather. It's a fabulous way to spend an evening.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, perhaps I'm not sorry your reporter ignored us. Culver
City is the best-kept secret of L.A.'s Westside ... we're a very
special town. We locals like it that way!</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Diaconescu neglected to mention what is different about the
"Summer Nights" event than the three others she attended: It's at an
art gallery! And the Geffen Contemporary is free that night, and in
fact stays open for an hour after the music, et al., stops.</TE>
<TE>   What a unique experience: jazz, boutique wines and microbrews, and
modern art all in an evening. Follow that with a quick stop to one of
the sushi or yakitori shops within a block, and you've got a night
that truly makes you want to sing "I Love L.A."!</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Arts Institutions Feel the Budget Squeeze</HD>
<DH>Culture* The Sept. 11 attacks and the economy are difficult
hurdles for many institutions, forced into budget cuts and reduced
services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIN LIPSON</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In the recent season opener of "Sex and the City," Carrie Bradshaw,
aiming for a perfect New York experience, headed on a Thursday to the
Guggenheim Museum--only to find that she'd come on the one day of the
week the museum is regularly closed.</LD>
<LD>   Bummer for Carrie. But hardly a full picture of what can await
visitors to New York's cultural institutions these days.</LD>
<LD>   Hit with cutbacks in city funding, a loss of tourism after the
Sept. 11 attacks and a decline in private and corporate donations
because of the faltering economy, arts and culture organizations have
reduced their programs and services as they try to ride out the
storm.</LD>
<TE>   Some places have cut their hours. Others have fired staff or
failed to fill vacancies. Exhibitions have been delayed by a year or
two, or completely cut from the schedule. Community outreach programs
have been trimmed. Marketing and advertising budgets have been
slashed.</TE>
<TE>   And those efforts might still not prove enough. Although a city
budget cut of 5% announced in June was met with a sigh of relative
relief by arts groups--especially in the wake of Mayor Michael
Bloomberg's initial proposal to slice 15% of their funding--more cuts
are expected by fall, and institutions that rely on city dollars are
continuing to tighten their belts.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is dealing with the problems in their own way, based on
the variables that affect their institution," said Karen Brooks
Hopkins, chairman of the Cultural Institutions Group, whose 34
members are in buildings or on land owned wholly or in part by the
city. Members of the CIG--which range from the Metropolitan Museum of
Art to the Bronx Zoo--got a total of about $100 million from the city
in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins also is president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which
recently laid off its vice president of finance as a cost-saving
measure. In addition, she said, the academy has reduced some free and
low-cost music offerings, cut back on advertising and otherwise
lessened the need for staffing.</TE>
<TE>   Like other cultural institutions, "we're just trying to hold on,"
Hopkins said. "But more than this 5% would be very detrimental."</TE>
<TE>   In all likelihood, more is coming. Budget modifications, a
standard part of the budget procedure that usually occurs around
November, may be moved up this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unclear when, but I assume it will be early fall," said New
York Cultural Affairs Commissioner Kate Levin, who painted a less
than rosy picture of what they might hold. "We're going to do what we
can to make the devastation as little as possible. But there's no way
around it--the groups that depend the most heavily on the city will
fare the worst."</TE>
<TE>   Even to date, some have been hit harder than others. Although its
city funding has dropped by about $1 million, down from $13.4 million
the previous year, the Met, with its vast resources, has managed to
make trims that are "hopefully, not really noticeable," spokesman
Harold Holzer said.</TE>
<TE>   "We cut $5 million from our budget. We cut advertising and
marketing. We cut a few ancillary programs. We stopped filling
vacancies." But, Holzer said, "There were no cancellations, no
truncated schedules, no dark days in the museum beyond the Mondays
that we're always closed."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Met was not exempt from post-Sept. 11 turmoil. Visitor
levels fell off sharply with the drop in tourism, and though they
have been creeping back up, the museum is still down 20% from 2001
levels. Despite its $5 million in trims, Holzer said, "with the loss
of income from admissions, the shops, the parking garage, we still
are finishing the year with a budget deficit of around $7 million."</TE>
<TE>   Some culture institutions are trying, despite a hardly conducive
economic climate, to enlarge their philanthropic base or rely more on
income they can earn themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying ... to explore the potential of philanthropy in the
black business world," said Lowery Sims, director of the Studio
Museum in Harlem. "We're just in the baby steps. We're trying to
expand our profile nationwide." With a board that includes trustees
from the Midwest and California and an exhibition program that
emphasizes African American artists from around the country, the
museum has the "potential" to attract more individual donations, Sims
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Here Arts Center in SoHo has long sought to base 65% of its
budget on income earned from its three experimental theater spaces,
two galleries and cafe. "We are already very independent. That was
just part of our business plan here," executive director Kristin
Marting said. Despite its independent stance, the loss of more than
$23,000 from various city sources has been another tough break.</TE>
<TE>   So Marting is working on a new, pared-back budget, and the Here
may have to postpone some of its projects. But while so many New
Yorkers have to do with less in so many areas, does a reduced program
at Here really matter?</TE>
<TE>   It does, according to a key argument of arts groups in their quest
to forestall further cuts. New York and culture are forever
intertwined, they point out; cripple the latter, and you reduce the
allure of the former, and thus its ability to raise the dollars it
needs for essential city services.</TE>
<TE>   No one really denies that the city's cultural organizations have
great symbolic value and economic leveraging power for the city.</TE>
<TE>   As the Met's Holzer put it: "It's nerve-racking. The imponderables
are nerve-racking."</TE>

<HD>A Sunny Attitude Helps Her Weather All Those J.Lo Jokes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE MARGULIES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sure, Jennifer Lopez is an actress, singer, fashion diva, gossip
magnet. But can J.Lo tell you tomorrow's high and low?</LD>
<LD>   It depends which one you ask.</LD>
<LD>   Meet another Jennifer Lopez. She's a meteorologist on the Weather
Channel, co-host of the nightly "Evening Edition."</LD>
<TE>   And yes, she gets jokes about the name. "Everybody calls me J.Lo;
I'm used to that," she says from the cable channel's studios in
Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Her favorite story is from a cable convention in Chicago last
year, where a young man came to the Weather Channel booth, walked up
to her and asked excitedly, "Is it true that the real Jennifer Lopez
is going to be here?"</TE>
<TE>   She told him it was true. He grew increasingly flustered and
sought further assurance. She directed him to a bulletin board where
the weathercasters' photos were posted. He went over, looked and was
crestfallen to discover the Jennifer Lopez they were billing wasn't
the Jennifer Lopez he was panting to see. Then he realized that was
the woman he'd just been talking to.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked at me, turned beet red and fled," Lopez recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Her name didn't always elicit such reactions. "It was never a
problem--until the green dress," she says, referring to the skintight
Versace number with the plunging cut that the other Lopez wore to the
Grammy Awards in 2000. "That really put my name on the map."</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't mind. She likes Lopez's films and music. But the two
women are nothing alike, she hastens to point out, noting that unlike
actress-singer Lopez, who just filed for divorce from her husband of
10 months, she's been married for four years and is expecting her
first child this month.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Lopez considered switching to her married name when she
started at the Weather Channel in May 2000 after weathercasting
stints at two TV stations in her native Florida. But management
discouraged her because her husband's Armenian name was more
difficult to pronounce.</TE>
<TE>   So Jennifer Lopez she remains.</TE>
<TE>   There are some advantages.</TE>
<TE>   "When I call hair salons," she says, "they get quite excited. They
say, 'Oh, we'll fit you right in.' "</TE>

<LD>   A Strained Bond Between Voight, Jolie</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks after Oscar-winning actress Angelina Jolie filed for
divorce from husband Billy Bob Thornton, her father revealed that she
has split with him too.</LD>
<TE>   In a tearful interview on the TV show "Access Hollywood" Thursday
night, actor Jon Voight--who separated from Jolie's mother when their
daughter was an infant--said the actress has "carried a lot of pain"
for years--experiencing "very serious symptoms of ... real illness."</TE>
<TE>   He says he tried to intervene when Jolie was shooting "Girl,
Interrupted" in 1999, but she was unresponsive. Though they had a
brief rapprochement shooting "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" in 2001, the
two haven't had a meaningful conversation in more than a year, and he
has yet to meet the son she adopted, Voight said.</TE>
<TE>   Jolie has spoken candidly about her mental ordeals, including a
bout of self-mutilation in her teens. But she's remaining mum about
her dad. "I don't want to make public the reasons for my bad
relationship with my father," she said. "After all these years, I
have determined that it is not healthy for me to be around my father,
especially now that I am responsible for my own child."</TE>

<TE>   A Musical in the Future for Two 'Idol' Finalists?</TE>
<TE>   The two top finishers in Fox's talent search series "American
Idol" will get more than a recording contract. They may also become
movie stars.</TE>
<TE>   Simon Fuller, the creator of the hit summer series, said he is in
talks with several film studios to produce a musical starring the two
"American Idol" finalists. The film would be released around May or
June of next year, in conjunction with the conclusion of the second
edition of "American Idol."</TE>
<TE>   Fuller said the movie would be "a very modern story" revolving
around the concept of Gap Year in Britain, the stretch between
college graduation and the start of work.</TE>
<TE>   The finals of "American Idol" will take place Sept. 3 and 4 in
live broadcasts on Fox.</TE>

<TE>   British Museum's Woes Now Include a Theft</TE>
<TE>   London's world-famous British Museum, which is suffering funding
and staff shortages, reported that a robber had stolen a
2,500-year-old Greek statue from a room without a permanent security
guard this week.</TE>
<TE>   Curators and dealers worldwide have been alerted to be on the
lookout for the piece, a 5-inch-high marble head with a distinctive
damaged nose and face that the venue acquired in 1922. Experts
believe it could be worth as much as $38,750.</TE>
<TE>   "Sadly, all museums are vulnerable to theft, and small-scale
sculptures are always particularly at risk," said Neil MacGregor, who
took over as director of the museum this week.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's crime highlighted concerns over security and funding at
the museum, which will celebrate its 250th anniversary next year. As
many as 28 of its nearly 100 galleries are regularly closed for
several hours because of staff shortages. And in June, employees
staged a one-day strike after management announced it would cut jobs
during the next two years to handle an expected budget deficit of
$7.3 million in 2004-05.</TE>
<TE>   Outgoing director Robert Anderson told lawmakers last month that
the flagship museum was impoverished. What's to blame? Declining
tourism post-Sept. 11, expenses that exceed government funding--and a
free admissions policy.</TE>

<LD>Veteran freak-rockers the Butthole Surfers usually perform with
strobe lights and vividly disturbing film clips of surgeries, insects
and other creepy things washing over the players, enhancing the
mind-blowing effect of their psychedelic punk-metal. But on Thursday
at the Viper Room, the Texas noise heroes got back to basics by
leaving out those elements of their multimedia shtick.</LD>
<LD>   It made sense, in a way, as the 20-year-old quintet offered 90
minutes of older material from the days when its light show was
relatively primitive. But without the visual distraction,
nerve-grating aspects of the band's presentation eventually
overwhelmed its bizarre delights.</LD>
<LD>   The players scarcely needed the movies to create their surreal
sense of damaged fun, what with all the silly string flying, smoke
machines belching, colored lights pulsing and squirt guns soaking the
capacity crowd. Leader Gibby Haynes grinned with maniacal glee, his
distorted vocals making it nearly impossible, as usual, to discern
much of the lyrics beyond snippets of subversive political themes,
scatological absurdity, classic-rock mocking, calls to self-immolate
and the blues tune "Going Down."</LD>
<TE>   Much of the set roiled with sludgy intensity, accelerating in
spots to a mosh-pit-inducing frenzy of warped guitar, thundering bass
and furious double drum kit tattoos. For the mostly die-hard fans,
about the only thing that might have made the experience more fun (or
not) would have been a cameo by Viper Room co-owner Johnny Depp,
Haynes' erstwhile bandmate in his side project P.</TE>

<HD>Another in a Cresting Wave of Exhibitions</HD>
<DH>'Surf Culture,' in Laguna, is yet another sociocultural
show in a fine-art museum. It's also a mishmash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the 1960s, the arts in America flourished like never before.
Boundaries between media disintegrated as the orderliness of the
Eisenhower era gave way to freewheeling experimentation. Fun suddenly
appeared to be a goal worth pursuing. Pop art, rock music and the
pill (not to mention loads of other chemicals) made life exciting. A
counterculture was born.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty years later, university departments got in on the action.
Art history and studio arts programs ballooned with courses in visual
and cultural studies. Restless professors began to treat comic books,
B-movies and salt-and-pepper shakers with the seriousness that was
once reserved for paintings and sculptures. The results were mixed:
Some delivered terrific insights into everyday objects; most presumed
that merely focusing on common things (rather than high art) was
enough to identify its author as a bona fide anti-elitist.</LD>
<LD>   Another 20 years passed before museum curators jumped on the
bandwagon. Paying lip service to art's pleasures and to the knowledge
scholars build around it, they act as if they are most interested in
beefing up attendance. Exhibitions of motorcycles, high-end clothing,
orange-crate labels and all sorts of cultural ephemera are as likely
to be found in museums as are straightforward displays of art. The
counterculture may not have died, but its effects are being laid to
rest in institutions.</LD>
<TE>   At the Laguna Art Museum, the latest installment of this
let's-look-at-anything approach to exhibition organization is "Surf
Culture: The Art History of Surfing," an awkwardly titled, profoundly
confused and poorly presented mishmash of surfboards, paintings,
posters, photographs, prints, installations, shrines, videos,
mementos, children's book drawings and a couple of custom cars.</TE>
<TE>   To make room for the sprawling show, the museum has cleared all of
its halls, stairwells and galleries. It has extended its hours (10
a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, seven days a week) and increased the price of
admission by 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Guest curators Tyler Stallings and Craig Stecyk have taken the
shotgun approach to their job. Rather than tracing the historical
development of a style, material or design, they have packed every
square foot of the building with a little of this and a little of
that. Rather than presenting insightful juxtapositions to make a
coherent argument, they have simply tossed a laundry list of things
together.</TE>
<TE>   Juicy bits abound. Thoughtful overviews are nowhere to be found.
Background information is treated no differently from featured
artifacts. The only questions the curators appear to have asked are,
"Does it have anything to do with surfing?" and "Can we get our hands
on it?"</TE>
<TE>   As a whole, "Surf Culture" is the visual equivalent of a run-on
sentence: Lacking a goal but animated by hyperactive energy, it takes
you past a good number of compelling clauses and far too many
pointless phrases.</TE>
<TE>   More than a sport and nothing less than a way of life, surfing
provides Stallings and Stecyk with a topic that's stylish and sexy.
They deserve credit for starting to look into it. There's something
to catch your eye in most rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Just inside the entryway is "The Surfite," a bright yellow dune
buggy that Ed "Big Daddy" Roth designed and built in 1964. With a
bubble-shaped cab flanked by a cushioned compartment where a matching
surfboard rides in first-class comfort, the single-passenger vehicle
allows a surfer to travel alongside his trusty board, even when he's
nowhere near the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Upstairs, a handful of 18th and 19th century etchings of
wave-riding Hawaiians are displayed at the beginning of a hallway
hung with kitschy illustrations, folksy oils on canvas,
Sunday-painter watercolors and black-and-white snapshots. All depict
some aspect of beach life. Most are banal.</TE>
<TE>   Mounted below them, at about knee-height, are a dozen or so
surfboards from the 1920s, '30s and '40s. Far more aesthetically
satisfying than the pictures, they include a plywood paddleboard from
1948, a beautifully striped model from 1935 and a streamlined board
made by Pacific Systems. In the stairwell stands a surfboard owned by
onetime Times publisher Otis Chandler, with a swoop of blue paint
decorating its redwood, balsa and pine body like an abstract family
crest.</TE>
<TE>   Downstairs, other highlights include John Van Hammersveld's poster
for Bruce Brown's 1964 movie "Endless Summer"; Rick Griffin's
pen-and-ink drawings for "Tales From the Tube," a 1974 comic book;
and Jeffrey Vallance's photo-documentation of his 1988 audience with
the King of Tonga, to whom he presented a royal surfboard and
king-size swim fins.</TE>
<TE>   Also captivating is George Greenough's "The Innermost Limits of
Pure Fun," a 16-millimeter film he made in 1970 by strapping a
floodlight-equipped camera to his back and riding the waves on a
super-maneuverable short board known as a V-bottom. Five examples of
these hang nearby, providing a nice comparison with DeWain
Valentine's "Yellow Roller," a symmetrical, rainbow-tinted sculpture
from 1974 that's fabricated in much the same way as the boards.</TE>
<TE>   The two best galleries are the smallest. The first juxtaposes
fantastic abstract sculptures by Craig Kauffman, Peter Alexander,
John McCracken and Laddie John Dill with an airbrush-decorated
surfboard from the early '70s and a monitor on which plays "Endless
Summer." Using resin, sand and light, the sculptures, which date from
1968-74, transform materials familiar to surfers (and ordinary
beach-goers) into mesmerizing objects that go far beyond such mundane
references. It's a rare instance of curatorial clear-sightedness in a
show overcrowded with third-rate works, pieces included only because
of their subject--or the fact that a surfer made them.</TE>
<TE>   The second gallery features one of Robert Irwin's discs from 1969.
Floating in front of the wall like a futuristic apparition--or some
glitch in your perceptual system--it's accompanied by a magazine
clipping that shows the Light-and-Space artist on the beach, holding
his hand-painted surfboard.</TE>
<TE>   The least successful spaces are the three largest. In one, 31
surfboards lean against a railing or lie on the floor around it.
Dating from 1924 to at least 1963 (two-thirds of their labels had not
yet been installed the day the show opened), they could tell a
fascinating tale of how materials and designs evolved over half a
century. Instead, the sloppy installation encourages viewers to pick
out a few favorites and forget about history.</TE>
<TE>   Standouts include Duke Kahanamoku's weighty plank of redwood in
which the letter V has been chiseled; the oldest known production
polyurethane board, from 1956; and Pat Curren's elegant pinstriped
model from 1963. Across the gallery, a balsa and redwood board inlaid
with abalone suggests comparisons to jewelry and low-riders.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining galleries demonstrate that the wave of surf-inspired
art crashed in the early '70s. Heavy-handed installations (by Kevin
Ancell and Simon Leung) and half-baked paintings (by Sandow Birk and
Michael Knowlton) are the visual equivalent of a day when no waves
are breaking.</TE>
<TE>   Put bluntly, there is no such thing as "the art history of
surfing." An exhibition about the history of surfing would make more
sense, as would one about the art of surfing, or even the
relationship between art and surfing. But that would require the
curators to make discriminating decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Such value judgments are unpopular in contemporary museums, where
the radically democratic spirit of the 1960s lives on as a hollow
excuse for all-inclusiveness. That's what happens when administrators
treat museums as if they're the educational arm of the entertainment
industry--and the quantity of paying customers is more important than
the quality of what's on display.</TE>

<HD>The Sound of Sinatra's Hollywood Years</HD>
<DH>An extraordinary new six-CD set brings together much of the
music that he recorded for the movies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD REICH</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like a newly discovered painting by Picasso or an unpublished
manuscript by Hemingway, a previously overlooked recording by Frank
Sinatra instantly piques the curiosity of fans around the world.</LD>
<LD>   For even though Sinatra's art has been copiously documented in
several excellent boxed sets and in pristine CD reissues of his
classic albums on Capitol and Reprise, the Sinatra devotee's appetite
for still more fresh material only increases with the passage of
time.</LD>
<LD>   This insatiable desire for more music by Sinatra--who died in
1998, at age 82--has inspired archivists to dig deep into
recording-studio vaults and collectors' personal collections, where
they recently have found enough to fill a plushly packaged,
beautifully annotated new six-CD boxed set aptly titled "Frank
Sinatra in Hollywood" (on Reprise/Turner Classic Movies Music,
$119.98 suggested retail price).</LD>
<TE>   Granted, most of the 160 tracks are not exactly unknown, since
Sinatra cut them for films that were released between 1940 and 1964
and have been seen by millions on TV, video and DVD. Everyone of a
certain age knows how Sinatra sounded singing "The Lady Is a Tramp"
and "I Could Write a Book" in "Pal Joey" (1957), which in retrospect
might be considered the first great music video.</TE>
<TE>   Yet this trove of music, spanning the quaintly crooned "Dolores"
from the film "Las Vegas Nights" (on which Sinatra appeared
uncredited in 1941) to the rip-roaring "My Kind of Town" from "Robin
and the 7 Hoods" (1964), adds significantly to Sinatra's already
bulging discography, if only because most never have been available
as stand-alone recordings.</TE>
<TE>   Brought together, these performances--some classic, some lightly
entertaining, some disposable--trace the arc of a vastly influential
film-music career, in the process documenting Sinatra's
transformation from early '40s crooner to late '40s swinger to
profound '50s balladeer. And though many facets of Sinatra's music
never surfaced on film or on this boxed set--particularly his most
expressionistic ballads of the late '50s and his bossa nova
explorations of the '60s--"Frank Sinatra in Hollywood" gives the
uninitiated enough indelible music to stir an interest to learn more.</TE>
<TE>   One hastens to note, however, that the cuts on "Frank Sinatra in
Hollywood" do not match the superior sound quality of the music on
his Capitol and Reprise boxed sets, nor were they intended to. Above
all, this was music designed for film and was, therefore, sonically
somewhat diminished by the technical limitations of the moviemaking
process in an earlier era.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, everything known about Sinatra's life and career
suggests that he poured most of his artistic energies into his studio
recordings, demanding nothing but the best in orchestrations,
instrumentalists, microphones and, most important, himself. When it
came to recording tunes for film, on the other hand, Sinatra rarely
lingered over his work, preferring to make it sound quick, easy and
spontaneous.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite Sinatra's sometimes cavalier attitude toward
filmmaking and the often clumsy nature of the film-recording process,
the man managed to create some definitive musical performances for
celluloid, as the new boxed set shows.</TE>
<TE>   Though he recorded Cole Porter's "Night and Day" several times
during his career, his version for the forgettable film "Reveille
With Beverly" (1943) proves strikingly slow and rapturous. The degree
of control, subtlety and tonal shading he brings to "That Old Black
Magic," from "Meet Danny Wilson" (1952), documents Sinatra's
interpretive achievements near their pinnacle.</TE>
<TE>   And then there are the lost gems. On "The Man With the Golden
Arm," which Sinatra never sang in the 1956 film of the same name and
inexplicably never was released to coincide with the film, his
steeped-in-blue vocals are answered by crying jazz horns. And though
Sinatra did not sing "To Love and Be Loved" in "Some Came Running"
(1958), the song adds crisp meaning to an otherwise moody, murky film
about postwar alienation and disillusionment.</TE>
<TE>   But "Frank Sinatra in Hollywood" has lighter moments, too,
especially in the singer's effervescent duets with Gene Kelly and
Jimmy Durante, two of the few Hollywood legends who could hold their
own against Ol' Blue Eyes.</TE>
<TE>   If there's one exasperating omission here, it's the numbers
Sinatra recorded for "Carousel," in which he was to star as Billy
Bigelow--until he abruptly quit the set and the production (experts
disagree on the reasons).</TE>
<TE>   Some unspecified contractual restrictions prevented the inclusion
of those tracks in this set, and it's a good bet that the producers
of "Frank Sinatra in Hollywood" were as frustrated by that gap as
Sinatra aficionados surely will be.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, this rich boxed set sheds light on a subject that
never ceases to fascinate listeners.</TE>

<HD>A Case of Whydunit</HD>
<DH>The theft of two Maxfield Parrish paintings from a gallery
in West Hollywood disturbs--and baffles--the experts</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like critics trying out adjectives to describe a perplexing canvas,
investigators and art experts are looking at the theft this week of
two Maxfield Parrish paintings from a West Hollywood gallery and
straining to understand. Most find the thief's work "sophisticated."
But they also label the $4-million disappearance "disturbing,"
"puzzling" and "weird."</LD>
<LD>   Parrish, whose works of vibrant color and billowing clouds have
fetched auction prices as high as $4.25 million, completed the two
canvases in 1914 as part of a six-canvas indoor mural for the New
York mansion of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney.</LD>
<LD>   All six were on display at the Edenhurst Gallery on Melrose
Avenue, offered at $2 million each, and one was visible in the front
window. But only two were taken--cut from their custom frames
sometime between Sunday morning and Monday morning.</LD>
<TE>   The break-in is mystifying, authorities say, not only because the
odds of successfully reselling such widely recognized works are slim,
but also because the two canvases are part of a larger series that
many collectors would want together or not at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I would term it as disturbing," said Sheriff's Det. Scott Petz,
who is investigating.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty sophisticated. They had pretty clear intent on why
they entered and what they were going for."</TE>
<TE>   The stolen canvases measured roughly 64 inches by 74 inches each,
he said. Apart from the four Parrish canvases left behind, Petz said,
the gallery space held dozens of other works, some valued at tens of
thousands of dollars. No other artworks were taken or cut.</TE>
<TE>   Though Parrish worked on the mural series during 1912-16, both
missing works were painted in 1914. The canvases, which mimicked
window views of human figures and massive urns in the foreground and
Colorado mountains in the background, were intended for specific
positions in a specific room. The missing canvases, known as 3A and
3B, were both for the west wall of the reception room.</TE>
<TE>   The thief or thieves "forced entry through the ceiling," Petz
said, and probably left the same way. Petz said "there has been
physical evidence collected from the scene" but declined to offer
details.</TE>
<TE>   The next step, said Petz, is "to hit the databases real hard,"
including Interpol, the FBI and private agencies that track art. He
noted the odds of solving cases like this are usually relatively
good, but the solutions come gradually, not immediately.</TE>
<TE>   In imagining the thief's next step, "there's so many different
scenarios that you can consider," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes people within the art community get fixated," Petz
said. "Sometimes people steal out of their sheer passion, their
desire to possess."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the gallery owners aren't talking but, "I feel
violated," said J.P. Bryan, the Texas oilman who owns the works with
a Colorado-based partner and sent them to the Edenhurst Gallery on
consignment a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Houston-based Bryan, who has amassed one of the largest
privately held collections of Western art and artifacts in the U.S.,
said he and the partner bought the six-canvas Parrish mural 2 1/2
years ago in a private transaction with the Whitney family. Bryan
said he required the West Hollywood gallery to take out $12 million
in insurance and send along copies of the paperwork, which he said
the gallery did.</TE>
<TE>   "We moved [the canvases] to California in June [2001], and a lot
of people were extremely enamored of the paintings." After Sept. 11,
the market cooled, Bryan said, and he had begun to consider breaking
up the set to hasten sales. He heard about the theft when a message
from detectives reached him in Houston, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone didn't do this without studying those panels very
carefully. The two go together. They're almost a pair," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But why take only two?</TE>
<TE>   "I really find that puzzling," said Bryan. "I guess we all have a
little detective in us. I've got to believe that somebody saw these
two and was enamored of them, and put word out that they'd be willing
to pay a price" to have them stolen.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, said Don Hrycyk, a Los Angeles Police Department
detective who has specialized in investigating art thefts for the
past nine years, "a lot of these thieves, they think fine art is the
thing to steal. And yet when you get into the millions, it becomes
very difficult to sell stolen art. Because the art world is very
small, and they communicate with each other, and the key word in the
art world is 'provenance': They want to know who authenticated the
piece, who was the prior owner and where it has been exhibited
before. That's to protect themselves and to judge the value of the
piece. If you can't answer those questions because you have cut it
out of someone's frame, then you can't sell it. It's not something
that I would do if I was a thief. It's a real whodunit at this
point."</TE>
<TE>   Hrycyk said the last time he saw a local case involving the theft
of such valuable art was in 1992, when oils by Monet and Picasso
valued at $17.5 million were reported missing from an
ophthalmologist's home in Brentwood. That case turned out to be an
attempt at insurance fraud by the paintings' owner, Steven G.
Cooperman, who was convicted of conspiracy and other charges in 1999
and last July was sentenced to 37 months in federal prison. The
artworks were recovered from a storage locker in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   But an equally intriguing precedent for investigators in the
current case may be the 1996 theft of a Jean Dubuffet
gouache-on-paper work valued at $100,000 from a Hollywood gallery.
Like the current case, Hrycyk said, that theft involved a forced
entry through the ceiling of a gallery, with lines cut to disable
alarms; it remains unsolved, the art still missing.</TE>
<TE>   Alma Gilbert, curator of the Cornish Colony Museum in New
Hampshire, and a longtime Parrish dealer, called the whole scenario
"very weird." Of the works' $2-million-per-canvas estimated value,
"that's Los Angeles prices. That's all I can say," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But she also vouches for the significance of the works involved.
These mural canvases, she said, "were the turning point, not only for
Maxfield Parrish's life, but for the way that reproductions were made
from then on."</TE>
<TE>   Parrish lived from 1870 to 1966. Until he landed the commission
from Whitney, Gilbert said, Parrish made much of his living by
painting works for reproduction, limiting his palette to accommodate
the four-color separation process. Because Whitney was interested
only in the original canvases, the artist was free to "go nuts with
all the colors he wanted to use," said Gilbert. "Parrish was able to
indulge in all the wonderful tonalities that he became so famous
for." And that in turn pushed the artist's publishers to adopt more
sophisticated printing practices.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert can also vouch for the criminal attachment that some
people have for Parrish. In her 22 years of running galleries in the
San Francisco Bay Area, Gilbert said, she had two Parrish paintings
stolen--including one in 1984 that was stolen, recovered, then stolen
again a week later by somebody else. The two paintings, Gilbert said,
have never been recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, investigators are digging deeper into the physical
evidence and the art market. The case "is certainly wide open at this
point," said Petz.</TE>
<TE>   "Sooner or later," said Hrycyk, the stolen works will reappear on
the market. "At some point, it's going to get into legitimate hands,
and at that point, somebody will recognize it as stolen."</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert isn't so sure.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they've been recovering paintings," she said. "But they're
not recovering Parrishes. In the 30 years I have handled Parrish, I
have seen him engender a great deal of passion."</TE>

<HD>Corrected Start of Friday's Marceau Review</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Due to a production error in Friday's Calendar, parts of the third
and fourth paragraphs in Lewis Segal's review of Marcel Marceau's
performance at the Geffen Playhouse were jumbled. The beginning of
the story should have read like this:</LD>
<LD>   At 79, French pantomime paragon Marcel Marceau still has the power
to redefine theater in his own image. In an age of relentless
amplification, he gives us the wonder of silence. In an age of
numbing literalism, he conjures up the magic of metaphor. In an age
when every facet of meaning is desperately heightened and oversold,
he dares to make demands on an audience.</LD>
<LD>   Watch him closely at the Geffen Playhouse--where he opened a
19-day engagement on Wednesday--or you might miss something sublime.
You might enjoy only the easy, funny stuff--the endearing lion-tamer
routine, for instance, in which he can't get his big cat to jump
through a hoop.</LD>
<TE>   Slip into the way you normally gaze at movies or TV, and you'll be
lost when Marceau takes on those subjects and feelings that so much
entertainment is designed to keep at bay--the way, for example, that
he physicalizes the duality of human nature by making his left hand
humane and even spiritual, but the right hand carnal and violent. Who
else can make a simple walk convey the sense of life lived too
quickly and death ticking inside us with every step? Who else can
make us laugh at the desperation of a street musician, yet turn his
fate into a chilling parable about the corruption of art?</TE>
<TE>   Forget the bland sentimentality of white-faced street mimes in our
malls and parks. Except when he's portraying children, love of life
is usually hard-won or short-lived in the theater of Marcel Marceau.
It might surface only after he fails to successfully shoot, stab,
poison, hang and gas himself in "Bip Commits Suicide," or in Adam's
enchantment with Eden just before he eats that apple in "The Creation
of the World."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been said that there's nothing more ridiculous than someone
else's love affair, and Sunday at 10 p.m., you'll actually get two
perfect examples in the Showtime original movie "Women vs. Men."</LD>
<LD>   Oh, it's original all right. From the improbable premise through
virtually every oddball plot point along the way, this film feels
like a 90-minute sitcom sketch as conceived by David Lynch. Yet
what's perhaps strangest of all is that the savvy cast makes it all
weirdly compelling. Or at least watchable.</LD>
<LD>   Christine Lahti stars as Dana, who opens the movie by threatening
divorce when longtime hubby Michael (Joe Mantegna) has the temerity
to surprise her with a gift-wrapped Cadillac. Her stunned,
uncomprehending spouse is comforted by his pal Bruce (Paul Reiser),
who after analyzing the situation concludes that the only solution is
a trip to a strip club.</LD>
<TE>   A great plan, except that Dana follows them to the club and peeks
inside just as these middle-aged boys are getting lap dances from
some topless nymphets. Furious, Dana storms out, picks up her cell
and gives Bruce's wife, Brita (Glenne Headly), the lowdown.</TE>
<TE>   Confronted later by their wives, the lads simply lie, resulting in
both being given the heave-ho.</TE>
<TE>   The midlife-crisis scenario includes a friend (Robert Pastorelli)
who cavorts in a loincloth, a get-even striptease enjoyed by the
wives and a bathroom sexual encounter involving hydrau- lics. This
40-ish bunch knows how to party.</TE>
<TE>   Written by David J. Burke and directed by Chazz Palminteri, "Women
vs. Men" is a battle that may leave you a bit shell-shocked.</TE>

<HD>Probes Weighing on AOL Shares</HD>
<DH>Media: The focus apparently is $27 million in ad revenue
from transactions between the America Online unit and software firm
PurchasePro.com.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of AOL Time Warner Inc. sank for a third straight day Friday,
as concerns about twin federal investigations into the media giant's
accounting continued to weigh on the stock.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether
the company's America Online unit wrongly booked $27 million in
advertising revenue in late 2000 and early 2001 from transactions
with software company PurchasePro.com Inc., the Washington Post and
Wall Street Journal reported Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Las Vegas-based PurchasePro confirmed that it had been contacted
by the SEC, the newspapers said. The SEC declined to comment on the
case.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of AOL Time Warner fell 71 cents, or 6.5%, to close at
$10.30 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Chief Executive Richard D. Parsons disclosed the
SEC's "fact-finding inquiry" on July 24. This week, the company
confirmed an apparently related criminal investigation by the Justice
Department.</TE>
<TE>   The probes reportedly were sparked by reports that America Online
used unorthodox accounting methods to boost reported ad revenue while
its huge merger with Time Warner was pending and it needed to
persuade Wall Street that it was still growing strongly.</TE>
<TE>   Parsons denied any accounting irregularities, saying the
transactions have twice been approved by auditors Ernst &amp; Young.</TE>
<TE>   PurchasePro is a former dot- com highflier in the
business-to-business sector whose shares closed at 32 cents Friday,
down 1 cent in Nasdaq trading. The company used to buy advertising on
America Online and used the Internet giant to sell its software.</TE>
<TE>   In one transaction, AOL reportedly paid $9.5 million for $30
million in PurchasePro stock warrants, then booked the $20.5-million
difference as advertising and commerce revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "AOL Time Warner has announced previously that the SEC is looking
into a number of transactions. It should be no surprise that one of
the transactions is PurchasePro," AOL spokesman John Buckley told
Reuters.</TE>

<HD>Coors Family Member Swindled, SEC Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joseph Coors Jr., a member of the family that founded Adolph Coors
Co., the third-largest U.S. brewery, was swindled in a scheme in
which he and others invested $40 million, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Golden Heritage, a family investment body controlled by Joseph
Coors, joined a program that promised a 100% return per week, the SEC
alleged in a complaint filed in a San Francisco federal court.</LD>
<LD>   Coors was told his money would be invested in bank or other
financial institution instruments rated AA or better, the SEC said.
In reality, there were no such investments, the SEC said. The
investors were taken in a "prime bank" scheme, a common type of fraud
in which investors are tricked into thinking their money will be
placed in safe, well-regarded institutions, the SEC said.</LD>
<TE>   Golden Heritage and the other investors haven't received their
principal or any return on the investment, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants, meanwhile, spent at least $4 million at Saks Fifth
Avenue, luxury hotels in Coral Gables, Fla., and Beverly Hills, a
Louis Vuitton store and elsewhere, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants are Dennis Herula, a former Raymond James Financial
Services Inc. broker, and Claude Lefebvre, and two entities
associated with them, the SEC said. Herula's wife, lawyer Mary Lee
Capalbo, received at least $3 million of the money, the SEC said. She
wasn't charged with participating in the swindle.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Geragos, a lawyer for Herula and Capalbo, couldn't be reached
for comment. Lefebvre doesn't have a lawyer, the SEC said, and no
listing existed for him in Tiburon, where the SEC said he lives.</TE>
<TE>   The court issued temporary restraining orders and froze $36
million of the defendants' assets, said the SEC, which is seeking
allegedly ill-gotten gains plus civil fines.</TE>
<TE>   Coors, who retired in 2000 as chairman and chief executive of
CoorsTek Inc., a provider of ceramic, metal and plastic parts used in
computer-chip manufacturing, couldn't be reached for comment. He is a
great-grandson of Adolph Coors, the founder of the brewery company,
said Terry Terens, a spokeswoman for the company.</TE>
<TE>   Herula, a Raymond James broker until he was fired in 2001, and
Capalbo also have been accused by the SEC of participating in a
$52-million fraud in which investors were promised high returns on
Treasury bills.</TE>

<HD>Brokerages' Failure to Keep E-Mails Could Hinder Probes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State investigations of conflicts of interest among Wall Street
securities analysts are being hampered because many brokerages have
failed to saved all employee e-mails, a person familiar with the
matter said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   E-mail was one tool New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer used when he
pursued allegations of conflicts at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. earlier this
year.</LD>
<LD>   His evidence, which helped persuade the firm to pay a $100-million
fine, included electronic messages by analysts making disparaging
comments about companies they publicly recommended.</LD>
<TE>   "Spitzer showed e-mails that were pretty explosive evidence," said
Alan Bromberg, a law professor at Southern Methodist University in
Dallas. "The e-mails contradicted what the analysts were saying.
Anytime you can turn up bits like that, they can make good
prosecution material."</TE>
<TE>   Six of the largest securities firms, including Morgan Stanley and
Merrill Lynch, may be fined as much as $10 million total because they
didn't save all e-mail messages, people familiar with the situation
said. The Wall Street Journal and New York Times previously reported
the potential fines.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear how much missing e-mails will undermine the efforts
of the states that are investigating analysts at about a dozen of the
largest firms.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, they're probing whether firms committed fraud by
tailoring analyst recommendations to win investment-banking business.</TE>
<TE>   Rules mandate firms hold on to communications regarding their
business for three years. During the first two years they must be
readily "accessible," and for the third year the messages may be kept
in a less accessible form.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, who's investigating Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc.'s
Salomon Smith Barney, is focusing on Salomon analyst Jack Grubman.
Spitzer's office is considering criminal charges against the
telecommunications analyst, spokesman Darren Dopp said this week.</TE>

<HD>FERC Seeks Tougher Accounting Rules</HD>
<DH>Energy: The proposal follows an audit that found
questionable fund transfers by Enron units.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal regulators have proposed new accounting rules after an audit
found that two Enron Corp. pipelines may have improperly funneled $1
billion to the energy trader in the weeks before it filed for
bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   The rules, which would apply to at least 400 utilities and energy
pipelines, would help insulate customers from the costs of a
bankruptcy by non-regulated companies that own the businesses,
according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proposal.</LD>
<LD>   A commission audit found that parent companies owe their regulated
subsidiaries $16 billion, an amount that has been "increasing
significantly" since 1997, it said. Such arrangements "create severe
financial risk to FERC-regulated entities and cause harm to
ratepayers should the subsidiaries attempt to pass through costs that
result from defaults by unregulated parent companies."</LD>
<TE>   The commission wants businesses it regulates to have debt of less
than 70% of total capital, while their non-regulated owners would
have to maintain investment-grade credit ratings, according to the
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal came as the commission disclosed partial findings of
an audit begun in November amid allegations of accounting
irregularities at Enron. The probe found that two Enron-owned
pipelines obtained credit lines from Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan
Chase &amp; Co., then loaned the funds to Enron in a failed bid to keep
it solvent.</TE>
<TE>   The pipelines, Transwestern and Northern Natural, don't expect
Enron to repay the loans and will have to justify any costs
associated with the default before they can be passed along to
customers, the commission said in a separate order. The pipelines
also failed to adequately document the "imprudent" transfers, the
order said.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy Inc. bought Northern from Enron for $2.45 billion in
January. On Monday, it announced plans to sell the pipeline to
MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. for $1.88 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in November, the commission's chief accountant, John
Delaware, reviewed transactions between unregulated parent companies
and their regulated subsidiaries from 1997 through 2001. The audit
found that balances in the regulated units' receivables from the
parent increased "significantly" during the period, the commission
said, without giving a comparison.</TE>

<HD>New Testing Policy Proposed for Altered Crops</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Biotech industry applauds the White House
plan, but food safety advocates and environmentalists say it may not
go far enough.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The White House on Friday proposed new tests of genetically altered
plants while the crops are still being field tested, so that the
government will know whether the plants present a risk if they end up
in the food supply by mistake.</LD>
<LD>   The new policy would permit small amounts of genetically modified
crops to mingle with the food supply--even before they pass the
elaborate food safety regulatory hurdles.</LD>
<LD>   The biotechnology industry applauded the White House announcement,
but environmentalists and food safety advocates expressed concerns
that the new policy failed to go far enough to protect the public
because the early tests would be voluntary and not exhaustive.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal represents an effort by the Bush administration to
address possible health risks posed by genetically engineered plant
varieties without hampering the industry's progress. Genetic
engineering has dramatically changed the way new plant varieties are
developed.</TE>
<TE>   Five years after the first biotechnology-derived crops were
commercialized in 1996, about 88 million acres were planted with such
crops in the United States. Corn, soybeans and cotton represent the
majority of the genetically altered plants now on the market.</TE>
<TE>   But biotech companies are experimenting with many other foods,
including a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. The primary goal
of the developers is to create crops that either repel insects or can
withstand herbicides, so the crops are not damaged when the
herbicides are applied to kill weeds.</TE>
<TE>   The tests, which would be done only at the request of developers,
would assess any potential for allergic or toxic reactions from any
new proteins in bioengineered crops.</TE>
<TE>   "We're proposing a set of science-based regulatory oversight tools
which will provide the public with assurance that public health and
environmental concerns are being addressed," said Cliff Gabriel,
deputy associate director for science at the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists and food-safety advocates have been concerned
for years that genetically altered crops would contaminate the food
supply. The food industry, meanwhile, has been worried that detection
of unapproved, biotechnology-derived crops in foods could trigger
huge recalls and heavy costs, whether or not the public faced any
risks.</TE>
<TE>   These fears are more than theoretical. In 2000, StarLink, a type
of genetically modified corn approved only for livestock consumption,
was detected in hundreds of popular human food products, including
taco shells. Massive recalls were ordered.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, genetically modified plants showed up in Canadian
canola seed. Monsanto Co., fearing a negative effect on exports to
Japan, where the trait had not yet been approved, launched a large
recall.</TE>
<TE>   These examples show that inadvertent blending of biotech crops
with the food supply can happen, government officials said. The
blending can happen when pollen blows from the test plant to other
crops and when the same machinery is used with both crops.</TE>
<TE>   "If there are plants growing in the field, there is always the
possibility of pollen flows and seeds being mixed, and products that
have not gotten through all the regulatory steps could inadvertently
become components of food," said James Maryanski, the FDA's
biotechnology coordinator. "Our goal at FDA is to make sure the food
supply is safe."</TE>
<TE>   Maryanski said the FDA believes that the preliminary test for
allergens or toxicity would catch any possible public health risks,
even if the biotech plants have not passed the full regulatory
regime.</TE>
<TE>   "These materials will be present at very low levels of food," he
said. "We believe they will not rise to the level that they will
present a public health problem."</TE>
<TE>   But environmental and food safety advocates were not convinced. "I
fear that if the FDA approach remains voluntary it will end up
protecting industry more than people and the environment," said Jane
Rissler, a plant pathologist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
"Industry will be able to go to FDA to get an OK if it fears it has
not contained a new protein, so it won't be liable for introducing a
protein into the food supply."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Mendelson, legal advisor for the Center for Food Safety,
said the proposal would help the biotech industry with its difficult
battle to improve the public's view of its products--without ensuring
the public a thorough review.</TE>
<TE>   But representatives of the biotech industry said they believed the
rules would help assure the public, making it easier for companies to
promote their products.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the policy is a positive step toward ensuring there is a
framework for allowing the continued development and testing of
biotech traits in the field," added Bryan Hurley, spokesman for St.
Louis-based Monsanto, a leading company in the field.</TE>

<HD>Golden State Awarded $381 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A judge Friday ordered the U.S. to pay Golden State Bancorp Inc. $381
million for breaking a promise of special regulatory treatment made
during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Claims Court Judge Loren A. Smith, saying he wished he had
power to order a larger award, gave the San Francisco-based thrift
less than half the $909 million he had awarded in a 1999 ruling. A
federal appeals court said that amount was too large and told Smith
to recalculate it.</LD>
<LD>   Golden State "will get significantly less than half of the amount
that this court feels is the fair amount by which it has been
damaged," Smith wrote. "This is not justice. However, it is not the
job of a court to legislate on what the law should say."</LD>
<TE>   Golden State's case is one of 100 suits centered on promises made
by regulators to encourage takeovers of failing thrifts. The suits
say thrift acquirers spared regulators from having to seize the
struggling institutions and pay off depositors, then lost money when
the government reneged on the promises.</TE>
<TE>   The case before Smith involved the 1981 acquisition of Florida's
First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of Broward County by Golden
State's corporate predecessor, Glendale Federal Bank. It's one of two
such cases being pressed by Golden State, parent company of
California Federal Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State says regulators let Glendale create "supervisory
goodwill," a paper asset that would count as cash for regulatory
capital requirement purposes. Congress later banned supervisory
goodwill, sending many institutions into instant insolvency and
forcing others, including Glendale, to sell assets.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State, which agreed in May to a takeover by Citigroup Inc.,
has moved to insulate itself from the unpredictable outcomes of its
two suits. Holders of special securities tied to the Glendale case
will get 85% of the after-tax proceeds, with the company getting the
rest.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of those securities, which trade under the ticker GSBNZ,
have fallen from a high of $7.25 when they were issued May 8, 1998,
to $1.02 on Nasdaq Friday. Investors in goodwill-related securities
have grown frustrated with the limited size of the awards and the
delay in resolving the cases.</TE>
<TE>   GSBNZ shares rose almost 11 cents, as some investors anticipated
Smith's ruling, which was released after the markets closed. Golden
State shares fell 73 cents to $32.07 in New York Stock Exchange
trading.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State spokeswoman Janis Tarter said the company expects to
have a statement before the markets open Monday. A Justice Department
spokeswoman wasn't available.</TE>

<HD>A Slower Pace for Rising Prices</HD>
<DH>Analysts see signs of changes ahead for Southland housing
market</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Housing prices in Southern California are expected to rise much more
slowly in coming months, reducing the exceptional gains that sellers
have been enjoying this year.</LD>
<LD>   Although no one is forecasting a drop in housing prices, market
observers say median prices, which in Southern California have been
rising by about 20% this year, probably will rise by about 10%.</LD>
<LD>   "Prices will still increase, but not at 15% or 20% a year," said
Boyd Martin, chief executive of Market Profiles Inc., a real estate
consulting firm in Santa Ana.</LD>
<TE>   To be sure, the housing market remains muscular by almost any
measure. Median prices in Southern California jumped in June by their
fastest rate to an all-time high of $273,000. Mortgage rates remain
near historical lows. Buyers are abundant amid a small pool of homes
on the market.</TE>
<TE>   But several factors are converging now, leading some analysts to
believe the market is cooling, though not to the point of the rapidly
declining prices of a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Today in some communities, agents are advising clients to set
prices toward the middle or lower end of the market.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we'll see a market that tanks as it did in the
early 1990s," said Nima Nattagh, research director at FNC Inc., a
consulting firm to the mortgage industry. "But there are grounds to
believe that the appreciation we've seen for the last three or four
years will not continue through the end of this year."</TE>
<TE>   An unusual burst of sales earlier this year cut into this summer's
pace. In June, for instance, analysts said sales growth in Southern
California was flat for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the housing market usually cools during the fall and
winter months, the slowing in the coming months is expected to be
more pronounced because last year prices and sales were unseasonably
strong.</TE>
<TE>   The California Assn. of Realtors has revised its latest statewide
forecast, predicting prices and sales to rise in the 8% range in
2002, well below results through the first six months of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "We are projecting that the increases in home prices will not be
anywhere close to the monthly 20% increases we've seen," said Robert
Kleinhenz, a CAR economist.</TE>
<TE>   The market also is likely to cool because home prices have been
rising at a faster rate than household incomes, said Mark Robbins
Boud, the principal at Real Estate Economics, a consulting firm in
Laguna Niguel. Moreover, he said, a weaker job market, particularly
in Los Angeles County, will temper appreciation.</TE>
<TE>   The recent drumbeat of negative news also could affect confidence
of home buyers. Some analysts say corporate scandals, a tepid
economic recovery and a volatile stock market could shake the faith
of potential buyers and cause them to reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that creates uncertainty works adversely against
consumer confidence and has the potential to slow things down even
more than we were expecting," Kleinhenz said.</TE>
<TE>   Another drawback could be mortgage rates that are expected to
drift higher. Long-term fixed rates, after tumbling to a 35-year low,
moved up this week to 6.43%, according to a national survey by
Freddie Mac, the secondary mortgage investor.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac's chief economist, has revised down his
year-end projection for mortgage rates to 6.7%. Such a rate, well
under the 30-year average of nearly 10%, is not expected to have a
significant effect on sales though every uptick in rates removes
potential buyers from the market.</TE>
<TE>   If mortgage rates moved up to 7.5% or higher, which is believed to
be unlikely this year given the economy's slow rate of recovery,
affordability would plummet and demand would sharply fall.</TE>
<TE>   The torrid rate of appreciation of housing prices in Southern
California and elsewhere helped buoy Americans' confidence about the
economy and kept consumers spending through the stock market
correction and the recession. But a possible slowing could mean
housing would be less of a safety net during an economic slide and
undermine consumers' confidence.</TE>
<TE>   The risk of a major drop in prices is much smaller now than in the
late 1980s, Boud said, because key factors are less pronounced, given
the lower rate of overpriced new homes, fewer job losses, lower
mortgage costs and smaller housing supply.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, for instance, new home prices are
overpriced by 5% compared with the peak of 55% a decade ago, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time around, we were suffering huge job losses and
building homes at record levels," said Boud. "It was a perfect menu
for disaster. Those same elements are not around this time."</TE>
<TE>   Still, not every analyst is convinced the market will slow down.
John Karevoll, an analyst at DataQuick Information Systems Inc., said
prices will stay on their current course a bit longer.</TE>
<TE>   "Until there's a better balance between supply and demand," he
said, "I think rates of appreciation will stay about where they are
right now."</TE>
<TE>   But he expects rising prices will prompt more owners to put their
homes on the market. Sellers would have less room to raise prices as
for-sale signs pop up on more lawns, which could slow the rate of
growth, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even though current housing data show no evidence of a cooling
market, some brokers said they are seeing signs, particularly in
move-up and luxury-home categories.</TE>
<TE>   A few months ago, buyers were paying top dollar for homes costing
$1 million or more. But now they are balking at steep markups and
taking longer to make purchases.</TE>
<TE>   And some agents are advising clients to set prices toward the
middle or lower end of the market, said Tom Dunlap, branch manager of
Prudential California Realty in Beverly Hills. "I don't think we're
going to see prices spiraling like we did in the first half of the
year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the San Gabriel Valley, homes priced at a premium above
$400,000 are staying longer on the market, said Marty Rodriguez, who
owns a Century 21 franchise in Glendora. "People are a little unsure
about the stock market and their jobs," she said, "making some buyers
hesitate a little bit more."</TE>

<HD>There's Still Growl in the Bear Market</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Are investors once again being stalked by the bear market?</LD>
<LD>   After falling late last month to lows not seen since 1998, the Dow
Jones industrial average was staging a dramatic rebound until a spate
of disappointing economic news put the brakes on the rally this week.</LD>
<LD>   Triple-digit losses in the Dow on Thursday and Friday erased a
chunk of the gains notched during the previous week of trading--and
quickly raised concerns among some investors that the 2 1/2-year bear
market may still have some life in it.</LD>
<TE>   "We get a temporary thrill, and then we're back to where we were,"
said Youlonda Copeland-Morgan, an investor and educator from Chino
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Les Greenberg, chairman of the Los Angeles-based Committee of
Concerned Shareholders, said he thought the market's recent bounce
was nothing but a "head fake." He saw Friday's 2.3% drop in the Dow
as proof that the market malaise continues.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not really positive on the market right now," he said. "I
think we are going into a long-term situation like they did in Japan.
After something like this happens, people don't just jump back in."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a widely watched measure of the stock market's fear
level--known as the VIX index--has spiked in recent days, although it
remains below the levels it reached in late July, when the index
approached heights not seen since the 1987 market crash.</TE>
<TE>   On the bright side, trading volume during the late-week sell-off
was well below the record levels reached during the late-July
meltdown and subsequent rebound--an indication that investors aren't
stampeding out of the market.</TE>
<TE>   Copeland-Morgan, for one, has not abandoned stocks, believing the
market will rise again.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us have lost so much in our investments that losing a
little more doesn't feel as tragic," she said. "We are willing to
take the risk in the hope that we'll gain."</TE>
<TE>   Donald Straszheim, president of Straszheim Global Advisors in
Santa Monica, believes the market hit its nadir last week and now is
in the process of bumping around the bottom--as recovering markets do
before they take off.</TE>
<TE>   "Bottoming is a process, not a date," he said. "Everybody is
demoralized, but that's what happens at bottoms. But it is these
periods of despair that provide the best buying opportunities. Good
companies get sold just like the bad ones."</TE>
<TE>   Others said there was considerably less despair Friday than there
would have been had the week not started on such a positive note--a
447-point leap by the Dow on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "That one up movement gave people enough encouragement to tolerate
the market's fluctuations," said Judy Martindale, a fee-only
financial planner in San Luis Obispo. "It came at a really good time,
because more and more of my clients who do not usually respond to
panic were starting to panic. They can stand the downs as long as
there is an up in there every once in a while."</TE>
<TE>   Many investors and advisors--whether they were positive or
negative over the long haul--said they still expected some tough
sledding in the months to come.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the market will ultimately move up, but it went up too
fast too soon," said Barbara Steinmetz of Steinmetz Financial
Planning in Burlingame, Calif. "We are going to see a lot of ups and
a lot of downs until we finally even out somewhere along the line."</TE>
<TE>   Said Straszheim: "Investor behavior gets very emotional at these
extreme points. People will rush out and say they never want to own a
stock again. Then they'll turn around. That's why you see so much
volatility around a market bottom."</TE>
<TE>   The sharp ups and downs can make market timing a nightmare as
investors fret that sitting on the sidelines can cause them to miss
out on a fast-developing rally.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Glaser, an investor from Rancho Palos Verdes, pulled all but
a token amount of money out of stocks and believes the market could
fall 20% more before it rises again.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I sure I should be out of the market?" he asked. "No. I sit
here nervously."</TE>

<HD>Economic Worries Spur Stock Sell-Off</HD>
<DH>Markets: Investors increasingly fear that the recovery is
stalling. The Dow falls 193 points but manages to eke out a second
winning week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks fell sharply again Friday as investors grew increasingly
worried that economic growth is slipping away, preventing the market
from staging a solid rebound. Weak forecasts from Walt Disney and
others also weighed on Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average, suffering its second straight
triple-digit decline, tumbled 193.49 points, or 2.3%, to 8,313.13
after being down as much as 302 points during the session. The
blue-chip gauge, which includes Disney, dropped 229.97 points
Thursday. Still, it managed to eke out a 48.74-point gain for the
week, achieving its first back-to-back weekly gains since March.</LD>
<LD>   Broader measures also fell 2% or more. The Nasdaq composite index
skidded 32.08 points to 1,247.92, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost
20.42 points to 864.24. For the week, Nasdaq slipped 1.1% and the S&amp;P
500 rose 1.3%.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly three stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York
Stock Exchange on Friday, and losers outpaced gainers more than 2 to
1 on Nasdaq. Trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Investors barely had time to revel in the optimism of last week's
rebound--and an apparent easing of concerns about corporate
scandals--when they were assaulted this week with several reports
portraying a dramatically slowing economy.</TE>
<TE>   Another dismal report arrived Friday, with the Commerce Department
saying orders to U.S. factories fell 2.4% in June, the first decline
since February. Economists had forecast a 0.5% gain.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's unemployment rate, meanwhile, remained stuck at 5.9%
in July, the Labor Department said, with only 6,000 net new jobs
added last month. That was well below the 60,000 economists were
expecting, and it gave investors little reason to believe that the
economy is poised for a rebound.</TE>
<TE>   The economic data serve as "a perfectly reasonable catalyst to
give back some of these gains," said Tobias Levkovich, senior
institutional equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. The Dow
industrials had bounced 13% off their recent lows before this latest
round of selling.</TE>
<TE>   Other reports this week said that home construction levels fell in
June to their lowest level in nearly two years and that the gross
domestic product grew at a 1.1% annualized rate in the second
quarter, down sharply from a 5% rate in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to see rather sluggish economic growth and therefore
muted growth in stock prices," said A. Gary Shilling, who heads a
market research firm bearing his name in Springfield, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Fears that the economy will slip back into recession have raised
speculation that the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates yet
again, even though they already are at 40-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   Yields on Treasury notes and bonds tumbled Friday, as some traders
stepped up bets that the central bank might cut rates. The yield on
the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note slid to 4.29% from 4.39% on
Thursday. The yield on the two-year T-note fell to a generational low
of 2% from 2.12%.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. on Friday became the first major Wall Street
bond dealer to predict another rate cut. The Fed is likely to lower
its benchmark overnight-funds rate from the current 1.75% to 1% by
year's end, said William Dudley, the firm's chief economist.</TE>
<TE>   Another negative factor for stocks is the approaching Aug. 14
deadline for executives to certify their companies' financial
results. With managers forced to sign off on their figures in the
next two weeks, investors are worried that more firms will disclose
unexpected accounting problems.</TE>
<TE>   Shilling also said that despite the market's drubbing in the last
several months, he believes that stocks have not bottomed out.</TE>
<TE>   "We still haven't seen a capitulation--a wholesale dumping of
stocks and mutual funds--that are typical of bottoms after major bear
markets," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the lackluster earnings results from Disney,
ExxonMobil and other major companies in the last two days added to
equity investors' skittishness. Disney warned of a weak showing in
the current quarter, and the company's stock dropped $1.52 a share,
or 9%, to $15.31--its lowest since January 1995.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights Friday:</TE>
<TE>   * Entertainment and hotel stocks retreated on Disney's warning.
Six Flags plunged $2.26, or 15%, to $12.60, and Marriott
International fell $1.65, or 5%, to $31.45.</TE>
<TE>   * Retailers also slumped as investors speculated that sales would
slow. Wal-Mart Stores lost $1.30 to $46.10, and Home Depot slid $1.20
to $28.43. Both are Dow stocks.</TE>
<TE>   * Makers of chips used in communications and networking gear fell
on National Semiconductor's warning after Thursday's closing bell
that sales in the current quarter would be flat. Texas Instruments
declined $1.14 to $19.97, Xilinx slid 84 cents to $17.41, and
National Semi fell 25 cents to $16.88. The SOX index of chip stocks
fell 3.4% and has lost about half its value since mid-March.</TE>
<TE>   * Mining stocks were a rare bright spot as gold prices rose $3 to
$307 an ounce. Newmont Mining gained 50 cents to $25.49, and Goldcorp
added 37 cents to $9.10.</TE>
<TE>   * Telecommunications firm Tekelec of Calabasas soared $1.92, or
29%, to $8.48 on a surprising jump in second-quarter earnings.</TE>

<HD>Media Firms Hurt by Disney Results</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Stocks in the sector plummet after the
entertainment giant warns of weak theme park attendance. It and
Viacom are hardest hit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors hammered media and entertainment stocks on Friday, one day
after Walt Disney Co. gave Wall Street the pessimistic news that
results will continue suffering from soft theme park attendance.</LD>
<LD>   Although the market overall was down after a weaker-than- expected
U.S. jobs report was released--the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index slid 2.3%--media and entertainment companies in particular took
a beating.</LD>
<LD>   The decline reflects investors' continued disappointment in the
media industry's poor results, its big debt loads, the inability to
produce synergies from mergers and accounting questions raised about
AOL Time Warner Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Disney and Viacom Inc. suffered the worst. Viacom's class B stock
dropped $3.21, more than 8%, to $34.84 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Shares in Disney tumbled 9%, or $1.52, to $15.31 on the NYSE,
sinking to their lowest level since January 1995. That followed the
company's announcement of lower fiscal third-quarter results Thursday
after the market closed, and the additional news that Disney is
seeing continued softness in its crucial theme park business.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts reacted by slashing their earnings estimates and target
stock prices for Disney even though its third-quarter results were
close to Wall Street's expectations. UBS Warburg cut its target price
for the stock to $18 from $27.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen in a report said, "The
company's outlook was decidedly more negative than our expectations,"
calling theme parks "the primary culprit" because of weaker
international tourism.</TE>
<TE>   She cut her fiscal fourth-quarter earnings estimate by 6 cents a
share, to 11 cents, although she made a point of noting that Merrill
is not downgrading Disney's stock.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of Disney's lingering problems, Standard &amp; Poor's said
it placed the company's investment-grade, A-minus credit rating on
review for a possible downgrade in the next three months.</TE>
<TE>   Disney declined to comment on the S&amp;P action and its stock price
drop.</TE>
<TE>   But in an interview Thursday after the release of the company's
third-quarter earnings, Disney Chairman Michael Eisner and Chief
Financial Officer Thomas Staggs said they expected the theme parks to
rebound when the economy picks up, adding that the company's balance
sheet remains strong despite Disney's current troubles.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Friday's results, neither Disney nor Viacom is the worst
stock performer among media giants this year. U.S.-traded shares of
Paris-based Vivendi Universal are down 73% since the beginning of the
year, and AOL Time Warner's stock is off 68%. That compares with
declines of 26% for Disney and 21% for Viacom.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner and Vivendi also fell Friday on the NYSE. AOL Time
Warner lost 71 cents, or 6.5%, to $10.30 ; Vivendi fell 70 cents, or
4.6%, to $14.45 .</TE>
<TE>   Among other media giants, Australia-based News Corp.'s U.S.-traded
shares fell 82 cents, or 4.2%, to $18.88 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel and cruise-ship stocks also were hit hard because Disney's
attendance bodes poorly for tourism overall. Hilton Hotels dropped 70
cents to $11.40 and Carnival Corp. slumped $1.76 to $23.94.</TE>
<TE>   Among casino operators, Mandalay Resort Group slid $1.59 to $26.50
and Harrah's Entertainment dropped $2.31 to $44.12.</TE>

<HD>Disney Buys the Rights to Miners' Story</HD>
<DH>Media: Deal includes a movie for the ABC television network
and a book to be published by Hyperion Publishing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nine Pennsylvania coal miners rescued Saturday after three days
underground have sold the TV-movie and book rights to their story to
divisions of Walt Disney Co. for $150,000 apiece, according to the
Pittsburgh attorney representing the men.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Crawford, who specializes in criminal tax and labor law,
said the deal includes a movie for Disney's ABC network and a book
that will be published by the Burbank company's book arm, Hyperion
Publishing.</LD>
<LD>   An ABC spokesman declined to comment Friday.</LD>
<TE>   The story of the miners' ordeal and their rescuers' successful
efforts became a sign of hope for many Americans after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, high-profile corporate scandals and recent
abductions of young girls that ended tragically.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford said he received more than 120 offers for the miners'
stories in the days after they were pulled from the earth in narrow
metal canisters. Some offers consisted merely of an author offering a
few thousand dollars to option the story, while others were made
through news producers representing competing broadcast networks.</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Marx, a representative for NBC, said the network did not
bid on the story.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Carr, the vice president of publicity for movies and
miniseries for CBS, said the network is cutting down on "long-form"
material, but said it is the network's policy not to comment on deals
in development.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the miners contacted Friday by The Times said they had
been instructed to refer all media calls to Crawford.</TE>
<TE>   The television networks have long had a hunger for real-life
stories of heroism and survival.</TE>
<TE>   Films have included CBS' "Snowbound: The Jim and Jennifer Stolpa
Story" in 1994 and two films about Jessica McClure: "Everybody's
Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure" in 1989 and "Whose Child Is
This?: The War for Baby Jessica" in 1993.</TE>

<HD>PG&amp;E Details Questionable Energy Trades</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An unregulated division of PG&amp;E Corp. engaged in potentially
deceptive energy-trading practices during the California power crisis
that drove the company's utility into filing for bankruptcy,
according to documents filed Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In its quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
San Francisco-based PG&amp;E said its National Energy Group participated
in at least 44 transactions that created the appearance of energy
trades from January 2000 through May of this year.</LD>
<LD>   The illusory practice, commonly known as "washing" or
"round-tripping," involves two traders swapping the same amount of
power for the same price.</LD>
<TE>   PG&amp;E said it banned the practice after uncovering the transactions
during an internal inquiry prompted by federal regulators.</TE>
<TE>   The "washing" technique can be used to artificially inflate
revenue to improve a company's income statement or to generate a
sales commission for a trader. If enough traders launder megawatts at
the same time, it can drive up market prices, said Frank Wolak, a
Stanford University economist who chairs California's power market
surveillance committee.</TE>
<TE>   Bethesda, Md.-based National Energy believes "there could have
been legitimate reasons" for round-tripping, said David Mold, a
spokesman for the energy trader. National Energy isn't certain of the
motive behind the transaction because all but four were initiated by
other traders, Mold said.</TE>

<HD>June Semiconductor Sales Slide 1.6%</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Semiconductor sales were down 1.6% worldwide in June from a year
earlier because of sluggish sales of personal computers, the
Semiconductor Industry Assn. said.</LD>
<LD>   For the second quarter overall, chip sales totaled $11.35 billion,
down from $11.54 billion in the year-earlier quarter but up from
$10.73 billion in the first quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The rise in sales from the first quarter was driven mostly by
recovering demand in Asia.</LD>
<TE>   The association said it expects full-year 2002 sales to rise 3%
from 2001. It forecast 23% growth in 2003.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Warnaco Group Inc. said the Securities and Exchange Commission may
file charges against the bankrupt maker of Calvin Klein jeans and
Speedo swim suits for violating accounting regulations.</LD>
<LD>   An internal probe found accounting errors in Warnaco's Designer
Holdings unit, leading to an earnings restatement, Warnaco said in a
regulatory filing.</LD>
<LD>   Warnaco, which ousted Chief Executive Linda Wachner in November,
has replaced "certain financial staff" and changed the way it
accounts for some purchases.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC informed the company on July 18 that its staff will
recommend bringing civil charges against the clothing maker and some
employees, said Warnaco, which will rebut the charges.</TE>
<TE>   The company disclosed in April 2001 that the SEC was looking into
the company's "preparation and publication" of various financial
statements and reports.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Gets Extension for Los Angeles Cable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Los Angeles extended for 45 days the five local cable
franchises held by Adelphia Communications Corp. after the its
current contract expired.</LD>
<LD>   City officials said the extension would give both parties more
time to hammer out a new agreement, which would include a schedule
for upgrades of Adelphia's cable networks for the delivery of digital
services such as high-speed Internet access.</LD>
<LD>   After Adelphia filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June,
the city threatened to revoke the franchises if service deteriorated
or the company failed to pay franchise fees. The city said Adelphia,
the city's second-largest cable provider, with 250,000 customers,
paid its latest quarterly fees of $1.7 million by the July 31
deadline.</LD>
<TE>   As part of the franchise renewal process, a city audit determined
that Adelphia owes $3 million in back fees for a three-year period
from 1996 to 1999. Adelphia says it only owes $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   As a condition of the franchise extension Friday, Adelphia agreed
to put $2 million in escrow as a good-faith gesture.</TE>
<TE>   "Our tough stance has paid off," said City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo,
who had threatened to revoke the franchises. "I've been assured
service will not be interrupted during the 45 days."</TE>

<LD>A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in New York upheld an exclusive
online-ticketing contract between Fandango Inc. of Los Angeles and
the Loews-Cineplex Entertainment chain of movie theaters.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling is an important victory for Fandango in its battle
against archrival AOL Moviefone, a subsidiary of AOL Time Warner Inc.
In Loews-Cineplex's bankruptcy proceedings and in a separate lawsuit,
Fandango has accused Moviefone of trying to lure away the theater
chain, which was one of the founding partners of Fandango and remains
a minority owner.</LD>
<LD>   Fandango also announced that Edgar Bronfman Jr., vice chairman of
Paris-based Vivendi Universal, is joining its board of directors and
becoming a minority investor.</LD>

<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. and its creditors again delayed a decision on
whether to sell the company's worldwide fiber-optic network and other
assets--and which bid to approve.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which is negotiating for better offers from three
bidders seeking to buy the entire company, said it would make a
recommendation Tuesday. A judge at a hearing scheduled for Wednesday
could consider approving a winning bid, which would bring the company
out of the nation's fifth-largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy case.</LD>
<LD>   The company's chief executive, John Legere, canceled other
appointments Friday to focus on talks with two bidders that initiated
talks in the last month.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>SBC Communications Inc., the second-biggest local-telephone company,
said it wants advance payments before connecting phone calls for
WorldCom Inc. and other long-distance carriers that it considers
credit risks.</LD>
<LD>   SBC said it will ask the Federal Communications Commission for
permission to require one-month deposits and quick payment from
companies that owe SBC at least $1 million for using its network to
complete calls.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, the company said it is revising its balance sheets for
the last two quarters after misstating the maturity of $750 million
of debt. The news, announced after the markets closed, sent SBC
shares down as much as $1.05 to $26.50 in extended trading, after
closing up 10 cents to $27.55 on the NYSE.</LD>
<TE>   SBC classified the short-term borrowings, which mature in February
2003, as long-term debt. The mistake has no effect on the company's
total debt or earnings, a spokesman said.</TE>

<HD>Wendy's Finds Value by Sticking to Its Flagship Fare</HD>
<DH>Restaurants: The fast-food chain has kept its profit up and
quality image intact by rejecting price-cutting, which is rampant
among rivals.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While McDonald's Corp. and other burger chains have slugged it out
with 99-cent Big Macs and 49-cent hamburgers, Wendy's International
Inc., the company best known for its square hamburgers, has stayed
out of the fray, keeping its profit and the reputation it claims for
quality intact.</LD>
<LD>   The Dublin, Ohio-based company, which has generated strong sales
by offering generally pricier fare than competitors, has rejected the
margin-killing strategy of heavy discounting rampant in the fast-food
industry. Slashing prices can cheapen the value of products over time
in consumers' minds and even tarnish a company's image, Wendy's Chief
Executive Jack T. Schuessler said.</LD>
<LD>   Price-cutting also can trigger never-ending price wars, said John
Glass, an analyst at CIBC World Markets in Boston. "Once you start
discounting, you can't get out of that vicious cycle," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Wendy's has not ignored the value-conscious consumer. Rather than
slash the price of its flagship burgers as McDonald's does, it offers
a 99-cent menu featuring chili, shakes and other items that can be
sold profitably discounted, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Because Wendy's value menu has changed little in 13 years,
customers are not confused by constantly falling or rising prices as
they are at other restaurants, Morningstar analyst Harry Milling
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Wendy's appears most interested in reaching a slightly more
affluent and older customer who is willing to pay for perceived
quality.</TE>
<TE>   Such a strategy has boosted Wendy's market share for five
consecutive years. The company's five-year annual earnings growth
rate of nearly 10% dwarfs McDonald's 3.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its gains, Wendy's market share, which is at 13.2%, up
from 12.7% in 2000, continues to trail Burger King's and lags far
behind McDonald's 43.1%, said Dennis Lombardi of Technomic Inc., a
restaurant research and consulting firm in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   And, like its big burger rivals, the chain faces several
challenges, including so-called "burger burnout" and the increased
competition from new fast-casual chains, which combine the speed of
fast food with the quality of a casual dining chain.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike its rivals, Wendy's uses fresh ground beef. That commitment
to quality has helped it to consistently rate higher than McDonald's
and Burger King in a national taste survey, said Bob Sandelman of
Sandelman &amp; Associates, the Villa Park restaurant consulting firm
that conducted the study.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about the food," Wendy's CEO Schuessler said.</TE>
<TE>   The typical Wendy's customer spends about $4.75 per visit, CIBC
analyst Glass said. That compares with $4.25 at McDonald's, $4.20 at
Jack in the Box and $3.50 at Burger King, according to Technomic.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy's successful pricing policy has spawned at least one
imitator. Burger King, the nation's No. 2 burger chain, no longer
discounts its flagship burger, the Whopper.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy's attempts to go more upscale helped to boost same-store
sales by a strong 7.3% in June and 6.6% in the second quarter. Profit
jumped 14% to nearly $64 million, or 54 cents a share, on sales of
$684 million.</TE>
<TE>   "People go there and keep going back," Standard &amp; Poor's analyst
Dennis Milton said.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting Wall Street's faith in Wendy's, the company's stock has
appreciated by 24% in the last year. Shares closed down $1.89 at
$33.87on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to move the chain beyond its fast-food roots and
diversify into faster-growing concepts, Wendy's has been on a
spending spree of late.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the chain made its first foray into the fast-casual
arena by investing $10 million for a 45% stake in Cafe Express, a
Houston-based chain of 13 restaurants. The company hopes to grow the
concept to 50 restaurants within three to five years.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Wendy's agreed to buy the parent company of Thousand
Oaks-based Baja Fresh Mexican Grill for $275 million in cash. The
company hopes to expand Baja Fresh to as many as 700 restaurants in
five years, from 173 today. Baja Fresh, known for its homemade salsas
and burritos, is considered by many to be the star in the fresh
Mexican sector.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy's has hinted that acquisitions would play an increasingly
important role to help meet its annual profit goal of 12% to 15%
growth over the next decade. So far, analysts have applauded Wendy's
moves, including the 1995 takeover of Tim Hortons, its 2,200-unit
chain that controls 70% of the coffee and baked goods restaurant
market in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   But the strategy of growing profit and sales by gobbling up
competitors is fraught with risk, said Janet Lowder, president of
Restaurant Management Services in Rancho Palos Verdes. Acquisitions
often are difficult to digest, and they can divert management's
attention from running core businesses if any problems surface. If
Wendy's moves too quickly, the company could saddle itself with a
mountain of debt and high interest payments, just as CKE Restaurants
Inc. did when it acquired Hardee's four years ago for about $760
million.</TE>
<TE>   Schuessler said Wendy's would expand cautiously.</TE>
<TE>   As it positions itself for the future, Wendy's is looking
backward. The company, which profited for so long from late founder
Dave Thomas' folksy charm, has brought him back with new television
commercials that say the food is prepared "Dave's way."</TE>
<TE>   "Dave is ingrained in this company's values and culture,"
Schuessler said. "There was such an outpouring of emotion when he
died that we decided to subtly link [him] to the brand and food."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Dawn was approaching when the underground wizard stepped center stage
at the State Palace Theatre to survey his electronic wonderland.
Laser lights strafed the grand old chandeliers overhead, and
deafening machine music rattled the opera boxes. The floor was packed
with young, sweaty dancers.</LD>
<LD>   "Great crowd," J. Donnie Estopinal said. And then, with a boyish
smile, he added: "I wonder which ones are the cops."</LD>
<LD>   The gangly 32-year-old hefted a chugging smoke machine and aimed
it toward the audience of more than 3,300. If there were any
undercover drug agents in the Canal Street theater--and there almost
certainly were--Estopinal was suddenly gone before their eyes,
vanished in a billowing white cloud. It was a rare moment of low
visibility for the promoter whose parties have been ground zero for a
federal excursion into the rave world.</LD>
<TE>   The newest front in that campaign is a U.S. Senate bill that has
wide support on Capitol Hill. The legislation has a catchy name--the
RAVE Act, which stands for "Reducing America's Vulnerability to
Ecstasy."</TE>
<TE>   The act would tweak a 16-year-old federal drug law, originally
crafted to prosecute owners of crack houses, by expanding its
definition of a site devoted to drug enterprise to include one-time
events and outdoor gatherings. The law would make it a felony to
house events that knowingly profit from a drug culture. Its clear
model has been last year's case, brought here, of the United States
of America vs. Estopinal.</TE>
<TE>   "I still can't believe it sometimes, when I think of what's
happened," Estopinal said. "They told me these federal drug laws were
going to put me in prison for 20 years. But not for buying drugs, not
for selling drugs, not for using drugs. They never said I did any of
that. They said I put on raves. They looked around for somebody to
pound, and I was the lucky guy."</TE>
<TE>   Estopinal said his only knowledge of drugs at his raves is the
"same common-sense knowledge that tells me there's drugs at concerts
and clubs everywhere." The government case against Estopinal fizzled,
and charges against him were eventually dropped, but that has not
deterred authorities from using the New Orleans case as a template.
The campaign has sent a chill not only through the electronic dance
world, but also the ranks of civil liberty advocates.</TE>
<TE>   "The State Palace case was the opening battle, and it's absolutely
critical in understanding the RAVE Act, which now appears to be a
priority in the Senate with a very frightening prospect of passing,"
said Graham Boyd, an attorney with the ACLU Drug Policy Litigation
Project. "What's extraordinary here is the government recasting of
the drug laws to take an activity that has never been considered
criminal before and then criminalize it. And it's an activity very
intertwined with free expression.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically," the attorney said, "we're talking about putting on a
party."</TE>
<TE>   Not so, says Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), who introduced the
RAVE Act and has taken a prominent role in Senate hearings over the
last two years regarding Ecstasy and other club drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite what opponents of the bill would have you believe,
promoters who sponsor events where people can dance in a safe,
drug-free environment have nothing to fear from my bill," Biden said.
"My legislation is aimed at the promoters who seek to profit from
knowingly putting their customers at risk.... Next week the problem
may be country music bars or hip-hop clubs. Quite frankly, I don't
care what type of music is playing or what the venue is. What I do
care about is the behavior of promoters who turn their events into
drug dens."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Generational Conflict</TE>
<TE>   While the RAVE Act and the prosecution of Estopinal are matters of
law, a core question of the great debate is cultural and
generational: Are raves about music or drugs?</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the RAVE Act say the law could be stretched to go
after concert promoters who book reggae artists and sell
marijuana-themed T-shirts, or venues that host jam bands in the
Grateful Dead tradition and sell black-light posters.</TE>
<TE>   The legal saga of the State Palace is a jumbled tale of British
dance party traditions, Beltway politicking and a law originally
written to nail shut the doors of urban drug havens.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, the "crack house" laws were created to help police fight
the anonymous churn of cocaine houses. Dealers arrested in the
morning were replaced by afternoon, so the law presented a more
practical target in the property owners. The law made it a felony to
knowingly house and profit from a drug enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   In New Orleans in January 2001, a federal grand jury was asked:
Are rave promoters really all that different from the property owners
who collect cash for letting drug dealers set up shop under their
roofs? The answer came in a sealed indictment against Estopinal and
the owners of the State Palace.</TE>
<TE>   The rave parties at this venue, which sits in a gritty commercial
district on the fringe of the French Quarter, follow the familiar
beats of those set up in clubs, outdoor fields and warehouses in Los
Angeles, Miami, Berlin, Tokyo and beyond. The throbbing electronic
music and pulsing psychedelic lights create sensory overload, and a
crowd vibe prevails that could be viewed as neo-hippie. And, of
course, there are drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The effects of Ecstasy include euphoria, increased sensuality and
a buzzing intensification of the senses--all of which are stoked by
the rave atmosphere. But Ecstasy and other club drugs such as
ketamine and GHB can also be hazardous for ravers who dance in
crowded, broiling rooms for marathon parties. Body temperatures soar,
hydration dips, kidneys can fail and seizures can set in.</TE>
<TE>   When authorities came after Estopinal and the owners of the venue,
Robert and Brian Brunet, they pointed to a parade of limp youngsters
taken to hospitals. When he introduced the legislation, Biden cited
Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that 400 teens attending
State Palace raves had overdosed over a two-year period, a total
hotly contested by Estopinal. There is no debate, however, that in
1998 the drug-related death of a 17-year-old girl who had been at a
State Palace rave shifted the venue from local irritant to formal
target.</TE>
<TE>   In the months leading up to the grand jury, DEA undercover agents
reported that they bought 13 grams of Ecstasy at eight State Palace
raves. The government would argue that Estopinal and the Brunet
brothers knew dealers were active at the raves.</TE>
<TE>   The government also said the attributes of the State Palace raves
pointed to complicity by Estopinal and the Brunets in a drug
enterprise. Prosecutors argued that the venue sold items--such as
glow sticks, baby pacifiers and mentholated inhalers--that are
associated with club drug culture. Defense attorneys told Estopinal
and the Brunets the case was an ominous one, and the defendants
agreed tentatively to a plea bargain that would land them in prison
for terms of one to two years. The American Civil Liberties Union,
however, persuaded the men to fight the case.</TE>
<TE>   ACLU attorney Boyd said this week that his organization's efforts
and negative media coverage sapped the government's momentum in a
case it hoped to close with a quick and precedent-setting plea.</TE>
<TE>   The government did win a plea bargain, but it was a muted victory.
All charges against Estopinal and the Brunets as individuals were
dropped. Instead, the corporation that owned the State Palace entered
a guilty plea on the crack house laws, accepted a $100,000 fine and
agreed to a ban on items such as glow sticks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Political Victory</TE>
<TE>   The victory was undermined in several ways. In the days after the
plea, a new corporation was created by the Brunets to secure their
liquor license. The $100,000 fine has never been collected, Boyd
said, and an ACLU civil suit on behalf of State Palace patrons and
artists negated the ban on rave items. "It was a completely empty,
face-saving victory that meant nothing legally," he said. "But it did
have meaning politically."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Al Winters, who handled the State Palace
case, said Thursday he could not comment on the case, and he cited a
pending government appeal to reinstate the rave items ban. He did
offer one insight: "Once we executed search warrants at the State
Palace Theatre, the overdoses in the local hospitals went from 12
every time they had a rave to none. None. That's why we got into the
case. It was to try to stop the overdoses, and so far we're
successful."</TE>
<TE>   DEA Director Asa Hutchinson this week said the New Orleans case
was a worthwhile prosecution, but he said the "important tool" of the
Crack House Law would be more potent in cases in which promoters
actually deal drugs or have more traceable ties to dealers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to shut down raves, but we will, and we should,
put on notice any rave promoter who is going to facilitate, encourage
or engage in Ecstasy distribution that we're coming after them,"
Hutchinson said. "They're taking advantage of parents, taking
advantage of teenagers and doing a disservice to the music they
purport to love."</TE>
<TE>   Security searches at the State Palace are more intense these days,
and the wait in line can stretch to two hours. But few searches can
stop smuggling completely. In a rear row of seats, three ravers who
appeared to be in their early 20s huddled together as a fourth used a
credit card to sort white powder on a small pane of glass illuminated
by a glow stick.</TE>
<TE>   That scene may be part of the ritual for some ravers, but Robert
Brunet said the event is truly defined by the stage where, last
weekend, DJs making as much as $3,000 an hour and flown in from as
far away as Europe created sonic collages.</TE>
<TE>   "If this were about drugs, we would get local [DJs], anybody, and
just put them up there," Brunet said. "That would be a lot easier.
Kids wouldn't drive 10 hours to get here, either. Those are stars up
there."</TE>
<TE>   Edgy music scenes and drug culture have danced together for years,
of course, from the smoky clubs of the Jazz Age to the tie-dyed
trails of Woodstock and the bathroom lines of Studio 54. But Biden
says that, no matter the name of the bill, this is legislation about
drugs, not music events.</TE>
<TE>   The RAVE Act, introduced in mid-June, has raced through the Senate
process. Though ACLU attorney Boyd says he once viewed the bill as a
political flare--shot up for attention but without real lasting
heat--it now sits on the Senate's consent calendar, meaning it could
pass after the summer recess without debate. (There is no House
version of the bill.)</TE>
<TE>   The RAVE Act is given good odds by Hutchinson. "It's a little bit
early to predict, but it has a tremendous amount of support in
Congress because of the concern about club drugs. And that concern
will grow. We haven't seen all the dimensions of this problem yet....
I think there's very little public awareness of the problems of
Ecstasy, and the education curve is enormous."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Clouded Picture</TE>
<TE>   Education is foiled by misinformation, however, and good data are
hard to find in the swirl of raves. Drug use is the subject of wildly
divergent estimates (from 10% of ravers to 90%, depending on whom you
ask), and pegging the complicity of promoters in the drug trade may
be a slippery matter.</TE>
<TE>   Even the authorities have some fogginess about their own efforts.
In a phone interview this week, Hutchinson said the New Orleans case
was a success because, at least, the State Palace "no longer has
raves, it's been shut down." When corrected, he asked, "Well, it's
not the same promoter, though, right?"</TE>
<TE>   Last Saturday, getting ready to stage his latest rave amid the
faded majesty of the State Palace, Estopinal flopped in a chair
backstage and said that after his strange odyssey he is now embracing
misinformation and trying to dance unnoticed in the shadows.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't use the D-word," he said. "Look, I used to say, 'Yes, to
be honest, there is drug use at raves just like there is at the bars
on Bourbon Street and at rock concerts and sporting events.' And then
[the prosecutors] pulled out the old interviews and said that showed
I was aware of the drug dealers and was creating a place for them. It
was crazy. So now? Well, now there are no drugs at raves."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Defense Officials Discuss Widening Hunt for Al Qaeda</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Top defense officials met Friday to plot better ways to hunt down Al
Qaeda terrorists, especially covert commando missions to capture and
kill leaders of the scattered network, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   In a recent memo, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld asked Gen.
Charles R. Holland of the U.S. Special Operations Command and other
senior military leaders to come up with new ideas for tracking down
Osama bin Laden's network, two officials said on condition of
anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   The review comes in the 10th month of the campaign in Afghanistan,
where only remnants of enemy fighters are believed to remain.</LD>
<TE>   Special Forces troops have played a key role in the campaign that
smashed Al Qaeda operations in Afghanistan and routed the country's
former Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   In meetings Friday with Rumsfeld, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman
Gen. Richard B. Myers and other senior uniformed leaders, Holland was
presenting a plan he is developing for covert missions aimed at
attacking terrorist cells worldwide, one official said.</TE>
<TE>   It could include operations by the Army's elite Delta Force, Navy
SEALs and others acting on intelligence gained about terror cells
around the globe, one official said.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke declined to talk about
Holland's ideas and deflected questions about whether this meant the
Pentagon was trying to intensify the hunt.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got aggressive efforts underway all the time, but we are
constantly looking at ways to improve our capabilities, to make
better use of our resources," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld "wants everyone to understand the sense of urgency about
what we're doing here, that the threats out there are very, very
real," Clarke said.</TE>

<HD>Russia Plays Down Iran Aid</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>After three days of tense talks with top U.S. envoys, Russian
officials appeared to back away a half-step Friday from plans to
expand their nuclear cooperation with Iran.</LD>
<LD>   The Russian Atomic Energy Ministry issued a statement saying that
a program announced last week to expand the number of nuclear
reactors it plans to build in Iran is only a list of "existing
technical possibilities."</LD>
<LD>   "Their implementation depends on many factors, including political
factors," the statement said.</LD>
<TE>   One U.S. official familiar with the talks described the new
Russian statement as "big progress."</TE>
<TE>   "We're very pleased," the official said. "That's a change from
what they were saying early in the week."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, Russia has been working to complete construction of a
nuclear reactor in the Iranian city of Bushehr, a project begun by
the German firm Siemens and abandoned after the Iranian revolution in
1979.</TE>
<TE>   The plans released last week described a much larger, $10-billion
program of nuclear cooperation--three more reactors at Bushehr and
two at a new site, Ahvaz, bringing the total to six over the next 10
years.</TE>
<TE>   That program was announced just days before the scheduled arrival
of two U.S. officials--Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and
Undersecretary of State John R. Bolton.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials insist that the reactors are for civilian energy
use only and will not be used to develop fuel for nuclear weapons.
They point out that they will be light-water reactors, with the same
technology the United States is using in North Korea in an effort to
rein in that country's nuclear program.</TE>
<TE>   But the United States believes that Iran's purpose in acquiring
the reactors isn't energy but the expertise and equipment it would
gain along the way.</TE>
<TE>   "We have long been concerned that Iran's only interest in nuclear
civil power, given its vast domestic energy resources, is to support
its nuclear weapons program," Abraham told a news conference here
Thursday. "For that reason, we have insistently urged Russia to cease
all nuclear cooperation with Iran, including its assistance to the
reactor in Bushehr."</TE>
<TE>   Russian nuclear experts suggested that the release of the new plan
last week was a negotiating tactic.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a strong impression that is shared by many Russian
experts that the United States and Russia have already reached a
mutually acceptable agreement on Iran--everything is in the bag
already," said Anton Khlopkov, a nuclear expert with the PIR Center,
a Moscow think tank. "Both sides seem to have an understanding that
Russia will supply light-water reactors to Iran, but nothing besides
such reactors."</TE>
<TE>   But Radzhab Safarov, director of Russia's Iranian Studies Center,
said that to convince Moscow to drop its programs in Iran, the United
States will have to put its money where its mouth is.</TE>
<TE>   "Iran is a solvent country that is quite capable of paying,"
Safarov said. "The West, however, confines its efforts to words
alone: Do not do any business with Iran because it will affect global
security. These are good words, but they are just words, nothing
else. It is very unlikely that Russia will be convinced to change its
priorities only with the help of words."</TE>
<TE>   Iranian diplomats are expected to visit Moscow later this month to
discuss nuclear cooperation in more depth, according to Russian news
agencies.</TE>

<LD>   Despite extensive wounds, Parker managed to walk about a mile for
help. He underwent surgery and was listed in critical but stable
condition.</LD>

seats in Kashmir's State Assembly would be held Sept. 16 and 24 and
Oct. 1 and 8.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, at least five people were killed in gun battles between
security forces and suspected separatists. Pakistan said cross-border
fire by Indian and Pakistani troops inflicted more casualties. Both
nations claim Kashmir.</LD>

<HD>U.N. Chief Rejects Iraqi Invitation to Arms Inspectors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Secretary-General Kofi Annan coolly rebuffed an Iraqi request that he
dispatch U.N. weapons inspectors to Baghdad for "technical talks,"
saying through a spokesman Friday that the proposal does not comply
with Security Council conditions for the return of inspectors to
Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Hans Blix, the head of the U.N. arms inspection team, had already
turned down a similar Iraqi proposal for further discussions after
his inconclusive last meeting with Iraqi officials in Vienna a month
ago, officials here said.</LD>
<LD>   At Iraq's request, Blix and Annan have met with Iraqi officials
three times this year, and had insisted on some concrete indications
from Baghdad that inspections would resume before agreeing to further
meetings.</LD>
<TE>   In a letter delivered to Annan on Thursday, Iraqi Foreign Minister
Naji Sabri asked Blix and his aides to visit Baghdad to "review" the
outcome of disarmament talks held over the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Sabri said such talks could be "an important step toward ... the
establishment of a solid basis for the next stage of monitoring and
inspection activities"--far short of the clear commitment to renewed
inspections that Annan has sought.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that is new is the invitation to Baghdad itself,"
said one U.N. official, who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. weapons inspectors have not visited Iraq since they left
before U.S. and British bombing raids in 1998. The inspectors
complained that they were denied full access to Iraqi military
facilities, while Baghdad charged that they were spying for Western
intelligence agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Annan plans to discuss the Iraqi invitation during a private
luncheon with the Security Council on Monday, said his spokesman,
Fred Eckhard. But the secretary-general has already concluded that
Iraq's proposal for discussions about the possible return of
inspectors "is at variance with the one laid down by the Security
Council in its resolution of 1999," Eckhard told reporters here
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The council declared in 1999 that Iraq would first have to consent
to the return of weapons inspectors, after which the inspectors would
have 60 working days inside the country to assess Baghdad's
willingness to cooperate with the U.N. team. The inspectors would
then report back to the council, which would determine if the
inspections would go forward in exchange for a partial or complete
lifting of trade sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   Blix, who declined to comment on the Iraqi letter, does not have
the authority to negotiate the terms under which his inspectors would
operate, U.N. officials noted.</TE>
<TE>   There appeared to be little likelihood that the Security Council
would embrace the Iraqi proposal, according to diplomats here.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Bush administration officials challenged the need
for any further negotiations with Saddam Hussein's government over
the return of weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be a very short discussion," Sean McCormack, a
spokesman for the National Security Council, said Friday. "What he
should say is, 'Yes, I accept any time, anywhere, anyplace unfettered
inspections.' "</TE>
<TE>   In the Philippines, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said today
that Hussein was not willing to comply with inspections and that
there was no need for further discussions.</TE>
<TE>   "The approach is spelled out in U.S. resolutions. We should not
allow the Iraqis to move the goal posts," said Powell, who was
winding up a tour of Asia. "The goal is not inspections for
inspections' sake, but disarmament."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said U.N.
inspectors would be unable to detect weapons plants and arms caches
that he said Iraq has either buried deep underground or installed in
trucks and other mobile facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The French and Russian foreign ministries cautiously welcomed the
Iraqi proposal Friday. But Britain voiced skepticism, assuring
Washington of at least one key backer in the council discussions next
week.</TE>
<TE>   France, Russia and China have all strongly urged the Hussein
government to open its doors to inspectors to avert unilateral U.S.
action. Unlike the U.S. and Britain, the three other veto-wielding
council members have also argued that military strikes against Iraq
would be permissible only with the council's express consent.</TE>
<TE>   Even among critics of U.S. policy toward Iraq, however, there was
the perception that the Iraqi letter was a ploy to forestall U.S.
military action, diplomats said.</TE>
<TE>   By offering the symbolic step of allowing inspectors back into
Baghdad, if only for a meeting, the Hussein government hopes to
continue avoiding both U.S. military action and a thorough
independent search of its weapons inventory, suggested officials who
have negotiated with the Iraqis here.</TE>

<HD>Koreas Attempt to Revive Dialogue</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>South and North Korea began talks Friday aimed at reviving their
stalled dialogue, but the rivals were still haggling over who was to
blame for a deadly naval skirmish in June.</LD>
<LD>   A five-member Southern delegation headed for the three-day
discussions at the Mt. Kumgang resort on North Korea's east coast. It
is led by Lee Bong Jo, the chief policymaker of the Unification
Ministry.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides met informally Friday ahead of official talks today,
said reports by South Korean journalists accompanying the officials.</LD>
<TE>   The June 29 naval clash near the Koreas' disputed western sea
border is a potential stumbling block, as South Korea has vowed to
extract promises from the North to punish those responsible for the
skirmish and to refrain from similar provocations.</TE>
<TE>   The clash, near the Koreas' disputed western sea border, sank one
South Korean warship, killing four sailors. North Korea did not
confirm the South's estimate that 13 Northern sailors were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, North Korea expressed regret over the incident and
offered to resume dialogue with Seoul and its key ally, the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, the North Korean military proposed a meeting with the
American-led U.N. command at the border village of Panmunjom early
next week.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. command has requested such a meeting to protest the naval
skirmish.</TE>
<TE>   But North Korea says it has never accepted the sea border drawn by
the U.N. command. It was expected to demand that a new border be
drawn.</TE>
<TE>   The weekend meeting aims to set up Cabinet-level talks, which
ended in finger-pointing in November.</TE>

<HD>Mexicans Ponder a Triumph</HD>
<DH>Public works: Farmers exult in defeating an airport plan.
Others search for lessons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>When a few thousand subsistence farmers vowed last fall to resist
construction of a $2.3-billion airport in their cornfields, it
appeared to outsiders that they might stand a better chance trying to
stop Mexico's next earthquake.</LD>
<LD>   But President Vicente Fox's government underestimated the value
the farmers put on land handed down to them over four generations,
their willingness to shed blood in its defense and their refusal to
be bought off.</LD>
<LD>   Breaking from what it called heavy-handed methods of the past, the
government announced late Thursday that it was canceling plans to
build a six-runway airport for Mexico City on the dried-up Texcoco
lake bed 18 miles to the east and would study alternative sites.</LD>
<TE>   As villagers in San Salvador Atenco rang church bells Friday to
celebrate their unlikely victory, Mexicans weighed the costs and
lessons of Fox's humble retreat--in the face of machete-wielding
peasants who last month held 15 hostages--from what would have been
his administration's biggest public works project.</TE>
<TE>   The backpedaling, some Mexican commentators warned, will encourage
any group with a grievance and a weapon to resort to violence; will
undermine the rule of law; will diminish public confidence in Fox's
ability to complete projects; will make investors reluctant to
finance them; and, eventually, will leave North America's largest
city with inadequate air service.</TE>
<TE>   Others portrayed the triumph of the underdogs as a healthy product
of the more democratic--and less manageable--Mexico that Fox has led
since ending, with the 2000 elections, seven decades of authoritarian
rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party. The decision came as a
newly independent Supreme Court was weighing the constitutionality of
the law the government was using to expropriate the farmers' 13,300
acres of land.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a positive precedent," said Pedro Cerisola, minister of
communications and transport. "It's not a sign of weakness or a fear
of using force.... We are not going to impose decisions. The
government is willing to take no for an answer, and that is a sign of
change."</TE>
<TE>   One thing is beyond dispute. Fox and his team of technocrats
learned what the World Bank and other development experts have found
out the hard way in many other countries: If you want to build an
airport in a field, you'd first better talk to the farmers.</TE>
<TE>   "The government's biggest error was not taking us into account,"
said Ignacio Yanez, a 48-year-old corn grower who was arrested last
month when the farmers' protest exploded in violence. "We own this
land. They owe us respect. But they were accustomed to imposing their
will. Well, those times are finished."</TE>
<TE>   Fox's government announced the project in October, ending a
decades-long search for an alternative to the capital's hemmed-in
Benito Juarez International Airport. Officials simply decreed the
takeover of land held by 5,600 farming families in 13 villages,
offering them a price fixed in the expropriation law: $2,835 per
acre.</TE>
<TE>   Most farmers in the area own fewer than five acres, and many
complained that the payoff was insultingly low. Others recounted with
pride that the land they inherited had been seized from the rich
seven decades ago and distributed to the poor by the revolutionary
hero Emiliano Zapata, and they weren't about to sell at any price.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, few trusted the government to pay at all. It was only
last fall, Yanez said, that farmers got compensation for land seized
more than 15 years ago for a highway.</TE>
<TE>   "What would have happened to us?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   It was only after the farmers went to court to try to block the
airport that government negotiators began visiting Texcoco villages
in February.</TE>
<TE>   And it was only last month--after the bloody five-day hostage
standoff in Atenco--that Fox's aides sweetened the offer, increasing
it sevenfold. They also offered land swaps, new housing, scholarships
and vocational training for airport jobs.</TE>
<TE>   By then, it was too late. The airport battle had become the cause
of a combative array of leftists, anarchists and anti-globalization
activists who poured into Atenco to protest alongside the farmers.
Ten of the area's 13 villages were willing to negotiate, but a
militant minority carried the day.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico's more open political environment, the militants also
took encouragement from Fox's political opponents. Mexico City Mayor
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, of the left-leaning Democratic
Revolution Party, opposed the airport project. On Friday, he called
Fox's decision "reasonable and brave."</TE>
<TE>   Cerisola said the government "accepted reality and decided to stop
fighting" after concluding that there was not enough time for legal
battles and negotiations with the farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting with reporters Friday, he noted that such disputes had
delayed construction of airports in Madrid and Vancouver by more than
a decade.</TE>
<TE>   He also cited Tokyo's Narita Airport, where locals damaged the
control tower in 1978, adding years more work and considerably more
cost to the project.</TE>
<TE>   Cerisola admitted that the government made "errors in human
management" in Texcoco. But he said that consulting the farmers
before choosing the airport site would have set off uncontrollable
land speculation.</TE>
<TE>   And he defended the initial financial offer to the farmers, saying
legal limits on such payments were designed to prevent corrupt and
exorbitant deals involving kickbacks to officials.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent Abreu, a consultant to the World Bank on
development issues, said Mexico's leaders should never have chosen the
site without a full study of its potential effect on the farmers.</TE>
<TE>   The World Bank, under similar criticism in the early 1990s,
adopted guidelines requiring environmental and social impact studies
before financing dams, roads and other projects.</TE>
<TE>   Such large-scale projects, according to a World Bank study, uproot
about 10 million people from their homes worldwide each year--a
higher figure, on average, than the number displaced by armed
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "Governments keep making the same mistake," said Abreu, who
teaches at the University of Michigan. "In Mexico, where the capital
has severe problems because of migration from the countryside, they
should know better."</TE>
<TE>   Cerisola said not all the alternative airport sites on the table
are inhabited. He declined to list the locations but said new
technology could revive some options rejected in the past, including
an expansion of the capital's existing airport into a federally owned
lake bed on its eastern edge.</TE>
<TE>   Tizayuca, a strip of land in Hidalgo state that last fall was
Texcoco's principal alternative, is apparently back in consideration.
Officials have also proposed sites in the states of Morelos and
Puebla. All three are much farther from the city than Texcoco.</TE>
<TE>   The current airport can keep handling increasing volumes of air
traffic for seven to eight years, Cerisola said, adding that Fox was
determined to launch an alternative before his term ends in December
2006.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Army Targets West Bank City</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Military launches a retaliatory strike. It goes
after militants and bomb factories in Nablus, seen as a new terrorist
hub.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NABLUS, West Bank</DL>
<LD>The Israeli army, using helicopter gunships and more than 100 armored
vehicles, shut down this Palestinian city Friday, leaving three
people dead in a retaliatory strike after the bombing of a Jerusalem
university cafeteria.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli officials said the military operation was also intended to
round up local militants and destroy bomb factories located in
Nablus' Old City, or casbah. The roundup could take several days as
troops make door-to-door searches along the casbah's narrow
alleyways, which are likely to be lined with booby traps, said a
senior Israeli commander here. A spokesman for the Israel Defense
Forces said that two bomb factories have been discovered and that one
contained a Kassam rocket, which has a range of about five miles.</LD>
<LD>   The military operation came two days after a bomb was detonated
inside a crowded Hebrew University cafeteria, killing seven people,
five of them Americans. The Islamic group Hamas said the bombing was
in retaliation for an Israeli air attack last week that killed the
leader of its military wing and 14 others, mostly children.</LD>
<TE>   In the last several days, the people of Nablus, the largest
Palestinian city in the West Bank, have refused to adhere to a strict
Israeli-imposed curfew that has been in effect for more than a month.
They opened shops and took to the streets, attempting to return to a
semblance of normality despite Israeli sanctions imposed on seven of
the eight major West Bank cities in June after back-to-back suicide
bombings.</TE>
<TE>   But on Friday, this city of 135,000 people was eerily deserted,
save for a few adventurous children who dashed out into the street to
play soccer, listening for the sound of approaching Israeli armored
personnel carriers.</TE>
<TE>   Armored vehicles surrounded the Old City, and by late afternoon,
about 50 Palestinians had been arrested. The Israeli army had not
entered the casbah in force since April, when it was the scene of
bloody gun battles.</TE>
<TE>   Outside Nablus, in the village of Salem, troops surrounded the
home of Hamas activist Amjad Jubur, and shot and killed him when he
tried to escape, Israeli officials said. At least two other
Palestinians were shot to death in the Old City.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat called the Israeli
operation "a new massacre" while Israeli government spokesman Dore
Gold said the reason for the incursion was that Nablus had replaced
nearby Jenin as a hub for plotting suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   "We are dealing with a new generation of terrorists, which sprang
up relatively recently under the leadership of their more seasoned
cohorts," said the Israeli military commander, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   At Rafidia Hospital in the heart of Nablus, an ambulance arrived
carrying the body of a young man who had been shot in the head during
the Israeli operation.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at him," ambulance driver Said Aker said angrily. "He was
just sitting in his house. He's wearing his pajamas."</TE>
<TE>   Husam Jawhari, the hospital director, said that in some cases it
took more than an hour and a half to get the wounded to the hospital.
"People were making telephone calls and begging someone to come help
them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the third floor of the hospital, Wisam Shaheen, 42, was
recovering from surgery to remove a bullet from her chest. Her
22-year-old son, Majdi, also had been shot and had narrowly survived
his operation. Shaheen said she and her son went to their balcony as
soon as the shooting started to see what was happening.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as we came out, they started shooting at us," she said,
her body covered with a wrinkled blue sheet. "I screamed, 'My chest,
my chest!' when I was shot, and my son was crying as well. There was
shooting in all directions. We called for an ambulance, but they
couldn't come."</TE>
<TE>   Shaheen said her son works in a different town and arrived for a
visit the evening before the Israeli incursion.</TE>
<TE>   "It was his fate," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gaza Strip, an 85-year-old Palestinian woman died early
Friday after being shot by Israeli soldiers who mistook her for a
gunman trying to sneak up on a Jewish settlement.</TE>
<TE>   An Israel Defense Forces spokesman said soldiers detected someone
moving "suspiciously" in an area near the Kfar Darom settlement and
opened fire. When the soldiers discovered it was an elderly woman,
they took her to an Israeli hospital, where she died. The IDF
expressed "extreme sorrow" over the death.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Israeli press reported that the commander of the
Israeli forces on the West Bank, Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Eitan, has signed
orders to expel two relatives of Palestinian suicide bombers and that
the Israeli attorney general had given his approval. If appeals fail,
they will be expelled from the West Bank to the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   And at a tearful ceremony early Friday at Ben Gurion International
Airport near Tel Aviv, the bodies of two of the American victims of
the university bombing attack were flown to New York. The two wooden
caskets held the bodies of Benjamin Blutstein, 25, of Susquehanna
Township, Pa., and Janis Ruth Coulter, 36, of New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Their lives are testimony to the values shared by the U.S. and
Israel, lives of religious commitment and tolerance," U.S. Ambassador
Daniel C. Kurtzer said. "Terrorists cannot live by these values, so
they murder beautiful young people."</TE>

<HD>Chinese Capitalists Cool to Party Invite</HD>
<DH>Politics: Many entrepreneurs see little benefit in joining
Communist ranks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Chen Zhaoliang aspires to become a living contradiction. A practicing
capitalist, Chen applied last August to become a card-carrying member
of the Communist Party.</LD>
<LD>   He submitted his application almost immediately after China's
leaders announced that the party would open its doors to
entrepreneurs, ending its long-standing vilification of people like
Chen as "class enemies." In a land where the private sector now
accounts for more than a third of the economic output, the party knew
that it had to do something to stay relevant.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe in the credo of the current Chinese Communist Party,"
said Chen, 43, who owns a private trading company. "It recognizes
that people like me are builders of 'socialism with Chinese
characteristics' "--the official euphemism here for a market-oriented
economy.</LD>
<TE>   As he anxiously awaits word on his application, Chen is lonelier
than might be expected in his ardent, if incongruous, quest to join
China's ruling party.</TE>
<TE>   After President Jiang Zemin announced the controversial reversal
in policy a year ago, analysts predicted a cascade of applications by
businesspeople eager to take advantage of the connections and
protection that membership in the 64-million-strong party offers.</TE>
<TE>   So far, however, that stampede has failed to materialize. Instead,
entrepreneurs have stayed away from the party in droves, put off by
corruption scandals, skeptical of whether membership would offer any
real benefit or discouraged by an onerous vetting process.</TE>
<TE>   Three months ago, for example, Beijing party boss Jia Qinglin
boasted that more than 90 entrepreneurs in the capital had applied
for membership--a puny number considering that 120,000 private firms
operate in this city.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, in a remarkably frank report published in January by a
government-backed think tank, less than 8% of private business owners
nationwide expressed interest in joining the Communist Party. Eight
times as many people said that giving to charity would be a better
way to enhance their social status.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at how many corrupt officials there are inside the party and
how many problems the party has," said Wang Changjiang, a professor
at the party's national training academy in Beijing, where cadres
from throughout the country are drilled in ideology, governance and
administration.</TE>
<TE>   "People have lost their confidence and trust in the party," Wang
said in a candid interview. "It's hard to convince people why they
ought to join."</TE>
<TE>   But the pitch to new groups of people must be made, Wang said,
because it's the only way for the Communist Party to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Wang is a firm supporter of the new policy on entrepreneurs, which
he believes will attract the high-quality talent the party needs to
haul itself abreast of fast-changing times.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone agrees. Opposition has dogged the policy reversal
from the start, led by a dwindling but still influential old guard of
orthodox Marxists who see as much logic in inviting entrepreneurs to
join the Communist Party as in welcoming steak-eaters into a
vegetarian society.</TE>
<TE>   Their opposition was aired in China's state-run media last summer
and prompted a crackdown on dissent by President Jiang, the driving
force behind the policy shift. A high-profile leftist journal, Search
for Truth, was shut down after it criticized the speech Jiang gave
July 1, 2001--the party's 80th anniversary--that paved the way for
entrepreneurs to enlist in the cause.</TE>
<TE>   Partly because of the internecine squabbling, recruitment of the
party's erstwhile enemies has proceeded slowly.</TE>
<TE>   Caution is the name of the game in Chinese politics this year, as
the Communist regime prepares for its biggest leadership reshuffle in
years this fall. Jiang, who is expected to relinquish his position as
the party's No. 1 leader, has only limited political capital he can
draw on to push through his new policy and get it formally enshrined
in China's Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   "As a lame duck, no one seems to be inclined to do him any
favors," said Bruce Dickson, an expert on Chinese politics at George
Washington University.</TE>
<TE>   The wariness among China's political elite trickles down to the
local level, where actual recruiting of party members takes place.</TE>
<TE>   "Local officials may prefer to wait and see, either out of sincere
resistance to letting entrepreneurs into the party, or
self-preservation, lest they be accused of promoting a policy that
may not get formal approval," Dickson said.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its go-slow approach, the Communist Party has limited
active recruitment of entrepreneurs to 10 provinces and major
metropolises, including the wealthiest, most go-go pockets of
capitalism in China, such as Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong
provinces. In some of these areas, entrepreneurship and party
membership have already quietly coexisted for years.</TE>
<TE>   Chen, the private trading company owner and party aspirant, is
based in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, an economic
powerhouse. Chen was among the first entrepreneurs to apply for
membership under the new rules.</TE>
<TE>   His eagerness to sign up is ideological, not practical. "I support
and believe what the current party advocates," such as its emphasis
on economic development, Chen said. "It has nothing to do with
whether it will help my business."</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, his application is under inspection by apparatchiks
who are supposed to examine Chen's attitude toward the party and
toward society, his support for party policies, his treatment of his
employees, his payment of taxes and his contribution to society.</TE>
<TE>   He is confident that he'll pass muster and sees nothing odd about
avowed capitalists belonging to a party that once reviled them.</TE>
<TE>   "Private business owners aren't exploiters.... There isn't any
exploitation going on these days," Chen said. "Today's capitalists
are different from what Marx described in his works."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but fear of Marx and a recrudescence of the radicalism he
inspired continues to worry the private sector, according to the
report published in January by the government-sponsored Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese in their 40s and 50s grew up indoctrinated with the idea
of class struggle and saw it played out in often brutal ways, such as
the persecution campaigns of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people still react with fear and trepidation when speaking
of those days," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides fear, the party also inspires simple indifference.</TE>
<TE>   Many, if not all, of the people it is now trying to attract
already have a more powerful currency in their pockets than a
Communist Party membership card: money. Cash, and wads of it, can now
open more doors in China than proper political credentials.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a party member, and I'm not interested in joining," said
Wang Juntao, the head of one of China's biggest Internet companies.
"It's of no use."</TE>
<TE>   Such apathy means that party membership can be a tough sell. But
it can also mean good news for the Communist regime in that
entrepreneurs, as members of China's growing middle class, have yet
to set their sights on becoming a collective political force.</TE>
<TE>   Private businesspeople may chafe at the system, but many have
learned to navigate it. During the pro-democracy protests that swept
China in 1989 and resulted in the Tiananmen Square massacre,
entrepreneurs were mixed in their attitude toward the protesters.
While in Beijing some threw their support behind the movement, in the
southern city of Xiamen they disapproved, according to an article by
Dickson, the George Washington University professor, published last
year.</TE>
<TE>   "Entrepreneurs may favor liberalization in order to promote
economic growth, but there is little evidence that these same people
favor democratization," Dickson wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, because China's economic and political elites overlap
considerably, especially at the local level, the status quo may even
be reinforced. This is clearly the Communist Party's aim in trying to
co-opt private entrepreneurs.</TE>
<TE>   Chen, the Guangzhou businessman, said he would welcome the chance
to get involved in politics after his party membership goes through.
But it would be within the party structure, not outside it.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't have my current success without the reformed party,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Turkey Passes Hotly Debated Reforms to Ease Entry to EU</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>Turkey's parliament abolished the death penalty and legalized
education and broadcasts in the Kurdish language early today, moves
aimed at improving the country's chances of joining the European
Union.</LD>
<LD>   Parliament sounded more like a soccer stadium than a lawmaking
body during a marathon debate that began Friday, with pro-EU
legislators and nationalists opposed to the reforms shouting at each
other. But finally, a show of hands voted in the reforms.</LD>
<LD>   The EU had made the changes a condition for Turkey's joining the
union after making it a candidate for membership in 1999. Deep
divisions within Turkey over the reforms had deadlocked the
government in recent months and fueled a political crisis.</LD>
<TE>   Legislators rushed to pass the legislation in an emergency meeting
after parliament this week approved general elections for November,
18 months early.</TE>
<TE>   The EU is scheduled to draft a report on Turkey's progress on
reforms in October. In December, the EU hopes to complete enlargement
talks with about 10 candidate countries. Turkey wants to clinch a
date for a start of membership talks at that summit.</TE>
<TE>   "We are happy that the death penalty is being lifted in Turkey,"
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said.</TE>
<TE>   The 14-point reform package was passed despite sharp opposition
from the nationalists, the largest grouping in parliament, who want
the death penalty applied to Abdullah Ocalan, the jailed leader of
Kurdish rebels.</TE>
<TE>   During the sometimes angry debate, nationalist legislator Mehmet
Gul derided his pro-EU colleagues, telling them that lifting the
death penalty means "forgiving Ocalan and the terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Turkey has not executed anyone since 1984, although courts impose
death sentences. Fifty people are on death row.</TE>
<TE>   The reform package replaces the death penalty with life
imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Capital punishment
remains on the books, however, for times of war.</TE>
<TE>   The reforms also legalize long-banned TV and radio broadcasts in
the Kurdish language and allow Kurdish and other regional dialects to
be taught in special courses.</TE>
<TE>   The package also expands freedom of expression, the right of
association, and imposes stricter penalties on human traffickers.</TE>
<TE>   It allows non-Muslim minority communities such as Greeks,
Armenians and Jews greater rights over religious property, such as
churches.</TE>
<TE>   The reforms also amend regulations governing the
police--frequently accused of human rights abuse.</TE>

<HD>Military Aid to Indonesia Revived in War on Terror</HD>
<DH>Asia: Restoration of ties will end U.S. restrictions
imposed a decade ago because of rights abuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>In a bid to prevent the world's most populous Muslim country from
becoming a thriving haven for extremists, Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell announced Friday that the United States will begin restoring
military ties and provide more than $50 million to improve
Indonesia's ability to wage war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The two measures will open a new chapter in U.S.-Indonesian
relations after a decade of restricted contact and aid. They are also
a major boon to a country vulnerable to Islamic militancy in a
region, Southeast Asia, known as the second front in the war on
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "Indonesia has got a threat, the United States has a threat, and
we all need to work jointly against these kinds of organizations and
these sorts of individuals," Powell said at a news conference here
during an eight-nation Asia swing.</LD>
<TE>   Indonesia gained new importance after Sept. 11, since extremist
groups based here were found to have ties with Al Qaeda. Some cells
plotting against U.S. targets in Singapore, Malaysia and elsewhere in
the region have been uncovered over the last eight months. And
several fugitives linked to the Al Qaeda terrorist network or local
extremist cells are now hiding in Indonesia, according to U.S. and
Asian officials.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia has also been the most lax nation in the region in
moving against Islamic militants. Just a day before Powell's arrival,
the head of a leading militant group was put on trial on charges of
inciting hatred--only to have the judge postpone the trial because
the defendant looked ashen. Jafar Umar Thalib, a radical cleric who
heads the paramilitary group Laskar Jihad, was released pending the
resumption of prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   But Indonesian Foreign Minister Hasan Wirajuda told reporters
Friday: "The fact is that Indonesia is not Afghanistan, and we do not
believe that Indonesia will become the future Afghanistan....
Indonesian Muslims are very moderate ones."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has also opted to begin normalizing
military contacts despite the fact that the government of President
Megawati Sukarnoputri has not yet complied with a U.S. congressional
mandate to account for past military abuses.</TE>
<TE>   Washington scaled back military ties in 1992 because of Jakarta's
repressive tactics in East Timor, a territory it had annexed. All
connections were severed in 1999 after Indonesian militias backed by
the army allegedly engaged in atrocities when East Timor voted for
independence. Indonesia, which has been undergoing a turbulent
transition to democracy since 1998, has not charged or put on trial
most of the military officials associated with that period.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the United States will provide more than $50 million
over the next two years to beef up Indonesia's counter-terrorism
forces and capability, Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is getting around congressional restrictions on providing
aid to the army by channeling most of the funds to Indonesia's
fledgling police force, which was recently carved out of the
military.</TE>
<TE>   About $47 million will go to training the police, with $16 million
of that devoted to the creation of a special counter-terrorism unit.
Other funds will be used to help secure the borders of this nation of
more than 13,000 islands.</TE>
<TE>   But Washington has also allocated $4 million to Indonesia's
military for "fellowships" in counter-terrorism, with an additional
$400,000 for military training pending congressional approval.</TE>
<TE>   "As a result of the leadership shown by President Megawati, we are
able now to start down a road toward greater military-to-military
cooperation and more work with your police forces, as you deal with
those elements within every society these days that are determined
not to respect the rights of people, not to respect democracy, but to
undertake terrorism as a way of pushing their evil agenda," Powell
told a joint news conference with Wirajuda.</TE>
<TE>   Powell cautioned that Congress would be "watching carefully" and
would still expect action to be taken against past rights violators.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not at the end of the road yet, but I think it's a very
strong and positive start," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   The deepening American involvement in Indonesia underscores some
of the challenges faced by the United States in its war on
terrorism--and some of the compromises being made, especially in the
realm of human rights.</TE>
<TE>   A State Department survey this year reported that Indonesia's
human rights record was "poor" and that "serious abuses" were
ongoing. The 275,000-strong armed forces were continuing to engage in
shootings of civilians, torture, rape, beatings and other abuses and
"are not fully accountable to civilian authority," the report
alleged.</TE>
<TE>   Powell has insisted during his tour through Asia that the United
States has no intention of compromising on human rights in the name
of fighting extremism.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to defeat the terrorists, then we're going to have
to attack them from the highest moral plane, and human rights must be
protected," he said in Brunei on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But in a warning to Powell this week, the monitoring group Human
Rights Watch reported "widespread allegations that elements of the
Indonesian armed forces helped create and train radical Indonesian
Muslim organizations."</TE>
<TE>   "Until the Indonesian armed forces demonstrate a commitment to
accountability and civilian control, they will be an unreliable
partner in fighting terrorism," said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington
director of the group's Asia division.</TE>
<TE>   In the Philippines, the last stop of his Asian tour, Powell said
today that the heightened U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia did not
signal an intent to reestablish permanent military bases.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States is not interested in returning to the
Philippines with bases," he said. U.S. troops were stationed at Clark
Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station in the Philippines for decades
after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 U.S. troops just concluded a six-month stint to help
the Philippines deal with the Muslim extremist group Abu Sayyaf.</TE>

<HD>Economy Suffers Another Setback</HD>
<DH>Employment: The jobless rate in July holds at 5.9%, which
is seen as one of a growing number of signs that the nation's
recovery is sputtering.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's unemployment rate hung at 5.9% in July as U.S. employers
reacted to a plummeting stock market and weakening consumer demand by
adding only 6,000 net new workers, the Labor Department said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   July's jobs figure was sharply lower than the 66,000 created in
June and the 60,000 that economists had been predicting for last
month. Coupled with an unexpected drop in the average workweek, the
figure was another sign that the economic recovery, which seemed so
strong earlier this year, is sputtering.</LD>
<LD>   "It's hard to put a good face on these numbers," said Princeton
University labor economist Alan B. Krueger. "Six thousand is
essentially no job growth at all."</LD>
<TE>   Compounding the bleak picture, the Commerce Department reported
Friday that U.S. factory orders fell 2.4% in June, instead of rising
0.5% as analysts had expected. The decline came atop earlier reports
suggesting that the comeback of the nation's hard-hit manufacturing
sector is stalling.</TE>
<TE>   Investors reacted by driving down the Dow Jones industrial average
193.49 points, or 2.3%, to 8,313.13, and snapping up bonds, which are
considered a financial haven in bad times. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index and Nasdaq composite index fell by similar percentages. The
bond buying binge drove the yield, or market interest rate, on some
securities to record lows.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street was swept by rumors that the Federal Reserve is
preparing to cut its key interest rate again out of worry that a
weakening economy and tumbling market are feeding on each other and
could pull the country back into recession.</TE>
<TE>   But with the benchmark overnight-funds rate already at a
four-decade low of 1.75%, many analysts said the central bank would
hold off on additional cuts as long as possible.</TE>
<TE>   In an apparent move to reassure markets, Robert Parry, president
of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said Friday that the
economy remained on track to recover.</TE>
<TE>   "While the path of expansion does appear to be volatile, I believe
it's still intact," Parry told an audience in Portland, Ore. He is a
nonvoting member of the Fed's policymaking Open Market Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The cumulative effect of this week's statistics has been to
tarnish a comforting picture offered by business and political
leaders of a U.S. economy that has become disconnected from its stock
market and is proceeding with a recovery even as stocks suffer steep
losses.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to barely perceptible job growth, reports in recent
days showed that the economy expanded at only a 1.1% annual pace
between April and June, substantially less the 5% rate at which it
grew the preceding three months.</TE>
<TE>   "What the numbers suggest is the economy is not growing in any
consequential fashion," said Fred Breimyer, chief economist for State
Street Corp. in Boston. "Whatever positive trends were underway
earlier in the year slipped backward in July."</TE>
<TE>   All eyes now are on American consumers, who have kept the economy
afloat with a binge of borrowing and buying that has offset sharp
cutbacks by business.</TE>
<TE>   Economic optimists were quick to tout figures this week that
indicate that consumers still have the urge to splurge. These
included a report Friday that consumer spending climbed a solid 0.5%
in June, and another Thursday that showed July auto sales running at
a near-record annual pace of 18.1 million vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   But skeptics counter that most of the recent buying was based
almost entirely on rock-bottom interest rates that can't be sustained
indefinitely--and that, in any case, consumers already have borrowed
to the hilt.</TE>
<TE>   Outstanding consumer credit, most of it from credit cards and auto
loans, rose 5.7% in the 12 months ended in May, according to recent
Fed figures. Home mortgage and home equity loan debt rose more than
10% in the year ended in March.</TE>
<TE>   To many skeptics, Friday's job figures cinched the case for
concern.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't get some faster job growth soon, the unemployment
rate will almost certainly start to go up," said Paul L. Kasriel,
economic research director for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   If that happens, Kasriel said, "it's going to be bad for a lot of
these households that have borrowed."</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to start seeing a lot of people declaring
bankruptcy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Employment needs to expand by about 150,000 a month just to keep
pace with the entrance of new workers, economists estimate. Anything
slower, and either the jobless rate goes up, or employees who have
lost jobs give up looking for new ones and drop out of the labor
force.</TE>
<TE>   The latest jobs report showed that what little growth there was in
July occurred in services but that it was more than offset by
employment cutbacks in construction, manufacturing and temporary
employment.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's service sector added 50,000 workers during the month,
its fifth straight monthly increase, the Labor Department reported.
More than half were in health care.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the construction industry shed 30,000 jobs;
manufacturing trimmed 7,000; and the temporary-employment industry,
which had been adding workers, dropped 35,000.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 8.3 million workers were jobless in July, about the same
as in May and June. In addition, 4.2 million people who wanted
full-time employment were working part time during the month, up
278,000 from June, and an additional 1.5 million were counted as
"marginally attached" to the labor force, having looked for a job
during the last year but not in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said that just as disturbing as the negligible job growth
was the fact that the average workweek declined three-tenths of an
hour to 34 hours.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not going to get job increases, at least you should be
getting a rising workweek at this stage in a recovery, but we
didn't," said Kasriel of Northern Trust.</TE>
<TE>   On a positive note, average hourly earnings for production and
nonsupervisory workers, who make up about 80% of the nation's labor
force, continued to rise in July, climbing 4 cents to $14.79.</TE>
<TE>   And despite the lack of job growth in July, Labor Department
officials revised figures upward for May and June. A combined 88,000
net new jobs were added in the two months, up from the 60,000
previously reported.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the economy has not recovered the job-creating power it
demonstrated in the best years of the 1990s expansion, when employers
regularly added close to 400,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say current conditions bear a striking resemblance to
those of the early 1990s, when it took the unemployment rate more
than three years to recover from a mild recession. The revival became
known as the "jobless recovery."</TE>

<HD>Shaken Parents Taking More Child Safety Precautions</HD>
<DH>Trend: Abductions have led to fingerprinting, even DNA
sampling. But some see an overreaction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jolted by the recent string of high-profile child abductions, more
parents nationwide are fearful about their youngsters' safety and
taking such precautions as teaching them escape tactics, recording
their fingerprints and storing their DNA samples.</LD>
<LD>   Officials warn against panic, saying that such crimes actually
have declined in recent years. Some experts question the usefulness
of various anti-kidnapping measures and speculate that they may be
scaring children needlessly.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the abductions of Samantha Runnion, Elizabeth Smart, the
two teenagers from Antelope Valley and others nationwide have
prompted parents to lecture children--even very young ones-- about
potential dangers. Sponsors of child identification programs say
demand has risen dramatically in the last few weeks as edgy parents
have groped for peace of mind.</LD>
<TE>   For example, Georgia Young, visiting from Cheyenne, Wyo., recently
attended the Orange County Fair with her granddaughters Brianna, 10,
and Brittany, 11. She took the girls to a booth where the Irvine
Valley Masons offered free digital scans of children's faces and
thumbprints to help authorities locate them if they are abducted.</TE>
<TE>   Even in Cheyenne, where the pace of life is slower and the threat
of violence a little more distant, "everybody has got their antenna
up because of the kidnappings," Young said as she neared the front of
a long line of waiting families.</TE>
<TE>   The children's images are processed into a template that includes
space for names, nicknames, distinguishing marks, doctor, dentist and
other biographical facts. Parents and other caregivers receive a
document that can be quickly copied and distributed to police or
posted around the community in case the child disappears.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me feel better," said Brittany, who lives in Bellflower.
"It's something I can take home for Mom and Dad to keep."</TE>
<TE>   The fears have increased especially after intensive media
coverage, such as live television broadcasts of the funeral of the
5-year-old Runnion child kidnapped from her Stanton home and killed.</TE>
<TE>   Ceci Meyerpeter, a bank attendant from Pembroke Pines, Fla., said
she has become more worried about her daughters, Ashley, 5, and
Amber, 10 months. Until now, she hadn't warned Ashley about strangers
because "she doesn't understand people can be bad. But now I have.
She's too trusting, vulnerable and innocent.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't let her play outside anymore, and when she goes next door
to play, either her father or I watch her to make sure she's safe,"
Meyerpeter added.</TE>
<TE>   In Philadelphia, where 7-year-old Erica Pratt recently escaped
kidnappers, Roslyn McQueen said that case and others this summer
concern her as a parent and as owner of a small day-care center. The
two families that leave children in her care are questioning her more
about security. She requires that all children be signed in and out
of her care, for instance.</TE>
<TE>   For her own children, the rules also are tight. "When the sun goes
down, they come in," she said. "As a parent myself, I feel that we
really have to overprotect our children--make sure we know where they
are and what they're doing at all times."</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials stress that such concern is driven more by media
attention than reality. The number of so-called stranger abductions
has decreased: 143 cases nationally in the federal fiscal year (Oct.
1 to Sept. 30) of 1999, 106 cases in 2000 and 93 last year. From last
October to June, there had been 62 cases.</TE>
<TE>   But the FBI--which recently partnered with the American Football
Coaches Assn. to distribute free child identification kits--maintains
that caution is better than not being prepared. The agency said PTAs,
YMCAs and other civic groups this summer have been asking for the
kits and anti-abduction presentations at much higher rates than
usual.</TE>
<TE>   "The media has picked up on this recent spurt, but we have these
cases all the time," said April Brooks, a special agent who heads the
FBI's Crimes Against Children Unit. "Any program out there that helps
with the identification of kids is beneficial. Parents need to be
reminded that things like this can and do happen, to your own family
and to the neighbor next door, and they should be prudent in doing
things that will keep kids safe."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles today, police stations throughout the city will
open their doors to provide free fingerprinting and photos of
children for parents to keep.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn, who initiated the fingerprinting sessions,
also encouraged parents to walk with their children to school and
point out places and people they could run to for help.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the National Night Out crime-prevention program, Long
Beach police will fingerprint children next week and are expecting a
crowd. A department spokeswoman said it has fielded a marked increase
in calls in recent weeks from parents wanting the fingerprinting.</TE>
<TE>   The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children will soon
unveil a free digital identification package that parents can store
on a compact disc with release forms allowing direct distribution to
medical and law enforcement authorities via the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "Our phone volume has doubled, with parents asking what they can
do and communities asking what they can do," said David Shapiro, a
spokesman for the nonprofit Alexandria, Va.-based center. "When you
have the numbers of high-profile tragedies we've had, the mind-set
is: We need to so something now."</TE>
<TE>   Although photos and fingerprints cannot prevent an abduction,
police say the faster such information is available, the more likely
it is that the child can be retrieved.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts dismiss their effectiveness, saying they give
parents a false sense of security while alarming children. They worry
that an overwrought focus on kidnappings detracts from other safety
concerns--like children who don't wear bike helmets or who aren't
strapped in car safety seats--that are far more likely to endanger
them.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Glassner, a USC sociology professor, argues that parents are
being manipulated by relentless media hype as well as by slick
marketers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to imagine any serious danger to children that is less
likely than kidnapping by a stranger," said Glassner, who has written
about how media coverage drives the public's anxieties.</TE>
<TE>   "If parents are going to worry about anything, this is not what it
should be. We've had several very unfortunate events, but they do not
add up to a trend or, as some cable news channels are calling it, an
epidemic."</TE>
<TE>   Glassner said the furor over the most recent abductions is likely
to dissipate in a few weeks, but not before many parents have shelled
out money for DNA kits and other protective devices.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts predict that amateur fingerprinting done by parents
or at malls or fairs will end up illegible and worthless for
identification purposes. Similarly, a lock of hair or nail clipping
can become contaminated, they say. Filling that breech is a DNA
kit--selling for $14.95--that uses a swab of the inner mouth that can
be stored in a container at room temperature for years.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Matthews, a former Miami Beach homicide detective who created
the DNA storage kit, called Lifeprint, said that South Salt Lake,
Utah, police distributed 1,500 of the kits for free after 14-year-old
Elizabeth Smart was abducted from her home. Matthews also sells the
kits individually, and said demand spiked in communities where a
kidnapping occurred this summer.</TE>
<TE>   B'nai B'rith of Southern California, in response to the
abductions, is reissuing a free 40-page pamphlet on how parents can
protect children. The group is in talks with the Los Angeles Unified
School District to turn the book--which includes exercises, sample
conversations and role playing--into classroom or at-home lessons.</TE>
<TE>   Many parents clearly are groping for answers, for just the right
do's and don'ts that might prevent the unthinkable.</TE>
<TE>   "Since these kidnappings have occurred, it's made me talk to my
kids, especially the little ones," said Heather Somervill, an Irvine
mother who got her 4-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter
photographed and fingerprinted. "That's what really scares me--you
have to tell them it doesn't matter who it is or what they're
wearing, they can't trust any strangers. It's sad you have to get to
that point."</TE>
<TE>   In the Seattle area, Amy Sutton, an assistant in a physical
therapist's office, said much of the concern is media driven. "But
that doesn't mean it isn't important--anything that makes parents
more aware of the danger has to be a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   So she is talking to her 5-year-old son, Jeffrey, about not going
anywhere with strangers and how to tell her about suspicious-looking
adults.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to know how to protect him," she said. "I know the odds
are against him being taken, but every parent wonders."</TE>

<LD>Former U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, whose campaign to unseat Jeb Bush
as Florida governor has included a dance party at a glitzy nightclub,
has booked her friend Elton John to sing at a fund-raising concert,
campaign officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The concert is scheduled for Sept. 18--eight days after the
Florida primary in which Reno is seeking the Democratic nomination.
If she wins, she will run against the Republican Bush, younger
brother of President Bush, in the November general election.</LD>

<LD>A black activist and distant outsider in Seattle's mayoral race last
year was sentenced to 21 months in prison for hitting Paul Schell,
the then-incumbent mayor, with a bullhorn, breaking his nose and
shattering the bones around his eye.</LD>
<LD>   James Garrett, who is also known as Omari Tahir-Garrett, was taken
to county jail, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors on Wednesday found Garrett guilty of second-degree assault
with a deadly weapon in the attack on Schell in July 2001 at a
community meeting where Garrett and his supporters had been heckling
the white mayor.</LD>
<TE>   In the September Democratic primary, current Seattle Mayor Greg
Nickels won with 33% of the vote, while Schell got 22% and Garrett
took just 0.4%.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Ordered to Disclose Names of Detainees in Sept. 11
Inquiry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge dealt the Justice Department a significant legal
setback Friday by ruling that the United States must reveal the names
of almost 1,200 people it has detained since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   In a decision expected to be appealed, U.S. District Judge Gladys
Kessler rejected the Justice Department's argument that the names of
the detainees should be kept secret in the interest of national
security and to protect the privacy of those taken into custody.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly all of the detainees have been men of Middle Eastern and
South Asian origin who were swept up in the dragnet that followed the
deadly attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</LD>
<TE>   Most have been released from custody and deported because of
immigration violations. None of those detained--including 73 believed
to remain in custody--have been charged publicly with crimes related
to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Citing a 1969 federal court ruling, Kessler wrote: "Secret arrests
are 'a concept odious to a democratic society,' and profoundly
antithetical to the bedrock values that characterize a free and open
one such as ours."</TE>
<TE>   Kessler wrote that she understood and appreciated that "difficult
times such as these have always tested our fidelity to the core
democratic values of openness, government accountability and the rule
of law."</TE>
<TE>   But she added: "By the same token, the first priority of the
judicial branch must be to ensure that our government always operates
within the statutory and constitutional constraints which distinguish
a democracy from a dictatorship."</TE>
<TE>   Kessler ordered the Justice Department to turn over the names
within 15 days. But she said Justice Department officials may
petition her for an exemption on a case-by-case basis for detainees
believed to have knowledge of terrorist conspiracies. And she said
the government may withhold the name of a detainee if that person
specifically requests it.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials reacted swiftly and sharply to
Kessler's 45-page decision.</TE>
<TE>   "The Department of Justice believes today's ruling impedes one of
the most important federal law enforcement investigations in history,
harms our efforts to bring to justice those responsible for the
heinous attacks of Sept. 11, and increases the risk of future
terrorist threats to our nation," said Robert McCallum, assistant
attorney general for the civil division.</TE>
<TE>   Release of the names, McCallum said, "could jeopardize the
investigation and provide valuable information to terrorists seeking
to cause even greater harm to the safety of the American people."</TE>
<TE>   Terrorists could track the progress of the U.S. investigation and
shift strategies based on who has been arrested, Justice Department
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the government probably will seek an immediate stay
of the order and appeal it.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers who sued the Justice Department to force the release of
the names rejoiced at the ruling, saying it justified their concerns
that U.S. authorities had overstepped their bounds in aggressively
pressing post-Sept. 11 investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "The ruling is a vindication of our basic liberties: The
government may not arrest people in secret, the courts will stop
government abuses, and the tragic events of Sept. 11 may not be used
as an excuse to suspend basic rights and round up the most vulnerable
members of our society," said Kate Martin, lead lawyer for the legal
coalition.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 23 civil rights, human rights and civil liberties
organizations filed suit Dec. 6 after repeated requests for the names
of the detainees from the Justice Department had failed.</TE>
<TE>   Other plaintiffs included the American Civil Liberties Union, the
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, Amnesty International
USA, the National Assn. of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the National
Black Police Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Martin predicted that the release of the names would result in a
massive review of the Justice Department's actions, showing that many
people were detained in violation of their civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   "It opens the door to a public examination of whether the
investigation focused on terrorists or simply rounded up Arabs and
Muslims," said Martin, director of the Washington-based Center for
National Security Studies. "The judge did a very thorough job of
examining the government's rationales and carefully rejected their
overheated rhetoric that we have to abandon our basic democratic
principles at this moment in history."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling follows months of legal wrangling, in which the Justice
Department bitterly opposed demands that it release the names amid a
growing chorus of calls for it to do so.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling is the latest legal setback for the Justice Department
on the terrorism front--federal judges in Michigan and New Jersey
recently rejected the government's policy that immigration hearings
should be closed.</TE>
<TE>   Kessler's ruling, however, has no guarantee of being upheld on
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Appointed by President Clinton, she is widely considered to be a
liberal. The federal court of appeals for the District of Columbia
contains many conservative judges who could easily reject her
argument for full disclosure in favor of the Justice Department's
position that the nation's security is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "It would not surprise me either way," one former Justice
Department official said of the ruling's chance of being reversed.</TE>
<TE>   The appellate court's decision then can be appealed to the U.S.
Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The government detention of people suspected of having links to
terrorism began within hours of the Sept. 11 attacks, which killed
more than 3,000 people. By November, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said,
at least 1,182 people had been detained.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft has insisted that to release the names of the detainees
would compromise his department's investigation and assist Osama bin
Laden, the Al Qaeda terrorist network and others who want to harm the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   As the debate over the detainees intensified, Justice Department
officials acknowledged that few if any of those being held had direct
complicity in, or knowledge of, the Sept. 11 attacks--or any other
terrorism conspiracies. Nevertheless, they said, the detainees had
violated immigration laws and should be deported.</TE>
<TE>   By mid-June, government officials said only 73 people remained in
detention, with most facing immigration charges.</TE>
<TE>   Kessler took note of that, saying in her opinion that the
government affidavits "nowhere declare that some or all of the
detainees have connections to terrorism. Nor do they provide facts
that would permit the court to infer links to terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Kessler did uphold the government's right to withhold the
locations of facilities where detainees were being held, saying that
publicizing them would create a significant risk that the sites could
be targeted by terrorists or people angered by the detentions.</TE>

<HD>Church Can't Back Abuse Settlement, Cardinal Law Tells
Judge</HD>
<DH>Testimony: The 'proposed' offer could bankrupt the Boston
archdiocese if it is ruled as binding.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Cardinal Bernard Law, compelled to take the witness stand in open
court for the first time in the Roman Catholic Church's sexual abuse
scandal, on Friday defended the Boston Archdiocese's decision to back
out of a multimillion-dollar settlement with dozens of alleged
victims.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's senior Catholic prelate, under oath like any other
witness, testified that the settlement was only "proposed" and was
never made final between the archdiocese and 86 adults who claim they
were molested by former priest John J. Geoghan.</LD>
<LD>   He was asked to read aloud a newspaper article in which he praised
the agreement as "an important step in reaching closure."</LD>
<TE>   Under questioning from the attorney representing Geoghan's alleged
victims, Law said the settlement was tentative because not all of
them had signed off on it. He said the church withdrew from the
$15-million to $30-million agreement after financial advisors said
the price was too steep.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw it as a proposed settlement that would become effective
with the necessary signatures," Law testified.</TE>
<TE>   When attorney Mitchell Garabedian demanded to know why Law did not
use the word "proposed" in a March 15 editorial in the diocesan
paper, The Pilot, the cardinal replied: "I did not use that word as a
qualifier. I wish obviously now that I had used it. It would have
expressed the intent of my words more effectively."</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal was on the stand for more than two hours on the
second day of a hearing to determine if the agreement is binding on
the archdiocese. His testimony came as church officials said the
archdiocese might file for bankruptcy if the massive settlement is
upheld.</TE>
<TE>   "It is true that in the process of considering all possible
options in pursuit of a global settlement, legal counsel has been
authorized to review how bankruptcy law might apply to the
archdiocese," Archdiocese Chancellor David W. Smith said in a
statement Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Although the cardinal has been deposed repeatedly in civil suits
since the scandal began, those hearings were closed.</TE>
<TE>   Law and the archdiocese now contend that they are seeking a global
settlement that would cover all clerical sexual abuse victims. No
figure has been cited, but church officials have stressed their goal
of "fair and equitable" agreements for all alleged victims. Donations
to the archdiocese have dropped substantially since the scandal
began. Following a report Friday in the Boston Globe that the
archdiocese was considering filing for bankruptcy if it was required
to pay huge settlements, Smith said that no legal recommendation had
been received and no decision had been made.</TE>
<TE>   The public discussion of church finances was the latest in a
series of embarrassments for the nation's fourth-largest archdiocese.
Law's court appearance refueled the controversy over the cardinal's
role in the abuse scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Documents made public by the Boston Globe showed that the
archdiocese knew of Geoghan's history of accusations and that church
officials moved Geoghan from parish to parish rather than prohibit
his contact with children.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan was convicted of one count of child abuse in January and
is serving a nine- to 10-year sentence. Scores of civil suits
involving him are pending.</TE>
<TE>   Law kept a low profile at the annual bishops' meeting in Dallas in
June. But on tour in Canada last week with Pope John Paul II, he was
a prominent presence. Law is to give depositions next week in several
additional abuse cases.</TE>

<HD>Opening a Citadel of Prayer</HD>
<DH>Their order facing extinction, 11 Carmelite nuns end
decades of solitude and go dot-com. 'The life we lead, it has to go
on,' one says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Secluded in a fortress of stone, behind thick, high walls to block
the world, the Sisters of Carmel of the Resurrection pray.</LD>
<LD>   Their monastery bristles with battlements, commanding a hill.
Inside, the 11 aging nuns walk polished halls in austere silence.
Their retreat is a blankness of white walls without end, of oak doors
shut tight. The only sound is the prayer bell chimes.</LD>
<LD>   The Carmelites of Indianapolis do not teach or nurse or spread the
faith, as other Roman Catholic sisters do. Private prayer is their
vocation.</LD>
<TE>   Theirs is not a formal supplication on bended knee. It is a
meditation. They unfold their souls and they wait for words to come.
The sisters pray as they sit in their rocking chairs, watching the
birds peck seeds. They pray as they walk through the courtyard
garden, a tangle of green.</TE>
<TE>   They venture out of the monastery but rarely. It has been rarer
still for them to invite outsiders in. The isolation has brought them
joy. It has also brought them crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The Carmelites have not welcomed a new member in a dozen years.
Their average age is 70. Two sisters have died in the last few months
and another is ill.</TE>
<TE>   To ensure that the contemplative life they cherish will survive
them, the nuns have taken a momentous decision. They have forsaken
the seclusion that defined them.</TE>
<TE>   They have not given up their two hours a day of private prayer, or
their morning and evening silence. They still attend a daily Mass.
They still make a modest living selling altar bread and prayer books.
They still rotate the chores so each sister takes a turn with the
laundry, the cooking and the yard work.</TE>
<TE>   But the Carmelites of the Resurrection have opened up their
fortress. It has been a startling journey. Nuns of such simplicity
that they live on $1 a day have put their future in the hands of an
ad agency famous for fast-food commercials. Sisters who were once so
isolated they didn't know the Vietnam War had begun have requested
advice from the security director for the NFL's Indianapolis
Colts--who gave them all team T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   The Carmelites hired a part-time development director, Linda
Hegeman, to represent them. She rounded up an advisory board of two
dozen prominent citizens, each with a skill she thought might help
the sisters navigate a world they had long since left behind.</TE>
<TE>   The advisors--most but not all Catholics--included a software
designer, a public relations specialist, an administrator from the
local Catholic college and a former city police chief, now working
security for the Colts. The group is eclectic, but effective: Meeting
every month or two, its members pushed the nuns to move beyond their
original vision of a promotional brochure to consider a punchy online
campaign that had them posting their private prayers on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Timid at first, the sisters prayed over each suggestion--and ended
up taking most of them, with gusto. They now consider their advisors
as friends, hosting pizza parties for the board inside the monastery.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a stretch," Sister Joanne Dewald says.</TE>
<TE>   In the arched hallways of the monastery they helped build, the
sisters with hearing aids and white hair are determined to keep
stretching. They have discovered unexpected joy in engaging the
world. Their revolution has enriched their faith. It has also brought
them hope for a future. Nearly halfway through a five-year outreach
plan, the Carmelites are speaking with several young women who might
be interested in joining.</TE>
<TE>   "The vocation is so dear to us," says Sister Rachel Salute, 76.
"To see it dying out.... " She stops. She has been a Carmelite nun
since 1953.</TE>
<TE>   "You would go to such extremes," she says, "to prevent your
community from dying."</TE>
<TE>   "The life we lead, it has to go on," says Sister Ruth Ann
Boyle--at age 45 the youngest by two decades. "Just as much as the
work of teachers or nurses needs to go on, the life of prayers must
go on."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a calling. It's a service," Sister Joanne says. As a girl,
she dismissed the Carmelites as "loony." Now 72, she's the monastery
prioress--and she is convinced that when women give their lives to
prayer, their devotion can help heal the world. "It's hard to explain
this life. It doesn't make much sense," she says. "But you're drawn
to it."</TE>
<TE>   Sister Joanne first suggested several years ago that the nuns
consider reaching out to young women who might feel that same
mysterious call.</TE>
<TE>   The concept was not novel. As the number of nuns in the United
States has plunged--from 180,000 in 1965 to fewer than 74,000
today--many orders have tried marketing. Dominican nuns in Michigan
ran a commercial on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" with the tagline: "Life
is Short. Eternity Isn't." The Sisters of Mercy in New York advertise
in bus shelters, asking: "Do You Have a Call Waiting?"</TE>
<TE>   For the Carmelites, though, self-promotion did not come easy.</TE>
<TE>   Like other cloistered sisters--there are at most 4,000 in the
U.S.--the Carmelites of Indianapolis live sparingly, eating but one
cooked meal a day and sleeping in barren cells with barely enough
room for a bed, a desk and a chair.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, they were so sequestered that neighbors had no idea
whether nuns or monks lived behind the imposing turrets. The nuns
could not leave the monastery, even to visit a dying parent.
Relatives could visit just one hour a month, talking to the sisters
through an iron grate so thick, even fingertips could not touch.</TE>
<TE>   The nuns' main interaction with outsiders took place through the
"turn," a wooden cabinet set on a turntable at the front door of the
monastery. Visitors would place messages or packages in the cabinet.
A veiled sister on the other side of the wall would spin it,
wordlessly, to her. Sometimes, to the nuns' discomfort, Catholic
parents seeking a blessing would place a baby in the cabinet. The
sister inside would offer a hasty prayer, then whisk the newborn
back.</TE>
<TE>   That extreme isolation began to ease in the late 1960s, when the
Second Vatican Council called for reforming church life and its
rituals.</TE>
<TE>   The nuns started shopping for groceries instead of having them
delivered. They ordered their first newspaper subscription. They even
began opening their morning Mass to local Catholics; on weekdays, a
dozen visitors might gather with them behind the blue glass doors of
the chapel.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, however, the nuns keep their forays to the outside world
brisk: They buy groceries at Sam's Club (or pick up Subway sandwiches
as a treat) and then promptly return. They don't stop to chat. They
don't go out for fun. They shun what they call "clutter"--any
interaction that distracts them from prayer. Sister Joanne still
turns down invitations to address young women at the Catholic college
down the street.</TE>
<TE>   So it was a remarkable leap when--at the suggestion of their
development director--the sisters invited half a dozen executives
from the ad agency Young &amp; Laramore to the monastery two years ago to
discuss marketing.</TE>
<TE>   They met in the reading room, the only space in the cloister that
has been decorated--with a crystal wind chime, a black-and-white ink
drawing of a mountainous landscape, a straight-backed couch with thin
pillows. The sisters gather there in a circle to pray aloud each
morning. They were uneasy letting strangers in.</TE>
<TE>   The executives were a bit uneasy, too. They expected the sisters
might be slightly dotty from their self-imposed exile. Instead, they
found them witty, incisive, even irreverent.</TE>
<TE>   In their younger years, in full black habits, the nuns drove
bulldozers, dug postholes and hammered roof beams to build the
monastery. Now, in sandals and sundresses from Goodwill, they drink
diet Mountain Dew and wrestle pillows from their black Labrador
retriever, Lucy. They watch documentaries on ancient Greece. Also,
"Karate Kid II."</TE>
<TE>   They write prayer books with inclusive language (referring to God
as "you" instead of "master"). They joke about their years of
suffering in virtual quarantine. They even mock their own devotion to
two hours a day of private prayer.</TE>
<TE>   "What am I thinking about? I'm thinking I see a leak in the roof
over there. I'm thinking, why has this stock gone from $95 to $2,"
says Sister Betty Meluch, 70, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   After an hour with the sisters, Paul Knapp, president of Young &amp;
Laramore, was captivated. He volunteered at once to take
on--free--the job of selling the nuns to the world. His firm had
scored big with clever ads that made Goodwill clothes hip and Steak &amp;
Shake burgers saucy. The nuns were an irresistible challenge. All he
needed was a hook.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it's a steak burger or a nun, [you have to ask] 'What do
you want people to think of when they see them?' It's all about
strategic positioning," said Tom Denari, an agency vice president.</TE>
<TE>   Searching for that hook, the marketing team asked the nuns: "So,
what do you do?"</TE>
<TE>   "We pray," the sisters replied.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you pray?"</TE>
<TE>   "We pray the news."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the sisters devour current events. They read Time,
Atlantic Monthly, the Economist, National Geographic, Arthritis
Today. Often, a sister will don headphones during morning prayers to
catch National Public Radio. After Mass (led by a visiting priest),
they take turns discussing world events that merit special prayer.</TE>
<TE>   The ad team wanted to play off that passion. In a flash of
inspiration, praythenews.com was born.</TE>
<TE>   The interactive Web site offers Carmelite history and a prayer of
the day. The nuns post a sample daily schedule (feed the birds, pray,
change oil in the Taurus), and essays explaining the contemplative
life.</TE>
<TE>   The heart of the site is the News Perspective page, where sisters
post essays about current events--from famine in Eritrea to
pedophilia in the church, from corporate scandals to the temper of
basketball coach Bobby Knight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like we're raising our antenna, so if someone out there has
a calling to this life and is raising her own antenna, we might be
able to communicate," says Sister Terese Boersig, 69.</TE>
<TE>   Since praythenews.com was launched in March 2001, the site has
logged more than 12 million hits. Many readers return once a week to
read Sister Betty's take on the Taliban or see what Sister Joanne has
to say about Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Virtual visitors from around the globe have e-mailed prayer
requests to the Light a Candle page. Those prayers have opened the
nuns' eyes to the struggles they left behind when they took their
vows of poverty, obedience and chastity. So many asking for help
finding jobs, Sister Ruth murmurs. So many asking for help finding
love.</TE>
<TE>   More than three dozen women have contacted Sister Joanne online to
talk about Carmelite life, including eight who seem genuinely drawn.
One woman explained that the Web site had awakened the same joyous
feeling she felt when she prayed at the monastery years before. "It
made me wonder once again," she wrote, "whether I am called to
religious life."</TE>
<TE>   The outreach campaign forced the sisters to wrestle with the
modern world in ways they had never imagined.</TE>
<TE>   They have prayed much over whether to sell their books through the
Web site. They reluctantly agreed--on advice from Mike Zunk, the
Colts security chief--to conduct background checks on any woman who
applies to enter the monastery.</TE>
<TE>   Most dramatic, the sisters have found themselves, for the first
time, under pressure to produce something.</TE>
<TE>   The nuns who write the News Perspective face a deadline every
Monday. They dread it. For years, they have let their thoughts unroll
in languor. As they put it, they have focused on being, not doing.
Now, they must direct their musing to a particular topic, then commit
their prayers to paper. "A chore," Sister Joanne calls it.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the sisters cannot imagine again withdrawing behind the veil.</TE>
<TE>   "This is transformative," Sister Terese says. "We're not going
back."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Sister Joanne: "I don't think we could."</TE>
<TE>   The nuns have found joy in breaking down their cloister. For
years, they were convinced that steeping their souls in solitude
brought them closer to God. Now, they find spiritual strength from
their readers' words on the Web site.</TE>
<TE>   As they pray for a mother to recover from cancer, for an end to
civil war, for a raise, for a safe journey, the Sisters of Carmel of
the Resurrection feel they are performing a great service.</TE>
<TE>   They no longer pray for the world. They pray with it.</TE>

<HD>Fear Over Killings Grips Baton Rouge</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police say the same man, still at large, has slain
three women in recent months in Louisiana's capital. Thirty other
deaths get a second look.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BATON ROUGE, La.</DL>
<LD>The fear festered for months: Women had disappeared in broad
daylight, had vanished from home and from shaded trails--and turned
up dead. They were students and wives, improbable victims. It wasn't
until this week that police gave the fright a name: A serial killer
is loose.</LD>
<LD>   DNA evidence indicates the same man has killed at least three
women in the last 10 months, and now investigators are reexamining 30
other unsolved deaths to see whether those women too were victims of
this city's mysterious killer. As the heat of summer presses this
shadowy landscape of overgrown glades and clammy nights, a controlled
panic has seized Baton Rouge, Louisiana's capital.</LD>
<LD>   Women are buying up guns faster than the hunting stores can stock
them. Jogging paths are desolate. The easy interactions of these
laid-back streets have been replaced by terse responses and lowered
eyes. "You don't know what he looks like," said Donna Allen, a
28-year-old math teacher. At night she peers into the darkened yard,
jostles her husband awake--did you hear that? "Everybody's on edge,
paranoid. You jump at every little noise."</LD>
<TE>   The killer could be anybody, and so women here say they see him
everywhere. His victims had no obvious common trait, and so many
women fear they could be the next to disappear. "If we had a picture
of him, at least we'd have something to look for. But right now he's
a ghost," said Police Chief Pat Englade. "And we're seeing ghosts all
over Baton Rouge."</TE>
<TE>   Gina Wilson Green was the first to die. The 41-year-old nurse was
strangled at home last fall near the oak-shaded campus of Louisiana
State University. Police were baffled: There were no broken windows,
jimmied locks or busted doors.</TE>
<TE>   Then in May, a graduate business student, Charlotte Murray Pace,
was stabbed to death at her townhouse in the middle of the afternoon.
As in the Green case, the home of the 22-year-old Mississippi native
showed no signs of forced entry.</TE>
<TE>   Pace was living a few doors down from Green when the nurse was
killed, but the two women apparently didn't know each other. Pace was
slain just two days after moving to a new house four miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, police tested the DNA evidence and found that the same
man had killed Green and Pace. Investigators have refused to say
whether the women were raped or what sort of DNA samples were found
at the crime scenes. But Chief Englade acknowledged this week that at
least one of the women was sexually assaulted.</TE>
<TE>   From the alleyways of the old neighborhoods to the swampy gardens
of the university, news of the two related killings gave Baton Rouge
the jitters. Then Pam Kinamore disappeared. She was 44, an antique
dealer, real estate broker and artist, the mother of a 12-year-old
boy.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe she came home from work late to an empty
house on July 12, only to be snatched away into the summer night. Her
body turned up four days later in the woods off Interstate 10. Her
throat had been slashed.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, investigators made another announcement:
Kinamore was slain by the same man who killed Green and Pace. Once
again, he was linked by DNA, they said. "That was when it really,
really started to get scary," said Julie Newman, director of a Baton
Rouge community center. "That's when it got spooky."</TE>
<TE>   FBI investigators are helping local authorities profile a suspect.
But in the meantime, the dearth of information has imaginations
running wild. People in Baton Rouge tell the stories sheepishly:
Allen says she won't stay home alone, not even at midday. And
Southern hospitality is out the window--Newman doesn't like to give
directions to strangers anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived here all my life and I've never seen the community
afraid like this," police Cpl. Mary Ann Godawa said.</TE>
<TE>   After Kinamore's death, police received a tantalizing tip. A few
hours before sunrise on the night she disappeared, a driver spotted a
white man pulling off the interstate in a white pickup truck, a nude
woman slumped in the passenger seat. Police hypnotized the witness
and drew out more details: It was a Chevrolet. The bumper had a bad
paint job. The truck bore a Louisiana plate that might have included
the number 8.</TE>
<TE>   Word moved fast. The next morning, a 69-year-old nurse named
Rosalie Sweet drove to aerobics class gripped by fright. "I saw 25
white trucks, white trucks on every corner, and I was scared," she
said, shaking her head. "I turned around to come back and saw 15
more. I was just looking and looking." So far, police have been
unable to find the pickup.</TE>
<TE>   Paranoia is palpable between the long glass cases of Jim's
Firearms in east Baton Rouge. Usually the haunt of a modest assembly
of hunters, the store has been crowded with unlikely buyers from
morning to night. Manager Dan Calvert keeps expecting the gun zeal to
taper off--but every time another news report comes out, the
customers come in waves. Even Gov. Mike Foster got on the radio this
week to remind women they have the right to carry concealed weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since this started I have two bed partners: Mr. Smith and
Mr. Wesson," said Kitty Wascom, a 54-year-old school bus driver who
lives alone. "And I'm still not sleeping at night."</TE>
<TE>   Jim's Firearms is moving as many as 20 guns a day, and 250 vials
of pepper spray a month. In calmer times, the shop sells a couple of
guns a day and a dozen cans of pepper spray in a good month.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Baton Rouge heard that a serial killer was lurking in
its shadows, the city of more than 200,000 was on edge. After the
first two deaths were linked, worried residents packed community
safety meetings. The Advocate, Baton Rouge's daily newspaper, ran a
series of stories tallying more than 30 unsolved slayings of women
and suggesting that there could be connections.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't expect all of the cases to be connected--they won't
be. But I really don't know what kind of person we're dealing with
here," Englade said. "We've got a whole parish or even the whole
southern part of the state with some guy traveling around doing
this."</TE>

<CX>   Louisiana killings--A map of Baton Rouge, La., in Saturday's Section
A incorrectly referred to three sites as the locations where the
bodies of serial killing victims were found. In fact, the map showed
where the three women had lived. Two of the three women's bodies were
discovered at their residences, but a third was found 25 miles from
her home.</CX>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Frederick, Md., doctor whose apartment was searched by federal
agents for a second time Thursday in the ongoing anthrax
investigation was suspended from his job Friday, his attorney said.</LD>
<LD>   Steven J. Hatfill, 48, a former Army researcher and biochemist at
Ft. Detrick, the Pentagon's top biodefense research center, has not
been charged and has not been called a suspect in last fall's anthrax
mailings, which killed five people, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, he accepted a job as associate director of Louisiana
State University's biomedical research center. But the university
suspended him for 30 days with pay, said Victor M. Glasberg,
Hatfill's attorney.</LD>
<TE>   Hatfill, who had access to anthrax spores similar to those mailed
last fall, took an FBI polygraph test in February, invited the FBI to
search his apartment in June and had offered to meet with
investigators again this week, Glasberg said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Reveals Huge INS Backlog of Paperwork</HD>
<DH>Immigration: The cache means some foreigners may have been
deported wrongly, critics say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>More than 2 million documents filed by foreigners, from change of
address forms to requests for benefits, have been piling up for years
and only now are being reviewed by the government, senior U.S.
officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Immigrant advocates say that means some foreigners deported in
secret after Sept. 11 might have been in compliance with laws they
were expelled for breaking.</LD>
<LD>   The government had not revealed the extent to which it had fallen
behind in processing such records. Congressional investigators began
an inquiry into the question after the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The documents have been collected by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service from field offices across the nation and sent
to a warehouse complex outside Kansas City, Mo. They include 200,000
change of address notices, INS spokesman Bill Strassberger said.</TE>
<TE>   Failure to file a change of address form is a deportable offense,
and the Justice Department recently said it would step up
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Strassberger said the 2 million documents also include
applications for benefits. Another U.S. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said more than 300,000 were applications for
citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   "The field offices weren't sure what to do with all of the
documents they had not been able to look through, and they were a bit
overwhelmed by the unprecedented growth [in immigration],"
Strassberger said.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is, we were a backwater agency 10 years ago.
Throughout the 1990s, immigration became a very political issue and
has become even more sensitive since Sept. 11. The records represent
the way the agency used to be run."</TE>
<TE>   The INS expects to have processed most of the documents by
December.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration experts and civil rights groups said the situation is
an affront to foreigners who have tried to play by the rules.</TE>
<TE>   "It exposes one of the INS' dirty secrets," said Lucas Guttentag,
director of the American Civil Liberties Union's immigration rights
project. "The agency's own record-keeping and information systems are
completely inadequate, yet it so often turns around and punishes
law-abiding immigrants when the agency's own shoddy record-keeping is
at fault."</TE>
<TE>   Said immigration attorney William Bernstein: "It's outrageous. It
at least raises the possibility that there could be innocent people
who were deported on bogus charges."</TE>
<TE>   The INS has been under intense criticism since Sept. 11, when huge
gaps in its tracking of foreign visitors and immigrants were
revealed. Several embarrassing incidents have motivated a chorus of
critics in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   In one example, notice of previously approved visa extensions for
two of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers killed during the crimes was mailed
months after the attacks.</TE>

<HD>Bush Will Visit 3 Crash Sites to Mark Sept. 11 Anniversary</HD>
<DH>Memorial: Announcing the president's plans, aides
acknowledge he must walk a political tightrope.</DH>

<DL>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine</DL>
<LD>President Bush will mark the anniversary of Sept. 11 by visiting the
three places where hijacked airplanes crashed that day: the Pentagon,
a field in southwestern Pennsylvania and the World Trade Center site
in New York.</LD>
<LD>   In announcing Bush's plans Friday, White House spokeswoman Claire
Buchan said the trip's aim would be "to continue to rally our nation
and to mourn and to pay respects to the memory of those who lost
their lives and to their families."</LD>
<LD>   The anniversary commemorations will offer Bush a fresh opportunity
to tap into the extraordinary reservoir of goodwill and public
support for him that surged after the terrorist attacks but that
polls show have started to slip.</LD>
<TE>   White House aides also are acutely aware that, with his every move
analyzed in a political context, Bush will need to walk a fine line
in the Sept. 11 commemorations.</TE>
<TE>   "The president will not overdo it," a senior White House official
said. "He'll be very involved in a dignified way that reflects his
personal style. He'll reach out and be seen in a role Americans have
come to appreciate him in, but he will not overdo it.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be elements of commemoration, talk of strength and
unity. It gives us an opportunity to look backward and to look
ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Landon Parvin, a former speechwriter for President Reagan, said of
the challenge facing Bush: "If you don't do enough, you'll get jumped
on; if you do too much, you'll get jumped on. As a citizen, I don't
want to see too much.</TE>
<TE>   "Understated is what's needed: simple, honest, short. That's his
nature."</TE>
<TE>   Buchan announced Bush's plans for Sept. 11 as the president left
Washington for a three-day weekend in Maine at his parents' seaside
compound.</TE>
<TE>   Bush will return to the White House on Monday, after detouring to
Pittsburgh for a Republican fund-raiser, a public speech on homeland
security and a private meeting with the nine coal miners recently
rescued from underground near Somerset, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, he is to undergo his annual physical and sign into law
one of his legislative priorities: a bill granting him increased
power to negotiate trade agreements. He then will fly to his ranch
near Crawford, Texas, and won't return to Washington for the rest of
August.</TE>
<TE>   While vacationing much of the time, Bush is scheduled to visit as
many as 15 cities around the country for policy speeches and
political events during the month. His expected stops include San
Diego and Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 13, he will host a daylong economic conference at Baylor
University in Waco, Texas. The White House has summoned policymakers,
small investors, industry experts, business ethicists, union members,
corporate leaders and business students, among others, to discuss the
economy and highlight the president's economic agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is scheduled to visit Bush at
the ranch, according to the White House. And in late August, Bush is
expected to meet in Texas with Mexican President Vicente Fox.</TE>

<HD>Cheney Panel Ordered to Release Papers</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Friday rejected efforts by the Bush administration to
resist handing over documents related to a White House energy task
force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan approved a public interest law
firm's plan for preliminary fact-finding, which seeks records
relating to the workings of the task force and who it met with.</LD>
<LD>   Sullivan gave the Justice Department 30 days to object to or
comply with the request.</LD>
<TE>   The suit filed by Judicial Watch, and later joined by the
environmental group Sierra Club, seeks all records of the Cheney task
force in an effort to find out what influence energy companies,
including now-bankrupt Enron Corp., had on policy.</TE>
<TE>   The White House points to its right to seek confidential advice in
battling a string of lawsuits and congressional requests for
information on the task force.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department lawyers argued in court Friday that Judicial
Watch had not supplied any evidence that nongovernment employees
participated in the task force. This means it is not subject to the
federal law on advisory committees cited in the lawsuit, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan rejected the arguments. "Under what you are suggesting,
no one can conduct a reasonable investigation ... in an effort to
determine whether the law was complied with," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's task force produced a policy in May 2001 that called for
more oil and gas drilling and a revived nuclear power program.
Environmentalists say they were largely shut out of policymaking.</TE>

<HD>Congress Shines in Short Term</HD>
<DH>Politics: Lawmakers have shown an ability to solve pressing
concerns this summer, but they still struggle with long-term
problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The legislative mood swings came fast and furious on Capitol Hill in
recent weeks.</LD>
<LD>   On some days, Congress moved briskly and in a bipartisan fashion
to pass key legislation in response to the wave of corporate
scandals, the jittery stock market and the promise of greater global
trade.</LD>
<LD>   But on other days, lawmakers found themselves bogged down in
partisan squabbling, incapable of cutting deals to pass prescription
drug benefits or rewrite energy policy.</LD>
<TE>   Through it all, the run-up to Congress' summer recess, which began
Friday for the Senate and a week earlier for the House, was a tribute
to how much the nation's political and economic climate has been
transformed.</TE>
<TE>   Amid signs that voters are increasingly worried about the
direction of the country, the last thing lawmakers wanted was to head
home empty-handed. That drove them in some instances to break
deadlocks and take unexpected turns.</TE>
<TE>   "What really gets people angry is if they're upset and Congress
doesn't get it, isn't doing anything," said Bill McInturff, a
Republican pollster. "Incumbents have to demonstrate, 'We're angry
too, and we are doing what it takes to fix the problem and improve
the economy.' "</TE>
<TE>   But the impulse to deliver has not consistently triumphed over
Congress' instinct for impasse. While a landmark corporate reform
bill breezed through Congress, hopes of passing the prescription drug
benefits for the elderly collapsed, as did a patients' bill of
rights.</TE>
<TE>   A long-stalled bill giving the president increased authority to
negotiate trade pacts was finally approved, but a long-sought measure
to rewrite bankruptcy laws snagged just as it seemed destined to
pass.</TE>
<TE>   Legislation to reorganize homeland security programs and create a
Cabinet post was assembled with remarkable speed, only to founder on
the contentious issue of workers' rights.</TE>
<TE>   This mixed legislative record underscores an enduring truth about
how Congress works, especially when it is narrowly divided between
the parties. Lawmakers manage reasonably well to respond to
short-term crises or pressing public concerns, such as the clamor to
crack down on corporate corruption, when public opinion speaks in a
strong, clear voice. It is less well-equipped to take the lead on
solving long-term problems, such as the future of Medicare and Social
Security, about which the public is more ambivalent.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not very good at long-term planning," said Charles Jones, a
retired professor of government at the University of Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush was upbeat Friday as he commented on recent
congressional action; he praised lawmakers for "a month of
accomplishment."</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving for a weekend at his parents' seaside compound in
Maine, Bush signed a supplemental appropriation bill he sought that
contains new funds for the war on terrorism. On Tuesday, he plans to
sign the trade authority bill that cleared Congress this week.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes to show that when we put our partisanship aside, when
people stop all the yelling and hollering and finger-pointing and
say, 'How can we help the American people?' we can get a lot done in
this town," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   When Congress reconvenes in early September, lawmakers will be
eager to wrap up work as quickly as possible so they can focus on the
midterm elections in which control of the House and Senate are at
stake. But a crushing workload remains.</TE>
<TE>   A potentially protracted debate looms over several issues when the
Senate takes up legislation to create a Department of Homeland
Security. One major dispute is the administration's push for greater
leeway in hiring and firing the agency's employees.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate scandals will continue to attract lawmakers' attention,
with both parties hoping agreement can be reached on legislation to
establish new protections for people who invest in 401(k) retirement
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The House and Senate are way behind on spending bills that must be
passed before Congress can adjourn. The debates on these bills will
test Bush's commitment to curb Congress' election-year spending
appetite.</TE>
<TE>   All this will play out against a backdrop of vast uncertainty
about the economy and the shifting political winds. No one knows how
the tempestuous stock market will be behaving by the time Congress
returns after Labor Day, let alone on election day.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, lawmakers will be probing the mood of voters as
they tour their states and districts during the August recess. If
McInturff's polls are any indication, they will find many of their
constituents are surly--suddenly feeling less optimistic about the
direction of the economy and less kindly toward reelecting
incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gone through an extraordinary month in which the country's
mood has turned from optimistic to pessimistic, with the revelations
of corporate scandals, the stock market [swings] and growing economic
insecurity," said Thomas Mann, an expert on Congress at the Brookings
Institution think tank.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, voters may be less patient with the traditional
excuses for why it takes Capitol Hill so long to act on legislation.
With that in mind, Republicans plan to spend much of the recess
blaming the Democratic-controlled Senate for killing or delaying
major legislation passed by the GOP-controlled House.</TE>
<TE>   "The Senate is the killing field of American politics," said Sen.
Peter Fitzgerald (R-Ill.).</TE>
<TE>   Democrats plan to respond that the bills passed by the House are
flawed. An example will be the House version of legislation to
protect 401(k) accounts, which Senate Democrats say is too weak.</TE>
<TE>   Rhetoric aside, the outlook remains bright that this will be
anything but a do-nothing Congress. The last few weeks already have
significantly added to its legislative legacy.</TE>
<TE>   The trade authority bill has been eight years in the making. It
reinstates presidential power that lapsed in 1994, giving Bush the
ability to negotiate international trade agreements with little
interference from Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation to crack down on corporate corruption that Bush
signed into law this week includes the most far-reaching business
reforms since the Great Depression.</TE>
<TE>   And the proposed Homeland Security Department, which has been
slowed but almost assuredly will not be stopped in the Senate, will
result in the biggest reorganization of the federal government in
half a century.</TE>
<TE>   Notably, the issues that are moving smartly through Congress are
not the ones that a year ago seemed hot.</TE>
<TE>   The patients' bill of rights was the priority for Democrats when
they took control of the Senate in mid-2001. The House and Senate
passed versions of the bill, but negotiations on a compromise
collapsed this week.</TE>
<TE>   Energy legislation was catapulted to the top of the agenda last
year by California's rolling blackouts. But now that the sense of
crisis has waned, the energy legislation Congress is trying to cobble
together likely will produce only marginal policy change.</TE>
<TE>   The drive to provide prescription drug coverage under Medicare,
once thought to be a major issue in this year's election, effectively
died in the Senate this week. In many campaigns, it now is
overshadowed by economic issues.</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers hope the prescription drug debate can be revived in
September, especially if senators get an earful at home from elderly
voters.</TE>
<TE>   But the issue will be competing with a host of other items of
unfinished business when Congress returns. As White House Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer put it recently, "You don't have to be a
helicopter pilot to know that Congress is heading for a giant traffic
jam."</TE>

<TE>   Hits and Misses</TE>
<TE>   This legislative session has seen Congress take action on a number
of key issues, including:</TE>
<TE>   Corporate reform. A law will stiffen penalties for white-collar
crime as well as make sweeping changes to corporate governance.</TE>
<TE>   Trade. The president's authority to negotiate trade pacts has been
increased.</TE>

<HD>Harris' Candidacy Is Considered Secure Despite Misstep</HD>
<DH>Florida: She admits she erred by not formally resigning as
secretary of state, as is required to run for Congress. But political
experts doubt that will derail her bid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Even in the manner and timing of her exit as Florida's secretary of
state, Katherine Harris has become mired in controversy. But her
admitted blunder will have little effect on her bid for Congress,
political experts said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Harris, who issued the controversial decision handing Florida's
electoral votes in the 2000 presidential election to fellow
Republican George W. Bush, is running for the U.S. House seat in a
traditionally Republican patch of Florida's Gulf Coast. She resigned
her state position abruptly Thursday, saying she had misunderstood
the very election laws she was supposed to administer.</LD>
<LD>   "I should have read the law. I didn't. I take full
responsibility," she told reporters at a tumultuous news conference
in Tallahassee.</LD>
<TE>   Harris said she erred by not tendering the formal resignation
required of all state officeholders who seek federal office. It was
another zany twist in the political career of the 45-year-old
granddaughter of one of Florida's wealthiest citrus and cattle
barons.</TE>
<TE>   "This is political theater of the absurd," said Larry Sabato, a
professor of government at the University of Virginia who is a
well-known commentator on U.S. politics. "She is in charge of
administering the election law, and she didn't understand the law
that she was administering. It's that simple, really."</TE>
<TE>   Florida Democrats seized on Harris' mistake, calling it proof that
the official who always insisted she was enforcing the letter of the
law was hardly so punctilious or evenhanded. "She obviously doesn't
know election law, which is one of the weightiest responsibilities of
her office," said Bob Poe, chairman of the Florida Democratic Party.
"She fails to execute her responsibilities properly. She can't even
resign properly."</TE>
<TE>   But supporters say the resignation flap will leave no scar.</TE>
<TE>   "She's been so attacked by Democrats and vilified by her opponents
in the last two years," said Al Cardenas, chairman of the state's
Republican Party. "It's had no effect, and in fact, rank-and-file
voters are so accustomed to it that it's almost like she's built up a
firewall against such attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Harris has been considered a shoo-in in the heavily Republican
13th Congressional District around Sarasota on Florida's middle Gulf
Coast, where she faces only one rival, a former television anchor, in
the Sept. 10 primary. Four little-known Democrats are running in
their party's primary.</TE>
<TE>   The incumbent, Republican Dan Miller, is not seeking reelection.
"She's still heavily favored in the district," Sabato said.</TE>
<TE>   James Witt, professor of government at the University of West
Florida in Pensacola, agreed that, despite the latest controversy,
Harris should win the November election handily.</TE>
<TE>   Harris backdated her resignation as secretary of state to July 15
but confusingly began referring to herself as "de facto" occupant of
the job as well. Officials in the governor's office said Thursday
that she would remain in her job until a replacement was named.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday, Gov. Jeb Bush, the president's brother, appointed a
temporary successor who would remain in the post until it is
eliminated in January, part of the reorganization of state government
approved by Florida voters in 1998. Bush selected Jim Smith, a former
secretary of state who has been working as a lawyer and lobbyist in
Tallahassee, to oversee the state's first statewide elections since
the 2000 recount.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters Thursday, Harris at one point said she
hadn't known the law obliged her to resign because the job that she
holds is scheduled to disappear.</TE>
<TE>   When reporters started pressing her about whether the official
actions she took in the two weeks covered by her backdated
resignation letter were legal, aides hurriedly bundled Harris out of
the room.</TE>
<TE>   Counterattacking, Republicans charged that another member of
Florida's Cabinet, Democratic Atty. Gen. Bob Butterworth, had not
resigned as also mandated by law before qualifying as a candidate for
state Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "She [Harris] faced a similar set of circumstances but at least
had the common sense to step up to the podium and admit her mistake,"
Cardenas said.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Friday, Harris appeared to be applying the adage of
practical politics that when you have lemons you should make
lemonade.</TE>
<TE>   "Just as I applied the law faithfully in cases that involved the
interests of other persons, I have applied the law faithfully at
political cost to myself," Harris said. "To me, at least, a
significant test of leadership is having the character to apply the
same rules to yourself that you apply to everyone else, even when it
hurts."</TE>
<TE>   In Sabato's opinion, Harris was such a high-profile player in the
disputed 2000 election recount that most Floridians, and Americans as
a whole, already know what they think of her, notwithstanding the
latest controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "She's the one person you'd expect to know the rules, and this
can't help her image," the professor said. "But nothing will change
her polarizing position. Republicans will always love her, and
Democrats will always hate her. And that will be true to the very end
of her life."</TE>

<HD>West Nile Kills 4, Infects 58 in Louisiana as Outbreak
Spreads</HD>
<DH>Health: Gov. Mike Foster has made a move for federal aid to
combat the mosquitoes that help spread the potentially fatal virus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIANNE HART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The West Nile virus has killed four Louisiana residents and infected
58 others in one of the worst outbreaks of the mosquito-borne disease
in the country, state health officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Mike Foster declared a state of emergency Friday in a move to
get from $3 million to $5 million in federal aid to combat the
outbreak.</LD>
<LD>   "We've never had anything this widespread here," said Charlie
Anderson, Louisiana's West Nile virus coordinator. "We feel like
we're only at the beginning. The virus has established and is
spreading statewide."</LD>
<TE>   In Baton Rouge and New Orleans, dozens of pesticide trucks are
spraying day and night to kill the virus-carrying mosquitoes. Teams
of entomologists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
have descended on St. Tammany Parish, northeast of New Orleans, to
investigate.</TE>
<TE>   "The scary thing is this started so early," said Anderson. "We
ordinarily look at the season beginning in August. There are a whole
lot of unanswered questions."</TE>
<TE>   West Nile virus is carried by migratory birds and spread by
mosquitoes. A dead bird found in Baton Rouge in May was an early sign
that West Nile had spread to Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   Infected humans can develop flu-like symptoms and, in some cases,
encephalitis, a potentially fatal swelling of the brain. The majority
of infected people don't get sick at all, said Anderson</TE>
<TE>   Discovered in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937, the virus
has spread to Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North America. In the
summer of 1999, seven New Yorkers died during the first large
outbreak of the virus in the United States. Since then, West Nile has
killed 22 people in 34 states as far west as South Dakota. Migrating
birds will likely carry the virus to California this year or next,
according to the CDC.</TE>
<TE>   St. Tammany Mosquito Control Director Charles Palmisano said every
acre of the parish is being sprayed with three times the usual amount
of pesticide. "It's not like we have hordes of mosquitoes," said
Palmisano. "In fact, the mosquitoes are very low now. The question
is, how low do we have to get to prevent human involvement?"</TE>
<TE>   Residents have been asked to drain standing water from mosquito
breeding grounds, such as birdbaths and ditches, and to protect
themselves with long sleeves and mosquito repellent.</TE>
<TE>   The realities of a sweltering Louisiana summer are causing some to
rethink that advice.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd put yourself in heat exhaustion with long sleeves in this
weather," said Scott Ricca, co-owner of Clegg's Nursery in Baton
Rouge.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impractical. During the day, even if you're wearing mosquito
repellent, you walk outside and sweat so much it comes off of you
anyway. Mosquitoes are a hard thing to fight against."</TE>
<TE>   One of Ricca's elderly customers was one of the first people
infected with the virus in Baton Rouge. "When you figure as many
mosquitoes as we have, they're a way of life here," he said. "You
keep your fingers crossed that one of them doesn't get you."</TE>
<TE>   The four Louisiana deaths occurred in the southern half of the
state. Most of the elderly victims were weakened by other illnesses
before they developed the virus.</TE>
<TE>   Eight people in Texas and five in Mississippi have contracted
encephalitis, but all survived. As the virus spreads west, birds and
horses are testing positive in the Dakotas, Nebraska and Oklahoma.</TE>

<HD>Short Circuit in Line Cuts Power to 750,000 People in
Texas, N.M.</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EL PASO</DL>
<LD>A power line short-circuited Friday, cutting power to more than
750,000 people in El Paso and several towns in New Mexico and West
Texas, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Power had been restored by late afternoon. The outage affected an
area spanning about 180 miles between Hatch, N.M., and Van Horn,
Texas, said El Paso Electric spokesman Henry Quintana.</LD>
<LD>   The electricity went out about 9:45 a.m. in this city of 500,000
and began returning to some areas within 45 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Public Service Co. of New Mexico was investigating why a
345-kilovolt line that runs between Albuquerque and El Paso
short-circuited.</TE>
<TE>   City hospitals were fully functional during the blackout, but
flights at El Paso International Airport were delayed for hours. The
outage also interrupted telephone service, stranded people in
elevators and knocked El Paso radio and television stations off the
air.</TE>
<TE>   Police had to direct traffic when stoplights failed, but backup
power kept emergency dispatch services working, said El Paso police
Sgt. Al Velarde.</TE>

<HD>Plutonium Said to Be Sent to S. Carolina</HD>
<DH>Shipments: Federal government begins moving nuclear
material from Colorado, official says. Energy Department won't
confirm the report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GREENVILLE, S.C.</DL>
<LD>The federal government has begun shipping tons of weapon-grade
plutonium from Colorado to South Carolina despite a lawsuit by those
who fear that the fuel will be permanently stored in the state,
according to a Colorado lawmaker's office.</LD>
<LD>   Energy Department officials briefed Sen. Wayne Allard (R-Colo.) on
the status of the shipments Friday, said Allard's spokesman, Sean
Conway. He said the department probably would not have confirmed that
the shipments had begun unless they had arrived in South Carolina.</LD>
<LD>   The officials told Allard that final shipments would be scheduled
to leave a former weapon plant in Colorado by the end of 2003,
allowing the site to be turned into a wildlife preserve, Conway said.</LD>
<TE>   Energy Department spokesman Joe Davis would not confirm the status
of the shipments.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't comment specifically on the dates, times or schedules,
nor can I comment on whether they have begun or whether they arrived
in South Carolina," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The material has been the subject of a showdown between Gov. Jim
Hodges and the Energy Department. Hodges once vowed to use state
troopers to turn back the shipments unless given assurances that
South Carolina would not be a permanent home for the plutonium.</TE>
<TE>   Hodges fought the shipments for more than a year, holding highway
roadblock exercises and promising to lie in front of trucks to keep
the shipments from crossing the state line.</TE>
<TE>   He lost a federal court fight to block the shipments and was
rebuffed by a federal judge when he tried to ban shipments from the
state after the ruling. He is waiting for a U.S. 4th Circuit Court of
Appeals decision on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's bad for South Carolina," he said Thursday. "We're
going to keep fighting."</TE>
<TE>   The Energy Department plans to spend $4 billion on a facility that
would convert 34 metric tons of surplus weapon-grade plutonium into
fuel that can be used in nuclear power plants as part of a
disarmament treaty with Russia.</TE>

<HD>Repairs Will Ground Shuttle Fleet Until at Least Sept. 28</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>NASA will begin repairs to cracked fuel lines on its grounded fleet
of space shuttles next week and may be able to launch a mission as
early as Sept. 28, the U.S. space agency said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   But the wait will be even longer for Israel's first astronaut,
Ilan Ramon, who had been scheduled for a 16-day science mission in
mid-July along with six U.S. astronauts on the shuttle Columbia.</LD>
<LD>   Because two missions to the international space station have been
given priority, Ramon's flight will not lift off before Nov. 29, and
it could launch as late as January, NASA said.</LD>
<TE>   The four shuttles in the U.S. fleet have been confined to hangars
since late June, when the first tiny cracks were discovered in fuel
lines that deliver highly explosive liquid hydrogen to the engines.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the 12 cracks found so far, which are so small they
cannot be seen in detail without magnifying them about 100 times,
remains a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not at the point yet where we've determined the root
cause," shuttle program manager Ron Dittemore said at a news
briefing.</TE>
<TE>   Dittemore said a combination of welding and polishing should make
the stamped metal fuel lines stronger than when they were new, and
NASA should not have to worry about more cracks for at least three to
five years.</TE>
<TE>   NASA considered, but ultimately rejected, continuing to fly the
shuttles without repairing the cracks.</TE>
<TE>   In all likelihood, the cracks had been there for years, since
shortly after each shuttle went into service, NASA officials said.
The oldest, Columbia, first flew in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   The fissures are not growing at all or are growing very slowly,
and they have not threatened astronauts on past missions, Dittemore
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at great length at flying [with the cracks], but in the
end determined there were too many unknowns associated with that," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Dittemore had high praise for the technician who spotted the
cracks, David Straight. "With this particular finding, he's a star
and deserves a medal."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Police Officer Is Wounded During Standoff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MANSFIELD, Ohio</DL>
<LD>A recently fired police officer suspected of killing his wife led
authorities on a chase Friday in a stolen sheriff's vehicle and was
critically wounded during a standoff, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Hermando Harton carried two guns as he ran from the sport-utility
vehicle into a wooded highway median, where officers shot him, said
Lt. Gary Lewis of the State Highway Patrol.</LD>
<LD>   Harton was in critical condition Friday at MetroHealth Medical
Center in Cleveland. He was shot twice.</LD>
<TE>   On July 8, Harton, 39, was fired as a Columbus police officer. He
had faced a disciplinary hearing after he shot and wounded a
passenger in the van of a fleeing shoplifting suspect while off-duty
and working a security job, said Antone Lanata, acting police chief.</TE>
<TE>   Early Friday, Harton called his former wife in California and told
her he had shot his current wife, Elizabeth Harton, 27, said Franklin
County Sheriff Jim Karnes.</TE>
<TE>   The ex-wife alerted police, who found Elizabeth Harton dead in the
couple's Columbus home. A few minutes later, authorities received a
call that an armed man was in a truck stop 45 miles to the north.</TE>
<TE>   "He came out with a gun in each hand and started shooting,"
Sheriff Tom Harden said.</TE>
<TE>   Officers did not fire back, he said. Hermando Harton abandoned his
vehicle with four children inside and drove off in the sheriff's SUV,
which had the keys inside, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Officers chased him, and the pursuit ended about 30 miles away,
near Mansfield, when state troopers put spikes down on Interstate 71
and stopped the SUV.</TE>
<TE>   Harton jumped from the stolen vehicle and ran into the wooded
median. He was shot shortly after.</TE>
<TE>   The four children he left behind at the truck stop were in state
custody, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Harton had filed for divorce in 2000 but dropped the
case a month later. Several weeks ago, Hermando Harton talked about
filing for divorce, said his attorney, John Waddy.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Harton had entered the police academy the day before her
husband was fired. Flags were at half-staff for her Friday at the
downtown police headquarters in Columbus.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Authorities were pursuing murder charges Friday against seven gang
members in the beating deaths of two men who were dragged from a van
after the vehicle jumped a curb and plowed into three people.</LD>
<LD>   Chief of Detectives Phil Cline said the suspects, ages 16 to 57,
were identified by witnesses who came forward after community leaders
went door-to-door urging cooperation with investigators. The suspects
were in custody Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Police said they were seeking first-degree murder charges and had
turned the case over to the Cook County state's attorney's office. A
spokesman for the office said the case was under review.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said two of the suspects were relatives of one of the
women struck by the van. Names of the suspects, all of whom have
criminal backgrounds, won't be released until charges are filed,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very satisfied that we have a strong case here," Cline
said. He added that fingerprints from two suspects were found on the
van.</TE>
<TE>   Police Supt. Terry Hillard praised residents who agreed to help in
the investigation. "Numerous and courageous individuals from that
neighborhood have shown they have the strength and character to do
what's right."</TE>
<TE>   At least 100 people watched as Anthony Stuckey, 49, and Jack
Moore, 62, were kicked and beaten with bricks and stones by an angry
mob Tuesday night, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   Moore, the van's driver, was legally drunk when the accident
occurred, police said. Both men lived in the close-knit neighborhood
on the city's south side.</TE>
<TE>   Community activists organized the door-to-door canvass Thursday
for witnesses. They also put fliers on cars that declared: "We need
your help!! We need witnesses to contact police (confidentially) to
help catch the murderers of Anthony Stuckey and Jack Moore."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the three people struck by the van remained hospitalized
Friday, one in critical condition.</TE>

<HD>Judge Orders Drugs for Capitol Murder Suspect</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The mentally disturbed man accused of shooting two Capitol Police
officers will continue to be forced to take anti-psychotic medication
in an effort to make him competent to stand trial, a federal judge
ruled Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In a U.S. District Court hearing, Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled that
Russell Weston had shown such improvement after six months of the
medication that he might eventually understand the double murder
charges against him.</LD>
<LD>   "The court is persuaded by clear and convincing evidence that the
defendant's mental state is improving," Sullivan said, citing a
psychiatrist's testimony on Thursday as the basis for his ruling.
"There is a substantial probability that he might be ready to stand
trial in the foreseeable future."</LD>
<TE>   Sullivan then granted the prosecution's request that the
medication be extended for 120 days, when he will again review
Weston's mental state. Weston's psychiatrist, Sally Johnson,
testified Thursday that it might take 18 more months for Weston to
become fully competent.</TE>
<TE>   Weston's attorneys, the District of Columbia's federal public
defender A.J. Kramer and assistant public defender Gregory Poe,
declined comment after the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Weston is charged with the July 24, 1998, slaying of Capitol
Police officers John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut in a shootout in the
Capitol building. Weston, 45, who had been living in Montana and had
a long history of mental problems, is charged with bursting into the
building with a revolver, claiming he needed to retrieve a hidden
satellite system that could reverse time.</TE>
<TE>   He was shot through the arm in a gun battle and taken into
custody.</TE>
<TE>   In the ensuing four years, his case has become a precedent-setting
test of the government's right to order mentally disturbed criminal
defendants to take mind-altering medication.</TE>
<TE>   Weston's attorneys have argued that it is not ethical to force him
to take medication that might result in his standing trial and facing
the death penalty. Without the medicine, psychiatrists have testified
that there is little or no chance Weston would ever be deemed
competent. Prosecutors have argued that this can be remedied by
ordering Weston to take antipsychotic drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan ordered him to begin taking the medication in January.
Johnson, the psychiatrist at the federal prison in Butner, N.C.,
where Weston is being held, has testified that Weston does not object
to taking the medication when it is offered to him.</TE>
<TE>   But, she noted, Weston still has no real sense of the case against
him, suffers from paranoid delusions and thinks that the judge, along
with most attorneys in the case, are actually escaped prison inmates
who will shortly be arrested.</TE>

<HD>Put Children's Health Care First</HD>
<DH>Don't place profits ahead of our kids' well-being.</DH>

<AU>RONNIE I. COHEN</AU>
<BD>Ronald I. Cohen teaches English at Palisades Charter
High School and Los Angeles Valley College.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been an eventful year in our family. Our son completed his
first year of kindergarten. He showed signs of artistic talent, began
to read, was accepted into a high-ability magnet school, began seeing
a psychologist and began taking medication for attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder.</LD>
<LD>   Likewise, I have spent the year wrangling with people on the
telephone, becoming a near expert in HMO-speak and worrying about
authorizations for treatment. I recently footed the bill for a doctor
who looked my wife in the eye and refused to see my son unless she
wrote him a check. The good doctor said the health maintenance
organization wasn't paying him and urged me to pester them about
getting him his money.</LD>
<LD>   Profits, not people, are the bottom line.</LD>
<TE>   More than a year ago, our son's preschool teacher told us that she
was concerned about his inability to follow directions and keep his
hands to himself. He had no friends. When our son began kindergarten,
his teachers made note of "troublesome behaviors," which included
"rocking, crawling, spinning, chewing on his clothing or pulling on
his cheeks." They also mentioned an acute sensitivity to "typical
classroom noise."</TE>
<TE>   While not wanting to overreact to my son's "unorthodox behavior"
at school, I also was determined to intervene as early as possible.
Following my HMO's procedures, I obtained a referral to a specialist,
a pediatric neurologist.</TE>
<TE>   The procedure went as follows: Visit the neurologist for about
five minutes, have him prescribe a sedative used for children with
ADHD and then tell us he wanted to see our child for a follow-up in
about eight weeks to check the effect of the medication. Simple
enough, but the doctor's secretary said she couldn't make an
appointment for us until we received authorization for another visit.</TE>
<TE>   And when would this authorization come? This was out of our
control. In fact, seeing a specialist often demands a relentlessness
in the face of unreturned phone calls, long waits on the telephone
and customer service employees who spout policy and little else.
Would that President Bush had to gain authorization before having his
colon checked.</TE>
<TE>   And what is this magical word, "authorization"? In our case, it
meant that another doctor, who had never met our child, who was not
experienced with treating ADHD, who did not even work with children,
decreed that our son's problem was behavioral and not neurological.
(Even a cursory reading of the serious literature on ADHD will refer
to a neurological basis for the condition.)</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, our doctor, unbeknownst to us, threatened to terminate
his contract with our provider, leaving our son to go elsewhere.
Where? That wasn't his problem.</TE>
<TE>   So whose problem is it when the system fails a child? Is "fails"
too strong a word? After all, ours is not a life-or-death situation.
Tens of millions of Americans remain uninsured, whereas, for basic
health care, the HMO system generally is working for our family.</TE>
<TE>   After numerous discussions with our health group, a psychiatrist,
instead of a neurologist, will prescribe medication for our son.
Still, many parents have neither the time nor the money nor the
education to seek specialized help for their children. As a result of
this, many children reach high school with undiagnosed learning
disabilities, nearly illiterate and unable to control their speech or
behavior. Against a backdrop of corporate scandal, we, as a society,
will ultimately pay the price for putting health-care profits ahead
of our children's well-being.</TE>

<HD>Barrio Action Expands Its Mission to Help Youth</HD>

<LD>In 1977, Sister Emmanuel Barragan started Barrio Action, hoping to
help gang members in the El Sereno community learn to read and write.
Twenty-five years later, Barrio Action Youth &amp; Family Center, still
active but with an expanded mission, is serving El Sereno families
and helping young people graduate from high school.</LD>
<LD>   RITA LUTHER recently spoke with the program's director.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   TAMMY MEMBRENO</TE>
<TE>   Executive director, Barrio Action Youth &amp; Family Center</TE>
<TE>   We work with at-risk youth who, for various reasons, are not able
to complete their high school education in the regular school system.
With the Los Angeles Unified School District, we worked to develop a
curriculum to allow these kids to do the course work and graduate
from high school.</TE>
<TE>   Students are referred to us in several ways. The schools recommend
them because of failing grades or discipline problems, or a probation
officer will send them. In some cases, kids ask to be in the program
because they are having trouble academically and they know they will
receive more one-on-one instruction and counseling.</TE>
<TE>   We differ from regular high schools in several ways. Our class
sizes are very small, which allows more individual attention and
interaction with each student. Also, we work with the entire family.
In order to be in the program, a kid's parents have to commit to be
involved, attend parenting classes and participate in family
counseling. This last month there have been four homicides involving
kids in our community. We want to do whatever we can to keep these
kids off the street.</TE>
<TE>   Recently we hired two case managers who counsel the students. We
work with the elementary and middle schools to identify potential
at-risk kids in the fourth and fifth grades and invite them to
participate in our tutoring classes before school becomes a problem
for them.</TE>
<TE>   El Sereno is somewhat isolated from other parts of East Los
Angeles. We see these kids on the street, in the stores, and we know
who they are, who their parents are, and in that way we are like a
small town. We know we have the respect of many in the community
because we have never been broken into, never had our walls tagged.
None of our staff has felt threatened by any kind of violence.</TE>
<TE>   I interact with various departments in City Hall. Recently I was
attending a meeting in City Hall and, as I walked into an office, a
young lady called out to me. She was a former gang member and student
of ours who had completed our program, graduated from high school,
had received a degree in computer science and was now working for the
city.</TE>
<TE>   We've had plenty of success stories, and we love these. But we've
had our share of failures. We have lost students to gang violence.
Recently one of our students was killed because he won a dance
contest. Some of the kids are second- or third-generation gang
members, and the influences on them are too strong in the wrong
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Barrio Action is building a new, 30,000-square-foot community
center that will be completed in about a year. We will be offering
many more services to the community, including a computer lab, dance
studio, digital music room and full indoor basketball court. We see a
bright future for Barrio Action and look forward to continuing and
expanding our programs.</TE>

<HD>Jesuit Exercises Help Writer Tackle Moral Quandaries Large
and Small</HD>
<DH>THIRTY DAYS: On Retreat With the Exercises of St. Ignatius;
By Paul Mariani; Viking Compass: 288 pp., $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Spiritual exercise" is the phrase that Ignatius of Loyola, founder
of the Jesuits, used to describe the course of silent prayer and
meditation that he prescribed for his followers--"[a] means of
preparing and disposing our soul to rid itself of all its disordered
affections and then, after their removal, of seeking and finding
God's will." Nearly 500 years later, the spiritual exercises of St.
Ignatius are still the source of inspiration for some earnest
seekers, among them Paul Mariani, a poet, biographer and literary
critic who describes his own participation in a 30-day Jesuit retreat
in rich and evocative detail--day by day, sometimes hour by hour--in
"Thirty Days: On Retreat with the Exercises of St. Ignatius."</LD>
<TE>   "Walks along the Atlantic, three squares a day, heat, a roof over
one's head, a room of one's own," writes Mariani in anticipation of
his arrival at the Gonzaga Retreat House on a bleak stretch of the
New England coast. "Plus a spiritual director for the care and
feeding of the soul. All this for $30 a day, plus my undivided
attention." Mariani can joke about the retreat, thus avoiding the sin
of sanctimony, but he also declares himself to be a man in acute
spiritual need. He alludes to an earlier moral crisis, one that
confronted him with "an election to make: leave my wife and family
(and commit spiritual suicide) or learn how to behave." Both he and
his marriage survived, thanks to an eight-day retreat 15 years
before. He is submitting to the 30-day version--spent mostly in
silence--of prayer, meditation, counseling and communal meals to
address his latest set of moral and spiritual concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "I need this time," confesses Mariani, "as the Psalmist says, as
much as the thirsty deer that pants for water."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Mariani's concerns are mundane, as when he muses over his
middle-age spread: "Clouds half-hiding the risen sun as I went down
to breakfast, resolved to eat more sparingly, as Ignatius suggests,"
he writes. "... But the box of cereal being 'almost' empty, I decided
to empty it, for the thousandth time smashing my resolve as I sat
there with a bowl of cereal that kept multiplying like the loaves and
fishes. And how, at this rate, will I ever achieve my 25-year-old
svelte shape again?" Other agonies reflect the more lurid aspects of
human carnality. Awakening in his "cell" at 4 a.m., he is plagued
with "erotic images" that he ascribes to the "Evil One, Lucifer,
hiding behind his puppet theater, manipulating his glitzy,
tinsel-strewn sex puppets." Later, Mariani is "stunned" to find that
Ignatius was familiar with the diabolical ploy and recommended
confession as the best defense.</TE>
<TE>   Now and then, Mariani pauses to ponder how the thread of evil runs
from biblical antiquity to our own benighted era: "Babi Yar, Nigeria,
Somalia, Chechnya, Shanghai under the Japanese occupation, Antietam,
the Wilderness, Little Bighorn, Wounded Knee ... Dresden, Nagasaki,
Hiroshima, Columbine." He revisits the poetry of Gerard Manley
Hopkins and the psalms of David, Dante's "Inferno" and Edvard Munch's
"The Scream." And he pauses to share what he has learned about
Ignatius and the Jesuits.</TE>
<TE>   Mariani is blessed with moments of epiphany and even ecstasy. A
walk on the beach--"one might spend an eternity praising this
delicious craftsman who had made all this"--prompts him to fall to
his knees in prayer.</TE>
<TE>   But Mariani always returns to the struggle with his own "moral
entropy," and he seems to concede that even St. Ignatius is not
always successful in his crusade to redeem men and women.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as I admire this tough, little Basque, there's something
about Ignatius's intensity that threatens to overwhelm me," he sums
up at one point.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is I am afraid, afraid that I will not be able to say
yes when the time comes, yes to the necessary sacrifice of my own
will for something larger and greater, a yes that might allow me to
break out of my own self-imposed limitations and reach for something
greater."</TE>

<HD>Disputes Over Ten Commandments Grow More Intense</HD>
<DH>Law: More and more lawsuits challenge the posting of the
biblical code at schools, city halls and other public sites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Religion News Service</BD>
<DL>WEST UNION, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Amid the rolling hills of rural southwest Ohio, four high schools
display identical sets of five monuments placed neatly in front of
their new buildings.</LD>
<LD>   The tombstone-like monuments highlight historic legal documents,
such as the Declaration of Independence and the Magna Carta.</LD>
<LD>   But the monument in the center, with the Ten Commandments etched
in granite, is the one that has caused controversy. School officials
say the monuments--donated by a private group of ministers and lay
people--belong there and have appealed a June District Court decision
declaring their presence unconstitutional.</LD>
<TE>   "Our belief is that the monuments are there not primarily as a
religious statement, but as a historical reminder of our system of
law and government in the United States and to show that it has very
deep-seated roots in biblical times," said Roy Hill, outgoing
superintendent of the Adams County/Ohio Valley School District.</TE>
<TE>   The Ohio chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union disagrees,
and sued on behalf of a community activist who lives in the area and
is offended by the monuments.</TE>
<TE>   "They're undeniably religious," said Raymond Vasvari, legal
director of the ACLU chapter. "They are sacred texts to believing
Christians and believing Jews. They are not theological 'Hints from
Heloise.' They are supposed to be the revealed word of God."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, about a dozen legal cases were working their way
through the courts regarding the posting of the Ten Commandments on
public property--schools and parks, even city halls. Now the number
has risen to about 20, legal experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be that both sides are getting more aggressive about
litigation," said Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University
of Texas in Austin. "You're not going to get a national consensus on
this."</TE>
<TE>   He said legal uncertainty lingers because the one Supreme Court
decision addressing the matter, Stone vs. Graham in 1980, dealt
specifically with public schools. It declared unconstitutional a
Kentucky law that required the commandments be posted in classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Another catalyst for the lawsuits, Laycock said, was publicity
about Chief Justice Roy Moore of Alabama's Supreme Court, who gained
wide attention for putting the Ten Commandments in his courtroom when
he was a circuit court judge.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Moore has drawn headlines--and a lawsuit--for
placing a 2 1/2-ton Ten Commandments monument in the lobby of the
state judicial building.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Ken Johnson, who founded Adams County for the Ten
Commandments, said of Moore: "He's my hero."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, along with other pro-commandments activists in Ohio,
Kentucky, Indiana and Tennessee, is forming a network to foster
continued court action to support the posting of the biblical laws in
public places. In his county, Johnson said, the monument sends a
"signal" to students, teachers and community members.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted them for just a good moral code to show respect for God
and respect toward men," said Johnson, who is pastor of a United
Methodist church in nearby Seaman.</TE>
<TE>   Vasvari praises recent decisions against such monuments in the
same states where Johnson and other leaders are working to keep them
up.</TE>
<TE>   "It does say something when you have ... nine district courts, in
rapid succession in a variety of circumstances, handing down the same
ruling," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Recent defeats in court have not dissuaded monument supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Manion, senior counsel for the American Center for Law and
Justice, is defending the Adams County school district and has urged
its leaders to add the four most recent monuments to possibly bolster
their case.</TE>
<TE>   He's also representing commandment supporters in eight other
cases, including Judge James DeWeese of Richland County, Ohio, who
has appealed a district court decision in hopes of keeping a poster
of the commandments in a gilded frame on the wall of his courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Manion said judges' recent rulings simultaneously recognize the
biblical laws as "an important historical factor" while rejecting
their particular placement in public venues.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is, how do you find out until you get sued and go
through the whole legal process whether your context is appropriate?"</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the confusion, he said, are conflicting decisions by
appellate courts.</TE>
<TE>   "The same monument is illegal in Elkhart [Ind.] and Indianapolis,
but it's legal in Denver and Salt Lake City under the same provision
of the Constitution," Manion said.</TE>
<TE>   On the basis of recent court decisions, some of the monuments have
come down. At least one, in Chester County, Pa., which dated to the
early 1900s, was recently covered up, pending appeals.</TE>
<TE>   One of the newer court cases covers a LaCrosse, Wis., monument
donated to the city by a fraternal organization in the 1960s and
placed in a park.</TE>
<TE>   Marty Kurian, manager of LaCrosse Aerie 1254 of the Fraternal
Order of Eagles, said his organization had donated the monument in
honor of local residents after their sand-bagging efforts during a
serious flood.</TE>
<TE>   But a suit filed July 1 by the Freedom from Religion Foundation
prompted the City Council to vote about a week later to sell the
property to that fraternal group.</TE>
<TE>   The first commandment alone--"Thou shalt have no other gods before
me"--is what prompted the lawsuit, said Anne Gaylor, president of the
Madison, Wis.-based foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "In our country, we are free to have any god we like, as many as
we like or none at all if that's what we prefer," Gaylor said.
"Government should be neutral in matters of religion, and you are
hardly neutral if you are telling the community to worship and which
god to worship."</TE>

<LD>Up and down the Southern California coast last weekend, Boogie
boarders skittered across hurricane-generated waves, cranking bottom
turns, spinning 360s and, inevitably, getting tumbled so hard that
saltwater pounded into their eyes, ears, throats and sinuses.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands went home blissful, adrenaline in their blood. In some
cases, however, that blood may also be breeding viruses, bacteria,
even diseases such as hepatitis.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County alone reported 1,592 beach closures and advisories
in 2001, up from 881 in 2000. Most of the closures stemmed from urban
runoff and sewage carrying bacteria that can cause gastroenteritis,
dysentery and respiratory illness. An annual Natural Resources
Defense Council report showed that last year, beach closures and
advisories (which die-hard ocean addicts often ignore) rose 14% in
California.</LD>
<TE>   But the news isn't as bad as it seems. California is ahead of most
other states in aggressively monitoring beach pollution. In 2001, the
state began drawing samples from 14 additional stretches of coast,
accounting for 124 closings and advisories caused in part by more
rainfall, which flushes filth into the ocean. The additional testing
has led California to discover more pollution, so the public is
better informed and protected.</TE>
<TE>   Stricter controls and cleanup projects also have begun to fix the
pollution problem. The Clean Beaches Initiative, for which Gov. Gray
Davis approved money in 2001, has funded 38 projects, such as storm
drain diversions and filtration. The Los Angeles and San Diego
regional water boards issued tough new Clean Water Act permits, which
require more diligent inspection of industrial sites and education
campaigns for the public. Another regional water board decision
requires developers to treat or filter runoff before it enters the
general storm drain system.</TE>
<TE>   But continued urbanization means more filth and bacteria and much
work to be done to protect Californians and their tourist economy.</TE>
<TE>   Slosh into the water at San Clemente's T-Street beach, the Redondo
Pier or Malibu. Along with Southern California dude-talk, the
surfers, boarders, swimmers and waders speak Japanese, German,
Russian and Persian. They come to taste the sweet, sunny life
mythologized by the Beach Boys--not undertreated waste, pesticides
and oily urban runoff.</TE>

<LD>Almost anywhere you go in the West, there's a push to open up more
land for energy development or for the use of all-terrain vehicles,
snowmobiles and other often damaging and exploitive activities.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government issued a record 3,800 oil and gas permits
last year. Pristine federal lands in jeopardy include the Upper Green
River Basin and the Red Desert in Wyoming, the Rocky Mountain front
in Montana and even the nearby Los Padres National Forest of
California, part of it home to the endangered condor. Federal
agencies also are pushing to drill 51,000 coal-bed methane gas wells
in the Powder River Basin in northeast Wyoming, an operation that
could devastate the region's underground water supply.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, the Bush administration is unraveling the commendable
Bill Clinton initiative to protect millions of acres of national
forest from the construction of more roads, usually built with
federal dollars to provide access to logging areas. There is hope,
however, for reinstating the no-roads rule. Congressional supporters
have written its language into legislation. If it becomes law, as it
should, the administration would have to enforce it.</LD>
<TE>   Separate from the attempt to scrap the no-roads rule is a threat
to the integrity of wild lands from the reopening of old roads. In
Utah, federal and state officials are negotiating the revival of
roads across federal lands built, planned or imagined under an 1866
law designed to promote Western expansion. The measure, referred to
by its statute section, RS 2477, was repealed in 1976. But Congress
left a loophole allowing existing roads built under the 1866 law to
remain.</TE>
<TE>   Now local and state officials, including in Inyo County, Calif.,
are jumping to preserve their ancient "rights." The problem is in
determining what is a real road and what might be merely a livestock
trail. A few seem to exist in the imagination of off-road vehicle
drivers and coal or gold miners. Interior Department officials say
they intend to use common sense, but conservationists are wary
because federal and state officials have conferred on a road plan in
private. Why this secrecy, when a major complaint of the Bush
administration about Clinton initiatives was that local people
weren't well consulted?</TE>
<TE>   In Utah, hundreds of miles of these "roads" penetrate regions that
are under consideration by Congress for protection as wilderness
areas. If the roads are revived, those areas could be disqualified
from wilderness designation.</TE>
<TE>   Roads have their place on public lands. The nation needs
reasonable timber harvests and more energy resources. Vehicle
recreation can make a fine vacation. But a stampede to build every
possible road and extract every energy resource threatens to
overwhelm and degrade some of the best wild lands left.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On the first day of school, many ninth-graders will open their books
to this lesson: "A fat cat sat at a mat." They will be learning how
to read at a time when they should be introduced to Shakespeare.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles school system deserves credit for starting to
re-teach thousands of middle and secondary students to read. But
shame on the district for failing to teach so many children, then
allowing them to keep passing to the next grade.</LD>
<LD>   Some 35,000 of the district's poorest readers in sixth through
ninth grades are or soon will be taking intensive reading classes for
two hours each school day.</LD>
<TE>   This lifeline for poor readers, described in a recent story by
Times staff writer Duke Helfand, will cost the district $16 million
at a time of deep budget cuts. That money, cobbled together from
state and federal funds that could have been spent on other programs,
will pay for teacher training, smaller classes and a highly
structured and systematic basic reading series, similar to one that
works well in the primary grades.</TE>
<TE>   The Language! program, the choice for most students, appears
babyish but is designed to make sure no student misses a basic skill
this time. Teachers will get some training, and district reading
experts hope to augment that with continued coaching. It isn't easy
for teachers to switch from "Moby Dick" to Dick-and-Jane-level texts.</TE>
<TE>   Language! is working successfully in Texas, a front-runner in
getting most children, including poor and minority students and
English-language learners, to grade level. The Sacramento school
district has been using a remedial reading program for older students
for five years and now sends fewer poor readers to high school.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles program will operate on a much larger scale. If it
works, students can expect to read at or above the eighth-grade level
after two to three years, which would allow many of them to pass
California's mandatory high school exit exam and get a decent job.
They also would have the pleasure of reading a newspaper or a menu or
a best-selling novel.</TE>
<TE>   These are needed incentives for students who have to give up
electives like music and art to slog through embarrassingly childish
texts. Progress brings them more interesting reading pretty quickly.
And best of all, they will know that in due time they will be able to
help their own children become good readers long before high school.</TE>

<LD>Re "Betcha Can't Sue Just One," Commentary, July 26: Jonathan Turley,
while admitting that "fast-food businesses are vulnerable to
allegations of misrepresentation, fraud and negligence," nevertheless
makes light of efforts to use legal action against obesity in the
same way my colleagues and I have been so successful in using it
against smoking. But the experts scoffed as well when the first
smoker lawsuits were filed, and we are now routinely winning
multimillion-dollar verdicts.</LD>
<LD>   People made light of a lawsuit my law students helped bring
against McDonald's for failing to disclose the fat content of its
French fries, but a $12.5-million settlement seems to have quieted
the critics and encouraged at least three additional fat-fraud
lawsuits, one of which is also close to settlement.</LD>
<LD>   The fast-food industry is already responding with major attack
ads--and a campaign warning people not to eat too much fast
food--sure signs that it is taking these lawsuits seriously. So
experts, pundits and commentators can scoff all they want; I've heard
it many times before.</LD>

<TE>   I could just kick myself. First, as a teenager, I chose not to
begin smoking cigarettes and missed out on blaming Philip Morris for
lung ailments I might have developed. Then, about 10 years ago, I
gave up fast food and junk food to help ensure good health into
middle age, so I've got no case against Ronald McDonald or Col.
Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   And therein lies the irony. As a trim, fit, 47-year-old turned
vegetarian, how will I ever afford to live to be 100 without a share
of a multibillion-dollar class-action lawsuit? I can only hope that
some crafty scientist will find a deadly toxin in spinach or broccoli
and that I have been unknowingly "greening" myself to an agonizing
death, allowing me to sue the evil agri-corporations and retire
early. Otherwise I'll just have to continue working for a living.</TE>

<LD>Why are so many restaurants in L.A. County still in violation of the
Americans With Disabilities Act provisions? The hardship that a
person in a wheelchair has in having to use a toilet in many
restaurants has become deplorable. The entrance doors are too small
to pass through, the size of the toilet stalls does not accommodate a
wheelchair and the lack of grab bars in the toilets is disturbing.</LD>
<LD>   I suggest that every restaurant owner and manager of a restaurant
sit in a wheelchair and try to manipulate his or her way into the
restroom to experience firsthand the distress that so many are
suffering. A small investment in providing better accommodations
could enhance a restaurant's reputation and future business.</LD>

<LD>Unlike other legal yet potentially addictive, debilitating products
such as alcohol and prescription drugs, no one is sure who's selling
tobacco in California ("Threat to Cigarette Control," editorial, July
27). Requiring a license or permit to sell tobacco products sends
retailers the message that we are serious about protecting children.
The L.A. County Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drug Policy Coalition
worked tirelessly in its support for L.A.'s tobacco enforcement
program. We are proud of the efforts made by the city to curb illegal
sales.</LD>
<LD>   San Fernando and 26 other cities and counties in California also
have a retail licensing ordinance. California should set a standard,
but a local jurisdiction should be able to go beyond any statewide
standard in order to protect its children. Assembly Bill 1666, if
passed, would preempt cities from enforcing their retail licensing
ordinance. This is a tobacco industry goal.</LD>
<LD>   No other legal product sold in America disables and kills the
majority of its lifelong users. Every day in California, 300 children
start smoking. Licensing tobacco retailers is a common-sense solution
to making sure that retailers are accountable for keeping cigarettes
out of your children's hands.</LD>

<LD>Re "Secessionists Invoke the Spirit of '76," July 27: The Declaration
of Independence is our nation's most cherished symbol of liberty. It
was the work of Thomas Jefferson and the other leaders of the 13
colonies. They included John Hancock, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams
and Samuel Adams, all of whom participated in the birth of a nation
and a struggle against tyranny--as a world watched.</LD>
<LD>   Our freedom from taxation without representation was one of the
liberties fought for in the American Revolutionary War. And the San
Fernando Valley, since it first became part of Los Angeles, has been
represented fully in accordance with the laws of this land. I find it
an outrage, to say the least, that the proponents of the misguided
Valley secession effort, in their desperation to find support, are
trying to cloak themselves in the Declaration of Independence. There
is no comparison. Period.</LD>

basic cause for our state's growing ecological and demographic

polluted beaches, you name it, are problems that will not be solved

<HD>D.A.'s Office Disputes Criticism of Arrest</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second time, The Times has editorially rapped the knuckles of
the Los Angeles County district attorney's office for doing its job
("Chill Wind Over Witnesses," editorial, July 16, and "Made-for-Media
Arrests," editorial, July 28). Unfortunately, the facts do not back
up claims made in either editorial as they relate to this office.</LD>
<LD>   You have erroneously taken me and my office to task for arresting
Mitchell Crooks, the cameraman who took the video in the Inglewood
police abuse case. If that was not enough, on July 28 you
implied--again erroneously--that the district attorney's office chose
to "make a spectacle" of the Crooks arrest. You called the decision
"tawdry."</LD>
<LD>   Crooks never offered to turn over his tape to the D.A.'s office so
there could be a speedy and thorough investigation of the Inglewood
case. He said he would be "totally uncooperative," although he later
said he would cooperate if his "record is completely wiped out." To
determine what that record was, we checked and discovered just hours
before locating Crooks in Hollywood on July 11 and serving him with a
grand jury subpoena that he was a fugitive from Placer County and
that a warrant had been issued for his arrest.</LD>
<TE>   Section 142 of the California Penal Code clearly states that if a
law enforcement officer knows an arrest warrant exists, he must make
the arrest or he would be committing a felony. Surely The Times
believes that anyone with evidence of a crime--especially the alleged
beating of a 16-year-old boy by a police officer--should come
forward. Without the original videotape and Crooks' authentication of
it, there very well might not have been a speedy criminal indictment.</TE>

<TE>   Your July 28 editorial hit the nail on the head. Indeed, why
arrest just the Rigas family when we have so many fat cats in the
Enron fiasco? Could it be that the Rigas family is not in the oil
business and is not friends with the Bush family? Where is the
justice and fairness?</TE>

<LD>Why are Bill Simon's tax records still an issue ("Simon Advisors Hope
Worst Is Behind Them," July 29)? His records show he paid a little
more than 30% of his income in taxes. Anybody who thinks that isn't a
"fair share" has seriously impaired judgment. I will go on record
that I have never, ever voted for or against anyone based on a
candidate's tax returns. Not when there are issues far more
substantial and important in this election.</LD>
<LD>   No matter what your strongest priority for state government is,
there will be forced budget cuts, all because Gov. Gray Davis
indulgently overspent this state's budget into a crisis. If you don't
like the fact that class sizes are being increased, you should vote
against Davis. His $24-billion deficit is the main reason why.</LD>

<LD>Re "Did System Fail to Protect Samantha?" July 27: Did I read the
story correctly? In tapes played to the jury when he was charged with
molesting two girls in 1999, Alejandro Avila admitted to touching his
girlfriend's daughter in sensitive areas about a dozen times. This
was when he bathed her, and he said it was not sexual. And the jury
believed it.</LD>
<LD>   Did the prosecutor point out that a 9-year-old does not need to be
bathed by any adult, especially her mother's boyfriend? Was this one
of the secrets the child was told to keep? It is very common for a
child molester known to the family, or who is a family member, to
tell the child that their activity must be kept a secret. Many times
the child is told that the child will get in trouble if he or she
tells or that his or her mother will get hurt. Was the jury told why
children do not disclose? Why they keep secrets?</LD>
<TE>   I have interviewed over 3,500 children who were victims of child
sexual abuse and exploitation. I have also interviewed many adults
who were disclosing for the first time being abused as a child. The
great majority of these victims have said that they were told to keep
it a secret, and they did. Parents should be teaching children that
there should not be secrets between adults and children. Children
should tell if an adult tells them to keep something a secret. This
is one way to prevent or limit sexual abuse. Don't keep secrets.</TE>
<TE>   Would the jury members have convicted Avila if they understood how
sexual predators operate? We don't know. Hopefully, these issues will
be brought to the attention of juries.</TE>

<TE>   The original idea behind the jury system was to have a committee
of clear-minded citizens who would assure fair-mindedness and prevent
the miscarriage of justice. But our jury system today has become just
the opposite. Murderers are freed or convicted by jurors who often
base their decision not on facts but on the charisma or performance
of a lawyer. Plaintiffs are awarded millions of dollars for
self-inflicted illnesses, such as smoking. Pedophiles are acquitted
by juries and go on to kill small children like Samantha Runnion.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's time to have a system similar to the one in France,
where the final decisions are made not by inexpert jurors but by
three judges, all versed in the law, able to understand the charges
and who must agree among themselves about the verdict. Isn't it time
to repair a system that no longer seems to be working?</TE>

<TE>   Re "Bush Declares Suspect in Samantha Case 'the Killer,' " July
27: Apparently President Bush has stumbled on a way to save taxpayers
billions of dollars while freeing up our court system of its onerous
duties. All he needs to do is to declare any person on trial guilty
or not guilty based upon his knowledge of the case. What a great
feeling it would be to know that one would never have to serve jury
duty again.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Reaction Is Swift, but Does It Run Deep?" (Commentary, July 28),
John Balzar modestly apologizes that he's no economics theorist but
then criticizes the president and Congress for not requiring
companies to expense stock options, saying that's only common sense.
It reminds me of a professor who cautioned us to beware of the
argument supported by "common sense" because it's often neither
common nor sense.</LD>
<LD>   It's not really a question of how to price an option, it's more a
question of whether it was really an expense of doing business during
the report period, particularly since there was no cash transaction.
A critical measurement to an investor is the price of the stock per
share. So, when the option is exercised, it increases the number of
outstanding shares and thus reduces the earnings per share.</LD>
<LD>   An exception, but still the rule, is companies like General
Electric that buy back stock when they grant options to maintain the
same number of outstanding shares. But then, their earnings reflect
the cash cost of buying back those shares. Let's be glad that
Congress deferred a politically correct solution that would have had
more unintended consequences.</LD>

<TE>   Balzar was wrong to say that Michael Milken "has become a
philanthropist" only since he "pull[ed] prison time after the last
round of business scandals." Milken's philanthropy began more than a
quarter-century ago and was formalized in 1982 with the establishment
of the Milken Family Foundation, which has been one of America's most
innovative forces for the advancement of education and medical
research.</TE>

<TE>   I would agree with Balzar that current attempts to reform the
economic system are inadequate, but if the implication is that deeper
reforms would solve our problems, I'd have to disagree. What we seem
to be faced with is the growing need to completely replace our
out-of-date owning-class/working-class system with one based on
profound equality--sharing the work and resources of society as equal
human beings worldwide and promoting the leadership of everybody. We
have the intelligence to figure out this transition, and doing so
would benefit all strata of society from poor to rich.</TE>
<TE>   We can do better than limiting ourselves to a reform vision. Let
us encourage the coming transformation.</TE>

<LD>Re "Wild Animals in S. Africa Reserve Are Going Once, Twice--and
Gone," July 28: The sheer act of procuring these indigenous animals,
most of which are only found in Africa--rhino, giraffe, zebra,
hippo--and tranquilizing and relocating them to farms so that members
of the safari trophy-hunting elite--probably disgraced ex-CEOs and
their cronies with far too much time on their hands and way too much
money in offshore banks--can hang a head on their living room walls
and impress their friends is an atrocity and an outrage. The whole
thing stinks of capitalism gone mad.</LD>
<LD>   It's not enough that we are all victims of world leaders who
cannot, try as they may, put an end to man killing man around the
globe; now these simple-minded idiots are going to destroy the
animals that walked here long before us and continue still to walk
the same path as we do. To hell in a handbasket is where we are all
headed, if we don't blow the entire planet off its axis first with
our guns.</LD>

<TE>   It's always galling to learn about man's solutions to animal
"problems," whether it is halfway around the world or right here in
our own backyard on the Channel Islands ("Island's Wild Pigs
Destroying 8,000 Years of Chumash History," July 28). These solutions
invariably seem to end up in the murdering of animals.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't it clear by now that these solutions should consist of more
compassion and less concern about cost-efficiency and time
consumption? Don't animals deserve a more humane fate under our
stewardship? After all, we are dealing with living things. Each
individual animal being "auctioned" or "eradicated" experiences pain,
both mental and physical. We should take that into utmost
consideration.</TE>

and overpopulation are unenlightened and not very progressive. What a
shame for the animals and for us all.</TE>

<LD>The hawks in the Bush administration are apparently planning
full-scale military action against Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   Very plausible consequences of such action would be: 1) The United
States launches an air and land assault. 2) Iraq attacks Israel with
Scud missiles. 3) Israel responds with a full air assault on Iraq. 4)
The Arab nations erupt into total chaos; regimes topple in Saudi
Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait and Jordan. 5) Middle East oil supplies to the
West are totally disrupted and Hussein remains hidden like the
Taliban's leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, and who was that other guy
Bush said he would get dead or alive?</LD>

<TE>   Derek Chollet (Commentary, July 28) wisely advocates a
congressional discussion with regard to the potential of an American
preemptive strike against Iraq, then proceeds to posit the outrageous
contention that if Congress were to debate this issue, the vote in
support of this would not be in question--that "barring some
catastrophe, Congress will support the president. The question is not
whether to act against Hussein, but when and how."</TE>
<TE>   But indeed, that is exactly the question. The support of the
Congress, or the American people, is not a given, nor should it be.
In this bizarre time that capitalizes on a false appeal to blind
patriotism, we have drifted into a haze of nonconfrontational
complicity and are allowing our foreign policy to be directed not by
the State Department but by the Defense Department. There are voices,
not only in our own government and nation but in the world community,
that definitely do not see the option of attacking Iraq as the only
one. Empowering Secretary of State Colin Powell, with his current
judicious, tempered approach to the world's problems, would be wiser
than giving President Bush and his cowboy soldiers carte blanche.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of a discussion and debate in Congress should not be a
forgone conclusion, otherwise we can no longer pride ourselves on
being a healthy, participative democracy.</TE>

<HD>Shortsighted Parole Policy</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Davis' Parole Policy Raises Questions," July 30: In your article
on Gov. Gray Davis' shortsighted parole policy you note that the
reports to the Board of Prison Terms are completed by psychiatrists.
In fact, in recent years virtually all reports are completed by
licensed psychologists. At this time the California Department of
Corrections is one of the largest, if not the largest, employers of
psychologists in the world.</LD>
<LD>   A pilot program is underway for a panel of forensic psychologists
to perform these evaluations systemwide to ensure standardized risk
assessment and uniformity of result. Despite the fact that the
professional evaluator has identified no mental illness or therapy
need, lifer parole candidates are commonly rejected by the BPT on the
basis of the board member's own opinion that the prisoner "needs more
therapy." Since CDC mental health services focus exclusively on the
mentally ill, the prisoner is left in an untenable "Catch-22." The
BPT has ordered him to commence a program of therapy that the CDC
will not provide.</LD>
<TE>   Many working in corrections fear that when worthy candidates for
parole, such as David Ramos [convicted of murder for giving a ride to
a killer], are denied, an increase in violence within the
institutions will inevitably occur. If the state doesn't play fairly
and by the rules, why should the inmate who now, due to this policy,
has nothing to lose? Neither the correctional staff nor other nonlife
inmates trying to productively serve their time deserve to be so
endangered.</TE>

<TE>   Your article on convicted murderers not being paroled reminded me
why I worked so hard lobbying the district attorney in Van Nuys to go
for the death penalty in a case where a young man in 1988 raped,
robbed and murdered a women with a toddler son who worked for me as
an apartment manager in Panorama City.</TE>
<TE>   This way her family and I do not have to endure the outrage and
insult of having to think about a parole hearing where some lawyer
would make the argument that the killer of my friend should even be
considered for being freed, no matter how remote the possibility may
be. This man must remain locked up in a small cell, 24/7, until he is
executed or dies of natural causes without any hope of walking out of
prison alive. And that goes for the rest of the convicted killers.
Thank you, Gov. Davis!</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article paraphrased Gov. Davis' deputy press secretary, Byron
Tucker, as saying that "political perils have no bearing on the
governor's parole decisions," that "the governor judges each inmate
on the evidence" and that "Davis evaluates eligible prisoners with
the feelings of crime victims foremost in his mind." Tucker stated,
"For them, there is no parole from the loss of their loved ones."</TE>
<TE>   For California's electorate there is no parole from Davis' "moral
cowardice" and hypocrisy. The case of Robert Rosenkrantz [whose
parole Davis blocked] must be all about politics because the parole
board, the courts and the victim's family all support Rosenkrantz's
release.</TE>

<HD>Elder Abuse Fine Called Ineffective</HD>
<DH>Care: Relatives of victims of nursing home neglect say
$2-million penalty against chain's owner isn't enough to force
industry reforms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND and HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Relatives of elderly residents who suffered substandard care at a
chain of nursing homes said Friday that they believe $2 million in
penalties levied against the owner this week will do little to force
real reforms at the company, one of the biggest nursing home
operators in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Beverly Enterprises Inc. pleaded no contest Thursday to two felony
elder abuse charges, and agreed to pay the civil penalties for a
range of violations that allegedly led to bed sores, dehydration,
malnutrition and improper medication among patients in the company's
60 facilities in California. The company did not admit wrongdoing in
the civil case.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a Band-Aid effect--$2 million is nothing to these people.
It's nothing," said Nancy Parsons, whose 87-year-old father, William
Marthai, died after a feeding tube was inserted improperly into his
abdomen at the Beverly La Cumbre home in Santa Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   "The fact that they would not admit their practices were horribly
felonious makes me think things will be back to business as usual
within the next two months," Parsons said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys, advocates for the elderly and others who have
complained of neglect and abuse in California nursing homes expressed
similar sentiments Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God somebody finally nailed them, but $2 million is not
nearly enough," said Joan Sheppard, whose 98-year-old mother, Eva
Calt, spent three years at Beverly Manor in Canoga Park. She said her
mother had often been neglected--left for hours at a time with dirty
underclothes, infections and other problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Those places should be shut down. You can't just give them a slap
on the wrist."</TE>
<TE>   The case settled Thursday stemmed from the deaths at Santa
Barbara's La Cumbre Convalescent Hospital of Marthai and Laura K.
Simmons, a 102-year-old former church deaconess who suffered from
severely infected bed sores and died in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The La Cumbre facility was sold by Beverly in October.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Chief Executive Dave Devereaux said in a statement issued
Friday that the settlement "implies accountability for unfortunate,
isolated incidents, but certainly no criminal intent or actions on
the part of Beverly or any of its executives."</TE>
<TE>   "We opted to settle rather than fight a lengthy court battle that
ties up financial and human resources that should be dedicated to
caring for the elderly," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials say they have doubled the number of clinical
consultants in California and promised to increase management and
supervisory resources. They did not provide more details.</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general's
office, said Friday that the settlement also requires the company to
provide authorities with an annual report detailing how it is
complying with the court-ordered requirements, including more
staffing and better training.</TE>
<TE>   The company also will have a designated compliance officer at each
of its facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics about the effects of this week's settlement cite the
company's past legal problems.</TE>
<TE>   In August 1999, Beverly Enterprises agreed to reimburse the
federal government $170 million and pay a $5-million fine to settle
Medicare fraud charges. At the time, the payment was considered one
of the largest of its kind.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, jurors in Siskiyou County awarded a record $95 million to
a 66-year-old stroke victim whose hip and shoulder were broken when
an aide at a Beverly facility, unable to find help, tried to move her
from a bed to a chair.</TE>
<TE>   That settlement was later reduced to about $3 million, said
Prescott Cole, staff attorney with California Advocates for Nursing
Home Reform.</TE>
<TE>   "For this industry, it's not mostly about money, it's all about
money," Cole said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Cole said he believes the current case could turn the industry
around for the better because the company was punished, not just
civilly with fines, but criminally by being forced to enter a plea.</TE>
<TE>   "They have agreed they are corporate felons," Cole said.</TE>

<HD>Valley City Advocates Throw Independence Ball</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Fund-raiser is in marked contrast to the
big-money event held by opponents of proposed L.A. breakup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jamie Cordaro is an electrical contractor. He wears work clothes
during the day, and sometimes he mixes metaphors when he speaks.</LD>
<LD>   But on Friday night, at the San Fernando Valley Independence Ball
in Woodland Hills, Cordaro wore a tuxedo, handed out fake $1-million
bills with his picture on them, and spoke passionately about his
support for secession.</LD>
<LD>   "In every campaign, there is going to be bumps in the road," said
Cordaro, a city council candidate in the proposed Valley
municipality. "This is a new street we're driving down. It could be a
dead end or it could be a freeway."</LD>
<TE>   The ball was the first major fund-raiser for the Valley breakup
campaign, which is sorely in need of money. The secessionists say
they have raised about $350,000 so far, not counting Friday's
receipts. Mayor James K. Hahn's campaign against secession has
collected nearly $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond money, Friday's bash at the Warner Center Hilton, featuring
mariachis and a middle-aged color guard dressed as Revolutionary War
rebels, was a morale booster.</TE>
<TE>   "It's everybody's night," said attorney Bill Powers, who organized
the affair. "You know, the Romans used to have a feast before they
went into battle, and that's what we're doing here."</TE>
<TE>   The contrasts between the secessionist ball and Hahn's biggest
fund-raiser were striking. The mayor threw his bash in June at the
posh City Club downtown. At $1,000 a plate--$10,000 for a private
reception--it collected $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley separatists kept their ticket prices at $100. With
about 300 on hand, the take was expected to be about $30,000, not
including costs.</TE>
<TE>   The ball represented the good news and bad news of the secession
movement. It's a campaign where anybody who can scrape together $100
can go to the year's biggest fund-raiser, which is a boon for those
seeking inclusiveness. But that doesn't add up to a lot of money.</TE>
<TE>   "We would have publicized it differently," griped one campaign
insider, concerned that the ball, which had been in the works for
months, would do little to boost the movement's financial fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   But to many secessionists, that isn't the point.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to be part of the downtown establishment to have a
role here," said Richard Katz, the secession campaign chairman and
Friday's master of ceremonies. "It's a chance for regular Valley
citizens ... who believe in a smaller government, to actually
participate in the process."</TE>

<HD>Blake's Wife Told of a Stalker, Tape Shows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About five months before her murder, Bonny Lee Bakley told her
husband, Robert Blake, that a man had stalked her in the past,
according to Blake's attorney, who on Friday released a brief portion
of a recorded conversation between the couple.</LD>
<LD>   "This crazy, jealous guy was, like, stalking me and I didn't know
it," Bakley told Blake in the telephone conversation.</LD>
<LD>   Blake's attorney, Harland Braun, said the tape was provided to him
by prosecutors as part of the evidence turned over to the defense
before trial.</LD>
<TE>   Blake is accused of killing his wife, who was fatally shot near a
Studio City restaurant in May 2001. He has pleaded not guilty to
murder, two counts of soliciting murder and conspiracy with the
special-circumstance allegation of lying in wait. He faces life in
prison without parole if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said the tape shows that another man could have been
attempting to do harm to Bakley. Since the shooting, Braun has said
that many men had a motive for killing Bakley, a grifter who promised
lonely men sex and nude photos in exchange for money.</TE>
<TE>   "The tape of her complaining about a stalker is absolutely
concrete corroboration from her that she was afraid of something, and
that something was not Robert Blake," Braun said.</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office, said Friday that such evidence should be presented
in court. "Mr. Braun's efforts would be better spent preparing for a
preliminary hearing rather than waving red herrings," she said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Braun also released a conversation he said Bakley had
with Christian Brando, who warned her that she should be careful
about soliciting money from men. Braun said the conversation raises
questions about whether police should have further investigated
Brando, the son of actor Marlon Brando.</TE>
<TE>   "You better get a handle on that and really think what you're
doing, running around sending letters to guys, embezzling money from
all these idiots," Christian Brando told Bakley over the phone,
according to the tape. "You're lucky, you know, I mean not on my
behalf, but you're lucky somebody ain't out there to put a bullet in
your head."</TE>
<TE>   Bakley originally claimed her child was fathered by Christian
Brando, who served five years in prison for shooting his half
sister's boyfriend. Tests eventually showed that Blake was the
father.</TE>

<HD>Verdict Not In on Malpractice Caps</HD>
<DH>Health: Officials across U.S. call state limits on damage
awards a model. But some lawyers say those making small claims are
victimized.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With malpractice premiums soaring nationally, many doctors and
insurance companies--and even President Bush--are looking to a
27-year-old California law that limits damage awards as a model for
reform.</LD>
<LD>   The trouble is, debate still rages over whether the law has been a
success or a failure. Despite the vehemence of claims by doctors and
counterclaims by trial lawyers, independent experts say the jury is
still out.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation was passed in 1975 after some California doctors
became so fed up with rising malpractice premiums that they curtailed
patient visits and their wives occupied the governor's office. The
sweeping set of reforms included a cap of $250,000 on "pain and
suffering" damages and limits on patients' attorney fees.</LD>
<TE>   Now, with premiums rising 50% to 80% annually in some states, many
doctors, insurance companies and politicians are clamoring for
California-style reforms. Legislators in Nevada approved a proposal
to cap damages early Thursday during a special session; Mississippi
is planning a similar session.</TE>
<TE>   Bush entered the debate last week, calling for a national damage
cap identical to that in California--an effort that appears to have
stalled in Congress, at least for now.</TE>
<TE>   The key question is whether California's law has worked.
Supporters say it has kept premiums in check and insulated the state
from problems being experienced elsewhere. Doctors aren't leaving
California for fear of being sued, as has happened in Nevada,
Mississippi and West Virginia. And insurers aren't leaving over heavy
losses.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters see the law as a national model because of its
stringency: Unlike laws in other states, it allows for no exceptions
to the limit on "pain and suffering" damages and it has not been
overturned in court.</TE>
<TE>   Patients' lawyers, however, say the caps in California have made
them reluctant to accept all but the most clear-cut cases, shutting
the door on many patients who may have been injured but whose
prospects for a large reward are slim. And these critics say
malpractice insurers are pocketing higher profits here than
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   They also complain that the limit on pain and suffering has not
increased since 1975. If the $250,000 cap were adjusted for
inflation, it would be $838,926.</TE>
<TE>   Experts note, with some frustration, that both sides in the debate
use some of the same evidence to make contradictory arguments.</TE>
<TE>   "You can have the people who want to have caps on damages say,
'Look at California, they're a model,' and the other side says, 'Look
at California, it shows this doesn't work,' " said Mimi Marchev, a
senior policy analyst at the Maine-based National Academy for State
Health Policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The data [are] inconclusive. And you don't go passing more tort
reform before somebody looks at whether it does any good."</TE>
<TE>   The editor of the Chicago-based Medical Liability Monitor, which
surveys insurance carriers about their rates, says her published data
are being misused by both sides.</TE>
<TE>   The American Trial Lawyers Assn., for instance, used the
publication's data to suggest that average premiums are higher for
internists, surgeons and obstetrician-gynecologists in California
than in 26 states without limits on damages for pain and suffering.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side, Californians Allied for Patient Protection, a
tort reform group, used data from the same newsletter to suggest that
California doctors pay far less, on average, than peers in Florida,
Illinois, New York, Texas and Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Golin, editor of the monthly newsletter, said her
publication doesn't even calculate average premiums because
circumstances and jurisdictions are so different that "we don't think
they exist."</TE>
<TE>   Many experts agree, however, that physicians in Los Angeles and
San Francisco typically pay lower premiums than doctors in other
large cities around the country and that rate increases in California
are not as dramatic as in other states.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Peter Weiss, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Beverly Hills,
said he pays about $40,000 a year for malpractice coverage. In
southern Florida, where premiums are among the highest in the nation,
comparable coverage would cost him $108,043 to $208,949, according to
the Medical Liability Monitor.</TE>
<TE>   Orthopedic surgeon Dr. Clayton Patchett said low malpractice
premiums are a strong incentive for physicians contemplating a move
to the state--and they offset drawbacks, including low-paying HMO
plans and the high cost of housing.</TE>
<TE>   But plaintiffs' lawyers, citing mostly anecdotal evidence, say
patients lose out under California's law. In April 2000, for example,
a jury awarded the family of 26-year-old Sujon Guha more than $8
million after finding UCLA Neuropsychiatric Hospital negligent in not
preventing his suicide. But because of the law, the award was reduced
to about $306,000, including funeral expenses and lost economic
support to his parents.</TE>
<TE>   With the cap on "pain and suffering," patients' lawyers say, the
only way to recover a substantial award is by proving heavy economic
losses. But some patients--stay-at-home mothers, retirees and
children, for example--are penalized because they have little, if
any, lost earnings that they can legally recoup.</TE>
<TE>   "It essentially blocks the courthouse doors for the most
vulnerable and the most injured ... because they just happen to not
be wage earners," said Oxnard lawyer Mark Hiepler, who says he
handles more malpractice cases outside the state than within it.</TE>
<TE>   A February 2000 award of $1.5 million to the family of a
17-year-old girl who died of undiagnosed congestive heart failure was
thus reduced to $250,000. The girl earned no wages, so her family
only received damages for pain and suffering.</TE>
<TE>   "The doctor can continue in business and continue to make money,"
said the girl's 45-year-old mother, Kara Goforth, who lives in Kern
County. "My daughter is dead forever."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers say they must spend tens of thousands to hire experts,
take depositions, copy records and prepare for trial. If the ultimate
payoff is only $250,000, they say, it's often not worth the risk of
losing.</TE>
<TE>   "The anecdotal evidence certainly is that plaintiffs' lawyers are
far less enthusiastic and far less willing to bring small-dollar
malpractice claims than they were before, " said Stanford University
law professor Robert Rabin.</TE>
<TE>   Although doctors and insurers often blame higher malpractice
premiums on lawsuits and runaway jury verdicts, some executives
acknowledge that carriers are partly to blame.</TE>
<TE>   For years, some companies charged premiums that were too low so
they could attract new business. Then, when medical claims caught up
with them, they raised their rates more than 100% or left the market
entirely.</TE>
<TE>   "They failed because they didn't raise enough money ... and they
are now suffering for it," said William Scheuber, president of the
Medical Underwriters of California, which runs the Medical Insurance
Exchange of California. He said his company, owned by physicians, is
an exception.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line for physicians, though, is that malpractice
premiums are increasing at steep rates around the nation. In some
areas, premiums for high-risk specialists have increased 200% or
more.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the national trends are moving right now, this is going
to be a big issue in a lot more states," said Cheye Calvo, a program
manager at the National Conference of State Legislatures. "We may be
looking at a national crisis."</TE>
<TE>   But California's law--and damage caps in particular--should not be
viewed as a panacea for other states, Calvo said. Physicians in
Massachusetts and Montana, which have damage caps, haven't avoided
large rate increases, he said. At the same time, doctors in
Minnesota, which doesn't have a cap, aren't having problems.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A twin-engine plane landed and skidded off the end of the Catalina
Airport runway Friday and exploded, killing both people aboard.</LD>
<LD>   The Beechcraft Baron may have been going too fast when it landed,
ending up about 100 yards from the end of the runway, said Lt. Gary
Olson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department's Avalon station.</LD>
<LD>   "There's very little solid pieces left of the plane," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The crash ignited a half-acre brush fire, which was quickly doused
by airport workers and civilians, Fire Inspector Ed Osorio said.</TE>
<TE>   The accident killed a 54-year-old man and a 48-year-old woman who
were longtime companions, authorities said. Their names had not been
released.</TE>
<TE>   Olson said the two had flown from Arizona, and were from Cave
Creek, outside Scottsdale.</TE>

<HD>Inglewood Chokehold Case Still in Limbo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Neilson Williams, hospitalized for three days in June after a violent
altercation with Inglewood police, has not been charged with any
wrongdoing, according to a Police Department spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   Williams was struck by police officers and rendered unconscious by
a chokehold after leaving an Inglewood park late on the evening of
June 23. One of the officers in the beating was Jeremy J. Morse, who
has since been charged with abuse in the aggressive July 6 arrest of
a handcuffed teenager that was captured on videotape.</LD>
<LD>   In his incident report, Morse said Williams sparked the
confrontation by resisting officers. Williams, 32, denies the
officer's account.</LD>
<TE>   A story in The Times on Wednesday chronicled the June 23
altercation, noting that Williams was never arrested. The story
reported that Inglewood police said a warrant exists for Williams'
arrest. Inglewood police on Friday denied such an assertion had been
made, adding that no warrant exists and that they have yet to file a
criminal complaint against Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, since this is a relatively complicated case, it is
taking us time to review," said Inglewood police spokesman Lt. Alex
Perez. Perez said Inglewood investigators are preparing a criminal
complaint against Williams on charges of battery and resisting
officers. They plan to file the case with the district attorney
within two weeks. "It is going to be filed, but it just has not been
filed yet," Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' attorney, Steven Lerman, said the fact that Williams has
not been arrested or charged suggests that the altercation was
mishandled by police.</TE>
<TE>   "The very fact that Mr. Williams was never charged indicates a
consciousness of guilt for what happened to him," Lerman said. "If
there should be any criminal action, it should be against Jeremy J.
Morse and other officers" at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Williams has filed a $75-million claim against Inglewood police
alleging abuse. The Inglewood Police Department's internal affairs
division and the district attorney's office are investigating the
altercation but have yet to come to any conclusions.</TE>

<HD>Growth Battle Heats Up</HD>
<DH>Simi Valley: Former mayor says he is forming a group to
fight Measure B, a SOAR initiative on the November ballot that would
restrict development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton announced Friday that he is
organizing a coalition of local leaders to fight a November ballot
measure seeking to rein in the city's growth boundaries.</LD>
<LD>   Stratton said he objects to Measure B because it is driven by
out-of-town lawyers and politicians who want to take control away
from local residents and turn it over to Ventura County. The
initiative is proposed by the slow-growth group Save Open Space and
Agricultural Resources.</LD>
<LD>   "Why are these people meddling in the local affairs of Simi
Valley?" Stratton said. "We're asking local citizens to stand up to
this land grab by outsiders."</LD>
<TE>   The ballot measure, if approved by voters, would stop expansion
beyond current city limits, clipping Alamos and Brea canyons from
future growth plans. It would also jeopardize Unocal's plans for The
Canyons, a major business park and 1,600-home development proposed
northwest of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Kimberly Lucero, a spokeswoman for the Unocal project, said the
developer is not affiliated with Stratton's effort but it supports
his goal. Mayor Bill Davis also is supporting the opposition
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Stratton's "local control" argument marked a shift for opponents
of the slow-growth measure, who previously objected largely on
economic grounds. The Canyons had been cast by City Council members
as the city's primary source of new jobs over the next 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Bentz of Simi Valley, one of the leaders of this year's Simi
Valley SOAR effort, called Stratton's argument bogus. SOAR is a
countywide group advised by Oxnard attorney Richard Francis and
supported by county Supervisor Steve Bennett and Thousand Oaks
Councilwoman Linda Parks, but the Simi Valley SOAR proposal is being
driven by a core group of about 30 city residents, Bentz said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not outside groups," she said. "If anyone is an outside
group, it's developers."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Conville, another Simi Valley resident and another leader of
the measure's supporters, said Stratton's argument was meant to
distract voters from issues of population growth and traffic by
stirring feelings of city pride.</TE>
<TE>   SOAR announced its plans for Measure B in March, drawing immediate
fire from Davis and other council members, who felt SOAR leaders were
double-crossing them. In 1998, SOAR asked Davis to support the city's
first slow-growth initiative and stipulated that it would contain
some areas in which growth would be allowed--the very areas SOAR
backers are now pushing to cut.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and other council members backed SOAR's 1998 plan, which was
passed by 70% of the city's voters.</TE>
<TE>   "We dealt on good faith with those people," Stratton said of SOAR
leaders. "Now we're finding out they had their fingers crossed and
had some other plan all along."</TE>
<TE>   SOAR leaders say they never promised city leaders they wouldn't
come back with a stricter proposal.</TE>

<HD>Fish Story Has Happy Ending for Dory Men</HD>
<DH>Oceans: Agency lifts barriers to two species, which may
help families extend their livelihoods.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a decision that could help the beleaguered Newport Beach dory men,
federal regulators have canceled restrictions for two types of fish
the historic fleet has depended on for years.</LD>
<LD>   The National Marine Fisheries Service has lifted a West Coast ban
on thornyhead, as well as size limits for sablefish caught south of
Point Sur, near Monterey Bay. Both fish have been a staple of the
dory fleet's rustic market off Newport's McFadden Square.</LD>
<LD>   Federal regulators said fishing for thornyhead was mistakenly
prohibited in June when the government took emergency action to halt
commercial fishing for popular varieties of rockfish commonly sold as
red snapper. The ban was lifted July 25 for thornyhead, a species of
groundfish, or bottom-dwelling fish, covered with long and short
spines.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Fisheries Service also lifted a size restriction
of 22 inches or greater for sablefish, also known as sea trout.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said catching thornyhead and smaller sablefish in
southern waters would not interfere with efforts to restore rockfish
populations, particularly bocaccio, which has been devastated by
overfishing.</TE>
<TE>   "The restrictions have been lifted and the corrections made. This
will help the dory men, big-time," said John DeVore, a groundfish
manager for the Pacific Fisheries Management Council, a coalition of
government and industry that helps set fishing policy.</TE>
<TE>   The fleet, based at the foot of Newport Pier, has been in decline
for more than a decade. As late as 1990, 15 to 20 men regularly
operated out of the group's headquarters and fish market. Now there
are no more than six.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining dory men and their families had feared the new
rockfish regulations would eventually destroy their unique lifestyle,
which has been a part of the Newport Beach waterfront since 1891.</TE>
<TE>   "If the changes allow the six or seven families to continue their
livelihoods, it will benefit the city tremendously," said Newport
Beach Mayor Tod W. Ridgeway. "The dory fleet has economic and
historic value. It is critical to our image."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the city met with the dory men and sent a letter on
their behalf to the Fisheries Service and the Pacific Fisheries
Management Council.</TE>

<HD>3 Teenage Escapees Remain at Large</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The three detainees who escaped from Central Juvenile Hall late
Wednesday were still being sought Friday evening, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Police have received several leads, but have been unable to find
Jose Argueta and Marvin Sandoval, both 17, and Fernando Nupiri, 18.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Sandoval was convicted of murder. Authorities said he
killed an innocent bystander mistaken for a gang member. No other
details were available. Argueta was convicted of murdering a former
leader of an Armenian street gang at a Hollywood deli. Nupiri, who
was awaiting sentencing on a probation violation, was convicted of a
carjacking in South Gate.</LD>
<TE>   Their escape is being investigated by the county Probation
Department, which is trying to determine how one of the fugitives
obtained a gun when even police officers have to check their weapons
before entering the building.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have dismissed a theory that the gun was inside a
cake delivered to one of the teenagers, said Ken Kondo, a Probation
Department spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Guards at the detention center only carry handcuffs and pepper
spray, said Robert Smythe of the department's detention bureau.</TE>
<TE>   The teenagers used handcuffs to restrain three employees, then
locked them in a 10-by-12-foot room, authorities said. Smythe said
the U.S. Border Patrol was notified once the breakout was discovered.
The FBI was notified later.</TE>
<TE>   The Probation Department is considering ways to prevent breakouts,
including possibly adding patrols and lighting at the detention
center, which is next to County-USC Medical Center, Smythe said.
There are no plans to give guards guns, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to call (213) 485-2942.</TE>

<HD>Court Allows Full Viewing of Executions</HD>
<DH>Judiciary: A unanimous ruling by a federal panel strikes
down state restrictions on witnesses as unconstitutional.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Witnesses have a constitutional right to observe executions in their
entirety, from the moment the condemned inmate enters the death
chamber to the time he is declared dead, a federal appeals court
ruled Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held that a California state
prison rule, which limits media access to the period after the
condemned inmate is strapped to a gurney and needles are inserted in
his arms, "unconstitutionally restricts the public's 1st Amendment
right to view executions."</LD>
<LD>   The court said prison officials' arguments that unfettered viewing
could endanger guards were an "exaggerated unreasonable response" to
legitimate safety concerns.</LD>
<TE>   The 3-0 ruling is the first in which a federal appeals court has
ruled on the extent of media access to executions, according to legal
experts.</TE>
<TE>   The court upheld a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn R.
Walker in San Francisco, who had struck down the state's viewing
restrictions and issued an injunction barring San Quentin officials
from enforcing them. Consequently, the full execution process has
been open to 12 members of the public, 17 journalists and five
individuals invited by the condemned inmate at the last two
executions--those of Robert L. Massie in March 2001 and Stephen W.
Anderson in January.</TE>
<TE>   Walker acted in response to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil
Liberties Union of Northern California on behalf of the Society of
Professional Journalists and the California 1st Amendment Coalition.
Both groups had objected to restrictions imposed by the California
Department of Corrections when it started using lethal injection for
the execution of William Bonin in February 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "Witnesses were not permitted to watch Bonin as the guards brought
him into the chamber, tied him down to the gurney, inserted the
intravenous lines and left him alone to await the warden's orders to
dispense the chemicals," 9th Circuit Judge Raymond C. Fisher wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather, by the time prison officials opened the chamber curtains,
permitting the witnesses to see inside the chamber, Bonin lay
motionless on the gurney, appearing to be asleep or sedated. The
lethal chemicals were then administered--without any announcement to
the witnesses--and after several minutes, Bonin was declared dead.</TE>
<TE>   "The witnesses, therefore, observed Bonin as he died, but were
unable to see the process leading to that point," Fisher wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Fully 17 minutes elapsed between the time the procedure started
and the lifting of the curtain between the execution chamber and the
public. Witnesses were unable to see complications that developed in
inserting the intravenous line and "had to rely on the prison
officials' version of events," thus eliminating independent witness
observation, Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   When California in the past used the gas chamber, the opinion
said, observers were able to watch prison staff members escort the
condemned inmate into the execution chamber, strap him into the chair
and administer the lethal gas until he was declared dead.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher's opinion was grounded on precedents that give the press
access to trials and other aspects of criminal cases. And he
emphasized that there are important public policy reasons for the
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "Independent public scrutiny--made possible by the public and
media witnesses to an execution--plays a significant role in the
proper functioning of capital punishment," Fisher wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "To determine whether lethal injections are fairly and humanely
administered, or whether they ever can be, citizens must have
reliable information about the initial procedures, which are
invasive, possibly painful and may give rise to serious
complications," Fisher added.</TE>
<TE>   His opinion was joined by 9th Circuit Judge Betty B. Fletcher and
8th Circuit Judge Myron H. Bright, on special assignment.</TE>
<TE>   State officials have contended that the policy was based on
concern for the safety of guards if their identities became known.
But state officials conceded that there has never been an incident in
which a guard at an execution has been publicly identified or
attacked.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, evidence was presented that California corrections
officials have been concerned that witnesses might observe problems
arising before an inmate is strapped onto the gurney.</TE>
<TE>   "In the event of a hostile and combative inmate, it will be
necessary to use additional force and staff to subdue, escort and
secure the inmate to the gurney," San Quentin's warden, Arthur
Calderon, wrote in a 1996 memo. "It is important that we are
perceived as using only the minimal amount of force necessary to
accomplish the task. In reality, it may take a great deal of force.
This would certainly be misinterpreted by the media and
inmate-invited witnesses who don't appreciate the situation we are
faced with."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's ruling was praised by media lawyers and death penalty
foes.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how one feels about capital punishment, executions
should be open to view by independent observers," said ACLU lawyer
Alan Schlosser. State officials "were trying to sanitize the new
method of execution," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a very positive step on the part of the
judiciary," said actor Mike Farrell, president of Death Penalty
Focus, a California group that seeks to abolish capital punishment.
"We need to continue to unmask the brutal realities of this system,
rather than allowing people to think this is a humane process that
ends in a painless death."</TE>
<TE>   Russ Heimerich, a spokesman for the state Department of
Corrections, said the agency was prepared to live with the decision.
"I don't think this is something we can't work with," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our concern always has been the security of prison personnel," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, said
state attorneys are reviewing the opinion and have not decided
whether to appeal.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alaska Airlines announced this week that it is dropping a planned new
route from Long Beach Airport to Seattle after Long Beach city
officials refused to grant the carrier temporary slots to begin the
service.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Alaska's regional affiliate, Horizon Air, has applied
with the city to operate three daily flights from Long Beach to
Seattle starting Oct. 6.</LD>
<LD>   Noise restrictions limit flights at the airport to 41 per day.
Several airlines have requested slots this year, including American
Airlines, which has started temporary service to New York and
Chicago. Jet Blue Airways holds 27 of the airport's slots.</LD>

<HD>2 Accused of Conspiracy, Hacking Into a Computer</HD>
<DH>Crime: Valley residents are indicted in the deletion of a
software company's files.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two San Fernando Valley residents were indicted Friday for allegedly
breaking into an international software company's computer system and
deleting a $2.6-million project, federal officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The company, Pleasanton, Calif.-based Commerce One Inc., was able
to recover the files at a cost of $5,000, said Thom Mrozek, a
spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office. Commerce One makes software
used for buying business supplies over the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Glenn Cazenave, 44, of Encino, and Marinella Amaya, 31, of Van
Nuys, face federal charges of conspiracy and hacking.</LD>
<TE>   Cazenave is a software developer who was fired by Commerce One in
December 2000, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Jacqueline Chooljian.</TE>
<TE>   Before his termination, the company was based in Santa Monica and
Cazenave was in charge of a project called Memec, which was being
developed for a London company, Mrozek said.</TE>
<TE>   Cazenave allegedly responded to his termination by asking Amaya,
whom he had supervised at the company, to give him the password for
the server so he could delete the Memec project.</TE>
<TE>   Cazenave did not appear to gain anything monetarily from deleting
the project file, Mrozek said. "It appears that it was a spite move,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mrozek said the federal government is paying increasing attention
to computer crimes by disgruntled employees.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment, Amaya gave her former boss the
password, and Cazenave used it to break into Commerce One's computer
and delete the entire Memec file on Feb. 21, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Cazenave and Amaya have not been arrested. But they have been
ordered to appear for an arraignment later this month. If convicted,
each faces up to 10 years in prison.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Rabbinical Students Agonize Over the Risks of Studying
in Israel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the aftermath of the terrorist bombing at Hebrew University in
Jerusalem that killed seven students, including five Americans,
Jewish families and rabbinical students across the United States are
torn between their love of and loyalty to Israel and fears for their
safety.</LD>
<LD>   As devastating as Wednesday's explosion was, most rabbinical
students who were scheduled to study in Israel are still going
despite the danger, the heads of two leading U.S. rabbinical schools
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   But some students have decided to defer their Jerusalem studies.
Whatever their decision, the renewed violence has made their
decisions agonizingly difficult.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a crazy, emotional thing to be going when you start knowing
the people who are dying. It's truly insane," said Jennifer Flam, 27,
who is sticking to her plans to study in Israel next year as required
by the Ziegler School of Rabbinical Studies, a Conservative seminary
at the University of Judaism in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Sara Yellen, 24, has come to a different decision. She decided
Thursday to cancel her study year abroad. One of the Americans killed
Wednesday, Marla Bennett of San Diego, was a childhood friend.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a huge struggle for me all year," said Yellen, a
rabbinical student at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of
Religion. "My family has begged me not to go all year, begged me to
defer it, begged me to stay here. I really wanted to go. I had doubts
about my personal safety, about my own ability to live and study
under such duress."</TE>
<TE>   She said Bennett's death precipitated her decision to wait.</TE>
<TE>   As the cycle of terrorist attacks and Israeli retaliations have
escalated, whether to travel to Israel has been a growing source of
concern among Jews. For example, the number of American students at
Hebrew University in Jerusalem has dropped to 150 this year from
1,500 two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the president of the largest U.S. Jewish denomination,
the Reform Movement, came under fire within his own movement after
suspending youth trips to Israel that summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Our religious and Zionist commitments run deep and are known to
all," Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations, said at the time. "But this movement never uses other
people's children to make a political or ideological point."</TE>
<TE>   The violence is testing mandatory requirements by the two
rabbinical schools that their students complete a year of study in
Jerusalem as a condition of ordination.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, students at the Ziegler School of Rabbinical
Studies succeeded several months ago in persuading the school to
allow students to defer study in Israel for one year.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, Rabbi David Ellenson, president of the four-campus
Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, said nine of 68
students have chosen to put off their studies in Israel for a year.
Four more students have left the seminary to attend schools with less
demanding overseas study requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "There were huge protests and comments that this was not fair,
that you're forcing us to endanger our lives," said Rabbi Bradley
Shavit Artson, dean of the Ziegler school in Los Angeles. "This year
things got so dangerous that the students wanted a greater say in
going or not going."</TE>
<TE>   But in a surprise, all 14 students who were scheduled to go to
Israel decided to go anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what they wanted was to take responsibility for their own
lives. Once I allowed them to do that, they rose to the occasion,"
Artson said.</TE>
<TE>   Ellenson said that even with a travel deferral, his institution is
committed to its philosophical and political commitment to Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "For individuals who would qualify as rabbis and leaders among the
people of Israel, the commitment to stand in solidarity with Israel
at this time is, I believe, an absolutely fundamental commitment that
cannot be compromised," Ellenson said in a telephone interview
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Artson and Ellenson, both of whom are fathers, said they
understand the fears of parents for their children.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course I have anxieties and concerns about my son's presence
in Israel at this moment," Ellenson said. "No one who would be
reasonable would not have any fears or anxieties. But at the same
time, theirs is an absolute ... commitment to the central role the
state of Israel plays in contemporary Jewish life."</TE>
<TE>   One parent who knows better than most about the dangers is Amram
Hassan. He was in Jerusalem in 1975 when a bomb exploded just outside
a store he was visiting. Sixteen people were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Hassan's daughter, Chava, leaves for Israel this week. She is 21,
the same age he was when the bomb went off in 1975. His youngest
daughter, Deena, 18, leaves for Israel on Aug. 28.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm basically torn because it's the safety of my daughters that
is going to be in Israel's hands. I won't be able to do anything from
here," said Hassan, who is executive director of B'nai David-Judea
Congregation in West Los Angeles, an Orthodox congregation.</TE>
<TE>   Still, beneath the determination and resolve to be support Israel,
human emotions can be raw in the face of the reality of Israel as a
war zone.</TE>
<TE>   Yellen spoke Friday of Bennett, her friend who died this week.</TE>
<TE>   "Marla was my connection there," Yellen said. "I always e-mailed
her when I was afraid. She would send me back advice. We had lunch a
few months ago in San Diego. She reassured me. I know she was nervous
there, but she had a way of going about her life that I was going to
model my own life after. When she died, we were just devastated. She
was like my Israel mentor."</TE>

<HD>City Council Votes to Pay Holden's Legal Fee</HD>
<DH>Finances: Board OKs $75,000 for private attorney to defend
councilman against suit by former city employee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With no public notice or discussion, the Los Angeles City Council
voted Friday to spend an initial $75,000 to hire defense attorney
Mark Geragos to represent Councilman Nate Holden against allegations
that he forced a staffer to work on his political campaign on city
time.</LD>
<LD>   Council members voted 11 to 0 to approve the contract with Geragos
after Council President Alex Padilla presented them with a special
motion that allowed lawmakers to act without posting the matter on
their agenda.</LD>
<LD>   "A lawsuit has been filed against the city involving an employment
matter in the office of Council member Nate Holden," Padilla wrote in
a memo to the council. "Because the city attorney has declared a
conflict in this matter, there is a need to obtain representation ...
by an outside firm."</LD>
<TE>   At Holden's request, Padilla urged the council to agree to hire
Geragos at the hourly rate of $325 in the initial amount of $75,000,
which will be taken from the city's general fund. Geragos, a
well-known criminal defense attorney who is representing Winona Ryder
in her alleged shoplifting case, has defended Holden and his family
in previous cases.</TE>
<TE>   After the late-in-the-meeting vote, one council member--who asked
not to be identified--said he voted for the request because "you
never know when it's going to be you needing legal representation."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Erie, a political science professor at UC San Diego, called
Friday's vote "the classic case of back-scratching."</TE>
<TE>   "Look at this, they've hired a top attorney," said Erie in an
interview. "Basically, it's a mutual protection agreement."</TE>
<TE>   Holden said in an interview that he sought quick approval for the
contract Friday because he has to prepare a response to the case
against him by Tuesday. The council was able to get around the state
requirement of giving the public advance notice because it deemed the
item an emergency.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla said after the meeting that he carried the motion because
city employees "deserve and merit adequate representation."</TE>
<TE>   Geragos--a frequent legal commentator on CNN--represented Holden's
former daughter-in-law, Michelle Holden, against allegations that she
had sexual intercourse with a minor. The former wife of Pasadena City
Councilman Chris Holden later pleaded no contest to the charge and
was sentenced to three years probation for the offense.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos also defended Nate and Chris Holden in a defamation suit
filed by a Los Angeles County sheriff's captain, who claimed the
father and son falsely accused him of soliciting bribes. The captain
later dropped the suit.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest case against Holden, one of the councilman's former
field deputies is alleging that he was forced in 1999 to work on
Holden's 10th District reelection campaign and on the campaign of
Chris Holden, who was running for mayor of Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Nate Holden ran unsuccessfully in a special election to
fill a vacancy created by the death of Rep. Julian Dixon (D-Los
Angeles). Ronald Mayberry said in his suit, filed in U.S. District
Court in June, that he spent all his time working on the race from
the campaign's Culver City office.</TE>
<TE>   After being defeated, Holden berated him for the loss, Mayberry
said, and suspended him for two days as punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Mayberry, a diabetic, said the stress caused his blood pressure
and glucose levels to rise. Following his doctor's orders, he said in
his suit, he took a medical leave of absence using accumulated sick
time. Holden then fired him without justification, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Holden on Friday described Mayberry as a disgruntled former
employee. He declined to discuss the case further.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Deputy City Atty. Terree Bowers said his office did not take
Holden's case because it was worried about a potential conflict of
interest in a case that involves two city employees. He said the
office referred the case to the city's conflict panel, which includes
a pool of outside law firms. But Holden complained that the outside
attorney assigned to him did not return his calls, prompting him to
seek Geragos' assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, Holden has been the subject of two unrelated sexual
harassment cases. The councilman prevailed in both cases after the
city spent a total of $1.5 million on his defense.</TE>

<HD>Poetry Conveys Message of Faith</HD>
<DH>A priest helps troubled souls in rough neighborhoods
experience God through spiritual meditation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Father Michael Kennedy looks out at the rows of heads bowed in
prayer, the tattooed necks and drab institutional garb of Central
Juvenile Hall in Los Angeles. He peers into young hearts wounded by
violence and bearing charges of murder, robbery and drug-dealing.
Here in these dark, treacherous places, he feels the presence of God.</LD>
<LD>   And using a Christian meditation technique that is rapidly gaining
followers from gang members to Hollywood celebrities, Kennedy helps
these troubled youths experience God too.</LD>
<LD>   At a time when some Catholic priests are under fire for sexually
abusing children, Kennedy, the pastor of Dolores Mission Church in
Boyle Heights, represents to his followers the many more priests who
devote their lives to healing youngsters. Several times a week, he
offers his personally penned meditations, which use powerful
spiritual poetry to fuse contemporary street life with ancient Gospel
scenes.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesdays and Sundays, he is at Juvenile Hall, guiding
teenagers such as Carlos, 17, who joined a gang at the age of 11 and
has been in and out of trouble for offenses including robberies,
curfew violations and his current charge--attempted murder.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesdays, Kennedy leads meditations with a women's community
group in Boyle Heights, helping them cope with lives scarred by
wife-beatings, drive-by shootings and other horrors. He shares his
spiritual poetry with the hungry who show up in the Dolores Mission
food lines, with graduate students at Loyola Marymount University and
even at the recent star-studded wedding of actor Charlie Sheen.</TE>
<TE>   And now, with his third meditation book, "The Jesus Meditations"
(Crossroad Publishing Co., N.Y.), newly published, Kennedy's poetic
prayers are gaining national notice. They are being explored by
experts in drug-abuse treatment as a healing method. In Florida,
Father Len Piotrowski has started prayer groups using Kennedy's
meditations to bridge cultural differences in his diverse Catholic
parish.</TE>
<TE>   "I find this prayer method works with all cultures and
ethnicities, because it speaks to the human heart and human
experience," said Piotrowski, pastor of St. Paul's Church in Tampa.</TE>
<TE>   The techniques are based on the 450-year-old spiritual exercises
of St. Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus, or Jesuits,
to which Kennedy belongs. The lanky, bearded priest has called them a
"school of the heart" that emphasizes personal experience of God
rather than intellectual knowledge. Unlike Eastern meditations, which
seek to empty the mind, Kennedy invites participants to activate
their imaginations, place themselves in Gospel scenes and experience
God as a concrete, healing presence.</TE>
<TE>   The point, he said, is an inner transformation to embrace the
values of compassion, justice and mercy embodied by Jesus. After
that, he said, the transformation would ideally activate a person to
spread those values as a "presence of hope and comfort to people" and
a countervailing force to self-aggrandizement and material excess.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe union with God should be so transformative that you're
willing to go to the most difficult places to minister--to prisons,
to those who don't have a voice and live on the margins of society,"
said Kennedy, 53, a Bay Area native who has devoted most of his 25
years of ministry to immigrants, farm workers, convicts and the poor
in Latin America and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy's home base of Boyle Heights is one of those often
neglected places. In fact, the priest said, the Archdiocese of Los
Angeles gave Dolores Mission Church to the Jesuits because no one
else seemed available to minister to the mostly Latino immigrant
neighborhood of high crime and poverty, a place he said has been
"soaked in blood."</TE>
<TE>   People like Arturo Lopez, Rita Chairez and Claudia Martinon work
there with Proyecto Pastoral, a nonprofit group run out of the church
that seeks to organize neighbors on such issues as education,
anti-violence, leadership training and self-esteem. All use their
meditations in their street work.</TE>
<TE>   After gang members recently began shooting at a nearby park filled
with families, traumatized neighbors packed Dolores Mission the next
day as Kennedy led them in a meditation to calm their fears. When
Chairez's brother was killed in a drive-by shooting, Kennedy wrote a
meditation that, she says, helped her say goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   For Lopez, Kennedy's meditation titled "Lepers" helped him cleanse
his heart of resentment and pain left from years of isolation and
taunting because of a childhood skin disease. Carlos, the
incarcerated juvenile, said the same meditation touched him as well,
because "a lot of us have been shut out by our families, and when
they put us away from everyone in here, we sometimes feel like
lepers."</TE>
<TE>   That meditation draws on Matthew 8:1-4, relating Jesus' act of
touching the untouchables and cleansing a leper of his disease. In
sensual, poignant prose, Kennedy writes of skin burning at night, the
loneliness of isolation, the hopelessness of recovery and the
agonized entreaties to God to explain such sufferings. Then, the
healing:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   the loneliness the rejection</TE>
<TE>   i had felt</TE>
<TE>   for so long</TE>
<TE>   the meaningless of life</TE>
<TE>   i could see</TE>
<TE>   all those wounds disappear inside</TE>
<TE>   felt a warmth</TE>
<TE>   flowing from jesus' hands</TE>

<TE>   Kennedy, who was ordained in 1977, has written hundreds of pieces
reflecting on issues such as sorrow over his parents' deaths in the
mid-1990s and his 1985 detention in El Salvador, where he was shot at
and arrested by police for bringing food and medical supplies to
villagers in the war zones. His latest book includes a CD narrated by
actor Martin Sheen, whom the priest met in the 1980s during protests
over U.S. policy toward El Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   On this Sunday at Juvenile Hall, Kennedy is cloaked in brilliant
green vestments as he greets the somber detainees who file in, arms
tucked behind their backs. He is accompanied by the detention
center's Catholic chaplain, Janne Shirley, other priests and several
volunteers. Today, the priest's theme is easing the weight of
worries--an appropriate one for juveniles facing court hearings.
First, Kennedy calls up several people to feel the weight of rocks in
a bag as a visual aid to make the lesson more concrete.</TE>
<TE>   Then a related scripture is read: Matthew 11:25-30, in which Jesus
offers to give rest to all those who are "weary and heavy-laden."</TE>
<TE>   After that, Kennedy reads his meditation, alternating between the
imagined voice of the Apostle Peter, pouring out his confusions and
fears, and the gentle reassurances of Jesus to surrender to God's
loving presence.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, several youths troop forward to the lectern to read their
reflections. One girl asks that the pain her incarceration has caused
her mother be lifted. Another asks for a "second chance for my
family." Still another discloses that her "deepest desire is to have
my father back in my life," even though she knows he is serving two
life sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Carlos says the meditations he has practiced with Kennedy
and other volunteers during the last year and a half have helped him
open up, grow closer to God and know himself. They have also helped
him escape the loneliness of incarceration by teaching him to
visualize himself in a better place. And, says Shirley, the youth's
faith journey has helped him grow into positions of responsibility at
Juvenile Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing magic about this method," Kennedy says. "It's
just a way to bring prayer to people, have a religious experience and
share it. When you're in pain, what's going to get you through is the
felt presence of God."</TE>

<HD>Kidnap Rescue Ends a Lifetime of Crime</HD>
<DH>Chase: Two teens had almost escaped from their captor
minutes before Kern County deputies killed him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE, ANDREW BLANKSTEIN and MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two teenage girls kidnapped by a career criminal and rescued in a
dramatic shootout Thursday fought with their attacker, and succeeded
at one point in pushing him out of the car as he briefly nodded off,
according to one of the girls and Kern County sheriff's deputies who
rescued them.</LD>
<LD>   Although the girls were able to take away their captor's
eyeglasses and dump him out of the car, he fell out with his gun and
threatened to shoot them through the window unless they opened the
door. As a result, deputies said, the kidnapper, Roy Dean Ratliff,
was back inside the vehicle when the Sheriff's Department caught up
with him a few minutes later.</LD>
<LD>   The shootout that followed left Ratliff dead, ending the troubled
life of a repeat offender whose criminal history dates back to before
he was 10 years old, according to records and officials in
California, Nevada and Nebraska. He was killed after holding the two
girls for about 12 hours and raping them, said Kern County
Sheriff-Coroner Carl Sparks.</LD>
<TE>   One of the victims, speaking publicly for the first time, told
KABC-TV Channel 7 that she and the other kidnapping victim pleaded
with Ratliff to spare them: "What did we do to you that was so bad
for you to take us and bring us here? ... Don't you understand that
we have family that loves us?"</TE>
<TE>   In other interviews Friday, authorities and others offered new
details about the event's closing minutes, when Kern County sheriff's
deputies closed in and eventually ended the abduction.</TE>
<TE>   Aided by a new statewide system for sending out an alert in
abduction cases, Californians had their eyes peeled for the car and
its occupants on Thursday morning. But while thousands heard of the
abduction, it was Kern County Animal Control Officer Bonnie Hernandez
who was credited Friday with the key break in the search.</TE>
<TE>   About 11:45 a.m., Hernandez said she was driving on California
178, listening to the police scanner, when she spotted the taillights
of the white 1980 Ford Bronco about three-quarters of a mile away.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty minutes later, she said she returned to Ridgecrest, a few
miles away, and told deputies about the vehicle she had seen.</TE>
<TE>   In response, two deputies drove onto the White Blanket Indian
Allotment and closed in on the suspect, cutting off his only escape
route, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "He had nowhere to go," sheriff's Cmdr. Hal Chealander said.</TE>
<TE>   When Ratliff saw deputies, he drove down an embankment into a dry
river bed, Chealander said. His vehicle got stuck atop a rock, with
all four wheels spinning in the air. The deputies surrounded
Ratliff's vehicle, firing a total of 17 shots after Ratliff pointed a
weapon at one of them.</TE>
<TE>   In her televised interview, the girl said Ratliff fired the first
shot at deputies, but the Kern County Sheriff's Department would not
confirm that, saying that the incident was still under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities who finally caught up with him after a statewide
manhunt speculated Friday that Ratliff chose to fight it out with
sheriff's deputies rather than risk a return to prison, where he had
spent almost 12 of the last 13 years and likely would have remained
for the rest of his life.</TE>
<TE>   The 37-year-old career criminal was wanted in Kern County for
allegedly raping a teenage family member in September. State
corrections officials also declared him a fugitive for failing to
contact his parole officer in the months after his July 29, 2001,
release from state prison for drug possession.</TE>
<TE>   Finding Trouble Early</TE>
<TE>   Ratliff, who grew up in Scottsbluff, Neb., had an extensive
criminal record, beginning at age 7, local authorities said. He moved
to the Los Angeles area in 1989, where he was promptly arrested on a
burglary charge, criminal records show.</TE>
<TE>   As a juvenile, he was picked up for truancy, being a runaway,
breaking into buildings and theft. He lived for some time in a foster
home, and he was sent to a group home for boys before he turned 13,
Nebraska authorities said. Between the ages of 12 and 24, Ratliff was
jailed at least 16 times.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember him," Scotts Bluff County Sheriff Jim Lawson said.
"He's what we call a regular customer."</TE>
<TE>   At 19, Ratliff was convicted of underage possession of alcohol,
misdemeanor theft and drunk driving, said Doug Warner, a prosecutor
in the Scotts Bluff County attorney's office in Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Ratliff was convicted of felony burglary and
sentenced to 18 months in state prison, Warner said.</TE>
<TE>   Between June 1987 and September 1988, he was convicted three times
for driving with a suspended license, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also was convicted of shoplifting and passing a bad check in
Nebraska in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   That same year, after moving to California, Ratliff was sentenced
to two years in state prison for burglary, said Sandi Gibbons, a
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office.
Two years later, he again pleaded guilty to burglary and was
sentenced to 88 months in prison, she said. Both cases were
investigated by Long Beach police.</TE>
<TE>   Ratliff was released from prison in January 1996 and returned in
February 1997 after being convicted of possession of methamphetamine
in Kern County, state corrections records show.</TE>
<TE>   Life in Prison Loomed</TE>
<TE>   Ratliff's extensive record would have ensured that, if caught
again, he would have spent the rest of his life in prison, officials
said, adding that they believe he was determined to avoid that.</TE>
<TE>   "He recognized the helicopters and said, 'I have to get rid of
these girls,' " Sparks said Friday. "He was a two-striker. He was
going to prison for the rest of his life. He had nothing to lose."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he died in a hail of gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   Rescued from whatever fate Ratliff intended for them, the girls
returned home to the Antelope Valley on Thursday night, greeted by
friends and family, some bearing flowers.</TE>
<TE>   "She's getting a lot of support from her friends and family but
she's still very upset," the mother of one girl said. "It's really
hard right now."</TE>
<TE>   Even after the ordeal of the last two days, she added, the girl
and her family were overcome with relief to have her safe.</TE>
<TE>   "Home never seemed so good," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I could have been like Samantha Runnion's mother. I could have
been burying [her]."</TE>

<HD>3 in La Puente Accused of Vote Fraud</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three family members of La Puente Councilman Louie Lujan were
arrested Thursday on suspicion of voting twice in a municipal
election last year in which Lujan won his seat, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Arrested were Lujan's wife, Christina, 23, whom he married earlier
this summer, and his father-in-law and mother-in-law, Jesus and Celia
Lamas.</LD>
<LD>   A fourth relative was expected to turn herself in to police, said
Alfie Charles, a spokesman for the California secretary of state's
office. Lujan, 26, is not a suspect in the case, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Charles said the four probably will face one felony count each of
voter fraud. If convicted, each faces up to three years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   He said the four mailed absentee ballots and also voted at their
regular polling places. Safeguards to prevent such double voting
apparently did not work, and officials are looking into why, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Charles said the case was referred to the state by the La Puente
city clerk sometime after the March 2001 election.</TE>
<TE>   George Bird, who is representing the Lujan family members, said
that "none of these people committed any crimes."</TE>
<TE>   "I expect that the evidence will show that the voting records are
deficient in La Puente," Bird said.</TE>
<TE>   He identified the fourth suspect as a sister-in-law.</TE>

<HD>Air Carriers Attack Hahn's Plan for Renovating LAX</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Letter objects to aspects of proposal on which
the city says it won't budge. United isn't among signers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Airlines that carry almost half the passenger traffic at Los Angeles
International Airport criticized key components of Mayor James K.
Hahn's $9.6-billion renovation plan in a strongly worded letter sent
to the city agency that operates LAX.</LD>
<LD>   The message marks the first time that the carriers, who have been
widely rumored to be unhappy with the mayor's recently released
modernization proposal, have gone on the record with their concerns.</LD>
<LD>   The airlines documented their unease about several key points of
Hahn's plan, including construction of a remote facility near the San
Diego Freeway; moving a runway, which would require demolishing three
terminals; an effort to cap use of the airport at 78 million annual
passengers; and, perhaps most important, the cost.</LD>
<TE>   It was signed by United Parcel Service, as well as seven passenger
carriers--Alaska, America West, American, Continental, Delta,
Northwest and Southwest.</TE>
<TE>   "The airlines wonder how a plan of this size could be financed,"
the signatories said. "If the city's policy is indeed to constrain
the capacity of LAX, it is difficult to believe that the airport
could not be improved in a more cost-effective manner and still
achieve the benefits of the new alternative."</TE>
<TE>   It's crucial that Hahn secure the airlines' support because they
would be asked to shoulder half of the plan's cost through higher
landing fees and terminal leases. The airlines also have enormous
lobbying power in Washington, where the Federal Aviation
Administration's approval of the proposal would be needed.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn recently unveiled details of his highly anticipated master
plan, which favors safety and security over expansion. The sweeping
proposal would dramatically alter the airfield, ban traffic in the
central terminal area and rely on an elevated train to link LAX with
new facilities to the east.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, carriers noted that most of the 88 members of the
airport's airline affairs committee weren't included in numerous
briefings given by Hahn's staff to business and community leaders
before he announced the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The airport's largest carriers, including American, Southwest and
United, received an overview before the July 3 rollout, and the
proposal was changed to reflect some of their concerns, said Airport
Commission President Ted Stein.</TE>
<TE>   Noticeably absent from the list of signatories is cash-strapped
United, the airport's largest carrier. The company refused to specify
why it hadn't signed the letter, saying that it continues to meet
with the city to discuss Hahn's plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We support the modernization of this airport, and we are looking
forward to working very closely with the airport administration and
the city to refine that proposal and make it work," said Alan Wayne,
a company spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The airport agency plans to meet with the airlines again next
week. But the letter, sent last month to Jim Ritchie, deputy
executive director of long-range planning for the airport agency,
raises the question of just how much of Hahn's fledgling plan is
negotiable.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say they will not budge on many of the plan's most
controversial provisions.</TE>
<TE>   "Having people go to Manchester Square for the purpose of getting
on the people mover is nonnegotiable," Stein said. "Barring cars and
hopefully car bombs from the [central terminal area] is not something
we're going to change. Increasing the capacity over 78 million annual
passengers is not on the table, and moving the runway on the north
side 340 feet closer to the terminals is not negotiable."</TE>
<TE>   The airlines have quarrels with all of these elements. They say
passengers "would certainly view" a remote terminal at Manchester
Square "as another 'airport hassle,' with no corresponding benefits."</TE>
<TE>   The airlines are also concerned about a proposed underground
system for ferrying bags from the remote terminal to the airport.
Dennis Olson, director of properties for Alaska Airlines, asked in an
interview: How would the bags be delivered to the right airlines for
processing? Where would they go through security?</TE>
<TE>   The city is open to talking with the airlines about having
passengers check their bags and go through security at Manchester
Square, Stein said. The plan proposes that travelers pass through
security after arriving at the airport.</TE>
<TE>   The letter also states that moving the inbound northern runway
closest to the airport--which would require the destruction of
Terminals 1, 2 and 3 and part of the Tom Bradley International
Terminal--would necessitate a major investment resulting in "limited
operational improvements."</TE>
<TE>   If the mayor breaks ground without the blessing of many of the
airport's most influential airlines, he may risk prohibitively higher
costs for carriers and consumers, industry watchers said.</TE>
<TE>   As an example, Hahn need only look to Denver International
Airport, where officials spent $3 billion to carve an airfield out of
rolling grasslands.</TE>
<TE>   The facility's cost required the city agency that operates the
airport to raise landing fees from $1.76 per 1,000 pounds of landed
weight in 1993 to $3.68 in 1995, an airport spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   This increase forced at least six carriers, including the hub
airline, Continental, to desert the new facility and prompted those
who stayed to set airfares at stubbornly high levels, said Michael
Boyd, a Denver-based airline consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "You need a buy-in from the airlines," Boyd said. "You don't want
to build an airport outside the context of the people who use it. You
can do it. But it's always the consumer and the taxpayer who pay the
price."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Excerpts From Carriers' Letter</TE>
<TE>   Many of Los Angeles International Airport's most influential
airlines sent a letter to the city agency that operates the airport
criticizing Mayor James K. Hahn's $9.6-billion modernization plan.
Some excerpts:</TE>
<TE>   * On a remote facility at Manchester Square: "This facility would
appear to do little more than centralize the transportation of
passengers into the central terminal area, which they would certainly
view as another 'airport hassle' with no corresponding benefits."</TE>
<TE>   * On airfield modifications: "The relocation of Runway 6R/24L [the
runway closest to the terminals on the north side], which also
necessitates the demolition and replacement of several passenger
terminals, would be a major investment, provide no real increase in
capacity, and gain only limited operational improvements."</TE>
<TE>   * On constraining capacity: "Constraining the capacity of LAX to
induce traffic at other airports that are already constrained could
result in the inability of the Southern California region to
accommodate air traffic demand at reasonable levels of customer
service."</TE>

<DH>Policy: News organizations typically do not disclose rape
victims' names. But releasing identities can help in a search.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The abduction and rape of two Southern California teenagers this week
may force the media to reexamine their long-standing policies of
withholding the names of sexual assault victims.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, the day after the two girls were kidnapped at gunpoint
from their desert community and rescued about 12 hours later by Kern
County authorities, newspapers ranging from USA Today to the Los
Angeles Daily News carried the girls' names and photos. Other papers,
such as the Orange County Register and The Times, did not disclose
the victims' identities. Similar differences also appeared in
television news broadcasts and on Web sites.</LD>
<LD>   For decades, virtually all news organizations have avoided using
the names of rape victims, both to protect victims' privacy and to
prevent discouraging victims who might step forward but for fear of
publicity.</LD>
<TE>   The first statewide use of a new alert system to apprehend child
abductors explains much of the discrepancy in coverage in this case.
When the girls were abducted, authorities released the names and
photos of the victims to aid in their rescue. The media learned that
the girls had been raped only after they had been found and taken to
safety.</TE>
<TE>   The question then became for the media, now what? Many outlets
reasoned that, because the information had already been made public
it seemed pointless to pretend otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't recall another situation like this before, where the
information was already out," said David Colton, front-page editor
for USA Today, which ran the victims' names and photos above the fold
of the newspaper with a story inside. "With the incredible saturation
coverage going on, which included a victim's father talking on
television, we felt the cat was out of the bag.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all going to have to look a lot harder about how far to go
and what the circumstances are," he added. "We still have a
responsibility to do the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   Standing by Rules</TE>
<TE>   Other news organizations stood by their policies, even if that
proved awkward or confusing. The Times initially posted the photos
and names of the victims on its Web site, but withdrew them after
news of the rapes had been announced.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a rule, as a paper, not to run the names of rape victims
and we didn't see a reason not to stick to that policy," said Times
Managing Editor Dean Baquet. "If you're going to be influenced by
what everybody else does in this era of zillions of Web sites and
zillions of television stations, then you ought not have a rule."</TE>
<TE>   KTLA-TV news faced the same decision. It too aired the names and
photos of the two girls early on, but later withdrew them. "When it
became clear that there was a sexual assault involved, we changed our
whole outlook on the story," said Jeff Wald, the station's news
director. "We did not disclose the names, we [obscured] their faces,
we didn't even give family names."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "I don't see any other way to do this. We have to
provide an accurate description with pictures. But we will respect
the privacy if the story changes." (KTLA-TV and The Times are both
owned by the Tribune Co.)</TE>
<TE>   The story did change slightly Friday evening when one of the
victims granted a broadcast news interview. Once a victim goes public
herself, the media put aside their restriction.</TE>
<TE>   The disjointed media coverage upset some rape victims, said
Jennifer Luck, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Commission on
Assaults Against Women, a nonprofit organization that seeks to
eliminate violence against women. On the one hand, Luck said she
understood the dilemma the media faced, once the identities of the
girls had been disclosed. On the other, she said, once the sexual
crime surfaced, it should have been left up to the teenagers whether
their identities continued to be exposed.</TE>
<TE>   "When a woman is sexually assaulted or raped, her sense of control
is taken away from her," Luck said. "It's extremely important for the
healing process that they have the choices every step of the way
after that. It's an issue of empowerment and putting control back
into the hands of the survivor."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Luck conceded, it would be ill-advised in future cases if
authorities failed to release the names of child kidnap victims for
fear that a sexual assault might occur. The top priority should be to
rescue the victims and apprehend the abductors as quickly as
possible. However, if evidence of a sexual assault arises after a
rescue, the victim's identity should be immediately withdrawn, Luck
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a Catch-22 situation," said Cinny Kennard, an
assistant professor of journalism at USC's Annenberg School for
Communication, who lectures on ethics. "If you don't put out the
names you lose momentum for the search. If you do and there is a
sexual assault as in this case, the victim's privacy is destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   Policies Date to 1960s</TE>
<TE>   The policies against publishing or broadcasting names of rape
victims began in the late 1960s and early 1970s, according to Kelly
McBride, who is on the ethics faculty at the Poynter Institute, a
journalism research institution in St. Petersburg, Fla. Unlike other
crime victims, those who suffered sexual assaults were to be shielded
from unnecessary publicity because of societal shame, McBride said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we fully understand, as a society, why we react
that way to rape and not other crimes," McBride said. "But if you
think about your daughter, wife or mother being raped, most people
wouldn't want that information made public. You don't want to
re-traumatize the victim."</TE>
<TE>   A recent example of a rape victim's allowing her name to be
printed involved the daughter of a newspaper columnist for the Omaha
World-Herald in Nebraska. The columnist, Michael Kelly, whose
daughter survived being shot and raped by an attacker, wrote: "[My
daughter] says she wasn't speaking for others or suggesting how they
should feel. But she adds: 'Why is it more shameful to be a rape
victim than a gunshot victim?' Surely, it is not. But there is shame
in rape, and it rests squarely with the attacker, not the victim."</TE>
<TE>   Before another such incident occurs, McBride urged, news
organizations should reevaluate their polices and reach out to
viewers and readers for guidance. "We need to be open about examining
our motives. One motive is to tell the truth and part of that truth
is naming names and showing pictures," she said. "But another motive
is to minimize harm and we have to be sure this policy really does
minimize harm."</TE>

<DH>Education: Cal State Fullerton offers high school girls
hands-on experience with math and science.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The squeaky sound of platform sandals and sneakers reverberated
across Cal State Fullerton's McCarthy Hall on Thursday morning as 23
high school girls frantically raced up and down stairs and escalators
in search of math scavenger-hunt clues.</LD>
<LD>   With pad, pencil and calculator in hand, 15-year-old Priya Gandhi
bolted across a hallway in search of the room that would contain the
coveted envelope with the next math problem.</LD>
<LD>   "There it is," Gandhi screamed as she grabbed the white envelope
from a door and plopped on the floor to work with teammates Rosa
Rivas, Janeth Zepeda and Tracy Valdez.</LD>
<TE>   Games such as the scavenger hunt, Linear Jeopardy and
Algebra-nopoly are some of the ways the university's Math Intensive
Summer Session (MISS) made algebra fun and hands-on for the 49 girls
in this year's four-week program.</TE>
<TE>   MISS was launched more than a decade ago to reverse the steep drop
in math performance in girls between elementary and high school.</TE>
<TE>   Rita Colwell, the first female director of the National Science
Foundation, described a "valley of death" in education, in which
female students in grades 4 through 8 lose interest in math and
science because of peer pressure and lowered expectations of
teachers, counselors and family members.</TE>
<TE>   In a supportive girls-only environment, MISS prepares Orange
County high school girls from disadvantaged backgrounds who want to
pursue higher education.</TE>
<TE>   This year's MISS program consisted of two classes to prepare girls
for Algebra I and II--regarded as "gatekeeper" courses that can
become stumbling blocks for some students hoping to apply to
competitive four-year post-secondary schools.</TE>
<TE>   The brainchild of Cal State Fullerton math professor David Pagni
and campus tutoring center director Ina Katz, MISS began in 1990 with
32 girls. This year, more than 80 applicants submitted transcripts,
teacher recommendations and an essay.</TE>
<TE>   The MISS program comes at a time of slow growth rates for women in
science and math fields. Although the number of women in sociological
and biological sciences has increased, less than 10% of the nation's
engineers are women, said Ruta Sevo, director of the National Science
Foundation's program for gender equity in science, mathematics,
engineering and technology.</TE>
<TE>   Sevo said less than 30% of computer science professionals and 23%
of physical scientists are women.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next decade, Sevo said, another 2.2 million workers will
be needed in the sciences and in engineering, fields that will
require people with strong math backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Our nation's growth is limited if we don't produce more people
with science and technology skills," Sevo said. "If we bring more
women and more minorities into the workplace, it will give us a
competitive advantage and show leadership internationally."</TE>
<TE>   Educators and scientists say programs such as MISS help students
feel at home with math and science.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of our traditional approaches to education in science and
math have made it seem hard ... or have made it seem 'not for me' to
most students," Sevo said. "We're trying to reverse that image
because most children are naturally very excited about science ...
and we are trying to sustain that interest. These programs are
helping us change education to become more inclusive."</TE>
<TE>   Although research suggests that teaching a mixed pool of students
is an asset for classes, educators also believe that single-gender
courses such as the MISS program help boost students' self-confidence
and provide a nonthreatening environment.</TE>
<TE>   The National Science Foundation's Colwell remembers her encounter
with stereotypes when her high school chemistry teacher refused to
write a recommendation letter for her to study chemistry in college.</TE>
<TE>   "He said girls couldn't do chemistry really well," Colwell said in
a telephone interview. "There is a tendency in schools to make
preordained assumptions that girls don't like math and can't do
science, ... which is really unfortunate and not well-founded. You
then get your expectations fulfilled and that's not good for the
country."</TE>
<TE>   For incoming Newport Harbor High School junior Mariela Manriquez,
being part of the MISS program will help her prepare for an Algebra
II honors class this fall and for college admissions. She hopes to go
into a field involving mathematics after college.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that girls have to prove that we can do it," Mariela said
as she sat doing homework in her family's living room in Costa Mesa.
"The program helps us feel more confident in ourselves and to be
confident in achieving anything."</TE>
<TE>   As her mother, Ninfa, and 1-year-old cousin, Araceli, watched her
do homework, Mariela explained that her mother and father, originally
from Mexico, had to leave school in the elementary grades to help
support their families. She plans to be the first in her family to go
to college.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big responsibility," she said. "All their hopes are on
me."</TE>
<TE>   Pagni said that more than 90% of MISS graduates have gone on to
college or university.</TE>
<TE>   MISS alumna Natalie Solon, 28, remembers her experiences in the
first and second summers of the Cal State Fullerton program.</TE>
<TE>   "They made it so fun that you didn't get scared if you didn't do
the problems correctly."</TE>
<TE>   Solon earned a master's degree in business administration, but has
returned to the Fullerton campus to get credentials to teach high
school math.</TE>
<TE>   MISS, she said, gave her an educational foundation as well as
something even more valuable. "I learned that I can do anything I set
my mind to do."</TE>

<LD>In the Rev. Eugene H. Peterson's retelling of the Bible, when Jesus
raises a young girl from the dead, he first has to work his way
through neighbors bringing casseroles to the grieving family's home.</LD>
<LD>   The poetic "valley of the shadow of death" from Psalm 23 becomes
simply "Death Valley." And when God prepares to flood the Earth, he
decides to spare Noah because "Noah was different. God liked what he

biblical paraphrases that Peterson spent 20 years writing. NavPress
sold 320,000 copies in advance and ordered an initial print run of
500,000, the largest it has had for a Bible, spokeswoman Kathleen
Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson's New Testament, published in 1993, sold 2.5 million
copies, and his other "Message products"--more than 20 in all--have
sold 4.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Vern Poythress, a New Testament professor at Westminister
Theological Seminary in Glenside, Pa., says he and fellow
conservatives may quibble with many of Peterson's renderings but have
leveled few attacks because "The Message" is not a Bible and isn't
presented as such.</TE>
<TE>   He sees it as useful for evangelism among people who know nothing
about the Bible, as long as they realize it is merely one writer's
interpretation of the biblical message.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson translated the Bible directly from the Greek and Hebrew
and avoided earlier English translations. His purpose was to capture
the original earthy, vigorous tone.</TE>
<TE>   "My intent was to provide something for people who had never read
the Bible before, or didn't think they could read it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Message," Paul the apostle is that "jailbird preacher." In
Psalm 23, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want," becomes "God,
my shepherd! I don't need a thing."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody "begets" anybody in "The Message." They have babies.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been reading the Bible since I was a little kid, but I found
myself, when I first cracked [Petersen's version] open--I was on an
airplane--and I found myself laughing out loud or crying," recalled
Brad Rauch, a friend of Peterson and general manager of Christian
radio station KALS-FM (97.1) in Kalispell, Mont.</TE>
<TE>   Rauch is one of many admirers. Peterson, who grew up in Kalispell
and lives nearby on the shore of western Montana's Flathead Lake, has
fans all over.</TE>
<TE>   Bono, lead singer for the Irish rock band U2, cited "this guy
Eugene Peterson" in a December interview with Rolling Stone.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a poet and a scholar, and he's brought the text back to the
tone in which the books were written," Bono said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Message" began because Peterson's adult Sunday school class
didn't grasp how exciting Paul's letter to the Galatians really is.
He decided to translate it for them.</TE>

<HD>A Journey to the Wilderness in Search of Self</HD>
<DH>A trip deep into the woods for four days of sitting and
fasting provides the solitude to help one evaluate life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are many paths to enlightenment in Southern California. One of
them leads to a 10-foot circle deep in the woods of the southern
Sierra Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   At sunrise one morning early this week, outdoor skills teacher Jim
Lowery and a dozen students will walk into the forest. Then, far
apart, each will sit down in a circle and stay there for four days
and nights.</LD>
<LD>   They will not eat. Nor will they have cell phones, journals,
radios, books or any other kind of worldly distraction. They will
bring only the clothes on their backs, sleeping bags and water. They
will be on a summer vacation devoted entirely to the notion that a
little self-denial is good for the soul.</LD>
<TE>   The purpose of this quest isn't to make it from point A to point B
armed with nothing more than a compass and pocketknife. The idea,
rather, is to be alone with one's thoughts in a place far from the
hustle and bustle of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a thing that questers always say, and that's 'Be prepared
to meet your greatest enemy, which is yourself,' " Lowery said. "You
tend to spend a lot of time stripping away layers of beliefs and
baggage that you've carried with you for years."</TE>
<TE>   And that, Lowery explained, is precisely the point. His students
will get the time and solitude they need to figure out whatever it is
in their lives that needs, well, figuring out. The list includes
careers, relationships, parents, money, fear, loss and--possibly the
most elusive prize of all--self-knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   Variations on Lowery's quest have been around for thousands of
years as part of Native American cultures and, in fact, of many
cultures across the globe. Fasting in particular remains a vital part
of most major religions.</TE>
<TE>   Lowery is an ex-journalist who also led a consumer research
advocacy group for 10 years. In 1987, he left his old job and began
an outdoors school--called Earth Skills--which he now runs out of his
Frazier Park home. Lowery, a skilled animal tracker, and his wife,
Mary Brooks, became increasingly curious about quests and finally
tried one of their own in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   After four days fasting in the mountains, they walked out to find
that a marauding bear had eaten their food. It was all part of an
experience, said Brooks, that made them feel like "specks" in the
grand scheme of the universe, but specks with new, refreshed
attitudes.</TE>
<TE>   If a quest sounds like New Age fluff, Lowery said it's wrong to
equate his version of a spiritual quest with worshipping crystals,
sitting in power vortexes or chanting while burning incense.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the experience different, he said, is that the quest is
hard. Really hard.</TE>
<TE>   You want to change your life?</TE>
<TE>   Great, said Lowery. But first you must suffer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's your giveaway, your sacrifice," he said. "If you want
answers about life, and you're sitting in front of the TV with a soda
and pretzels, the universe may not respond as dynamically."</TE>
<TE>   The students come from all walks of life. There have been lawyers,
therapists, teachers, engineers and trade workers, to name a few.
Most are 40 or older. Some are experienced in the outdoors. One
ex-New Yorker did it despite an intense fear of the dark.</TE>
<TE>   Their motivations vary. Some are there to question religion, or
find it. Others seek a stronger connection to nature. Most want some
quiet time to sit and think.</TE>
<TE>   "I had lost a best friend and business partner to cancer," said
Don Fairley, 58, of Long Beach. "I felt like I needed something
extreme to get the clarity I needed."</TE>
<TE>   The quests take place each year on private property in the
southern Sierra. The nearest town is 40 miles away. A few people
haven't made it through the four days--Lowery and Brooks check on
each from a distance--but no one has ever tried to bolt.</TE>
<TE>   Some people pass the time screaming, shouting, dancing or singing.
Just about everyone does a lot of looking around. Others throw rocks
that lie within their circle. Obsessive behavior is discouraged.
People are advised to cut the tags from their clothes lest they get
caught up in trying to see how many words the letters spell.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife sightings are common. The same birds and bees tend to
show up at the same time every day. One night, two deer bedded down a
few feet from one man's circle. A ringtail--which looks like a cross
between a raccoon and a lemur--once hopped across a quester's circle.</TE>
<TE>   Some have experienced earthquakes. Lowery said that nearly
everyone comments on having watched the sun, moon and planets make
their slow journey across the sky.</TE>
<TE>   Hunger has some interesting ways of asserting itself. Clouds can
take the shape of cheeseburgers. Lori Lawrenz, on her third quest
this week, said she once spotted the twinkling light of a cabin miles
away--and then spent a good chunk of her quest preparing menus for
its imaginary inhabitants.</TE>
<TE>   A friend of Lowery for 30 years, Ron Greenspun of Long Beach was
an experienced backpacker, but never had spent time in the outdoors
doing nothing. He finally decided to quest last summer to "get off
the people mover and just get away from everything."</TE>
<TE>   By the end he was hungry, tired and filthy. His insights weren't
profound, he said, but they were important to him. Sitting alone and
exposed to the elements, he asked himself, "How long had it been
since I accepted a challenge and pushed myself and took some risk?
... There was a sense there's so much crap in my life--what do I need
and what don't I need? I imagined myself throwing a lot of stuff
out."</TE>
<TE>   And that, say questers, is the goal. With all the noise in today's
culture, it helps to find a quiet spot for a few days to sort out
what really matters.</TE>
<TE>   The quest, they say, may not mend a broken heart or ease the pain
that living can bring. But sit long enough in a quiet place and you
may hear a few things. The birds, the bees, the wind and a long
forgotten voice of authority: your own.</TE>

<HD>Missing Headstone Adds to Dispute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In death, as in life, controversy follows Owen Brown.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, son of famed abolitionist John Brown, took part in a bloody
massacre in Kansas and survived his father's ill-fated raid on a
government arsenal at Harper's Ferry in what is now West Virginia.</LD>
<LD>   Now 113 years after he was buried on an Altadena hilltop, the
headstone marking his grave and the concrete block that held it in
place are missing.</LD>
<TE>   The Altadena residents who often visited the grave, which is along
a popular hiking trail, are baffled. Local conservationists are
enraged. And the landowner, long battling residents about trespassing
on his property, says he's "bummed out" about the whole thing.</TE>
<TE>   The marker has been gone at least a month, though no one's quite
sure when it disappeared. Everyone involved, however, agrees on one
thing: This is a strange twist to a long-running dispute over whether
Mike Cichy, the landowner, has the right to prevent hikers from
meandering up El Prieto fire road, which winds through his property.</TE>
<TE>   The headstone was at the center of that dispute. Conservationists
complained that Cichy couldn't restrict access to a road that has
long been established as a public right of way. But Cichy said he was
protecting his property from trespassers and vandals, who he added
often leave empty beer cans and cigarette butts.</TE>
<TE>   So far, no one is investigating the stone's disappearance. The
county doesn't have to look into it if Cichy doesn't file a
complaint. The site is not a registered historical landmark, and the
county does not recognize it as an official burial ground or
cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   Cichy said he noticed that the stone was gone on the Fourth of
July and has no plans to file a report. "Sooner or later," he said
recently, "stuff surfaces."</TE>
<TE>   Others aren't so sure.</TE>
<TE>   "This incredible site has just fallen through the cracks. It's
very sad and very disturbing," said Lori Paul, vice president of the
Altadena Foothills Conservancy, one of a handful of groups contesting
Cichy's right to cut off access to the fire road.</TE>
<TE>   Some say they suspect that the landowner removed the marker to
discourage hikers from visiting the site. If he did, authorities and
even his critics agree, he would be within his rights. But Cichy said
he is just as bewildered as everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a lot of respect for Mr. Brown," he said. "I respect the
dead."</TE>
<TE>   Owen Brown and his brother Jason were celebrities when they
settled first in Pasadena, then moved to Altadena.</TE>
<TE>   Owen was among a handful of survivors of his father's raid on the
arsenal at Harper's Ferry in 1859. John Brown hoped that capturing
the arsenal would inspire slaves to revolt and force the government
to abolish slavery. He was hanged Dec. 2, 1859.</TE>
<TE>   Their father's cause made Owen and Jason famous among the Union
veterans who settled in Southern California after the Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   When Owen died of pneumonia in 1889 at the age of 64, about 2,000
mourners reportedly marched in the funeral procession up to Little
Roundtop Hill, which was owned by Jason. Ten years later, a marker
was placed at the grave site. It read: "Owen Brown, Son of John
Brown, the Liberator, died Jan. 9, 1889."</TE>
<TE>   Cichy bought the six-acre property from Mary Vargo in January. He
said that when he arrived, hikers were cutting through his property
to get to Angeles National Forest. Some were walking their dogs and
not picking up after them, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He was also concerned that something could happen to people
walking through the rocky terrain, he said. "I got nothing wrong with
people visiting" Owen Brown's grave, he said. "Right now it's
hazardous. If someone should hurt themselves up here, I'm negligent.
I need time to fix it up."</TE>
<TE>   A self-proclaimed civic activist who spends a lot of time in
Oregon and on the East Coast, Cichy said he wanted privacy and
tranquillity when he purchased the property. He planted flowers at
the grave site, he said. Some nights, he camps out underneath a blue
tarp.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies made several visits to Cichy's property after
residents complained that he had been lighting campfires. County
zoning officials visited too, because Cichy had been storing building
materials on the site.</TE>
<TE>   A Glendale attorney, Paul Ayers--hired by
conservationists--alleged that it was illegal for Cichy to camp out
on land zoned as a vacant lot.</TE>
<TE>   On July 18, county zoning officials issued a citation to Cichy for
keeping junk materials on the property. If he doesn't clean it up in
a reasonable amount of time, he could be fined as much as $1,918,
said John Gutwein, a county zoning official. If Cichy doesn't pay the
bill, he could face a lien against his property.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm emotionally distressed. I'm bummed out over this whole
thing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ayers said he's mediating "negotiations with Mr. Cichy and
interested parties to resolve the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Baggs, who lives in the Meadows community of Altadena and
has been in the forefront of the dispute with Cichy, said the
headstone's disappearance makes the situation all the more
complicated.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we have more reason to try to recover and restore the grave,"
he said.</TE>

<LD>A march sponsored by the Gay and Lesbian Community Service Center of
Orange County will go forward Aug. 17 in Costa Mesa, the organization
said Friday after agreeing on financial terms with the city.</LD>
<LD>   It's the first time the center will hold a march in Orange County.
The event--"The Orange County Dyke March"--will include a parade,
rally and party. Plans, however, were threatened because the city and
the group could not agree on fees.</LD>
<LD>   March organizers initially asked for a waiver or discount from the
$4,700 the city sought. The organizers cited such groups as the Lions
Club that received discounts for similar events.</LD>
<TE>   But officials discovered that the Lion's Club received only a
partial discount. The agreement reached Friday has the gay and
lesbian group paying $3,800.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure that everybody should be able to exercise
their rights as citizens and have a forum," said Bonnie Saryan, a
member of the Costa Mesa Human Relations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   March coordinators decided to pay the fees but chose not to
contract for 10 extra officers for two hours for the rally at Lions
Park before the parade. Eleven officers will direct traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The parade begins at Lions Park and ends near the Triangle Square
mall on Newport Boulevard.</TE>

<HD>Gerhard Wessel, 88; Did Espionage Work for Hitler, West

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gerhard Wessel, 88, a former intelligence officer in Adolf Hitler's
anti-Soviet spy operations who later became chief of the West German
intelligence agency, died of undisclosed causes Sunday at his home in
the Bavarian town of Pullach, Germany.</LD>
<LD>   Wessel served as president of the intelligence agency, which is
known by its German initials BND, from 1968 to 1978. He is credited
with modernizing the BND by hiring academic analysts and electronics
specialists.</LD>
<LD>   During his tenure as head of BND, the agency informed the West
German government three months in advance of the Soviet Union's plans
to invade Czechoslovakia in 1968.</LD>
<TE>   Wessel was born in 1913 in Neumunster in northern Germany. During
World War II, he analyzed the movements of Soviet troops while
serving in the German army's central command.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he worked for U.S. intelligence and in industry.
Beginning in the early 1950s, he played a part in expanding the new
West German army and its counterespionage unit.</TE>

<LD>Ted Rose, 61, a watercolor artist whose five images of Depression-era
streamlined locomotives were printed on 33-cent postage stamps issued
in 1999, died of cancer July 26 in Santa Fe, N.M.</LD>
<LD>   Rose, who was known for realistic watercolor portrayals of 20th
century American landscapes and industrial culture, had been
commissioned by the U.S. Postal Service to create five original
designs for its "All Aboard!" stamp series.</LD>
<LD>   Rose worked almost exclusively in watercolor, and many of his
paintings echoed railway themes. Two years ago, Indiana Press
published his book "In the Traces: The Railroad Paintings of Ted
Rose."</LD>
<TE>   The Milwaukee-born Rose majored in fine arts at the University of
Illinois. Drafted into the Army in 1963, he spent a year in South
Vietnam as a military policeman.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Santa Fe in 1966 and worked for the city as a mapmaker
and self-described graphic jack-of-all-trades before becoming a
freelance graphic designer in the 1980s. In 1989, he quit to devote
himself full time to painting.</TE>

<HD>Defense Attacks Patty Hearst's Credibility</HD>
<DH>Courts: Attorneys for four 1970s radicals accused of murder
claim her memories are patchy, but prosecutors stand behind their
star witness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Attorneys for a group of 1970s radicals accused of killing a suburban
homemaker a quarter-century ago continued their push Friday to
undercut the government's star witness--newspaper heiress Patricia
Hearst Shaw.</LD>
<LD>   As a Nov. 12 preliminary hearing was set for the four former
Symbionese Liberation Army members charged with the shotgun murder of
Myrna Opsahl, 42, defense attorneys said the upcoming trial would
hinge on Hearst's believability.</LD>
<LD>   They contend that Hearst's recollections were clouded after she
was kidnapped by the SLA and, claiming to be brainwashed, joined its
ranks.</LD>
<TE>   Past mental evaluations concluded that Hearst's memories were
patchy and that she was prone to fill the gaps with hearsay, the
attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   "Without credible testimony from Patty Hearst, there is no case,"
defense attorney Charles F. Bourdon said after Friday's hearing.
"This is all about Patty Hearst."</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Thomas M. Cecil also accepted formal not
guilty pleas Friday from Emily Harris, who now goes by the name Emily
Montague; her former husband, William Harris; and Michael Bortin.
Sara Jane Olson, who has already pleaded not guilty, is serving
prison time for a Los Angeles bomb-planting case, and was not in
court Friday.</TE>
<TE>   All four are accused of the April 21, 1975 robbery of Crocker
National Bank in suburban Carmichael that left Opsahl dead.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst has admitted to being a getaway driver in the robbery, but
her account--painstakingly rendered in a 400-page autobiography and
past grand jury testimony--has been rejected by the defendants as a
fabrication.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, who have declined to comment while the case is
underway, argue in court papers that Hearst shows no signs of mental
incompetence and is being subjected to a defense tactic designed to
undermine her credibility.</TE>
<TE>   They also contend that much of her account of the events has
largely been corroborated by independent evidence and testimony.</TE>
<TE>   The defense postponed two requests to the court: to gain access to
Hearst's psychiatric records and for a new mental examination to
determine her competency as a witness.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the lawyers said they will continue a push for her mental
health records from the FBI and other government agencies, including
documents Hearst submitted to the White House to win clemency and an
eventual pardon by former President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Bourdon said the defense hopes those documents will buttress a bid
before the trial for a new mental examination of Hearst.</TE>

<HD>Groups Try Again to Halt Port Project</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIN CHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Environmental and community groups on Friday tried once more to
persuade a court to halt construction of a new terminal in the Port
of Los Angeles--a project that, the groups fear, would generate more
pollution in an area already plagued by poor air quality.</LD>
<LD>   A state appellate court heard arguments for three hours on an
emergency request to halt the project, which is being built within
500 feet of San Pedro homes.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the coalition of environmental and community groups
lost a bid in federal court to stay construction of the 174-acre
China Shipping and Holding Co. terminal.</LD>
<TE>   The court is expected to rule on the emergency request Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In a related matter, the state appellate court also agreed to hear
arguments in October in a coalition lawsuit that alleges the project
is being built without proper environmental reviews.</TE>
<TE>   In arguing for the stay Friday, attorney Gail Ruderman Feuer of
the Natural Resources Defense Council, the lead agency in the
coalition, called for construction workers to "put down their tools."
Waiting for hearings in October would be too late, she said, because
the project, which is 60% complete, would probably be finished by
then.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's hearing is connected to the lawsuit the coalition filed
last year in Los Angeles County Superior Court seeking assurances
that state environmental reviews are properly completed on the
terminal. A lower court last year ruled against the group, which also
includes the San Pedro and Peninsula Homeowners Coalition, San Pedro
Peninsula Homeowners United Inc. and the Coalition for Clean Air.</TE>
<TE>   The terminal, the product of a $650-million lease arrangement with
the city of Los Angeles, is scheduled to be built in three phases and
is to include two bridges, 10 cranes and two wharves.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition's main concern is that China Shipping was given
permission to build Phase 1--a 1,200-foot-long wharf--without an
assessment of the cumulative effect of the entire project, which
Feuer called an egregious violation of the California Environmental
Quality Act.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Zischke, attorney for the Port Authority, argued that a
1997 review had taken Phase 1 into account and that reviews for the
other two phases would be performed later. Also at issue, attorneys
said, is the money the port and city could lose if the project is
halted--about $25,600 a day.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of San Pedro residents attended Friday's hearing and wore
buttons reading "Clean Port Now!"</TE>

<HD>Sentence in Teen's Death Is 6 Years</HD>
<DH>Crime: Neighbor escapes the maximum term in a case that
started with youth's theft of a Halloween decoration in Buena Park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Buena Park man convicted of fatally shooting a teenage neighbor who
stole a plastic Halloween decoration from his front porch was
sentenced Friday to six years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   The sentence is less than the 11-year maximum Peter Tavita
Solomona could have received and was met with cheers from his family.</LD>
<LD>   It came after a jury rejected second-degree murder charges against
Solomona, 50, and convicted him of involuntary manslaughter.</LD>
<TE>   Determining a proper punishment for Solomona consumed three juries
over four years, and all sides said Friday they are glad the legal
drama is over.</TE>
<TE>   At one point during Friday's emotional hearing, Solomona's wife,
Fui, turned to the family of 17-year-old Brandon Ketsdever and said:
"I am really sorry.... I know you are in pain just like we are in
pain."</TE>
<TE>   Ketsdever's parents urged the court to impose the maximum
sentence. They placed pictures of their son on a poster showing him
swinging a baseball bat, in swim goggles, in a football uniform and
in a tuxedo at the prom.</TE>
<TE>   Their son "never had a mean bone in his body. The one time he did
something he shouldn't have, he was murdered for it," his father, Jon
Ketsdever, said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our son paid with his life," he said. "Our family and friends
will pay for the rest of our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Superior Court Judge Richard F. Toohey said he was
trying to strike a balance in the sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not here to give anyone a break or send a message," he said.
"The conduct of Solomona has left two families in ruins. He ... acted
in disregard for life."</TE>
<TE>   Ketsdever's parents left the courtroom immediately after the
verdict was read. His uncle said everyone wants to move on.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a long and arduous journey through the court system,"
Jeff Ketsdever said. "I'm glad we're finished."</TE>
<TE>   Ketsdever was a popular high school athlete at John F. Kennedy
High School in La Palma. He was pulling pranks with a group of
friends one night when Solomona confronted the group in the street
outside his home.</TE>
<TE>   Solomona, who carried a .357-magnum revolver, told jurors he was
banging the gun against the roof of Ketsdever's car, trying to get
the boy's attention, when the gun went off. Prosecutors alleged that
Solomona fired at Ketsdever in a rage.</TE>
<TE>   Solomona was convicted of murder in his first trial, but a judge
threw out that decision, saying jury instructions were flawed. A
second trial, in December, ended in a hung jury. In his third trial,
jurors deliberated four days before reaching a decision in May.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Carolyn Carlisle-Raines said she hopes the case
sends a message.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that can give meaning to this death is that the
next time a person gets angry at another person, disrespects them,
cuts them off on the freeway, they will remember ... it's wrong to
react in a way that places someone's life in danger," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Solomona's attorney, Milton Grimes, said the sentence was too
harsh.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel this case is a probation case," he said. "It's the most
this man deserved. It was an accident, so it bothers me. He used the
gun to get attention, not in a threatening manner."</TE>
<TE>   In a 22-page sentencing report written by the Orange County
Probation Department, officials recommended against granting Solomona
probation, noting the seriousness of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   The report contains more than 10 letters of support from
Solomona's friends and family, as well as co-workers at the Pepsi
plant where he worked. They described him as a caring parent who also
volunteered at a food bank.</TE>
<TE>   "The case has some complexities. As a father, one cannot help but
feel for [the victim's] father," Toohey said. "On other hand, we got
a lot of letters speaking to the defendant's character."</TE>
<TE>   As a deputy led Solomona out of the courtroom Friday, one of his
relatives yelled, "Bye Pete, we love you!"</TE>

<LD>No sleep-inducing drugs were found in the blood of a Simi Valley man
whose wife and stepdaughter are accused of trying to kill him in his
bedroom four months ago, a toxicologist testified at their trial
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Eileen Childs, 37, and her daughter, Jennifer Childs, 19, are
charged with setting fire to 57-year-old Larry Childs' mattress and
then beating him with baseball bats.</LD>
<LD>   According to court testimony, Jennifer Childs made a milkshake for
her stepfather before he went to sleep on March 25. Prosecutors have
suggested she might have slipped a sedative into the drink.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, forensic scientist Dea Boehme, who supervises the
toxicology division of the Ventura County crime lab, testified that
no drugs had been found in Childs' blood.</TE>

<LD>A march sponsored by the Gay and Lesbian Community Service Center of
Orange County will go forward on Aug. 17, after the organization and
city officials agreed on financial terms Friday.</LD>
<LD>   It's the first time the center will hold a march in Orange County.
The event will include a parade, rally and party. Plans, however,
were threatened because the group sought a fee waiver or discount
from the $4,700 that the city sought. They cited groups such as the
Lions Club that receive fee discounts for similar events.</LD>
<LD>   Under the agreement Friday, the center will pay $3,800.</LD>

week to discuss the problem and how to make bases and surrounding
communities more compatible.</LD>

community groups is helpful, and that bases should be considered in
land-use planning.</LD>

<LD>The tab for strengthening the state's toll bridges against
earthquakes, a job already costing twice initial 1990s estimates,
could rise an additional $630 million and imperil other
transportation projects, a new state audit warns.</LD>
<LD>   The audit, released this week, chronicles how a $2.2-billion
project to retrofit seven major bridges by 2004 has turned into a
$4.6-billion project that will take until 2009.</LD>
<LD>   According to the audit, most of the cost overruns and delays stem
from a single development--a $1.3-billion "signature" upgrade for the
new eastern span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.</LD>
<TE>   Bay Area bridge tolls doubled in 1998 from $1 to $2 to pay for the
upgrade, and will continue to 2038, long beyond their original 2008
expiration date.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It quickly became a case of the boosted barbecue when Calaveras
County authorities arrested a woman on suspicion of stealing a hunk
of tri-tip steak off the outdoor cooker of her neighbor.</LD>
<LD>   The call to the Sheriff's Department came at 6:15 p.m. Wednesday
from a woman who said she briefly turned away from the grill only to
return and find her tri-tip gone.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said they didn't need to bring in the bloodhounds to
solve the case of the missing meat.</LD>
<TE>   "It had been stolen, and a trail of meat juice was followed to the
next-door apartment," Deputy Blain Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies said they found the partly cooked meat on a bathroom
counter in the apartment occupied by Lindsey Blackledge, 19. She was
arrested on suspicion of receiving stolen property.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Accused of Pushing Firms to Give to Anti-Secession
Fund</HD>
<DH>Politics: Assemblyman running for mayor of proposed Valley
city says L.A. mayor is using 'shakedown' tactics. Also, black
leaders are briefed on new study.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Assemblyman Keith Richman, a candidate for San Fernando Valley mayor,
accused Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn on Friday of using
"shakedown" tactics to pressure city contractors to contribute money
to his anti-secession campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Richman, a Northridge Republican, said much of the nearly $2
million raised by Hahn for the campaign against the Valley and
Hollywood cityhood measures has come from firms and individuals with
business ties to City Hall.</LD>
<LD>   "They raised this money in one of the most arrogant and brazen
shakedown schemes in recent political history," Richman said during a
news conference outside the headquarters of the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power.</LD>
<TE>   He singled out a $10,000 contribution from Fleishman-Hillard Inc.,
a public relations and marketing firm, that last month received an
$800,000 extension of its $15.3-million, three-year contract with the
DWP.</TE>
<TE>   Richman said "it speaks volumes that a top-flight marketing firm
feels it necessary to contribute to the mayor's favorite projects in
order to get city business."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's office and Fleishman-Hillard representatives said there was
no link between the contract extension and the contribution.</TE>
<TE>   "There is never a quid pro quo in anything Jim Hahn does," said
Kam Kuwata, a political advisor to the mayor. "He makes his decisions
based on the merits."</TE>
<TE>   Doug Dowie, an executive at Fleishman-Hillard, said Richman's
accusation was "absurd."</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a contract with the DWP before Keith Richman ever heard
the word secession," Dowie said.</TE>
<TE>   Richman questioned the value of the contract itself. As a virtual
monopoly in Los Angeles, he said, the DWP does not need to spend $16
million on marketing and advertising.</TE>
<TE>   The assemblyman said the money could go toward hiring police
officers and filling potholes.</TE>
<TE>   Richman also raised questions about $5,500 in contributions to the
anti-secession campaign from executives of Capital Vision Equities.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the city redevelopment board approved, with the
mayor's strong support, an infusion of $42 million in public funds
for a retail and commercial project developed by Capital Vision
Equities in the Crenshaw area.</TE>
<TE>   "Look up and down the list of donors to the mayor's
committee--almost all the large-scale donors on that list stand to
make a lot of money from having Jim Hahn in their back pocket,"
Richman said.</TE>
<TE>   Kuwata said there was no relationship between Hahn's support for
the Capital Vision subsidies and the contributions.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's anti-secession drive had raised $1.93 million as of
June 30, compared with about $75,000 raised by the Valley
independence campaign. The Hollywood breakaway movement has brought
in roughly $160,000.</TE>
<TE>   Richman is the only well-known candidate for Valley mayor. The
filing period for candidates closes Aug. 9.</TE>
<TE>   The mayoral post and 14 Valley city council seats accompany the
secession measure on the Nov. 5 ballot. If secession loses, none of
the offices will exist.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a group of African American leaders on Friday was
briefed on a study by UCLA professor Eugene Grigsby that found
secession would hurt blacks politically and economically.</TE>
<TE>   The study was commissioned by Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke.</TE>
<TE>   The findings suggest that African Americans would have little
political clout in the Valley if it seceded.</TE>
<TE>   It also concluded that secession could give the Valley an
advantage in attracting high-tech and manufacturing jobs, to the
detriment of African Americans in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Burke and former Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, a Los Angeles City
Council candidate, said they have still not taken a position on
Valley secession, and will wait to do so until the study is finalized
in September.</TE>
<TE>   They were among those briefed on the study.</TE>
<TE>   Secession supporters have dismissed the study as flawed and
biased.</TE>

<HD>Much Ado About Festival's 20th Year</HD>
<DH>Theater: The season is extended as young Shakespearean
players graduate to the main stage at Ojai's Libbey Bowl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a summer of milestones for the Ojai Shakespeare Festival.</LD>
<LD>   As the community-based theater group celebrates its 20th
anniversary, the troupe's student internship program will make its
stage debut with a production of "The Tempest."</LD>
<LD>   In years past, the young Shakespearean actors have performed on
the grassy area above Libbey Bowl in Ojai, but director Ryan Lee said
they have earned the privilege to perform on the stage.</LD>
<TE>   " 'The Tempest' is a hard play to do; it's dense and has to do
with complex adult issues," said Lee, 31, a Los Angeles actor who is
the intern program's play director for the second time. "People are
going to come away from this play and realize the kids can do a lot
more than you think."</TE>
<TE>   Lee has starred in the festival's adult productions since 1998 but
will take a lesser role in this year's play.</TE>
<TE>   The student program has been evolving over the last 13 years, said
festival President Dave Farber of Ojai. At first, students studied
the technical aspects of play production, but in 1997 acting and
singing programs were added.</TE>
<TE>   "When the kids start, they have the usual fear of Shakespeare
because of the odd language. But the productions always end up being
really good," Farber said. "We have some very talented kids."</TE>
<TE>   Interns must submit an application, write a one-page essay
describing why they want to participate in the program and go through
an interview and audition.</TE>
<TE>   This year's crop of 32 interns, ranging in age from 12 to 18, come
from Ojai, Oak View, Oxnard, Ventura and Carpinteria.</TE>
<TE>   They can focus on acting, singing, or both, said festival artistic
director Jaye Hersh, who has been with the troupe for 14 years. She
is performing in the adult production of "Twelfth Night."</TE>
<TE>   The cost for the nine-week internship, which includes six weeks of
rehearsal and three weeks of performance, is $300.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the kids work it off by helping out with the sets and
costumes, and we also have a scholarship fund set up," Hersh said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the students have been with program for three to five
years.</TE>
<TE>   "The great thing about having repeat kids is that their level of
understanding goes up every year," said Hersh, whose 12-year-old
daughter, Kelsey, is the youngest of the interns. "Some of these kids
have done five Shakespeare plays and then been exposed to five more
through the adult productions."</TE>
<TE>   Rosie Gordon, 17, has participated in the program since she was
11. Now in her sixth season, the Ojai girl rattled off a handful of
reasons why she keeps coming back.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the attention. I love to act. I get a sense of
accomplishment from it, especially with Shakespeare. I love theater
people, and I love the backstage smell of sweat and makeup," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rosie is cast as the spirit Ariel in the current production. She
hopes to continue acting after completing her senior year at Ojai
Valley School.</TE>
<TE>   Rosie said she is excited about graduating from the grass to the
stage.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't sure about it at first, but it will feel much more like
a professional show," she said. "With the set and the lights, it will
be a good experience. It's very empowering."</TE>
<TE>   Zach Farber, 16, has been participating in the intern program for
five years, but this is his second time as an actor.</TE>
<TE>   The Nordhoff High sophomore will play Alonso, the king of Naples.
He said he enjoys acting, but singing in a group is easier on his
nerves.</TE>
<TE>   "With singing, it's harder to notice if you mess up," said Zach,
who is Dave Farber's son. "But being in front of an audience is
really a rush."</TE>
<TE>   The student production opens Thursday, with performances Thursdays
at 8 p.m. and Saturdays and Sundays at 4 p.m. through Aug. 18.</TE>
<TE>   The adult production continues at 8 p.m. Fridays, Saturdays and
Sundays through Aug. 18.</TE>
<TE>   The season was extended one week to commemorate the 20th
anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   Cast and crew members from the last 20 years were invited to
Saturday's performance and an alumni party afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets for both plays can be purchased at the box office in
Libbey Park or by calling 646-9455.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets for "The Tempest" are $8, with children younger than 5
admitted free.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets for "Twelfth Night," are $15 to $18 general, $8 to $14 for
seniors and students, and free for children younger than 12.</TE>

<HD>Dr. Laszlo Tauber, 87; Holocaust Survivor, Physician,
Developer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Laszlo N. Tauber, a Hungarian-born surgeon who risked his life
treating sick and wounded fellow Jews during the Holocaust and later
built a thriving surgical practice and made a fortune in the
Washington, D.C., real estate market, has died. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Tauber, who became the first practicing physician to be named to
Forbes magazine's annual list of the 400 richest Americans, died of
congestive heart failure Sunday at his home in Potomac, Md.</LD>
<LD>   Tauber, who arrived in the United States with little more than
$700 after the war, later used a small loan to begin buying and
developing properties for office, retail, government and apartment
buildings in Washington and elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   He went on to become the federal government's largest private
landlord, with more than 4 million square feet leased to various
agencies. A few years ago, estimates of Tauber's wealth exceeded $1
billion.</TE>
<TE>   For Tauber, real estate meant independence to practice general
medicine and surgery as he wished. In addition, he established his
own hospital in 1965, the now-closed Jefferson Memorial Hospital in
Alexandria, Va., where he served as chairman of the department of
surgery and medical director.</TE>
<TE>   "Medicine is still my life," he told the Washington Post a decade
ago. "I spend 5% of my time on real estate and 95% on medicine.
That's the most important to me."</TE>
<TE>   Giving was also important to Tauber, who donated tens of millions
of dollars to medical research, education and Holocaust-related
causes. He also was known for serving patients regardless of their
ability to pay.</TE>
<TE>   During his first year in the United States after World War II,
when his annual income was only $1,600 and he and his wife were
living in a decrepit apartment, Tauber gave away the $250 he had
managed to save.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a Hungarian Jew who survived the Holocaust," he wrote in a
note to officials at Walter Reed Army Hospital, where many wounded
war veterans were still recovering. "As a token of appreciation, my
first savings I would like you to give to a soldier of your choice."</TE>
<TE>   By 1999, Tauber had donated more than $25 million to medical and
Holocaust-related causes. That year, he gave $15 million for
scholarships to descendants of anyone who had served in the U.S.
military during World War II. He also donated $10 million in honor of
Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of
Hungarian Jews, to organizations that memorialize the Holocaust and
to students in Denmark and Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   Tauber was known for his strong sense of loyalty. In America,
Israel and Hungary, he sought out scores of Jews and "righteous
Gentiles" from his past and supported them with monthly checks. His
loyalty, generosity and drive were firmly rooted in Hungary, a past
he rarely discussed publicly.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Budapest in 1915, only two months after his father was
killed in World War I, Laszlo Nandor Tauber was an exceptional
student and gymnast; he won Hungary's "best sport student" award at
14. He traced his will to win to a meet in 1927, when he was a member
of a gymnastics team at the Budapest Jewish High School.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was standing, singing the Hungarian national anthem, and
people started throwing rotten apples at my team, yelling, 'Dirty
Jews,' " Tauber recalled in a 1999 interview with the Post. "I
thought to myself: 'I will train. I will beat them. I will show
them.' "</TE>
<TE>   He did, becoming a national and European champion in less than two
years.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I competitive? Yes, unfortunately so," he said. "Did I become
a happier man? Definitely not. But my experiences made me always
stand for the underdog."</TE>
<TE>   He earned a medical degree from the University of Budapest in
1938. During the war, Tauber's brother, Imre, died in a Russian
forced labor camp, but the lack of doctors in wartime Hungary helped
keep him from suffering the same fate.</TE>
<TE>   When the Nazis occupied Hungary in the spring of 1944, Tauber was
a resident in general surgery. He began working in what had been
called the Jewish Hospital, but which was renamed the International
Red Cross Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   After the Nazis began a special operation to liquidate Hungarian
Jews in the fall of 1944, he helped transform his former high school
into a makeshift hospital, where he frequently performed surgeries on
wounded Jewish patients.</TE>
<TE>   Tauber, witnesses later said, often worked day and night and went
for long periods without eating or sleeping. When he did sleep, it
was on the concrete floor and without blankets. The patients, he
said, needed them more than he.</TE>
<TE>   One of the founders of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Tauber
was honored in 1995 as an unsung hero of the Holocaust, receiving the
Red Cross' highest award, the Medal of Merit.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Tauber obtained a fellowship to study neurosurgery
in Sweden. In 1947, he and his wife, a German Jew, immigrated to the
United States, where Tauber obtained a teaching fellowship in
neurosurgery at George Washington University. In 1949, after opening
his own practice, he made a $1,500 down payment on his first
property, a four-unit apartment house in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Tauber's first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his
wife, Diane; a son, Alfred of Boston; a daughter, Ingrid, and a
stepdaughter, Rachael, both of San Francisco; and four grandchildren.</TE>

<DH>Ventura County: Major donor may cut gifts because he wasn't
told of decision to stop funding groups that ban gays.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>United Way of Ventura County could lose hundreds of thousands of
dollars in donations because of its failure to tell contributors
about a decision to stop funding groups that ban gays.</LD>
<LD>   One of its largest individual contributors, former United Way
board member Dennis Mark Weinberg, who gave $100,000 this year, said
he was not told by the nonprofit agency about the policy change
scheduled to take effect in September. He warned that he and others
might reduce or cut off their donations.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel like I was treated dishonestly," said Weinberg, an
executive vice president at WellPoint Health Networks who led the
company's most recent United Way appeal from September 2001 to May.
"Their funding future has changed, and we gave money not knowing
that. It seems like they were trying to make this change in the
shadows."</LD>
<TE>   Samuel L. Vernallis, chairman of the Ventura County United Way
Board of Directors, said the new policy--which bans funding to
agencies that discriminate--was approved unanimously last year by the
40-member panel. Agencies that receive money from United Way were
informed of the impending change, he said, but there was no reason to
tell donors because it did not affect their current contributions.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy mirrors an ongoing national debate between local
United Ways and the Boy Scouts of America, which bars gays as members
and Scoutmasters. At least 40 of the 1,400 local United Ways across
the country have adopted policies that bar them from giving money to
agencies that discriminate, said Philip Jones, public relations
director for United Way of America.</TE>
<TE>   The United Ways in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties have
similar policies on the books, said David Smith, director of the
United Way of Ventura County, which collected $5.2 million during its
most recent campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said he tried to continue his organization's relationship
with the Boy Scouts by offering to distribute money to its Learning
for Life career development program, which does not bar girls or
gays. But the Ventura County Council of Boy Scouts rejected the
offer, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Ventura County Boy Scouts could not be reached
for comment Friday, but Smith said the Scouts received about $50,000
this year from United Way.</TE>
<TE>   Recent donors will be notified by mail of the new policy before
the next appeal gets underway in September, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   About half a dozen employees at WellPoint, based in Thousand Oaks,
gave $10,000 or more, putting them among the top individual donors to
the United Way of Ventura County, Weinberg said. That makes them
members of the Red Feather Society, United Way donors who give $1,000
or more.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint executive Chuck Curry, vice president of advertising and
media, is a member but declined to say how much he donated.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm most disturbed by the fact that there was a position taken
and I wasn't aware of it before I actually made my donation," Curry
said. "Had I known, I may have had some concerns. I may have thought
differently; I may have behaved differently. I think it's a big
issue. It will affect next year's donation."</TE>
<TE>   Contributions are usually withdrawn from donors' paychecks through
corporate-sponsored campaigns that promise matching funds.</TE>
<TE>   Weinberg, with his wife, gives hundreds of thousands of dollars to
charity through the Dennis and Alice Weinberg Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Although Weinberg said United Way's actions may deter some
contributors, Smith said that others might decide to contribute for
the first time or to increase their donations.</TE>
<TE>   Weinberg said he is struggling with the question of whether to
give to the United Way in the future or to take his money and hand it
directly to the Boy Scouts. If he chooses the latter, it would be
with reluctance, he said, because he believes in the concept behind
the United Way.</TE>
<TE>   "The United Way has never been about politics, religion or social
points of view," Weinberg said. "It's about finding who is in need in
your community and getting the money to the people and agencies who
serve those needs."</TE>

<HD>22,000-Acre Blaze Near Ojai Blamed on Gunfire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A June wildfire that torched more than 22,000 acres above Ojai and
imperiled endangered plants and animals in the Sespe Wilderness was
sparked by people firing guns in dry brush just off California 33,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Although the cause of the blaze has been identified, officials
with the U.S. Forest Service have not identified any suspects and no
arrests have been made.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators are also still trying to track down witnesses who
were in the dry, grassy area when the fire started just before 3 p.m.
on June 1.</LD>
<TE>   The fire began about 100 feet from the Wolf Grill restaurant,
located on a winding stretch of California 33 about 12 miles from
Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   "We still don't know the exact mechanism that started the fire and
we want to determine the events leading up to the fire," said Kathy
Good, spokeswoman for the forest service.</TE>
<TE>   "Then we will look at who might be responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Those who started the blaze could potentially be asked to pay the
$15 million it cost to fight the fire, Good said.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation has been slowed in recent weeks because forest
officials have been pressed into service on several other wildfires
across the state, including the McNally fire in the Sequoia National
Forest, Good said. That fire has burned nearly 95,000 acres and cost
$15.8 million to fight.</TE>
<TE>   Although she was not accused of starting the Sequoia blaze
intentionally, a 45-year-old woman has been charged in federal court
with "willfully and without authority" igniting it with an illegal
campfire. If convicted, she could face prison time and a hefty fine,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Good said the Wolf fire was not sparked intentionally, but that
doesn't mean criminal charges won't eventually be filed.</TE>
<TE>   Fanned by hot, dry weather and churning winds, the wildfire jumped
California 33 in several locations and burned east across Los Padres
National Forest for more than two weeks before crews from across the
state and the nation put it out.</TE>
<TE>   Several members of a bicycling tour group reported that they saw
people shooting at an abandoned van in the area shortly before the
fire started. Days after the wildfire, the bullet-riddled
van--blackened by the flames--remained in the field surrounded by
yellow police tape.</TE>

<HD>Cardenas Seems a Shoo-In for New Council Seat in the Valley</HD>
<DH>Politics: Experts say the state legislator faces no serious
challengers for redrawn 6th District post that includes Van Nuys and
North Hollywood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For termed-out Assemblyman Tony Cardenas, who lost a Los Angeles City
Council election last spring, a new council district in the northeast
San Fernando Valley could be his consolation prize.</LD>
<LD>   With the nonpartisan primary election seven months away, Cardenas
has raised more than $50,000, his campaign says. And he faces no
serious challengers for the open seat, which was created July 1 to
give more clout to Valley Latinos and Latino politicians such as
Cardenas.</LD>
<LD>   Three other candidates have filed papers with the city Ethics
Commission to run for the council's 6th District seat. As of this
week, however, two of them said they were pulling out because they
live outside the new boundaries. One candidate remains, but has
indicated that he plans to raise less than $1,000 this year.</LD>
<TE>   In March, Cardenas lost his bid to represent the 2nd District in
the eastern San Fernando Valley. First-time candidate Wendy Greuel, a
film studio executive, beat him by 242 votes.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas, a Democrat who lives in Panorama City, now wants to
represent a Valley district that, until July 1, encompassed Los
Angeles' Westside: Venice, Marina del Rey and areas around Los
Angeles International Airport. Because of demographic shifts
uncovered by the 2000 census, council members voted to move the 6th
District and its term-limited councilwoman, Ruth Galanter, to the
predominantly Latino northeast Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The 6th District includes all or parts of North Hollywood, Van
Nuys, Panorama City, Sun Valley and Pacoima.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates for the seven City Council seats on the March 2003
primary ballot and the May 2003 general election have until early
November to enter the race, but observers of Valley politics predict
that the 6th District will be Cardenas' for the taking.</TE>
<TE>   "The demography of this district favors the election of a Latino
... and Tony is the most prominent Latino looking at the race," said
Larry Levine, a Valley political strategist.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas'communications director, Josh Pulliam, said the
three-term assemblyman's record in the Valley and Sacramento, along
with his name recognition, should fend off challengers.</TE>
<TE>   But, Pulliam added, whether the Valley should become its own city
is the dominant political question now. Once that's answered, he
said, next year's ballot might look different.</TE>
<TE>   "The voters have a lot to think about in November," Pulliam said.
"The next City Council is about the last thing on anybody's mind
right now." Cardenas opposes Valley secession.</TE>
<TE>   Finance reports filed this week reveal that many of Cardenas'
early contributors live and do business outside of his district;
Beverly Hills, Calabasas, San Jose and Chicago are among the
addresses. Cardenas received $1,000 from former U.S. Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros and his wife, who live in
San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas received $500 donations--the maximum--from unions
representing plumbers and food workers and $250 from a union of
sprinkler fitters.</TE>
<TE>   In separate filings, he reported $244,000 in debts from his
campaign against Greuel.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas' fund-raising for the 2003 election is not tops among the
30 council candidates who had to file finance reports this week.</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, for example,
reported collecting $157,000 since late May, when he announced his
candidacy for an open seat in South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   And in the north Valley, Greig Smith reported raising $112,000 to
succeed his boss of 23 years, termed-out Councilman Hal Bernson.</TE>
<TE>   Galanter's deputy chief of staff, Mike Bonin, and Venice resident
Sandra Bernard had planned to run for Galanter's seat before it was
uprooted. Both said Thursday that they are no longer running.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves Jose Bonilla of Arleta as Cardenas' only challenger.
Anticipating that the San Fernando Valley might become its own city,
Bonilla the Arleta man is also a candidate for a council seat in the
new city, according to papers he filed with the ethics commission.</TE>
<TE>   For L.A.'s council, Bonilla has filed a form indicating that he
does not expect to raise or spend more than $1,000 on his campaign
this year.</TE>

and team leader, agreed Friday night to a four-year, $32-million
contract extension.</LD>
<LD>   The extension, which is expected to be announced today, comes
seven months after the Angels nearly traded Erstad to the Chicago
White Sox and one month after Erstad said he would be willing to
forgo free agency and sign a deal to remain in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   The deal was finalized after the Angels' 4-0 loss to the New York
Yankees at Edison Field. General Manager Bill Stoneman could not be
reached for comment after the game.</LD>
<TE>   Jeff Moorad, the agent for Erstad, confirmed the deal and said
Erstad likely would have commanded a more lucrative deal had he
waited to test the free-agent market, even had he then decided to
stay with the Angels. Moorad said negotiations were quick and quiet,
started and finished within the past three days.</TE>
<TE>   "Darin felt that, if the team was willing to recognize his value,
even two months prior to free agency, it made sense to commit,"
Moorad said. "This was the only place he wanted to be. He's committed
to the organization in every way, from his relationships with his
teammates to his relationships with the fans who supported him during
his trying personal times. We're appreciative of the Angels for
stepping up to make this a reality."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad, 28, endured a horrific 2001 season, hurt by a knee injury
and also by going through a divorce. After hitting .355 with 25 home
runs two years ago, he hit .255 with nine home runs last season. He
is hitting .283 with six home runs and 15 stolen bases this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels nearly traded Erstad to the White Sox in December,
before Angel President Paul Pressler directed Stoneman to play to
win. Since that directive, closer Troy Percival retreated from his
vow to leave as a free agent and signed a two-year, $16-million
contract extension.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad is earning $6.25 million this season. Under the extension,
he will receive a $1-million signing bonus and annual salaries of $7
million in 2003, $7.5 million in 2004, $8 million in 2005 and $8.5
million in 2006. Each year, he can designate four teams to which he
cannot be traded.</TE>
<TE>   On the field, Andy Pettitte and Ramiro Mendoza combined on a
four-hit shutout before a sellout crowd of 43,668.</TE>
<TE>   Six days ago, the Angels flew home from Seattle with a
percentage-points lead over the Mariners. But, after Pettitte made
the Angels' bats disappear Friday on another lost evening, the
Mariners lead the Angels by three games.</TE>
<TE>   The loss dropped the Angels into a tie with the Boston Red Sox for
the AL wild-card lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels fancy themselves pennant contenders, but their offense
has not played at that level against the best of the rest of the
league. In the last seven games--all against Seattle, Boston and the
Yankees--the Angels have scored 10 runs. Five of those came in one
game, started by Boston's Casey Fossum.</TE>
<TE>   Pettitte is no slouch. There is no shame in losing to him, or in
scoring a total of five runs in games started by Pettitte, Pedro
Martinez, Tim Wakefield, Jeff Weaver, Jamie Moyer and Joel Pineiro.
But that is the caliber of pitcher the Angels must beat to get to the
playoffs, and to stick around if they do.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have now been shut out twice in four games and four
times since the All-Star break. They have been shut out eight times
this season, a total exceeded in the AL only by also-rans Baltimore,
Tampa Bay and Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees lead the league with 68 victories. They have been shut
out twice.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Appier, another start removed from his dreadful June,
pitched six innings, giving up three earned runs and striking out a
season-high seven. Appier (9-9) has delivered five consecutive
quality starts; his ERA is 2.91 over those five starts and 4.22
overall.</TE>

<HD>Sturtze, Devil Rays Shoved Around</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tanyon Sturtze took the blame for his dugout spat with Tampa Bay
Manager Hal McRae.</LD>
<LD>   McRae shoved Sturtze in the dugout after the pitcher was pulled
from the game and the Devil Rays went on to lose, 8-5, in 12 innings
to the Chicago White Sox on Friday night at St. Petersburg, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Sturtze was lifted after five innings with a 5-3 lead. He was
sitting in the dugout when McRae came over to talk with him. Sturtze
appeared to brush McRae as he got up to walk away, then pushed over
two water coolers.</LD>
<TE>   The second water cooler bounced off the dugout floor and hit McRae
in the leg.</TE>
<TE>   McRae caught up to Sturtze and shoved him in the back as the
pitcher was heading toward the clubhouse tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   The two met in McRae's office after the game, and afterward
Sturtze took full responsibility for the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "He had every right to shove me," Sturtze said. "I acted in a very
unprofessional way. It's me being frustrated. It has nothing to do
with Hal. It's totally my fault."</TE>
<TE>   McRae called the matter a nonevent.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a non-issue for me," McRae said. "We're OK with each other.
Everything is OK."</TE>
<TE>   Sturtze, who is 1-11 this season, gave up three runs and eight
hits in five innings, striking out two. He walked one, hit two
batters with pitches in the fourth and got a no-decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he needed to come out," McRae said. "He ran a high
pitch count (99). He was in jams. I was trying to win a baseball
game."</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays have led in 16 of Sturtze's 23 starts. In 151 2/3
innings, he has given up 186 hits and 67 walks. He led the AL in both
categories coming into the game.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Rowand had an RBI double off Jesus Colome (2-6) to give the
White Sox a 6-5 lead in the 12th. Two runs were added when Magglio
Ordonez was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded and Frank Thomas
walked on four pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 3, Cleveland 1--Bret Boone homered for the third
consecutive game to help Jamie Moyer win his third consecutive
decision as the Mariners won at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners (68-42) moved a season-high 26 games over .500 with
their longest winning streak since June 25-29.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Martinez also homered for the Mariners in the rematch of
last year's first-round playoff matchup.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 3, Oakland 1--Mark Redman outpitched Barry Zito at the
Coliseum, where the Athletics' ace hadn't lost a regular-season game
in 14 months, as the Tigers ended a five-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Redman (7-9) pitched seven innings of six-hit ball, striking out
five and working out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Zito's Oakland-record streak of 16 consecutive victories at home
ended, but Miguel Tejada extended his hitting streak to 22 games--the
longest in the AL this season.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 2, Kansas City 1--Rick Reed and four relievers combined
on a four-hitter, and Jacque Jones hit a leadoff homer as the Twins
won at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Reed (9-5) gave up four hits and one run in six-plus innings.
Second baseman Luis Rivas made a diving catch of Carlos Febles' liner
to thwart a seventh-inning threat.</TE>
<TE>   LaTroy Hawkins and Johan Santana combined to strike out the side
in the eighth, and Eddie Guardado pitched a hitless ninth for his
33rd save.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 9, Toronto 8--Gary Matthews Jr. hit a three-run homer
off closer Kelvim Escobar (5-6) in the ninth inning as the Orioles
rallied from a seven-run deficit to win at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Down 8-1 in the fifth, the Orioles scored two in the sixth, three
in the seventh and three in the ninth.</TE>

<HD>His Career a Bust</HD>
<DH>George Allen, who had many unusual seasons but never a
losing one as an NFL head coach, will be enshrined today</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Cincinnati Bengals are hapless losers, a team thoroughly
outclassed by the NFL's elite teams.</LD>
<LD>   That's essentially what Coach George Allen told his 1974
Washington Redskins. No offense to Cincinnati; the Bengals were
merely the opponents of the moment. Allen's message would have been
similar had the Redskins been preparing to play the Bears, Steelers,
Raiders, anyone. On cue, Allen's martial-arts instructor raised a
piece of wood with a large "C" painted on it.</LD>
<LD>   "This is how much I hate the Bengals," Allen growled, throwing a
piston-like punch that snapped the board in two.</LD>
<TE>   Instantly, he had everyone's attention.</TE>
<TE>   "But you've got to hate them more than that," he continued.</TE>
<TE>   The instructor now put two boards together and held them up. Allen
punched--thwack--and the boards didn't break.</TE>
<TE>   "OK," Allen gasped, using every ounce of strength to stifle a
scream, "let's go to individual meetings."</TE>
<TE>   (A frustrating footnote for Allen: He suffered a broken finger
punching the boards and the Redskins wound up losing to the Bengals.)</TE>
<TE>   Call him corny, call his fist-pumping gusto hokey, but Allen never
had a losing season, or even finished .500, as coach of the Los
Angeles Rams (1966-70), Redskins (1971-77); the U.S. Football
League's Chicago Blitz (1983) and Arizona Wranglers (1984); and Long
Beach State (1990).</TE>
<TE>   He was selected by the Seniors Committee for induction into the
Pro Football Hall of Fame today, after 24 years of eligibility and
more than a decade after his death. He will be enshrined with
quarterback Jim Kelly of the Buffalo Bills, receiver John Stallworth
of the Pittsburgh Steelers, tight end Dave Casper of the Oakland
Raiders and defensive lineman Dan Hampton of the Chicago Bears.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very bittersweet; he's not here," said Dr. Greg Allen, 48,
the coach's second son and a psychologist in charge of a drug and
alcohol program at UCLA. "It's going to feel like a eulogy. It's kind
of upsetting that he's not around to see this. That's going to be
hard emotionally. But for the Allen family [the ceremony] is going to
be great. It's going to be like a massive family reunion."</TE>
<TE>   The Hall of Fame Committee is composed of 38 media members, nine
of whom also are members of the Senior Committee. Longtime voter Ira
Miller of the San Francisco Chronicle said he voted against Allen
several times because of his 2-7 record in the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   "After I thought about it and talked to enough people, I realized
there were other contributions and swung around," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   It probably didn't help that Allen viewed reporters with such
contempt. He believed they should be supportive of their hometown
teams, not critical, and he was the first coach to close practice to
the media. It was one of his many firsts.</TE>
<TE>   He was the first to hire a special-teams coach, the first NFL
coach to use situational players such as pass-rush specialists, and
he was on the cutting edge in emphasizing weightlifting and proper
nutrition. He was a tireless worker who had a habit of calling
opposing coaches in their offices at midnight on the Wednesday before
they faced the Redskins. (If those coaches didn't answer, Allen
figured he already had the game won.) He also relished the chess
match of it all.</TE>
<TE>   "He worked hard," said Charley Casserly, general manager of the
Houston Texans who began his career as an errand boy for Allen in
Washington. "But a lot of times George left the light on in his
office whether he was there or not."</TE>
<TE>   Allen, who once coached Whittier College, began his NFL career
under George Halas as a defensive assistant with the Bears from 1958
through '65, then became head coach of the Rams in 1966, taking over
a team that had had seven consecutive losing seasons. The Rams went
8-6 in their first season under Allen, then won a division title the
next season with an 11-1-2 record. He was fired after the 1970
season, despite going 9-4-1.</TE>
<TE>   He moved on to the Redskins, where he loaded the roster with
older, crafty players nicknamed the "Over-the-Hill Gang." They went
9-4-1 in Allen's first season, and reached the Super Bowl a year
later, losing to Miami as the Dolphins completed a 17-0 season. By
the time Allen was fired in 1977, the Redskins had made the playoffs
three more times.</TE>
<TE>   Allen returned to the Rams in 1978, but owner Carroll Rosenbloom
fired him after two exhibition games.</TE>
<TE>   After coaching two seasons in the USFL, Allen returned to college
football in 1990 at age 72. He took over the Long Beach State
program, which had not had a winning season in four years, and led
the 49ers to a 6-5 mark. His players doused him with ice water in a
postgame celebration at the end of that season. Allen caught a cold
and never recovered. He died on New Year's Eve of 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Allen and his wife, Etty, were always fond of Southern California
and never sold the Palos Verdes home they had built in 1966. Etty
still lives there, and three of their four children live in the
state--Greg; Jennifer, a writer who penned a biography of her father;
and Bruce, senior assistant for the Oakland Raiders. U.S. Senator
George Allen (R-Va.) will deliver the acceptance speech for his
father, and Hall of Fame defensive end Deacon Jones will give the
introduction.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing I respected most about my dad is he really had the
courage of his own convictions," Bruce Allen said. "He did things
differently than other people, and, if he believed it was right, he
stuck with it."</TE>
<TE>   Even if it cost him a broken finger now and then.</TE>

<HD>Red Sox Give Rangers the Lowe Down</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Boston pitcher becomes AL's second 15-game
winner, giving up only two hits in seven innings of 13-0 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>Derek Lowe was nearly unhittable.</LD>
<LD>   Lowe gave up two hits in seven innings to become the AL's second
15-game winner as the Boston Red Sox beat the Texas Rangers, 13-0,
Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   "He's spoiled us a lot this year," Boston Manager Grady Little
said. "You have to bring your A-game against [the Rangers], and Derek
certainly had his tonight. It was fun to watch."</LD>
<TE>   Trot Nixon hit a three-run homer and a two-run shot, tying his
career high with five runs batted in. Brian Daubach also had a
two-run homer for the Red Sox, who recovered from a 19-7 loss to
Texas on Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers, who scored 36 runs the previous two days, were held
hitless until the fifth. Lowe (15-5) struck out four and walked one,
stretching his scoreless streak to 24 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big game," Lowe said. "After last night, we wanted to
put up as many zeros as we could early. I mixed my sinker in and out.
It's been a phenomenal year so far. I can't say I expected this, but
all the hard work has paid off."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland's Barry Zito was the first AL pitcher to win 15 games.
Johnny Damon also homered for Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe retired 14 of the first 15 Rangers--Alex Rodriguez was hit by
a pitch with two outs in the fourth. The right-hander got 10 on
grounders before Carl Everett's two-out single in the fifth. Lowe
finished with 14 groundball outs and lowered his league-leading
earned-run average to 2.13.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very efficient," Ranger Manager Jerry Narron said. "He
kept the ball down and had a great sinker. He was in control. We
faced a great pitcher tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Alan Embree and Bob Howry each pitched a scoreless inning to
finish the three-hitter, Boston's major league-leading 15th shutout.</TE>
<TE>   Texas has been blanked six times this year. The Rangers had gone
213 home games since they were shut out, a stretch dating to April 8,
2000, when they were blanked by Toronto's David Wells.</TE>
<TE>   "You know to look for pitches that are up, but his are always
down," the Rangers' Frank Catalanotto said of Lowe. "That's why he
gets so many groundball outs and why he's having the year he's
having."</TE>

<HD>Mondesi Likes His New Digs</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Former Dodger, who became a Yankee on July 1,
enjoys not being the focal point of his new team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those with long memories can still recall the sounds of profanity
echoing through the Dodger clubhouse.</LD>
<LD>   And the chants of "R-a-a-u-u-l, R-a-a-u-u-l" rolling through the
Dodger Stadium crowds.</LD>
<LD>   Those were the days when Raul Mondesi--who was once touted as the
next Willie Mays, the next superstar outfielder with a gun for an
arm, an anvil for a bat and wings on his feet--had instead turned
into a problem child for the Dodgers.</LD>
<TE>   They loved some of the numbers he put up. Twice he had 30 home
runs and 30 stolen bases in a season. What they didn't like was his
refusal to not swing at bad pitches, his unhappiness over lineup
switches, his reputation as a party animal and the feeling that he
was never going to reach his potential.</TE>
<TE>   It came to a head in 1999, when he expressed his feelings of
mistreatment by spewing profanities to reporters about Kevin Malone,
then the Dodger general manager, and Davey Johnson, then the Dodger
manager.</TE>
<TE>   Mondesi was traded in the off-season to the Toronto Blue Jays for
Shawn Green, leaving the Dodgers with no regrets.</TE>
<TE>   Nor are there any by Mondesi, who seems to have found a new life
and a new image with the New York Yankees after joining the club on
July 1 in a trade with Toronto for left-hander Scott Wiggins.</TE>
<TE>   When he came to bat against the Angels in the second inning of
Friday night's game at Edison Field, few chanted Mondesi's name, as
in the old days.</TE>
<TE>   He is almost an afterthought in New York, playing in the shadows
of Derek Jeter, Jason Giambi and Bernie Williams.</TE>
<TE>   But Mondesi doesn't mind.</TE>
<TE>   In the second inning Friday night, he got aboard on a bunt, raced
to third on a double by Nick Johnson and sailed home on a passed
ball.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the last time I bunted like that was in '95," Mondesi
said. "I'm not the big guy here, so I can do things like that."</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth inning, he was in pain after fouling a ball off his
foot but stayed in the game. Just after the All-Star break, Mondesi
crashed into a wall in Cleveland chasing a fly ball, injuring his
sternum and kneecap, but missed only two games.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his new-found resolve, Mondesi isn't putting up big
numbers at the plate. He began play Friday night hitting only .228
with 19 homers and 60 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "He's still trying to pull the ball too much," Yankee Manager Joe
Torre said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Mondesi: "I'm still trying too hard. But it will come. I
don't have to worry about hitting all the home runs now, with the
great guys on this team.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wants to play for the New York Yankees, and now I'm
getting the chance."</TE>

<LD>Adam Kennedy, in his third season with the Angels, is used to having
fans stop him around town. Now, with the Angels in playoff
contention, those fans are saying something more than, "Can I have
your autograph?"</LD>
<LD>   Said Kennedy: "There's some enthusiasm. Now they're actually
rooting for us. They're saying they're happy we're doing well and
they're proud of us. It's nice."</LD>
<LD>   Merchandise sales are up about 20% from last season, said Kevin
Uhlich, senior vice president of business operations. The Angels
expect to draw 2.2 million fans this year, he said, a modest mark but
one they have reached only twice in the last 10 years.</LD>
<TE>   With all four games of their weekend series against the Yankees
expected to sell out, the Angels on Sunday would tie the club record
of 10 sellouts in a season. The weekend attendance could threaten the
stadium record for a four-game series, set in 1983 when Anaheim
Stadium also was the home of the Rams and had another 20,000 seats.
The Angels and Kansas City Royals drew 173,347 for a series that
included a July 4 crowd of 63,132, the largest to see a
regular-season game in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   The Angel roster that year included Reggie Jackson, Bobby Grich,
Rod Carew, Doug DeCinces, Fred Lynn and current Angel assistant
general manager Ken Forsch. The Royals' roster included George Brett,
Frank White, Hal McRae, Dan Quisenberry, Willie Wilson and current
Angel pitching coach Bud Black.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scott Schoeneweis appears to have found a niche as a left-handed
relief specialist. In his last six appearances, Schoeneweis has not
given up a hit, pitching one-third or two-thirds of an inning each
time.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured, at some time in my career, I would be doing that,"
Schoeneweis said. "I didn't think it would be this early in my
career."</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis is happy to pitch in for now, but Manager Mike
Scioscia said he understands that the 28-year-old would rather start.
He said the displaced starter still could be effective in that role,
but there appears to be no room in the Angel rotation.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see a definite future for him as a late-inning lefty,"
Scioscia said. "There aren't many good ones."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Infielder Jose Nieves cleared waivers and was sent to triple-A
Salt Lake. General Manager Bill Stoneman said Nieves will play mostly
third base there; the Angels have prospects at shortstop (Alfredo
Amezaga) and second base (Chone Figgins). Stoneman said he did not
promise Nieves he would return when rosters expand in September.</TE>

<HD>Baffert Defends Appearance Fee</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Trainer says the $50,000 didn't influence his
decision to run War Emblem in Sunday's Haskell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trainer Bob Baffert said the decision to run Kentucky Derby and
Preakness winner War Emblem in Sunday's $1-million Haskell
Invitational at Monmouth Park was made "independent'' of the $50,000
appearance fee he is being paid by the New Jersey Sports and
Exposition Authority.</LD>
<LD>   A story in Thursday's Newark Star-Ledger reported that Baffert,
who had vacillated last week about whether War Emblem was going to
run in the Haskell or wait for Del Mar's Pacific Classic, was being
paid the fee and had also received the same $50,000 when Point Given
won the Haskell last year.</LD>
<LD>   "The decision to enter War Emblem in the Haskell Invitational at
Monmouth Park was made independent of the appearance fee paid to me
by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority,'' Baffert said in
a prepared statement released Friday. "The decision to enter the
horse was made by Richard Mulhall [the racing manager for the late
Prince Ahmed Bin Salman's Thoroughbred Corporation] and me after we
discussed options for the horse over several weeks.</LD>
<TE>   "I am concerned that the nature of the appearance fee has been
mischaracterized and that some might perceive that the fee influenced
our decision to enter. Upon additional discussion with the
Thoroughbred Corporation, we have decided that half of the fee will
be donated to the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation in memory of
Prince Ahmed Bin Salman.</TE>
<TE>   "Fees for public appearances and other promotional work are common
in other sports. In consultation with my clients, I will continue to
accept these fees in the future where warranted.''</TE>
<TE>   Baffert, who is going to be married for the second time today in
San Diego, is scheduled to fly to New Jersey on a private jet, then
continue on with new wife Jill to Saratoga for its annual horse
sales.</TE>
<TE>   The trainer, who has won the Kentucky Derby three times in the
last six years, is correct about appearance fees being common, but
not for horse trainers. Normally, in the sport, they have gone to
jockeys, making trips to places where they did not ride regularly or
by increasing the purse of a given race to attract a top quality
horse. In 2001, the Haskell purse was upped to $1.5 million and a
crowd of nearly 50,000 was there to see Point Given win for the final
time in a career cut short by injury.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to the Star-Ledger, George Zoffinger, the chief executive
of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, defended the
decision to reward Baffert.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a business decision,'' he said. "I'd do it for any trainer
if they had the top horse of the year.''</TE>

<HD>Reds' Bowden Fined for Remarks</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Bowden was fined an undisclosed amount Friday by Commissioner Bud
Selig, a day after the Cincinnati Red general manager compared a
potential baseball strike with the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   A statement issued by the commissioner's office called Bowden's
remarks "insensitive and inappropriate."</LD>
<LD>   With union head Donald Fehr close to completing his meetings with
players on the 30 teams, the union's executive board could set a
strike date later this month.</LD>
<TE>   "If players want to strike, they ought to just pick Sept. 11,
because that's what it's going to do to the game," Bowden said before
Thursday's game. "I don't think there's going to be a work stoppage.
I don't think anybody's that dumb.</TE>
<TE>   "If they do walk out, make sure it's Sept. 11. Be symbolic. Let
Donald Fehr drive the plane right into the building, if that's what
they want to do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore's Willis Roberts and Boston's Derek Lowe were among five
players suspended for their roles in a brawl last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts was suspended for seven games and Oriole teammate Melvin
Mora was suspended for four games by Bob Watson, baseball's vice
president in charge of discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe (five games) was among three Red Sox players suspended,
joined by Jason Varitek (four games) and Rey Sanchez (three games).
Boston pitching coach Tony Cloninger was given a two-game suspension.</TE>
<TE>   All those suspended appealed, meaning no suspensions can start
until after a hearing before Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating
officer.</TE>
<TE>   The suspensions for all except Sanchez were to start Friday.
Sanchez's was to begin Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Expo President Tony Tavares and General Manager Omar Minaya issued
a statement asking New York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner to
apologize for his criticism of the deal that sent Cliff Floyd to
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "We have acted appropriately all across the board and I think
that's why we're a little bit sensitive about these kind of comments,
especially coming from one of our own owners," Tavares said before
the Expo game against Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Floyd, acquired by Montreal from Florida after the All-Star game,
was traded from the Expos to the Red Sox on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "If Major League Baseball owns Montreal and they get [Floyd] and
[three] weeks later they trade him to our biggest competitor, that's
hard to believe," Steinbrenner was quoted as saying in Thursday's
editions of the New York Post.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Darren Lewis told the Cubs that he's retiring and won't
report to Pittsburgh, forcing the teams to rework the trade that sent
outfielder Chad Hermansen to Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs will send minor league left-handers Ricardo Palma and Tim
Lavery and cash to the Pirates, who also sent minor league outfielder
Aron Weston to Chicago. The trade began Wednesday as a one-for-one
deal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Texas Rangers put Juan Gonzalez on the 15-day disabled list
because of a strained ligament in his right thumb and purchased the
contract of infielder Donnie Sadler from triple-A Oklahoma.... The
Atlanta Braves put catcher Javy Lopez on the 15-day disabled list
because of an inflamed right shoulder and recalled catcher Steve
Torrealba from triple-A Richmond.... The Montreal Expos put
outfielder Wil Cordero on the 15-day disabled list because of a
strained calf....The Arizona Diamondbacks activated first baseman
Greg Colbrunn from the 15-day disabled list, replacing him there with
infielder Chris Donnels, who is sidelined because of a back
strain.... Right-hander Jon Lieber was put on the 15-day disabled
list by the Chicago Cubs because of right elbow tendinitis.... The
Tampa Bay Devil Rays reinstated Russ Johnson from the restricted list
and put him on the 15-day disabled list. Johnson left the team for
personal reasons July 6.... The Oakland Athletics released
left-hander Mike Magnante, a 12-year veteran.</TE>

<LD>Just induct, baby.</LD>
<LD>   Al Davis has made a record eight presentations to inductees at the
Pro Football Hall of Fame, and he would like to make a few more. The
Oakland Raider owner says several former Raiders continue to be
overlooked.</LD>
<LD>   "The only coach who has won two Super Bowls and is not in the Hall
of Fame is Tom Flores," Davis told the San Francisco Chronicle. "The
only quarterback who has won two Super Bowls and is not in the Hall
of Fame is Jim Plunkett.... That's impossible."</LD>
<TE>   Furthermore, Davis said, there's "no question" that punter Ray Guy
and wide receiver Cliff Branch also should be inducted.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who entered the Hall of Fame in 1992, will be in Canton,
Ohio, today for inductions that include former Raider tight end Dave
Casper, who will be presented by former Raider coach John Madden.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the only player Davis presented into the Hall
of Fame who didn't play for the Raiders?</TE>
<TE>   Famous advice: Miami Herald columnist Edwin Pope, who will be
inducted into the writer's wing of the Pro Football Hall of Fame
today, helped shape the future of the Miami Dolphins during a talk
with then-team owner and founder Joe Robbie in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Robbie confided to Pope that he had decided to fire coach George
Wilson and, before he could finalize the move, he needed to find a
successor. "How about Shula?" Pope suggested.</TE>
<TE>   That remark set into motion the hiring of Don Shula, who coached
the Dolphins to consecutive Super Bowl championships in 1972-73.</TE>
<TE>   You don't say: Former New York Yankee Don Larsen, to the San
Francisco Chronicle, on pitching a perfect game in the 1956 World
Series: "Not many people get to do something that's only been done
once."</TE>
<TE>   Lost and fowl: A rubber chicken covered with the autographs of
Vince Lombardi, Bart Starr and other Green Bay Packer legends was
lost for decades in a forgotten safe-deposit box before landing in
Wisconsin's unclaimed property division two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the one-of-a-kind piece of sports memorabilia was
finally reunited with the two sisters who own it. Said Wisconsin
state Treasurer Jack Voight: "It's gotten pretty hard, and it's not
as flexible as it used to be."</TE>
<TE>   Responded Dwight Perry of the Seattle Times: "In other words, that
chicken is no worse off than Paul Hornung."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1948, Cleveland Indian pitcher
Satchel Paige, who played for years in the Negro leagues, made his
first major-league start and went seven innings in a 5-3 victory over
the Washington Senators.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Wide receiver Lance Alworth, who played for the San
Diego Chargers and Dallas Cowboys. When Alworth was a rookie with the
Chargers in 1962, Davis was an assistant with the team.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Steve Spurrier will make his NFL coaching debut
tonight when his Washington Redskins meet the San Francisco 49ers in
the American Bowl at Osaka, Japan, and he's comparing it to what he
knows best--college football.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like a bowl game," said the former Florida coach.
"Sometimes those bowl games don't mean a heck of a lot in college.
You keep score. There's going to be a winner and loser."</TE>

<HD>Hearn Critical After Falling</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Laker announcer, 85, is hospitalized and
will undergo surgery because of cranial bleeding.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Legendary Laker announcer Chick Hearn was in critical condition at a
Northridge hospital Friday after he fell and hit his head in the
backyard of his Encino home, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles firefighters said Hearn, 85, sustained a head injury
and was rushed to the operating room for surgery on bleeding in the
brain caused by the 7 p.m. fall.</LD>
<LD>   His wife Marge was with him at the time of the accident, officials
said.</LD>
<TE>   "We were summoned by a neighbor's 911 call and arrived quickly to
discover Hearn to have sustained a serious head injury," L.A. Fire
Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn, who called a record 3,338 consecutive Laker games over 36
years, saw his streak end last season when he had to undergo heart
surgery to repair a blocked aortic valve Dec. 19. He suffered a
further setback when he fell during rehabilitation and suffered a
broken hip Feb. 17. Paul Sunderland filled in for him.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hearn was able to return to the Lakers in time to broadcast
the team's run through the playoffs to its third consecutive NBA
championship.</TE>
<TE>   Friday evening, a team of firefighters went to Hearn's star on
Hollywood Boulevard Walk of Fame and scrubbed it clean, expecting
that fans would soon be covering it with flowers, candles and
get-well messages.</TE>
<TE>   "Word of his injury hit us all deeply at the L.A. Fire
Department," Humphrey said. "Firefighters are joining in offering his
family sympathy."</TE>
<TE>   Kate Preston, a spokeswoman for Northridge Hospital Medical
Center, said officials there would have more information at noon
today.</TE>

<HD>No One Can Save Dodgers</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Quantrill gives up bloop double, error lets in
two runs, and Gagne never gets call in 3-1 loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Another tough assignment appeared to fit Dodger All-Star closer Eric
Gagne, who was eager as usual to accept.</LD>
<LD>   Gagne anticipated a call that wasn't made Friday night, and the
Dodgers were left to wonder if he would have made a difference in a
3-1 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies before 17,076 at Veterans
Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Jim Tracy decided not to summon his closer after Jeremy
Giambi doubled with two out in the eighth inning, sticking with setup
man Paul Quantrill to preserve a 1-0 lead, although he had used Gagne
many times in similar situations this season, including Thursday in
Cincinnati.</LD>
<TE>   "I was getting ready just in case," said Gagne, who said he wasn't
second-guessing Tracy. "I was warming up; just throwing a little
bit."</TE>
<TE>   It turned out to be wasted energy.</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill walked Bobby Abreu and then Pat Burrell sent a blooper
down the shallow right-field line that eluded right fielder Shawn
Green, enabling Doug Glanville, who ran for Giambi, to score the
tying run when the ball landed on the line and bounced into the
stands for a ground-rule double.</TE>
<TE>   "Right on the white," said Green, who planned to dive on the
artificial surface but couldn't get close enough. "Right on the
middle of the white."</TE>
<TE>   Travis Lee then grounded to third baseman Tyler Houston, who
hesitated in throwing, bouncing the ball past first baseman Mike
Kinkade, playing because Eric Karros came out for a pinch-runner in
the eighth. The error enabled Abreu and Burrell to score the go-ahead
and insurance runs.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul made great pitches," Tracy said. "He made great pitches to
Abreu; he made great pitches to Pat Burrell. Unfortunately, the ball
hit inches fair, and we're out of the inning with no worse than a
tie. Then we throw the ball away."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne has converted five of six save situations when he has
entered in the eighth. In four, he had one-run leads and runners in
scoring position. Gagne said he did not ask Tracy about his decision.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not my business--he runs the team," he said. "I don't know
anything about baseball anyway. What would I know? Other than I
wanted to go in. If he said I'm going in, I'm going in."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy also decided against using left-handed specialist Jesse
Orosco to face left-handed batters Giambi and Abreu, who combined are
hitless in four at-bats against him. Of course, the Dodgers didn't do
much to make his job easier, getting only five hits as Philadelphia
starter Vicente Padilla and Andy Ashby engaged in a pitchers' duel
for seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers loaded the bases with none out in the eighth but could
only get a run-scoring sacrifice fly from pinch-hitter Marquis
Grissom.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Manager Larry Bowa turned to his closer in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Mesa recorded his 31st save when pinch-hitter Adrian Beltre,
not in the starting lineup because of a sore left hamstring, fouled
out to end the game with Houston on first. Carlos Silva (3-0) got the
final two outs in the eighth after impressive young starter Padilla
was charged with one run in seven-plus strong innings.</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill (2-4) had some bad luck in failing to get the Dodgers to
Gagne in the ninth, and Ashby suffered in the process. The
right-hander worked seven shutout innings against the club he has
pitched for twice in his 11-year career.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers (60-49) dropped a season-high 5 1/2 games behind the
Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League West but remained a game
ahead of the San Francisco Giants in the wild-card standings. The
Phillies (52-56) have won three in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are 4-6 on a 13-game trip and 6-15 since the All-Star
break. They have lost eight games in the division standings in the
last 23 days.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Gagne could have provided a lift Friday to a team going the
wrong way faster each day.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt like we had the right guy [in Quantrill]," Tracy
said. "And it was important to get the ball to Eric for a three-out
save, if it's a 1-0 game. You bring Eric in there [after Giambi
doubled], and they flare one, then we're stuck with a tie game.
There's no room for error for him there."</TE>

<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>In a familiar story for Manager Jim Tracy, the Dodgers had only five
hits Friday in a 3-1 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies at Veterans
Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Tracy doesn't know what else to try to jump-start the club so late
in the season.</LD>
<LD>   "You've got guys to hit in the middle of your order, and those are
the guys that have to do it for you, it's that simple," he said. "I
don't know if you can overhaul it to the point that you've got guys
scattered all over the place. This is a very important time of the
year, where they want to come into this clubhouse and see stability.</LD>
<TE>   "They want to see the lineup, and know this is the way we do it
when we face a lefty, and this is the way we're going to do it when
we face a [right-hander]. Especially when you're 109 games into the
season. There's not a lot to overhaul. There's not a lot of different
directions that you can go in."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The club purchased the contract of right-handed pitcher Kevin
Beirne from triple-A Las Vegas and optioned left-hander Victor
Alvarez to Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dan Evans said the move was made because a starter
for the 51s is better suited to pitch earlier in games than Alvarez.
The Dodgers might need Beirne to provide support for Kazuhisa Ishii
today or Omar Daal on Sunday, because they're pitching on short rest
as a result of the team using seven pitchers in Thursday's 6-4,
13-inning loss to the Cincinnati Reds.</TE>
<TE>   Beirne was 10-3 with a 4.15 earned-run average for Las Vegas.
Alvarez had an 11.57 ERA without a decision in two appearances for
the Dodgers.</TE>

<HD>Discipline Isn't Likely for Gagne</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Vice president of umpiring says pitcher wasn't
trying to hit Dunn. Umpire may face repercussions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Dodger All-Star closer Eric Gagne should not be disciplined for
hitting a batter with a pitch Thursday in a loss to the Cincinnati
Reds, but the umpire who ejected Gagne could face repercussions for
his questionable judgment, a high-ranking Major League Baseball
official said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Although Ralph Nelson, vice president of umpiring, had only begun
reviewing the events that preceded the ninth-inning ejections of
Gagne and Manager Jim Tracy in the Reds' 6-4, 13-inning victory, he
quickly determined that umpire Dan Iassogna erred in ruling Adam Dunn
was intentionally hit after a two-run homer by Aaron Boone had cut
the Dodgers' lead to 4-2. Nelson agreed with the Dodgers, saying a
pitcher in that situation would not intentionally hit a batter,
bringing the potential tying run to the plate.</LD>
<LD>   Nelson and Jim McKean, supervisor of umpires, had a 45-minute
closed-door meeting with Tracy, General Manager Dan Evans and Dave
Wallace, senior vice president, at Veterans Stadium before Friday's
game against the Philadelphia Phillies. Nelson hopes to complete his
report on the incident next week, and Bob Watson, baseball's dean of
on-field discipline, would officially hand out a fine or suspension
against Gagne.</LD>
<TE>   However, although Gagne made contact with Iassogna, Nelson, who
has an influential voice in disciplinary matters, believes no further
action is warranted against Gagne or Tracy. He was not as certain
about what awaits Iassogna.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball has cracked down on pitchers throwing at batters, and the
current system forces umpires to use their judgment, but Nelson
believes a mistake was made.</TE>
<TE>   "I've already recommended to Bob that he not do anything to
Gagne," Nelson said. "Bob and I talk a lot in these kind of
situations, and that's my recommendation. I would say I feel strongly
about that. As far as [Iassogna] ... well, I'm not there yet. It's
too early."</TE>
<TE>   Watson said he would "follow Ralph's lead," adding that Gagne and
the Dodgers have already been punished. The team had a two-run lead
and its closer on the mound when Iassogna made his stunning call. The
Dodgers used four more pitchers, including starter Omar Daal, after
Gagne was ejected for the first time in his three-year career,
prompting Tracy to shuffle the rotation for the series against
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it cost them a game, it cost them a starting pitcher,
and there were a lot of other problems because of what happened,"
said Watson, who has reviewed tapes of the incident. "We can't give
them back the game. We can't give them back the extra innings of
pitching they had to use. They had to call up another pitcher, and
that creates a domino effect.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that they were put in a very difficult
situation, and it's not good for the game for us not to be our best
in all situations. That's why we're going to have to talk a lot about
what happened. My personal feelings are not going to enter into it,
but I've been in this game for about 38 years now, and I think we're
talking about a young umpire who didn't have the right instincts in
that situation."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne was encouraged by Watson's comments.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody makes mistakes," Gagne said. "If they're going to
[admit it] and just try make the best out of it, I'm happy about it."</TE>
<TE>   Evans, who said a "high school" umpire would recognize the error,
was pleased with the direction of the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm satisfied with the professionalism that they showed, being
here and openly discussing the situation with Jim, Dave Wallace and
myself," said Evans, who flew Friday from Los Angeles to attend the
meeting after contacting Nelson and Watson the moment Gagne was
ejected. "They needed to hear from us."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson spoke with umpire Gerry Davis, the crew chief Thursday,
after the game and again Friday. He interviewed Iassogna, a reserve
umpire from triple-A with extensive service in the majors, on the
phone, and plans to speak with him in person next week. Umpires have
been fined and suspended for their actions, but "this kid [Iassogna]
just genuinely, thoroughly, believed he did the right thing at the
time," Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   In deciding whether to discipline Iassogna, Nelson said he must
consider the difficult task umpires face in trying to enforce
baseball's mandate to crack down on on-field incidents. Moreover, the
rules permitted Iassogna to either eject Gagne or issue a warning.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with the rule is that it involves umpire judgment,"
he said. "It does put the umpire in a difficult situation, where he
has to put himself inside the brain of the pitcher, and that's a
difficult thing. In this particular case, you have a young umpire,
who both Jim Tracy and Dan Evans said is an excellent young umpire, a
good balls-and-strikes guy.</TE>
<TE>   "His instincts were that this was an intentional pitch, but I
think that Dan should have, in my opinion, had a little better sense
of this situation in the game. Obviously, had that been intentional,
the pitcher would have been bringing the tying run to the plate, and
that probably was not his intent."</TE>
<TE>   Iassogna has been in the rotation the last three seasons, and
Nelson said he has "400 or more major league games under his belt."
But he is not on the full-time staff, and was reprimanded for not

<TE>   "As much as anything else, we hope that the [Gagne] incident
becomes a source of instruction for the future," said Sandy Alderson,
executive vice president of baseball operations. "Each of these
incidents, whether they turn out perfectly or not, help us make the
right decisions in the future."</TE>

<LD>Steve Lowery, getting positive vibes from his victory in 1994, had
seven birdies to claim the second-round lead Friday in the
International at Castle Rock, Colo.</LD>
<LD>   Lowery, who began the day with 8 points under the modified
Stableford scoring system used in this event, overcame windy
conditions to score 13 points and boost his total to 21.</LD>
<LD>   Craig Barlow was second with 17 points, Mark Brooks had 15 and
British Open champion Ernie Els 14.</LD>
<TE>   First-round leader Steve Pate, who compiled 11 points on Thursday,
added none Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The scoring system awards 5 points for eagle, 2 for birdie, zero
for par, minus-1 for bogey and minus-3 for double bogey or worse.</TE>
<TE>   Among those missing the 36-hole cut were two-time winner Phil
Mickelson (minus-18), David Duval (minus-16) and defending champion
Tom Pernice Jr. (minus-11).</TE>
<TE>   Lowery's 21 points matches his total after two rounds in 1994,
when he defeated Rick Fehr in a playoff.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Playing her first five holes in five under par, Mhairi McKay shot
a seven-under 65 to take a one-stroke lead over local favorite Rosie
Jones after the opening round of the Wendy's Championship for
Children at Dublin, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Starting the afternoon round on the 10th tee, McKay parred her
first hole and then had a birdie, birdie, eagle and birdie on the
next four holes.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the top players skipped the tournament to prepare for next
week's final major championship of the year, the Women's British
Open. The missing players included seven of the tour's top 10
money-winners.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve-year-old amateur Michelle Wie of Honolulu shot a five-over
77.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hale Irwin had seven birdies over the final 12 holes and shot a
seven-under 64 to take a one-stroke lead over Gil Morgan after the
opening round of the Long Island Classic at Jericho, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Five golfers, including Bruce Fleisher, who has won this event two
of the last three years, and Lee Trevino, the gallery's favorite,
were at 66.</TE>

<LD>While Del Mar offers the San Clemente Handicap, a turf race without a
single graded stakes winner among its nine entrants, Saratoga's main
event could be the race of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Street Cry, arguably the best horse in the country now that Mizzen
Mast is sidelined for the rest of 2002, heads a field of six quality
older horses in the $750,000 Whitney Handicap at 1 1/8 miles.</LD>
<LD>   Best known in his younger days as a colt who had trouble closing
the deal--he finished second in five of his first eight
starts--Street Cry has become a machine at 4. He has won all three of
his starts this year by a combined 19 1/4 lengths, including a romp
in the $6-million Dubai World Cup and an easy score in Churchill
Downs' Stephen Foster Handicap in June.</LD>
<TE>   The 123-pound highweight and 4-5 morning-line choice, Street Cry
will be ridden by Jerry Bailey, who has won the Grade I four times.</TE>
<TE>   If Street Cry is to be beaten, the most likely candidates are
defending champion Lido Palace and Macho Uno. Left Bank's chances
were compromised when the speedy longshot Saint Verre was entered.
The other Whitney entrant is Unshaded.</TE>
<TE>   Lido Palace, who outfinished Albert The Great and Gander to win
last year's Whitney, should improve after finishing second in the
Suburban Handicap last month at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Macho Uno, the 2000 Breeders' Cup Juvenile champion and third in
the Suburban, has a new rider in Pat Day.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The ninth at Del Mar is a contentious optional
claimer that attracted a full field of 12.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Boeagle A. The 6-year-old Arabian gelding will try for
his fourth win in a row and 23rd in 45 starts in today's $10,000
Santa Rosa Arabian Handicap at six furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Kevin Krigger. The apprentice jockey got off to an
0-for-22 start at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A sixth-race trifecta keying Max Power on top
with Mythical Flyer, The Denver Dream, Calcupbound and Swim Away in
the two hole and all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Thursday): Previous day/meet total: 2/13. Money:
Previous day/meet total: $14/$91. Total money bet: $136.</TE>

<HD>Some Progress in Talks</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Revenue sharing and luxury tax still obstacles.
No meetings over weekend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein and Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Negotiators for baseball owners and players met for two hours Friday
and made progress on two issues, but they remain far apart on a
luxury tax and will resume talks on a new collective bargaining
agreement Monday in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Rob Manfred, baseball's executive vice president for labor
relations, said the union responded to some suggestions made earlier
in the week regarding minimum salaries and a benefit plan.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue sharing and a luxury tax, however, remain obstacles.</LD>
<TE>   "On the topic of revenue sharing, we have made a lot of
progress--we need to make a little more," Manfred said. "On the
luxury tax, I have a long way to go."</TE>
<TE>   The two sides will not meet this weekend, but Manfred
characterized the meeting calendar for next week as "an every-day
affair." When asked about steroid testing, Manfred said he expected
the union "to make a proposal responsive to baseball's drug policy"
next week.</TE>
<TE>   Union chief Don Fehr has been conducting briefings with all of the
clubs and has only one more to do, with the Boston Red Sox early next
week. It is expected that the union's executive board will then have
a conference call Tuesday or Wednesday, at which time they could set
a strike date. However, if the negotiations are producing progress,
the setting of a strike date could be delayed a week.</TE>
<TE>   "A strike date does create time pressure," Manfred said. "People
are making genuine efforts to get to an agreement without the need
for that."</TE>

<LD>Lisa Leslie dunks!</LD>
<LD>   (Oh, by the way, the Sparks lost.)</LD>
<LD>   Is this really progress for the WNBA? Now its players too can toss
up wild three-point shots and throw it down just like the guys and
forget about basketball fundamentals. Not an improvement in my book.</LD>

<TE>   Tuesday night Lisa Leslie became the first woman to dunk in a
professional basketball game. This is history, folks.</TE>
<TE>   When I got up Wednesday morning I immediately sought out the
sports page, knowing that there would be a huge picture of Leslie
dunking. I just knew it would be on the front page, above the fold.
But no. History was recorded in a wee picture below the fold with a
story on D3.</TE>
<TE>   It's no wonder the WNBA is struggling with attendance. When our
own home team paper does not give them the attention they deserve,
why should anyone else?</TE>
<TE>   Linda S. Keough</TE>
<TE>   Canoga Park</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am totally convinced that the sportswriters of America will
never give women's basketball, or any women's sport, proper attention
for one simple reason: They have a very hard time admitting that a
female can play a game better than they can.</TE>
<TE>   I have coached both boys' and girls' basketball at the high school
varsity level and I can honestly say that I enjoy working with the
girls much more than I ever did the boys and here's why:</TE>
<TE>   Girls want to learn how to play the game, boys want to be an ESPN
"SportsCenter" highlight.</TE>
<TE>   David Dove</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood</TE>

<TE>   You mean to tell me that I have been paying no attention to
women's basketball all these years, and during that time they weren't
dunking?</TE>

<LD>Where does Al Freemon of Los Angeles [Viewpoint, July 27] get off
complaining about the Soccer Daily Report? He says that 99% of L.A.
Times sports readers are not interested in hearing about soccer. If
this were true, then the amount of coverage soccer gets in the L.A.
Times sports page would actually be correct. That's because the Daily
Soccer Report is so small it probably only makes up 1% of the sports
page.</LD>

<TE>   In response to Mr. Freemon's letter, I would like to say that the
beauty of the sport is in fact in the eye of the beholder. Not
everyone is interested in the sport of soccer; however, not everyone
is interested in baseball, football, tennis, golf, hockey, horse
racing, etc., but each sport has the right to its own space. If you
are not interested in soccer, skip it, read about what interests you.
However, maybe you should try getting to know another sport before
you put it down.</TE>

<HD>The Trojan Family Remembers Marv Goux</HD>

<LD>There was no better Trojan than Marv Goux, both as a player and as a
coach. He put the fear of God in his players who'd rather die than
come to the sidelines if they missed a tackle and face Marv.</LD>
<LD>   I was privileged to hear him speak earlier this year when he
received an award. He was in rare form, exhibiting both humor and
courage. I am indebted to Marv for his part in all the wonderful fall
Saturday afternoons.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marv Goux was the driving spiritual force of the great Trojans
teams of the 1960s and '70s.</TE>
<TE>   He was my football father.</TE>
<TE>   Goux was a football man for the ages, football was his religion
and USC was where he worshiped, his cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   The "Fight On" spirit of the last half-century was a direct
by-product of Coach Goux's gladiatorial approach to the game. He
didn't say "let's win," he demanded annihilation.</TE>
<TE>   Goux created an intense modern-day mythology by convincing every
player that every game was the chariot race in "Ben Hur."</TE>
<TE>   First and foremost, he was a great communicator. Goux passionately
called on the ferocity of the human heart and got to the gut of the
guys. And by calling so clearly, so deeply, he blended all colors,
all races and all hearts into one of Cardinal and Gold.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal, he said, was our blood, what made us real--but never
show it to our enemies. Gold was what every man longed for and fought
for, gold made us rich.</TE>
<TE>   He was the most real and valuable man USC will ever have. He is
the red brick of the buildings. He is the mortar in the walls of
Troy.</TE>
<TE>   Hail, Marv Goux.</TE>

<HD>Should Tiger Have an Identity Crisis?</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have been a touring golf professional for the past 13 years. I have
played with every player mentioned in Bill Plaschke's July 28 story
"They Are Not Tiger Woods" and never thought of them as being African
American. They were just more guys I had to beat to continue my own
dream.</LD>
<LD>   I am a Jewish American, and probably one of the finest Jewish
golfers in the world. But you'll never hear me complain that Steven
Spielberg or Shawn Green aren't doing enough for me or other Jews.</LD>
<LD>   I am as broke as the next struggling golfer and would love to be
fully sponsored, but if I do get money to play I would hope it would
be because I can win, not because I am Jewish. Tiger does enough to
help children--it's not his responsibility to sponsor pro golfers. My
advice to all aspiring tour players, to quote PGA Tour Commissioner
Tim Finchem, "Just play better!"</LD>
<TE>   Jon Levitt</TE>
<TE>   Alhambra</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods is the best golfer ever. He is not a spokesman for the
NAACP or the National Women's Rights League. He is not responsible
for any other minority's rights. His foundation contributes to
charity. He cannot make everyone happy all the time. He handles the
spotlight brilliantly. Get off his back and let him play golf.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Synder</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Plaschke could have written his story about a struggling
black golfer without criticizing Tiger Woods, but not as many people
would have read it, right?</TE>
<TE>   Tiger must get thousands of requests for his time and money, so he
wisely channels aid through his foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Solving discrimination worldwide is not a job description for
being the No. 1 golfer. Right now, isn't it enough that he is a
superb athlete and a gentleman?</TE>
<TE>   Angeline Romito</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Woods</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods is not Joe Louis, Muhammad Ali, Jackie Robinson,
Arthur Ashe, Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, Sugar Ray Robinson,
Magic Johnson, Tommie Smith, John Carlos, Kobe Bryant or Shaquille
O'Neal. Nor is he Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Harry Belafonte,
Denzel Washington, Will Smith, Bill Cosby or Jesse Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods is, on the other hand, Tiger Woods. Is this OK? Are we
willing to let him be Tiger Woods?</TE>
<TE>   Rev. Malcolm Boyd</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even if Tiger Woods were African American (which isn't clear, nor
even important), that wouldn't obligate him to associate with other
African American golfers just because they're African American.</TE>

articles like this where the sole intent seems to be to promote
racial discontent.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Growing up a Phillies' fan in Southern California was not easy. After
the back-to-back NL championship series losses to the Dodgers in the
'70s, there was no limit to the grief I got from my friends. I used
to say that I rooted for the Phillies and whoever is playing the
Dodgers. Well, from now on I will root for the Phillies and whoever
is playing the St. Louis Cardinals.</LD>
<LD>   First God told J.D. Drew not to sign with the Phillies, then a
thin skin led Scott Rolen to sulk his way out of town. Those two
deserve each other, although I am not sure that the great baseball
city of St. Louis does. I am already planning my trip back to
Philadelphia for the Cardinals' first visit with both Drew and Rolen
so I can boo as lustily as the locals. Maybe now we can end all of
that absurd talk that Rolen might be as good as Michael Jack Schmidt.</LD>

<TE>   So The Times condemns the Angels for not trading for a quality
midseason replacement, citing Boston's acquisition of Cliff Floyd,
since "he already has a ring, so he can help us get one too." I
disagree. The beauty of baseball is in the play of a well-balanced
team. Sure, everyone wants to win the World Series, but which did you
think really turned on the fans more--the mercenary Marlin
championship, or the Mets' wonderful run to make the Series in 2000
(even though they lost)?</TE>
<TE>   The Angel team we have is a great team to root for. I hope they
win the pennant, but just being in the race with this team that oozes
teamwork is a joy to most of us die-hard fans.</TE>

<TE>   The Dodgers trade Ricardo Rodriguez, their No. 1 prospect
according to Baseball America, for setup man Paul Shuey. Sounds
vaguely familiar. Like trading No. 1 prospect Paul Konerko for
reliever Jeff Shaw in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   If the Dodgers are going to mortgage their future to win now, they
should at least glance at the numbers. Their pitching is second in
the league, and the offense is 12th and sinking. Enough pitching
already! Does the front office really think upgrading Beltre,
Grudzielanek, Jordan or Karros will disappoint the fans? Getting shut
out 11 times is what I find disappointing.</TE>

<TE>   If Eric Karros is so worried about being benched in favor of Tyler
Houston [July 30], maybe he should stop killing rallies with
double-play balls, or acting as if it's somehow beneath him to run
out a grounder to short.</TE>

negative press for Anna Kournikova [July 31]. As for the ladies out
there who don't like the attention Anna gets, I suggest they try to
get over it. Anna playing good tennis is a bonus. Anna doing anything
is just fine. It's just regrettable that she seems to go for short
hockey players and not this strapping letter writer of normal height.
Hope remains eternal, however.</LD>

<HD>Little League Western Regional Starts Today</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Little League Western Regional, whose winner will advance to the
Little League World Series, begins today in San Bernardino, where
Southern California's representative, West Anaheim, will play
Arrowhead of Glendale, Ariz., at 8 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   In other first-round games at Western Regional Headquarters,
Peccolle, Nev., faces Taylorsville, Utah, at 10 a.m. and Waipio,
Hawaii, meets Mount Sentinel of Missoula, Mont., at 5 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   There is no admission charge at 8,000-seat Al Houghton Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   For the second consecutive year, the West and Northwest regionals
will be conducted in San Bernardino, which has staged Little League
playoffs since 1951.</TE>
<TE>   The Northwest Regional, which concludes Aug. 12, includes teams
from Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The West Regional, which concludes Aug. 13, has teams from
Southern and Northern California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN will televise both regional finals. The champions advance to
the World Series, Aug. 16-25 in Williamsport, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   Little League, Inc., the largest international youth baseball
organization in the world with approximately 2.8 million
participants, last year expanded its World Series field from eight to
16 teams and doubled the number of regional tournaments. Eight of
those will be staged over the next 10 days at five locations in the
U.S.; six more regionals will be contested in Canada, Nicaragua,
Poland, the Virgin Islands and the Philippines. Teams from Moscow and
Monterrey, Mexico, have already qualified for the World Series by
winning regionals.</TE>
<TE>   Expansion did little to enhance California's chances, though. The
state has more Little League participants than any other location in
the world, yet both of the state's representatives continue to play
in the West Regional.</TE>
<TE>   California teams have dominated the West, advancing to the World
Series 38 times since 1951. Southern California teams have played in
Williamsport 25 times, including 11 of the last 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   The 27-acre Western Regional complex, adjacent to Interstate 215
just south of Devore, has air-conditioned dorms for as many as 250
players and coaches</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A couple of winning streaks will be on the line in tonight's trials
for the $207,800 Golden State Derby.</LD>
<LD>   In the first of the two 400-yard trials, Last Shall Be First will
be seeking her fourth consecutive win for owner Spencer Childers and
trainer Dan Francisco. In the other race, Panther Mountain will go
for his third in a row and eighth win in 12 starts for owner Guy
Weimer and trainer Chuck Treece.</LD>
<LD>   Eight were entered in each of the trials and the 10 fastest
qualifiers will return for the Derby on Aug. 17.</LD>
<TE>   A 3-year-old daughter of Strawfly Special, Last Shall Be First is
perfect in 2002 and has been 1-2 in seven of nine in her career,
earning over $136,000. Two of her wins have come at tonight's
distance.</TE>
<TE>   Idle since Feb. 23, Panther Mountain has lost only once since
coming to California last fall. He has five victories in six starts,
and his only loss came when he was second to Agouti as the 7-10
favorite in the Cypress on Jan. 5. Eddie Aceves will ride him.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Evil Lady. 2. Saszy. 3. Would She. 4. Favoritt. 5.
Azore Best. 6. Drivers Seat. 7. Bacbac Overthewall. 8. Pecos Chicks.
9. Last Shall Be First. 10. Panther Mountain. 11. Farahon.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Evil Lady and Mirobolant in the first, Saszy, Sweetkins
and I Dream Of Flyin in the second, Would She and Truly A Lady in the
third and Favoritt and the Knowntoman-Vissudd entry in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Cuantemplate is a firster debuting in a soft
spot in the seventh for trainer John Cooper. Rubys Diggity Vet could
improve second time out in the 11th and switches to leading rider

<HD>Bucks Trade Robinson to Hawks for Kukoc, Smith</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Milwaukee Bucks traded forward Glenn Robinson to the Atlanta
Hawks on Friday for forwards Toni Kukoc and Leon Smith and a
first-round draft choice in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Robinson, 29, part of an underachieving team that missed the
playoffs last season, joins a club that has had losing records for
three consecutive seasons. But Hawk management has guaranteed the
team will make the playoffs this season, promising a partial refund
to season-ticket holders if they don't make it.</LD>
<LD>   Robinson will play small forward on a front line that includes
Shareef Abdur-Rahim and former league shot-block leader Theo Ratliff,
who has been injured for most of the last two seasons.</LD>
<TE>   In eight seasons, Robinson has averaged 21.1 points and 6.2
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extremely exciting to add a player of Glenn's capabilities,"
Atlanta Coach Lon Kruger said in a statement. "He's one of the
premier offensive players in the league and I think his abilities
will mesh well with Shareef and Theo. When you add a player of
Glenn's caliber, you have to give up a quality person and player in
Toni Kukoc."</TE>
<TE>   The Bucks missed the playoffs and players often bickered with
Coach George Karl. The trade means Milwaukee has broken up its "big
three" of Robinson, Ray Allen and Sam Cassell, who led the team to
the Eastern Conference finals only two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arvydas Sabonis, considering a return to the NBA after a season
off, has told acquaintances that he would not consider playing for
the Lakers because they could not afford him.</TE>
<TE>   Well over the salary cap and having spent their mid-level
exception as the starting point for Devean George's multiyear
contract, the Lakers have only their $1.4-million exception left to
lure Sabonis or another backup for Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Sabonis, who averaged 10.1 points and 5.4 rebounds two seasons ago
for the Portland Trail Blazers, apparently is hoping for a contract
that would pay him closer to $8 million per season. Sources said he
would play for a Spanish team if the Trail Blazers could not meet his
salary demands.</TE>
<TE>   Sabonis is expected to meet next week with Trail Blazer officials.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston Rocket guard Steve Francis has been diagnosed with an
inner ear disorder that causes migraine headaches.</TE>
<TE>   Francis, who missed seven games because of migraines last season,
has Meniere's Disease, which results from an abnormal amount of fluid
in the inner ear.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Guillermo Canas upset No. 2 Marat Safin, 7-5, 6-2, to advance to
the semifinals of the $2.95-million Tennis Masters Canada at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Safin, who won the tournament two years ago, had become the
favorite when No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt lost in the first round Monday at
the National Tennis Centre at York University.</TE>
<TE>   Safin made 19 unforced errors in the first set. The 22-year-old
Russian grew angrier during the match, cursing and raising his racket
as if to slam it to the court.</TE>
<TE>   Canas, from Argentina, is unseeded and ranked 20th in the world.
Canas advances to today's semifinals against No. 3 Tommy Haas of
Germany, who outlasted Fabrice Santoro of France, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 Andy Roddick of the United States defeated No. 15 David
Nalbandian of Argentina, 6-3, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick blasted seven aces to Nalbandian's one.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick improved to 43-13 in matches this year, and will increase
his 2002 earnings to more than $600,000 this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Gretzky refuted published reports that said he was preparing
for a comeback, saying he took part in a recent Phoenix Coyote rookie
camp not to get into playing shape but to strengthen a neck injury
and for enjoyment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Ray Ferraro, who overcame his small stature to become a
star in the NHL, retired after 18 seasons to join ESPN as a hockey
broadcaster.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot-8 Ferraro, who was an unrestricted free agent, ended
last season with St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Florida Panthers signed veteran left wing Stephane Matteau to
a one-year contract.... Carolina defenseman Niclas Wallin, who scored
two game-winning overtime goals during the Hurricanes' run to the
Stanley Cup finals, signed a two-year contract with the team....
Forward Josh Green accepted the Edmonton Oilers' qualifying offer for
next season. Green, 24, had 10 goals and five assists in 61 games

<KH>AROUND THE NFL</KH>
<HD>Spurrier Is Ready for First Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 6,000 miles from the Florida swamps, Steve Spurrier will
call his first plays in an NFL game.</LD>
<LD>   Amid more hype than exhibition games are usually worth, the Fun 'N
Gun coach with the $25-million contract debuts with the Washington
Redskins against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday (tonight 7 PDT) in
the American Bowl at Osaka, Japan.</LD>
<LD>   "It will be interesting to see what he can do at the NFL level,"
49er quarterback Jeff Garcia said. "I don't think he'll hold anything
back."</LD>
<TE>   Spurrier didn't have exhibition games at Florida, so he has been
all over the place describing his feelings and his game plan.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, however, he has downplayed the game's significance,
preferring to save his real competitive juices for the season opener
Sept. 8.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like a bowl game," Spurrier said Friday after
practice at the Osaka Dome. "Sometimes those bowl games don't mean a
heck of a lot in college. You keep score. There's going to be a
winner and loser."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Charger running back LaDainian Tomlinson, already slowed
in training camp by a blister, sprained his left ankle and was driven
off the field on a cart.</TE>
<TE>   Tomlinson, who was to be examined by a doctor, was hurt during a
team drill in which he was to hit the hole between the right guard
and tackle during the morning practice. He thinks another player fell
on his ankle from the inside.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it is too bad; hopefully it will just be a
day-to-day thing but we've just got to be careful with it," Tomlinson
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something that is going to keep me out for a while."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors have charged troubled former NFL lineman
Alonzo Spellman with terrorizing fellow passengers on a flight,
forcing the plane to make an emergency landing.</TE>
<TE>   The 31-year-old Spellman was charged with interfering with a
flight crew after the disturbance on a July 23 flight from Cincinnati
to Philadelphia, according to a federal complaint unsealed Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Spellman also was arrested later that day for allegedly ransacking
his brother's home in Mount Holly, N.J. There, he was charged with
making threats, criminal mischief and hindering apprehension.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta Falcons finally signed first-round draft pick T.J.
Duckett, who they hope will be their No. 1 running back this season.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, the team said it had broken off talks with
Duckett, chosen 18th overall in last April's draft. And before that,
they postponed negotiations for physical examinations of the player,
who was injured in a fight after a concert in Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy, who sat out last season,
announced his retirement from football.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, who played 11 seasons in Seattle, was the NFL's defensive
player of the year in 1992 and was named to the all-decade team of
the '90s. He was the third overall pick in the 1990 draft.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Brandon Spoon is out indefinitely after tearing his
right biceps tendon in practice. Spoon was hurt while attempting to
make a tackle. Bill Coach Gregg Williams said Spoon will have surgery
Monday, after which the team will evaluate whether to put him on the
injured reserve list.... The Baltimore Ravens signed free-agent
lineman Ethan Brooks to a one-year, $525,000 contract, a move that
could ultimately end the team's experiment of using guard Edwin
Mulitalo at right tackle.... Running back William Green, Cleveland's
top draft pick, hurt his right shoulder in practice and is listed as
day to day. Brown Coach Butch Davis said X-rays were negative, but
wouldn't say if Green would take part in today's scrimmage against
Buffalo.... Green Bay Packer center Mike Flanagan, anchor of an
offensive line considered among the best in the NFL, broke his right
thumb in practice. The injury probably will keep him out of the
exhibition season and possibly the regular-season opener Sept. 8
against Atlanta too.</TE>

<HD>Giles Closes Door on Nen, Giants, 6-5</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three times Robb Nen was within a strike of his 300th save, three
times he didn't get it. And the San Francisco Giants got a loss that
could haunt them later if they don't make the postseason.</LD>
<LD>   Brian Giles's two-run double won it in the ninth inning after San
Francisco closer Robb Nen was within one strike of ending the game
three times, and the Pittsburgh Pirates rallied past the Giants, 6-5,
Friday night at Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants lost their eighth in 11 games and missed a chance to
tie the Dodgers for the NL wild-card lead</LD>
<TE>   "This is tough, real tough," Manager Dusty Baker said. "Any time
you lose them late ..."</TE>
<TE>   Nen, brought in to preserve a 5-4 lead, quickly retired Pokey
Reese and pinch-hitter Armando Rios, then ran the count to 0-2 on
both Jason Kendall and Jack Wilson, only to have both single into
left field.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you have him [Wilson] 0-2, and he gets a hit, it's not
good," Nen said. "It was a slider that just got too much of the
plate. It wasn't where I wanted it, and I didn't want to face Giles
in that situation."</TE>
<TE>   For good reason: Giles is four for five with two homers and five
runs batted in against him.</TE>
<TE>   Giles also fell behind in the count 1-2, tomahawked a foul ball on
a pitch he nearly missed, then hit a drive into the left-center gap
that center fielder Kenny Lofton couldn't catch as both runners
scored.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to first and I thought he caught it," Giles said. "It
sliced just enough because he can run down anything out there."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 5, Cincinnati 2--Brian Lawrence tied his career high
with 10 strikeouts and didn't allow an earned run in eight innings as
the Padres won at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Nevin went three for four with a run-scoring single and Deivi
Cruz had two hits and an RBI for the Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence (10-6) gave up two unearned runs before being replaced by
Trevor Hoffman to start the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman, who blew a ninth-inning lead in an 8-7 loss to the
Chicago Cubs on Thursday, earned his 341st career save, tying Rollie
Fingers for sixth place all-time.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 11, St. Louis 5--Wes Helms hit his first career grand
slam, and Chipper Jones had a three-run homer as the Braves won the
matchup of division leaders at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Glavine (14-6) gave up one run and six hits in five innings,
coming back after a rain delay of 55 minutes in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis starter Jason Simontacchi (7-3) gave up nine runs in
one-plus inning.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 1, Florida 0--Jamey Wright pitched three-hit ball for
seven innings, and Ronnie Belliard hit an RBI single at Miami as the
Brewers ended a three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 3, Houston 1--Britt Reames and two relievers combined on
a four-hitter and Brad Wilkerson hit an RBI triple and scored the
go-ahead run in the sixth inning to lead the Expos at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 6, Colorado 4--Moises Alou hit a game-ending, two-run
homer in the 12th inning off Victor Santos (0-1) as the Cubs beat the
Rockies despite blowing a ninth-inning lead.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona at New York, ppd.--The game between the Diamondbacks and
Mets was rained out and will be made up as part of a doubleheader
today.</TE>

<LD>Lisa Andersen of Florida and Melanie Redman-Carr of Australia, two of
the top female professional surfers on tour, were eliminated Friday
morning in the round of 32 at the Philips U.S. Open of Surfing in
Huntington Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Kim Hamrock of Huntington Beach and Erica Hosseini of Newport

of 32, also were eliminated. The women's semifinals are set for 3

<LD>New York Athletic Club, the U.S. Men's Senior National Water Polo

<HD>Galaxy's Little Fish Balances the Scales</HD>
<DH>Soccer: After years of disappointing play from aging
imports, team and MLS hook a winner in Guatemala's Ruiz.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carlos Ruiz grew up playing barefoot pickup soccer in the dusty,
unpaved streets of Guatemala City's Zone 21 barrio, the lower-middle
class Bellos Horizontes.</LD>
<LD>   It was a simpler time, Ruiz said, when dozens of children running
the streets would make do with whatever the wind blew their way,
taping together newspapers, rags and clothing into a makeshift soccer
ball to kick around for bragging rights from sunrise to sunset.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been playing it for more than 100 years and the children,
they begin playing when they are very young," Ruiz said. "I started
when I was 6, playing in the street. It's an obligation for the
children to play. It's expected of them."</LD>
<TE>   Nothing, though, was expected of a 12-year-old Ruiz when he packed
up his street credentials and headed to an open tryout for a spot in
the revered CSD Municipal team's youth academy. He was one of about
1,800 youngsters to show up, and he was not taken seriously.</TE>
<TE>   But less than four years after the tryout, after he had picked up
his nickname Pescadito (Little Fish), he made his professional debut,
the only player from the audition to make it to Municipal's parent
club.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years later, the Little Fish is one of four Guatemalans
playing internationally. The Galaxy rookie forward, whose 16 goals
lead Major League Soccer, will also represent his club and country
today as an MLS All-Star in an exhibition match against the U.S.
national team at RFK Stadium in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't expect it," he said, "but with good teammates, good
things can happen."</TE>
<TE>   When Ruiz, 22, signed with MLS as a Galaxy discovery pick Feb. 5,
he found himself in the middle of a brewing storm.</TE>
<TE>   Since MLS' formation in 1996, the league has assigned a prominent
Mexican player to the Galaxy, with Los Angeles' Mexican population in
mind.</TE>
<TE>   But all three Mexican national team stars who have worn the Galaxy
uniform--goalkeeper Jorge Campos and forwards Carlos Hermosillo and
Luis Hernandez--were brought in well after their best days.</TE>
<TE>   This year the Galaxy has no Mexican players for the first time in
league history--a fact that Los Angeles' Mexican-dominated
Spanish-language media has been quick to point out--but the furor has
died down a bit thanks to Ruiz's rapid and stunning success.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter if you're Chinese, Spanish, Mexican, Guatemalan
... it's not important," he said. "If you produce, play well and act
professionally, it doesn't matter where you're from."</TE>
<TE>   In 64 regular-season games over four seasons, Hermosillo and
Hernandez scored a total of 26 goals.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz already has 16 goals, five game-winners, in 18 games.
Learning on the fly to play the faster, more physical MLS game, Ruiz
is the league's second-leading scorer with 32 points, two behind New
England's Taylor Twellman, who has 15 goals and four assists in 20
games.</TE>
<TE>   Why has Ruiz thrived where Hermosillo and Hernandez struggled?</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, Guatemala was out of the World Cup picture and the
Galaxy is Ruiz's top priority.</TE>
<TE>   For another, Ruiz actually wants to be here.</TE>
<TE>   "Luis Hernandez was ... an experiment that didn't work out for
us," MLS Commissioner Don Garber said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet Carlos Ruiz is just tearing up this league and that guy
exudes passion. Whether that's Latino passion or a soccer passion,
when you watch this guy play on the field, it just draws you to the
television. I'm watching in New York and you knew Carlos Ruiz was
going to score and not let those fans go home, 55,000 of them,
unsatisfied on July 4."</TE>
<TE>   Garber was referring to Ruiz's 87th-minute game winner against San
Jose at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that Carlos Ruiz has a Hispanic heritage I think is a
good thing for the Latino community here [in Los Angeles]," Garber
said. "Now, if Carlos Ruiz was Mexican, would it be better for us?
Probably would be, perhaps.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather have Carlos Ruiz than just having a Mexican guy who
might be some 21-year-old guy that's just there on the bench or maybe
he's playing somewhere on the field but not tearing up this league."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz's teammates cast early suspicious glances his way. Galaxy
midfielder Peter Vagenas, who played against Ruiz and Guatemala in
Olympic qualifying more than two years ago, was among them.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't half the player he is now," Vagenas said. "I was a
little iffy at first because I didn't think he was the true solution
or the true goal scorer that we needed.</TE>
<TE>   "But, as he's proven since he's gotten here, he's more than just a
goal scorer. He does all the dirty things that we need on top of
that, whether it's holding the ball for us or giving the team some
structure."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz leads the team in shots (70), shots on goal (38), fouls
committed (45) and fouls suffered (46). Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid
believes more should be called against opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "He goes down rather easily and I think that's sort of the rap
that's come upon him," Schmid said of the 5-foot-9, 170-pound Ruiz.
"I think there's times when he is truly getting fouled and referees
are not giving him a break. That's a little bit disappointing and
that's frustrating for him because we've told him, 'Just stand up
there and take it and you'll get the calls.' "</TE>
<TE>   The timing was perfect for the relationship between MLS, the
Galaxy and Ruiz to bloom this season. But next year he will
undoubtedly hear the call of his country for the Gold Cup, which is
being moved to the summer, in the middle of the MLS season.</TE>
<TE>   Mix in Olympic and World Cup qualifying with his loftier
aspirations and things aren't so clear.</TE>
<TE>   "My [MLS] contract is for four years but I hope that in two or
three years I can leave for another type of futbol," Ruiz said.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe Europe or Mexico. My dream has always been to play in
Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz had a frustrating seven-month stint with Greek first-division
club PAS Ioanina in 2000 and claims he has yet to be paid for his
service there. Ultimately, though, he wants to play as a foreigner in
the Mexican league with Necaxa, following the trail blazed by Ivo
Bassay (Chile) and Alex Aguinaga (Ecuador).</TE>
<TE>   For now, Ruiz is enjoying life in Pasadena, where he shares an
apartment with his wife Laura, who is expecting the couple's second
child this month, and 2-year-old daughter Andrea Michelle.</TE>
<TE>   His mind still wanders, though, back to growing up as a goalkeeper
in a soccer-mad country of 13 million as the lone boy in a
four-daughter family whose father died when Carlos was 3.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz can't remember why he's been called Pescadito for more than a
decade, but he takes pride that he is seen as a forefather, of sorts,
of Guatemalan international soccer.</TE>
<TE>   His every move in the U.S. is documented by the Guatemalan media,
as are those made by countrymen Freddy Garcia (Columbus Crew in MLS),
former Galaxy midfielder Martin Machon (Atlas in Mexico) and Dwight
Pezzarosi (Racing Ferol in Spain).</TE>
<TE>   It is the first time that as many as four Guatemaltecos are
playing abroad at the same time, Ruiz said.</TE>
<TE>   "We all need to perform and represent well," he said, "to show the
world that there is enough talent in Guatemala to play anywhere in
the world."</TE>
<TE>   Including, it would seem, in the dusty roads of a poor barrio.</TE>

<DH>Olympics: IOC president doesn't rule out recalculating ice
dance results because of allegations of fixing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge, proclaiming
himself appalled that a reputed Russian mobster allegedly conspired
to fix the pairs and ice dance competitions at the Salt Lake City
Games, left an opening for the ice dance results to be recalculated
if U.S. and Italian authorities uncover evidence that warrants
dramatic remedies.</LD>
<LD>   "I will rule out nothing," Rogge said Friday from Manchester,
England, where he was attending the Commonwealth Games. "Everything
is possible. We will act with our partner, the International Skating
Union, in the best interest of the sport and the athletes. But I
don't rule out such a possibility."</LD>
<LD>   Alimzhan Tokhtakhunov, described by Italian police as the kingpin
of a Moscow-based crime organization, was charged Wednesday with
leading a vote-swapping scheme to give the ice dance gold medal to
Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat. The duo competed for France
even though Anissina is a native of Russia.</LD>
<TE>   Tokhtakhunov, linked by U.S. prosecutors to drug distribution,
illegal arms sales and beauty-pageant fixing, allegedly plotted to
have a French judge vote for a Russian couple in the pairs event in
exchange for a Russian judge's vote for Anissina and Peizerat in the
ice dance finale. However, the Russian judge, Alla Shekhovtseva,
ranked Anissina and Peizerat second to Russians Irina Lobacheva and
Ilia Averbukh, who won the silver medal.</TE>
<TE>   Tokhtakhunov, who was arrested in Italy and is awaiting
extradition to the U.S. at Santa Maria Maggiore jail in Venice,
asserted his innocence through his attorney, Luca Saldarelli. He also
disputed the meaning of wiretapped conversations cited in the FBI
complaint against him.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows nothing about this matter, absolutely nothing,"
Saldarelli said. "He was never interested in sport. As far as the
Olympic Games are concerned, he has never had anything to do with
skating.... These conversations could reveal themselves as absolutely
innocent from a telephonic point of view. They could have other
meanings, they could either just not exist or be illegitimate, and we
do not know."</TE>
<TE>   In announcing the ISU will conduct its own investigation and that
he asked the IOC ethics committee to follow suit, Rogge identified
Anissina by name for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint refers to "the female ice dancer" and quotes an
unidentified member of the Russian figure skating federation as
saying to Tokhtakhunov during a wiretapped phone conversation, "She
[the ice dancer] is a Russian girl and we will feel good about it."
The complaint also says a woman identified as "the female ice
dancer's mother" was heard on the tape.</TE>
<TE>   However, Rogge was specific. "I would ask the French national
Olympic committee to make an inquiry and present us a report on the
allegations against Anissina," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Anissina said in a statement released by the French figure skating
federation she will consider suing those who have linked her to the
alleged fix.</TE>
<TE>   "Gwendal and myself never needed anybody to help us win our gold
medal in Salt Lake City," she said. "I categorically denounce all the
slanderous, unjust and disgraceful allegations that were made against
me after the arrest of Mr. Tokhtakhunov."</TE>
<TE>   Although Tokhtakhunov has also been charged with trying to
influence the outcome of the pairs event, Rogge indicated those
results are not likely to change.</TE>
<TE>   Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze won the pairs
gold medal in a controversial 5-4 decision over Canadians Jamie Sale
and David Pelletier, after which French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne
said she had been pressured to vote for the Russians. She recanted,
but she and Didier Gailhaguet, president of the French ice sports
federation, were suspended for three years and banned from the 2006
Olympics as the result of an ISU investigation.</TE>
<TE>   To silence an international clamor, the ISU recommended awarding
duplicate gold medals to Sale and Pelletier. Rogge, eager to
dissipate the cloud hanging over the Games, endorsed the
unprecedented move.</TE>
<TE>   Rogge said that decision was appropriate based on evidence then
available. The charges against Tokhtakhunov, he said, are "a stronger
confirmation that the decision we've taken was a good one."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "I think it's quite clear the [pair skaters] were not
part of the process. The athletes were innocent. They skated at their
full ability and I believe no one will dispute that those two pairs
were the best two pairs in the world."</TE>
<TE>   He also said no consideration has been given to decertifying the
ISU or removing figure skating--the premier event of the Games--from
the Olympic program.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to clean up the sport," he said. "That's what the ISU is
doing both with its hearings in Lausanne [into Le Gougne and
Gailhaguet's actions] and in changing the [judging] system in its
general assembly in Kyoto....</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot penalize hundreds of thousands of athletes that train
very hard every day and deserve to participate in competitions. We
know that there are problems in the judgment. The ISU knows that. We
are working hard to improve that."</TE>
<TE>   However, Ron Pfenning, referee of the pairs judging panel at Salt
Lake City, expressed doubt the ISU can conduct a thorough
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have some reservations," he said. "I would like to think
that they could get to the bottom of it, but I'm not sure they have
the resources. They have a small office staff, whereas the FBI and
other agencies have a lot more manpower....</TE>
<TE>   "I did think after the Lausanne hearings and Didier and
Marie-Reine dropped their appeals that it was over. But we knew all
along the French didn't do this by themselves. The first night [after
the pairs finale], I wasn't present, but [judges] Walburga Grimm and
Sally Stapleford were, and Marie-Reine did say to them that it was
ice dancing that was going to bring the whole thing down."</TE>
<TE>   Grimm, of Germany, and Stapleford, of Britain, could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze said during TV interviews in Russia
they will sue U.S. TV networks that used pictures of them to
illustrate stories about the charges against Tokhtakhunov. The
Russian Olympic Committee vowed to back them.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Moscow Times, Russian Olympic Committee spokesman
Gennady Shvets told Russia's NTV network Russian Olympic officials
don't know Tokhtakhunov and doubted he could have fixed Olympic
events.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a delusion of grandeur," Svets said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Tokhtakhunov has socialized with athletes. A picture of
him with tennis players Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine and Marat Safin
and Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia was recently removed from Medvedev's
Web site, and Anissina and Pavel Bure of the NHL's New York Rangers
were reported to be guests at a 1999 party thrown for Tokhtakhunov in
Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Bure's presence is noteworthy because Russian crime figures have
long been rumored to have menaced Russian-born NHL players. An NHL
source said Tokhtakhunov is known to the league's security officials,
most of whom have law enforcement backgrounds. "Everybody who's ever
been a New York policeman or in the FBI knows him," the source said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the source said Tokhtakhunov's name never came up during
NHL investigations of instances in which players were approached for
money.</TE>
<TE>   Bernadette Mansur, group vice president of communications for the
NHL, said no connection between Bure and Tokhtakhunov had been found.
"Not that the league is aware of and not that we came upon in any
investigation," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rogge acknowledged he is concerned about possible infiltration of
sports by crime figures, and said he asked IOC lawyers to request the
organization be made an interested party to the FBI case in order to
gain access to information gathered against Tokhtakhunov and other
unnamed co-conspirators.</TE>
<TE>   He said U.S. law forbids the granting of that request but hoped
IOC lawyers in Italy will get access to information gathered there.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something we will have to examine," Rogge said.</TE>

<TE>   Record vs. Monarchs--2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--For the Sparks, it qualifies as a slump--a mere two-game
losing streak. But it comes at a time when they are fighting for the
Western Conference title, with Houston only a half-game back and less
than two weeks left in the regular season. "Obviously, we're after
home-court advantage throughout the playoffs," Coach Michael Cooper
said. "But I feel very strongly ... that it doesn't matter what
happens, we're in the playoffs and we'll handle our business there."
Lisa Leslie scored a season-high 30 points in Thursday's loss to
Seattle in a game marred by 18 Spark turnovers. "I don't think we
feel like we can just turn it on. I think we have to turn it on now,"
Leslie said. "We have to look at our turnover situation and focus on
getting those down." Sacramento, like Seattle, is hot. The Monarchs
have a six-game winning streak and have recovered from earlier
injuries that took Yolanda Griffith and Ticha Penicheiro out of the
lineup for extended periods. But the Sparks' focus is on their own
play, as a 25-minute meeting Thursday proved. "Management wants us to
know no one is angry at anyone, they just were telling us things they
saw in us," DeLisha Milton said. "They see that it's almost like
we're not believing in ourselves like we once did. I think it's very
true."</TE>

<HD>One of Surprises Belongs to Dokic</HD>
<DH>Tennis: She eliminates Capriati, and Kournikova pulls
upset. Williams, Davenport also reach semifinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>The third set used to be the possession of Jennifer Capriati. She may
not have owned them outright--who ever does?--but she could at least
claim a long-term lease.</LD>
<LD>   Encroachment came from Serena Williams and Justine Henin in 2002
with Williams defeating Capriati four times this year, three times in
three sets. Membership in the club expanded on Friday with a surprise
guest, Jelena Dokic, who once used to fade in the latter stages
against Capriati.</LD>
<LD>   The sixth-seeded Dokic of Yugoslavia defeated second-seeded
Capriati, 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, in a hard-hitting quarterfinal at the Acura
Classic on Friday night at La Costa Resort and Spa. In today's
semifinal, she will play Anna Kournikova of Russia, and top-seeded
and two-time defending champion Venus Williams will face third-seeded
Lindsay Davenport in the night match.</LD>
<TE>   While Kournikova's marathon quarterfinal victory against
12th-seeded Anna Smashnova of Israel represented a test of will power
and endurance, Dokic's victory was more of a mental breakthrough. For
the 19-year-old, it may well serve as a career turning point.</TE>
<TE>   "She's always been a good player," said Capriati, who has not won
a tournament since the Australian Open in January. "Today, she was a
great player. If she can be consistent like that she'll move up in
the rankings and have more big wins."</TE>
<TE>   Dokic went so far as to call this the biggest victory of her
career, and she has recorded victories against former No. 1 Martina
Hingis and Venus Williams. This, however, was her first victory
against Capriati in five matches, which included a three-set loss at
the French Open in the quarterfinals this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Jennifer was always the one for me to beat," Dokic said. "I think
it may have been the biggest win of my career. She is [ranked] No. 3
right now, but at times, you could still say she's No. 1."</TE>
<TE>   The third set of their match featured five consecutive breaks of
serve before Dokic held at 5-4 to win it. Every time Dokic looked
vulnerable, she came back stronger in the next game. She needed only
two match points, moving into the semifinals when Capriati hit a
forehand long.</TE>
<TE>   Their quarterfinal lasted 1 hour 39 minutes, and interestingly
enough, was the second-fastest of the four quarterfinals. Davenport
was the most efficient winner, beating Ai Sugiyama of Japan, 6-1,
6-1, in 46 minutes, calling it her best match since returning from a
nine-month layoff after knee surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Venus Williams dropped the middle set of her quarterfinal against
fifth-seeded Kim Clijsters of Belgium, a rematch of their final last
Sunday at Stanford. Williams won the final in straight sets, and the
two disagreed on the level of Clijsters' play. Here, Williams
committed 73 unforced errors but defeated Clijsters, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4,
in 1 hour 50 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she played really well last week," Williams said. "She'll
probably admit she didn't feel like she played as well, either. I
don't know how she feels. I think she made more unforced errors
[today]."</TE>
<TE>   Clijsters laughed and very politely disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe on her side, but not on mine," she said. "I think the score
says it all."</TE>
<TE>   You could say the same thing about the Kournikova-Smashnova
endurance test. Kournikova was exhausted and out of breath after her
1-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Smashnova, which lasted 2 hours 18
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "She's an amazing player," said Kournikova, who trailed, 1-6, 1-3.
"It took everything out of me. My feet are burning. She gives 150%,
plays so well and didn't make many mistakes. She's basically a wall
back there."</TE>
<TE>   Smashnova may have the best name in tennis, but she has the game
to cause the worst nightmares for her opponents. The looping topspin,
the tireless running, the endless retrieving.</TE>
<TE>   Harold Solomon may not have invented it, but, well, he knows it
when he sees it.</TE>
<TE>   "Must have been like that for people when they used to play me,"
he said, joking, of facing Smashnova.</TE>
<TE>   Solomon, a French Open finalist in 1976, now coaches Kournikova
and was immensely proud of her effort. "It showed people how gutsy
she is," he said. "It would have been easy to bag it, a sore leg,
sore stomach. 'I'm tired.' A lot of players would have said, 'Adios.'
I'm proud of her."</TE>
<TE>   That was high praise from the man who won his matches by
attrition. Kournikova only knows of his glory days by legend and
said, giggling: "I heard he invented the moonball. He's going to kill
me."</TE>

<HD>Seles' Injury Puts Her on Sidelines</HD>

<LD>Monica Seles' resurgence last summer in Southern California won't be
repeated. In fact, the chronic foot injury that put her out of the
Acura Classic and the JPMorgan Chase Open at Manhattan Beach could
raise more questions about her tennis future.</LD>
<LD>   It was not surprising on Friday when Seles pulled out of next
week's tournament at Manhattan Beach. The inflammation of the arch of
her right foot began bothering her last month in an early round loss
to Lisa Raymond at Stanford, limiting Seles' mobility and resulting
in her return home to Florida.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, a stress fracture of her right foot kept Seles off the
tour after Indian Wells until she attempted to play a clay-court
event in Madrid, the week before the French Open. The move backfired,
and she stayed off the tour until the summer hard-court season in
Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   Seles then reached consecutive finals, losing to Venus Williams
here and Lindsay Davenport at Manhattan Beach. In those events, at
times, she played better than she had in years, defeating Jennifer
Capriati, Martina Hingis (twice) and Serena Williams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The wild-card entrants for the Manhattan Beach tournament, which
starts Sunday, are Jelena Jankovic of Yugoslavia, Elena Bovina of
Russia, Shuai Peng of China and Corina Morariu. Morariu, who will
face Marie-Gaiane Mikaelian of Switzerland in the first round, will
play her first singles match on the tour since being diagnosed with a
rare form of leukemia in May 2001. Morariu, 24, played doubles with
Kimberly Po-Messerli at Carlsbad on Monday, losing in the first round
to Chanda Rubin and Meghann Shaughnessy.</TE>
<TE>   In the Manhattan Beach doubles field is Martina Navratilova, who
will team with Liezel Huber of South Africa. In singles, Wimbledon
and French Open champion Serena Williams is seeded No. 1, followed by
Jennifer Capriati, defending champion Lindsay Davenport, Jelena Dokic
of Yugoslavia, Kim Clijsters of Belgium and Daniela Hantuchova of
Slovakia.</TE>
<TE>   If form holds, Williams would meet Dokic in the semifinals, and
Capriati would face Davenport. Dokic would have to get past Clijsters
in the quarterfinals, and Davenport could play Hantuchova in that
round.</TE>

<TE>   Thursday's fund-raising dinner for the Aspen-based Silver Lining
Foundation, run by former tennis pro Andrea Jaeger, raised $191,127,
according to organizers. The dollar figure jumped up by $5,000 when
an individual wrote a check on Friday, tournament officials said.
Among the tennis players attending were Dokic, Clijsters and
Capriati. One of the purchasers was Stefano Capriati, the father and
coach of Jennifer, who paid $2,300 for a poster of his daughter.</TE>

<LD>The New York Liberty is back where it wants to be--atop the Eastern
Conference.</LD>
<LD>   Vickie Johnson scored 18 of her 20 points in the second half as
the Liberty defeated the Miami Sol, 66-54, before 15,344 Friday night
at Madison Square Garden and moved one game ahead of the Washington
Mystics.</LD>
<LD>   Tamika Whitmore had 19 points, and Teresa Weatherspoon had 10
assists for the Liberty (16-10).</LD>
<TE>   "Our game plan was to up the tempo, press and push," New York
Coach Richie Adubato said. "Vickie busted it open with a couple of
big threes in transition."</TE>
<TE>   Miami (12-16), which finished its trip 1-4, shot 35% and was
outrebounded, 34-27.</TE>
<TE>   Sol Coach Ron Rothstein said fatigue might have been a factor: "I
don't like to use it as an excuse, but I think it was a certain
element in tonight's game."</TE>
<TE>   Portland 67, Washington 65--Ukari Figgs scored 16 points as the
Fire (16-12) handed the Mystics (15-11) their fifth consecutive loss
before 16,188 at Washington. Chamique Holdsclaw led the Mystics with
26 points.</TE>
<TE>   Despite losing, Coach Marianne Stanley said: "I feel that we broke
out of our rut to a great degree."</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 75, Phoenix 51--Katie Smith's 22 points led the Lynx
(8-19) past the Mercury (9-18) before 12,544 at Minneapolis. Smith
scored 20 in the second half.</TE>
