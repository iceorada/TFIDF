<LD>Actor Michael Madsen is still jet-lagged from a recent transatlantic
flight from Paris, and he's sitting in his office, a bit overwhelmed
by the task ahead of him. "My secretary has vanished," he says in a
near growl. "She ran off to Palm Springs with her boyfriend." Madsen
has a lot to keep track of these days. He's starring in a flurry of
new films in the coming months, including one he has co-written and
is producing himself, and his third book is due out in November.
"It's my next 'cool' wave," he says.</LD>
<LD>   As Madsen reorganizes his desk and clears his throat he remembers
something of his summer travels: "Have you ever been in Paris on
Bastille Day?" The answer is "no," so he paints a mental pic- ture of
jets storming over the Champs-Elysees and a breathtaking fireworks
show above the darkened Eiffel Tower. Those French, he says, "they
can give the U.S. a run for their money...." Madsen's memory stalls
him. Then he adds, "I'm just happy to be home."</LD>
<TE>   The actor has spent much of this year on location. First he was in
London shooting a rare "good guy role" as Halle Berry's boss in the
upcoming James Bond picture "Die Another Day," starring Madsen's
Malibu neighbor Pierce Brosnan. Then he was in Paris to play a bad
guy in "Blueberry," the $40-million "mystical" western directed by
Jan Kounen based on the French comic book series. That picture also
required Madsen to spend three months in Mexico and make a trip to
Spain.</TE>
<TE>   In September he stays close to home to shoot Quentin Tarantino's
new film "Kill Bill," starring David Carradine as Bill, Madsen as his
alcoholic brother and Lucy Liu, Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah. It's
his first picture with Tarantino since his role in the director's
1992 debut "Reservoir Dogs," in which Madsen played "Mr. Blonde," a
deranged ex-con who sadistically toys with a man he thinks is a cop
by cutting off his ear while dancing to "Stuck in the Middle With
You."</TE>
<TE>   In November, Madsen's third book will be released. The collection
of poetry inspired by his travels, his relationships and '50s
nostalgia is titled "The Blessing of the Hounds" and was written, he
says, on napkins and matchbooks during his movie shoots. "Eventually
you have enough to put together a book," he says. "I never set out to
write a book ... it's something that happened by accident."</TE>
<TE>   Later that month, Madsen starts shooting "Red Light Runners," a
film he co-wrote, is producing and stars in as a man who manipulates
the lives of people whose photos were taken by cameras at stoplights.
"It's a social commentary told by nefarious people," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Though Madsen relishes the time at home with his wife and sons, he
notes that his hard work is an important move toward more creative
independence. "I'm tired of being a puppet," he says. "I have
reinvested myself in my future."</TE>
<TE>   Slimming Lessons</TE>
<TE>   On New Year's Eve 2001, book agent Ed Victor was getting dressed
for a party thrown by Candice Bergen, a friend. Try as he did, Victor
just couldn't get into his party attire. "I was sucking in my gut,"
he said by phone from London, "but I couldn't button my trousers."</TE>
<TE>   All those literary lunches had taken their toll.</TE>
<TE>   Victor, the agent for Bergen, Erica Jong, Nigella Lawson, Mel
Brooks and Tina Brown, among others, decided it was time for a diet.
To keep himself on track, he wrote a book about dieting as well. The
result, "The Obvious Diet" (Arcade Publishing, 2002), is a mix of
recipes (from other cookbooks) and advice from ladies (and men) who
lunch--too much.</TE>
<TE>   The book includes a foreword by Lawson, an introduction by Larry
King (who shares his tuna salad recipe) and a chapter entitled "The
Secrets of Famous People"--with contributions by Jong, Brooks and
King. Brown, the former New Yorker and Talk editrix, dispenses this
unforgettable piece of advice: "Portion-wise the easiest thing for me
to remember was that the meat or fish on my plate should be NO BIGGER
THAN A DECK OF CARDS."</TE>
<TE>   The impetus for "The Obvious Diet" was Victor's desire to fit in
his trousers again--and his desire to try on the shoes of his
clients. "I've been a midwife to literally thousands of books," said
Victor. "I wanted to be the parent of one to see what it was like."
So?</TE>
<TE>   "As empathetic as I am to my authors, it's different when you're
the rabbit in the headlights--the snide remarks, the reviews," some
of which have pointed out his propensity to mention the names of
friends.</TE>
<TE>   "These happen to be people who are famous," said Victor. "What can
you do if your friends have names? Not drop them? A number of
celebrity diets are in there because people in the public eye ...
have to stay thin."</TE>
<TE>   He got a call on the other line. "That was Pete Towns- hend," he
said. Townshend, who in his blurb for the book calls Victor a
"dietetic shaman," is staying thin too.</TE>

<HD>Haven by the Sea</HD>
<DH>It may be no different from other cottages, but for those
who revisit it, this Orange County house is like a port in a storm</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is a tugboat of a house among a fleet of luxury liners on the
one-mile length of Sunset Beach. It looks out upon the sand, a
horizon of ocean and sky, and beyond that, the continued path of
sunsets and infinite possibilities.</LD>
<LD>   Three bedrooms, one bath, 1,100 square feet, it practically rubs
shoulders with neighbors. The face is glass and stucco, overlooking a
small wooden deck, a yard of sand that has been dug up time and again
by toy shovels and bulldozers and tiny palms. The berms are foliaged
with ice plants.</LD>
<LD>   It was built in the mid-1950s by a young couple with two sons.
Helen and Ivan Liggett were denied a GI loan on the property because
it was considered vulnerable to the violent outbursts of high seas.
So Ivan, a lawyer reared in South Dakota, borrowed money from his
father to buy the lot and build a home, the only one he and Helen
would ever own.</LD>
<TE>   It is where sons John and Gary grew up, where the beach and ocean
became a part of their lives too. When their parents died in the
1980s, they began renting it out. Then 10 years ago, Gary bought out
John's interest. He hopes to retire there someday.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, it is like thousands of places along the beaches of
Southern California, rented out in one-week blocks to visitors who
bring with them their own stories and expectations. Most come to
listen to the ocean, to be soothed by its rhythms and its touch, to
wash themselves of the grit of daily life. To do absolutely nothing
at all.</TE>
<TE>   The Liggett house in Sunset Beach in northern Orange County has a
way of pulling people back to it. Its owner, Gary, and his family
always spend a piece of their summer here. Many of those who rent it
on other weeks are repeat visitors too. On the week before the
Liggetts arrived this summer, the Gleason family from Arizona--it was
their second time back--and the Turners shared the house. On the day
after the Liggetts left, two sisters and a granddaughter arrived from
Virginia and Louisiana. It was their fourth time.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors come to the small house on Sunset Beach to contemplate
and dream, to renew themselves. One week at a time.</TE>
<TE>   A Difficult Journey</TE>
<TE>   For the Gleasons, getting to the house this summer was something
of an endurance test. When the tread came flying off the driver's
side front tire of their minivan, it was at least 110 degrees in the
desert outside Phoenix. Twenty miles into their vacation, Jane and
John with young sons Chet and Everett stood like lost puppies on the
side of the road. They were bummed out and hot; it was by all
accounts a pitiful sight.</TE>
<TE>   John bolted on the emergency tire so they could drive back and buy
a replacement. Their traveling companions this year, the Turners,
were in a separate vehicle and offered to take the Gleason boys and
continue the journey west, lessening the range and depth of
misfortune.</TE>
<TE>   Like a pair of loafers at a shoe clearance, one tire turned into
four, which put a $300 dent in the Gleasons' vacation budget. So long
to Alaskan king crab at Captain Jack's. Hello to burgers at Woody's.</TE>
<TE>   With fresh rubber on the Windstar, the Gleasons started out again.
As they drove, Jane worried about whether Chet and Everett were
behaving, whether the Turners, with two sons of their own, would be
able to find the house. Sharing the house makes it more affordable.
Rent runs $2,450 a week during the peak season.</TE>
<TE>   It was quiet in the car without the boys, and the remainder of the
drive was pleasantly uneventful until they hit traffic just past
Riverside, and John's grip on the steering wheel tightened and
frustration set in. It's hard to believe that visitors might actually
come to Southern California to get away from people, but that's
exactly one of the reasons the Gleasons enjoy Sunset Beach. Getting
there at 4 in the afternoon, however, is another matter.</TE>
<TE>   The Windstar had barely come to a complete stop when John, a
42-year-old bridge engineer, was already changed and charging for the
water as if his feet and soul were on fire. He jumped in with the
kids, who were already getting knocked around by the waves.</TE>
<TE>   The families did not make many plans for this trip. Mostly what
they wanted to do was nothing, and as their week unfolded, they
turned out to be quite good at it.</TE>
<TE>   Cassy and Jane did go out one night to a wine bar that played a
lot of Eric Clapton music. John and Wade spent a day on the links,
while Cassy and Jane took the kids to the Aquarium of the Pacific in
Long Beach. John took the kids to Legoland one day. Wade, director of
the Department of Racing in Arizona, and Cassy went to watch the
horses run at Los Alamitos one night.</TE>
<TE>   In between, there was time to ponder, to purge and take inventory,
to be lured by the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   One night when the kids were asleep and the moon was full, Jane
went out for a stroll and thought about how nice it would be if her
family could afford to live on the beach, to travel and not be so
confined by daily tasks. She thought about all that she could give
her family if she went back to work full time, how $300 for tires
would not be such a factor in their trip.</TE>
<TE>   Before the children came along, she was a producer of television
commercials in New York, but now her primary roles in life are that
of wife, mother and daughter. She is a part-time teacher's assistant
and also instructs fitness classes from time to time.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes she thinks back to when she was only Jane, fresh out of
college, backpacking alone through Europe a couple weeks after
breaking up with her boyfriend, or when she moved to New York,
striking out on her own, with $500.</TE>
<TE>   As she walked along the beach, taking stock of her life, she did
not separate herself from John and the kids. She isn't just Jane
anymore. She is part of a bigger picture that includes the tickles
and tunes she gives her sons each night at bedtime, choosing from
household favorites: "House at Pooh Corner" for Chet, 7; "My Favorite
Things" for Everett, 4.</TE>
<TE>   She could have walked through moonlight forever, but she didn't.
She turned around--away from the ocean--and returned to the house and
the richness of her life.</TE>
<TE>   On their final morning, she curled up on a lounge chair with
Everett, not wanting their vacation to end. They talked and giggled.
Then, too soon, it was time to leave.</TE>
<TE>   The drive home was blissfully uneventful. There was the good
feeling of driving on fresh tires. The kids watched "Scooby-Doo" and
"The Jetsons" in back. John drove the entire way; Jane slept and read
magazines. They all wore their shell necklaces.</TE>
<TE>   Childhood Memories</TE>
<TE>   The same day the Gleasons and Turners left for Phoenix, Gary and
Chris Liggett arrived at the house with their three children. For
Gary, being here brings back waves of childhood memories, and he sees
his past reflected in the lives of his own children as they frolic in
the water and dig in the sand. He wonders if this place will ever
mean to them what it means to him--and what it meant to his parents.</TE>
<TE>   But right now, there's pressing business. On the next day, the
Liggetts will be hosting a company barbecue at the house for 85
people. Gary, 50, is part owner of five tire stores, and once a year
he invites employees and guests over for grilled chicken, burgers and
hot dogs.</TE>
<TE>   The Liggetts enjoy having guests over to the house, unwinding from
their hectic lives at home in nearby Huntington Beach, where Gary and
Chris have lived since 1979. Their three children--daughter Tracy,
15, and sons Trevor, 13, and Travis, 10--grew up there, not here on
Sunset Beach.</TE>
<TE>   But this house on the beach will always be home to Gary. The oil
islands off the coast do not mar the beauty that he sees here.
Located between Seal Beach and Huntington Beach, Sunset Beach is not
Newport or Malibu or Laguna. It does not have the resort amenities,
natural beauty or even the parking of more well-known beaches.</TE>
<TE>   "This place," says Gary, "is magic to me. I don't want to sound
corny, like it's a spiritual deal, but something happens inside when
I'm here. I don't know if it's the openness or the waves or the
constant motion or sound. Maybe it's the roots from growing up here,
but there's definitely a pull."</TE>
<TE>   It was the same pull felt by his mother, Helen, who was renting a
room on Sunset Beach when she met Ivan. After they were married, had
their sons and were in the market for a home, Helen lobbied hard for
the vacant lot on the sand.</TE>
<TE>   Ivan was drawn more to the ocean's beauty than its embrace. In
fact, he rarely entered the water because it bothered his ears; but
he felt at home here, perhaps because of its contrast to the
city--its vastness, not unlike the plains of his native South Dakota.
He often sat in his rattan chair with cigar and scotch, studying the
Pacific landscape framed by the living-room window. Every day after
work, he and Helen had "quiet hour," time to sit alone and talk or
quietly gaze out at the water.</TE>
<TE>   Gary was 4 years old when the family moved in. His earliest
memories begin shortly thereafter. He remembers climbing up on a
shelf in his bedroom closet, where he lived in imaginary worlds, and
crawling beneath the house, built on pilings, to his secret hiding
place.</TE>
<TE>   "Our parents would pretty much tell us to go out and play and to
be back when the street lights came on," Gary says. "It was a
wonderful place to grow up."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most important events in his life took place here. It
is where he met Chris, who grew up on a dairy farm near Barstow and
was staying with a great-aunt down the street while studying
microbiology at Cal State Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, Chris and Gary were walking on the beach when the
topic of children came up. Maybe it was time, they decided. And now
they have three. Some important decisions in their lives have been
made here. Through all the changes in their lives, the ocean has
remained a constant, there for them in the same way it was there for
Helen and Ivan at the end of each day.</TE>
<TE>   When Gary is here, he can close his eyes and hear his mother's
voice calling him home as clearly as he can hear the waves; he can
smell his father's cigars. No matter what else happens in life, this
will always be his home.</TE>
<TE>   Multi-Generational Trip</TE>
<TE>   On the day the Liggetts leave, teenager Rachel Cambon of
Centreville, Va., arrives at the house with her grandmother, Judy
West of McLean, Va., and West's sister, Janet Comer of New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Theirs is a family bound across generations. The main purpose of
the trip is to spend time with Comer and West's father, who lives in
Huntington Beach, where they, too, lived as young children.
Throughout the week they visit him twice a day, cooking for him and
cleaning and tending to whatever needs they can in a week. They also
spend time with two elderly aunts and West's former mother-in-law,
who was injured recently in a fall.</TE>
<TE>   This is their fourth year of staying at the beach house, and so
they notice the new furniture this year, new windows and bigger
television. The house has come to feel familiar, and it's almost like
time stands still, says West, whenever she comes back. "I never think
about going home when I'm here," she says, "It feels like this is
home."</TE>
<TE>   Staying at the house, rather than with relatives, allows them time
to themselves. They spent one day in Hollywood and took a tour of
stars' homes, but for the most part they were at the house when they
weren't expected anywhere else. Rachel, 14, jogged and sunbathed.
West, 56, and Comer, 57, read and went for walks. They went out to
eat at night and usually turned in early.</TE>
<TE>   It's a good time to think, and Comer has been wondering how life
will change upon her husband's retirement at year's end. She wondered
how the new puppy, Gypsy, was doing at home in New Orleans. And she
wondered, as clinical coordinator of the Department of Neurosurgery
at Tulane University Medical School, how she will go about trying to
fill two key vacancies on her staff when she returns to work.</TE>
<TE>   "But I really try to not think about anything," she says, "just
sit back and enjoy. I shelled some lima beans from my aunt's garden
out here [on the deck] the other day, and it was one of the most
peaceful times I've had since we got here."</TE>
<TE>   West, sales coordinator at a hotel, normally reads three
newspapers each day at home, but here she reads none and changes the
channel when the news comes on the television. The house allows them
to face the ocean and turn their backs on the rest of the world. They
forget about the threat of the West Nile virus, the kidnapping of
young girls, Iraq. And they become lost in the clouds and ocean,
dreams and lima beans.</TE>
<TE>   As for young Rachel, who begins high school in the fall, much of
what she wants in life is here. She dreams of becoming an actor, and
at night, when she hears the sound of waves through her bedroom
window, it's like hearing a promise, as real as the wind.</TE>
<TE>   At week's end, when she left this house for home, it was with a
Harley-Davidson T-shirt for her mother, a tan to make her the envy of
friends and the unforgettable feeling of waves and her heart moving
in perfect rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   She can hardly wait to come back.</TE>

<LD>NOBLE OBSESSION</LD>
<LD>   Charles Goodyear, Thomas Hancock and the Race to Unlock the
Greatest Industrial Secret of the Nineteenth Century</LD>
<LD>   By Charles Slack</LD>
<TE>   Theia/Hyperion</TE>
<TE>   304 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   The vulcanization of rubber was one of the great industrial
discoveries of the technologically busy 19th century. By
vulcanization, the gooey substance from trees was made, as Charles
Slack writes in "Noble Obsession," into "the great shock absorber of
the industrial age."</TE>
<TE>   It went on to also provide insulation for electrical power, rubber
belts for assembly lines, springiness for mattresses and sports balls
and running shoes, elasticity for balloons and condoms, and, for
automobiles, tires and all those engine belts. Half the world's
rubber now goes into tires for cars, which were not yet invented when
Charles Goodyear, in 1842, perfected his great discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the useful properties of rubber were known by then, but
the substance was maddeningly hard to use. In hot weather it got
sticky and melted; in cold, it turned brittle, cracked and broke.
Both tendencies were inconvenient for the shoes and coats that were
already being made of rubber because it was impervious to moisture.
Charles Mackintosh had already created his famous waterproof coats of
rubber. Its uses had gone way beyond that which gave it its name,
which was a singular ability as an eraser to rub out what a pencil
had written.</TE>
<TE>   Inventors and businessmen in England and America had been trying
for a couple of decades to devise a process to make rubber constantly
supple and insensitive to temperature changes. They added things to
it, from ammonia to turpentine. Nothing worked.</TE>
<TE>   Goodyear, descended from the earliest white settlers in
Connecticut, was, by his own account and that of others, obsessed
with finding the key to usable rubber. While he pursued his
single-minded search, his growing family endured poverty and he, on
several occasions, debtor's prison. But he persisted and found the
secret. He added sulfur to rubber and heated it. Heat was the thing
that did the trick.</TE>
<TE>   It is not in dispute that the credit for the discovery of
vulcanization goes to Goodyear. But at the time, the credit was much
disputed. By the vagaries of British and American patent law, a
distinguished Englishman, Thomas Hancock, grabbed the British patent
after he received samples of Goodyear's work. A British judge later
affirmed Hancock's claim but acknowledged Goodyear as the true
inventor.</TE>
<TE>   Goodyear obtained the American patent but had to defend it against
various claimants, notorious among them one Horace Day (no known
relation to this reviewer), whom Slack revels in calling "dastardly."</TE>
<TE>   The liveliest section of "Noble Obsession" is the account of the
1852 contest over the patent in a New Jersey courtroom. Goodyear
hired Daniel Webster to represent him and agreed to pay him, if
victorious, $16,000, the highest fee, Slack says, ever earned by an
American lawyer. Webster's opponent, Day's lawyer, was the celebrated
Rufus Choate.</TE>
<TE>   The newspapers of the day said Choate's long argument was
magnificent, but they reported not one word of what he said.
Webster's argument, thorough and grave, survives in all its mid-19th
century eloquence. Webster won, and Goodyear finally had enough money
to live on rather well, though the company that bears his name was
not founded until 38 years after his death in 1860. (The term
"vulcanization," by the way, was coined by a competitor some years
after Goodyear's discovery.)The story of Goodyear and his long slog
toward the attainment of his desire is an interesting one, but Slack
encumbers it with needless details that, accumulated, numb the brain.
Slack records every false start, every distressing setback, until the
reader feels he is confined within one of Goodyear's wretched
workplaces reeking with the scent of burnt rubber. It is not until
late in the book that the narrative takes flight into liveliness, as
Goodyear reaches his goal and bests his enemies and most of his
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Did Goodyear really discover vulcanization or was it a happy
accident, a piece of sulfured rubber dropped on a hot stove, as the
rumor had it? Slack is inclined toward Goodyear's side. He quotes the
inventor's somewhat defensive third-person words: "While the inventor
admits that these discoveries were not the result of scientific
chemical investigations, he is not willing to admit that they were
the result of what is commonly called accident; he claims them to be
the result of the closest application and observation."</TE>
<TE>   "Closest application and observation" nicely sums up the
particular talents of this single-minded 19th century inventor.</TE>

<LD>Make a Paper Airplane</LD>
<LD>   A good way to learn about how objects fly is to make and fly a
paper airplane. Follow the steps below and look at the picture to
make one.</LD>
<LD>   Directions</LD>
<TE>   Step 1: Fold a sheet of paper down the middle from top to bottom
lengthwise. Unfold the paper and smoothly flatten it.</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: Fold the bottom left corner up to meet the center fold.
Then fold the top left corner down to the meet center fold in the
same way.</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Again, fold the bottom left corner up to meet the center
fold. Then fold the top left corner down to meet the center fold.</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Fold the top and bottom together along the center fold.</TE>
<TE>   Step 5: To make the wings, fold the top portion of each side down
to the center fold.</TE>
<TE>   Using a small piece of tape, fasten the wings together. Snip off
the nose of the airplane with a pair of scissors.</TE>
<TE>   Step 6: Launch your paper airplane by holding it at the back and
throwing it forward.</TE>
<TE>   How long does your paper airplane stay in the air? How far can you
throw it? Try throwing it for accuracy. Planes like this need a
streamlined shape to fly well through the air. Can you design some
different shapes?</TE>
<TE>   Remember to fold the paper in the middle for balance. Keep the
front of the paper airplane heavier than the back. Try taping a paper
clip or a penny to the front of the plane or cutting flaps in the
back of the plane. Does it fly farther or with more accuracy?</TE>
<TE>   To find out more about airplanes and how they work, visit "Planes,
Trains &amp; Automobiles" at Discovery Science Center from September
through November. For more information, call (714) 542-CUBE or visit
www.discoverycube.org.</TE>

<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a major league baseball fan, you know the players are greedy and
arrogant. The owners, on the other hand, are greedy, arrogant and
incompetent, led by a man whose team is 27 1/2 games out of first
place.</LD>
<LD>   Both forgot long ago that theirs is the only sport that formally
acknowledges the value of sacrifice.</LD>
<LD>   So, if the players strike today and the World Series is canceled,
where can a baseball fan get his fix?</LD>
<TE>   Books and films on baseball might help, but which ones?</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to novels and short stories of quality, the pickings
are surprisingly slim for a sport that has dominated the national
consciousness for so long.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Roger Angell, the dean of baseball writers and the New
Yorker's fiction editor for more than 40 years, almost never reads
baseball fiction. "It is very hard to make up a baseball team that's
as interesting as any average professional baseball team you can see
on any given day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, conversations with some who have written about baseball
produce a short list of memorable books. Batting first, of course, is
Bernard Malamud's "The Natural," though both Angell and
novelist/screenwriter John Gregory Dunne said they prefer Barry
Levinson's 1984 film adaptation to the book itself. Mark Harris' four
Henry Wiggen novels--"The Southpaw," "Bang the Drum Slowly," "A
Ticket for a Seamstitch" and "It Looked Like For Ever" --have their
partisans, including David Halberstam, who is at work on his second
baseball book.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Bang the Drum Slowly' is my favorite baseball novel,"
Halberstam said from Oregon, where he is researching the 60-year
friendship of baseball greats Bobby Doerr, Ted Williams, Dominic
DiMaggio and Johnny Pesky. " 'The Southpaw' is also very, very
good--underrated, really."</TE>
<TE>   Eliot Asinof's long out-of-print 1955 novel "Man on Spikes,"
recently reissued by Southern Illinois University Press, is regarded
by many critics as a classic account of a minor league player's
20-year struggle to make it to the majors. The same author's
reconstruction of the 1919 Black Sox scandal, "Eight Men Out," is
widely admired. So, too, are Angell's "Once More Around the Park: A
Baseball Reader" and Halberstam's "Summer of '49," an account of that
year's race for the American League pennant between the Yankees and
the Red Sox. Roger Kahn's "The Boys of Summer" also is highly
regarded.</TE>
<TE>   Novelist and screenwriter David Freeman would add two more titles
to the fiction shelf. "My favorite candidates," he said, "are Robert
Coover's 'The Universal Baseball Association, Inc: J. Hen Waugh,
Prop.', which is about a guy who imagines an entire universe of
baseball. It's actually the granddaddy of rotisserie baseball, which
makes it the perfect book for your basic baseball nut to read during
a strike. The other book is Philip Roth's 'The Great American Novel,'
which is a nutty attempt to blend fiction and baseball into the great
American novel. It's really more for grad students than fans, but
it's memorable because it has a character named Gil Gamesh."</TE>
<TE>   Strangely enough, there's more agreement--as well as pleasure--in
the writers' list of worthy baseball movies.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman's candidate for the best to watch during a strike is John
Sayles' 1988 adaptation of "Eight Men Out." He also likes "Bang the
Drum Slowly," made in 1973, for which Harris also did the screenplay,
"if only because it's a lovely early Robert De Niro film. I think
'The Natural' is even more fun to watch now than when it came out.
You can see Glenn Close before she was famous and Robert Redford in
his absolute prime. It's a movie with a little bit of mysticism and a
lot of baseball." The 1988 movie "Bull Durham," he said, is
"irresistible and memorable cinematically because it launches a
wonderful director, Ron Shelton. Any of those films would be more fun
than watching a bunch of corporate bozos batter each other in these
endless negotiations."</TE>
<TE>   "Bull Durham" also happens to be Angell's "all-time favorite
baseball film because it's about baseball and about sex, both great
things to be about. My least favorite baseball film is 'Field of
Dreams,' which is such baloney, sweet and gooey. Ballplayers loved
it, though. It left them in tears. But they weren't the only ones. I
remember coming out of a screening of that awful film and running
into my friend and neighbor Mike Wallace. 'Wasn't that awful?' I
said, and then noticed he was weeping."</TE>
<TE>   Halberstam's film favorite is "Bang the Drum Slowly," for "Michael
Moriarty's absolutely wonderful performance. 'Bull Durham' is very
nicely done, but I think 'The Natural' shared--and, indeed,
revealed--the book's flaws. It was too studied, too allegorical and
self-conscious. 'Eight Men Out' is a quiet and heartbreaking film."</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, writers are like other fans, nostalgic but weary of the
national pastime's dreary fiscal soap opera.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost interest in baseball when I moved back to New York," said
Dunne. "In Los Angeles I would go--always by myself--to see 15 or 16
games a year. I'd always get to Dodger Stadium at 4 in the afternoon,
when they opened the parking lots. I loved the beauty of the place
and of the rituals, like batting practice. When I first came to L.A.
in 1964, the pitchers still warmed up in front of the dugout, so your
sense of them was more intimate. I always left by the fifth inning
because I didn't really care about the score, but the true beauty of
the game itself. I always made a point of watching Sandy Koufax pitch
because it was so beautiful, like watching Baryshnikov dance."</TE>
<TE>   Halberstam said that "like most fans, I have a
plague-on-both-their-houses attitude. These owners could screw up a
two-car funeral. The players have turned out to be very shrewd
capitalists, but in this economy and in this country, right now,
almost nobody is on their side. I think that, in the end, all of them
have exhausted all of us."</TE>

<LD>LAS VEGAS--These blister-causing floors are not made for walking in
high-glam Jimmy Choos. Just look at the feet of the nearly 80,000
fashion hounds here on the hunt for next spring's newest looks at
this biannual clothing convention. They're in sneakers and
flip-flops, jeans and shorts, tank tops and more tank tops. After
all, it's 104 degrees outside.</LD>
<LD>   New York, Milan and Paris may have their runways, but when it
comes to fashion for the masses, the MAGIC trade show is the biggest
draw in the West. Held at the Las Vegas Convention Center and Sands
Expo, the four-day event, which ended Thursday, featured 3,000
exhibitors offering everything from street wear to the latest in
corporate office style.</LD>
<LD>   Mostly, looks were knockoffs of each other and repeats of the last
several seasons: ethnic-inspired tops, vintage wear, garments made to
look handmade (crocheting and patch-worked) and lots of low-rise
suede and rawhide-embellished denim for both men and women.</LD>
<TE>   MAGIC, an acronym for the Men's Apparel Guild in California, is
now almost 70 years old and just isn't about clothing for guys
anymore. There also was plenty of junior contemporary and young
women's brands.</TE>
<TE>   When store buyers weren't browsing or placing orders, they partied
with exhibitors and others, attending an endless stream of hyped
events during the day and night that featured an opening night
concert by the band Counting Crows, appearances from rappers, free
booze and dancing at various Las Vegas Strip hotels and casinos,
where often, impromptu partying broke out at crap tables.</TE>
<TE>   The most popular new wave of denim washes and treatments is tagged
"wrinkling." Jeans are coated with a resin on the top front and at
the back knee and then baked, resulting in a permanent wrinkle.</TE>
<TE>   Native Angeleno designer and former lawyer Bobby Benveniste goes a
step further with his denim treatments for his Eisbar line by
shirring jeans along the side at the knees and embroidering back
pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Benveniste and partner, Kiernan Lambeth, were here to kick off
their label's new women's line. On Tuesday, "we wrote our first
order. Being here is really the only way to reach national and
international traffic," said Benveniste. "More important is that
we're getting a lot of attention from Japanese buyers. They take L.A.
style and fashion very seriously. For them, shopping is a hobby, and
they love low-rise and vintage aesthetics."</TE>
<TE>   Think big, says L.A. designer Freddie Rojas, who creates a line
called Private. He was doing brisk business with buyers interested in
his new larger and plus sizes for men and women.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm doing this for my hip-hop boys with 38-and 40-inch waists who
come up to me and say, 'I'm too big to wear your clothes. Make
clothes that we can wear too.' So I did," said Rojas, who operates a
Melrose Avenue boutique.</TE>
<TE>   For the coming spring, he says he'll also have looks for women in
sizes 12 and larger "because fashion has to be about what's real out
there."</TE>
<TE>   As if there were not enough neon and blinking lights in this city,
Jerry Phlippeau, president of Flipo Group Limited, still drew mobs of
buyers and looky-loos to his booth that tripped the light fantastic.
Phlippeau, a former musician with the L.A. band Bad Box, now sells
blinking light accessories for hair, rings on fingers, pins for
jeans' jackets, bracelets, watches and pierced ears.</TE>
<TE>   "Our band used to play at the Cathouse in the late '80s, Club
Lingerie, the Roxy. Man, I love L.A.," says the suited businessman,
who began his Flipo brand five years ago after he created bicycle
safety lights he glued onto a body and showed them off at an L.A.
club.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 16 he plans on selling 100,000 pairs of blinking Flipo
earrings ($8 to $10) when he makes his first QVC appearance.</TE>
<TE>   If the clothes are good enough for the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department, why not Fred Segal?</TE>
<TE>   New Yorker Michael Spiewak, whose firm designs outerwear for
71,000 law enforcement agencies across the country, has made that
connection: His uniform-inspired street clothes are sold at the
trendy Southland boutique.</TE>
<TE>   "We started selling to the L.A. sheriff's force in the early
1970s," Spiewak said, adding that the last time he outfitted the
force with new outerwear was about five years ago. "And I have to
tell you, those men and women out there are the handsomest bunch of
people."</TE>
<TE>   The company, which will send out a spring line of funky T-shirts
and Boy and Girl Scout-inspired shirts adorned with merit patches,
moved into street-wear apparel in the mid-1990s "because it was just
a natural progression for us. It was a time when down jackets became
popular."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Spiewak recalls how designer Randolph Duke placed an
order for him to create the bulky, bulbous jackets a few years ago
that the designer then put over evening gowns.</TE>
<TE>   Says Spiewak: "You gotta love fashion."</TE>

<HD>Black Suit Is Versatile With Proper Shirt, Tie</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I have a black Armani suit that I wear to
weddings, parties, etc.</LD>
<LD>   I'm usually pretty good at picking elements of clothing, but I
can't seem to arrive at a good shirt and tie to go with the suit,
which I need to wear to an upcoming wedding. I tried the "Regis" look
and felt ridiculous. What colors and types of shirts and ties do you
recommend with a black suit?</LD>
<LD>   --SUITING UP</LD>
<TE>   Dear Suiting: You've discovered that a good black suit can take
you far--to weddings, bar mitzvahs, funerals, cocktail parties and
the theater, since its look can change depending on the shirt and
tie. This is a concept women have been familiar with for some time,
extending their wardrobes with a little black dress or a three-piece
suit (jacket, skirt, trousers), and dressing them up, down and
sideways.</TE>
<TE>   What you wear with your black suit should be determined by the
occasion and your own tastes. For a funeral, for example, we wouldn't
recommend getting funky with an electric blue shirt and an Andy
Warhol print tie.</TE>
<TE>   Serious events demand serious attire, so stick with a white, ivory
or pale-blue shirt and fairly conservative tie, such as a subtle
geometric print or foulard pattern.</TE>
<TE>   For a wedding you can have more fun, since this is a festive
celebration. Let your own color preferences lead you. If you're not a
bold color kind of guy, try shirts in sage green, wheat or gray-blue
and a tie that either picks up that shade or complements it. Instead
of thinking the tone-on-tone Regis look (so tired, by the way), think
layering colors in harmonious hues.</TE>
<TE>   If you're not afraid of sporting color, then let the shirt be the
focal point.</TE>
<TE>   A mustard gold or sea-blue shirt shouldn't compete with the tie,
so choose a dark solid or subtle pattern that references the shirt
and works nicely with the jacket. With that mustard shirt, for
instance, a tie in deep plum with touches of gold would coordinate
well.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: A couple years ago a co-worker chided me for
wearing a brown leather watch strap with black leather shoes. As a
result, I have two nice watches with leather straps to coordinate
with my dress and work shoes: I wear brown with brown, and black with
black.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's time to replace my brown leather wallet, and I'm
wondering if it would behoove me to have a black version and a brown
version, the way women do with their purses? Or would I be better off
spending the extra money on some counseling?</TE>
<TE>   --WORRIED</TE>
<TE>   Dear Worried: When it comes to accessorizing our wardrobes there's
a fine line that we continually have to decide whether to cross or
not cross. Should we worry about our belt matching our shoes? About
our earrings matching our necklace? About our umbrella matching our
raincoat? Can such questions drive you insane? Yes.</TE>
<TE>   So when do we know when to stop obsessing? When we start to get
bogged down in outfit minutiae. We define that by being overly
preoccupied with insignificant items or items that almost never see
the light of day, e.g., a wallet.</TE>
<TE>   If you'd like to have a wallet wardrobe we won't stop you. But
just having one wallet, either brown or black, is perfectly fine.
Just make sure it's not scuffed or worn and isn't bulging with so
many receipts and credit cards that it creates an unsightly
protrusion when placed in your pocket. If someone does suggest that
you think about coordinating your wallet with your belt, watch strap
and shoes, suggest that he or she may be the one who needs
counseling.</TE>
<TE>   From the Fashion Police blotter: Remember, we still need your
comments about back-to-school shopping. Please let us know your
shopping strategies, if they've changed from previous years, what
kind of pre-shopping research you've done, if you like what you're
seeing in stores, how much say you let your children have in
selecting their outfits, and if you're willing to give up chocolate
for a year in exchange for your kids' school opting for uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   Please include your name, the city in which you live and a phone
number.</TE>

<HD>A Rock Institution Rolls Away Wrinkles</HD>
<DH>Magazine's antidote for aging is to not act its age.
Critics decry loss of its culture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUISE ROUG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new Rolling Stone--with shorter stories, more bullet points,
gadget reviews and a 38-year-old British editor--hits newsstands
today, with a cover story on the Vines, an emerging Aussie rock band.
So far, reaction in media circles is looking like a boomer slugfest.</LD>
<LD>   "What do you do when you hit your midlife crisis? Do you start
acting like a teenager, or do you get depressed and cocoon?" said
Samir Husni, 49, a professor of magazine journalism at the University
of Mississippi. "I think they opted to buy the convertible and start
acting like a teenager."</LD>
<LD>   (The teenager in question is Blender, a new music magazine
tailored to the attention-impaired generation. Pressed by declining
newsstand sales and the new competition, Rolling Stone founder and
publisher Jann Wenner chose to "Blenderize," Husni said.)</LD>
<TE>   Wenner, 56, is having none of it. "On the subject of Blender,"
Wenner said Thursday from his New York office, "it's way
over-hyped.... Their claim to success is really bogus."</TE>
<TE>   Andy Pemberton, the British editor in chief of Blender,
paraphrased his countryman to respond to Wenner: "He doth protest too
much."</TE>
<TE>   Wenner is equally dismissive of critics such as Samuel G.
Freedman, a professor of journalism at Columbia University who wrote
in USA Today last month: "Now, one of the most worthless trends in
magazine journalism--the rise of the so-called 'laddie' magazines
such as Maxim--has been handed the living legacy that is Rolling
Stone.... It's the oldest story in the world that stupidity sells.
The question is why intelligence sold out."</TE>
<TE>   "He leaped to all these conclusions," Wenner said. "He's a
disgruntled guy because times have changed on him.... It's a
sentimental thing. He's sad that his youth has passed. He's going to
take it out on an institution that remains young, but he's looking in
the mirror."</TE>
<TE>   (Freedman said he didn't want to make a career of criticizing
Rolling Stone and declined to comment for this story.)</TE>
<TE>   "At least initially, the signs of what people feared are on
display--shorter stories, the more flesh-filled photos," said Brent
Cunningham, the 36-year-old managing editor of the Columbia
Journalism Review. The new issue has more sidebars, more smallish
features and a greatly expanded "back of the book," with more than
100 CD reviews, nearly five times the usual number.</TE>
<TE>   The longer pieces that established the magazine as a cultural
force will appear less frequently. Where words used to go, there will
be skin. "I would hope there's more skin," Wenner said. "It should be
a little sexier."</TE>
<TE>   The competition for readers and for readers' time is fierce, said
Rolling Stone's new editor, Ed Needham. "When Rolling Stone started,
it was the only game in town," he said. "The reality on the newsstand
is very different. The serious, in-depth pieces ... features that run
over many pages, that formula isn't so successful these days."</TE>
<TE>   The criticism, he said, comes from nostalgia. "The brand value of
Rolling Stone--it produces such a warm and pleasant feeling," Needham
said. "It's the emotional glow they seem to experience when they
think of Rolling Stone."</TE>
<TE>   Rolling Stone has a paid circulation of 1.25 million. But
newsstand sales have declined nearly 16% in the first half of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   "So they can't be that fond of it," Needham said. "The word I
would stress to everybody is energy. I want the magazine to feel
energetic, exciting. Part of the problem that Rolling Stone is facing
is what other magazines are facing too, that the ad recession is
biting so deep.... If we have fewer editorial pages, a gigantic 12-to
15-page spread in the middle of the magazine, it will be like an
elephant in a bathtub, the balance is out of whack. It's a factor of
the economy rather than an editorial decision."</TE>
<TE>   Wenner understands why he's facing criticism for changing a
publishing institution. "Few magazines have such resonance for that
generation," he said. "Rolling Stone has always stood for something.
It was always far more than a marketing package."</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore, some fear.</TE>
<TE>   Milton Glaser, the graphic designer who created the I {heart}NY
logo and has been involved in redesigns of major publications, said
magazines are becoming less interesting, and that Rolling Stone is
just another example of the trend.</TE>
<TE>   "What you see is what happens once financial issues become the
overriding concern: Aesthetics, beauty, truth were once a
counterpoint, now they're eliminated," Glaser said. "It's tired
stuff, it's exploitative, it's not life-enhancing."</TE>
<TE>   But Wenner said the new Rolling Stone is just packaged
differently. "You won't miss a word," he said. Stories will still be
culturally relevant. "We're not walking away from that. Not while I'm
alive.''</TE>

<LD>It seemed as though the days were creeping along now that Nellie was
excited about meeting her grandfather and getting acquainted with
him.</LD>
<LD>   At the library she found books about Korean culture. She copied a
recipe for duk, the rice cakes that many Korean people enjoy so much.
She planned to make some for her oe haraboji. Because she practiced
it, the Korean word for grandfather was easy to remember and
pronounce.</LD>
<LD>   Mr. and Mrs. Connors and Nellie were up early on the morning of
Grandfather Lee's arrival. They drove to a parking lot near Los
Angeles Airport and boarded a shuttle bus. The bus dropped them off
at Tom Bradley International Terminal, where they would meet Mr. Lee.</LD>
<TE>   Nellie was excited and nervous. She hoped her grandfather would
like her poster and that he would approve of the rice cakes.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother had purchased some porich'a (poree-chah), tea made from
barley, which is served in Korean restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   As passengers began coming up the ramp from customs, Nellie held
her poster above the railing so her grandfather would see it. The
girl wore the traditional gown, a blue hanbok, with glittering,
gold-stripped sleeves. Her mother stood holding the rice cakes.</TE>
<TE>   A broad smile creased Mr. Lee's face when he noticed the large
poster and the little girl grinning at him. Rice cakes and a happy
little granddaughter, Mr. Lee thought. Now his life really would be
complete.</TE>
<TE>   "Grandfather!" Nellie shouted. She ran to him with arms
outstretched. He scooped her up in a warm embrace, thrilled to be
part of a loving family again.</TE>
<TE>   Tori Smith is a freelance writer from Tucson. She is the aunt of
two Korean American children. This story will be on The Times' Web
site at www.latimes.com/kids. A new, five-part story begins Monday.</TE>

<HD>Taking Care of Business News</HD>
<DH>Television* Overlooked by cable rivals, Neil Cavuto's show
has taken the lead. He speaks out when the Fox News program doesn't
get its due.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BAUDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Neil Cavuto has a sunny personality, the kind that manages to find a
bright side to a crippling disease.</LD>
<LD>   Yet if the business news anchor perceives any kind of slight, then
watch out. As with many of his colleagues at Fox News Channel, that's
when a feisty side emerges.</LD>
<LD>   The people at Microsoft found out about that in June when none of
their executives was available to talk about a deal with Verizon on
Cavuto's show. Backed by the headline "Why not on Fox?" Cavuto
protested on the air and flashed telephone numbers and e-mail
addresses of Microsoft representatives.</LD>
<TE>   CNN learned, too, when Cavuto complained in a commentary this
spring about an advertisement that touts ratings for Lou Dobbs'
"Moneyline" telecast while ignoring Cavuto. "Just be truthful,"
Cavuto said. "I'm not going to fudge facts with you. I think that
life's too short."</TE>
<TE>   And now so will an old friend, Ron Insana of CNBC. Asked about
Insana's comments this summer that he didn't consider Cavuto's
program a business show, Cavuto dismissed Insana's "Business Center"
as a boring show for wonks.</TE>
<TE>   All this at a time when Cavuto should be basking in professional
triumph.</TE>
<TE>   While much of the cable TV world was focused on the battle for
viewers between "Moneyline" and "Business Center," Fox's "Your World
With Neil Cavuto" was quietly becoming a force.</TE>
<TE>   This month, "Your World" has averaged 598,000 viewers, a 140%
increase over August 2001. CNN's "Moneyline" is at 484,000 viewers,
and CNBC's "Business Center" had 307,000, according to Nielsen Media
Research.</TE>
<TE>   Think Cavuto noticed all those months when people pretended he
didn't exist?</TE>
<TE>   You bet.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when we were doing worse than the other two, it should have
been noted," he said. "It doesn't matter if we were on at a different
time. We were on at a much tougher time."</TE>
<TE>   The CNN and CNBC shows compete at the dinner hour on the East
Coast, midafternoon on the West. Cavuto's show airs at 1 p.m. on the
West Coast, a time he selected when he jumped to Fox from CNBC in
1996 because he wanted to be first on the air after the markets
closed.</TE>
<TE>   CNN and CNBC tend to dismiss comparisons with Cavuto because of
the different time slot. There's also a feeling that "Your World" has
benefited from Fox's general rise; its ratings have soared as CNBC's
sank.</TE>
<TE>   Insana believes the programs are trying to do different things.</TE>
<TE>   "In order to survive on a general news network, some of our
presumed competitors in the business world have reoriented toward
more general news," the "Business Center" anchor said. "They're not
really business news shows anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Cavuto said "Your World" covers business stories and the stock
market but tries not to turn off viewers who aren't immersed in those
topics. He doesn't have a stock ticker on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   "If he means that we're not a market wonk show or a boring show or
a typical CNBC show, he's right," Cavuto said. "We're a general
business news show that doesn't distinguish between what happens in
the business world and what happens in the real world."</TE>
<TE>   Insana said that Cavuto was quite passionate about CNBC's news
when he was working at CNBC.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not more wonkish than anybody else who is focused on the
business market and economic information," he said. "Our focus is to
provide that information to people--not to water it down, not to make
it lighter. We don't provide commentary."</TE>
<TE>   Give these old pals a pair of boxing gloves!</TE>
<TE>   Cavuto conceded that people thought he was nuts to leave CNBC. But
he was tempted by the offer from Roger Ailes, Fox News Channel's
chairman, to start his own show and manage his own staff.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were a pivotal moment for the show,
Cavuto said. Several people he interviewed as regular sources were
killed at the World Trade Center, and Cavuto memorialized them on the
air. He focused on their personal stories instead of the financial
impact of the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Staying with the human element was important to viewers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "In a numbers world, it's really the human touch that counts," he
said. "Viewers know we're with them. Even in a bear market, people
stuck with us because they knew we're not going to pander to them,
they knew we're not going to talk down to them, they knew we weren't
going to hype anything. I think they trusted us."</TE>
<TE>   The 43-year-old Cavuto survived Hodgkin's disease more than a
decade ago. He said that experience has made him less prone to
playing it safe professionally.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after starting at Fox, he received another crushing
diagnosis: He has multiple sclerosis. Physically, he has his good
days and his tougher ones, when walking is difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to change the physical verdict that life gave me, but I
can't," he said. "Am I going to mope or be depressed about it?"</TE>
<TE>   He tries not to. He even says--with a straight face--that there
are good things about it.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me appreciate the fight of the day-to-day," he said.
"Some people who have this disease say it makes them passive or calm.
Not me. It makes me constantly want to try to do different things. I
really don't care about failing in a career. There are things much
worse than that."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for Fox, he's not failing. Nor is he antsy for change:
Cavuto recently signed a five-year contract extension.</TE>

<LD>From a few minutes of silence to a week's worth of in-depth reports,
local radio stations are offering listeners a broad spectrum of
programming to commemorate the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "This day, more than any other, is a moment for reflection--not
only on what we've lost and how we've changed, but where we're
going," said National Public Radio's Neal Conan, who will co-anchor
that network's coverage for the day.</LD>
<LD>   Starting at 5 a.m. on Sept. 11, NPR plans to supplement its lineup
of news, analysis and call-in programs with live reports from
ceremonies in New York City, at the Pentagon and at the Shanksville,
Pa., crash site. In addition, Conan--who on weekdays is the host of
NPR's midday call-in show "Talk of the Nation"--will host a four-hour
program in which callers and guests can discuss the importance of
public mourning, and remember what they had done a year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Local public stations have much of their own special programming
planned, as well, with KPCC-FM (89.3) featuring a week of in-depth
reports, analyses and features.</TE>
<TE>   Starting Tuesday and running through Sept. 10, public radio
stations nationwide will air the series "Understanding America After
9/11." In what they're billing as a groundbreaking collaboration,
KPCC has joined to produce the series with 10 other public radio
outlets around the country, including WNYC in New York, WAMU in
Washington, D.C., KQED in San Francisco, WBUR in Boston and Minnesota
Public Radio. In addition to the big-picture view of national
remembrance, the series will include stories from communities and
individuals.</TE>
<TE>   The series begins at 5 a.m. Tuesday with "American Muslims
Organize," the story of Muslim leaders in Southern California helping
members of their community become more politically active and
media-savvy. They have felt besieged and had their patriotism
questioned since Sept. 11. The program repeats at 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Recounting Prejudice</TE>
<TE>   At 9 a.m., "A Portrait of Hedab" is the half-hour audio diary of
Hedab El Tarifi, a Palestinian American in Los Angeles who sorts
through the prejudice she and friends have faced in the past year,
and the changing role of Muslims in U.S. society.</TE>
<TE>   At 9 p.m., an hourlong program titled "Defending the Future" will
examine how America's military has changed since the terrorist
attacks, with musings from a range of people including Secretary of
Defense Donald Rumsfeld, fighter pilots' wives, a Navy doctor
remembering the scene at the Pentagon fire, and green recruits
anticipating combat.</TE>
<TE>   "Days of Infamy" at 9 p.m. Wednesday focuses on the two times
Library of Congress field workers interviewed Americans about their
reactions to surprise attacks: after Pearl Harbor and Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Other programs in the days leading up to the
anniversary--including a full schedule on Sept. 8--will examine the
religious and moral questions raised by the 9/11 attacks and their
aftermath, the views of a theologian and a business leader on how the
nation and world have changed in the past year, the peace movement in
post-Sept. 11 America, changing views of citizenship, as seen by
diverse Californians, and the experiences of an L.A. bounty hunter
who tracks down illegal aliens. The Sonic Memorial Project, a
collaboration of NPR News and independent radio producers nationwide,
will air remembrances, messages, poetry and music during NPR's
afternoon newsmagazine "All Things Considered" on Sept. 9, 10 and 11.
The show airs weekdays on KPCC at 3 p.m. and KCRW-FM (89.9) at 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   An hourlong special by the Sonic Memorial Project will also air
Thursday at noon on KPCC, and Sept. 7, at 9 a.m. on KCRW. It will
examine the little-known history of the World Trade Center, including
stories about the Mohawk Indian steelworkers who built it, the
"building stewardesses" who educated skeptical New Yorkers at the
construction site as the huge towers went up, and of "Radio Row," the
neighborhood of decades-old electronics stores displaced by the new
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   KCRW and KPCC will both air a live call-in show at 10 a.m. on
Sept. 7. "Living with Terror: The World Speaks a Year After 9/11"
will allow callers from around the globe to discuss topics such as
whether the war on terror can ever really be won, and how residents
in Ireland and Israel have coped with terror.</TE>
<TE>   A companion show, "Living With Terror: America Speaks," at 10 a.m.
the following day, will feature town-hall discussions from Los
Angeles, Boston and Minneapolis-St. Paul on topics including whether
heightened security measures undercut American freedoms, and why some
people and governments elsewhere in the world hate the United States.</TE>
<TE>   On KCRW on Sept. 11, "Which Way L.A.?" and "To the Point" host
Warren Olney will look at the national mood and how life has changed
in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Even KCRW's music programs will join the commemoration, with Nic
Harcourt on "Morning Becomes Eclectic" and Jason Bentley in the
evening on "Metropolis" playing special music.</TE>
<TE>   Music stations are not leaving the memorials to the news and talk
stations, by any means. Country station KZLA-FM (93.9) is slated to
play versions of the national anthem at the top of each hour, and
feature commentary by musicians and listeners alike, said Jimmy
Steal, regional vice president for Emmis Communications, which owns
KZLA. On its sister station KPWR-FM (105.9), morning host Big Boy
will add his reflections to comments from listeners and hip-hop
artists, Steal said.</TE>
<TE>   "The overall tone is positive, reflective," he said. Rather than
revisit last year's horror, "give thanks we live in a society where
we're free. The silver lining is, we live in the best country in the
world."</TE>
<TE>   "It's really important that each station reflect the vibe of what
their audience is feeling," no matter what the format, Steal said.</TE>
<TE>   All eight of the local stations owned by Clear Channel
Communications--ranging from Star 98.7 (KYSR-FM) to talk station
KFI-AM (640)--will air two minutes of silence at 8:45 a.m., followed
by a four-minute program featuring an interview with President Bush,
which will also be played on Clear Channel's 1,200 stations
nationwide, according to company spokesman Bill Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   "Our whole emphasis is going to be looking forward, rather than a
retrospective of what happened on 9/11," Lewis said, and will include
specials from KFI reporter Laura Ingle from ground zero, and from
KLAC-AM (570) morning man Gil Gross.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer Commercials</TE>
<TE>   KNX-AM (1070) will air the day's news stories, as it always
does--which on Sept. 11 will be heavy on memorials, speeches and
other remembrances.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not changing the format of the station for the day," said
KNX news director Ed Pyle, like blocking off huge segments of time
for events such as the reading of the terror victims' names. But the
station will have a bit more time to linger on presidential comments
and other events.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have a lighter commercial load than we usually do," Pyle
said. "It hasn't been by our instigation. Some advertisers are shying
away from the day."</TE>
<TE>   According to an Advertising Age magazine survey, 51% of consumers
polled thought advertising would be inappropriate on Sept. 11, while
only 34% thought it unnecessary for advertisers to back off. Pyle
noted, however, that the fewer ads phenomenon seems more prevalent
the farther east you go, closer to the scenes of the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It has to be a special day," said Jay Kernis, NPR's senior vice
president for programming. "It has to be the right balance of
information and reflection.</TE>
<TE>   "Radio may have an advantage on Sept. 11," he said. "People know
what the pictures look like, and many people don't want to see the
pictures again. This is providing an aural space where people can go
remember if they want to remember, and connect with the rest of the
country."</TE>

<HD>'I'm Going Home' Embarks on a Simple Yet Complex Journey</HD>

<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The great Portuguese filmmaker Manoel de Oliveira makes mischief as
nimbly as he makes movies. A critical darling appreciated for his wit
and intelligence, the director has a gift for pushing an audience to
its limits, a puckish trait that can be felt, rather acutely, in the
first minutes of "I'm Going Home."</LD>
<LD>   The deeply felt story of an actor coming to the end of a long
personal run, the film opens with a nerve-testing excerpt from Eugene
Ionesco's 1962 play "Exit the King," about a ruler whose empire
withers into nothingness with his last breath. The 400-year-old king,
Berenger the First, is anguishing about his impending demise: After
generations of glory, during which he founded Paris and wrote
tragedies under the name of Shakespeare, he has discovered that he
has only the rest of the play in which to live. Death--along with
regrets about the life not lived--troubles his mind, just as it will
that of Gilbert Valence (Michel Piccoli), the actor playing the king,
who that evening learns that his wife, daughter and son-in-law have
died in a car accident, leaving him sole guardian of a young grandson
(Jean Koeltgen).</LD>
<TE>   Set in Paris, the story for "I'm Going Home" is simplicity itself.
Gilbert takes in his grandson, continues to work and, after a short
peace, realizes that his own end is near. That spells out what
happens but doesn't get at the elegiac how. How when Piccoli, the
roguishly sexy husband from Godard's "Contempt," rolls his bass of a
voice like thunder, like Zeus himself, he makes you forget the
76-year-old in front of your eyes, now plumped and stooped and nearly
bald. How, when after a period of mourning, Gilbert reenters the
bustle of Paris as if he were seeing the world for the first time,
whether he's admiring the elegant lines of a store mannequin's head
or the pair of handsome brogues that bring a new spring to his step.
And, finally, painfully, how Gilbert, the distinguished actor of film
and television (even lovely young things beg for his autograph),
without a drop of sentimentalism, begins to play the role that all of
us everywhere dread--his last.</TE>
<TE>   The most belated of late bloomers, the 93-year-old De Oliveira
made short films and documentaries, along with a feature for
children, before directing his first feature for adults in 1972. He's
been on a roll ever since, directing a film for each year of the
1990s, many of which have screened at Cannes and have been critically
acclaimed, primarily in Europe. "I'm Going Home" is one of only a
handful of his features to secure release in this country, which says
a great deal about the impoverished state of foreign-language film
distribution here and our increasing intolerance of "difficult"
movies.</TE>
<TE>   De Oliveira's work offers philosophical and narrative puzzles of
varying degrees of obscurity. However beautifully shot and directed,
his films can be tough to grasp in one sitting and remain doggedly
unfashionable, belonging to a time when the educated classes were
rooted in literature, rather than in pop culture. Two of his latest
features, for instance, include a soporific biography about a 17th
century Jesuit priest ("Word and Utopia") and an eccentrically
charming update of a 17th century French novel ("The Letter"),
neither of which, lamentably, was released here.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm Going Home" is by far the most approachable of the director's
recent films, with an emotional depth that's true to life and a
streamlined narrative that for long stretches barely contains a word.
If it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is
young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker's son, more incredible
still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor
and director take on life's urgent questions. Soon after Gilbert
returns to the stage (notably in "The Tempest"), his close friend and
agent, George (Antoine Chappey), attempts to sell him on a part in a
television series.</TE>
<TE>   After listening to the ludicrous plot synopsis ("There's a lot of
action," the agent promises), Gilbert erupts in anger, roaring that
he has a career and professional ethics to uphold. As with the rest
of us, as with Ionesco's dying king, perhaps even as with De Oliveira
himself, the old actor wants to be the author of his own story. But
life, fate, what have you has a way of wrecking even our best-laid
plans, writing chapters for us that we never imagined for ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   And so Gilbert takes one last job. Against his better instincts,
the venerable French actor signs on with an American film director (a
deliciously supercilious John Malkovich) to play the very Irish Buck
Mulligan in what looks like the world's worst adaptation of James
Joyce's "Ulysses." It's a disaster, of course, by turns absurd,
humiliating and utterly devastating. Enter Gilbert in a fright wig
and glued-on mustache; exit the king once more. And yet as Samuel
Beckett, one of De Oliveira's inspirations, famously wrote, "You must
go on, I can't go on, I'll go on."</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't get more complex than that or simpler; it's also a
pretty good way to sum up the beauty, the honesty and the hard
emotional tug of De Oliveira's work and of his worldview. If there's
a reason that "I'm Coming Home" finally feels more hopeful than its
subject suggests it's because, well, as its director gently lets us
know, in the end--in ours as well as in Gilbert's--the most important
question isn't how we die but how we live.</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: There's some discussion of sex and
death, but it's all above the neck.</TE>

<HD>Even 1970s Rock Fests Need Film Preservation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN ELBER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is accurate to say that David Bowie and the Rolling Stones are
equally well-preserved. On film, that is.</LD>
<LD>   The proof is in American Movie Classics' 10th annual film
preservation festival, which includes restored versions of Bowie's
"Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars" (1973) and the Stones'
"Gimme Shelter" (1970).</LD>
<LD>   The theme for the anniversary celebration is "Rock 'n' Roll in the
Movies," with an emphasis on the 1970s, when Hollywood moviemakers
and the rock world were groovin' to the same beat--or trying to.</LD>
<TE>   The three-day festival, today through Sunday, includes "Ziggy
Stardust," "Gimme Shelter" and the Bee Gees-flavored "Saturday Night
Fever" (1977) among films in which the art forms clicked. Then there
are misses such as "Godspell" (1973) and "Thank God It's Friday"
(1978).</TE>
<TE>   Even the latter movie, despite its mediocrity, had an excuse for
living: It offers disco queen Donna Summer and that unbeatably catchy
anthem "Last Dance."</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of great moments of rock 'n' roll have been captured in
movies," AMC programming executive David Serhing said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those moments and some influential films, including the
1970 documentary "Woodstock," are absent from the festival.</TE>
<TE>   But there are key films, including a restored "The Last Waltz,"
which chronicled the final concert of the Band in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Scorsese, the film's director, supervised the restoration;
the Band's Robbie Robertson took charge of remixing and remastering
the soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese is president of the Film Foundation, which helps promote
and fund film preservation and is involved in the AMC festival.</TE>
<TE>   "The Last Waltz" helps kick off the first night, airing at 7
tonight. It follows the 5 p.m. debut of an original documentary,
"Hollywood Rocks the Movies: The 1970s."</TE>
<TE>   The ever-elegant Bowie narrates the documentary, which boogies
through the decade when Hollywood was unafraid of movie musicals and
musicians found success through exposure in films.</TE>
<TE>   Offering generous clips, the documentary trips through a dizzying
array of '70s genres: reggae; disco; glam, classic and punk rock; and
"avant-garde extravaganzas," as Bowie puts it, including the
resounding flop "Xanadu" (1980).</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of bad films that came out in the '70s, especially
when you got on the music side," the Bee Gees' Maurice Gibb says in
the documentary. "It was really cashing in on what 'Saturday Night
Fever' had done, and you cannot repeat a phenomenon."</TE>
<TE>   Repetition being a Hollywood trademark, the studios tried. One
mind-boggling failure was "Can't Stop the Music" (1980), featuring
the Village People, Valerie Perrine and Olympic athlete Bruce Jenner.</TE>
<TE>   Among the documentary's juicy tidbits: Elvis Presley's manager
talked him out of playing a fading rock star in "A Star Is Born"
(1976), giving Kris Kristofferson the role opposite Barbra Streisand.</TE>
<TE>   AMC, which has drawn fire for introducing commercial breaks during
movies, said it will present "Gimme Shelter," "The Last Waltz" and
"Ziggy Stardust" uninterrupted. Other films will include a break to
promote preservation.</TE>
<TE>   AMC has raised about $2 million for preservation, Serhing said.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is people take movies for granted," he said, or tend to
think only of obscure silent films as suffering the ravages of time.
But newer movies, including beloved rock fests, can become victims.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get the message across that even these may fade and
pass if we're not careful or are unaware," Serhing said.</TE>
<TE>   Pre-1950 movies on nitrate stock are most vulnerable to
degradation. But newer, acetate plastic film can suffer "vinegar
syndrome"--which affects quality. Early diagnosis and cool, dry
storage are the answers.</TE>

<HD>'The Fire and the Rain' Is Bollywood for the Rest of Us</HD>
<DH>Sophisticated direction elevates a Hindi genre film with
timeless themes and plenty of spectacle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arjun Sajnani's "The Fire and the Rain" ("Agnivarsha") is an epic of
power, love, lust and sacrifice adapted from a play by Girish Karnad
and derived from "The Myth of Yavakri," which is part of the ancient
"Mahabharata" cycle. Like the recent "Lagaan," this is a splendid
example of contemporary Bollywood in which a director's sophisticated
style and vision have been brought to bear on the beloved conventions
of popular Hindi cinema. It's as if a DeMille spectacle has been
staged from a present-day perspective.</LD>
<LD>   Rich in elements universal in their associations and implications,
the film's star-crossed family evokes the House of Atreus. As in
"Hamlet," its climactic sequence involves a troupe of traveling
players staging a play that confronts the villain with his perfidy.
It has intricate plotting and the overheated emotions of silent
movies, with literate English subtitles that read like silents'
intertitles--e.g., "The sight of my luscious daughter-in-law is
enough to keep me in good shape!"</LD>
<LD>   "The Fire and the Rain" may be lurid and campy at times (part of
the fun) but also manages to be powerfully moving, exploring such
timeless themes as the conflict between love and duty, the
subordination of women, the evils of superstition, the folly of
revenge and the curse of India's caste system.</LD>
<TE>   In an ambitious, triumphant directorial debut, Sajnani proves to
be a born screen storyteller. He makes dramatic use of the majestic
ruins of Hampi, the capital city of the 13th century Vijaynagar
Empire, and deftly but sparingly integrates music and dance sequences
into the plot.</TE>
<TE>   With elegant production design and costumes, stunning
cinematography and a stirring score, the film has much excitement and
visual splendor--it was shot by Anil Mehta, Oscar-nominated for
"Lagaan"--and, best of all, proceeds at a rapid pace. "The Fire and
the Rain's" strong cinematic quality stands in sharp contrast to the
old-style, technically crude Bollywood blockbuster, which ran on
interminably and continually came to a grinding halt for those
obligatory production numbers.</TE>
<TE>   When the story opens, somewhere in India, sometime in the distant
past, the land is in its 10th year of drought. Its ruler has
apparently passed over great sage Raibhya (Mohan Agashe) to appoint
his son Paravasu (Jackie Shroff) chief priest, citing the father's
age, for the priest must forsake his family and all worldly pursuits
to conduct periodic ritual human sacrifices by fire to appease the
gods and thereby bring rain. The appointment dovetails with the
overweening ambitiousness of Paravasu, who has now left his beautiful
wife Vishakha (Raveena Tandon) abandoned for seven years with no
rainfall in sight.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Paravasu's naive younger brother Aravasu (Milind Soman)
is about to defy his Brahmin caste and marry a tribal beauty named

<TE>   At just this moment, Paravasu's first cousin and archrival,
Yavakri (Nagarjuna Prabhudeva), has returned from a 10-year
meditation, which has brought him eternal knowledge, bestowed upon
him by Lord Indra (Amitabh Bachchan, the revered veteran star). But
the spiritual sojourn hasn't calmed Yavakri one bit, and he's out to
topple Paravasu from his seat of power.</TE>
<TE>   The sweet and innocent young lovers Aravasu and Nittilai get
caught in the middle of the escalating conflict and emerge as the
saga's central characters. Tremendous demands are placed on all the
principal actors in that they must play at a sustained fever pitch;
Soman and Kulkarni in particular must show Aravasu and Nittilai
moving from innocence to embracing the highest demands of love and
sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fire and the Rain" is the first in a series of films to be
released in the U.S. under the umbrella title of "Beyond Bollywood"
by Cinebella Entertainment, recently formed to distribute quality
Indian and South Asian cinema. "The Fire and the Rain" is ripe for a
crossover from ethnic neighborhood theaters to art cinemas.</TE>

<HD>Passion in Paris</HD>
<DH>Bernardo Bertolucci, whose 'Last Tango' raised eyebrows 30
years ago, is back, filming the spicy 'The Dreamers'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GRITTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PARIS--After 30 years, Bernardo Bertolucci is filming here again. The
last time, the film he made created an international scandal. "Last
Tango in Paris," starring Marlon Brando as a grieving, middle-aged
man who meets a woman (Maria Schneider) in an empty apartment for
bouts of anonymous, joyless sex, was a film of such astonishing
sexual candor that it was condemned in the courts of Bertolucci's
native Italy as "obscene, indecent and catering to the lowest
instincts of the libido." He was tried for blasphemy (receiving a
suspended sentence) and his right to vote was withdrawn for five
years.</LD>
<LD>   In terms of controversy, it's a hard act to follow, but
Bertolucci's new film, "The Dreamers," may yet emulate it. It is set
in 1968, the year of "les evenements," when street protests and
strikes by workers and left-wing students briefly but memorably
overturned the peaceful natural order of life in Paris and much of
the rest of France. "This film has erotic content," Bertolucci says.
"It's a part of the revolution of that era--being transgressive, and
not in just the political sense." But this time, apparently, it takes
three to tango.</LD>
<TE>   Much of "The Dreamers" is also set in an empty Paris apartment
belonging to the parents of incestuous teenage twins. The siblings
Theo and Isabelle (Louis Garrel and Eva Green) meet up with Matthew
(Michael Pitt from "Murder by Numbers"), a sheltered young American
studying in Paris. All three are ardent film buffs, and when the
twins' parents go on holiday, Matthew moves in, and the trio start
playing mind games based on film trivia. These develop into
psychological role-play, involving sexual forfeits.</TE>
<TE>   "I had the idea of making a movie about Paris in 1968," Bertolucci
says. "But I wasn't interested in historical reconstruction. What
really intrigued me about that time were the young people, who were
animated by enthusiasm, excitement and fantastic hope. It seemed then
as if all young people felt it. Today, nobody has it. Ambitions today
are much less noble and interesting."</TE>
<TE>   As it happened, the right book was waiting, ready for him to
adapt. "The Holy Innocents," by English author and ex-film critic
Gilbert Adair, had been published in 1988, and Bertolucci and his
longtime collaborator, British producer Jeremy Thomas, seized upon it
as suitable for transfer to the big screen.</TE>
<TE>   "Gilbert's novel was not about the barricades and riots, but the
magic meeting of three kids with the events of 1968 as a background,"
Bertolucci says. "Often, speaking to kids who are children of people
who were involved in those events, they know nothing. I think: 'How
is it possible? Your parents were there!' But they didn't say
anything to their children. I think they have the feeling 1968 was a
failure. It wasn't at all. Life, behavior and a way of relating to
each other socially went through incredible changes after 1968."</TE>
<TE>   He ponders all this, slumped in his air-conditioned trailer after
an exhausting day of shooting in 95-degree heat. At 62, Bertolucci is
one of world cinema's elder statesmen; he walks painfully and slowly,
having suffered a herniated disc two years ago. But he is still an
elegant man with riveting presence and charisma.</TE>
<TE>   The party line on set is that "The Dreamers" is not about those
social and political events of 34 years ago, but primarily a story of
a three-way relationship. Yet today's scene re-creates a key moment
in that fateful year in Paris, infamous among film buffs. It is
taking place outside the city's Cinematheque Francaise, where in the
1950s and 1960s young cineastes and New Wave filmmakers such as
Godard, Truffaut, Rivette and Chabrol attended screenings of films
with almost religious devotion. The government shut down the building
in the spring of 1968.</TE>
<TE>   French Culture Minister Andre Malraux had fired the Cinematheque's
co-founder and archivist Henri Langlois, but students, workers and
film buffs took to the streets to rally to Langlois' defense; police
had to be called in. International pressure grew, dozens of film
directors from across the world cabled their support for Langlois,
and some of them threatened to withhold their films from being
exhibited at the Cinematheque. Finally, the government caved in and
reinstated Langlois.</TE>
<TE>   "The Cinematheque was like a university, with Langlois showing all
those people movies," Bertolucci says. "Malraux's excuse was that
Langlois wasn't saving or conserving films properly. There was a
legend that he kept rare films at home in a bathtub and under the
beds. Certainly he was unorthodox. But his attitude was to show those
movies, not hide them."</TE>
<TE>   A few dozen extras and the three young lead actors cluster outside
the doors of the real Cinematheque, reenacting the 1968 incident.
They wear authentic period clothes--miniskirts, shirts with long,
pointed collars--but the hues are more drab than most people recall.</TE>
<TE>   For Adair, who is present on set, the scene is a re-creation of
his own past. He was a Cinematheque habitue at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "We were called 'les rats' [the rats], those of us who used to
frequent it," he recalls. "I was here at the Cinematheque, I
participated in these demonstrations, and two months later, in May
1968, in the massive general strike. For me it's not nostalgic, it's
a film about three kinds of utopia--social, sexual, cinematic. What
we're trying to capture here is that idealism. I lived incredibly
intensely back then. I was a Maoist, for about three weeks. For a
moment, I swear, I thought the world was going to change."</TE>
<TE>   "The Holy Innocents" seems unlikely source material, weighed down
by Adair's florid prose and heavy-handed movie-buff references. In
fairness to him, he now feels embarrassed by it and will not even
utter its title: "I was unhappy with it for many reasons," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But having written the script of "The Dreamers" (with strong input
from Bertolucci), Adair is now rewriting "The Holy Innocents." The
new version of his book, also to be called "The Dreamers," will be
published when the film is released next year. "It's a rare case, a
novelist who's writing his own novelization," Adair says. "The new
book won't be exactly like the film, but closer to it."</TE>
<TE>   One thing certain about the new film is that it will be less
extravagant than Bertolucci's splashy, high-budget epics "The Last
Emperor" (1987), "The Sheltering Sky" (1990) and "Little Buddha"
(1993). The tenacious Jeremy Thomas raised the considerable finances
for these films, shot in exotic, remote locations (mainland China,
North Africa and Bhutan), without a penny from Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   For "The Dreamers," Thomas found backers from Italy, Spain and
Japan, as well as Fox Searchlight, the low-budget division of Fox
Filmed Entertainment. It is budgeted at just under $15 million,
modest by Bertolucci's standards. "But it gives Bernardo everything
he wants," Thomas says. "He has 10 weeks to shoot, cranes, a
top-level crew and three relatively new actors. Independent financing
is never easy, but it wasn't too hard raising the money with this. A
lot of people still want to be involved with Bertolucci films."</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to see why. Although his more recent films have been
somewhat disappointing, his is one of the most distinguished bodies
of work of any director in the last 40 years. And despite his
physical pain, he has not lost his taste for filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   "We closed the Pont d'Iena to traffic first thing this morning to
shoot a scene," Bertolucci says of the bridge over the Seine River,
with a wry twinkle. "People here assume I must be making an epic. But
a lot of this film is a chamber piece--it's three characters in an
apartment."</TE>
<TE>   For Bertolucci, it is more. "The Dreamers" marks a return to the
country that originally inspired him as a filmmaker, and it revisits
an era in which he too was a committed leftist. "Paris was the city
of cinema in the '60s and '70s for me," he says. "Back then, I had
the feeling I was really a French director. I was in love with the
nouvelle vague and its filmmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "I made my first film at the age of 21, and did my first interview
about it with an Italian journalist. I insisted on speaking French,
and when he asked why, I told him 'because French is the language of
cinema.' " He chuckles at the memory: "My love for cinema was so
violent, I was in a state of obsession. I loved [Godard's] "A Bout de
Souffle" and the films of Truffaut and Renoir."</TE>
<TE>   Although he was fascinated by the events of 1968 Paris, Bertolucci
was elsewhere: "I was shooting my film 'Partner' in Rome, but every
weekend the actor Pierre Clementi flew to Paris and came back with
all the news and new slogans. It was like having an umbilical cord to
what was happening here."</TE>
<TE>   He had sympathy for the workers and students who took to the
streets of Paris but had philosophical differences. "In 1968 the
students reached a position which I had reached years before, when I
made 'Before the Revolution' [1964]. It opened here in Paris, and was
a great success in the Latin Quarter and among young people, because
it was a movie about what they were talking about.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, in 1968, I found those positions of extremism
interesting but wrong. I had joined the Italian Communist Party, but
in 1968 filmmakers like Godard and Marco Bellocchio were pro-Chinese
or Marxist-Leninist. They considered me reformist.</TE>
<TE>   "You remember those subtle differences. I had an admiration for
the show of the Cultural Revolution. But I didn't like that millions
of people were shouting the same slogans. I liked that they had a
book, not a gun. But it was the same book. I was suspicious about
that unique voice."</TE>
<TE>   Bertolucci insists "The Dreamers" will be very different from
"Last Tango in Paris." "That was about devastating despair and
infinite loneliness. It was very tragic. This is much lighter."</TE>
<TE>   He hopes "The Dreamers" will strike a chord with young audiences,
especially the No Logo crowd, skeptical about consumerism and
globalization.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be interesting to see how kids of today relate to these
three characters from 35 years ago--and how they view the life and
the freedoms they enjoy today with the passion these children felt
then."</TE>

<HD>Chick Corea Rides to the Season's Rescue</HD>
<DH>As the Bowl's humdrum summer ends, he brings together
world-class artists and delivers an unusually memorable night.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It hasn't exactly been a smashing season for jazz at the Hollywood
Bowl this summer. More than half of the scheduled events could only
marginally have been described as jazz programs.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, the best was saved for last. Wednesday night's
concert, "Chick Corea and Friends," was a fine example of the sort of
jazz presentation that should have filled this year's schedule. (On a
hopeful note, it offered singer Dianne Reeves, the new creative chair
for jazz of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, with a distinct model for
the sort of jazz programming that the Bowl so badly needs.)</LD>
<LD>   The theme of the show was basic and to the point: A great musical
artist (Corea) recapitulates some of the high points of his career
through restorations of key musical high points, performed by many of
the players who participated in the originals. In Corea's case, the
players were world-class artists in their own right. Any program that
includes saxophonists Michael Brecker and Eric Marienthal, bassists
Eddie Gomez and John Patitucci, vibist Gary Burton, drummers Steve
Gadd, Dave Weckl and Airto Moreira, and singer Flora Purim has to be
considered a special event.</LD>
<TE>   Enhancing the evening, Corea was in rare form, musically and
personally. Obviously enjoying every moment, he balanced his
consistently superb playing with gregarious comments between numbers,
transforming the Bowl's huge stage into a kind of living-room
performance for a large crowd of friends.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the segments touched on a particular aspect of Corea's
skills. The opening duo set with Burton was a marvelous excursion,
blending craft, imagination and intellectualism. The intimate musical
connections between the pair were startlingly symbiotic, given the
fact that they haven't played together consistently for years. But
their combined sense of invention, in numbers such as "Crystal
Silence" and "Senor Mouse," was resolute, the impressive product of
two mature masters at work.</TE>
<TE>   The high point of the evening, however, was the second segment, in
which Corea was joined by Brecker, Gomez and Gadd. Impressive
throughout the set, they peaked on Corea's "Sicily," which showcased
a brilliant drum solo by Gadd--a player whose sensitive musicality
has consistently served as a role model for good drumming.</TE>
<TE>   Brecker added another star to a series of fine recent performances
in the Southland, fully shaking off his Coltrane references, firmly
establishing himself as one of the important saxophonists of his
generation.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the set was concluded--to rousing audience cheers--it
was obvious that this particular quartet is one that Corea should
seriously consider reassembling for a tour of its own.</TE>
<TE>   The third and fourth segments featuring Corea's Elektric Band and
a kind of revived Return to Forever offered plenty of sound and fury,
but not quite as much sheer musicality as the opening half of the
bill. Among the high points: the way Corea extracted blues-drenched
passages from a shoulder-slung electronic keyboard; and Moreira's
stirring solo number using only his voice and a pandero (Brazilian
tambourine).</TE>
<TE>   By the time the show wrapped with an all-join-in rendering of
"Spain," the only missing elements were a glance at Corea's talented
classical abilities and a taste of his insightful work with standard
songs. But that would have taken at least one more evening. Maybe
next time.</TE>

<LD>In interviews and in its music, Radiohead tosses around references to
20th century classical titans Messiaen and Penderecki. So why
shouldn't classical musicians toss around a little Radiohead?</LD>
<LD>   That's just what the Section, a Los Angeles string quartet, did at
Largo on Wednesday, adding music originated by Led Zeppelin, Bruce
Springsteen, the Cure, Incubus and Nine Inch Nails, among others.</LD>
<LD>   Classical-style interpretations of rock music have been around at
least since Joshua Rifkin's 1966 "Baroque Beatles" album, but the
Section is making a cottage industry of it with a growing series of
tribute albums--a dozen so far.</LD>
<TE>   Giving their first headlining concert Wednesday,
arranger-violinist Eric Gorfain, second violinist Daphne Chen,
violist Leah Katz and cellist Richard Dodd treated an attentive
audience to selections from its albums, with guest vocal appearances
by Jon Brion, Sheila Nicholls and Grant-Lee Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   They smartly sidestepped the tributees' most obvious songs, and
Gorfain's arrangements proved entertainingly spirited and
accomplished--although stripped of their words and voices, such tunes
as Springsteen's "The River" lost steam after the first verse and
chorus. It was the vocal numbers, particularly Phillips soaring on
David Bowie's "Ashes to Ashes," that were the evening's highlights.</TE>
<TE>   But frankly, with comedian Paul F. Tompkins' dramatic reading of
Radiohead's "Fitter Happier" helping set the tone, these classicists
seemed a lot less pretentious than the rock stars they honored.</TE>

<LD>The stock market was diving, baseball was on a doomsday watch,

out Nikki, Justin or Kelly from Fox's blockbuster summer series,

expected huge audience will tune in if only to learn if Justin's
expanding hair continues to fit inside Hollywood's Kodak Theatre.
Yes, get ready for a "High Noon" of high Cs, a no-notes-barred

These kids dispatched glossy Nikki McKibbin by again warbling their
hearts out for America, for celebrity commentators Paula Abdul, Randy
Jackson and Simon Cowell and for host Ryan Seacrest and his sleepy
marionette, Brian Dunkleman.</TE>
<TE>   As for Ryan and Brian, it's fairly clear that Seacrest's role here
is to be odious and overbearing, and that Dunkleman's is to somehow
remain awake while his co-host does the talking.</TE>
<TE>   Although Fox's amnesiacs promote "American Idol: Search for a
Superstar" as a fresh concept, its roots go back nearly 70 years to
radio's "Major Bowes Amateur Hour," whose subsequent TV version ran
for years with Ted Mack as emcee and begat a spoof titled "The Gong
Show," and the more recent "Star Search" and the even newer "Making
the Band" and "Popstars."</TE>
<TE>   "American Idol" opened June 11 with 100 contestants who had been
culled from the multitudes in nationwide auditions. That group was
pared weekly in Tuesday-Wednesday installments of the show. Viewers
vote after each Tuesday episode, then hear the results near the end
of the Wednesday episode.</TE>
<TE>   Next week's winner gets a major recording contract. Fox is already
a winner, the big ratings promising an "American Idol II" at the very
least.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a nervous wreck over all of this. Now, Nikki was sexy, and I
swear I could see my reflection in her lips.</TE>
<TE>   But I knew she had no chance this week when my cockatiels began
chirping angrily as soon as she opened her mouth. Or ... was that her
chirping?</TE>
<TE>   If Kelly and her big voice don't trump Justin and his Michael
Jackson cuteness next week, America's talent scouts will have no
credibility at all. Of course, anything can happen here, for many of
us were shocked, yes shocked, when Tamyra Gray was voted off the show
the previous Wednesday instead of Nikki.</TE>
<TE>   After all, this is not any old idol were picking here. It's our
idol. The good old U.S. of A.'s idol. America's global reputation is
at stake. If Nikki had won, what would they have thought of us in Sri
Lanka?</TE>
<TE>   That's why I called to register support of Justin and Kelly on
Tuesday night, only to be disqualified when I also voted for smarmy,
dolled-up Ryan Seacrest to have a close-up meeting (you know what
kind) with Tony Soprano.</TE>
<TE>   What is it with this guy? He eyes the camera as if it's a mirror,
and my own hair got moussed just from watching his.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody got chills?" oozed Mr. Sincerity after Kelly's
performance. Anybody got a cream pie to push into Seacrest's face?</TE>
<TE>   In fact, sincerity is this show's signature. Yup, absolutely. On
Wednesday, I especially loved the part when:</TE>
<TE>   * Justin, Kelly and Nikki held hands while waiting to hear which
of them was voted off.</TE>
<TE>   * Justin and Kelly wrapped their arms around Nikki when she was
announced as the tossee. They felt that bad for her. Oh, yeah.</TE>
<TE>   * A tearful Nikki received parting words from the judges. "This is
not a time for tears," said Cowell, a British recording executive who
got famous as a judge on "Pop Idol," the U.K. show that inspired this
one. Earlier he had trashed her, in effect.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Wednesday's "American Idol" didn't end when the show
ended. Slicing into a near-monolith of crime stories, Fox-owned KTTV
was hot on the trail of this fast-breaking news in its 10 p.m.
newscast, dispatching weathercaster Mark Thompson to a gathering of
"American Idol" loyalists at the home of one of his Beverly Hills
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Did anybody have chills? Don't ask.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to this pair of in-depth live reports from Thompson,
KTTV located a psychologist willing to play the fool and analyze
Cowell's body language and inform us how the show's contestants were
handling fame and fortune.</TE>
<TE>   Out spooled her tickertape of wisdom: "These kids are under
tremendous pressure." Yet somehow they keep singing and singing in a
quest to become our national idol.</TE>
<TE>   It makes you proud to be an American.</TE>

<HD>Channeling the Spirit of Antonio Carlos Jobim</HD>
<DH>It's almost as if the late bossa nova great had a hand in
the teaming of Jacques Morelenbaum and Ryuichi Sakamoto.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you've heard any Brazilian music in the past few years, it's a
fair bet that you've experienced the work of Jacques Morelenbaum, as
either a cellist, an arranger-orchestrator or a producer.</LD>
<LD>   A minimal list of the artists he's assisted includes Marisa Monte,
Cesaria Evora, Chico Buarque, Carlinhos Brown, Gal Costa, Simone and
Joao Bosco. He has, in addition, participated in Grammy-winning
albums by Caetano Veloso and Antonio Carlos Jobim.</LD>
<LD>   Morelenbaum's association with Veloso and Jobim is particularly
prominent. In recent years, he has collaborated with Veloso on
numerous projects, including the Fellini film music renderings on
"Omaggio a Federico e Giulietta"; the lovely Latin American classic
songs of the "Fina Estampa" album; and the blend of Bahian rhythms
and jazz horns in "Livro."</LD>
<TE>   In each case, Morelenbaum's cello playing and arrangements played
vital roles in the success of the music.</TE>
<TE>   But he had an even longer association with Jobim, dating back
decades. The vital, creative warmth of that relationship is intrinsic
to the group he leads with Japanese pianist Ryuichi Sakamoto,
Morelenbaum2/Sakamoto. (Morelenbaum2 refers to the added presence of
the cellist's wife, singer Paula Morelenbaum.)</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 7, during a Southland weekend that will resonate with
Brazilian music, the ensemble presents "The Music of Antonio Carlos
Jobim" at the Knitting Factory Hollywood in support of the
just-released CD "Casa." (Also performing that weekend will be the
edgy young Brazilian ensemble Zuco 103 at the Conga Room on Sept. 6,
and "The Beat of Brazil" with Ivan Lins, Monica Salmaso and others at
the Hollywood Bowl on Sept. 8.)</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, Morelenbaum, 48, didn't really discover Jobim or
bossa nova until he was in his late teens.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was young, I was attached to classical music and to rock,"
he recalls. "I actually knew very little about Brazilian music. At
that time, I was mostly interested in groups like Cream, Deep Purple
and Jethro Tull, and I didn't begin to pay attention to Brazilian
music until I was around 17--first to the guys who made a connection
between Brazilian music and rock, and then, through Tropicalismo, to
bossa nova."</TE>
<TE>   After that discovery, it became a fundamental aspect of
Morelenbaum's musical view, enhanced by his far-reaching relationship
with Jobim. In 1995, a year after the death of the great bossa nova
composer, Morelenbaum was invited to perform at a celebratory jazz
festival in Rio.</TE>
<TE>   "I was supposed to have two Brazilian guests and one international
guest," he says. "So I invited Ryuichi, because I already knew about
his great passion for Jobim's work. I also asked Jobim's widow, Ana,
if I could take Ryuichi to visit their house. It was a very familiar
place to me since, for 10 years, I was there almost every night
playing with Jobim.</TE>
<TE>   "But Ryuichi looked as though he was entering a Buddhist temple.
He was afraid, at first, to even touch Jobim's piano. Finally, and
only when Ana insisted, did he play a few notes. And as it turned
out, that was a big moment for me too, because the gap in my life
when Jobim passed away was very dark and very deep. And then, for the
first time, I was hearing the sound of his piano being played in that
room that I knew so well."</TE>
<TE>   The impact of that experience remained with Morelenbaum and
Sakamoto for years, throughout their frequent musical collaborations.
But it remained for Paula Morelenbaum, a few years later, to come up
with the idea that transformed it into the recording of "Casa" and
the current tour.</TE>
<TE>   "We were doing a series of trio concerts in Europe," recalls
Morelenbaum, "when Paula said, 'Why don't we do an album, the three
of us, of Tom Jobim's songs, and do it at his house?' Well, Ryuichi
just jumped out of his chair and said, 'OK, let's do it!' "</TE>
<TE>   Morelenbaum discussed the project with Ana Jobim, who agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "And so," he says, "after six years I could finally play again in
that room, I could listen again to the piano sounding together with
my cello and Paula's voice. We tend to associate music with different
feelings we have. I tend to associate it a lot with visual aspects
even though I mostly play with my eyes closed.</TE>
<TE>   "So playing Jobim's music, looking through the same window in that
special place--just beside the Rio de Janeiro forest, where you can
see the ocean and you can see a big lake--it was a very special
experience."</TE>
<TE>   Given that Jobim's home was not an acoustically soundproofed
studio, it was an experience with some potential recording problems.
But even here, the project took on special qualities.</TE>
<TE>   "It was summertime and it was very hot," Morelenbaum says. "But we
couldn't use the air-conditioning because of the recording, so we had
the windows open. And--this was Ryuichi's concept--we decided that it
was all right, that it was appropriate for the music to also include
all the surrounding sounds of nature."</TE>
<TE>   Morelenbaum2/Sakamoto and "Casa" arrive at a time when bossa nova
seems to be experiencing a revival. Morelenbaum declines, however, to
view the music in the context of trends or fashions.</TE>
<TE>   "I really think of it as a kind of classical music," he says. "It
has been more than 40 years since the beginning, and the best bossa
nova has always been with us.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't exactly happening in Brazil, it was here in the
States, or it was in Europe, or in the Orient, and most of the time
in all those places. Nowadays we have this New Bossa calling the
attention of people to the original bossa nova, and DJs are using
bossa nova samples in their experiments."</TE>
<TE>   But he also insists on the continued importance of his late friend
and musical compatriot Jobim, whom he views as one of the musical
fountainheads of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still many young composers writing new bossa novas in
Brazil, and that's good," Morelenbaum says. "But Tom Jobim was a very
special guy, a very special composer. He was so enlightened and so
brilliant that we will always have to pay attention to what his music
was saying."</TE>
<TE>   Morelenbaum2/Sakamoto present "The Music of Antonio Carlos Jobim"
at the Knitting Factory Hollywood on Sept. 7 at 7:30 p.m. (dinner
show) and 10:30 p.m. $35, general admission; $60, dinner ticket. 7021
Hollywood Blvd. (323) 463-0204.</TE>
<TE>   Riffs: The new Sierra Nights Series at the Cerritos Center for the
Performing Arts begins Wednesday with a performance by tenor
saxophonist Seamus Blake, who placed first in the 2002 Thelonious
Monk Jazz Competition.... Pianist Oscar Peterson will receive the
President's Award at the International Assn. for Jazz Education's
annual conference in January. The four-day event, which will be
attended by more than 7,000, takes place in Toronto, the first time
it has been held outside the United States in its 30 years....</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't want to make too much of this, but is there something
about saxophonists and the Virgo astrological sign?</TE>
<TE>   Consider the birth dates in the current two-week period: Wayne
Shorter, Aug. 25; Branford Marsalis, Aug. 26; Lester Young, Aug. 27;
Charlie Parker and Bennie Maupin, Aug. 29; John Surman and Gerald
Albright, Aug. 30; Paul Winter, Aug. 31; Art Pepper, Sept. 1;
Clifford Jordan, Sept. 2; Ernie Henry, Sept. 3; David Liebman, Sept.
4; and Sonny Rollins and Ken McIntyre, Sept. 7. Hmmm.</TE>

<HD>On the Road, Seeking American Values</HD>
<DH>Begun before 9/11, Peter Jennings' project took on new
meaning *</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>More than a year before the Sept. 11 terror attacks, ABC News anchor
Peter Jennings went "In Search of America," his latest TV and book
collaboration with Todd Brewster.</LD>
<LD>   As a follow-up to their "The Century" project of 1999, the two had
settled on "reviewing basic American values as set out by the
Founding Fathers," examining their relevance today, said Jennings, an
immigrant Canadian.</LD>
<LD>   But it was the project that gained added relevance in the wake of
the attacks, and the ensuing months of American debate over issues
such as patriotism, civil liberties, racism and the limits of
religious tolerance.</LD>
<TE>   The six-part series runs for five nights beginning Tuesday at 10
p.m., with the final two episodes airing Saturday night. Tuesday is
also the publication date of the companion book put out by Hyperion,
which, like ABC, is a unit of Walt Disney Co.</TE>
<TE>   Books by the Big Three network anchors have become big business in
recent years, ever since NBC's Tom Brokaw touched a chord with
readers with his "Greatest Generation" volumes chronicling untold
American World War II stories. But this project lands at a time when
the airwaves are already starting to be saturated with programming
reflecting on America in the year since the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Jennings insisted that "In Search of America" is "not a 9/11
project," adding that "we felt very strongly that the project should
not be changed" in the wake of Sept. 11. But neither could the
implications be ignored. Producers returned to some subjects for
updating.</TE>
<TE>   Jennings' team winnowed the broad topic to six themes, explored
through current-day stories. There's a look at the debate over the
teaching of evolution in Aiken, S.C., and an examination of
patriotism seen through the eyes of the high school actors in a
Boulder, Colo.-production of "Hair," a musical about rebellion
against authority. The Midwest is represented not through a
stereotypical look at rural farmers, but by a story on Gary, Ind.'s
legacy of African American governance. The controversial
reintroduction of gray wolves in Idaho provides an opening to examine
the debate over centralized government versus individual rights.</TE>
<TE>   Just reporting the project had its complications after Sept. 11,
when ABC News management insisted that Jennings not travel anyplace
he couldn't immediately return from by car. Eventually he was able to
get out, and the countrywide reporting also helped inform his
perspective on the national mood for his job as anchor of "World News
Tonight." Going to California, he said, made it clear that, unlike in
New York, "our preoccupation with ground zero and the Pentagon was
not theirs."</TE>
<TE>   On a trip to Texas, Jennings laughingly recounted how he asked
someone in line for a Dallas Cowboys game if he had any gripes about
the country, and the man replied, "Only you."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, his ABC bosses disagree. After a summer of contract
negotiations, Jennings, 64, is nearing completion of a new pact to
remain ABC's lead anchor for several more years. He declined to
discuss details.</TE>

<HD>Nielsen Quirk Gives HBO a Ratings Boost</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While hardly the stuff of butterfly ballots and hanging chads, a
quirk in Nielsen Media Research's measuring system has apparently
been inflating audience estimates for such hit Home Box Office
programs as "The Sopranos" and "Sex and the City."</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the research firm confirmed that reported ratings
for HBO shows combine all viewing of the pay service's various
channels at that particular time, as opposed to being show-specific.
As a result, audience estimates for "Sex and the City" on Sunday at 9
p.m., for example, would also include people watching something else
on HBO Plus, HBO Signature and HBO Family at the same time.</LD>
<LD>   "We do aggregate it," said Nielsen spokesman Jack Loftus. "All the
viewing minutes to those different [channels] goes into that rating."</LD>
<TE>   It's a good bet, of course, that the vast majority of viewers are
watching "Sopranos" or "Sex" on the flagship network (HBO has
actually run the former on two channels simultaneously, offering
conventional and letterbox versions), but because of the manner in
which Nielsen measures HBO, at this point there's no clear way to
tell.</TE>
<TE>   Because HBO is a pay service and doesn't sell advertising, the
discrepancy isn't terribly significant, beyond whatever cultural
curiosity exists as to how many people are watching its series.
Loftus noted that Nielsen is working on technology that would encode
each individual program and enable the service to provide a distinct
rating for every show.</TE>
<TE>   The news even took some HBO officials by surprise, although a
representative said the combined viewing number is the only one
currently available to the pay services, including HBO's rival,
Showtime. Anyway, HBO has long emphasized its cumulative audience for
programs such as "The Sopranos"--totaling how many people watch over
a week, as opposed to focusing on the initial telecast, since each
HBO series plays multiple times on different nights.</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen ranked Sunday's showing of "Sex and the City" as the
week's most-watched cable program, averaging roughly 7.4 million
viewers--a figure that will apparently have to be reported with an
asterisk until further notice.</TE>

<HD>Probing Our Fear of Aging</HD>
<DH>In 'Looking Younger, Living Longer,' ABC reports on
Americans' obsession with youthful appearance, but it is little more
than skin deep.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MALTAIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some say age is merely a number. Of course, it's that number that
millions of Americans are trying desperately to manipulate.</LD>
<LD>   Whether it's injecting botulism, slathering on cream made from
babies' foreskin or eating a severely restricted diet, the youth
obsession in this country is becoming more pervasive.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, ABC's Dr. Nancy Snyderman explores the ways in which many
Americans have declared war on the aging process as we've come to
know it in "Looking Younger, Living Longer: What Every Woman Wants to
Know."</LD>
<TE>   According to her report, more than 8.5 million Americans underwent
a cosmetic procedure in the last year to the tune of more than $8
billion. In 2001, cosmetic procedures reportedly rose by 48%. As one
expert puts it, rather than trying to lose those last 10 pounds, many
people are focusing on losing those last 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   And the message is getting to the masses earlier, with ads for
creams claiming to fade lines and smooth out cellulite all over
magazines that appeal to twentysomethings.</TE>
<TE>   However, one small wrinkle: The very women who help deliver the
public these celebrated images of youth find themselves left behind
as they age. In the program, Cybill Shepherd and Lauren Hutton
discuss Hollywood's Botox-immobilized raised eyebrow on aging.
Actress and former model Shepherd, now 52, reminisces that she was
told, early in her career, that 25 is over the hill in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   But this issue is traveling beyond the cameras and soft lighting
to the workplace, Snyderman says. To buy a little more time and, for
some, to get a better job, some women are willing to alter their
appearance. A laser procedure at lunch, an eyelift on vacation.</TE>
<TE>   And some companies are going beyond the
it's-better-to-look-good-than-to-feel-good approach to examine ways
to help us live longer too.</TE>
<TE>   However, like some of the procedures it highlights, the program
doesn't go much beyond the surface. Snyderman doesn't spend a lot of
time on what's behind the American obsession with looking and
remaining young. And the dearth of minorities in the program
implicitly suggests that this is an obsession of white women, not
every woman, as the title professes.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the actual price tag, there is little discussion about at
what cost people are attempting to extend their lives.</TE>
<TE>   The program does touch on some of the social ramifications of
living longer. More questions than answers arise: If Americans live
longer, will they work longer, and if so, how does that affect the
younger generations when they prepare to enter the work force?</TE>
<TE>   With all the effort and cost people are putting into looking as
young as they feel, working into their 90s might well become a
necessary evil.</TE>

<HD>Maybe It Should Be Titled 'chuckledotcom'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the great guilty pleasures of moviegoing is watching a film
you expect to be bad turn out to be spectacularly bad. A horror movie
that puts its own special spin on the word "howler," "feardotcom"
opens with a cameo from Udo Kier, a character actor whose presence
usually portends either something pretty good (as when he's in a Lars
von Trier film) or something pretty awful (take your pick, "Barb
Wire" or "The Adventures of Pinocchio").</LD>
<LD>   Clutching a book to his body and rolling his bloodshot eyes, Kier
stumbles across a soundstage that's desperately trying to pass itself
off as a New York City subway platform and desperately failing. It
doesn't look good, in any sense of the term, and it looks much worse
once a little girl materializes on the scene wearing a smear of black
lipstick and a peroxide blond wig left over from the British shocker
"Village of the Damned." Rolling his eyes as wildly as a drunk rolls
dice, Kier flings himself into the path of a train, a putatively
irrational act that seems all too sensible the further this gibberish
unfolds.</LD>
<TE>   Kier's character and the diminutive she-devil have something to do
with a phantom that's haunting the Internet and a serial killer named
"the Doctor" (Stephen Rea), who videotapes his grisly crimes, then
puts the footage on the Web. A detective named Mike (Stephen Dorff)
has been hunting the Doctor for some time but hasn't been able to
catch a break. When victims with bleeding eyeballs begin to litter
the city streets, however, prompting the intervention of a department
of health inspector named Terry (Natascha McElhone), the cold case
begins to warm.</TE>
<TE>   All too slowly, Mike and Terry discover that the ghost in the
machine draws Web surfers into a site called feardotcom where they,
and we, can watch the bad doctor slowly torture women to death with
an assortment of glinting needles and scalpels. The surfers get
bloody eyes for their trouble and we get this movie, which oscillates
between ineptitude and incoherence, and inspires more mirth than
fright.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest or at least most obvious culprit in this regard is
Josephine Coyle's script, which has its genesis in a story by the
film's producer Moshe Diamant, which may explain why this project got
made at all. The story leapfrogs abruptly from scene to scene, and it
makes such a mockery of narrative logic and continuity that the cast
tends to look either baffled (Dorff) or as if they're trying to
remain unrecognized (Rea, a very long way from "The Crying Game").</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because he read the script--and was trying to make
Luxembourg and Montreal pass for New York--director William Malone
opts to light the film so darkly that it can be hard to make out
everything in the frame. This is a good thing. Malone has made an
obvious study of old Nine Inch Nails videos and someone involved with
"feardotcom" has grabbed onto the shell of Clive Barker's and David
Cronenberg's work, but no one here has figured out that the shiny
surface of fear isn't the same thing as its depth. Then again, while
such artlessness doesn't inspire shivers, it's definitely worth a few
cheap laughs.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for violence, including grisly images of torture,
nudity and language. Times guidelines: scenes of sexualized violence
against women and intimations of fetishism.</TE>

<HD>It Takes a (Reformed) Tough Guy to Play One</HD>
<DH>Movies * From crime to prison to drug counseling. That's
the troubled path that 'Spy Kids 2' and 'XXX' actor Danny Trejo took
to Hollywood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER MOORE</AU>
<BD>ORLANDO SENTINEL</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I'm typecast, sure," says Danny Trejo, the Mexican American ex-con
who became character actor, a star of "Spy Kids 2" and "XXX." "But
typecast character actors are the only ones who work in Hollywood,
man. People who gripe too much about it don't work."</LD>
<LD>   Trejo laughs. And his wide, friendly, scarred face breaks into a
huge toothy smile. "You go with what God gave you," he says. "Man, I
look like a bad guy. What can I say?"</LD>
<LD>   The second half of that statement is the gospel truth, but the
first half begs for a proviso.</LD>
<TE>   Trejo, a young 58, wasn't born looking bad. The scars, the
tattoos, came from a rough first 25 years--very rough. The guy has
been in movies for 17 years--"Runaway Train," "Desperado," "Heat,"
"From Dusk Till Dawn," "Spy Kids"--but Trejo has yet to be in a film
that's as interesting as his life.</TE>
<TE>   His shirt is open, revealing a huge tattoo of a beautiful woman,
with the names Debbie and Danielle tattooed above it.</TE>
<TE>   Peacock tattoos adorn each arm. This is genuine prison wear for
the OG, or original gangster, as Trejo puts it. Because that's what
he was.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in and out of prisons, all over California," he says of his
first 25 years. "Robbery, drugs, theft, you name it. Got out of San
Quentin for the last time in '69 and became a drug counselor."</TE>
<TE>   It was 16 years before his life entered a third act.</TE>
<TE>   "I was working for Western Pacific Rehab in '85, and I got a call
from a kid, a client, who was in the crew of this movie, 'Runaway
Train,' and was crying and about to use. 'Come down and hang out with
me, or I'll do something I shouldn't.' "</TE>
<TE>   Trejo dropped what he was doing and visited his client.</TE>
<TE>   "Never been on a movie set in my life. Turns out, another guy on
the set was a writer on the movie, and he'd been in the joint with me
in San Quentin or Soledad or Folsom, somewhere. And he asked me if I
wanted to be an extra.</TE>
<TE>   "The director asked me if I could act like a convict," Trejo says,
laughing. "I said, 'Sure.' I changed, and as I took off my shirt,
they saw the tattoos.</TE>
<TE>   "Then they told me that Eric Roberts had accidentally hurt a
couple of guys in his big fight scene, and nobody would do the scene
with him. I'd boxed in prison, and they asked me to train him and do
the scene with him. Offered me $320 a day.</TE>
<TE>   " 'He's a little high-strung, and he keeps hurting people,' they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "And I said, 'OK. For $320, how bad do you want this kid beat up?'
"</TE>
<TE>   Trejo laughs long and hard.</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'No, you can't. He's the star! He might sock you!' And
I said, 'For $320, you can give him a stick!' "</TE>
<TE>   This is a side of the screen bad man that we rarely see, a side
that director Robert Rodriguez, who'd used him in "Desperado" as a
villain, wanted to bring out.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to use him as a good guy in the 'Spy Kids' movies,
because you never expect that from him," Rodriguez says. "And after
having him in so many of my films, he's like my good luck charm.
Besides, he's my cousin."</TE>
<TE>   They discovered they were related on the set of "Desperado." Since
then, Trejo's been in most of Rodriguez's movies, including "Spy Kids
2" and the upcoming "Once Upon a Time in Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   "Robert says I remind him of the bad guys in his school, who were
really good guys at heart," Trejo says. "I like that idea, a bad guy
with some redeeming qualities."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez cast Trejo as Uncle Izzy Cortez, pal and gadget guru to
his nephew and niece, the "Spy Kids" of the films' titles. But Uncle
Izzy also has another name: Machete.</TE>
<TE>   "I love that character," Trejo says. "Machete is a rebel uncle in
the family, kind of mischievous. But you know that he has a past too.
It's probably not pleasant."</TE>
<TE>   He ticks off his favorite villains: "Navajas, the guy with the
knives, in 'Desperado.' That good-bad guy I played in 'Heat' was
great for me. People were cheering for the bad guys in that one."</TE>
<TE>   It was his past that director Rob Cohen was looking for when he
cast Trejo as El Jefe, a deadly, machete-wielding drug lord in the
spy thriller "XXX." "The part called for a guy that, the instant the
audience sees him, they laugh and go, 'Of course, he's the drug
lord,' " Cohen says. "That's what the characters are supposed to do
in the movie, too: 'Are you for real?' You look at him and go, 'OK,
he's Hollywood's idea of a drug lord, an El Jefe.' "</TE>
<TE>   "I love being in the middle of all this action," Trejo says of
"XXX." "And they gave me a really memorable character to play. Hey, I
saw this thing, and I got one of the biggest laughs!"</TE>
<TE>   One thing Trejo doesn't joke about is drug abuse. He's not kidding
when he says, "The other reputation I think I've gotten in Hollywood
is of this guy who's still a drug counselor, who goes, 'You're not
smoking that on the same set with me, are you? You're not using
drugs, are you?' I embarrass them."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, Robert Downey Jr. won't be sharing a lot of scenes
with Trejo.</TE>
<TE>   "Honest to God, I think his people are scared of me and won't let
me be cast in anything he's done," he says. Trejo keeps his drug
counseling skills sharp--"because, you know, there are people in the
movies who use drugs."</TE>
<TE>   But he's absolutely in love with his latest career. He is trying
to produce a film that he doesn't plan to direct or act in. And after
his years in prison yards and cells, he relishes every day he spends
on a set.</TE>
<TE>   "Love everything about the movies," he says. "I'd be a grip if
they weren't letting me act."</TE>

company.</TE>

<HD>Creating 'Real' Beverly Hillbillies</HD>
<DH>Television* CBS plans to move a rural family to a Westside
mansion and film the culture switch for a new unscripted series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA de MORAES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CBS is bringing back "The Beverly Hillbillies." This time, however,
the family members we laugh at won't be played by Hollywood actors;
they'll be real live rubes from the South.</LD>
<LD>   After spending decades trying to shed the Bubba image it
contracted in the 1960s when its prime-time lineup included a slew of
back-country characters, CBS has decided to embrace once again its
biggest hick hit of all. The network already has a crew of casting
agents combing "mountainous, rural areas" in Arkansas, West Virginia,
North Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky in search of a
"multi-generational family of five or more--parents, children and
grandparents--who will be relocated for at least a year" to a mansion
in Beverly Hills, said CBS spokesman Chris Ender.</LD>
<LD>   "That is not to say if we discover the perfect family from another
area of the country we wouldn't consider them," he added. "We're
looking for a family from a very rural area that hasn't been exposed
to big-city life or luxuries of life in any way."</LD>
<TE>   The family will be given money--exactly how much hasn't been
determined--with which to buy expensive cars and designer suits, hire
maids and personal assistants, and dine at hot Westside eateries.</TE>
<TE>   The head of "reality" programming for CBS, Ghen Maynard, told the
trade paper Variety, which broke word of the remake, that the network
is looking for a family that's very different but "relatable" and
whose members love one another.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the Osbournes.</TE>
<TE>   MTV's reality series about Ozzy Osbourne and his family, who also
live in Beverly Hills, became that network's most watched program
ever this past television season, generating as many as 8 million
viewers and sending network executives scrambling to develop more
series in which cameras are focused on wacky real-life people.</TE>
<TE>   "America tuned in to see Ozzy be a freak, but what happened is
everybody fell in love with him," said Dub Cornett, who's among those
developing CBS' "Beverly Hillbillies" unscripted remake.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy who ate a bat and was a spawn of Satan turns out to love
his kids and is a pretty nice guy. It ended out being 'Ozzie and
Harriet' more than anything else," said Cornett, a documentary
filmmaker from Appalachia, Va., who refers to himself as an
Appalachian American.</TE>
<TE>   "The Beverly Hillbillies" starred well-known character actor Buddy
Ebsen as Jed Clampett, patriarch of an Ozark family that struck it
rich when oil began bubbling up on their property.</TE>
<TE>   So he loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly.</TE>
<TE>   Hills, that is. Swimmin' pools. Movie stars!</TE>
<TE>   "The Beverly Hillbillies" had four immediate family members.
Besides slow-talking, sensible Jed, there were dumb, buxom,
critter-luvin' Elly May; cousin Jethro, who was also stupid but a
real hunk; and Daisy Mae Moses, a.k.a. Granny, whose mission in life
was finding Elly May a husband.</TE>
<TE>   When the sitcom debuted in 1962, it was an immediate hit--the most
watched program on TV its first two seasons, attracting as many as 60
million viewers each week.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, CBS put on a spinoff, "Petticoat Junction," then
added "Green Acres."</TE>
<TE>   All three were Top 20 programs when CBS dropped them in the early
'70s. That was about the time the Nielsen company started providing
the networks with information about viewer demographics. Turned out,
people who watched these shows were mostly rural, mostly older and
lacking much spending power.</TE>
<TE>   Of the new "Beverly Hillbillies," Ender said, "We believe this
will hit a sweet spot of young adults with its reality base," young
viewers being the audience advertisers most want to reach.</TE>
<TE>   "The Real Beverly Hillbillies" would be the latest incarnation in
a "reality" craze that seized the TV industry in the late '90s with
the success of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" and "Survivor."</TE>
<TE>   Cornett, whose credits include documentaries about moonshine and
hillbilly dancing, insists America will end up laughing at Beverly
Hills, not his Clampett family.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the real 'Beverly Hillbillies,' Jed was the one
guy you had any respect for, not the banker.</TE>
<TE>   "We will accomplish the most if we cast it well with people who
respect themselves but see the humor in themselves. We will end up
with a piece that truly has, God forbid, social commentary, and maybe
will enlighten, that it's not all barefoot hillbillies," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of America can only imagine what it's like to live in
Beverly Hills and live in a multimillion-dollar mansion. We can share
this advantage with them, rather than laugh at them." On the other
hand, he said, "If somebody is a stereotypical swing-from-the-trees
hillbilly who shoots the lights out and parks cars in the front
yard--hey, it happens. I live near that."</TE>
<TE>   CBS has not decided what to do with its new Clampetts once the
network is through with them.</TE>
<TE>   News of the "Beverly Hillbillies" redo did not sit well with some
Southerners who work in Hollywood, who did not wish to be identified
for this article.</TE>
<TE>   "They should check on Anna Nicole Smith," said one. "It's like
punching a wounded animal on that show. This is going to backfire,"
added the executive, who predicted the network may have trouble
getting some TV stations in Southern markets to air the program.</TE>
<TE>   But Ender said the new program is not intended to be a show about
stereotypes or prejudice. "It's fun. The concept is plain fun," he
said.</TE>

<TE>   Nonsense, Mason says.</TE>
<TE>   The manager of Zanies canceled the appearance, he contends, after
being inundated with calls from local Jews reacting to critical
statements Hanania had made about Israeli leader Ariel Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   In a video clip shown during Mason's appearance on CNN's
"Crossfire" Wednesday night, Hanania said, "This isn't about
Arab-Israeli politics, this is about me being Arab American, trying
to let Americans know that I'm normal. We're good people. And we can
be doctors, lawyers and stand-up comedians."</TE>

<TE>   Lions Gate Acquires 'House of 1000 Corpses'</TE>
<TE>   Rob Zombie's horror film "House of 1000 Corpses" has been picked
up by Lions Gate Films. The scheduled release date is early next
year.</TE>
<TE>   The rock star was forced to buy back the movie, which was
originally made at Universal Studios, because executives were put off
by its violence and gore.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Ortenberg, president of Lions Gate Films Releasing, had a
different reaction to the film, the story of two young couples
searching for a legend known as Dr. Satan during a misguided tour of
the back roads of America. Lost and stranded, they confront a bizarre
family of psychotics--not to mention encounters with murder and
cannibalism.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really looking forward to having a lot of fun with this
campaign," he said.</TE>

<TE>   Good news for performers upset with the Screen Actors Guild for
delays in mailing their residual checks--an ongoing problem at the

that it would speed things up by leaving off production information
from the mailing. And it seems to have worked.</TE>
<TE>   According to spokesman Hyanne Kichaven, the backlog has been
eliminated. Checks are now going out within 30 days of receipt, she

<HD>Israelis Rave Against the Machine</HD>
<DH>Politics* Dancers turn gatherings into a protest of the
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JO-ANN MORT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>Israel's young people have lived with the 35-year Israeli occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza for their entire lives. Now some of them
are trying to dance their reality away while also protesting the
occupation and what they perceive as social, economic and civil
inequities within Israeli society.</LD>
<LD>   They are part of Israel's rave culture, a phenomenon that once
encompassed close to 200,000 young people connected to a music and
dance lifestyle that became popular in the country in the 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   These raves, which feature trancelike music, sometimes included
5,000 to 10,000 participants in outside venues such as the Dead Sea
area. They often danced for days (with the help of drugs, Ecstasy
being the preferred substance).</LD>
<TE>   They were largely influenced by the thousands of Israelis in their
20s who trekked to Goa in India and back, lured by the exotica,
music, tranquillity and drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Today, owing to security concerns, the rave-goers from outside
Israel have disappeared along with the rest of the tourists who used
to visit Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "The global trance community embraces the Israel trancists and
even views Israeli trance as unique, distinguished and respected,"
said Bryan Meadan, who studied Israel's rave culture at Hebrew
University.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in the first year of the intifada, Tel Aviv was a
destination for Europeans going on club trips," said Didi Remez, an
Israeli peace activist who attends raves in Israel and Europe. "DJs
from Europe would come here, like in Amsterdam and Ibiza."</TE>
<TE>   A group of twentysomethings is trying to link the raves' appeal to
political events opposing the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Their efforts have been applauded on several rave Web sites, which
rave participants use to stay in touch across borders.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a dissonance between the way we live and the way people
live 5 to 10 kilometers away [the distance from Tel Aviv to the
Palestinian territories], but it's part of Israeli reality," said
Shay Rapaport, a 28-year-old Web site developer who is the main
organizer. "We use the raves as a tool of protest, what can be seen
as hedonism, but we have the will to live a normal life in
coexistence with Arabs. We just simply want to have fun together.
That's the kind of Israel we want to see. To show this in these dark
times is not cynical. It's daring."</TE>
<TE>   Meadan stresses that this isn't "the first time that there was an
attempt to politicize the rave movement in Israel. During the 1999
elections, there was a political party running on the platform of
legalizing marijuana that primarily came out of the trance cultures,
and they almost got in too. The phenomenon itself will not become a
political movement, but there will be a connection if they sustain
momentum."</TE>
<TE>   The first Rave Against the Occupation was held in May in Tel
Aviv's Museum of Art plaza. It lasted five or six hours, not the
usual 24-plus that apolitical raves last. Also, drug use was
discouraged at this rave. The slogan was "Leave the territories, or
don't leave the house."</TE>
<TE>   Yet while these young people have organized to call for an end to
the occupation, they are also preoccupied with what they feel is a
basic unfairness in Israeli society today.</TE>
<TE>   "This country is a young baby, and the values of democracy are not
yet rooted deep in its society," said Karni Cadan, one of the
organizers.</TE>
<TE>   Which is why, when a few thousand gathered for the first rave
against the occupation, they danced to the sound of rappers such as
Israeli Arab Tamar Napar, who comes from Lod, "the sewage city of
Israel," according to Cadan.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the performers sang in Hebrew and Arabic. Behind the
dancers and the DJs raving on the plaza, two video screens showed
images from the 1967 war followed by cartoons with an antimilitarist
tint.</TE>
<TE>   More raves are planned.</TE>
<TE>   Says Remez: "I've been organizing and participating in
demonstrations for years, but this was the first protest activity
that I felt actually expressed me. Instead of standing around
passively listening to a stagnant speech for an equally stagnant
politician, I could respond to biting political rap by dancing to it.
I could really be part of the protest."</TE>

<HD>Telling Stories Around the Fire With Camper Van Beethoven</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Natalie Nichols</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yeah, the Camper Van Beethoven reunion show Wednesday at the Knitting
Factory was a full-on nostalgia fest. But it didn't just recall the
days before "alternative" (to what?) rock became a marketing force.</LD>
<LD>   The mostly original members underscored the virtuosity and
playfulness of their pioneering '80s college rock by adeptly bringing
the alternately humorous and moving songs back to magical, majestic
life.</LD>
<LD>   Leader David Lowery's success came with his subsequent, more
straightforward band Cracker, but CVB, formed in Santa Cruz in 1983,
concocted a wry blend of rock, punk, ska, folk and world music that
honored dinosaurs such as Led Zeppelin while skewering the more
dogmatic trends of its own era. Case in point: the sardonic
college-radio favorite "Take the Skinheads Bowling."</LD>
<TE>   On the first of its two scheduled nights at the Knitting Factory,
Lowery, violinist Jonathan Segel, bassist Victor Krummenacher,
guitarist Greg Lisher, drummer Chris Pedersen and keyboardist David
Immergluck wrung every bit of sonic texture from the material,
sprinkled liberally with spaced-out instrumentals and flatly
punctuated by Lowery's nasal deadpan. Some favorites got left out,
but they did play the title tune of Fleetwood Mac's "Tusk," having
recently released the two-CD version of that album they recorded in
1987.</TE>
<TE>   Lowery sniped that for the audience, the gig meant a chance to
hear "Skinheads" again, while to the group it was about revisiting
its later albums, "Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart" and "Key
Lime Pie." But in truth, Camper had the near-capacity crowd from the
opening notes of the sweeping, "Pie"-era ballad "All Her Favorite
Fruit." And neither players nor listeners let go for two hours.</TE>

<HD>Jim Isermann, the Playful Wallpaperer</HD>
<DH>An installation of colorful decals turns the Hammer
Museum's windows and lobby into a playground for the imagination.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since 1980, Jim Isermann has designed, built and exhibited just about
everything anyone could want for a home: rugs, chairs, tables,
drapes, TV consoles, light fixtures, stained-glass windows, boldly
patterned paintings and cozy, fabric-covered sculptures. Over the
last five years, the Palm Springs-based artist has expanded the scale
of his works to include such public spaces as the entryways,
interiors and facades of galleries and museums.</LD>
<LD>   His latest installation, at UCLA's Hammer Museum, transforms the
lobby and front windows of the inhospitable office building into an
inspiring playground for the imagination.</LD>
<LD>   Around the marble stairway that takes visitors from street level
to the second-floor galleries, Isermann has affixed vinyl wallpaper
whose abstract pattern is at once wildly complicated and rigorously
consistent. It consists of snugly abutted squares and rectangles that
resemble empty picture frames or the borders of 35-millimeter slides,
with rounded outer corners and right-angled inner edges.</LD>
<TE>   Each shape comes in three sizes: small, medium and large. Most
come in one of six colors: red, yellow, blue, purple, green and
orange. Some are two-tone, combining red and purple, yellow and blue,
or green and orange. A few squares and rectangles are made up of
three colors.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Isermann's wallpaper appears to be a chaotic array of
blocky figure eights interspersed with innumerable zeros, like some
kind of newfangled computer code. But if your mind is able to wrap
itself around several ideas simultaneously, you'll eventually see
that the shapes follow a horizontal pattern, and the colors repeat
themselves vertically.</TE>
<TE>   A gallery brochure with a terrific essay by 2002 MacArthur Fellow
Dave Hickey includes a helpful photograph of a much larger
installation of Isermann's wallpaper. It's easier to see its pattern
when it was installed in 1999 at the Centre National d'Art
Contemporain in Grenoble, France--an enormous steel-and-glass
structure that was designed by A.G. Eiffel and is believed to be the
factory where the Eiffel Tower was built. At the Hammer, so few
repetitions take place that it's more difficult to discern the
pattern's logic.</TE>
<TE>   But that's part of Isermann's point. His installation is one of
those rare works of art that makes you wish it were bigger. Not
because it's not doing its job at its current size, but because its
surroundings would be so much more beautiful if the color-saturated
design extended beyond its borders.</TE>
<TE>   From two blocks away, the wallpaper in the front windows is as
sexy as a flash of skin glimpsed between a shirt's undone buttons or
a peek of flesh revealed when a skirt swooshes above a pair of
stockings. In this frame of mind, Isermann's fun-loving installation
provides pure visual stimulation.</TE>
<TE>   From another perspective it's suffused with melancholy. Its
bittersweet poignancy comes through when it makes you wonder why the
built environment around it is so hopelessly ugly.</TE>
<TE>   Isermann neither tries to shrink public spaces down to the size of
domestic rooms nor settles for filling museums with corporate-scaled
monstrosities. His city-scaled wallpaper blows most art away by
showing that idiosyncrasy and order can go hand in hand--if handled
with the right combination of talent and intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA Hammer Museum, 10899 Wilshire Blvd., Westwood, (310)
443-7000, through Dec. 29. Closed Mondays. Free admission to lobby.

<TE>   Bell's Recycling Project</TE>
<TE>   Becomes a Potent Series</TE>
<TE>   In terms of square inches, Larry Bell's "New Fractions" are about
four times the size of his old ones. In terms of visual impact,
they're about 10 times more potent. Each of the Taos, N.M.-based
artist's 20-by-20-inch works on paper commands so much space that
three fill a wall at Kiyo Higashi Gallery, where 30 or more of the
earlier versions once hung comfortably.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Bell began to rip a series of 1980s paintings from their
stretcher bars. He then cut these canvases, which had been treated
with thin layers of light-sensitive emulsion, into matchbook-size
bits. A few years before paper shredders became common features of
corporate offices, he treated a significant part of his oeuvre as if
it were a document in need of destruction.</TE>
<TE>   But Bell the recycler got the better of Bell the shredder. Rather
than discarding the cut-up bits and pieces of his paintings, he
sorted them into similarly tinted piles. This became his palette,
from which he selected handfuls of fragments, arranged them on small
sheets of watercolor paper and then ran the collages through a
laminating press.</TE>
<TE>   The machine's pressure and heat melted the various elements,
melding the abstract shapes into evocative compositions. Sometimes,
translucent layers blended together. At other times, they repelled
one another, like oil on water.</TE>
<TE>   From 1996 to 2001, Bell made more than 12,000 of these works. In
many, iridescent halos and shimmering swirls of color had the
presence of thumbnail mirages. Others seemed to be windows onto a
microscopic cosmos, a tiny world into which it was easy to fall.</TE>
<TE>   Although still modest in size, his "New Fractions" do not function
like miniatures. More closely matched to the scale of the human body,
each feels more earthbound and less dreamy, suffused with less
fantasy and more reality. Greater detail increases their immediacy,
in which beauty and violence fuse seamlessly.</TE>
<TE>   Fiery oranges, smoky blacks and twisted, metallic shards give them
the force of explosions. Many have melted to form circular puddles,
suggesting a post-apocalyptic world dissolving into even tinier
particles. Whatever one sees in Bell's indeterminate images, they
haunt the mind's eye--long into the night.</TE>
<TE>   Kiyo Higashi Gallery, 8332 Melrose Ave., L.A., (323) 655-2482,

<TE>   Koplin Group Show Takes</TE>
<TE>   an Academic Approach</TE>
<TE>   This year's installment of Koplin Gallery's biannual summer group
show is less rambunctious and rough-around-the-edges than previous
versions. Although a jolt of self-deprecatory humor can be found in a
handful of the 91 works on paper by 44 artists in "Drawings VI," the
show as a whole is notable for its sober, often solemn atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   As was the case two years ago, realistic depictions of the human
body predominate, with earnest renditions of anonymous individuals
outnumbering portraits of specific sitters. Each of the four walls in
the main gallery is anchored by an outstanding example of
contemporary Realism.</TE>
<TE>   On the back wall, Bill Vuksanovich's three portraits of ordinary
folks standing before blank backdrops are virtuoso demonstrations of
the power of direct observation. They give stunning form to the
richness of everyday details.</TE>
<TE>   On the opposite wall, three portraits by A.J. Smith bring a bit of
soft-focus sentimentality into the picture, casting the trio of
youngsters into the forgiving mists of memory.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Kerry James Marshall's 5-foot-tall conte crayon
drawing of a nude women reclining against the bank of a forest pond
dispenses with fussy details to capture the moonlit magic--and
physical vitality--of the muscular swimmer. Her modestly crossed legs
make her look like a mermaid.</TE>
<TE>   Across the gallery, Domenic Cretara takes a more classical, less
romanticized approach in two figure studies. Using red chalk to
sketch delicate lines, she captures the warmth and softness of living
flesh.</TE>
<TE>   Other standouts include David Bailin's loosely rendered image of a
nude communicating with mysterious natural forces, Robert Schultz's
subtly shaded women lost in thought or locking their eyes on viewers,
and Aaron Smith's tender depictions of self-absorbed youths.</TE>
<TE>   A small back gallery features images of animals, which are meant
to stand in as human surrogates. But aside from Fred Stonehouse's and
John Frame's comic-strip-inspired stories, and Tom Knechtel's
gorgeous pictures of a pig and a water buffalo, these images are too
lightweight to be memorable.</TE>
<TE>   Some truly funny works fuse masterful draftsmanship and wickedly
silly narratives. Thomas Stubbs' charcoal, chalk and pastel drawings
of sleeping nudes visited by Lilliputian figures and barnyard beasts
have the queasy presence of illustrations for twisted children's
books. F. Scott Hess' colored pencil drawings of a woman with a whip
and another looking over her shoulder are accompanied by handwritten
stories at once hilarious and macabre.</TE>
<TE>   Hung alongside Chris Finley's mutant cartoons, even Rico Lebrun's
old-fashioned "Minotaur"(from 1961) seems strangely
contemporary--less heavy-handed in its mimicry of Picasso and De
Kooning than usual. More unexpected juxtapositions like this would
shake some of the dust off the installation, whose uniformity is
unnecessarily academic.</TE>
<TE>   Koplin Gallery, 464 N. Robertson Blvd., L.A., (310) 657-9843,
through Sept. 7. Closed Sundays and Mondays.</TE>
<TE>   Millei's Paintings Are</TE>
<TE>   Thick With 'Flowers'</TE>
<TE>   Part of art's job is to confuse viewers--to present us with such
unexpected objects and experiences that we have to change the way we
think to make sense of them. All too often, however, artists mistake
art's means for its ends: They assume that their works only have to
be confusing to be interesting.</TE>
<TE>   At Ace Gallery, John Millei's new oils on canvas fall into this
trap. Although they pile up enough painterly maneuvers on their juicy
surfaces to confuse viewers about their purposes, they lack
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   In the seven large, abstract images that belong to a body of work
titled "The Real Life of Flowers," the L.A. painter appears to be
spinning his wheels, going through the motions of laying on paint
thickly and deeply out of sheer habit. Most of his approximately
7-by-6-foot canvases give with one hand and take away with the other.</TE>
<TE>   After covering each canvas with brightly colored fields punctuated
by stylized flowers and organic squiggles, Millei slathers over most
of them with a dense layer of dark paint that has the deadening
presence of tar or lava.</TE>
<TE>   He sometimes rakes these amorphous blobs with a comb-like tool,
carving furrows into their surfaces. At other times he drags his
paint-loaded brush across various sections, crossing out whatever is
under them. When he does this, he manages to make oil paint look as
if it's made of melted plastic, like cheap tubes of acrylic.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Millei's blotted-out paintings too closely resemble
Julian Schnabel's similarly configured images. With one foot firmly
planted in the New Yorker's tired gestures and the other in Charles
Arnoldi's bland abstractions, Millei leaves himself too little room
to do his own thing. Either more or less confusion is needed if this
body of work is to have enough traction to take viewers somewhere.</TE>

<HD>A Declaration of Independence, Belly Dancing-Style</HD>
<DH>From Tunisia, Raja Amari's feminist 'Satin Rouge' comes to
life when its heroine discovers the dance, and by extension
sisterhood and sexuality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quite possibly the first Tunisian feminist belly-dancing film, "Satin
Rouge" isn't your average empowerment trip. Written and directed by
31-year-old Raja Amari, the coming-of-middle-age story centers on a
widowed seamstress, Lilia (Hiam Abbass), who through belly dancing
finds herself in the company of women whose formidable bellies could
slap men silly and usually do.</LD>
<LD>   When the film opens, though, Lilia isn't yet found; she's barely
even there. Her life and worries seem to revolve exclusively around
her only daughter, Salma (Hend El Fahem), a lush teenage beauty who's
understandably reluctant to spend much time in a home that resembles
nothing so much as a tomb. Faded and 40-ish, with sloping cheekbones
and sad pooling eyes you could drown in, Lilia seems drained of
purpose, bereft of friends. There are a couple of snooping neighbors
in her life, and an equally intrusive brother-in-law, but most of the
time she keeps company with soap opera stars and her dead husband's
photograph, re-cleaning the already-scrubbed rooms of her forlorn
apartment.</LD>
<TE>   Timed to the rhythm of solitude, "Satin Rouge" takes awhile to get
going; for the first half-hour or so, dramatic tension doesn't build,
it loiters. Amari isn't in any particular hurry to get her story
going and she takes her time conveying the tedium of Lilia's routine,
to the point of risking our patience and interest. Lilia sews and
dusts, watches and worries, head bowed to the filmmaker's narrative
grindstone.</TE>
<TE>   Then, at the very moment you're ready to snap off the TV yourself
and boot the character and her director out the front door, something
happens: One afternoon while doing her housework, Lilia begins moving
to some music on the radio. Pausing in front of a full-length mirror,
she sways her hips and drifts into the moment, unaware that the
rhythm pulsing through her body is now coming from deep within.</TE>
<TE>   Because she's starting to awaken, Lilia suspects that her
daughter's nights may not be entirely innocent, going so far as to
track Salma's boyfriend, a flirty smoothie named Chokri (Maher
Kamoun), to the cabaret where he works as a drummer. Intrigued, Lilia
later returns to the club--she seems to be the only unescorted woman
on the desolate Tunis streets--and stumbles into a world of
undulating flesh and throbbing music, a world of such intoxication
that she instantly falls into a dead faint.</TE>
<TE>   Initially overcome ("the smoke, the men, the atmosphere," she
exclaims), once revived, Lilia proves unstoppable. Donning a spangled
push-me-up and peekaboo skirt, the widow soon shakes her inhibitions,
as well as an ample hourglass figure, and joins a sisterhood whose
cheeky transgression would delight Pedro Almodovar.</TE>
<TE>   Amari has the Spanish auteur's love of outsider communities and
she shares Belgian filmmaker Chantal Akerman's sense of
female-specific space, although her most prominent touchstone here is
Douglas Sirk's 1955 sudster "All That Heaven Allows." As in the Sirk,
it's a younger man who ushers the widow back into the world--which in
this case adds a wild mother-daughter kink--but in "Satin Rouge" she
also gets to make friends, dress like Scheherazade and work her
groove thing. That's also to the good of the film, because once Lilia
gets moving, the pace picks up considerably.</TE>
<TE>   Belly dancing isn't always the most thrilling of dances, but it's
a blast to see these women shaking and rolling because they're so
thoroughly in charge of the male clientele and their own sexuality.
If nothing else, these big, not necessarily beautiful bellies are a
sharp rebuke to a world in which a woman's perfection is measured by
how closely she shrinks to zero.</TE>
<TE>   When Lilia first tries on the belly dancer's costume alone in a
dressing room, the camera pans away before she undoes her clothes, as
if shielding its eyes (and ours) from her nakedness. There's a sense
of discretion, even modesty in how the camera looks away, and also a
sense of respect. But the camera movement is also useful because it
allows us to take in the surrounding clutter--a riot of color and
texture, along with a bottle of Johnny Walker--so at odds with the
ordered sterility of Lilia's home. The next time she tries on a
dancing outfit--this time surrounded by friends, not just their
clutter--it's clear that in stepping out of her everyday clothes,
Lilia has jumped into the fray for good.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be fun," promises one of the dancers. "We'll drive them
crazy." In "Satin Rouge," that's not just a promise, it's a
declaration of fabulous independence.</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: simulated sex without nudity and some
suggestive belly dancing.</TE>

<HD>An Actress Who's Happier Behind the Scenes</HD>
<DH>Theater* It took years for Barbara Beckley to realize that
her true calling was running the show as producing artistic director
of the Colony Theatre.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Barbara Beckley spoke to a roomful of theatrical producers and
marketers at a conference earlier this year, her listeners hung on
every word.</LD>
<LD>   She described her pre-show talks, in which she welcomes audiences
and pitches subscriptions to the Colony Theatre Company--where she's
producing director.</LD>
<LD>   The speeches apparently work. At its previous 99-seat venue, the
Colony attracted more than 3,500 regular subscribers. It often was
difficult to obtain single, nonsubscription tickets. The seating
crunch led the Colony to larger quarters at the 276-seat Burbank
Center Stage.</LD>
<TE>   The Colony continues to thrive, winning acclaim this year for its
L.A. premieres of the Broadway musical "Side Show" and the docudrama
"The Laramie Project." The latter marked the first use of the venue's
full capacity on a regular Actors' Equity contract--a hallmark of
professionalism in a region where most theater companies can't afford
contracts. The Colony's current "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown"
also drew critical cheers.</TE>
<TE>   But all that success doesn't mean that Beckley can stop the
curtain speeches. In front of her peers at the conference, Beckley
disclosed her deep dark secret: "I hate doing curtain speeches. I
loathe it.</TE>
<TE>   "But you would be amazed what a difference it makes," she added.
"It provides a face you can relate to."</TE>
<TE>   There was an irony in those words. For Beckley's personal turning
point was when she realized that she is just as happy behind the
scenes as she is on stage.</TE>
<TE>   "She has scrubbed the bathrooms, given up her own acting, put in a
lifetime of service for that theater," said Joe Stern, a TV producer
who also runs L.A.'s 99-seat Matrix Theatre and has often worked with
Beckley as a colleague on theater-community issues.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, two hours before curtain time on opening night of "The
Laramie Project," Beckley said, she mopped the theater restroom
floors. The janitors hadn't shown up that day. "Everybody was doing
whatever needed to be done," she said, a familiar scene to those who
run small theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Oklahoma but raised in New Rochelle, N.Y., young Barbara
Jean Beckley's introduction to theater was "Peter Pan," with Mary
Martin, on Broadway. She saw other Broadway musicals of the era with
her older sister.</TE>
<TE>   After the matinees, Barbara Jean begged to go backstage. But her
sister said no. "I thought she was weird. It wasn't until years later
that I realized she was normal," Beckley recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Seized With Inspiration</TE>
<TE>   At home, Beckley sang along with cast albums. But at school, "the
cool kids were in music, not drama," she said. Besides, her father
didn't think highly of acting, and "I was very much a pleaser, a
conformist." At age 12 or 13, "I realized I didn't have much of a
voice, one of my great tragedies."</TE>
<TE>   Her theatrical ambitions received a jump-start from a new drama
teacher, Jack Kissell. He even brought the then-unknown Martin Sheen
to talk to the class.</TE>
<TE>   Beckley apprenticed with a local musical theater company when she
was 16. Then, after a year at Middlebury College in Vermont, during
which her father died, she was seized with inspiration while watching
a New York Shakespeare Festival play in Central Park.</TE>
<TE>   At intermission, she found the stage manager and volunteered her
services. Soon, she was running the reel-to-reel tape machines for
"King Lear."</TE>
<TE>   One night, she forgot a cue, panicked and impulsively flicked a
switch that yielded a long, moaning sound--which was followed by the
line, "Hark, the king's trumpets." The audience laughed.</TE>
<TE>   The festival's producer, Joseph Papp, was on hand that night and
told Beckley, "That was nice. What do you do for an encore?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm astonished I didn't die on the spot," Beckley said. "To this
day, if a techie screws up and it doesn't kill them with shame, I
want to kill them."</TE>
<TE>   Beckley dropped out of college after one more semester and studied
acting in New York with the venerated Sanford Meisner. She got some
jobs and an Equity card. But she began to realize that "I didn't have
quite the same drive as the other actors I knew."</TE>
<TE>   She moved to L.A. and found plenty of unpaid opportunities, for
Equity had recently relaxed its rules to allow "waiver" productions
in sub-100-seat theaters. Beckley joined the nascent Colony, which
rented the Odyssey Theatre (then on Ohio Avenue in West L.A.) in 1974
to stage "The Crucible."</TE>
<TE>   'I Needed a Place to Act'</TE>
<TE>   Looking for a site for the loosely knit group's "Enter Laughing,"
Beckley found the Studio Theatre on the isolated east side of Silver
Lake--"the land that time forgot," Beckley calls it. "Enter Laughing"
landed at Hollywood's Cast Theatre, but when the group decided to try
a subscription season, it settled at the Studio.</TE>
<TE>   Terrence Shank was the artistic leader, but Beckley was the
Colony's main manager. "I was still telling myself that it was
because I needed a place to act," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Shank recalls that by 1984 he felt the group should try to expand
into larger quarters and Equity wages. Most of the others felt the
company wasn't ready. Beckley doesn't even recall this as a major
issue then. At any rate, Shank left.</TE>
<TE>   Now the artistic director of a small theater in Florida, Shank
recalled no friction with Beckley over his departure from the Colony.
"Our working partnership was like butter," he said. "I knew Barbara
would continue to lead the group."</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, "it landed in my lap," Beckley recalled. "For a few
years, I thought of myself as a caretaker, expecting someone else
would come along and lead us. I thought of myself as the grunt. And
then I had an epiphany."</TE>
<TE>   It occurred in 1986. A new play was causing problems in
rehearsals. But the company--including Beckley, the stage
manager--kept plugging away. On opening night, "when I called the
final cue, a huge roar went up. The leading actor looked like he was
taking a warm shower in the cheers--and sitting there in the dark,
completely anonymous in the booth, I realized I felt exactly the same
way."</TE>
<TE>   "That's when I got it--there's such joy in the process, in
creating an environment for talented people, watching their work meet
the audience. I stopped trying to find someone else to take over."</TE>
<TE>   A year later, the Colony began telemarketing. Subscriptions rose
from 835 to 1,845 in three months.</TE>
<TE>   Beckley didn't receive a salary until 1996, after a friendly
separation from her then-husband, fellow Colony member Michael Wadler
(they divorced this year).</TE>
<TE>   But she's been the Colony's chief programmer for longer than that.
"My evolution into queen," Beckley quipped, "took many years."</TE>
<TE>   "She's very good at picking shows that she loves and that the
audience can relate to," Wadler said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I get a chorus of no's" from her advisory committee, Beckley
said, "I rethink. I don't engrave my decisions on stone tablets." But
ultimately, "I'm the final word."</TE>
<TE>   The Colony began looking for a larger space in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   After a few false starts, the company moved to Burbank and opened
its first show there--directed by the visiting Shank--in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Promoting the L.A. Stage</TE>
<TE>   Beckley hasn't acted on the Colony stage since 1995. But she's a
key figure in the larger L.A. theater scene. In the late '80s, she
campaigned to preserve some form of Equity's "waiver" against
opposition from union activists. The dispute, heated at times, was
known as the "waiver wars."</TE>
<TE>   Edward Weston, who was a Beckley opponent as Equity's western
regional director, now says he's delighted the Colony moved up to a
contract "after all these years. We may have disagreed about whether
and when they should have made their move, but I always liked
Barbara." When he saw the Colony's "Side Show," he said of Beckley,
"She could not have been nicer."</TE>
<TE>   In a mid-'90s stint as board president of Theatre LA, the
organization that represents most L.A. theaters, Beckley became a
vehement promoter of the L.A. stage.</TE>
<TE>   So it's somewhat surprising to hear her say this: "I find it
difficult to go to the theater when I'm not involved in the
production. I can't surrender to the experience, as I do at the
movies. I find myself looking at the props, at the lights."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm wondering how they did it."</TE>

<HD>Two Pinter Plays but Only One Cast Comes Through</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harold Pinter's "The Collection" and "The Lover" were first presented
on television in 1961 and 1963, respectively, before they were
converted into short stage plays.</LD>
<LD>   Detailing sexual role-playing and power games, with plenty of
Pinter's early sense of mystery lurking in the corners, they were
televised in England, amazingly enough, in the same years when most
of America was watching TV westerns and "The Beverly Hillbillies."</LD>
<LD>   The staging by Anthony Caldarella at Hudson Backstage Theatre, set
unobtrusively in the present, is not so amazing. "The Lover" holds
up, but the cast that's appearing on Fridays and Sundays in the
double-cast "The Collection" has problems.</LD>
<TE>   "The Lover" depicts a proper English suburban home in which the
wife has scheduled afternoon sessions with a lover. We quickly
realize, however, that the "lover," Max, is really the husband, and
that he's increasingly restive in the role.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Olek dons a black leather jacket and shades for his Max
interlude--a more radical costume change than Pinter prescribed, but
one that certainly delineates the two characters.</TE>
<TE>   Olek's performance itself also draws an amusing line between the
stuffy husband and the stuffy husband's impersonation of a swinger.
At one point, while playing the husband, he exercises his upper body
with stretchy bands, as if he's determined to look good when he takes
off his shirt as Max.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Priver's wife, befitting the script, seems more at ease in
her sexual fantasies than does her mate. She works up a fine sulk
when it becomes apparent that he wants to quit playing the game.</TE>
<TE>   "The Collection" is about two couples whose boundaries are
temporarily porous, as one man accuses another of sleeping with his
wife, much to the consternation of the alleged seducer's older gay
lover and mentor. All four of the characters work in the fashion
industry.</TE>
<TE>   In the Fridays and Sundays cast, David Purdham and Brian Foyster
are excellent as the snide older man and his suggestive, somewhat
androgynous housemate. Colin McCabe has a properly menacing look as
the aggrieved husband, but he delivers his lines in a mumbled
monotone. And Yvette Brooks doesn't suggest the wife's sly,
manipulative side, playing only the wounded innocent.</TE>

<TE>   In 'Grasmere,' a Delicate Portrayal of Literary Souls</TE>
<TE>   In the literary love story "Grasmere," people's feelings overflow
in gorgeous cascades of words.</TE>
<TE>   This fictional meditation on the lives and poems of William
Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge is set in 1802 as Coleridge
pays an extended visit to the home that Wordsworth and his younger
sister, Dorothy, share in the village of Grasmere in England's Lake
District.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of that year, emotions cycle through their own
spring, summer, fall and winter in this delicate and hauntingly
beautiful presentation by Chautauqua Theatre Alliance at the Egyptian
Arena Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Dorothy, Wordsworth and himself, Coleridge once
commented that they were three persons with one soul. In 1802, they
were in their early 30s. Wordsworth and Coleridge had produced the
first edition of their influential "Lyrical Ballads" but were
beginning to advance along separate career paths, with Dorothy as
companion and muse.</TE>
<TE>   Playwright Kristina Leach tries to imagine how deeply Dorothy
(played by Annie Di Martino) must have loved these two very important
men in her life. "Grasmere" is seen through Dorothy's eyes, as her
happy, almost married life with her brother (Logan Sledge) expands to
admit Coleridge (Aaron G. Lamb), then Mary Hutchinson (Darcy
Blakesley), who would become Wordsworth's wife.</TE>
<TE>   Under Joe Arnold's direction, the poets' friendship is a playful
rivalry. While Coleridge begs Wordsworth for help in figuring out
what to do with the albatross in "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"
for instance, Wordsworth teasingly waggles Coleridge's handwritten
pages so that they look like a bird in flight.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Dorothy channels her literary impulses into a journal
that she tends to leave where the men can read it. Exploring a theme
similar to those in Tom Stoppard's "Arcadia" and David Auburn's
"Proof," Leach looks at the chauvinism that so often has excluded
women's contributions from history's annals.</TE>
<TE>   The story's focus becomes diffused after this development, and
purists will note that Leach has been heavy-handed with some facts
(not least of which is that, by 1802, "Ancient Mariner" already had
been in print for several years).</TE>
<TE>   But Leach, a recent graduate of Cal State Fullerton, and her play
are off to a promising start. The school's production of "Grasmere"
(which is, after minor script changes, what's being presented here by
Chautauqua) was invited to be part of the American College Theater
Festival's national showcase earlier this year at the Kennedy Center,
and the play was runner-up for a student playwriting award.</TE>
<TE>   Daryl H. Miller</TE>
<TE>   "Grasmere," Egyptian Arena Theatre, 1625 N. Las Palmas Ave.,
Hollywood. Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends Sept. 22. $18.

<TE>   'Honey, I'm Home' Pushes Premise Too Far</TE>
<TE>   Considerable deja vu haunts "Honey, I'm Home" at the Knightsbridge
Theatre Los Angeles. This latest from the parties responsible for the
1999 production "It Started With a Lie" maneuvers Tennyson's "Enoch
Arden" into a referentially saturated fey Feydeau.</TE>
<TE>   The premise concerns television co-stars Luke Donahue (the
courageous Alex Montesino) and Justin Tyler (co-author Bruce Hart).
Their off-screen liaison becomes tabloid fodder when Justin is lost
at sea.</TE>
<TE>   The ensuing public sympathy revives outed widower Luke's career,
so agent Max (the adept Peter Szeliga) advises him to keep
opportunistic new inamorato Brett (Lee Traylor) under wraps.</TE>
<TE>   Complications involve a star-struck designer (the game Stephen
Rock), the malevolent series producer (Paul Duff, shrewdly
underplaying until a heavy-handed climax) and a vitriolic interviewer
(co-author Paul Vander Roest, who also directs).</TE>
<TE>   Upon Justin's return, followed by fellow castaway Rod (the
effective Brian Grosdidier, a ringer for Douglas Sills), all heck
breaks loose.</TE>
<TE>   That this synthetic concoction seems a marked improvement on its
predecessor is a marginal achievement. Although likable and
determined, Vander Roest's industry vulture and Hart's butch action
hero are notably implausible, typifying the absence of objective
viewpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Their script is fitfully amusing, exhausting its brightest
element--the spousal resurrection, more fruitfully appropriated by
the 1940 film "My Favorite Wife"--before Act 1 has ended, resulting
in vacuum-packaged contrivances and an embarrassing attempt to
justify nudity.</TE>
<TE>   Theatergoers who kept "Lie" going may well enjoy "Honey," given
that they represent its primary audience.</TE>

<TE>   'Duct Tape &amp; Dreams': Perceptive but Predictable</TE>
<TE>   The theater world loves a play about plays ("Noises Off," "A
Chorus of Disapproval") almost as much as Hollywood loves a movie
about movies ("Sunset Boulevard," "The Player"). So a comedy about
life in Los Angeles' small-theater scene--where the ability to laugh
at hardship is almost a prerequisite--seems like a great idea.</TE>
<TE>   In "Duct Tape &amp; Dreams" at the Actors Workout Studio, however, the
idea doesn't translate into a great play.</TE>
<TE>   Playwright Jenelle Lynn Riley accurately pinpoints many of small
theater's drawbacks, such as having actors depart at a moment's
notice for better-paying work, or being so short of cash that props
must be scavenged from neighborhood dumpsters.</TE>
<TE>   But she almost always goes for laughs that can be seen coming from
a mile away, and director Scott White pushes them still further, so
that they can be seen from several area codes away.</TE>
<TE>   The stock characters include a temperamental director (White,
replacing Will Bowles) and a very actor-y actor (Chris Chauncey).
Then there's the boy-toy performer (Trey Stafford) who flirts
outrageously with the director even as he makes an extravagant show
of smooching with his dim-bulb, surgically enhanced actress-fiancee
(Sarah McElligott). (The fiancee ends up being cast, by the way,
because she has a cousin who works for The Times. Ha-ha. Very funny.)</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Riley has thrown in a couple of characters who are
somewhat easier to root for: a quiet but competent guy (Blake
Gardner) who's always overlooked and a sweet-natured, just-arrived,
stars-in-her-eyes gal (Lena Bouton).</TE>
<TE>   In a wry bit of casting, Riley plays the go-to gal who writes the
script, produces it, designs and builds the set, and tackles any
number of other tasks for this typically underfunded small-theater
production.</TE>

<HD>'Amy' Switches Routes on the Way to Fulfillment</HD>
<DH>A self-sufficient self-help author must reassess her
thinking when she falls for a guy who seems all wrong for her. Julie
Davis' story is fresh and amusing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Amy's Orgasm" is a sophisticated romantic comedy much like "Kissing
Jessica Stein."</LD>
<LD>   Like Jessica, Julie Davis' Amy Mandell is beautiful, intelligent,
Jewish--and unattached. Jessica's inability to find Mr. Right leads
her to experiment with her own sex, but Amy's predicament is more
challenging. While Jessica was a respected feature writer for a New
York newspaper, Amy is a nationally renowned self-help author whose
primary message is that women don't need men to feel fulfilled.</LD>
<LD>   In terms of her career and personal accomplishment, that's
certainly true. With her newest book, however, Amy has gone a step
further to explain to her ardent followers why love doesn't work.</LD>
<TE>   Promoting her book, Amy defies her publicist's advice and agrees
to go on the radio show of a notorious local shock jock, Matthew
Starr (Nick Chinlund). Both get more than they bargained for.
Confrontational to the max, Matthew discovers in Amy someone who can
confidently hold her own against him. Both are terrifically attracted
to each other as well. But where do they go from here, for Matthew,
single at 37, is as scared of marriage as Amy is of sex. Amy is
seriously out of touch with herself, Matthew less so. Both are ripe
for self-discovery, but there's a very real question as to whether
they'll even be able to begin this journey together, let alone get
anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   In this age of acute self-consciousness, the issues of fear of
hurt and inability to trust have been extensively explored. So it is
to the credit of Davis, who wrote and directed "Amy's Orgasm," that
her take is so consistently fresh and amusing.</TE>
<TE>   Like "Kissing Jessica Stein," "Amy's Orgasm" has a key strength in
its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty,
insight and humor.</TE>
<TE>   This goes not only for Amy and Matt, but also for Amy's publicist,
Janet (the always wonderful Caroline Aaron), and to a lesser extent
the priest (Jeff Cesario) to whom Jessica regularly confesses (that
she is Jewish doesn't faze her) and the married couple (Mitchell
Whitfield and Jennifer Bransford) who persistently urge Amy to give
love a chance.</TE>
<TE>   Janet is especially well-drawn: a lesbian with a controlling
nature yet genuinely concerned for what she considers Amy's best
interests. Janet is acerbically forthright, and Aaron brings her
alive with a wry, mature wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, whose last film as a writer-director was "I Love You, Don't
Touch Me," wears three hats in this picture with ease. A smooth,
well-burnished production, "Amy's Orgasm" has a natural flow and pace
that allow it to seem cinematic for all its considerable dialogue and
intense focus on its people.</TE>

<HD>Passion and Politics Boil Over in Spanish Romance 'Mad
Love'</HD>
<DH>Vicente Aranda's film, inspired by an arranged marriage in
1496 and its stormy aftermath, features a fiery performance by Pilar
Lopez de Ayala.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Juana, the Infanta of Spain, first encountered Philip of
Flanders--not for nothing known as Philip the Handsome--this was not
some random 1496 version of a cute meet. The formal get-together as
well as the couple's earlier engagement had been meticulously planned
like the state events they were, part of a calculated political
alliance between the rulers of Spain and the Hapsburgs of Central
Europe.</LD>
<LD>   But that doesn't stop the lusty "Mad Love" from staging the whole
thing like a rock star's wedding. Here's the hunky Philip (Daniele
Liotti), a Fabio look-alike down to his mane of curly hair, and the
fresh-faced beauty Juana (Pilar Lopez de Ayala), giving each other
looks steamy enough to boil holy water.</LD>
<LD>   The next thing you know, Philip demands that a handy padre marry
them on the spot, gives Juana a major kiss in front of God and
everyone, and then carries her off to have sex so hot the
ladies-in-waiting line up to eavesdrop on their passion. As Mel
Brooks once said, it's good to be the king.</LD>
<TE>   "Mad Love" is very much based on fact--Philip and Juana were 18
and 16 when they married--but it is more interested in being the kind
of full-bodied historical romance where people say things like, "Send
the swiftest horseman, you have to get this news to Flanders."</TE>
<TE>   Written and directed by 76-year-old Vicente Aranda, a veteran
Spanish filmmaker, in a style that is half-modern, half-traditional,
"Mad Love" succeeds as a full-bodied diversion because it takes even
its silly elements seriously. If you're in the mood for impressive
castles and sumptuous costumes, torch-lit processions and decorative
nudity, this is the place to turn.</TE>
<TE>   "Mad Love" also benefits from a fiery performance by Lopez de
Ayala, who won the Silver Seashell for best actress at last year's
San Sebastian film festival. She brings passion and conviction to the
part of Juana (anglicized to Joan in the English-language version), a
hotblooded type who would have benefited from one of those "Women Who
Love Too Much" books if they'd been around in the 15th century.</TE>
<TE>   Juana only knows Philip from a painting when she sets off for
Brussels in a procession long enough to make those 20-mule-team borax
convoys jealous. She leaves behind her siblings and her mother, Queen
Isabella (yes, that Isabella), who tells her that just because she's
marrying for political reasons doesn't mean she can't be happy.</TE>
<TE>   As noted, things start off well between Juana and Philip, but no
matter how steamy those nights in Brussels got, the monarch, though
undeniably cute, turns out to be an incorrigible womanizer incapable
of fidelity. When he gets involved with the smoldering Aixa (Manuela
Arcuri), his wife gets seriously unhappy.</TE>
<TE>   The queen, in fact, got so irritated at her husband that she went
down in history as Juana La Loca, Juana the madwoman. "Mad Love,"
however, in one of its few revisionist touches, sees her in a
different light.</TE>
<TE>   To writer-director Aranda, Juana is simply a quintessential modern
woman born centuries before her time. She embraces her sexuality, is
not ashamed to breast-feed her children though the court frowns on
it, and demands commitment from her spouse.</TE>
<TE>   If she gets, shall we say, a teensy bit overwrought about her
man's compulsive straying, who's to blame her?</TE>
<TE>   Complicating Juana's situation in real life and the film was the
political situation of the day. Unforeseen events make her queen of
Castille, and she becomes enmeshed in a complicated power struggle
between Flemish and Spanish nobility. That creates opportunities for
star Lopez de Ayala to make dramatic speeches about the unfairness of
it all.</TE>
<TE>   Although the politics are full of intrigue, it is, of course, the
stormy and steamy romantic interludes that are "Mad Love's" main
attraction. When Juana says things like "It must be madness to live
with anyone as despicable as you" and "You can't be in love if you
aren't jealous," she sounds as contemporary as a romance novel
heroine. Which is exactly the point.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for sexuality/nudity. Times guidelines: simulated
sexual activity.</TE>

<HD>SEC Elevates Bristol-Myers Sales Probe</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: SEC opens formal inquiry into how the firm
persuaded wholesalers to buy surplus of its drugs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said Thursday that a Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry into how the firm persuaded wholesalers last year
to buy surplus amounts of its drugs has been elevated into a formal
investigation.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC move is the latest setback for the New York-based drug
giant, whose earnings are reeling from the inventory problems, patent
expirations on key drugs and its controversial $2-billion cancer drug
partnership with ImClone Systems Inc.</LD>
<LD>   This month, Bristol-Myers said in a SEC regulatory filing that it
was cooperating with the SEC inquiry that began in April.</LD>
<TE>   Industry analysts have expressed concern that the company may have
artificially inflated its earnings last year by coaxing wholesalers
to buy huge surpluses of diabetes treatment Glucophage and a
half-dozen other medicines. It spurred the sales by announcing that
their prices were soon to be increased.</TE>
<TE>   The surplus buying has hurt demand for the same drugs this year,
contributing to an expected 50% decline in company earnings in 2002.
It also has harmed the credibility of Chief Executive Peter Dolan,
who took the helm in mid-2001.</TE>
<TE>   In its Aug. 14 SEC filing, Bristol-Myers also cautioned that it
might have to restate its earnings results for last year if the SEC
inventory inquiry is unfavorable.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers reaffirmed Thursday that it believes its accounting
treatment for the wholesaler buildup was appropriate and that it
continues to cooperate with the SEC review.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Bristol-Myers closed down 77 cents at $24.29 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Judge OKs Probe of Enron's Advisors</HD>
<DH>Energy: Accountants, bankers and lawyers can be subpoenaed.
Focus of Lay inquiry may have shifted to insider trading.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of bankers, lawyers, executives and accountants who may have
helped Enron Corp. hide debt and inflate profit must cooperate with
investigations of the energy company's collapse, a judge ruled.</LD>
<LD>   A panel of Enron creditors seeking evidence to bolster a bid to
recover more than $50 billion can begin investigating 47 financial
institutions, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez ruled. He also
authorized Enron bankruptcy examiner Neal Batson to subpoena
documents from about 400 financial institutions, 63 law firms, 30
former Enron executives and two accounting firms.</LD>
<LD>   The investigations "will necessitate a tremendous amount of effort
and coordination," Gonzalez said. He ordered the creditors' committee
and Batson to cooperate after Enron's bankruptcy lawyer expressed
concern about the costs of the case.</LD>
<TE>   Also Thursday, an attorney for former Enron Chairman Kenneth L.
Lay confirmed that investigators probing Enron's collapse are
examining Lay's stock sales--a sign of interest in insider-trading or
disclosure violations rather than accounting fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Ramsey, an attorney for Lay, said he had two meetings with
officials of the Justice Department, FBI and Securities and Exchange
Commission. Their questions centered on Lay's sale of $70.1 million
worth of stock back to Enron in the months before the energy trader
sought bankruptcy protection in December, Ramsey said.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Ramsey said Lay didn't do anything wrong, and the
federal investigators didn't refer to Lay as a subject or target of
fraud allegations. SEC and Justice Department spokesmen declined to
comment on the investigation of Lay.</TE>
<TE>   An insider-trading case might be easier to prove than accounting
fraud, some lawyers say. Lay sold 4.2 million shares for $189.4
million from 1997 to 2001, as Michael J. Kopper and other Enron
executives used off-the-books partnerships to hide $1 billion in
losses.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the large sums involved, insider trading offers the most
direct theory for a jury" if the government pursues charges against
Lay, said Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University Law School
professor and criminal defense attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Kopper, a former managing director of finance at Enron, pleaded
guilty last week to conspiracy to commit fraud in some of the
partnership transactions and implicated his former boss, ex-Chief
Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. Lay, who was chief executive or
chairman from 1997 to 2001, was not mentioned in the charges against
Kopper.</TE>
<TE>   Illegal insider trading, which carries maximum penalties of $1
million in fines and 10 years in prison, is the use of material,
nonpublic information when buying or selling stock.</TE>

<HD>GE to Merge Product Divisions</HD>
<DH>Conglomerate: Lighting and appliance units will be combined
as part of Chairman Jeff Immelt's reorganization moves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICH HARRIS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HARTFORD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>General Electric Co. is merging its lighting and appliance divisions,
two of its best-known product lines, into an $8-billion consumer
products business, as Chairman Jeff Immelt continues reshaping the
conglomerate.</LD>
<LD>   The combination should save money and further simplify operations,
Immelt said.</LD>
<LD>   "Because appliances and lighting have powerful connections with
similar consumer bases, we believe they will now be able to grow more
successfully together than either would on its own," Immelt said. "We
want to create a simpler, more efficient business that will be
competitive across all product lines."</LD>
<TE>   Merging consumer products divisions is the second major change
Immelt has implemented in as many months as he reorganizes the
Fairfield, Conn.-based conglomerate he took over from legendary CEO
Jack Welch a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Immelt announced a reorganization of GE Capital that
split the financial services giant into four divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks to me like another bold move for Jeff Immelt. Makes
sense," said analyst Scott Davis of Morgan Stanley.</TE>
<TE>   "Both businesses are selling to consumers, both businesses have
below-average margins at the firm, and certainly there appears to be
some synergies in putting the two businesses under one management
structure," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   The company said the new unit, GE Consumer Products, will be based
in Louisville, Ky., where about 6,000 workers produce washing
machines, dishwashers and refrigerators. The division will keep a
substantial presence in Cleveland, which has been home to the
lighting operations.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Freeman, a GE spokeswoman in Louisville, said the merger
probably will lead to job reductions but it's too soon to say how
many.</TE>
<TE>   GE said the changes are effective immediately, and said it would
start consolidating operations around the world, especially in areas
of administration and retail services.</TE>
<TE>   For many consumers, appliances and lighting are GE's best-known
products. The two businesses accounted for 7% of GE's $126 billion in
revenue last year.</TE>
<TE>   GE sells more than 15 million appliances each year in 150 world
markets. GE Lighting produces about 6,000 products and operates
nearly 50 manufacturing facilities around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of GE, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average,
fell 95 cents to $30.35.</TE>

<HD>Rising Cocoa Prices Squeeze Candy Makers</HD>
<DH>Food: Busy Halloween season may prove only semisweet for
Hershey and Mars as higher costs cut into their profits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Soaring world cocoa prices may signal a profit squeeze for Hershey
Foods Corp., Mars Inc. and other chocolate makers as they gear up for
Halloween, their busiest sales season.</LD>
<LD>   In trading Thursday in New York, near-term cocoa futures jumped
$40 to $2,023 per metric ton, the highest price in 15 years. The
price has leaped 54% this year after rising 73% last year.</LD>
<LD>   Cocoa has rocketed as the Ivory Coast, the world's top grower, and
other countries have failed to produce enough to meet demand from
chocolate manufacturers. World demand has exceeded supply for two
years.</LD>
<TE>   "If cocoa prices stay at this level, everybody will have to charge
more for their products," said Dennis Roney, president of Baraboo
Candy Co., the Wisconsin-based maker of Moo Chews, Udderfingers and
other candies. "You don't like to raise prices during a bad economy,
but we'll have to if prices stay this high."</TE>
<TE>   Rising cocoa costs also are hurting profits of cocoa processors.
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the largest cocoa bean processor in the
U.S., has increased prices over the last three months for the cocoa
butter, liquor and powder it sells to Hershey and other
manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   "The rise hasn't been as much as what we've seen in cocoa prices,"
said Larry Cunningham, ADM's head of corporate affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Most candy makers are holding off on raising retail prices because
they don't want to lose market share, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Producers of branded chocolate like Hershey's will hesitate to
pass on price increases to consumers in the supermarket because the
chocolate market is very competitive and they don't want to lose
consumers," said Pascal Pruess, an analyst with Zuercher Kantonalbank
in Zurich, Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Baraboo, which sells about 1 million pounds of chocolate a year,
has not raised prices in two years, Roney said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for closely held Mars said the company had not
raised retail prices in six years but would not say whether it was
considering an increase now. A Hershey spokesman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The latest surge in cocoa prices is expected to put profit margins
under pressure at all candy companies, experts said. Cocoa was at
$1,630 per ton in late June.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation that the next growing season will bring another crop
deficit may push prices as high as $2,400 a ton in coming months,
said Luis Rangel, a cocoa broker at Fimat USA Inc. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   But some traders expect prices to fall once the Ivory Coast's crop
starts arriving at export docks in October. Cocoa may fall as low as
$1,600 a ton, said John Gibbons, senior cocoa trader at Atlantic
Cocoa Co. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the charitable trust that controls Hershey is facing an
additional legal challenge to its authority to sell the candy maker,
this time from the alumni of the school founded by Milton S. Hershey
and financed by the trust.</TE>
<TE>   The trust said last month that it would put the company up for
sale, driving the stock price up as investors bet on a rich bid.
Swiss chocolate giant Nestle's is said to be interested, and Kraft
Foods Inc. also may bid, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The Milton Hershey School Alumni Assn. filed a petition with the
Dauphin County Orphans Court on Thursday, said Ric Fouad, the
association's president.</TE>
<TE>   The petition seeks to have the association appointed as the
representative of the school's pupils, who are the trust's sole
beneficiaries. The school caters to economically disadvantaged
youths.</TE>
<TE>   The move follows an attempt by Pennsylvania Atty. Gen. Mike Fisher
to halt a possible sale, arguing it could do irreparable harm to the
community supported by the nation's largest candy maker.</TE>
<TE>   Hershey in July reported second-quarter net income of $63.1
million, or 46 cents a share, 20% higher than a year earlier. The
maker of York peppermint patties, Reese's peanut butter cups and
other brands is selling more to convenience stores and is eliminating
less-profitable candy sizes and items to boost sales and cut costs.</TE>
<TE>   Hershey shares eased 6 cents to $76.20 in trading Thursday on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Some reports have estimated that the bidding for Hershey could
reach $85 a share. But if the sale is delayed, the stock could
tumble. It traded at about $57 before the company was put up for
sale.</TE>

<HD>IRS Seeks More Records in Tax-Evasion Probe</HD>
<DH>Investigation: The agency wants credit card transactions
from more than 40 companies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The government's ongoing tax-fraud dragnet widened on Thursday, with
tax authorities requesting customer information from a wide array of
companies, including American Airlines and America Online.</LD>
<LD>   The action, which involved filing legal papers in federal courts
in seven cities, was the latest in a series of legal summonses aimed
at ferreting out Americans suspected of hiding assets overseas to
illegally evade income taxes. The Internal Revenue Service believes
that U.S. citizens access overseas cash through credit cards issued
by offshore banks, and has pressed successfully for credit card
transaction information from Visa International Inc., MasterCard Inc.
and American Express Co.</LD>
<LD>   The summonses were prompted by transaction information the tax
agency got from MasterCard and American Express in the last year. In
some cases the IRS doesn't know the name or address of the
cardholder; that is what the agency is seeking from the merchants,
said Dale Hart, deputy commissioner in the agency's small-business
and self-employed division. The agency believes that the companies
accepting the credit cards will have gotten identifying information
from the users, such as driver's license numbers, names and
signatures.</LD>
<TE>   The IRS is seeking credit card transaction records from more than
40 companies, including all the major airlines, as well as major
hotel chains, car rental companies, online service providers and
retailers including Hammacher Schlemmer &amp; Co., Nordstrom Inc. and
cosmetics giant Mary Kay.</TE>
<TE>   The summonses were filed in Alexandria, Va.; Atlanta; Chicago;
Dallas; Newark, N.J.; San Francisco and Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   These companies are not suspected of wrongdoing, government
officials stressed. They are simply believed to have information
pivotal to ongoing IRS examinations.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury loses $20 billion to $40 billion in tax revenue each
year because of offshore accounts used by 1 million to 2 million
people, according to the General Accounting Office, the congressional
auditing agency. Only 117,000 Americans disclosed they had offshore
accounts in 1999, the last year for which statistics are available,
the IRS said.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Dow Stumbles; Bargain Hunting Boosts Nasdaq</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Analysts say selling over the last few days is
no surprise as investors take profits. Yahoo leads tech gain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street stumbled through a choppy session Thursday and ended
mixed, with blue chips giving up a modest gain and tech stocks
holding on to their own moderate advance.</LD>
<LD>   Investors clearly were ambivalent as they analyzed two economic
reports. A Labor Department report of a jump in unemployment
insurance claims fed early selling, but investors took some heart
from a Commerce Department report on the gross domestic product.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 23.10 points, or
0.3%, at 8,670.99, after gaining as much as 51 points and falling as
much as 136 during the day. That came after a 1.5% decline Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The broader market was mixed. The Nasdaq composite index rose
21.39 points, or 1.6%, to 1,335.77 after having fallen 2.5%
Wednesday. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index dipped less than a point
to 917.80.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by about 9 to 7 on both Nasdaq and the New York
Stock Exchange. Volume was light ahead of the three-day holiday
weekend. U.S. markets will be closed Monday for Labor Day.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department said the economy as measured by the gross
domestic product grew in the second quarter at an annual rate of
1.1%. The reading was unchanged from its initial estimate a month
ago. But new claims for unemployment insurance rose last week to the
highest level since July 6. Economists had expected claims to
decline.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said investors, despite initial concerns about the GDP
number, later seemed to be somewhat encouraged that the figure was
not revised downward. That would have raised fears of a possible
"double-dip" recession.</TE>
<TE>   Tech shares, meanwhile, got a boost on a bout of bargain hunting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more bottom-fishing more than anything else," said Robert
Froehlich, investment strategist for Deutsche Asset Management in
Chicago. "Short-sellers are covering their positions, giving some
strength and stability to the market."</TE>
<TE>   In a short sale, a trader borrows stock and sells it on the
expectation that the share price will drop. If the bet is correct the
trader can buy new shares at lower prices later to replace the loaned
stock.</TE>
<TE>   But if the stock rises instead of falls, the trader may scramble
to buy back the stock earlier than planned to close out the bet. With
the market's rally since late July, more short sellers may be rushing
to buy shares, helping to stoke the advance, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Since its July 23 closing low of 7,702.34, the Dow is up about
1,000 points.</TE>
<TE>   "What's going on this week is some normal profit taking," said
Alfred E. Goldman, market strategist for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons. "The
big picture is a market that is bottoming, but it doesn't happen
overnight."</TE>
<TE>   Losers Thursday included companies with downgraded shares or
disappointing earnings outlooks. General Electric fell 95 cents to
$30.35 after Lehman Bros. cut its 2003 earnings estimates on the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Kroger, parent of the Ralphs supermarket chain, dropped
$1.16 to $18.34 after J.P. Morgan Chase downgraded its shares to
"market perform" from "buy," saying Wal-Mart and other rivals are
stealing market share.</TE>
<TE>   Shoe retailer Footstar fell $2.10 to $11.45 after cutting its
third-quarter outlook. That dragged down shares of athletic shoe
makers such as Reebok, which fell $3.07 to $24.63, and Nike, which
lost $1.55 to $42.98.</TE>
<TE>   Helping to boost tech stocks was Yahoo, which rose $1.12 to
$10.25, after Merrill Lynch raised its rating to "neutral" from
"sell."</TE>
<TE>   Retailer Chico's rose $2.10 to $17.18 after meeting fiscal
second-quarter earnings expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Yields on Treasury securities fell for a fourth day in five after
the jobless claims report bolstered expectations that a faltering
economic rebound would prompt the Federal Reserve to leave interest
rates at a 41-year low until next year. The yield on the benchmark
10-year Treasury note slipped to 4.14% from 4.21% on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "If people aren't going to be employed, I don't see how you can
get much of a recovery," said Peter Cordrey, fixed-income manager at
Prudential Asset Management.</TE>

<HD>30-Year Fixed Mortgage Rate Slips Back to 6.22%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The average rate on 30-year fixed mortgages nationwide fell this week
to match the lowest level in more than three decades, according to
home loan finance firm Freddie Mac.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-year rate declined to 6.22%, from 6.27% last week. The new
rate matched the rate in the week ended Aug. 16, which was the lowest
since Freddie Mac began keeping records in 1971.</LD>
<LD>   Mortgage rates tend to track yields on long-term Treasury
securities. Treasury yields sank to generational lows in mid-August
as investors continued to seek safe-haven securities amid worries
about the economy. Yields then briefly rebounded before falling again
this week.</LD>
<TE>   The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell as low as 4.09% on
Aug. 13, then jumped to 4.33% three days later. On Thursday, the
yield dropped to 4.14%, from 4.21% on Wednesday, after a government
report showed more sought jobless benefits last week.</TE>
<TE>   The average rate on a 15-year fixed mortgage fell to 5.64% this
week from 5.71% last week, Freddie Mac said. Two weeks ago the rate
reached 5.63%, the lowest since the firm began tracking such rates in
August 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The average rate on a one-year adjustable mortgage this week was
unchanged at 4.34%.</TE>

<HD>Boeing Rejects Further Talks With Machinists</HD>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Federal mediators Thursday asked Boeing Co. and its largest union to
extend their contract by 30 days and resume negotiations, but the big
airplane maker refused, setting the stage for a possible strike
beginning Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "There is nothing left to negotiate," the company said.</LD>
<LD>   Late Thursday, representatives of the International Assn. of
Machinists said members will continue to work after the contract
expires, perhaps averting a walkout despite Boeing's refusal to
reopen talks.</LD>
<TE>   Workers would report to their jobs after the Sunday midnight
expiration of their contract, in response to the federal mediators'
request to resume negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators from Boeing and the machinists union had been asked
Thursday morning to report to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service headquarters in Washington on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The union was in the process of voting on whether to accept
Boeing's "best and final" offer, made Tuesday, or strike.</TE>
<TE>   A letter from mediation service director Peter Hurtgen said the
agency was stepping in because "any job action threatens to cause a
substantial disruption of commerce."</TE>
<TE>   The union quickly agreed to take part in the talks, said Richard
Barnes, the mediation service's deputy director.</TE>
<TE>   But Boeing refused. "The teams spent months negotiating in good
faith," the company said. "The Boeing negotiating team has done
everything possible and within reason to craft an offer that is fair,
competitive and respectful."</TE>
<TE>   In anticipation of resuming negotiations, the union had said it
would seal the ballots without counting them Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing shares fell 36 cents to $37.17 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>State Expects Job Growth Next Year</HD>
<DH>Economy: Report says health, education and computers should
be the fastest-growing sectors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recession cost California 63,000 jobs, but the worst is over,
according to a state report released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Job growth is averaging 1,500 new positions a month this year,
contrasted with losses of 2,200 a month in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Next year, the state could see job growth of 2% above its existing
14.7 million nonfarm jobs, according to the Employment Development
Department report. The state is expected to add about 3.2 million
jobs by 2010.</LD>
<TE>   More than 450,000 of those positions could be added in retail
sales, cashiering, food preparation and service, computer support and
software engineering, the study said. The fastest-growing sectors of
the job market are expected to be computers, health and education.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the dot-com collapse, "the structure of technology remains
very strong in the state" and demand for related skills continue,
said Michael Bernick, director of the EDD. The state economy remains
highly diversified and fundamentally sound, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 16.5 million Californians now have jobs. As of July, 1.1
million people were unemployed, half after losing their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The report estimated that unemployment increased by 292,000 people
from January 2001 through last month. That included those who are
self-employed and people holding farm jobs, Bernick said. During the
same period, California lost 63,000 nonfarm jobs. Coupled with
population growth, that sent unemployment soaring.</TE>

<HD>2 Telemarketers Indicted in Credit Scheme</HD>
<DH>Courts: Canadians are accused of taking more than $3
million. Lawyer says they had permission to charge the elderly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A pair of Canadian telemarketers were indicted Thursday in Los
Angeles on federal charges of bilking mostly elderly victims of more
than $3 million in a credit card protection scheme.</LD>
<LD>   Philip Arcand, 41, and Roberta Galway, 34, who operated in the
Vancouver area of British Columbia, could face federal prison terms
of up to 34 years if convicted on all charges, which include mail
fraud and committing telemarketing fraud against the elderly.</LD>
<LD>   Canada is a hotbed of phone frauds targeting U.S. seniors because
Canadian courts rarely impose prison sentences for financial crimes.
U.S. authorities have faced substantial obstacles in extraditing
Canadian fraud suspects, but on occasion have arrested suspects when
they stepped on U.S. soil.</LD>
<TE>   That's what happened to Arcand and Galway, who had purchased a
home in Las Vegas and were arrested there Aug. 14, said Ellyn
Lindsay, an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unconscionable that these people made millions of
dollars--purchasing fancy houses and sports cars--by victimizing the
most vulnerable of our population," Lindsay said.</TE>
<TE>   Arcand and Galway were being held in the federal Metropolitan
Detention Center in Los Angeles pending a bail hearing scheduled for
Sept. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Operating under such names as American Card Services, Garrison
Corp. and Farpoint Services International, Arcand and Galway offered
to protect customers from unauthorized use or theft of their credit
cards for a fee of $199 to $389 apiece, the grand jury indictment
said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment, victims were asked by telemarketers
to "verify" their credit card numbers by reading them over the phone.
Charges then were put on victims' cards whether they agreed to buy
the service or not, the indictment states.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the indictment says, Arcand and Galway did not provide
any services in exchange for the fees and were aware that major
credit card firms already insure customers against unauthorized
charges.</TE>
<TE>   An affidavit filed by the FBI identified several alleged victims
of the scheme from Hawaii, Michigan, West Virginia and Massachusetts,
as well as Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavit quoted Elaine Kuzma, a former employee of Arcand and
Galway, as telling investigators that the majority of customers were
elderly, and that "some of them understood what was happening, but
many did not and were confused. Further, the telemarketers used
high-pressure tactics on them."</TE>
<TE>   According to the affidavit, Kuzma also said Arcand and Galway
owned an expensive house, a Mercedes-Benz, a Corvette, a BMW and a
Ferrari and often traveled to places such as Hawaii and Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Dominic Gentile, Arcand's lawyer, said his client would plead not
guilty. Gentile said certain charges were in error.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody's credit card was charged without them
giving permission to do so," he said. Gentile also said it wasn't
true that customers got nothing in return for their payments.</TE>
<TE>   Although the bulk of the charges involve the offer of charge card
protection, Arcand and Galway also were accused of processing credit
card charges for other telemarketers involved in the illegal sale of
foreign lottery chances.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay said the case "demonstrates that you should never, ever
read your credit card [number] over the phone to someone who calls
you, even if they say they're with your credit card company."</TE>

<HD>CleanFlicks Suit Names 16 Directors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seeking to preempt possible legal action by Hollywood copyright
holders, CleanFlicks of Colorado filed a lawsuit Thursday seeking a
determination on whether its practice of editing feature film videos
for G-rated audiences are protected under federal law.</LD>
<LD>   The suit names as defendants 16 prominent directors, including
Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, Steven Spielberg, Steven Soderbergh
and Michael Mann, and alleges they have announced plans on the
Directors Guild of America's Web site to seek a permanent injunction
against CleanFlicks and other similar companies.</LD>
<LD>   CleanFlicks, a Colorado franchise of CleanFlicks of Pleasant
Grove, Utah, says it edits out and, in some cases, alters movie
content that might be objectionable to some viewers who would
otherwise not watch a particular film. In the lawsuit, filed in U.S.
District Court in Denver, the company says an original copy of the
movie is always purchased and then edited and sometimes copied.</LD>
<TE>   Joining CleanFlicks as a plaintiff in the suit is Robert Huntsman,
who has a pending patent on a technology that would allow consumers
to use filters to alter a movie without making copies.</TE>
<TE>   The Directors Guild, which represents more than 12,000 members,
said the lawsuit is wholly without merit. "We believe it is the
plaintiffs who, through their unauthorized altering of original
works, are in violation of the law," the DGA said in a statement.</TE>

<HD>Pace of Economic Recovery Slows</HD>
<DH>Indicators: A report confirms second-quarter GDP growth at
1.1% rate, down from 5% in the first. Jobless claims rise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE AVERSA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The economic recovery lost momentum in the second quarter, and in a
fresh sign of weakness, new claims for jobless benefits last week
climbed to their highest level in nearly two months.</LD>
<LD>   After bolting out of the gate with a brisk 5% growth rate in the
first quarter, the economy stumbled in the spring, growing at an
annual rate of just 1.1%.</LD>
<LD>   The Commerce Department's latest reading Thursday on gross
domestic product in the April-June quarter was unchanged from its
initial estimate a month ago. GDP measures the total value of goods
and services produced in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   A second report raised concerns about the lackluster job market.
For the third week in a row more Americans filed new claims for
unemployment insurance. Claims rose by 8,000 last week to a
seasonally adjusted 403,000, the Labor Department said. Economists
were expecting claims to go down.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's increase pushed claims over the 400,000 mark, a level
associated with a weak job market, to their highest point since July
6, when claims hit 407,000. That's also the last time claims climbed
over 400,000.</TE>
<TE>   The number of unemployed people continuing to collect jobless
benefits jumped by 90,000 to 3.6 million for the week ended Aug. 17,
the most recent period for which information is available. That
suggests not a lot of hiring is going on, economists said.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's unemployment rate--now at 5.9%--could hit 6.3% or
6.5% by the fall, economists said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts believe the economy has picked up a bit in the current
quarter, with some estimating growth rates of 2% to 3%. They said
economic growth would have to be stronger for businesses to add
vigorously to their payrolls and trigger a hiring wave.</TE>
<TE>   For the second half of this year, some economists are predicting
sluggish to moderate economic growth. The shape of the recovery
ultimately will be determined by consumers and the willingness or
reluctance of businesses to spend and invest in the months ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve, hoping to give a boost to the recovery, has
held short-term interest rates steady all year.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses, concerned about accounting scandals and economic
uncertainties, have been wary of making big commitments to hiring and
capital investment, factors restraining the recovery.</TE>
<TE>   The GDP report showed that after-tax profits of U.S. corporations
increased at a rate of 1.7% in the second quarter, down from a 2%
growth rate in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses in the second quarter cut spending on plants, office
buildings and other structures at a rate of 17.7%, a deeper cut than
initially estimated. But investment in equipment and software, after
six straight quarters of decline, increased at a rate of 3.1% in the
second quarter, stronger than previously estimated.</TE>

<HD>Private Messages Leaked on IVillage</HD>
<DH>Internet: The firm says it doesn't know what caused the
e-mail glitch. Some fear disclosure of personal data.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>D. IAN JOPPER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Women who logged on Thursday to IVillage.com, a Web site network
devoted to women, found not only the typical discussions on
breast-feeding and children but also other people's private messages,
prompting fears that their own personal comments might be revealed.</LD>
<LD>   Each time the site's users logged on, they saw a different
person's messages.</LD>
<LD>   "I tried about seven or eight times and each time got a different
user's in box, including someone I recognized from another message
board at ParentsPlace," one of IVillage's Web sites, said Laurie
Clark of Fenton, Mich.</LD>
<TE>   Clark said she could access other people's messages, though she
was careful to read only junk mail.</TE>
<TE>   IVillage Inc. spokesman Carl Fischer said the company was aware of
the glitch and was trying to fix it.</TE>
<TE>   IVillage took its e-mail system offline at 7 a.m. Fischer declined
to say how many people have IVillage e-mail addresses.</TE>
<TE>   The company did not rule out a hacker attack as the cause.</TE>
<TE>   "We're concentrating on finding out what went wrong," Fischer
said. "We're not going to put it back up until we find out for sure
what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Comscore Media Metrix, a Web ratings firm, ranks IVillage, with
about 9.5 million users, among the top 30 Web destinations. New
York-based IVillage recently bought rival Women.com and owns the
satellite television network Newborn Channel, shown in more than
1,000 hospitals. IVillage also runs the Web sites of several women's
magazines, including Cosmopolitan and Redbook.</TE>
<TE>   Some IVillage users said they feared for their financial
well-being as well as their personal privacy.</TE>
<TE>   "I have some e-mails in there from my electric and phone company
that may contain my account numbers," Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   Several IVillage message boards referred to the glitch and
contained messages from irate members.</TE>
<TE>   "It has happened now about 10 times! I am going to delete anything
personal in there ASAP! I don't know why I bother using free
stuff!!!!" said one, who identified herself only as "Tina."</TE>
<TE>   Several free Web e-mail systems have had their share of problems.
This month, the South China Morning Post reported that people who
accessed Yahoo Inc.'s e-mail service through a mobile phone could see
other users' e-mail accounts at random.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft Corp.'s Hotmail e-mail service has had several security
problems in the last couple of years, allowing anyone to read a
user's e-mail address. Each of the holes took as long as a day to
fix.</TE>
<TE>   IVillage shares closed unchanged at 84 cents on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Gotcha Says Dispute Forced It to File for Chapter 11</HD>
<DH>Apparel: Orange County surf wear maker cites cash crunch
stemming from suits over licensing pact.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gotcha International, a pioneering Southern California surf wear
company that was once a dominant player in the market, has filed for
reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code amid a bitter legal
battle with a business partner.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which filed for Chapter 11 protection Aug. 23, was
forced to act because of a dispute with Ederal Sport Inc., Gotcha
President Donald Grier said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Ederal, which began manufacturing Gotcha brand clothing under
license three years ago, sued Gotcha last fall, claiming Gotcha
misrepresented its sales when the licensing deal was struck.</LD>
<TE>   Gotcha disputed the allegation and filed a countersuit against
Ederal, citing failure to pay royalties and other problems. The issue
is still in court, but the dispute made it harder for Gotcha to sell
products and deprived it of royalties, Grier said.</TE>
<TE>   Under Chapter 11, Irvine-based Gotcha can remain in business and
will have more flexibility in dealing with its debts.</TE>
<TE>   Gotcha, owner of the Gotcha, Gotcha Girl, GirlStar and MCD brands,
has since struck new licensing agreements to manufacture its clothing
and hopes to emerge from bankruptcy protection in three to five
months, Grier said.</TE>
<TE>   "We plan to move very fast," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The filing is the latest in a series of setbacks for the company,
said Joel Cooper, who co-founded Gotcha in a garage with partner
Michael Tomson 24 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper and Tomson are separately suing Gotcha for almost $2
million that they claim is owed them from the sale of the company to
Marvin Winkler about five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It was our baby, so seeing it go downhill has been sad," said
Cooper, now chief executive of Lost Enterprises, a surfboard and surf
wear maker in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Gotcha rose to prominence in the 1970s, along with Quiksilver Inc.
of Huntington Beach, now the world's largest surf wear maker. The
companies followed a path tread by pioneer brands Hang 10 and Ocean
Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Gotcha hit its pinnacle in 1989 when worldwide sales reached about
$160 million and then stumbled badly in the following decade when it
put its colorful surf designs on the back burner to respond to the
then-burgeoning "street" look.</TE>
<TE>   Gotcha's fortunes most recently have been steered by Winkler, who
with his wife, Sherri, owns 98% of the company, said Grier. Sherri
Winkler is currently the chief executive, and Marvin Winkler is no
longer involved in the company's daily operations, Grier said.</TE>
<TE>   The Gotcha name was back in the news last year, when Winkler's
plans to build Gotcha Glacier, an indoor snowboarding, skateboarding
and surfing park near Edison International Field, collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Grier traces the company's problems to Ederal, also of Irvine,
which took over the licensing of Gotcha brands in 1999. He maintains
that Ederal failed to pay Gotcha the minimum royalties and
advertising payment of more than $1.7 million annually. Disputes also
arose over design approval and product distribution.</TE>
<TE>   Grier said Ederal wanted to sell the branded clothing in stores
such as Sam's Club and Costco, which Gotcha felt would damage the
brand.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have the ability to relicense the Gotcha, GirlStar and
MCD brands due to the litigation, and in the meantime we were not
receiving our royalty payments according to the agreements," Grier
said. "With that combination, it put us into a very difficult
position."</TE>
<TE>   Ederal attorney Bryan Friedman said Gotcha misrepresented its
annual revenue before the company became the Gotcha licensee, saying
its claim of annual sales exceeding $30 million was exaggerated.
Since Ederal has been involved with the company, its highest annual
sales were $19 million, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman also maintains that Gotcha failed to support the brand
with proper marketing and advertising, making it difficult to sell
the products to surf shops and some department stores. He also said
customers had become less interested in Gotcha products.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the bankruptcy filing and ongoing lawsuits, Grier
maintains that Gotcha still has a bright future.</TE>
<TE>   He said Gotcha's new licensing agreement for its Gotcha brand for
boys and young men is with Michael Gerald Ltd., an importer and
licensee of sportswear in Cerritos. The Gotcha Girl juniors brand has
been licensed to Jerry Leigh Inc. of Van Nuys. Gotcha Girl for
younger girls has been licensed to Mamiye Brothers Inc. of New York.</TE>
<TE>   The company has not yet struck licensing agreements for its
GirlStar and MCD brands.</TE>

<HD>Citigroup Is Likely to Receive New Subpoena</HD>
<DH>Probe: Investigators want more information about IPO
allocations to WorldCom executives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Congressional investigators are expected to send a new subpoena to
Citigroup Inc. asking for more information about hot stock offerings
the bank's Salomon Smith Barney brokerage allocated to WorldCom Inc.
executives, sources said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, House staff released a document showing that former
Salomon telecom analyst Jack Grubman in 1999 expensed air fare for a
trip that partly involved his attendance at the wedding of Bernard J.
Ebbers, former chief executive of WorldCom. The cost was borne by
Salomon's investment banking arm.</LD>
<LD>   A new subpoena by the House Financial Services Committee would
need the approval of Rep. Michael G. Oxley, (R-Ohio), the committee
chairman, but it is expected that the order would be sent in the next
few days.</LD>
<TE>   "We're evaluating all the information we have from Citigroup and
determining whether another subpoena would be necessary," said Peggy
Peterson, a committee spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John J. LaFalce, (D-N.Y.), the ranking Democrat on the
committee, is "concurring with the need for a second subpoena," said
Jennifer Gore, a spokeswoman for LaFalce. Because Congress is in
recess until next week, LaFalce would have to sign off on new
subpoena requests in the interim.</TE>
<TE>   The committee is investigating whether Salomon Smith Barney
distributed sought-after shares of initial public stock offerings to
WorldCom officials in recent years, including Ebbers, to win
investment banking business.</TE>
<TE>   Securities rules bar brokerages from explicitly rewarding
executives who bring in banking business. Citigroup and Salomon have
denied wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The new subpoena would seek specific dates WorldCom officials
acquired IPO shares, when and for how much the shares were sold, and
who bought them, Gore said.</TE>
<TE>   Documents gathered in an initial subpoena and released this week
showed that Salomon granted almost 900,000 shares of various IPOs to
Ebbers from 1996 to 2000. But the documents didn't show how much
profit Ebbers made.</TE>
<TE>   "The committee's new subpoena seeks information they failed to
request in their original subpoena, and we were unable to provide it
because of privacy laws," Salomon said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also have been probing the role of Salomon's Grubman
in touting telecom stocks, including WorldCom, that subsequently
collapsed. Grubman's relationship with Salomon's investment banking
department also has been under scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the House committee released a Salomon expense report
that illustrated the personal tie between Grubman and Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   The April 1999 expense form showed Grubman listed a $1,111.88
expense for a first-class plane ticket for "Bernie Ebbers' wedding
and meetings" the prior month.</TE>
<TE>   It is unusual on Wall Street for brokerage analysts to have close
personal relationships with executives whose companies the analysts
are expected to objectively rate.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman, who resigned from Salomon this month, has denied any
wrongdoing. His attorney could not be reached Thursday for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Salomon said, "Mr. Grubman has already testified
about his attendance at this event." As for the charging of the
expense to investment banking, the firm said, "The costs of the
research department are borne by three profit centers: investment
banking, retail and equities. In this instance, the expense was
charged to the bank."</TE>

<HD>Insider Trade Rules May Help Investors</HD>
<DH>Money: Faster disclosure may give timely data. Reports are
available on Web.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New rules that greatly speed disclosure of company stock purchases
and sales by corporate insiders should give an added edge to
investors who use the information to help them gauge a company's
prospects, industry experts said.</LD>
<LD>   The rules, which went into effect Thursday, require firms to
report trades of company stock by officers, directors and majority
shareholders within two days. That is a vast improvement over past
rules, which allowed companies at least 10 days--and sometimes more
than a year--to reveal whether their top officers were buying or
selling their stock.</LD>
<LD>   Company insiders are barred from trading shares when they are
privy to significant information that is not public, such as a
pending merger agreement or knowledge that the company is under
investigation for wrongdoing, Securities and Exchange Commission
spokesman John Nester said. Tracking the illegal form of insider
trading is the main reason the SEC has always collected this data.</LD>
<TE>   However, a large segment of institutional and individual investors
also watch insider trades, considering them a sign of how a
company--and its stock--may perform in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "A prudent investor should consider executive trades as a piece of
a complex puzzle that will help them determine a company's
prospects," Nester said.</TE>
<TE>   The reason is fairly obvious. Because corporate insiders are
immersed in information about the focus, direction and day-to-day
operations of their companies, they are among the savviest of all
investors, said Norman G. Fosback, editor of the Fosback Funds
Forecaster.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, many investors consider certain types of insider
buying to be a signal to jump into a stock, whereas insider selling
could be a warning that something is amiss.</TE>
<TE>   "They are closer to the fundamentals than anybody else," said Ron
Ognar, a portfolio manager for Strong Funds in Milwaukee. "If I saw a
number of insiders buying, that would mean something."</TE>
<TE>   Requiring companies to file information on insider transactions
more quickly will enable investors to use the data while it is still
timely. For instance, former Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay sold
$70 million in company stock last year while the energy trading firm
slid into bankruptcy. Those trades were not made public until
February.</TE>
<TE>   In general, experts say, insider buying is far more telling than
insider selling. Why? Insiders sell stock for a variety of innocuous
reasons. Executives often get stock through company benefit plans,
such as employee stock-ownership plans, stock options and restricted
share awards. That stock is considered a portion of their pay, and
they may need to sell it to finance college for their kids, new
houses or cars.</TE>
<TE>   Then too, when insiders exercise stock options--buying company
shares at a discount to market value--the insider trading reports
often show them selling at the same time, said Ken Janke, chairman of
the National Assn. of Investors Corp. in Madison Heights, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   The reason: They have to sell some shares to come up with the cash
to buy the new shares and pay the taxes on the gain they realized by
buying the stock at a discounted price.</TE>
<TE>   An executive who has built up a big stock position in his own firm
also might need to sell some shares simply to diversify his holdings,
Fosback said.</TE>
<TE>   None of those sales could be considered a bearish signal about the
company's prospects, these experts agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be careful about what you read into the numbers,"
said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer with First Albany Corp.
in New York. "Treat this data gingerly."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, if there is a pattern of insider
selling--particularly if the insiders are shedding the vast majority
of their holdings--investors would be wise to be wary, Ognar said. It
may well be a signal that the company's insiders think the stock
price is high, which would be a good time to lighten holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Most significant of all are so-called open-market transactions in
which executives buy shares with their own cash at going market
prices, just like anyone else, Fosback said. These purchases do not
need to be big to be telling, either.</TE>
<TE>   "The number of shares they buy is usually just a reflection of the
wealth of that insider," he said. "What you are looking for is a
number of insiders coming to the same conclusion that the company is
a buy at the current market price."</TE>
<TE>   How can investors find information on insider transactions?</TE>
<TE>   Companies now must file a Form-4--an SEC disclosure document
showing how many shares were bought or sold, the insider's resulting
holdings and what type of sale or purchase it was--within two days of
the trade. But because many companies still file these forms on
paper, the statements are not posted on the SEC's online investor
database, known as EDGAR.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a variety of stock research services pick up the data and
rapidly pass it to investors through newsletters, e-mail and
disclosures on investment Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC will be requiring electronic filing of this data within
the next several months, making it easy to find at the agency's site,
at www.sec.gov, Nester said.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, investors can find the information at finance.yahoo
.com. Enter the firm's ticker symbol and the site will respond with
stock prices and links for more information. Hit the "insider" link
and it will display a list of recent insider stock transactions.</TE>

<HD>Tiny Tool May Boost Detection of Diseases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists have developed a new tool for detecting infectious disease
that, some experts said, could significantly enhance the containment
of epidemics or the early warning of bioterrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The method, developed by Chad A. Mirkin of Northwestern
University's Institute for Nanotechnology and announced Thursday, is
another step in commercial applications of the growing science of
nanotechnology, which uses tools as small as a few molecules.</LD>
<LD>   The new method, which uses probes more than 700 times thinner than
a human hair, could make it much easier to detect the most minute
traces of infection involving anthrax, smallpox, HIV, AIDS, tularemia
and other microbes, Northwestern researchers said. The method is far
more refined than conventional tools and much less expensive and can
deliver results in a few hours rather than days or weeks, they said.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a very significant breakthrough," said Charles Martin,
director of research at the University of Florida Bio/Nano Interface
center. Martin reviewed the Northwestern researchers' article on the
technology, which appeared in Thursday's edition of Science magazine.
"The science is sound," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, one
of several agencies funding the research, said the science was
promising and could have many applications.</TE>
<TE>   Nanosphere Inc., a Northbrook, Ill., company, has licensed the
technology and said it could be used commercially not only in disease
detection but also in drug development, clinical tests performed in
laboratories and hospitals, and for use by the military.</TE>
<TE>   The technology, Mirkin said, uses probes made of gold particles.
Attached to the particles are individual molecules that provide a
unique signal, or fingerprint, when a light is shone on them. The
molecules can signal the presence of different biological agents,
easily distinguishing the virus that causes smallpox from HIV. Also
attached to the particles are signal strands of DNA designed to
recognize and bind to a target, such as the smallpox or hepatitis A
viruses.</TE>
<TE>   This method, Martin said, allows for simultaneous testing of many
different types of diseases more accurately and quickly. The
difference in refinement of what can be detected, another expert
said, could be compared to the video capability of an old computer,
which could produce only as many as 256 colors, versus a more modern
one capable of 16 million colors.</TE>
<TE>   A Nanosphere machine that is using the technology is the size of a
large bagel toaster. For nonhuman tests not requiring Food and Drug
Administration approval, the company could have products ready to
market by next year, said Vijaya Vasista, who is in charge of the
project for Nanosphere. Diagnostic tests on humans would require FDA
approval, and the company would have to prove its system is superior
to existing ones.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Doumani of the California NanoSystems Institute, a partnership
between UCLA and UC Santa Barbara, said transforming such
sophisticated science into a commercially viable product will be
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Carbon nanotubes, for example, were invented in 1991 and are many
times lighter and stronger than steel, Doumani said.</TE>
<TE>   "But they still can't be produced at a price that makes them
viable," he said.</TE>

<HD>Bertelsmann May Walk Away From Napster Deal</HD>
<DH>Music: If bankruptcy judge doesn't rule on objections on
time, song-swapping service could be liquidated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>An attorney for Bertelsmann told a bankruptcy judge Thursday that the
German publishing giant might walk away from its plan to buy the
technology of Napster Inc. if a dispute over the deal isn't resolved
by next week.</LD>
<LD>   Under former Chief Executive Thomas Middelhoff, Bertelsmann agreed
to pay $9 million to Napster creditors if a deal were consummated by
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Record labels and songwriters filed their opposition to the
transaction this month, saying that Bertelsmann exercised improper
control over Napster when the bargain was struck.</LD>
<TE>   Bankruptcy Judge Peter Walsh was to hear the objections Thursday
afternoon, but rescheduled the hearing for today.</TE>
<TE>   During the scheduling debate, he asked a Bertelsmann lawyer if the
company would agree to honor the offer past the Tuesday deadline if
he couldn't rule before then. The attorney said Bertelsmann would
not, according to Dow Jones.</TE>
<TE>   That marked the clearest indication to date that the dormant
file-swapping service might not survive its Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization. If the judge can't rule on the objections in time,
Napster might be liquidated.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann has declined to comment on its intentions, and a
Napster spokesman declined to comment after the hearing. Attorneys in
the case couldn't be reached.</TE>

<HD>House Committee Might Subpoena Global Chairman</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Panel wants to ask Gary Winnick about allegations
the firm used sham deals to prop up financial results ahead of stock
sales by executives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS and JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A congressional panel Thursday threatened to subpoena Global Crossing
Ltd. Chairman Gary Winnick as part of its investigation into charges
that the telecommunications firm used misleading accounting to prop
up its financial results ahead of major stock sales by Winnick and
others.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators for the House Energy and Commerce Committee have
been trying for weeks to arrange an interview with Winnick, but the
54-year-old executive and his lawyer have insisted on a number of
undisclosed conditions for the meeting, said Ken Johnson, spokesman
for committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.).</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. Winnick has a choice: He can appear voluntarily and meet with
our investigators, or in all likelihood he will be subpoenaed,"
Johnson said.</LD>
<TE>   Gary P. Naftalis, an attorney representing Winnick, said his
client is dealing with the committee "appropriately," and has
cooperated and provided documents to investigators. He declined to
discuss the negotiations with the panel or the possibility of a
subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the committee released several Global Crossing
documents, including a series of internal e-mails and the minutes of
an end-of-quarter board meeting, that appear to show how executives
used sham transactions to bolster revenue and help the ailing
fiber-optic network operator meet Wall Street projections.</TE>
<TE>   Bermuda-based Global Crossing filed for Bankruptcy Court
protection Jan. 28, listing $12 billion in debts and $22 billion in
assets--making it the nation's fourth-largest case at the time. The
company became the subject of investigations by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the FBI shortly after a former employee's
allegations of financial misconduct came to light a few days after
the Chapter 11 filing.</TE>
<TE>   The House commerce committee has been investigating the company
since February, and recently has begun focusing on allegations that
Winnick and other executives hid the company's deteriorating
condition through faulty accounting, then made large stock sales in
May 2001 with inside knowledge of the company's looming financial
troubles.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick, by far the largest Global Crossing shareholder, pocketed
about $124 million on a May 23 sale of nearly 10 million shares.
Board members Lodwrick Cook, Joseph Clayton, Jack Scanlan and
then-President David Walsh sold significant amounts of stock that
month.</TE>
<TE>   Naftalis, Winnick's attorney, rejected any suggestion of insider
trading.</TE>
<TE>   "Gary's stock sale in May of 2001 was done with all legal and
regulatory and corporate approvals," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Gary possessed no inside information which would have prevented
him from making the stock sale, and there's not a shred of evidence
that the sale in May was in any way improper."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators for the commerce committee have been plowing through
boxes of Global Crossing documents, reviewing computer disks of
e-mails and interviewing more than a dozen current and former company
employees.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence "raises suspicions of possible insider trading,"
Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The documents released Thursday show that the company rushed
through a so-called capacity-swap with troubled rival 360Networks
Inc. late on March 30, the last day of the first quarter in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the deal, the two companies exchanged capacity on
their respective networks, with 360Networks buying $150 million worth
of capacity from Global, and Global buying $200 million in capacity
on a 360Networks cable under construction in the Atlantic. Global
Crossing shipped the net amount--$50 million--to 360Networks before
midnight March 30.</TE>
<TE>   Global received no cash in the deal, but accounted for the
transaction in a way that included the $150-million purchase by
360Networks in its figures for "cash revenue" and "adjusted EBITDA,"
or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.</TE>
<TE>   "Global Crossing forked over $50 million in cold hard cash and got
nothing in return but a bloated financial statement," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our whistle-blower told us that this deal was done so the company
could meet its first-quarter numbers."</TE>
<TE>   He declined to name the whistle-blower.</TE>
<TE>   The 360Networks deal was approved late that afternoon at a
telephonic board meeting by Global's executive committee, which
consisted of Winnick, then-Chief Executive Tom Casey and outside
director William Conway Jr. The three directors approved the deal
after a staff presentation on the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said general counsel James Gorton and others objected to
the deal, but Global attorney Ralph Ferrara said "there is no
evidence that Gary Winnick forced this transaction or that Jim Gorton
opposed this transaction or that anyone opposed this transaction."</TE>
<TE>   Ferrara said the deal was legitimate, and the company was getting
capacity in the North Atlantic, where it expected to have a shortage
in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, an e-mail exchange between Gorton and Casey released
by the committee showed that reciprocal deals didn't bring
much-needed cash to the company.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a tacit admission that many of these deals were nothing
more than financial hocus-pocus," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Shiver reported from Washington and Douglass from Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Refinancers See How Low They Can Go</HD>
<DH>Housing: In searching for a bottom rate, some homeowners
are switching loans as quickly as the cost of credit declines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shortly after making his first payment on a refinanced mortgage in
June, John Cammiso learned the cost of credit had just gotten
cheaper. With lending rates trimmed, he acquired a lower-priced loan.
Then in early August, as financing for homes tumbled to record
levels, he found another loan charging even less interest.</LD>
<LD>   "Why pay more than you have to?" said Cammiso, who is changing
mortgages for the third time in three months. "I might as well save
the money."</LD>
<LD>   Cammiso is one of a growing number of homeowners who have redone
their mortgages more than once in the last year. In searching for a
bottom rate, they have played a key role in creating one of the
largest waves of refinancings in U.S. history.</LD>
<TE>   Financing costs have been edging down for almost a year, the
longest period of decline in decades. The long window of opportunity,
contrasting with a few weeks at best in previous cycles before rates
rise, has produced a crop of borrowers who have become known in the
industry as "serial refinancers."</TE>
<TE>   "A number of people have refinanced more than once in a year, and
you see that pattern more as mortgage rates have come down lower than
people expected," said Frank Nothaft, chief economist at Freddie Mac,
a major investor in secondary mortgages.</TE>
<TE>   The trend is far more prevalent in high-priced states such as
California, where even a modest change in mortgage rates might create
a useful savings for borrowers. But switching loans so often does
raises eyebrows, especially in lower-cost areas where the savings
from slight changes in rates may not amount to the daily cost of a
cup of coffee.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people might say, 'Why would anyone do that so often?
They're crazy,' " said Doug Perry, vice president at Countrywide
Credit Inc. in Calabasas. "But these are normal people trying to take
advantage of falling rates, as unique as that behavior may sound."</TE>
<TE>   At Discount Funding Associates Inc., a mortgage company in
Sacramento, the majority of clients refinancing homes have refinanced
at least once before within the last 90 days, said Christopher
Fontenot, the office manager. He has eight borrowers who have taken
the unusual step of ordering their forms to be processed if long-term
rates drop to 6%.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, he said, borrowers seek mortgages that require no
out-of-pocket cash, even though such loans don't command the lowest
interest rates. In some cases consumers end up reducing their
payments as little as $25 a month, about the price of a fancy lunch
in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But when Fontenot asks clients--some of whom live in upscale homes
and earn salaries of more than $100,000 a year--whether they want to
conserve what amounts to pocket change, he said, "the answer usually
is yes."</TE>
<TE>   Fontenot suspects their motivation is probably nothing more than
the satisfaction of squeezing costs to the last dime. "They say, 'I
just want to get that lower rate. I gotta have it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners in previous decades were married to their mortgages
because rates were flat or rising. But since the mid-1980s, as credit
rates fluctuated and consumers grew wiser about money matters,
refinancing became increasingly common.</TE>
<TE>   Besides falling interest rates, analysts said there are several
reasons that about one of 10 households are expected to refinance
their home this year. Housing prices have jumped nationwide to record
highs, giving homeowners more equity that can be tapped for spending.</TE>
<TE>   And the lending process has grown more automated, making credit
risks easier to assess. Such efficiency lowers lenders' costs, making
refinancing rational even with a slight cut in mortgage rates. And
there is far more awareness of rates through aggressive marketing by
lenders and media reports.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely think the propensity to refinance is greater across
the whole population than in the past," said Doug Duncan, chief
economist at the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America, an industry trade
group. If current trends continue through year's end, he said, about
one-third of mortgage debt would have been refinanced since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Figures on how often each household swaps mortgages are not
available. But a computer analysis of trends reveals the rate of
borrowers repaying mortgages early has risen sharply, suggesting a
refinancing surge.</TE>
<TE>   In California, consumers traded in home loans in June from a year
earlier at 34.7%, or about 22% higher than the nation as a whole,
according to LoanPerformance, a San Francisco firm that tracks
mortgage trends.</TE>
<TE>   No one projected the biggest booms for refinancing would occur in
back-to-back years, accounting for more than $2 trillion combined.
But the rush to refinance, while creating stellar profits for the
industry, has stretched to the limit lenders, appraisers and others
involved in the process.</TE>
<TE>   So widespread is demand that even online brokerages are straining
to process paperwork. At Home Loan Center Inc., which opened in
Irvine about six weeks ago, early projections have been blown away.
The company wrote $130 million in mortgages, triple its expectations,
during its first month in business.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything like this," said founder Anthony Hsieh,
whose former lending company was acquired by E-Trade. "It's like
walking into Las Vegas and the slot machines are spitting out coins."</TE>
<TE>   Launched with seven employees, Home Loan has soared to 92
staffers, putting the company far ahead of plans. To attract skilled
workers, Hsieh offered signing bonuses of $7,500.</TE>
<TE>   Lenders say they are seeing two main types of borrowers. Some opt
for shorter-term mortgages, perhaps 15 or 20 years, which raises
mortgage payments but builds equity faster.</TE>
<TE>   Others, like Cammiso, want to reduce monthly charges as much as
possible, which is often achieved with mortgages that remain at fixed
rates for several years and then turn into adjustable-rate loans.
"No-cost" loans, as they are known, have been a primary draw for
borrowers.</TE>
<TE>   Cammiso, who sells metal-finishing parts, tracks borrowing costs
while driving along Southern California freeways planning his next
sales pitch. He spots billboards with digital readouts showing the
latest rates. He listens to lenders boasting on talk radio. The
43-year-old has changed his home loan five times in the last two
years, cutting his monthly payment by about $200 and never paying a
fee.</TE>
<TE>   If he can shave as little as one-eighth of a point from his old
mortgage and put about $30 more a month in his pocket, he's tempted
to lock in the lower rate.</TE>
<TE>   Family members have been stunned by his success, Cammiso said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're surprised you can get that much of a better rate in a
short period of time," he said. "They say, 'Really, you can do that?'

<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BellSouth Corp. cut its 2002 profit forecast for the second time in
as many months, in part because of slowing wireless sales.</LD>
<LD>   BellSouth, the biggest local telephone company in nine
southeastern U.S. states, said it expects profit, excluding some
costs, of $2.06 to $2.13 a share, down from the $2.13 to $2.20
estimated July 22. Before then, it expected to earn as much as $2.43.</LD>
<LD>   The Atlanta-based company blamed the reduction on slowing revenue
and recently announced job cuts at Cingular Wireless, the nation's
second-biggest mobile-phone operator, of which the company is part
owner.</LD>
<TE>   BellSouth shares fell 19 cents to $24.25 on the NYSE, before the

<DL></DL>
<LD>A partnership that includes Tejon Ranch Co. filed initial planning
documents to build an 11,700-acre master-planned community on the
boundary of Los Angeles and Kern counties.</LD>
<LD>   Centennial Founders, which includes Tejon Ranch, Pardee Homes,
Lewis Investment Co. and Standard Pacific Homes, said the proposed
development, one of the largest in Los Angeles County history, would
be built over 25 years and include 23,000 homes and 13 million square
feet of commercial space.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly half the development at the southern end of the Tejon Ranch
near the junction of Interstate 5 and Highway 138 would be preserved
as open space, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   The first homes are scheduled to be occupied by 2007 if the
company wins government approval. The project was first announced two
years ago as a smaller, 4,000-acre residential subdivision.</TE>

<LD>Kilroy Realty Corp. said a former tenant, bankrupt Internet retailer
EToys Inc., is seeking the return of $15 million from two letters of
credit.</LD>
<LD>   EToys, which declared bankruptcy last year, filed a lawsuit
against Kilroy for the return of money drawn on the letters of credit
by Kilroy, the Los Angeles real estate company said.</LD>
<LD>   EToys signed an 11-year, $100-million lease in late 1999 for a
151,000-square-foot building Kilroy developed in West L.A. Kilroy
collected $15 million from EToys in letters of credit when the
company defaulted on its lease in January 2001.</LD>

<HD>United, US Airways Push for Labor Cuts</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>United Airlines is asking its employees to approve cutting labor
costs by $1.5 billion annually for the next six years as part of an
emergency restructuring plan.</LD>
<LD>   The cutbacks, to include pay reductions and the scrapping of
recently negotiated raises, would provide the bulk of $2.5 billion
the struggling carrier has targeted in annual savings to ensure its
recovery.</LD>
<LD>   The unions did not immediately respond.</LD>
<TE>   Without a consensus on cuts, Chief Executive Jack Creighton told
employees this week, the airline might be forced to file for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of United parent company UAL Corp. fell 23 cents to $3.05
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, machinists for US Airways rejected wage and benefit
concessions, while workers who load luggage and freight accepted

correct the glitch immediately. Microsoft is working to improve the
security of its software after holes allowed worms and viruses to
enter Microsoft programs several times in the last two years,
angering customers.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The International Trade Commission dealt another blow to Gemstar-TV
Guide International Inc., affirming an administrative law judge's
ruling against Gemstar in a critical patent case.</LD>
<LD>   The ITC declined to review the judge's finding that three Gemstar
patents covering electronic program guides had not been violated by
EchoStar Communications Corp. and two companies making cable TV
set-top boxes, Scientific-Atlanta Inc. and Pioneer Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Pasadena-based Gemstar, whose management is being shuffled by top
investor News Corp., said it would appeal the ITC's decision to the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the ruling is expected to help EchoStar,
Scientific-Atlanta and Pioneer defend themselves against a patent
infringement lawsuit that Gemstar filed in federal court in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   News of the ITC's decision was released after the markets closed.
Shares of Gemstar closed at $4.22, up 29 cents, or 7%, on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Starbucks Is Looking South</HD>
<DH>Expansion: The giant coffee chain plans to open stores in
Puerto Rico and Mexico, testing the waters in the challenging Latin
American market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico</DL>
<LD>Starbucks Corp. is opening its first chain of stores here next month,
spreading into Latin America, where coffee growing is a matter of
pride and a 50-cent cafe con leche is part of the culture.</LD>
<LD>   But the Seattle-based company is trusting in a blend that has
given it more than $2.6 billion in sales and a foothold in 26
countries--a strong brew, local beans and a cafe atmosphere.</LD>
<LD>   Starbucks plans to charge about the same prices in Puerto Rico and
Mexico--where it also will begin opening stores next month--as it
does in the United States, where a small coffee costs $1.68 and a
large specialty coffee drink runs more than $5.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not sure I'll go there.... I can make coffee at home," said
Carlos Rodriguez, a 48-year-old San Juan attorney. "I just wonder
whether the locals will associate [Starbucks] with typical American
coffee--which is just bad."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Maslen, president of Starbucks Coffee International, said
Thursday that more than 10 stores will open in Puerto Rico, the first
Sept. 7, and 14 in Mexico, one of the world's top 10 coffee
exporters.</TE>
<TE>   The chain plans to offer premium-bean coffee and a "coffee
experience."</TE>
<TE>   "Puerto Ricans have a tremendous passion for coffee, and the
coffee is good," Maslen said. "That makes Puerto Rico a great place
for Starbucks."</TE>
<TE>   The company also is looking at opening sites in Venezuela, Brazil,
Colombia and Costa Rica-- all countries steeped in coffee tradition.
Worldwide, Starbucks operates about 6,500 locations in North America,
Asia and Europe. The firm sells coffee drinks and beans, pastries, as
well as coffee makers, grinders and mugs.</TE>
<TE>   "Bring it on," said Jean Paul Coupal, owner of Venezuela's gourmet
Arabica Coffee Co. franchise, which charges 70 cents for an espresso
with milk.</TE>
<TE>   "In countries where there is a culture of espresso, like
Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina, Starbucks won't have any sort of
success," he said, "There's no room for mediocrity here."</TE>
<TE>   Coffee, the most widely traded commodity after oil, has been a
bedrock of Latin American economies. The $50-billion industry employs
20 million people around the world.</TE>
<TE>   But market prices have fallen to an eight-year low of about 50
cents a pound, forcing small growers to enter partnerships with
larger companies. Starbucks said it pays at least $1.26 a pound for
coffee from growers.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its venture in Puerto Rico and Mexico, Starbucks said
it would buy beans from local growers, but wouldn't say for how much
or from which growers.</TE>

<HD>Another Tech Sector Downer</HD>
<DH>Computer hardware: With sales lagging at Sun and Novellus,
the chances of a second-half recovery fade. 'The outlook is very,
very murky,' one CEO says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hopes for a technology rebound dimmed further Thursday with
lackluster sales forecasts from Sun Microsystems Inc. and Novellus
Systems Inc.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, UBS Warburg cut its 2002 and 2003 projections for the
global semiconductor and chip-equipment industries, saying sluggish
demand for personal computers and telecommunications equipment could
drive down revenue.</LD>
<LD>   UBS expects 2002 chip revenue to fall as much as 2% or rise as
much as 2%.</LD>
<TE>   It previously predicted sales would be unchanged or grow as much
as 5%. It changed its forecast for chip-equipment revenue to a drop
of 20% to 25% from a decline of 15% to 20%.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole concept of a second-half recovery is pretty much dead,"
said Brett Berry, who helps manage $1.2 billion at Bailard, Biehl &amp;
Kaiser Inc. "In the short run, it's not pretty at all."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clara, Calif.-based Sun, which makes servers that run
corporate networks and Web sites, said first-quarter sales would be
little changed from $2.86 billion a year ago, at the low end of
forecasts made last month.</TE>
<TE>   "We've not seen any improvement" in information technology
spending, Chief Financial Officer Steve McGowan said in a conference
call to investors. "Some would say it actually may be worsening."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Sun predicted sales would fall 10% to 15% from the
previous quarter, when it took in $3.4 billion. McGowan said Thursday
that the drop would be near the 15% mark.</TE>
<TE>   Slumping economies worldwide caused Sun's sales to fall 32% in its
fiscal year that ended in July as businesses curbed computer
purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Server sales didn't pick up in August, analysts said, quashing
optimism that demand might rebound this year.</TE>
<TE>   Sun shares fell 13 cents to $3.83 in regular Nasdaq trading, then
fell to $3.75 after hours, following the announcement.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Hewlett-Packard Co. reported a quarterly loss and a
sales decline of 22% in its enterprise systems unit, which makes
server computers and storage devices that compete with Sun's.</TE>
<TE>   HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina said customers were waiting
longer before upgrading equipment, and President Michael Capellas
said a drop in sales of high-end servers helped cause the loss.</TE>
<TE>   The server market is becoming increasingly competitive as
manufacturers vie for fewer sales amid shrinking demand, investors
said.</TE>
<TE>   Novellus Systems, whose equipment builds circuits in
semiconductors, said Thursday that its third-quarter earnings, sales
and orders will be lower than previously forecast because two
customers in Asia delayed purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Novellus will break even in the third quarter on sales of $230
million, compared with an earlier forecast of a profit of 2 cents a
share on sales of $250 million, Chief Executive Richard Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   Makers of chip equipment such as San Jose-based Novellus are
struggling to pull out of a slump that began two years ago, when chip
makers started spending less on new factories because of declining
demand for personal computers and electronics.</TE>
<TE>   "The outlook is very, very murky," Hill said. "Our customers have
seen a slowdown in demand from their customers. As a result, they're
not bringing on excess capacity."</TE>
<TE>   Novellus shares rose 11 cents to $24.29 in regular Nasdaq trading,
then eased to $24 after hours.</TE>
<TE>   This year, investors said they thought demand for chip-making
equipment was starting to recover. In May, Novellus raised its
second-quarter profit forecast, citing improved consumer demand for
electronics. Now chip makers are buying less equipment as that demand
slips, Hill said.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi CEO Plans Meetings in U.S.</HD>
<DH>Media: Fourtou is expected to talk with top executives in
his first stateside visit since taking the helm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal Chief Executive Jean-Rene Fourtou will meet senior
U.S. executives in New York and Burbank next month in advance of a
pivotal board meeting that could determine the fate of Universal's
movie studio, theme parks and music group.</LD>
<LD>   Fourtou is scheduled to meet with Doug Morris, head of Universal
Music Group, Vivendi Universal Entertainment Chairman Barry Diller
and top executives from Universal Studios on Sept. 12 and Sept. 13,
said sources familiar with the matter.</LD>
<LD>   The meetings will mark Fourtou's first visit to the U.S. and his
second meeting with Universal executives since taking over as chief
of Vivendi Universal in a boardroom coup last month.</LD>
<TE>   The high-level meetings come as Vivendi's U.S. executives are said
to be organizing a plan to sell or spin off Vivendi's U.S.
entertainment assets into a separate company that would still be
managed by Diller. Several parties have expressed interest, including
cable mogul John Malone, Viacom Inc. and General Electric Co.'s NBC.</TE>
<TE>   A Vivendi Universal spokeswoman declined to discuss details of
Fourtou's visit.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou appears to be laying the groundwork for a Sept. 25 meeting
at which the company's directors are expected to outline a new
strategy for the struggling French conglomerate, which has been
trying to stave off a cash crisis through a series of asset sales.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi, which recently announced plans to sell Boston-based
publisher Houghton Mifflin, is expected to announce as early as today
that it plans to sell various companies in its French consumer press
division. Also expected are the sale of Vivendi's 50% stake in
Vizzavi, a money-losing Internet portal, to partner Vodafone Group
for about $150 million and the sale of Vivendi's Hungarian phone
business.</TE>
<TE>   Vizzavi was the centerpiece of former CEO Jean-Marie Messier's
failed strategy to pipe Universal movies, music and games through
PCs, mobile phones and hand-held devices.</TE>
<TE>   The sales are part of an effort to raise $9.8 billion over the
next two years to lower the company's $19-billion media-related debt.
Fourtou has been working to negotiate a critical $1.97-billion loan
from creditors. But that process has proved more time-consuming than
anticipated because of the complexity of Vivendi's businesses and
clauses that require Vivendi to renegotiate existing loans before it
can obtain new financing, said sources familiar with the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, France's stock market regulator disclosed Thursday
that the Bronfman family of Canada reduced its stake in Vivendi from
5.6% of the voting rights to 4.9% in May.</TE>
<TE>   The Bronfmans, who were livid at the steep drop in Vivendi's stock
price this year and the company's muddled strategy, led the boardroom
ouster of Messier. They remain the company's largest shareholders.</TE>

<LD>Cathedral doors--A graphic Wednesday in Section A and the
"Surroundings" story Thursday in the California section gave
inconsistent and incorrect information about the weight of the main
doors at the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. The Great
Bronze Doors comprise the doors themselves, which weigh about 7 tons
apiece, plus the crowning tympanum structure and statue of Mary. The
combined weight of the entire piece is about 25 tons. In addition,
the story Wednesday that the graphic accompanied gave misleading
information about the dimensions of the nave's series of tapestries.
They are 20 feet tall.</LD>

<LD>In California, 4.6 million public school students in grades two
through 11 took the Stanford 9 standardized tests this spring--for
the fifth year in a row. All of them were tested in reading, math and
language skills such as grammar and punctuation. Students through
eighth grade also took a spelling test, and students in higher grades
took exams in science and history/social science.</LD>
<TE>   Students also took tests tied to the state's tougher standards in
the same subjects, such as English and language arts.</TE>
<TE>   Readers who want to know how a school in Los Angeles County is
doing can use this cross-section of scores as a gauge. But bear in mind
that these are results for selected grades only, not the entire school.
Scores can vary from grade to grade--and from classroom to classroom--even
at the same school.</TE>
<TE>   Results for all grades, schools and districts are available on the</TE>
<TE>   Internet at http://www.cde.ca.gov.</TE>
<TE>   HOW TO READ THE SCORES:</TE>
<TE>   School Districts</TE>
<TE>   Listed in alphabetical order by grade, with grade 4 for elementary
schools, grade 8 for middle schools and grade 10 for high schools.</TE>
<TE>   Individual Schools</TE>
<TE>   The average score for the district is listed first, followed by
scores for individual schools (listed alphabetically).</TE>
<TE>   Reading 2002</TE>
<TE>   Percentage of students scoring at or above the national average.
A 50 means that half the school's students were at or above the

<LD>In California, 4.6 million public school students in grades two through 11
took the Stanford 9 standardized tests this spring--for the fifth year in
a row. All of them were tested in reading, math and language skills such
as grammar and punctuation. Students through eighth grade also took a
spelling test, and students in higher grades took exams in science and
history/social science.</LD>
<LD>   Students also took tests tied to the state's tougher standards in
the same subjects, such as English and language arts. Readers who want to
know how a school in Los Angeles County is doing can use this
cross-section of scores as a gauge. But bear in mind that
these are results for selected grades only, not the entire school.
Scores can vary from grade to grade--and from classroom to classroom--even
at the same school.</LD>
<LD>   Results for all grades, schools and districts are available on the
Internet at http://www.cde.ca.gov.</LD>
<TE>   HOW TO READ THE SCORES:</TE>

<LD>In California, 4.6 million public school students in grades two through 11
took the Stanford 9 standardized tests this spring--for the fifth year in
a row. All of them were tested in reading, math and language skills such
as grammar and punctuation. Students through eighth grade also took a
spelling test, and students in higher grades took exams in science and
history/social science.</LD>
<LD>   Students also took tests tied to the state's tougher standards in
the same subjects, such as English and language arts. Readers who want to
know how a school in Los Angeles County is doing can use this
cross-section of scores as a gauge. But bear in mind that
these are results for selected grades only, not the entire school.
Scores can vary from grade to grade--and from classroom to classroom--even
at the same school.</LD>
<LD>   Results for all grades, schools and districts are available on the
Internet at http://www.cde.ca.gov.</LD>
<TE>   HOW TO READ THE SCORES:</TE>

<HD>Learning How to Use Results Intelligently</HD>
<DH>Scores statewide mean different things to parents,
students, educators, politicians and whole communities. Many need
help interpreting them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They don't call them "high stakes" tests for nothing.</LD>
<LD>   California's standardized test results will drive some parents to
cheer their children, and others to fret about them. Schools will
gain or lose prestige and money. In extreme cases, administrators may
lose their jobs, and schools their autonomy. The state has the
authority to step in and take them over.</LD>
<LD>   The results will be used by civil rights lawyers to gauge social
justice, by parents to select new neighborhoods, by real estate
agents to adjust home prices and by politicians to trumpet successes.</LD>
<TE>   But perhaps the most important thing the scores will do is arm
parents with pointed questions, said Mary Perry, deputy director of
EdSource, a Palo Alto-based education think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "If scores are down, I want to ask: What is the school doing to
address the problem?" Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the stated purposes of the exams is providing a common
language for parents and educators, engaging families, and empowering
them to be critical of their children's schools, Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes that "common language" requires translation:
Although many people talk about the scores, and use them for their
purposes, few can explain exactly what they mean.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the state's testing program involves a complex, sometimes
confusing, mixture of information.</TE>
<TE>   Although schoolchildren in grades 2 through 11 seem to take one
test each spring, they actually are taking two--sometimes
three--tests simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   Most familiar, perhaps, is the Stanford 9 exam, which allows
parents to compare individual student and school achievement with a
national sample of test takers.</TE>
<TE>   But another group of tests, which measure students' performance
according to objective California academic standards, is becoming
increasingly important. The scores show how well students are
mastering key subjects that the state believes they need to grasp.</TE>
<TE>   A third element is the Spanish Assessment of Basic Education test,
given to a relatively small number of Spanish-speaking students who
have been at their current schools for less than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Compared to the Stanford 9, educators say, the California
standards tests are a more rigorous and precise measure of how well
students and schools are performing in language arts and math, and in
the upper grades, in science and social studies. Students deemed
"proficient"--meaning they have mastered the standards--are believed
to be gaining the skills they will need at a four-year college.</TE>
<TE>   "California's standards are among the most challenging in the
country," said Matt Gandal, executive vice president of Achieve Inc.,
a national education consulting group, which has advised several
states on standards. "They spent a lot of time in California looking
around the world and at other states to find the best standards."</TE>
<TE>   California is one of the few states that developed specific
standards for each grade level well before a federal requirement for
such tests was signed into law in January. As time goes on, scores on
the standards tests will become crucial in determining schools'
official progress, as well as monetary rewards and sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first year that California has reported students'
proficiency levels based on standards exams in math, science and
history. The state began reporting proficiency in language arts last
year.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the tests correspond with what California says students
should know, and the textbooks the state adopted should follow as
well," said Brian Stecher, an education researcher at the Rand Corp.
think tank in Santa Monica. "This brings more coherence to all of the
signals that are being sent to students, to teachers and to parents
about what students should know."</TE>
<TE>   This year, the state Department of Education has tried to simplify
the test results that go to parents.</TE>
<TE>   The standards scores are sorted into five categories: "far below
basic," "below basic," "basic," "proficient" and "advanced."</TE>
<TE>   "Parents just need to get used to a different vocabulary," Stecher
said. "Rather than having numbers that indicate how well their
student has done, they'll have a descriptive phrase and they'll be
able to ask teachers to get some idea whether their children are
making progress."</TE>
<TE>   Educators say the test scores often open an important dialogue
between parents and teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "We start by explaining the whole focus of these tests and that
they are just one measure of assessment," said Principal Angel
Barrett of Plummer Elementary School in North Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "We explain the Open Court reading program. We explain the math
program. And we start looking at the different factors that make up
the composite picture of the child."</TE>
<TE>   Such discussions can clear up misconceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "We get a lot of parents asking what the scores mean," said
Caroline Brumm, director of student program evaluation in the Burbank
Unified School District. "Many people come and their child is in the
60th percentile range [on the Stanford 9] and they are worried that
their kids only answered 60% of the questions right."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, such a score would mean that the child scored better than
or as well as 60% of those who took the test.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most confusing aspects of this year's scores may be
reconciling Stanford 9 scores with the results of standards-based
tests. In many cases, a student, district or school may have improved
performance on the Stanford 9 but still not be proficient according
to the objective state standards. The tests simply measure different
things.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, parent Rodolfo Lara, whose 10-year-old daughter goes
to Wonderland Elementary in Hollywood, said the test results have
reinforced his desire to become involved at her school. A roofer by
trade, Lara had a slow year and spent much of his free time
volunteering in his daughter's class.</TE>
<TE>   "Because I was at her school so much, I could just reexplain
things to her [later] when she got lost," Lara said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that explains why her Stanford 9 results this year went
way up. "I thought she would do better, but wow, I didn't know she
was going to do this much better; it taught me that helping out does
pay off."</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Klivans of Tustin Ranch in Orange County said that her two
daughters' test results were far easier to understand this year and
more meaningful because of the stronger emphasis on California's
standards.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the fact that this year's reference to state standards was
clear and easy to see," she said. "And it was good to see how my
daughters fit into the state standards. That was exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Klivans said her daughters--one a third-grader at Tustin's Ladera
Elementary School, the other a fifth-grader at Peters Canyon
Elementary--did well on tests and surpassed last year's scores.</TE>
<TE>   Klivans added, however, that she was concerned that many children
were feeling pressure to perform well on the tests.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter thought these tests were going to keep her out of
college," Klivans said. "And she was only in fourth grade."</TE>
<TE>   On a larger scale, educators and public officials, from teachers,
to principals, superintendents and state leaders, are also feeling
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the Los Angeles Unified School District removed
several top administrators at four schools, in part because their
student bodies did not meet mandated test-score improvements. Other
districts, including San Diego, Oakland, Boston, Chicago,
Philadelphia and many districts in Texas, have taken similar measures
against principals for low test scores.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles schools Supt. Roy Romer made much of improved Stanford
9 scores in L.A. Unified when the district released them last week,
describing those results as "spectacular evidence of growth" during a
crowded news conference that was attended by Gov. Gray Davis. Romer
held no news conference to announce the California standards test
results, which showed Los Angeles trailing the rest of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has staked his political career on better test scores,
saying he would not run for reelection if they did not improve during
his watch.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new federal No Child Left Behind law, states must ensure
that all schools perform at a proficient level--according to their
state's standards--within 12 years or they could lose federal funds
for poor children.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Rosenbaum, legal director of the American Civil Liberties
Union, said he will parse the scores for more proof that the state is
"not providing enough resources to underperforming schools."</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU is in the midst of a 2-year-old lawsuit seeking to force
the state to ensure "minimal educational standards" for California
students.</TE>
<TE>   And Jeanne St. Clair, the president of Pacific West Assn. of
Realtors, said that she and most of her colleagues will be using the
scores to market homes.</TE>
<TE>   "School test scores, in general, do affect the real estate
market," St. Clair said. "People want to be in an area where the
scores are high."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how much rests on the test scores, educators say
parents should be aware that the scores are only one way to evaluate
academic performance. EdSource's Perry said the test is just a
snapshot in time.</TE>
<TE>   "The child could just be a bad test taker, or she could have had
the flu, or their dog could have died that morning," she said. "It is
just one piece of information."</TE>
<TE>   Rand's Stecher said the test overlooks many of the most important
aspects of a school.</TE>
<TE>   "Music and arts programs, and science in the elementary grades,
are not even tested," Stecher said.</TE>
<TE>   "The social and psychological benefits of a school, how well a
school is teaching kids to care about learning and to work
together--these things don't show up in test scores."</TE>

<HD>Urban War, the Right Way</HD>
<DH>Baghdad Needn't Be Another Mogadishu. American Troops Are
Up to the Task--but Is the Public?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK BOWDEN</AU>
<BD>Mark Bowden is the author of "Black Hawk Down"
(Atlantic Monthly Press, 1999) and "Killing Pablo" (Atlantic Monthly
Press, 2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reports that Saddam Hussein is hoping to lure invading U.S. armies
into protracted street battles in Baghdad have prompted visions of
American soldiers caught in a nightmarish 360-degree urban
battlefield--"Black Hawk Down" redux.</LD>
<LD>   Given that his military is estimated to be only one-third as
strong as the one routed by allied armies 11 years ago, Hussein's
best hope against an invading American force would be to exact enough
casualties to wear down support for the effort in the U.S. or
frighten off support for such an invasion before it began.</LD>
<LD>   Toward that end, the nightmare of the 1993 battle of Mogadishu,
Somalia's capital, depicted in the book and movie "Black Hawk Down"
might help convince Americans and their lawmakers that the cost of
going to war against Iraq would be too high. But, in fact, the kind
of urban fighting that members of Task Force Ranger faced in 1993
would little resemble such fighting in Baghdad.</LD>
<TE>   The mission in Mogadishu was a limited, light-infantry assault, a
lightning raid meant to capture unharmed several lieutenants of
Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid. The whole purpose was to get
into the city and get out quickly. The mission turned into protracted
street fighting only when Somalis were able to down two Black Hawk
helicopters, forcing the soldiers on the ground to stay and rescue
the chopper crews.</TE>
<TE>   An assault on Baghdad would come with heavy force and would be
designed to defeat an entrenched enemy. It would involve a large
contingent of foot soldiers supported by armor and precision air
support. Task Force Ranger fought without the aid of tanks or AC-130
Spectre gunships because the Clinton administration had declined to
authorize these weapons. The full force of the U.S. conventional
arsenal would back any move on Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers, Delta Force, SEALs and Air Force commandos trapped in
Mogadishu numbered only about 160 men. Any force employed to attack
Baghdad would be many times larger and linked with ready replacements
and reinforcement. The most valuable armored tool in such an assault
would probably not be a tank but a bulldozer.</TE>
<TE>   When the Israelis attacked Jenin earlier this year in an effort to
root out Palestinian militants, their most effective weapon was a
bulldozer. It proved virtually impervious to mines and booby traps
and simply crushed any resistance in its path. It cleared pathways
through obstacles, walls and heavily congested, hotly contested areas
and knocked down structures that housed enemy combatants.</TE>
<TE>   Task Force Ranger conducted its raid in Mogadishu at midafternoon
because it had pinpointed its targets and had to move quickly. Any
assault on Baghdad would almost certainly take place at night after
severing electric lines, giving advancing American forces with their
night-seeing devices a huge technological advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Air support can keep enemy forces off rooftops, and sewer systems
can be collapsed or flooded. Sniper suppression would involve taking
and holding key observation towers and rooftops in the city and
counting on the superior skills and equipment of U.S. personnel.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israelis have shown that you can conduct urban assaults,
moving in city streets, without taking massive casualties," said Mac
Dorsey, a retired U.S. Army colonel and former chief of staff for the
Army's Special Operations Command. "The Army and the Marines took
literally thousands of towns and cities in World War II. In Vietnam,
we fought urban battles very effectively, and not by walking down the
street and throwing hand grenades in every window, as some later have
suggested. We found the most successful tactic was simply to move
down the street until we took fire, and then responding swiftly to
the source of that fire. If your opponent is very determined, urban
fighting becomes extremely difficult, but even then it is not
impossible. In Saddam's case, there's a great deal of doubt about how
determined such fighting would be."</TE>
<TE>   It is worth noting that even though it lost 18 men, the relatively
small force of lightly armed soldiers who fought in Mogadishu, with
the help of helicopters, successfully completed its mission and
killed an estimated 500 to 1,000 Somalis.</TE>
<TE>   An all-out urban assault would probably be much more of a
mismatch. Nevertheless, fighting it out with Hussein on the streets
of Baghdad would exact a terrible cost.</TE>
<TE>   Rosy pre-battle scenarios rarely prove true. The Russians are
estimated to have lost 200 tanks assaulting Grozny in Chechnya in
1994, a battle that left an estimated 100,000 dead. It is always
possible that the Iraqi military will refuse to fight for Hussein,
but this is wishful thinking. A foreign army will be invading their
capital city. It is far more likely that they will fight, and
tenaciously. Hussein will employ whatever weapons he can to kill the
Americans, and he may find ways of killing civilians in Israel,
neighboring countries and possibly in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Before going to war, a nation should always consider the worst. An
all-out attack on Iraq will entail a level of risk and sacrifice that
the U.S. has not assumed since Vietnam. But the question of war is
not just an exercise in cost-benefit analysis. It's about doing the
right thing. It's important to go down such a road with eyes open,
firm conviction and a steady hand.</TE>

<HD>A Bush Family Face-Off on Saudi Arabia</HD>
<DH>President and father seem to be at odds on princes' role
and the need for a war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWARD N. LUTTWAK</AU>
<BD>Edward N. Luttwak is a senior fellow at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sharp quarrel between the two Bushes over the wisdom of attacking
Saddam Hussein is much more than just a disagreement over policy for
the Middle East. It reflects radically divergent concepts of strategy
and energy economics. There is even a basic difference in cultural
values. But the real fork in the road for the two Bushes is that,
when it comes to the subject of Iraq, their disagreement is really
about Saudi Arabia.</LD>
<LD>   Former President George Bush and his compatriots not only consider
the Saudi ruling family one of the most important allies of the U.S.,
but they actually have a Saudi-centered view of the Middle East.
Therefore they vehemently oppose a war to remove Hussein because
their sources, chiefly Prince Bandar ibn Sultan, longtime Saudi
ambassador to Washington, tell them that the de facto ruler, Crown
Prince Abdullah, and other prudent members of the family are
terrified of the Arab and Muslim reaction if bombs start falling on
Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   The Saudis have a point. Having indoctrinated their population in
the strictest variety of Islamic fundamentalism, one that prohibits
any form of amity with Christians or Jews (pagans must convert or
die), they are of course bitterly criticized for relying on the
protection of the "Christian" U.S., which supports Israel--a.k.a. the
Jews--and which just recently defeated the impeccably fundamentalist
Taliban of Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   Hussein was never religious and certainly is no fundamentalist,
but in recent years he has stressed his Islamic identity more and
more. His speeches are now filled with invocations to Allah and
quotes from the Koran.</TE>
<TE>   If the U.S. now attacks him--almost certainly with the help of
non-Arab Kurdish and Turkoman militias--both Arab and Muslim fury
will be aroused against the Americans and, by extension, the
American-protected Saudi family.</TE>
<TE>   While the foreign minister and other top princes keep saying that
Saudi Arabia will not allow its territory or bases to be used for any
American war against Hussein, that only slightly limits the damage.
Besides, their enemies simply do not believe the Saudis, and with
good reason: It is just not credible that U.S. forces and logistic
support on Saudi bases would remain passive amid the exigencies of
war.</TE>
<TE>   There is worse. Any U.S. war against Hussein would be fought under
the banner of democracy. Both U.S. officials and Iraqi exiled leaders
already have declared that their aim is to replace Hussein's
dictatorship with a democratic and federal parliamentary republic.
That frightens the Saudis--who operate a family dictatorship without
even the facade of a popular assembly--and makes Bush senior and his
colleagues very uncomfortable. As Americans, they cannot speak out
against democracy, but in the 1991 Gulf War, at Saudi insistence,
they refused to allow any mention of it in the propaganda beamed to
Iraq. The crowd around Bush senior still fears that democracy is a
threat in the Middle East because it would allow fundamentalists to
come to power; "better the princes we know" is their slogan.</TE>
<TE>   Why is Saudi Arabia so valuable an ally in the eyes of Bush senior
and his men? For them the answer is too obvious to be worth
discussing: oil--or more precisely the unique ability of Saudi Arabia
to pump extra oil when the price rises too much, thus safeguarding
the world economy from another round of inflation. Almost as valuable
is the Saudi ability to cut back production to drive up prices when
they fall too much, endangering the economic stability of all
countries that rely primarily on oil exports. Oil is produced in many
countries these days, but only the Saudis control the price of oil,
and therefore of energy worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   President George W. Bush and his closest advisors see the cheap
oil of Arabia as the greatest disincentive to the development of
alternative sources of energy, including new oil outside the Middle
East--in Alaska, for example. Instead of valuing the Saudi policy of
keeping oil below $30 per barrel, they see it as a frustrating
obstacle to any rational energy policy. And, of course, it reduces
the earnings of Texan and other domestic oil producers.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, Bush junior and his camp have received an entire
education in how Saudi oil revenue is spent: in part for the
profligate luxuries of more than 5,000 princes with their large
families and in part to operate Islamic centers and madrasas (Islamic
schools) around the world that propagate the most extreme
fundamentalism--the creed of Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Bush senior and friends are not much concerned with religion and
still think it perfectly natural for the Saudis to promote their
creed, whatever it is. Bush junior is a devoted Christian by all
accounts, does pay attention to religious matters and is therefore
very conscious of the wide gap between the fanatical, hate-filled
fundamentalism that the Saudis have been exporting and the milder
doctrines of traditional Islam that it is displacing with disastrous
results.</TE>
<TE>   Even the princely luxuries are far from harmless. While the
invalid King Fahd flies around with more than 300 servants, his own
cars, food and water, and other lesser princes have immense villas
with solid-gold doorknobs and such (one has his own fire brigade),
Saudi Arabia is becoming an increasingly poor country. Unemployment
is more than 20%, and there is a growing problem of outright
deprivation, even hunger. That is the greatest threat to the
political equilibrium of the country and of Arabia as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   Bush senior's camp views the Saudi ruling family as the key to
stability, but his son's followers increasingly disagree. They are
not eager to see the Saudis overthrown, but they now believe that the
Saudis' blind greed and overt profligacy are undermining their rule
and that, in any case, U.S. policies should not be inhibited by Saudi
needs.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, there is a difference in strategic concepts. Bush
senior and his followers compare the certain costs, high risks and
uncertain benefits of a war against Hussein to conclude that it
should not be fought, especially because it risks a Saudi collapse.
In business terms, they see war as a losing proposition.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Bush junior and cohorts are not planning a war
against Hussein in the hope of achieving any positive gains but
rather to avoid the catastrophic losses of another Sept. 11. They are
convinced that Hussein has refused to allow U.N. inspectors--and paid
the huge price of years of United Nations' sanctions--to accumulate
biological, chemical and radiological weapons because he wants to use
them.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence profiles show that Hussein's driving motivation is
revenge, and while he has a long list of other enemies he would like
to obliterate, the Americans are at the top. The Kuwaitis and Saudis,
by the way, easily outrank the Israelis on that list. Because Bush
junior is now convinced that Hussein will attack one day unless he is
attacked first, he sees only danger and no compelling advantage in
waiting.</TE>
<TE>   Having presided impotently over the Sept. 11 catastrophe, he is
determined to avoid a repetition--at all costs, including the
survival of the Saudi regime that his father views so highly.</TE>
<TE>   There is also the cultural factor. By all appearances, Bush senior
positively enjoys spending time with the graciously hospitable, if
not too bright, Bandar, as well as other Saudi princes. Brent
Scowcroft, who was national security advisor to the elder Bush, is a
devotee of high-altitude hiking in the costly elegance of Aspen,
where Bandar owns an immense parody of a Swiss chalet. And Bandar is
generous: He gives out Rolex watches as tips (he once embarrassed the
staff of CNN's "Crossfire" by passing them by the handful to junior
aides and camera crews). One assumes that Saudi generosity toward
political consultants, such as the highly respected Scowcroft
Associates, is of greater dimensions than a mere handful of $5,000
Rolex watches.</TE>
<TE>   Bush junior, by contrast, does not go to Aspen. He seems immune to
its stylish attractions, preferring the plain comforts of his
far-from-luxurious Crawford ranch. To be sure, Bandar has been there,
but not as often as Israeli visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Some, inevitably, prefer to see the Iraq dispute between father
and son in terms of rival conspiracies: international industrialists
and the oil interests on one side, the Zionists on the other. There
may be something to that, but not much. The most bitter and
influential opponents of the Saudis in the U.S. are not Jews or
Zionists but rather the many U.S. military officers and diplomats who
have served in Saudi Arabia and who despise the princes and abhor the
fanaticism they propagate.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, as far as President Bush is concerned, the debate is
over.</TE>
<TE>   He has heard his father and knows the views of his father's former
officials. He has made his decision: Saddam Hussein must go, even if
the Saudis go down with him.</TE>

<HD>Money Shouts Amid Chaos</HD>
<DH>Sacramento lobbyists are in gear at frenzied end of
legislative session.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of corporate lobbyists prowl the marble halls of the state
Capitol in Sacramento in these last days of the legislative session,
doing their work behind the screen of last-minute chaos. The Senate
and Assembly toil into the night to hastily dispose of hundreds of
bills before midnight Saturday, when everything that's not passed
expires. All but the budget bill, still deadlocked two full months
into the new fiscal year.</LD>
<LD>   Deep-pocketed special interests, particularly banks and insurance
companies this time around, are using their influence and campaign
contributions to kill bills they don't like and squeeze through those
that boost their power or profits. Bills killed in one place, perhaps
months ago, suddenly reemerge somewhere else.</LD>
<LD>   One is SB 689, by Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda), which benefits an
insurance company, Mercury Insurance Group, that has contributed
generously to members of both houses in the last two year; its gifts
include $174,000 to Thomas Calderon (D-Montebello), chairman of the
Assembly Insurance Committee. The bill would thwart a move by the
insurance commissioner to outlaw certain discounts because they
reward existing policyholders and result in higher premiums for those
who don't yet have insurance.</LD>
<TE>   The Times' Virginia Ellis reported Thursday that the once-defeated
measure enjoyed a sudden revival after it was amended into a Perata
bill dealing with prostate cancer. The measure then won approval in
the Assembly Insurance Committee, 14 to 2, with all the yes votes
cast by members who got contributions from Mercury, according to
consumer advocates. Lawmakers should bury this bill again, for good.</TE>
<TE>   Banks and other financial institutions declared war on a modest
proposal to protect the privacy of personal financial information,
one of the major consumer protection bills of the session. Common
Cause reported Thursday that the foes had spent more than $5 million
against SB 773, by Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough), which was
barely clinging to life.</TE>
<TE>   The electronics industry had its own target, AB 2297, by Silicon
Valley Assemblyman Joe Simitian (D-Palo Alto), legislation that would
require Internet businesses to post their policies regarding the sale
of customers' personal financial and identification information to
other companies, usually for marketing purposes. There appears to be
no room for the consumer--or the ordinary voter--at the lobbyists'
end-of-session feast.</TE>
<TE>   A worthy consumer-interest measure of a different sort is Sen. Jim
Costa's (D-Fresno) SB 1856, a $9-billion bond issue proposed for the
November 2004 election to build a high-speed rail system in
California, with the backbone line linking Los Angeles and San
Francisco. This is one of the more visionary measures to come before
the Legislature in years. Lawmakers should pass SB 1856, which would
put the bond measure on a ballot so voters could decide the matter.</TE>

<LD>As the world debates whether to topple Iraq's Saddam Hussein and, at
the environmental summit in Johannesburg, how to lift the poorest
nations, it should not forget the immense risks and needs in
Afghanistan. The United States is living up to its promise of aiding
the Kabul government, but too many nations are not.</LD>
<LD>   Years of drought and war destroyed great stretches of agricultural
land in a country that once produced abundant fruits and grains. The
one crop that has come back in near- record proportions this year is
the opium poppy, a harvest that enriches criminals and gives local
warlords even more reason to resist the interim Kabul government of
President Hamid Karzai. More money isn't the only key to establishing
a more normal economy and a stable government, but without it there's
not much hope.</LD>
<LD>   The United Nations expected about 400,000 Afghans to return to
their homeland this year once the Taliban was ousted and Al Qaeda's
grip was broken. More than three times that number rushed back.
Refugees once received 550 pounds of wheat upon return; that was cut
to 220 pounds. World Food Program officials now worry they may have
to trim the allotment to 110 pounds per family. The U.N. food
officials say they requested $285 million this year and are short
about $70 million promised by nations at a Tokyo conference last
winter but not yet paid.</LD>
<TE>   The shortfall in humanitarian aid from European and Middle Eastern
nations is twinned with a lack of infrastructure. Schools and
hospitals remain unbuilt and wells undug. The most basic need of
life, clean water, is available only to about 20% of the Afghan
people.</TE>
<TE>   The refusal of the U.N. Security Council to dispatch peacekeepers
outside the capital has made aid organizations wary of doing needed
work in the countryside. But constructing roads and schools in rural
areas would provide work for people now dependent on warlords and
opium for money.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and a number of U.S. senators
have recommended expanding the peacekeeping force; Washington should
take the lead in urging allies to provide troops and money for that
purpose. After the Soviets withdrew in 1989 following a decade of
war, fighting among Afghan warlords caused more havoc. It is likely
to take more than a year to get an Afghan army functioning. During
that time, warlords will further entrench themselves, increasing the
risk of renewed civil war once troops leave. The last Afghan civil
war set the stage for the Taliban to impose its own form of order.</TE>
<TE>   The fragile Karzai government would gain strength from
demonstrating that it can win money to feed and house refugees and
create jobs. Washington has paid its promised share and others should
pay up. It's that or another devil-breeding round of chaos across
Afghanistan.</TE>

<HD>Hard Choices for the Court</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Keeping the gargantuan Los Angeles Superior Court afloat is like
trying to keep water in a leaky bucket. No sooner do you plug one
hole then water spurts from another. The state's budget woes, which
could leave the court $57 million short, could open a real gusher.</LD>
<LD>   The largest trial court in California has 613 judges,
commissioners and referees, along with 5,800 clerks, bailiffs,
interpreters and other employees who staff courtrooms from Long Beach
to Lancaster. Since the mid-1990s, nearly all of the court's
$600-million annual budget has come from the state, although the
county is responsible for maintaining the courthouses.</LD>
<LD>   But now, with state tax revenues tanking, the court, along with
other state-funded agencies, is taking a big hit that could undo much
of the hard work of local court officials to better serve the public.</LD>
<TE>   For example, the Superior Court this summer finally replaced the
old 10-day term of jury service with a countywide requirement that
jurors serve just one day unless they are assigned to a trial.</TE>
<TE>   That shift has required the court to retool its computerized
summons process and tap additional staff.</TE>
<TE>   As a shortage of judges grew worse, the court's leaders lobbied
Gov. Gray Davis to fill vacancies, and he has appointed several new
judges.</TE>
<TE>   Another worthy innovation is specialized courtrooms in Los Angeles
that address the issues of mentally ill teenagers, domestic abusers,
drug offenders and the homeless. All are designed to coordinate legal
and social services for individuals whose drug addictions or mental
problems leave them on the street or in police lockups. The state
budget crunch could threaten these innovative efforts, adding to the
burden for county law enforcement agencies and increasing caseloads
for welfare and mental health care workers.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping these specialized courts in place is surely preferable to
recycling folks back into jail. And undoing the one-day, one-trial
system is unthinkable to potential jurors. Court supervisors have
hard choices to make and shouldn't automatically eliminate the newest
programs first.</TE>

<HD>Vast Influx of Returning Refugees Worsens Afghanistan's
Health Crisis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL and JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Health officials here warned Thursday that the rising tide of
returning refugees poses significant health risks for a country
already suffering one of the highest rates of infant and maternal
mortality in the world.</LD>
<LD>   The influx of Afghans returning from Pakistan, Iran and other
countries has severely burdened a health system taxed by war, drought
and food shortages, said Dr. Abdullah Fahim, spokesman for the Health
Ministry.</LD>
<LD>   Since March, an estimated 1.5 million Afghans have returned in
what refugee officials have characterized as one of the fastest
repatriations on record--and at three times the rate initially
expected. About one-third, or 500,000, have come to Kabul, swelling
the capital's population by about 25%.</LD>
<TE>   Cholera is of special concern in urban areas, where there are
shortages of safe drinking water and proper sanitation systems.
Although isolated cases of the disease have been reported in recent
weeks, Fahim said there has been "no massive outbreak." Nevertheless,
some hospitals have taken to isolating patients with severe diarrhea
in order to prevent an epidemic, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly vulnerable to health problems are newborns and their
mothers, who already suffer mortality rates second only to those in
the war-torn African nation of Sierra Leone. One in four Afghan
children dies before reaching age 5, while one in 57 women who give
birth dies during labor, according to a 1997 survey, the most recent.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations, in cooperation with the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the Afghan Health Ministry, is
updating the infant and maternal mortality survey. Fahim expects it
will show that rates have risen since 1997 because restrictions
imposed by the strict Islamic Taliban regime put women at greater
risk.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Fahima Sekandari, director of Malalai Hospital in Kabul, noted
that the Taliban government restricted the movement of women and
prohibited them from seeing male doctors for their obstetric and
gynecological needs. As a consequence, more women and infants died
from lack of adequate care. The Taliban was overthrown by U.S.-led
forces last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Every half-hour an Afghan woman dies giving birth," said
Sekandari, who said her facility is the nation's only maternity
clinic. "For the last five years, the world progressed and we were
left behind."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Gulestani Parvin, anesthesiologist at the hospital, said, "The
conditions resulting from the Taliban sabotaged women's health."</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's health problems are worsened by shortages of food.
In Washington, U.S. aid officials warned Thursday that the country
will face a hungry winter unless international food deliveries are
stepped up.</TE>
<TE>   A State Department official also chastised the European Union for
failing to deliver money fast enough after promising to help
Afghanistan. An EU spokesman in Washington said the criticism was
unwarranted.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the slow arrival of food aid has forced the United
Nations to reduce by a third the amount of wheat given in "welcome
home" packages it has been handing out to returning refugees, said
Arthur E. "Gene" Dewey, assistant secretary of State for the Bureau
of Population, Refugees and Migration."That's cutting into the bone,"
he said. "That's not cutting any fat."</TE>
<TE>   An EU spokesman in Washington, Wilfried Schneider, said the EU has
pledged $200 million to the aid effort and has delivered $115
million. It is also funding nongovernmental organizations, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The strain from the flood of refugees is evident in Afghanistan's
cities, as garbage accumulates on streets. Open sewers flow past the
doors of dwellings, even at the entrance of one hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Only 20% of Kabul's residents have piped-in water; the rest get
their supply at public pumps or wells, many of which are
contaminated.</TE>
<TE>   Fahim, the Health Ministry spokesman, said the deterioration of
Afghanistan's roads, the destruction of clinics and hospitals and the
flight of doctors and nurses escaping war and repression all
contributed to the degradation of the health system.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, children in a major Kabul pediatric hospital are
crowded three to a bed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 7,000 doctors to treat a population of 28 million,
but they are concentrated in a few urban areas. Vast rural stretches
are without any effective medical care.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the nation suffers a serious shortage of nurses and
midwives. In most countries, an adequate ratio of nurses and midwives
to doctors is considered four to one, Fahim said, while in
Afghanistan there is barely one nurse or midwife to each doctor.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line: While 99% of North American women receive
professional assistance during childbirth, only 10% of Afghan women
do, said Shairose Mawji, a U.N. project officer here who is helping
direct the new survey.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's electrical shortages and four-year drought are
contributing to sanitation problems. Mountain reservoirs that power
Kabul's three hydroelectric plants are at dangerously low levels,
forcing the Power and Water Ministry to cut off electricity for 12
hours a day to all but a few vital installations.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of electricity causes water service to stop because there
is no energy for the pumping stations. The lack of pressure allows
seepage into the war-damaged pipes, letting in contaminants.</TE>

<LD>Indonesia's high court has cleared the country's central bank
governor of corruption, overturning a three-year prison term handed
down earlier this year, a court official said. Sjahril Sabirin, who
has maintained he is innocent, was not immediately available for
comment. He had continued in his post.</LD>
<LD>   The $80 million in central bank funds at issue were supposed to
temporarily prop up Bank Bali. But prosecutors said the money was
instead illegally siphoned off to finance former President B.J.
Habibie's 1999 election campaign. Habibie was later forced to drop
out of the presidential race.</LD>

<HD>Final Drama for Diva Maria Felix Unfolds in Mexico</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>When Maria Felix died in April on her 88th birthday, she left a
legacy of 50 screen portrayals of beautiful, tempestuous women that
made her for decades the reigning goddess of Spanish-language cinema.</LD>
<LD>   The Mexican film star also left a will that cut all surviving
relatives out of her fortune, raised a brother's suspicions about the
cause of her death and led to her being cast, in a final captivating
performance Thursday, in the role of an exhumed corpse.</LD>
<LD>   As riot police kept camera crews and curious fans at bay,
authorities closed Mexico City's elite French Cemetery and dug up
Felix's remains for an autopsy to determine whether the actress might
have been poisoned. Results were promised in about a week.</LD>
<TE>   The story led television newscasts, bringing the scene live and in
color to millions of viewers, punctuated by black-and-white film
clips of the raven-haired bombshell in her prime. Black plastic
sheets hid her body from TV cameras in helicopters overhead.</TE>
<TE>   Mexicans are not squeamish about the dead. They picnic on the
graves of their loved ones each November on the Day of the Dead and
decorate their homes with grinning skeleton figures that mock death.
But Thursday's exhumation drew so much attention that Mexico City
Atty. Gen. Bernardo Batiz, who supervised it, felt obliged to warn
reporters and fans against making the event "a grotesque spectacle."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tragicomic soap opera. Call it 'The Diva Beyond the
Grave,' " said Homero Aridjis, the renowned Mexican poet who grew up
enchanted by the movie queen immortalized in song as Maria la Bonita
(Maria the beautiful). "Maria the beautiful has become Maria the
macabre."</TE>
<TE>   Felix, a fiercely independent woman who was married four times,
dominated the headlines here when she died in her sleep of a reported
heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   A doctor's certificate attributed her death to natural causes.
President Vicente Fox eulogized the actress as her body lay in state
at Mexico City's Palace of Fine Arts before burial under a marble
slab that reads, "Here sleeps the most beautiful woman in the world."</TE>
<TE>   But that was not her last scene.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, her will became public. Her estate was left to
three men: Luis Martinez de Anda, her 27-year-old personal assistant;
Antoine Tzapoff, her French former lover; and Javier Tellez, who was
the personal secretary of her only child, the late actor Enrique
Alvarez Felix.</TE>
<TE>   Benjamin Felix, her brother, challenged the will in court,
claiming that the film star was manipulated "through violence or
medication." He filed a separate civil complaint asking authorities
to dig up his sister's coffin to determine whether she was poisoned
or given drugs to hasten her death.</TE>
<TE>   Neither complaint named a suspected villain, but Benjamin Felix
cast suspicion on two of his sister's friends: restaurateur Estela
Moctezuma and Ernesto Alonso, an 85-year-old actor known here as Mr.
Soap Opera. The brother accused them of blocking an autopsy
immediately following Felix's death and preventing relatives from
seeing her body.</TE>
<TE>   It was Alonso who sent Martinez de Anda to work for the actress 12
years ago. The young man inherited most of the estate, including
homes in Mexico City and Cuernavaca, Mexico, worth several million
dollars. (The French lover got her silver Rolls-Royce and collection
of Diego Rivera paintings.)</TE>
<TE>   Alonso held a news conference this week to deny that he concealed
the body and to proclaim, "I have nothing to hide."</TE>
<TE>   The actress' assistant deserved the inheritance, Alonso said,
"because Maria loved him like a son, and it was he who kept her
company.... It was Maria's decision not to leave anything to her
relatives. She knows why she did it. I don't."</TE>
<TE>   People at the cemetery and callers to radio talk shows took sides
Thursday, with most against the exhumation.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were the brother, I would be upset about the will," said
Jorge Garcia, 55, who crafted the stone for the tomb Felix now shares
with her son and parents. "But the dead should be left to rest in
peace. I don't think there was anything wrong or hidden in her death.
But this is happening so they can clear up any doubt. Look, it can
happen regardless of who you are."</TE>

<HD>German Terror Cell's Link to 9/11 Detailed</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Three hijackers and four suspected Al Qaeda
recruits in the Hamburg group plotted attacks for at least two years,
prosecutor says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>A shared hatred of the United States and Israel drew three Sept. 11
hijackers together with four other purported Al Qaeda recruits into a
terrorist cell in Hamburg that plotted the elaborate attacks for at
least two years, Germany's federal prosecutor said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In the most detailed account of the cell's activities since the
Hamburg connection was discovered two days after the U.S. attacks,
prosecutor Kay Nehm described how the hijackers and their alleged
accomplices became acquainted at a mosque frequented by vehemently
anti-Western Muslims.</LD>
<LD>   The portrait was constructed through investigation of bank
accounts, wiretaps and interviews with thousands of witnesses,
including a librarian who recalled how one of the hijackers, Marwan
Al-Shehhi, boasted more than a year before the attacks that thousands
would die and "you will all remember me then," Nehm told reporters at
a news conference in the city of Karlsruhe.</LD>
<TE>   The prosecutor's depiction of the cell in Hamburg, a port city in
northern Germany, described the initial contacts, terrorist training
in Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan and the financing of the hijackers'
preparations. For the most part, he confirmed and put into
perspective previously known details about the hijackers' cell.</TE>
<TE>   But it remained unclear how the perpetrators came into contact
with the network run by fugitive Osama bin Laden. To date, there has
been no recruiter or linchpin identified as the link between the
Hamburg group and Al Qaeda. Neither did Nehm explain how the money
carefully controlled by one member of the Hamburg cell came into the
group's hands.</TE>
<TE>   Nehm's retrospective on the German-based figures in the U.S.
attacks accompanied his announcement of charges against the only
Sept. 11 suspect in custody in Germany, 28-year-old Mounir
Motassadeq. The prosecutor described Motassadeq as "the governor" of
the cell's affairs while its members were abroad for combat training
and flight schools.</TE>
<TE>   "The accused remained behind in Hamburg but was just as involved
in the preparations for the terror attacks as the perpetrators right
up to their commission," Nehm said. "He was aware of the aims of the
terrorist attacks committed by the cell and supported their planning
and preparation with an array of activities."</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq was spotted training with Al Qaeda near the southern
Afghan city of Kandahar in May 2000, Nehm said, though he refused to
specify the source of the sighting.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq, a Moroccan who studied electrical engineering at the
Hamburg Technical University also attended by Al-Shehhi and Sept. 11
ringleader Mohamed Atta, has been charged with membership in an
illegal terrorist organization and 3,116 counts of accessory to
murder, Nehm said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a wheel in the works without whom the affairs of the group
wouldn't have functioned," Nehm said of Motassadeq, who told
journalists before his Nov. 28 arrest that he hardly knew the
hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, Nehm said, Motassadeq was an important member of the
seven-man cell, funneling money to the others during their foreign
preparations, which included training in Afghanistan, flight schools
in Florida and meetings in Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq was one of two witnesses to Atta's 1996 last will and
testament.</TE>
<TE>   "The will demonstrated that he was ready to give his life for the
holy war," Nehm said of Atta's declaration.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq, who was charged Wednesday before the Hamburg Superior
Court, also is pictured in videos of alleged accomplice Said Bahaji's
1999 wedding, which was attended by the rest of the cell, Nehm said.
The prosecutor's statement confirmed information leaked to the media
months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He said the Nazis' mass murder of Jews was good and he approved
of terrorist attacks, as well as using violence as a way to convert
others to Islam," Nehm said, quoting from a 90-page sealed indictment
against Motassadeq.</TE>
<TE>   The formal case against Motassadeq coincided with charges filed in
Seattle and Chicago against other suspected supporters of Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   German investigators and judicial authorities have been under
intense pressure from U.S. colleagues to discover the links between
Al Qaeda and the Hamburg cell, which operated in this country for
years without raising suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   Atta, an Egyptian who had just completed a master's degree in
urban planning before launching preparations for the suicide attacks,
became the leader of the group by virtue of his age, organizational
skills and command of German, Nehm said.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the members of this cell shared the same religious
convictions, an Islamic lifestyle, a feeling of being out of place in
unfamiliar cultural surroundings that they weren't used to," Nehm
said. "At the center of this stood a hatred of world Jewry and the
United States."</TE>
<TE>   The cell espoused "violent Islamic ideology aimed at attacking
countries like the United States and set itself against the cultural
values of the West," Nehm said. "The Hamburg group was part of an
international terrorism network of Islamic fundamentalists linked
with Osama bin Laden."</TE>
<TE>   According to Nehm, the Hamburg group began, at the latest, in
October 1999 talking about "a holy war against the United States in
which the maximum number of people could be killed." Six months
later, the group had decided on the World Trade Center as a fitting
target at the suggestion of Al Qaeda sponsors, the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   Cell members then set off for Afghanistan in two groups for
training, he said, with Atta, Al-Shehhi, Ziad Samir Jarrah and Ramzi
Binalshibh departing Germany in November 1999 and Motassadeq, Bahaji
and Zakariya Essabar leaving the following spring. Motassadeq spent
May through August 2000 in Afghanistan, Nehm said.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorists used their time in the Afghan training camps to
consult with their Al Qaeda hosts on details of the U.S. attacks,
Nehm said.</TE>
<TE>   Atta, 33, is believed to have piloted the first Boeing 767 that
crashed into the World Trade Center; Al-Shehhi, 23, was reportedly at
the helm of the second. Jarrah, a 26-year-old Lebanese, was thought
to have been behind the controls of the Boeing 757 that crashed in
rural Pennsylvania, apparently after passengers stormed the cockpit
to stop the hijacking.</TE>
<TE>   Arrest warrants have been issued for Binalshibh, Bahaji and
Essabar, all believed to have fled Germany ahead of the U.S.
terrorist strikes, most likely to remote regions of Pakistan.
Binalshibh, 30, and Essabar, 25, are suspected of having been, each
in turn, intended to be the 20th hijacker--five each aboard the four
doomed planes, including a jet that hit the Pentagon. But both were
denied U.S. visas to attend flight schools.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Nehm said, Zacarias Moussaoui flew to the United States
in February 2001. Moussaoui was arrested after exhibiting suspicious
behavior at a flight school and is now on trial in Virginia on
charges of conspiracy to commit terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Nehm said Moussaoui met in London in December 2000 with
Binalshibh, who transferred more than $11,000 to the United States to
pay for Moussaoui's flight lessons.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq, whose wife and child live a few blocks from the
apartment where Atta ran the Hamburg cell, has been detained since
his arrest at a jail in North Rhine-Westphalia state. Nehm said the
suspect has been uncooperative during questioning, the results of
which the prosecutor described as "worthless."</TE>
<TE>   In television interviews in October, Motassadeq acknowledged that
he had power of attorney over a bank account held by Al-Shehhi, a
citizen of the United Arab Emirates who received a monthly stipend of
nearly $2,000 from his homeland's government. Other members of the
Hamburg cell reportedly received generous support from family members
that might have been applied to their plot against the U.S.
landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   Nehm declined to reveal much detail beyond a statement issued at
the start of his news conference but acknowledged that investigators
have so far found nothing to link the Hamburg cell with the 16 other
perpetrators who died aboard the hijacked planes that crashed into
the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and the Pennsylvania
countryside.</TE>

<HD>Torpedo Leaks Like Kursk's Found on Other Subs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Torpedo propellant leaks similar to the one that sparked the
explosion and sinking of the Kursk have been found on other Northern
Fleet submarines, one of many examples of sloppiness revealed by an
investigation into the August 2000 tragedy.</LD>
<LD>   The prosecutor general's probe into the catastrophe that killed
the Kursk's 118-man crew was detailed in a state newspaper Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov closed the books on the
accident last month, saying no one was to blame. The blast was caused
by highly volatile hydrogen peroxide seeping from cracks in a
torpedo.</LD>
<TE>   That torpedo was built in Kazakhstan in 1990. Investigators have
determined that some of its components had been used from one to six
years beyond their designated service life, and they cited an absence
of data about the condition of the rubber gaskets.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutors said a check of other Russian submarines in 2000
and 2001 revealed the use of bad gaskets, which resulted in leaks
from torpedo tanks, the paper said.</TE>

<HD>Israel Expresses Regret in Civilian Deaths</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Shelling sparks Palestinian charges of sabotaging
peace effort and vows of revenge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israel expressed regret Thursday for the deaths of four Palestinian
civilians in an army shelling, an attack that jeopardized shaky steps
toward reducing tensions in the Gaza Strip.</LD>
<LD>   But violence continued, with Israeli soldiers shooting to death
Abdel Hadi Hamayda, a 12-year-old Palestinian, in the Gaza-Egyptian
border town of Rafah, Palestinians said. Residents said Israeli
forces opened fire after children threw rocks and bottles at Israeli
tanks that were tearing down structures. The Israeli military said it
returned fire after Palestinians fired rifles and threw hand
grenades, firebombs and rocks.</LD>
<LD>   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Israeli forces entered the
Palestinian government headquarters and set off explosives, a witness
said. Residents said they heard an explosion throughout the city, and
witnesses said part of the three-story, fortress-like building was
destroyed, including the office of the governor, Mahmoud Aloul, who
was not in the building at the time. No casualties were reported.</LD>
<TE>   On Aug. 18, Israel and the Palestinians agreed on a plan to turn
security over to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
town of Bethlehem as a test case for Palestinians' resuming
responsibility for security in areas Israel took over after a series
of suicide bombings. The Bethlehem hand-over took place two days
later, but there has been no movement in Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   Talks over implementation of the Gaza agreement had already
stalled before Israeli shells fell on a Bedouin encampment early
Thursday near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim, killing a mother,
her two grown sons and another relative.</TE>
<TE>   Furious Palestinians charged that Israel was trying to sabotage
peace efforts, and Hamas militants threatened revenge. Israel
defended its actions but expressed regret.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer ordered an inquiry.
"I'm deeply sorry about what happened, but you have to understand
that our forces are involved in a battlefield situation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli military said soldiers opened fire on suspicious
figures crawling toward an Israeli army post. But the statement it
released also said, "The Israeli military expresses regret over
casualties among innocent civilians."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians rejected the explanation, saying the Israeli tanks
aimed their shells at the last two structures still standing in the
Sheik Iljeen encampment.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere Thursday, Hezbollah guerrillas shelled Israeli positions
in the disputed Shabaa Farms area on the border with Lebanon,
wounding three soldiers and drawing fire from Israeli warplanes and
artillery, according to military sources. There were no immediate
reports of Lebanese casualties.</TE>

<HD>An Island Full of Suspects</HD>
<DH>The first murder on Norfolk in 149 years has stumped
inhabitants, who are descendants of Bounty mutineers. Authorities
have turned to mass fingerprinting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KINGSTON, Norfolk Island</DL>
<LD>For six generations, descendants of the Bounty mutineers have thrived
on this stunning South Pacific island largely untouched by the evils
of the outside world.</LD>
<LD>   They have prided themselves on creating a peaceful new society
from the violence of the past--the bloodshed of their mutinous
forefathers and the cruelty of Norfolk Island's last penal colony.
There hadn't been a murder here in 149 years.</LD>
<LD>   That changed on Easter Sunday when the body of Janelle Patton, a
29-year-old waitress from mainland Australia, was found at Cockpit
Waterfall, one of Norfolk Island's popular tourist spots. She had
been brutally stabbed and left under a sheet of black plastic.</LD>
<TE>   "Norfolk Island lost its innocence when she was killed," says Ken
Christian, 52, the great-great-great-great-great-grandson of mutiny
leader Fletcher Christian. "The worst thing about this murder is that
nobody knows who did it. There's a really big hope that it's not one
of us."</TE>
<TE>   Rumors and speculation have swept the island, a self-governing
territory of Australia 900 miles east of the mainland, but federal
detectives flown in from Canberra, the Australian capital, to find
the killer have been stumped. They have no weapon, no motive and no
suspects. They still don't know where on the small island Patton was
killed.</TE>
<TE>   With a hint of desperation, police launched a voluntary program
this month to get the fingerprints and handprints of every Norfolk
resident between the ages of 15 and 70--a total of 1,632 people.</TE>
<TE>   Australian police say they know of no other instance where mass
fingerprinting has been used to solve a crime, but this is no
ordinary case. Because everyone who travels to Norfolk Island must
fill out an arrival card and go through passport control, authorities
have the names of all 2,771 men, women and children who were on the
island that day.</TE>
<TE>   Police will compare the residents' prints with partial palm prints
and fingerprints recovered from the plastic sheet that covered
Patton's body.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities acknowledge that the prints they found might not
belong to the killer, but they hope that a high turnout will flush
out the culprit or that matching prints will lead them to the scene
of the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Police are coy about what they know, but for now they're focusing
their efforts on Norfolk residents, not the 690 tourists visiting the
island that day. For inspiration, authorities cite the case of Wee
Waa, Australia, where voluntary mass DNA testing of the town's males
in 2000 prompted a man who had raped a 91-year-old woman to turn
himself in.</TE>
<TE>   If police don't find a match on Norfolk Island, they say they will
track down all the visitors to the island on the day of the slaying
and request their prints as well. Police promise to destroy all the
fingerprints and handprints once the case is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   For the last three weeks, the people of Norfolk Island have done
their duty and come forward to give police their prints. The first
two in line were the island's chief minister, Geoff Gardner, and his
wife, Pauline. By Thursday, 1,079 people had been printed.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of people I know want to get this murder solved and
get it behind us," Bounty descendant Kane Anderson, 35, said after
giving police his prints. "They want to get in and get it done."</TE>
<TE>   The hard part will be persuading the last few hundred islanders to
come forward.</TE>
<TE>   Some distrust the police or object to the fingerprinting as a
violation of their civil liberties. Other residents, such as "Thorn
Birds" author Colleen McCullough, believe that the police botched the
case and should have solved it months ago. "They won't get my
fingerprints," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Today's peaceful people of Norfolk Island share a colorful and
violent history; brutality and killings were once commonplace here.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. James Cook discovered the uninhabited volcanic island in
1774. Then as now, the island was protected by high cliffs and
crashing surf that made landing difficult. The temperate, 3-by-5-mile
island was covered by towering Norfolk pines, a species found only
here. Cook called the island "paradise." In 1788, weeks after
founding Australia's first penal colony in present-day Sydney,
Britain dispatched a ship with prisoners to settle Norfolk Island.</TE>
<TE>   A year later on the other side of the Pacific, Fletcher Christian
led a mutiny on the Bounty against his sharp-tongued captain and
former friend, William Bligh. The mutineers put Bligh and 18 loyal
crew members in a 23-foot boat. They sailed for seven weeks and,
nearly starving, reached safety in West Timor. Bligh later became
governor of the Australian territory, which included Norfolk Island.</TE>
<TE>   Christian took the Bounty and searched for a new home, eventually
reaching uninhabited Pitcairn Island southeast of Tahiti with eight
other mutineers, 12 Polynesian women and six Polynesian men. They
burned the ship to avoid discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Jealousy and violence consumed the new community, and within a few
years, 12 of the 15 men had been killed, including Christian. When an
American whaling ship discovered the settlement in 1808, only one man
was left, mutineer John Adams, with seven women and 24 children.</TE>
<TE>   By then, the once-vicious community had become a model of virtue.
After drinking a potent home brew and reading the Bounty's Bible,
Adams found God and taught the word to the women and children. When
news of the Pitcairn settlement reached Britain 20 years after the
mutiny, it was hailed as "the world's most pious and perfect
community."</TE>
<TE>   By 1825, Norfolk was on its way to becoming the most brutal prison
in the British empire. For nearly 30 years, the worst of Australia's
convicts were sent here, where they were abused and tortured, often
to death. Norfolk became known as "Hell in the Pacific," where death
was the only escape. Local historians believe that the island's last
slaying occurred in 1853, when one prisoner hit another on the head
with a shovel.</TE>
<TE>   In 1854,  Britain decided to close the prison. By then, the Bounty
descendants had outgrown tiny Pitcairn Island. To keep another
foreign power from occupying Norfolk Island, Britain offered it to
the descendants of the Bounty mutineers. The entire Pitcairn
community sailed nearly 4,000 miles from their home to Norfolk in
1856. A handful later returned to Pitcairn, where their descendants
still live.</TE>
<TE>   Today the Norfolk Islanders, as the Pitcairn descendants call
themselves, survive mainly on revenue from tourists. Reluctant to
adopt the innovations of the outside world, they maintain a simple,
traditional life. The island has no stoplights, no postal delivery
and no garbage pickup. There is no income tax, sales tax or
unemployment. The top speed limit is 30 mph, and cows wander freely
across the roads.</TE>
<TE>   Residents rarely lock their houses and usually leave their car
keys in the ignition. On the road, motorists give a little wave to
the drivers of oncoming vehicles. Norfolk's first lady, Pauline
Gardner, waits on tables at the family restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Court convenes once a month and usually adjourns by lunch. There
hasn't been a reported crime serious enough to warrant a jury trial
in a decade. On the rare occasions when a minor offender is jailed,
police leave the cell door open so the prisoner can go outside and
smoke. It is the kind of place where families stick together and
everyone knows everyone else's business.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't even change your underwear here without somebody
knowing," says shop owner Norelle Little.</TE>
<TE>   Television didn't arrive until the mid-1980s. Last week, residents
voted overwhelmingly not to allow cell phones on the island, siding
with opponents who argued that the devices were "annoying, antisocial
and irritating" and could "destroy the peace and tranquillity of the
island." Many islanders still speak the Pitcairn language, a singsong
blend of Tahitian and 18th century English developed by the mutineers
and their Tahitian wives.</TE>
<TE>   As of last year's census, there were 756 Pitcairn descendants--48%
of Norfolk Island's permanent residents. The remainder migrated here
over the years, some of them marrying into the Pitcairn families.</TE>
<TE>   The names of Bounty mutineers live on. The slender Norfolk phone
book lists 44 Christians, 30 Quintals, 17 Adamses and 12 McCoys. Many
have colorful, if obscure, nicknames such as "Lettuce Leaf," "Pumpa,"
"Morg," "Toofy," "Loppy," "Kik Kik," "Pusswah" and "Boof." For the
tourists, there is the Bounty Glass Bottom Boat, the Bligh Court
Holiday Cottages, the Fletcher Christian Apartments and the Pitcairn
Settlers Village, to name a few attractions.</TE>
<TE>   Norfolk Island's parliament has placed strict controls on who can
move here. Would-be immigrants are carefully screened, their health
certified and their criminal records checked. Those seeking to live
here permanently are required to buy a business and are only allowed
to replace departing residents one for one. Then they are required to
live here for five years and win final approval before they can
receive residency.</TE>
<TE>   To maintain the tourist industry, the government allows hundreds
of temporary workers to live here for up to three years. The number
of permits issued depends on the number of workers needed. Most work
in restaurants and inns and come from mainland Australia, like
Janelle Patton.</TE>
<TE>   Patton, who would have turned 30 in June, was working as the
dining room supervisor of a hotel restaurant. Trim and athletic, she
had been living on the island for two years and had dated several
men. Recently she had helped raise money so the surfing club could
send a team to compete in Tonga.</TE>
<TE>   "She appeared to fit in very well in the community," says Geoff
Gardner, the chief minister. "She was very friendly and had an
outgoing personality. She was an attractive young lady who attracted
attention. I think she enjoyed life."</TE>
<TE>   Her parents came to visit her March 30, the day before Easter.
After working at the restaurant that Sunday morning, Patton bought
groceries and went home. Before meeting up with her parents, she went
for her customary walk on the streets near her home.</TE>
<TE>   About 11:40 a.m., a neighbor driving along Rooty Hill Road saw her
walking. When the neighbor came back a few minutes later, Patton was
gone. No one has reported seeing her after that. Det. Sgt. Bob
Peters, who is heading the investigation into the slaying, suspects
that Patton was picked up by a passing car, perhaps driven by someone
she knew.</TE>
<TE>   A little later, several golfers playing on the course at the south
end of the island heard screams but thought that they were the sounds
of children playing. At 6 p.m., two New Zealand tourists found
Patton's body near the waterfall on the north side of the island. She
had been dead for more than three hours; heavy rains had fallen about
3 p.m., and water had collected on the plastic covering her body.</TE>
<TE>   Police say Patton would have bled profusely from multiple stab
wounds, but they haven't been able to find traces of her blood
anywhere. Residents say it's odd that her body was left in such a
public place. Everyone here knows that the way to get rid of
something is to dump it from a cliff into the ocean--the same way the
community disposes of its garbage and old cars.</TE>
<TE>   Peters suspects that the killer panicked and wasn't thinking
rationally. "I don't think you could say it was well thought out,"
the detective says. If not, then the killer was exceedingly lucky. He
or she was able to pick up the victim in broad daylight, kill her and
dispose of the body in a public place during the middle of the day,
apparently without being seen.</TE>
<TE>   Some wonder whether more than one person was involved or whether
members of the killer's family are helping to cover up the crime. "My
feeling is, people must know more," Gardner says. "Somebody must have
seen something. Whether they are deliberately holding back, I don't
know."</TE>
<TE>   Some islanders suggest that the killer came from the mainland and
left right after the murder, but police discount that theory. Many
suspect that Patton was killed by a former lover or a jealous rival.
At least one ex-boyfriend was quick to give police his fingerprints.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery of the body prompted residents to worry that a
serial killer might be on the loose. Islanders began locking their
doors for the first time. Women who lived alone moved in with
friends. "Initially it was a lot like throwing a grenade into a
crowded restaurant," Gardner says. "It devastated the community."</TE>
<TE>   Now, many residents are frustrated that police have been unable to
solve the case more quickly and that Norfolk Island's reputation
remains under a cloud.</TE>
<TE>   "All we know is, the murderer was here that day," Peters says. "We
haven't ruled out anything."</TE>

<HD>Pakistani Officials Reject Ex-Premier Bhutto's Candidacy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LARKANA, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Election officials today rejected a bid by former Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto to run in parliamentary elections, a day after they
certified former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as a candidate despite a
government ban on his return from exile in Saudi Arabia.</LD>
<LD>   Officials in Bhutto's hometown of Larkana, in southern Pakistan,
rejected her petition to run for a seat on the National Assembly,
saying she is prohibited from running under national laws that ban
from elections those who have been convicted of a crime. Bhutto, who
lives in self-imposed exile in London and Dubai, United Arab
Emirates, was convicted last month of corruption and sentenced to
three years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Bhutto's lawyer said he would appeal the election commission's
decision.</LD>
<TE>   Officials are scheduled to rule Saturday on Bhutto's bids for two
other seats. Pakistani politicians commonly run in several
constituencies.</TE>
<TE>   Sharif's candidacy, in contrast to Bhutto's, was approved even
though he had been sentenced to life imprisonment on hijacking and
terrorism charges after being overthrown by the current president,
Gen. Pervez Musharraf, in a bloodless military coup in October 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, he was released in exchange for a promise that
neither he nor 25 family members would return for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   All were banned from participating in Pakistani politics under the
deal.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials said Thursday they would not challenge the
independent election commission's decision, but ruled out any chance
that Sharif would run.</TE>
<TE>   New laws enacted by Musharraf prohibit from running people who
have been convicted and premiers who have served twice before.</TE>
<TE>   Bhutto was convicted in absentia on corruption charges and
officials say there are 12 additional cases against her outstanding.
Musharraf has said Bhutto, unlike Sharif, is free to return to
Pakistan but that she would face arrest.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of recent appearances and public statements, Bhutto
has vowed to return to run in the elections.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Report Paints a Grim Picture of the Life Palestinians
Now Live</HD>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Mohammed abu Khalaif's family has been selling dry goods in a shop
near Damascus Gate in East Jerusalem for more than 50 years, but he
can't remember a time when business was this bad.</LD>
<LD>   Since the Israeli military imposed new roadblocks and travel
restrictions on Palestinians two months ago, sales of soap powder,
corn, beans and paper products to West Bank customers have dried up.
The Khalaifs have laid off two workers and shifted from a wholesale
to a retail operation because customers are buying only what they
need and in small quantities.</LD>
<LD>   "Before, it used to be so busy," Khalaif said. "Customers only
come in occasionally now, and they're pinching every shekel."</LD>
<TE>   As the Khalaifs' business goes, so goes the rest of the West Bank,
Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. A United Nations report released
Thursday paints a bleak picture of the economic destruction that has
resulted from the lattice of checkpoints and the roadblocks,
incursions and destruction of buildings and supply networks under the
military lock-down of the last several months.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers tell part of the story. Unemployment for East
Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza rose sharply between the first and
second quarters, from 36% to 50%, the U.N. reported, as the military
tightened restrictions on travel and trade.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a staggering rise in unemployment," Terje Roed-Larsen,
the senior U.N. official in the region, told reporters Thursday. "The
Palestinian population is scrambling to survive."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in memory, the jobless rate in the West
Bank--63.3% on curfew days--is higher than the Gaza Strip's 50%,
following the encirclement of Ramallah, Hebron and other major West
Bank trading centers.</TE>
<TE>   Lost income has grown to $7.6 million a day, the U.N. calculated,
drawing on preliminary figures from the Palestinian Central Bureau of
Statistics. The total is $3.3 billion since October 2000, just after
the current intifada began, with the average Palestinian now living
on less than $2 a day.</TE>
<TE>   As people run out of money, they are borrowing from relatives,
selling valuables and doing without. Even items such as cereal and
potato chips are considered luxuries, said Mohammed Iftha, a
26-year-old manager at Masuji Co., a consumer products supplier
operating in Ramallah. His sales have fallen 40%, and travel
restrictions prevent Iftha from visiting the factory, holding
meetings or handling other basic tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has legitimate security concerns, U.N. officials stressed.
But they argue that most Palestinians don't pose a threat and that
many of the measures--such as blocking water trucks from entering
West Bank towns--don't enhance security and could even undermine the
safety of Israelis by making Palestinians feel more vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Yarden Vatikay, an Israeli Defense Ministry spokesman,
said all steps taken are for legitimate reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "Terje Larsen is not the defense minister of the state of Israel,"
he said. "He should leave it to us to say what's necessary to protect
our people."</TE>
<TE>   None of the measures are intended as harassment, he said. "The
only thing we're trying to do is prevent monstrous attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Aid groups have tried to fill some of the gaps amid the sharp
economic contraction in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but they can't
hope to fully make up the shortfall, Roed-Larsen said. The World Food
Program is increasing food deliveries to serve 500,000 people a day,
while the U.N. Relief and Works Agency is feeding 1 million. Half of
all Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem receive
some food assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a natural catastrophe. It's a man-made crisis,"
Roed-Larsen said. "The main cause is the security system built by
Israel after the [June] reoccupation of the West Bank and the
closures and restrictions imposed on the West Bank and Gaza Strip."</TE>
<TE>   Aid agencies add that the cost and time involved in delivering
food have risen sharply. Road closures mean shipments often must be
transferred by hand to get around barriers. And many agencies have
had to hire foreign drivers or use their senior staff because most
Palestinians are no longer allowed through the checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm supposed to be the American representative here," said Thomas
Neu, a Jerusalem-based official with Near East Refugee Aid. "But at
some point every day I end up being the chauffeur."</TE>
<TE>   Development officials say privately that the military closures
have put them in an awkward position. If they don't concentrate on
food and water delivery, people go without. By concentrating on those
things, however, they're unable to work on more substantive long-term
projects that are their principal mandate. Furthermore, by easing the
burdens on the population, they may be helping extend the status quo
of military restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians are doing what they can to adapt to the
circumstances. The Four Seasons cafe opened two months ago on Sultan
Suleiman Road in East Jerusalem. The original business plan, crafted
before the intifada began, drew on tourists, Israelis and West Bank
visitors. All those groups have dried up.</TE>
<TE>   The day the intifada started, manager and principal Ibrahim
Hindiyeh said, he went home distraught. But he and his investment
partners had little choice but to lower their prices and goals and
depend almost exclusively on local customers less affected by the
restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you can only go forward through the fire because
there's nowhere else to go," Hindiyeh said.</TE>
<TE>   With every violent incident in East Jerusalem, business evaporated
for a week until people slowly begin emerging from their houses.
Several weeks ago, seven people were wounded in a coffee shop near
the Four Seasons. The cafe's level of business has become a barometer
of the political situation.</TE>
<TE>   With roads blocked, the restaurant can't get its basic supplies
from the West Bank and must buy everything, at higher cost, in
Israel. Trust is so low and fear so high that Israeli suppliers
refuse to drive even a few feet into East Jerusalem, forcing the cafe
owners to haul in shipments by handcart. The few Jewish customers ask
the cafe staff to bring takeout food to the East Jerusalem border a
couple of blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian business owners say the community needs its mobility
restored.</TE>
<TE>   "We just try and survive," Hindiyeh said. "Practically speaking,
we're trying to operate in a state of war. You just hope things
eventually get better."</TE>

<DL>LAGOS, Nigeria</DL>
<LD>An Islamic court has sentenced a couple to death by stoning for
having an affair, marking the first time in Nigeria that a man has
been sentenced to death for adultery, media reported Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The couple, Ahmadu Ibrahim and Fatima Usman, both 30, were
sentenced to death Monday in the central town of New Gawu.</LD>
<LD>   Usman had become pregnant with Ibrahim's child while she was
married to another man, the radio and television reports said.</LD>
<TE>   Ibrahim is the first man to be sentenced to death for adultery in
Nigeria.</TE>
<TE>   Previously only women were prosecuted and their children used as
evidence, while men got off for lack of proof.</TE>
<TE>   The decision came a week after an Islamic court rejected single
mother Amina Lawal's appeal of the same sentence for having sex
outside of marriage, a case that provoked an international outcry.</TE>

<HD>Partnership Plan Draws Fire</HD>
<DH>Summit: The U.S. is criticized for its approach on poverty
and the environment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Taking the stage at a U.N. summit Thursday, the Bush administration
struck a challenging tone as it rolled out its "new approach" to
reduce poverty and protect the environment through partnerships with
businesses, international groups and friendly countries.</LD>
<LD>   "The United States is the world's leader in sustainable
development," said Undersecretary of State Paula J. Dobriansky, as
she listed initiatives ranging from protecting Congo's rain forest to
providing clean water and energy to the poor. "No other nation has
made a greater and more concrete commitment."</LD>
<LD>   But a skeptical crowd quickly pounced on the proposals, suggesting
that a global commitment rather than a few pilot projects is expected
from the world's richest nation.</LD>
<TE>   "Solving the problems of some villages is not an appropriate
stance for the United States," said Jeffrey D. Sachs, director of the
Earth Institute at Columbia University. "It puts us at risk in our
foreign policy. We cannot lead the world in a war against terrorism
if we don't lead the world in the war on poverty, disease and
environmental degradation."</TE>
<TE>   Although President Bush has not joined other leaders at the 10-day
World Summit on Sustainable Development, his policies dominate the
discussions. U.S. negotiators, representing a country that emits
about one-quarter of globe-warming gases, are resisting pressure from
European nations to set dates and targets to reduce reliance on
fossil fuels or develop other preservation strategies.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bush administration has embraced a United
Nations-sponsored effort to set up partnerships that immediately
begin to work on specific environmental or poverty issues in hopes
that momentum will build.</TE>
<TE>   In unveiling the U.S.-led partnerships, Dobriansky ridiculed
efforts to draft a global implementation plan for goals adopted by
the U.S. and other nations a decade ago at the Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro. The document, she said, "now runs to some 30,000 words."</TE>
<TE>   "Words are good. Actions are better," Dobriansky said. "Only
concrete actions can prevent children from contracting water-borne
diseases, allow families to cook meals indoors without risking fatal
respiratory illnesses [or] protect delicate African ecosystems."</TE>
<TE>   These problems are the focus of some of the administration's
proposed partnerships unveiled Thursday. Others ranged from growing
bird-friendly "shade coffee" in a partnership with Starbucks and
government agencies to providing $15 million in a partnership with an
unidentified U.S. sponsor and a South African bank to finance the
building of 90,000 homes in South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Partnerships have been popping up among nations and nonprofit
groups frustrated by a lack of progress since the Rio summit. Some
are small in scope, such as a $300,000 investment that provided 2,500
subsistence farmers in Kenya with honey-producing beehives. Others
are bigger, such as collaboration among U.N. organizations,
governments, British Petroleum and the nonprofit Natural Resources
Defense Council to phase out leaded and high-sulfur gasolines and
diesel fuel worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has hinted at its partnerships for weeks,
building up expectations among government officials and environmental
activists, who gathered Thursday to pore over the details.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad that [the Bush administration] didn't go further and say
the United States is going to make a major investment to address
these problems," said Jacob Scherr, director of international
programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council.</TE>
<TE>   David Hales, a political advisor to the nonprofit Stakeholder
Forum, said he was trying to figure out how the Bush administration's
Congo Basin Forest Partnership differed from a similar program he ran
under the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to protect the second-largest rain forest in the
world," Hales said. "It takes a lot of money. The way you do this is
not with a few forestry projects, but by tackling the causes of
deforestation: reducing poverty, stabilizing governments, building
integrated watershed management."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Bush's proposals take aim at huge problems, such as AIDS,
cutting hunger in Africa and bringing clean water and sanitation to
impoverished communities throughout the Third World.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference, a panel of 13 administration officials said
they could not say how much new funding was being proposed or how
much was being shifted from existing programs. Under exasperated
quizzing from British reporters, one of whom complained that the
answers "strained credulity," Andrew S. Natsios, administrator of the
U.S. Agency for International Development, blurted out, "It's not a
huge amount of money."</TE>
<TE>   Some members of Congress and Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown, a former
California governor, held a separate news conference to declare that
Bush's views do not reflect those of all Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course you are embarrassed when you don't have committed U.S.
leadership on these issues," said Rep. George Miller, a Democrat from
Martinez, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) said the administration had simply
cribbed earlier ideas and shuffled money around for the partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "At least they have picked up one theme of the summit," Blumenauer
said. "They're recycling. They're recycling money and they are
recycling ideas."</TE>

<HD>U.S., Italy Act Against Terror Suspects</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States and Italy acted in concert Thursday to freeze the
assets of 25 individuals and financial entities with alleged ties to
the Al Qaeda terrorist group.</LD>
<LD>   The joint offensive was the biggest collaborative effort of its
kind, U.S. officials said, and came amid growing concern about a
perceived lack of progress in cutting off the flow of funds to
terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   "Today's action makes clear that we are serious about shutting
down any company or organization that is in the business of
supporting terrorism," Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. and Italy issued blocking orders that require commercial
banks to search for assets belonging to the individuals and entities
and to freeze any they find.</TE>
<TE>   The list includes 11 people associated with the Salafist Group for
Call and Combat, described by U.S. officials as "a lethal terror
group" with ties to Al Qaeda. The other 14 are entities owned or
controlled by Ahmed Idris Nasreddin and Youssef Nada, both of whom
have been accused of bankrolling terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The action increases to 234 the number of people and organizations
placed on an international roster of alleged terrorist financiers
following the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the U.S. and other countries have frozen more than $112
million in assets, Treasury officials said. But most of the actions
have been initiated by Washington, and the campaign seems to have
slowed in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   A United Nations monitoring panel has written a draft report that
says the asset seizures have failed to dry up financing for Al Qaeda,
the militant Islamic network accused of orchestrating the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Al Qaeda continues to have access to considerable financial and
other economic resources," the panel said in the draft report. It
characterized the group as "alive and well and poised to strike again
how, when and where it chooses."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials disputed the critical assessment of the asset
seizure program, a central element of President Bush's response to
the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has claimed that the work is yet complete, and we have
always said this would be a long-term effort," U.S. Ambassador John
D. Negroponte told reporters at the U.N. "I would not accept the
proposition that these efforts have stalled."</TE>
<TE>   Treasury officials said Thursday's action was significant because
it was the largest asset-freezing operation to date involving
collaborative efforts by several countries. In addition to the U.S.
and Italy, Luxembourg and the Bahamas participated in the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "All four of those nations provided financial information,
investigative assistance or key documents or support, which allowed
us to make the case necessary for today's designation," said Jimmy
Gurule, Treasury undersecretary for enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 16 asset seizures undertaken since Sept. 11, only a handful
have resulted from collaboration with other governments.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury officials said the slower pace of asset seizures in
recent months is not an accurate indicator of the campaign's
progress. They said they have significantly restricted the flow of
funds to terrorist groups, which is more important than adding new
names to the U.N. list.</TE>
<TE>   "We are confident that our efforts are having real-world effects,"
Gurule said. "Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations are
suffering financially ... [and] potential donors are being more
cautious."</TE>
<TE>   The men added to the list were identified as Adel Ben Soltane,
Nabil Benattia, Yassine Chekkouri, Riadh Jelassi, Mehdi Kammoun,
Samir Kishk, Tarek Maaroufi, Abdelhalim Hafed Remadna, Mansour Thaer,
Lazhar Ben Mohammed Tlili and Habib Waddani.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said all 11 men are associated with the Salafist
Group, a separatist faction of the Algerian-based Armed Islamic
Group, and have been active in Italy and other European countries.</TE>
<TE>   The 14 entities are part of the holdings of Nada and Nasreddin,
both of whom were already on the list of alleged financiers. U.S.
officials said the men have worked together for many years and
exercise control over Bank Al Taqwa and Akida Bank, shell companies
that share the same postal address in the Bahamas.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Thursday skirted the intensifying debate over U.S.
intentions toward Iraq, but allowed his vice president to again make
the case for military action against Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   At a fund-raiser in Oklahoma City, Bush declared: "We should not
allow the world's worst leaders to develop the world's worst
weapons." But he mentioned neither Iraq nor its president by name,
seeking instead to suggest that he continues to carefully weigh his
options.</LD>
<LD>   "I got a lot of tools at my disposal, and I'm a patient man," Bush
said.</LD>
<TE>   Speaking in San Antonio, Vice President Dick Cheney repeated
almost word for word the arguments for swift military action that he
first made Monday to a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in
Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, he told Korean War veterans that Hussein has gathered
chemical and biological weapons and may acquire a nuclear bomb "very
soon."</TE>
<TE>   "Armed with an arsenal of these weapons, sitting atop 10% of the
world's oil, Saddam Hussein could then be expected to seek domination
of the entire Middle East, to take control of the world's energy
supply, and to directly threaten America's friends," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein would also "subject the United States, and any other
nation, to the threat of nuclear blackmail," Cheney said.</TE>
<TE>   The contrast in these messages underscores the White House's
division of labor on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney is spelling out the rationale for war in an effort to
influence the intensifying debate over the wisdom of an attack. Bush,
saying less and steering clear of most details, can deflect criticism
from abroad by saying he has not yet chosen a course.</TE>
<TE>   The president's remarks came in a fund-raising and
get-out-the-vote trip conducted after four days out of the public eye
at his ranch near Crawford, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said U.S. efforts overseas since Sept. 11 could have positive
effects.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand that history gives us an opportunity to make the
world more peaceful.... See, out of the evil done to America is going
to come some incredible good," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He continued: "And you need to tell your little ones that part of
that good is a more peaceful world, that there's going to be some
steep hills to climb between now and then. But by being tough and
strong, patient, smart and wise about using our assets and all the
tools at our disposal, that we can make the world more peaceful for
generations to come."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney contended that U.S. action in the Middle East could create
new stability in the region, but he gave greater stress to the
dangers that the Bush administration says are now posed by Hussein's
regime.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president said Hussein's unconventional weapons have not
been amassed to defend Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "They are offensive weapons, for the purpose of inflicting death
on a massive scale, developed so that Saddam Hussein can hold the
threat over anyone he chooses in his own region or beyond," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney sought to cast doubt on the value of more weapons
inspections by the United Nations, saying that Hussein had proved a
master of deceit and had repeatedly concealed the signs of his
chemical, biological and nuclear programs.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president insisted that Bush would take heed of Congress'
views. Bush "wants us to participate fully" in upcoming hearings on
the issue, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's remarks on Monday set off a new round of criticism abroad
about the administration's plans concerning Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, French President Jacques Chirac said in Paris that
the possibility of a unilateral action by the United States was
"worrying" and "contrary to the cooperation of states, the respect of
law and the authority of the [U.N.] Security Council."</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Turkey, an important U.S. ally, also expressed doubts
about an American attack on Iraq during meetings in Washington this
week.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey is proposing tighter trade sanctions, fearing a Kurdish
state could emerge in Iraq's north if Bush uses force. The Turks have
fought the separatist activities of their large Kurdish minority for
years, as have the Iraqis theirs.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's views were conveyed in two days of talks in Washington
between Ugur Ziyal, undersecretary for foreign affairs, and
high-level Bush administration officials.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell spoke with German, British and
Spanish foreign ministers on Wednesday and Thursday, spokesman
Richard Boucher said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell was "taking up the fact that Iraq's defiance of the
Security Council and development of weapons of mass destruction
constitutes a danger that we have to deal with, and discussing with
these countries how to deal with that," Boucher said.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi government said Thursday that it was ready to negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still room for diplomatic solutions to avert a war with
the United States," said Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan,
who met with Syrian officials in Damascus..</TE>

<LD>If Saddam Hussein really is a mortal threat who will have a nuclear
bomb "fairly soon," then our present administration has been
pitifully negligent in presenting its evidence to the U.N. and to the
Congress (Aug. 27).</LD>
<LD>   If he is indeed the imminent danger that Vice President Dick
Cheney says, then why has President Bush gone on record to say that
no imminent attack is planned? Can't the president get a clear
message to the country and the world?</LD>

<TE>   I do not recommend charging into Iraq to remove Hussein. It is
true we could easily win the war, but what afterward? Whom do we
replace him with?</TE>
<TE>   The choices I see are even less desirable than he is. The
infighting would undo all we set out to do, and in the end the
winners would probably be fundamentalists who would be even less
inclined to help us. We have to face the fact that there are no good
choices; rather, it's the lesser of evils in that part of the world.
Sometimes, as the old adage goes, better the devil you know than the

<TE>   Thank you for your Aug. 27 editorial, "First Stop on Road to
Iraq." So far, all I hear is fear talk without any evidence. The Bush
team, for going to war on Iraq, is creating a distraction from the
issues that need attention from the American public. The things that
Bush doesn't want the American people to think about are the
corporate scandals, the failed drug war, the overcrowding of our
prisons, the severe need for health care for a major part of our
people, the providing of lower costs for prescriptions (especially
for our senior citizens), the need for low-cost housing for our
poorer population, and a litany of other necessary things: providing
repairs to our streets and highways, improving our transit systems
for our cities and extending money to prevent the closures of our
emergency rooms. I could go on and on. It is a sham to drum up a
boogeyman so the American people will be so frightened that they will
not think about our real problems.</TE>
<TE>   All the protests are coming from Republicans. Why are the
Democrats fearful of speaking up? As with Vietnam, they will be sorry
when our soldiers come back in body bags. More Americans--Democrats
and independents alike (as well as wise Republicans)--must stand up
to these bullies.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Gilman</TE>

<TE>   The whole debate about whether or not to go to war with Iraq is
silly and purely academic. Of course there will be another war with
Iraq. The president has discovered that war is good for his approval
ratings, and presidents named Bush don't know how to do anything else
but wage war.</TE>

<LD>It saddens me to read of another youngster lost to gang and drug
violence ("Slain Teen Informant's Kin Settle for $1 Million," Aug.
27). It sickens me to see a mother profit from it and then hold
herself out as a victim. She signed her son's death sentence when she
approved of his participation in the informant program.</LD>
<LD>   A son and mother chose to help put away drug dealers. That was
honorable. Then the son chose to continue buying drugs. That was
stupid. Should the Brea Police Department and the people of the
communities it polices pay for the consequences of the son's and
mother's choices? Shame on the lawyers and mother who think so.</LD>
<LD>   As human beings we are blessed with the gift of free will. Every
day we are given chances to choose right from wrong, honor from
dishonor. Those choices show who we are. By trying to hold someone
else responsible for the decisions we make, we show that we are
nobody.</LD>

<LD>"Taking Stock," Ron Unz's intelligent, witty and satirical Aug. 25
Opinion piece, is a very serious critique of the attitudes of many of
the heads of major American corporations today.</LD>
<LD>   Given the chance, they will always "manage earnings" to show their
companies in the best possible light. I would go one step further and
say that they (CEOs, et al) are also acting as unregulated brokers in
some cases.</LD>
<LD>   One example that comes to mind is where they buy companies, peel
off and sell what they see as no longer profitable, repackage the
remaining assets and sell them to the highest bidder within 18 to 24
months.</LD>
<TE>   They are no longer in the business of providing services and
quality products to the community or to sticking it out in the long
run. They are more interested in responding to short-term goals that
have nothing to do with the business they are in. Unfortunately, Wall
Street analysts and others have also contributed to the making of
this dismal state of affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that we cannot govern effectively by believing
that corporate leaders will always act from a noble impulse when many
powerful and diametrically opposing forces (and opportunities) are
saying otherwise. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was right:
It isn't that human nature has changed; it is what it is. It's the
legal infrastructure and the lack of enforcement that allow us to act
in ways that are not in America's (i.e., the middle class') best
interest. This is what needs to be changed.</TE>

<LD>It is almost Sept. 1 and the budget that, by law, was supposed to be
adopted by July 1 has not been passed. I suggest that a measure be
placed on the ballot soon that would prohibit any checks going out
from the state controller until a budget is approved and passed. I
believe the uproar would result in prompt action by our quibbling
legislators. What is the use of having a law if our own Legislature
chooses to ignore it?</LD>

<TE>   For most of the past several years Sacramento has been late with
getting the budget ready to go into effect. And I have yet to see or
hear of an intelligent reason for it. So I would like to make a
suggestion. One of those groups that puts issues on the ballot should
put one on that automatically deducts $500, permanently, from the
salaries of the governor and every member of the state Legislature
for every week that the budget is late. And the amount should never
be replaced.</TE>

his lack of leadership in our budget crisis ("Governor Sits Out the

his attitudes, lack of experience and other problems. Please inform

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "The Black Okies," (Aug. 25-27): These stories by Mark Arax about
the pilgrimage of a great people from Oklahoma to a hard, rural
setting in the middle of California are the finest examples of print
journalism I've read since your paper's series "Orphans of
Addiction." I was deeply moved by the language, the exhaustive
reporting and the uncanny access to these incredible people.</LD>
<LD>   John Steinbeck moved me in a similar fashion when he wrote of the
people living along the Monterey coastline in his many fine novels,
but his work was drawn from real people. Arax's work was of real
people. Thank you. It was a profound reading experience.</LD>

<TE>   What a delight to see Matt Black's stunning photographs
illustrating your series. Each one is a work of art that not only
visualizes a scene but evokes a double time and place--a then and
now. The subtly nuanced pictures of today's scenes in California
almost subconsciously remind one of the Dust Bowl era of the '30s.
Thank you, Matt Black. With each picture you have photographed the
past and the present in the same frame.</TE>

<TE>   I would like to congratulate you on your courage in publishing the
three-article series regarding the Black Okies. My question: What
took you so long? These stories are not published often enough. Most
of America is familiar with the migration of the Caucasian Okies, but
many of us know a more complete story. This is my family's story. Our
relatives, on my maternal side, moved to California (Bakersfield,
Wasco, Weed, etc.) prior to and during the period outlined in the
articles. They also came to the "promised land" and were
disappointed. However, the articles elicited many pleasant childhood
memories.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, our family did not live in those areas, but we know
the stories. All during our childhood there was a wagon wheel in our
parents' front yard. It was placed there to remind us that that was
the way our grandmother and her brothers came to California.</TE>
<TE>   Michael F. Cochrane</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although I cannot pretend to understand the hardships of being
black, I see many similarities between Chuck Jones' family and mine
(Aug. 26). I am of Asian background, and even though my family did
not come over here as slaves, they were used as slave labor during
the construction of the transcontinental railroad. They, too, were
abused and ridiculed because of their skin color. Because of the
Chinese Exclusion Act (1882-1943) and the small immigration quota, my
father was not eligible for citizenship until the mid-1950s, well
after his arrival in the 1920s and the birth of his three daughters
in the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   Like some in Jones' family, we prospered in many fields. The
problems his grandsons encountered were not because they were black,
poor or lacked education or opportunities but because of their
involvement with drugs. Hope is not a myth and America is not a land
of tragedy. Rather, it is a land of choice, and if you make bad
choices, you suffer the consequences. The positive is that, of his
nine children, five did very well. Perhaps we should stop blaming
society and make people feel more responsibility for their own
plight.</TE>

<TE>   I have just cried over "Life and Death of a Guardian Angel" (Aug.
27). What a wonderful article on family, love, hard work and belief
in God. With all the horrible things happening in the world, this
story showed that simple things are the most important things that
people should hold in their hearts--a simple respect for all mankind
and love for our families. Thank you, Mr. Arax, for trying to share
this with others, but I'm afraid they are too wrapped up in their
401(k)s and new BMWs to give a thought to your wonderful article.</TE>

<HD>Esther Dendel, 92; Noted Craftswoman, Collector</HD>

<LD>Esther Dendel could see intriguing patterns in the rain trickling
down the window, in the carpet pile as she vacuumed and in soap
bubbles as she washed dishes.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout her long life, Dendel transformed those patterns and
designs into artistic crafts--making pottery, creating mosaics,
weaving tapestries, designing and stitching quilts.</LD>
<LD>   Esther Dendel, who with her husband, Jo Dendel, created and
operated Denwar Studios in Costa Mesa for more than 55 years, died
Saturday of illnesses associated with aging. She was 92.</LD>
<TE>   Dendel died at the home she and her husband handcrafted beside
their studio when Costa Mesa was little more than rabbit patches.</TE>
<TE>   An eclectic craftswoman and collector, Esther Seitmann Warner
Dendel was also a respected teacher and author of 13 books. Known in
recent decades for teaching in her own studio, she also conducted
classes at high schools in Iowa, the University of Minnesota, Orange
Coast College and UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Dendel's books were divided about equally between craft textbooks
and accounts of her life in Liberia during World War II, where her
former husband was employed on a Firestone rubber plantation.</TE>
<TE>   Born near Laurel, Iowa, on Feb. 2, 1910, Esther Seitmann began her
education in a one-room school a long walk from home. An avid 4-H
member from age 10 and statewide 4-H girls' president at 17, she
interrupted her time at the University of Iowa to spend six years
teaching home arts and crafts in Appalachian West Virginia during the
Depression.</TE>
<TE>   That helped her adapt to rural Africa, where she twice walked
across Liberia to study the crafts and absorb the culture in small
villages. To finance her explorations, she collected, trained and
sold small chimpanzees to a Florida animal farm.</TE>
<TE>   She came to view Africa as "my homeland of the spirit." To gain
entree among the wary villagers, she used a simple piece of yarn.</TE>
<TE>   "I would sit in the dust, playing with the yarn and arranging it
into designs on the ground," she told The Times in 1969, describing
how first the children would gather to kibitz and then adults. "Soon
we were all friends, and the string did it."</TE>
<TE>   Dendel later converted her 1941-44 African diaries into half a
dozen books--one describing the culture in "New Song in a Strange
Land," another her adventures with the chimps in "Seven Days to
Lomeland" and a third her friendship with a young black nurse in the
novel "The Silk Cotton Tree." After a return trip several years
later, she described the custom of buying and selling little girls in
a dowry system--the Dendels "bought" a child who went on to become a
Liberian official--in her book "The Crossing Fee."</TE>
<TE>   While in Africa, the woman then named Esther Warner also
maintained a studio, inviting anybody interested to stop by and paint
or carve. One visitor was Jo Dendel, a photographer, carver and
sketch artist. They worked well together and talked about opening a
studio together.</TE>
<TE>   She returned to teach at the University of Minnesota, and he
served in the Navy, but by 1946 they were both in Costa Mesa,
converting a small garage into Denwar Studios. The name was a
combination of their surnames--Dendel and Warner, the name of her
then ex-husband.</TE>
<TE>   The Dendels married in 1950, and their shared goal was to make a
living from their crafts. Their first product was
ceramics--dinnerware sold all over the U.S. and Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   When Japanese competition increased in the mid-1950s, the Dendels
switched to mosaics. Some of their resulting work is displayed in the
Orange Central Library.</TE>
<TE>   By 1967, the Dendels had moved into fiber arts--spinning, dyeing,
weaving, knitting, crocheting, creating rugs and tapestries and
baskets. They taught individuals, organized a weekly Dendel Craft
Fellowship and staged annual crafts fairs in their growing studio and
home.</TE>
<TE>   Their own well-respected crafts collection has lent pieces to the
Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of her own economic struggles to get an education--a
master's degree at Columbia University as well as the Iowa
bachelor's--Dendel years ago organized an annual scholarship for
creative artists or craftspeople. She personally created quilts and
other items to sell at annual fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   Jo Dendel, who survives his wife, has asked that any memorial
donations be made to that Dendel Scholarship Fund at Denwar Studios,
236 E. 16th St., Costa Mesa, CA 92627.</TE>
<TE>   Services and burial will be in Laurel, Iowa.</TE>

<HD>Test Scores Rise; Goals Still Unmet</HD>
<DH>Schools: Despite fourth year of Stanford 9 gains, most
students don't meet state's tough standards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's public schools have raised their scores on a nationally
standardized test for a fourth straight year, but most students have
not mastered the more rigorous lessons the state says they need to
learn, according to statistics released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Only one-third of the state's students are proficient in reading,
math, history and science as defined by California's tough new
academic standards.</LD>
<LD>   The gap between what students are supposed to know and what they
do know is larger in urban school systems such as the Los Angeles
Unified School District, where a mere 16% of sixth-graders met the
state standards in reading and writing this year--even as their
scores rose on the national Stanford 9 test.</LD>
<TE>   "This is no time to pop a champagne cork, but all children are
showing improvement, regardless of race, income or family
background," said Gov. Gray Davis, who had vowed not to seek
reelection in November unless scores on the Stanford 9 tests rose.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 4.6 million California students in grades 2 to 11 took two
sets of exams this spring: the Stanford 9, which compares them to a
national sample, and companion tests that judge how well they
understand the reading, math and other material the state wants them
to know.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and other state leaders expressed satisfaction with the
improving Stanford 9 scores, even if the rise this year was modest.
According to a Los Angeles Times analysis, those results showed that
45% of students statewide are at or above the national average in
reading and 55% in math. That continues four years of gains: up 2.1
percentage points in math and 0.7 point in reading since last year
and 12.6 points in math and 5.6 points in reading since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, state officials said schools need to focus more
on meeting state standards in reading, math, history and science and
teach the detailed sets of knowledge those entail.</TE>
<TE>   Just 33% of California students were at or above the proficiency
level in English-language arts this year and 35% in math. Proficiency
means students are acquiring skills that will ready them for a
four-year university.</TE>
<TE>   Some schools have a long way to go.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it heartbreaking? It definitely is," said Irene
Herrera-Stewart, who oversees instruction in several South Los
Angeles high schools, about the results at Locke High, where as few
as 3% of students are proficient readers under the state goals.</TE>
<TE>   Educators said they expected the subpar performance on the state
standards because California has set guidelines that are among the
toughest in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "The bar has been raised at every grade level. That would suggest
in the opening years we wouldn't expect to see big gains," said Bruce
Fuller, co-director of Policy Analysis for California Education, a
think tank at UC Berkeley and Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Officials noted, however, that the English results were slightly
better than a year ago, which was the first time such proficiency
levels were measured. (Similar levels in math, history and science
were added this year.)</TE>
<TE>   And fewer elementary students landed in the very lowest
performance rungs--"below basic" and "far below basic"--this year
compared with last year in English-language arts.</TE>
<TE>   "The gap between high-and low-achieving students is wide but
shrinking," said Delaine Eastin, state superintendent of public
instruction. "That's significant."</TE>
<TE>   The standards scores are especially significant because, starting
next year, they will serve as the primary way to evaluate
California's 8,000 schools.</TE>
<TE>   Those and the new Stanford 9 scores arrive at a time when school
districts face increasing pressure to demonstrate success.</TE>
<TE>   Schools that significantly raise their scores can win cash
rewards. Those that fail to improve can face sanctions, possibly
having teachers and administrators transferred or school doors closed
altogether.</TE>
<TE>   The state results, released over the Internet (at
star.cde.ca.gov), reveal several trends since the Stanford 9 was
first given in the spring of 1998:</TE>
<TE>   * The statewide achievement gap between poor and affluent students
in reading and math has widened in every grade over the last five
years, a pattern repeated in Los Angeles County and Los Angeles
Unified, according to The Times' analysis.</TE>
<TE>   * Elementary schools have driven the annual test score increases,
with second-and third-graders earning the best marks and the biggest
gains. Some experts attribute that to smaller classes, better teacher
training and more structured reading and math programs in those lower
grades. Middle schools have made smaller improvements, while high
school performance has remained essentially flat.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified, in particular, has posted large annual
Stanford 9 testing gains in elementary schools that have outpaced the
state as a whole. For example, 44% of second-graders in the district
performed at or above the national average in reading on the Stanford
9, compared with 34% the year before. In math, 39% of L.A. Unified
sixth-graders were at or above the national average, a rise of four
points from 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Coldwater Canyon Elementary in North Hollywood experienced
increases of 30 points in Stanford 9 reading scores and 36 points in
math over the past five years--even though all of its students are
poor enough to qualify for subsidized lunches.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an attitude where we believe that even poor children can
do just as well as kids in Beverly Hills or Bel Air," said Assistant
Principal Burt Govenar.</TE>
<TE>   But only about one-quarter of Coldwater students were deemed
proficient by the state's measure in English-language arts.</TE>
<TE>   District officials acknowledge a poor showing overall on
thestandards tests, saying overcrowded schools attended by large
numbers of low-income students with limited English proficiency have
more ground to make up than those in more affluent and suburban
areas. Officials also said their schools must do a better job of
incorporating the state's standards into classroom lessons.</TE>
<TE>   "That piece is a pretty new thing to us," said Caprice Young, the
Los Angeles Board of Education president. "It's only in the last year
that we have focused on teaching the standards."</TE>
<TE>   Academic standards in English-language arts and math were
introduced in California's classrooms about four years ago. Standards
in other subjects have been subsequently adopted by the state.</TE>
<TE>   But those guidelines have been slow to make their way into
classrooms as schools focused their energy on mastering the Stanford
9--until recently the only factor in the state's evaluation of
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with the standards taking a more prominent role in
California's school accountability system, administrators and
teachers say they are paying attention.</TE>
<TE>   "We teach and believe in the standards--that curriculum is the
bible for us," said Principal Carolyn Horsley of Imperial Elementary
School in Downey. "It's an area where we see plenty of room for
improvement."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday morning, Horsley dug into a school closet for several
large posters from last fall. The posters listed--in excruciating
detail--the strengths and weaknesses of Imperial students on last
year's exams. Five years ago, 51% of the school's students were at or
above the national average in reading. Today, that figure is 76%. In
math, 77% of the students are at or above the national average, up
two percentage points since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday was devoted to updating and creating new lists of
strengths and weaknesses--as the teachers pored over how their
students did on each individual section of the test.</TE>
<TE>   On the list of strengths: word analysis, phonics and reading
comprehension. But the list of "Things to Work on" also grew:
multisyllabic words, prefixes and suffixes.</TE>
<TE>   The Stanford 9 "is not a real concern for us," Horsley told the
teachers. "We want to look more at the [state] standards. That's
going to be our focus."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers at Lawndale High School make printouts of the state
standards and hand them out to their students, requiring them to keep
a copy in their notebooks.</TE>
<TE>   "Students have to understand why they're learning something," said
Principal Sonja Davis, who added that her school's entire curriculum
is aligned with the state guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "When we go into classrooms we expect to see ... which standards
are being taught that day," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the message has taken hold with teachers, it apparently
has yet to reverberate with students.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the students just think it's another test and it doesn't
really matter," said sophomore Crystal Clark, 15. "They think if it's
not the SAT, they can say, 'Whatever,' and forget about it."</TE>
<TE>   Lawndale has a long way to go: Just 14% of its students met the
state's English and math standards this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're improving," said Julian Lopez, superintendent of the
Centinela Valley Union High School District. "It's beginning to creep
up, and I think eventually we're going to get there."</TE>
<TE>   Staff writers Steve Chawkins, Erika Hayasaki, Joe Mathews, Solomon
Moore, Jon Ortiz, David Pierson and Daniel Yi and Richard O'Reilly,
director of computer analysis, and data analyst Sandra Poindexter
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Windfall to Some, Legacy Lost to Others</HD>
<DH>Alaska: A village decides to cash out its Native Claims
funds, depleting an asset that 'was supposed to last several
lifetimes,' one man says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE</DL>
<LD>In a tiny storm-battered fishing village on Kodiak Island, the native
residents are about to get rich.</LD>
<LD>   Their village corporation today is sending $100,000 to every
shareholder--147 people in all--as it cashes out of the bulk of a
$36-million trust built from the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.
In January, each shareholder gets another $100,000.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the chance of a lifetime," says John Yakanak, a
33-year-old fisherman from Kodiak City, across the island from the
village of Akhiok. He sees the money as a way to launch his own
business in sport fishing or outdoor guides.</LD>
<TE>   But in Akhiok, a lonely collection of 34 modest homes on the edge
of the Gulf of Alaska, Mayor Diana Simeonoff worries about the
repercussions from all that money.</TE>
<TE>   The average income in town is about $33,400, most of it from
government work and seasonal jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Simeonoff fears that native elders--Akhiok is predominantly
Alutiiq, or Russian Aleut--will be taken advantage of by people who
want to get at the money. But most of all, she worries that people
will now move away and take their children from the village.</TE>
<TE>   "Our school has only 12 students right now," she said. "If it
falls below 10 students, there will be no school. It will be shut
down."</TE>
<TE>   The distribution from the fund, Akhiok Kaguyak Inc., will be the
largest single cash payout to individual shareholders of the more
than 200 regional and village native-owned corporations created by
Congress through the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.</TE>
<TE>   The 1971 law authorized the corporations to select 44 million
acres of land and gave more than $960 million to the corporations as
compensation for the loss of lands historically held.</TE>
<TE>   The Akhiok fund was created by the sale of 77,000 acres to the
Exxon Valdez Trustee Council in 1995 to be maintained as wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   This month, 79% of the shareholders voted to liquidate $31 million
of the trust--leaving $5 million in an investment fund for future
generations, fund chairwoman Pauline O'Brien said.</TE>
<TE>   They narrowly rejected a move to liquidate the entire account.</TE>
<TE>   "This means, for many shareholders, an opportunity to establish
their own businesses, to buy their own homes, to send their kids to
college," O'Brien said.</TE>
<TE>   Akhiok Kaguyak has sponsored investment workshops for the
shareholders, many of whom live in Anchorage, Kodiak City and
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska state troopers from Kodiak City visited village leaders
this week to discuss possible problems.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone in the tiny village of 80 residents is happy.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Eluska said he resigned his corporate presidency last spring
when the seven-member board made it clear it favored cashing out
instead of continuing to pay $1,000-a-month dividends to
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "That asset was supposed to last several lifetimes," Eluska said.
"It's not right for the current generation to benefit at the expense
of those not yet born.</TE>
<TE>   "By cashing out, the legacy is gone."</TE>
<TE>   But Yakanak sees the money as fuel for shareholders to build their
own legacies.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska residents also get an annual check averaging $1,800 from
the state's Permanent Fund, which pays dividends from state oil
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "Who better to take care of my future generations than myself,
rather than a bunch of corporation investors?" Yakanak said. "The
dividends were good money but not enough to back something like a
business venture.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an opportunity to make a better life for me, my wife and
two kids."</TE>

<HD>Most of Amtrak's Speed Fleet Won't Make Holiday</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Despite round-the-clock repair work, Amtrak enters the long Labor Day
weekend--traditionally one of its busiest--with more than half its
high-speed Acela Express fleet still out of service.</LD>
<LD>   Seven of the trains will be available to carry passengers in
Amtrak's Northeast Corridor over the holiday weekend, compared with
15 on a normal day, Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black said Thursday. The
passenger railroad will continue to press additional conventional
trains into duty.</LD>
<LD>   Amtrak began this week with five of the high-speed trains in
service and added two on Wednesday. The seven trains made a total of
23 departures from Boston, New York and Washington on Thursday,
compared with 50 on a typical weekday.</LD>
<TE>   Temporary repairs continue on cracks discovered on and near
shock-absorbing assemblies that keep the locomotives from swaying at
high speeds.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the cracking, and a permanent fix for the trains,
remain the subject of talks among Amtrak, federal railroad officials
and the companies that built the trains, Montreal-based Bombardier
Transportation of North America and Alstom Ltd. of France.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the trains that have returned to service are undergoing
an intensified inspection and repair program. "We are seeing new
cracking on some pieces of equipment, and what we do then is simply
repair them," Black said.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Amtrak will need to rotate the trains back out of
service for permanent repairs. If certain assemblies broke loose,
they could damage or derail a moving train.</TE>
<TE>   Acela Express is Amtrak's premier service, capable of reaching 150
mph and offering comforts not found on other Amtrak trains. It's also
an important moneymaker for Amtrak, which has struggled financially
throughout its three-decade existence.</TE>
<TE>   If there was a silver lining for Amtrak, it was that the Acela
Express problem was discovered in August, a slow time for business
travel. But now, the repair work is stretching through a busy travel
weekend and into September.</TE>
<TE>   Another potentially important upcoming day for Amtrak service is
Sept. 11, the anniversary of the terrorist attacks. Several major
airlines say they are cutting back their flights based on weak
bookings that day.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak owns 18 Acela Express trains.</TE>

<HD>Officials Prepare to Check for Anthrax</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: FBI will compare samples at Florida building
with those in Washington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOCA RATON, Fla.</DL>
<LD>FBI agents and scientists ran through decontamination drills Thursday
before a planned search of the quarantined headquarters of the
National Enquirer for clues in last year's anthrax attack.</LD>
<LD>   The teams planned to enter the building today of tabloid publisher
American Media Inc. to take thousands of samples and search for the
letter or package that brought anthrax spores into the property,
killing a photo editor.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI wants to compare the samples to the anthrax-tainted
letters mailed last fall to the Washington offices of U.S. Sens.
Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.).</LD>
<TE>   The fenced-off parking lot, mostly vacant since the publisher's
headquarters was quarantined Oct. 7, is filled with mobile police
units, tents, trailers and a row of portable toilets.</TE>
<TE>   In the decontamination drills, workers in white protective suits,
boots and air masks are washed with a bleach mixture after they drop
off tools and samples, police Cmdr. Maria Maughan said. The air
inside the tent surrounding them is monitored for signs of anthrax.</TE>
<TE>   Photo editor Bob Stevens, 63, died and a mailroom employee was
hospitalized for weeks in the nation's first anthrax attack. Anthrax
also was sent through the mail to media outlets in New York and a
congressional building in Washington, killing four others and
sickening more than a dozen people.</TE>
<TE>   After it was quarantined, American Media leased nearby offices to
publish its six tabloids, including the Enquirer, Globe and Weekly
World News.</TE>

<HD>Bloomberg Must Sell $45 Million in Stocks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg must sell at least $45 million in publicly
traded stock and his interest in a hedge fund to comply with the
city's conflict-of-interest laws, a panel ruled Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Conflict of Interest Board ruled that Bloomberg's stake in
companies that do business with the city violated the City Charter.
The mayor was ordered to sell his holdings in about 95 publicly
traded stocks within 90 days.</LD>
<LD>   "Because Mr. Bloomberg owns his stock directly and not, for
example, through a mutual fund, because many of the firms in his
portfolio have business dealings with the city's executive branch,
and because of the size of his holdings, many of Mr. Bloomberg's
stock ownership interests violate" the City Charter, the report says.</LD>
<TE>   After he was elected last year, Bloomberg resigned as chief
executive officer of Bloomberg L.P., the financial services
information company he founded. The mayor is estimated to be worth
more than $4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   After he sells his stock, the board will allow Bloomberg to invest
his holdings in "large, highly diversified mutual funds ... managed
by money managers with whom he has no relationships." He is likely to
donate a large chunk of the proceeds to charity, aides say.</TE>
<TE>   The board also ruled that the mayor can keep his ownership stake
in Bloomberg L.P., but must not involve himself as mayor with issues
that concern Merrill Lynch, which has a 20% stake in the company.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg spokesman Ed Skyler said the mayor would comply with the
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "As he's said many times before, the mayor will abide by the
ruling of the Conflict of Interest Board," said Skyler.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg's potential conflicts represented an unprecedented
situation for the city's ethics watchdogs. The city had never elected
a mayor so wealthy and with so many investments and business
relationships with the city's top companies.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg refuses to disclose exactly how much money he has
invested in public stocks. But as of Dec. 31, he owned shares in 85
stocks with a value of at least $500,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   The companies include Dow Jones, AOL Time Warner, Bear Stearns,
Citigroup, Costco, Ethan Allen, JP Morgan Chase, Waste Management,
Starwood Hotels and Boston Properties.</TE>

<LD>Lance Bass of the pop group 'N Sync promised to sing aboard the
international space station when he visits this fall.</LD>
<LD>   But don't expect any cosmic concerts. Bass, 23, says it's all for
education's sake.</LD>
<LD>   He told reporters in Houston the point of the adventure is to
inspire kids to become astronauts, scientists, or anything--no matter
how difficult or seemingly impossible.</LD>
<TE>   Bass' participation sets a couple of records: He will be the
youngest space traveler and the first graduate of space camp--which
he attended in Florida 10 years ago--to make it to space.</TE>
<TE>   The singer also set a space program record for the most frequent
use of the word "amazing"--41 times, by NASA's count. According to
Bass, it's been an amazing week at NASA with an amazing space crew
and an amazing international mission. "It's going to be amazing," he
added.</TE>

<HD>Vacationing Bush Makes Time for 2 Fund-Raisers</HD>
<DH>Politics: He brings in $1.1 million for coffers of GOP
candidates, talks up his education policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LITTLE ROCK, Ark.</DL>
<LD>President Bush interrupted his ranch vacation one more time Thursday
for the business of the presidency: two Republican fund-raisers and,
just as closely tied to the autumn elections, a reminder to voters
that his education policies are taking hold in the classroom.</LD>
<LD>   The president spoke at a fund-raising luncheon for two Republicans
in Oklahoma and at a dinner in Arkansas, bringing in more than $1
million. In between, he visited the Parkview Arts/Science Magnet High
School in Little Rock, announcing a pilot plan under which five
states will receive federal help to improve curriculums designed to
better prepare students for college or technical school.</LD>
<LD>   Bush has regularly left his ranch during his August vacation to
keep his presidency in the public eye, to summon public patience for
the war against terrorism--and, lately, to draw new attention to the
dangers he says are posed by Iraq under President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<TE>   And as much as he has sought to keep his political agenda at the
front of public debate, Bush has also left Texas to speak at
Republican Party events geared to the immediate needs of GOP
candidates this November. When the sums are totaled for his
fund-raising efforts this month, it has been an $8.6-million
vacation.</TE>
<TE>   The races in Oklahoma, where Rep. Steve Largent is running to
replace incumbent Republican Gov. Frank Keating, and Sen. James M.
Inhofe, a Republican, is seeking a second term, appear to pose no
particular challenge for the GOP candidates.</TE>
<TE>   But in Arkansas, a recent poll shows Sen. Tim Hutchinson, a
Republican, trailing Atty. Gen. Mark Pryor, a Democrat and the
politically moderate son of a popular former governor and senator,
David Pryor.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Bob Smith in New Hampshire, Hutchinson is considered
the Republican senator most at risk of losing reelection in November.
Arkansas will be in the spotlight during the autumn campaign that
will determine whether Democrats retain control of the Senate, where
they now have a one-vote edge.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas, long considered safe territory for Democrats, has
largely turned Republican in the post-Bill Clinton era. Since Clinton
was elected to the presidency in 1992, the state has elected a
Republican governor, a Republican senator and supported Bush over Al
Gore, 51% to 46%, in the 2000 election.</TE>
<TE>   But Hutchinson alienated some conservative Christian supporters
when he divorced his wife and married one of his aides. His brother,
Asa, now the head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, was a
member of the team in the House of Representatives pressing Clinton's
impeachment during the scandal involving ex-White House intern Monica
S. Lewinsky.</TE>
<TE>   With most political fund-raising complete, Bush is likely to shift
his attention in September and October to rallying voters to turn out
for Republican candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The fund-raising events brought in $500,000 in Oklahoma and
$600,000 in Arkansas, Scott McClellan, deputy White House press
secretary, said. Because the White House added the speech on
education to Bush's travel schedule, the federal government shares
the costs of Bush's day with the political campaigns he is
supporting.</TE>
<TE>   McClellan said the education program would make $2.4 million
available for the five states accepted in the program. Arkansas has
been chosen to take part, Bush announced here. The other states have
not been selected.</TE>
<TE>   The program, built on one begun in Texas, involves local
businesses and schools teaming up to challenge students into pursuing
rigorous academic courses, the president said.</TE>
<TE>   ''It is an effective way to spread the word to parent and student
alike that if you're interested in your future, raise the bar, take
the toughest courses,'' Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He urged students to reject the notion that pursuing tough courses
''will make you a nerd.''</TE>
<TE>   The president used the opening of schools around the country to
promote the education legislation he signed at the beginning of this
year.</TE>
<TE>   The measure is intended to toughen standards for teachers and,
through increased testing of students, provide greater accountability
of school systems to local communities.</TE>
<TE>   ''If you set the bar low, that's exactly what you're going to get.
You're going to get mediocrity,'' he said, bending low and placing
his hand beneath the shelf of his lectern.</TE>
<TE>   The president made only passing reference to the tensions with
Iraq, leaving Vice President Dick Cheney--for the second time this
week--to lay out the administration's rationale for seeking to remove
Hussein's regime. Cheney presented those arguments, first made Monday
at the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Nashville, to another
veterans group in San Antonio on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   At the Hutchinson fund-raiser, Bush noted only that ''we've got a
lot of pressure we can bring to bear.... We will not allow those
tyrants to hold the United States and our friends and allies
blackmailed with weapons of mass destruction.''</TE>
<TE>   In Oklahoma, as he does routinely in political speeches, he
saluted the spouses of the candidates he was supporting, saying:
''All of us up here on this stage married above ourselves.''</TE>
<TE>   He made no such remark in Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   The president returned to his ranch near Crawford, Texas, after
the speeches here. He plans to end his nearly four-week stay at the
weekend, returning to the White House Sunday before making a Labor
Day speech on Monday in Pennsylvania.</TE>

<HD>Hawaiian Church Loses a Round in Its Battle to Expand</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge does not order Maui County to OK project and
leaves key issues undecided.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Hawaii has refused to order the island of Maui to
allow the controversial expansion of a church in a rural agricultural
neighborhood--one of a growing number of cases involving the rights
of churches confronted with often-prohibitive local land-use
restrictions.</LD>
<LD>   In a ruling late Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Samuel P. King in
Honolulu said the Hale O Kaula Church first must determine whether
Maui County has prohibited the congregation from conducting religious
services on the 5.8-acre property, or whether it is simply
prohibiting the church from expanding its buildings on the site.</LD>
<LD>   The court left undecided the most important legal issues of the
case, involving the applicability of a 2-year-old federal law that
prevents government regulators from imposing a "substantial burden"
on religious exercise through zoning laws and other land-use
restrictions.</LD>
<TE>   The Hale O Kaula case has attracted attention across the country,
in part because neighbors' opposition to the church expansion focused
not only on traffic, water and safety issues but on questions about
the nature of the church and its members.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington-based Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which
joined the church in seeking the preliminary injunction, argued that
the county's failure to allow the church to expand on its property
was an unconstitutional restriction on the congregation's freedom to
worship.</TE>
<TE>   The 60-member Hale O Kaula congregation currently meets at a small
building in the town of Haiku, several miles away from the
agricultural property. The facility is too small, and church leaders
bought the property near Kula several years ago with the hope of
building a larger facility and implementing the church's agricultural
ministry.</TE>
<TE>   The church follows the Joseph Ministry, which Pastor David Jenkens
said encompasses restoring the Earth "to its natural condition, as
close to what God had created as is physically possible."</TE>
<TE>   "The land itself is an absolutely necessary aspect of our
religious expression.... Our ideal is to grow as much of our own food
as possible, and prepare and eat many of our meals together," he
said. Church officials argued that such a mission was not
inconsistent with the agricultural zoning on the property.</TE>
<TE>   But neighbors objected. The property lies at the end of a short
paved road in the Maui hill country, far from most waterlines.
Residents and county officials said the church would bring increased
traffic and could present a fire safety problem because of the
unavailability of water.</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling, King did not address the constitutional issues but
said the church and the county first should determine whether the
church is permitted to hold worship services in the house and small
barn that stand on the property.</TE>
<TE>   If the county denies that, then the court can look at that as well
as the expansion issue, the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkens said the county already has denied the church permission
to conduct worship services. "They've told us we can't even
occasionally put up a tent and worship on the property," Jenkens
said. "I guess what [the judge] is saying is, we have to ask them
again."</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Takayesu, corporate counsel for Maui County, said the
county has never ruled directly on that issue. "They've never been
told that they can't pray over their crops, or they can't have prayer
meetings there occasionally," she said. "They were requesting
additional construction, and that kind of thing."</TE>
<TE>   She said the county likely will ask the judge to issue a summary
judgment on the legal issues, a move that could lead to a final
decision within a few months.</TE>

<HD>Case for Executing Juveniles Who Kill May Be Weakening</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Death penalty opponents, encouraged that three Supreme Court justices
are ready to consider limiting capital punishment, said Thursday they
were hopeful the execution of a Texas man who committed murder when
he was a teenager might be the last of its kind.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very heartening," said David Elliot of the National
Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. "It shows there is a growing
momentum to address this issue, even though it came too late for
Toronto Patterson," the Dallas man who was put to death Wednesday for
shooting three of his relatives when he was 17.</LD>
<LD>   "We are in the last days of the death penalty for juveniles,"
predicted professor Victor Streib, dean of Ohio Northern University
Law School. "Texas is the only jurisdiction in the nation, really the
only jurisdiction in the world, carrying out these executions. And
one rogue state shouldn't be allowed to continue it."</LD>
<TE>   Thanks in part to recent Supreme Court rulings, optimism has
surged through the ranks of the anti-capital punishment movement this
year.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the high court voted to end executions of mentally
retarded killers, saying that the nation and the world had come to
view the practice as cruel and unusual punishment. The 6-3 majority
pointed to a wave of state laws exempting retarded people from the
ultimate punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Hours before Patterson received the lethal injection, Justice John
Paul Stevens, the author of the court's opinion concerning the
mentally retarded, said he and his colleagues should consider a
similar ban for juvenile murderers.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the apparent consensus that exists among the states and in
the international community against the execution of a capital
sentence imposed on a juvenile offender, I think it would be
appropriate to revisit the issue at the earliest opportunity,"
Stevens wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer issued a short
statement saying they agreed with Stevens.</TE>
<TE>   It takes the votes of four justices to hear a case, and five to
make a majority. In late September, when the justices meet to
consider appeals that arrived during the summer recess, they will
have before them several cases from death row inmates who were
juveniles at the time of their crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a matter of time," said Richard Dieter, executive
director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington. "The
missing element is a few more states to abolish it on their own. And
that should be enough to get one or two more justices to weigh in."</TE>
<TE>   California sets 18 as the minimum age for an offender to be
eligible for the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of capital punishment say the current system allows
juries to consider the issue on a case-by-case basis.</TE>
<TE>   "Some 17-year-olds are just as mature as a 25-year old," said
Dudley Sharp of Justice for All, a pro-death penalty group based in
Houston. "The jury should look at the individual situation and make
the decision."</TE>
<TE>   In all death penalty cases, the defense can point to the
murderer's youth as a reason for granting mercy.</TE>
<TE>   "States have a right to decide how they are going to punish
coldblooded killers," said Michael Rushford, president of the
Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for the mentally retarded built momentum for their cause
over the last decade. They persuaded lawmakers in 18 states to exempt
mentally retarded defendants from capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>   They argued that retarded people often lack the ability to control
their impulses and to foresee the consequences of their actions. For
that reason, they argued, these defendants do not fit in the category
of the most culpable killers.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court adopted that view and said the nation's
"evolving standard of decency" called for sparing defendants who are
mentally retarded.</TE>
<TE>   In the coming year, death penalty opponents hope to build the same
momentum for exempting teenage murderers. They say lawmakers in at
least 10 more states will be pressed to raise the minimum age to 18
for a capital punishment case.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 38 states authorize the death penalty, and 22 of them
allow it to be imposed on those who commit murder while under age 18.
But such death sentences are rare.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, about 3,700 convicted murderers are condemned to
death. Among these, 80 were under 18 when they committed their
crimes, about 2% of the total.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a good number of states where this legislation stands a
good chance of moving this year," Dieter said. "And there is a signal
being sent [by the Supreme Court] that they should act."</TE>
<TE>   Executions of juvenile killers are rarer yet. In the last decade,
16 people have been put to death for murders they committed when they
were age 16 or 17. And of those, 10 of the executions took place in
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the United States, only Congo, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi
Arabia and Yemen say they have carried out executions of teenage
murderers, according to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death
Penalty. Yemen and Pakistan recently announced they were ending the
practice.</TE>
<TE>   The leaders of the European Union had strongly urged Texas Gov.
Rick Perry to spare the life of Patterson, despite the brutality of
his crime.</TE>
<TE>   On a June day in 1995, Patterson went to the home of a cousin,
apparently intent on stealing the gold and chrome wheels on her BMW.
Shot dead in the living room were Kimberly Brewer and her two
children, ages 6 and 3.</TE>
<TE>   In his final statement, Patterson, who was 24 when he died and
denied committing the crime, said he was "sorry for the pain" that he
caused his family and friends.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Plan to Limit Flights on Sept. 11 Is Dropped</HD>
<DH>Security: Amid industry criticism, officials say effort to
bar private and foreign-owned aircraft from crash sites was probably
illegal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Bush administration officials scrambled Thursday to disavow and then
undo proposed air travel restrictions for the Sept. 11 anniversary
and, with commemorative events less than two weeks away, said broader
security plans have not been finalized.</LD>
<LD>   Stung by industry opposition to a proposal to prohibit
foreign-owned airlines and private aircraft from flying into airports
near last year's three crash sites, officials first stressed that no
final decision had been made and then, as the day progressed,
concluded that the singling out of certain aircraft was probably
illegal.</LD>
<LD>   By the end of the day, officials had dropped the proposed
restrictions on foreign-owned airlines but were still considering
limits on general aviation aircraft at airports in and near New York
City, Washington, D.C., and Somerset County, Pa., during certain
periods from Sept. 11 through Sept. 13.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said a plan could be finalized as soon as today.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the interagency flap exposed a security planning
process that is surprisingly incomplete and a group of government
agencies out of step, a rarity in the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   "We constantly review our procedures," said Secret Service
spokesman John Gill, "and we are still in the process of putting
together our plans for [Sept. 11]. Gill said the agency's planning
could not proceed until it received from the White House a fuller
accounting of the president's schedule.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush will attend commemorative events at all three
terrorist crash sites Sept. 11, beginning at the Pentagon before
traveling to Ground Zero in New York City and to a memorial service
in Shanksville, Pa., where United Flight 93 crashed into a field
before it could reach its target.</TE>
<TE>   Temporary airspace restrictions are routine when the president is
traveling on Air Force One. But the Sept. 11 air security plans
developed by a working group of officials from the Federal Aviation
Administration, the Office of Homeland Security, the Defense
Department, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the Secret
Service and the new Transportation Security Administration would go
far beyond the ordinary.</TE>
<TE>   Some individuals familiar with the working group described a clash
of competing priorities. And while several officials pointed fingers
at the FAA, others said the push for tighter airspace restrictions
was driven by the Secret Service and military officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The proposal was a result of consultations," said FAA spokesman
Les Dorr. "We were asked to implement whatever restrictions are
decided on."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the total ban on foreign-owned airlines, business
jets, charters and single-engine planes, the proposal presented
Tuesday to airline industry representatives also would have extended
a restriction now imposed only on flights to and from Reagan National
Airport to Dulles International and Baltimore-Washington airports as
well. Passengers on flights to or from all three airports would not
be allowed to stand or walk about the aircraft cabin for the first 30
minutes after departure or before arrival.</TE>
<TE>   The development of special Sept. 11 security plans is not a
response to specific intelligence information or terrorist threats,
officials at several government agencies said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has not received any specific information suggesting the
possibility of further attacks on Sept. 11, and it did not relay any
recommendation to the TSA to tighten security procedures, according
to an FBI official who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether this is being done out of an abundance of caution or
what, we just don't know," the official said. "But we have not been
advised of any particular [threats]."</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Laird, former security director for Northwest Airlines and
a former Secret Service official, said the government should not
restrict air travel or other routines on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "If you start changing patterns on Sept. 11," he said, "you're
letting [the terrorists] win again. It sends a terrible message. If
security is working, we shouldn't have to change anything."</TE>
<TE>   But it was the proposed Sept. 11 restriction on foreign-owned
airlines that provoked a strong outcry from industry and, according
to a spokesman for British Airways, a disapproving communication from
the British Embassy to the State Department.</TE>
<TE>   Such country-specific travel restrictions, as well as United
States-imposed security measures, are prohibited by both
international and bilateral agreements, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's against the law," acknowledged Lenny Alcivar, spokesman for
the Transportation Department.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal was "premature and inconsistent with the views of the
Bush administration ... a miscommunication by the FAA," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The plans that were presented to us are clearly discriminatory,"
said Wanda Warner, spokeswoman for the International Airline
Transport Assn.</TE>
<TE>   She said: "They invite foreign governments to take retaliatory
action, and they seem to be based on the assumption that foreign
airlines are not as safe as Ameri- can airlines, and that's just not
true."</TE>
<TE>   Ninety-four foreign airlines fly regularly scheduled service to
the United States, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still under consideration is a temporary ban on general aviation
travel in the three areas. In the New York area alone, that could
ground as many as 12,000 corporate jets, said Warren Morningstar,
spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been told of any specific security concerns that
affect these aircraft and not other aircraft," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Violent anniversaries have sometimes brought more carnage--as in
the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, two years after the
siege near Waco, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "As we get closer [to Sept. 11], there will probably be some sort
of intelligence [bulletins] that will go out," warning FBI field
offices to be alert to danger signs, an FBI official said.</TE>

<HD>Judge Hears Case for Harris' Removal From Primary Ticket</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Katherine Harris should be kicked off the ballot for Congress because
the former Florida secretary of state made mistakes in her
resignation and signed an improper oath, her Republican primary
opponent said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   John C. Hill said Harris violated a state law that required her to
file a letter of intent to resign as secretary of state when she
qualified to run for the House of Representatives and signed an oath
saying she had resigned from her old office.</LD>
<LD>   If Harris is disqualified from the Sept. 10 primary, Hill would
win the GOP nomination by default.</LD>
<TE>   Circuit Judge P. Kevin Davey, who heard arguments Thursday, did
not indicate when he would rule on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Harris resigned Aug. 1, saying she had misunderstood the
resignation letter rules. She should have filed a letter July 15
stating her intent to step down before the next Congress takes office
in January, but she didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Hill argued that because Harris continued to work after July 15,
she hadn't resigned and therefore the oath was false.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Harris told Davey her actions result from an oversight
and that she quit her post as soon as she realized the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Harris' attorney, Donna Blanton, said court precedent shows that
when there is doubt about whether a candidate has done everything
technically correct to get on a ballot, the judge should find in
favor of keeping the person on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Hill, a former television anchor, said it is better to resolve the
matter now, rather than having Democrats pursue the issue if Harris
wins the primary.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates hope to succeed GOP Rep. Dan Miller, who is
retiring from the heavily Republican district in Central Florida
after four terms. Four newcomers are seeking the Democratic nod.</TE>

<HD>Man Is Jailed for Hiding HIV From Sex Partner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HURON, S.D.</DL>
<LD>A college student was ordered Thursday to spend 120 days in jail for
having sex with his girlfriend without revealing that he had the AIDS
virus.</LD>
<LD>   Nikko Briteramos, 19, a basketball player at Si Tanka-Huron
University, was the first person convicted in South Dakota of
intentionally exposing someone to HIV. Under a new state law, he
could have faced up to 15 years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Defense lawyer James Koch said Briteramos had been in a monogamous
relationship with the victim for several months. The presentence
report included a letter from the woman urging the judge not to
imprison Briteramos, the lawyer said.</LD>
<TE>   Circuit Judge Tim Dallas Tucker gave Briteramos a five-year
suspended prison sentence and ordered him to spend 120 days in jail.
Briteramos also was ordered not to have unprotected intercourse
without informing sex partners of his HIV and to perform 200 hours of
community service.</TE>
<TE>   Briteramos, of Chicago, apologized Thursday for his behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe I'm capable of much better, and I intend to become a
person who helps others," he said outside the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Briteramos admitted having sex with the woman in his dorm room on
April 13. The woman later tested negative for HIV.</TE>
<TE>   Officials became alarmed in March when three people in Beadle
County, S.D., including Briteramos, were diagnosed with HIV. A fourth
person was later found to have the virus.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, 237 people were tested for the AIDS virus because some
of those who had tested positive for HIV reported having several sex
partners.</TE>
<TE>   Briteramos' plea bargain kept the woman, identified only by the
initials M.T. in court documents, from having to testify, said Mike
Moore, Beadle County state's attorney. He said he thought the
sentence was adequate.</TE>
<TE>   Briteramos apparently was in love with the victim and worried she
would leave him if he told her about his infection, the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   "This appeared to arise out of a loving relationship," Tucker
said. However, he added, "you did expose her to HIV. For a person
that you love, that's not how you treat them."</TE>
<TE>   Tucker also ordered Briteramos to continue his education, adding
that he would be freed from jail to attend classes and work.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Smith, vice president of operations at the university, said
university lawyers will now have to sort out Briteramos' status.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the ruling that education is required, I can't imagine that
we'd turn our backs on him," Smith said.</TE>

<HD>No Arrests Planned in Hoffa Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: Prosecutor says new DNA evidence isn't enough to
bring charges in 1975 disappearance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PONTIAC, Mich.</DL>
<LD>New DNA evidence in the disappearance of ex-Teamsters boss Jimmy
Hoffa 27 years ago is insufficient to bring state criminal charges, a
prosecutor said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "Unfortunately, this has the markings of a great 'whodunit' novel
without the final chapter," Oakland County prosecutor David Gorcyca
said.</LD>
<LD>   Hoffa, father of current Teamsters President James P. Hoffa,
disappeared from the parking lot of the Machus Red Fox restaurant in
Oakland County's Bloomfield Township in July 1975. He was 62.</LD>
<TE>   Gorcyca reviewed a summary of the federal investigation of Hoffa's
suspected slaying. The FBI had in March referred findings from its
probe to county prosecutors for possible state charges. The agency
said no federal charges were planned in what it called a continuing
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We concurred that there is insufficient evidence to authorize the
issuance of warrants at this time," Gorcyca said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the prime suspect remains Charles O'Brien, a former
Hoffa friend. O'Brien has denied any involvement in Hoffa's
disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   FBI scientists used new technology to match the DNA from Hoffa's
hair with that of a strand of hair found in a vehicle driven by
O'Brien on the last day Hoffa was seen alive.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien told investigators in 1975 that he borrowed the car, owned
by the son of reputed Mafia figure Anthony Giacalone, to deliver a
frozen salmon to the home of Robert Holmes, then president of
Teamsters Local 337.</TE>
<TE>   The delivery put O'Brien in the area near the restaurant, where
Hoffa was supposed to meet with Giacalone and New Jersey Teamsters
boss and underworld associate Anthony Provenzano.</TE>
<TE>   A message left Thursday with O'Brien's lawyer seeking comment was
not immediately returned.</TE>

<HD>A Man's Ice House Is His Castle, Minnesota Court Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>The state Supreme Court ruled that fishermen have a reasonable right
to privacy in their ice-fishing huts and conservation officers must
get permission before entering to check for fishing violations.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling, released Thursday, stemmed from an incident in Rice
County, south of here, in which a conservation officer doing a
routine spot check entered an ice-fishing hut and eventually charged
an angler with fishing with an extra line and possession of
marijuana.</LD>
<LD>   Charges were dismissed on the grounds that the officer violated
the man's right to privacy.</LD>
<TE>   "The occupant of a fish house is entitled to the protections
against unreasonable search and seizure afforded by our federal and
state constitutions," Justice Edward Stringer wrote in the court's
unanimous opinion.</TE>
<TE>   During winter, ice houses are common on Minnesota lakes. They
range from simple canvas shacks to several rooms with carpet, beds
and appliances.</TE>
<TE>   While someone is in an ice house, activities of a "personal
nature" take place, therefore that person can reasonably expect
privacy, the court said.</TE>

<HD>Grieving Ore. Town Mourns Loss of 'Two Beautiful Young
Ladies'</HD>
<DH>Tribute: With cards and words of sympathy, slain girls are
honored at packed service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OREGON CITY, Ore.</DL>
<LD>With an old wooden piano set up on the gymnasium floor and the
bleachers pulled all the way out, church members and community
volunteers opened the doors to Oregon City High School on Thursday
evening, letting thousands of mourners in for a tribute to two local
girls.</LD>
<LD>   Ashley Pond and Miranda Gaddis were eighth-graders at Gardiner
Middle School when they vanished last winter. They would have started
ninth grade at the high school next week. Instead, plans were being
made for their funerals.</LD>
<LD>   The girls lived in the same apartment complex; both disappeared on
their way to the same bus stop next to a one-story home rented by an
ex-convict named Ward Weaver.</LD>
<TE>   Ashley vanished Jan. 9. Miranda spent eight weeks helping to look
for her friend, but on March 8, she disappeared as well. The remains
of both girls were discovered last weekend by FBI agents searching
Weaver's backyard. He has not been charged in connection with the
crime, but the district attorney is seeking an indictment against
him.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday night, mourners dropped off cards for the girls'
parents in red plastic Coca-Cola crates as they trooped into the gym,
filling it to capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Swatman, youth and families pastor at Oregon City Christian
Church, was a featured speaker at the service.</TE>
<TE>   "We gather today as a community to mourn their loss and to honor
their young lives," Swatman said. He did not shy away from
allegations that have surfaced in recent weeks that the girls were
victims of sexual abuse before they disappeared. He referred to them
as "two beautiful young ladies who endured so much at such a young
age."</TE>
<TE>   In a town that hadn't seen a homicide since 1993, the girls'
disappearance spooked many families, some of whom moved out of the
apartment complex for fear of a serial kidnapper in the area.</TE>
<TE>   The months wore on, but huge billboards with Ashley's and
Miranda's photographs reminded local residents of their
disappearances. Some people became inured to the signs by early
summer, but concern for the girls was rekindled last weekend when the
FBI got a search warrant for Weaver's house and yard.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours, the searchers had found Miranda's remains, buried
underneath a shed, enclosed in a cardboard box and wrapped in
plastic. The next day, they unearthed Ashley's remains from a sealed
metal drum that had been stashed underneath a concrete slab that
Weaver installed days after Miranda disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon City now awaits charges in the case. Weaver's attorney,
Timothy Lyons, said that if his client is charged, he will ask for a
change of venue. Too many people here, he said, have been influenced
by the girls' disappearances.</TE>

<HD>Osprey Papers Not Altered, Inquiry Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Pentagon investigation found no evidence to back up allegations
that Marines altered records on the crash more than two years ago of
a V-22 Osprey aircraft.</LD>
<LD>   The Defense Department's inspector general was looking into half a
dozen specific charges that information was omitted or removed from
reports concerning testing--and on the April 2000 crash in
Arizona--of the aircraft that takes off like a helicopter and flies
like a conventional airplane.</LD>
<LD>   "The ... investigation found no evidence to support any of the
allegations," Acting Inspector General Charles W. Beardall said in a
report dated Aug. 19 and only released Thursday when requested by
Associated Press.</LD>
<TE>   The allegations were made by a commander who earlier had been
reprimanded for having knowledge of the doctoring of other Osprey
records.</TE>
<TE>   The reviews of the April 8, 2000, crash of the Osprey that killed
19 Marines concluded that human error caused the wreck at a Marana,
Ariz., airport. The tilt-rotor craft has been plagued by equipment
problems and was grounded after a December 2000 crash killed four
more Marines.</TE>
<TE>   Allegations of irregularities in records were made in a December
2001 letter to Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James L. Jones from Lt.
Col. Odin F. Leberman, a former commanding officer who had been
reprimanded in connection with the falsification more than a year
earlier of Osprey records.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps wants the aircraft, which is still in testing, to
replace aging helicopters such as the CH-46 Sea Knight to transport
troops and cargo.</TE>

<HD>Study: African American Wealth Still Trails</HD>
<DH>Finances: A cable network and a consumer group hope to
narrow the gap with a new program, 'Black America Saves.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT PATRICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Although both the income and wealth of black households have been
increasing, they still trail well behind American households as a
whole, a new study shows.</LD>
<LD>   Although black household wealth grew 321% from 1989 to 1998, the
median net wealth of a black household was only $15,500, compared
with $71,700 for all U.S. households, according to an analysis of the
most recent Federal Reserve data on household finances. The study, by
the Consumer Federation of America, defined "net wealth" as assets
minus debts.</LD>
<LD>   To help close that gap, Black Entertainment Television, BET.com
and the Consumer Federation on Thursday announced the establishment
of "Black America Saves," a program offering financial-planning
assistance and education about the importance of savings and home
equity.</LD>
<TE>   The goal of the program is to increase awareness and "emphasize
the importance of black wealth," said Debra L. Lee, president of BET.
The network plans to include a segment on building wealth in its
regular Friday night news show. The home page of BET.com now links to
a page that features news articles, a variety of financial
calculators, a financial quiz and the Black America Saves Club.</TE>
<TE>   Club members will receive a newsletter, savings tips and free
telephone or Internet financial advice. The program is sponsored by
the Bank of America Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Black America Saves is based on America Saves, a campaign to
"encourage nonsaving Americans to build wealth more effectively,"
said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation.</TE>
<TE>   Ronda Welch is a participant in the pilot program of America Saves
in Charlotte, N.C. She recently attained her first financial goal:
saving money to pay cash to have the interior of her house repainted
instead of using a credit card. Now, she is saving for carpet for her
three bedrooms, and her ultimate goal is to pay off her credit card
debt and save for a new car.</TE>
<TE>   The 40-year-old divorced mother of a teen son said the program
"was just a reminder for me, because I was doing a lot of the things
they were pushing." Welch has posted a large sign on her refrigerator
door reading "Ronda Saves," a takeoff on the program's name.</TE>
<TE>   The Consumer Federation's 18-month-old demonstration project in
Cleveland found "tremendous pessimism about being able to build
wealth," Brobeck said.</TE>
<TE>   Working-class Americans "did not think they could do it," he said.
"We found that $1,000 savings seemed to be an insurmountable goal to
many people." Cleveland Saves has signed up 2,000 participants in 18
months, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For all the attention on black households, Brobeck said wealth
disparity is based not on race but on income. Black households are
overrepresented in the lower-income category because of "differences
in income, family inheritance and contributions to dependents,"
according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that lower-income households are less likely to
save, tend to overspend their income and have a shorter financial
"planning horizon."</TE>
<TE>   Just over half as many black households had net wealth of at least
$100,000, as compared with all American households, while almost
twice as many black households had net wealth of less than $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to communicate to middle America, to working-class
America, that they can build wealth as well," Brobeck said. "But one
has to be patient; one has to be smart; one has to be disciplined."</TE>
<TE>   "Over time, it is realistic to expect most low-and moderate-income
families to build six-figure wealth. That is very realistic."</TE>
<TE>   The Consumer Federation based its study on an analysis of 1998
Federal Reserve System data on the consumer finances of 4,000
households conducted by Catherine Montalto of Ohio State University.</TE>

<HD>Wreck of Steamship Lost in 1898 Storm Is Located</HD>
<DH>History: Bound for Maine, the Portland was caught in a
hurricane. Almost 200 people died.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Underwater explorers have located the wreck of a 19th century
steamship that sank in one of the worst hurricanes in New England's
history, taking more than 190 people with it.</LD>
<LD>   The Portland, known as the "Titanic of New England," sank off the
Massachusetts coast Nov. 26, 1898, after it sailed from Boston,
ignoring forecasts of an impending storm.</LD>
<LD>   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced the
wreck was found Thursday in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine
Sanctuary, an area about the size of Rhode Island between Cape Ann
and Cape Cod.</LD>
<TE>   "This discovery closes the chapter on one of the greatest maritime
disasters in New England," said Ben Cowie-Haskell, NOAA's primary
investigator of the Portland expedition.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers were able to identify several distinctive features of
the wreck that prove it's the Portland, Cowie-Haskell said, including
the rudder assembly, paddle guard, wheel hub, and twin side-by-side
smokestacks.</TE>
<TE>   The wreck was discovered in 1989 by two underwater explorers,
Arnold Carr and John Fish, but they could never prove it was the
Portland.</TE>
<TE>   NOAA researchers used sonar equipment and remotely operated
machines to take high-quality video footage of the wreck.</TE>
<TE>   Cowie-Haskell said the ship is sitting upright on the sea floor
with its hull largely intact, though much of the ship above the main
deck is gone.</TE>
<TE>   No bodies or artifacts with the Portland's name on it were found,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cowie-Haskell would not reveal the exact location of the ship.</TE>
<TE>   The 291-foot Portland left Boston's India Wharf for Portland,
Maine, as scheduled, ignoring forecasts of an impending storm and the
decision by the captain of a sister ship to stay in port.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Hollis Blanchard may have believed the Portland could outrun
the gale, but the storm was actually two separate storms that
collided at sea and grew in force. Winds reached 100 mph and waves
crested at 60 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Bodies and wreckage began to wash up on the shores of Cape Cod
shortly after the storm, which eventually became known as the
Portland Storm.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists estimate that 192 passengers and crew died, but no one
really knows how many lives were lost because the only passenger list
went down with the ship. There were only about 40 bodies from the
doomed vessel ever recovered.</TE>
<TE>   The sinking prompted a change in the design of all coastal ships,
from being driven by paddlewheels to propellers.</TE>

<HD>Skakel Gets 20 Years to Life in 1975 Murder of Teen
Neighbor</HD>
<DH>Sentence: A judge says the Kennedy cousin lived a 'lie
about his guilt' in killing Martha Moxley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A Connecticut judge sentenced Michael Skakel to 20 years to life in
prison on Thursday for murdering his 15-year-old neighbor in 1975,
rejecting a rambling, emotional claim of innocence by Skakel and a
handwritten plea for leniency from his aunt, Ethel Skakel Kennedy.</LD>
<LD>   Skakel, 41, was convicted in June of fatally bludgeoning and
stabbing Martha Moxley with a broken golf club in their elite
Greenwich, Conn., neighborhood. Skakel also was 15 at the time of the
slaying, which confounded police for decades and prompted claims that
the Kennedy clan's influence had thwarted investigators.</LD>
<LD>   "I would love to be able to say I did the crime so that the Moxley
family could have peace," Skakel said in state Superior Court in
Norwalk, Conn., taking the stand for the first time. "But to do that
would be a lie." He said he prays for the Moxleys every night.</LD>
<TE>   Moxley's body was discovered on Halloween in 1975 under a tree on
her family's property. She had been beaten so savagely that the golf
club had broken into three pieces. She also had been stabbed in the
neck with the club's shaft.</TE>
<TE>   Judge John F. Kavanewsky Jr. had to follow sentencing guidelines
in effect at the time of the killing. Skakel faced a minimum sentence
of 10 years and a maximum of 25 years to life. By choosing the
20-year sentence, Kavanewsky ensured that Skakel would have to serve
at least 11 1/2 years before becoming eligible for parole.</TE>
<TE>   Kavanewsky said Thursday that he was handing Skakel a "more
substantial sentence" because "for the past 25 years or more ... the
defendant has been living a lie about his guilt. The defendant has
accepted no responsibility, he has expressed no personal remorse."
The judge also denied Skakel bail pending an appeal, saying that the
defendant is "more of a flight risk than ever."</TE>
<TE>   Moxley's mother, Dorthy, stood under her son John's umbrella in a
light rain after the hearing and said she thought that the sentence
was "very reasonable" but that she had hoped to hear Skakel
apologize.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't say he was sorry to us," she said. "I have no doubt
that he's the one who killed Martha."</TE>
<TE>   The two-day sentencing hearing was a pained appraisal of what the
Moxleys had lost in the death of their daughter compared with what
Skakel had contributed in the 27 years since the murder occurred. On
Thursday, as Skakel approached the lectern to testify for the first
time, the courtroom was silent except for the clanking of his leg
irons and a sniffle from one of his relatives.</TE>
<TE>   In an expansive, often religious statement, he talked about
"choosing God's way" in 1985 and devoting his life to helping others
overcome alcohol and drug addictions after he beat his own. He wept
while he recalled trying to explain to his 3-year-old son, George,
that "Daddy was not a bad man."</TE>
<TE>   He spoke of his sense of injustice. "I go to bed and I scream,
'God, I've done everything you've asked; why are you doing this to
me?' "</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors charged that the Skakels' stature and connection to
the Kennedys had prevented a thorough investigation in 1975 and
continued to influence proceedings. On Thursday, the judge was
presented with a handwritten note from Ethel Skakel Kennedy, the
widow of Robert F. Kennedy. "With a heavy heart but with a hope born
of the morning sun," it said, "I write to ask that your compassion
tip the scales in your decision regarding my nephew."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Skakel's cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., had
submitted a longer letter, testifying to Skakel's help in overcoming
his substance abuse problems, and recounting Skakel's maltreatment as
a child by his father, nannies and classmates.</TE>
<TE>   Dorthy Moxley made her own powerful statement in court Wednesday,
saying that she was haunted by the knowledge that her young daughter
died in pain and fear. "Michael Skakel sentenced us to life without
Martha, so I think it's fitting that he is sentenced to life without
his little boy," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The sentencing puts an end to a case that went unsolved for
decades. Early attention focused on Skakel's older brother Thomas,
who had been flirting with Martha and was the last person seen with
her. Suspects also included a tutor who lived with the Skakels, Ken
Littleton, and another neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Attention focused on Michael in the early 1990s after he changed
the story he gave police about the night of the murder when he talked
to private investigators hired in 1992 to clear the Skakels' name. A
series of high profile books, including examinations by Dominick
Dunne and former Los Angeles Police Detective Mark Furhman, stoked
additional interest in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel was arrested in 2000 after an investigation by a one-judge
grand jury. He declared his innocence and lost a fight to have the
case heard in juvenile court. The case was transferred to adult court
in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The conviction was unusual because it was not based on
eyewitnesses or any physical evidence but on testimony from about a
dozen witnesses, such as a family chauffeur who said Skakel was
suicidal after the murder, and classmates at a Maine drug
rehabilitation center who said he confessed.</TE>
<TE>   One witness from the center, Gregory Coleman, had died of heroin
use by the time Skakel's trial began. But prosecutors were permitted
to read Coleman's pretrial testimony into the record, including an
allegation that Skakel once told him: "I'm going to get away with
murder, because I'm a Kennedy."</TE>

<HD>Man Is Guilty of Forcibly Impregnating Stepdaughter</HD>
<DH>Crime: Ohioan used a syringe on teenager, violating rape
laws that he had campaigned for after earlier, unrelated case
involving the girl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AKRON, Ohio</DL>
<LD>A man was convicted Thursday of rape for forcibly impregnating his
then-16-year-old stepdaughter with a syringe, violating rape laws he
had pushed legislators to enact.</LD>
<LD>   After deliberating for just over two hours, jurors found John Goff
guilty of two counts of rape, two counts of sexual battery and one
count of endangering children. He faces up to 35 years in prison at
his Oct. 8 sentencing.</LD>
<LD>   Goff, 41, of Stow, frowned and looked at his family as the verdict
was read. Judge John Adams revoked Goff's bond and he was immediately
handcuffed and led away.</LD>
<TE>   Goff was convicted of breaking the laws that he and his wife
campaigned for in the 1990s after a man accused of molesting his
stepdaughter was acquitted.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers toughened the laws in 1996 to include penetration with
any object as a component of rape. Previously, only sexual
intercourse was considered rape.</TE>
<TE>   Paternity tests showed that Goff fathered his stepdaughter's baby.
The boy, born in 1999, is in foster care.</TE>
<TE>   Goff's wife, Narda, 43, was convicted in March of helping John
Goff impregnate her daughter with a syringe of his semen and was
sentenced to three years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   She refused to testify against her husband.</TE>
<TE>   Narda Goff's attorney argued during the trial that her daughter
willingly allowed the insemination because the mother wanted to give
her husband a child. Narda Goff had a hysterectomy.</TE>
<TE>   The stepdaughter testified on Monday that she agreed to inseminate
herself--but only because Goff, an auxiliary police officer and
former Marine, put a gun to her head and threatened to kill her
mother if she didn't comply.</TE>
<TE>   Brian LoPrinzi, assistant Summit County prosecutor, said the
circumstances of how the stepdaughter, who turns 20 today, became
pregnant are "not only immoral but illegal and disgusting." The
victim has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and
depression and has attempted suicide.</TE>
<TE>   "She knew he was violent and abusive," LoPrinzi said. "She didn't
want to do it, but she didn't even know it was wrong. They asked her,
a girl with a fourth-grade education, to do the unthinkable without
explaining any of the ramifications of having a child."</TE>
<TE>   The Goffs home-schooled the girl after the fourth grade.</TE>
<TE>   In closing statements Thursday, defense lawyer Tim Ivey argued
that Goff did not commit a crime because his stepdaughter agreed to
carry his child.</TE>
<TE>   Ivey told jurors that the girl turned against Goff after the baby
was born and after her new boyfriend pressured her.</TE>

<HD>Japanese Sub Wreck May Offer Clues U.S. Fired First in WWII</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>A Japanese midget submarine sunk before the attack on Pearl Harbor
has been found by researchers who stumbled across the vessel while
doing training dives.</LD>
<LD>   Discovery of the 78-foot submarine Wednesday could provide the
first physical evidence to back U.S. military assertions that it
fired first against Japan in World War II and inflicted the first
casualties.</LD>
<LD>   The sub was sunk by a Navy destroyer on Dec. 7, 1941. The remains
of two Japanese crewmen are believed still inside the submarine.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the shot that started World War II between the Americans and
the Japanese," said John Wiltshire, associate director of the Hawaii
Undersea Research Laboratory, which found the sub.</TE>
<TE>   The two-man submarine was discovered at a depth of 1,200 feet and
a few miles from Pearl Harbor by research craft making test dives, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The sub led four other Japanese midget submarines to Pearl Harbor
to take part in the attack. The newly discovered sub was believed to
be the one sunk by the destroyer Ward more than an hour before the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Wiltshire said the crew is certain that this sub was sunk by the
Ward because of a bullet hole in the conning tower and because it
still has both torpedoes. Three of the subs have been previously
accounted for; the remaining sub had fired both of its weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Until the submarine was found, historian Daniel Martinez said
eyewitness accounts were unconfirmed. Martinez, a historian for the
battleship Arizona Memorial, has interviewed the crew who fired the
first shot, and a pilot who saw the submarine sink.</TE>
<TE>   "What they saw and what they felt was their recollection. Now the
proof has been found," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The submarines' entry into the harbor was followed by the Sunday
morning attack by Japanese planes that lasted two hours and left 21
U.S. ships heavily damaged, 323 aircraft damaged or destroyed, 2,390
people dead and 1,178 others wounded.</TE>
<TE>   "The finding is an important piece of historical evidence because
it backs up Japan's attempt to conduct a surprise attack," said
Yoshiaki Yoshimi, a historian at Tokyo's Chuo University.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Kerby, chief pilot of the deep-diving submersible that found
the submarine, said it was covered in growth but was in excellent
condition.</TE>
<TE>   "To actually come across it was a sobering moment, realizing that
was the shot that started the Pacific war," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kerby and other researchers have been conducting dives in the area
since the 1980s, and they have always known the sub was somewhere out
there.</TE>

<HD>Traficant to Stay on Ballot Despite Expulsion, Prison</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Former Rep. James A. Traficant Jr. will stay on the Nov. 5 election
ballot, even though he has been expelled from the House and is housed
in federal prison, election officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The Trumbull County Board of Elections decided Wednesday not to
remove the expelled congressman from the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutor Dennis Watkins told the board it didn't have the
authority to remove Traficant because the U.S. Constitution grants
citizens the right to vote for and elect whomever they choose.</LD>
<TE>   The only limits set by the Constitution for House members are that
they be at least 25 years old, U.S. citizens and an inhabitant of the
state from which they are elected.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins said Traficant could be considered an Ohio resident
because his wife lives there and his stay in a Pennsylvania prison is
involuntary confinement.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant, 61, was expelled from the House last month and
sentenced to eight years in prison for bribery, racketeering and tax
evasion. The nine-term congressman is an inmate at the
minimum-security Allenwood federal prison in White Deer, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   He petitioned to be on the ballot as an independent in Ohio's
recently redrawn 17th District and vowed to run from prison.</TE>

<HD>Research: HIV No Bar to Organ Transplant Success</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Patients with HIV are successfully receiving liver and kidney
transplants, researchers reported Thursday, challenging widespread
reluctance by transplant centers to give scarce organs to people with
the incurable disease.</LD>
<LD>   The research, presented at a transplant conference in Miami,
offers the latest medical ripple traced to the powerful drugs that
revolutionized AIDS care in the mid-1990s. Because thousands of HIV
patients are living longer with the drugs, some develop organ failure
for other reasons, making them candidates for transplants.</LD>
<LD>   The competition for organs is fierce. More than 80,000 people are
waiting for transplants, and more than 6,000 die each year waiting.
While livers and kidneys are typically given to the sickest patients
waiting, doctors will not give organs to anyone who is too sick to
benefit; in many places, that means anyone who is HIV positive.</LD>
<TE>   Just four or five hospitals offer organs to HIV-positive patients,
with most others arguing that limited organs should be saved for
patients who do not have another disease complicating their chances
for survival. There have also been concerns that drugs that must be
taken after transplants may exacerbate patients' HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Still, an editorial last month in the New England Journal of
Medicine argued that these patients should be considered eligible for
transplants just like other patients who have chronic diseases such
as hepatitis C and diabetes, or older patients, all of whom face
lower long-term survival chances. HIV, they said, is just another
medical factor to consider in the equation.</TE>
<TE>   Others say there isn't enough data on the long-term survival of
patients with HIV to justify taking an organ that would have gone to
an otherwise healthy patient.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true agony for patients on waiting lists, who wonder if
they'll live to get transplanted," said Dr. Marlon Levy, surgical
director for liver and kidney transplantation at Baylor All Saints
Medical Center in Fort Worth, one of the nation's busiest transplant
centers. "It just becomes an almost overwhelming burden to consider
transplantation for someone who has another illness when there are so
many people who don't have those barriers."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the transplants in HIV patients have proved successful,
according to data presented Thursday at the International Congress of
the Transplantation Society, taken from several U.S. centers and one
in France that offer kidneys and livers to HIV-positive patients. A
year or so after their transplants, these patients are just as likely
to survive as other transplant recipients, they said.</TE>

<HD>Voice of America Chief Quits Over Mideast Plans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The director of the Voice of America, Robert Reilly, resigned
Thursday after less than a year in the job, the Broadcasting Board of
Governors said.</LD>
<LD>   VOA sources said the agency had been in turmoil under Reilly's
leadership, particularly over plans to set up new language services
targeted to Middle East audiences but without the "impartiality"
provisions in the VOA charter.</LD>
<LD>   The best known is Radio Sawa in the Middle East, which broadcasts
Arabic and Western popular music interspersed with news bulletins
promoting U.S. views.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. officials have said the station is a great success, but Arab
commentators say they doubt the politically slanted news broadcasts
will have much effect on public opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Reilly took the post in October 2001, immediately after a
controversy over whether VOA should air an interview with Taliban
leader Mullah Mohammed Omar in Afghanistan. VOA eventually broadcast
excerpts, defying the State Department and the Board of Governors.</TE>
<TE>   Reilly had backed the Bush administration's view that VOA should
not air the views of a man with whom the U.S. was about to go to war,
VOA sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Reilly, a former Reagan administration official, was appointed in
October to lead the international broadcasting service in the
aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The new VOA director is David Jackson, who worked for Time
magazine from 1978 until last year.</TE>

<HD>6th Guilty Plea in 1969 Race Riot Killing</HD>
<DH>Courts: The defendant admitted firing shotgun at a car
carrying a young black woman in York, Pa. Four other men still face
murder charges.</DH>

<DL>YORK, Pa.</DL>
<LD>A sixth defendant pleaded guilty to lesser charges Thursday in the
killing of a young black woman during the city's 1969 race riots.</LD>
<LD>   Four other men remain charged with murder in connection with the
shooting of 27-year-old Lille Belle Allen, including former York
Mayor Charlie Robertson, who was a police officer at the time.</LD>
<LD>   Robertson, who is accused of handing out ammunition and
encouraging white gang members to shoot blacks, is scheduled to go to
trial Sept. 23 with two other defendants.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, Arthur Messer- smith pleaded guilty to attempted
murder and conspiracy, admitting in court that he fired a 12-gauge
shotgun at the car Allen was riding in when it entered a white
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking softly, Messersmith said white gang members in the area
had been fired upon the night before, and they were scared when they
saw the Cadillac pull into an intersection and stop.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought we were going to be shot at, so we shot at it," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Messersmith could face up to nine years in prison. Murder charges
were withdrawn in exchange for his plea.</TE>
<TE>   The last of the 10 defendants, Ezra Slick, has admitted shooting
at the car, according to police, and has waived his preliminary
hearing to determine whether enough evidence exists for a trial.</TE>
<TE>   If the judge accepts the six plea agreements, each would face up
to two years in prison instead of the mandatory life sentence a
murder conviction would bring.</TE>
<TE>   Two of them admitted being lookouts for the white gang members who
had gathered on Newberry Street on July 21, 1969, the day Allen was
killed. The others admitted shooting at the white Cadillac carrying
Allen and her sister, parents and brother-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   After Thursday's hearing, Messersmith apologized to the sister,
Hattie Dickson. She said later that she believed the apology was
heartfelt: "When I shook his hand, I felt it. I felt the sorrow."</TE>
<TE>   More than 60 people were injured during the 10-day race riots and
100 people were arrested before the National Guard rolled into town
with tanks. Violence between white and black youths sparked the
riots.</TE>
<TE>   On July 18, the second day of the riots, a white police officer,
Henry Schaad, was fatally shot while patrolling a black neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Two black men charged with his death are awaiting trial.</TE>

<HD>Baby's 'Goo-Goo' a Building Block of Human Speech</HD>
<DH>Science: Infants' babble provides crucial clues into how
children master a language.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Listening to a newborn's plaintive squall, parents hear the hungry
promise of a life to come.</LD>
<LD>   In the babbling that precedes an infant's first halting attempts
to talk, however, scientists are discovering crucial clues to how
children master the languages that connect humans to one another.</LD>
<LD>   A remarkable picture of how infants learn to speak is emerging
from clinical child studies, language surveys and brain imaging, all
colored by the hard-won crib-and-nursery knowledge gathered by
generations of parents.</LD>
<TE>   The newest insight offers clear evidence that the brain has become
specialized for language by the time an infant is 5 months old,
according to a report published today in the journal Science.
Dartmouth College scientists found the clue in the lopsided way an
infant's mouth opens and closes when he or she babbles or smiles.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers Laura-Ann Petitto and Siobhan Holowka analyzed
videotapes of 10 babbling babies from French-or English-speaking
families. They collected 150 examples of facial expressions from each
infant.</TE>
<TE>   When the babies babbled, their mouths always opened more on the
right side. When they made random cooing noises, their mouths always
opened equally on both sides of the mouth. When they smiled, the
mouth opened more on the left.</TE>
<TE>   The expressions revealed the inner workings of the brain animating
the baby's face.</TE>
<TE>   Each side of the face is controlled by a different half of the
brain. The brain's language-related machinery is on the left side of
the brain, which controls the right side of the face. The distinctive
right-side movement of the baby's mouth when it babbled showed that
the brain's left hemisphere was in control, Petitto said.</TE>
<TE>   "The findings were quite compelling," Petitto said, because they
show that the brain has organized itself around language years
earlier than previously believed.</TE>
<TE>   "Babbling is the first step on the road to learning a language,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Noam Chomsky, an influential language theorist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called the finding "eminently
sensible." Cognitive scientist Steven Pinker at MIT said it was
"quite ingenious." And language development expert Paul Bloom at Yale
University said the research demonstrates "there is something in the
brain about language from the start that is special."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the research opens a window into the brain at the very
moment when its cells and synapses are being transformed by the
ability to speak its mind.</TE>
<TE>   So important is human language that the communication centers of
the brain are among the first neural structures to mature, the new
research shows. The compulsion to communicate can spur dramatic
rearrangements in the way a baby's neural circuits function.</TE>
<TE>   In a child's fledgling efforts to talk, scientists can detect an
echo of primitive language skills that humans share with a surprising
range of other creatures, from crickets to chinchillas.</TE>
<TE>   Babies and Tamarin monkeys, for example, share the ability to
discriminate between random noise and human speech in different
languages, even though neither can understand the words it hears,
French and American researchers found.</TE>
<TE>   But no other creature babbles.</TE>
<TE>   In the gurgling nonsense of infant speech, shaped by the unique
biomechanics of the human tongue, throat and jaw, some scientists are
convinced they hear sounds of the first words that evolved when
humanity itself was young.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what the language, baby talk contains four distinct,
universal patterns of vowels and consonants--ma-ma, da-da, ba-ba,
goo-goo--that may have been the original building blocks of speech,
University of Texas researchers contend.</TE>
<TE>   Language experts like Chomsky and Pinker at MIT hold that the
human brain is specialized for fundamental aspects of language, with
every child inheriting the innate structure of a universal grammar in
the same way that a spider inherits the pattern of the web it weaves.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Bates at UC San Diego and other language anatomy experts
argue that an infant's brain--perhaps the world's most powerful
learning device--is quite capable of deducing the nature and
structure of its native language from the conversations around it.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe we have underestimated what babies bring to the world
in terms of being able to learn," said neuroscientist Mark S.
Seidenberg of the University of Wisconsin at Madison. "We
underestimate the information that parents provide about language."</TE>
<TE>   On average, an infant will hear 16,000 examples of his or her
parents' speech in the first few months of life.</TE>
<TE>   Every infant uses the networks of his or her brain to analyze the
sounds and patterns in adult speech, research at New York University
and the University of Wisconsin shows.</TE>
<TE>   The exaggerated musical singsong of parental patter helps infants
absorb crucial vowel sounds and other phonetic elements.</TE>
<TE>   To sort the sense of words and grammar from nonsense, an infant's
brain uses surprisingly sophisticated statistical computations. They
can quickly deduce rules and patterns about words and sentence
structure, well before they know what the words mean or even how to
say them.</TE>
<TE>   In another study published today, Italian researchers showed how
all human minds use that capability to crack the code of speech.
Scientists led by Jacques Mehler at the International School for
Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italy, reported that people use powerful
statistical thinking to decipher a new language.</TE>
<TE>   To better understand how the mind discovers language, Mehler made
one up and then studied adults trying to learn it.</TE>
<TE>   Neural number-crunching may be enough to find words, but grammar
is so complicated that the brain must resort to a different mode of
thinking to sort out sentence structure, they contended. The brain
can easily switch between the two modes in thousandths of a second.</TE>
<TE>   "This study supports the idea of the mind as a Swiss Army knife
filled with different tools for different tasks," said NYU
psychologist Gary Marcus. "People can switch mental tools based on
subtle cues, right on a dime."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists already have established that while the growing infant
listens and babbles, his brain is building trillions of connections
between its cells into the special neural circuits of language,
whether the words are spoken aloud or signed with gestures.</TE>
<TE>   Two-month-old babies can remember word sounds and the variations
of speech.</TE>
<TE>   At six months, infants begin to pair sounds with a specific
meaning. About the same time, infants are tuned to the distinctive
sounds of their native tongue.</TE>
<TE>   By 7 months, they can deduce where sentences appear or words start
and stop. And infants start memorizing words they hear long before
they have any idea what they might mean.</TE>
<TE>   An average year-old infant may understand 50 words. That number
can triple in a month or two. By 24 months, children can recognize a
word in their vocabulary within 600 milliseconds. By high school, the
average young person may know 60,000 words, picking them up at the
rate of about 10 new words a day.</TE>
<TE>   It makes learning a language look like child's play.</TE>

<HD>Baseball Players, Owners Expect to Reach Deal to Avoid
Shutdown</HD>
<DH>Labor: Talks continue into the morning to bridge
differences over a payroll tax.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN and JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Dollar by dollar, step by step, baseball's players and owners moved
closer this morning to an agreement that could avert the sport's
ninth work stoppage since 1972.</LD>
<LD>   With optimism rising, the two sides worked past a 9 p.m. PDT
deadline, with indications that a final deal was still several hours
away. However, they were hopeful of reaching an agreement by 4 a.m.
PDT, which was when the Boston Red Sox--the first team traveling
today--needed to board a bus to catch a flight to a game in Cleveland
tonight.</LD>
<LD>   The representatives of club owners and the Major League Players
Assn. were focused on clearing the final hurdle of a payroll tax on
the wealthiest teams. The stakes were high, with players scheduled to
strike before any games were played today unless a deal was
completed. Fifteen games are on the calendar today, with the St.
Louis Cardinals at Chicago Cubs scheduled to begin play at 12:20 p.m.
PDT.</LD>
<TE>   At games Thursday, fans made sure the baseball establishment knew
just how unhappy they would be if the players struck. In Pittsburgh,
one sign said, "Fix It or We Don't Come Back." Outside the B.U.S. bar
near Houston's ballpark, a message on a marker board said: "Monkey
see, Monkey do-The players strike, The fans will too."</TE>
<TE>   In Anaheim, the atmosphere turned especially ugly as fans began
chanting "No strike! No strike!" and showering the field with beach
balls, water bottles, cups and other trash. Foul balls, usually
trophies for those who catch them, instead became missiles, launched
back onto the field.</TE>
<TE>   Angel reliever Scott Schoeneweis, the team's player
representative, said he understood the fans' frustration but "would
have hoped that our fans would have had a little more class."</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to ruin anybody's parade," Schoeneweis added.
"We're not trying to take the game away from anybody. We're just
trying to stand up for the issues at hand."</TE>
<TE>   In a midevening conference call with players, his second of the
day, players union President Donald Fehr expressed optimism that an
agreement could be reached, according to sources familiar with what
was said. The sources said Fehr indicated it could go down to the
wire, and complained that the owners were still "playing games" with
the payroll tax. Still, he thought a deal would be struck.</TE>
<TE>   "We've made moves to get to a point they want, and then they want
more," said one player who participated in the call, speaking on
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig also had a conference call with
his executive council Thursday. According to a club executive who
spoke to a participant, Selig indicated he would let the talks go
through the night and then complete the deal. The implication was
that Selig would try to wrest as much as he could from the luxury tax
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "We're closer," said union counsel Gene Orza, after meeting with
management negotiators Thursday night, "but I don't know if we're
close enough to appease the owners."</TE>
<TE>   It appeared that the sides were prepared to compromise at a tax
threshold somewhere between the $112 million proposed by the owners
in the first year and the $120 million proposed by the union.</TE>
<TE>   One obstacle to an agreement had been the union's unwillingness to
accept a tax in the final year of a potential four-year contract, but
sources said the players were willing to compromise on that. However,
the sources said, the union purposely set the threshold high,
somewhere between $140 million and $160 million, since the final
year's threshold would become the floor in the first year of a
subsequent bargaining agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations took place on a cool, gray, rainy day in New
York, with negotiators shuttling in and out of the Major League
Baseball headquarters in a high-rise on Park Avenue. Players around
the country hung on every announcement, with many packing in
preparation for a strike.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't sound real good," said Texas Ranger shortstop Alex
Rodriguez, who would lose the most of any player, $114,754 a day.
"You just have to prepare yourself for the very worst."</TE>
<TE>   The players were threatening to strike out of concern that the
proposed combination of increased revenue sharing among clubs and a
"luxury tax" on the payrolls of wealthy teams would effectively put a
lid on salaries, which the powerful union won't accept. The sides
previously agreed on random steroid testing, raising the minimum
salary from $200,000 to $300,000 and improving the pension plan. With
those side issues out of the way, negotiators were able to focus on
the biggest issues, as fans, players and owners waited anxiously.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad and it's disappointing, but the issues are important
issues," Schoeneweis said. "We've done our part. We've moved to the
other side quite a bit, and there's room for an agreement to be done.
It just needs to get done."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels and the Dodgers are on paths that could lead to the
playoffs, making the prospect of a strike especially painful. The
Dodgers awaited word in Houston, where they were ready to either
begin a three-game series against the Astros or go home.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got this black cloud looming over us," said Dodger
outfielder Dave Roberts. "This is my first opportunity to play every
day in the big leagues, and it's been a good year for the Dodgers,
and we've put ourselves in a position to go to the playoffs.... I
hope that we can play this thing through."</TE>
<TE>   A White House spokesman urged the two sides to reach agreement,
saying they should consider the effect a strike could have on the
country as it approaches the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The owners and players need to keep in mind not only what a
strike would do to the future of baseball, but also what it would to
America during a time of national unity and national spirit," White
House spokesman Scott McClellan said after talking to President Bush
about the potential strike.</TE>
<TE>   However, McClellan said the president, a former Texas Rangers
owner, would not intercede.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something the players and owners need to resolve," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   High-ranking officials from the commissioner's office and the
union traveled back and forth between their respective Manhattan
headquarters, trying to resolve the most contentious issue in talks
that resumed in earnest after the All-Star break. Negotiators
declined to comment as they moved from building to building and were
greeted by fans holding signs encouraging them to get a deal done.</TE>
<TE>   It is believed team owners and players agreed on a plan for
increased revenue sharing--transferring money from high-revenue to
low-revenue clubs--during multiple morning and afternoon bargaining
sessions Thursday, but they remained apart on the thresholds and
rates for a payroll tax heading into late-night talks.</TE>
<TE>   Under the previous union plan, the minimum payroll subject to
taxation would be $125 million in 2003, $135 million in 2004 and $145
million in 2005, after which the tax would end. Owners proposed
thresholds of $107 million in the first three years of the contract
and $111 million in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   As of late Thursday, owners had increased their offer to $112
million in the first two years, $116 million in the third year and
$120 million in the fourth, sources said. The union was believed to
be working with thresholds of $120 million, $125 million, $130
million and $140 million.</TE>
<TE>   Management proposed that a team would be taxed at 35% the first
time it exceeded the threshold, 40% the second time, 45% the third
time and 50% the fourth time. The players proposed tax rates of 15%
to 40%, and sources said the sides were working to find common ground
on that key front.</TE>
<TE>   On revenue sharing, a lawyer familiar with the situation said
about $255 million would be transferred in the new basic agreement.
Word emerged late Thursday that a compromise was reached to broker
that portion of a deal. Under terms of the latest known union
proposal, clubs would share 33.3% of local revenue, up from 20% under
the current deal.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope something will get done," Schoeneweis said. "If something
is not done, there won't be baseball [today]."</TE>

<HD>Fans Try Strike of Their Own</HD>

<LD>The fans struck first.</LD>
<LD>   What started as an innocent dropping of inflatable balls became an
ugly barrage of debris by the end of the Angel-Devil Ray game
Thursday night, as the 18,820 fans at Edison Field turned what might
have been their last opportunity to see Major League Baseball into a
forum for their frustration at the sport's labor battle.</LD>
<LD>   Before players had the chance to strike, Angel fans caused a
little work stoppage of their own by tossing beach balls onto the
warning track from the right-field bleachers in the top of the
seventh inning of Thursday's game against Tampa Bay. Some fans began
chanting, "No strike, no strike!"</LD>
<TE>   The chant came back, louder and from every section of the
ballpark, in the bottom of the inning. To ensure they were noticed,
the fans threw foul balls back onto the field. One almost hit Kevin
Appier on the mound from the upper deck.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't just a peasant uprising; the bourgeoisie got in on it
too. Even the folks in the ritzy Diamond Club behind home plate
tossed balls back onto the field and basked in the cheers as security
escorted them out of the stadium. One man appeared to ignore the
chants to throw the ball back as he handed it to his wife. He
actually was giving her the chance. Her throw didn't make it over the
backstop, but the point was made.</TE>
<TE>   Play was briefly halted in the ninth inning because of trash that
was being thrown onto the field.</TE>
<TE>   The frustration reached its peak at the end of the game, after
Tampa Bay's Aubrey Huff grounded to short for what was possibly the
last out of the 2002 season.</TE>
<TE>   Some fans cheered the Angels for their 6-1 victory, which
maintained their half-game lead over the Seattle Mariners in the
wild-card race. Others booed and tossed water bottles and other trash
at the players, frustrated that they would go to bed uncertain if
there would be playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have hoped that the fans would have had a little more
class than what they showed tonight with throwing stuff on the
field," Angel player representative Scott Schoeneweis said. He had a
simple request: "Let us play the game."</TE>
<TE>   The fans had spoken earlier, with what seemed to be an even
simpler demand: "Let us watch."</TE>
<TE>   They don't expect to be compensated with millions of dollars.
They'll even pay dearly for the privilege. They only want more
baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe baseball's powers-that-be were finally listening to them.
Maybe the fans could be heard in a room across the country in New
York, where negotiators were working through the night to reach an
agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "I would hope we'd be playing tomorrow," Schoeneweis said.</TE>
<TE>   "But if there's no deal worked out, I guarantee we won't."</TE>
<TE>   That's the problem with baseball. Every glimmer of hope is quickly
blocked out by steel curtains. It's too hard to ignore baseball's
perfect record of eight work stoppages in eight opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   It's the same as trying to root for the Angels to get to the World
Series, despite all of the past failures.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Navarro has been an usher at the place formerly known as
Anaheim Stadium for 20 years. What keeps the 71-year-old around?</TE>
<TE>   "I've gotta work the World Series before I retire," he said. "I've
gotta do that."</TE>
<TE>   How tantalizing would it be for that half-game ticket to the
playoffs to hold up--and never matter because a strike wiped out the
rest of the season?</TE>
<TE>   "My gut feeling is that we're not going to have the strike,"
Navarro said. "Just my own gut feel. What I read in the newspapers,
what I see on TV, there's so many zeroes on the end of those dollar
signs, it doesn't seem possible that anybody would go out on strike."</TE>
<TE>   A little faith. Trust.</TE>
<TE>   There isn't enough of that to go around in this sport.</TE>
<TE>   The whole reason the players set a strike date was because they
don't trust the owners. They were afraid that if they didn't use the
threat of lost regular-season--and especially postseason--revenue
that the owners would unilaterally implement their own rules after
the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Why should the players trust management? The owners have been
found guilty of collusion. Twice. They consistently cry about a bleak
economic situation, but they won't show the spreadsheets to anyone.
Even one of the New York Met co-owners filed suit against his
partner, accusing him of cooking the books. Speaking of legal action,
baseball's higher-ups are currently the target of a Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act lawsuit brought by the
Montreal Expos' former owners. And if New York Yankee owner George
Steinbrenner feels the new agreement unfairly targets his team,
there's a chance he could sue baseball.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing these baseball people couldn't ruin. Put the
owners in charge of Santa's workshop and they would lock out the
elves. You could pay the players to eat Krispy Kreme doughnuts and
they'd strike over a lack of milk.</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday, there still was some hope. We'll see if baseball
can manage to take that away too.</TE>

<HD>Mariners Get Enough Offense in Time</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Desi Relaford ruined Rick Reed's masterpiece with a leadoff homer in
the eighth inning, helping Jamie Moyer and the Seattle Mariners
salvage a disappointing week with a 2-0 victory over the Minnesota
Twins on Thursday at Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   Relaford and Ben Davis, whose sacrifice fly gave Seattle an
insurance run in the ninth, will be rewarded for their run-scoring
swings by Manager Lou Piniella.</LD>
<LD>   "I told the players before the game that I'm buying steaks for
RBIs," Piniella said. "I guess I'm buying two steaks. I was hoping to
have to buy eight or nine."</LD>
<TE>   They had to start somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners, four games behind idle Oakland in the American
League West, won for only the second time in six games and kept their
second-half record from dropping to .500. Seattle managed only five
runs in the series.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting down to the close right now," Relaford said, "and we
need all parts of the game. Our offense hasn't been there."</TE>
<TE>   Moyer, who struck out seven, gave up five hits and one walk in
seven scoreless innings. Winning for the first time in four starts,
Moyer (13-6) improved to 10-5 in his career against the Twins. He
gave up an infield single to Denny Hocking leading off the eighth
before yielding to Arthur Rhodes.</TE>
<TE>   Jacque Jones sacrificed and Luis Rivas moved Hocking to third with
a groundout, but Corey Koskie ended the inning with a lineout to Jeff
Cirillo at third and Kazuhiro Sasaki pitched the ninth for his 33rd
save in 38 attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Reed (12-7) took a shutout into the eighth, but Relaford hit his
first pitch of the inning into the folded-up football seats over the
right field wall to give the Mariners a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "He had been throwing me cutters and changeups, and I just kind of
had a hunch that he was going to come in with a fastball," Relaford
said. "It was just kind of a guess."</TE>
<TE>   Reed gave up one run and seven hits in 7 2/3 innings, and struck
out out eight.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 7, New York 4--Josh Phelps homered twice off Roger
Clemens, leading Esteban Loaiza (7-7) and the Blue Jays over the
Yankees at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Phelps and Carlos Delgado both hit long shots against Clemens
(11-5), helping prevent Clemens from earning his 292nd career victory
in front of a SkyDome crowd of 32,679, which included many Yankee
fans.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso Soriano hit his 32nd homer for the Yankees, who saw their
three-game winning streak end. Bernie Williams went 0 for 4 and saw
his season-high 19-game hitting streak end.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 9, Baltimore 6--Ivan Rodriguez hit his fifth career grand
slam to complete a big Ranger comeback and Texas defeated the Orioles
at Arlington, Texas, to complete a three-game sweep.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez's grand slam came in the sixth inning off reliever Rick
Bauer (6-6), who had struck out the first two batters of the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore had led, 6-0, in the third inning. The Orioles have a
six-game losing streak, matching their season high from the first
week of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Texas, in last place in the AL West for the third consecutive
season, has won 10 of its last 14.</TE>

<KH>LABOR WATCH: AT THE PLAYERS' STRIKE DEADLINE</KH>
<HD>No Fans of Stoppage</HD>
<DH>Angels: During 6-1 victory over Tampa Bay, the final game
before strike deadline, small but rowdy crowd at Anaheim chants "no
strike" and litters field with debris.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last out of the last game of the last day before the strike
deadline came at 9:44 p.m. Thursday, when Aubrey Huff of the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays grounded out, and who knows when we'll see a Major
League Baseball game again?</LD>
<LD>   An unruly crowd left Edison Field a mess, with fans and players
alienating each other on the eve of a potential strike.</LD>
<LD>   After the final out, the Angels shut off the message board rather
than promote tonight's scheduled home game against the Baltimore
Orioles.</LD>
<TE>   After the Angels concluded their 6-1 victory over the Devil Rays,
neither fans nor players knew whether the Angels would play
tonight--or again this season.</TE>
<TE>   In the unlikely but not impossible scenario that a strike cancels
the rest of the regular season but not the playoffs, the Angels are
in. They lead the wild-card race by a half-game over the Seattle
Mariners, and under the current standings they would face the New
York Yankees in the first round of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   But the playoffs were a distant concern on a night several players
said they feared for their safety. In the final three innings before
the strike deadline, a small but rowdy crowd of 18,820 let loose some
anger, throwing baseballs and beach balls, water bottles and soda
bottles, beer cups and toilet paper onto the field.</TE>
<TE>   The players hustled off the field after the last out--outfielder
Alex Ochoa said he got hit by a pizza box--and peeked back angrily at
debris more reminiscent of the aftermath of a rock concert.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a playoff race. We're your team, supposedly," pitcher
Scott Schoeneweis said. "Let us play.</TE>
<TE>   "When 4-year-olds get frustrated, they throw stuff. Grown adults
shouldn't do that.... We're not trying to ruin anyone's fun."</TE>
<TE>   While players sympathized with fan bitterness over the possible
strike, several suggested expressing that bitterness with boos and
banners was OK but that throwing objects needlessly put players at
risk of injury.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that was a very mature thing to do," pitcher Jarrod
Washburn said. "It was childish and dangerous the way they handled
themselves. I'm sure it was a few bad apples that made the whole
crowd look bad."</TE>
<TE>   Said Manager Mike Scioscia: "I was disappointed. I know our fans
are frustrated. We're frustrated. The players are frustrated. But, if
you're going to voice your opinion, let's not throw a baseball from
the upper deck."</TE>
<TE>   In a ballpark where most fans resist cheering until directed to do
so by a scoreboard message, the fans stood in unison in the seventh
inning and chanted "NO STRIKE."</TE>
<TE>   With one out in the ninth inning, they did it again, not so much
in unison but this time with props, littering the field with debris.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, any fan catching a ball, even a foul ball, was urged to
throw it back onto the field; one fan did so in the eighth inning and
almost nailed Angel pitcher Kevin Appier.</TE>
<TE>   Appier said he did not believe the ball was targeted for him and
did not criticize the fans as harshly as his teammates did.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel bad for them," he said. "I was actually kind of geeked. I
like the fans being intense like that. We definitely understand where
they're coming from. We'd like it to be resolved too."</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the evening was far more pleasant for Appier, who shut
out the Devil Rays for the first seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Appier and Scot Shields combined on a five-hitter, Troy Glaus
drove in three runs, and the Angels scored four runs in the first
inning to end the suspense in the game and start the countdown toward
the looming strike.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans were making a point," infielder Scott Spiezio said.
"They want us on the field to continue the season we've been having.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just glad they let us finish the game so we didn't have to
forfeit. If this thing gets settled but we had to forfeit and we
would have lost by a game, that would have been a bad situation."</TE>

<LD>If a strike is on today, Angel management will lock the doors to
Edison Field, with players on their own for workouts. Outfielder
Darin Erstad, the team leader, said players would not jeopardize
their pennant chances by deciding a strike would be synonymous with a
vacation.</LD>
<LD>   "We won't be sitting around doing nothing," Erstad said.</LD>
<LD>   The players plan to organize informal workouts.</LD>
<TE>   "The reason we're playing as well as we are right now is because
we're intelligent," pitcher Jarrod Washburn said. "We're not the most
talented team, but we're smart enough to know we have a
responsibility to stay in shape and be ready to play."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have a large contingent of players living year-round in
Southern California, but infielder Scott Spiezio lives in Illinois.
If a strike does not end quickly, he's not sure how many teammates
will stick around.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's going to leave for three days or so," Spiezio said.
"Everybody will be here. After that, everybody might be gone."</TE>

<HD>Cardinals Acquire Wright</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jamey Wright wasn't sure about his immediate plans, but he did know
his future looked a whole lot brighter.</LD>
<LD>   The St. Louis Cardinals acquired the right-hander and cash from
the Milwaukee Brewers on Thursday for minor league outfielder Chris
Morris and a player to be named.</LD>
<LD>   Wright was penciled in to start against the Chicago Cubs at
Wrigley Field today pending resolution of the labor dispute.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know what I'm going to do, I guess I'll drive down there
tonight," Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   He goes from a team that is trying to avoid its first 100-loss
season to a pennant contender.</TE>
<TE>   The NL Central-leading Cardinals have been busy making trades
since the All-Star break, getting star third baseman Scott Rolen and
pitchers Chuck Finley and Jeff Fassero.</TE>
<TE>   Wright was 5-13 with a 5.35 earned-run average in 19 starts for
the Brewers. He was 3-3 with a 2.90 ERA in his last six starts.</TE>
<TE>   "All I care about doing is the same job I've been doing the last
month for the Brewers," Wright said. "It'll definitely be a more
intense atmosphere, one that I never got to experience before. I'll
be a wild ride for me."</TE>
<TE>   Wright, 27, had been scheduled to start tonight at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers replaced him in the rotation with Nelson Figueroa,
whose contract was purchased from triple-A Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Morris, 23, who led all minor leagues with 111 stolen bases for
Class-A Peoria in the Midwest League last year, hit .249 with 38 runs
batted in and 55 stolen bases for Class-A Potomac in the Carolina
League this summer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto Blue Jay left-hander Felix Heredia was charged with
assaulting a woman with a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto Det. Peter Harmsen said Heredia assaulted the mother of
one of his children at about 5 a.m. Thursday. Harmsen said alcohol
was involved.</TE>
<TE>   The 22-year-old woman was treated at the hospital and released.
Harmsen said the injuries were minor.</TE>
<TE>   Heredia, who turned himself in, was in custody and awaiting a bail
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston Astro pitcher Roy Oswalt dropped his appeal of a five-game
suspension for throwing a pitch at Chicago's Alex Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Oswalt, who got his 17th victory Wednesday night, started serving
his suspension Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   During the game at Wrigley Field on Aug. 12, Oswalt hit Fred
McGriff with a pitch in the second inning, then hit Gonzalez in the
back with a pitch in the seventh inning.</TE>

<HD>They Have Blue Devil of a Time Getting Win</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Woe is Duke.</LD>
<LD>   After consecutive 0-11 seasons, the Blue Devil football team has
lost 23 games in a row all told.</LD>
<LD>   Senior linebacker Jamyon Small is the only player on the team who
has won a game wearing a Duke uniform.</LD>
<TE>   And in the midst of trying to upgrade the program with a new
$20-million football center and admissions standards that allow some
of the leeway the basketball program enjoys, Duke lost starting
quarterback D. Bryant to academic trouble last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, the 12 games ahead might hold the victory that ends the
streak.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'll be caught somewhere between a hysterical laugh and a
cry," linebacker Ryan Fowler said.</TE>
<TE>   More Duke: A Sept. 28 game against Navy looms as the best
opportunity for the Blue Devils to avoid breaking Northwestern's
record of 34 consecutive losses.</TE>
<TE>   First things first: Coach Carl Franks, preparing for Saturday's
opener against East Carolina, delayed announcing which of two
sophomores will start at quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   "I have decided, but I'm not saying," Franks said. "I don't think
there's any need to go and make it any easier for East Carolina.
They've got it easy enough as it is."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: When was the last time UCLA or USC went winless in
football?</TE>
<TE>   Appearing on Aisle 3: Ralph Friedgen, Maryland's portly football
coach, will be seen in frozen food aisles in ads for Healthy Choice
dinners and ice cream as part of a marketing arrangement between the
school and ConAgra Foods, the Washington Post reports.</TE>
<TE>   One part of the deal calls for Friedgen to receive $18,000 toward
the renovation of Maryland's football team house--but only if he
loses 100 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   At 312 pounds, Friedgen already has lost 43.</TE>
<TE>   Not offended: Thousands of Tennessee fans were upset by an ESPN
promotion depicting Volunteer fans as pig-chasing bumpkins, prompting
ESPN to apologize and pull the ad.</TE>
<TE>   But senior offensive tackle Will Ofenheusle had no problem with
it.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was funny," Ofenheusle told the Nashville
Tennessean. "If anybody should be upset, it should be me. I'm from
Tennessee, play here and grew up on a pig farm."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1987, Ben Johnson of Canada set the
world record in the 100 meters, bettering Calvin Smith's
four-year-old mark of 9.93 by 0.10 seconds in the World Track and
Field Championships in Rome. Johnson later lost the record because of
steroid use.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: UCLA was 0-5-3 in 1924. (USC was 0-1 in 1901.)</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Playing international basketball for the U.S. team
has become a lose-lose proposition for NBA players.</TE>
<TE>   "Lose--an increasingly realistic possibility--and you will be
ridiculed and labeled forever," Jonathan Feigen of the Houston
Chronicle writes. "Win, and you will be ignored, or at best
unappreciated."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Antonio Davis put it best: "This is the heaviest jersey
I've ever worn."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raymond Washington leaped high to block Tommy Kirovski's 31-yard
field goal attempt as time expired, giving Fresno State a 16-14
victory over San Diego State on Thursday night at Fresno despite the
absence of two key players.</LD>
<LD>   The Aztecs were shut out until the waning seconds of the third
quarter, but they were in position to make Coach Tom Craft's debut a
huge success when Adam Hall drove San Diego State 51 yards to the
Fresno State 14 with two seconds left.</LD>
<LD>   The long snap was bobbled a bit and Washington, a freshman backup
cornerback, jumped over the pile to block the kick.</LD>
<TE>   Freshman backup quarterback Paul Pinegar passed for 196 yards, and
Asen Asparuhov kicked three field goals as Fresno State (1-1) barely
escaped without starting quarterback Jeff Grady and star receiver
Bernard Berrian. Both players were held out of the home opener to
rest injuries they sustained last week at Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other games:</TE>
<TE>   Derek Anderson completed 15 of 26 passes for 345 yards and three
touchdowns to lead Oregon State to a 49-10 victory over Eastern
Kentucky at Corvallis, Ore. ... Bret Engemann passed for 386 yards
and three touchdowns and Marcus Whalen ran for 140 yards for Brigham
Young in a 42-21 victory over Syracuse at Provo, Utah. ... Northern
Illinois stopped Wake Forest's two-point conversion attempt in
overtime to defeat the Demon Deacons, 42-41, at Dekalb, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two days after notifying San Jose State's Neil Parry that the
lifetime insurance coverage for his prosthetic legs could be canceled
if he returned to football, Mutual of Omaha--the NCAA's catastrophic
insurance carrier--made a special modification to the NCAA's policy
that will keep Parry covered.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Are Put on Hold by Negotiations</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Trying to remain hopeful that strike would be
averted, they fly to Houston not knowing if scheduled series against
Astros will take place.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers' charter did land here early Thursday evening, and the
team did check into its hotel shortly thereafter, but players,
coaches and front-office executives spent the rest of the evening in
a holding pattern.</LD>
<LD>   While negotiators in New York worked into Thursday evening in an
attempt to reach a labor agreement that would avert a strike--and
baseball's ninth work stoppage since 1972--the Dodgers went to bed
not knowing if they would report to Minute Maid Park this afternoon
to begin a three-game series against the Houston Astros or if they
would be heading home.</LD>
<LD>   During a late-night conference call Thursday, union chief Don Fehr
told players that negotiations would continue into Friday morning,
and that some kind of resolution was expected early today. Some
players seemed optimistic a deal would be struck; others weren't so
sure.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd like to think [we'll reach a settlement], but a lot has to
happen in a short period of time, and I don't know if that's
possible," Dodger second baseman Mark Grudzielanek said. "We came
back with a good proposal, almost to the tilt of what we're going to
come back with, but there's only hours left. I don't know if
[Commissioner Bud] Selig has something up his sleeve or something to
prove, but it's going to be weird to see what happens [today].</TE>
<TE>   "This has gone on so much for the last 34 years, but it's part of
life. It's definitely frustrating when you don't have an answer."</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Dave Roberts also listened to the conference call,
which lasted about a half-hour, and came away more hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   "Don [Fehr] seemed optimistic, but he told us to be patient, that
they still had some work ahead of them," Roberts said. "They're still
talking, still trying to work things out. I think the sides are too
close not to get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Green, the Dodger right fielder who is having a most
valuable player-caliber season, hitting .279 with 38 home runs and
101 runs batted in, said the waiting has been the hardest part.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obviously on everyone's minds, but everyone understands it's
just a matter of time before we know what's going to happen," Green
said. "Players have a lot vested in this. Everyone is anxious to know
what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   Though Grudzielanek feels the chances for an agreement are "about
50-50," he tried to treat Thursday as he would any off-day.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to bed ready to play [today]," Grudzielanek said. "If
we don't, then I'll deal with it. But you have to stay focused
mentally."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are 77-56 and have a two-game lead over the San
Francisco Giants in the National League wild-card race, so if a
strike were to wipe out the rest of this season, they would have
plenty to lose.</TE>
<TE>   But as long as negotiators were still talking, there was still
hope.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I got up [Thursday] morning and packed my bags, I've given
no thought to the possibility of not playing baseball [tonight],"
Manager Jim Tracy said. "I don't want to see the season interrupted
for one pitch. If it is, we'll have to deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   If a strike begins today, Dodger players will have to pay for
their own hotel rooms beginning tonight, and for their own airfare if
they want to travel home. Front-office and support staff would remain
in Houston until Sunday evening, at which point they would return to
Los Angeles on a team charter flight.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Dodgers plan to make that charter flight available to
players if they want to travel back to Los Angeles. Several players
said they have held off making contingency travel plans and would
wait until negotiations are completed until they decide what to do.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, the Dodgers' leadoff hitter, said the possibility of a
strike has cast a pall over the team.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got this black cloud looming over us," Roberts said. "This
is my first opportunity to play every day in the big leagues, and
it's been a good year for the Dodgers, and we've put ourselves in a
position to go to the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been optimistic, and I hope that we can play this thing
through, but obviously it's been on my mind. I just hope it doesn't
take away from the season I've had or the Dodgers have had."</TE>
<TE>   A lengthy strike would affect players such as Roberts the most.
The center fielder is making $217,500 this season, slightly over the
major league minimum of $200,000. Though he has saved as much as he
can this season, he said he'd probably conduct clinics during a work
stoppage to earn extra income. Players would also draw money from the
union's strike fund.</TE>
<TE>   "It affects guys with low service time the most, because we don't
have the money in the bank the other guys have," said Roberts, who is
married, has a 2-year-old son, a mortgage on a house in Oceanside and
a lease on an apartment in Pasadena. "But we knew what we were
getting into. We just have to make do.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to be caught off guard, and the reality is, there
may not be a settlement. You have to prepare your family by being
more conscious of saving money and not being too spend-happy."</TE>
<TE>   There were few signs in the home clubhouse following Wednesday
night's 1-0 win over Arizona that the Dodgers were preparing for a
lengthy trip.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the sight of Tyler Houston's golf clubs was alarming, as
was the inordinate number of large boxes in front of Brian Jordan's
locker. Jordan, in fact, tried to lighten the mood by joking that he
would be on a flight home to Atlanta at 12:01 a.m. Friday, one minute
after the strike deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a blase, blah mood in here," Jordan said. "You're
optimistic one day, not the next. You just don't know."</TE>

<LD>The Dodgers' most recent minor league call-ups are caught in the
middle of baseball's labor dispute.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Kinkade, Jolbert Cabrera and Guillermo Mota face the prospect
of being shut out by a major league players' strike at the same time
they could be earning a minor league salary while helping the Las
Vegas 51s close out their record-breaking season and begin the
Pacific Coast League playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   But they'd rather be on strike than in Las Vegas.</LD>
<TE>   "The whole goal of the minor leagues is to get to the big
leagues," said Kinkade, who batted .341 with 11 home runs and 50 runs
batted in for Las Vegas in 74 games. "It just happens to be a
negotiation year and that's what happens. It was real good for us
winning all those games in Vegas, and I'm glad they continued doing
it, but the whole goal is to get to the big leagues."</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas, which clinched the Southern Division title on Aug. 20,
equaled a franchise record for wins in a season with its 83rd victory
Wednesday night. The 51s begin the playoffs Tuesday against Edmonton.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be fun to be there for the playoffs and everything, but
this is the big leagues and I want this opportunity," said Mota, who
was 1-3 with a save and a 2.95 earned-run average in 20 appearances
for the 51s.</TE>
<TE>   Cabrera, who joined the Dodgers in a July 22 trade with Cleveland
before being shipped to Las Vegas, hit .343 with two home runs and
scored 22 runs in 27 games with the 51s. He never expected to be in
the minor leagues and has no real allegiance to the Dodgers' triple-A
affiliate.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a great time when I was in Vegas, but my mind was here," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Kinkade: "Everybody down there, even though they're in the
playoffs, wants to be here, even though we may go on strike. I'm just
real glad I'm here and hopefully everything works out."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of the top 2-year-old fillies in the country will have a rematch
in the $200,000 Spinaway today at Saratoga.</LD>
<LD>   Awesome Humor and Stellar, who finished 1-2 in the Adirondack on
Aug. 12, head a field of 12 going seven furlongs in the Grade I.</LD>
<LD>   Purchased privately by Winstar Farm after her win in the Debutante
at Churchill Downs on July 6, Awesome Humor earned her third victory
at three tracks in the Adirondack. She led virtually throughout under
jockey Pat Day and defeated Stellar by a length.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Michael Tabor and Edward Evans, who bred the filly in
Virginia, Stellar is a daughter of Grand Slam. Trained by Patrick
Biancone, she will be ridden by Saratoga's leading rider, Edgar
Prado, and will race on Lasix.</TE>
<TE>   Stellar will break from the outside and Awesome Humor the rail.
Between them will be Appleby Gardens, a winner of her lone start at
Woodbine in Toronto last month; Just Call Me Angel, Hope For Love,
Miss Mary Apples, second in the Schuylerville to the ill-fated
Freedom's Daughter on July 24; Vasquez, Midnight Cry, Traumatic,
Forever Partners, Manny's Gold Maker and Holiday Runner.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: It's not a good betting race, but the second at
Del Mar is a showdown between stakes winner Crafty C.T. and the
unbeaten Fleet Foot.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Grant Marty A Wish. The 3-year-old Beautiful Crown
filly is one of the claims of the year. Taken for $12,500 by trainer
John Ivory for a partnership out of a maiden claiming victory up
north, Grant Marty A Wish remained unbeaten in three starts with her
second easy win at Del Mar on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Bay Meadows. The track begins its 50-day fall meet
today with a slew of small fields. Only 52 horses entered the eight
races.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Modernist and Bettor
Royalty in the fifth, using Malone, Six Hitter and Snoopy Cat in the
sixth, singling Printemps in the seventh and using To The Victor,
Reigning Storm, Smokin Pirate and Obermeister in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/65. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $9.20/$384.60. Total money bet: $544.</TE>

<LD>Florida motorcycle riders Ricky Carmichael of Havana and James
"Bubba" Stewart of Haines City will try to put the finishing touches
on two of the most remarkable seasons in the AMA's 30 years of
motocross Sunday at Steel City Raceway in Delmont, Pa.</LD>
<LD>   Carmichael, 22, has won every 250cc moto run in the AMA Chevy
Trucks series this season, 22 of them since the opening race last May
at Glen Helen Raceway in San Bernardino. In outdoor competition,
individual motos are 30 minutes plus two laps, and two are run at
each event.</LD>
<LD>   The stocky Honda rider's domination has been so complete that he
has led 323 laps in the 11 national events. His closest competitor,
Tim Ferry, has led five. Carmichael clinched his third consecutive
national 250cc crown when he won Aug. 18 in Millville, Minn., three
events before the season finale.</LD>
<TE>   Carmichael insisted during the first half of the season that going
undefeated was "a ridiculous idea," but as he piled up victory after
victory--often by as much as 20-30 seconds--he became determined to
do what no other rider had done. The closest to a perfect season
before has been Rick Johnson, who won six of seven events in 1987,
also on a Honda.</TE>
<TE>   One more win for Carmichael will break Bob Hannah's 250cc record
of 27 victories.</TE>
<TE>   "I never dreamed when I started racing that I would be fortunate
enough to be this successful," Carmichael said. "I've been
concentrating so much on winning races that I haven't had a chance to
sit back and enjoy some of the records I've broken this year."</TE>
<TE>   He has won eight AMA championships since turning professional in
1996, including 125cc and supercross. He won 11 of 16 races in this
year's supercross season.</TE>
<TE>   He had better not look over his shoulder, however, because right
behind him is Stewart, the African American teenage sensation who
broke all of Carmichael's amateur records and is now taking aim on
his pro records.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart became the youngest AMA national champion, and the first
of African American heritage, when he clinched this year's 125cc
series with his ninth win in 11 events. Nine wins amount to a rookie
record, breaking Carmichael's mark of eight, set in 1997. An overall
win Sunday will make Stewart the winningest single-season 125cc
rider.</TE>
<TE>   It will be another year before Stewart and Carmichael go head to
head, because Stewart is planning to remain in the 125cc class next
year, with an eye on 250 in 2004.</TE>

<TE>   Sprint Cars</TE>
<TE>   After completing an eight-race tour of the East, the Sprint Car
Racing Assn. returns home for main events of 40 laps Saturday night
at Ventura Raceway and 50 laps Sunday night at Perris Auto Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Three-time champion Richard Griffin, with a win at Lincoln
Speedway and a second at Williams Grove Speedway, both in
Pennsylvania, moved 308 points ahead of Tony Jones in season
standings.</TE>
<TE>   Other winners in the tour, which was also part of the fourth
annual Non-Winged World Championship series, included Mike Kirby at
67 Speedway in Illinois, Damion Gardner at Williams Grove, J.J. Yeley
at Fremont Speedway in Ohio, and Bud Kaeding, who won two at Lakeside
Speedway in Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   In the NWWC, Griffin leads Gardner by 24 points with six races
remaining, three at Perris and three at Manzanita Speedway in
Phoenix.</TE>

<TE>   France Has Surgery</TE>
<TE>   Bill France Jr., chief executive of NASCAR, was recovering
Thursday from bypass surgery, recommended by doctors treating him for
a broken right hip at a hospital in Daytona Beach, Fla. France broke
the hip in a fall Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   France, 69, recently completed yearlong cancer treatments and had
returned to a more active role in the stock car racing organization.</TE>
<TE>   "I have spoken to my brother and he is alert and in good spirits,"
said James France, who serves on NASCAR's board of directors. "The
doctors say to expect a full recovery."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Andrettis</TE>
<TE>   Is there a breech growing between Mario Andretti, the patriarch,
and Michael, the aging first son?</TE>
<TE>   Mario, who recently announced plans to form a CART team--without
Michael--was chosen this week to CART's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   "While this is a business decision for me and my family, it has
always been clear that my heart was in CART and it will be my
pleasure to help the series grow," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, CART President Chris Pook was taking a
none-too-veiled shot at Michael, who recently became majority owner
of a team that seems likely to switch to the Indy Racing League next
year.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I'm not sure how much talent is going over to the IRL,"
Pook said in answering a question on ESPN.com. "I think the guys that
consistently qualify on the front part of our grid are with us. The
more senior ones who qualify in the back part of the grid--I think
the IRL provides a good retirement opportunity for them."</TE>
<TE>   Michael, who will turn 40 on Oct. 5, is CART's all-time leading
race winner with 42 victories, the most recent in the Toyota Grand
Prix of Long Beach last April. He formed Team Andretti Green Racing
after he and several others purchased Team Green from Barry Green. He
has said that sponsors will determine which route he takes--CART or
IRL.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Tracy, one of the team's drivers, has said he will not leave
CART and is expected to join fellow Canadians Patrick Carpentier and
Alex Tagliani on the Canadian-sponsored Player's/Forsythe team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Drag Racing</TE>
<TE>   The race for top-fuel supremacy between defending champion Kenny
Bernstein in the Budweiser King and Larry Dixon in the Miller Lite
dragster, has moved on to Indianapolis where the U.S. Nationals, most
prestigious event on the National Hot Rod Assn. schedule, is being
run this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon, who had a seemingly unbeatable 259-point lead after 11
events, has seen Bernstein close the gap to 80 points with seven
nationals remaining. Bernstein, 57, beat Dixon, 36, in the season
finale last year at Pomona, then announced that he was retiring after
the 2002 season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   Todd Hunsaker and Garrett Hansen will continue their battle for
the United States Auto Club's Ford Focus midget championship Saturday
night on the third-mile oval at Irwindale Speedway. Hansen has won
three of the last four races, but Hunsaker has a 57-point lead. Also
on the Irwindale card will be late models, super stocks and Grand
American modifieds.</TE>
<TE>   Rocky Moran Jr., of Cota de Caza, won the second CART Toyota
Atlantic race of his career when he passed series leader Jon Fogerty
of Portola Valley, Calif., in the final laps at Montreal. Moran,
whose father drove in three Indy 500s, won his first race last year
at Laguna Seca. Fogerty, who holds a four-point lead, and Canadian
Michael Valiante will decide the championship Sunday in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   In finishing 16th in last Sunday's Long
Beach-to-Catalina-and-return personal watercraft race, Mike Follmer
of Fountain Valley clinched the national open expert and GranPrix
open expert championships on his Yamaha XL1200. Factory Kawasaki
rider Chris MacClugage of Baldwin Park was the winner, followed by
Mark Dobson of Vista on a Yamaha.</TE>
<TE>   Former CART champion Jimmy Vasser is the latest open-wheel driver
to join the off-road racing ranks. Vasser, who will be driving Bobby
Rahal's Shell Ford-Lola in the Grand Prix of Denver on Sunday, will
drive with former Indy car drivers Mike and Robbie Groff in Marty
Fiolka's two-seat Toyota-powered Jimco in the SCORE Baja 1000 in
November.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Americans arrived in Indianapolis for the World Basketball
Championships knowing that, without the likes of Shaquille O'Neal and
Tim Duncan on the roster, they would be tested by a tough
international field.</LD>
<LD>   But not in the opening game. Not against Algeria.</LD>
<LD>   In what amounted to a warmup drill at the RCA Dome on Thursday,
the United States eased to a 110-60 victory over an Algerian team
making its first-ever appearance in this tournament.</LD>
<TE>   "This was a good start for us," guard Paul Pierce said. "Just to
kind of get the jitters out."</TE>
<TE>   But even with many of the NBA's top names taking a pass on this
11-day tournament, the U.S. still has Jermaine O'Neal, Shawn Marion
and Andre Miller. On Thursday, it had Elton Brand scoring 17 points
and Pierce making four of eight three-point attempts for 22.</TE>
<TE>   The going should get tougher against Germany tonight and in later
rounds. In its first game, Germany was led by Dirk Nowitzki's 30
points in an 88-76 victory over China. Yao Ming, China's 7-foot-5
center, was never a factor in scoring 16 points.</TE>

<TE>   Wales' Becky Morgan, winless in two seasons on the LPGA Tour, shot
a career-best nine-under-par 63 to take the first-round lead in the
State Farm Classic at Springfield, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan birdied seven of the last 10 holes, hit 17 greens in
regulation and had only 26 putts in the bogey-free round on the Rail
Golf Course.</TE>
<TE>   France's Patricia Meunier-Lebouc opened with a 64, the best of her
LPGA Tour career, and 47-year-old Betsy King was three strokes back
at 66 along with U.S. Solheim Cup player Laura Diaz, Becky Iverson
and Jen Hanna.</TE>
<TE>   South Africa's David Frost shot a bogey-free six-under 65 to take
a one-stroke lead after the first round of the Air Canada
Championship at Surrey.</TE>
<TE>   Shigeki Maruyama, Peter Lonard, Scott Gump and Hank Kuehne opened
with 66s, and 10 more players, including Tommy Tolles, David Gossett
and Steve Lowery, shot 67s.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Mickelson will not play in next week's Canadian Open after
slightly injuring his back. Mickelson felt a twinge in his back while
lifting luggage after returning from the NEC Invitational in Seattle
earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   Former UCLA standout Duval Love, an offensive lineman for three
teams, including the Rams, during a 12-year NFL career, was arrested
on federal drug conspiracy charges in Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Attorney's Office charged Love, 39, of Coto de Caza,
Calif., with one count of conspiracy to distribute 11 pounds of
cocaine, one count of conspiracy to distribute MDMA, or Ecstasy, and
two counts of aiding another person in attempts to distribute cocaine
and Ecstasy.</TE>
<TE>   Love pleaded innocent and was released on a $100,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   The crimes occurred last year, a federal grand jury indictment
said. Neither the U.S. Attorney's Office nor Tampa police, who were
involved in the investigation, would discuss details of the case.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, he was hired as a graduate assistant coach at
Nevada Las Vegas, reuniting him with former Los Angeles Ram coach
John Robinson. The school said Love is dismissed from the team until
the charges are resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   The United States capped a dominant performance at the Pan Pacific
swimming championships with five gold medals and a world record in
the men's 4x100-meter medley relay at Yokohama, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Peirsol, Brendan Hansen, Michael Phelps and Jason Lezak
clocked 3 minutes 33.48 seconds, eclipsing the previous world mark of
3:33.73 set by the U.S. at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The relay victory gave the United States 21 gold medals in the
six-day meet. Australia was next with 11.</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Coughlin won the women's 100 freestyle, collecting her
fourth gold medal with a championship record 53.99 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR fined driver Ward Burton $5,000 for throwing the heat
shields from his shoes at Dale Earnhardt Jr. Burton was upset with
Earnhardt after the two made contact at Bristol Motor Speedway last
Saturday, with Burton getting knocked out of the race.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Marcus Barnes, who helped lead the Miami Hurricanes to last
year's NCAA tournament, was kicked off the team for an unspecified

<HD>Kimrin Gives Broncos Field Goal of 65 Yards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ola Kimrin made a 65-yard field goal and Jarious Jackson solidified
his spot as Denver's third quarterback, leading the Broncos over the
Seattle Seahawks, 31-0, Thursday night at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   Kimrin, a Swedish kicker who has little chance of making Denver's
roster with Pro Bowler Jason Elam in front of him, made the field
goal as time expired in the first half.</LD>
<LD>   The crowd stirred as Kimrin lined up for the kick from his own
45-yard line, then roared as the ball sailed through the uprights
with a few yards to spare. He was mobbed by teammates as he ran
toward the sideline after the kick.</LD>
<TE>   Elam hit a 63-yard field goal in 1998 to tie Tom Dempsey for the
longest in NFL history. Exhibition games do not count in the league
record book.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson threw for a touchdown and rushed for another score. Denver
(3-1) rested all of its starters, but the backups scored three quick
touchdowns after forcing two turnovers in the first three minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson hit Ashley Lelie on a 38-yard touchdown pass in the first
quarter, then bulled his way in for a four-yard touchdown late in the
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 28, Jacksonville 25--Cowboy linebacker Markus Steele was
taken off the field at Jacksonville, Fla., on a stretcher after
straining his neck while making a tackle.</TE>
<TE>   Steele was moving his legs and team officials said he had feeling
in all his extremities after the injury in the third quarter. He was
taken for precautionary X-rays.</TE>
<TE>   The injury came as Steele, a second-year player from USC, tumbled
over Jaguar running back Stacey Mack and his neck rolled awkwardly
and appeared to jam into his left shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 31, Arizona 3--Marques Tuiasosopo, Rich Gannon's backup at
quarterback, played all but one series in the first half, completing
11 of 16 passes for 156 yards and a touchdown, but also threw two
interceptions for the Raiders at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Just when Tuiasosopo seemed to be marching the Raiders'
first-string offense to the end zone in the team's second offensive
series, Justin Lucas intercepted a pass on the nine-yard line
intended for tight end Roland Williams.</TE>
<TE>   New England 28, Washington 14--The Patriots put an emphatic end to
Steve Spurrier's high-scoring exhibition run at Landover, Md.</TE>
<TE>   First-round draft pick Daniel Graham caught two touchdown passes,
and Mike Vrabel and rookie Jarvis Green had two sacks apiece for the
Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier's Redskins (4-1) were the first team in NFL history to
score 35 or more points in four straight exhibition games. They went
nowhere this time, trailing, 21-0, at halftime after punting on all
but one possession.</TE>
<TE>   Washington gained just 10 yards in the second quarter, and nine of
those came on a meaningless play that ran out the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 17, Minnesota 14--Kordell Stewart's running and
throwing set up two first-half touchdowns for the Steelers at
Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Playing their starters most of the first half--far longer than
Coach Bill Cowher usually does in exhibition games--the Steelers put
together two long drives to open a 14-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart's 14-yard run got them started on a 98-yard drive
highlighted by Jerome Bettis' 27-yard run and Stewart's 43-yard
completion. Bettis scored from the two on the drive's ninth play.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers came right back with an 80-yard drive that got going
with Stewart's 24-yard completion to rookie Antwaan Randle El, who
had scored three touchdowns in the previous two exhibition games.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 27, Cincinnati 14--Michael Vick showed no lasting effects
from a bruised elbow as he completed mostly short-range passes at
Cincinnati as the Falcons completed the second undefeated exhibition
season in their history.</TE>
<TE>   Vick was five for nine for 78 yards, led two touchdown drives and
was sacked twice in the first half, popping up quickly each time he
went down.</TE>
<TE>   Gus Frerotte, named the Bengals' starting quarterback on Monday,
was four for six for 67 yards in the first quarter, setting up
Brandon Bennett's 14-yard touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 24, Chicago 22--Bear quarterback Jim Miller left with a mild
right ankle sprain, backup defensive tackle Christian Peter had
X-rays on a sprained right thumb and Dolphin cornerback Patrick
Surtain hobbled off the field at Miami with a sore left groin.</TE>
<TE>   But none of the injuries should prevent them from playing in the
regular-season opener Sept. 8.</TE>
<TE>   New York Giants 13, Baltimore 0--The Giants got field goals from
their shaky kicking duo of Owen Pochman and Matt Bryant, and a late
75-yard scoring pass from Jason Garrett to Jonathan Carter at East
Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 20, Buffalo 13--Mike McMahon and Joey Harrington threw
touchdown passes and the Lions forced Sammy Morris to fumble near
their goal line late in the fourth quarter at Detroit.</TE>

<HD>Historic Day for Bellhorn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Bellhorn expected to spend the afternoon watching Sammy Sosa
return to Chicago's lineup and give the Cubs some pop.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, with Sosa sidelined by a sore neck, Bellhorn provided a
pair of home runs--and history.</LD>
<LD>   Bellhorn became the first player in National League history to hit
home runs from both sides of the plate in the same inning Thursday as
the Cubs defeated the Milwaukee Brewers, 13-10, at Milwaukee.</LD>
<TE>   "Sosa was going to play, but when he took some swings off the tee,
there was no way he was going to go," Cub Manager Bruce Kimm said.</TE>
<TE>   So, Angel Echevarria moved from first base to right field to make
room for Bellhorn, who ignited a 10-run burst in the fourth inning
with a two-run shot off left-hander Andrew Lorraine that traveled 410
feet to center field at Miller Park.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Bellhorn came up again with two out in the inning,
Lorraine had given way to right-hander Jose Cabrera. Batting from the
left side, Bellhorn connected on a full-count fastball for a
three-run, 380-foot drive that made it 9-0.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it's tough," Bellhorn said of switching stances in the
middle of a game. "I've been facing a lot of left-handers lately. You
get used to seeing the ball that way. Then you step in the box
against a righty and you feel kind of weird. After that first swing,
I'm fine."</TE>
<TE>   Bellhorn joined Carlos Baerga as the only switch-hitters in major
league history to homer from both sides of the plate in the same
inning. Baerga accomplished the feat in the seventh inning on April
8, 1993, for the Cleveland Indians against the New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 10, Colorado 6--Barry Bonds hit his 40th homer of
the season and Jeff Kent homered twice, powering the Giants over the
Rockies at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds hit his fifth homer in three games and Kent homered in his
fourth consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' 455-foot shot gave him the sixth 40-homer season of his
career. He has 607 home runs in his career.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants won their fifth in a row to move within two games of
the Dodgers in the NL wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 4, Atlanta 1--Tom Glavine's wildness led to the
Pirates' first two runs and Pittsburgh got an effective start from
Bronson Arroyo and a homer from Aramis Ramirez as it shut down the
Braves' offense again to win at home.</TE>
<TE>   Playing their third consecutive game without injured outfielder
Gary Sheffield, who has a sprained thumb, the Braves again struggled
for runs. They scored one run in the last 21 innings of the
three-game series.</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo (2-1) held Atlanta to an unearned run over five innings,
allowing five hits and striking out six.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 7, St. Louis 0--Jimmy Haynes drove in three runs and
pitched eight shutout innings as the Reds won at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Haynes (13-8) was an unlikely star--he hadn't won since Aug. 3 and
had never won 13 games in a season during his seasons with Baltimore,
Oakland and Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Woody Williams (6-4) returned from the disabled
list--rookie Jason Simontacchi was sent to triple-A Memphis--and had
his worst showing in a year. Sidelined since July 6 with a strained
muscle in his side, he gave up five runs in four innings.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 5, San Diego 0--Orlando Merced hit an RBI double and made
two outstanding throws from right field and Lance Berkman hit his
37th homer, leading the Astros at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Munro (5-2) and three relievers combined on a four-hitter. It
was the Astros' ninth shutout of the season, all at Minute Maid Park.</TE>
<TE>   Relievers Pedro Borbon, Tom Gordon and Octavio Dotel didn't allow
a hit after the third inning, retiring 18 of the last 19 batters.
Dotel got his sixth save in 10 chances.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 2, Montreal 1--Brandon Duckworth pitched seven strong
innings and Bobby Abreu hit a two-run homer off Bartolo Colon (7-3)
to lead the Phillies at Philadelphia.</TE>

<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NORMAN, Okla.</DL>
<LD>Maybe they ought to hang a banner in the quad that reads: "Men (and
Women!) at Work." Everywhere you look, people are kicking up dust,
setting out orange cones, cordoning off areas, moving boxes and
waiting for the lunch whistle to blow.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to the Reconstruction.</LD>
<LD>   At Memorial Stadium, men in hardhats bang hammers and lay steel
reinforcing rods as work continues on an 8,000-seat expansion
project.</LD>
<TE>   At the nearby intramural fields, the Oklahoma football hardhats
lay the cornerstone for another championship season.</TE>
<TE>   Aides with stop watches record the 40-yard-dash times and report
to Coach Bob Stoops, who reports to his players, "No question, this
is the fastest team we've had."</TE>
<TE>   As laborers labor, and bulldozers roar, kids watch their football
heroes from afar, clinging to chain-link fencing.</TE>
<TE>   There is no Boz anymore in Norman, yet there remains a buzz.</TE>
<TE>   The Sooner defense, led by defensive end Tommie Harris, is
track-team fast, and the offense has been revamped, along with just
about everything else on campus.</TE>
<TE>   The schedule breaks downwind. After tonight's opener at Tulsa, the
Sooners have scandal-plagued and scholarship-challenged Alabama
visiting Norman on Sept. 7 and archrival Nebraska off the schedule
this season.</TE>
<TE>   There is the annual Red River Shootout against Texas in Dallas on
Oct. 12, potentially the game of the year in college football, yet
when hasn't Oklahoma defeated Texas lately in a game that counts?</TE>
<TE>   Colorado will be a handful on Nov. 2, but the Buffaloes have to
come to Norman.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma is No. 1 in this and several other preseason
publications, and if you believe what Will Rogers said, "All I know
is just what I read in the papers," Oklahoma is headed for another
national title game appearance in this year's Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Former Sooner option quarterback J.C. Watts, the outgoing United
States congressman--he has elected not to seek another term--watched
a recent practice with renewed political interest.</TE>
<TE>   During low ebb in the late 1990s, when Oklahoma football suffered
its worst four-year stretch under former coach John Blake, Watts
rarely joined sporting conversation with his political peers.</TE>
<TE>   "I dodged the cloak room for two or three years," Watts said with
a laugh. "You know, the men of Congress have their teams. You go to
the floor and talk about your teams. And here I am saying, 'God, I'll
be glad when basketball comes around.' "</TE>
<TE>   Not that many years removed from when Oklahoma bore the face of
just another big-time, low-scrupled, win-at-all cost program destined
for NCAA probation, its players running amok, the university is in
the midst of an astounding renewal.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere between recklessness and renaissance, Oklahoma conjured
the audacious idea that it wanted to become a jewel in the crown of
colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma had the gall to think it could become a landlocked
Stanford, with lower property values.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing wrong with using that as a benchmark," Athletic
Director Joe Castiglione said.</TE>
<TE>   Reminded that Stanford was a tad better situated, geographically
and academically, Castiglione added, "We recognize our limitations."</TE>
<TE>   Norman, as a town, isn't the prettiest cowgirl to look at, when
you consider its wayward winds and flat landscape, yet that hasn't
stopped the Oklahoma Earth Movers.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Oklahoma football finished 11-2 and was ranked sixth,
only a couple of bounces shy of reaching its second consecutive bowl
championship series title game.</TE>
<TE>   The men's and women's basketball team made the Final Four, Kelvin
Sampson's squad losing in the national semifinals to Indiana while
Sherri Coale's women were defeated by Connecticut in the title game.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma notes that 2001 was the first time a school's football
team won 11 games the same season its men's and women's basketball
squads won more than 30 games.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowing from basketball's statistical line, the triple-double,
the Sooners are calling their feat a 10-30-30.</TE>
<TE>   To boot, Oklahoma won the national title in men's gymnastics and
finished third in wrestling.</TE>
<TE>   Like any development plan, Oklahoma's rise has come in stages.</TE>
<TE>   Phase I was the 1994 push-start that came from incoming school
president David Boren, the former Oklahoma governor and United States
senator, who upped the educational ante with a $500-million
fund-raising drive to improve all aspects of campus life.</TE>
<TE>   Phase II kicked in four years ago, with the hiring of Castiglione
as athletic director.</TE>
<TE>   Castiglione, who came from Missouri, oversaw all sports, but
realized Oklahoma football floated all boats. It was he who
recommended Blake be fired and he who identified, sought out and
ultimately hired defensive coordinator Bob Stoops from Steve
Spurrier's staff at Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Most thought Stoops was destined to succeed Hayden Fry at Iowa,
his alma mater, but Iowa administrators fumbled the negotiations and
Stoops landed on Castiglione's stoop.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked hard not to get left at the altar," Castiglione said.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, in 2000, Oklahoma went undefeated, claiming its
seventh national championship.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, Castiglione was patching up the rest of the
department.</TE>
<TE>   He was astonished to discover, when he took over, that there were
people in the athletic department who had never met.</TE>
<TE>   Basketball Coach Sampson said Castiglione has brought such
closeness to the department, "I swear we're going to break out a
campfire, roast marshmallows and sing 'Kumbaya.' "</TE>
<TE>   A prominent Division I football coach once said it was nearly
impossible to have great football and basketball programs at the same
school because of the friction and egos involved, not to mention the
competition for money.</TE>
<TE>   Castiglione convinced his other coaches that, with football
leading the financial way, all Oklahoma sports could prosper.</TE>
<TE>   "Oklahomans need football to do well," Sampson said. "They need it
from a health standpoint."</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, with football back on top, donations started to pour
in. Happy donors are generous donors. The athletic department
recently passed the $83-million dollar mark in an ambitious
$100-million money-raising campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma wasn't immune from tension between departments.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson's basketball squad had been top-notched for years, yet
found it difficult getting court time in its own gym.</TE>
<TE>   Coale, the women's coach, said the only way her players could get
court time was to play challenge court against other students in the
campus gym.</TE>
<TE>   "For a while," Coale said of her squad, "they weren't good
enough."</TE>
<TE>   Castiglione preached patience and told his coaches not to be
satisfied with a short-term fix. Sampson and Coale have since been
rewarded with identical lavish practice facilities built adjacent the
Lloyd Noble Center.</TE>
<TE>   What more could Coale want?</TE>
<TE>   "I could use a post player," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Buck stops with Stoops</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma's resurgence would not have been possible without
football or without Stoops, who turns 42 on Sept. 9.</TE>
<TE>   This was Phase III.</TE>
<TE>   Some coaches at big-time football schools prefer to isolate their
program from others in the department. Stoops ran a different route.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob Stoops is the key player in this whole thing," Coale said.
"He's telling everyone, 'Not only is it OK for you to be successful,
we want you to be successful.' "</TE>
<TE>   Stoops makes it a point to visit all softball recruits who come to
visit, and has been seen more than once on the first tee, whooping it
up for the women's golf team.</TE>
<TE>   Stoops was the first to shake Sampson's hand when the team
returned home after winning last year's West Regional final.</TE>
<TE>   Stoops has heard stories about football and basketball coaches who
don't get along.</TE>
<TE>   "The ones who say it can't be done, well, it's a cop-out," Stoops
said. "I wouldn't doubt that it happens in some places, but it
doesn't have to be a battle and here, it sure isn't."</TE>
<TE>   Sampson and Stoops have become close friends and allies. Sampson
plans basketball-recruiting visits around football games. If the
football team is good, it helps basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "Basketball doesn't need to be the flagship program here," Sampson
said. "We can be part of the solution, we can't be the solution."</TE>
<TE>   Sampson took some sage advice on the subject from Bob Knight.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't fight football," Knight told him.</TE>
<TE>   Coale knew as much, having grown up in Oklahoma with a house full
of devoted Sooner fans. Her upbringing was as straightforward as a
fullback belly dive.</TE>
<TE>   "You worshipped the football gods at OU," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Trent Smith, Oklahoma's star senior tight end, could tell you
about the gravity pull.</TE>
<TE>   Smith was born in Norman and dreamed of becoming a Sooner, no
matter the state of the program.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept waiting for one letter, the Oklahoma letter," Smith said
of his recruitment process.</TE>
<TE>   Smith was recruited by Blake when the program was in the tank.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   Smith confesses to having taken a recruiting trip to Notre Dame,
but says it was a token visit.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Smith said, "I sent Coach Blake a postcard from South
Bend."</TE>
<TE>   Stoops has rebuilt Sooner football, with mortar and brick.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma had gone 12-22 in the three years before he took over. In
Stoops' first three seasons, Oklahoma is 31-7 with a national
championship.</TE>
<TE>   Stoops is more like Bud Wilkinson than Barry Switzer, each of whom
coached the Sooners to three national titles. Wilkinson was a
straight-arrow who helped ease the state's collective malaise in the
aftermath of the Dust Bowl exodus.</TE>
<TE>   Switzer won ridiculously often too, yet he ran his team the way an
Old West bartender might have run his saloon.</TE>
<TE>   Stoops is no bootlegger's son.</TE>
<TE>   He is a blue-collar product of Youngstown, Ohio, the kind of place
Bruce Springsteen sings about.</TE>
<TE>   Stoops learned tenacity and discipline as defensive coordinator at
Kansas State under Bill Snyder, and untold intangibles in three years
as coordinator under Spurrier in Gainesville.</TE>
<TE>   "He changed me in a huge way," Stoops said of Spurrier, now
coaching the Washington Redskins. "He taught me to be balanced and,
he taught me to embrace the competition."</TE>
<TE>   The week of Oklahoma's national title game against Florida State
in the 2001 Orange Bowl, Stoops came off as aloof, almost cocky, in
his press-conference statements.</TE>
<TE>   He says now he was just confident, that's all, pointing out that
Florida State had never defeated Oklahoma in football.</TE>
<TE>   Still hasn't.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no way we were going to lose," Stoops said. Oklahoma's
defense dominated Florida State in a 13-2 victory.</TE>
<TE>   After sneaking up on the nation in 2000--Oklahoma was only No. 20
to start the season--Stoops faces a different task as a favorite.</TE>
<TE>   No surprise, Stoops is embracing the competition.</TE>
<TE>   He is not flustered at being ranked No. 1 in the coaches' poll and
No. 2 in the writers'.</TE>
<TE>   "None of that hurts," Stoops said.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest fear for Oklahoma fans is that, in this fragile age of
competition, the Sooner miracle could all unravel as fast as it came
together.</TE>
<TE>   Stoops has already been courted by other suitors. Castiglione was
aghast when, 20 minutes before the 2001 Orange Bowl, he was asked by
a reporter if Stoops were a candidate for the opening at Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   But the real chill hit last December when, unexpectedly, Spurrier
left Florida to coach the Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Florida job opened, my heart sort of sunk," Coale
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The reason was, no one could have blamed Stoops for leaving
Oklahoma to take over at Florida. The state of Oklahoma held its
breath as Stoops briefly pondered the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not even allowed a day to think," Stoops said. "In the
end, I had a sense of loyalty. I felt too strong about what we're
doing here."</TE>
<TE>   Stoops can't leave the program now.</TE>
<TE>   Why not?</TE>
<TE>   The paint's not even dry.</TE>

<HD>Rogge Praises Commission</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge wouldn't
disclose his opinion of an internal commission's recommendation that
softball, baseball and modern pentathlon be dropped from the Games
and rugby and golf be added, if the two sports can guarantee
participation of their top athletes.</LD>
<LD>   And he said the endorsement of rugby--which he played--was
coincidental. "I had absolutely no intervention in the proceedings of
the program commission," he said Thursday during a news conference
that ended IOC executive board meetings in Lausanne, Switzerland. "My
sport in the Olympics was sailing, and that is on the list of
changes, so the international sailing federation will look at me with
angry eyes."</LD>
<LD>   But Rogge's praise of the commission that put the three sports on
the chopping block hinted it's on the right track.</LD>
<TE>   "What I think is very important is that a commission of renowned
experts has given a signal that there is a problem with some
federations," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the expense of constructing venues, low spectator and media
interest, and the absence of the world's top baseball players because
of a conflict with Major League Baseball's season, the committee
proposed eliminating the three sports after the 2004 Athens Games. It
backed adding seven-man rugby, which it said has "global
participation and ... high spectator and broadcast appeal," and golf,
because of its "simplicity to understand ... and the very high
spectator and broadcast appeal."</TE>
<TE>   The executive board will make a recommendation to the IOC assembly
in November in Mexico City. A simple majority of votes at the
assembly is needed to delete a sport, but a two-thirds majority is
required to add one.</TE>
<TE>   Aware of Rogge's desire to limit the Summer Games to 28 sports,
300 events and 10,500 athletes, the commission also recommended
eliminating canoe-kayak slalom, one wrestling discipline,
synchronized swimming's team event and racewalk events. It proposed
reducing the number of events and participants in sailing, and
refused to admit roller sports, polo, surfing, bridge, chess, bowling
and racquetball.</TE>
<TE>   To IOC member Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles, eliminating softball
and baseball would be a move backward.</TE>
<TE>   "My understanding was that since 1996, the IOC has had a
commitment to make sure any sport brought to the program would
include men and women," she said. "I don't know of any moment that
changed....</TE>
<TE>   "Often there's an assertion that the women's part of a discipline
is at not as high a level as the men's, and to me, that's
disingenuous. I feel their arguments don't pertain really to the
issues, and furthermore, they're going to deprive women of a team
sport, which is important for women aspiring to be Olympic athletes."</TE>
<TE>   Don Porter, president of the international softball federation,
disputed the claims of low spectator and media interest. He said
softball has 124 national federations, more than many other Olympic
sports, and sold 84% of seats for games at Atlanta and Sydney. He
also said 73 reporters covered the recent world championships in
Saskatoon, Canada, including reporters from China, Japan, Australia
and Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to think of the young girls all over the world who want to
be Olympians and play softball," he said. "Their dreams could be
crushed."</TE>
<TE>   He attributed softball's tenuous status--which he learned of in a
"Dear John" letter from Rogge slipped under the door of his Lausanne
hotel room--to jealousy of U.S. success and a lack of U.S. officials
at the executive level of international federations. Porter and Jim
Easton, president of the international archery federation, are the
only Americans to hold that office.</TE>
<TE>   "We've lost a lot of influence in the last few years," Porter
said. "Most people know the Europeans control the Olympics because
they have the votes.... For them to take a women's sport off the
program after saying they want to add women's sports would be a big
mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Trying to Figure Skating</TE>
<TE>   The International Skating Union's revised judging system will get
its first test this week at the Nebelhorn Trophy competition in
Obertsdorf, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   The scores of nine judges will be randomly selected from a
14-judge panel to compute competitors' scores, a move designed to
minimize the deal making that has tainted the sport's judging. In
addition, a separate, small judging panel will use the proposed new
cumulative scoring system, in which skaters will be graded from 0 to
6.0 based on elements they perform. That panel's marks won't
determine the winners, but judges' comments will be considered in
future modifications. Both systems will get another tryout at Skate
Canada in October.</TE>
<TE>   "[Random selection] is probably a step forward, but I don't think
it's the final solution," veteran coach John Nicks said. "I'm not as
confident in the scoring system at all. The addition to notes and key
strokes judges will make during a performance or after a performance
could increase the lack of attention to the performance."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. pair champions Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman have pulled out
of their Grand Prix assignments. They have signed with Stars on Ice,
whose U.S. tour is not sanctioned by the U.S. Figure Skating Assn.
They have until Tuesday to file a regional entry form to maintain
their eligibility for the 2003 U.S. championships.</TE>
<TE>   Aliso Viejo skaters Rena Inoue and John Baldwin Jr. will keep
their Skate America assignment, which will be a skateoff against
Kristen Roth and Michael McPherson for a berth in the NHK Trophy
competition.</TE>
<TE>   In other news, Naomi Nari Nam of Irvine resumed training with
Nicks in Aliso Viejo after a serious hip injury.</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Barb Lindquist, ranked second in the world by the International
Triathlon Union and winner of the Mrs. T's Triathlon last weekend in
Chicago, has entered the City of L.A. Triathlon, to be held Sept. 8.
Lindquist won the L.A. Triathlon in 2000 and was second last year to
Nicole Hackett of Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Also registered are five-time men's world champion Simon Lessing

<HD>Irons Is Making Waves Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andy Irons' has a philosophy any professional athlete can appreciate:
"I like to go really fast, do a lot of powerful turns and look good
the whole time."</LD>
<LD>   He also likes to soar really high, which perhaps has a different
meaning today than it did during his early years on the Assn. of
Surfing Professionals tour.</LD>
<LD>   "In those years, surfing on the tour was a dream come true," Irons
says. "I was coming fresh out of high school and getting paid to go
on holiday to all these different countries. I was only 18 but in
most of those countries I was old enough to drink. I was able to go
into clubs and it was all about drinks and girls and friends. Life
was all about going off and just having fun."</LD>
<TE>   What Irons failed to realize at the time was that partying was
taking its toll. He was not living up to expectations and,
eventually, would sink so low that he considered kicking out of
competitive surfing altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he stuck with it, and today, with a clearer head and a
work ethic befitting a top-level athlete, Irons, 24, of Princeville,
Kauai, is well on his way to winning his first world title.</TE>
<TE>   He will bring to Southern California next week a No. 1 rating on
the World Championship Tour and an explosive style, blending power
and speed with new-school acrobatics, that has made him a favorite
among thousands of young surfers around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Now he has every aspect of his life handled and all he has to
worry about is surfing, and that's what he does best," says Mike
Parsons, contest director for the Boost Mobile Pro at Lower Trestles
near San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   The four-day event, featuring the world's top 44 surfers, plus
four wild-card entries, has a nine-day competition window beginning
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   It is the only WCT event being held this year on the U.S. mainland
and the first since the Billabong Pro two years ago at Trestles.
Irons won that event, and another victory at the legendary break
would all but make him a shoo-in as world champion.</TE>
<TE>   With victories in two of five WCT events this season, at Bells
Beach in Australia, and in thunderous crushers at Teahupoo in Tahiti,
Irons has built a commanding lead over all but his closest pursuers,
Michael Lowe of Port Kembla, Australia, and Shea Lopez of Satellite
Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he is not ready to celebrate just yet; not with seven
events left and so many superstars on his trail, among them reigning
world champion C.J. Hobgood, currently rated ninth; Joel Parkinson,
fourth; Taj Burrow, 10th, and Kelly Slater, the six-time world
champion who is back on tour after a three-year hiatus and, as his
No. 21 rating suggests, is still struggling.</TE>
<TE>   "Slater is a freak show," Irons says affectionately of an athlete
he has been compared to. "He could easily go out there and win four
events in a row and steal this thing from everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but Irons is making the most of his time in the sun. Born
and raised on Kauai, he began to excel at the sport not long after
standing up for the first time, when he was 8.</TE>
<TE>   He and his younger brother, Bruce, pushed each other to new
heights as they surfed almost every day, before and after, and
undoubtedly, at times, during school sessions. They developed the
hard-driving power-and-speed style of surfing necessary to negotiate
the fast and hollow waves breaking over the island reefs.</TE>
<TE>   Andy turned pro first, surfing on the Hawaiian circuit then later
on the ASP's World Qualifying Series circuit, with the ultimate goal
of earning enough points to someday reach the WCT. He attained that
goal in 1998, at which time he was being hailed as the next Slater.</TE>
<TE>   By then, though, his hard-driving lifestyle had begun to catch up
to him, much as it had caught up to and ruined the careers of others
before him.</TE>
<TE>   "We would stay up until 3 a.m. the night before contests, getting
wasted," Irons says. "You learn the hard way that you can't get by
for long by doing that."</TE>
<TE>   Reality struck hard in 1998, when Irons failed to requalify for
the WCT. He would have to work his way back through the longer and
more grueling WQS circuit, on which his brother is now competing,
although Bruce Irons has been awarded a wild-card entry for the
Trestles event.</TE>
<TE>   Failing to requalify was a turning point for Irons: It was either
quit or turn his attention totally to surfing.</TE>
<TE>   His supporters, and he had many, persuaded him to stay with it and
he has been progressing steadily since. He finished the 2000 season
ranked 16th and last season he was No. 10.</TE>
<TE>   "What's different about him now is that he's incredibly focused
and has a super-deep desire to win," Parsons says.</TE>
<TE>   Irons still drinks on occasion, he says, "but never on the night
before contests." He now has a girlfriend who accompanies him during
much of his travels, and with the generous support of several
high-profile sponsors--they pay him well in excess of what he makes
on the tour--he again is living a dream.</TE>
<TE>   "It was always a dream of mine to surf for a living but I never
thought I'd be making the money I do," he says. "I thought I'd be
lucky just to be able to pay the bills and get by. Now I'm super
stoked. I've got a killer car, a nice house and all the toys I want."</TE>
<TE>   The only thing missing is a crown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Taking the timing of the Trestles event into consideration,
organizers have decided to have a paddle-out ceremony on Sept. 11 in
honor of those who lost their lives and whose lives were forever
changed as a result of the terrorist attacks. The ceremony is open to
anyone wishing to attend and will take place after the raising of the
flag at 6:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Says event spokesman Bill Sharp, "If there will be tears shed on
the morning of Sept. 11, I say let them fall into the waters of
Trestles where they may mix together in the healing waters of our
ocean refuge."</TE>
<TE>   Trestles is located within San Onofre State Park.</TE>

<TE>   News and Notes</TE>
<TE>   * Dove hunting: Sunday's season opener is shaping up as one of the
best in years in some parts of the state, notably the Imperial Valley
and even across the border on and near the lower Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   "It's looking pretty dang good," says Richard Sprague, owner of
Sprague's Sports &amp; RV in Yuma, Ariz. "There are some scenarios where
there are no birds but the fields that have them are just packed."</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Mulcahy, a Department of Fish and Game biologist in Blythe,
adds, "There are more doves in the Imperial and Palo Verde valleys
than I've ever seen, and I've been here 13 years."</TE>
<TE>   A bonus for hunters in the Imperial Valley this year is the
expansion of a cooperative program aimed at generating more
opportunities. The DFG, Desert Wildlife Unlimited and several other
agencies have developed and planted, with mostly wheat and safflower,
27 large fields on private lands accessible to the general public
during the 15-day hunting season.</TE>
<TE>   "All have been thrashed and are ready to go," Mulcahy said.</TE>
<TE>   Their locations can be found in the Hunting in California section
at www.dfg.ca.gov.</TE>
<TE>   Other popular areas in the region are the Wister and Finney-Ramer
units of the state-run Imperial Wildlife Area near Niland. Details:
(760) 359-0577.</TE>
<TE>   * Saltwater fishing: Sashimi lovers have been in heaven this week.
Bluefin tuna, which for so long have been reachable only by those
aboard San Diego-based vessels, are in U.S. waters and being targeted
by boats as far north as Los Angeles, in an area 90 miles offshore.</TE>
<TE>   "And they're the bigger fish too, averaging about 40 pounds," says
Don Ashley, owner of Pierpoint Landing in Long Beach. The Aztec
returned to Pierpoint from a 1 1/2-day trip Wednesday with 76 bluefin
and as many smaller albacore. The largest was an 85-pound bluefin
caught by Gary Halberman of Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   Freshwater fishing: Those heading to the Eastern Sierra this
weekend for a final summer fling will find their favorite fishing
holes teeming with trout. Lakes and streams throughout Inyo and Mono
counties have received bonus plants from the DFG in anticipation of
large holiday crowds. There had been concern over whether Mono
County's Hot Creek Fish Hatchery would be able to meet its delivery
schedule, because of personnel shortages, but the Mono County Board
of Supervisors lent both equipment and employees, and deliveries have
been made all week. Alpers Ranch has been busy as well, planting its
popular trophy-sized trout.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   A man and his teenage son were fishing last week off Florida when
they found a human head floating on the surface. Using a gaff, they
brought it aboard, but rather than run for the coast they stuck the
head in a bag and continued fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Said the father, Paul Trabulsy, "We didn't want to come in right
away, so we just put it in a bag in a bucket. It'd been out there a
while--what's a couple of hours?"</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are investigating.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark these words: Washington will win eight or more games this year.
Six will be fourth-quarter comebacks. Expect a field goal to carom
off an upright to produce one victory, an opposing quarterback to
fall down on a fourth-down naked bootleg to save another and one win
to come after Coach Rick Neuheisel sprinkles magic dust on the
kicker's foot.</LD>
<LD>   Or, maybe, just maybe, this is the year Neuheisel's luck runs out.</LD>
<LD>   Three years at Washington have produced a 19-5 record, a Rose Bowl
championship, nothing lower than second place in the Pacific 10
Conference and, inevitably, some backlash.</LD>
<TE>   Last year's 8-4 Holiday Bowl team went 5-1 in games decided by
five or fewer points. The squad that won the 2001 Rose Bowl game
trailed in eight of its 11 victories and pulled off five consecutive
fourth-quarter comebacks in one stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Washington opens Saturday, at Michigan, with every intention of
further milking this combination of talent and trickery.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Michigan had the game won in Seattle before Washington
blocked a field-goal attempt for a score and ran back an interception
to pull out a 23-18 win.Yet, despite the usual high expectations, the
feeling in Washington is not as happy-go-lucky. Neuheisel, not close
to his prime at 41, has gone from an offensive coach into defensive
mode.</TE>
<TE>   He started it, instigating an off-season squabble among Pac-10
coaches over recruiting that ended with Neuheisel begging forgiveness
and conference Commissioner Tom Hansen calling for a truce.</TE>
<TE>   "I regret it got personal in the papers," Hansen said. "I
certainly don't expect to have that happen again."</TE>
<TE>   In August, Neuheisel was summoned to Philadelphia to answer for 51
alleged NCAA violations during his four years as Colorado coach.</TE>
<TE>   Although the potential infractions are considered secondary, they
do cast a shadow.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never been my intention to be 'slick' or 'shady,' "
Neuheisel explained recently.</TE>
<TE>   No one has come out and called Neuheisel a cheater. Rather, the
complaint is that he interprets the NCAA rule book sort of the way
Bill Clinton interprets the definition of "is."</TE>
<TE>   A UCLA graduate with a law degree from USC, Neuheisel does not
deny using his legal mind to navigate prickly NCAA issues.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen, whose conference monitors its institutions on rules
issues, says he does not expect Neuheisel to become a serial
infractions offender.</TE>
<TE>   What Hansen did say was, "Rick is trying to see where the edge is
all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado Coach Gary Barnett, who inherited most of the NCAA mess
of his predecessor, doesn't think Neuheisel is a scoundrel.</TE>
<TE>   What Barnett said was, "Rick does it by the letter of the law, but
not the spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the charges levied against Neuheisel at Colorado could be
considered garden variety, mostly unauthorized contacts with
recruits--they're known in the Southeastern Conference as parking
tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most disturbing thing about the situation is the
depths to which educated men will go to beat the recruiting pants off
other educated men.</TE>
<TE>   Example: NCAA rules prohibit a head coach from visiting a recruit
off-campus more than once, yet the coach can make phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   Neuheisel says he would get around this rule by parking his car
across the street of a recruit and then having the player look out
his window. Then, Neuheisel would flash his car lights to let the
recruit know he was there.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA called him on this one, yet was it technically a
violation?</TE>
<TE>   "I read the rules," Neuheisel said.</TE>
<TE>   Neuheisel says, in recruiting, there is nothing wrong with taking
every available advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to curtail creativity," he said. "That's our
culture. That's who we are. That's our country, people trying to get
better."</TE>
<TE>   Where does it end?</TE>
<TE>   There may come a point, maybe soon, when Neuheisel grows tired of
answering rule-book questions and seeks the next logical challenge.
Terry Donahue, his old college coach, is general manager of the San
Francisco 49ers and an executive who does not always appear in
harmony with Steve Mariucci.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers are only one team that might solicit the services of a
41-year-old coach with a Midas touch.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL may not be the end-all for Neuheisel, but the upside in
pro ball is no NCAA committee on infractions and no need to flick on
your high beams.</TE>
<TE>   Pac Bits</TE>
<TE>   If you can't qualify for a bowl game out of the Pac-10 this year,
you're not trying. The conference now has six ties to bowl games with
the addition of the Insight.com and Silicon Valley bowls. What hasn't
changed: The conference champion will play in the Rose Bowl, which
returns to the traditional format after last year's bowl championship
series title game, with the No. 2 and No. 3 schools going to the
Holiday and Sun bowls.</TE>
<TE>   The Insight.com Bowl will pit the Pac-10 No. 4 versus the Big East
No. 3, the Las Vegas Bowl will match the Pac-10 No. 5 with the
Mountain West No. 2 and the Silicon Valley Classic will feature the
Pac-10 No. 6 versus Western Athletic Conference's No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Don't try to purchase tickets for the following games this year:
Arizona-USC, Arizona State-UCLA, California-Oregon, Oregon
State-Washington State or Stanford-Washington. These games are
"misses" on the 2002 Pac-10 schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Looking for a positive note to usher in the Jeff Tedford era at
Cal? The Golden Bears have a good shot to extend their winning streak
to three games. After starting 0-10 last year, they closed with a
victory at Rutgers and open the 2002 season at home against Baylor
and New Mexico State, which combined to go 8-15.</TE>
<TE>   Schools were allowed 12 games this year because of an extra
Saturday in the fall, yet Stanford has elected to stick with its
11-game schedule. Give the Cardinal credit for keeping its priorities
straight, although lost revenue isn't as much of a concern in Palo
Alto as other places. Also, not playing an extra game early in the
season gives Stanford an extra week to figure out a way to finally
beat San Jose State.</TE>

<HD>Seagren Clears Air in Pole Controversy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Ortega</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One part of Bob Seagren would like to say that the reason he didn't
win his second consecutive gold medal in the pole vault in 1972 was
an International Amateur Athletic Federation ruling that prevented
him from competing with his regular poles.</LD>
<LD>   But, today, the other admits that breezy, misty conditions on the
day of the Olympic final would have made it difficult for him to
clear 18 feet using his regular poles.</LD>
<LD>   "Having to vault on [poles that weren't mine] might have been a
blessing in disguise because of the conditions," said Seagren, 56.
"If I had been allowed to jump on my regular poles, I might have been
too aggressive and ended up [failing to clear a height]."</LD>
<TE>   Seagren, a USC graduate, had cleared a world-record 18-5 3/4 in
winning the U.S. Olympic trials in Eugene, Ore., on July 2. But three
weeks later, the IAAF banned the poles that Seagren and many other
vaulters, including U.S. teammate Jan Johnson, were using.</TE>
<TE>   The IAAF contended that the newly developed poles had carbon
fibers in them, making the implements lighter but just as strong as
older-model poles. It also said that some of the world's top
vaulters, such as Seagren, had easier access to the poles than
others, such as Wolfgang Nordwig of East Germany.</TE>
<TE>   George Moore, a representative of the company that manufactured
the banned Cata-Pole 550+, produced documents alleging that there
were no carbon fibers in the pole and that all of the world's top
vaulters had received some of them.</TE>
<TE>   Seagren, now in his second year as the chief executive officer of
International City Racing after appearing in several episodic
television series during the 1970s and '80s, wasn't concerned with
the ban because he was confident he could vault equally well on his
poles deemed legal for competition.</TE>
<TE>   But the IAAF, using methods that were highly questionable,
according to Track &amp; Field News magazine, mistakenly banned many
"legal" poles during an implement inspection the day before the
qualifying round.</TE>
<TE>   In the final, Seagren cleared 17-8 1/2, finishing second behind
Nordwig, who cleared an Olympic-record 18- 1/2 to become the first
non-American to win an Olympic gold medal in the pole vault.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson won the bronze medal at 17-6 3/4. The Illinois native is
now one of the nation's most respected pole-vault coaches. He
conducts four vault camps a year from his home in Atascadero and
holds annual camps in four other states.</TE>
<TE>   "To clear 18 feet in those conditions was quite an
accomplishment," Seagren said. "But I was very upset at the time."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>This wouldn't have happened to the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant would not have missed the first game of the NBA Finals
because he slipped and fell on a rain-dampened step because the team
bus was not allowed, in the middle of a downpour, to pull into a
tunnel.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers would not have been told that since the bomb-sniffing
dogs weren't at the arena, to please back up the bus and exit in the
storm.</LD>
<TE>   But that's what happened Thursday night to the Sparks at Madison
Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   Tamecka Dixon, the Sparks' starting guard, missed Game 1 of the
WNBA Finals because she hurt her back and right knee after slipping
on wet bus steps and falling on the way to the morning shoot-around.</TE>
<TE>   When the bus arrived at Madison Square Garden and was pointed
toward the tunnel where most team buses load and unload, the driver
was told to back up. According to Spark Coach Michael Cooper, MSG
security told the driver there were no bomb-sniffing dogs available.
No dogs, no bus under the Garden.</TE>
<TE>   So the bus backed up onto a busy Manhattan street. The Sparks
dashed down the steps and ran toward the door.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon, one of the last ladies off, when the stairs were the
wettest and most slippery, tumbled and fell. Her back slammed against
the bus stairs. Her right knee hyperextended. Dixon lost her breath
for a minute, then began to cry, in pain and in anguish.</TE>
<TE>   She had grown up in nearby Linden, N.J., and forever Dixon had
dreamed of this night, of the chance to participate in a playoff game
at Madison Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember watching [Charles] Oakley, [Anthony] Mason, Patrick
[Ewing], you know, the rough boys," Dixon said. "I went to those
games and I loved it, the atmosphere, the toughness in this building.
When we found out we were going to be playing the Liberty in the
finals, you can't believe how excited I was."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon was sitting in a locker room, her voice hoarse from yelling
for her teammates, her right knee wrapped in ice, her back stiff and
sore. She was holding a box score that totaled up the statistics in
the Sparks' 71-63 victory over New York in Game 1 of the WNBA
championship series.</TE>
<TE>   Next to Dixon's name it said: DNP--Coach's Decision.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't totally accurate. The coach did not make this
decision. Some security guards, who were unwilling or unable to use
common sense, made the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon spent the afternoon in a hospital emergency room. Her knee
was swelling, her back was aching. X-rays and MRIs were taken. The
results were inconclusive and she was given the opportunity to warm
up.</TE>
<TE>   She limped onto the court about two hours before the game, tried
to shoot, tried to cut, tried to get some spring in her legs, and
nothing happened.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to play at 60 percent," Dixon said, "and maybe hurt
my team and hurt myself worse."</TE>
<TE>   So with about 40 family members yelling her name, Dixon sat on the
bench next to Cooper and screamed. She clenched her fists, she
clutched her head when the Liberty led by nine in the first half and
she fiddled with her headband as the Sparks rolled into the lead in
the second half.</TE>
<TE>   It is admirable and understandable that in this city, so close to
the anniversary of Sept. 11, security is a high priority. But common
sense shouldn't be tossed aside.</TE>
<TE>   "If this were a men's team," Cooper said, "if this were the
Lakers, these players would not have been getting off that bus in the
rain."</TE>
<TE>   "If this were the Lakers," forward DeLisha Milton said, "they'd be
strewing rose petals on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   A Madison Square Garden spokesperson said proper policy was
followed. Cooper wondered if this meant the Sparks were supposed to
supply the bomb-sniffing dogs along with their uniforms. NBA
spokesman Brian McIntyre said he understood that some men's teams had
been unloaded in the street. But probably not in the rain, and
McIntyre also admitted that maybe common sense would have allowed for
some other accommodation.</TE>
<TE>   The WNBA has been aching for this glamour matchup in its
championship series for the six years of its existence. But the
series is devalued, the glamour tarnished, when one of the best
players is injured because somebody wearing a uniform and enjoying
authority couldn't stop for a moment, think and act intelligently.</TE>
<TE>   "You know," Dixon said, "if they weren't going to let us into the
tunnel, maybe somebody could have brought out an umbrella or
something. Or maybe a towel to wipe the steps."</TE>
<TE>   If it was bomb-sniffing dogs that were needed, somebody with the
league should have made sure bomb-sniffing dogs were on the job.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks won, so no harm, no foul, right? But there was Dixon,
an hour after the game, being hugged by her mom, Portia. Both cried a
little. A dream was left unrealized and for no good reason.</TE>

<HD>He'd Like to Sack Rules Protecting Quarterbacks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRUCE SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLISLE, Pa.</DL>
<LD>The Washington Redskins have a new coach, a new logo and a new
attitude. But some things have stayed the same. Defensive end Bruce
Smith is still around, heading into his 18th NFL season. He's one of
the dominant defensive players in league history. His five sacks last
season increased his total to 186, leaving him second only to Reggie
White, who had 198.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, 39, who has sacked 69 quarterbacks, has assembled a record
13 seasons in which he reached double-digit sack numbers. He was the
league's defensive player of the year in 1990 and '96, and has made
the Pro Bowl 11 times.</LD>
<LD>   He underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee in May to have
scar tissue shaved. Two months earlier, he had a bone spur removed
and scar tissue shaved in his left knee.</LD>
<TE>   In part because of those minor surgeries, some people have
suggested he might be better used this season as a pass-rush
specialist. But Smith wants to be an every-down fixture at right
defensive end, as he has been throughout his career, with Buffalo
from 1985 through '99 and with the Redskins the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin Lewis, Washington's new defensive coordinator, said Smith
will play as much as he feels he's able.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to limit what his role is," Lewis said in June.
"That's not fair to Bruce. Bruce has been an every-down player, and
if he can still go out and be an every-down player, just like he did
last year, he'll do that."</TE>
<TE>   Whichever way it goes, Smith has been there and done that and has
some definite ideas on pro football.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Is the NFL too concerned about protecting quarterbacks?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: We're just treating them like babies, to be honest with
you. They have rules to protect them, and I agree with some of the
rules. But some of the rules are just a little bit overprotecting. It
seems as though we're expendable and they aren't. You notice that
they just started coming down with chop-blocking rules, and that's
been going on for years and years. Guys' careers have been ended.</TE>
<TE>   Q: A lot of offensive linemen live by the cut block. Denver's line
has made a career of it. The league has made some changes over the
years and this season plans to keep a closer eye on chop-blocking.
Does more need to be done?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. Anyone that has to do something underhanded, such as using
cheap tactics, cheap blocks and so forth, to gain an advantage,
should not be allowed on the field. If they can cut block, explain to
me why, when there's an interception, we can't cut block? I mean,
after an interception, we're on offense and they're on defense,
right?</TE>
<TE>   Q: So, say, if another Redskin defender intercepts a pass, are you
going to be tentative about hitting the quarterback on the return?</TE>
<TE>   A: Well, if he makes a move toward trying to make a tackle, I'm
going to block him. That's what I've been taught to do. I'll have to
suffer the consequences. If he's just standing there, I agree, I
shouldn't be allowed to hit him.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Now that Marv Levy and Jim Kelly are in the Hall of Fame, is
the door wide open for other Bills--even though the team lost four
consecutive Super Bowls?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't think a team will ever get to four Super Bowls in a row
again. I don't think anyone will get three in the near future, or for
quite some time. The fact that Marv Levy and Jim have gone in, I hope
it's a domino effect. It's one that's well deserved. We've made
history, either way you look at it. It took a great deal of
determination, overcoming adversity, perseverance to continue at such
a high level for all those years. That's where all of those guys have
to be commended.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Pittsburgh has had a lot of success with the 3-4 defense over
the years, and New England used it a lot last season. Seeing as this
is a copycat league, and that linebackers are easier to find than
good defensive linemen, do you expect other teams to use the 3-4 more
this season?</TE>
<TE>   A: I played in a 3-4 for 15 years, and it's a tough way to make a
living. I don't want to go back to it. If you can find four excellent
linebackers--or two good ones and two great ones--it's a different
story. But I don't want any more part of a 3-4.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've played 17 seasons. Would you like to set a record for
longevity?</TE>
<TE>   A: Look at [teammate and cornerback] Darrell Green. He's been in
the league for 19 years. That's phenomenal. I can say at defensive
back, you have a better chance than at defensive lineman--the wear
and tear on the body, taking on the double teams and so forth. But
either way you slice it, defensive back or defensive end, it's a
phenomenal career.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How many more years for you?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'm taking it one year at a time and I'm listening to my body.
I'm not looking past this year. I'll get to that point after the
season's over.</TE>

<LD>Real Madrid midfielder Zinedine Zidane, whose volleyed goal against
Bayer Leverkusen in last season's final won the European Champions
League for the Spanish club, Thursday was named the league's top
player.</LD>
<LD>   The team claimed four of the six awards presented at a UEFA gala
in Monte Carlo. In addition to France's Zidane, Brazil's Roberto
Carlos was named top defender, Spain's Raul was named top forward and
Vicente del Bosque was named top coach. The goalkeeping award went to
Germany's Oliver Kahn of Bayern Munich, while German teammate Michael
Ballack was named the top midfielder for leading Leverkusen to the
title game.</LD>
<LD>   Lennart Johansson, the Swedish president of UEFA, also presented
Newcastle United and former England national team coach Bobby Robson,
69, with a special award for his lifetime contributions to the sport.
Brazilian forward Jardel of Sporting Lisbon won the Golden Shoe as
the top scorer in Europe with 42 goals.</LD>

<HD>Sparks Push Their Way to the Front of the Class</HD>
<DH>WNBA Finals: They get physical in 71-63 victory over
Liberty, leaving them a win away from a repeat championship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Sparks have been waiting for the right moment to wipe the smirks
off the faces of Liberty players. They had lost their last two
regular-season meetings here, and had to hear taunts from fans that
they were softer than New York pizza.</LD>
<LD>   But on Thursday the Sparks not only stood up to the Liberty, the
defending champions beat New York at its own physical style of play
to win Game 1 of the WNBA Finals, 71-63.</LD>
<LD>   The Sparks can win their second championship with a victory
Saturday at Staples Center. A New York victory in Game 2 would force
a deciding game on Sunday, also at Staples.</LD>
<TE>   No amount of frenzied pleading from the 17,666 fans at Madison
Square Garden or the playing of Frank Sinatra's "New York, New York"
could keep the Sparks from winning their eighth game in a row, and
fifth consecutive in the playoffs. Not with Mwadi Mabika leading all
scorers with 20 points, and DeLisha Milton and Lisa Leslie adding 17
and 15 points, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a philosophy that started three years ago that
championships are won on the road," Leslie said. "We feel like we
have to make the road our home. And, with the regular-season schedule
so tough, it prepared us to be ready here in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Not even the absence of starting guard Tamecka Dixon from the
lineup could keep the Sparks from dominating the Liberty on the
boards (37-25) and holding New York to 28 second-half points,
including one basket in the final 5:31. They also reduced Tamika
Whitmore, the Liberty's leading scorer in the playoffs, to a
spectator. Whitmore made two of nine shots and scored five points.</TE>
<TE>   "Tamika has always been a vital part of their offense," Milton
said. "I had to contest every shot she took."</TE>
<TE>   Becky Hammon came off the bench to lead the Liberty with 18
points.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to tip your hat to the Liberty for giving us all they
had," Spark Coach Michael Cooper said. "Now we've got two in L.A.,
and I feel better about our chances to complete this thing."</TE>
<TE>   The Liberty, which has lost three previous WNBA Finals, is 0-2 on
the road this postseason.</TE>
<TE>   "Well it makes it more difficult," Hammon said. "But we're not
flying out to L.A. just to lose. I have as much confidence in our
team as I did [before the game]."</TE>
<TE>   But New York Coach Richie Adubato acknowledged the Sparks have
created problems.</TE>
<TE>   "They took our inside game away [tonight]," Adubato said. "Without
Dixon they went to a big lineup, and we had some problems matching up
with their size. We tried to press them ... but we couldn't. Any time
a team rebounds that well and defends our low post game, it's very
tough unless you can force turnovers."</TE>
<TE>   The day began badly for the Sparks when Dixon was hurt in the
morning.</TE>
<TE>   The team bus pulled up to the Garden in a driving rain. The driver
asked to pull into a dry area but was rebuffed by security guards who
told the driver there were no bomb-sniffing dogs there to inspect the
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   As the team got off in the street, Dixon, the next-to-last player
to exit, slipped on the last step of the bus and landed on her back.
She also bent back her right leg, injuring the patella tendon.</TE>
<TE>   Although she spent the day getting treatment, Dixon was not in the
starting lineup. Latasha Byears took her place, scoring six points
with 11 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "My back is stiff, but I'm more concerned about my knee," Dixon
said. "I tried to warm up, but my knee is messed up. I didn't want to
play at 60% tonight and not be available on Saturday."</TE>
<TE>   When asked if Dixon could play Saturday, Cooper said, "It will be
a game-time decision. We'll have to see how much swelling she'll have
after the plane ride home."</TE>
<TE>   New York jumped out to a 31-22 lead in the first 14 minutes,
thanks in part to seven three-point shots in 10 attempts. The Liberty
was successfully running the Sparks through a maze of screens until
Crystal Robinson (13 points) and Hammon, who each had three
three-point baskets, had a clear look. When that didn't work, Tari
Phillips worked free for layups.</TE>
<TE>   But Mwadi, Leslie and Milton did not let the game get away. When
the Sparks closed the first half on a 13-4 run to tie the game at 35,
they felt they had survived the Liberty's best shot.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a tendency to come out and play better in our second
halves," Leslie said. "We felt good going in tied."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>WNBA President Val Ackerman sounded optimistic Thursday that the
negotiations between the league and the players' union on a contract
for next season won't dissolve into the kind of acrimonious,
dragged-out affairs that have harmed other sports.</LD>
<LD>   "I have been in contact recently with Pam Wheeler, director of
operations for the WNBA Players Assn., and we have been talking about
a framework for bargaining as well as a timetable for that," Ackerman
said.</LD>
<LD>   "As always, we remain committed to a bargaining process and a
dialogue that will be open in all respects. We're very hopeful that
will lead to a successful agreement prior to the start of next
season."</LD>
<TE>   The contract between the players and the league expires on Sept.
15, and Ackerman said there is no start date for formal negotiations.
But she felt there would be "plenty of time" to get an agreement in
place before the 2003 season begins in May.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman said it "looks pretty secure" for San Antonio to have a
WNBA franchise next season.</TE>
<TE>   She said no decision had been reached on the fate of Charlotte,
which may be forced to relocate because the NBA Hornets left for New
Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to think that Charlotte has great promise in the
women's basketball market," Ackerman said.</TE>

<HD>Hewitt and Blake Get to Do It Again</HD>
<DH>U.S. Open: One year after controversy, the defending
champion and promising American set up Saturday meeting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Five minutes and a court separated James Blake and Lleyton Hewitt of
Australia, and finally, the inevitable occurred and they were linked
in the same sentence at the U.S. Open.</LD>
<LD>   Again.</LD>
<LD>   If it seems they've been down this road before, well, they have.
Only it was last year. Hewitt beat Blake in a controversial
second-round, roller-coaster ride in a packed Louis Armstrong
Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, Hewitt was back out there as the defending champion
and top-seeded player, defeating qualifier Noam Okun of Israel, 7-6,
(7), 6-4, 6-1, fighting off two set points in the opening set.</TE>
<TE>   Blake had a little more trouble on the adjoining Grandstand Court,
beating Nikolay Davydenko of Russia, 6-3, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3. He reached
the third round five minutes before Hewitt, and they'll play
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   That there was tennis played at all was stunning. Storms hovered
over the New York area all morning and it rained into the afternoon.
Play started about five hours late, and officials were able to get
through almost all of the scheduled matches. The program was helped
along by several one-sided results, among them: No. 6 Andre Agassi
defeating wild-card Justin Gimelstob, 6-0, 6-1, 6-1, in 66 minutes
and defending champion No. 2 Venus Williams putting away Alicia Molik
of Australia, 6-1, 6-2, in 54 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   There were three upsets on the men's side, at least on paper.
Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia defeated No. 4 Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia, 6-3, 6-1, 6-1, Wayne Ferreira of South Africa beat No. 8
Albert Costa of Spain, 1-6, 6-7 (11), 6-4, 7-5, 6-4, and Jan-Michael
Gambill beat No. 9 Carlos Moya of Spain, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   The upsets did not garner the interest that accompanied the
upcoming Blake-Hewitt match. Almost simultaneously, Hewitt and Blake
were interviewed afterward by TV reporters about last year's
racially-tinged episode in their match.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt had complained about an African-American line judge and
used the word "similarities." He later said he was not referring to
Blake and the line judge, only the calls by the judge, and Blake,
whose father is African-American, gave him the benefit of the doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "I did what I was taught to do, to give people the benefit of the
doubt," Blake said in the USA Network interview. "I don't have any
hard feelings toward him."</TE>
<TE>   Blake later said the air was cleared long ago. He was asked if he
was bothered by people knowing him for the one match. Additionally,
Blake cramped and threw up on the court, eventually losing in five
sets to Hewitt.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy casual tennis fans know who I am," said Blake, smiling.
"That's one thing I never expected to happen. I wish they had seen
that and known the fact I played really great tennis in that match,
that we really did have a battle out there. If that's all they know
me for, that's unfortunate. It's a little more motivation for me to
win some more matches, so I can talk about it.</TE>
<TE>   "Lleyton, I don't think he talks about it as much as I do. People
keep talking about him winning."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hewitt: "James and I are fine about it. We spoke straight
after the situation. That was pretty much the end of it."</TE>
<TE>   Lately, Hewitt has spent more time sparring with the ATP because
of a $103,000 fine imposed for failing to do a pre-match interview
with ESPN earlier this month. His Indianapolis law firm issued
another statement on Thursday, taking issue with statements made by
ATP chief executive officer Mark Miles.</TE>
<TE>   Miles' leadership has come under scrutiny. And it is notable he
has not met with the world's No. 1 player, even before the Open.</TE>
<TE>   "He had plenty of opportunities at different times to talk to me,"
Hewitt said. "Nothing really happened."</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt's agent, Tom Ross, said he spoke with Miles on the phone in
the days before the issue exploded in Cincinnati. "I felt it was more
likely than not, he would intervene," Ross said. "Did I think he was
going to solve the problem? Absolutely yes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A seemingly routine question caught Jennifer Capriati, 26, without
an answer. Capriati, surprisingly, had this to say when she was asked
in her post-match interview about Title IX: "I have no idea what
Title IX is, sorry."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Bellamy recently made a big new purchase, a house near the
hills in Pacific Palisades, and wound up with a little more than he
bargained for.</LD>
<LD>   "We have rattlesnakes, tarantulas and bees," he said, describing
the unexpected backyard accouterments. "That's an odd non-disclosure
there, you think, when you buy a house."</LD>
<LD>   Bellamy reviewed the fine print in the contract.</LD>
<TE>   "It was disclosed," he said, "as 'rodents and vermin.' "</TE>
<TE>   At least Bellamy was fairly warned before stepping out into the
treacherous world of sports television with his 24-hour Tennis
Channel. In that world, the snakes have limo drivers, the rodents do
lunch and the vermin throw rackets when they're not threatening to
sue because tour officials requested they sit down for a television
interview.</TE>
<TE>   In New York this week to promote his network at the U.S. Open,
Bellamy spoke at a gathering of these critters--or as Bellamy
politely worded it, "250 of the most powerful people in the tennis
industry." His speech was equal parts pep talk, rallying cry and
frontal assault, and urged his fragmented, self-interested audience
to get its act together and work together or get out of the business
of half-promoting a sport that needs round-the-clock supervision.</TE>
<TE>   "I ruffled some feathers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bellamy is wildly passionate about tennis. He plays the game and
coaches it. He's married to former professional player Beth Herr, who
won the 1983 NCAA women's championship while playing at USC. Get him
talking about tennis, which isn't difficult, and, motor revved, he
will tell you, straight-faced, that "the biggest superstars in sports
are ours" and "we are the women's sport, period, bar none."</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Barry
Bonds, Randy Johnson, Kurt Warner, Peyton Manning, David Beckham,
Ronaldo, Lance Armstrong, Jeff Gordon, Ian Thorpe, Marion Jones, Mia
Hamm, Sarah Hughes and Michelle Kwan--just to name a few--might beg
to differ. But Bellamy has a product to push, up a very steep
incline, and had better be in a positive frame of mind if he is to
persuade a skeptical public that a 24-hour tennis network has a
chance for survival.</TE>
<TE>   Even one of his biggest superstars, Jennifer Capriati, expressed
doubts in the venture, saying she would tune in to the Tennis Channel
only "if I was really bored."</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred, Bellamy exclaimed, "I guarantee you that she'll love
it. I think every pro will love watching the story of other pros."</TE>
<TE>   The Right Time?</TE>
<TE>   Bellamy does not have a precise start-up date, saying that the
Tennis Channel will make its debut "toward the end of the year."</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of a year in which seven of the nine men's Masters
Series tournaments will lose money and after which the women's tour
could lose its sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of a year in which one family dominates women's
tennis to the point of foregone conclusion and the careers of the two
biggest names in men's tennis, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, are in
distinct wind-down mode.</TE>
<TE>   If timing is indeed everything, the Tennis Channel looks to be in
trouble before it begins.</TE>
<TE>   Bellamy, however, stands in there doggedly, counterpunching with
the naysayers.</TE>
<TE>   "The Williams sisters are two of the greatest players of all
time," he said. "These two girls grew up in Compton--and they're
sisters. They're 1 and 2....</TE>
<TE>   "We just have so many great stories to tell. It's such a great
sport. It's the hardest sport in my opinion. It's like boxing and
chess at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   Bellamy disputes the idea that men's tennis, with Agassi in his
twilight and Sampras making headlines simply for winning a
first-round match at the U.S. Open, is headed for a down
cycle--sometimes referred to among fans and media as the Lleyton
Hewitt Dark Ages.</TE>
<TE>   "I so disagree with that notion," he said. "For one, when you
watch the tennis, granted, there are so many good players that it
makes it hard for one or two guys to emerge. Is that a negative?
Maybe from a marketing standpoint.</TE>
<TE>   "But if we're just selling tennis, the tennis that's out there is
so incredible. I mean, everybody was [complaining] five years ago
that the serves were too big and that's ruining tennis. Look at who's
at the top of the game--the returners. Lleyton Hewitt's the best
example. The guy's a counterpuncher--and he's the best returner in
the world, and he's the fastest, and he's No. 1 in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally not like how [it was]. You go to the U.S. Open or
any tournament today, and you're seeing 25-ball rallies, not two-ball
rallies. I think the tennis is just phenomenal. It's at a level we've
never experienced before."</TE>
<TE>   Bellamy mentions Andy Roddick, James Blake and Taylor Dent as
three American men with enough star potential upon which to build a
round-the-clock tennis network.</TE>
<TE>   "The women have an inventory that is just blockbuster stars,
there's 10 of them and they've got 10 years left," he said. "It's
just flawless.</TE>
<TE>   "The men, it's just a different thing. The guys are in between
inventories, but the [next] inventory ... out of 25 [prospects], you
don't think we're going to have more than two or three that break
through? Roddick and Blake, you've got to bet even money that one of
those guys are going to be a top-five player."</TE>
<TE>   Old-Time Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Bellamy received encouraging news this week when Agassi signed on
to help promote the Tennis Channel, joining Sampras, who will host an
instruction show on the network. Bellamy was also pleased to announce
his channel had secured the television rights to eight tournaments in
2003, including the women's Manhattan Beach JPMorgan Chase Open.</TE>
<TE>   The Tennis Channel also acquired the rights to the World Team
Tennis video archives and will air old matches featuring the likes of
Bjorn Borg, Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe.</TE>
<TE>   Bellamy says his network has access to so much vintage tennis
footage that "we could have 10 Tennis Channels." But he only needs
one to succeed. As challenges go, that would seem to be more than
enough.</TE>
<TE>   Contingency Plans</TE>
<TE>   Bracing for the possibility of a baseball strike, ESPN and Fox
planned to fill potential holes in their weekend broadcast schedules
in similar fashion: with lots of talk.</TE>
<TE>   Both networks were set to televise games between the San Francisco
Giants and the Arizona Diamondbacks--Fox on Saturday, ESPN on Sunday.
If the games are not played, Fox will air an hour-long pregame show
titled "America's Pastime in Crisis," then give the remaining time to
the local affiliates. ESPN was prepared to air a town-hall discussion
on baseball's labor situation, followed by a special edition of
"Sports Reporters" to discuss the strike.</TE>
<TE>   Local Fox Sports Net and Fox Sports Net 2 planned to fill
scheduling gaps with repeat broadcasts of "Best Damn Sports Show
Period." If the owners and the players needed any more incentive to
reach an agreement, and reach it quickly, there it is.</TE>

<LD>With 33 freshmen in camp--22 on scholarship--perhaps it stood to
reason. Still, it was a surprise to see six first-year players listed
second team on the depth chart released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   There were the expected (quarterback Drew Olson, tight end
Marcedes Lewis, weakside linebacker Wesley Walker) and the unexpected
(fullback J.D. Groves, cornerback Glen Ohaeri and tackle Alex
Potasi).</LD>
<LD>   "I'm really pleased with the freshman group," Coach Bob Toledo
said. "They are as good or better than I thought they'd be."</LD>
<TE>   Three other freshmen listed as third string are expected to play
on special teams as well as get snaps from scrimmage--middle
linebacker Justin London, safety Jarrad Page and receiver Junior
Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   Several redshirt freshmen are also in the plans, led by starting
weakside linebacker Spencer Havner and starting center Mike
McCloskey. Running backs Jason Harrison, Wendell Mathis and Tyler
Ebell will contribute.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll have a role on this team," offensive coordinator Kelly
Skipper said of the running backs. "They each bring different skills
to the table."</TE>
<TE>   Ebell is listed as the first-string punt returner ahead of Craig
Bragg, who averaged 8.4 yards on 14 returns last season. Ebell is a
breakaway threat but has also shown a propensity to fumble.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although Page can sign a contract with the Milwaukee Brewers any
time before school begins Sept. 23, he probably won't. The Brewers
offered a $700,000 bonus before he reported to UCLA and Page asked
for $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's history," he said. "I haven't heard from them since
I came here and I don't care at this point. I'm happy playing
football."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Four injured players who would be second string were left off the
depth chart because they likely will sit out the Sept. 7 opener
against Colorado State.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Carter, who backs up Mike Seidman at tight end, and Pat
Norton, who backs up Manuel White at fullback, have sprained ankles.</TE>
<TE>   Shane Lehmann, who backs up Steve Vieira at right guard, has a
pulled groin, and Patrick Pierre-Louis, who backs up Havner at
linebacker, has a separated shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   The health of starting middle linebacker Marcus Reese also is a
concern. The senior has a concussion and, although he wanted to
practice Thursday, doctors held him out. Reese has had several
concussions during his career.</TE>

<HD>Three Hurt in Last Drill</HD>

<LD>A two-minute drill at the end of practice Thursday resulted in a
night of anxiety for USC coaches as three key players were injured
only a few hours after another showed up at practice with a plastic
boot on his left foot.</LD>
<LD>   Freshman guard Fred Matua appeared to sustain the worst damage. He
injured his right knee on the same play senior tailback Justin Fargas
appeared to tweak the right hamstring he injured on Aug. 17. One play
later, senior quarterback Carson Palmer hurt his left ankle while
sliding to the ground.</LD>
<LD>   By that time, freshman receiver Mike Williams had already exited
for tests on his left foot. Williams experienced pain after
Wednesday's workout and attended Thursday's practice outfitted in a
boot that extended from his toes to his knee.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a heck of a day," USC Coach Pete Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Fargas and Matua were hurt as the first-team offense ran a screen
pass against the first-team defense. Fargas caught the ball and
accelerated to full speed, but grabbed the side of his right leg
after he was bumped to the ground and then retired to the trainer's
table.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Matua was assisted to the sideline clutching his right
knee.</TE>
<TE>   Matua walked off the field after practice, but he required
assistance from teammates as he traveled to the locker room. Fargas
exited under his own power and said he felt fine. So did Palmer. "I
just rolled it. It's fine," Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   All three underwent tests Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   Matua replaced injured senior Zach Wilson on the first day of camp
and was scheduled to start Monday against Auburn. If Matua cannot
play, Carroll said he could be replaced by senior Derek Graf or
sophomore Travis Watkins.</TE>
<TE>   Fargas, who went into training camp listed as the No. 1 tailback,
hoped to be ready for the Auburn game. But Carroll said that Fargas
would not play unless he was at full strength.</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt freshman Matt Leinart is Palmer's backup for the opener.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is listed as Kareem Kelly's backup at wide receiver.
Grant Mattos or Jason Mitchell would fill that role if Williams
cannot play against Auburn, Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the latest switch from offense to defense, senior Doyal Butler
moved from tight end to defensive line.... Carroll said receiver
Kareem Kelly would return punts against Auburn.</TE>

<HD>2 Afghan American Men Sue O.C. Theater Over Ejection</HD>
<DH>Courts: Pair say Orange movie house tossed them for looking
suspicious, speaking own language.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Afghan American college students filed a federal civil rights
lawsuit Thursday alleging they were wrongfully ejected from an AMC
theater in Orange because they looked suspicious and were speaking a
foreign language.</LD>
<LD>   Mohammad Sayed and Omar Zazia, 21-year-old students at Cal State
Fullerton, said they were humiliated and angered after they and two
Afghan American friends were escorted from the theater May 4 amid
laughter and stares from a packed house at the Block at Orange. "It
was the most degrading night of my life," Sayed said.</LD>
<LD>   The men and their friends had settled in for the 11:35 p.m.
showing of "Deuces Wild" and were talking in their native Pashto when
they noticed a security guard staring at them, according to the
lawsuit they filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The guard left and returned with an usher, who asked to see their
tickets. When one of the men asked why others weren't being checked,
they were told to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Sayed and Zazia said they tried to talk to two managers, who, they
said, wouldn't explain their ejection. The security guard, an
employee of Culver City-based Totally Secured Inc., said "something
to the effect of 'You look suspicious and you were speaking in a
foreign tongue,' " according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Several Orange police officers escorted them from the theater,
Sayed and Zazia said. When they tried to explain what happened, one
officer said "something to the effect of 'Now you are annoying me.
Get out of my Block,' " the suit alleges.</TE>
<TE>   The officer then threatened to arrest the pair if they returned
that night, the men said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking into our involvement in this incident," said Sgt.
Dave Hill, a spokesman for the Orange Police Department, which is not
a defendant in the suit. "We will take what action is appropriate, if
any."</TE>
<TE>   A representative of AMC Entertainment Inc., the Kansas City,
Mo.-based owner of the theater chain, said he had not seen the suit
and couldn't comment on the alleged incident.</TE>
<TE>   "However, AMC is in the business of providing the best possible
moviegoing experience for all of our valued customers and is proud
that our guests represent a broad spectrum of people of all races,
ages and sexes," said a written statement from Richard J. King,
senior vice president for corporate communications.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Totally Secured could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "We bring this lawsuit because, as a nation, we long ago settled
the issue of discrimination in public accommodations," said Ben
Wizner, an attorney for the ACLU of Southern California, which is
representing Sayed and Zazia along with a private Orange County law
firm. "These victories were hard-won. We can't let the principle of
equality under the law be lightly discarded in times of trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Sayed contacted the ACLU through a hotline the organization set up
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks led to a nationwide backlash
against people who appeared to be Arab.</TE>
<TE>   Wizner said the hotline has received hundreds of complaints, but
that Thursday's suit was only the second the organization has filed
since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the Los Angeles ACLU joined other branches in suing four
airlines in federal court, alleging they barred five passengers from
flights because of racial discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs, two of whom are of Arab descent, were ordered off
planes or prevented from boarding after clearing security at airports
in the months after Sept. 11. The cases are pending.</TE>
<TE>   "No one should be judged by the color of their skin or the way
they talk," said Zazia, the son of an Afghan army general whose
family fled their native country in 1990. "My version of the American
dream was shattered that night."</TE>
<TE>   The suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages and to force AMC
to "take all necessary steps" to prevent discriminatory practices.</TE>

<HD>Prosecutors Argue to Keep Blake in Jail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors told the state Supreme Court on Thursday that they have
presented sufficient evidence to hold actor Robert Blake in jail
without bail.</LD>
<LD>   Blake, 68, is charged with fatally shooting his 44-year-old wife,
Bonny Lee Bakley, on May 4, 2001, near a Studio City restaurant. He
is also charged with twice soliciting others to kill her and with
conspiracy. Additionally, prosecutors allege that Blake intentionally
killed Bakley while lying in wait, a capital offense.</LD>
<LD>   Despite those charges, the Los Angeles County district attorney's
office announced seven days after Blake's April 18 arrest that it
would not seek the death penalty. If convicted, Blake faces life in
prison without parole.</LD>
<TE>   His attorney, Harland W. Braun, has argued that prosecutors
charged his client with the special circumstance of lying in wait
solely to deny him bail. Without that allegation, Blake, who is being
held at Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles, would be eligible
for release on $1-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   Braun is now asking the state Supreme Court to order a bail
hearing for his client and to dismiss the lying in wait allegation as
unconstitutionally vague.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash has said he
will consider both requests after he hears evidence at the Nov. 13
preliminary hearing. The 2nd District Court of Appeal last month
denied the same requests.</TE>
<TE>   But, in a surprising move, the state Supreme Court this month
asked prosecutors to respond to Blake's petition for review. The
court said it would rule by Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Attys. George M. Palmer and Brent Riggs asked the
Supreme Court on Thursday to deny Blake's petition.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutors said they have shown all the elements needed to
prove the special circumstance of lying in wait: that Blake concealed
his purpose for taking Bakley to dinner at a Studio City restaurant
and that he then waited for an opportune time to stage a surprise
attack on her.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have noted that Blake made a dinner reservation at
Vitello's the night Bakley was killed, although he had never done so
before. They said he parked two blocks away behind a garbage bin and
out of sight, and left Bakley alone in his car while he allegedly
returned to the restaurant to retrieve a handgun. In those few
minutes, Bakley was shot in the head and shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Blake has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</TE>
<TE>   In his defense, Braun has argued that Bakley enraged many men, any
one of whom might have killed her. He also said that prosecutors lack
any physical or forensic evidence linking Blake to the crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   Braun has argued that Blake should be permitted to post bail
because he does not pose a flight risk nor is he a danger to the
community.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors in court papers rejected the defense's argument that
recent changes in state law make the lying in wait allegation
unconstitutionally vague.</TE>
<TE>   They also said the state Constitution denies bail to all
defendants who are charged with capital crimes, even when the death
penalty is not sought.</TE>

<HD>Davis Threatens to Call Special Session</HD>
<DH>Finances: He pressures lawmakers to approve a budget before
they adjourn Saturday. Democrats seek new way to raise car tax.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI and DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>With state lawmakers set to adjourn for the year this weekend, Gov.
Gray Davis warned Thursday that he would call a special session of
the Legislature if they failed to approve a budget by Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Democrats, hoping to avoid an extended session, floated a
proposal that would permit the Davis administration to raise the car
tax on its own, without a vote of the full Legislature.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation would authorize the finance director to raise the
car tax by making "a finding that insufficient moneys are available"
to keep the tax at the reduced rate in place since 1999.</LD>
<TE>   If the car tax were rolled back to 1998 levels, the state would
gain--and motorists would pay--more than $7 billion over a two-year
period.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) said it would be
unconstitutional to raise taxes without a two-thirds vote of the
Legislature. He warned that such an action would lead to litigation,
unlike winning Republican support on a larger spending package.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd file for an injunction before the ink from the governor's
pen was dry," Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   Finance Director Tim Gage declined to comment on the proposal. The
Davis administration has not taken a position.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations on a new state spending plan continued Thursday, with
Democrats appearing to be closer to securing at least three of the
four Republican votes needed to approve the budget in the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate approved a spending package on June 29.</TE>
<TE>   Lower-house Democrats and Republicans have been divided for more
than two months over a $4.2-billion tax plan, part of the Democratic
leadership's plan to close a $23.6-billion shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans want additional spending cuts to diminish the need for
new taxes, but indicated for the first time this week that they were
willing to consider several proposals that would raise revenues
without increasing taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Davis indicated that Democrats were working to secure the crucial
fourth Republican vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe there's a good chance it will happen by Saturday
night," Davis said. "But if it doesn't, I will call them back into
special session for Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing we do in Sacramento is pass the budget,"
he said. "We'll stay at it until we get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Finding sufficient Republican support could prove elusive,
however, unless Democrats are willing to drop their plans to increase
any taxes, including a hike in the state excise tax on cigarettes to
$3 per pack.</TE>
<TE>   In another possible threat to state coffers, a federal welfare
reform plan in the House could cost California $2.2 billion over the
next five years, according to a new report by the state's nonpartisan
legislative analyst's office.</TE>

<HD>Plan to Store Water Below Desert Gains</HD>
<DH>Hydrology: The MWD must now approve the $1-billion
proposal, which would create one of the state's largest storage
facilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY and MICHAEL HILTZIK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Department of Interior on Thursday gave its approval to a
controversial $1-billion, 50-year project to store and pump water
from beneath the Mojave Desert and create one of California's largest
water storage facilities.</LD>
<LD>   "We're thrilled," said Wendy Mitchell, spokeswoman for Santa
Monica-based Cadiz Inc., which owns the land above the aquifer in
eastern San Bernardino County.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposal, which still faces political and economic
questions, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California
would store surplus water from the Colorado River in the aquifer and
during dry years pump aquifer water into the MWD system, which
supplies water to 17 million people in six counties.</LD>
<TE>   If the MWD approves the project, the agency and thus the public
would bear a substantial part of the estimated $150-million cost.</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz would be paid by the MWD for each acre-foot of water pumped
from the aquifer, which some critics see as an ominous reversion to
the days when water systems were privately owned by for-profit
companies. Two other desert storage projects being devised by the MWD
include only public agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the MWD has spent several years and $3 million
devising the proposal, agency officials were cautious Thursday when
asked whether it will be adopted by the board of directors. A meeting
is set for Sept. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Kightlinger, MWD's general counsel, said that the state's
"access to [surplus] Colorado River water is in some jeopardy at this
moment" because of drought and the inability of California water
agencies to strike a deal to meet a Dec. 31 deadline to avoid a
mandatory water cutback from the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   The Cadiz deal, Kightlinger said, will have to be evaluated in
light of that uncertainty. Adan Ortega, MWD vice president for
external affairs, said he did not want to prejudge what the staff
will recommend to the board.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, it will be a business decision," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed project has been criticized by environmentalists and
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) as a danger to the aquifer and the
fragile desert ecology it supports. An arcane disagreement exists
among scientists about how quickly the aquifer will be recharged by
mountain rainfall.</TE>
<TE>   But scientists at the Department of Interior concluded that a
warning system devised by the partners and government agencies would
give sufficient notice if the aquifer were being drawn down too
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that the management plan, which is based on science
and a strong monitoring program, will assure the necessary protection
of the natural resources for which we are responsible," said Rebecca
Watson, assistant secretary of interior for land and minerals
management.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein has sponsored a rider to an appropriation bill aimed at
killing the project. But the prospects of that bill are uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Interior decision was immediately denounced by
some environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   Elden Hughes, chairman of the Sierra Club's California Desert
Committee, said the project will leave "a scar on the land that will
take centuries to heal."</TE>
<TE>   "We have an environmental disaster and economic fiasco," Hughes
said. He and others worry that bighorn sheep will be left without
water, monumental dust storms will be created when the water table
drops beneath dry lands, and ravens drawn by the spreading ponds will
eat slow-moving tortoises.</TE>
<TE>   Before the department decided to endorse the project, the concerns
cited by Hughes and others were studied by the department and its
subagencies and were rejected as exaggerated or unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concluded in April
that the project "is not likely to jeopardize the continued
existence" of the desert tortoise, a federally protected species.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists had asked that, at the very least, the federal
government put limits on the amount of water that could be pumped
annually. The Department of Interior, however, placed no such limits.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the controversy about the Cadiz project involves Cadiz
Chief Executive Keith Brackpool, a confidante and contributor to Gov.
Gray Davis. As the Department of Interior staff was evaluating the
project, Cadiz hired lawyers from a firm that once employed Interior
Secretary Gale Norton to lobby on behalf of the project.</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, Brackpool said the proposal has "an
environmental protection plan unrivaled within California's water
industry."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of Cadiz Inc. and the project have questioned its ability
to shoulder the financial obligations of its partnership in the
project.</TE>
<TE>   Although Cadiz records most of its revenue from money-losing
agricultural operations throughout the Central Valley, the company
has made it clear that its future depends on the approval of the
water project and others like it.</TE>
<TE>   Under the tentative terms reached with the MWD, the construction
cost of the project would be shared equally, but two-thirds of
Cadiz's $75-million share would actually come from an up-front
payment to be made by the MWD. Cadiz Inc., which has never turned a
profit, carries more than $140 million in annual debt, according to
its latest financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the company's net worth or shareholders equity--the
value of its assets after debt and other liabilities are
subtracted--has declined to less than $9 million in June from nearly
$50 million in 1998. At the most recent rate of shrinkage that figure
would turn negative as soon as early next year.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Interior decision would allow the project
partners to build a 34.6-mile pipeline and power distribution
facilities from MWD's Colorado Aqueduct to the aquifer.</TE>

<HD>Charles Lichenstein, 75; U.S. Envoy at United Nations Under
Reagan</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Lichenstein, the No. 2 U.S. representative to the United
Nations during President Reagan's first term, has died. He was 75.</LD>
<LD>   Lichenstein died Wednesday at a Washington, D.C., hospital during
surgery to correct a problem in an artery to his heart.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1984, Lichenstein had been a distinguished fellow in
international relations at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think tank in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   His service under U.N. Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick from 1981
until 1984 was highlighted by his 1983 rebuttal to a Soviet delegate
who suggested the United Nations might be better off based outside
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "We will put no impediment in your way, and we will be at the
dockside bidding you a farewell as you set off into the sunset,"
Lichenstein responded.</TE>
<TE>   The exchange between Lichenstein and the Soviet representative,
Igor I. Yakovlev, took place during the tense diplomatic atmosphere
in the wake of the Soviet downing of a South Korean jetliner killing
all 269 aboard, including an American congressman.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts by then-Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko to land
at civilian airports in New York and New Jersey were refused by the
governors of those states, which led to the comment by Yakovlev.</TE>
<TE>   While members of the House Arms Control and Disarmament Caucus
urged that Lichenstein resign over the remark, public support was
overwhelmingly favorable. Reagan also backed Lichenstein in the
furor.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Albany, N.Y., he earned undergraduate and graduate degrees
at Yale University, where he later taught political science. He also
taught at the University of Notre Dame and Albertus Magnus College in
New Haven, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   He worked in the presidential campaigns of Richard Nixon and Barry
Goldwater in the 1960s. In 1962, he was head of research at the
Republican National Committee. He later served as a special assistant
to President Nixon.</TE>
<TE>   He was a senior vice president of the Public Broadcasting Service
in the 1970s.</TE>

<HD>Audit Alleges Waste and Mismanagement by DWP</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Controller Laura Chick released an audit Thursday that
found instances of mismanagement and waste in the Department of Water
and Power's Green Power and Public Benefits programs, especially in
developing use of renewable power sources.</LD>
<LD>   Chick called for City Council hearings on her conclusions, and
cited these examples:</LD>
<LD>   * Last August, the department dedicated its Lopez Canyon landfill
micro-turbine project to use landfill gas to generate electric power.
As yet, no electricity has actually been produced.</LD>
<TE>   * The DWP spent about four years and more than $1 million to
design an electric leaf blower, but it has not yet been produced.</TE>
<TE>   * Only seven of 27 electric buses purchased by the department in
1999 and 2000 at a cost of $5.8 million are available for service,
wasting $4.1 million of what was spent.</TE>
<TE>   * The department spent $370,000 in 2001 to purchase
energy-efficient refrigerators to distribute to low-income customers,
but only 80% of them have been handed out.</TE>
<TE>   David Wiggs, general manager of the department, appeared alongside
Chick at the Silver Lake news conference.</TE>
<TE>   He said the DWP has not been able to find a manufacturer that will
produce the leaf blower, although it is still looking for one.</TE>
<TE>   He said 200 refrigerators have been distributed and the others
will be in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Chick contends that the department has often plunged into the
programs without a rational plan or long-term strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Wiggs has said that experimentation, by its nature, does not
guarantee perfect success.</TE>

<HD>Candidate Confirms He Seeks LAPD Post</HD>
<DH>Police: Chief from Cambridge, Mass., is the only African
American among 13 semifinalists.</DH>

<LD>Ronnie Watson, the chief of police in Cambridge, Mass., confirmed
Thursday that he is among 13 semifinalists vying to lead the Los
Angeles Police Department. He is the only AfricanAmerican on the
list.</LD>
<LD>   Watson--who spent 33 years with the Chicago Police Department--is
set to arrive in Los Angeles next week for an interview with members
of the Police Commission, who are searching for a candidate to
replace former Chief Bernard C. Parks.</LD>
<LD>   Watson is on a list of finalists that includes a number of ranking
LAPD officials, a former New York City police commissioner and police
chiefs from Sacramento, Santa Ana, Oxnard and Portland.</LD>
<TE>   Although city officials say they actively sought out African
American applicants, Watson was one of only two who applied for the
job and met the city's application criteria.</TE>
<TE>   Melanie Lomax, a member of the Los Angeles Police Commission from
1989 through 1991, said she believes that many qualified African
American law enforcement officials opted out because of the cloud of
controversy that surrounded Parks and Willie L. Williams, who both
were denied second terms after police commissioners complained about
their performances.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the fact that you had two African American chiefs driven
out of office is a huge deterrent to anyone who is on this level in
the African American community," Lomax said.</TE>
<TE>   Edwin P. Compass III, chief of the New Orleans Police Department,
was one of the African American law enforcement officials heavily
courted for the LAPD position. With only a few months on the job as
head of the New Orleans police force, he said, it was too soon for
him to think about moving.</TE>
<TE>   "I was told that it could be me" as LAPD chief, Compass said. "But
I didn't want it to be me. I love New Orleans. It wouldn't be fair to
the people of Los Angeles for me to go up and interview and not be in
the position to accept."</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview Thursday, Watson said he was honored to
be considered for the LAPD job. He declined to discuss his candidacy
in racial terms.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not who you are or what you are, it's whether you are a good
fit for your city, for Los Angeles," said Watson, who has headed the
270-member Cambridge department since 1996. "I'm one of 13, and I'm
honored."</TE>
<TE>   The 13 candidates include six current LAPD members and two former
senior members. There are two women on the list and four Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Watson, nine other finalists have confirmed that
they are preparing for interviews, which start next Wednesday as the
Police Commission moves to narrow the list of finalists to three
candidates. From the LAPD are Assistant Chief David Gascon, Deputy
Chief Margaret A. York, Deputy Chief David Kalish, Cmdr. Sharon Papa,
Cmdr. James McDonnell and Cmdr. George Gascon. Outside candidates
include Portland, Ore., Police Chief Mark Kroeker, former New York
City Police Commissioner William Bratton and Oxnard Police Chief Art
Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   According to sources, three other candidates due to be interviewed
are former Philadelphia Police Chief John Timoney, Sacramento Police
Chief Arturo Venegas and Santa Ana Police Chief Paul Walters. All
three have declined to confirm whether they are in the running.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission officials said earlier this week that they had
narrowed the list of candidates to 13--who they would not name--from
a field of 21. Initially, 51 people had applied for the job.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission wants to submit its three-name list to Mayor
James K. Hahn by the end of September.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, under the City Charter, is charged with selecting the chief
from among those finalists--subject to City Council approval.</TE>
<TE>   The city began the search for a new chief in April, after Parks
was denied a second five-year term. Retired LAPD Deputy Chief Martin
Pomeroy is currently serving as acting chief.</TE>

<HD>North Hollywood Man Found Dead in Closet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The body of a man was found bound and stuffed into a bathroom closet
in a North Hollywood apartment Thursday, and police said the victim
probably knew his killer.</LD>
<LD>   A manager at the Royale Sherman Apartments in the 12300 block of
Sherman Way entered the second-floor unit about 10:30 a.m., detected
a foul odor and called authorities, Los Angeles Police Department
Det. Mike Coffey said.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives would not immediately identify the dead man, believed
to be a longtime tenant of the 236-unit complex, but said there was
no sign of a break-in.</LD>
<TE>   "This was not a suicide," Coffey said. "We think [the killer] is
somebody he knew and allowed into the apartment."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors told detectives that the man was last seen Sunday
morning. The next day, a workman sent to fix a bathroom shower in the
victim's apartment tried to gain entry, but left after someone on the
inside kept locking the door as he repeatedly tried to unlock it,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, some residents of the building said they began
smelling a foul odor near the apartment, but did not report it
because they believed it was a plumbing problem.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were not sure how the man died, because the body was
so decomposed. A cause of death will be determined by the county
coroner's office.</TE>
<TE>   The victim, whose estranged wife lives in the same complex, had no
children. He was on government assistance and took the bus to
Hollywood every day to care for an elderly man, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents described him as a polite and happy person, someone who
didn't seem to have any troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very sweet-mannered," neighbor Helen Orzel said.</TE>

<HD>El Monte Police to Turn Officers Into Neighborhood Chiefs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the El Monte Police Department, there's no such thing as too many
chiefs.</LD>
<LD>   Starting Saturday, police officers will step out of their cars and
into neighborhoods. They will shake hands, strike up conversations
and pass out personal cellular phone numbers.</LD>
<LD>   In an experimental program, the Police Department has divided the
city into 64 neighborhoods, each consisting of about five blocks, and
assigned one officer to be chief of each neighborhood.</LD>
<TE>   Their challenge will be to reduce crime by convincing people that
to do this, all must help make their blocks friendlier and more
aesthetically pleasing.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get rid of all the broken windows in the
neighborhood," said Police Sgt. Steve Krigbaum, who pitched the
program.</TE>
<TE>   With 116,000 residents, El Monte has large tracts of apartment
houses and swaths of single-family homes on spacious lots in a rural
atmosphere with roosters, horses and weathered barns.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, its urban areas make it one of the country's densest
cities. Garbage and grocery carts litter sidewalks, and gangs prey on
several neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Arturo Gutierrez, 25, grew up with some of the homeboys in
the working-class Medina Court neighborhood, where he still lives
with his parents and three siblings. As of Saturday, it's also his
new beat.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope I can make a difference, Gutierrez said. "I totally expect
to hear from my mom if I'm not doing a good job."</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Ken Weldon said he expects some officers to grumble
about the added responsibilities, such as asking people to cut their
grass now and then. It's not exactly what most officers signed up
thinking they would do.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of personal accountability," Weldon said. "We
expect our officers to hold town meetings to come up with solutions,
to meet people on social issues and beautification issues and to
really get involved in their personal lives. We expect officers to go
door to door, introduce themselves and basically say, 'I'm Ken
Weldon, and I'm going to be your officer for, perhaps, the rest of my
career.' "</TE>
<TE>   When Krigbaum told Weldon about his idea, the chief replied: "It
won't work."</TE>
<TE>   Why not, Krigbaum asked. "Because it just makes too much sense,"
Weldon recalls saying.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of the Improving and Maintaining Public Awareness and
Community Teamwork program is to turn police and residents into
friends, capable of sharing information about crime and other issues
as easily as they might chat about the summer heat.</TE>
<TE>   Police want residents to understand that neighborhoods marred by
vandalism, discarded trash, unkempt lawns and littered corners are
magnets for crime.</TE>
<TE>   They will cull volunteers from neighborhoods, churches, community
groups and schools for various beautification efforts, Krigbaum said.
From this, police hope, will come a lower tolerance for crime.</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully, Krigbaum said, residents will also tell their police
officers about people in the neighborhood who need help. "One-third
of the people in this city live below the poverty line, but you
wouldn't believe how many people want to help others," he said. "If
you need things donated--a wheelchair, a refrigerator--you just ask
and people will donate it."</TE>
<TE>   City officials said they expect an upsurge in requests for
services, from graffiti removal to referrals to youth programs. Over
time, they hope, the number of calls about crime will decrease.</TE>
<TE>   "If the officers deal with their residents' issues first, the way
they're supposed to, other resources won't be taxed or overwhelmed,"
said Sgt. Santos Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   Weldon has high hopes.</TE>
<TE>   "The officers will hopefully get really involved with the
residents and establish friendships. They'll go to parties and will
be asked to be godfathers," Weldon said. "I'd like for our officers
to naturally gravitate to 'their' neighborhoods on their off days....
I think we'll have better officers, better people and better
communities. I don't see why this can't work."</TE>

<HD>LAPD Readies for Worst on Sept. 11</HD>
<DH>Police: Equipment bought to improve response to crime and
disasters is showcased.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE STASSEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Touting an array of new equipment--from a high-tech hazardous
materials analysis kit to a $500,000 mobile command post--acting LAPD
Chief Martin Pomeroy said Thursday that the department is "better off
than it was a year ago."</LD>
<LD>   "I believe we're prepared for whatever may come our way," he said.</LD>
<LD>   On the first anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the
Los Angeles Police Department will have 2,300 officers on patrol,
about one-third more than before, the chief said. The department has
identified 450 locations citywide it has deemed "high
risk"--including religious institutions, government buildings and
utility plants--that will be under special watch that day.</LD>
<TE>   Whether a terrorist attack or a natural disaster, police officials
said they will be able to respond more effectively because of the new
equipment and vehicles displayed Thursday at the Edward M. Davis
Firearms/Tactics Training Facility in Granada Hills.</TE>
<TE>   A new Rapid Threat Analysis Kit--developed in conjunction with
McBain Instruments of Chatsworth and Safe Environment Engineering of
Valencia--will reduce the time the hazardous materials unit needs to
analyze a suspicious substance, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always trying to determine what something is not," Officer
Christopher Watson said. "This will allow us to do that quicker,
safer and more accurately."</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD will now respond to major crime scenes with a 39-foot
mobile command post, which has four computers, a restroom, a
kitchenette and an area that expands to accommodate three work
stations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's completely self-contained, like a top-of-the-line motor
home," Sgt. Greg Doyle said.</TE>
<TE>   Also on display was a $150,000 bulletproof Ford Excursion that
will replace a Vietnam War-era vehicle that the SWAT team uses to
rescue officers and community members.</TE>
<TE>   Another device, the "Hot Dog" K-9 temperature system, determines
if an unmanned patrol car is getting too hot for a police dog
awaiting its handler. The car windows automatically go down when the
temperature is too high, and the police officer is alerted by pager
to check on the vehicle.</TE>

<LD>The FBI arrested a Santa Ana man Thursday after receiving information
that he was storing explosives in his home.</LD>
<LD>   An extensive search of his mobile home found no explosives,
although authorities said they were still investigating.</LD>
<LD>   "The FBI became aware of information yesterday [Wednesday] that
required an immediate response.... There were allegations of
explosives," said FBI spokesman Matt McLaughlin, who would not
elaborate further. "The house contained no explosives of any kind.
The house is completely clean."</LD>
<TE>   Authorities refused to release the name of the suspect, saying all
information on the case was sealed under federal court order.</TE>
<TE>   "It is possible this man will be unarrested and not charged,"
McLaughlin said. "We want to protect his privacy.... We are planning
to sort this out through the night."</TE>
<TE>   The search occurred at Stoneridge Mobile Home Park on Harbor
Boulevard in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Residents were evacuated from their mobile homes Thursday evening,
watching in amazement as SWAT officers marched toward the man's home.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Sheriff George Jaramillo said the arrest capped an
investigation by the Joint Terrorist Task Force in Orange County, the
FBI in Los Angeles and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   "The system is working the way it's supposed to work. Information
is being sifted through and leads are being aggressively followed,
and agencies are cooperating," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are just two weeks or so away from Sept. 11. People should not
let down their guard too much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "While there are reasons to feel safe, there are also reasons to
remain vigilant. Little things like this are a wake-up call for that
notion."</TE>

Boulevard in Santa Ana. Residents were evacuated from their mobile
homes Thursday evening, watching in amazement as SWAT officers
marched toward the man's home.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Sheriff George Jaramillo said the arrest capped an
investigation by the Joint Terrorist Task Force in Orange County, the
FBI in Los Angeles and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   "The system is working the way it's supposed to work. Information
is being sifted through and leads are being aggressively followed,
and agencies are cooperating," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are just two weeks or so away from Sept. 11. People should not
let down their guard too much," he added.</TE>
<TE>   "While there are reasons to feel safe, there are also reasons to
remain vigilant. Little things like this are a wake-up call for that
notion."</TE>

<HD>Teens Seek Laughter in Life's Pain</HD>
<DH>Humor: At-risk youths find a safe haven at comedy camp,
turning hardscrabble lives into stand-up routines.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beau Smith looks exhausted. Two days ago, he ran away from his group
home in Van Nuys. He spent last night under a highway overpass and
then made his way on foot, about 15 miles, to the one place he feels
safe, the Laugh Factory in Hollywood, where he's expected this
morning. He limps up to the comedy club's door, and owner Jamie
Masada, who has been frantic about the missing boy, opens his arms.
Beau collapses in sobs.</LD>
<LD>   Beau--17, hardheaded, softhearted, angry and alone--has spent the
last seven years moving among group homes, foster homes and emergency
shelters. He can't take the system anymore, he tells Masada.</LD>
<LD>   "Things will get better, you'll see," Masada tells the wilted boy
over and over. "You just have to be strong." He takes him upstairs in
the club with a plate of Chinese food. Don't you know how many people
would die for your talent? Masada asks. You've got everything. You're
strong, smart--people would die for a face like yours, chiseled to
perfection.</LD>
<TE>   This point hits home. Even in his darkest hour, Beau is struck by
his own beauty. He looks up. You'll be somebody someday, Masada
continues. Now eat some food. Then come downstairs. It's time to go
on stage.</TE>
<TE>   Every Saturday morning in the summer, a group of teenagers--many
grappling with the consequences of poverty, abuse or neglect,
sometimes living apart from their parents--take the stage and try to
squeeze laughs from one another. It's Masada's Comedy Camp, in which
he and the children pay homage to the deepest roots of stand-up
comedy: pain, abandonment, cruelty. For 17 summers, Masada has been
telling new crews of youngsters to use their hurt to make themselves
and other people laugh. So they stand on stage and craft routines
forged by pesky little brothers and nagging teachers--and beatings
and hunger and motherlessness.</TE>
<TE>   Beau blossoms under the spotlight as he strides across the stage
and takes the microphone. His shoulders pull back, and a sarcastic
smile slides across his face. He tells the other kids that he'd run
away from his group home because he'd been in a fight that the staff
was slow to break up.</TE>
<TE>   "So we're fighting, and it went on and on and on because there was
no one there to stop us. I mean, only about eight, nine, ten staff
were there watching." He's exaggerating to make it a better story. By
the time he is done, the staff will have popped popcorn, chosen
favorites and placed bets on whether Beau or the other kid will win.
Beau's cohorts crack up. Masada is impressed. It is advanced comedy
technique: Beau has used the fight to illustrate the lack of love in
his life that is consuming him. He conveyed the real reason he ran
away and made them laugh at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   If he could, Beau continues, he'd like to go to Tennessee to visit
his mother, who he said simply could not earn enough to support seven
children. When did you talk to her last? Masada prompts, trying to
teach Beau how to extend his routine's momentum. "Two years ago,"
Beau answers. There's a moment of silence in which the old, crushed
Beau surfaces, just as quickly replaced by his spotlight persona
who's able to tell the audience that Mom hung up on him the other
day. "Me and her will get a cool relationship when she sees her
handsome son successful on TV," he says optimistically, and saunters
off the stage with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   Others stand in the spotlight, begin their spiel and lose their
way in the darkness of their lives, crumpling offstage in Masada's
arms. All great comedians are in pain, Masada tells them. The best
can manipulate the swirling sadness inside to keep themselves sane.</TE>
<TE>   Famed Counselors</TE>
<TE>   The camp's counselors are some of the nation's best-known
comedians--Chris Rock, Bob Saget, Paul Rodriguez, Jay Mohr, Chris
Tucker, Adam Sandler and the Wayans brothers among them. Richard
Pryor used to do the camp and is still the gold standard for knitting
pain and humor. In his day, he would hypnotize the kids, telling them
that if he survived growing up in a brothel run by his grandmother,
drug addiction, setting himself on fire and having a heart attack,
they could, too.</TE>
<TE>   The trick is to talk about the unmentionable with such a sense of
enjoyment that the audience is shocked into laughing along. Eddie
Griffith makes it look easy, telling them how he had misbehaved so
badly that his mother once chased him down the street in her car:
"When I ran up on the sidewalk? She ran the car up on the sidewalk
too!"</TE>
<TE>   The camp often takes on the personality of the day's
comedian/mentor. Jay Mohr begins by saying he loves them. It is
several weeks into the camp, and perhaps they are growing more
comfortable, but with him they are the most open and easy that they
have been. Mark Wray, whose humor has focused on teen idiosyncrasies,
expands his routine to how adoption has given him a confusing
assortment of relatives. Another time, after one or two kids yearn
openly for a normal life, Lester Barrie, former host of Black
Entertainment Television's "Comedy View," reminds them that life back
home could be worse. He recounted searching his mother's bedroom,
"hunting for a receipt. I thought that if I could find it, then she
could take me back to wherever she got me.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why," Barrie says from the stage. "But God wants you
to be where you are right now."</TE>
<TE>   Talk-show host and comedian Byron Allen gives Beau a homily on
self-reliance and setting goals. Does he want to be an actor or does
he want to go live in Tennessee? He can't do both. Does he smoke?
Does he drink? "Yes" and "no" are the answers. Cut it out, Allen
says. Beau tells him he'll turn 18 in three months, and Allen
shivers. "Pick your friends very, very carefully. You're a young
black man. You will not be treated like a juvenile."</TE>
<TE>   Allen's manner is firm, but as they talk he casually moves to the
back of the darkened room so Beau won't see the tears in his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my mother's name is LaTanya," is how 15-year-old Jamesha
Joann Trammel begins her routine, in which self-confidence battles
heartbreak and, for the time being, loses.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing on Disaster</TE>
<TE>   She tells a story of her childhood attempt to make a dinner of
bacon for her little sister and cousin who were hungry after being
left alone all day. "How could I know that bacon didn't take hours to
cook?" Treating it like a pot roast, she set it to cook and they went
outside to play.</TE>
<TE>   The police, firefighters and her mother all pulled up in front of
their apartment together as smoke began to billow, she said. "But my
mother couldn't say anything. She had to take the blame because she
didn't want them to know she'd been gone and left us alone."</TE>
<TE>   She smiles, then weaves that story into one of stark abandonment.
"This here ain't no joke," she says, and she tells them everything:
Who hurt her and how; the way her mother left for days and her father
left forever. "Our social worker called him, and we said we wanted to
start a new relationship with him, and he said no, he didn't want to
see us." She sprinkles the story of her life with inspirational
messages for the other kids. "It hurt, but you have to move on."</TE>
<TE>   Offstage, she takes refuge upstairs in the club, huddles in a
chair and cries into a paper napkin. Jamesha, who lives in a group
home in Sylmar, aches for her sister. "My little sister, we're like
twins, is in Pasadena--this is the first time we've ever been
separated," she had said onstage. "Last night, she called me crying,
and it made me sad because I'm a big sister and I wanted to go see
her and I can't." She hates the powerlessness. "It's like moving
through the world invisible."</TE>
<TE>   Not all kids at the camp are in the system, nor do all of them
focus their routines on the pain in their lives. Antonio Johnson, 15,
who lives with his mother and stepfather, wants to be a comedian;
this is his chance to prove himself to Masada. He gets a laugh just
by describing himself as an African
American-Irish-German-Italian-Romanian Jew--with freckles. From the
stage, he comforts Beau and Jamesha, then he cracks everyone up with
his observations about "ghetto" behavior. What's with these girls who
have mountainous curls, braids and weaves rising into the sky? he
demands. You've seen those hairdos, he says--you know just what I
mean. He snatches a stool, puts it upside down atop his head and
suddenly the legs resemble a spiky Patti La Belle hairdo. The room
explodes with laughter.</TE>
<TE>   The teens did a double take when Geoff, 11, auditioned for the
camp in early June. He's small, white and lives in Woodland Hills
with his grandmother. But he worked hard on his material and drew
some of the biggest laughs of the summer.</TE>
<TE>   "You know how most boys go to their first baseball games with
their dads?" he asks. Well, he went with his grandmother. The boys
groan. "Is that the game with the basket?" Grandma wants to know, and
he knows it's going to be a long afternoon. Clutching the stool on
stage to use as a walker, he describes their trip to the handicapped
seating section, where geriatric fans use the seventh-inning stretch
to whip out inhalers and oxygen. "We're sitting so close to the
players that you can see the chewing tobacco leave their mouths," he
says. Yet the mitt he has brought to catch foul balls goes unused.
"Instead, I keep yelling, 'Duck, Grandma! Duck!' "</TE>
<TE>   Boosting Confidence</TE>
<TE>   Masada, 41, says he started the camp after he noticed how a kid
whose face was deformed grew more confident after he hired him at the
club. Officials who run foster homes and institutions for children
said they saw the same kind of transformation in some of the children
they allowed to come to the Laugh Factory.</TE>
<TE>   Masada, a chronic worrier, is unstintingly generous with the kids
but personally frugal. He promises jobs, food, clothes, anything they
need. Filled with guilt because over the years he has amassed eight
pairs of shoes ("Who needs eight pairs of shoes?"), he thinks rich
people should have to--should want to--give at least 20% of their
income to the poor. A six-figure car weaves through traffic on Sunset
while he's talking, and the sight ignites his ulcer. Why are all
these horrible things happening to children? he asks again and again.
Why are some children beaten and raped and starved so that they end
up on his stage in tears year after year?</TE>
<TE>   "These kids," he says, "are little mice trying to survive in the
jungle."</TE>
<TE>   He says he knows what it is like. He arrived alone from Iran at
age 14, speaking only Farsi, and almost instantly homeless. An
apartment manager in Hollywood gave him a couch to sleep on in a
garage, and for weeks he cried himself to sleep at night. He began
hanging out on the Sunset Strip and soon was befriended by the comics
at the Comedy Store. When a comedian friend, unable to make a living,
killed himself in despair, Masada vowed he would help all comedians
make a living. He scraped up $10,000 and at age 17 leased the
hole-in-the-wall on the Strip that would become the Laugh Factory.</TE>
<TE>   Beau is paying the price for having run away from that Van Nuys
group home. He is now at the county's McClaren Children's Shelter in
El Monte.</TE>
<TE>   "Since it's my own fault, I guess I have to put up with it," he
sighs. The day is regimented, the doors are locked and the food is
awful. "It's like prison," he says. (He, like all children in the
system, attend the comedy camp with a court's permission.) He has
been in McClaren twice before and gotten beat up badly both times.
Already three or four boys are after him, he says, and he's sure that
it is only a matter of time before the next beating.</TE>
<TE>   Plans to Go AWOL</TE>
<TE>   Beau and Jamesha arrive on another Saturday, both intending to go
AWOL--he from McClaren, she from a group home in Sylmar. "I'm not
going back there," Beau says in an angry whisper. By the time Byron
Allen is done talking to him, Beau says he plans to stick it out, but
Jamesha is adamant about not returning to her home where, she says,
she is not treated with respect.</TE>
<TE>   Beau warns her of the danger of ending up somewhere even worse.
The social worker who brought her to the comedy camp advises her that
if she does not go back, she will be declared a runaway and the
police notified. Jamesha bursts into tears and storms out to the
parking lot, followed by Masada and Allen. After three hours, a
compromise is reached: Jamesha is allowed to go home with a mentor,
whom she regards as a big sister.</TE>
<TE>   Jamesha wipes her tears, relieved. Then she turns a speculative
look on Byron Allen. "Where's your wife?" she wants to know. "I don't
have a wife," he answers. She says, "My big sister is single, you
know." He hugs her and tells her to write to her little sister. What
if the letters don't get there? Jamesha asks. It doesn't matter, he
says. Never let go of your family. Write.</TE>
<TE>   In a few hours, Allen will go on stage as the headliner at the
Laugh Factory. But right now, he's shaken. In all the years he's been
a Comedy Camp counselor, he has never experienced a session so raw.
Needing comfort, he jumps in his car and drives westward, with no
destination in mind, dialing on his cell phone, calling family.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Beau runs away from McClaren. He stops by the
Laugh Factory to tell Masada he's staying with a friend. As of
Thursday he was still missing.</TE>

<HD>Gehry Drops Plans to Relocate to Playa Vista</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Environmentalists fighting to save the Ballona Wetlands claimed a
victory Thursday when it was learned that famed architect Frank Gehry
has dropped plans to move his design studio to the controversial
Playa Vista project site.</LD>
<LD>   Developers last year increased the luster of the Westside project
by announcing that Gehry was relocating there and would help design
buildings for its future construction phases.</LD>
<LD>   But Maguire Partners, the firm that hired Gehry, confirmed that it
has not yet closed escrow on the 114-acre site. And Playa Capital,
the group that owns the site, declined to comment on reports that the
property had been placed back on the market. Playa would say only
that the status of the land "will become clear after the first of the
year."</LD>
<TE>   Gehry, meantime, is said to be acquiring space in an existing
empty building a few blocks from the Playa Vista marshlands and
preparing to relocate his headquarters there by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   Word of that move has triggered a celebration by
environmentalists, who for the past year have petitioned, picketed
and--on one occasion--chained themselves to Gehry's office door to
protest his involvement.</TE>
<TE>   This morning, a coalition of conservationists will march on
Gehry's current Cloverfield Boulevard headquarters in Santa Monica to
deliver an oversized "thank you" card to the architect.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental leaders said they now plan to invite Gehry to join
them in a campaign to turn the parcel he was going to help develop
into permanent open space.</TE>
<TE>   State funding may soon be available for the purchase, according to
environmentalists. They plan to meet next month with Gov. Gray Davis
and state parks officials to press for their support in turning the
Playa Vista space into parkland.</TE>
<TE>   It would not be the first chunk of Playa Vista land to be
designated permanent open space. On the western side of the site,
developers have set aside 340 acres of land and salt marsh for
wildlife habitat and agreed to sell another 193 acres to the state
through the nonprofit Trust for Public Land, if a price can be agreed
upon.</TE>
<TE>   The site now being eyed by environmentalists is on the eastern
side of Playa Vista at the former home of Hughes Aircraft Co.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great opportunity to get this coastal wetland," said
Marsha Hanscom, executive director of the Wetlands Action Network.
"Would he rather have a park outside his office space or more
traffic? Maybe Frank Gehry will go to the governor with us."</TE>
<TE>   Gehry, considered one of the world's premier architects because of
such work as the Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles and the
Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, could not be reached Thursday.
But he has been under increasing public pressure to sever his ties
with Playa Vista.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Lloyd Wright, an architect and grandson of the legendary
Frank Lloyd Wright, was among dozens of protesters who staged a
90-minute vigil outside Gehry's office a year ago to beg that he quit
Playa Vista.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, a longtime friend of Gehry was arrested and jailed
after chaining herself to the door of his design studio to protest
his Playa Vista involvement. Malibu environmentalist Valerie
Sklarevsky's relationship with Gehry had dated to 1969, when both
worked for a Baltimore builder.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Santa Monica activist Jerry Rubin collected thousands of
signatures and messages on a 50-foot-long folded foam board, labeled
"Earth Memo to Frank Gehry," from passersby on the 3rd Street
Promenade urging Gehry to boycott Playa Vista.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin, of the Alliance for Survival, said today's thank-you note
will be a follow-up to the Earth Memo. "I may be hoping against hope,
but I'd love Frank Gehry to join us and design a world-class nature
refuge at Playa Vista ... ," Rubin said.</TE>
<TE>   The company hoping to develop new office buildings on Playa
Vista's eastern side off Centinela Avenue acknowledged that its
planned $90-million land purchase has not been completed. But Maguire
Partners still hopes to seal the deal, said spokeswoman Peggy
Moretti.</TE>
<TE>   The sluggish economy, coupled with a glut of Westside office space
created by the dot-com business meltdown, has slowed the acquisition
process, Moretti said. But Maguire Partners' option to buy the
property remains, and the firm faces no deadline for consummating the
purchase, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Playa Capital can sell to a higher bidder," Moretti said.
However, Maguire Pardners "is committed to acquiring and developing
the campus at Playa Vista," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Moretti described Gehry's planned new headquarters in a
three-decade-old building on nearby Beatrice Street as "Playa Vista
adjacent."</TE>
<TE>   "He's moving in the right direction," she quipped.</TE>
<TE>   But turning the Playa Vista property into a nature habitat may be
more difficult than the environmentalists think, suggested Steve
Sugarman of Playa Capital. Eleven old aircraft factory buildings and
other structures--including the huge and historic "Spruce Goose"
hangar--sit on the site.</TE>
<TE>   "They're talking about wildlife. But the birds that were there in
the past were all the mechanical type," Sugarman said.</TE>

convicted killer David Westerfield fought back tears Thursday as his
sister recounted how the divorce of their parents and then the deaths
of their father and brother left Westerfield depressed and unhappy.</LD>
<LD>   Westerfield wiped his eyes and appeared to have trouble
maintaining his composure as his sister, identified only as Tania P.,
testified how he took charge when their father, a former state
legislator in Maine, died in San Diego in 1993.</LD>
<LD>   "He was depressed, but he took care of everything, the hospital
bills and the funeral," she said between sobs. "He sent flowers to
everyone and was very sensitive to everybody's needs."</LD>
<TE>   The testimony came as Westerfield's defense attorney presented
witnesses to show jurors that Westerfield is not the "worst of the
worst" and does not deserve to be executed. Westerfield was convicted
last week of the kidnap and murder of Danielle van Dam, 7, whose
family lived two doors away in the upscale Sabre Springs
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The jury must decide between recommending death or life in prison
without parole. If the jury recommends death, Superior Court Judge
William Mudd could decide instead to send Westerfield to prison.</TE>
<TE>   If the jury deadlocks, the district attorney could seek a retrial
on the penalty phase. If the D.A. did not seek a retrial, Westerfield
automatically would be sentenced to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of the testimony by Westerfield's sister, Brenda
van Dam, the slain girl's mother, gasped and fled the courtroom in
tears. Under gentle questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek,
46-year-old Tania P. had just explained how much her brother enjoyed
seeing his children grow into adulthood.</TE>
<TE>   About the deaths of Westerfield's father and brother, the
prosecutor asked Tania P.: "None of these people died at the hands of
another, did they?" She replied that both had died of diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield, who has maintained a stoic demeanor during the trial,
seemed particularly upset when Tania P. showed jurors a picture of
their brother and father at Westerfield's high school graduation in
San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, defense attorney Steven Feldman leaned over to
Westerfield as if to console him. During the trial, Feldman rarely
spoke to his client.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, several people who have worked with Westerfield
described his key role in developing medical rehabilitation devices
and an undersea camera that could save the lives of divers working on
deep-sea oil rigs.</TE>
<TE>   Carmen Genovese described his work with Westerfield on a device to
assist people recuperating from knee or hip surgery. "It more than
eased the pain," Genovese said. "It enhanced the healing."</TE>
<TE>   Tania P. said the family owned an island on a lake in Maine, where
the children enjoyed summers swimming and picking berries. The family
moved to San Diego in the 1960s, and Westerfield's father opened a
typesetting firm.</TE>
<TE>   David Westerfield attended community college and then worked at
several jobs as a draftsman and product designer. He was upset by his
parents' divorce in the 1970s and then by his own two divorces, his
sister told jurors.</TE>
<TE>   "I still love him," said Tania P. as her brother again wiped tears
from his eyes.</TE>

<HD>Flawed Makeup of Grand Jury Voids Indictments</HD>
<DH>Court: Santa Barbara judge throws out murder and drug
charges in several Ventura County cases. Complaints are immediately
refiled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Santa Barbara judge has thrown out the indictment of a murder
suspect after ruling that the makeup of the Ventura County Grand Jury
did not reflect the county's population because it lacked
representative numbers of women and Latinos.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by Superior Court Judge William L. Gordon set aside the
indictment against skinhead murder defendant David Ziesmer, as well
as drug charges against five other men in separate cases who
challenged the composition of the grand jury.</LD>
<LD>   New criminal complaints against those defendants were filed
Thursday, and in most of the cases the charges remain the same.</LD>
<TE>   "It in no way compromises our case," said Senior Deputy Dist.
Atty. Bill Haney, who is prosecuting Ziesmer. "We absolutely intend
to pursue him to the fullest extent of the law."</TE>
<TE>   Haney said prosecutors still intend to seek the death penalty for
Ziesmer, 29, who is accused of fatally stabbing a 17-year-old girl in
a motel bathroom in October 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Ziesmer was again charged with murder, conspiracy, solicitation of
murder, participation in a street gang and special allegations that
he killed Nichole Hendrix during a robbery and kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Ziesmer did not enter a plea during a court appearance Thursday
and was ordered back to court Sept. 20. He remains jailed without
bail and his case is expected to proceed to a preliminary hearing
this fall.</TE>
<TE>   While prosecutors filed identical charges against Ziesmer, they
filed reduced charges against two Hells Angels members indicted last
year as part of a massive drug-and-racketeering case.</TE>
<TE>   William Wolf, 32, and Sabian Reynoso, 25, remain charged with drug
possession and drug sales. But they no longer face conspiracy counts
or gang allegations, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin Suh, who would not
comment on the decision to file fewer charges.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon's ruling Wednesday follows two earlier court decisions that
found flaws in Ventura County's grand jury selection process.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Santa Barbara County Superior Court Judge Frank J.
Ochoa set aside the indictment of Ventura murder suspect Michael
Schultz after finding that the grand jury pool did not represent a
fair cross section of the community as required by state and federal
law.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa specifically found that while women constituted half of the
county's jury-eligible population, they represented little more than
a quarter of the grand jury pool.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, Ochoa dismissed a separate indictment against
admitted rapist and murder defendant Vincent Sanchez of Simi Valley
on the same grounds. Prosecutors have since filed new charges against
both men.</TE>
<TE>   The rulings have come from Santa Barbara judges because Ventura
County's judges chose the grand juries in question. The selection
process has since been changed to ensure more diverse grand juries.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers hope the changes will result in fewer indictments
by grand juries, whose proceedings are confidential, and more open
preliminary hearings.</TE>

<HD>Bill on Malpractice Disclosure Approved</HD>
<DH>Health: Davis gets the measure, which requires limited
release of settlements by doctors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Legislature gave its approval Thursday to a bill requiring some
public disclosure, for the first time, of doctors' medical
malpractice settlements.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which heads to the governor's desk, would require the
Medical Board of California to disclose information about physicians'
legal history, in addition to education and license status, to help
patients research doctors.</LD>
<LD>   If the measure becomes law, it would require the medical board to
publish settlements on its Web site if a physician in a "low-risk"
specialty, such as family practice, has three or more settlements of
more than $30,000 in a 10-year period. Doctors in a "high-risk"
specialty, such as neurology, would need four or more settlements to
trigger disclosure.</LD>
<TE>   The board would not be allowed to disclose the dollar amount of
settlements, but would instead indicate whether the settlement is
below average, average or above average compared with other doctors
in the same specialty.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, by Sen. Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont), would only apply to
settlements in the future, not in the past.</TE>
<TE>   The medical board presently does not disclose settlement
information; such deals are often sealed. Under existing law, only
court judgments against doctors must be disclosed to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers found that most complaints to the medical board filed by
the public were closed without a formal investigation, and that 65%
of those who complained were dissatisfied with the board's action.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the number of disciplinary actions taken by the board has
fallen even as complaints increased.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure bill, supported by consumer groups, was opposed by
medical malpractice insurers who felt it would discourage doctors
from settling cases out of fear that such information would be made
public.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the legislation would require the medical
board to give priority to investigations of cases in which a patient
was harmed or died as a result of perceived physician misconduct.</TE>

<HD>Activists Fasting to Support Bill for Illegal Immigrants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three Orange County Latino activists went on a planned 48-hour fast
on Wednesday because they want Gov. Gray Davis to sign a bill to
authorize the granting of driver's licenses for illegal immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   Those participating in the action are Lori Gonzales, 25, of
Anaheim; Jimmy Ramos, 27, of Fullerton; and Olga Vega, 48, of
Placentia.</LD>
<LD>   The three joined other activists in a statewide fast that began at
noon Wednesday in front of the Unitarian Church of Orange County in
Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   At issue is AB 60 by Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles),
which would allow an estimated 800,000 illegal immigrants who are
applying for citizenship or permanent residency to obtain a driver's
license.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has said he would sign such a bill only if it had added
safeguards in the wake of the terrorists attacks of Sept. 11. A
compromise bill would approve licensing of qualified illegal
immigrants to drive, provided they were in the process of becoming
legal residents and were paying federal taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The governor has indicated that he wants greater safeguards, which
would include subjecting license applicants to criminal background
checks, requiring applicants to have worked at least 15 months during
the previous three years and creating an information exchange between
the state Department of Motor Vehicles and the federal Immigration
and Naturalization Service.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a U.S. citizen and I have a driver's license," Gonzales said.
"But I feel that we're advocating for the rights of others. If it
fails, at least we attempted to send a message across and I will have
no regrets to having done this."</TE>

<HD>Mother of Kidnapped Boy Is Hunted</HD>
<DH>Abduction: Authorities say she and a friend are suspects,
in addition to two men who took child.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mother of Nicholas Michael Farber is now considered a suspect in
the disappearance of the 9-year-old boy, who was taken from his
father's Palm Desert home by two armed intruders in the middle of the
night, Riverside County officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Riverside County Sheriff-elect Bob Doyle said 38-year-old Debra
Rose and a friend and former roommate, Carla Bender, are suspects in
the abduction of the boy. Also wanted by authorities are the two men
who actually carried out the kidnapping--breaking into the boy's
home, beating his father and fleeing with Nicholas in a white SUV.</LD>
<LD>   Nicholas had lived with his mother in Colorado until she was
jailed earlier this month. The boy is the subject of an acrimonious
custody battle, and his parents were scheduled to go to court Sept. 5
to debate his living arrangements.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities had said earlier that Rose was not a suspect in the
case, despite suggestions of a serious feud over the boy's custody.</TE>
<TE>   Rose and Bender have not been seen since Nicholas disappeared. In
recent days, both women missed scheduled court hearings in unrelated
cases, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We do believe that they are intimately involved in the
kidnapping," Doyle said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   He would not discuss the basis for investigators' suspicions about
the two women, but he said authorities discovered Rose's recently
purchased 2002 GMC pickup truck Thursday afternoon in a Stateline,
Nev., parking lot. Stateline is near Lake Tahoe.</TE>
<TE>   Doyle also said Rose's troubled history is cause for concern about
the boy's safety. The mother has divorced five times, violated a
restraining order and been accused of an addiction to prescription
drugs, court records show.</TE>
<TE>   "With Debra's background, we are still concerned for Nicholas'
safety," the sheriff-elect said. "We still feel the child could be in
danger. She may not necessarily be in a stable condition."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Farber, manager of an upscale Mexican restaurant in the
Palm Springs area, stepped before a bank of television cameras
Thursday morning to appeal for his son's safe return.</TE>
<TE>   "Please come forward now," said Farber, who was limping badly from
the beating delivered by the kidnappers.</TE>
<TE>   Farber and Rose were married in 1991 and divorced in 1995. He was
her third husband.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities played a copy of Farber's call to 911 after the
kidnapping. On the tape, as a dispatcher tries to calm him and
confirm information about the suspects, he is heard screaming, "They
stole my son!"</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have released a description of the men who abducted
Nicholas. One is described as 5 feet 8, 175 pounds with black hair
and a goatee. The second man was wearing a stocking over his face and
a dark sweatsuit, but Farber told police that he is 6 feet 3 and 240
to 250 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information about the case is asked to call a hotline
at (760) 836-1632. A $46,000 reward has been established for
information that helps authorities locate Nicholas.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Police to Get Grant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Long Beach Police Department will receive $6.2 million to hire 36
community policing officers, the federal government announced
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "We are very excited about the prospect of additional staffing,"
said Long Beach Police Chief Jerome E. Lance.</LD>
<LD>   The 930-officer department was one of 367 nationwide to get grants
from the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Community Oriented
Policing Services. Among area departments, West Covina police will
receive $225,000 to help hire three officers.</LD>
<TE>   "We are pleased that COPS can help Los Angeles-area law
enforcement agencies advance community policing and better protect
the area's communities," said Carl R. Peed, director of the federal
program.</TE>
<TE>   The grants fund 75% of the salary and benefits of each new officer
for three years, up to $75,000, said a Long Beach police spokeswoman,
Maria Carolina Rozas. The officers must work with residents to solve
neighborhood problems, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In Long Beach, community policing officers often walk a beat, help
to organize neighborhood meetings, and tackle quality of life issues
such as gang activity, drug sales and vandalism, said Sgt. Paul
LeBaron.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always been involved in searching out grants that benefit
our Police Department, but one of this size is very exciting," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach was one of 14 police departments in the state to
receive grants. Only Fresno received a larger grant, $6.9 million for
92 officers. Sacramento and San Francisco police also will get
federal funds. To date, COPS has funded the hiring of more than
114,000 officers in more than 12,400 agencies.</TE>

<HD>Ban Sought on Execution of Retarded</HD>
<DH>Capitol: Senate OKs a bill to implement ruling by U.S. high
court. Foes call it a clever attempt to ensure that the death penalty
is never carried out in California.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Rejecting charges that it would weaken the death penalty in
California and set convicted killers free, the state Senate approved
a bill Thursday that would carry out the U.S. Supreme Court's
decision exempting mentally retarded murderers from execution.</LD>
<LD>   Passage followed an impassioned debate in which supporters of the
bill praised it as a sensible way to implement the court decision.
But opponents alleged that the measure was a clever attempt by foes
of capital punishment to ensure that the death penalty would never be
applied in California again.</LD>
<LD>   "I guarantee you that every single murderer ... is suddenly going
to become mentally retarded, because it is a way to escape the
ultimate penalty of death," warned Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta).</LD>
<TE>   Senate President Pro Tem John L. Burton (D-San Francisco), a
lifelong opponent of the death penalty, vigorously defended the bill,
his voice filing the chamber with a thunderous roar that he had not
used for years.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Burton scolded Republicans who said the bill would
weaken capital punishment in the state, noting that two of his
closest friends, former Mayor George Moscone of San Francisco and
labor leader Dow Wilson were murdered.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't tell me about revenge. Don't tell me about an eye for an
eye. I know that stuff.... I know what people feel," Burton boomed.
Even so, he said, he still opposes the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill, mentally retarded defendants no longer would be
executed at San Quentin for first-degree murder with special
circumstances; they would be locked behind bars for the rest of their
lives with no parole.</TE>
<TE>   Burton called the bill a workable response to the court ruling
that would establish a judicial process to determine whether an adult
accused of first-degree murder did, in fact, have the mental age of a
child and was incapable of forming an intent to kill someone or of
understanding the consequences.</TE>
<TE>   In its June ruling, the Supreme Court said putting a mentally
retarded defendant to death violated the Constitution's prohibition
against cruel and unusual punishment. The court left it to the states
to determine which criminals were mentally retarded, including
murderers already on death rows.</TE>
<TE>   Burton and Assemblywoman Dion Aroner, a liberal Democrat from
Berkeley who introduced the bill (AB 557), said it was unknown how
many people on California's death row might qualify as mentally
retarded. But Burton said he believed it was no more than a few.</TE>
<TE>   On a partisan 23-11 vote, two more than needed for approval,
Democrats overwhelmed Republicans and sent the bill to the Assembly,
where its outlook is murky, especially among conservative Democrats
from marginal districts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be much more difficult to get the bill off our
floor," Aroner said. "I'm hoping that members will listen to the
policy discussion and whatever [election] fears they may have will be
overcome by the facts of this bill: The Supreme Court has spoken."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman said Gov. Gray Davis, a supporter of the death
penalty, had taken no position on the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The high court said mentally retarded people do not act with the
"moral culpability" characterized by the most serious of criminal
conduct.</TE>
<TE>   During Senate debate, opponents of the bill asserted that its
definitions were so broad that it would apply to defendants with 20
times the intelligence level of mentally retarded people. They
contended that the real motive of the bill's backers was to eliminate
the death penalty in California.</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Jack Scott (D-Altadena), whose adult son was killed in a
gun accident, appealed for compassion. "Please, let's not get so
bloodthirsty that we think as a society that there is something
wonderful about putting to death somebody who has an IQ of 65," he
told Republican foes of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as platoons of lobbyists armed with cell phones and
extra batteries roamed the Capitol looking for last-minute deals,
lawmakers hit the stretch drive toward the scheduled adjournment of
the 2002 session at midnight Saturday. But because a settlement of
the state budget stalemate continued to elude the Assembly, there was
talk that the session would continue beyond the adjournment date.</TE>
<TE>   In the Assembly, some deals came together Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   After years of negotiations between home builders and lawyers, the
lower chamber passed a compromise on construction-defect lawsuits
that both sides hailed as a triumph. The legislation (SB 800 by
Burton) would provide specific definitions of what can be considered
a construction defect in California, covering everything from
plumbing to windows.</TE>
<TE>   Most significantly for developers, it would grant an absolute
right to repair a problem before they could be sued. And for
homeowners, it would allow suits for prospective damages, thus
preventing them from having to wait for, say, a roof to collapse
before being able to take legal action.</TE>
<TE>   "This bill represents all parties coming together," said
Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento), who represented the
lawyers in the talks. "We all know we have a huge shortage of housing
in this state. Developers are simply not building
single-owner-occupied multifamily housing in California" because they
fear lawsuits, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a good bill that will bring about additional affordable
housing construction," said Assemblyman John Dutra (D-Fremont), who
had advocated for the other side, adding that the right to repair "is
very important for the builders."</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly also approved legislation that would extend the time
that plaintiffs have to file wrongful death or personal injury
lawsuits from one year to two. California is one of only four states
with a one-year statute of limitations.</TE>
<TE>   The measure (SB 688), also by Burton, would additionally extend
the time a legal opponent has to respond to a motion for summary
judgment from 28 days to 75.</TE>
<TE>   And in an abrupt switch of tactics, the United Farm Workers of
America fashioned an alternative bill as a substitute for its
embattled measure that would impose binding arbitration on growers
and the union when contract talks get deadlocked. The latest plan
would substitute nonbinding mediation for the enforced arbitration, a
feature that aides to Davis have said gave him concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Union spokesman Marc Grossman said the latest bill, which cleared
its initial committee on the favorable votes of Democrats, included
suggestions from aides to Davis. But growers called it perhaps even
worse for farmers than the binding arbitration bill that is awaiting
action by the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "This bill is a farce. The sponsors have shamefully disguised
binding arbitration in this bill by calling it mediation," charged
Mike Webb, Western Growers Assn. lobbyist.</TE>

<HD>Parking Fee May Pave Way to Forgiveness, Even Heaven</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The voice came as if from a burning bush.</LD>
<LD>   Come on up to Temple and Grand. See the truth and the light; all
sins shall be forgiven.</LD>
<LD>   So one night after work, this former altar boy cruised by the new
Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels for a sneak peek, glad to beat
the crowds that are expected on opening day next week.</LD>
<TE>   Conveniently, there's a parking garage under the administration
building. As I pulled in, I saw a sign that said the fee is $2.50 for
every 20 minutes, with a $12 maximum. Then I saw a red-vested
attendant on duty at the pay station.</TE>
<TE>   Good Lord. Heaven's got a toll booth.</TE>
<TE>   I had to dig into my pocket to make sure I could cover the tab on
the way out. Luckily I had a few bucks, so I took a ticket and
parked, then headed up the escalator to see what I could see.</TE>
<TE>   Very little, unfortunately.</TE>
<TE>   The entire plaza was cordoned off with yellow tape, and a guard
told me it was off-limits pending a city inspection.</TE>
<TE>   What a let-down. I felt like I'd been called to see Cardinal Roger
Mahony's $200-million baby, a place he humbly calls a symbol of hope
for people of every faith. There hasn't been a prouder Papa since
Donald Trump crowned Atlantic City with his Taj Mahal.</TE>
<TE>   At the Rog Mahal, just a few blocks west of skid row, Mahony has
had a hand in every detail, including the $30 million in art and
adornment. Was it too late, I wondered, to become part of the
cathedral's history by purchasing a paving stone ($50-$5,000), or
perhaps one of the 1,300 crypts that have been called skyboxes for
the dead ($50,000 and up)?</TE>
<TE>   The answers would have to wait. It was getting late, so I went
back to my car and drove to the toll booth.</TE>
<TE>   "That'll be $5," said the attendant.</TE>
<TE>   "Five dollars?" I'd only been there 10 minutes. "I thought it was
$2.50 every 20 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a flat fee after 5 p.m.," he said. "Five dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Lord knows I have sinned, but can I afford the price of
redemption?</TE>
<TE>   I called the church and was told parking will be validated for
those attending Mass. But otherwise, it'll cost you.</TE>
<TE>   Is there another house of God where you pay to park?</TE>
<TE>   I called the First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Free parking.</TE>
<TE>   I called Temple Beth Am on the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   Free parking.</TE>
<TE>   I called the televangelists at the Trinity Broadcasting Network in
Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   And, I was surprised myself, free parking.</TE>
<TE>   I called First AME in South L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "I never heard of anybody having to pay to go to church," said the
receptionist.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah. But when did you ever hear of a $200-million church?</TE>
<TE>   (Tip to parishioners: Instead of $2.50 for 20 minutes, it's $2.50
all day at two parking lots that are across the street from each
other at 1st and Beaudry. Park there, and save your money for the
basket).</TE>
<TE>   I drove back to the cathedral again the next morning, and it was a
little tricky getting there from the Harbor Freeway. Fortunately,
Mahony lobbied the state for a new offramp--essentially a driveway to
his parking garage--that'll cost taxpayers $25 million.</TE>
<TE>   I parked again, and this time I got as far as the gift shop. But
the store was closed and the plaza was still blocked off. I began
wondering if the barricades were a message from God, or, more
frighteningly, from the Cardinal. His Eminence did withdraw a
personal invitation for a tour, after all, when he took issue with a
few columns of mine.</TE>
<TE>   I got a chance to do some window shopping at the gift shop, and
that's when I learned that Ernest and Julio have nothing on Cardinal
Mahony. When the doors open next Tuesday, you'll be able to buy
Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels Chardonnay.</TE>
<TE>   I also saw a three-bottle gift pack that includes the chardonnay
along with Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels Cabernet Sauvignon and
White Zinfandel.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know about you, but sometimes I have trouble quitting once
I start, so I wondered if they have Cathedral of Our Lady of the
Angels aspirin.</TE>
<TE>   Parking, paving, life, death. It's all for sale at the new
spiritual center of the metropolis.</TE>
<TE>   As I was leaving, I noticed that guards with two-way radios were
everywhere, patrolling the temple on the mount. A little late, don't
you think?</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-three diocesan priests have been accused of molesting
minors since 1985, and some of them fled the country and escaped
prosecution because nobody in robes bothered to call the police.</TE>
<TE>   The church owes millions in settlements as a result. But at $2.50
for 20 minutes, it won't take long to cover the tab.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to avert future cases of identity theft, authorities have
issued a warning to Thousand Oaks residents to stop placing outgoing
mail in their curbside mailboxes.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, authorities handled six cases of theft from mailboxes
on and around Gainsborough Road, said Ventura County Sheriff's Senior
Deputy Larry Logan.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities believe the thief or thieves are stealing the mail to
obtain personal information, such as credit card account numbers and
Social Security numbers.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike in past years when authorities received fewer than a dozen
complaints of identity theft a month, Logan said cases now number
closer 40 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Logan advises residents to take mail to a post office and collect
incoming mail as soon as it arrives.</TE>

<HD>Tips Sought in Probe of 2000 Killing</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police increase reward for information. The suspect
is also wanted for questioning in a triple homicide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frustrated in their yearlong effort to catch a suspected killer who
may still live near the scene of the crimes, Los Angeles Police
Department detectives appealed for public help Wednesday, offering an
additional reward for information related to the case.</LD>
<LD>   Timothy Joseph McGhee, 29, is wanted in the killing of Margie
Mendoza, 25, on Nov. 9, 2000. The slaying took place in Atwater
Village, just across the Los Angeles line from the intersection of
San Fernando Road and Chevy Chase Drive in Glendale.</LD>
<LD>   McGhee is also wanted for questioning in a triple homicide in the
area Aug. 8, 2001, in which Bryham Robinson, 38; Cheri Wisotsky, 46;
and her mother, Mary Ann Wisotsky, 64, were killed.</LD>
<TE>   Detectives believe that McGee still frequents the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The department added $5,000 to an offer for information on McGee's
whereabouts, bringing the reward total to $55,000.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Wisotsky, daughter-and sister-in-law of two of the victims,
said relatives eagerly await McGhee's capture.</TE>
<TE>   The victims "were in their own neighborhood, among their own
neighbors, and they were executed by neighbors," she said. "We just
plead that some of those neighbors will come forward."</TE>
<TE>   McGhee is described as white, 5-foot-11, weighing about 190 pounds
and having brown eyes. He has the local gang name tattooed on his
back, its initials on his stomach and the letters "NELA" behind his
left ear.</TE>
<TE>   Information can be provided anonymously, in writing, or by calling
the LAPD at (213) 847-4261 or (213) 485-2563.</TE>

<HD>Filming Leaves Valley Bus Riders Stranded</HD>
<DH>Transit: Commercial closes part of Van Nuys Boulevard,
prompting MTA officials at meeting to offer to chauffeur.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rerouting buses to accommodate film production crews may be routine
for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, but transit officials
found the timing especially bad Wednesday night in Van Nuys.</LD>
<LD>   As people were leaving an MTA-sponsored community meeting on bus
service, many in the crowd of several dozen found that their buses
were unavailable because Los Angeles police had closed a nearly
one-mile stretch of Van Nuys Boulevard for the filming of a
soft-drink commercial.</LD>
<LD>   MTA buses, along with other traffic, were redirected away from the
site.</LD>
<TE>   "We're stranded!" several bus riders cried.</TE>
<TE>   The startled--and no doubt embarrassed--MTA officials quickly
offered to chauffeur some of the residents to the nearest bus stop
outside the closed area.</TE>
<TE>   Others who found themselves looking for buses along Van Nuys
Boulevard were angry and confused. Some fell asleep on benches,
unaware that buses would not pass through the area for several hours.</TE>
<TE>   "I have things to do," said Debra Giron, 16, who needed to go to
Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   She sought information on a cardboard hand-written sign posted at
the bus stop announcing a "temporary stop change" at Vose or Hatteras
streets.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's Vose Street? Where's Hatteras?" asked Giron, who was new
to the area. The sign and a route map underneath offered no clues.</TE>
<TE>   Trudging past with hunched shoulders, construction worker Juan
Meneces said he had to walk 15 blocks to get home.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the things bus riders face," said Bart Reed, executive
director of the Transit Coalition, a Sylmar-based rider advocacy
group, just before he was offered a car ride home from the meeting.
"It's so Kafka-esque. Here we are working on bus improvements, and
the city of L.A. and their filming is thwarting us trying to get
home."</TE>
<TE>   Street closures result in the detouring, on average, of one bus
line daily among the MTA's 185 lines, agency spokesman Ed Scannell
said. The Van Nuys Boulevard closure, which required rerouting buses
on at least three lines for three nights, was scheduled to end today.</TE>
<TE>   City officials estimate that other special events, ranging from
parades to the Academy Awards, result in more than 1,000 street
closures annually. City and entertainment industry officials said
diverting traffic for rolling cameras is a fact of life in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "The city and the county understand what this industry means to
the economy," said Morrie Goldman, spokesman for the Entertainment
Industry Development Corp., which helps production companies obtain
filming permits that result in street closures.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, sometimes it can be an inconvenience."</TE>

<LD>An 18-year-old man was killed in a drive-by shooting in Fullerton,
marking the city's first homicide this year.</LD>
<LD>   Leonardo Rojas was standing in front of his apartment in the 3000
block of Garnet Lane about 10:42 p.m. Wednesday looking at
loudspeakers he was considering buying. Witnesses told police a green
Ford Explorer pulled up with several male passengers, all of whom had
shaved heads. A young man in the front passenger seat pointed a
handgun out the window and fired once, witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   Rojas was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he died
about 1:30 a.m. Thursday.</LD>

<HD>O.C. Students Improve Stanford 9 Scores; 58% Beat National
Average</HD>
<DH>Education: 'It is another indicator that our schools are
focused on the right things,' county Supt. Habermehl says. Not all
schools show improvement, however.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County students continued to make steady gains on the Stanford
9 tests and outperformed their peers statewide for the fifth year in
a row, but the results for individual schools, made public Thursday,
were a mixed bag.</LD>
<LD>   According to a Times analysis, 58% of Orange County's second-to
11th-graders who took the test last spring scored at or above the
national average. The number was 49% in 1998, the first year the test
was administered.</LD>
<LD>   Statewide, about half of the students scored at or above the
national average, up from 42% four years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Local education officials hailed the results as a sign that the
county is on the right track.</TE>
<TE>   "It is another indicator that our schools are focused on the right
things," said Orange County Supt. William M. Habermehl. The teachers
"are not teaching to the tests, they are teaching content, so when
the students take the tests they are doing well."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers at John Marshall Elementary School in Westminster agreed.
The school saw its Stanford 9 test results soar 32.8 percentage
points in four years. Nearly 60% of Marshall students tested
performed at or above the national average last spring, according to
the Times analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Having a curriculum in which classes are made relevant to state
academic standards was the key factor in the school's success,
teachers said.</TE>
<TE>   "We teach only to the standards now," said fifth-grade teacher
Diana Johnson, who will be in her 33rd year of teaching at Marshall
when school starts Thursday. "There's nothing wasted."</TE>
<TE>   In the staff workroom Thursday, first-grade teacher Chi Carr was
trimming paper letters for her classroom's Accelerated Reading
bulletin board. The program awards students points for reading books
based on their difficulty, which teachers credit with raising
comprehension at the school, where 76% of the students are still
learning English.</TE>
<TE>   "We're giving them the tools to prepare for the test," Carr said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the teachers' best efforts, the annual report on who's
ahead and who's behind on the academic race can feel like a roller
coaster ride for some schools, and a marathon for others.</TE>
<TE>   Schools are praised one year for making gains, and castigated the
next for slipping back.</TE>
<TE>   A Scores Roller Coaster</TE>
<TE>   Lambert Elementary School in Tustin showed some of the greatest
gains in the county on the Stanford 9 tests the first two years. Last
year it showed a steep fall. This year the school was up again, with
38% of its students tested scoring at or above the national average.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Principal Janet Bittick was already looking to next
year. Teachers and administrators are getting ready to examine their
latest performance, she said, to answer the question "What have we
done well, and what do we need to keep plugging away at?"</TE>
<TE>   Capistrano Unified School District, which has some of the
highest-performing schools in the county, will be doing the same.
About 72% of the district's students performed at or above the
national average, virtually the same as last year.</TE>
<TE>   "When you reach a certain level, there's only so many years in a
row you can improve before you level off or slip," said Capistrano
Unified Supt. James A. Fleming, who compared his district to a
marathon runner on the last leg of a race. "There's a natural feeling
of disappointment, but you have to remain focused and find new ways
to improve."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Melbourne A. Gauer Elementary in Anaheim have
searched for years for ways to improve. The school, with a high
percentage of low-income students and children still learning
English, has never had more than 39% of its pupils testing at or
above the national average.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the odds, the school nonetheless made gains in other
educational areas and qualified for state awards given to schools
showing improvement.</TE>
<TE>   Gauer's experience illustrates the complexity of measuring
achievement in this era of school accountability, officials said. And
things are likely to get more complicated.</TE>
<TE>   The Stanford 9 is a multiple-choice exam that tests skills in
math, language and sciences and then compares individual results
against the performance of a national sample of students.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the state also began adding other standardized exams, now
called the California Standards Test, which are designed to gauge how
well students are mastering the state's academic curriculum in
multiple subjects.</TE>
<TE>   Both tests are part of the state's Standardized Testing and
Reporting Program, STAR, and the cornerstone of California's school
accountability plan.</TE>
<TE>   Dueling Test Results</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's California Standards Test results show most of those
same well-performing Orange County students have a way to go before
they are deemed proficient in subjects such as English language arts
and mathematics. Overall, less than half of the students were
proficient in those subjects, according to Thursday's results.</TE>
<TE>   "It is confusing to people," Habermehl said. "They are looking at
the [Stanford 9] results and we are doing a great job, and then they
look at the [California Standards Test] and, wow, we are not doing so
well."</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high. Under STAR, improving schools qualify for
cash prizes from the state, and those who consistently lag behind
risk sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government will also start tying grants to student
performance on standardized tests as part of the No Child Left Behind
Act, which became law this year.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials are concerned about testing saturation.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the public understands they have to be patient with the
system," said Al Mijares, superintendent of the Santa Ana Unified
School District, the largest in the county.</TE>
<TE>   The district has steadily improved its Stanford 9 scores. Last
spring, 32% of its students rated at or above the national average,
up from 21% four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But like other county students, Santa Ana pupils performed poorly
on the California Standards Test, which Mijares and others say has
some of the highest academic standards in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The state will replace the Stanford 9 next year with another,
similar exam and shift emphasis to the California Standards Test when
assessing schools.</TE>
<TE>   "In any industry, if you change the rules every few years, you
will have some problems," Mijares said. "That is what is being asked
of public schools."</TE>

<KH>Steve Harvey ONLY IN L.A.</KH>
<HD>Here's a Hot One That Should Rank Right Up There With
Police Log Fans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ah, the sounds of summer! The police log of the Seal Beach Sun said
that a woman who was "heard screaming and yelling obscenities inside
a home" was merely "having problems with her ceiling fan."</LD>
<LD>   Attention, Seal Beachites: Lyndon Dowdle read about an instrument
that can cut down on the din in your neighborhood (see accompanying).</LD>
<LD>   Duel in the streets: In Anaheim, Bruce Walker found the
inspiration for the 1979 Dustin Hoffman-Meryl Streep movie, "Kramer
vs. Kramer" (see photo).</LD>
<TE>   Sprawling L.A.: Berlin felt like home, sort of, to Robert Jensen
of L.A., when he came upon a park named after the City of Angels (see
accompanying). It turns out that Berlin and L.A. are sister cities.
In honor of our car culture here, L.A. Platz naturally houses a
parking garage.</TE>
<TE>   This mystery may never be solved: The police log of the Los
Alamitos News-Enterprise said, "A resident reported losing a 10-pound
jar of mayonnaise." (I hope it wasn't for the Labor Day picnic.)</TE>
<TE>   And try to figure this one out: After I mentioned that Century 21
Beachside Realtors has an office in Brea, a reader pointed out that
it also has branches in Rancho Cucamonga, Upland and Mission Viejo.
Must be great for the workers, being so close to the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Who says American kids aren't learning? On Amazon.com's Web site,
Jon Hershey of Long Beach spotted what surely is a representative
book being read to the pre-kindergarten crowd (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Everyone has a slip now and then: The Los Angeles Independent's
police log listed the arrest of a driver who, after being advised of
his rights, said: "Yes, I understand and want to clear this up. I
haven't used drugs in 14 years, that's the truth!"</TE>
<TE>   He then added, "Well, I did smoke some crack cocaine last night,
or it could have been early this morning."</TE>
<TE>   Treated like a dog: If you bring along your pooch to dine outdoors
at the Sweet Life, on 3rd Street in L.A., the waiter will deliver a
bowl of water to your companion.</TE>
<TE>   I just hope your dog isn't a big drooler.</TE>
<TE>   More on the drinking life: Mike Jelf of Lomita was watching a 1958
rerun of TV's "Perry Mason" in which Mason and secretary Della Street
were exulting over still another victory. Then came this bit of
merriment over one disclosure:</TE>
<TE>   Mason: "There's one thing about this case that still puzzles me."</TE>
<TE>   Street: "What's that?"</TE>
<TE>   Mason: "What could they possibly put in a cup of coffee that makes
it worth a dollar?"</TE>
<TE>   As I said, this was 1958, so I guess it wasn't a shot of espresso.
Or steamed milk. Or chocolate sprinkles.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: You can still get a cup of coffee for a dime at
Philippe's, the 94-year-old eatery near Union Station.</TE>

<KH>ON THE LAW</KH>
<HD>Attorneys Find Defense Against Dependency</HD>
<DH>Michael Brady helped write a law creating an assistance
program for lawyers battling substance abuse just as he did nine
years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sacramento attorney Michael K. Brady's drinking got worse in 1993,
after he watched a client die in San Quentin's gas chamber.</LD>
<LD>   He soon began using cocaine and methamphetamines to wake from the
alcohol-induced stupor. Then he quit practicing law altogether.</LD>
<LD>   Brady, a once-prominent criminal defense attorney, was arrested
six times in eight weeks in 1998 for crimes ranging from misdemeanor
drug possession to auto theft and receiving stolen property. He
pleaded no contest to two felonies and was sentenced to civil
commitment at the California Rehabilitation Center for substance
abuse.</LD>
<TE>   When he was released in April 2000, Brady pledged to help other
chemical-dependent attorneys before their lives spiraled out of
control as his had.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks, Senate leader John L. Burton (D-San Francisco) hired
Brady, 50, to research and help write the law creating the State Bar
of California's new Lawyer Assistance Program.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is to have more competent attorneys practicing law in
California," said Brady, who was disbarred as a result of his felony
convictions. "Lawyers who are chemical dependent cannot competently
practice law, so clients' cases are in jeopardy."</TE>
<TE>   The legislation--introduced in January 2001 and enacted six months
later--requires the State Bar to offer its members early intervention
and treatment for chemical dependency and mental health problems.</TE>
<TE>   Brady said the American Bar Assn. estimates that 15% to 18% of the
nation's lawyers are alcoholics, compared with 10% of the general
adult population. He also cited a Law and Psychology Review article
concluding that 10% of practicing lawyers suffer from psychological
distress.</TE>
<TE>   Based on those statistics, he believes as many as 38,000 of
California's 135,805 attorneys suffer from alcoholism, drug
addiction, depression or other mental disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Brady can personally attest to the pressures of law practice. He
graduated from McGeorge School of Law and passed the bar in 1984.
During the next 14 years, he completed more than 200 jury trials,
including six death-penalty cases, and earned $500,000 annually.</TE>
<TE>   "I had always been a drinker and kind of a workaholic," he said.
"I thought I was bulletproof."</TE>
<TE>   He said his downfall was believing he was emotionally prepared to
watch convicted murderer David Edwin Mason die. "I felt like Lady
Macbeth. I couldn't get the blood off of my hands," he said. "I
didn't want to be a lawyer anymore"</TE>
<TE>   By 1996, his wife and 3-year-old son left him. He lost his house
and car--and eventually his law license and his freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the signs were there," Brady said, but no one urged him to
seek treatment before his incarceration. "When I sobered up, I
realized, whew, what have I done."</TE>
<TE>   In response to the legislation, the bar began its assistance
program in March. Already, 70 attorneys have signed up--half of them
voluntarily, Director Janis Thibault said. The other half was
referred to the program through the bar's disciplinary system.</TE>
<TE>   "These are disorders that get worse without some intervention or
some change," she said. "There is a certain amount of negligence in
not responding" before they worsen and cause harm to clients.</TE>
<TE>   The Lawyer Assistance Program is modeled after the California
Medical Board's long-running substance-abuse treatment program for
addicted doctors.</TE>
<TE>   The ABA Commission on Lawyer Assistance Programs reports that "a
majority of [lawyer] disciplinary problems involve chemical
dependency or emotional stress."</TE>
<TE>   In California, about 40% of all lawyer disciplinary proceedings
end in default judgments, in which the attorney simply does not
respond to the allegations, said Starr Babcock, a bar executive who
oversees the assistance program. Of the remaining cases, about 25%
cite substance abuse and mental illness as mitigating factors.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to protecting the public, supporters say the
assistance program over time should reduce the cost of disciplining
lawyers. The bar spends $30 million a year on its discipline system.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, the State Bar would not find out about [chemical
dependency] until some kind of discipline problem surfaced," said
Richard Carlton, acting deputy director of the Lawyer Assistance
Program. "What we want to do now is find out about these problems
much earlier so we can intervene."</TE>
<TE>   Every state has some kind of program--driven either by paid staff
or volunteers--to help attorneys deal with substance abuse and mental
illness, said Donna L. Spilis, director for the ABA Commission on
Lawyer Assistance Programs.</TE>
<TE>   Before now, California had two small programs--the Lawyers
Personal Assistance Program, which provides temporary counseling to
lawyers for myriad personal problems, and The Other Bar, a nonprofit
group dedicated to helping lawyers deal with alcoholism.</TE>
<TE>   And since 1992, California lawyers have been required to attend a
one-hour session on the prevention and treatment of substance abuse
as part of their mandatory continuing legal education program.</TE>
<TE>   The new program, however, is the most ambitious yet, according to
State Bar officials and Brady, who researched comparable programs in
all 50 states.</TE>
<TE>   The Burton bill mandates outreach to judges and others who may
anonymously refer attorneys to the program, and financial aid for
attorneys who cannot afford treatment. It dedicates $10 per attorney
in bar dues, or $1.4 million annually, to funding the program.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody thought we could do it. This was a dream program," Brady
said. "If it wasn't for Sen. Burton, this program would not exist."</TE>
<TE>   Participants are evaluated over a 90-day period. An individualized
treatment plan that includes random drug testing is formulated. The
program is confidential.</TE>
<TE>   Success is defined as five years in the treatment program with at
least three years of continuous sobriety, Thibault said. Studies show
a significant reduction in relapse after five years, she said.</TE>
<TE>   To better monitor participants, the State Bar Court has proposed
its own kind of pilot drug court for attorneys. It is awaiting state
Supreme Court approval.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, two judges--JoAnn M. Remke in San Francisco
and Paul Bacigalupo in Los Angeles--will hear all matters involving
attorneys with drug or alcohol addictions or mental illness,
coordinator David Hull said.</TE>
<TE>   The judges will refer those attorneys to the Lawyer Assistance
Program for a 90-day assessment. Program officials will recommend to
the court a treatment plan that, when completed, may result in
reduced discipline, Hull said.</TE>
<TE>   Brady said a lawyer assistance program, like the one he helped
create, might have helped him before he lost everything and found
himself in jail.</TE>
<TE>   "If they had caught me early in the process ... I would have gone
to treatment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since his release from prison, Brady has completed parole and his
criminal record has been wiped clean, in accordance with the
civil-commitment law under which he was sentenced. He plans to
reapply for his law license in January.</TE>

<LD>When you live on a 31-foot boat in the still waters of Newport
Harbor, the world must look pretty sweet. Or, let's just say you can
come to count on certain things--almost all of them good.</LD>
<LD>   Then there's the world out there beyond the seas, out in places
where it's hard to count on anything--or, if you can, almost all of
them are bad.</LD>
<LD>   Beverly Anderson is talking about that other world, the one beyond
the serene life she and her husband share aboard the Tansy Lee.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Anderson, 43, spent two weeks in Israel on
tour with the human rights organization Global Exchange. "This is how
I spend my vacations," she jokes, "going to areas of conflict and to
places where people are not doing well."</TE>
<TE>   The group of 10 spent most of its time in the occupied territories
of the West Bank and Gaza, talking both formally and informally with
Israelis and Palestinians. What Anderson picked up from her
conversations is that people on both sides of the political divide
are living lives of not-so-quiet desperation.</TE>
<TE>   "I talked to 63 people on my own," says Anderson, who runs her own
business consulting firm in Newport Beach. "I wanted to look at both
sides of the situation, objectively. I'd go into shops, people would
make coffee or tea and sit down and talk for hours, because they want
to talk about it, because they want help."</TE>
<TE>   Even the most hawkish Israelis, she says, are wearying of the
occupation. "They said they can't go on like this," she says. They
lament military checkpoints in Israel that they too must pass
through.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, she deplores the suicide bombings and the terror
they cause in Israel. But it is the plight of Palestinians that
predominates in her reflections. Their economy is ruined and life
under occupation is a relentless submission to Israeli authority.</TE>
<TE>   A typical day in an occupied town, she says, might begin with a
loudspeaker announcement telling residents during which hours they
may go to the grocery store or visit a relative. In one town, she
says, mothers were feeding their infants sugar water because they
couldn't get milk. To counter that, members of Israel's "peace
movement" brought in formula and other food.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson made a point of meeting with the father of a 17-year-old
suicide bomber. The boy's father is a math teacher who said his son
killed only himself at a falafel stand when the bomb strapped to him
apparently detonated prematurely.</TE>
<TE>   "The father said he didn't know his son was going to do it,"
Anderson says. "He said he was a straight-A student, the town had
been under curfew for 51 days and he was not allowed to go to school,
and he had become more and more depressed and despondent."</TE>
<TE>   The father told her, Anderson says, that his son hadn't been
involved politically and wasn't particularly religious.</TE>
<TE>   As Anderson talked with the dead boy's father, the family
possessions were in a tent next to their home that had been destroyed
by an Israeli offensive.</TE>
<TE>   So it goes, day in and day out, in the occupied territories.
Transposed to Orange County, it would be as though Garden Grove
residents were confined to their homes, unable to go to work, school
or grocery stores without permission. Or, would not be allowed to
visit friends or relatives in neighboring Anaheim without being
searched at gunpoint.</TE>
<TE>   It's a world of despair that seems much farther than a mere
half-a-world away from the peaceful waters of Newport Harbor.
"Another planet," Anderson says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a weird adjustment for the first few days when you come
back," she says, "not looking over your shoulder and just having a
heightened awareness of your surroundings and wondering if there's
someone coming at you with guns."</TE>

<HD>High Court Scraps Racial Limits in School Transfers</HD>
<DH>Law: State justices side with a father who argued that a
Huntington Beach district's policy aimed at preserving ethnic
balances is illegal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN and DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court has backed a father who argued that a
Huntington Beach Union High School District policy limiting student
transfers on the basis of race violates state law.</LD>
<LD>   The court Wednesday upheld without comment a June appellate court
ruling. Lawyers for the state Department of Education, which
supported the district, said the ruling could cripple voluntary
desegregation efforts statewide and said they may seek an appeal to
the U.S. Supreme Court.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't want [the school at the center of the case] to become
any more racially isolated than it already is," said Joanne Lowe, a
lawyer with the education department. "To allow that would be to
violate the rights of kids to get an equal education."</LD>
<TE>   The case--Crawford vs. Huntington Beach Union High School
District--began in 1999 when Donald Bruce Crawford, a Fountain Valley
parent, sued the district alleging that its policy of denying some
students transfers within the district to maintain ethnic balance
discriminated against white students and violated the state
Constitution as amended by Proposition 209, the 1996 state ballot
initiative that ended affirmative action.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1994 students in the district had the right to freely
transfer among its eight high schools. Then district officials began
noticing that many white students were transferring out of schools
with large ethnic enrollments such Westminster High School, where the
percentage of white students dropped from 25% to 16% in just a few
years. In an effort to stem that tide, they revised the policy in
1999, requiring that transfers be balanced to maintain the racial and
ethnic character of each school.</TE>
<TE>   A lower court upheld the policy, ruling in the district's favor.
In June, however, the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana
struck it down, ruling that the attempt to maintain balance by race
and ethnicity was an unconstitutional violation of Proposition 209.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not dispute the evils of segregated schools and we
recognize the potential benefits of attending a racially and
ethnically diverse school," Justice David Sills wrote, "but the
people have spoken."</TE>
<TE>   Though a California appellate court decision is technically not
binding outside its district, experts said, most state courts of
appeal ordinarily defer to such rulings.</TE>
<TE>   Still unclear Thursday was how many other districts in the state
will be affected by the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Marian Bergeson, a former member of the State Board of Education
and secretary of education under Gov. Pete Wilson, said the ruling
simply reinforced the direction in which most school districts
state--and nationwide--are already headed. "I'm not aware of any
other districts that do this," she said, referring to the Huntington
Beach policy. "The general movement has been in the opposite
direction."</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon Browne, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation,
which represented Crawford, predicted a wide fallout. "This ruling
sends a message to all school districts that have similar policies,"
she said. "It tells them that their policies are unconstitutional and
they need to get rid of them or they're wide open for a lawsuit."</TE>
<TE>   Crawford expressed satisfaction at the outcome: "To me, it's not
just a great legal victory, but a great moral victory. I think that
race-based transfer policies in general are morally repugnant."</TE>
<TE>   School board member Michael Simons said trustees would meet with
their lawyer Sept. 10 to decide what to do.</TE>

<HD>SCAG Bill Could Cause Loss of Transit Funds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal funding for Orange County transportation projects could be
jeopardized if a bill approved by the Legislature this week is signed
by Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, written by Assemblyman George Nakano (D-Torrance),
requires Southern California's regional planning agency to provide a
"fair-share distribution" of the burdens of airport growth among
Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura and Imperial
counties.</LD>
<LD>   Counties must comply with regional transportation plans approved
by the Southern California Assn. of Governments or risk losing
federal funds. Counties also could lose federal funds if their
actions are found to create excessive air pollution in other areas.</LD>
<TE>   Nakano's bill originally was a challenge to Orange County to
provide more airport space for its business and leisure travelers.
John Wayne Airport is capped at 8.4 million passengers a year through
2005; county supervisors have voted to increase that to 9.8 million
through 2015.</TE>
<TE>   If SCAG plans to seek a larger airport at John Wayne than county
officials want, Orange County could have trouble getting federal
funds for some transportation projects.</TE>
<TE>   Association officials said they hope to better define what
constitutes a county's "fair share" of airport demand if the bill, AB
2333, is signed by Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The bill passed 47 to 30 in the Assembly and 22 to 17 in the
Senate; the Assembly this week concurred with amendments added by the
Senate.</TE>

<HD>Secession Not Seen as Good for Business</HD>
<DH>Hollywood: Chamber of Commerce votes to oppose independence
effort, fearing breakup would hurt growth, redevelopment plans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The board of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce came out against
Hollywood secession on Thursday, saying a breakup would pose a risk
to business growth and could jeopardize redevelopment projects that
are helping to turn the area around.</LD>
<LD>   To support Hollywood secession, the board would have needed to see
it as good for the business community, said Leron Gubler, president
and chief executive of the chamber, which has more than 1,000
members.</LD>
<LD>   "Perhaps one day, once the city was established, it would be, but
there's so much uncertainty," Gubler said. "The revitalization of
Hollywood is still fairly fragile. We want to sustain it. The timing
isn't right for this."</LD>
<TE>   Twenty-four of the chamber's 36 board members were present for the
vote, Gubler said. Of those, 23 voted to oppose secession and one
abstained.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secession leader Gene La Pietra dismissed the chamber's
announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a decision made by a few people sitting on the executive
board that mostly don't live in Hollywood and that [work for] major
corporations and represent special interests," said the millionaire
nightclub owner. "They do not represent the small businesses that are
looking for relief and that support us."</TE>
<TE>   A chamber member, La Pietra said he was disappointed that the
entire membership didn't get to vote and that he was never given a
chance to present his case to the board. His organization, Hollywood
VOTE, said Thursday that a breakaway Hollywood business group is
being formed.</TE>
<TE>   Gubler said the chamber didn't seek out presentations from
supporters or opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been following the issue very carefully, and we wanted to
make an independent decision," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the chamber has not discussed whether to contribute money
to the anti-secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Secession measures for Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley are
on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Before holding its vote, the chamber commissioned a study of the
proposed new city from MuniFinancial, a large public finance
consulting firm based in Temecula. That review stated that Hollywood
would be viable as an independent city. But it questioned whether the
city would have the financial resources to cut taxes and improve
services, as secession leaders have promised.</TE>
<TE>   It also said that secession could be risky for development
projects already underway and that utility rates could go up if Los
Angeles successfully challenged a decision that the Department of
Water and Power must charge residents of a new city the same rates as
it does Los Angeles residents.</TE>
<TE>   The firm even suggested that the city might have trouble paying
public safety costs for events such as the Academy Awards and the
Hollywood Christmas Parade.</TE>
<TE>   Gubler said a substantial number of the chamber's board members
live in Hollywood. He also said that the chamber polled its members
several times, most recently in April, and found that roughly
two-thirds of them oppose secession.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra said that he had never been polled.</TE>
<TE>   The Greater Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce and the Central City
Assn., a downtown business group, both oppose secession. Meanwhile,
the United Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando Valley has come
out in favor of Valley secession.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Thursday, secession proponents and foes filed rebuttal
arguments for the Nov. 5 ballot pamphlet. The opponents, led by Mayor
James K. Hahn, labeled the breakup proposals "financially risky."
Supporters said the secession opponents were trying to "confuse and
scare" voters. They said there would be no new taxes, and that water
and power rates would be locked in.</TE>

<HD>County Officers Approve New Contract</HD>
<DH>Labor: Probation and corrections employees will get a raise
and earlier retirement if the Board of Supervisors accepts the deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County probation and corrections services officers have
approved a labor contract that will give them raises ranging from 10%
to 16% over the next 3 1/2 years.</LD>
<LD>   Officers also secured the right to be classified as safety
employees, a label that entitles them to retire as early as 50
instead of the minimum 60 required for most county workers.</LD>
<LD>   While a ratification vote last week by the Ventura County
Professional Peace Officers' Assn. "was not overwhelming," officers
were pleased to win the safety classification, union President Diane
Hubbard said.</LD>
<TE>   "I've been here 30 years, and for the last 15 years, it's been an
issue," Hubbard said. "Eighty-five percent of probation agencies
throughout the state offer a safety retirement."</TE>
<TE>   About 275 probation and corrections workers are covered by the
agreement. Probation officers write reports, make sentencing
recommendations and supervise convicts after their release from
prison. Corrections officers work with incarcerated youths.</TE>
<TE>   Another 25 employees who patrol the county's parks, airports and
harbor will also get raises, but will remain in the "miscellaneous"
worker category with no changes in retirement.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County Board of Supervisors probably will approve the
labor agreement when it reconvenes after a monthlong break Sept. 10.
The board also is expected to approve a new contract for deputy
sheriffs that deputies endorsed last month.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Kathy Long said she will be glad to have that contract
wrapped up. Negotiations with the deputy sheriffs' group took more
than 18 months as the two sides battled over the union's demand for
richer pensions.</TE>
<TE>   "There were expectations on both sides that were greater than what
anyone could come through with," Long said. "It's good to get them
resolved."</TE>
<TE>   Deputies were pushing for a benefit that would have increased
their retirement pay by 50%. The law enforcement union backed off
when it became clear that supervisors would not approve the benefit
because the county is facing financial trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Probation officers also want the benefit, known as 3% at 50, under
which deputies can retire at 50 and receive 3% of their pay for every
year of service. The current standard is 2%. But they will save that
demand for future negotiations, Hubbard said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are taking it in steps," she said. "We will fight the 3[%] at
50 battle down the line, along with the sheriff's deputies." The
deputies have vowed to revive the issue when their current contract
expires.</TE>
<TE>   The wage increases will bring probation officers' pay up to par
with salaries offered by the state and neighboring agencies, Hubbard
said. Officers currently earn between $31,000 and $45,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We had been one of the lowest-paid probation agencies for a
number of years," Hubbard said. "It was a recruitment issue."</TE>

<HD>Simon Criticizes Davis' Ethics</HD>
<DH>Politics: GOP challenger calls the governor a captive of
special interests, vows he would set a higher standard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. on Thursday accused
Gov. Gray Davis of being held captive by special interests and
promised that he would set a new ethical standard if elected.</LD>
<LD>   The wealthy investment manager, who has struggled to contain
charges about his business practices this summer, said Californians
have become jaded by stories linking the governor's fund-raising to
state policies and contracts.</LD>
<LD>   "Public confidence is shaken in many of our institutions, and
nowhere is that more the case than in our government," Simon said in
a speech to more than 700 Rotary Club members in Sacramento. "As
governor, I will take clear and unambiguous steps to restore
accountability and trust in our government."</LD>
<TE>   Among other measures, Simon proposed independent audits of all
state spending by an external organization, an end to sole-source
contracting, and a December budget review that would trigger
automatic spending cuts if expenditures had exceeded revenues.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP candidate also said that, to avoid the appearance of
impropriety, he would refrain from raising campaign money during the
final month of the legislative session and the month of bill signing
that follows.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis reelection campaign fired back by calling Simon
ill-suited to set an ethical standard.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's family investment firm was hit with a multimillion-dollar
fraud verdict this summer. Earlier this year, his family's municipal
bond firm was fined $10,000 by the National Assn. of Securities
Dealers in a pay-to-play scandal, and Simon himself was named by the
Internal Revenue Service as a beneficiary of a possibly illegal
offshore tax shelter.</TE>
<TE>   "When Bill Simon wants to give lectures on ethics, he'd be better
off standing in front of a mirror and addressing himself," said Davis
campaign spokesman Roger Salazar.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar added that most of the proposals Simon made Thursday
already are in place. Audits are conducted by the legislative analyst
and controller's office, and the state budget is reviewed in May to
ensure that spending is in line with revenue. Taking a hiatus from
fund-raising during end-of-session bill signing would give wealthy
candidates who do not need to raise as much money an advantage,
Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Simon has tried to divert the focus on his
business problems to Davis' fund-raising practices.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon's baggage may constrain his ability to criticize the
governor's behavior.</TE>
<TE>   A poll released this week by the nonpartisan Public Policy
Institute of California found that 43% of likely voters believed that
Davis would do a better job of maintaining high ethical standards in
government, while only 28% said Simon would.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara O'Connor, director of the Institute for Politics and Media
at Cal State Sacramento, said Simon hurt his credibility on ethics
when he said he was not involved in decisions that led to his various
business problems.</TE>

<HD>Labor Day Traffic at LAX Expected to Be Down 15%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM and HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What a difference a year makes.</LD>
<LD>   Last August and the subsequent Labor Day holiday were record
travel periods at Los Angeles International Airport, with the highest
passenger totals of any month recorded in the facility's 73-year
history.</LD>
<LD>   This year, however, officials expect Labor Day traffic to be down
15%, with 700,000 travelers passing through the world's fifth-busiest
airport during the four-day weekend.</LD>
<TE>   With the economy still in the doldrums and the effects of the
terrorist attacks lingering, air travel isn't the only mode of
transportation expected to languish this weekend. Car trips are also
projected to be down, according to the Auto Club of Southern
California. Travel by boat, bus and train, however, is expected to
increase.</TE>
<TE>   At LAX, Labor Day travel projections are on par with the number of
passengers who used the airport over Memorial Day--a sign that the
improvement in air traffic earlier this year is stalling. A move by
airlines to slash their schedules at LAX by 20% in the last year
contributed to the decline.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news is traffic is moving, but the bad news is that
traffic is moving," said Paul Haney, an airport spokesman,
illustrating the stagnation with a reference to the airport's
horseshoe-shaped roadway. The road was jammed most of the time last
August, but remains relatively easy to navigate this year.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout California, the number of residents who will travel
from today through Monday is expected to drop about 1% this year, to
4.63 million. An Auto Club spokeswoman, Marie Montgomery, said she
was surprised that car travel isn't rising this summer, considering
that gasoline prices have remained relatively steady for several
months.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things we have noticed is that there doesn't seem to
be a relationship between gas prices and travel by car," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, California posted higher gas prices than the rest of the
nation for the last week in August, according to a survey by the
Energy Information Administration. Prices for a gallon of regular
gasoline were $1.59 in California on Monday, compared with $1.52 in
New York state, $1.43 in Colorado and $1.31 in Texas, the report
found.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, the biggest decrease will come from air travel, which
is expected to drop 6% compared with last year, according to the Auto
Club's survey of travel agents.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of taking to the skies, vacationers planning short
jaunts--for example from Los Angeles to San Diego, or Santa Barbara
to Monterey Bay--are more often getting in their cars and driving,
said Jack Keady, a Playa del Rey-based aviation consultant.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, many travelers are fed up with security hassles at
airports and would rather forgo air travel for pleasure, even if they
must do so for business.</TE>
<TE>   "As people continue to go through the X-ray machines and continue
to get pulled aside for secondary screening or a full-body search, a
certain amount of resentment or rebellion builds up in them," Keady
said.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly onerous are secondary screenings at the gate and
requests by security personnel that passengers take off their shoes
and run them through X-ray machines, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Travel industry experts also warned people who are flying this
weekend to take particular notice of new airline rules that require
fees for more than two checked bags per person and for oversized
luggage.</TE>
<TE>   Travel by bus, boat and train this weekend is expected to increase
7% over last year. Contributing to this increase is the redirecting
of many cruise routes from the Mediterranean to Alaska and Mexico,
prompting more Americans to take cruises this summer, Montgomery
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's phenomenal how many more cruises we're booking because
they're cheaper and the cruise lines have to fill those cabins," she
added.</TE>
<TE>   For Southern Californians, the top travel destinations are
expected to be the Central California coast, San Diego, Las Vegas,
San Francisco and the Grand Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   For Southland motorists who plan to travel on the Golden State
Freeway, authorities caution that there will be traffic delays near
Magic Mountain in Santa Clarita because of roadway repairs that close
one lane in each direction.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Transportation suggests motorists use
The Old Road, which runs parallel to the freeway, as an alternate
route through Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers can check on road conditions at (800) 427-7623.</TE>

<LD>In California, 4.6 million public school students in grades 2 through
11 took the Stanford 9 standardized tests in the spring, for the
fifth year in a row.  All of them were tested in reading, math and
language skills such as grammar and punctuation.  Students through
eighth grade also took a spelling test, and students in higher grades
took exams in science and history/social science.</LD>
<LD>   Students also took tests tied to the state's tougher standards in
the same subjects, such as English and language arts.</LD>
<LD>   Readers who want to know how a school in Ventura County is doing
can use this cross section of scores as a gauge.  But bear in mind
that these are results for individual grades only, not the entire
school.  Scores can vary from grade to grade--and from classroom to
classroom--even at the same school.</LD>

<HD>County Students Top Norms</HD>
<DH>Education: While results on both national and state tests
surpass averages, pupils appeared less successful on the California
exam.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County students again scored above state and U.S. norms on
the yearly national Stanford 9 tests, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   But on the California Standards Test, viewed by some educators as
a more accurate reflection of school effectiveness, local students
appeared less successful. Still exceeding state averages, 39% of
Ventura County students on the state exam tested as proficient or
better in math; 41% reached that level in language arts.</LD>
<LD>   The results are encouraging but show that "we've got a ways to
go," county schools Supt. Charles Weis said.</LD>
<TE>   Generally buoyed by this year's round of test scores, local
educators pointed to their efforts at meeting recently instituted
state standards. They also credited smaller class sizes for a jump in
reading scores among elementary school students.</TE>
<TE>   Many echoed the comments of Mike Vollmert, testing coordinator for
the Conejo Valley schools.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no surprises," Vollmert said. "We expected incremental
increases and we got them."</TE>
<TE>   Last spring's tests were given to 106,753 Ventura County students
in grades 2 to 11. On the Stanford 9, they scored six points above
the state averages in math--the same margin posted annually since
1999. They were less accomplished in reading but still outdid the
state average by seven points.</TE>
<TE>   Oak Park, an affluent district in the east county, topped the
charts on Stanford 9 scores as well as on the California Standards
Test in math and language arts. Poorer districts with more
limited-English students, such as those in El Rio and Santa Paula,
hovered near the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   But the gap between rich and poor was less significant on the
state tests than the Stanford 9, said Weis, adding that the
2-year-old state testing system measures student performance more
accurately.</TE>
<TE>   At least 30% of the questions on the Stanford 9 tests fall outside
California's curriculum, Weis said. The California Standards Tests,
on the other hand, are designed to reflect the material teachers are
supposed to explore in California classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Schools that scrambled to meet the state standards fared better
than others despite being less affluent, Weis said, citing the
Camarillo area's Pleasant Valley Elementary School District and
Somis' tiny Mesa Union scoring in the same league as the more
affluent Oak Park and Conejo Valley districts.</TE>
<TE>   Critics contend many tests measure only the ability of students to
take the tests rather than their ability to learn. But some educators
believe teachers and students are helped by standards as specific as
those gauged by California's state tests.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful shift," Ventura Unified Supt. Trudy Arriaga
said. Once teachers know how proficiency is defined--even down to
fundamental tasks such as sounding out the beginning of a word or
counting to 100--they can nudge students toward it, she said.</TE>
<TE>   A Times analysis of the state's data showed the biggest Stanford 9
improvements in the county were logged by Briggs Elementary School in
Santa Paula and Portola Elementary School in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   At Briggs, students benefit from after-school tutoring, a homework
period during the day and an emphasis on the state standards, Briggs
School District Supt. Carol Vines said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done much more testing as we've gone along," Vines said.
"When we see children who haven't achieved skills, we've backed up
and done it again instead of just moving forward."</TE>
<TE>   At Portola, just 35% of the students met the national norm on the
Stanford 9 in 1998. Last year that figure more than doubled, to 77%.</TE>
<TE>   Teresa Johnson, the principal at the 550-student school, said some
of her teachers work an extra hour a day with students who are
lagging. To better focus classroom work, she said, teachers have been
trained in a set of techniques called "blackboard configuration,"
which lets children know what they will be learning in the session to
come.</TE>
<TE>   "We're dedicated to teaching to the standards," Johnson said.
"We're very focused."</TE>
<TE>   A feeling of safety on campus also has contributed to the dramatic
increase in test scores. Portola's conflict-resolution program has
eased disputes among students, making it easier for them to learn,
Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the spectrum, students at Santa Paula High
School were among the county's low scorers, despite a boost over last
year's showing.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we're not pleased," Santa Paula Union High District
Supt. Bill Brand said. "We'd love to be up in the median range for
the county. But, in small steps, we're moving upward."</TE>
<TE>   Brand said the high school hit its target scores in the most
recent round of tests. He said teachers began intense remedial
classes during the school year and over the summer, and that
administrators are working more closely with their counterparts in
Santa Paula's elementary and middle schools, trying to improve
student achievement all around.</TE>
<TE>   "We're attacking it," Brand said. "Together we can make this thing
work."</TE>

<HD>Senate OKs Bill to Block Wal-Mart's Bid for Bank</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A last-minute bill to prohibit discount giant Wal-Mart from acquiring
a small industrial bank that could save it millions of dollars sailed
through the Senate on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The action raised some of the same issues as a so-called "big box"
bill that suddenly emerged in the final days of the legislative
session three years ago and threatened to put California off-limits
to expansion of such mega-stores as Costco and Wal-Mart, the world's
biggest retailer.</LD>
<LD>   That bill, sponsored by organized labor, was rushed through the
Legislature by majority Democrats without normal public hearings and
scrutiny. Gov. Gray Davis vetoed it, calling the bill anti-business
and an example of the "worst kind of end-of-session maneuvering by
special interests."</LD>
<TE>   The latest bill, also backed by labor--AB 551 by Assemblyman Lou
Papan (D-Millbrae)--would forbid Wal-Mart from buying the Franklin
Bank in Orange, which would enable the company to reduce its
processing costs for debit-card payments.</TE>
<TE>   As its own bank, the retailer could tap customer checking accounts
for payments. Now, it must pay a fee on debit-card transactions to
the bank that sponsors its access to the network.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the bill said federal law prohibits businesses from
acquiring such banks unless they already are providing financial
services such as lending, investing and exchanging and transferring
money.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Garden Grove) said the bill would plug a
"loophole" in California law that supporters asserted would allow the
acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart branded the bill an unfair intrusion by the Legislature
into a business transaction that was legal and advancing toward
approval by government regulators. Its officials denounced the
legislation as "punitive," warning it would result in the loss of
jobs, harm consumers and reduce competition.</TE>
<TE>   Among the chief backers were the Council of the United Food and
Commercial Workers and the Teamsters. Organized labor long has been a
foe of Wal-Mart because it is a nonunion employer.</TE>

<HD>Westin Probe Is Dragging, Trustee Says</HD>
<DH>Colleges: John Tallman insists colleagues aren't moving
fast enough on inquiry into suspended chancellor. Members rebut the
accusations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura County Community College District trustee accused his
colleagues Thursday of dragging their feet on an investigation into
allegations of malfeasance and misappropriation of public funds by
suspended Chancellor Philip Westin.</LD>
<LD>   The five elected trustees hired Los Angeles attorney Mary Dowell
on July 25 to conduct an investigation and advise them on how to
proceed against Westin, who has been harshly criticized for spending
$119,000 in taxpayer money since 1998 on expensive meals, software
equipment and car repairs.</LD>
<LD>   He was placed on paid administrative leave July 18 for an
indefinite period to give Dowell time to review his spending, along
with allegations of possible criminal violations contained in a
lawsuit filed in Ventura County Superior Court on behalf of
taxpayers.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, nothing has occurred, according to trustee John
Tallman, a longtime Westin critic.</TE>
<TE>   "We have yet to interview a person and locate a document," Tallman
said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Tallman said a majority of the board does not want a thorough
investigation conducted. Board President Norman Nagel and Vice
President Art Hernandez comprise a two-member subcommittee that
usually communicates with Dowell, of the law firm Liebert Cassidy
Whitmore, Tallman said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not her [Dowell's] fault," Tallman said. "I would say the
firm would do whatever the board asked."</TE>
<TE>   Dowell has communicated with the board in person and in writing,
Tallman said, but he would not divulge the nature of those
discussions. Dowell was retained by the board because some trustees
believe the district's general counsel, Jack Lipton, has developed
too close a relationship with Westin to be impartial.</TE>
<TE>   Dowell was on vacation and unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the other board members disputed Tallman's viewpoint.</TE>
<TE>   "We have hired a law firm and they're looking into the matter with
Westin," trustee Bob Gonzales said Thursday. "It's my belief an
investigation is being conducted."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, there's an investigation," trustee Hernandez said. "It's not
going as quickly as we'd like, but it's moving forward. We're trying
to do as complete and thorough a job as we can, so that if we go to
court, it holds up. You're going to see that things are going to move
a lot quicker now."</TE>
<TE>   Nagel said Dowell is reviewing the taxpayer lawsuit and an
analysis of Westin's expenses presented to the board last spring. by
the Camarillo law firm Wood &amp; Bender. Nagel said he does not believe
the attorney had begun to interview employees or possible witnesses
about the allegations contained in the taxpayer lawsuit, such as
Westin reportedly allowing the district to apply for a FEMA grant
when there wasn't an emergency.</TE>
<TE>   "To the best of my knowledge, they haven't talked to anyone,"
Nagel said.</TE>
<TE>   The board met privately for an hour Thursday to discuss a threat
Westin made Aug. 15 to file a lawsuit if the board did not resolve
his employment status quickly. The board did not reach a decision nor
take any action.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there was some progress," Tallman said.</TE>
<TE>   Acting Chancellor Jim Walker said Westin had threatened to sue the
district during a face-to-face meeting in his office two weeks ago.
"Phil Westin stated that he would proceed with litigation if the
Board did not resolve his issues soon," Walker wrote in a
one-sentence memo that prompted Thursday's special meeting.</TE>
<TE>   During the public comment period held before the trustees
adjourned to closed session, several residents told the board they
were fed up with the secrecy surrounding Westin's employment status
and did not want the board considering a plan to settle with Westin
by buying out his $203,000-a-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   "Why hasn't the board provided information about the
investigation?" said Earline Randall of Santa Paula. "I think the
board is caving in to Westin. Let him sue."</TE>
<TE>   "He's nothing but a bully," said Thousand Oaks resident Linda Van
Dolsen, who is running for a seat on the board in November to replace
Nagel. "If lack of integrity were a crime, he [Westin] would have
been put away a long time ago. If he wants to sue, fine."</TE>
<TE>   Westin has notified the board he would agree to resign if he
receives 18 months' salary, or $305,000, and lifetime health
benefits, among other concessions. He also wants to be allowed to
look for another job while retaining the title of chancellor during
that period.</TE>
<TE>   Some trustees have speculated it would be less expensive to buy
out Westin's two-year contract than face possible litigation if they
fired him. Under his contract, the board can fire him for breaking
the law or violating district policy.</TE>
<TE>   The law firm that filed the lawsuit on behalf of county taxpayers
contends Westin's contract should be rescinded because it was
approved in May in violation of the state's open meetings law, known
as the Brown Act.</TE>
<TE>   The board is accused of failing to properly notify the public that
trustees planned to consider increasing Westin's salary in a closed
meeting.</TE>

<LD>Cathedral doors--A graphic Wednesday in Section A and the
"Surroundings" story Thursday in the California section gave
inconsistent and incorrect information about the weight of the main
doors at the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. The Great
Bronze Doors comprise the doors themselves, which weigh about 7 tons
apiece, plus the crowning tympanum structure and statue of Mary. The
combined weight of the entire piece is about 25 tons. In addition,
the story Wednesday that the graphic accompanied gave misleading
information about the dimensions of the nave's series of tapestries.
They are 20 feet tall.</LD>

<LD>In California, 4.6 million public school students in grades two through 11
took the Stanford 9 standardized tests this spring--for the fifth year in
a row. All of them were tested in reading, math and language skills such
as grammar and punctuation. Students through eighth grade also took a
spelling test, and students in higher grades took exams in science and
history/social science.</LD>
<LD>   Students also took tests tied to the state's tougher standards in
the same subjects, such as English and language arts. Readers who want to
know how a school in Los Angeles County is doing can use this
cross-section of scores as a gauge. But bear in mind that
these are results for selected grades only, not the entire school.
Scores can vary from grade to grade--and from classroom to classroom--even
at the same school.</LD>
<LD>   Results for all grades, schools and districts are available on the
Internet at http://www.cde.ca.gov.</LD>
<TE>   HOW TO READ THE SCORES:</TE>

<LD>In California, 4.6 million public school students in grades two through 11
took the Stanford 9 standardized tests this spring--for the fifth year in
a row. All of them were tested in reading, math and language skills such
as grammar and punctuation. Students through eighth grade also took a
spelling test, and students in higher grades took exams in science and
history/social science.</LD>
<LD>   Students also took tests tied to the state's tougher standards in
the same subjects, such as English and language arts. Readers who want to
know how a school in Los Angeles County is doing can use this
cross-section of scores as a gauge. But bear in mind that
these are results for selected grades only, not the entire school.
Scores can vary from grade to grade--and from classroom to classroom--even
at the same school.</LD>
<LD>   Results for all grades, schools and districts are available on the
Internet at http://www.cde.ca.gov.</LD>
<TE>   HOW TO READ THE SCORES:</TE>

schools, grade 8 for middle schools and grade 10 for high schools.</TE>

<LD>In California, 4.6 million public school students in grades two through 11
took the Stanford 9 standardized tests this spring--for the fifth year in
a row. All of them were tested in reading, math and language skills such
as grammar and punctuation. Students through eighth grade also took a
spelling test, and students in higher grades took exams in science and
history/social science.</LD>
<LD>   Students also took tests tied to the state's tougher standards in
the same subjects, such as English and language arts. Readers who want to
know how a school in Los Angeles County is doing can use this
cross-section of scores as a gauge. But bear in mind that
these are results for selected grades only, not the entire school.
Scores can vary from grade to grade--and from classroom to classroom--even
at the same school.</LD>
<LD>   Results for all grades, schools and districts are available on the
Internet at http://www.cde.ca.gov.</LD>
<TE>   HOW TO READ THE SCORES:</TE>

schools, grade 8 for middle schools and grade 10 for high schools.</TE>
<TE>   Individual Schools</TE>

scores for individual schools (listed alphabetically).</TE>

<LD>In California, 4.6 million public school students in grades two through 11
took the Stanford 9 standardized tests this spring--for the fifth year in
a row. All of them were tested in reading, math and language skills such
as grammar and punctuation. Students through eighth grade also took a
spelling test, and students in higher grades took exams in science and
history/social science.</LD>
<LD>   Students also took tests tied to the state's tougher standards in
the same subjects, such as English and language arts. Readers who want to
know how a school in Los Angeles County is doing can use this
cross-section of scores as a gauge. But bear in mind that
these are results for selected grades only, not the entire school.
Scores can vary from grade to grade--and from classroom to classroom--even
at the same school.</LD>
<LD>   Results for all grades, schools and districts are available on the
Internet at http://www.cde.ca.gov.</LD>
<TE>   HOW TO READ THE SCORES:</TE>

schools, grade 8 for middle schools and grade 10 for high schools.</TE>

<LD>In California, 4.6 million public school students in grades two through 11
took the Stanford 9 standardized tests this spring--for the fifth year in
a row. All of them were tested in reading, math and language skills such
as grammar and punctuation. Students through eighth grade also took a
spelling test, and students in higher grades took exams in science and
history/social science.</LD>
<LD>   Students also took tests tied to the state's tougher standards in
the same subjects, such as English and language arts. Readers who want to
know how a school in Los Angeles County is doing can use this
cross-section of scores as a gauge. But bear in mind that
these are results for selected grades only, not the entire school.
Scores can vary from grade to grade--and from classroom to classroom--even
at the same school.</LD>
<LD>   Results for all grades, schools and districts are available on the
Internet at http://www.cde.ca.gov.</LD>
<TE>   HOW TO READ THE SCORES:</TE>

schools, grade 8 for middle schools and grade 10 for high schools.</TE>

<LD>In California, 4.6 million public school students in grades two through 11
took the Stanford 9 standardized tests this spring--for the fifth year in
a row. All of them were tested in reading, math and language skills such
as grammar and punctuation. Students through eighth grade also took a
spelling test, and students in higher grades took exams in science and
history/social science.</LD>
<LD>   Students also took tests tied to the state's tougher standards in
the same subjects, such as English and language arts. Readers who want to
know how a school in Los Angeles County is doing can use this
cross-section of scores as a gauge. But bear in mind that
these are results for selected grades only, not the entire school.
Scores can vary from grade to grade--and from classroom to classroom--even
at the same school.</LD>
<LD>   Results for all grades, schools and districts are available on the
Internet at http://www.cde.ca.gov.</LD>
<TE>   HOW TO READ THE SCORES:</TE>

schools, grade 8 for middle schools and grade 10 for high schools.</TE>

<LD>In California, 4.6 million public school students in grades two through 11
took the Stanford 9 standardized tests this spring--for the fifth year in
a row. All of them were tested in reading, math and language skills such
as grammar and punctuation. Students through eighth grade also took a
spelling test, and students in higher grades took exams in science and
history/social science.</LD>
<LD>   Students also took tests tied to the state's tougher standards in
the same subjects, such as English and language arts. Readers who want to
know how a school in Los Angeles County is doing can use this
cross-section of scores as a gauge. But bear in mind that
these are results for selected grades only, not the entire school.
Scores can vary from grade to grade--and from classroom to classroom--even
at the same school.</LD>
<LD>   Results for all grades, schools and districts are available on the
Internet at http://www.cde.ca.gov.</LD>
<TE>   HOW TO READ THE SCORES:</TE>

<LD>In California, 4.6 million public school students in grades two through 11
took the Stanford 9 standardized tests this spring--for the fifth year in
a row. All of them were tested in reading, math and language skills such
as grammar and punctuation. Students through eighth grade also took a
spelling test, and students in higher grades took exams in science and
history/social science.</LD>
<LD>   Students also took tests tied to the state's tougher standards in
the same subjects, such as English and language arts. Readers who want to
know how a school in Los Angeles County is doing can use this
cross-section of scores as a gauge. But bear in mind that
these are results for selected grades only, not the entire school.
Scores can vary from grade to grade--and from classroom to classroom--even
at the same school.</LD>
<LD>   Results for all grades, schools and districts are available on the
Internet at http://www.cde.ca.gov.</LD>

<LD>In California, 4.6 million public school students in grades two through 11
took the Stanford 9 standardized tests this spring--for the fifth year in
a row. All of them were tested in reading, math and language skills such
as grammar and punctuation. Students through eighth grade also took a
spelling test, and students in higher grades took exams in science and
history/social science.</LD>
<LD>   Students also took tests tied to the state's tougher standards in
the same subjects, such as English and language arts. Readers who want to
know how a school in Los Angeles County is doing can use this
cross-section of scores as a gauge. But bear in mind that
these are results for selected grades only, not the entire school.
Scores can vary from grade to grade--and from classroom to classroom--even
at the same school.</LD>
<LD>   Results for all grades, schools and districts are available on the
Internet at http://www.cde.ca.gov.</LD>

<LD>In California, 4.6 million public school students in grades two through 11
took the Stanford 9 standardized tests this spring--for the fifth year in
a row. All of them were tested in reading, math and language skills such
as grammar and punctuation. Students through eighth grade also took a
spelling test, and students in higher grades took exams in science and
history/social science.</LD>
<LD>   Students also took tests tied to the state's tougher standards in
the same subjects, such as English and language arts. Readers who want to
know how a school in Los Angeles County is doing can use this
cross-section of scores as a gauge. But bear in mind that
these are results for selected grades only, not the entire school.
Scores can vary from grade to grade--and from classroom to classroom--even
at the same school.</LD>
<LD>   Results for all grades, schools and districts are available on the
Internet at http://www.cde.ca.gov.</LD>
<TE>   HOW TO READ THE SCORES:</TE>
<TE>   School Districts</TE>
<TE>   Listed in alphabetical order by grade, with grade 4 for elementary
schools, grade 8 for middle schools and grade 10 for high schools.</TE>
<TE>   Individual Schools</TE>
<TE>   The average score for the district is listed first, followed by
scores for individual schools (listed alphabetically).</TE>
<TE>   Reading 2002</TE>
<TE>   Percentage of students scoring at or above the national average. A
50 means that half the school's students were at or above the
national average.</TE>

<LD>In California, 4.6 million public school students in grades two through 11
took the Stanford 9 standardized tests this spring--for the fifth year in
a row. All of them were tested in reading, math and language skills such
as grammar and punctuation. Students through eighth grade also took a
spelling test, and students in higher grades took exams in science and
history/social science.</LD>
<LD>   Students also took tests tied to the state's tougher standards in
the same subjects, such as English and language arts. Readers who want to
know how a school in Los Angeles County is doing can use this
cross-section of scores as a gauge. But bear in mind that
these are results for selected grades only, not the entire school.
Scores can vary from grade to grade--and from classroom to classroom--even
at the same school.</LD>
<LD>   Results for all grades, schools and districts are available on the
Internet at http://www.cde.ca.gov.</LD>
<TE>   HOW TO READ THE SCORES:</TE>

<HD>When the Music Starts, Who Will Be Left Sitting?</HD>
<DH>Disney Hall: Seniority, money and volunteer work will
determine the seating chart next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first notes won't sound in its new home for another year, but
listeners and management at the Los Angeles Philharmonic have already
begun an epic game of musical chairs, one that begins amid the 3,086
seats in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and will end across the street
on Grand Avenue, amid the 2,265 seats of the Walt Disney Concert
Hall.</LD>
<LD>   For management, the goal is to use the steel-skinned, wavy-walled
venue to woo new subscribers and motivate the old before October,
when the orchestra begins its final season in the 38-year-old Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion. Under this strategy--which has already boosted
subscription sales 23% above last year's figure--the orchestra's
marketers have told subscribers that extra donations will get them
better seats and hinted that dawdling could leave them seatless.</LD>
<LD>   "It doesn't make me too happy, because I'm a good proletarian,"
said Natalie Limonick, a longtime subscriber and former USC music
professor who teaches voice and piano. Still, Limonick said, "they're
doing what they have to do. Money, money, money rules the world."</LD>
<TE>   As Limonick and others note, the task of appeasing 27,000
priority-seeking subscription-holders in clout-conscious Los Angeles
stands as a challenge in human engineering to rival the mathematics
behind architect Frank Gehry's tilting, soaring wall panels.</TE>
<TE>   The new hall, which carries a projected $274-million price tag, is
scheduled to open in fall 2003. "The only way to assure a seat," the
Philharmonic marketing staff wrote subscribers in a recent
promotional mailing, is to sign on for season seats in the old hall
this year. Furthermore, the Philharmonic's letter noted, every gift
"made by Sept. 1, 2002, counts toward subscriber seating priority."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Labor Day, marketing director Joan Cumming said,
current subscribers will get mailers with seating maps and ticket
prices (they're expected to rise in most cases) for Disney Hall.
They'll be asked to indicate their first, second and third choice
among sections, but they can't earmark specific seats.</TE>
<TE>   When the responses come back, Cumming said, the Philharmonic will
match subscribers with specific seats.</TE>
<TE>   For the box office staffers making those assignments, Philharmonic
officials say, the foremost questions will be: How long has this
person been a subscriber, and where is the subscriber's current seat?
The second set of questions: If this person is a donor, how far back
does the giving go, and how big have the checks been? Third: Does
this person have a history of volunteer work for the Philharmonic?</TE>
<TE>   The Philharmonic's Web site elaborates on this philosophy, but
spokeswoman Elizabeth Hinckley declined to disclose details of the
process. For instance: Who gets priority between a 15-year subscriber
who has donated nothing and a five-year subscriber who has donated
$10,000?</TE>
<TE>   "It's proprietary information," said Hinckley, adding that the
largest donors and longest subscribers are frequently the same
people.</TE>
<TE>   Jacquie Blew, a 38-year subscriber, said: "You can buy your way
in. Let's be honest about it. It's a little bit off-putting." But
Blew, who worked for the Philharmonic for 11 years before taking her
current position as box office associate with the Los Angeles Chamber
Orchestra, agrees that the Philharmonic's focus on donations is
inevitable, because ticket sales alone seldom cover the costs of
classical programming. Figuring out whom to seat where in the new
hall, she said, "must be the biggest headache in the world."</TE>
<TE>   The transition is in many ways an apples-to-oranges affair. The
old hall holds 3,086 seats in a traditional four-level concert hall
arrangement, and the costliest, most coveted seats are those in the
Founders Circle, where an eight-concert subscription in 2002-03 costs
$656 per seat.</TE>
<TE>   The new hall's 2,265 seats are also arranged in four levels, but
the hall's 10 sections circle the orchestra platform, putting some
seats behind the musicians but quite close to them. In fact, the
farthest seat from the stage is about 120 feet away--much closer than
in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really hard for someone to think, 'I've been sitting in the
loge for 25 years. Where's the loge?' There is no loge. It doesn't
translate," Cumming said.</TE>
<TE>   The reseating game is still in its early stages, but the demand
for seats has been growing for more than a year. In 2000-01, the
orchestra counted 19,000 subscribers (that is, concertgoers who
bought packages in advance for three to eight performances during the
season). That figure grew, Cumming said, to about 22,000 for the
2001-02 season. With several weeks of sales left before the Oct. 3
season opening, Cumming said, the 2002-03 subscription figure has
reached 27,000.</TE>
<TE>   However, there still seems to be plenty of room. Through the
2001-02 season, Cumming said the Philharmonic's average attendance
"hovered around 1,900 people per concert," which left about 1,180
empty seats in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and would have left
about 360 empty seats in the new hall--room for demand to grow.</TE>
<TE>   And supply is growing as well. The orchestra's subscription
schedule in 2002-03 includes 89 performances (covering 29 programs).
With the move into Disney Hall, Cumming said, the performance count
will grow to more than 100. The result, Cumming said, is that "there
should be plenty of room available" in the new hall.</TE>
<TE>   But subscribers and other music fans nevertheless face daunting
variables themselves, from what section to seek in an unknown hall to
how much they're willing to pay.</TE>
<TE>   Ticket prices, now $33 to $82 per performance for subscribers, may
fall for some, depending on their section choice, but will rise
overall. Cumming said that the new prices were decided after
focus-group research in the spring. They will be revealed when
subscribers get their mailings in the next few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Given the Philharmonic's history with subscribers, those weeks
stand to be anxious ones. Twenty years ago, when conductor Carlo
Maria Giulini wanted to extend the stage into the audience to improve
sound and heighten immediacy, audience members rebelled and
management backed down. The orchestra went through a similar
experiment and retreat in 1995. Finally, in 1999, the orchestra
crafted a stage extension that affected 480 seats and won enough
support to survive challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Felsher, a Tarzana resident who has subscribed to the
Philharmonic for more than 20 years, has been complaining since 1998
about the "extortionate" way the Philharmonic has invoked Disney Hall
to encourage donations. Despite the organization's public statements
that subscriber tenure is its most heavily weighted criterion in seat
assignments, Felsher says he doesn't believe it. If the orchestra
would just come out and say that money matters most, he said, "then
we would all know where we stand."</TE>
<TE>   Aiming to calm such anxieties, Philharmonic management plans in
September to start calling every subscriber household--an estimated
11,000 of them--to answer questions. During the 2002-03 season,
meanwhile, concertgoers will find information tables in the Chandler
lobby, Internet prowlers will find increased information on the
Philharmonic's Web site and a subscriber reseating hotline will be
established. Subscription renewal packages for 2003-04 will probably
be sent out by late November.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of March 2003, Cumming said, seat assignments for
returning subscribers in the new hall should be made. In April 2003,
first-time subscribers will get their first chance. Single-ticket
sales for the 2003-04 season will open in September 2003.</TE>
<TE>   For William Vance Smith Jr., a retired postal worker from Hancock
Park who has subscribed on and off for 38 years, the worst anxiety
has passed. Several years ago, when he started hearing about the new
hall, he said, "I got paranoid. My name is not Chandler." But since
then, Philharmonic representatives have reassured him that his
front-row mezzanine subscription seat, along with his donation of
$1,500 to Disney Hall in the late 1990s, will guarantee him a
satisfactory spot.</TE>
<TE>   In assembling the reseating strategy, the Philharmonic studied
orchestras in Chicago, Seattle, Cleveland and Philadelphia, all of
which moved into new or drastically renovated venues since 1997. The
most recent of those was the Philadelphia Orchestra's move last
December, when it left its longtime home in that city's Academy of
Music and took up residence in Verizon Hall in the Kimmel Center for
the Performing Arts.</TE>
<TE>   There, despite a boost in top prices from $94 to $110 per seat and
a dip of available seating from 2,800 to 2,500, total paid attendance
for the season rose 7%, filling 99% of the new hall's seats.</TE>
<TE>   As officials in Los Angeles are doing, the Philadelphia Orchestra
promoted the last season in its old venue as a chance to grab prime
spots in the new one, and called subscribers to prep them for coming
changes.</TE>
<TE>   Orchestra officials also told subscribers, in a delicately worded
holiday communique, that not only subscription histories but
donations and volunteer time would be considered when seats in the
new facility were assigned.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Los Angeles, the Philadelphia Orchestra started by making a
specific seat recommendation to each subscriber--recommendations that
95% of subscribers ultimately accepted, said Judith Kurnick, the
Philadelphia Orchestra's vice president of communications and public
affairs. But before those subscribers made peace with their new
places, they lighted up the orchestra's phone lines. Many callers,
frequently older subscribers, asked about the height of railings, the
number and steepness of steps, the locations of bathrooms and
elevators.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing we would probably do different is put more people
on the telephones for the first couple of weeks after tickets were
received," Kurnick said.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Philharmonic officials say they've already made
plans to boost their phone staff and have resolved not to steer
subscribers toward specific seats, because the definition of "a good
seat" is elastic, depending on the listener.</TE>
