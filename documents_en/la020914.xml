<LD>Any street-corner agitator can spout the old saw about the personal
being political. Joan Holden's mission of the moment is to fuse them
vividly on stage.</LD>
<LD>   Since January, the veteran playwright has struggled to transform
Barbara Ehrenreich's "Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in
America," a political broadside that has been a nonfiction
bestseller, into a dramatic personal tale. It opens Thursday at the
Mark Taper Forum.</LD>
<LD>   At 63, Holden probably has more experience writing political plays
than anybody else in the United States. From 1967 to 2000, she was
principal playwright of the San Francisco Mime Troupe, a noted
ensemble that has used farce and satire (but, despite its name, not
mime) to advance an unabashedly liberal political agenda. The
ensemble won a Tony in 1987 for excellence in regional theater.</LD>
<TE>   Holden has been around long enough to know the dramatic equivalent
of a growling grizzly when she sees one. And that's what she
encountered in Ehrenreich's pages.</TE>
<TE>   For three monthlong stretches during the late 1990s and 2000, the
essayist, book author and magazine writer worked an assortment of
$7-an-hour jobs in Key West, Fla.; Portland, Maine; and
Minneapolis--just to see whether she could keep herself housed and
fed on near-minimum wages. The much-praised book documented the daily
struggles and slights Ehrenreich and her co-workers endured as
waitresses, housecleaners and clerks.</TE>
<TE>   Bartlett Sher, artistic director of Seattle's Intiman Theatre,
heard Ehrenreich on public radio and was astonished at her book's
conclusion: Those who cook, serve and scrub for working-poor wages
are "the major philanthropists of our society," giving their
underpaid sweat and their uninsured health so that businesses can
reap fatter profits and well-off families can enjoy cheaper
amenities.</TE>
<TE>   Sher figured that what jolted him could hit home with theater
audiences. He had not met Holden, but as a kid in San Francisco he
had been provoked to thought and laughter by such Mime Troupe salvos
as "Ripped Van Winkle," about a hippie who awakens from a 20-year
acid trip to find that Gov. Ronald Reagan has become President
Reagan, and "Factwino vs. Armaggedonman," one in a trilogy of plays
about an alcoholic bum who seizes on hard, factual political
information as the way to de-opiate himself and the masses. "Nickel
and Dimed," Sher concluded, was a job for Holden.</TE>
<TE>   Holden read the book after Sher called. She loved it but harbored
no illusions about what a bear it would be to turn into a play.
Ehrenreich wrote as a professional observer, a scientist testing a
hypothesis. It was not the story of an individual being shaped and
changed by life's uncontrollable onslaught, the stuff of comedy and
drama.</TE>
<TE>   "She did not write a book about herself, and a play has to be
about somebody," Holden, a small, self-contained woman with a
pleasant but firm manner, said during an interview between
rehearsals. "So the struggle has been to give her an inner story."</TE>
<TE>   Willy Loman can't just step into more a forgiving life when his
bills grow insurmountable and his bosses intractable. Ehrenreich
could, and she did.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Holden thought she was through with playwriting
jobs. She quit the San Francisco Mime Troupe "in a huff," she says,
not because of any deep-rooted grievances, but "because I had to get
mad at somebody to propel myself out the door."</TE>
<TE>   Mime Troupe plays, often written with other company members, had
to fit a certain format: geared to the politics of the day and broad
enough to play well in the parks where the ensemble performs each
summer. Holden needed a change.</TE>
<TE>   She worked as a political organizer in San Francisco, giving
speeches, writing campaign literature and going door to door in an
initiative drive to stop developers from gentrifying poor
neighborhoods. The campaign ultimately led to a less
developer-friendly majority on the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors, Holden says. "I thought for a while, 'This is fun; this
is what I'm going to do for the rest of my life.' But actually it
turned out to be too much like theater: big egos and impossible
deadlines."</TE>
<TE>   Last year she adapted Moliere's "The Imaginary Invalid" at the
request of a director friend at Denver University. Then came "Nickel
and Dimed," an assignment she thought too important to pass up.</TE>
<TE>   Time was tight, and Holden figures she accomplished only 80% of
what she wanted by last month's opening at the Intiman. The critics
were not impressed. "Nickel and Dimed" took a panning from the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer ("a predictable dirge ... shrill and
desperate"), elicited measured disappointment from the Seattle Times
("we don't get to know Barbara much. Her struggle isn't
suspenseful....") and received encouragement--but not exactly
praise--from Variety ("Now it's up to the play's rewrite team to
render people and events that are as powerful as this idea").</TE>
<TE>   But audiences were galvanized, Sher says. Attendance ran at 95% in
the 446-seat Intiman, well above the theater's average draw of 80% to
85% of capacity.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to be part of the conversation around this," said
Sher, who is directing the same cast at the Taper. "The piece is
about the middle class as much as the working poor; it's about our
audience," which, he says, for regional theaters typically averages
more than $90,000 in annual household income.</TE>
<TE>   The Taper's artistic director, Gordon Davidson, seized upon
"Nickel and Dimed" after Tony Kushner decided to rework his
"Homebody/Kabul," which had been announced as the theater's
season-opening play.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson wanted a replacement that, like Kushner's drama about
Afghanistan, would be "something of some scale and depth and content.
But I didn't have anything in my pipeline."</TE>
<TE>   "Nickel and Dimed" became "the leading candidate, in principle,"
after Davidson read the script. Seeing its Seattle opening confirmed
for him that it deserved the slot. That bought Holden another chance
to ponder the character of Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   She already has made the real Ehrenreich quite happy (the two
writers' undergraduate careers at Reed College in Portland, Ore.,
overlapped during the 1959-60 school year, but they did not know each
other).</TE>
<TE>   "Watching somebody play the part of myself--or somebody like me,
anyway--was quite unnerving for the first 15 minutes," Ehrenreich
said. "And then I forgot about that and was marvelously entertained."</TE>
<TE>   Ehrenreich has made suggestions but gave the dramatist a free
hand: "I know it's not my product anymore; it's Joan's. I expect it
to be fictionalized and changed. I liked the script, and I liked
seeing it even better."</TE>
<TE>   She is more apprehensive about a prospective Hollywood version of
"Nickel and Dimed." Ehrenreich said that she has sold the film rights
to her book and that the first movie treatment introduced a baldly
fictional love interest for her character.</TE>
<TE>   Holden acquired a family during her years with the San Francisco
Mime Troupe. She and one of its leading directors, Dan Chumley, have
been domestic partners since the late 1960s and have three grown
daughters. The middle one, Sophia Chumley, is a waitress who helped
with the restaurant lingo featured in the opening scene of "Nickel
and Dimed."</TE>
<TE>   Holden says she doesn't mind that her work helped make the Mime
Troupe's name while her own remains obscure to the general playgoing
public. "The company is famous, and the individuals in it aren't.
That's not a choice I'd change, because it was a great way to work
for a long, long, long time."</TE>
<TE>   She thinks her political plays sometimes have helped bring about
change, not by themselves, but as voices among multitudes pushing the
same causes. But "Nickel and Dimed" may be different, she says.</TE>
<TE>   She regards Ehrenreich's book as the kind of work that might
single-handedly transform the way a culture looks at itself. And
while she struggles to raise the dramatic stakes for the play's
Barbara, Holden has no trouble identifying what's at stake in the
play's success or failure.</TE>
<TE>   She wants it to be produced across America, focusing and
intensifying a national conversation about the morality of exacting
people's labor without paying them a living wage.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a huge responsibility," Holden says. "I can't do a bad job
with this because it's such an opportunity. If it isn't picked up and
done more, I'll feel bad, because the book and the issue deserve that
circulation."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On a night that unofficially marked the start of the fall television
season, two wrestlers on the precipice of a same-sex marriage earned
UPN's wrestling show "Smackdown!" an average 6.2 million viewers
Thursday night, the show's highest ratings since April.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, over on the WB, the premiere of the first new series of
the fall, "Family Affair," a remake of the 1960s sitcom, drew an
average 4.6 million viewers.</LD>
<LD>   Both "Smackdown" and "Family Affair" air Thursday nights at 8, so
their competition will get tougher when new episodes of NBC's
"Friends" and CBS' "Survivor" begin.</LD>
<TE>   The "Smackdown!" episode featured wrestlers Billy and Chuck about
to exchange vows, at which point--shockingly--the event was revealed
as a publicity stunt and a fight broke out.</TE>
<TE>   More new series begin next week, although the season doesn't
officially begin until Sept. 23.</TE>

<HD>Georgian State Troupe Gives Women Equal Time at Last</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER FISHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When they dance, the Georgians show just about the finest combination
of force and finesse around. As seen Thursday at Pepperdine
University in Malibu, the men of the Georgian State Dance Company can
glide on their toes when they aren't swashbuckling or flying like
eagles before landing on their shins. They lunge, jab, twist, turn,
often at the speed of light, always with pristine technique and
upright elegance.</LD>
<LD>   The women, however, used to live in a graceful ghetto, always
seeming to skim and float in severely glamorous white dresses. They
were the something worth swashbuckling for. Not that this can't be
stunningly effective, as in staple ensemble dances such as
"Davluri-Sadarbazo," "Kartuli" and "Simd."</LD>
<LD>   But, wonder of wonders, someone has discovered that women can be
forceful too, presumably director and choreographer Tengiz
Sukhishvili and chief choreographer Iliko Sukhishvili Jr., son and
grandson of company founders Iliko Sukhishvili and Nino Ramishvili.</LD>
<TE>   New dances saw the women branch out, becoming stern in "Samani,"
their still-filigreed arm movements and long, ice-blue tunics
balanced by small kicks, leaps and raised fists. In "Uchkhresti,"
they rattled hand-held wooden instruments, while threading through
the swiftly moving geometric formations the company is known for.</TE>
<TE>   The men, of course, still had their day--it's hard to beat the
thrilling stylized sword fights and show-off solos, but the women may
develop their own tricks in time. They already had some intricate
allegro steps and incipient warrior personalities.</TE>
<TE>   Onstage musicians provided an especially driving musical pulse in
their only solo number, "Georgian Rhythms." It sounded like Tbilisi
may have an Afro-Cuban quarter, another indication that the company
moves with the times.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anouar Brahem has a well-deserved reputation as a genre-slipping
musical shape-shifter. Although the Tunisian artist is a trained
master of classical oud playing, he has collaborated with French jazz
musicians, practitioners of classical Indian music and such major
jazz artists as bassist Dave Holland and saxophonist Jan Garbarek.</LD>
<LD>   So the expectation for his trio's performance at the Skirball
Cultural Center Thursday night, in the opening event of the venue's
Mediterranean Odyssey Concert Series, was that he would offer a
substantial opportunity to experience his musical eclecticism.</LD>
<LD>   But that's not quite how things turned out. Performing with two
longtime musical companions, clarinetist Barbaros Erkose and
percussionist Lassad Hosni, Brahem concentrated on a series of gently
subtle, dynamically laid-back original compositions.</LD>
<TE>   Many can be traced to his ECM albums "Astrakan Cafe" and "Le Pas
du Chat Noir," and most featured Brahem's lyrical oud work. The
exceptions were the occasional passages in which Erkose had the
opportunity to stretch out in improvisations and the less frequent
segments featuring Hosni's startling manipulation of the bendir
(frame drum) and darbouka (Middle Eastern hand drum).</TE>
<TE>   Although Brahem didn't display the sort of stylistic versatility
he has elsewhere, what he did have to offer was equally intriguing:
music with improvisational invention and pulsing rhythms, positioned
in meditative settings.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when cultural confrontation and separatism seem to be
the political order of the day, it was a pleasure to experience a
performance in which differences in manner and heritage were
transformed into the creative resources for an engaging,
beyond-boundaries artistic expression.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A spirited young Puerto Rican girl moves to Brooklyn, where
"Hispanic" as a one-size-fits-all label is just one more unexpected
barrier to overcome in her determined struggle to find herself, in
PBS' warm and unaffected adaptation of Esmeralda Santiago's
coming-of-age memoir, "Almost a Woman."</LD>
<LD>   This newest offering from "Masterpiece Theatre's American
Collection" airs Sunday at 8 p.m., an hour earlier than usual, to be
more accessible for family viewing.</LD>
<LD>   Thirteen-year-old Esmeralda, nicknamed Negi (Ana Maria Lagasca),
is the oldest of seven siblings who move to a cramped New York
apartment in 1961, when vibrant, strict Mami (Wanda De Jesus) leaves
her unfaithful husband in Puerto Rico to find medical care for her
badly injured son.</LD>
<TE>   Negi goes to school, learns English and copes with her mother's
ups and downs, as well as her own adolescent anxieties, homesickness
and the sadness of feeling that she doesn't belong in either her old
world or her new one.</TE>
<TE>   Then Negi is accepted into a prestigious performing arts high
school, a challenge that eventually defines her goal for success.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Betty Kaplan and adapted by Santiago from her novel,
the earnest film is structured as a series of interconnected snapshot
memories.</TE>
<TE>   As such, despite its vivid creation of time and place--and De
Jesus' dominant strength and scene-stealing, astonishing sensual
beauty--it's less resonant than likable, though anchored firmly by
sweet-faced Legasca's heartfelt performance as a girl who is "casi
una mujer"--almost a woman--and knows what she doesn't want: early

<HD>Your Pet Peeved? She'll Listen</HD>
<DH>Television* Can Animal Planet's 'Pet Psychic' really
communicate with critters? A 'reading' with McGwire the cat puts
Sonya Fitzpatrick's claims to the test.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sonya Fitzpatrick, a stunning former British fashion model with a
penchant for calling people "darling," is a modern-day Doctor
Dolittle. During her hourlong weekly series on cable's Animal Planet,
"The Pet Psychic," she meets with animals and their owners and even
feral creatures to solve behavioral problems or just to find out
whatever is on Rover's or Puss' mind.</LD>
<LD>   And just like her counterparts who deal with humans, spiritual
mediums John Edward and James Van Praagh, Fitzpatrick says she can
speak with deceased pets.</LD>
<LD>   During the three months her series has been on the air, she's
helped two lions with mating problems, solved allergy problems in a
cat and comforted a prairie dog in mourning for his dead mate. No
wonder "The Pet Psychic," which debuted in June, has become one of
the top-rated series on the critter-friendly network, sometimes
outpacing such better-established favorites as "Animal Precinct,"
"The Crocodile Hunter" and "The Jeff Corwin Experience."</LD>
<TE>   Michael Cascio, executive vice president and general manager of
Animal Planet, said the cable outlet had been looking for a pet
communicator to build a series around for the past few years. He was
familiar with personable and charming Fitzpatrick because she had
appeared on a series on A&amp;E, "The Unexplained," when Cascio worked at
that network.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a real risk for us," he said. "You are going into an area
that is fraught with either ridicule or disbelief."</TE>
<TE>   "The Pet Psychic" does boast a disclaimer stating that the show is
solely for entertainment purposes.</TE>
<TE>   "What sold me on Sonya was her genuine love for animals. She's
more of a therapist than a psychic, really. She is almost a
behaviorist--why is your pet acting funny? She can tell you why and
what to do. I don't know how she does it. I know she is very
sensitive to animals and that fits into Animal Planet. She is someone
uniquely attuned to the animal kingdom."</TE>
<TE>   As with all "psychics," the world is divided into two camps: the
believers and those who consider the idea a lot of balderdash.</TE>
<TE>   Agreeing to be put to the test, Fitzpatrick visited my apartment
recently to conduct a "reading" of McGwire, my rambunctious,
4-year-old orange tabby named after slugger Mark McGwire.</TE>
<TE>   McGwire decided to hide during the entire reading, but that didn't
seem to bother Fitzpatrick. "He'll come out when he's ready and if
he's ready," said Fitzpatrick, looking at two photos of McGwire.</TE>
<TE>   "He is your whole world, he is not just a cat, darling," she told
me. Of course, one doesn't have to be a psychic to figure that out,
since my apartment looks like the cat toy aisle at PetSmart.</TE>
<TE>   "He is your companion. You adore him. He is the most important
spiritual being in your life."</TE>
<TE>   But a lot of what she said I couldn't explain rationally.</TE>
<TE>   "Who is the older lady you see sometimes?" Fitzpatrick asked.</TE>
<TE>   Tina. She lives across the courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   "He says you go and see her, and you get along with her. He says
he listens to your conversations."</TE>
<TE>   And McGwire, she said, also communicates with Tina's dog, Daisy.
"She is two colors, the dog?"</TE>
<TE>   Yes, black and white.</TE>
<TE>   "The dog isn't an over-big dog. She's very gentle."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, she's a medium-sized dog.</TE>
<TE>   Fitzpatrick explained how she is able to communicate with animals.
"Every time you look at something, he gets a picture from you," she
explained. "Like, if I said to you, 'Could you tell me where the
Statue of Liberty is?' What happens in your mind? You see it. It's
not like a solid, it is almost like sort of an imagination picture;
that's how I talk to animals [by thinking in pictures]."</TE>
<TE>   Domesticated animals, she claimed, know our language.</TE>
<TE>   "They learn our language when they have been with us. When I talk
to wild animals, it's different. I get signals from them through my
body and feelings and emotions. But it's different when they have
lived with you.</TE>
<TE>   "And he's a bit of a gossip. Sometimes you talk to the [neighbor]
too long and you should be paying attention to him [McGwire says]."</TE>
<TE>   I did want to ask Fitzpatrick why such a friendly cat bites me
whenever I pet him. But she beat me to the question.</TE>
<TE>   Why Does He Bite?</TE>
<TE>   Fitzpatrick put her index finger in her mouth and bit down on it
slightly. "Does he do this sometimes?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, every time I pet him.</TE>
<TE>   "Cats are so sensitive," she explained.</TE>
<TE>   "Some cats are more sensitive than others. They're sensitive to
static. He says he doesn't do it hard, but he wants you to know why
he does it. It is because static builds up when you pet him or when
you walk too quickly. He doesn't know why he is feeling that from
you. Let me explain to him what static is and [that] he is a very
special cat. He's discussed it with the dog and she doesn't feel
that."</TE>
<TE>   Fitzpatrick told me to just pet him on the top of the head and
around his face. I have been heeding her advice ever since and
McGwire's biting incidents have been cut down by 90%.</TE>
<TE>   Then she brought up the mouse. Though McGwire has had tons of
mice, scratchers, teasers and balls, he is obsessed with a pink yarn
mouse that he loves to fetch and then dump into his water bowl. I
sometimes hide it in the kitchen to let it dry out.</TE>
<TE>   "He wants to know, where is the mouse?" Fitzpatrick said. "He
loves it. He just loves that one. He never had things like this
before."</TE>
<TE>   Fitzpatrick stared at me. "You have been with him before, you know
that, don't you?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   Excuse me?</TE>
<TE>   "He just knows that he has been with you before," she said. "When
you got him, it was like he had come home. He said he had come home
to you again. That's all he'll tell me."</TE>
<TE>   She then looked around the living room. "When did you have another
cat?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   I had Warren. He died four years ago, a few months shy of his 20th
birthday.</TE>
<TE>   I handed her some pictures of the crusty gray-and-white tabby that
was very different from the carefree McGwire.</TE>
<TE>   "The cat is still here," she said. "It had a different personality
all together from him. This one was like superior, like a king. He's
still right here," she said, pointing to a spot at the top of the
sofa where she "saw" the cat.</TE>
<TE>   "The other one sees him in spirit--but, my goodness, what a
different personality. This one was so secure. He [Warren] says he
didn't take to everybody, and he would just walk away from them. He
is still with you all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Though a lot of what Fitzpatrick said rang true about McGwire and
even Warren, she wasn't always on target. I still have open cans of
tuna in the refrigerator after Fitzpatrick insisted he wanted tuna
with oil. He didn't.</TE>

<DH>Getty exhibitions testify to the singularity of
Jean-Baptiste Greuze, who defied his times to celebrate middle-class
family life with exceptional skill</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jean-Baptiste Greuze (1725-1805), whose drawings are the subject of
an excellent new exhibition at the J. Paul Getty Museum, is an odd
figure among major artists in 18th century France. He's his own
peculiar man.</LD>
<LD>   His work doesn't sparkle with sensual magic and fragility, as
Jean-Antoine Watteau's does. It doesn't bubble with froth, as do
those by Jean Honore Fragonard and Francois Boucher, in which the
world seems poised to dissolve like a sugar cube dropped in warm
water. The humility of a Jean Simeon Chardin still life strikes a
whole different register, as does the sense of momentous occasion in
even the most modestly scaled picture by Jacques Louis David.</LD>
<LD>   Now and then Greuze touches all these chords--he was a painter of
his time, after all, and his careerist ambitions made him keenly
aware of what other artists were doing. But his sensibility is
finally distinct. Greuze was the master of what I think of as "the
bourgeois sublime."</LD>
<TE>   A moralist, he painted pictures that examine nuances of human
nature in order to advocate respectability. Eroticism is never out of
bounds, nor do those nuances overlook the dark side. Sex and violence
are as much subjects in his art as harmony or bliss. But the drama of
domestic life is far more than just a generalized artistic approach
in Greuze's work. It's a theme to be honored with the laurel wreath
of art.</TE>
<TE>   The Getty's show is the first exclusively devoted to Greuze's
drawings. It includes important loans from the Louvre, Russia's State
Hermitage Museum, the Albertina in Vienna and other public and
private collections internationally. Though slightly trimmed from its
original presentation at New York's Frick Museum, where it was
organized and then shown over the summer, "Greuze the Draftsman"
gives a full overview of the artist's 50-year career.</TE>
<TE>   Its 71 sheets reveal an exceptionally gifted draftsman whose work
with chalk and ink is unsurpassed by any of his countrymen--with the
notable exception of the incomparable Watteau. (To measure for
yourself, drop into the Getty's permanent collection galleries and
see the four works by Watteau in a concurrent show of French
drawings.) It's easy to see why Denis Diderot, the writer and
encyclopedist, became Greuze's ardent early champion.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Greuze was something of a prodigy. Born in a small town
near the Swiss border, he went to Paris at 25. Five short years
later, he was a sensation at the biennial Salon exhibition at the
Royal Academy.</TE>
<TE>   One painting he showed there is on view in an adjacent gallery at
the Getty. The unusual subject of "The Sleeping Schoolboy" (1755) is
a small child who has dozed off while reading. It's an intensely
focused study of the dead weight of sleep: a head pressing down on a
hand used as a pillow, which in turn presses down on the pages of an
open book. The mysterious condition of slumber wouldn't seem so
palpable again until the sculptures of Brancusi a century and a half
later.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sleeping Schoolboy" is a marvel of intimate observation. You
find yourself scrutinizing a quotidian experience you've had many
times, but which--for obvious reasons--went unexamined. It was
through drawing that Greuze developed the skill underlying this
painting.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing was the backbone of his training at the Royal Academy. The
show emphasizes two types of work he learned there.</TE>
<TE>   One was called the expressive head: a close analysis of
idiosyncratic facial features and how they can convey psychological
states that are ephemeral but recognizable. The other was the
narrative figural composition, in which an event's dramatic sweep
could be condensed and arrayed in a coherent way to convey a moral
lesson.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the drawings of expressive heads were based on other art,
as was a red chalk study of a swooning woman. Dark, firm, parallel
strokes of chalk surround the woman's delicately shaded face and
veil. The ardor of the marks and their repetition create a
voluptuous, dramatic context for the head, which is based on Giovanni
Bernini's famous sculpture of St. Theresa in ecstasy. (Greuze saw the
Bernini when he made the necessary pilgrimage to Rome, after the
triumph of his Salon debut.)</TE>
<TE>   Most of the drawings were made from direct observation of living
models. Another red chalk drawing of a swooning woman, her
tossed-back head framed by streaming tendrils of hair, shows the
artist's wife in what the catalog describes as post-orgasmic
delirium. (This is the drawing currently reproduced on street-lamp
advertising banners all over town, making traffic jams more
tolerable.) Madame Greuze in ecstasy is obviously informed by the
artist's own carnal experience, as well as by the sculptural example
of Bernini.</TE>
<TE>   As for Greuze's figural groupings, a recitation of some titles
shows their distinctiveness: "The Beloved Mother," "The Father's
Curse: The Ungrateful Son," "The Schoolmistress," "The Spoiled
Child." As a painter at the Royal Academy, Greuze did render figures
from classical history, like Achilles preparing the body of Patroklos
for burial and the Roman heroine Pero nursing her starving and
imprisoned father, Cimon, at her breast. But the classical stuff was
mostly done as preparation for his favored subject, contemporary
domestic life.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those familial subjects can make you cringe. "The Beloved
Mother," for example, transforms the ecstatic swoon that he drew
elsewhere as an erotic thrill into a blissful reverie generated by
six clambering children, who smother their creampuff mom with hugs
and kisses. Meanwhile, proud papa, boisterously returning from the
hunt with his rifle and his dogs, looks on in happy satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   I'm in agreement with the prominent collector of the day who
dismissed the squirming mass of little bodies as "a fricassee of
children." The French know their food.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the drawing is instructive. Greuze's unprecedented aim as
an artist was to give middle-class family life the gravity and
importance of history painting, and history painting represented the
highest aspiration of academic art. His paintings can be labored and
dry, and sometimes their moralizing pomposity can be astounding. But
that labored quality might well partly be a function of his mastery
of drawing.</TE>
<TE>   Greuze drew well and with intensity. More than most painters, he
made drawing after drawing after drawing, both as preparatory studies
and as independent works of art. Greuze's paintings can feel remote
and, in the showiness of their costume drama, even vaguely comical.
But the works on paper are always lively, whether a chalk study of a
facial expression or a fluid ink wash that blocks out the cast of
characters in their theatricalized setting. The spontaneity of the
drawings appeals to modern eyes, which are attuned to art as an
unfolding process of thought and emotion and as the courting of
fortuitous accident.</TE>
<TE>   "Greuze the Draftsman" has been augmented at the Getty by two
small but absorbing presentations.</TE>
<TE>   "Greuze and the Academy" brings together illustrations from
Diderot's encyclopedia and critics' pamphlets from the Salon to show
how formal artistic training was shaped in the 18th century and how
the French public responded. "Greuze the Painter" brings together all
five of the artist's paintings now in Los Angeles collections;
they're supplemented by eight others that provide an enlightening
context.</TE>
<TE>   Greuze's effort to elevate domestic subjects didn't pan out with
the Royal Academy, which caused a scandal by in turn refusing to
elevate the hugely popular artist from the low rank of genre painter.
Greuze, stunned, stopped showing at the Salon for the next 30 years,
and he made a success of it. That's another thing that makes him so
appealing today.</TE>

<LD>Finally, someone has pointed out that Rolling Stone is a mere shell
of its former self and recognized that Q and Mojo are two of the best
music magazines in print today ("It's Over 30; Can Rolling Stone Be
Trusted?," by Robert Hilburn, Sept. 7).</LD>
<LD>   Rolling Stone has gone from "All the news that's fit to print" to
"All the schmooze that we can print." I realize that keeping current
is a necessity in business, but its near worship of the "flavor of
the month" pop stars is nauseating.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The period that gave birth to Rolling Stone was one of those
occasions when demographics, media of communication and commercial
manipulation of each combined to persuade readers and writers of
Rolling Stone alike that their opinions were revelations and their
moment transformational in all history.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the music and some of the insights were indeed fresh and
enlightened, but not as much as the relentless hype about the period
would have us believe.</TE>
<TE>   When you run out of things to say, you put Britney Spears on the
cover. Meanwhile, those of us who are raising children, rather than
trying to act like them, are listening to other music and reading
other journals. The question is no longer whether to trust someone
over 30 but the more difficult one of how to live a life beyond 30
that is worthy of trust.</TE>
<TE>   Too little of rock music, and next to nothing found anymore in the
pages of Rolling Stone, helps answer that question.</TE>

<TE>   Not to defend a magazine's descent into dismissibility, I want
only to offer my criticism of Robert Hilburn's seeming myopia for not

<TE>   He yearns for the socio-political relevance of a music and a

the culture, climate and creativity that gave birth to Rolling Stone

<LD>I take strong exception to Sean Mitchell's review of the Sept. 8
Pasadena Playhouse performance of "Blue" ("Singing the Blues," Sept.
10). I question his point of reference and familiarity with the
milieu he is critiquing.</LD>
<LD>   What the audience saw was an authentic, dynamic familial
situation--warts and all--of the American black upper-middle class.
The geographic location was merely happenstance: thus, the depiction
was not provincial.</LD>
<LD>   The play gave us characters, situation, song and humorous
emotional release as a moving and deeply human cathartic journey was
revealed.</LD>

<LD>Howard Rosenberg's story about TV coverage of the 9/11 remembrances
("Names Cut Through the Pomp," Sept. 12) was the most poignant and
tender tribute yet written to the poor souls who lost their lives in
the attacks.</LD>
<LD>   More than any other words or pictures, his piece reminded all of
us that they were people--simple, honest folks who probably did turn
on the tube, channel surf and enjoy water-cooler chat about the
latest "Seinfeld" episode.</LD>
<LD>   Leave it to the TV critic of the L.A. Times to touch our hearts
and keep it real. I'll be thinking about the people he so touchingly
wrote about for a very long time.</LD>

<TE>   Howard Rosenberg's Sept. 12 column once more reflects the fact
that he obviously is a supercilious, shallow, tinsel town lightweight
whose work has no place in the "serious news" sections of the paper.
He has succeeded in trivializing the deaths of the victims of
9-11-01.</TE>

<LD>I don't know what stands out about 1962 in terms of movie history
("Cinema's Best Year? '62 ... Perhaps," by Robert W. Welkos, Sept.
9). My pick for the best year would be 1973. It was incredibly
diverse and one of the last years in which originality took
precedence over box-office receipts.</LD>
<LD>   Some examples are "Don't Look Now," "Scarecrow," "Last Tango in
Paris," "Save the Tiger," "Jesus Christ Superstar," "Serpico" and
"The Exorcist." There was a lot of funny stuff too, such as "Paper
Moon," "Sleeper," "American Graffiti," "The Last Detail" and "The
Sting."</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to write an amusing article, Emily Polsby unnecessarily
distorted and misrepresented the facts regarding this summer's
Hollywood Pitch Festival ("Talk About a Fevered Pitch," Sept. 7).</LD>
<LD>   In her article, the Hollywood Pitch Festival was depicted as some
stand-in-line-all-day event, where, as one of 250 attendees, you get
three minutes to pitch executives. For the past six years, 200
attendees, from all walks of life from the U.S. and abroad, have
scheduled one-on-one appointments with members of the Hollywood
community representing the major studios, networks, the principal
talent agencies as well as established producers and literary
managers. Each meeting is seven minutes. And each attendee is given a
list to review (a week in advance), which clearly states what each
industry professional-production entity is currently looking to
produce (a list Polsby clearly neglected to read, as evidenced by her
misguided exchange with the action producer).</LD>
<LD>   Several of the attendees Polsby portrayed as crazy with outlandish
ideas actually had great results at the event. Even the so-called
ex-drug dealer's "69 Reasons Not to Deal Drugs" is currently being
developed by Neil Labute's company, Pretty Pictures, as a result of
the festival.</LD>

<HD>Going in Crop Circles</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a Sept. 7 letter that responded to my Counterpunch article about
crop circles ("Circling Wagons in Defense of Alien 'Crop' Theory,"
Sept. 2), writer Dave Suess ridiculed me for not having more faith in
the ingenuity of humankind, while presenting nothing to counter the
information I gave to show that there is a crop circle phenomenon
that can't be attributed to people.</LD>
<LD>   I was struck by how the letter illustrated the very point I was
making--that the so-called "other side" never makes a case for how
crop circles can be human-made, but is shameless in declaring that
they are.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the crop circle conversation has become skewed. Instead
of researchers having to prove hoaxers are incapable of making good
circles, hoaxers should need to prove they can make them, since the
weight of the evidence is that they can't.</LD>

<LD>   Cronkite Regrets Early Retirement from CBS</LD>
<LD>   More than 20 years after signing off the air for the last time,
retired CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite still regrets giving up his
career.</LD>
<TE>   A longing to return to work is with him "always, every day," the
85-year-old newsman said. But it hits him especially hard during
major news events such as the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks: "When the
big story is breaking, you want to be there. I knew that was going to
happen, I just didn't know it was going to happen over so many
years."</TE>
<TE>   Cronkite, who now works on documentaries with his son's company,
Cronkite Productions, addressed the annual convention of the American
Assn. of Retired Persons in San Diego on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   He left the evening news in 1981, he explained at the time, to
spend more time with his grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have stayed quite a bit longer ... knowing what I know
now, that I would still have plenty of years to grow up with the
kids," he said in an interview. "Not being on the air, that's not
important. But I'd like to be in the newsroom helping set the
agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Audiences Tune In for Sept. 11 Coverage</TE>
<TE>   Rather than shying away from difficult remembrances of last Sept.
11, viewers appeared to be drawn to them Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   According to preliminary Nielsen Media Research ratings, ABC drew
10.8 million viewers during the 8 p.m. hour for a news special
drawing on the recollections of World Trade Center survivors. That
beat CBS, which had 9.8 million viewers for a program highlighting an
exclusive interview in which President Bush reconstructed his actions
a year ago. NBC had 8.9 million people tuning in for an hour focusing
on air traffic controllers.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, fewer people were watching Wednesday than on the previous
week, when Fox alone had more than 22 million viewers for the
"American Idol" finale.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Fox News Channel averaged just more than 1 million
viewers on Wednesday, vs. 922,000 for CNN and 316,000 for MSNBC--all
three up over their August averages.</TE>
<TE>   FX Won't Renew Stern's 'Son of the Beach'</TE>
<TE>   "Son of the Beach," FX's broad, raunchy "Baywatch" parody
executive produced by radio personality Howard Stern, is heading for
cancellation after three more episodes. Though FX has not made an
official announcement, sources say the network won't renew the
series, seen Tuesday nights at 10.</TE>
<TE>   Now in its third year, the show's ratings haven't much changed
since its debut, despite extensive promotion on Stern's nationally
syndicated morning radio show. This year's average of 983,000 viewers
is slightly higher than its first season.</TE>
<TE>   "Son of the Beach" may still get picked up by another cable
outlet.</TE>
<TE>   FX declined comment and calls to Stern's agent, Don Buchwald, were
not returned.</TE>

<TE>   'Golden' Conductor to Exit Opera Australia</TE>
<TE>   Opera Australia has effectively fired its high-profile music
director, Simone Young, after less than two years in the orchestra
pit. She is currently earning critical acclaim conducting the Los
Angeles Opera's "Girl of the Golden West."</TE>
<TE>   Young's contract will not be renewed when it expires at the end of
2003, the opera company announced Friday, because company finances
could not keep up with Young's artistic ambitions. The opera
company's chief executive, Adrian Collette, said that, while Opera
Australia would still welcome Young as a guest conductor, "her future
visions are not sustainable by Opera Australia in its current
financial position."</TE>
<TE>   The conductor, whose turn at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion
continues through Sept. 22, is said to have been surprised and upset
when told several days ago of the decision. Though Young, 40, was not
available for comment Friday, she said in a statement: "I have always
said that if certain artistic developments could not be made,
including an increase in the size of the orchestra and the chorus,
and the maintenance of certain vocal standards, I would not continue
as music director. This is a very sad position for the national opera
company, and the arts in Australia."</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Cliff, Stewart Team for Peace Song</TE>
<TE>   Eurythmics star Dave Stewart and reggae legend Jimmy Cliff have
teamed up on a song, "Peace for One Day," that they hope will played
by radio stations worldwide on Sept. 21.</TE>
<TE>   That date has been designated by the United Nations as the
International Day of Peace, a notion conceived by British filmmaker
Jeremy Gilley, another collaborator on the project. Last year, the
General Assembly passed a resolution calling for 24 hours of
cease-fires and nonviolence.</TE>
<TE>   The tune, provided free to the stations and on the Internet, is to
be upbeat rather than maudlin. "We're not really making a single that
we're trying to get on the charts," Stewart said. "It's an idea to
uplift people."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   ABC's "This Week" gets its new host, George Stephanopoulos, on
Sunday, and the show is getting a new regular panelist as well.
Michel Martin of ABC's "Nightline" will join longtime contributor
George F. Will at the show's round table. Martin will remain a
"Nightline" correspondent and the host of PBS' "Life 360".... Veteran
jazz vocalist Al Jarreau underwent emergency back surgery at the USC
Medical Center Thursday to relieve pressure on his spinal cord. His
U.S. tour dates will be rescheduled.... Jude Law and his wife,
actress Sadie Frost, became the parents of a third child, a son, in
London Tuesday.... Tickets go on sale via Ticketmaster at noon Sunday
for a Nov. 4 staged reading of "The World of Nick Adams," a
fund-raiser at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood for the launch of Paul
Newman's Painted Turtle Camp--a Lake Elizabeth, Calif., facility
serving 3,500 ill children and their families. Joining Newman and his
wife Joanne Woodward: Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Annette Bening,
Warren Beatty, Brian Dennehy, Danny DeVito and Kevin Kline.... Fox is
shooting a "Baywatch" reunion movie, featuring 15 former cast
members, including Pamela Anderson and David Hasselhoff.... Comedian
Jay Mohr will host an NBC series, "Funniest Person in America," in
which 10 comedians will live together and compete for a network
development deal.</TE>

<HD>Early Hollywood Stars: Peek at 7 Homes</HD>
<DH>Carrie Fisher hosts a tour of houses once inhabited by the
rich and famous, including her own, which Bette Davis rented in the
1940s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pick the pocket of any out-of-state tourist visiting Southern
California and you'll probably find a checklist that includes the
following entries: (1) Go to Disneyland; (2) Check out Grauman's
Chinese Theatre; (3) Buy a map to the movie stars' homes.</LD>
<LD>   Forbidding hedges and security-gated enclaves have robbed pursuit
No. 3 of much of its curb appeal, but the fascination with fabled
dwellings of the rich and famous continues.</LD>
<LD>   Leave it to the Home and Garden channel to take this fascination
and run with it in its hourlong special, "The Homes That Made
Hollywood." The program, hosted by actress-writer Carrie Fisher,
takes viewers through seven properties linked to the early days of
the film industry.</LD>
<TE>   The choice of Fisher was a natural: She owns one of the more
interesting homes on the tour, and although we get to see very little
of the interior, its bloodlines are impeccable. Built in 1919 to
resemble a Mexican hacienda, it was rented in the 1940s by Bette
Davis, who was charmed by its 3-foot-thick adobe walls and expansive
open-beam ceilings. Shortly after, Oscar-winning fashion designer
Edith Head purchased the property, and star-studded parties were soon
the norm. Elizabeth Taylor reportedly was a frequent houseguest
between marriages.</TE>
<TE>   Head lived in the house until her death in 1981, and when it went
on the market in '92, Fisher snatched it up, saying the style and
size were perfect for her rapidly expanding collection of folk art,
Navajo rugs and rustic furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like the mother ship of my last house," says the "Star

<TE>   The other homes on the tour range from Will Rogers' huge spread,
an 11,000-square-foot home on 186 hilltop acres in Pacific Palisades,
to the exceedingly modest Spanish-style bungalow where Walt Disney
first hung his hat in Los Angeles in 1928. Fearful that other
cartoonists would steal his work, Disney took his sketches home each
night and came up with a character named Mickey Mouse while working
in the garage.</TE>
<TE>   This HGTV special could just as easily have been named "The Homes
That Made Beverly Hills," because several of the featured properties
were built there on speculation to lure rich film folk; when they
took the bait, others soon followed, and a gilded community was born.</TE>
<TE>   Screen idol Rudolph Valentino was one of the early homeowners
there. In 1925, he purchased the hilltop mansion he dubbed Falcon
Lair as a love nest he could share with his new bride.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, the dream was not to be; the couple divorced before they
could move in.</TE>
<TE>   Now that's Hollywood.</TE>

<TE>   "The Homes That Made Hollywood" can be seen at 9 p.m. Sunday on

<DH>'The Chosen,' an engrossing adaptation of Chaim Potok's
novel, has its West Coast premiere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Jewish teenagers, growing up in '40s Brooklyn, are on parallel
but very different paths toward adulthood--yet manage to become best
friends.</LD>
<LD>   The parallelism becomes tangible in the absorbing stage adaptation
of the late Chaim Potok's popular novel "The Chosen," now in its
beautifully acted West Coast premiere at Miles Memorial Playhouse in
Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   On one side of the stage is the kitchen table of yeshiva teacher
David Malter (John Herzog) and son Reuven (Nicholas Downs). On the
other side is the home office of a Hasidic rabbi, Reb Saunders
(Robert Grossman), who discusses the Talmud but does not otherwise
talk to his son and anointed successor Danny (Adam Silverstein).</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes the audience can see action simultaneously in both
homes. When the rabbi forbids his son from seeing Reuven because of
Reuven's father's Zionism, heated discussions erupt in overlapping
dialogue on both sides of the stage.</TE>
<TE>   The story is smoothly narrated by Robert Pescovitz, playing
grown-up Reuven plus several small roles. In the second act, the
older Reuven briefly counsels the younger Reuven, like a voice from
the future, urging him to concentrate on what he really wants to do
with his life. It's the play's most pointedly theatrical device.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, this adaptation--by Potok and Aaron Pos-
ner--creates a living stage event, not a literal reenactment of the
novel.</TE>
<TE>   The novel's length would preclude the more literal approach.
Certainly the story has been trimmed to fit a standard theatrical
running time. We see the initial meeting of the two boys in their
dramatic confrontation at a baseball game, in which slugger Danny's
hit injures pitcher Reuven's eye. But in Reuven's subsequent hospital
stay, the stage version eliminates his fellow patients, doctor and
nurse. The two boys become friends faster on stage.</TE>
<TE>   Women--hardly prominent in the novel--are completely absent from
the play. The sense that Reb Saunders usually speaks in Yiddish,
obvious in the book even though his words are printed in English, is
hardly noticeable here.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the play also has a few enriching details that aren't in the
book. Some of these are purely visual. In the second act, we see
Reuven and Danny playfully slapping each other as part of a
reconciliation scene, and we briefly see them playing catch, in a
mild echo of their first meeting. When Reb Saunders finally releases
Danny to go his own way, the two embrace. No such embrace is
mentioned in the book, but in the theater it provides a necessary
catharsis.</TE>
<TE>   The casting is impeccable. Silverstein's Danny has a carefully
controlled charisma. Downs and Herzog, as his father, establish such
a warm bond that we can see where Reuven acquired his easy
self-assurance, as well as his inquisitive spirit. Grossman's Reb
Saunders has a resonant voice and a formidable wrath.</TE>
<TE>   David Ellenstein's staging is a co-production of his own Los
Angeles Repertory Company and the West Coast Jewish Theatre. The
collaboration surely facilitated doing the show at the 150-seat
Miles, with the higher costs of an Actors' Equity contract, instead
of a sub-100-seat theater. The Miles seating is raked only every few
rows, which could lead to sight-line problems, but the dialogue is
clearly audible. And the pre-'40s theater's ambience is appropriate
for this penetrating look into the rewards and the perils of
choosing, and of being chosen.</TE>

<HD>Summer Lingers as Philharmonic Closes a Season</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lack of well-defined seasons in Southern California is never more
disconcerting than in the transition between summer and fall, usually
the hottest time of the year. In the musical world, that blur is
stronger than ever right now. Los Angeles Opera began its new season
last week; meanwhile, the Hollywood Bowl still rolls along,
prolonging the musical summer through September.</LD>
<LD>   And when the Los Angeles Philharmonic waved farewell to another
season at the Bowl Thursday night, it did so with the lingering theme
of summer. The main piece of an evening of French music was Berlioz's
orchestral song cycle, "Les Nuits d'Ete" (Summer Nights).</LD>
<LD>   To add to seasonal confusion, a morbid chill runs through these
songs of love and loss, and the air temperature dropped noticeably as
Susan Graham sang them. As well it should. Who thinks of languid
summer hearing the extraordinary imagery of Theophile Gautier's text
in the second song, "Spectre of the Rose"? In revenge, the spirit of
that plucked flower comes back to haunt the young girl who wore its
tomb, so to speak, on her alabaster breast at the ball.</LD>
<TE>   Graham is one of the most impressive of the many impressive
mezzo-sopranos on the scene today. Her voice is as dark, deep, rich
and powerful as a contralto's, but it also has a shining silvery ring
on top. She has made her name, in part, as an All-American, recording
the songs of Ned Rorem and creating operatic roles in John Harbison's
"Great Gatsby" and Jake Heggie's "Dead Man Walking." Yet she is also
a deserved star in Classical period operas by Mozart and Gluck, while
being equally celebrated for her Berlioz, from the Romantic era. Her
latest CD is of little known and irresistible arias from French
operetta.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a few uncharacteristically rough moments at the Bowl
Thursday, Graham brought a sumptuous fullness to "Nuit d'Ete," more
forceful than sensual, and she was supported in this approach by a
weighty orchestra sound enforced by the Israeli conductor Asher
Fisch, making his Philharmonic debut. Tempos were often on the slow
side, poetic drama was heavily emphasized, climaxes exaggerated, but
still with the necessary waft of sonic French perfume.</TE>
<TE>   Then, changing gown and temperament after intermission, she
returned in spangles and purple boa for three sassy feminist Parisian
operetta numbers. In the dazzler, by the early 20th century Cuban
expatriate, Moises Simons, Carmen kills Escamillo. Fisch doesn't have
quite the light touch of Yves Abel, who accompanies Graham on her
marvelous new CD, but he showed a sense of humor nonetheless. (An
evening's worth of these numbers could make for an unforgettable Bowl
program.)</TE>
<TE>   The program was filled out by Berlioz's "Benvenuto Cellini"
Overture and Dukas' "The Sorcerer's Apprentice." The overture had the
usual added soundtrack to pieces that open a concert at the Bowl: the
clack of latecomers, the tinkle of persevering diners, and the dogged
insistence of bill-collecting waiters, at times louder than the soft
theme in the basses. But Fisch is a determined conductor, again more
Wagnerian than Berliozian, and he found the Philharmonic, in its
first week back from a European tour, tightly focused.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sorcerer's Apprentice," on the other hand, closed the program
with a terrific impact. Dukas' brief symphonic poem is often ignored
these days, perhaps forever lost to Mickey in "Fantasia." It is, in
fact, brilliant music, original in its orchestral technique and
harmonic language; Fisch and the Philharmonic made a splendid splash
with it.</TE>
<TE>   Graham's encore was an obscure sentimental American song, "Bless
This House," written 75 years ago but newly and mawkishly
orchestrated. She meant it as a patriotic gesture and sang it with
commanding emotion. However sincere, it came across peculiarly
heavy-handed, as if we were served an over-syruped, sobering cola
nightcap after the delectable champagne of sophisticated French
music.</TE>

<LD>Thirty years ago this month, "The Waltons" made its network debut, a
series of homespun values that would connect with audiences in a big
way and make a small-screen star out of Richard "John Boy" Thomas.</LD>
<LD>   The series had a lengthy run, but afterward, Thomas' efforts to
find an equally durable and successful franchise proved difficult.
After all these years, he's back in a diverting drama premiering on
the Pax network, "Just Cause." The show gets underway Sunday at 9
p.m. in a two-hour special, with hourlong episodes to follow each
week, also on Sundays at 9.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas plays Hamilton Whitney III, a thrice-married, Ivy
League-schooled lawyer who is thrown together with attractive ex-con
Alex DeMonaco (Elizabeth Lackey), whose own legal training came via
the Internet between cell searches and lockdowns.</LD>
<TE>   DeMonaco, who we are told hails from Boyle Heights, was an
innocent dupe, of course. Her incarceration for an insurance scam was
actually the doing of her evil-lawyer hubby, who vanished with their
young daughter as police closed in, leaving her holding the
proverbial bag. Upon her release from prison after five long years,
she's ready to nail the jerk, reclaim her daughter and just maybe get
something going with Whitney.</TE>
<TE>   The show uses flashes of humor as it plays the odd-couple dynamics
for all they're worth. Flirty attorney Patrick Heller (Shaun Benson)
and flinty probation officer C.J. Leon (Roger Cross) provide some
effective shadings as DeMonaco tries to find a niche in Whitney's San
Francisco law firm.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's debut episode threatens at times to get bogged down in
the legal minutiae of a wrongful-termination subplot, but Lackey's
sunny appeal and Thomas' growing interest in her keep things
interesting.</TE>

<HD>Plant Refreshes His Classic Rock Roots</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As a '70s icon, Robert Plant can't help it if he evokes fuzzy
nostalgic feelings, but he is trying his best not to simply phone it
in as an oldies act. The ex-Led Zeppelin singer's invigorating
performance at the Greek Theatre on Thursday rejiggered classic rock
warhorses in compelling ways and found the common ground where hard
rock eddies back into vernacular music.</LD>
<LD>   Even when he was a heavy metal Bacchus, Plant flashed his love for
folk and blues all over Led Zeppelin's albums. His latest release,
"Dreamland," is a tribute to American songwriters such as folk artist
Tim Buckley and Skip Spence, the pop eccentric behind the '60s band
Moby Grape. At the Greek, Plant betrayed a love for West Coast music,
but with Eastern undercurrents.</LD>
<LD>   A burly version of Arthur Lee's "House Is Not a Motel" downshifted
into an ululating Indian raga with some help from L.A. violinist Lili
Haydn.</LD>
<TE>   "Morning Dew," a song made popular by the Grateful Dead ("we could
use some of that now," Plant quipped), was hypnotic and stirring. And
the inevitable Zep material--"Whole Lotta Love," "Misty Mountain Hop"
and "Going to California," among others--sounded terrific, even if
Plant's middle-aged vocal cords can't hit those towering high notes
anymore.</TE>

<HD>California's Jobless Rate Dips to 6.2%</HD>
<DH>Economy: The state's employment market still is exhibiting
signs of weakness despite the addition of 11,700 net payroll
positions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's unemployment rate fell to 6.2% in August as the state's
employers added 11,700 net jobs to their payrolls, according to
statistics released Friday by the state. But the numbers belied
continued weakness in the job market.</LD>
<LD>   The state's labor force shrank last month, a sign that some
workers have become so discouraged that they stopped looking for
employment and thus are no longer counted in the jobless statistics,
economists said.</LD>
<LD>   Though the August jobs increase was the largest monthy rise since
January, most of the new positions are on government payrolls, a sign
that private-sector employers remained reluctant to do much hiring.</LD>
<TE>   Since the pre-recession employment peak in January 2001,
California has lost 69,800 nonfarm payroll jobs. This year, the
world's sixth-largest economy has created a mere 3,400 net jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that unemployment is going down is not an indication of
a turnaround in the labor market," said economist Esmael Adibi,
director of the Anderson Center for Economic Research at Chapman
University in Orange. "The labor market is basically at a standstill.
We are treading water."</TE>
<TE>   California's 6.2% jobless rate was down from a revised 6.4% in
July, Employment Development Department figures showed. A year ago
the rate stood at 5.5%.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. unemployment rate in August was 5.7%, down from 5.9% in
July. In August 2001, the U.S. jobless rate was 4.9%.</TE>
<TE>   The state added a total of 20,400 jobs in four sectors in August:
wholesale trade, retail trade, financial services and government. The
biggest contributor was local government, which added 16,400 jobs,
most of them in education. But those jobs are notoriously difficult
to adjust for seasonal ebb and flow of teachers from the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   In July's employment report, for example, the EDD said California
gained 7,500 net jobs, fueled largely by increases in the education
sector. But the department revised those figures sharply downward in
Friday's data, saying the economy lost 11,000 jobs in July.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts such as Brad Williams, senior economist for the
California legislative analyst's office, warn against reading too
much into August numbers showing an increase in government
employment. The real story, he said, is the dearth of jobs being
generated by the private sector, which is reflected in shrinking
payroll tax revenue. The state's withholding tax revenue was down 6%
in August compared with a year earlier. That's a big reason
California is facing budget woes.</TE>
<TE>   But Williams said the bigger concern is a potential slowdown in
consumer spending, which has helped prop up the economy. Easy credit
and cash-out mortgages have allowed Americans to keep spending during
the downturn. But the spree can't continue if people don't have jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "From a labor market perspective, the economy has basically
stalled out," Williams said. "...The big question is how long
consumers can keep spending ... without employment growth."</TE>
<TE>   The lengthening duration of unemployment in California likewise
points to softness in the labor market. In August, 17.3% of the
state's 1.1 million jobless residents had been without work for at
least 27 weeks. That's up sharply from the trough of 11.7% in
September 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a corresponding relationship between the duration of
unemployment and the overall job picture," said Michael Bernick,
director of the EDD. "It went down during the boom years. Now it's
creeping up" as the labor market has slowed.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County saw its August unemployment rate drop to 6.4%
from 6.8% in July, Orange County dipped to 4% from 4.2%, Riverside

<HD>ABC to Continue 'Monk,' Delay Airing 'Dinotopia'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Extending a novel experiment initiated this summer, ABC will continue
running the USA Network series "Monk" on Thursday nights well into
the new TV season--after the episodes play on cable--allowing ABC to
delay the premiere of its special effects-laden project "Dinotopia"
until Thanksgiving night.</LD>
<LD>   The maneuver is a financial and scheduling boon to Walt Disney
Co.-owned ABC, which faced the daunting prospect of introducing eight
series this fall. Sources say the deal to rerun "Monk" costs the
network about $300,000 per episode--a little more than one-fourth the
average fee networks pay producers of new dramatic series.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, "Dinotopia" has been laboring to meet a targeted
early-October premiere date because of the elaborate visual effects
on the series, set in a world where dinosaurs and humans live side by
side. Postponing the show until Thanksgiving--a night of high family
viewing--also will let ABC offer new episodes in December, a period
when competing programs such as "Friends" on General Electric
Co.-owned NBC are in reruns.</LD>
<TE>   "Monk," starring Tony Shalhoub as an obsessive-compulsive
detective, provided ABC with a rare bright spot this summer. Four
episodes shown against News Corp.-owned Fox's hit "American Idol"
finished a solid second in that hour, averaging 8.3 million
viewers--far more than had been watching it on USA, a unit of Vivendi
Universal.</TE>
<TE>   Although several network programs repeat on cable, it's rare to
reverse that equation. In fact, sources say ABC officials wanted to
flip the window so the series would run on ABC first--a proposal
rejected by USA.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our hit," USA Network President Doug Herzog said. "You can't
give them away."</TE>
<TE>   ABC Entertainment President Susan Lyne said, "What started off as
a nice little summer experiment paid off more than we expected it
to."</TE>
<TE>   ABC also has sought to expand the order beyond the initial 13
episodes, but USA balked at that as well, believing that the current
number was sufficient to meet its programming needs.</TE>
<TE>   "Monk" is produced by Touchstone Television, another division of
Disney that offered the program to ABC first. The network passed but
negotiated the right to repeat episodes after USA ran them.</TE>

<HD>Disney CEO Reassures Analysts, Investors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES and THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner met with Wall Street
investors and analysts Friday to convey that although the
entertainment company has a multitude of problems such as the
money-losing ABC network and lagging theme park attendance, it's not
the unhappiest place on Earth.</LD>
<LD>   During an afternoon meeting, Eisner, who also is chief executive,
and Disney Chief Financial Officer Thomas Staggs unveiled no
significant news, according to people who were at the meetings. But
they did try to counter the growing belief among investors and
analysts that ABC's upcoming fall season is a make-or-break time for
the firm.</LD>
<LD>   Eisner and Disney have been under mounting pressure as the
company's stock has sagged to levels not seen since the mid-1990s.
Institutional investors, some of whom will meet next week with Eisner
to discuss the company's problems and its corporate governance, have
complained openly about Disney's performance.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, some board members, who are scheduled to meet this
month, are pushing Eisner for major changes in an effort to turn
things around.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey B. Logsdon of investment bank Gerard Klauer Mattison said
Eisner on Friday called reviving ABC "a process" and not a one-time
event. As Staggs was leaving the meeting, the CFO reiterated that
point to Reuters, saying that although a turnaround would take time,
Disney "has tremendous talent and a strong slate for the fall."
Staggs added that ABC's television group already was showing signs of
strength, helped in part by election-year political advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the company's problems stem from deteriorating ratings at
ABC, although other divisions, notably the company's theme park unit,
also have shown disappointing results.</TE>
<TE>   ABC was a major topic, but Logsdon described the main theme of the
meetings as "reassurance from the chairman that he feels things are
moving in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Disney shares were unchanged Friday at $15.50 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Retail Sales Up 0.8% in August as Fears Are Eased</HD>
<DH>Economy: Low interest rates and tame inflation help to fuel
consumers' surprisingly strong spending on big-ticket items such as
cars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. consumers shrugged off economic anxieties and boosted spending
on big-ticket items such as cars and furniture as they reaped the
benefits of low inflation and cheap interest rates, reports showed
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said consumers' willingness to shop even as some measures
show shaky confidence could help to lift the economy out of its
doldrums.</LD>
<LD>   Data from the Commerce Department showing a 0.8% jump in August
retail sales reinforced expectations that U.S. gross domestic product
could post a growth rate above 3% in the third quarter, which ends
this month.</LD>
<TE>   "August should not have been a good month for retailers, but it
sure looks like it was," said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff
Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   "This report tells us the economy is not falling apart by any
means," he said.</TE>
<TE>   August's bigger-than-expected retail sales gain came on the back
of gains of 1.1% in July and 1.4% in June.</TE>
<TE>   Economists were pleasantly surprised by the data in light of
fairly downbeat anecdotal reports from retailers.</TE>
<TE>   The rise also seemed to defy beliefs that sagging consumer
confidence would prompt people to shut their wallets.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Michigan's preliminary September consumer
sentiment index fell to 86.2, which is the index's lowest level since
November, from a final reading of 87.6 in August.</TE>
<TE>   That was below economists' forecasts of 87.5.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have linked the weak confidence number to worries about
the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks and mounting talk of war with
Iraq, coupled with an anemic job market.</TE>
<TE>   "Follow the money," said Neal Soss, chief economist at Credit
Suisse First Boston in New York. "Watch what consumers do, not what
they say."</TE>
<TE>   Low interest rates and bargain-hunting amid tame inflation have
helped to fuel strong consumer spending.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department said Friday that its producer price index, a
gauge of inflation at the wholesale level, was flat in August.</TE>
<TE>   The core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices,
dipped 0.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Economists said this confirmed that inflation is dormant and the
Federal Reserve has little to fear from price pressures if it wants
to keep interest rates low in order to stimulate economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed meets Sept. 24. Although there had been talk in the last
few weeks that the central bank might ease rates further from their
current four-decade low of 1.75%, a majority of analysts are
convinced that it will leave rates unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   The latest data left the impression that the economy is holding up
well enough without extra tonic.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding automobiles, retail sales rose 0.4% after a 0.2%
increase in July and a 0.4% rise in June.</TE>
<TE>   Reports from car manufacturers released earlier this month had
left little doubt that this component of the retail sales report
would shine. With no-interest loans and cash-back deals enticing
customers, car sales reached an annual rate of 18.7 million units
last month, the highest of the year and the second-highest monthly
sales rate on record.</TE>

<HD>Jilters Regret Missing 'Wedding'</HD>
<DH>Movies: 'Big Fat Greek' success is sweet for the film's
backers but painful for those who turned down the filmmakers'
proposal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA ELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Film distributors and financiers throughout Hollywood can call it
their "Big Fat Mistake."</LD>
<LD>   They passed on the summer's surprise hit "My Big Fat Greek
Wedding," one of the most profitable independent movies ever with an
expected domestic gross of more than $100 million.</LD>
<LD>   With most of the industry's major players taking a pass, the money
instead is flowing to a collection of unlikely beneficiaries. They
include an obscure production company with no theatrical track
record, an unknown actress who initially got $500 for the script and
a Hollywood power couple, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, who produced the
low-budget film for the love of art, not money.</LD>
<TE>   Said the head of one art-house distribution firm who saw the film
and the positive research results: "How dumb were we? In a town
obsessed with numbers, we ignored the numbers."</TE>
<TE>   After seeing the movie, many top distributors dismissed it as
nothing more than a 90-minute TV sitcom with no stars and no obvious
marketing hook. It was aimed at older women, not the demographic that
typically turns movies into mega-hits.</TE>
<TE>   Independent distributors, including Miramax Film Corp. and Fox
Searchlight, also ignored audience raves from a research screening in
Woodland Hills. Even Lions Gate Films, whose executives attended a
screening and witnessed the crowd reaction, backed out of a
distribution deal reached before the movie was shot.</TE>
<TE>   "Though I'm a little disappointed that it's not ours, it shows the
amazing upside for the independent film business," said Lions Gate
Chief Executive Jon Feltheimer.</TE>
<TE>   This certainly is not the first time Hollywood has guessed wrong.
But this mistake may go down as one of the most memorable.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Joel Zwick, "Greek Wedding" was made for only $5
million and has cost just under $20 million to market, ranking it as
one of the best returns on investment for any movie.</TE>
<TE>   Although its expected windfall won't rival Sony's summer behemoth
"Spider-Man," industry insiders estimate "Greek Wedding" could
generate a profit of $75 million or more, depending on its overseas,
home video, DVD and television sales. The biggest wild card is how
foreign audiences, particularly in unpredictable markets such as
Japan, will respond.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend, the film will pass the $100-million mark, still
going strong nearly five months after its release, a remarkable
accomplishment at a time when audiences for even the biggest films
dwindle quickly.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the success of "Greek Wedding" so sweet for some and so
painful for others is that no one expected such a rich dowry.</TE>
<TE>   The film's star and screenwriter, Nia Vardalos, a Canadian of
Greek descent, initially optioned her screenplay, which is based on
her one-woman stage show, for a mere $500. She was paid just $150,000
to star in the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say Vardalos is guaranteed around 8% of the film's profits
after expenses and distribution fees are deducted. Eventually, the
sources say, she could earn more than $7 million from the film and
its video and DVD sales. Not bad for someone who could land only
voice-over work for commercials when she arrived in Hollywood from
Toronto, where she was a comedian with Second City.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Vardalos, another unlikely winner from the film's success
is Gold Circle, a little known, 2 1/2-year-old Beverly Hills
financing and production boutique owned by Gateway  Inc. co-founder
Norm Waitt.</TE>
<TE>   The company had made only straight-to-video films before
consultant Paul Brooks showed up with "Greek Wedding."</TE>
<TE>   "We fell in love and committed to provide half the
financing," said Brooks, who is now president of Gold Circle, which
kicked in $2.5 million for production costs and shouldered the nearly $20
million marketing expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the financing came from another company best known for
its cable TV shows--Home Box Office.</TE>
<TE>   HBO agreed to co-finance "Greek Wedding" as a favor to Hanks, who
had produced the acclaimed miniseries "Band Of Brothers" and "From
the Earth to the Moon" for the cable network. Hanks became interested
in the project after his half-Greek wife, Rita Wilson, saw the play
with her mother and sister in a Los Angeles theater in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Hanks, who produced the film with partner Gary Goetzman through
their firm Playtone Pictures, never could have imagined that "Greek
Wedding" would make more money than his big studio film "Road To
Perdition." Nor did HBO.</TE>
<TE>   "None of us anticipated this level of success. It's obviously
exceeded everyone's wildest dreams," HBO chief Chris Albrecht said.</TE>
<TE>   HBO will air "Greek Wedding" sometime next year and will release
the video and DVD though sister company Warner Home Video, also in
2003.</TE>
<TE>   HBO, Playtone and Gold Circle will each get one-third of the
profit, however, as the financiers and copyright holders, HBO and
Gold Circle will get bigger cuts because of added distribution fees.
HBO controls the U.S. video, DVD and television distribution rights,
while Gold Circle oversees the film's international sales.</TE>
<TE>   Another under-the-radar company that will see unexpected riches,
albeit a smaller part of the pie, is production outfit MPH, which was
the first to see potential in Vardalos' script. The company's
co-founder, Jim Milio, had written and directed a 1997 movie called
"Men Seeking Women," in which Vardalos had a minor role. The actress
begged him to take a look at her "Greek Wedding" script.</TE>
<TE>   "Nia asked me to read it," recalled Milio. "And I thought: 'An
actress with a script, help me Lord'.... I read it and thought it was
brilliant."</TE>
<TE>   Although Milio would not discuss the company's financial dealings,
sources confirm that MPH optioned her script for $500 dollars. Six
months later, the company renewed the option for another $500 and
started looking for the $1.5 million it would take to make the movie.</TE>
<TE>   When interest began to surface in mainstream Hollywood, MPH wanted
to make sure it got a stake in the action. The company bought the
script outright for $60,000 and then sold it to HBO for $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   MPH received an executive producer credit on the movie and is
guaranteed 3% of the backend profit once costs and fees are deducted.</TE>
<TE>   MPH and Vardalos' share of the profits will be paid by Playtone.</TE>
<TE>   Also striking gold is the film's U.S. distributor, IFC,
a 2-year-old start-up that released last year's steamy Mexican film "Y
Tu Mama Tambien."</TE>
<TE>   IFC was brought on board when all the other distributors passed.
IFC was initially paid a distribution fee of $200,000. When the movie
became a hit, the company got a bonus of $300,000, and its deal was
further sweetened.</TE>
<TE>   "IFC is going to see a significant seven-figure sum," Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   Goetzman, who produced Hanks' 1996 directorial debut, "That Thing
You Do," and executive produced Jonathan Demme's "Philadelphia," said
he shopped "Greek Wedding" to potential distributors "for a very long
time" but nobody was biting.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't blame anyone for passing on this movie," Goetzman said.
"Here was a picture with no stars and no hook."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Gilula, head of distribution at News Corp.-owned Fox
Searchlight Pictures, one of the many art house distributors that
turned down an opportunity to release "Greek Wedding" said the beauty
of the business is how movies can suddenly come out of nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of us who passed on the movie," he said, "still marvel at
how unpredictable the American audience is."</TE>

<HD>The Heisman Trophy Adds a New Name: Suzuki</HD>
<DH>Sports: The car maker has been a corporate sponsor, but now
it gains 'presenting rights' linking its brand to the college
football award for three years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH FRAMMOLINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Heisman Trophy, the most prestigious individual award in college
football, will now officially become "The Heisman Trophy presented by
Suzuki."</LD>
<LD>   The Japanese auto and motorcycle manufacturer announced Friday
that it has purchased the right to link its name for three years with
the statuette, college gridiron's equivalent to the Oscar. Over the
last 67 years, the Downtown Athletic Club of New York has given the
annual award to some of the game's greatest players, including O.J.
Simpson, Roger Staubach and Bo Jackson.</LD>
<LD>   For an undisclosed sum, Suzuki Motor Corp. now claims "presenting
rights" to the Heisman and will enjoy unlimited use of the symbol for
advertising campaigns and promotions. In conjunction with ESPN
Magazine, the car maker is launching a 10-stop nationwide college
football game tour of the famous figurine, starting with today's
contest between USC and the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colo.</LD>
<TE>   Sports marketing expert Rick Burton said fans, already used to
corporations tagging their names to stadiums and events such as the
Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, probably will take the commercialization of the
Heisman in stride.</TE>
<TE>   "We should all be shocked, but I guess we're not surprised," said
Burton, executive director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at
the University of Oregon. "There are no sacred icons left. Short of
the Super Bowl, the Stanley Cup and the World Series, just about
everything has been sold."</TE>
<TE>   Heisman officials said Friday they didn't think twice about
allowing a foreign corporation to link its name with an American
icon. They said Suzuki already has been a corporate sponsor for three
years and beat out other auto companies for the honor and struck the
deal through its American operation based in Brea. They also stressed
that the agreement makes sure the Heisman name remains "clean"
because it precedes Suzuki's, unlike sports marketing sponsorships
that put a business' name first.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's selling out anywhere," said Jim Corcoran, athletic club
president. "Suzuki stepped up and wanted to take it [sponsorship] to
another level."</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki executives said they will mark the agreement by unveiling a
new logo that combines the company's name with the Heisman. They said
about 10% of their advertising will include the new logo or mention
the Heisman, which they said represents "excellence, longevity,
quality and durability."</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to link up with a well-known, well-respected brand
because we feel we have that as well," said Alan Bethke, automotive
business account manager for American Suzuki.</TE>
<TE>   Bethke said the company also will run the only official Web site
where fans can vote for their favorite football player. Suzuki will,
in turn, submit the winner's name as the lone "fan ballot" allowed
among those cast by more than 900 eligible sportswriters and former
Heisman winners. This will be the third year Suzuki has voted, a
privilege it negotiated under its previous sponsorship.</TE>

<HD>Regulators Take Over Another HMO</HD>
<DH>Health care: State seizes control of San Jose-based
Lifeguard, whose financial condition has deteriorated. The action
comes on the heels of a collapsed merger deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California regulators Friday seized control of financially troubled
Lifeguard Inc., a not-for-profit HMO with 168,000 members mainly in
Silicon Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Lifeguard is the fourth HMO to be taken over by the Department of
Managed Health Care in the last two years. Its financial woes reflect
the particularly acute pressures that smaller, regional HMOs face in
this climate of soaring health costs.</LD>
<LD>   Although regulators said none of the state's other health
maintenance organizations are in violation of state financial
requirements, industry analysts and reports indicate that several
other smaller health plans are struggling. The number of HMOs in
California and nationally has been shrinking, a trend that analysts
expect will continue as more smaller health insurers are acquired or
dissolved because they don't have the negotiating power or capital to
compete.</LD>
<TE>   "In many areas, consumers are faced with a lack of choices as it
is now. And it's only going to get worse," said Melissa Gannon, an
analyst at Weiss Ratings Inc., an independent insurance rating firm
in Palm Beach Garden, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose-based Lifeguard, which has been around since 1977 and
catered to high-end employers such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard, lost
$24 million last year. In recent months, its financial condition was
rapidly deteriorating. At the end of July, its net tangible assets
were $11.5 million short of the capital required by regulators.</TE>
<TE>   "They were reaching a point where if we waited any longer, patient
care could have been threatened," said Steven Fisher, a deputy
director at the Department of Managed Health Care. He said the
takeover and the appointment of a conservator would not immediately
affect any Lifeguard members.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at Lifeguard did not return calls Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The department's action came less than a month after Lifeguard's
deal to merge with Blue Shield of California fell apart. The merger
would have given Lifeguard immediate access to credit and the
resources of a large, stable health plan. Neither side said why the
deal collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators said the conservator for Lifeguard, attorney Richard
Diamond, would assess the HMO's business and make decisions about the
company's future, including its ability to continue. Two of the three
HMOs taken over by the department, Tower Health and Maxicare Health
Plans, eventually closed their doors. The third, Watts Health Plans,
remains in conservatorship.</TE>
<TE>   Lifeguard is unusual among HMOs in California because it pays its
doctors on a fee-for-service basis, instead of capitated or monthly
per-member fees other HMOs pay to doctors' groups. But that
arrangement also made Lifeguard more vulnerable at a time of rapid
cost increases. Lifeguard also lacked the size to manage and spread
its risks over a wider pool of members.</TE>

<HD>Dow Ends Down for 3rd Day; Nasdaq, S&amp;P Gain Ground</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Earnings warnings and concerns about the
strength of the recovery hurt shares. The three major indexes are
down for the week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A spate of mostly bad news Friday--ranging from an earnings warning
from Honeywell International to falling consumer confidence--sent the
Dow industrials lower for a third day. Tech stocks advanced, but the
market's three major indexes still posted a third straight weekly
loss.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said investors remained worried about a war with Iraq as
well as the strength of the economic recovery. A government report
showing strong retail sales helped lessen the anxiety but was not
enough to outweigh the day's other bad news.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a combination of poor earnings, some uncertainty about
[terrorism] and a little more evidence that consumers don't seem to
be as confident," said Robert Harrington, co-head of listed block
trading at UBS Warburg.</LD>
<TE>   "That could mean more softness in the economy."</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 66.72 points, or 0.8%, to
close at 8,312.69. That came after a 2.4% decline Thursday and a 0.3%
dip Wednesday, the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The broader market finished higher for the day. The tech-laden
Nasdaq composite index gained 11.72 points, or 0.9%, to 1,291.40,
having fallen 2.7% in the previous session. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index rose 2.90 points, or 0.3%, to 889.81, after a drop of 2.5% on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Winners edged losers by about 5 to 4 on Nasdaq and the New York
Stock Exchange. Volume, though up from recent sessions, remained
muted.</TE>
<TE>   The three major market gauges posted their third straight weekly
decline for the first time since the period ended June 21. For the
week, the Dow lost 1.4%, Nasdaq declined 0.3% and the S&amp;P fell 0.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said terrorism remained a concern for investors. In south
Florida, three people in two cars were detained and a cross-state
highway was shut down after a woman reported hearing the men talk
about going to Miami and "bringing it down." Authorities later
blasted open what appeared to be a backpack from one of the vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the University of Michigan on Friday said consumer
sentiment in September fell to 86.2 from the previous month's figure
of 87.6. Analysts were expecting a higher reading of 87.0.</TE>
<TE>   But the Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose 0.8%
in August, driven largely by a big jump in auto sales. The solid
showing caught analysts by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department also said its producer price index, which
measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, was
unchanged in August, compared with a 0.2% drop in July. The lack of
inflation pressures has been a main reason the Federal Reserve has
been able to leave interest rates at a 40-year low.</TE>
<TE>   "The overall economy is just not hitting the numbers," said
Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities.
After weeks of declines, "the market has a higher risk premium, so it
just can't tolerate the bad news," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings warnings also dragged down stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Dow member Honeywell fell $4.78, or 17%, to $23.56 after the
diversified manufacturer lowered its third-quarter outlook. The
announcement pressured other manufacturing companies, including
United Technologies, which declined $3.10 to $58, and General
Electric, which fell 95 cents to $27.05.</TE>
<TE>   Airline stocks tumbled after analysts widened their loss estimates
for the group. American Airlines parent AMR fell $1.53 to $7.36, a
low not seen since 1988. Delta Air Lines slipped 99 cents to $14.97
and Continental Airlines lost 36 cents to $8.55.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent Technologies dropped 39 cents to $1.26 after the
telecommunications company said it expects weak fourth-quarter
revenue because of soft consumer spending. ESS Technology, a Fremont,
Calif.-based chip maker, fell $3.55, or 32%, to $7.68 after saying
fourth-quarter profit will fall short of estimates. Rival Microchip
Technology fell $1.70 to $16.95 and Zoran was off $1.74 to $11.50.</TE>
<TE>   But tech issues got a boost from Adobe Systems, which rose $2.32
to $20.77 after meeting lowered third-quarter earnings expectations
and reporting that its finances should remain stable in the months
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Yields on Treasury securities fell on the consumer confidence
report, although the dollar strengthened against the euro and the
yen. Gold prices dipped while oil prices recouped Thursday's losses
as tensions over Iraq escalated.</TE>

<HD>Unions at Ports to Address Rivalry</HD>
<DH>Labor: Leaders will meet to discuss jurisdiction questions
on the West Coast. The dispute has flared as dockworkers seek support
in talks with shipping lines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several national labor leaders will meet in San Francisco on Sunday
hoping to quietly settle a dispute that threatens union solidarity on
the West Coast waterfront.</LD>
<LD>   The private meeting is set to bring together the presidents of the
dockworkers and machinists unions, with AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer
Richard Trumka mediating. It highlights a long-running rivalry for
jobs at the ports, which flared recently as the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union sought labor support in its protracted
contract negotiations with shipping lines.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the International Assn. of Machinists threatened to
cross ILWU picket lines if a strike were called unless the
jurisdictional questions were resolved. The tussle illustrates the
pressure felt by the unions as they attempt to hold on to well-paying
blue-collar jobs.</LD>
<TE>   The machinists union claims the ILWU has been raiding its
jurisdiction by taking jobs that traditionally were represented by
the IAM. At least 300 of its members have lost repair and maintenance
jobs on the docks to ILWU members, and as many as 900 more such jobs
are at risk. It says the ILWU's current contract proposal would
accelerate that job loss.</TE>
<TE>   The longshore union says contract language entitles it to
represent mechanics. ILWU spokesman Steve Stallone acknowledged the
long-standing dispute and said it was being resolved through the
AFL-CIO, the national federation of unions.</TE>
<TE>   But IAM officials said that until they took their complaints
public last week, they had been stonewalled by longshore officials.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, machinists union President Tom Buffenbarger called
together leaders of other affected unions, including the
International Union of Operating Engineers and the Seafarers
International Union, in an attempt "to force the ILWU to cease and
desist raiding our jurisdiction of work on the West Coast
waterfronts."</TE>
<TE>   Longshore union President James Spinosa declined to meet with the
group, saying it would not be "productive or appropriate," but
offered in writing to meet with Buffenbarger individually. Sunday
will be their first meeting since then.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute dates back more than two decades. Mechanics at the
port, who work on cranes, trucks and other equipment, were
traditionally represented by the machinists union. But in 1978, the
ILWU insisted on contract language that put future maintenance and
repair jobs under its jurisdiction. The rapid growth of terminals in
recent years has accelerated the transfer of jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Machinists union officials said they were rankled by recent
longshore appeals for union solidarity in contract talks with
shipping lines and terminal operators, which began in May. Protests
by their union and others torpedoed a resolution of solidarity with
the ILWU proposed at a California Labor Federation convention this
summer. The national AFL-CIO passed a similar resolution weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   A Labor Day march by ILWU members in Wilmington was briefly
interrupted by machinists, who unfurled a banner demanding the union
"stop raiding our jobs." Days later, machinists in Oakland handed out
fliers mocking the longshore union motto, "An injury to one is an
injury to all."</TE>
<TE>   The mediation by Trumka, which was confirmed by the AFL-CIO, comes
as both unions are embroiled in difficult negotiations centering on
job security. The machinists union is considering a strike against
Boeing Co. after failing to gain job guarantees in recent contract
talks covering 25,000 workers--half the number of just five years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   And the longshore union is making little headway in negotiations
with West Coast shipping lines and terminal operators, which employ
about 10,500 ILWU members. The shipping lines are demanding the
introduction of technology that would eliminate hundreds of union
jobs.</TE>

<LD>France Telecom, nearly drowning in debt and forced to hunt for new
leadership after the resignation of its chairman, announced a record
loss of nearly $12 billion in the first half and the end of its
costly funding for German cell phone affiliate Mobilcom.</LD>
<LD>   The worrisome state of the French telecommunications giant's
finances prompted the French government, France Telecom's majority
shareholder, to announce that it would pump new cash into the company
and not let it fail.</LD>
<LD>   Michel Bon, who submitted his resignation at a France Telecom
board meeting Thursday, joined a growing list of telecom chiefs to
have lost their jobs in the economic crunch hurting the industry.</LD>
<TE>   France Telecom said Bon resigned because of the scale of the
company's loss: $11.9 billion for the first half of the year. That
compared with a net profit of $1.91 billion in the year-ago period.
The company said its debt grew to $68.3 billion.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Napster Inc. creditors won two more weeks to solicit bids for the
company's assets and stave off liquidation. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Peter Walsh delayed ruling until Sept. 27 on a motion by federal
officials to shut the firm down for good.</LD>
<LD>   A committee of unsecured creditors, including one of Napster's
former law firms, said bid solicitor Trenwith Securities had received
strong "expressions of intent" from companies willing to bid millions
of dollars for Napster's technology and other assets.</LD>
<LD>   Napster Chief Financial Officer Lyn Jensen probably will remain
the Redwood City, Calif., company's sole employee until the bids are
firmed up and the creditors "pick a horse to ride" from among them,
said creditors' attorney Scott Cousins.</LD>
<TE>   The song-swapping service filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization in June after judges ordered the service shut during a
copyright infringement suit by music publishers and the major record
labels.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Konrad Hilbers laid off nearly all Napster
employees and resigned last week after Walsh blocked a planned asset
sale to German media conglomerate Bertelsmann.</TE>

<HD>J.P. Morgan's Fraud Claims Are Rejected</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge dismissed J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.'s claims of fraud
against 11 insurers, dealing a setback to the bank's effort to
collect $965 million for losses on gas and oil trades with Enron
Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The insurers, which guaranteed trades between a bank entity,
Mahonia Ltd., and Enron, refused to pay when the energy trader filed
for bankruptcy protection, saying the deals were shams designed to
hide loans to Enron. J.P. Morgan alleged that the insurers knew the
trades were a form of financing and fraudulently induced the bank to
use surety bonds even though they knew such bonds are not permitted
for financial transactions.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff allowed J.P. Morgan to take its
breach-of-contract claim against the insurers to trial. He didn't
explain his reasoning for throwing out the fraud claims, which were
added to the case in July.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of J.P. Morgan gained 3 cents to close at $22.04 on the
NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Lantronix to Lay Off 20% of Work Force</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lantronix Inc., said it would lay off more than 20% of its work
force, about 50 employees, after recording a substantial loss.</LD>
<LD>   The Irvine maker of computer network services, which is being
investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for accounting
irregularities, said the cuts are part of a restructuring program
that will result in savings of $12 million a year and a charge of $3
million to $5 million in the current quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Lantronix said its fourth-quarter net loss of $72.5 million, or
$1.35 a share, was due mostly to one-time charges related to the
impairment of goodwill and other items. In the year-ago quarter,
Lantronix lost $5.8 million, or 15 cents a share. Revenue fell 10% to
$11.5 million.</LD>
<TE>   Lantronix also plans to forgive more than $4 million in loans to
former executives, including $1.3 million to former Chief Financial
Officer Steven V. Cotton and $3.4 million to former CEO Frederick
Theil, who left the company this month. The company fired Cotton in
May, when it acknowledged that it had inflated revenue by about $6.2
million.</TE>

<HD>Secondhand Smoke Damage Award Slashed</HD>
<DH>Tobacco: A judge calls a $5.5-million judgment won by a
flight attendant for persistent health problems 'shocking' and cuts
it to $500,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Miami judge Friday slashed by 91% a $5.5-million award to a flight
attendant claiming injury from secondhand smoke, saying the size of
the compensatory damages was shocking.</LD>
<LD>   Philip Morris USA, a unit of Philip Morris Cos. and one of the
main defendants in the case decided in June, welcomed the reduction
but said its lawyers would appeal the remaining $500,000 award to a
higher court.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling, which an attorney for plaintiff Lynn French said may
be challenged, is the latest setback for flight attendants pressing
claims from a $350-million settlement with Big Tobacco of a
class-action suit in Miami.</LD>
<TE>   The 1998 settlement gave no money to the flight attendants but
allowed nonsmoking attendants to seek compensatory judgments for
injuries they claim were caused by cigarette smoke aboard aircraft.
Lawyers for tobacco companies argue that the ailments have other
causes.</TE>
<TE>   Another Miami jury last week cleared cigarette makers of liability
in a lawsuit brought by a former American Airlines flight attendant
who has bronchitis, asthma, lung problems and the ongoing nose and
sinus ailments called sinusitis.</TE>
<TE>   Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Fredricka G. Smith said Friday that the
chronic sinusitis that French, 56, blamed on tobacco smoke aboard the
jets she flew on during the 1970s and 1980s, before a 1990 ban on
cigarettes was put in place, had weighed lightly on her life.</TE>
<TE>   The judge acknowledged French's surgery, persistent discomfort and
use of medications but said French "continued to work as a flight
attendant, full time, while successfully balancing her duties as a
mother and wife."</TE>
<TE>   Smith said, "In view of the evidence of the plaintiff's pain and
suffering, the award of $5.5 million is, indeed, shocking."</TE>
<TE>   One of French's attorneys in Miami, Marvin Weinstein, said he was
studying Smith's 12-page ruling and may seek a new trial solely in
regard to damages.</TE>

<HD>Underage Smoking Case Is Dismissed</HD>
<DH>Tobacco: A California judge says cigarette advertising
enjoys 1st Amendment protection even if some ads appeal to children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tobacco companies won a legal victory in San Diego, where a state
court judge dismissed a billion-dollar class-action suit that sought
compensation for Californians who took up smoking before the legal
age of 18.</LD>
<LD>   In throwing out the case, Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Prager
said cigarette advertising enjoys free-speech protections under the
1st Amendment, even if some ads appeal to kids.</LD>
<LD>   In a companion ruling, the judge also declared that the suit
against Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown &amp;
Williamson Tobacco Co. and Lorillard Tobacco Co. was preempted by the
federal cigarette labeling act that specified the warnings that
appear on cigarette packs and ads.</LD>
<TE>   Trial of the case, known as Daniels vs. Philip Morris, had been
expected this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Although not binding on courts in other states, the decision was a
setback for lawyers and health groups that have sought to hold
cigarette makers legally responsible for underage smoking, which they
say the industry has encouraged with ads portraying smoking as
glamorous and cool.</TE>
<TE>   Industry lawyers are certain to cite Prager's reasoning in other
big cases in Illinois, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia
involving cigarette marketing practices.</TE>
<TE>   Prager's decision came in a pair of preliminary rulings Thursday.
He set a Sept. 30 hearing for plaintiffs to seek reconsideration.
John F. "Mickey" McGuire, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said if their
argument fails, they expect to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the court's reasoning is correct and fairly applies
the constitutional principles raised by such litigation," said
William S. Ohlemeyer, associate general counsel for Philip Morris.</TE>
<TE>   The suit was filed in 1998; in December 2000, Prager certified a
class of all Californians who were under 18 and smoked any time in a
nearly six-year period from April 1994 through 1999. McGuire said an
estimated 1.5 million smokers are members of the class.</TE>
<TE>   The suit accused tobacco companies of violating the state Unfair
Competition Law's ban on deceptive advertising. By using positive
messages to promote popular brands such as Marlboro, Camel, Newport
and Kool cigarettes to youths, the companies aided and abetted the
illegal sale of tobacco to kids, the complaint said.</TE>
<TE>   It sought to require cigarette makers to reimburse underage
smokers for money spent on cigarettes, and to pay the costs of
smoking cessation programs.</TE>
<TE>   At first blush, the ruling appeared at odds with a recent decision
by Prager against R.J. Reynolds. In June, he fined the company $20
million for targeting youths in magazine ads in violation of the
legal settlement between tobacco companies and state attorneys
general in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer had sued the company, claiming it
had violated its pledge to take no action "directly or indirectly, to
target youth," by running ads in magazines with large numbers of
young readers. Prager said RJR could not argue that the restrictions
infringed on its free speech rights, because it had agreed to them in
the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Prager said, the Daniels claims would punish
cigarette makers for advertising that is protected by the 1st
Amendment and that "is neither deceptive nor related to an unlawful
activity."</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs "have adduced no ads that say 'Kids, get your
Camels here,' or 'Cool kids smoke Kools,' " he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Prager said, "apart from asserting the defendants'
advertising is misleading and deceptive ... because it associates
smoking with 'glamorous,' 'cool,' 'strong,' 'macho,' 'tough' and
'sophisticated' images ... that have 'sex appeal'... plaintiffs point
to no other allegedly misleading or deceptive information contained
in the ads."</TE>
<TE>   Prager also cited a ruling last year by the U.S. Supreme Court
that limits on outdoor advertising imposed by Massachusetts were
unconstitutional. Quoting from the decision in that case, Lorillard
vs. Reilly, Prager said the government's interest in protecting
children "does not justify an unnecessarily broad suppression of
speech."</TE>
<TE>   Also pending before Prager is another tobacco class action called
the Brown case, which seeks to hold the industry liable for its
marketing practices. Some observers said that based on Prager's
reasoning in Daniels, the Brown case seems in jeopardy too.</TE>

<HD>French Auditors to Investigate Vivendi</HD>
<DH>Media: Decision comes after a newspaper report that the
firm pressured its auditor. Former CEO Messier says he will sue the
publication.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A French auditor group will look into allegations of ethical breaches
involving Vivendi Universal after the newspaper Le Monde said the
media giant had attempted to pressure its French auditor,
Salustro-Reydel.</LD>
<LD>   The Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes will set up a
committee of three independent experts to look into allegations in a
Le Monde story that Vivendi pressured Salustro-Reydel to account for
the sale of its shares in British Sky Broadcasting Group by using a
method originally proposed by its U.S. auditor, Arthur Andersen.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation, which will be carried out in partnership with
the French stock market regulator, will be completed within a month,
the auditor group said.</LD>
<TE>   Former Vivendi Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier said he would
sue Le Monde over the story, the French daily said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Messier faces a lawsuit by shareholder group Appac over how
Vivendi presented its accounts while he was in charge.</TE>
<TE>   The Commission des Operations des Bourse, the stock market
regulator, also is investigating how Vivendi has presented its
financial accounts since January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Chief Executive Jean-Rene Fourtou aims to sell about $10
billion in assets after Messier transformed the 149-year-old utility
into a global media company--ratcheting up $19 billion in debt in the
process.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi owns Universal Studios, Universal Music and stakes in
Canal Plus, Europe's biggest pay-television company, and Cegetel,
France's biggest mobile phone company.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou will outline his strategy for the company at a Sept. 25
board meeting in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Fourtou met in New York with executives of Vivendi's
entertainment operations. And on Friday, Fourtou toured the Universal
Studios lot by golf cart, accompanied by Vivendi Universal
Entertainment Chairman Barry Diller and studio chief Ron Meyer.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Vivendi would run out of cash by the end of November
without new loans. And Vivendi Universal's banks will demand the
company repay them with proceeds from asset sales as a condition for
a $2.94-billion loan, bankers involved in the talks said.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi is negotiating with Citigroup Inc., Societe Generale, BNP
Paribas and at least four other financial institutions. An agreement
on the loan may be reached next week, the bankers said.</TE>
<TE>   "Banks aren't taking any chances," said Duncan Warwick-Champion, a
credit analyst at UBS Warburg in London. "That's why they need extra
security on the new loan."</TE>
<TE>   A group of buyout firms has made an offer of about $3.4 billion
for Vivendi's publishing unit, which includes Houghton Mifflin Co.</TE>
<TE>   Separately Friday, Vivendi Environnement agreed to sell the
equipment distribution business of its U.S. Filter Corp. unit to two
buyout companies for $620 million to cut debt and focus on water
supply.</TE>
<TE>   The utility, which until June was majority-owned by Vivendi
Universal, is selling parts of Palm Desert-based U.S. Filter after
slowing demand at the unit eroded profit.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas H. Lee Partners and J.P. Morgan Partners will buy the
Waterworks Distribution Group, which supplies pumps, pipes, valves
and water meters, Paris-based Vivendi Environnement said.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's shares fell 66 cents to $13.12 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Detainees--A story in Tuesday's A section on the detention of
terrorism suspects reported that Japanese Americans placed in U.S.
internment camps were held for the duration of World War II. In fact,
the U.S. government issued a proclamation Dec. 17, 1944, ending the
mass imprisonment. However, according to the Japanese American
National Museum, only one of the 10 main camps, in Denson, Ariz., was
closed before the war ended with Japan's surrender on Aug. 14, 1945.
The rest of the camps closed over the period from October 1945 to
March 1946.</LD>

<LD>School authority--A story in the California section Thursday about
cooperation between Los Angeles City Hall and the Los Angeles Unified
School District implied that the mayors of New York and Chicago used
their own authority to gain more control of their cities' education
systems. As in some other U.S. cities, both mayors strongly pushed
for such control, but their respective state legislatures awarded it
to them.</LD>

<HD>Angola Gets a Shot at Peace</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angola, playground for other nations' armies and graveyard of failed
peace treaties, now appears to have a cease-fire. The military wing
of the main remaining rebel movement disbanded several weeks ago, a
promising indication that the country of beautiful beaches and
devastated countryside can start to rebuild.</LD>
<LD>   The birth of what could become real peace came in February, with
the death of Jonas Savimbi, founder of the surviving rebel band
UNITA, or the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
UNITA began fighting for power even before the country broke free
from Portugal in 1975. South Africa backed Savimbi's forces in the
early days; Cuban troops assisted the People's Movement for the
Liberation of Angola, which formed the government and continued to
fight Savimbi. After the rebel leader's death, the government and
UNITA agreed to end the war.</LD>
<LD>   The decades of bloodshed resulted in what the United Nations calls
the world's highest proportion of "internal refugees," an estimated
4.5 million people living in temporary shelters far from their
villages. U.N. refugee officials say an additional 450,000 Angolans
are in refugee camps in Zambia and other neighboring countries.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell visited Angola and
met with the nation's president, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who had
been Savimbi's chief rival. Powell told the president that the nation
needs to end the corruption that rakes off an estimated $1 billion of
the $6 billion it earns each year from oil revenues. The country has
significant oil reserves, and an end to the fighting could allow it
to greatly increase production.</TE>
<TE>   Powell also met with a commission working to make sure the
agreement to end the civil war is carried out effectively. He
promised aid to help resettle rebel soldiers and urged reconciliation
between the government and UNITA.</TE>
<TE>   That will be difficult. UNITA disbanded its military wing in
August, but its former fighters and their former opponents remain
bitter. Oil revenues could create jobs for the onetime soldiers. Jobs
would let them feed their families and steer them away from banditry.
There's certainly plenty to do, from clearing the mines that litter
the landscape to planting crops on ground chewed up by war.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Angolan armies routinely violated cease-fires. But
the death of Savimbi gives this one a chance for success. So does the
weariness of a nation that has seen half a million people killed in a
quarter-century. Dos Santos should understand that the United States
and other nations will provide assistance, but only if it is used to
feed and house people and rebuild the country, not to enrich corrupt
officials.</TE>

<LD>Law enforcement has the right to hunt down and capture terrorists to
put a stop to their merciless mass murder. But political expression
deserves to be free, even when spewed by the political wing of a vile
terrorist organization.</LD>
<LD>   In Madrid, Judge Baltasar Garzon thinks differently. On Aug. 26,
Garzon ordered a three-year suspension of the political activities of
Batasuna, the Basque region's second-largest political party. The
judge's order calls for the confiscation of Batasuna property and
banning of its demonstrations and public meetings.</LD>
<LD>   Garzon's order only inflames an old and bitter conflict between
Madrid and the Basques of northern Spain. The Basque conflict began
in earnest in 1959, the year that ETA, a Basque radical-left
paramilitary organization, was born. In calling for independence,
ETA's violent campaign has claimed about 800 lives since 1968.
Batasuna is widely considered to be the political wing of ETA.</LD>
<TE>   The United States, the European Union and the Spanish government
consider ETA, short for Basque Homeland and Freedom, a terrorist
organization. Since the mostly Marxist group rescinded its
self-imposed 14-month cease-fire in November 1999, ETA members have
resumed killing Spanish government officials, police officers,
journalists and military personnel. They also have put bombs in
highly populated areas and have killed scores of civilians.</TE>
<TE>   The Basque country was granted autonomy in 1980, and a 1986 ruling
by the Spanish Supreme Court legalized Batasuna as a political party
after six years of efforts by the Spanish government to block its
legalization.</TE>
<TE>   What triggered the latest suspension of Batasuna was its
consistent refusal to condemn terrorist activities, including the
latest one Aug. 4, in which a car bomb killed a 6-year-old girl in
her home and a man standing on a corner waiting for a bus and left
more than 25 people wounded. ETA claimed responsibility for the
bombing about a week later.</TE>
<TE>   Cracking down on military wings of political parties that
participate in violent activities is warranted, but prohibiting
gatherings and speech in the public square just drives them
underground. Spain must deal with ETA. But it cannot do that
effectively by clamping down on Batasuna and its right to nonviolent
protest.</TE>

signs that propping up the struggling economy might be hazardous to
consumers' long-term financial health.</LD>
<LD>   The shopping spree has floated on low inflation, consumer-friendly
tax policy and low-cost financing. And when consumers run out of
money, they have taken advantage of the lowest interest rate levels
in decades to secure home loan refinancings that free up additional
cash.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer spending drives two-thirds of the nation's economic
activity and largely has been countering the gap created by a lack of
business investment. The automobile industry this year could
challenge 2001, the second-best sales year on record, and rising
housing prices have some economists worried that a pricing bubble is
about to burst.</LD>
<TE>   Statistics, though, paint a worrisome picture of increasingly
overextended consumers. Housing payments, when measured as a
percentage of disposable personal income, are at record highs. Toss
in credit cards and other obligations and consumers are spending a
record percentage of their household income on debt. Homeowners
who've lost jobs and missed payments have pushed the foreclosure rate
on residential properties to the highest level in more than 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   One measure of consumer confidence is the popularity of
interest-only home loans, with low interest rates for the first few
years and lower monthly payments because payments initially are
applied only to interest, not principal. Homeowners playing this
risky game hope prices go up, so they can sell for a handsome profit
after a few years of low payments. The risk is that they could also
end up owing much more than their homes are worth.</TE>
<TE>   Billions of dollars flowing into vacation homes, Las Vegas
getaways and kitchen renovations also come at the expense of college
education funds, rainy day savings accounts and retirement planning.
But there are signs that the "what, me worry?" attitude is starting
to fade.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Michigan in August reported that its widely
watched consumer survey uncovered more concern about lost household
wealth than at any time in the survey's 50-year history.</TE>
<TE>   Total bankruptcy filings during the fiscal year ended June 30 hit
1.5 million, breaking the record set in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Optimists say the economy's strongman can use wealth accumulating
in homes to keep the performance going indefinitely. But that sounds
suspiciously like the stock market logic that pushed "irrational
exuberance" into the lexicon. And as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan recently noted, it's difficult to identify a bubble until
after it bursts.</TE>

<LD>Re "With the Cats Away, Beachfront Rodents Have a Field Day," Sept.
9: As my daughter would say, "Duh!" Whose bright (not) idea was it to
eradicate the cats? It is a fact that feral cats keep rats away. In
many places in our country, the latest addition being the downtown
L.A. flower mart, feral cats are kept for this purpose. They don't
like people and stay out of sight by day. When night falls, the rats
don't come out. In fact, because of the scent of the cats, the rats
are usually totally gone within weeks.</LD>
<LD>   We have cats on the jetty in Oxnard, and I, for one, have never
seen a rat or a mouse. It is imperative that humans stop trying to
change the balance of nature by the beach. It is imperative that
regular feeding of any beach critters be stopped and/or banned--if
common sense doesn't prevail.</LD>

<HD>After 9/11, Address Muslim Societies' Ills</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "For Many Muslims, Bin Laden Remains a Scapegoat of the U.S.,"
Sept. 11: Although in many Muslim countries there is deep denial that
Osama bin Laden and his terror network were responsible for the
attacks on 9/11, this is not the case with the American Muslim
community. As a board member of two major Muslim organizations, the
Muslim Public Affairs Council and the Council of Pakistan American
Affairs, and a columnist for a major ethnic newspaper, I have never
doubted the guilt of Al Qaeda. American Muslims stand in complete
solidarity with our fellow citizens and want to see this country
protected against any repeat of last year's tragedies.</LD>
<LD>   The deep denial of Bin Laden's guilt in the Muslim world stems
from poor knowledge of the outside world, suspicion of the U.S. and
dislike of its foreign policy and a lack of adequate press coverage
that details the overwhelming public evidence of guilt. But the
biggest factors are shame and embarrassment over this horrible
tragedy and an unwillingness to confront fully what these actions
tell us about the state of Muslim societies.</LD>
<TE>   Muslim societies have tremendous social problems that are slowly
being addressed. But the present reality is one of weakness and
profound dysfunction, and the attacks of 9/11 highlight how
dysfunctional and out of step with reality they have become. The
proper response is introspective analysis followed by reform, but
this path is cut off by lack of freedom in these dictatorial
societies. So instead, the path of least resistance is chosen:
denial.</TE>
<TE>   If we go ahead with President Bush's plans to topple Saddam
Hussein, then we as a nation must commit ourselves to nation-building
of the intense variety that transformed Nazi Germany and Imperial
Japan after World War II. A truly free and democratic Iraq would
allow a portion of the Arab world to begin to deal with these
difficult issues.</TE>
<TE>   Nayyer Ali</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The insistence by Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge and Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft that Americans should defiantly go about their
everyday lives in the face of the new terrorist threats seems
ludicrous and hypocritical because the same threats forced our
fearless Vice President Dick Cheney to cancel his Sept. 11
appearances and go into hiding.</TE>
<TE>   As Americans we should instead follow the example of a true hero,
Buzz Aldrin: When confronted by an irrational zealot, punch him on
the nose and walk on (Sept. 10).</TE>
<TE>   Brian Christian</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Those of us old enough to recall Dec. 7, 1941, with clarity also
recall that Dec. 7, 1942, brought none of the remembering and
memorializing that Sept. 11 brought. Of course, many more
people--civilians--were killed in 2001, but still, Dec. 7 was a
tremendous shock. Instead, we buckled down and really went to war.</TE>
<TE>   The response this time can't be as targeted, true, but the media
have been truly maudlin-plus in all the replays.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Freeway Labor Isn't Just Construction Work" (Sept. 10), on the
increase in freeway births: While it is heartwarming to read about
the stories of successful births that happen on our local freeways,
this statistic is a sad commentary on the state of our health-care
system. As local hospitals and emergency rooms close their doors
because they are no longer "profitable," people have to drive farther
and farther to get emergency medical help.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, women have been giving birth on their own since the
dawn of time, and this can occur successfully even in the back seat
of a compact car in rush-hour traffic. But what about the person who
has a heart attack?</LD>
<LD>   Amid all the other crises of our day, we need to realize that our
health-care system is failing us. Premiums rise, HMOs pull out of
plans, hospitals close and the ranks of the uninsured grow. In L.A.
County we can do something about it by voting to support the November
ballot measure to save our trauma centers, but that only addresses
one part of a much bigger problem. When are we going to realize that
allowing our health care to be left to the fickle market is just not
working?</LD>

<LD>Perhaps Ventura could spend less than $74,000 annually to clean up

graffiti inside storm drains ("Tough Graffiti Sentence May Send a

<HD>Peter Barton, 51; Executive Built Key Cable TV Firm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Barton, a pioneering cable TV executive who became the founding
president of cable television programmer Liberty Media Corp., has
died. He was 51.</LD>
<LD>   Barton died of gastric cancer Sunday at his home in Denver.</LD>
<LD>   A top aide to New York Gov. Hugh Carey in the 1970s, Barton earned
a master's degree from Harvard Business School before beginning his
career in cable television in 1982.</LD>
<TE>   Recruited as a personal assistant by John Malone, owner of the
fledgling cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., Barton spent four
years negotiating nationwide cable franchise agreements for the
Denver-based company.</TE>
<TE>   The firm, which is now part of AT&amp;T Broadband, became the nation's
largest cable operator, and the franchise deals Barton executed are
said to have had a major effect on the growth of cable channels such
as MTV.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Barton was named president of the company's Cable Value
Network, which evolved into the home shopping giant QVC.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, he became founding president and chief executive of the
Tele-Communications Inc. spinoff Liberty Media Corp., which became a
primary shareholder in major cable programming providers such as
Discovery, Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting System.</TE>
<TE>   "Peter was there at the inception of Liberty Media, and its
subsequent versions, and he was critically important in building it,"
Malone, now Liberty Media chairman, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Considered a corporate maverick, Barton was known to negotiate
business deals on the ski slopes in Vail, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Station managers were well aware that Barton kept tabs on
Liberty's estimated 1,000 affiliates at all hours. He once phoned a
station's night manager at 3 a.m. to find out why the host of a show
appeared to be stoned.</TE>
<TE>   Barton resigned from Liberty Media with a stock fortune estimated
at $100 million in 1997 to start a private investment firm and spend
more time with his family.</TE>
<TE>   He later developed the Privacy Foundation at the University of
Denver, a nonprofit consumer watchdog group to protect consumer
privacy and study the effects of technology on privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Washington, Barton earned a degree in economics from
Columbia University in 1972. He spent the next two years as a
professional skier in Colorado before returning to Washington to work
in politics.</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, he became a deputy commissioner in the state of New
York's agricultural department but quickly rose to become a top aide
to Carey.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Laura; daughter, Kate; sons Jeffrey
and Christopher; his mother, Hanna Jane Barton of Bethesda, Md.; and
brothers John A. Barton of Bethesda and Thomas W. Barton of Harbeson,
Del.</TE>

<DH>Ojai: A stepped-up effort to enforce traffic laws draws
complaints. But police chief insists that most residents are
appreciative.</DH>

<LD>Trouble's brewing in bucolic Ojai. And the guys in the black hats,
some residents say, are overzealous sheriff's deputies in police
cruisers.</LD>
<LD>   In a time when cities skimp to put more police on the street, some
residents in this quiet town of artists, giant oaks and famously pink
sunsets say they have too many cops.</LD>
<LD>   "We're over-policed," said artist Sarra Jubinville, 65, an
Ojai-area resident for 25 years. "Citizens are intimidated by the
heavy-handed and ubiquitous police presence."</LD>
<TE>   Jubinville said she has gathered 250 signatures on petitions
posted around town asking the City Council to form a citizens'
commission to stop officers from "over-exerting their authority in
what could be considered an aggressive and bullying manner."</TE>
<TE>   Jubinville plans a "town hall" meeting Oct. 2 at which residents
will be able to share their stories about what they see as police
harassment. "Democracy Is Coming to Ojai!" proclaim fliers she has
posted at the post office, playhouse and a health food store.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Capt. Gary Pentis, who functions as the Ojai police
chief, said people shouldn't make too much of what he considers an
ill-advised campaign by Jubinville and a handful of others.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little frustrating, because the [officers] at this station
do a really good job, and the public really appreciates what we do,"
Pentis said. "But we have a couple of fringe people who are stirring
things up."</TE>
<TE>   It's true, he said, that deputies more than doubled the number of
motor vehicle and pedestrian citations they wrote in Ojai during the
first half of this year, compared with the first six months of
2001--from 325 to 677.</TE>
<TE>   But that was a concerted strategy to make local motorists slow
down and follow the law, he said, and not the result of ticky-tack
enforcement aimed at raising money through fines, as critics
maintain.</TE>
<TE>   Five Ojai pedestrians, including two students crossing a street
near Nordhoff High School, have been injured by motorists in the last
12 months, the captain said. At one busy intersection, there were 14
traffic accidents because of failure to heed stop signs.</TE>
<TE>   And residents of several neighborhoods asked the City Council for
beefed-up patrols because motorists were taking shortcuts across town
and speeding down residential streets, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the City Council hired motorcycle Officer Tom
Triplett last fall to enforce traffic laws. Pentis also ordered
officers in the two patrol cars that cruise Ojai each day to step up
their enforcement of traffic and parking violations. Pentis said
Triplett writes only two or three tickets a day, about one-third the
usual for a motorcycle officer.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent months, the moves have drawn complaints from
Jubinville and others. Ojai resident John Wilcock, who publishes the
Ojai Orange newspaper, declared in a July letter to the editor of
another paper: "The drawback to a town with very little crime is that
the occupying force has to find something to do to justify their
day's 'work.' "</TE>
<TE>   Wilcock, who was ticketed three times in a month, said he wrote
his letter to let off steam, but then received about 20 calls from
other angry motorists. "Obviously, it was much deeper than I had
imagined," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Bowen, 86, said Triplett drove his motorcycle out from behind
a bush at a deserted intersection near the Nordhoff Cemetery to
ticket her, claiming that she had rolled through a stop sign at 10
mph.</TE>
<TE>   "I stopped. I had my foot on the brake," said Bowen. "I think he
was lying in wait for people like me, and he took advantage of me.
I've been driving since I was 15 years old, and I've never had a
ticket."</TE>
<TE>   But she paid her $104 fine.</TE>
<TE>   After Wilcock's letter was published, Pentis said he reviewed
hundreds of citations to see if he could find a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority I reviewed were for at least 15 miles per hour over
the speed limit. And the stop-sign violations all identified the
vehicle as running through the sign at 7 to 10 miles per hour," he
said. "So I feel very comfortable saying our [officers] are doing a
good job."</TE>
<TE>   Pentis said Wilcock is simply wrong in believing sheriff's
deputies are an occupying force, because several officers graduated
from the local public high school and 16 live in the Ojai Valley.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Rae Hanstad said she is pleased with the way
deputies have addressed a speeding problem that residents often
complained about.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm out and about in this community all the time," said Hanstad,
interim director of the Ojai Valley Museum. "And I have not heard one
complaint from a constituent."</TE>

<HD>A Bohemian Rhapsody?</HD>
<DH>'Creative class' of artists could be a key to cities'
economic development</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Florida has advice for city officials seeking to pump life
into sluggish local economies: Forget breaking your back or your
budget to lure mega malls and convention centers to town. There's a
much easier way: Recruit a healthy "creative class."</LD>
<LD>   That would include those clever bohemians, loft-dwelling artists
and skateboarding techies who made places such as the Bay Area thrive
in the late 1990s. Make no mistake, the Carnegie Mellon professor
says, the Internet bubble may have burst, but the creative class that
fueled it--nose rings, tattoos, spiked hair and all-- still reigns
when it comes to transforming a sleepy suburb or depressed downtown
into the next boomtown.</LD>
<LD>   That's the gist of Florida's best-selling book "The Rise of the
Creative Class," which has generated buzz from his ivory tower in
Pittsburgh to the economic development offices of Southern
California. His thesis has become the focus of debate among both
trend watchers and planners in cities, such as Santa Ana, Brea and
Riverside, that are seeking to revive--or create from
scratch--downtowns ravaged by decades of suburban sprawl.</LD>
<TE>   His theory discourages cities from building another "big-box"
retailer. Instead, cities serious about enlivening the local business
scene are encouraged to lure creative types with happening music
scenes, thriving gay and ethnic communities, and maybe even tax
breaks for bohemians and other artsy types who fuel the information
economy. Census information is used to make the case that cities with
a big creative class are flourishing while others remain stagnant,
depleted of creative talent thanks to a bland cultural scene.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going through a big economic change," said Florida. It used
to be that workers lived where the company was, he said, but now
"companies go where the highly skilled people live."</TE>
<TE>   Local boosters of the theory note that these are renaissance days
for diverse places with a grass-roots arts movements and funky
live-work spaces: Pasadena, Santa Monica and downtown Los Angeles.
Orange County has been able to cash in by attracting entrepreneurs to
homes among the seaside cafes of Laguna Beach or the budding arts
scene in Santa Ana. Their start-up companies fill the offices of
Irvine and Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Yet others caution chambers of commerce against recruiting new
residents at Phish concerts and the X Games. They suggest that
Florida's theory is a holdover from the heady days of the late 1990s
and no longer applies in these more conservative times.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of this thinking that the high-tech folks just want to move
into the cool district is a product of the bubble economy," said Joel
Kotkin, author of "The New Geography: How the Digital Revolution Is
Reshaping the American Landscape," a book Florida used, ironically,
in developing his creative class theory. "Saying there is a
connection between bohemianism and economic development is a stretch
now."</TE>
<TE>   Wishful liberal thinking is how Kotkin, himself a liberal,
characterizes the creative class outlook. Under its structure, the
cities that supposedly do the best are the ones that encourage gay
rights and immigration.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that Silicon Valley is not where it is because of
gay people," Kotkin said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of those guys were nerds from the Midwest who went to San
Francisco for dinner every once in a while. They liked the climate
and cleanliness of Palo Alto."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the diversity of the Bay Area did not play a major
role in its boom.</TE>
<TE>   Same with Seattle, Kotkin says, where the tech boom really
happened in more conservative Redmond.</TE>
<TE>   He questions the concept that openness and tolerance are what
makes a city attractive to the most brilliant of the New Economy--the
buzz-term for that segment focused on new computer and
telecommunication technologies.</TE>
<TE>   "They might like diversity if it means having an Indian doctor
living next door," Kotkin said. "But are they eager to have a house
crowded with three families from El Salvador next door? I don't think
so."</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: "It just doesn't make a lot sense for cities to
recruit some 27-year-old bearded guy smoking a joint and eating a
goat-cheese pizza," Kotkin said.</TE>
<TE>   So what's a city to do to bring the New Economy to town? Kotkin
urges a measured infusion of urban culture that has broad appeal. The
construction of lofts and apartments in downtown districts is a good
place to start, he says. In other words, follow the model of Santa
Monica and Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Brea did just that. And the live-work lofts and neotraditional
cottages built steps away from the shops and theaters of Birch Street
Promenade have brought a dose of the New Economy to a city long
viewed as only a bedroom community.</TE>
<TE>   "We've attracted lots of young people who not only live but also
work in those lofts," said Bev Perry, a Brea city councilwoman.
"They're attracted to them because they can work at home but also
have someplace to walk to be around people and make social
connections."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Barrier to Growth</TE>
<TE>   Demographics experts warn that it's the absence of that kind of
housing in much of the "boomburbs" surrounding Los Angeles--those
rapidly growing powerhouses that are quickly reaching big-city size
but remain suburban in character--that keeps them from cashing in on
the New Economy.</TE>
<TE>   This is especially true in cities such as Costa Mesa and Irvine,
where the economy has taken off but creative types see few attractive
housing options.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these entrepreneurial people cities are trying to attract
do not want to live in gated communities," said Ross DeVol, director
of regional studies at the Milken Institute in Santa Monica, whose
research was also used by Florida.</TE>
<TE>   While cautioning that the creative class formula may oversimplify
the way the New Economy has affected cities, DeVol applauds Florida
for at least generating public interest in the issue with a book
filled with intriguing anecdotes and breezy prose.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important for people involved with the economic community
and housing development to begin to understand that these changes are
taking place," DeVol said.</TE>
<TE>   "This 'creative class' remains important."</TE>
<TE>   His advice to Southern California cities that want a piece of the
action: Stop sprawling into the suburban fringe and work on building
hip downtown centers with dense housing mixed alongside cafes, shops
and theaters. Florida agrees that is a good place to start.</TE>
<TE>   While DeVol says Santa Monica and Pasadena are the places to copy
when it comes to recruiting creative types, others say the region's
urban core is where the action will be in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   Their money is on downtown Los Angeles--with its lofts, museums
and plentiful workspace for start-ups--as the next New Economy city
of the West.</TE>
<TE>   William Gartner, a professor of business at USC, is co-author of a
study that concludes that entrepreneurial activity is directly
related to how urban a city is--more urban equals more start-up
companies per capita.</TE>
<TE>   He says that positions downtown L.A. to come back in a big way.</TE>
<TE>   "This is no longer a Fortune 500 town, but those office buildings
are being filled with other things," Gartner said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are information companies."</TE>

<LD>An attorney and his wife were credited for their courage and quick
thinking Friday when they saw a woman being assaulted in North
Hollywood, then chased down the suspected attacker and held him until
help arrived, Los Angeles police said.</LD>
<LD>   Enrique Zuniga, a 47-year-old immigration attorney, was driving
with his wife and two children on Tujunga Avenue about 10:15 p.m.
Thursday when they saw a man hitting a 19-year-old woman, pulling her
hair and trying to remove her pants.</LD>
<LD>   "I was driving down the street and my wife said, 'Rick! Rick, stop
the car! Stop the car!' " Zuniga said. "I saw the woman trying to
escape."</LD>
<TE>   Police don't recommend what Zuniga did next.</TE>
<TE>   He jumped from his car and chased the man for half a mile with his
wife Milly, 35, in close pursuit in the couple's Chevrolet Suburban.</TE>
<TE>   She called police from her cell phone while Zuniga, who was not
hurt, held the man.</TE>
<TE>   "His actions were very dangerous because you don't know when a
suspect is armed or not and most citizens are not equipped or trained
to handle these situations," said Officer Jason Lee, a spokesman for
the Los Angeles Police Department. "At the same time, the gentleman
should be praised for his bravery."</TE>
<TE>   Kelvin Yaredy Lopez, 20, of Sun Valley was booked on suspicion of
assault and is being held at the LAPD's Van Nuys Division jail,
police said. His arraignment is scheduled for Monday.</TE>
<TE>   So what possessed Zuniga to take action? Besides pleas from his
wife and daughter to "do something," Zuniga said he has a black belt
in karate and was enraged by what he saw.</TE>
<TE>   "With all the child abductions and the rapes ... I was angry that
someone could victimize and try to rape an innocent girl," Zuniga
said. "It was surprising to see and a horrible thing to witness."</TE>

<HD>Cliff Gorman, 65; Tony-Winning Stage, Film and Television
Actor</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actor Cliff Gorman, who won a Tony Award for his portrayal of
comedian Lenny Bruce on Broadway and fashioned a steady career as a
stage, film and television actor, has died. He was 65.</LD>
<LD>   Gorman died of leukemia Sept. 5 at his home in New York City.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Queens, N.Y., Gorman attended UCLA and the University of
New Mexico, where he took drama classes.</LD>
<TE>   Gorman graduated from New York University with a degree in
education.</TE>
<TE>   After college, he worked as a probation officer, a truck driver
and an ambulance driver.</TE>
<TE>   When he wasn't working, Gorman was studying acting. He was a
member of Jerome Robbins' American Theater Lab in 1966-67.</TE>
<TE>   His career took off in 1968 after he won an Obie Award for his
off-Broadway portrayal of the flamboyant gay character Emory in "The
Boys in the Band." Gorman also played the role in the 1970 film
version.</TE>
<TE>   The 1971 Broadway play "Lenny," which followed Bruce's career as a
nightclub comedian through run-ins with the police and courts, was a
smash hit.</TE>
<TE>   Gorman's work drew strong critical notice and an enthusiastic
audience response. But the role of "Lenny" in the film version went
to Dustin Hoffman.</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, Gorman was nominated for another Tony for his role as Leo
in "Chapter Two," a semi-autobiographical play by Neil Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Gorman also was a film actor and made his screen debut in George
Cukor's adaptation of the Lawrence Durrell novel "Justine," which was
released in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Gorman also appeared in Otto Preminger's "Rosebud" (1975); "An
Unmarried Woman" (1978), with Jill Clayburgh; "Night and the City"
(1992), with Robert De Niro and Jessica Lange; and "Ghost Dog: The
Way of the Samurai" (1999).</TE>
<TE>   He played Abbie Hoffman in a 1970 British television program about
the Chicago Eight, and made guest appearances on the television shows
"Law and Order," "Murder, She Wrote" and "Police Story."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Gayle.</TE>

<LD>Concerned about Ventura County's growing housing crisis, more than
200 real estate professionals, politicians, planners and housing
advocates gathered Friday to discuss ways to create more affordable
dwellings for an expanding population.</LD>
<LD>   "Who are the people we are trying to house? They are our kids,"
said Michael McGuire, president and chief executive of Affinity Bank
in Ventura. "They are the police, the firefighters, the teachers and
nurses--the people we need to keep our communities running."</LD>
<LD>   McGuire said making more housing available for poor and
middle-income residents will require creative solutions, including
mandatory rental-property zoning and encouragement of co-ownership
between developers and tenants. Another idea, he said, is allowing
boarding houses, where seniors with large residences can rent rooms
to those unable to pay market rents.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got to stop trying to 'think outside the box.' We've got to
blow the box up," said McGuire, who also is board president of
Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit builder of
low-income housing.</TE>
<TE>   Although Ventura County's median family income has grown to
$75,000, the increase has been far outstripped by the hike in housing
prices, which have risen at an annual compound rate of 10.3% since
1995, said economist Mark Schniepp of the California Economic
Forecast in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   The median price of a Ventura County home sold in July was
$395,710, which Schniepp suggested was a relative bargain compared
with a new home's median price of $505,800.</TE>
<TE>   The anticipated demand for housing is not being met, as the
percentage of new housing being built has dropped by double digits.
The first casualty has been a virtual loss of job growth, as
employers such as Kinko's move headquarters out of state and
biotechnology giant Amgen expands not in Newbury Park but in
Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Brennan, deputy mayor of Ventura, said politicians must
alter land-use policies to accommodate various housing types so
prices can be lowered and availability increased.</TE>
<TE>   Brennan said cities should allow more mixed uses--a combination of
housing with retail or commercial shops--in well-designed
neighborhoods more densely built yet aesthetically attractive.</TE>
<TE>   Communities should be designed to encourage pedestrian traffic, be
close to public transit and have a variety of housing types to serve
the housing needs of single people, families and seniors, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A number of local politicians also spoke during the all-day
conference at the Clarion Hotel in Ventura.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana Hopes to Get a Lift From Lofts</HD>
<DH>Housing: The city is subsidizing 86 downtown units
targeting artists. Some merchants fear high rents.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana is subsidizing the construction of 86 "live-work" lofts
just off the bustling 4th Street Latino shopping district,
stylish-yet-relatively affordable living accommodations that city
leaders hope will help revitalize downtown.</LD>
<LD>   Even though the lofts have stirred up suspicion and uncertainty
among some local merchants, city Redevelopment Director John P.
Reekstin said the artists and professionals expected to move in will
bring a renewed energy--and money--that will benefit everyone
downtown.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a city-driven effort," said Reekstin. "It's something
more reflective of Los Angeles, San Diego or Long Beach. We believe
it will attract artists and drive our downtown."</LD>
<TE>   The lofts, versatile spaces that have few walls and many uses,
will be finished by the end of the year near the shopping zone and
Santa Ana's budding artists' district, and even more may be on the
way.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Urban Lofts New Here</TE>
<TE>   Urban lofts are commonplace in other cities but they're somewhat
new to Orange County, where more and more homes are ensconced in
gated communities.</TE>
<TE>   To see how artists lofts have triggered economic development in
other cities, Santa Ana officials traveled to Portland, Ore., and
toured the city's Pearl District, where lofts and a small artists
village have evolved into a dynamic attraction.</TE>
<TE>   That's what they hope will happen in downtown Santa Ana, where the
Artists Village has sprouted up alongside traditional Latino shopping
and modest homes and apartments. The Artists Village includes 12
galleries and more than 100 artists, although fewer actually live in
the city.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana artists are excited about the lofts, even though some
may be unable to buy the units that will cost between $275,000 and
$350,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fabulous. It really establishes a permanent community for
artists," artist Margie Zuliani said. "A lot of artists do resent the
cost, but that is the reality in Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   The idea of building lofts in Santa Ana dates to the late 1980s,
Reekstin said. The soft real estate market made it hard for the city
to act until last year, however, when the redevelopment agency
purchased three blocks between Main, Bush, Sycamore and 2nd streets
for $2.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Developer Gets a Subsidy</TE>
<TE>   Then officials scouted around for a developer, and picked the
Olson Co., which had built lofts in Long Beach. Santa Ana sold Olson
the downtown parcel for $900,000, basically giving the company a
$1.2-million subsidy.</TE>
<TE>   Already, there are 60 prospective buyers on a waiting list, said
Lenette Hewitt, Olson Co. sales and marketing director. The units
will be 1,500 to 2,000 square feet, and include garages. Among the
buyers, Hewitt said, are an interior decorator, an art gallery owner
and a concert violinist.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve units have already been sold. Thirty lofts will be
completed by December, she said. The city also has been contacted by
four other development firms interesting in building for units in the
area, said Matt Lamb, Santa Ana's downtown development manager.</TE>
<TE>   An additional four lofts will be built above a Save-On pharmacy on
the corner of First and Sycamore streets in Santa Ana, thanks in part
to a legal settlement over a zoning dispute between the city and a
Beverly Hills development firm, The Charles Company. The company is
expected to complete the lofts by the fall of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "Lofts are new to all of Southern California but they are popular
particularly with artists. It certainly helps us to continue the
artists district," Charles attorney Fred Gaines said.</TE>
<TE>   And there is talk of yet another loft developer looking at
property near the Artists Village.</TE>
<TE>   In the Latino shopping district, many merchants fear the lofts
will begin to "whitewash," or gentrify, downtown Santa Ana--luring
affluent professionals and upscale shops and driving out existing
residents with increasing rents.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No Input, Merchant Says</TE>
<TE>   Sam Romero, owner of St. Teresa's Catholic Shop on 4th Street,
said city officials never bothered to consult with the merchants
about the new lofts.</TE>
<TE>   "I think eventually they wouldn't mind if only a small percentage
of us survive," Romero said. "We have no input at all."</TE>
<TE>   Joann Ramirez, a Santa Ana Historical Preservation Society member,
opposes the Sav-On lofts because the project would require the
demolition of a historic building.</TE>
<TE>   "They want jazz and pizazz," Ramirez said. "They want to get rid
of the people who are there now."</TE>
<TE>   The lofts being built by the Olson Co. have given the city one of
its first real tests on balancing the needs of the established Latino
community and newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   The lofts are being built next to Festival Hall, a popular and
often noisy venue that attracts Mexican bands and their sometimes
rowdy fans. Police have responded to 46 calls at the Festival since
January and 47 calls during 2001--for everything from traffic
violations to public intoxication to public disturbances, according
to police Sgt. Baltazar de la Riva.</TE>
<TE>   To help reduce the noise, the city is installing vestibule doors
at the hall and is spending $250,000 to install air-conditioning so
the doors can remain closed. In addition, a wall will be built to
separate the lofts from the venue.</TE>
<TE>   "Fourth Street is very successful, but south of 4th Street ... we
needed to think how to revitalize and join the different elements to
create a downtown that is cohesive," Reekstin said.</TE>

units already have been sold and the first set of 30 is scheduled to

lofts to be built.</CP>

<HD>Marilyn Monroe Nude Photos Back on Market</HD>
<DH>Celebrities: After two failed efforts, a Ventura man again
seeks a buyer who is willing to pay $1.25 million for the 'Red
Velvet' series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marilyn Monroe is back on the market.</LD>
<LD>   At least some of her most famous photographs are, a series of
early nudes that once graced the pages of Playboy and helped rocket
the blond bombshell to stardom.</LD>
<LD>   After coming away empty in back-to-back efforts to sell the
so-called "Red Velvet" series, Ventura photographer Tom Kelley said
this week that he is again seeking a buyer for the world-famous
images of Monroe lounging against a ruby-red velvet curtain.</LD>
<TE>   The offer includes six images generated during the 1949 shoot that
produced the centerfold for Playboy magazine's inaugural issue. It
also includes the intellectual property rights--negatives, copyrights
and Monroe's signed release--that will allow the buyer to use the
images for trade and advertising purposes.</TE>
<TE>   "We would still like to find a buyer somewhere who fits the bill,"
said Kelley, whose photographer father, Tom Kelley Sr., took the
pictures.</TE>
<TE>   After much deliberation, Kelley and his Northern California agent,
Gary Saal, decided early last year to test the market with the Red
Velvet collection. In a move that generated international attention,
Butterfields Auctioneers in Hollywood and its then-parent company,
EBay Inc., put the images and rights on the auction block in March of
last year.</TE>
<TE>   As a collection, the photos fetched $475,000, an offer rejected as
too low. Offered individually, the photos drew bids totaling
$840,000, still below the minimum price set by Kelley of $1.25
million.</TE>
<TE>   No sale was made, and the photographs remained in Kelley's
possession.</TE>
<TE>   Then in March, Kelley and Saal found a private buyer for the
collection. But that deal recently fell through, prompting a lawsuit
filed on behalf of Tom Kelley Studios alleging breach of contract.</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, filed in July in Alameda County Superior
Court, New York-based psychic and composer Biond Fury and Biond Fury
Entertainment agreed to pay $1.25 million for the six images and
associated rights. However, Fury failed to make a $50,000 down
payment and has not made any of the $240,000 monthly payments
outlined in the sales contract, the lawsuit states.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit seeks to hold Fury liable for damages and other costs.</TE>
<TE>   "He just failed to make any payments," said Oakland attorney
Charles Drexler, who filed the suit on behalf of Tom Kelley Studios.
"We retain the right to license [the photos] and develop them for
sale."</TE>
<TE>   Contacted Friday, Fury said he didn't want to comment on the
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   However, he did say that he had several concerns about the sales
contract. He believed that the contract contained a licensing
agreement giving him the right, while the sale was unfolding, to use
one of the images to re-release a vintage Marilyn Monroe calendar. He
later found out that no such permission was granted.</TE>
<TE>   "That was my motivation in buying [the images] in the first
place," Fury said.</TE>
<TE>   Saal, president of Pacific Licensing, the agency that represents
Tom Kelley Studios and hammers out agreements for use of the Red
Velvet images, said that while the idea for a calendar project was
discussed, it was made clear from the outset that such a project
would have to be part of a separate licensing agreement until Fury
owned the images outright.</TE>
<TE>   "Once he owned [the images], he could do whatever he wanted," Saal
said. "But it was never part of the original purchase agreement."</TE>
<TE>   Now the hunt for another buyer begins. Until one is found, Kelley
won't exactly be heartbroken that the collection will remain in his
possession.</TE>
<TE>   Monroe was not yet famous when Tom Kelley Sr. first met her.</TE>
<TE>   He witnessed a minor car accident in which she had been involved
on Sunset Boulevard. He gave her $5 for cab fare and a business card
from the Hollywood photography studio where he did advertising work.</TE>
<TE>   Kelley hired her for a couple of modeling jobs before asking if
she would be interested in posing nude for the kind of cheesecake
calendars popular at that time in auto shops. When he passed away in
1984, the Monroe photographs became part of the studio's archives.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Kelley said he considered selling the photos for
several years, even as he relocated the studio to Ventura in 1992,
but the timing was never right.</TE>
<TE>   Now it is. Advances in computer technology have opened untold
opportunities to make commercial use of the images, he said. But he
also wants to share the images with a larger audience, and perhaps
bring long-overdue recognition to this area of his father's work.</TE>
<TE>   "If a qualified party is interested," he said, "we'll listen to
all available and reasonable offers."</TE>

<LD>A substitute teacher who has worked in several Orange County school
districts was arrested Friday on suspicion of sexual assault against
four teenage girls.</LD>
<LD>   Todd Jerome Haluch, 35, was arrested in Newport Beach about 11:30
a.m. on a warrant alleging 13 counts of felony sexual assault. Bail
was set at $250,000.</LD>
<LD>   According to police, the incidents--which involved at least four
girls ages 13 to 17 and took place over a period of years--came to
light after one of the girls talked about the molestation to a
therapist, who reported it to police.</LD>
<TE>   In investigating that report, detectives discovered other victims,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Haluch, of Huntington Beach, has worked as a substitute teacher in
the Newport-Mesa, Huntington Beach, Garden Grove and Los Alamitos
school districts, police said. He has not, however, been teaching
this fall.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Wesley Naylor, 44, a gospel music creator and a composer of the
gospel musical "Mama, I Want to Sing," died Aug. 25 at his home in
Brooklyn, N.Y. The cause of his death was under investigation, but
police had found no evidence of a crime, said his brother Wendell
Naylor.</LD>
<LD>   Naylor worked with Vy Higginsen and her husband, Kenneth Wydro, on
"Mama, I Want to Sing," the story of a minister's daughter who leaves
the church to become a singing star. The project became one of the
longest-running off-Broadway musicals. Naylor also composed two
sequels to the show.</LD>
<LD>   Born into a religious family in Mississippi, Naylor was trained in
gospel music at the local church, where his grandfather was the
minister. He began playing the piano at the age of 4, and was
performing at 12.</LD>
<TE>   Naylor received a scholarship to the North Carolina School for the
Performing Arts, and studied piano at the University of Southern
Mississippi and Oberlin Conservatory.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, he was the music director of the Bethany Baptist
Church in Brooklyn for nearly 25 years. He also played and arranged
gospel music for such performers as Aretha Franklin and Cee Cee
Winans.</TE>

<HD>William Phillips, 94; Editor, Co-Founder of Partisan Review</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William Phillips, co-founding editor of the cultural journal Partisan
Review, which showcased many of the mid-20th century's finest writers
and critics, including Saul Bellow, William Faulkner, Irving Howe and
Lionel Trilling, died of pneumonia at a New York hospital Friday. He
was 94.</LD>
<LD>   Founded in 1934 with the critic Philip Rahv, Partisan Review began
as an organ of the Communist Party, but soon broke ranks to pursue a
more independent path.</LD>
<LD>   A lonely but feisty voice of anti-Stalinism in the 1930s, it went
on to publish literature and political and cultural criticism from an
anti-Communist liberal perspective. Though never large in circulation
(5,000 to 7,000 copies in its glory years), it heavily influenced
intellectual discourse in America and abroad for several decades
through the 1960s.</LD>
<TE>   Among the remarkable array of writers it featured over the years
were Gertrude Stein, Franz Kafka, Albert Camus, George Orwell, Tillie
Olsen, Mary McCarthy, James Agee, Elizabeth Hardwick, Bernard
Malamud, Ralph Ellison, Doris Lessing and Norman Mailer.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a key part of a really great and influential kind of
conversation that went on for 30 or 40 years that some of the best
American and foreign writers took part in," said Susan Sontag, whose
career as a cultural critic began with Phillips at Partisan Review in
the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Leading Intellectual</TE>
<TE>   Known as an astute editor for whom argument was almost a way of
life, Phillips was one of the leading members of an early group of
New York intellectuals whose Jewishness placed them outside the
mainstream--a group that included Trilling, Rahv, Marxist philosopher
Sidney Hook and writer Dwight Macdonald.</TE>
<TE>   Partisan Review became "the original cultural organ" of the group,
said Neil Jumonville, an intellectual historian at Florida State
University, and inspired other influential journals such as Dissent
and Commentary.</TE>
<TE>   Its pages are a treasury of American leftist thought on such
topics as whether to support Britain and the West in the battle
against the Axis powers in the early 1940s or stake out a third camp.
In the postwar 1950s it opened debate over whether it was possible to
be an intellectual in a conformist society.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips, Jumonville said, played the role of intellectual
gatekeeper, one who was "very acutely perceptive about what needed to
be talked about at any one time."</TE>
<TE>   "He was a brilliant editor," said Harvard sociologist Daniel Bell,
"in the sense of trying to identify major problems in intellectual
and cultural life and getting people to [tackle] them."</TE>
<TE>   Phillips was born in Manhattan and grew up in the Bronx. His
Russian-Jewish immigrant parents separated when he was 1, and his
mother took him to live with her family in Kiev for a few years.</TE>
<TE>   They returned to New York when he was 4 and reunited with his
father, Edward, who had traded his family name of Litvinsky for
Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the name switch, neither of his parents fit well into the
American mainstream. Edward Phillips was, in his son's words, "a
totally unsuccessful lawyer" who spent most of his time reading
philosophy and drifting from one obsession to another, including yoga
and Christian Science. His mother, Marie, was a hypochondriac
constantly in pursuit of a cure.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips went to City College of New York, where he was exposed to
the works of T.S. Eliot and became interested in literary criticism.
He went to graduate school at New York University and steeped himself
in modernist writers and artists such as Ezra Pound and Piet
Mondrian. He wrote his first published piece of criticism while he
was a graduate student in the late 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   At NYU, he met Edna Greenblatt, an English and philosophy major
who would become his first wife. She died in 1985. He also joined
intellectual circles in Greenwich Village, associating with
"high-minded, idealistic, educated aesthetes," most of whom became
Communists.</TE>
<TE>   In 1934 he joined the John Reed Club, a left-wing group of writers
and painters associated with the Communist Party, and soon assumed
its top post of secretary.</TE>
<TE>   He quickly became disillusioned with the group's literary crudity
and political rigidity, however, and began to dream of starting a
magazine that would reflect his views.</TE>
<TE>   He met Rahv, who shared his vision. They launched Partisan Review
with $800, enough to run the magazine for a year in the Depression
economy.</TE>
<TE>   "We were outsiders beginning something new and had no idea how
long it would last or how important it would be," Phillips said in a
New York Times interview in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   To keep it going, he and Rahv gave dance parties, charging for
admission and drinks. They earned a few nights in jail for selling
liquor without a license but were acquitted at trial.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine lasted as an organ of the John Reed Club for about
two years, during which Phillips and Rahv grew increasingly disgusted
with Communist pressure to promote its favorite writers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1937 the editors severed its ties with the party and
reorganized with a staff that included Macdonald and Mary McCarthy.</TE>
<TE>   "As Communists, they discovered, they were expected to subordinate
their literary and intellectual values to the party line....
Confronted with a choice between loyalty to the party and loyalty to
literature, they chose literature," Norman Podhoretz, who wrote for
Partisan Review before his neoconservative conversion, said in his
1979 memoir, "Breaking Ranks."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Distinguished Writers</TE>
<TE>   The first issue of the revamped Partisan Review contained Delmore
Schwartz's famous story "In Dreams Begin Responsibilities," poems by
Wallace Stevens and Agee, essays by Edmund Wilson and Lionel Abel,
and reviews by Hook and Trilling.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years Partisan Review attracted an amazing galaxy of
voices and was notable for reaching out to disaffected Europeans such
as Kafka, Camus and Orwell.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't start out to print great fiction," Phillips said
several years ago. "We started out as opponents of the left-wing
socialist realism of the day, in its extreme called proletarian
literature. We wanted to print the good modernist writers, and it
turns out the good modernist writers were the great modernist
writers."</TE>
<TE>   Phillips wrote some literary criticism but was far from prolific.
He wrote one book, a 1983 memoir titled "A Partisan View: Five
Decades of the Literary Life."</TE>
<TE>   Partisan Review writer William Barrett, in his 1982 memoir called
"The Truants," wrote that although Phillips' conversation "flowed
like a radiant and sparkling stream," he suffered from chronic
writer's block. "Many nights, when we were walking away from his
house," Barrett wrote, "Delmore [Schwartz] would observe with
affectionate sadness, 'If only William could get all that into
writing.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Critical Portraits</TE>
<TE>   Phillips' book drew mixed reviews, criticized by some for
mean-spirited portraits of his colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   He painted Trilling, for instance, as an orderly, graceful,
flexible and modulated person who nonetheless once almost hit Alfred
Kazin during an argument over politics. Schwartz, whose "In Dreams
Begin Responsibilities" became an underground classic, was, in
Phillips' view, "probably psychotic."</TE>
<TE>   Other writers remember his kindness.</TE>
<TE>   Sontag was a teenager growing up in Southern California in the
1940s when she stumbled upon a copy of Partisan Review at a Hollywood
newsstand. "It was magic for me," she recalled Friday. "I said, 'One
day I'll grow up and move to New York and write for Partisan Review.'
"</TE>
<TE>   That day came in the 1960s, when she met Phillips at a party and
boldly suggested that she write for him.</TE>
<TE>   He invited her to write a book review and promised to publish it
if it was any good.</TE>
<TE>   When she arrived at his office, he pointed to a closet full of
books that obviously would never be reviewed. "They were all terrible
books," Sontag said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless she chose one titled "something like 'The Failure of
the Intellectuals.' It looked like garbage. I turned to him and said,
'This doesn't look any good but I could review the title.' Then he
looked at me and said, 'Oh, you're smart.' He took a book from his
desk by Isaac Bashevis Singer. I worked like a dog for two months on
the review, and they printed it. That was the beginning. His casual
kindness was my first baby step in the literary world."</TE>
<TE>   "He is the last of a breed," said Edith Kurzweil, current Partisan
Review editor and Phillips' wife of 12 years. "He helped a lot of
writers find the guts to go against the grain."</TE>

<LD>The Catholic Diocese of Peoria, Ill., has formally begun seeking
sainthood for the late Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, who was a popular
television personality in the 1950s.</LD>
<LD>   Bishop Daniel Jenky said that the diocese's judicial vicar, Msgr.
Richard Soseman, has delivered papers to the Cause for the
Congregation of Saints at the Vatican to begin the campaign for
Sheen's potential sainthood, the Associated Press reported.</LD>
<LD>   Sheen, who died in 1979 at the age of 84, would be the first
American-born male saint.</LD>
<TE>   He hosted the "Life Is Worth Living" show from 1952 to 1957, had a
popular radio show, wrote a newspaper column and became the bishop of
Rochester, N.Y., in the 1960s. He was elevated to archbishop before

<LD>The Russian government expelled another two Roman Catholic priests
this week, bringing to five the number of foreign Catholic clergy
stripped of their visas this year in what Catholic leaders say is a
campaign to curb the church's work in the predominantly Orthodox
Christian country.</LD>
<LD>   The priests, both Polish citizens, each had been working in
Russian parishes for a decade: the Revs. Edward Mackiewicz in the
southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don and Jaroslaw Wisniewski on
Russia's Pacific coast.</LD>
<LD>   The Vatican's representative to Russia quickly protested the
expulsions to the Russian foreign ministry but has yet to receive an
explanation, a Vatican diplomat said earlier this week from Moscow.</LD>

<HD>Johns Hopkins to Create Jewish Studies Program</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After long resisting religion-based academic majors, Johns Hopkins
University announced this week that it is establishing a Jewish
studies program with the help of a $5-million gift from a Baltimore
foundation.</LD>
<LD>   The $5-million gift from the Leonard and Helen R. Stulman
Charitable Foundation will support new course offerings, additional
faculty and public lectures, said foundation president Shale D.
Stiller .</LD>
<LD>   "Baltimore is one of the four or five centers for Jewish thought
and experience in the entire U.S., and therefore, it's really
appropriate that the premier educational institution in the city has
this type of program," Stiller said.</LD>
<TE>   The creation of a Jewish studies division represents a departure
for the university, said David Nirenberg, the Hopkins historian who
will direct the new program.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with its secular tradition, Hopkins had declined to
follow the lead of most other leading universities in establishing
religious-based majors such as Jewish studies, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The university lacks even a general religious studies department.</TE>
<TE>   About 10% of Hopkins undergraduates are Jewish, a lower ratio than
at many other leading East Coast colleges.</TE>

<HD>Ousting of Priest Sparks Rift in Episcopal Church</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A rift in the U.S. Episcopal church is widening over a bishop's
decision to defrock a priest who says the church has become too
liberal on issues such as ordaining women and recognizing same-sex
unions.</LD>
<LD>   The day after the Rev. David Moyer was deposed, he celebrated
Communion at the cathedral as a priest of the Pittsburgh Diocese. The
Anglican province of Central Africa had granted Moyer temporary
clergy status.</LD>
<LD>   Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, the leader of the world's
Anglicans, also said he will receive Moyer if he wants to be a priest
in England, Carey's spokesman said.</LD>
<TE>   Bishop Charles E. Bennison Jr., leader of the four-county Diocese
of Pennsylvania, made the decision to oust Moyer, who is the North
American president of Forward in Faith, a movement that has proposed
him as a special bishop for conservative congregations within the
church.</TE>
<TE>   Moyer has said Bennison's teachings are "heretical," and the
priest doesn't recognize the bishop's order removing him from the
clergy.</TE>
<TE>   The bishop has said that what prompted Moyer's dismissal was his
rejection of the bishop's authority.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh Bishop Robert Duncan and 22 other bishops protested
Bennison's decision, saying he acted against church law and
tradition.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of prominent Christian scholars has issued a 10-point
statement that says teaching contempt for Judaism "dishonors God."</LD>
<LD>   The document is a response to a declaration issued by Jewish
leaders in 2000 urging Jews to reexamine their understanding of
Christianity.</LD>
<LD>   The new statement, released at Boston College by 21 Roman Catholic
and Protestant scholars, said that "if Jews, who do not share our
faith in Christ, are in a saving covenant with God, then Christians
need new ways of understanding the universal significance of Christ."</LD>
<TE>   Jesus lived and died as a faithful Jew, and Christians should not
target Jews for conversion, the scholars said.</TE>
<TE>   After a panel of Roman Catholic bishops made that point last
month, Southern Baptist leaders objected. One author of the new
statement, Walter Harrelson of Vanderbilt University, was criticized
by fellow Southern Baptists for endorsing it.</TE>

<HD>City to Appeal Ruling on Housing Project</HD>
<DH>Development: Judge in May had sided with Chatsworth
residents, who feared 21-home plan would ruin their equestrian
lifestyle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council voted Friday to appeal a court ruling
that handed Chatsworth residents a victory in their battle to block a
housing project by Airport Commission President Ted Stein.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a bad court decision," said Councilman Hal Bernson, who
was been criticized by some residents for pushing the 21-home
development for Stein, a close friend.</LD>
<LD>   After a half-hour closed session, the council voted unanimously to
appeal the May decision.</LD>
<TE>   It also directed the city to begin addressing problems cited in
the ruling by Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs, who found flaws in
the environmental review of the project.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors say the development would ruin the equestrian lifestyle
of the area by placing mansions on smaller lots next to horse stable
properties.</TE>
<TE>   In their lawsuit, the neighbors contend the city erred when it
changed zoning to allow Stein's project. They also challenged the
environmental review.</TE>
<TE>   Janavs issued a writ invalidating a General Plan amendment that
allowed the 6.7-acre development.</TE>
<TE>   Anger over the project has helped fuel secession sentiments in the
Chatsworth area.</TE>
<TE>   One of the key project opponents, Jerry England, is running for a
City Council seat in the proposed San Fernando Valley municipality.
He is a founder of Chatsworth Land Preservation, formed to fight the
development.</TE>
<TE>   "It stinks," England said of Friday's council action.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all about politically powerful people getting their way.
That's what secession is a reaction to," England said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week Stein held a fund-raiser at his Encino home that
collected nearly $500,000 for Mayor James K. Hahn's anti-secession
campaign. Hahn appointed Stein's wife to the city Public Works Board,
and Stein's daughter is the mayor's field representative for the
south Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Stein, who has also appealed the ruling, said there was no
connection between the council's vote and his ties to Hahn and the
anti-secession effort. "We disagreed with the court's decision," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Before Friday's vote, Ann Marie Wise of the Chatsworth
preservation group urged the council to "follow the wishes of your
constituents in the San Fernando Valley" and not file the appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Bernson said the project will protect horse-keeping by preventing
commercial development on the acreage, at Chatsworth Street and
Topanga Canyon Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "This at least involves quarter-acre lots," Bernson said after the
vote.</TE>
<TE>   Stein bought the land from the Catholic Archdiocese of Los
Angeles. Since then, other properties in the area have been
subdivided into lots smaller than a half acre.</TE>
<TE>   Horse owners say they fear people moving into the homes on the
smaller lots will complain about the smell of the nearby stables, and
eventually drive the horses out.</TE>

<HD>Virk Is Sent to State Mental Hospital</HD>
<DH>Courts: The Port Hueneme mother who tried to drown her two
children could be held in the locked facility for the rest of her
life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge committed a Port Hueneme mother to a state mental hospital
Friday, two months after a jury concluded she was insane when she
tried to drown her children in Channel Islands Harbor.</LD>
<LD>   Narinder Virk, 42, bowed her head during a brief court appearance
before deputies led her away to await transportation to Patton State
Hospital in San Bernardino County.</LD>
<LD>   Virk must spend at least six months at the locked facility and
could be held there for the rest of her life or until her sanity is
deemed restored.</LD>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Simon
said the case is far from over.</TE>
<TE>   "It hasn't really ended," said Simon, who had urged jurors to
reject the insanity defense and send Virk to state prison. "My
feeling is there is that gray area. I believe she was mentally ill,
but not insane."</TE>
<TE>   Virk's supporters believe she was a battered wife who suffered a
breakdown before she tried to drown her son and daughter. They hope
that with proper treatment, she can be released from Patton in less
than a year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very positive," said supporter Nina Sloan of La Puente, who
helped secure Virk's release on bail two years ago and attended
nearly every day of her trial. "We've told her that she will be out
very soon because there is nothing wrong with her."</TE>
<TE>   Virk was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after an Oxnard
resident pulled the fully clothed woman, along with her 6-year-old
daughter and 9-year-old son, out of Channel Islands Harbor the night
of Jan. 12, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The children, who did not know how to swim, told police officers
that their mother woke them in the middle of the night, led them to
the harbor and pushed them off a boat dock before jumping in herself.</TE>
<TE>   Virk was charged with two counts of attempted murder and an
allegation that she caused serious injury to her daughter. She
pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, prosecutors argued that Virk's actions were deliberate
and premeditated. But the defense maintained that Virk was suffering
from severe depression after enduring years of spousal abuse and
could not tell right from wrong.</TE>
<TE>   After a three-week trial in early July, jurors decided Virk was
guilty on both counts and the trial advanced to a second phase, in
which mental health experts testified that she was delusional,
psychotic and legally insane at the time of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors found Virk insane after two days of deliberation.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Ventura County's mental health department has
concluded that Virk is mentally ill and, based on her court
convictions, must be confined to a state mental institution.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley formally
sentenced Virk to life in prison for the attempted murders but noted
that she could be released sooner if doctors at Patton decide her
sanity is restored.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors could then oppose her release, and a separate trial on
the sanity issue would be held in Ventura County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   While she was free on bail, Virk spent 20 months caring for an
elderly woman with Parkinson's disease in Northridge and still hopes
to soon return to the job, Sloan said.</TE>
<TE>   Virk also wants to be reunified with her children, Sloan said,
although a court order now prohibits her from contacting them.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Cynthia Ellington said she is also hopeful
that Virk will someday be released from the state hospital. But she
said it is too soon to tell whether her client's mental condition has
improved.</TE>
<TE>   "She had a psychotic breakdown," Ellington said. "Has she
recovered from that? I don't know."</TE>

<HD>It Seems Good Taste Has Gone Down the Toilet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA BELL PALMER</AU>
<BD>Patricia Bell Palmer lives in the Carthay Circle
section of Los Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With school in session again, I'm back to driving my daughters, ages
5 and 3, past the corner of San Vicente and Wilshire boulevards five
mornings a week, past a billboard put up several months ago to
advertise a recent release by Tha Row Records.</LD>
<LD>   My girls remember the billboard, which isn't surprising. Summer
wasn't long enough to obliterate the image from my memory either. Too
bad. I grip the wheel tighter as they call from the back seat,
"Mommy, look! There's the man making poo-poo!" Neither can read yet,
but if they could, they'd know Tha Row's marketing geniuses weren't
as cute or subtle in their wording.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm the ... ," the sign reads, beneath a cartoon image of a
scowling man on a toilet, his pants around his ankles. I'm curious
whether The Times will even print the expletive in its raw form, as
the billboard does, or whether it opts for a tamer omission of
letters. The decision in and of itself makes a statement about the
newspaper's belief that some words are or are not meant for
mainstream consumption.</LD>
<TE>   Scattered at his feet are a wad of cash, a cell phone and a roll
of toilet tissue that appears to be out of arm's reach. Is that why
he's scowling? Or could it be that, like me, he believes the ad
plunges to a new depth in public displays of tastelessness that we
and our kids must endure as American city dwellers?</TE>
<TE>   I don't blame my daughters for finding the billboard funny. Like
lots of kids their age, they delight in toilet humor. I must admit,
I've also been known to laugh aloud over material others might find
offensive. I advocate noncensorship of the arts, but I also believe I
should get to choose what my children and I see and hear as we make
our way to school, the market or the playground.</TE>
<TE>   Does anyone police the buyers of billboard space for content?
Should they? Am I correct in fearing that Tha Row's campaign is
another inching toward the destruction of the moral code in the
United States? Or am I a relic, no different from my grandparents,
who feared for the purity of our country's youth upon first glimpsing
Elvis Presley's swiveling hips?</TE>
<TE>   The man on the toilet raises these questions, but he's not the
only one. Is the work of an artist like Britney Spears harmless or
not in the sex-soaked messages it sends to girls and boys as young as
4 and 5? Do Eminem's lyrics promote misogyny? Anarchy? Is it time for
me to lighten up?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe. But at least I can, for the time being, control what my
kids see and hear on the radio, television and computer. With Tha
Row's billboard, I don't have that option unless I want to detour
around the most direct route to my kids' school. I won't do that
because I refuse to treat my own neighborhood as a cultural
minefield. Like it or not, I must let my children experience the
deluge of images, tasteless and otherwise, this great city shows to
them. And, like all responsible parents, I must find ways to help
them understand and interpret what they see and hear.</TE>

<AU>ROSANNE WELCH</AU>
<BD>Rosanne Welch is a writer-producer whose credits
include "ABC News Nightline," "Picket Fences" and "Touched by an
Angel."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When my husband and I first moved to California 17 years ago, we
parked our rented moving truck in front of an affordable apartment in
Van Nuys, and we've never left. Yes, there was that four-year stint
in an apartment in North Hollywood--another underappreciated area now
trying to renew its dignity--but when we bought a house six years
ago, it was just a few blocks from our first apartment.</LD>
<LD>   Most of my neighbors have been here for more than 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   Most of them work hard, and most of their children or
grandchildren are working their way through college. We ride our
bikes nightly and walk to the library, which has a great reference
section in town because it services the local courthouse.</LD>
<TE>   As much as I love many of my friends who have vacated this Valley,
I can't help teasing them about living in places where the houses
"are all made out of ticky-tacky and they all look just the same."
Most of the folks I know who live in Valencia have spent their early
home-owning years embroiled in lawsuits with developers who used
cheap steel pipes in their plumbing or warehouse-reject wood laminate
on their floors.</TE>
<TE>   Most of them lock their doors even in the daytime. None of them
feel safe enough to let their kids play in those postage-stamp front
yards or to sit on those "old-fashioned" front porches and visit with
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   But my 4-year-old is constantly running over to watch one neighbor
work on cars or help the other water her roses in exchange for a
handful of candy. He races his remote-control truck with three other
boys on the block and skateboards in the neighbor's driveway.</TE>
<TE>   My friends in that other Valley sit in traffic for an extra hour
these days; all those great mountain views advertised when they first
bought their houses have been cobbled into other subdivisions. Some
of them have just learned that there will be no room for their
children in the local public schools, so they'd better start signing
up at a few private ones.</TE>
<TE>   I don't live in Van Nuys because I can't afford to live anywhere
else. We bought this house when my husband was a cog in the corporate
wheel and I was a secretary on a string of cop shows. Now he works
for himself and I have my own secretary, but we haven't hopped over
the hill into some other location. Why, you may ask. Because I know
this neighborhood is a reflection of the real world, and I want my
son to know how to live in 2050, not 1950.</TE>
<TE>   I proudly call my neighborhood the United Nations because the
folks next door are from Armenia, across the street they're from
Japan and kitty-corner they're from Belgium. Every one of them has
been available in a pinch to watch my son or help jump-start a dead
battery or loan me a ridiculously cliche cup of sugar when I was
making a cake. They've helped us search for a lost cat and brought my
Mom pastry when she was baby-sitting for my son one night. Every one
of us watches out for each other and would call the cops in a
heartbeat if someone was messing with the cars in our driveways or
the roses in our yards. If that's not a reason to stay, I don't know
what is.</TE>

<HD>Italy's Aging Bambini</HD>
<DH>From Milan to Sicily, more young adults are continuing to
live with their parents. Mom and Dad get companionship, while the
kids get a new-style dolce vita.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Mauro Toro wanted the freedom to follow his dreams. So he moved in
with his mother.</LD>
<LD>   That meant he could sell his home and use the money to buy a
46-foot yacht. Now Toro, 35, spends much of his time sailing the
Mediterranean, taking paying passengers on his own boat or working as
a skipper on other vessels.</LD>
<LD>   And aside from a few inconveniences, he really enjoys living with
Mom.</LD>
<TE>   "I like it that I don't wash my clothes," he explained. "I like it
that if I don't have dinner out, I can have dinner when I come home,
without cooking. I like it that my bed is always made."</TE>
<TE>   Toro is a mammone, or "mama's boy," and more or less proud of it.
He is part of a huge number of Italian singles in their 20s and 30s
who live with their parents and see advantages in the setup for both
generations, while finding nothing at all embarrassing about it.</TE>
<TE>   Many Italians of all ages look favorably on such arrangements.
Young men and women often find it difficult to earn enough to run
their own household, while parents like to have their children at
home even after they are grown.</TE>
<TE>   Italy's highest appeals court created an uproar this year,
however, by taking things one step further. Ruling in favor of an
adult son who sued his estranged father for support, the court
declared that the parent had not just a social but also a legal duty.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it isn't the law that nurtures this form of family
togetherness.</TE>
<TE>   Challenged by the youth revolt of the 1960s and '70s, the Italian
family adapted rather than stand rigidly by its traditions. The
under-30s of 1968, the watershed year of rebellion, and their
children have together constructed a new pattern that preserves the
family's central role in Italian life by offering stay-at-homes
unprecedented freedom, plus enormous economic and personal benefits.</TE>
<TE>   In other Western European countries such as Germany, France and
Britain, it is far more common for young adults to move out and live
on their own. The new Italian pattern became standard over the last
decade or so partly because it helps ease other problems: Rents are
up, university graduates have greater difficulty finding good jobs,
and young adults spend more years in school.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, 59% of Italians ages 20 to 35 live with their
parents, according to government statistics, up from 46% a decade
ago. The trend coincides with a plummeting Italian birthrate, now
less than 1.2 children per woman, which itself is partly a result of
later marriages.</TE>
<TE>   This all forms an interlocking pattern--what some might call a
vicious circle. It's hard to get a good job and strike out on your
own. Life with your parents can be very pleasant, with no
restrictions, so there's less incentive to leave. And if you're not
married, the thinking goes, you might as well stay in the nest.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very comfortable to continue to live with Mom and Dad,
because they are taking care of everything and you ... are free,"
said Rossella Palomba, a demographer with the Institute for
Population Research and Social Policies in Rome.</TE>
<TE>   "You can go out in the evening whenever you want," she said. "You
can meet your girlfriend or boyfriend at home. Of course the parents
know of this moment of intimacy, and they are not against it. So you
are completely free.... You are really a kind of king in the house."</TE>
<TE>   In the old days, young Italian women often lived at home until
they were married, generally needing permission to go out at night.
Many saw marriage as their only way to escape parental control. A man
living at home often had to accept his father's advice--or orders--at
a family business or farm. Although families were close, there was
rarely any doubt that the older generation was firmly in charge.</TE>
<TE>   So one might wonder what, exactly, the parents get out of the new
arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   Domenico De Masi, a sociologist at the University of Rome, said he
sees the relationship between generations as a fairly straightforward
trade. Using the amount a child would otherwise typically pay monthly
for rent and food, he said: "The parents 'give' $1,200 to their
children, and the children give company to their parents. It's an
exchange of sentiment for money. It's prostitution."</TE>
<TE>   Avoidance of solitude is the key issue, he said. And given the
lingering influence of old attitudes, for many middle-aged Italians
that means not simply having a spouse around but ensuring that the
younger generation stays in the picture.</TE>
<TE>   "The fear of being alone arises for an Italian couple while
they're still young, while for an American couple the fear of
solitude comes when they're old," he said. "A young American couple
doesn't make an investment in sentiment. They make their investment
in the Dow Jones and Nasdaq."</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, many people expect that they might spend
their final years in a senior citizens home, and they need to save up
the money to do this. But in Italy, that is seen as shameful.</TE>
<TE>   "Even today, to send your own parents to an old people's home is
considered despicable, deplorable, something that should not be done,
because the old folks should stay with you as long as they live,"
said sociologist Franco Ferrarotti.</TE>
<TE>   Palomba added, however, that for the stay-at-homes, she sees "some
side effects, because of course you are still a child."</TE>
<TE>   "Your level of psychological independence, autonomy, is not so
high," she said. "So for everything, you still ask your parents for
suggestions and support."</TE>
<TE>   Tommaso Genovese, 33, a businessman who has always lived with his
mother except when residing or traveling abroad, said he thinks that
all mothers love their children but that Italian mothers are more
possessive--and they never stop seeing their sons as "my baby, my
bambino."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a nickname for a son," he said. "Let's say if she's talking
to you about me: I'm her bambino. 'Mio bambino.'</TE>
<TE>   "They would like to run your life forever," he added. "She wants
to know what I do, who I see. If I'm late, she's going to call me:
'Where are you? Why are you so late?' "</TE>
<TE>   His mother's place is in the coastal town of Anzio, a two-hour
commute from Rome, where Genovese works, so he doesn't go home every
night, staying instead with his girlfriend in the capital. He and his
mother use the phone to keep in touch.</TE>
<TE>   "If she calls me too much, it annoys me," he said. "If she doesn't
call me, I'm upset. Sometimes she lets two or three days pass without
calling me, and when she does, I scream at her, 'Why you don't call
me?' Well, she's getting old, so sometimes I get worried."</TE>
<TE>   Luigina Giacomo is a farmer's daughter who went off to university,
returned home for several years and now lives independently in Rome.
She thinks that ultimately, the social rebellion of the '60s not only
failed to bring the unlimited personal liberty many had sought but in
some ways also backfired by making it more comfortable for young
adults to stay at home.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it's true that the children, after 1968, wanted to
break the walls down, do what they want, not be obligated to do what
their parents wanted them to do," said Giacomo, 36. "But the parents
take in their children whatever happens. If you're a woman and you
have a child and you're not married, it's not a problem, because in
the end the parents are always ready to take their children back
home."</TE>
<TE>   The children "don't need to think about growing up or taking
responsibility," she said. "In a way, it became a backward
revolution."</TE>
<TE>   Other features of Italian society reinforce the trend.</TE>
<TE>   As more young people attend university, the years it typically
takes to graduate have stretched out, with schools often considered
"parking lots" for people who can't find proper jobs. Employers
prefer to hire graduates in their late 20s, when they are more
mature, rather than offering the good jobs to people who zip through
their schooling.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the unemployed students mostly live at home.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are not really changing, because the umbilical cord with
the original family has not been cut," Ferrarotti said. "The mama,
the mother, is still there. Actually, she's a terrible meddler. It's
a subterraneous but powerful influence."</TE>
<TE>   Many Italians feel that parents have a duty to support their
children throughout the long growing-up and job-hunting process.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, many felt that the top appeals court was out of line in
its April ruling requiring a prosperous father to support his son.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot blame a young person, particularly from a well-off
family, who refuses a job that does not fit his aspirations," the
court said in its verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Most comment on the case was critical of the court for seeing
support as a legal duty and of the son for suing. At the same time,
many Italians say the father should have simply supported the son
while he pursued further studies and hunted for a truly attractive
job.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that if someone wants to keep on studying and doesn't
have work, it's right for the parents to support him," said Maria
Cristina Del Vecchio, 61, who has two adult daughters living at home.</TE>
<TE>   One of those daughters, Paola Onorati, 37, said that after
attending university, she returned to her family's spacious home in
the small town of Montelanico because to her it was "a sort of
paradise."</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, we like to stay with our parents," she explained.
"For us, the family represents everything."</TE>
<TE>   She also doesn't earn enough money at her office job to live
alone.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if I had a good salary, I probably would not have a chance
to live in a house like this one," she said. "Most young people in
Italy don't have a good job, so they can't afford to live alone [or]
to start a new family."</TE>
<TE>   Being at home is also "a way to make our traditions live as long
as possible," Onorati added. "For example, my mother can cook
traditional dishes from our small village, or prepare some special
wine or special liqueur that they usually made probably 200 years
ago. It's not because she wants me to become a very good housewife
but just because it's a way to say, 'These are your origins, these
are your traditions, so you have to keep them.' "</TE>
<TE>   Del Vecchio said it is "mostly the emotions" that she likes about
having her daughters living at home. Onorati "fills the house," she
said. "When she's not here, you notice right away. Waking up, you can
tell if she's here or not."</TE>
<TE>   Mauro Toro, the son who sold his house and bought a yacht, said
even though he chooses to live with his mother, she likes to give him
a hard time. In a conversation one day, she showed what he meant.</TE>
<TE>   "When he comes home [from a sailing trip], he brings a huge bag of
dirty clothes," complained Maria Toro, 58.</TE>
<TE>   "In the winter, the bad thing is he wakes up at noon," she added.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not true," Mauro Toro interjected.</TE>
<TE>   "I call him and I say, 'Are you coming home for lunch?' and he
says: 'Leave it alone. When I come, I'll eat,' " she continued.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Italian mothers "are tied to their children," she said.
"The ways of an Italian mom and an American mom aren't the same. I
know about American women from reading the newspaper. An Italian mom
worries, and helps her children, including unmarried children. She
follows them closely even if they're older, because they also remain
more tied to us."</TE>
<TE>   Maria Toro said she herself thinks that what she's doing "is
wrong, because a child remains used to having things this way."</TE>
<TE>   "They don't grow," she said. "They don't become mature.... It's
not because I want to be a good mother. It's simply we're together,
and you just do it. But the children don't appreciate it."</TE>
<TE>   That forced Mauro Toro to protest again: "Yes, I do!"</TE>

<HD>Team Needs Time, U.N. Inspector Says</HD>
<DH>Iraq: Any new searches would focus on weapons caches, Hans
Blix says, but preparations could take up to five months.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>The chief weapons inspector for the United Nations said Friday that
he would focus first on finding suspected stocks of anthrax and
ballistic missiles in Iraq if his teams are allowed to return.
However, he warned that it would take four or five months of
preparations before inspections could begin.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview a day after President Bush urged world leaders
here to immediately confront Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime
over its suspected weapons of mass destruction, Hans Blix also said
he hopes to avoid the armed standoffs and bitter disputes that marked
the last round of U.N. inspections in Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   "It's in their interest and in our interest not to have clashes,"
said Blix, executive chairman of the U.N. Monitoring, Verification
and Inspection Commission, in an office decorated with a satellite
photograph of downtown Baghdad.</LD>
<TE>   Blix, a Swedish disarmament expert who was the director of the
International Atomic Energy Agency from 1981 to 1997 and oversaw
inspections of Iraq's weapons programs, warned that it's unrealistic
to expect a new weapons inspection regime to provide a quick
resolution to the Iraqi weapons dispute. He said it may take a year
to conclude whether Iraq is adequately disarmed.</TE>
<TE>   "If they want thorough and complete inspections, it's not
compatible with something hasty," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Security Council members said Friday that they were
unanimous in backing a speedy return of weapons inspectors to Iraq as
the first step, they have not yet set a time frame for their own
actions or Iraq's response.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told reporters here that any
new U.N. resolution on Iraq must include a deadline, but he did not
elaborate. He said U.S. diplomats would begin drafting language for a
new resolution on Iraq next week.</TE>
<TE>   "It has to be different this time," said a senior State Department
official, referring to the aborted inspections of the 1990s. "That's
the million-dollar question. How different can it be?"</TE>
<TE>   A senior European diplomat who supports sending inspectors back to
Iraq said Hussein may "surprise everyone" by allowing inspectors to
return.</TE>
<TE>   "What he really wants is to stay in power," he said. "He beat them
all once. Maybe he thinks he can do it again."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has resisted U.N. pressure since 1991 to stop work aimed at
building nuclear weapons and to destroy all chemical and biological
weapons, including stockpiles of anthrax.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq admitted producing more than 2,200 gallons of liquid anthrax
in the 1990s, but U.N. inspectors at the time estimated that the
regime may have produced three times as much. U.N. teams also were
unable to account for all the equipment used in anthrax production
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence believes that Iraq has resumed production of
chemical and biological weapons, possibly including anthrax, since
the last inspectors were withdrawn from Iraq in 1998. Baghdad later
barred their return.</TE>
<TE>   The previous U.N. inspection teams also concluded that Iraq may
have hidden a small force of Al-Hussein missiles after the 1991
Persian Gulf War, in violation of its cease-fire commitments. The
missiles have a 400-mile range and thus could threaten Israel as well
as Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   Blix said he would initially seek to resolve between five and 25
of the nearly 100 "disarmament disputes" left from 1998 if Iraq
accepts the U.N. teams.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. inspections would succeed, and thus possibly prevent a
American-led invasion of Iraq, only if Hussein's regime provides full
cooperation, Blix said, adding that the renewed U.N. pressure and
U.S. military threat might make that happen.</TE>
<TE>   "They fear that the slightest little hitch in our relations will
trigger military action," he said. "My guess is the Security Council
will not tolerate any continued cat-and-mouse games."</TE>
<TE>   But Blix warned that the search of about 700 factories,
laboratories, military facilities and other sites for evidence of
illegal weapons development or production might never resolve every
question and doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "Our experience in the past is that yes, they have been hiding
things," he said. "There will always be a residue of uncertainty."</TE>
<TE>   Then, pointing out that a year later authorities have not yet
found the source of anthrax-bearing letters mailed through the U.S.
Postal Service, Blix added: "You can't find every small piece in such
a large country."</TE>
<TE>   He expressed skepticism when asked about unofficial proposals to
deploy thousands of troops from the United States or other nations
alongside U.N. inspectors to ensure Iraqi cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see that inspectors are any more secure if they carry
arms and are surrounded by an army," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Blix said he was prepared to send an advance team to Iraq within
days if Baghdad agrees. But he would need to negotiate logistical
issues--from housing and security for inspectors to helicopter
landing pads and local offices--before the first full teams could go
in.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not deploy any inspectors until we provide these
practical arrangements," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, he added, the U.N. must hire or reassign dozens of
scientists, technicians, pilots and others for a new inspection
effort. Then come their visas, inoculations, travel arrangements and
other details.</TE>
<TE>   Blix also ticked off a checklist of items U.N. teams would need
and the time needed to lease or purchase them: 60 days for
helicopters and aircraft, 14 days for walkie-talkies, 60 days for
satellite phones.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a matter of weeks," he said. "It's two months, three
months perhaps."</TE>
<TE>   At that point, under current U.N. resolutions, inspectors will
have 60 days to determine the issues of greatest concern.</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council must then approve the list before the first
inspections can begin. The inspectors will make their first report to
the council 120 days later.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a gradual buildup," he said, with an ultimate goal
of deploying about 80 inspectors and about 40 backup people in Iraq
at any given time.</TE>
<TE>   He said he thinks that he could conclude within a year whether
Iraq's level of disarmament would allow for at least a suspension of
U.N. sanctions--or other consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Blix insisted that he is comfortable with his role--and with the
prospect that his assessment of whether Hussein's regime has
sufficiently disarmed could well determine whether the United States
and possibly other nations go to war against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a duty laid upon you," he said calmly. "You exercise your
judgment. You use your common sense. There are many difficult tasks
in the world."</TE>

<LD>A ferry full of South Koreans arrived in North Korea for tearful
reunions with relatives they last saw half a century ago, kicking off
a weekend that will also include rare North-South military talks.</LD>
<LD>   One hundred people from each of the two states met long-lost kin
at the Mt. Kumgang resort.</LD>
<LD>   South Korean television showed people--many in their
60s--prostrating themselves before their octogenarian parents. The
reunions of southerners chosen by lottery and northerners screened by
their government are the second such meetings this year and the fifth
since South Korean President Kim Dae Jung met the North's leader, Kim
Jong Il, two years ago.</LD>

<LD>Police in Zimbabwe rounded up 12 white farmers for defying an
eviction order and arrested a retired white judge who had previously
clashed with President Robert Mugabe's government.</LD>
<LD>   The farmers were the first to be arrested since Mugabe warned
Sept. 4 that white opponents of his controversial land reforms faced
jail if they did not cooperate.</LD>
<LD>   Recently retired High Court Judge Fergus Blackie was also
detained. He had tried to sentence the justice minister to prison.
Officials accused him of irregularities in office and bias against
the government.</LD>

<LD>   The Peace and Justice group has been blamed for the deaths of
hundreds of people in clashes with supporters of the Zapatista

was selling them. I made more than $10,000 just buying bogus phones
and fax machines. If I had more money, I would have emptied out every
store in the city."</LD>
<TE>   Two decades of economic reforms have transformed China into a
dream market with 1.3 billion potential customers, but thanks to
widespread piracy, the country is also fast becoming the counterfeit
capital of the world.</TE>
<TE>   A new breed of consumer warriors, however, has been winning small
but significant battles in the war against fakes.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with a little-known law that allows them to demand a double
refund for fake merchandise, bootleg "vigilantes" attack
counterfeiters by buying knockoffs in bulk and forcing the stores to
pay for violating the law.</TE>
<TE>   They call it the Wang Hai phenomenon. Named after a Beijing
resident who was the first in the country to test out the consumer
protection law in the mid-1990s, the scheme caught on like wildfire.
Now practically every city has its own "Wang Hai."</TE>
<TE>   "There was a 'Sichuan-Wang Hai,' a 'Zhejiang-Wang Hai,' a
'Wuhan-Wang Hai' and a 'Shanghai-Wang Hai,' " said Yang Hong, a "Wang
Hai" from Nanjing. "Some people were motivated by money. But most of
us saw it as a great way to protect our rights."</TE>
<TE>   No matter what their initial motive, the Wang Hais have sparked a
sea change in how the Chinese see themselves in a new market-driven
economy. Until the Wang Hais came along, very few people knew
anything about consumer rights, much less about how to fight back.</TE>
<TE>   Yang Hong is a former movie stuntman turned security guard and
amateur film buff. He bought a Japanese-made camcorder for a wedding.
He wanted to shoot the newlyweds in slow motion and show the video at
the banquet. But he couldn't get the camera to work. He found out
later that the camcorder never had the feature. It was a clear case
of false advertising. He complained and got a refund.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't get into this on purpose, but because I wanted the slow
motion to work so much, I studied the law and found out how I could
fight for my rights," Yang said.</TE>
<TE>   Since March 2000, he has won more than 130 cases of fraud. But to
distinguish himself from the other Wang Hais, he began to demand
public apologies and a symbolic refund of one yuan, or a little more
than a dime, for each victory.</TE>
<TE>   That has made his fight a lot easier, because most store owners
don't bother to resist the small fine. If they did, he would have to
find the original brand-name manufacturer and get them to verify the
goods.</TE>
<TE>   "Doing this for personal gains grates against a lot of people's
sense of right and wrong," said Yang, explaining that he makes enough
money as a security guard. Others, however, believe that's letting
the bootlegger off too easy. Besides, the burden of proof can get
expensive, especially if it involves hiring a lawyer and going to
court. Buying in bulk and getting a big refund is the only way to
cover costs and have an effect, according to the original Wang Hai
from Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   Shanghai's Wang Haidong, whose name coincidentally means Wanghai
of the east, doesn't mind admitting he's also in it for the money.
Referring to the selfless model soldier from the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution, he said, "They ask me to learn from Lei Feng, and fight
counterfeiters for free. Sure, I can do that a couple of times, but I
need to make a living. They violated the law, and I'm following the
law. There's nothing wrong with how I'm making my money."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, an official from the state-run Shanghai consumer affairs
bureau suggested changing the law so people such as Wang Haidong
would no longer qualify as an ordinary consumer. The argument is that
he's buying things knowing they are fakes and therefore shouldn't be
entitled to any refund. The proposal set off a debate that left many
wondering if this would be the end of the consumer crusade.</TE>
<TE>   "Chinese consumers lack a real representative voice," said Wang
Hai, adding that many local consumer bureaus are staffed with people
who run department stores that sell bogus goods. "We still don't have
a neutral and unbiased body to protect our rights."</TE>
<TE>   Being an activist is tough enough even without a legal about-face.
Some counterfeiters hire thugs, make threatening calls and stop at
nothing to protect their interests. "Someone once threatened to chop
my toes off to make soup," said Liu, who now runs a
private-investigating firm helping multinationals break up
counterfeit rings. "But I feel good when I can stop a certain fake
drug from entering the market. I know I'm performing an important
public service."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the financial investment. Wang Haidong still has a
few thousand dollars' worth of bogus health tonics sitting in a
warehouse. It takes time and patience to prove they're phony.</TE>
<TE>   If the law changes, he would be stuck. But he isn't giving up, not
when there are so many blatant violators running free.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Pilots Charged in Airstrike</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: It is the first time such action has been taken
over a wartime 'friendly fire' incident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Air Force has charged two F-16 pilots with involuntary
manslaughter and aggravated assault for their roles in a bombing that
killed four Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan, the service said
Friday. It is the first time the military has leveled criminal
charges related to a "friendly fire" incident in wartime.</LD>
<LD>   The pilots, both members of an Illinois Air National Guard unit in
Springfield, have been recalled to active duty to face the charges in
military court, the Air Force said.</LD>
<LD>   Majs. Harry Schmidt and William Umbach each were charged Wednesday
with four counts of manslaughter and eight counts of aggravated
assault as well as dereliction of duty. Schmidt dropped the 500-pound
bomb that caused the deaths; Umbach was his flight commander in
charge of their mission.</LD>
<TE>   The dead men were the first Canadian soldiers killed in a combat
zone since the Korean War. The April attack, which also injured eight
Canadians, was one of the worst such incidents in the war in
Afghanistan. No one has been charged in a December incident in which
three Green Berets and about 25 of their Afghan allies were killed in
an accidental bombing near the southern city of Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to file criminal charges follows months of
controversy over the bombing, which was protested vigorously by the
government of Canada, one of the United States' staunchest allies.
The Canadian and U.S. militaries investigated the incident.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on all the charges, Schmidt faces a maximum sentence
of 64 years and six months, and Umbach of 64 years and three months,
said Maj. Ted Wadsworth, a Pentagon spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Only once before has a U.S. service member been charged in
relation to a friendly fire incident. In that case, the peacetime
downing of two Army Black Hawk helicopters over northern Iraq by an
Air Warning and Control System aircraft in April 1994, a radar
officer was acquitted of all charges.</TE>
<TE>   Military legal analysts said the unprecedented nature of the
charges in wartime raised questions about whether they may have
resulted from diplomatic or political pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not trying to exonerate these men, but given all the bombing
that was going on [in Afghanistan] of civilians and of our own
troops, you have to ask yourself, why are these guys being singled
out? What's different about what they did than what the other pilots
have done? And the answer is, they killed foreign troops from an
ally," said Francis A. Boyle, a professor of international law and
expert on the laws of war at University of Illinois College of Law,
in Champaign.</TE>
<TE>   The charges are also unusual because both pilots are National
Guardsmen who had been called up temporarily for duty in Afghanistan.
Critics of the increased demands being placed on members of the
reserves and National Guard in the last decade have speculated that
some reserve pilots may not have the same levels of training or
experience as their active-duty counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   But Schmidt and Umbach were seasoned combat pilots. Schmidt, who
dropped the laser-guided bomb after seeing what looked to him like
flashes of gunfire, is a former Navy F/A-18 Hornet pilot and a former
F-15 instructor pilot at the Navy's elite Top Gun weapons school.
Umbach is a United Airlines pilot who flew F-16 sorties on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Both are members of the 183rd Fighter Wing of the Illinois Air
National Guard and were temporarily assigned to the 332nd Air
Expeditionary Group when the incident occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Charles W. Gittins, a Virginia lawyer representing Schmidt, said
in a statement that although his client "regrets" that Canadian
troops were killed and injured, he "honestly and reasonably believed"
he was acting in self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   The statement noted the unprecedented nature of the charges.
"Unfortunately, this action may have the unintended effect of causing
unnecessary American casualties in the future as combat air crews may
hesitate to exercise their right of self-defense," it said. The
charges, it said, may be driven by "an inappropriate political
agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Umbach and his lawyer could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Smith, the father of Nathan Smith, one of the Canadian
soldiers killed while participating in a nighttime training exercise
near Kandahar, said Friday from his home in Tatamagouche, Nova
Scotia, that he is not interested in revenge, but accountability.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't bring him back, so the best I can do in his memory is to
make sure that it can't happen again, " Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   A military investigation into the bombing released in its entirety
for the first time Friday found that Schmidt thought he was under
attack from the ground when he dropped the bomb. But instead of
leaving the area to assess the threat and plan a possible
counterstrike, as procedures dictate, Schmidt and the pilot of a
second plane rushed to attack, the investigation found.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a radar plane alerted Schmidt that "potential friendlies
were in the area," but the warning came too late--seconds after
Schmidt had declared he was firing in self-defense and dropped the
bomb, the inquiry found.</TE>
<TE>   A Canadian investigation found that muzzle flashes from the
training mission by the Canadian soldiers were so far below the U.S.
pilots that they posed "no threat."</TE>
<TE>   Canadian officials declined to comment on the charges Friday. A
statement released by Canadian Defense Minister John McCallum praised
the work of the U.S. and Canadian investigative bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a very good working relationship with American authorities
throughout the entire process," McCallum said in the statement.</TE>
<TE>   The case is being reviewed by Lt. Gen. Bruce Carlson, commander of
the 8th Air Force. He has three main options: dismiss the charges,
prosecute the men in a general court-martial, or convene a special
court-martial in which the maximum penalty would be six months in
jail and bad-conduct discharges, Wadsworth said.</TE>
<TE>   If Carlson chooses a general court-martial, the charges would be
heard first under Article 32 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice,
which is similar to the grand jury process in civilian courts.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Diplomat Tries to Cool Down Russian-Georgian Dispute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>A senior U.S. official on Friday sought to head off armed
confrontation between Russia and Georgia, disputing Moscow's claim
that it has the same right to preemptive action to halt Chechen
militants that Washington asserts with regard to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it is a question of prudence and judgment, and
particularly when the factual circumstances are so different as in
the situations in Georgia and Iraq," Undersecretary of State John R.
Bolton said at a news conference here.</LD>
<LD>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin threatened Wednesday to send
Russian forces into Georgia to attack Chechen guerrillas and other
militants who are taking refuge there and staging cross-border
incursions into Russia. Moscow contends that Georgian officials have
done too little to contain--and in some cases have actively
supported--the rebels.</LD>
<TE>   Putin sent an ominous message to the U.N. General Assembly on
Thursday, saying Russia was preparing military strikes at Georgian
territory.</TE>
<TE>   Russian analysts have speculated in recent days that Washington
secretly has agreed to turn a blind eye toward any Russian
intervention in Georgia in exchange for tacit support of possible
U.S. military action against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   But Bolton, at the conclusion of three days of talks with Russian
security officials, denied any such deal had been reached and pointed
out a State Department statement publicly warning Moscow against
violating Georgian sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   Bolton professed confidence that Russia and the United States will
find common ground on the issue of Iraq, which the Bush
administration maintains is developing weapons of mass destruction.
He said that Hussein's defiance of United Nations resolutions
requiring weapons inspections shows contempt for the Security
Council, whose five permanent members include Russia and the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that this affront to the authority of the Security
Council is too serious to be the subject of quid pro quo deals,"
Bolton said of rumored economic and military trade-offs. "I don't
think that's expected on the Russian side or the American side."</TE>
<TE>   Further talks between U.S. and Russian officials are expected next
week in Washington, when the two sides are scheduled to convene the
first session of their joint Consultative Group for Strategic
Security.</TE>
<TE>   Georgian President Eduard A. Shevardnadze has acknowledged the
presence of foreign extremists in his country's remote and rugged
Pankisi Gorge but insists his troops are conducting their own sweeps
to drive out the intruders. On Thursday night, Georgian police were
fired on when they intercepted armed militants in the gorge. A
Chechen gunman was wounded and captured in the shootout, but at least
two others managed to flee, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   In Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, Shevardnadze said he had sent a
letter to Putin about the Russian threat, though he declined to
disclose specifics. The former Soviet foreign minister also expressed
his gratitude to U.S. officials who reacted immediately to Putin's
bellicose statements with words of caution and unfettered support for
Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   "Following Putin's statement, I was confident that the U.S.
response would be tough, principled and in defense of Georgia's
rights," Shevardnadze said.</TE>
<TE>   Other Georgian officials also raised objections to Putin's
statements.</TE>
<TE>   Russian authorities, however, continued to press for action to
contain the Pankisi-based militants, claiming fresh proof of
terrorist preparations there.</TE>
<TE>   In Rostov-on-Don, headquarters for Russia's southern judicial
district, Deputy Prosecutor Sergei Fridinsky told reporters that his
office has obtained evidence that at least four terrorist training
bases are operating in the Pankisi region.</TE>
<TE>   The bases are used to train militants, including foreign
mercenaries, in demolition activities and in handling weaponry,
Fridinsky said. He also contended that the militants are supported by
some Georgian authorities, "including customs officials, border
guards and the military."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Army trainers have been in Georgia since spring to help
government forces learn counter-terrorism tactics.</TE>

<HD>Reward Offer Tendered for Kidnap Victim</HD>
<DH>Russia: Giant oil firm says it would pay almost $1 million
to obtain the release of a top executive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>The head of Russia's biggest oil company offered a nearly $1-million
reward Friday for information leading to the release of the company's
chief financial officer, who was abducted in an elaborate operation
that sent shudders through the business community in this untamed
capital.</LD>
<LD>   The kidnapping of Lukoil executive Sergei Kukura took place in
daylight and involved at least five men posing as traffic police
conducting document checks at a railroad crossing south of the city.</LD>
<LD>   "Unfortunately in Russia today, no matter how high a post this or
any other person occupies, they can't feel safe," Lukoil President
Vagit Alekperov said in announcing the reward.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators reportedly were looking into the possibility that
Lukoil's rivals might be involved.</TE>
<TE>   Since Russia began its chaotic transition to capitalism after more
than seven decades of Communist rule, dozens of top officials and
magnates have been gunned down or kidnapped for ransom, often by
rivals aiming to move in on their territory. But Moscow's "bandit
capitalism" was thought to have subsided in recent months with the
rise of more stable enterprises with ties to the global economy.</TE>
<TE>   Kukura, 48, was abducted about 7:30 a.m. Thursday as he was being
driven from his country house to the company's headquarters in
central Moscow. Uniformed men in two cars bearing the signature blue
license plates of police and Interior Ministry vehicles stopped his
Mercedes sedan on the pretext of checking the chauffeur's license.</TE>
<TE>   The driver and bodyguard were hooded, handcuffed, injected with a
drug and left unconscious in the Mercedes far enough off the main
road to go undetected for seven hours. Police were alerted after the
pair regained consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   "It is extremely hard to protect yourself against this kind of
kidnapping, where it's impossible to tell whether you're dealing with
real policemen or bandits dressed like cops," said Vladimir V.
Lutsenko, a former intelligence officer who runs a security company.</TE>
<TE>   "Perpetrators of these crimes as a rule get away with everything
because law enforcement bodies are incapable of resolving the
crimes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Alekperov said Lukoil would spare no expense in aiding the
investigation and seeing that the kidnappers are brought to justice.
He said the company's staff had been suffering "great moral trauma"
since the abduction.</TE>
<TE>   "I and all Lukoil employees are extremely outraged by the cynical
abduction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Russian business leaders condemned the kidnapping and lamented its
potential to set back efforts to reform commerce and root out
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "The incident is all the more repulsive as it took place now that
Russian business is becoming increasingly transparent and civilized,"
the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs said in a
statement. The business group described the kidnapping as "an attempt
to undermine the consolidated efforts of business circles to advance
the economy."</TE>
<TE>   Police throughout western Russia were on alert, but initial
accounts of the search suggested that authorities had found no trace
of the gunmen or their captive.</TE>
<TE>   Lukoil spokesman Dmitri Dolgov said the company had no comment on
whether ransom demands had been made or other contact established
with the kidnappers. The firm did not want to disclose information
that might compromise efforts to free Kukura, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A Moscow police official, however, told the Itar-Tass news agency
that nothing had been heard from the abductors. Deputy City Interior
Minister Gennady Deineko said police were proceeding on the
assumption that Kukura was targeted for his "professional activities"
rather than his wealth.</TE>
<TE>   Lukoil sources also told the news agency that they suspected
industry rivals were responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, Kukura's bodyguard and driver failed to disclose
any concrete information that could shed light on the motives for the
crime," one investigative source told Itar-Tass.</TE>
<TE>   Lukoil, with a market capitalization of $14 billion, accounts for
24% of Russia's oil production, the company says on its Web site.</TE>

<HD>Germany's Ex-Chancellor Retires From Parliament</HD>
<DH>Europe: Reunification architect Helmut Kohl leaves
political office after 26 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl retired after 26 years in
Parliament on Friday but skipped the final session, drawing rebukes
from opponents who said he was "slipping out the back door" to dodge
questions about a financial scandal.</LD>
<LD>   Kohl, chancellor for 16 years but an ordinary deputy since losing
the 1998 election, spoke in Parliament only twice in the last four
years but was embroiled in many debates as the center of Germany's
worst postwar political scandal.</LD>
<LD>   Although Kohl, 72, is hailed abroad as the architect of German
unification, his 1999 admission that he took $1 million in illegal
campaign donations while chancellor and his refusal to reveal the
money's source badly tarnished his reputation and hurt his party, the
Christian Democratic Union.</LD>
<TE>   "Kohl put himself above the law, and now he's sneaking out the
back door in order to avoid questions," said Frank Hofmann, a member
of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democratic Party and a
critic of Kohl.</TE>
<TE>   A parliamentary inquiry concluded that the Christian Democrats
under Kohl raised about $10 million in illegal campaign contributions
between 1982 and 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Although in violation of the law, the party only had to pay the
money to Parliament plus a fine.</TE>
<TE>   Kohl escaped formal punishment. After his party failed to persuade
him to reveal the source of the funds, party leaders distanced
themselves from Kohl, moving him from the second to sixth row in
Parliament and ordering him to stay quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Kohl, who entered Parliament in 1976, will maintain an office in
Berlin, a courtesy granted to all former chancellors.</TE>

<DL>AMSTERDAM</DL>
<LD>Airport police detained a Kurdish man with suspected links to Al
Qaeda as he tried to travel to Norway to visit his family, Dutch
government officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Mullah Najm Din Faraj Ahmad was arrested Thursday evening at
Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, a government official said. U.S.
officials suspect that Ahmad, also known as Mullah Krekar, leads a
militant Islamic group in northern Iraq called Ansar al-Islam.</LD>
<LD>   Ansar al-Islam is believed to operate out of several remote Iraqi
villages near the Iranian border, where it has allegedly experimented
on people and animals with chemical or biological weapons. It is said
to have about 500 members.</LD>
<TE>   Its fighters are believed to have trained with Al Qaeda, and U.S.
officials also suspect it of helping hide Al Qaeda members fleeing
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Dutch Justice Ministry spokesman Martin Bruinsma said
international talks were underway to decide whether Ahmad should be
extradited.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmad, 46, was on his way from Tehran to Norway when Dutch
intelligence agencies were tipped off that he would be stopping in
Amsterdam, the Dutch government source said. Norway granted his
family refugee status in 1992.</TE>

<HD>Freighter With Toxic Cargo Spills Fuel on Fragile S.
African Coast</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>A blazing freighter carrying toxic chemicals spilled some of its
1,300 tons of fuel Friday onto a South African coastline renowned for
its wildlife, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Pounded by high seas, the Italian freighter Jolly Rubino ruptured
at least one of its fuel tanks after it beached Thursday near the
Greater St. Lucia Wetland Park, a sanctuary for birds and rare
wetlands fauna on South Africa's northeast coast about 370 miles east
of Johannesburg.</LD>
<LD>   The vessel's cargo included 335,000 gallons of fuel oil, 80,000
gallons of gasoline and a variety of toxic chemicals including
alpha-naphthylamine, which can be particularly harmful to the
environment. A 10-yard-wide strip of oil was spotted leaking from the
ship Friday, according to a company working to rescue the vessel.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said the 30,000-ton ship lost 70 cargo containers over
its side, and they warned the public not to touch any drums found on
the beach.</TE>
<TE>   The ship's 22 crew members abandoned ship after it was crippled by
a fire that began Tuesday. Strong winds and high seas hampered
salvage operators' attempts to board the ship and put out the blaze,
but they said they would try again today.</TE>
<TE>   The vessel is about seven miles south of an estuary leading to the
main lake of the wildlife sanctuary. A serious oil slick could
pollute the nearby Umfolozi River and the sensitive estuary, which is
blocked by sand, said Jeff Gaisford, a spokesman for the provincial
parks board. It could also damage nearby mangroves, crocodiles and
hippopotamuses. "If the thing falls apart there, then we've got a big
problem. It's sort of at that make-or-break stage at the moment," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The park is recognized by the United Nations as an internationally
important wildlife site.</TE>

<LD>The Philippine government, one of the first to support the U.S.
declaration of war on terrorism after the Sept. 11 attacks, said
Friday that it will not support any plan by President Bush to strike
at Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The Philippines, a U.S. colony until 1946 and host to U.S.
military bases until 1992, said that although it continues to back
the fight against terrorists and their sponsors, it is not convinced
that Iraq should be included.</LD>
<LD>   "We do not yet see the link between terrorism and any projected
action against Iraq, with whom we enjoy good relations," said
Victoriano Lecaros, a spokesman for the Philippine Foreign Ministry.</LD>

<HD>Agents Arrest Five Men in N.Y. Raid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LACKAWANNA, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Federal agents descended on a working-class neighborhood in this old
steel town near Buffalo on Friday, raiding several houses and
arresting five men suspected of belonging to a terrorist cell,
officials and witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said five men of Yemeni descent were arrested. A senior government
official said the Justice Department plans to charge the men with
providing material support and resources to terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials said the discovery of the cell was connected to
information that also prompted the Bush administration to raise
America's terrorism alert to "code orange"--the second-highest--on
the eve of the Sept. 11 anniversary.</LD>
<TE>   A senior government official said one of the men arrested in
Lackawanna is linked to Omar Faruq, a senior Al Qaeda suspect
captured in Indonesia in June, who has provided his interrogators
with specific information suggesting that terrorist cells in Asia
were planning attacks on U.S. facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The official did not say how the two were associated.</TE>
<TE>   Lackawanna Mayor John Kuryak said he was told six months ago that
the FBI was conducting an investigation here as a national security
matter.</TE>
<TE>   "When you first hear about it, you do get that initial shiver. You
almost tell yourself: 'Not in your back yard. Not in my community.'
But that was for a split second," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "No one can be that naive or take anything for granted these days
since 9/11."</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday, police and FBI agents still had one street blocked
off in the area where neighbors say at least four houses, a garage
and an Arab social club were raided. Agents were seen taking two
boxes and a blue cooler from an apartment above an Arab deli.</TE>
<TE>   Lackawanna Police Capt. Ronald Miller confirmed that there were
arrests in the city, just south of Buffalo. But he would say only
that those arrested were U.S. citizens.</TE>
<TE>   One resident, Albaneh Mosed, said FBI agents burst into his home
and arrested his 24-year-old brother, Shafal. He denied that his
brother had any links to terrorism. "If he was a terrorist, I'd be
the first to know," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mosed said his brother, who is married and is the father of a
3-year-old, attended community college and recently got a job as a
telemarketer.</TE>
<TE>   FBI spokesman Paul Moskal wouldn't disclose or confirm any of the
men's identities.</TE>

<HD>Key Al Qaeda Suspect Is Held</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: U.S. officials say the man captured in a
shootout this week in Pakistan played a major role in the Sept. 11
hijacking plot. Separately, near Buffalo, N.Y., federal agents arrest
five suspects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER and BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. and Pakistani officials said Friday that authorities had
captured Ramzi Binalshibh, a suspected organizer of the Sept. 11
attacks who may also have been planning to be the 20th hijacker.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials confirmed that Pakistan had identified Binalshibh
as one of eight Al Qaeda operatives captured by Pakistani authorities
during a prolonged shootout in the bustling port city of Karachi on
Wednesday. U.S. officials confirmed that the CIA and other U.S.
agencies helped in the raid and the arrest of Binalshibh.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest ended an intense manhunt and came amid criticism that
the U.S.-led war on terrorism has been largely unsuccessful because
so many leaders of the Al Qaeda network remain fugitives.</LD>
<TE>   German authorities issued an international arrest warrant for
Binalshibh, a former Hamburg roommate of hijack plot leader Mohamed
Atta, less than two weeks after Sept. 11. Authorities had been
hunting for him since.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a significant blow to Al Qaeda," one U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate development, authorities said five men of Yemeni
descent, at least some of them American citizens, were arrested near
Buffalo, N.Y., on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activity. The
officials said more details would be provided today.</TE>
<TE>   In Binalshibh's case, Pakistani officials said that they captured
eight Al Qaeda operatives--six of Yemeni origin, as well as an
Egyptian and a Saudi--and that one of them was a "very senior" member
of the terrorist organization who had been the subject of an
intensive international manhunt.</TE>
<TE>   Several U.S. officials confirmed that the suspected senior
operative was Binalshibh, a 30-year-old Yemeni who authorities
believe played a central role in the terrorist plot.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Pakistani officials would not comment on where Binalshibh
was being held.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say that besides being in on the Sept. 11 plot from
the beginning, Binalshibh tried at least four times to gain entry
into the United States but was denied a visa each time. They believe
that he intended to be the fifth hijacker on one of the four
commandeered planes and that he later tried to help get accused
terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui onto the plane in his place by wiring
him money and providing other logistical help.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh also wired money to several of the hijackers in the
United States and to a Florida flight school at which one of the
hijackers was training, according to the indictment of Moussaoui.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, the only surviving suspect to be charged in U.S.
courts, is set to stand trial in the United States early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh "was the 20th hijacker, and he was the money man. The
question is, what is he going to reveal and what records can they
find?" said Steven Emerson, an expert on Al Qaeda who consults for
Congress on terrorism issues.</TE>
<TE>   "He clearly could answer a lot of questions. He has it in his
head. It depends on if he talks. But this is very significant. If he
flips, he could provide information on cells here, and in Europe, and
could help with the prosecution of Moussaoui, which isn't going
well."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials discussed the case on condition of anonymity,
citing the extraordinary sensitivity of taking a top Al Qaeda
operative into custody in Pakistan, particularly in Karachi, where
anti-American fervor is strong.</TE>
<TE>   They also said Pakistani and U.S. officials had tried to keep the
arrest confidential in order not to tip off more Al Qaeda operatives
believed to be hiding in the Karachi area.</TE>
<TE>   Chief among them may be Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a shadowy figure
who is thought to have come up with the idea for the Sept. 11
attacks. A journalist for the Arab satellite TV station Al Jazeera
reported last week that he had met recently with Binalshibh and
Mohammed in or near Karachi. In their interviews with Al Jazeera, the
two men seemed to taunt the United States.</TE>
<TE>   News of Binalshibh's arrest, first reported by ABC News,
circulated in the United Nations on Friday, where Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf, President Bush and other world leaders met this
week. Musharraf's position "has been that we have gotten some people
in custody and that one of them is a very important person who you
[the United States] have been looking for," a Pakistani official said
in an interview with The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a near certainty that it is him," the official said,
referring to Binalshibh. "From all indications from all sources, it
is quite probable that it is him."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Pakistani officials said all that remained was a final,
conclusive identification of Binalshibh, who has apparently eluded
capture for the past year by using a number of aliases.</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistani official said Pakistan's intelligence agency, the
Inter-Services Intelligence unit, was responsible for the capture of
the Al Qaeda members in the shootout, which lasted four hours.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani commandos traded automatic gunfire with the Al Qaeda
suspects, who were holed up in an apartment. The gun battle was so
fierce that it spilled out onto adjoining rooftops, and two suspects
were killed and several officers wounded.</TE>
<TE>   "The ISI led the operation," the Pakistani official said. "This
shows that despite the criticism of them, that they are a full
partner in the war on terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   The ISI has long been criticized for not investigating Al Qaeda
activity in Pakistan or even protecting members of the terrorist
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh allegedly worked closely with some of the 19 hijackers
when they plotted the Sept. 11 attacks from an apartment in Hamburg,
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   German authorities have said the planning for a major attack
against the United States appears to have started in October 1999.
Within six months, the Hamburg group's Al Qaeda sponsors reportedly
fixed on the World Trade Center as a fitting target.</TE>
<TE>   Cell members then set off for Afghanistan in two groups for
training, German authorities said. Other hijackers followed several
months later. They used their time in the Afghan training camps to
work out details of the attacks with their Al Qaeda hosts, according
to the German officials.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh was born in Hadramawt, a mountain valley region of
Yemen that is Osama bin Laden's ancestral home. While all the other
members of the Hamburg cell came to Germany as college students,
Binalshibh came in 1995 seeking political asylum under a false name.</TE>
<TE>   He was assigned to live in a small camp for asylum seekers and
lived for two years in a government barracks so cramped and austere
government workers referred to it as a container camp. He was among a
group of Arabs camp administrators called "the bulls" because they
were aggressive in complaints about their living conditions.
Binalshibh was the tamest of the bulls, "always in the background.
When there was trouble he would disappear," said Michael Hirsekorn,
the camp's administrator.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh's asylum appeal was eventually denied, but he already
had returned to Yemen. However, he reapplied under his real name,
received a German visa and eventually applied to a couple of German
colleges. He never attended classes regularly.</TE>
<TE>   In the winter of 1998, Atta, Binalshibh and Said Bahaji, who is
being sought by authorities, moved into a neat, newly refurbished
three-bedroom apartment at Marienstrasse 54, near Atta's university.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has been searching for Binalshibh, particularly

<HD>Hong Kong Plans to Draft Law Against Subversion</HD>
<DH>China: Restrictions on political parties also are expected.
Activists see a threat to free speech.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>Human rights advocates Friday braced for their next battle to
preserve this quasi-autonomous region's democratic freedoms after the
local government said it will soon introduce a controversial
anti-subversion law.</LD>
<LD>   "It is time we must do it," Hong Kong Justice Secretary Elsie
Leung told reporters gathered outside her office Friday morning amid
mounting media speculation that such a move was imminent.</LD>
<LD>   An aide to Leung, who declined to be identified, said
consultations "will start soon" to draft legislation defining the
crimes of treason, secession, sedition and subversion against
Beijing. Any new law would also bar political organizations from
establishing ties with counterparts abroad.</LD>
<TE>   Hong Kong's Basic Law, the former British colony's de facto
constitution, expressly requires the regional government to enact
such legislation. However, it sets no timetable and democracy
advocates have consistently viewed any step toward drafting them as a
threat to personal freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rush to legislation that's somewhat sinister," said Paul
Harris, chairman of the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor. "What's the
need for this, unless it's to suppress people uttering statements
that are politically unpleasant for the government to hear. I think
you'll see widespread community concern."</TE>
<TE>   The move is also seen as the latest challenge to the democratic
freedoms granted to Hong Kong under the terms of its return to
Chinese sovereignty five years ago. That unique experiment--known as
"one country, two systems"--has been under sporadic pressure ever
since.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Hong Kong's independent judiciary was compromised when
Beijing overturned a local court ruling on residency rights in the
region. More recently, Hong Kong authorities have refused entry to
people seen by Beijing as troublesome.</TE>
<TE>   At a hastily called news conference Friday, Democratic Party
Chairman Martin Lee cited reports that local government officials had
already consulted with Beijing on the issue. He said any new law
would be an invitation for Beijing to act against free speech in Hong
Kong.</TE>
<TE>   "The first will be the Falun Gong, next would be the Hong Kong
Alliance and after that maybe my party," he said. The Falun Gong
spiritual movement has been outlawed on the mainland, while the Hong
Kong Alliance supports democracy forces on the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   Lee said that a consultative document on the new subversion law
had been printed and likely would be presented to a meeting of the
region's Executive Council as early as next week. The government
declined to confirm this.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot comment on any timetable for consultation," said Monica
Chan, a spokeswoman for the Department of Security, which also would
be involved in drafting the law.</TE>
<TE>   Several Western nations have quietly expressed concerns about the
possibility of such legislation. Susan N. Stevenson, a spokeswoman
for the American Consulate General in Hong Kong, indicated Friday
that the U.S. and others would be monitoring developments closely.</TE>
<TE>   "The international community will want to see that proposals for
legislation are consistent with international human rights standards
and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, to
which Hong Kong is a party," she said.</TE>

<HD>Bush Seeks a 'Quick Resolution' on Iraq</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN and ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Friday said he wants a "quick resolution" to the
confrontation with Iraq, as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
launched a diplomatic offensive to win international support for a
showdown with President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   In ongoing consultations at the United Nations, Powell is
discussing a six-month deadline for finding and dismantling any
weapons of mass destruction that Iraq might possess, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Bush, before a meeting with Central African leaders Friday, said
he is "highly doubtful" that Hussein would comply with the
long-standing U.N. requirements for inspections to show whether Iraq
has eliminated such weapons.</LD>
<TE>   Bush urged the world body to quickly pass a new resolution
demanding Iraqi compliance.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking days and weeks, not months and years," Bush said of
U.N. action.</TE>
<TE>   The president also expressed scorn for congressional Democrats who
want the U.N. to take up the question of dealing with Iraq before the
U.S. Congress does.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine an elected member of the United States Senate or
House of Representatives saying: 'I think I'm going to wait for the
United Nations to make a decision,' " Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The president's tough talk--only a day after he appeared before
the U.N. General Assembly and challenged the world body to join the
anti-Iraq campaign--underscored his desire to accelerate the pace of
a confrontation with Hussein's regime.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, his impassioned plea for congressional action on
Iraq "as quickly as possible" all but ensures that the issue will
play a central role in the congressional election campaigns being
waged across the country.</TE>
<TE>   The chief U.N. weapons inspector, meanwhile, warned Friday that it
would take four or five months of preparation before inspections
could resume in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "If they want thorough and complete inspections, it's not
compatible with something hasty," said Hans Blix, executive chairman
of the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The president on Thursday challenged the U.N. to force Iraq to not
only disarm, but also comply with the 15 other Security Council
resolutions that Baghdad agreed to in 1991 at the end of the Persian
Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Bush detailed what he called Iraq's "decade of deception and
defiance," saying Hussein had reneged on his promises to end
political repression and torture, repatriate prisoners of war after
the Gulf War and distribute humanitarian goods and medical supplies
to his people.</TE>
<TE>   Bush returned to the White House on Friday, but Powell stayed
behind. The secretary of State described his lengthy talks with the
other 14 members of the Security Council as "very constructive."</TE>
<TE>   "I think all the members of the council are now seized with the
issue [of pushing Iraq to comply with the U.N. resolutions],
recognize the challenge that Iraq does present to international law
and to the mandate of the Security Council," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're off to a good start," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The five permanent members who have veto power on the Security
Council--the U.S., Russia, China, France and Britain--came to broad
agreement on one goal.</TE>
<TE>   "There was complete unanimity on getting the weapons inspectors
back into Iraq," British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told reporters
after the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, which has the potential to thwart the U.S. push for a
tougher stance toward Hussein because of its long-standing alliance
and trade deals with Iraq, signed on in principle.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraqi noncompliance with the relevant Security Council
resolutions is a serious matter and Iraq must comply," Foreign
Minister Igor S. Ivanov said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Prime Ministers Junichiro Koizumi of Japan and Silvio
Berlusconi of Italy endorsed international action as the way to exert
new pressure on Baghdad. Berlusconi is scheduled to have lunch with
Bush today at Camp David in Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   However, in a speech at the U.N., Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan stressed his government's preference for avoiding force.</TE>
<TE>   "Efforts should be made to prevent the arbitrary enlargement of
the scope of a counter-terrorism campaign," Tang said.</TE>
<TE>   The first day of intense diplomacy following Bush's U.N. speech
focused on principles rather than specifics.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bush administration already faced one possible setback on
the formula for U.N. action--particularly on the question of how many
resolutions the U.N. should adopt.</TE>
<TE>   Though Washington is "still open" to more than one resolution, a
senior State Department official said, behind closed doors the U.S.
is pushing for a single resolution that would cite the Iraqi regime
for already breaching the world body's previous resolutions. The new
measure would allow Baghdad one final opportunity to destroy any
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons it might possess.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. proposal would then call for "intrusive inspections" to
verify disarmament, with specific language that any attempt to impede
the inspectors or failure to disarm would lead to an immediate
finding of a material breach--one that would empower member nations
to force Iraq to comply. But it would not specifically authorize the
United States to launch military action.</TE>
<TE>   However, many other nations, including France and Britain, are
discussing two resolutions, separating the issues of weapons
inspections and the potential response by U.N. members in the event
that Iraq refuses to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   The other major issue of debate is the timeline for action. In
this regard, the European thinking is more in tune with that of the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Although Powell is discussing a six-month deadline for finding and
dismantling any Iraqi weaponry, U.S. officials said the
administration is willing to consider a one-year deadline--in part
because it may be irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   The widespread assumption is that Iraq would balk within a matter
of weeks, U.S. officials said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz on Friday rejected
unconditional weapons inspections--prompting White House Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer to charge: "Obviously, they have something to
hide."</TE>
<TE>   Powell will be in New York on Monday for further talks on
specifics of U.N. action. "Next week, the heavy lifting begins," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Bush's appeal for a new international coalition against
Iraq won plaudits from many nations, he and his senior advisors
continue to make clear that the U.S. is prepared to act unilaterally,
if necessary, to drive Hussein from power.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also said he does not expect Hussein to suddenly begin
complying with the U.N. demands.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope he does. But I'm highly doubtful," Bush said. "The reason
I'm doubtful is, he's had 11 years to meet the demands. For 11 long
years, he has basically told the United Nations and the world he
doesn't care."</TE>
<TE>   Bush reiterated his view that the U.N.'s credibility and relevance
are on the line.</TE>
<TE>   "How we deal with this problem will help determine the fate of
[the] multilateral body, which has been unilaterally ignored by
Saddam Hussein," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, while many congressional Democrats continued to
express caution about how to proceed against Iraq, Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.) staked out a strongly pro-administration
position.</TE>
<TE>   In a Senate speech, he declared that lawmakers must not ignore
Bush's call for a congressional resolution authorizing action against
Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the president's prerogative," Lieberman said. "Each
member of the Senate must and, I am confident, will face that reality
in a spirit of nonpartisanship."</TE>
<TE>   He said he intends to work with his colleagues and the White House
to draft a Senate resolution to express congressional support "for
the president, as commander in chief, as he works to protect our
nation and the world from Saddam Hussein."</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats are reluctant to take up the Iraq question before
the November elections because they fear that candidates in close
races would be forced to take difficult stands for or against war.</TE>
<TE>   Some Democratic leaders argue that a way to take the politics out
of the debate would be to postpone a vote until after the elections.</TE>

<LD>Re "Catholics Called Wrong Not to Evangelize Jews," Sept. 7: This Jew
would like to take the opportunity to say something to those windbag
Neanderthal evangelicals: Leave us alone! At least the Catholic
Church, which persecuted us viciously for centuries, sort of "gets
it," however halfheartedly.</LD>
<LD>   We Jews would appreciate it if you would stop making us the target
of your obsessions. It's like we're a lover who left you and you keep
stalking us, hoping we'll come back to you. Every time you make
statements about us "going to hell" for not accepting Jesus Christ as
our savior, you show your extreme ignorance and hatred. Get over it.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go have some gefilte fish.</LD>
<LD>   Alvin Epstein</LD>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What most Christians don't get is that although the belief is that
we are saved through Christ and him alone, this salvation happens
whether we know him or not. People--be they Jew, Muslim, Christian or
agnostic--who do the will of God and do not believe in Christ through
ignorance participate in God's plan of salvation. This, however,
should not preclude one from sharing the love of Christ with others,
as this is something that he has commissioned all Christians to do
with charity.</TE>
<TE>   The essence of evangelization is living the life, thus allowing
for evangelization by example. St. Francis said it best, telling us
to evangelize always but use words only when necessary.
Unfortunately, we are often guilty of more words than works.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Kishel</TE>
<TE>   Valencia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Only someone visiting here from another planet could possibly
believe that evangelism has any purpose except conversion. The phrase
"Jews need to hear the Gospel" is truly chilling. What if we don't
want to hear, knowing full well that what "hear" really means is
"accept." As soon as a person believes that his god is the one true
god, then anyone who believes something different must be mistaken.
The evangelist sees it as his obligation to educate those who are
mistaken.</TE>
<TE>   But if education doesn't work, try indoctrination; if that doesn't
work, try expulsion; and if that doesn't work, well, we all know too
well what's next. I have a suggestion for evangelists of all
persuasions: Be the most ethical Christian/Jew/Muslim you can be.
Self-improvement is a full-time job and, if undertaken seriously,
will leave you no time to subvert the faith of others.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Cohen</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In your article, Southern Baptist official Jim Sibley states that
asking Christians to stop evangelizing Jews is "akin to asking Jews
to eat ham and cheese sandwiches." Has it escaped him that in
evangelizing Jews, he is essentially doing exactly that? I wonder how
well Sibley would respond if another denomination made a point of
aggressively instructing Southern Baptists on why their cherished and
deeply held beliefs will doom them to eternal damnation.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Reparations: A Scam Cloaked in Racial Pain," Commentary, Sept. 9:
Jonathan Turley's arguments spotlighting a con game pale when
compared with those of an advocate and colleague like Randall
Robinson, in his book "The Debt." Turley dredges up the statute of
limitations, as if blacks have been dawdling for 400 years in their
quest, not for repair of an injury, but for equal justice.</LD>
<LD>   His decrying of the "racism" of Louis Farrakhan when the founders
of this nation and their descendants were and are indeed racist does
not even rise to the level of disingenuousness. Perhaps he thinks the
poor academic showing of inner-city schools and the absence of
minorities at the corporate ownership level are the consequence of
inferior genes.</LD>
<LD>   Legal precedent? What legal precedent sent money and supplies to
Western Europe following World War II? And no one needs to "play the
race card" in this country, since racism has been a constant since
its inception. Racial animus seems to be identified only when
strident calls for justice are heard. Our ethnic and gender caste
system is not just injurious, it is unjust. And its abolishment
requires another precedent-breaking decision such as Brown vs. Board
of Education. Similarly, the current plaintiffs, or their successors,
will prevail despite the meanderings of Turley, et al.</LD>
<TE>   F. Daniel Gray</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Turley has been the brightest voice of reason on your pages over
the past few months. But on the reparations issue he was so focused
on the law that he forgot about fairness. So what if there's no legal
basis for reparations? Our attention should be on the fact that 35
million Americans, descended from the slaves in an ugly part of this
nation's past, exist for the most part in a "freedom" that prevents
them from competing on an even basis with those other Americans of
color who have come here voluntarily, with their cultures intact. The
reparations this country owes black Americans are not money in their
pockets but better schools and safe circumstances in which to raise
their children. They have been playing catch-up with the general
population ever since emancipation.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Slave's Sons Seek to Heal Wounds with Reparations," Sept. 8:
If the black culture has been allegedly crippled by the shadow of
slavery, how can the successes of Venus and Serena Williams, Tiger
Woods, Magic Johnson, Oprah Winfrey, Denzel Washington, Halle Berry,
Colin Powell, etc., be explained? An injustice that occurred more
than 100 years ago is irrelevant to the woes of modern
underachievers. Reparations are an insult to hard-working people who
don't play the blame game.</TE>

<TE>   A quick review of two concepts: Those on each side always ask for
more than they think they'll get in a negotiation; an apology is an
acknowledgment that a wrong has been committed. Anti-reparations
advocates/slavery apologists are having trouble with both.</TE>

<LD>Re "Film Agency Donations Questioned," Sept. 10: After experiencing
10 consecutive nights of filming along Monte Vista in Highland Park,
it is clear to me and my neighbors that the Entertainment Industry
Development Corp. cannot be trusted with the responsibility of
issuing film permits.</LD>
<LD>   In a working-class neighborhood where young families need to sleep
at night, motorcycle chases and accidents were filmed from 6 p.m. to
6 a.m. The noise and the inability to drive and park in our
neighborhood were untenable. My family was never surveyed, and we
were given one day's notice of filming.</LD>
<LD>   The private use of the public domain should not be taken lightly.
Film permits should be issued by a public agency that is accountable,
respectful and responsible. Apparently the EIDC does not fit these
criteria.</LD>
<TE>   Karra Bikson Moga</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a film professional and someone familiar with the machinations
of the EIDC, I find it laughable that recipients of huge political
contributions, which amount to a gift of public funds, feign
ignorance. These are the political cognoscenti, sophisticated elected
officials who are "shocked, shocked to find gambling at Rick's."</TE>
<TE>   I wrote to Mayor James Hahn regarding the inappropriate expansion
of the EIDC into the film location business. The EIDC has taken over
numerous publicly owned facilities (usually in mothballs) and
"cleaned them up." Now a facility that previously rented for $300 per
day costs nearly $5,000 per day. (Which is one strange way to keep
filmmakers in L.A.) There is a clear conflict of interest for an
entity that facilitates permits to be in the location business.</TE>
<TE>   As for the ongoing "catered affair" at the expense of taxpayers,
these political contributions are the tip of the iceberg in what has
been a big mistake. The EIDC was formed in the "business can do
better than government" days, when elaborate schemes like Enron and
WorldCom were in their formation, aided and abetted by politicians
who solicited huge contributions and provided the "hands-off"
approach. Only the hands-off approach, in this case, didn't serve the
public or promote filming. Cody Cluff, Mike Bobenko, et al, have run
the film office as a personal fiefdom and funneled contributions to
politicians and political causes to ensure their survival.</TE>
<TE>   The days of corporate welfare, patronage and plausible deniability
should be over, and I can think of no better place to start than with
the EIDC. As we say in the business, "That's a wrap!"</TE>
<TE>   Chris Fuentes</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Those of us who are unfortunate enough to live adjacent to favored
film industry "shoot houses" have long been suspicious of the folks
at the EIDC. I have found it very odd that film production companies
with seemingly unlimited budgets for lavishly catered crew lunches
pay only a few hundred dollars to the city for permits to destroy a
neighborhood. And your revealing Sept. 7 article suggests that much
of that meager sum may not be making it to the city coffers.</TE>
<TE>   I now have an idea why the EIDC president, Cluff, was always
"traveling outside the country" when I called to complain to him
about a violation in my neighborhood and why L.A. City Councilwoman
Cindy Miscikowski never followed through on her staff's promise to
intervene on behalf of neighbors who are sick of constant filming,
with fumes from gas-powered generators, dangerous traffic conditions
and surly location managers who feel they own the street.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Braude</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Movie companies frequently shoot movies in San Pedro and the Port
of Los Angeles. Often I am irritated when a restaurant I want to go
to or a street I want to use is closed. However, I always thought
that the movie companies were paying the city for the privilege of
closing the street.</TE>
<TE>   I was surprised to find that part of this money goes to a
quasi-public agency--whatever that is. Instead of money going to the
general fund, it is spent on cigars that I cannot buy, to pay 100%
tips at exclusive restaurants that I cannot afford and to fund
overseas junkets that I cannot go on. Our elected leaders, who sit on
the board of this agency, are accepting political contributions from
it.</TE>
<TE>   Worst of all, when county auditors tried to audit the books of
this quasi-public agency, they had to get a search warrant. The
people running this agency have demonstrated bad judgment in the
expenditure of movie company fees and are grossly arrogant when it
requires a search warrant to retrieve financial records in need of an
audit. The city and county leadership should pull out of the EIDC and
issue all future permits. By doing this we can stop the political
contributions, place movie fees in the general fund, have regular
audits and hold our elected representatives responsible.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Burks</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Any evidence of ongoing illegal activity provides the city of L.A.
and the county with a real opportunity to cancel the contracts with
the EIDC. Past demonstrated failures of the EIDC to control runaway
production and prevent "neighborhood burnout" have not been enough to
overcome the conflicts of interest and political clout in the
relationship between the film industry and our elected and appointed
representatives. Anyone with visions of a better L.A. recognizes the
need to go beyond the limits of being a company town.</TE>
<TE>   It is a change of attitude for The Times to begin to recognize the
corruption inherent in the relationship between any government and a
self-permitting and self-regulating industry. The district attorney's
office is to be congratulated. It is time to develop a better, public
system to regulate an industry that must not consider itself beyond
the rule of law.</TE>

<LD>We all read in The Times about the fatal shooting of three employees
at a Westside Koo Koo Roo restaurant by a suspected gang member (Aug.
29). The incident was horrible, and my heart goes out to the victims'
loved ones. But I had to wonder: If the shooting had happened in
Pacoima or the Eastside, would The Times have paid as much attention?</LD>
<LD>   Most people don't know that as of August, 39 homicides have
occurred in the LAPD's Hollenbeck Division this year. That's up from
23 Hollenbeck murders from January to August 2001. Citizens living in
the Rampart Division had to cope with 29 homicides as of August. The
Northeast and Central divisions were also hit with a respective 18
and eight homicides during this same period. Where was The Times?</LD>
<LD>   The Times has provided voracious coverage of the Danielle van Dam
rape and murder case, which took place outside L.A. County. Bonny Lee
Bakley's Studio City murder, in which Robert Blake is the prime
suspect, also garners steady attention.</LD>
<TE>   The LAPD's Hollenbeck, Rampart, Northeast and Central divisions
are all a stone's throw away from The Times' Spring Street offices.
From January to August, these regions had collectively suffered
through almost 100 homicides. Yet readers probably remain ignorant of
the ongoing mayhem, unless they live in the areas.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the people in favor of San Fernando Valley secession feel
this type of discrepancy when they claim to feel like the city's
"stepchildren" compared with those living "over the hill." Since
2000, Valley residents experienced a crime surge, with homicide rates
jumping by 80% in early 2002. Many of these killings occurred in the
Northeast San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Reducing homicides is doable. In East Los Angeles--an
unincorporated area of L.A. County--homicide rates have decreased to
the single digits, a 30-year low. This change occurred in large part
because of the East Los Angeles Task Force, designed to help
neighbors and law enforcement work together to deter crime.</TE>
<TE>   West Los Angeles overall enjoys more media coverage simply because
this area possesses the city's biggest tourist attractions. But if
The Times' goal is to accurately chronicle Los Angeles' full history,
then the rest of the city must be covered with the same intensity.</TE>

<LD>Re "Activists Challenge U.S. Plan for Desert," Sept. 7: When, oh
when, are our national treasures going to be left in peace for future
generations and the native species that have lived in them for eons?</LD>
<LD>   As for opening up more of the fragile, beautiful desert to
off-road vehicles, where is the sense? Paul Turcke, a Boise, Idaho,
attorney "who has become a leading voice for off-road vehicle
enthusiasts," says that allowing gas-powered machines with huge tires
designed to grip and pulverize earth would do no damage to desert
washes and that "good science" supports that. Where did this good
science come from? And, more important, who paid for this science?</LD>
<LD>   I have some property in Joshua Tree, and there is a wash near my
house. I have seen firsthand the destruction of this wash by the
assault of three or four kids on all-terrain vehicles. These industry
shills have probably never even set foot in the desert. I invite
off-road industry representatives to contact me, and I'll gladly show
them what their good science results in. This madness has to stop.</LD>

<TE>   The federal agency folks don't understand their job. They say
their goal is to find the middle ground between users of the
desert--and imply that environmentalists are just another user group
and that plants and animals have no say. Wrong!</TE>
<TE>   Since 1980 it has been their job to designate vehicle routes in
the desert. Since 1990 it has been their job to incorporate the
recovery of the tortoise into their management plans. The current
plan does neither. They are not the "Bureau of Land Use Umpires,"
they are the Bureau of Land Management. Seemingly, once again, a
judge will have to tell them what that means.</TE>

<TE>   Special-interest groups consistently ignore the fragile nature of
desert ecosystems. It is typical of these organizations--and the Bush
administration, for that matter--to ignore the research and
recommendations of ecologists, biologists, archeologists and other
scientists with hundreds of years of combined experience in desert
ecology. Turcke claims that it is possible to allow vehicular use in
desert washes without harming the environment. Turcke's "good
science" is evidently not that which is subject to peer review. Good
science might be defined as "that with which we agree."</TE>

<HD>Wage Law Advocate Named to CRA</HD>

<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Madeline Janis-Aparicio, a leading advocate of Los Angeles' living
wage law, was confirmed Friday in her bid to land a spot on the
city's redevelopment board.</LD>
<LD>   She was one of several commission appointments the City Council
approved for various panels. Janis-Aparicio's appointment to the
Community Redevelopment Agency attracted attention, both because of
her outspoken views on the wage law and because she is one of several
people nominated by Mayor James K. Hahn at the suggestion of labor
leaders helping him fight San Fernando Valley and Hollywood
secession.</LD>
<LD>   Although the confirmation vote was unanimous, two council members
voiced reservations about her appointment.</LD>
<TE>   Councilwoman Jan Perry said she feared that the head of the Los
Angeles Alliance for a New Economy might use her new post to stifle
development.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Nate Holden said Janis-Aparicio has been across the
table from developers in the past, demanding worker protections and
living wages in exchange for supporting their projects.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, if you ask me, you're crossing the line," Holden said.
"You're known as an advocate. If you sit on the CRA board, that's a
conflict."</TE>
<TE>   Janis-Aparicio said she adds to the diversity of opinion on the
board and supports development, as long as it is responsible.</TE>
<TE>   The council also approved the mayor's appointment of Sergio
Rascon, business manager of Laborer's Union Local 300, as one of six
new members of the Los Angeles Convention and Exhibition Center
Authority. Both the city and the county appoint members to the panel,
which has no city residence requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn' appointments drew the ire of secession leaders who said none
are from the Los Angeles portion of the San Fernando Valley. Rascon
is from the city of San Fernando, and Sheldon Lytton is from
Calabasas, while the others live south of Mulholland Drive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a slap in the face of the Valley, where people are already
saying they are underrepresented," said Karen Moran, a spokeswoman
for the Valley Independence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's office defended the appointments.</TE>
<TE>   "Sergio Rascon represents thousands of laborers, many of whom live
in the Valley, and the mayor has appointed dozens of Valley residents
to other commissions, including police, fire, airports, DWP and
planning," spokeswoman Julie Wong said.</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit Targets Firms Linked to Belmont Debacle</HD>
<DH>Education: The $50-million suit alleges that bungling left
an estimated 10,000 students without a community high school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A $50-million lawsuit was filed this week on behalf of youngsters who
would have attended the unfinished Belmont Learning Complex but still
ride buses long distances to overcrowded high schools.</LD>
<LD>   The suit is against, among others, firms that designed Belmont or
started construction on it.</LD>
<LD>   It alleges that they bungled the handling of environmental
problems and have left an estimated 10,000 students without a new
neighborhood school since 1999, the original completion date.</LD>
<TE>   An audit by the Los Angeles Unified School District inspector
general that year determined that several companies had failed to
notify the district of environmental dangers at the site, including
underground methane and hydrogen sulfide gases.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole point of this lawsuit is to hold accountable those who
made it impossible to open Belmont on time," said Roger Carrick, the
attorney who filed the suit. "We are seeking restitution for what
these children lost by not being able to go to this school."</TE>
<TE>   The school district in March decided to complete the half-built
high school near downtown that it abandoned two years ago because of
fears of the pollution.</TE>
<TE>   It is preparing plans for environmental mitigation.</TE>
<TE>   Carrick said he felt compelled to file the lawsuit because Los
Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley had not completed an
investigation about Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extraordinary that you can have more than $180 million of
public money put into this project and have nothing to show for it
and no prosecutions," said Carrick, a private attorney who worked on
the 1999 inspector general audit and as a special counsel to the city
attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,
said her agency would publish a lengthy report on the Belmont debacle
in the future, but she declined to comment now on any aspect of the
project.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at McLarand, Vasquez &amp; Partners Inc., an architecture
firm named in the suit, declined to discuss the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at other companies named in the lawsuit--including the
O'Melveny &amp; Myers law firm, Temple Beaudry Partners liability company
and Kajima Engineering and Construction--either did not return calls
or could not be reached for comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The school district is not a defendant in the lawsuit. Carrick
said the district had been omitted because any money won from the
school district, "you would be taking out of kids' pockets."</TE>
<TE>   In a September 1999 audit, Inspector General Don Mullinax
recommended that the district pursue legal action against a series of
firms that worked on Belmont because they had failed to notify
district officials about underground toxins at the 34-acre site.</TE>
<TE>   The district referred its findings to several law enforcement
agencies, including the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   During his successful campaign for the district attorney's office,
Steve Cooley criticized then-incumbent Gil Garcetti for failing to
prosecute any of the companies or individuals involved in the Belmont
scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Contreras and two of his children are among the
plaintiffs in the lawsuit. He said that students deserved
compensation for suffering through hourlong bus rides to crowded
schools.</TE>
<TE>   The district used eminent domain to condemn Contreras' house, he
said, for the Belmont construction, and the family moved nearby,
hoping to enroll children at the new school.</TE>
<TE>   "If this school was going to offer everything they claimed it was
going to offer, I was going to give my kids the opportunity go
there," Contreras said. "We deserved that school. We've lived there
all our lives."</TE>
<TE>   After construction stalled in 1999, Contreras moved to La Puente,
where his children attend school.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the school district lost a Superior Court lawsuit that
accused the O'Melveny &amp; Myers law firm of malpractice in its advice
to the district about Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   In April, the firm agreed to pay the district $3 million, and the
district agreed not to appeal the court decision.</TE>

<HD>Both Sides of School District Breakup Effort Denounce
Secessionists</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Proponents of breaking up the Los Angeles Unified School District
joined with district officials Friday to denounce claims by
supporters of San Fernando Valley's secession, who say that cityhood
would lead to a separate Valley school district.</LD>
<LD>   "Seceding from the city of Los Angeles has nothing to do with the
schools," said Stephanie Carter, the chief petitioner in an effort
nine months ago to break up the school district.</LD>
<LD>   Secession "will not affect L.A. Unified at all," said school board
member Julie Korenstein, who joined Carter at a Reseda news
conference.</LD>
<TE>   With them were former Rep. Bobbie Fiedler, a longtime advocate of
the breakup of Los Angeles Unified, and school board President
Caprice Young.</TE>
<TE>   Secession proponents acknowledge that cityhood alone would not
create a new school district for the San Fernando Valley. But they
have placed the schools issue prominently in their literature and
made it one of their talking points in debates.</TE>
<TE>   They argue that, while breaking up Los Angeles would not
immediately create a new school district, a new Valley city would be
in a strong position to press for its own district.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what would happen if there was a city standing in
front of them the size of the San Fernando Valley saying we want our
own school district," said Richard Katz, co-chairman of the San
Fernando Valley Independence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what would happen. We don't know because it's never
happened before," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Carter and Fiedler, who joined in the breakup petition nine
months ago, said the process does not work that way.</TE>
<TE>   "Years ago, there was a relationship between the city of Los
Angeles and the Los Angeles Unified School District," Fiedler said.
Today, the district comprises part or all of 28 cities, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The process for breaking up a district is long and arduous,
Fiedler and Carter said. And the state Board of Education, which
studies any such proposals, does not consider whether the petitioner
is a large city or a single person.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, the state board looks at issues such as whether there will
be enough school buildings in any new district, the effects on the
remaining parts of the district and the overall functioning of the
existing district, Young said.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent case, the state board said it wanted to give
the reforms and innovations in Los Angeles Unified a chance to work,
Young said. The board also said that there would be too few schools
in the rest of the district if the Valley portion were removed.</TE>

<HD>Closing of Clinic Leaves Many in Lurch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine public health clinics across Los Angeles County closed down
Friday, part of a controversial plan to trim millions from a
health-care budget that county officials said had ballooned out of
control.</LD>
<LD>   But after a long and noisy political battle to try to save the
clinics, the Alhambra Health Center, one of the nine, will disappear
quietly.</LD>
<LD>   The clinic's double doors will be locked on Monday, with signs
taped to the windows telling people where they can go for medical
care. The television set will no longer flicker in the lobby. And the
doctors and nurses who dispensed care to the poor and uninsured who
once crowded the waiting room will move on to other facilities.</LD>
<TE>   For office manager Stella Gadsen, 53, the countless little things
that won't happen anymore bring memories.</TE>
<TE>   She's a little girl again, clutching a bag lunch and holding her
mother's hand during a daylong trip to see the doctor. In the 1950s,
she rode the trolley from Venice all the way to County-USC Medical
Center. To Gadsen, the county's closing of community health clinics
and concentrating of inpatient services at large hospitals is a big
step backward.</TE>
<TE>   "The county opened up all these centers to make them accessible to
the community, and now they're closing them down," Gadsen said
Friday. "It's like we're going back in time."</TE>
<TE>   The Alhambra Health Center, which opened as a hospital in 1929,
has been the only public health clinic in the city of 86,000. For
many, the two-story brick building has represented the sole source of
medical treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many people here who don't have insurance," said
Scarlett Yen, who last week took her 3-year-old daughter Ellen to the
clinic for a tuberculosis test.</TE>
<TE>   Until Friday, the clinic offered prenatal care, immunizations,
family medicine and family planning services. Last year, the Alhambra
clinic logged 11,560 patient visits.</TE>
<TE>   Alhambra is an immigrant city. Half of its population is
foreign-born, according to the 2000 census. The vast majority of
those immigrants are from Asia and Latin America. Most of the
clinic's patients fell below state poverty guidelines, according to
Yamel Bennett, 29, a clerk who worked as a patient financial
screener.</TE>
<TE>   "It's rare for us to have a patient that has to pay [for medical
services] because their income is too high," Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   "People living in the area rely on it very heavily," said Hugo
Almeida, the clinic administrator.</TE>
<TE>   That reliance was a source of pride for clinic employees like Aida
Lopez, a vocational nurse who worked at Alhambra for 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We have patients that have been coming here for 20 years," Lopez
said. "They have to be coming back for a reason."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said it wasn't just the free or low-cost medical care that
kept patients coming back, but the personal touch that she and her
colleagues brought to their work.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, who immunized as many as 75 children a day, brought a
grandmotherly mien to her work, chastising a patient for missing an
appointment one moment and inquiring about family the next.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't just treat our patients," Lopez said. "We care for them
and see them get well."</TE>
<TE>   As if to make the point, nurse Julie Iwuh told the story of
Frankie, a developmentally disabled patient in his late 20s who
wandered into the clinic four or five years ago. He was dirty and
disoriented, Iwuh said, and requested treatment for some unspecified
illness. As it turned out, Iwuh said, Frankie was so terrified of
needles that he wouldn't sit still for a necessary injection until
she held his hand.</TE>
<TE>   Frankie then started showing up every two or three months, Iwuh
said, usually disheveled and seeking treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "But he's not physically sick anymore," she said. "He just wants a
hug. I'll tell him, 'Go home and take a nice bath, then come back and
hug me,' and he does."</TE>
<TE>   Iwuh said the clinic was able to monitor Frankie's health and
avoid wasting money on unnecessary medical treatment because the
doctors and nurses knew him. The next time he comes by, there will be
no one there to hold his hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what will happen to Frankie now," Iwuh said.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic's many Mandarin-speaking patients may also wonder what
the future holds, since they can't be sure they will find nurses like
Theresa Wai to translate medical terms or diagnoses.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks now, signs announcing the closure have been posted on
the clinic doors. Yvonne DeLeon, a clerk who schedules patient
appointments, has reminded patients of the closure and handed out
listings of county health centers nearest them: the El Monte
Comprehensive Health Center, the Edward R. Roybal Comprehensive
Health Center in Los Angeles and, if the situation is dire,
County-USC Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Patients used to walking two or three blocks to the Alhambra
clinic will now have to drive--or walk-- as much as three miles to
reach the nearest county-operated health center.</TE>
<TE>   That will be the story across the county. After the current wave
of closures, which includes shutting clinics in North Hollywood and
Tujunga at the end of the month, the county will operate just seven
health centers that offer primary health-care services.</TE>
<TE>   DeLeon struggled for answers when patients asked why the clinic
was closing. There's no money, she told them. It's the budget. A
patient shook his head in disbelief or frustration, muttering as he
moved away from her window.</TE>
<TE>   The closing doesn't make sense to Booker Taylor, who worked as a
janitor at the Alhambra clinic for almost six years.</TE>
<TE>   "They just refurbished this whole place two years ago," he said.
"New floors, new light fixtures, paint--everything."</TE>
<TE>   County officials say that people will still be able to get the
medical care they need and that the Alhambra staff--six nurses, four
doctors, six clerical workers and a secretary--will be transferred to
other facilities, not laid off.</TE>
<TE>   But for Stella Gadsen, who was transferred "kicking and screaming"
to Alhambra from King-Drew Medical Center in 1995 and marvels at how
much she has learned since then, this latest transfer is small
comfort.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, there is no good news," she said. " ... We don't want to
go."</TE>

<HD>Strict New Limits on Coastal Fishing Adopted</HD>
<DH>Resources: The federal rules to protect dwindling Pacific
species will have far-reaching effects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>California seafood lovers who crave fresh Pacific sand dabs could
have trouble finding them in their local supermarket. Chinese
restaurants can expect shortages of live fish to display in their
window tanks.</LD>
<LD>   Recreational anglers face shorter seasons and lower limits on
catches. Commercial trawlers on the continental shelf will have to
make room for federal fishing observers who will be monitoring catch
limits.</LD>
<LD>   New federal rules adopted Friday and intended to protect
collapsing coastal fish populations will affect people with the most
tenuous association with the ocean--from landlocked diners to weekend
sportsmen.</LD>
<TE>   Adopted by the Pacific Fishery Management Council after a week of
excruciatingly detailed discussion, the rules will govern waters
extending from Seattle to San Diego. The U.S. Department of Commerce
must sign off on the rules before they take effect Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   During a public review period which begins now, fishermen are
expected to lobby for changes in the council's recommendations. A
listing of the proposed new regulations will posted on the council's
Web site, www.pcouncil.org, beginning next week.</TE>
<TE>   But whatever changes do result, most people involved in the debate
over fishery management expect a new era of dramatically curtailed
fishing that will have lasting effects on the economy and culture of
West Coast fishing.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the most restrictive regulations with the most
protective measures for the fish ever implemented by the Pacific
council," said Phil Kline, a former Eureka, Calif., fishing boat
captain who now works as a policy advisor for the conservation group
Oceana, based in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Kline's conclusions were generally shared by those attending the
fishery council's annual meeting here, although commercial fishermen
grumbled that the council went too far in setting quotas, while some
environmental groups warned that the new rules had too many proposed
exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   By acting now with relatively harsh measures, the council is
hoping to avoid the overfishing crisis faced in recent years by the
Atlantic cod and Gulf of Mexico red snapper industries.</TE>
<TE>   Similar management programs have proven effective with other
species, including the Pacific lingcod, mid-Atlantic summer flounder
and Chesapeake striped bass, each of which may soon be taken off the
federal "overfished" list.</TE>
<TE>   However, California's problems with rockfish are likely to last
much longer because of the long life spans and slow breeding habits
of the overfished species.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless something changes," said Rod Moore, executive director of
the Portland-based West Coast Seafood Processors' Assn., "we will
continue to have most of the continental shelf closed for years into
the future."</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take generations," echoed Kline. "We are literally
setting the table for people who have not been born yet."</TE>
<TE>   For the average Californian, "The main impact ... is that they are
going to find the California rockfish very scarce in stores and they
can expect a higher price," said L.B. Boydstun, who represented the
California Department of Fish and Game in the weeklong meetings here.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the rockfish, which are commonly sold in stores as
Pacific snapper, officials predicted greatly reduced harvests of
other bottom-dwelling varieties such as Petrale sole, English sole,
starry flounder, turbot and sand dabs that share the same undersea
territory as the rockfish.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be less and less fresh fish from the West Coast and
more and more fish from other sources," said Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Moore, who represents the West Coast's 15 biggest fish-processing
companies, said most of the replacement fish will come from Canada
and Alaska but will also include farm-raised African tilapia from the
Southeastern United States and Patagonian toothfish, commonly known
as Chilean sea bass, from the southern oceans.</TE>
<TE>   Uncertainty over the source of fish in stores is a concern to the
San Francisco-based Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Assns.</TE>
<TE>   "A consumer goes to the market and doesn't even know what species
they are buying or where they came from," said Natasha Benjamin, who
works for the trade organization's research institute, which is
pushing to have fish labeled by place of origin, species and method
of catch.</TE>
<TE>   Though consumers will have to adjust to new fish in stores, the
500-boat, federally regulated fishing fleet along the Pacific coast
will need to shrink by at least half.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the livelihood of an additional 1,500
state-licensed fishermen who ply the coast is also in serious peril,
as are the economies of such fishing-dependent communities as Fort
Bragg, Eureka and Crescent City in Northern California. Those towns
have already been hurt by the decline of the timber industry and loss
of revenue from declining salmon runs.</TE>
<TE>   After the federal regulations are set, state agencies are expected
to establish similar rules. California's rules may in some cases
exceed the federal standards.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, for example, the state Department of Fish and Game
unilaterally banned trawl fishing for prawns at certain depths to
protect the bocaccio, a popular rockfish species.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to manage a continental shelf rockfish population
approaching zero limits," Boydstun said. The main effect on fishing
will be to push boats beyond the 40-mile continental shelf to deeper
water, requiring bigger boats with substantial horsepower to pull the
nets, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The seriously depleted state of the bocaccio population was the
trigger for some of the more severe measures approved here this week,
including extremely limited access to the Southern California
continental shelf for commercial fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists applauded the establishment of protected fishing
zones where trawling at certain depths is banned to allow fish
populations, such as the dark-blotched rockfish found off the
northern coast, to rebuild.</TE>
<TE>   The overall impetus, set in motion in 1997 following conservation
amendments to the federal Magnuson-Stevens Act that governs the U.S.
fishing industry, is toward comprehensive, scientifically based
management of coastal waters at a time when the fishing industry has
made great technological strides in finding and catching fish.</TE>
<TE>   "With modern satellite technology, fish finders and global
positioning equipment, you can track and kill the last fish," Kline
said. "There is no place for fish to hide. It's like the era of the
buffalo."</TE>
<TE>   A remaining concern for environmentalists is the ability of the
federal government to monitor the new fishing limits and keep track
of the catch. The National Marine Fisheries Service currently employs
40 biologists under its 2-year-old West Coast groundfish observer
program.</TE>
<TE>   The observers are posted in 13 cities along the Pacific coast.
They are assigned to go out with fishing boats to weigh and count the
catch. In areas under severe quotas, observers are required.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Garrison, co-director of the Ocean Protection Initiative for
the Natural Resources Defense Council, doubts that the number of
observers is sufficient to keep track of 2,000 fishing craft.</TE>
<TE>   "In [the case of] bocaccio," Garrison said, "if there is going to
be any trawling, we are going to need 100% observer coverage."</TE>
<TE>   Under strict new quotas that restrict the catch of bocaccio to an
annual rate of 20 tons, no fishermen would directly target that
species. Observers are needed to determine how many bocaccio are
caught incidentally, known as "by-catch."</TE>
<TE>   The day may come, said Kline, when there will be an observer
aboard every fishing boat.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had quotas in the past but we haven't had accountability,
because no one was counting the by-catch," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Caught in the net of the general regulations is a California niche
industry that caters primarily to Asian American restaurants' demand
for live fish. With some fishing seasons reduced to six months or
less and limited by trip and catch restrictions, the restaurants will
lose access to much of the supply of the fresh ocean fish demanded by
their customers.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Wong, president of the Chinese Fishing Families of
California, said the Asian American fishing fleet, composed primarily
of ethnic Chinese and Vietnamese husband-and-wife crews, has plunged
from more than 200 boats in 1980 to only about 20 today.</TE>
<TE>   The new regulations, Wong said, "will put us all out of business."</TE>

<HD>Land-Use Plan OKd for Malibu</HD>
<DH>Conservation: The Coastal Commission decision sets limits
on development. It does not include a delay sought by
environmentalists on a Civic Center project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Racing to meet a legislative deadline, the California Coastal
Commission approved a compromise land-use plan Friday for Malibu that
generally pleased environmentalists but distressed many property
owners, who complained that they could be prevented from making even
simple improvements on their homes.</LD>
<LD>   The action protects a considerable amount of coastal sage and
chaparral from development, but excludes other areas from such
enhanced protection. Going against a staff recommendation, the state
commission declined to put a two-year hold on a more than
1-million-square-foot office, retail and housing proposal for the
Malibu Civic Center, which is now largely open space.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Massara of the Sierra Club said the commission's actions will
improve protection of Malibu's rugged coastal mountains. He said the
plan's public-access requirements should further a campaign to open
more paths to the beach, which is blocked for long stretches by
multimillion-dollar homes.</LD>
<TE>   But Massara also complained that, by failing to put the brakes on
the Civic Center proposal, "the commission struck a blow for
incoherent planning."</TE>
<TE>   Malibu city officials were not nearly as satisfied with the plan,
which was approved on a 10-1 vote after seven hours of debate. They
declined to rule out the possibility of litigation to overturn the
plan, citing numerous flaws and building restrictions they said are
far too onerous.</TE>
<TE>   "The plan has several shortcomings," said Mayor Jeff Jennings.
"What happens next is an open question."</TE>
<TE>   Other city officials defended the commission's decision not to
slap a two-year moratorium on the Civic Center plan; they said the
proposal will face ample scrutiny to ensure that it is of the proper
scale.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Nichols, Gov. Gray Davis' secretary of resources, called the
Local Coastal Program "a good result," adding, "We resolved most of
the issues in a way that was acceptable to the city as well as" the
state.</TE>
<TE>   Drafting of the plan was thrust into the hands of the state agency
after the city failed for years to create a local coastal plan
acceptable to the state. Without such a plan in place, every minor
planning decision--from deck expansions to bathroom remodels--had to
be approved by the Coastal Commission, which oversees the state's
1,100-mile shoreline.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, politicians in Sacramento, who appoint the 12
voting commissioners, grew weary of being relentlessly lobbied by
wealthy residents over their home improvement projects. The
Legislature ordered the Coastal Commission to draft and adopt a
program for the city by Sept. 15, this Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   After two years of work, two days of contentious hearings and
nearly 12 hours of public testimony that at times turned ugly, the
commission met that deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Planning decisions in the city will now revert to local officials.
Their decisions along more than 20 miles of coastline must comply
with the new coastal plan.</TE>
<TE>   The most contentious issue on the table in the prolonged
discussions was a proposal by the commission's staff to designate
nearly half the city as "environmentally sensitive habitat areas."</TE>
<TE>   Building will be sharply limited on those properties. Construction
in the designated areas will be limited to 10,000 square feet, or 25%
of the parcel, whichever is smaller.</TE>
<TE>   But, as part of the compromise that helped win approval, the
commission agreed to exclude most lots on Point Dume from such
restrictions. The compromise language also states that, throughout
the city, property owners can allow their grading to exceed the
restrictions if there is no other economically feasible method that
will allow them to build.</TE>
<TE>   Other proposals during the debate would have diluted those
restrictions even further.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maps Criticized</TE>
<TE>   Coastal Commissioner Cynthia McClain-Hill cast the lone vote
against the sensitive-habitat proposal. She said the plan unfairly
burdens private property owners. If their property is mistakenly
included in the inexact maps of sensitive habitat zones, they will
have to spend considerable sums to prove there is no coastal sage or
chaparral on their land, or be saddled with the restrictions,
McClain-Hill argued.</TE>
<TE>   Several commissioners shared the concern that the maps of the
habitat areas are not precise enough, placing an unfair burden on
property owners.</TE>
<TE>   Nichols proposed turning to maps drawn in 1986. That option would
have included habitat in the mountains, while reducing the protected
zones closer to the ocean. The proposal failed by one vote.</TE>
<TE>   With Nichols' proposal off the table, some worried that the
commission would not be able to muster the seven votes needed to pass
the entire coastal plan. That led to the discussion of Point Dume.
The distinctive outcropping forms the northwest end of Santa Monica
Bay and is a largely residential zone.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Point Dume Exempted</TE>
<TE>   The motion to exclude Point Dume from the heightened protections
was approved with the bare six votes needed to amend the plan. Less
construction will be permitted, however in two canyons and along
creeks that cross Point Dume.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Pedro Nava said he thought placing much of Point Dume
outside the heightened protection zone was a lost opportunity for the
city to restore habitat. He still voted for the overall plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not entirely happy with what's in here," Nava said. "There
are parts I disagree with, parts I think are inadequate. That doesn't
mean I'm going to take the investment that the community has made,
and that this staff and commission has made and, at the last minute,
tank the whole deal."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Development Approved</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists said they are most concerned about the
commission's failure to embrace the staff recommendation to put a
hold on Civic Center development.</TE>
<TE>   That move means that the principal landowner in the area--Malibu
Bay Co., a holding company controlled by billionaire A. Jerrold
Perenchio--can move ahead with its plans for a large commercial and
residential development.</TE>
<TE>   Perenchio has given more than $900,000 to Gov. Gray Davis and
lives not far from the Civic Center in the exclusive Malibu Colony.
His representatives have said in the past that Perenchio expects no
special treatment because of his donations to Davis, who appoints
four of the Coastal Commission's 12 members.</TE>
<TE>   An environmental impact report for the Civic Center project was
released just this week. Under the proposal, Perenchio's firm and
other developers would be able to build a 146-room hotel,
restaurants, shops, offices and a storage facility. The proposal
calls for open space, a public plaza and day-care centers.</TE>
<TE>   Coastal Commission staff members said they wanted two more years
to set a planning template for the critical property, one of the few
expansive, flat areas in Malibu that remains undeveloped. The land is
squeezed between the Malibu Colony, the Cross Creek shopping center
and the Malibu courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   But the commission rejected the two-year delay and city officials
gave assurances that citizens will still have ample opportunity to
comment on the proposal. The environmental report for the project
will be the subject of several workshops in coming months, before
city officials vote it up or down. Even then, the plan would go
before local voters, probably in June or November of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Patrick Kruer said the city, which has negotiated a
development agreement with the developer, would lose out on amenities
such as nearly 17 acres of open space, sports fields and a senior
citizens/teen center if the project were put on hold.</TE>
<TE>   "It [adds] up to a huge amount of money and land and things that
can be utilized by the city," he said. "To stop the planning process
at this point during a two-year moratorium doesn't make sense to me."</TE>
<TE>   Kruer proposed that any developments in the city with "visitor
serving" components, or with development agreements, not be subject
to a moratorium. The commission agreed by a 10-2 vote.</TE>
<TE>   Malibu resident Ozzie Silna said he was generally pleased with the
restrictions. But he was concerned that some of the compromises will
mean the city won't measure the cumulative impacts of development.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also made a number of less controversial changes,
including increasing the allowable number of horses per acre from
three to four, and forbidding discrimination in public access to the
shoreline. The plan recommends public paths to the beach every 1,000
feet, a goal that even proponents acknowledged will be tough to meet
on the long stretches of beach that are walled off from the public by
large homes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Public Beach Access</TE>
<TE>   Massara said the Sierra Club will use the new provisions to try to
obtain public access to every beach in Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   Nava, who proposed the "environmental justice" measure, said he
hopes it sets a precedent for other communities along the coast,
ensuring that visitors aren't excluded because of their income or
race.</TE>
<TE>   The vitriol that flowed during Thursday's meetings, when the
commission and its staff were compared to Nazis, was largely absent
Friday, as were most members of the public.</TE>

<LD>When the strangers come to visit the old sergeant, they offer
keepsakes from more than half a century ago: Faded black-and-white
photos of themselves in uniform, yellowed newspaper clippings and
dog-eared cartoons of GIs Willie and Joe. They recount a war story or
two. They say how much they appreciate what he did for them.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes the sergeant answers with a smile or a flash of
recognition. Other times not. When they leave his room at a Newport
Beach nursing home, some of them cry.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Mauldin is one of the most famous veterans of World War II,
although he never led troops, never took a hill and never flew a
mission. He drew cartoons--darkly humorous takes on life as seen from
a muddy foxhole.</LD>
<TE>   His sketches told of fear and fatigue, death and a desire to
finish the job and go home. They earned him a Pulitzer Prize and the
admiration of millions of soldiers who saw their struggles in his
characters.</TE>
<TE>   Now, at 80 and battling Alzheimer's disease and other ailments, he
is being honored again by a parade of men he has never met--veterans
making a pilgrimage to his bedside to say thanks for helping them.</TE>
<TE>   There's the man with the multiple heart bypass who remembers how
Mauldin's cartoons offered respite to men building a bridge under
enemy fire. A retired salesman recounts seeing, from atop a utility
pole in Anzio, Italy, Mauldin driving by in a Jeep. A Navy vet says
Mauldin helped inspire him to become a cartoonist after the war.</TE>
<TE>   "This is payback," said Jay Gruenfeld, a 77-year-old Lompoc vet
who, with help from two newspaper columnists, started the movement
that has drawn a steady stream of aging visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Gruenfeld served in the Pacific. While recovering in an Army
hospital from wounds that nearly severed his spine, his father sent
him Mauldin's best-selling book, "Up Front," which combined the New
Mexico native's cartoons with a narrative about life in the trenches.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't get over his common sense and the way he captured the
life of the infantry guys in his prose," Gruenfeld said. "He made fun
of things that really aren't that funny."</TE>
<TE>   Mauldin--who would go on to further fame as an author and
editorial cartoonist, winning a second Pulitzer in 1959 while at the
St. Louis Post-Dispatch--was an Army sergeant who drew from the front
lines in Europe for the military newspaper Stars &amp; Stripes. He
immortalized the combat soldier in his characters Willie and Joe, two
ordinary "dogfaces" who battled both the enemy and know-nothing
officers who were safely sequestered from the action.</TE>
<TE>   When, under heavy fire, one of Mauldin's soldiers tells another,
"I feel like a fugitive from th' law of averages," Gruenfeld
understood. He grew up in Illinois as an avid outdoorsman, and joined
the Army at the age of 18.</TE>
<TE>   "People thought I was crazy to want to go into the infantry," he
said. "I wanted to see the jungles."</TE>
<TE>   He did. In his first month of combat, 600 of the 4,000 men in his
division were killed and hundreds of others were wounded. In 20
months of fighting, Gruenfeld was wounded four times.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he became a forester, and in retirement wrote and
self-published an autobiography.</TE>
<TE>   "Mauldin was 22 when he wrote his first book," Gruenfeld said.
"When I finally wrote a book in '97, I wanted to send it to Mauldin."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he tracked down Mauldin's son in New Mexico, one of
eight children from three marriages. The request came as no surprise
to David Mauldin. For years, the son has averaged a call a month from
vets trying to locate his father, the legend.</TE>
<TE>   "For decades, my dad was not wanting to hear all that," he said of
his father's reaction to accolades of his wartime work. "His feeling
was, 'That was then, this is now.' He knew it was the basis of his
fame. But he was also smart enough to know that he was in the right
place at the right time."</TE>
<TE>   The veterans shake loose in Mauldin deeply buried memories from
the closet of his mind, making him more lucid more often.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't you remember being 22?" David Mauldin said. "He seems to be
temporarily brought back by all these vets."</TE>
<TE>   When Gruenfeld was told of Mauldin's fading health, including
complications from burns suffered in a household accident a few years
ago, he drove 200 miles to see him. He showed Mauldin some of his old
cartoons, but got no response. Then he pinned a replica combat
infantry badge on Mauldin's pajamas.</TE>
<TE>   "He had the biggest, most beautiful smile on his face," Gruenfeld
said. "It made my day. I hope it made his day."</TE>
<TE>   Gruenfeld crafted a letter in May that he mailed to veterans'
groups. "Hopefully," it read, "there are ... people left feeling as I
do, that Bill Mauldin did enough to lighten the grim burden of WWII
for those in service and at home, that he deserves some special
treatment during his final years."</TE>
<TE>   In July, Orange County Register columnist Gordon Dillow made a
similar appeal. That led nationally syndicated columnist Bob Greene,
a former colleague of Mauldin's when both worked at the Chicago
Sun-Times in the 1970s, to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, dozens of veterans began showing up at the nursing home.
Two months later, they're still coming nearly every day.</TE>
<TE>   "These 60-year-old emotions are just pouring out," administrator
Diana Schilling said. "One man said--walking down the hallway, tears
streaming down his face--'I'm not supposed to do this. I'm a man.'
Some guys stand in the lobby and cry. They have a connection to him
that's extraordinary--a connection that I didn't anticipate."</TE>
<TE>   When Bill Thomas, 78, came with two buddies from the Seal Beach
VFW post wearing identical American flag ties, he told Mauldin about
seeing him that day at Anzio.</TE>
<TE>   "His eyes lit up," Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   One of his favorite Mauldin cartoons depicts two soldiers in a
foxhole, rain hitting their steel helmets. "Now that ya mention it,
it does sound like th' patter of rain on a tin roof," one says.</TE>
<TE>   "The discomfort was constant," said Thomas, who survived 565 days
of combat in Europe. "Combat is a time when men get closer than
brothers, closer than family because you have to rely on each other
so much. We relied on Mauldin to break the tension for a moment, just
a moment. He meant an awful lot to a lot of us."</TE>
<TE>   Thousands more strangers have reached out through cards, letters
and e-mails. A Florida man wrote to say how much his late father
thought of him, and included photos of his dad in boot camp. Twins
who fought in the war each sent a $500 check.</TE>
<TE>   You don't know me but I've known you for almost 60 years, and my
life has been better for It ...</TE>
<TE>   Hey, Bill, you kept me going during WWII ...</TE>
<TE>   Your cartoons in the Stars &amp; Stripes gave us about our only
moments of pleasure...</TE>
<TE>   These notes and others are tacked to a bulletin board in Mauldin's
room, sharing space with black-and-white photos of New Mexico, his
children, Army jeep, dog and cats.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have been over here three or four weeks ago, but my wife
had heart surgery," Roland Landrigan said as he sat next to the bed
where Mauldin rested with eyes closed.</TE>
<TE>   The 78-year-old Huntington Beach man held in his lap a book
chronicling what his unit, the 1263rd Engineer Combat Battalion, did
during the war.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought maybe there was something in this he'd like to see."</TE>
<TE>   He told Mauldin how rough the seas were on the way from England to
France, how Le Havre looked as if a mile-wide tornado had ripped
through it, and how his cartoons would get talked about by weary
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that I could think of that he might want to hear."</TE>
<TE>   Landrigan walked to the bed and put his hand on Mauldin's
shoulder. "Bill, are you on board?"</TE>
<TE>   He waited a minute, turned and left, not knowing if his visit had
done anything. But he was certain Mauldin had done something for him
long ago--and that he would have to come back and try again.</TE>

<HD>A Kite Takes His Camera to New Perspectives</HD>
<DH>By combining the two devices, Cris Benton's aerial
photography creates striking images. The hobby is growing, thanks to
the Internet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever since cameras became popular in the late 19th century,
photographers have been fastening them to dogs, horses, birds, bikes,
skydivers, model rockets, trains, planes and automobiles--always in
search of an original angle or attention-grabbing shot.</LD>
<LD>   A few years ago, a network television crew even tried attaching a
tiny camera to the head of a brown tree snake, a rapacious reptile
that was single-handedly wiping out the bird population of Guam.</LD>
<LD>   Much closer to home, Cris Benton of Berkeley practices kite aerial
photography. As the name of his hobby implies, Benton gets his
thrills--and plenty of striking photos--by dangling his camera from
kites.</LD>
<TE>   The unusual hobby is both a sport and an art, with only a few
hundred practitioners around the world. Benton is a relative
newcomer, but his kite photography Web site has become a sort of
clearinghouse for anything having to do with kites and cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Benton is willing to attach a pricey piece of equipment to
something that could come crashing down to earth at any moment to
achieve a unique perspective on commonplace subjects.</TE>
<TE>   His photos of natural and urban landscapes offer a striking
contrast to images taken from terrestrial vantage points along roads
or hiking trails. His work is also quite different from pictures shot
from planes or helicopters, which fly at much higher elevations. A
kite, in Benton's view, flies just high enough off the ground to
offer a fresh view of the familiar.</TE>
<TE>   He makes his point with an overhead image of surprisingly
disorderly rows of a San Mateo pumpkin patch, with the pleasing
symmetry of three giant oil tanks in Point Richmond taken from
directly above and with a sweeping view of Limantour Beach at Point
Reyes National Seashore, taken at sunset.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the really productive stuff I shoot is below 250 feet,"
Benton said. "It's not that high off the ground, but it's in the
space that we obviously can't occupy. Unlike putting a camera on a
radio-controlled plane that's flying around, the kite kind of hovers
and I can walk it right up to, say, a building."</TE>
<TE>   Benton started in 1995, kiting his camera over rural scenes. He
favored sparsely populated areas, he said, because "you don't have to
worry about dropping a camera on someone's head."</TE>
<TE>   In time, his curiosity about urban subjects overcame his
misgivings and he began documenting the geography of cities and
buildings from the air.</TE>
<TE>   He found that he could easily spend a day at Oakland's port, for
example, composing shots of railroad tracks curving past storage
containers.</TE>
<TE>   He even took his kite and camera rig to Europe on a recent trip
and took overhead shots of small French villages and vineyards. At
the Burning Man festival in Nevada last year, he lofted his camera
above people riding their bikes, and got a series of candid and
unusual shots of people grinning and waving upward.</TE>
<TE>   Benton's preoccupation with unusual angles grows out of
professional interests. He is the chairman of UC Berkeley's
architecture department. Even though he calls himself an amateur
photographer, Benton has sold a few images to publishers who have
come across his expansive online portfolio at
www.arch.ced.Berkeley.edu/kap.</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of kite photography is closely tied to the
Internet. Because there are no kite photo kits in stores, the Web
allows enthusiasts from all over the globe to share photos and tips
on how to use the wind to lift a camera skyward.</TE>
<TE>   Benton's camera is mounted on a homemade "cradle" built from a
variety of materials, including the hard drive of a computer. After
the kite is safely airborne, a pulley system lifts the cradle up the
kite string. A remote-control handset is used to rotate the camera in
various directions and trigger the shutter.</TE>
<TE>   Many kite photographers actually mount two airborne cameras. They
attach a video camera to a still camera, allowing them to preview
what they are shooting.</TE>
<TE>   That's not Benton's style. He said he does a lot of "pondering."
Part of the thrill for him is waiting to see what images his camera
has captured at the end of the day. "It's like fishing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, fishing poles don't have a nasty habit of getting
caught in trees or suddenly plummeting toward San Francisco Bay when
the breezes die. It's no big deal when it happens to a cheap paper
kite, but rather a painful setback when a $500 digital camera is
along for the ride.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been doing this since 1995 and haven't lost a camera yet,"
Benton said. "I'm due."</TE>

<HD>Simon Attempts to Gain Initiative</HD>
<DH>Politics: GOP candidate releases 2001 tax returns, airs new
TV ad featuring Bush and Giuliani and hunts for contributions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after a judge overturned a fraud verdict that had hamstrung his
campaign for governor, Republican Bill Simon Jr. tried to put his
effort back on track by appealing to Republican donors for help and
trying to close down a separate controversy about his tax returns.</LD>
<LD>   Simon also began airing a new television ad, featuring
testimonials from two key supporters: President Bush and former New
York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</LD>
<LD>   The White House approved the use of Bush's image in the ad after
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James Chalfant's reversal Thursday
of the $78-million verdict against William E. Simon &amp; Sons, according
to a GOP strategist who has discussed the governor's race with the
White House. That approval came despite irritation among Bush's
political advisors over Simon's premature announcement Tuesday that
the president would appear in the ad, the strategist said.</LD>
<TE>   Simon advisors hope the spot will repair some of the damage
inflicted by a barrage of ads by Gov. Gray Davis that have pounded
the GOP candidate for the fraud case and other business troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis' lies and distortions create doubt in people's minds,"
said a Simon strategist, Sal Russo. "So it's important for voters to
see that the two most popular Americans today--President Bush and
Rudy Giuliani--are proudly supporting Bill Simon."</TE>
<TE>   But the Democratic incumbent made it clear that he plans, if
anything, to step up his efforts to persuade voters that Simon is
unfit to govern California.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Simon may have dodged one bullet, but he has a few more
coming his direction," Davis said at a San Diego campaign stop.</TE>
<TE>   Given the Simon campaign's severe money problems, it was unclear
how long he can continue to broadcast the new ad. The campaign was
able to purchase only enough air time to keep the spot on TV through
the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Simon and his fund-raisers were scrambling to raise
money to extend the ad purchase into next week. Simon strategists
were counting on the candidate to pour several million of his own
dollars to keep his commercials running. Simon has promised to donate
money, but has refused to say when or how much.</TE>
<TE>   The reversal of the fraud verdict gave the GOP candidate an
opening to counter the negative image painted by the governor
throughout the summer. Yet Simon made no public appearances Friday;
instead, he worked the phone, soliciting campaign donations and
making the rounds of conservative radio talk shows.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to congratulate you on winning this lawsuit," host Inga
Barks told him on KERN-AM (1410) in Bakersfield. "It was a ridiculous
one."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Simon sought to shift the campaign's agenda toward the
economy and other issues to his liking, even as he renewed his call
for Davis to stop running his TV ad about the fraud case.</TE>
<TE>   "The people of California know that personal attacks don't create
jobs, personal attacks don't lower taxes and personal attacks don't
repair our schools and they don't fix our quality of life," Simon
said on one of the morning radio shows.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has used the conservative radio circuit to tend to his
political base in the absence of money to match the governor's
statewide television ads.</TE>
<TE>   While reassuring to core supporters, his appearances on the shows
also have constrained his ability to shift toward the political
center in a state dominated by Democrats and independents.</TE>
<TE>   The difficulties in simultaneously pleasing both camps were
evident Friday.</TE>
<TE>   On the Bakersfield show, Simon spoke out against a bill--popular
among some leading Latino political activists--that would give farm
workers the right to binding arbitration in talks with growers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we have to pick on our farmers, Inga," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Prompted by the host, Simon went on to criticize Davis for signing
a bill that will force auto manufacturers to reduce tailpipe
emissions to combat global warming. Davis has showcased the measure
in TV ads aimed at appealing to the moderates and independents whose
support is critical to Simon and the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "That bill is a big nothing," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at a campaign stop in San Diego, Davis joined several
dozen environmentalists on a bank of the weed-choked San Diego River,
where he signed a bill to create a conservancy to manage land along
the waterway. He also pledged $12 million in state bond money to
restore the river.</TE>
<TE>   "We're turning the tide on years of river neglect," he said. Davis
also spoke to delegates at the AARP national convention--as Simon had
Thursday--before signing bills benefiting seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's attempt to talk about issues other than his business
background has been stymied for several months amid a series of
distractions, including his refusal for months to release his tax
returns. On Friday, he moved to put that, like the verdict, behind
him.</TE>
<TE>   After obtaining extensions for filing his 2001 tax returns, he
allowed reporters to review them for the first time Friday. He
reported $2.5 million in income and paid $513,004 in federal taxes
and $66,135 in California taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's income included wages of $634,817 from William E. Simon &amp;
Sons, $1.2 million in interest on investments and $503,692 in
dividends. His net capital gains were just over $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   When Simon released an earlier batch of tax records in July, the
state returns for 1995 were missing. Russo, his campaign strategist,
said the candidate's only remaining copy had apparently been lost in
transit between William E. Simon &amp; Sons and a storage facility.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know if it got mixed in with somebody else's boxes, or
it fell off a truck, or what," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The state, in the regular course of business, has destroyed its
copy of Simon's 1995 returns, he said. At any rate, "there was
nothing of any consequence" in the tax returns, he said.</TE>

<HD>Fair Boasts Heart-Stopping Draw</HD>
<DH>Food: Visitors are both repelled and strangely attracted by
deep-fried Snickers bars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some fairgoers call cotton candy, corndogs and beer a balanced meal.
But this year, there's a new high, or low, in fair food with the
debut Friday of a battered, deep-fried Snickers bar topped with
powdered sugar. Needless to say, it's served on a stick.</LD>
<LD>   Some might be repelled--nutritionists and cardiologists, for
example--but not 25-year-old Shelley Brough, who made a pilgrimage to
the Los Angeles County Fair's opening day in Pomona.</LD>
<LD>   "I was curious more than anything," she said. "I saw the sign, and
I just couldn't imagine what a deep-fried Snickers bar tasted like."
The Riverside resident and her friend, Denise Serna, 25, paid $3 each
and in turn they got a regular-sized Snickers bar that had been
dipped in sweet batter and fried for less than a minute in soybean
oil heated to about 375 degrees.</LD>
<TE>   "Who thought of this?" asked Serna, as she waited for the Mother
of All Junk Food to cool down.</TE>
<TE>   Frying candy bars started more than a decade ago in a chip shop in
Scotland, according to the Herald of Glasgow, and, in the United
Kingdom, the confection of choice is the Mars bar.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had 4,000 people ask me where to get them," said Tammy
Lawler, who was working at the information booth.</TE>
<TE>   For the next two weeks, she will be directing the venturesome to
the two Texas Donuts booths serving the fried bars.</TE>
<TE>   One is near the Blue Gate, a block away from the Healthy
Lifestyles building, and the other is located near the Yellow Gate.</TE>
<TE>   Pressed to describe the unusual item, people used terms like
"gooey" and "too hot" and "really, really sweet."</TE>
<TE>   One taster preferred the term "rich."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure what to think of it," said Brough, a couple of bites
in. "It tastes good, but it doesn't seem quite right."</TE>
<TE>   Westwood resident Vicky Ross walked up to the counter with a fair
food crib sheet, and the first underlined phrase was "deep-fried
Snickers bar."</TE>
<TE>   Confessing to a thing for frozen Snickers bars and possession of a
recipe for Snickers pie, Ross, 42, was delighted with the new
variation on a favorite food.</TE>
<TE>   "It's delicious," she said. "It's not greasy ... it's very sweet
... and it doesn't taste like a corndog at all."</TE>
<TE>   Texas Donuts owners Teresa Brander and her husband, Rich, said
they first sold fried Snickers at this year's Orange County Fair.
They still sell more of their trademark Texas-sized doughnuts, but
the fried Snickers draws the curious in droves, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She estimated they grossed about $3,000 on each weekend day during
the Orange County Fair, which is 15% to 20% more sales than in the
pre-Snickers era.</TE>
<TE>   As to the recent history of this weird foodstuff, Brander said she
heard that the bars were wildly popular when introduced at last
year's Minnesota State Fair, "and I hear they do them in Australia as
well."</TE>
<TE>   Teresa Brander couldn't put her finger on the exact number of
calories a fried Snickers has, but the bar has 280 calories, 130 of
them from fat.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't think the hot oil added more than 50 calories. And the
batter is made with sugar and flour but no fat, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Personally, Brander said, she doesn't eat fried foods. She likes
salads.</TE>
<TE>   But Shelley Brough clearly thought the new fair food was a winner.
After a couple more bites, a big grin appeared on her face.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, she said, "this would be really good with ice cream."</TE>

<HD>Drownings Raise Hazing Questions</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Police see no sign of crime in two deaths. But
others fear the beach tragedy resulted from pledging ritual at black
sorority.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDY BANKS and JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The late-night drownings of two college students this week in rough
surf at Dockweiler State Beach appear to have been accidental, police
said Friday, but African American sorority and fraternity members are
agonizing over the possibility that the women died inadvertently
during a hazing ritual for a venerated black sorority.</LD>
<LD>   Kenitha Saafir, 24, of Compton and Kristin High, 22, both seniors
at Cal State L.A., drowned in heavy surf late Monday night. They were
at the beach with five other college women--three of them reportedly
members of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, and the other two, like
High and Saafir, pledges aspiring to join.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Friday that they had no evidence of criminal
wrongdoing and had believed survivors' accounts that they were at the
beach to exercise. There were no signs that the deaths were related
to the use of alcohol, coercion, reckless endangerment or other
criminal acts, said a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman, Sgt.
John Pasquariello.</LD>
<TE>   Hazing is a misdemeanor defined under state law as any act "that
causes or is likely to cause bodily danger, physical harm or personal
degradation or disgrace resulting in physical or mental harm" to
anyone involved in an initiation rite for a student organization.</TE>
<TE>   Several veterans of black fraternities and sororities don't
believe that the women--college students juggling jobs and
families--were exercising late at night on a beach. Forced
calisthenics are a common ritual, they said, and sending pledges
blindfolded into the ocean is a staple of West Coast pledge routines.</TE>
<TE>   The group that the two drowning victims were reported to be
pledging is the nation's oldest black sorority, with a long list of
famous members, including Toni Morrison, Marian Anderson, Maya
Angelou and Rosa Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Alpha Kappa Alpha has 900 chapters nationwide, though there are
none affiliated with Cal State L.A., where Saafir was a studio art
major and High, the mother of a 2-year-old boy, was a business major.</TE>
<TE>   A member of High's family said they had been pledging through an
underground chapter.</TE>
<TE>   Betty N. James, executive director of the Chicago-based sorority,
declined to comment beyond a prepared statement: "The sorority
expresses its condolences to the families and will cooperate with
authorities in their investigation."</TE>
<TE>   For years, the sorority, like the rest of the nine black Greek
organizations, has expressly forbidden hazing in any form, including
"paddling, creative or excessive fatigue, physical or psychological
shock or morally degrading or humiliating activities."</TE>
<TE>   At a candlelight vigil Thursday for the two women, Lawrence Ross
Jr., whose book, "The Divine Nine," is considered the definitive
volume on black Greek life, urged more than 100 people to use the
deaths as a call to end hazing. "Without a revolution in our ranks,
Kenitha and Kristin have died in vain ... while trying to be one of
us, an African American fraternal member," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pledges don't have to be bound or forced into the water or up a
tree, said Ross, who pledged Alpha Phi Alpha at UC Berkeley and
travels the country speaking about the menace of hazing. "Young men
and women go willingly to whatever ends they're told to go because
they want to be part of something, because that's how much it means."</TE>
<TE>   Ross said wade-into-the-ocean rituals typically require
blindfolded pledges to make their way through the waves to a leader,
who stands in the water urging them on. It is explained as a way to
show trust.</TE>
<TE>   "The young people are quick to say, 'It's not hazing; it's
pledging,' " he said. "But at what point does it become hazing--when
the blindfolds go on, when the water reaches their knees, when the
waves knock them under and they can't breathe? Or when they drown and
the policeman pulls them out?"</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Capt. Ken Hillman, who was at Dockweiler on Monday night,
said survivors told police they had gone to the beach to run and to
perform calisthenics. Police first spotted them about 10 p.m.,
running in orderly lines across the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the beach was closed, police said they did not
question the women because they seemed to be engaged in an organized
exercise.</TE>
<TE>   The waves were as high as 10 feet, and the riptide was strong
enough to drag swimmers 300 yards out to sea. Witnesses told police
one of the women appeared to have been knocked down by a swell, then
pulled under. The other apparently tried to save her, and both were
swept away.</TE>
<TE>   High's family said she was a strong swimmer. Saafir's family could
not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Dispatchers received a 911 emergency call at 11:22 p.m., reporting
a loud commotion, possibly a party, at the beach, which is west of
Los Angeles International Airport. A minute later a second call
reported a woman screaming for help.</TE>
<TE>   When police arrived three minutes later, they could see two bodies
being tossed in the surf about 50 yards from the beach. Without
pausing to remove their shoes, guns or 35-pound utility belts, LAPD
Officers Robert Espinoza and Charles Rodriguez plunged into the surf,
pulled the women out and tried to revive them.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they don't know why the women entered the
water. Both were wearing sweatpants, suggesting they had not intended
to swim.</TE>
<TE>   At a memorial Friday night in Compton for High, relatives
assembled before the service to express anger. In the days before she
died, High had told her family of unpleasant pledging incidents she
had experienced, said their attorney, Mansfield Collins. Relatives
said they are particularly angry that police saw the group on the
beach after public hours and did not tell the women to leave. And the
police conclusion that sorority rituals weren't involved is baffling,
said High's mother, Patricia Fargas.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot understand anyone coming to facts about the truth by
hearing only half a story," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Grief took over during the memorial as home videos showed Kristin
in high school cap and gown, then happily pregnant, and later alight
with joy beside her fiance, Holman Arthurs, and their baby.</TE>
<TE>   "She was the personification of beauty, of elegance, of
intelligence," Arthurs said. "She was the love of my life."</TE>
<TE>   More than 40 states have outlawed hazing. Large financial
settlements have caught the attention of Greek organizations and
their college sponsors, leading many universities to ban the groups
outright. More than 80 pledges have died in pledge activities in the
last 12 years during rites that involved binge drinking, beatings and
extreme physical exertion.</TE>
<TE>   Hazing is difficult to eradicate, in part because of a code of
silence among pledges and an ethos that makes surviving the rigors of
pledging a badge of honor among black fraternities and sororities.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to go through what your brothers and sisters have gone
through. That's the bond," said one young woman, who pledged Alpha
Kappa Alpha eight years ago and later helped supervise her chapter's
underground pledge program.</TE>
<TE>   At Thursday's beachside memorial, exhortations to end hazing drew
a smattering of polite applause from the gathering of fraternity and
sorority members. Afterward they gathered in groups and spoke of
their desire to pay their respects to the families but their
unwillingness to share the blame.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever happened, it's not our business," one fraternity member
said. "We're not here to place blame. We're a private organization.
We have our secret rituals; they have theirs. This is not about the
end of pledging."</TE>
<TE>   Ross said that idea threatens the lifeblood of black fraternal
groups, long considered the incubators for black American leadership.
Each of the nine groups boasts an impressive membership roster that
spans the spectrum from entertainment to academia and politics, from
Bill Cosby to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Aretha Franklin to
W.E.B. Du Bois and Arthur Ashe.</TE>
<TE>   The organizations promote academic achievement and donate millions
to scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   But the increasing toll of deaths and injuries among the nine
sororities and fraternities has led their national leadership to
agree that survival is in question without reform.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what's ridiculous?" Ross said. "We invest all this time
and money to get these precious people to go to college, then we kill
them. You can have fraternal clubs; you can have secret rituals. But
you can't kill people. It's as simple as that."</TE>

<HD>Bosnia Investigating a Defense Firm Accused of Supplying
Iraq</HD>
<DH>Balkans: The inquiry was triggered by a U.S. claim that the
aircraft parts maker violated a U.N. mandate. Company denies the
charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina</DL>
<LD>Bosnian officials expect in the coming days to complete an
investigation into U.S. allegations that a profitable Bosnian Serb
defense manufacturer is supplying the Iraqi military with technical
expertise and parts.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials would say only that they believe the company, which
they did not name publicly, is violating the United Nations arms
embargo on Iraq and that the U.S. Embassy here asked the Bosnian
government to look into the charges.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation, which opened last week, is being conducted by
the government of Republika Srpska, the Serbian majority entity that
constitutes half of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The company is located in the
Serbian area; the other half of the country is run jointly by Muslims
and ethnic Croats.</LD>
<TE>   If the allegations are true, "this is in violation of United
Nations resolutions, and that's a very serious concern," Bosnian
Deputy Foreign Minister Ivica Misic said.</TE>
<TE>   Bosnian officials identified the company as Orao Air Force Co.,
based in the town of Bijeljina near the border with Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   The company has denied the allegations. "In its long tradition,
the factory has never produced either weapons or arms," director
Milan Prica said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials did not respond to the accusation that its
engineers were working in Iraq, and refused requests for interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Military analysts, Bosnian government officials and others note
that the company was once part of the Yugoslav armed forces, which
had a long relationship with Iraq. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
government was one of the Yugoslav military's biggest trading
partners outside Europe into the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The historical links between Iraq and Yugoslavia are a reminder of
the many connections that Hussein can use to bolster his military.</TE>
<TE>   "It is certainly true that the Yugoslav army had great relations
with Iraq," said Bratislav Grubacic, a political analyst in Belgrade,
the Yugoslav capital. "They were always sending their engineers there
to work on their planes and to build military objects and airports.
Iraq needed weapons, and Yugoslavia needed oil. And both countries
use a lot of Russian military equipment."</TE>
<TE>   Orao Air Force Co. manufactures parts for airplanes, both civilian
and military, and has extensive expertise in overhauling both
Russian-and Western-made jet engines. Bosnian government officials
say privately that they believe the alleged breach of the U.N.
sanctions involved work on Russian MIG-21 fighter jets, which are
thought to be part of Iraq's arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   Several local media reports say the company sold its products to
other firms, both domestically and abroad, that in turn may have sold
them to Iraq. Company officials told local news organizations that it
does not know whether its business partners could have sold its goods
to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   That possibility, however, raised questions about whether the
company filed required paperwork on its sales--an issue the
international peacekeeping force in Bosnia has asked the
investigators to examine.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers of military products in Bosnia are designated
Government Ordnance Factories, or GOFs, and operate under an
agreement with the peacekeeping force. Before a company can ship such
products to a customer, the deal is reviewed by the international
force, which determines the end-user of the items. The international
force then issues permission for the export.</TE>
<TE>   "Orao appears not to have been operating under a GOF agreement
even though they may have produced equipment that is
military-related," said Lt. Cmdr. Yves Vanier, a Canadian spokesman
for the peacekeeping force.</TE>
<TE>   Among the company's biggest customers are military-related
industries in Yugoslavia, according to government officials and local
media reports, which has led many here to think that the road from
Bosnia to Baghdad ran through Belgrade.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems they had these contacts with Iraq through lines of
communication with Iraq established by the Yugoslav military," said a
Bosnian government official. "It is our understanding that the
Bosnian engineers are still in Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   The company says its last business with Iraq was in 1989 and its
last contact with Iraq was in 1997, when it was trying to collect
money owed from the period before the Bosnian war.</TE>
<TE>   Before vicious wars tore the Yugoslav federation apart during the
1990s, the country had a large army and a sophisticated
military-industrial complex that included manufacturers of weapons
and equipment as well as technical institutes where scientists and
military experts created new weapons technology.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship with Iraq, which flourished under President
Slobodan Milosevic, has roots that go back to the post-World War II
era of President Josip Broz Tito. He cultivated government, business
and cultural contacts with a number of nonaligned countries,
particularly in the Middle East and Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Iraq is one of the few countries for which Yugoslavs do not
need a visa. The most common route from Belgrade to Baghdad is to
Amman, Jordan, and then by road to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Since the fall of Milosevic in 2000, both the Yugoslav and
Republika Srpska militaries have had barely enough money to keep
themselves going and have always looked for income opportunities to
help them keep their soldiers paid and fed.</TE>
<TE>   But despite its impoverishment, the Yugoslav military in
particular remains a powerful and independent force within the
government, and largely uncontrolled by civilian leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "Most likely the relations with Iraq are driven by business and
not ideology, although they have similar interest in irritating
Americans, embarrassing them," said Misic, the Bosnian deputy foreign
minister.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials first raised their concerns about Orao on Sept. 5
with Bosnian Foreign Minister Zlatko Lagumdzija, said ministry
spokesman Amer Kapetanovic. The U.S. officials said they had
information that both equipment and military expertise were being
transferred to Iraq, Kapetanovic said.</TE>
<TE>   The main concern appears to be that the company may have sent
military experts to Iraq, said several Bosnian officials, speaking on
the condition that their names not be used because the official
investigation is ongoing. "As far as we know, the engineers are still
in Iraq," one Bosnian government official said.</TE>
<TE>   Orao, which means Eagle and is the name of one of the two types of
planes that the company worked on for the Yugoslav military, is one
of several military firms in Republika Srpska that specialize in the
repair of military hardware and airplanes. In the past, its main area
of expertise was the overhaul of jet engines.</TE>
<TE>   After the 3 1/2-year war that saw Bosnia break away from
Yugoslavia ended in 1995, Orao shifted its focus to civilian
projects. Its partners include Rolls-Royce, which is also a maker of
airplane engines, according to reports in Slobodna Bosna, an
independent weekly magazine in Bosnia.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Highway Patrol is seeking a murder charge against a
woman who allegedly caused a freeway accident while drunk and then
fled without attempting to aid the other driver. That motorist died
at the scene.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Danielle L. Mason, 20, of Los Angeles sideswiped a
Jeep Cherokee driven by Cary Robert Grant, 37, of Hollywood Hills on
the eastbound Ventura Freeway near White Oak Avenue about 10:45 p.m.
Thursday. Both vehicles skidded onto the shoulder, where the Jeep hit
a tree.</LD>
<LD>   According to officers, witnesses said Mason watched the Jeep catch
fire, then backed up and drove away at high speed. A motorist
followed her for two miles, until Mason's car broke down, while
another passerby tried to help Grant, police said. Officers arrested
Mason on Haskell Avenue.</LD>
<TE>   Officer Leland Tang said the CHP is asking the district attorney
for a murder charge because Mason left the scene and "did absolutely
nothing" to help Grant.</TE>

<LD>Two Los Angeles police officers rescued an 83-year-old woman from her
burning home Friday, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Officers Andrew Kukla and Yusoff Thaimas were driving on the 101
Freeway about 2:45 a.m. when they saw smoke billowing from a home in
the 4700 block of Mary Ellen Avenue, said a Fire Department
spokesman. From the front lawn, the woman's husband directed officers
to his wife, who was unconscious in the living room.</LD>
<LD>   She was later listed in critical condition at Sherman Oaks
Hospital. The officers were treated for smoke inhalation.</LD>
<TE>   It took firefighters 18 minutes to extinguish the fire, which had
been caused by a defective lamp cord.</TE>

<HD>Some in Ojai Call Deputies Bullies</HD>
<DH>Community: A stepped-up effort to enforce traffic laws
draws complaints. But the chief insists that most residents of the
small town are appreciative.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trouble's brewing in bucolic Ojai. And the guys in the black hats,
some residents say, are overzealous sheriff's deputies in police
cruisers.</LD>
<LD>   In a time when cities skimp to put more police on the street, some
residents in this quiet town of artists, giant oaks and famously pink
sunsets say they have too many cops.</LD>
<LD>   "We're over-policed," said artist Sarra Jubinville, 65, an
Ojai-area resident for 25 years. "Citizens are intimidated by the
heavy-handed and ubiquitous police presence."</LD>
<TE>   Jubinville said she has gathered 250 signatures on petitions
posted around town asking the City Council to form a citizens'
commission to stop officers from "over-exerting their authority in
what could be considered an aggressive and bullying manner."</TE>
<TE>   Jubinville plans a "town hall" meeting Oct. 2 at which residents
will be able to share their stories about what they see as police
harassment.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Capt. Gary Pentis, who functions as the Ojai police
chief, said people shouldn't make too much of what he considers an
ill-advised campaign by Jubinville and a handful of others.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little frustrating, because the [officers] at this station
do a really good job, and the public really appreciates what we do,"
Pentis said. "But we have a couple of fringe people who are stirring
things up."</TE>
<TE>   It's true, he said, that deputies more than doubled the number of
motor vehicle and pedestrian citations they wrote during the first
half of this year, compared with the first six months of 2001--from
325 to 677.</TE>
<TE>   But that was a concerted strategy to make local motorists slow
down and follow the law, he said, and not the result of ticky-tack
enforcement aimed at raising money through fines, as critics
maintain.</TE>
<TE>   Five Ojai pedestrians, including two students crossing a street
near Nordhoff High School, have been injured by motorists in the last
12 months, the captain said.</TE>
<TE>   And residents of several neighborhoods asked the City Council for
beefed-up patrols because motorists were taking shortcuts across town
and speeding down residential streets, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the City Council hired motorcycle Officer Tom
Triplett last fall to enforce traffic laws. Pentis also ordered
officers in the two patrol cars that cruise Ojai each day to step up
their enforcement of traffic and parking violations.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent months, the moves have drawn complaints from
Jubinville and others. Ojai resident John Wilcock, who publishes the
Ojai Orange newspaper, declared in a July letter to the editor of
another paper: "The drawback to a town with very little crime is that
the occupying force has to find something to do to justify their
day's 'work.' "</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Rae Hanstad said she is pleased with the way
deputies have addressed a speeding problem that residents often
complained about.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm out and about in this community all the time," said Hanstad,
interim director of the Ojai Valley Museum. "And I have not heard one
complaint from a constituent."</TE>

<HD>Do Big Money and Bohemians Mix?</HD>
<DH>Culture: 'Creative class' of artists is seen by a
sociologist as key to cities' economic development, but others say
they play a small role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Florida has advice for city officials seeking to pump life
into sluggish local economies: Forget breaking your back or your
budget to lure mega malls and convention centers to town. There's a
much easier way: Recruit a healthy "creative class."</LD>
<LD>   That would include those clever bohemians, loft-dwelling artists
and skateboarding techies who made places such as the Bay Area thrive
in the late 1990s. Make no mistake, the Carnegie Mellon professor
says, the Internet bubble may have burst, but the creative class that
fueled it--nose rings, tattoos, spiked hair and all--still reigns
when it comes to transforming a sleepy suburb or depressed downtown
into the next boomtown.</LD>
<LD>   That's the gist of Florida's best-selling book "The Rise of the
Creative Class," which has generated buzz from his ivory tower in
Pittsburgh to the economic development offices of Southern
California. His thesis has become the focus of debate among both
trend watchers and planners in cities, such as Santa Ana, Brea and
Riverside, that are seeking to revive--or create from
scratch--downtowns ravaged by decades of suburban sprawl.</LD>
<TE>   His theory discourages cities from building another "big-box"
retailer. Instead, cities serious about enlivening the local business
scene are encouraged to lure creative types with happening music
scenes, thriving gay and ethnic communities, and maybe even tax
breaks for bohemians and other artsy types who fuel the information
economy. Census information is used to make the case that cities with
a big creative class are flourishing while others remain stagnant,
depleted of creative talent thanks to a bland cultural scene.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going through a big economic change," said Florida. It used
to be that workers lived where the company was, he said, but now
"companies go where the highly-skilled people live."</TE>
<TE>   Local boosters of the theory note that these are renaissance days
for diverse places with a grass-roots arts movements and funky
live-work spaces: Pasadena, Santa Monica and downtown Los Angeles.
Orange County has been able to cash in by attracting entrepreneurs to
homes among the seaside cafes of Laguna Beach or the budding arts
scene in Santa Ana. Their start-up companies fill the offices of
Irvine and Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Yet others caution chambers of commerce against recruiting new
residents at Phish concerts and the X Games. They suggests that
Florida's theory is a holdover from the heady days of the late 1990s
and no longer applies in these more conservative times.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of this thinking that the high-tech folks just want to move
into the cool district is a product of the bubble economy," said Joel
Kotkin, author of "The New Geography: How the Digital Revolution Is
Reshaping the American Landscape," a book Florida used, ironically,
in developing his creative class theory. "Saying there is a
connection between bohemianism and economic development is a stretch
now."</TE>
<TE>   Wishful liberal thinking is how Kotkin, himself a liberal,
characterizes the creative class outlook. Under its structure, the
cities that supposedly do the best are the ones that encourage gay
rights and immigration.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that Silicon Valley is not where it is because of
gay people," Kotkin said. "Most of those guys were nerds from the
Midwest who went to San Francisco for dinner every once in a while.
They liked the climate and cleanliness of Palo Alto."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the diversity of the Bay Area did not play a major
role in its boom.</TE>
<TE>   He questions the concept that openness and tolerance are what
makes a city attractive to the most brilliant of the New Economy--the
buzz-term for that segment focused on new computer and
telecommunication technologies.</TE>
<TE>   "They might like diversity if it means having an Indian doctor
living next door," Kotkin said. "But are they eager to have a house
crowded with three families from El Salvador next door? I don't think
so."</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: "It just doesn't make a lot sense for cities to
recruit some 27-year-old bearded guy smoking a joint and eating a
goat-cheese pizza," Kotkin said.</TE>
<TE>   So what's a city to do to bring the New Economy to town? Kotkin
urges a measured infusion of urban culture that has broad appeal. The
construction of lofts and apartments in downtown districts is a good
place to start, he says. In other words, follow the model of Santa
Monica and Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Demographics experts warn that it's the absence of that kind of
housing in much of the "boomburbs" surrounding Los Angeles--those
rapidly growing powerhouses that remain suburban in character--that
keeps them from cashing in on the New Economy.</TE>
<TE>   William Gartner, a professor of business at USC, is co-author of a
study that concludes that entrepreneurial activity is directly
related to how urban a city is--more urban equals more start-up
companies per capita. He says that positions downtown L.A. to come
back in a big way.</TE>
<TE>   "This is no longer a Fortune 500 town, but those office buildings
are being filled with other things," Gartner said.</TE>

<HD>Less O.C. Money From Sales Taxes, Car Fees Predicted</HD>
<DH>Finance: Chapman report suggests county budget, already
facing a $57-million deficit, will be hit by the area's slow job
growth in the second half of the year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County, already facing a $57-million budget deficit, got more
bad news Friday in the form of a Chapman University report predicting
reduced revenue from sales taxes and car-license fees.</LD>
<LD>   The forecast, produced by economist Esmael Adibi, director of
Chapman's Anderson Center for Economic Research, suggests that the
county's budget will be hit by the area's slow job growth in the
second half of the year.</LD>
<LD>   "The only bright spot is in property taxes, because home prices
have gone up and sales action has increased. But in all other
components of the county's revenue, they're going to be under
pressure," Adibi said.</LD>
<TE>   Orange County saw modest job growth earlier this year, but Adibi
believes that will decline slightly by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   "Jobs drive the model for projections," he said. "Because if
personal income doesn't grow, spending goes down."</TE>
<TE>   Adibi said it is too early to tell exactly how much tax revenue
the county will lose.</TE>
<TE>   The county already has made cuts in social services because of
reductions in funding from the state.</TE>
<TE>   The county anticipates at least $40 million in additional cuts to
its $4.3-billion budget later this year, said Michael Schumacher, the
county's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   He has asked department administrators to recommend where expenses
can be trimmed. Schumacher will then use labor-management committees,
set up in each department, to help make further recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too premature to list where the cuts will be, because we
still are in the process of getting that information," Schumacher
said.</TE>
<TE>   The county has frozen hiring and is seeking approval for an early
retirement incentive program that would cover 1,080 supervisors ages
50 and up.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the Social Services Agency trimmed $39 million from
welfare-to-work programs, adoptions, day care, job retraining and
transportation for thousands of low-income residents.</TE>
<TE>   "In social services there are more lines for services and longer
waits, because caseloads are larger," said Gary Burton, the county's
chief finance officer.</TE>
<TE>   Some managers have expressed concerns about the proposed employee
buyout plan, which they fear will drain them of their most
experienced workers.</TE>
<TE>   They also worry about how additional cutbacks will affect services
the public receives.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pension Plan Suffers Loss</TE>
<TE>   One major impact has been on the county's $4.5-billion pension
fund, which had expected an 8% gain last year but instead saw a 3.2%
loss, forcing county government to make up the difference.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the state, municipal governments have felt the budget
crunch from retirement plans approved during the stock market boom of
the late 1990s that are now coming home to roost.</TE>
<TE>   It represents the third consecutive year the fund has either been
flat or posted a loss, said John M.W. Moorlach, the county's
treasurer-tax collector, who sits on the pension fund board.</TE>
<TE>   "It's historic," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "During the good times, when the stock market was stronger, Gov.
Davis signed lots of legislation calling for more benefits. What they
didn't expect was three years in a row of declining returns." The
pension fund is considering whether to shift its allocations into
safer investments and whether to lower its 8% assumed gain, which is
its benchmark for long-term investments, said Keith Bozarth,
executive director of the Orange County Employees Retirement system.</TE>

<HD>Film Board Urged to Review Its Spending</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County officials Friday urged the quasi-public agency
that provides local film permits to convene an emergency meeting of
its executive board in light of a district attorney's investigation
of its possible misuse of public funds.</LD>
<LD>   The report by County Counsel Lloyd W. Pellman and Chief
Administrative Officer David Janssen recommends that the
Entertainment Industry Development Corp.'s executive committee review
the agency's spending practices. It also recommended a review of the
performance of agency President Cody Cluff, whose $300,000 expense
account was cited in court papers by prosecutors after they carried
out a search warrant at his home last week.</LD>
<LD>   The agency was formed by the county and the Los Angeles City
Council in 1995 to streamline the film permitting process and to help
keep movie production in the region. Prosecutors argue it is a public
agency that appears to have recklessly spent its funds and
contributed money to elected politicians on its board. Agency
officials contend it is private and entitled to spend the money
received from film permits as it sees fit.</LD>
<TE>   In a statement released Friday, Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who
sits on the board along with three other county supervisors and the
entire City Council, said the matter could not wait until the
scheduled board meeting in late October.</TE>
<TE>   "These are extremely serious issues affecting the conduct of
government business and the public's perception thereof," he said.</TE>

<HD>Residents Split on 101 Expansion</HD>
<DH>Transit: Some support plans to ease traffic, but others
worry about losing homes.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No matter what transportation officials decide to do about the
traffic congestion on the 101 Freeway, it's clear that not everyone
will be happy.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles area residents who attended a community open house in
Encino on Thursday night passionately told state and local officials
about worries, including the potential loss of homes, if the freeway
is expanded, even as others insisted that something had to be done
about the traffic mess.</LD>
<LD>   As residents clustered around the numerous California Department
of Transportation maps and drawings displayed in the auditorium at
the Encino Community Center, they were deeply divided about what to
do about the 101 corridor, the subject of an ongoing $4.5-million
study.</LD>
<TE>   Officials are considering proposals that involve adding freeway
lanes, building an elevated expressway and constructing a light-rail
line.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 people attended the open house.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, a dozen people were carrying signs with slogans such as
"Caltrans: Hands Off Ventura Fwy." and "No Double Decking."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors and strangers engaged in impromptu debates, which at
times erupted into shouting matches. "This state has to think of the
transportation needs of future generations!" said Zan Green, a
retired real estate appraiser from Tarzana.</TE>
<TE>   As Green argued for expanding the freeway, Christopher Sabatino, a
Studio City chiropractor who lives one house away from the freeway,
said: "You can't take people's homes and livelihood.... Most of us
have worked so hard to build our homes." Green shot back: "Some
people have to sacrifice for the good of the greater. You may have to
be sacrificed for the greater good!"</TE>
<TE>   A committee that includes representatives from Caltrans, the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the city of Los Angeles and
the Las Virgenes-Malibu Council of Governments will be grappling with
such issues in the next few months.</TE>
<TE>   To present options and solicit feedback, the officials have been
holding community meetings and open houses along the 40-mile section
of the freeway being studied, from downtown Los Angeles to Thousand
Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   The officials are expected to announce their preferred strategy in
December, and then will try to obtain funding.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, officials said that if nothing is done, traffic will
only worsen as population along the corridor is projected to grow by
25% by 2025.</TE>
<TE>   "[Doing nothing] is dumb," said Hank Yuloff, a former president of
the Encino Chamber of Commerce. "If you sit on the freeway going
nowhere, something's got to be done."</TE>
<TE>   But several residents remained unsatisfied with what they heard.</TE>
<TE>   "The one question I had to ask, 'Are you going to flatten my
home?' nobody will answer. They tell me it's a study, [that such a
possibility] is 20 years away," said Connie Hearn, a post-production
supervisor for film advertising, who lives in Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Anderson, a Sherman Oaks engineer, summed up the officials'
policy dilemma: "The problem is, no matter what they do, it's going
to upset a lot of people."</TE>

<HD>Attorney, Wife Chase Down Suspect in Attack on Woman</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An attorney and his wife were credited for their courage and quick
thinking Friday when they saw a woman being assaulted in North
Hollywood, then chased down the suspected attacker and held him until
help arrived, Los Angeles police said.</LD>
<LD>   Enrique Zuniga, a 47-year-old immigration attorney, was driving
with his wife and two children on Tujunga Avenue about 10:15 p.m.
Thursday when they saw a man hitting a 19-year-old woman and trying
to remove her pants.</LD>
<LD>   "I was driving down the street and my wife said, 'Rick! Rick, stop
the car! Stop the car!' " Zuniga said. "I saw the woman trying to
escape."</LD>
<TE>   Police do not recommend what Zuniga did next. He jumped from his
car and chased the man for half a mile with his wife Milly, 35, in
close pursuit in the couple's Chevrolet Suburban. She called police
from her cell phone while Zuniga, who was not hurt, held the man.</TE>
<TE>   "His actions were very dangerous because you don't know when a
suspect is armed or not and most citizens are not equipped or trained
to handle these situations," said Officer Jason Lee, a spokesman for
the LAPD. "At the same time, the gentleman should be praised for his
bravery."</TE>
<TE>   Kelvin Yaredy Lopez, 20, of Sun Valley was booked on suspicion of
assault and is being held at the LAPD's Van Nuys Division jail,
police said. His arraignment is scheduled for Monday.</TE>
<TE>   So what possessed Zuniga to take action? He said he has a black
belt in karate and was enraged by what he saw.</TE>
<TE>   "With all the child abductions and the rapes ... I was angry that
someone could victimize and try to rape an innocent girl," Zuniga
said.</TE>

<HD>Kerkorian to Pay $50,316 Per Month</HD>
<DH>Custody: Ruling rejects demand for $320,000 the
billionaire's ex-wife sought to maintain child's lifestyle. Judge
calls claim 'incredible.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles judge on Friday ordered billionaire Kirk Kerkorian to
pay his ex-wife Lisa Bonder Kerkorian $50,316 a month to support
their 4-year-old daughter in the style to which the little girl is
accustomed.</LD>
<LD>   That is far less than the $320,000 Lisa Kerkorian had demanded, a
figure that Judge Lee Smalley Edmon called "incredible" and "a
disguised form of spousal support."</LD>
<LD>   After the ruling, a visibly upset Lisa Kerkorian said the judge
"severely underestimated the cost it takes to maintain our daughter
in a lifestyle he created for her." During the trial, she had
increased her demand to $1.5 million per month, which she argued she
was entitled to under California's guidelines for child support.</LD>
<TE>   In a case that has drawn worldwide attention since it was filed in
January, Lisa Kerkorian has argued that she needs at least $320,000
month for private jet flights, hotel accommodations, horses and
parties for Kira.</TE>
<TE>   The 84-year-old mogul was married to the 37-year-old former tennis
pro for only a month in 1999. And although the two had a decade-long
romance, it emerged this spring that Kerkorian is not the girl's
natural father. Lisa Kerkorian admitted that she had faked the DNA
paternity test by using saliva from Kerkorian's adult daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kerkorian said he was willing to support Kira because he
had grown attached to her.</TE>
<TE>   Until the dispute began, Kerkorian had been paying $50,000 a
month. At a recent hearing, he suggested an alternative figure of
$22,206 a month.</TE>
<TE>   But Edmon set the amount at $50,316 after compiling her own
itemized list of appropriate expenses, using actual costs incurred
during 2001 as her guide.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Kerkorian, who is the majority shareholder in the
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer movie studio and the MGM Mirage Inc. and is worth
an estimated $4.5 billion, said they were pleased with the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of accepting the fantasy world presented by Lisa
Kerkorian, [the judge] followed the law and the facts and ruled on
the basis of common sense," said Dennis Wasser.</TE>
<TE>   In her ruling, Edmon said Kira "is entitled to live a luxurious
lifestyle."</TE>
<TE>   Edmon awarded her $2,400 a month for equestrian activities, $1,400
a month for French and ballet lessons and other such activities.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Kerkorian had claimed she spent $3,900 a month on clothes and
$11,000 per month for meals for her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The judge tossed those and other demands out as "grossly exceeding
the reasonable needs of the child." By Edmon's calculations, that
would mean purchasing a $130 outfit for Kira every day. As for
$11,000 a month for food, the judge said, "that's enough to feed
quite a few people."</TE>
<TE>   The judge also dismissed the mother's demand for $6,000 a month
for house flowers and $150,000 a month for private jet travel.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Edmon said Kira could have $8,500 a month for travel
expenses, according to Kirk Kerkorian's lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll live with this," said Bruce Cooperman, one of Kirk
Kerkorian's attorneys. "For a 4-year-old, she'll be able to go
virtually anywhere very high-end. The nicest hotels. The nicest
ground transportation. The nicest meals. She'll be fine."</TE>
<TE>   The judge said the $50,316 would be paid retroactive to Feb. 1.
She also ordered Kirk Kerkorian to pay $175,000 of his wife's legal
expenses, on top of the $250,000 Kerkorian had been previously
ordered to pay.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Lisa Kerkorian said she was unhappy with her legal
representation and would file an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a lifestyle case," she said. "I don't believe my position
was advocated fairly."</TE>

<HD>O.C. City Hopes to Get a Lift From Lofts</HD>
<DH>Housing: Santa Ana is subsidizing 86 live-work units
downtown. Artists are excited, but some merchants fear that
anticipated higher rents could force them out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County, a suburban mecca for gated communities and three-car
garages, is about to get a dose of big-city life.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Ana is subsidizing the construction of 86 "live-work" lofts
just off the bustling 4th Street Latino shopping district, stylish
yet relatively affordable living accommodations that city leaders
hope will help revitalize downtown.</LD>
<LD>   Even though the lofts have stirred up suspicion and uncertainty
among some local merchants, city Redevelopment Director John P.
Reekstin said the artists and professionals expected to move in will
bring a renewed energy--and money--that will benefit everyone
downtown.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a city-driven effort," said Reekstin. "It's something
more reflective of Los Angeles, San Diego or Long Beach. We believe
it will attract artists and drive our downtown."</TE>
<TE>   The lofts, versatile spaces that have few walls and many uses,
will be finished by the end of the year near the shopping zone and
Santa Ana's budding artists' district, and even more may be on the
way.</TE>
<TE>   Urban lofts are commonplace in other cities but they're somewhat
new to Orange County, where 25% of the homes are ensconced in gated
communities, according to a recent UC Irvine study.</TE>
<TE>   To see how artists lofts have triggered economic development in
other cities, Santa Ana officials traveled to Portland, Ore., and
toured the city's Pearl District, where lofts and a small artists
village have evolved into a dynamic attraction.</TE>
<TE>   That's what they hope will happen in downtown Santa Ana, where the
Artists Village has sprouted up alongside traditional Latino shopping
and modest homes and apartments. The Artists Village includes 12
galleries and more than 100 artists, although fewer actually live in
the city.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana artists are excited about the lofts, even though some
may be unable to buy the units that will cost between $275,000 and
$350,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fabulous. It really establishes a permanent community for
artists," artist Margie Zuliani said. "A lot of artists do resent the
cost, but that is the reality in Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   The idea of building lofts in Santa Ana dates to the late 1980s,
Reekstin said. The soft real estate market made it hard for the city
to act until last year, however, when the redevelopment agency
purchased three blocks of land between Main, Bush, Sycamore and 2nd
streets for $2.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Then officials scouted around for a developer, and picked the
Olson Co., which had built lofts in Long Beach. Santa Ana sold Olson
the downtown parcel for $900,000, basically giving the company a
$1.2-million subsidy.</TE>
<TE>   Already, there are 60 prospective buyers on a waiting list, said
Lenette Hewitt, Olson Co. sales and marketing director. The units
will be 1,500 to 2,000 square feet, and include garages. Among the
buyers, Hewitt said, are an interior decorator, an art gallery owner
and a concert violinist.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve units have already been sold. Thirty lofts will be
completed by December, she said. The city also has been contacted by
four other development firms interested in building four units in the
area, said Matt Lamb, Santa Ana's downtown development manager.</TE>
<TE>   An additional four lofts will be built above a Save-On drugstore
on the corner of First and Sycamore streets in Santa Ana, thanks in
part to a legal settlement of a zoning dispute between the city and a
Beverly Hills development firm, Charles Co. The company is expected
to complete the lofts by the fall of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "Lofts are new to all of Southern California but they are popular
particularly with artists. It certainly helps us to continue the
artists district," Charles attorney Fred Gaines said.</TE>
<TE>   And there is talk of yet another loft developer looking at
property near the Artists Village.</TE>
<TE>   In the Latino shopping district, many merchants fear the lofts
will begin to "whitewash," or gentrify, downtown Santa Ana--luring
affluent professionals and upscale shops and driving out existing
residents with increasing rents.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Romero, owner of St. Teresa's Catholic Shop on 4th Street,
said city officials never bothered to consult with the merchants
about the new lofts.</TE>
<TE>   "I think eventually they wouldn't mind if only a small percentage
of us survive," Romero said. "We have no input at all."</TE>
<TE>   Joann Ramirez, a Santa Ana Historical Preservation Society member,
opposes the Sav-On lofts because the project would require the
demolition of a historic building.</TE>
<TE>   "They want jazz and pizazz," Ramirez said. "They want to get rid
of the people who are there now."</TE>
<TE>   The lofts being built by the Olson Co. have given the city one of
its first real tests on balancing the needs of the established Latino
community and newcomers.</TE>

<HD>Reptile Probably Went for a Rock-Bottom Price at a Big Bear
Garage Sale</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Yes, it is a pretty belt, but it seems to be moving: The sheriff's
log of the Big Bear Grizzly carried an alert about "a rattlesnake on
a rock in the middle of a driveway and garage sale." (Maybe it was
one of those you-can-have-it-if-you-can-haul-it deals.)</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Better than 'the dog ate my homework': Well, wait until the claims
adjuster gets this one. Big Bear's newspaper reported the vandalizing
of a car this way: "Appears bear ate car bumper and wiring harness.
Scratches found along with fur."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of unusual delicacies: Today's dining specials (see
accompanying) include:</TE>
<TE>   * A famous Philadelphia sandwich with a woodsy taste (Jolene
Collins of Tujunga)</TE>
<TE>   * An antique hamburger (Miriam Schildberg of Ontario)</TE>
<TE>   * Some kielbasa that can also be aged (Michael Sautter of Simi
Valley)</TE>
<TE>   And, finally, important information for owners of pooches that
weigh zero pounds (Maria Fahrenholz of Newhall).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Probably doesn't pay much in taxes either: I think it's unhealthy
to brood about the earnings of people around you, but not everyone
agrees with me. The police log of the Huntington Beach Wave said a
motorist on Brookhurst Street complained about a man "who was on the
center divider asking people for money and was 'making good money.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reverse snob appeal: One thing I like about radio is how the
industry takes itself less seriously--at least in its ads--than
pompous television does. Consider these show descriptions:</TE>
<TE>   * "Less painful than waxing" (Danny Bonaduce, KYSR-FM, 98.7)</TE>
<TE>   * "The WeaKIIS Link" (Rick Dees, KIIS-FM, 102.7)</TE>
<TE>   * "ESPN Radio--rolls off the tongue like sneakers in a Maytag
dryer, don't it?" (network ad)</TE>
<TE>   * And, finally, one I heard the other day:</TE>
<TE>   "By popular demand, one hour less, 4 to 7 p.m." (Joe McDonnell and
Doug Krikorian, KSPN-AM, 1110)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who really dunnit: We've all read news stories about people who
are convicted of crimes and sent to jail but later freed when they
turn out to be innocent. But how about a villain in a mystery novel
who turns out not to be the villain in the movie version of the book?</TE>
<TE>   That's the turnabout in "Blood Work," the movie taken from the
best-selling Michael Connelly novel about a retired FBI agent looking
for a serial killer in L.A. And DNA was not a factor in the cinematic
version. I guess the movie folks just wanted to tighten up the plot.
(Connelly did not write the screenplay.)</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, you can see the marketing potential here. If the makers of
the "Blood Work" movie were smart, they'd use this line in their
advertising: "You Only THINK You Know Who Did It!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: A letter from Arkansas was addressed to "Steve Harvey,
L.A. Times columnist, or current resident." What do they know back
there? Hope to see you Tuesday.*</TE>
<TE>   Steve Harvey hopefully can be reached at (800) LA-TIMES, ext.

<HD>Psychiatrist's Appointment to Abuse Panel Criticized</HD>
<DH>Catholics: Some victims' advocates oppose the expert, who
is against patient therapy based on recovered memory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Ever since U.S. Roman Catholic bishops set up a review board this
summer to monitor the church's response to the clerical sex abuse
crisis, victims' advocates have been voicing concern about a
prominent psychiatrist named to the group.</LD>
<LD>   Paul McHugh, a longtime department chairman at Johns Hopkins
University, has vowed to fight child abuse "tooth and nail." But he
is being criticized for his opposition to therapy for sex abuse
victims based on recovered memory.</LD>
<LD>   David Clohessy, national director of the Survivor's Network for
Those Abused by Priests, said his group is troubled by McHugh, who
has testified in court on behalf of accused abusers he believed were
innocent. Clohessy said McHugh's reputation could keep victims from
coming forward.</LD>
<TE>   "When people read that--whether it's fair or not--you know people
are going to be tempted to say, 'Well, forget it. The deck is
stacked,' " Clohessy said.</TE>
<TE>   McHugh replies that "it's pretty ridiculous that people would say
that I'm not on the side of abused children and young people."</TE>
<TE>   The psychiatrist will join other members of the National Review
Board for a meeting Monday in Oklahoma City, where they will discuss
ways to evaluate how well dioceses are complying with the reform
policy approved by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in June.
The board members were appointed by Bishop Wilton Gregory, the
conference president.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to McHugh has arisen in part because of his support for
the False Memory Foundation, a Philadelphia group whose members work
to debunk a therapy based on the belief that traumatic experiences
can be repressed for years.</TE>
<TE>   McHugh said the therapy has created false memories of abuse in
some patients, causing people to be unfairly accused.</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible to be on the side of the abused person and still be
on the side of somebody who was falsely accused too," McHugh said.
"Not only are they compatible. They are implicit in one another."</TE>
<TE>   But Lana Lawrence, who has edited a news journal for adults who
were abused as children, said McHugh and members of the False Memory
Foundation have too often come down on the side of alleged abusers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that he has done a lot to hurt victims, and no matter how
much he claims he cares about victims, his past actions speak
otherwise," she said.</TE>
<TE>   McHugh, 71, has served as a lay Catholic member of a board that
reviews child sexual abuse cases for the Archdiocese of Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   He also testified on behalf of the Rev. A. Joseph Maskell and the
Baltimore Archdiocese in a 1995 lawsuit filed by two women who
claimed the priest raped them in the 1970s when they were high school
students.</TE>
<TE>   The women sought an exemption to the statute of limitations on
such lawsuits, arguing that post-traumatic stress disorder prevented
them from recalling the rape for 20 years. McHugh discounted the
scientific validity of their claims, and Maryland courts refused to
extend the limit.</TE>
<TE>   Out of the thousands of mental health experts the bishops could
have chosen, Clohessy said, "I think it's sad and perhaps telling
that they select one who ... repeatedly sided with molesters."</TE>
<TE>   McHugh said he believes he was chosen because of his experience.
For 26 years, he was chairman of the department of psychiatry and
behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
He is now a professor emeritus.</TE>
<TE>   While he doesn't deny the possibility that abuse could be
forgotten by young victims, McHugh said that "clear misdirections of
standard psychiatric practice" have resulted in thousands of false
abuse claims--of all types, not just church-related--over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence said she believes McHugh is exaggerating the number of
false accusations. Paul Fink, professor of psychiatry at Temple
University and past president of the American Psychiatric Assn., said
McHugh's views on repressed memories focus on poor therapists and
ignore good ones.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes we have to believe what the child says, or what the
adult person says happened to them as a child, and we have techniques
as therapists to determine whether they are valid or invalid
statements," Fink said.</TE>
<TE>   But Catholic leaders and McHugh's colleagues still support him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just cautioned that one needs to work very hard to get it
right," said Frederick Berlin, another psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins.
"He's very concerned that children who have been abused be believed.
That's critically important."</TE>

<HD>Pollster Prods Christian Conservatives</HD>
<DH>Change: George Barna stirs emotions in the evangelical
world as he pushes for a more relevant church.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pollster George Barna, best known these days as the bearer of bad
tidings about the state of Christianity in America, arrived in his
Ventura office a few minutes late for a 10 a.m. appointment.</LD>
<LD>   His hair was ruffled. His eyes were puffy. His shoulders slouched.
Being the George Gallup of the conservative evangelical world is a
heavy burden for Barna, who often works into the early morning,
deciphering numbers generated by his surveys to find church trends.</LD>
<LD>   The lanky, 48-year-old author of 30 books, who describes himself
as a raging introvert, is a popular national speaker. And he produces
enough in-your-face statistics and blunt talk to irritate pastors,
cost him business and earn a reputation for having, as one magazine
put it, "the gift of discouragement."</LD>
<TE>   His data undercut some of the core beliefs that should, by
definition, set evangelical Christians apart from their more liberal
brethren. Findings of his polls show, for example, that:</TE>
<TE>   * The divorce rate is no different for born-again Christians than
for those who do not consider themselves religious.</TE>
<TE>   * Only a minority of born-again adults (44%) and a tiny proportion
of born-again teenagers (9%) are certain that absolute moral truth
exists.</TE>
<TE>   * Most Christians' votes are influenced more by economic
self-interest than by spiritual and moral values.</TE>
<TE>   * Desiring to have a close, personal relationship with God ranks
sixth among the 21 life goals tested among born-agains, trailing such
desires as "living a comfortable lifestyle."</TE>
<TE>   "Are people's lives being transformed" by Christianity? Barna has
asked. "We can't find evidence of a transformation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wide Impact</TE>
<TE>   Even Barna's toughest critics concede that Barna Research Group's
polls carry considerable weight because of Barna's first-rate
surveying techniques and his 17-year record of tracking church and
cultural trends.</TE>
<TE>   His work has been used by major companies (Ford Motor Co. and Walt
Disney, for example) and religious organizations such the Billy
Graham Evangelistic Assn. and World Vision.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the accepted authority on church trends," said Bob Cavin,
director of the Texas Baptist Leadership Center. "He gives pastors
insight, not only into the effectiveness of the church, but with
trends in society that helps the pastors with their strategic
planning."</TE>
<TE>   Because of his influence, many are watching with interest as a
frustrated Barna begins branching out from his usual business. He has
been preoccupied with quantifying contemporary Christian beliefs,
attitudes and practices; comparing them with biblical truths; and
delivering the results to pastors, Christian leaders and laity. He
said that he once hoped that his analyses would be used as building
blocks for more relevant churches.</TE>
<TE>   But he decided earlier this year to take a more proactive role by
helping to identify and develop a new and better generation of church
leaders who will boldly go where their predecessors haven't gone
before: to radically revamp the church. He said he believes the
process will take decades--generations--to complete.</TE>
<TE>   "One of our challenges is to revisit the structures and means
through which people experience Christ," Barna said. "People have
been talking about developing the 'new church' for the past several
decades, but nothing new has been forthcoming. The time is right."</TE>
<TE>   According to Barna, pastors are great teachers, but not
necessarily adept at leadership. To back up his claim, he cited one
of his own polls: It showed that only 12% of senior pastors say they
have the spiritual gift of leadership and 8% say they have the gift
of evangelism. In contrast, two-thirds say they have the gift of
teaching or preaching.</TE>
<TE>   "We, not God, have created a system that doesn't work and that
we're reluctant to change," said Barna, who addresses the problem in
his latest book, "A Fish Out of Water."</TE>
<TE>   Barna also is in the early stages of an effort to establish a
genuine and appealing Christian presence in secular entities: film,
music, media and politics. He has identified these as the
institutions that hold the most influence over Americans, a position
once held by the church.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Concerns Underscored</TE>
<TE>   What is needed is the effort of "skilled professionals who love
Christ and model his ways through their thoughts, words and behavior
in enviable and biblically consistent ways," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For Barna, the need for better leadership and better Christian
role models in the secular world was underscored by a poll his
company released earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   The survey showed that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks had
virtually no lasting effects on America's faith, despite a 20% rise
in church attendance during the first few weeks afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "We missed a huge opportunity," he said, adding that, because of
their own shallow faith, church regulars needed so much reassurance
themselves that they couldn't minister to newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   This is the kind of comment that bothers others in the evangelical
Christian community. Mike Regele, author of "The Death of the
Church," is one of many who believe the Barna Research Group's
statistical work is excellent, but the conclusions drawn by the
company's founder are too harsh.</TE>
<TE>   The hypocrisy of Christians, Regele said, "has been a part of the
church, probably since the day of Pentecost," and doesn't indicate
the collapse of churches.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's the concern I have: It sounds like he's very, very angry
at the church," said Regele, a church critic himself who, despite the
provocative title of his book, is ultimately an optimist. "There are
reasons to be disappointed, but Scripture never said we'd be perfect.
We shouldn't view the whole institution as a failure."</TE>
<TE>   With each new Barna poll or book, the attacks begin again: He's
too negative; he has it in for pastors; he's arrogant.</TE>
<TE>   The criticism "would affect any human being," said Barna, a
husband and father of two children. "We all want to be loved and
accepted by others, but we also have a higher calling to which we
each must be true."</TE>
<TE>   Barna said he has learned painfully, over years, that giving
advice on how to revitalize churches in America is a hugely complex
proposition that doesn't fit well into sound bites or newspaper
stories. He has learned to be more guarded with his words.</TE>
<TE>   He will occasionally decline to answer a question--for example,
"Which churches in Southern California do you like?" He said an
honest answer will cause him more grief than it's worth.</TE>
<TE>   Barna said his bluntness--an attribute he sees in the Gospel
accounts of Jesus--has cost him business. Some churches and Christian
organizations have refused to hire him--or even to let him bid on
jobs--because he is "so negative."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, trust me, it's been bad," said Barna, who employs a dozen
full-time staff members and as many as 100 part-time workers during
surveys.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, he decided to test his theories for himself
and worked for a short time as a pastor at a local church. He said
that while he gained valuable first-hand experience, he discovered
quickly that God hadn't called him to be a pastor.</TE>
<TE>   "I know a couple thousand people who can attest to that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although his statistics often show self-described Christians
living lives no different from those of atheists, Barna's faith never
has wavered.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue isn't whether Jesus or Christianity is real," Barna
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is, are Americans willing to put Christ first in their
lives?"</TE>

<HD>San Diego Gets OK to Give Sewage Partial Treatment</HD>
<DH>Environment: State officials and the EPA allow the ongoing
practice of pumping partly treated effluent into the sea. Surfrider
Foundation may sue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>With the city's sewage treatment plant as a backdrop, Mayor Dick
Murphy on Friday announced the latest victory in the city's
decades-long fight to continue pumping sewage that is only partly
treated into the ocean.</LD>
<LD>   "Today's [ceremony] marks a victory for both the environment and
San Diego ratepayers," said Murphy.</LD>
<LD>   The ceremony was possible because the state Coastal Commission
this week backed down from an earlier decision that could have forced
San Diego to upgrade its Point Loma treatment plant to scrub a higher
percentage of contaminants from the 180 million gallons of treated
sewage dumped daily about 4.5 miles from the coast.</LD>
<TE>   San Diego officials had complained that the commission's April
decision could have forced the city to spend $4 billion for
improvements that they contend are not needed. Officials from the
Davis administration had sided with San Diego, saying the commission
had overstepped its legal authority.</TE>
<TE>   After the Coastal Commission reversal this week, the federal
Environmental Protection Agency moved to give the city a five-year
renewal of its waiver from the federal Clean Water Act.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Nastri, the agency's administrator for its Pacific Southwest
region, said scientific studies have shown that the sewage will not
harm the ocean environment. Nastri praised the city for "investing in
a strong [sewage] monitoring program and a good operating record at
the Point Loma plant."</TE>
<TE>   But officials of the San Diego Surfrider Foundation, who did not
attend the ceremony at the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant,
said they are considering a lawsuit to force the city to reduce the
level of contaminants being released.</TE>
<TE>   "What the city, and now EPA, is saying is: 'Let's wait until we
can show there is environmental damage before we do anything,' " said
foundation attorney Marco Gonzalez. "Why do we have to wait to act?
I'll do anything necessary to ensure that my kids get cleaner water
to swim in than today."</TE>
<TE>   The issue of the city's noncompliance with federal and state clean
water acts has been a political and legal controversy since before
then-Mayor Pete Wilson was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, the city and the federal government fought a
protracted legal battle over the EPA's insistence that the city
improve the Point Loma plant. After researchers from Scripps
Institution of Oceanography supported the city's contention that the
environment was not being damaged, a federal judge overruled the EPA.</TE>

<HD>City to Appeal Development Ruling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council voted Friday to appeal a court ruling
that handed Chatsworth residents a victory in their battle to block a
housing project by Airport Commission President Ted Stein.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a bad court decision," said Councilman Hal Bernson, who
was been criticized by some residents for pushing the 21-home
development for Stein, a close friend.</LD>
<LD>   After a half-hour closed session, the council voted unanimously to
appeal the May decision. It also directed the city to begin
addressing problems cited in the ruling by Superior Court Judge
Dzintra Janavs, who found flaws in the environmental review of the
project.</LD>
<TE>   Neighbors say the development would ruin the equestrian lifestyle
of the area by placing mansions on smaller lots next to horse stable
properties. In their lawsuit, the neighbors contend the city erred
when it changed zoning to allow Stein's project. They also challenged
the environmental review.</TE>
<TE>   Janavs issued a writ invalidating a general plan amendment that
allowed the 6.7-acre development.</TE>
<TE>   Anger over the project has helped fuel secession sentiments in the
Chatsworth area. One of the key project opponents, Jerry England, is
running for a City Council seat in the proposed San Fernando Valley
municipality. He is a founder of Chatsworth Land Preservation, formed
to fight the development.</TE>
<TE>   "It stinks," England said of Friday's council action. "This is all
about politically powerful people getting their way. That's what
secession is a reaction to."</TE>
<TE>   Last week Stein held a fund-raiser at his Encino home that
collected nearly $500,000 for Mayor James K. Hahn's anti-secession
campaign. Hahn appointed Stein's wife to the city Public Works Board,
and Stein's daughter is the mayor's field representative for the
south Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Stein, who has also appealed the ruling, said there was no
connection between the council's vote and his ties to Hahn and the
anti-secession effort. "We disagreed with the court's decision," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Before Friday's vote, Ann Marie Wise of the Chatsworth
preservation group urged the council to "follow the wishes of your
constituents in the San Fernando Valley" and not file the appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Bernson said the project will protect horse-keeping by preventing
commercial development on the acreage, at Chatsworth Street and
Topanga Canyon Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "This at least involves quarter-acre lots," Bernson said after the
vote.</TE>
<TE>   Stein bought the land from the Catholic Archdiocese of Los
Angeles. Since then, other properties in the area have been
subdivided into lots smaller than a half acre.</TE>
<TE>   Horse owners say they fear people moving into the homes on the
smaller lots will complain about the smell of the nearby stables, and
eventually drive the horses out.</TE>

<HD>Plump Political Pamphlet Is So, Well, San Francisco</HD>
<DH>Elections: City is the only one in California to include
paid public arguments on the issues. And in the City by the Bay,
there are opinions aplenty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>It's big, the size of a university course guide or a suburban
telephone book. It's packed with sometimes off-the-wall convictions,
diatribes and political rants, and it's soon to plop on doorsteps
across town, just in time for Election Day.</LD>
<LD>   That is, if the post office musters enough manpower to deliver it.</LD>
<LD>   Officials in this politically crazed city call it the Voter
Information Pamphlet and it went to the presses Thursday. Critics
call it something else: an example of American free speech run amok.</LD>
<TE>   At 350 pages and weighing a pound or more, the so-called VIP is
one more way that special interests get their spin on issues into the
hands of voters before Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   For $200 plus $2 a word, just about anyone can weigh in with an
opinion on any of the 19 local ballot measures--from new policies on
the homeless to whether the city should grow its own marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   The list of issues for voters to ponder includes seven state
propositions, three local bond measures, seven charter amendments,
eight ordinances, one declaration of policy and one regional rapid
transit system bond measure.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco is one of a handful of communities nationwide--and
the only in one California--to allow paid public arguments to
accompany local candidate statements and official ballot
instructions.</TE>
<TE>   But 27 years after launching the practice, San Francisco faces a
democratic conundrum. Many say the VIP and its paid ads have grown
too expensive to produce. But in a city where politics is a municipal
obsession, others defend the ads as a way for all political groups,
rich and poor, to get their messages to voters.</TE>
<TE>   This year, however, the VIP is nearly three times as large as the
previous edition's 125 pages and will be sent to each of the city's
438,000 registered voters at a cost of more than $1 million for
compilation and mailing. The fees for arguments help offset some of
the cost.</TE>
<TE>   Most city voter information guides are less than 100 pages,
officials say. The Los Angeles County registrar of voters in March
sent out sample ballot pamphlets ranging from 32 to 56 pages,
depending on local initiatives, but the county does not allow paid
arguments.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, the paid argument has risen to political art
form.</TE>
<TE>   "This one is a monster," John Arnst, acting director of the city's
Department of Elections, acknowledged of the fall 2002 edition of the
VIP, 80% of which is paid arguments. "I don't know how many people
take these things seriously, but we sure do get a lot of them."</TE>
<TE>   The guide is so big that it may not fit in most mail slots. The
U.S. Postal Service may have to use extra staff to get them all
delivered. Carriers on walking routes are limited to 35 pounds in
their satchels, so many might have to shorten their delivery loops to
accommodate the weighty tomes, said a postal spokesman, Dan De
Miglio.</TE>
<TE>   "But we're ready," he said. "This is what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Lobbyists say the VIP provides those with political opinions some
bang for their buck.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's a really cost-effective way to get our message out
to voters," said Jennifer Webber, campaign manager for a measure to
help fund a multibillion-dollar repair of the city's water delivery
system. "It's an invaluable tool that reaches every voter."</TE>
<TE>   But will people actually read the thing? Not banker Joe Iwanicki.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have time to read 350 pages," he said. "Fifty would be
just fine with me."</TE>
<TE>   A Canadian-born Bay Area resident, Judy Luck, who became an
American citizen several years ago, said she used to take the voter
guide seriously and spend weeks reading every page. "But now the
thing has gotten so big, I'm afraid of it," she said. "At some point,
you want to tell these people to just stop."</TE>
<TE>   Added a letter-to-the-editor writer in a local newspaper: "So the
city is going to spend a ton of money so it can send voter guides
weighing tons for the November election. Perhaps you could provide
the phone number of the chief of elections so I can remove my name
from the mailing list."</TE>
<TE>   Even some special interests agree that this year's VIP may be too
much of a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Diefendorf, co-president of the San Francisco League of
Women Voters, said her group had skipped the VIP because it feared
its message would get lost in the din.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought that if we could get on the first or second page, it
would be worth it, but not buried back with all the legions of other
arguments," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Diefendorf's group wants to study whether the VIP should be
limited. "There's certainly this fear that the thing has gotten so
big that people are turning their heads around and saying, 'I'm not
gonna read any of this. It's information overload and I just don't
want to deal with it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Some say the paid arguments demonstrate San Francisco's passion
for the political process. "This is a politically vibrant town,
probably the nation's most highly charged," said Rich DeLeon, a
political science professor at San Francisco State University.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a stark contrast between politically inert, apathetic and
disengaged cities like Los Angeles," he said. People in San Francisco
"do read the ads. There'd be a storm of outrage if they tried to do
away with them."</TE>
<TE>   Jane Morrison, co-chairwoman of the local Democratic Party,
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Elections are supposed to be all about sharing ideas," she said.
"Without the paid arguments, all you would have are the candidates'
viewpoints. I think these things get people stirred up to go out and
vote. And the fact that the book is so big shows that people in San
Francisco are interested in their community's issues."</TE>
<TE>   Critics have complained that, because the city recently raised the
fee for paid arguments from a flat rate of $50, many small groups
have been barred from expressing their views. The VIP, they contend,
has become a vanity sheet for well-funded lobbyists--many of which
run more than a dozen arguments on different issues.</TE>
<TE>   Arnst said the $150,000 collected from the paid arguments pays for
only a fraction of the VIP's cost. "It's not even close," he said.
"People are concerned over the cost of doing this. I checked and
found that Sacramento spends between $100,000 to $200,000 to mail out
their voter guides. We spend three times that, and it's because of
all the paid arguments."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco voter Iwanicki said he hoped the next VIP is more
user-friendly. "I could think of a lot better ways to spend a million
dollars," he said.</TE>

<HD>Lee Case Sparked Activism Among Asian Americans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH KONG</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>FREMONT, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Cecilia Chang says she used to look the other way when people talked
about "heavy stuff"--civil liberties, constitutional rights,
discrimination.</LD>
<LD>   Now she carries a stack of petitions, cajoling signatures from
strangers to bolster a presidential pardon campaign for her friend
Wen Ho Lee, the Taiwanese American scientist once suspected of spying
against the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago Friday--Sept. 13, 2000--Lee was freed from nine
months of solitary confinement as the investigation around him
crumbled.</LD>
<TE>   While convicted on a single count of copying sensitive nuclear
weapons data, Lee received an apology from a federal judge for his
treatment. The activism his case inspired continues to flourish in
Chang, along with many other Asian Americans who have no personal
connection to Lee.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really a watershed moment in terms of Asian Americans
coming of age," said Karen Narasaki, president of the National Asian
Pacific American Legal Consortium in Washington. "For the first time,
you had Asian American professionals thinking about criminal justice
and the issue of whether the government is always right."</TE>
<TE>   In Fremont, Chang has started a group inspired by the Lee case,
Justice for New Americans. In Sacramento, activist Ivy Lee created
the Chinese American Political Action Committee, which has about 30
members.</TE>
<TE>   And in Detroit, Marie-Ange Weng formed the Council of Asian
Pacific Americans, a coalition of groups with about 1,000 members.</TE>
<TE>   Wen Ho Lee, a former Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist, was
suspected of stealing what officials called the "crown jewels" of
U.S. nuclear weapons science with the intent of handing them over to
China.</TE>
<TE>   He was fired, then later arrested--though charged with unlawfully
copying material, not spying--and imprisoned.</TE>
<TE>   In September 2000, he pleaded guilty to a single count of
downloading data to computer tape. He has said he made copies to
protect data from being erased.</TE>
<TE>   The government dropped 58 other counts, and U.S. District Judge
James Parker apologized to Lee, saying the Justice and Energy
departments had "embarrassed our entire nation and each of us who is
a citizen of it" by the way they handled the case.</TE>
<TE>   Lee's case raised the specter of a stereotype that runs throughout
Asian American history, "of being the foreigner, not necessarily
being trusted," Narasaki said.</TE>
<TE>   The 51-year-old Chang met Lee when she was living in New Mexico
more than 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Though she is a friend of the family, her advocacy work is not
directed by the Lees. Aside from a brief tour for his book, "My
Country Versus Me," Lee himself has stayed out of the public eye.</TE>
<TE>   He spends his days at home in Los Alamos, N.M., fishing, cooking,
writing and looking for another job in private industry or at a
university.</TE>

<HD>Monroe Nude Photos Back on the Market</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The so-called "Red Velvet" series of nude photographs of Marilyn
Monroe is back on the market.</LD>
<LD>   After several failed attempts to sell the series that helped
rocket Monroe to stardom, Ventura photographer Tom Kelley said this
week that he is once again seeking a buyer for the images of Monroe
lounging against a red velvet curtain.</LD>
<LD>   The offer includes the six pictures shot in 1949 by Kelley's
father, Tom Kelley Sr., that produced the centerfold for Playboy
magazine's inaugural issue. It also includes the intellectual
property rights--negatives, copyrights and Monroe's signed model's
release--that will allow the buyer to use the images for trade and
advertising purposes. In a move that generated international
attention, Butterfields Auctioneers in Hollywood and its then-parent
company, Ebay Inc., simultaneously put the images and rights on the
auction block in March 2001.</LD>
<TE>   As a collection, the photos fetched $475,000, an offer rejected as
too low. Offered individually, the photos drew bids totaling
$840,000, still below a minimum price set by Kelley of $1.25 million.</TE>
<TE>   No sale was made, and the photographs remained in Kelley's
possession.</TE>
<TE>   Then, this past March, Kelley and his agent Gary Saal found a
private buyer for the collection.</TE>
<TE>   But that deal recently fell through, prompting a lawsuit to be
filed on behalf of Tom Kelley Studios alleging beach of contract.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Forecasters were expecting good news from Tropical Storm Hanna, which
could bring much-needed rain to the parched Southeast with little
risk of damage.</LD>
<LD>   The storm formed out of a tropical depression in the Gulf of
Mexico and was expected to make landfall today along the northern
Gulf Coast.</LD>
<LD>   It was expected to reach shore anywhere from the mouth of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, and once
over land to turn northeast into Alabama and Georgia, said Jack
Beven, a forecaster with the National Hurricane Center in Miami.</LD>
<TE>   The storm had sustained winds of near 45 mph. It was expected to
strengthen but not reach hurricane intensity--74 mph or
greater--before hitting land.</TE>
<TE>   Hanna could bring 4 to 8 inches of rain, with isolated tornadoes
possible, Beven said. A storm surge of 2 to 4 feet was predicted, and
warnings or watches were posted in the Gulf from Grand Isle, La., to
the Suwanee River in Florida.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge in Pittsburgh freed the city's Police Department from almost
all the federal oversight that was imposed in 1997 because of abuses
against residents.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Robert Cindrich decided that only the city
Office of Municipal Investigations will remain under federal
oversight. The office investigates citizen complaints.</LD>
<LD>   The city and the U.S. Justice Department jointly sought to end the
monitoring last month, saying improvements have been made.</LD>
<TE>   "There is general recognition that this Police Department has
built a model system that is being replicated across the country,"
Mayor Tom Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   The American Civil Liberties Union argued on behalf of community
and civil rights groups that oversight should continue. Activists
cited problems in the investigation office, including a backlog of
300 cases.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Stevens, president of the local chapter of the National Assn.
for the Advancement of Colored People, pointed to the backlog as
evidence that further reform is needed. "If you have a disease in
your body, you have to eliminate all of the disease before you are
given a clean bill of health."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge ended more than 40 years of court-supervised desegregation in
Little Rock's schools, closing a chapter in a battle over integration
that began in the 1950s.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge William Wilson's ruling came in response to
Little Rock's claims that it has met the terms of a 1998
desegregation plan to improve the performance of minority students.</LD>
<LD>   A group representing black students sued the state's largest
district in 1982, alleging that it discriminated against minorities
by failing to give them a quality education.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit prompted the court to continue desegregation
monitoring that began in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said he will still monitor the district's efforts to
improve the performance of black students, saying it hadn't proved it
was effectively tracking those students.</TE>

<LD>   An investigation into the Sept. 2 shooting found that Greg Siem

<TE>   The stun guns used by Rochester police look like handguns. They
use an electric shock to temporarily incapacitate a person.</TE>
<TE>   Atak, a refugee from civil war in Sudan, was drunk and acting

<HD>$335 Million to Test Rape DNA OKd in Senate Bill</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Senate has approved a bill that would provide $335 million to
state and local laboratories to analyze DNA evidence in unsolved rape
cases, potentially identifying or clearing suspects in hundreds of
thousands of sexual assault cases.</LD>
<LD>   The bill is aimed at reducing a backlog of as many as 500,000
untested rape kits, where DNA and evidence from a victim or crime
scene is collected and labeled.</LD>
<LD>   The bill would spend as much as $275 million over five years to
allow laboratories to analyze DNA evidence. An additional $50 million
would be authorized to improve training for collection and handling
of such evidence; $10 million would be used to build a databank of
samples collected from felons.</LD>
<TE>   A 1999 government report found at least 180,000 untested rape kits
around the nation. That total has since grown to an estimated
500,000, lawmakers say.</TE>

<HD>Islamic Charity Cleared in Perjury</HD>
<DH>Courts: Charges were dropped against Chicago group accused
of lying about ties to Bin Laden.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>A federal judge dismissed charges Friday against an Islamic charity
accused of lying about its ties to Osama bin Laden, saying the
perjury law didn't apply in this case.</LD>
<LD>   Federal agents raided Benevolence International Foundation's
suburban Chicago headquarters last December, and its bank accounts
were frozen by the U.S. Treasury Department.</LD>
<LD>   The charity and its executive director, Enaam Arnaout, were
charged a few months later with perjury based on affidavits in a
civil lawsuit in which Arnaout denied the group funds terrorism or
military activity. The lawsuit was brought by Benevolence against the
federal government and sought release of the group's funds.</LD>
<TE>   But in her decision, U.S. District Judge Joan Gottschall said the
Supreme Court has ruled the perjury law does not apply to such
affidavits. She said perjury charges may have been appropriate if
false statements were in a deposition.</TE>
<TE>   "We respectfully disagree with the judge's ruling," U.S. Atty.
Patrick Fitzgerald said in a statement. "The opinion relies on a
technical interpretation of the perjury statute and has no bearing on
the facts of the case."</TE>
<TE>   Fitzgerald said prosecutors planned to file a new criminal
complaint charging the defendants with obstruction of justice and
making false statements for the same alleged conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Benevolence attorney Matthew Piers said Gottschall's decision was
"the product of a courageous jurist."</TE>
<TE>   The 39-year-old, Syrian-born Arnaout, who has been jailed since
April, acknowledges that he has met Bin Laden but has denied having
anything to do with terrorism. The U.S. attorney's office said
Arnaout was expected to remain in custody over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing in the case was scheduled for Monday before Gottschall.</TE>
<TE>   Freezing the assets of Benevolence and another Chicago-area
Islamic charity, Global Relief Foundation, were among the most
visible actions of the federal government's effort to shut off the
flow of dollars to terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Both groups deny they provide any support to terrorists.</TE>

<HD>Cheney's Pacemaker Shows No Trouble Signs, His Doctors Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>By a Times staff writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Doctors who examined Vice President Dick Cheney on Friday reported
that the vice president's implanted defibrillator-pacemaker was
functioning properly and had not been activated to treat an abnormal
heartbeat.</LD>
<LD>   The 61-year-old vice president, who has had four heart attacks
since 1978, underwent a semiannual cardiovascular exam. His
counselor, Mary Matalin, said Cheney's doctor, Jonathan Reiner,
reported Cheney could "continue to live a vigorous lifestyle."</LD>
<LD>   Matalin said Reiner found that the device "continues to function
flawlessly and has not detected nor treated any arrhythmia."</LD>
<TE>   The device, the size of a pager, was implanted in June 2001 after
doctors determined that Cheney was at risk of developing a
potentially fatal irregular heartbeat. It monitors the heartbeat and
can send an electric pulse to correct an abnormal rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors use external devices to monitor the device's performance
and to determine whether it was activated.</TE>
<TE>   Matalin also said Cheney was given an electrocardiogram and an
echocardiogram to check the condition of his vascular system. The
exams showed no sign he had developed additional cardiovascular
problems, she said.</TE>

<HD>Denver Storm Halts Rush Hour Traffic</HD>
<DH>Weather: Heavy rain flooded a highway construction zone,
closing Interstate 25, stranding motorists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>A 30-minute torrent dropped more than an inch of rain Friday
afternoon, flooding Interstate 25 with waist-deep water and backing
up traffic during rush hour.</LD>
<LD>   Rescue crews in life jackets pushed rafts through the flood to
rescue people from stranded cars. A snow plow pushed water toward
storm drains.</LD>
<LD>   The interstate was closed in both directions and was not expected
to reopen for hours.</LD>
<TE>   Several cars were nearly submerged and at least one was adrift.
Tow trucks pulled others out of the muddy waters.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the flooding occurred in a construction zone where the
heavily traveled highway is being widened. Embankments stripped bare
for the project apparently eroded in the heavy rain.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got pumps going right now," Colorado Department of
Transportation spokeswoman Stacey Stegman said.</TE>
<TE>   "In any case like this, we try to get hold of as many pumps as we
can to keep the highway open, but when we get such a tremendous
amount of water in such a short time, there's nothing we can do to
stay on top of it."</TE>
<TE>   She said there were weather-related problems on other highways
around the Denver metro area, but none as significant as the flooding
on Interstate 25.</TE>
<TE>   The National Weather Service said at least 1.2 inches of rain fell
over parts of Denver in 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Water at least a foot deep flowed past shops on Broadway, south of
the interstate. George Hawpe of Foxy's Antiques put a board across
his door to keep water out.</TE>

<HD>Florida Says No to a Recount but Will Review Polls</HD>
<DH>Election: Down by 8,196 votes, Janet Reno wanted another
tally in primary race. With new machines in place, some precincts
showed zero turnout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Janet Reno asked for a statewide recount Friday of every vote in
Florida's botched primary and was promptly turned down by the state
election board. Florida's secretary of state, however, said counties
could continue to look for votes not tallied that could erase Bill
McBride's lead in the Democratic race for governor.</LD>
<LD>   Secretary of State Jim Smith said there would be no recounts under
any circumstances, but newly found votes could be submitted by
counties with their updated totals for final certification next week.</LD>
<LD>   "Whatever those totals are at that time, will, at that time,
determine who the winner of the gubernatorial primary is," Smith
said.</LD>
<TE>   That means Reno needs a clear victory when final results come in
Tuesday. After Wednesday, candidates have 10 days to challenge the
results in court.</TE>
<TE>   The unofficial count, released Thursday, showed Reno trailing
McBride by 8,196 votes, a margin greater than the one-half percentage
point needed to force an automatic recount in the race to take on
freshman Republican Gov. Jeb Bush this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Reno has said she doesn't want to challenge the results in court,
and Alan Greer, her campaign attorney, all but ruled out a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Political newcomer McBride declared victory Thursday after the
unofficial count was released. Reno, President Clinton's attorney
general, refused to concede, saying there were discrepancies in at
least 80 Miami-Dade County precincts and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Using Reno's list of questionable precincts and factoring in
Miami-Dade's voter turnout of 32.7%, as many as 8,000 votes could
have been missed, according to a computer analysis by Associated
Press.</TE>
<TE>   Because Reno won about 70% of the Miami-Dade vote, she presumably
could pick up votes there and narrow the gap.</TE>
<TE>   Miami-Dade officials said they would not release details about
their vote review until Tuesday, the state deadline. They are
examining machines from the whole county, including those where Reno
workers questioned shockingly low turnouts.</TE>
<TE>   In one precinct, computers registered 900% more votes than there
were eligible voters, while no votes were recorded in precincts with
thousands of voters.</TE>
<TE>   Miami-Dade County election chief David Leahy has said workers
examined four polling stations that originally showed a total of 96
votes. The review boosted the total to 1,914 votes, although
officials didn't say which candidate gained.</TE>
<TE>   The delay reminds many here of the five weeks it took to decide
the 2000 presidential election in the state. Florida and counties
spent millions of dollars on new technology to prevent a repeat of
the paper-ballot debacle, but the computers caused new difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   Maurice Cason said she voted for Reno at Miami's Shadowlawn
Elementary School in the Little Haiti neighborhood and watched from
her nearby home as hundreds of others streamed to the polls. The
precinct has 1,416 registered Democrats, yet county officials
recorded no votes there.</TE>
<TE>   "I always used to say my little vote didn't count," said Cason,
76. "The last time in the presidential mess, I don't see where I
counted then. This is the second time we've had this mess."</TE>
<TE>   County officials have complained about a lack of training for poll
workers on the new machines. Dorothy Walton, precinct clerk in
Miami's Liberty City area, said she only got three hours of
instruction.</TE>
<TE>   In her precinct, which has 1,406 registered Democrats, the
machines initially recorded only 87 votes. Later Wednesday, election
officials raised that total to 610 after checking the machines.</TE>
<TE>   The 80 precincts targeted by Reno reported a total of 1,952 votes
cast. But those precincts had 31,375 registered Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   If those precincts matched the countywide turnout, they would have
produced 10,260 votes, more than five times what was reported,
according to an AP analysis.</TE>

<HD>ImClone Executives Sought 2 Shredders, Papers Show</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: SEC requested company documents a day after e-mail
asking for equipment went out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Samuel and Harlan Waksal, the two brothers who ran ImClone Systems
Inc., ordered shredders for the company's executive offices the day
before the Securities and Exchange Commission requested corporate
records in January, according to documents turned over to a
congressional panel Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The documents do not show when the shredders arrived or whether
the brothers shredded material requested by federal or congressional
investigators. In a letter to the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce, Harlan Waksal, who is now ImClone's chief executive, said
it was "not clear" whether his brother had destroyed relevant
material, but implied that he had not done so himself.</LD>
<LD>   The information sheds fresh light on the climate at ImClone in
January, as the New York biotechnology company was beset by questions
about its cancer drug, Erbitux, which the Food and Drug
Administration had rejected a few days earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators previously said they suspected Samuel Waksal of
ordering computer files to be deleted and of shredding documents in
an attempt to disguise improper activities, including insider
trading.</TE>
<TE>   Formerly chief executive, Samuel Waksal left the company in May
and subsequently was indicted on charges of insider trading. His
younger brother, Harlan, succeeded him and has not been charged with
a crime. The company has sued Samuel Waksal since his indictment,
saying he breached his duty to shareholders by destroying the
records.</TE>
<TE>   A source with knowledge of the case said an SEC attorney left a
phone message Jan. 3 for Samuel Waksal. On Jan. 7, a Waksal aide sent
an e-mail to another aide, the documents show. "Sam needs a paper
shredder," the e-mail read. "He wants it for his office." An aide for
Harlan Waksal added an addendum later that day: "Can you please order
2. Tnx."</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Jan. 8, the company received an "informal request"
for records from the SEC, documents show. The company did not get its
first subpoena--from the Justice Department--until Jan. 24, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to House investigators, ImClone attorneys said Harlan
Waksal signed a purchase order for the shredders without paying
attention to its content.</TE>
<TE>   The letter said that the shredders eventually were placed in
Samuel Waksal's office and in a conference room near his brother's
office.</TE>

<HD>Florida Is Gripped by Terrorist Scare</HD>
<DH>Tension: Comment sets off a massive police response. It's
the latest unsettling incident in U.S. in a week marked by a high
state of alert.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG and STEPHEN BRAUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>THE EVERGLADES, Fla.</DL>
<LD>An overheard comment in a Georgia coffee shop sparked a massive
law-enforcement response in southern Florida on Friday, shutting down
a major highway for most of the day while authorities questioned
three men and searched their cars for explosives.</LD>
<LD>   By day's end, no munitions were found, the men were released and a
jittery nation eased after the latest in a series of suspected
terrorist sightings proved to be false alarms during a week lived
under a state of high alert.</LD>
<LD>   From tense first moments to anti-climactic finale, the Florida
episode played out all day on cable news channels--the culmination of
a weeklong string of incidents involving Arab Americans and other
minorities caught up in the spiraling tensions of the anniversary of
the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The incidents diverted airborne passenger jets, emptied airport
terminals and left Arab Americans fuming about overreactions by
police and concerned citizens--a vivid example of the civil rights
perils complicating the effort to heighten homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   The Florida case was sparked Thursday by a nurse who told police
she heard the three men at a Calhoun, Ga., coffee shop vowing to
"make America cry," and provided descriptions and license plate
numbers. Following an alert from Georgia authorities, the men were
stopped late Thursday night a few miles east of Naples on Interstate
75, a remote section of highway known as Alligator Alley.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly 13 hours, teams of federal and Florida law enforcement
authorities held the three men--two Arab Americans and a foreign
student--under guard in a police van on the highway. Automated robots
and demolition experts in padded, fire-retardant suits spent hours
combing two cars for traces of munitions until officials finally
acknowledged the men were not terrorists, but medical students
driving south for a training session.</TE>
<TE>   Charges Possible</TE>
<TE>   At dusk, the men were released and drove east along the Everglades
highway toward Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Unamused police officials said the men could still be charged in
Georgia for concocting a prank that led nurse Eunice Stone to report
them as terrorism plotters. "If this is a hoax, they will be
charged," said Collier County Sheriff Don Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   The men denied they had said anything that could be construed as a
threat.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, government officials said they have been prudent in
moving quickly to investigate what they perceived initially as
legitimate threats--even when they ultimately turn out to be
harmless.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI and law enforcement authorities receive tips from the
public, and it is our obligation to follow up and respond to them,"
said an FBI official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "I think
the American public is glad to see that we respond in these
situations and take them seriously."</TE>
<TE>   But officials were accused of recklessness and abusing the civil
liberties of citizens by the Illinois relatives of one of the Arab
American students held in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a caring person, he wouldn't hurt an ant!" cried Laila
Gheith, whose son, Ayman, was stopped by county police and state
troopers early Friday. "We are Americans!" During a news conference
in the Chicago suburb of Palos Hills, a family friend, Sabri Samirah,
insisted that "we are being discriminated [against] by the
government."</TE>
<TE>   It was a complaint echoed Friday by a lawyer for an Indian
immigrant now being held in Fort Smith, Ark., on federal charges
after a passenger jet was diverted there two days earlier on its way
to Las Vegas. The attorney, Matt Ketcham, said his client was the
victim of "a horrible overreaction on the part of the government."</TE>
<TE>   Ketcham said Gurdeep Wander, a naturalized citizen, and Harinder
P. Singh, a legal immigrant, face federal charges of interfering with
a flight crew after they were hustled off a plane from Memphis on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   A flight attendant, worried when both men went into a bathroom
with a razor and began shaving, notified the pilot. When the two men
failed to return to their seats, the pilot aborted the flight. It was
one of several incidents on airlines Sept. 11 that ended without
terrorism-related arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Misunderstandings Cited</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney in Fort Smith, Tom Gean, said Friday that the
government will not tolerate misconduct aboard airliners. But
Transportation Department officials in Washington acknowledged that
the Arkansas air incident grew from a series of escalating
misunderstandings.</TE>
<TE>   "It was Sept. 11 and people were very concerned about flying,"
said one official, who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the tricky business of divining and stemming terror
threats in the making is sometimes hobbled by errors and
communication breakdowns, law enforcement officials in Florida were
unapologetic about their own quick reactions Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Notwithstanding whether it was done in jest or if it was done on
purpose, the result was the same," said Tim Moore, commissioner of
the Florida Dept. of Law Enforcement. "Floridians were in a state of
alert and we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   The first hint of trouble came Thursday morning, when Stone
reported to Georgia authorities about three men she overheard talking
in a Shoney's restaurant along the highway in Calhoun.</TE>
<TE>   While eating breakfast with her son, Stone told police she heard
ominous snatches of conversation from the laughing men, seated at a
nearby table. "It really scared me," Stone later told Fox News. She
had heard the men say, "They think they were sad on 9/11, wait until
9/13." And: "Do you think we have enough to bring it down?"</TE>
<TE>   When the men left in two cars, Stone jotted down their tags and
called Georgia authorities, who quickly issued an alert. At midnight,
a Collier County deputy posted at the western end of Interstate 75
saw one of the cars, a white Acura, drive through the toll booth
without paying. The deputy pursued the car, stopping it without
incident eight miles down Alligator Alley, an asphalt ribbon cutting
east-west across the wild, cypress-studded sloughs of the Everglades
between Naples and Ft. Lauderdale. The second car, a black Honda
Prelude, soon pulled up behind and the deputy called for backup,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, sheriff's departments from four counties were
notified--a complement of law enforcement that soon included three
state task forces, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said three men they declined to identify were moved
from the cars and placed in a van, where they were given food and
water, and questioned.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Tina Osceola said the first
conversations with the men "didn't go well. Their stories weren't the
same, didn't corroborate and weren't consistent, which creates
problems for us."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities' suspicions were further aroused when a bomb-sniffing
dog reacted to the presence of explosives in both vehicles. The cars
were emptied of the students' baggage and other belongings and a
suspicious backpack was destroyed by a high-pressure stream from a
water cannon.</TE>
<TE>   The drawn-out affair forced authorities to shut down the entire
highway, but officials said the possibility of a terrorist plot
justified their caution.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a very significant drill, if you will," said Hunter.
"You'll recall we were on heightened alert for the entire week." He
added that Stone "did exactly what we ask citizens to do. If you're
suspicious about a situation, we too are going to be suspicious. Let
us check it out."</TE>
<TE>   But Hana Gheith, Ayman's sister, said she had been planning to
join her brother for medical training at Larkin Community Hospital in
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if she's credible," Gheith said. "For the government
and the media to jump to conclusions like this; three families have
been affected by this."</TE>
<TE>   Less than an hour after the Gheiths went public with their
grievances, Ayman and his two fellow students were free, back on the
road to Miami. Pausing at a highway rest stop, the men were besieged
by news crews.</TE>
<TE>   One of the students, clad in a skull cap, denied they had joked
about Sept. 11 or a terrorist plot in Stone's presence.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously not," said the student, who declined to give his name.
"We were talking about our new semester going to school in Miami, on
our way to school. She saw the way I was dressed; maybe she put a
little salt and pepper in her story."</TE>

<HD>Mudslides Damage Homes in Utah; No One Is Injured</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANTAQUIN, Utah</DL>
<LD>People chased from their homes by mudslides surveyed the mess Friday:
cars scattered, power knocked out and about three dozen homes damaged
by mud 7 feet deep in places.</LD>
<LD>   The mudslides Thursday night caused $2 million to $5 million in
damage, but no one was injured and all of the roughly 50 homes
evacuated were still standing.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought the mountain was pretty solid," said Matt Gurr, whose
home has a hole in its back wall punched through by a chunk of Dry
Mountain.</LD>
<TE>   "You just don't think it's going to happen to you," said Gurr's
wife, Paula.</TE>
<TE>   The slides in Santaquin, about 60 miles south of Salt Lake City,
followed a week of wet weather in drought-stricken Utah.</TE>
<TE>   The city spent thousands of dollars reseeding Dry Mountain after a
wildfire last year left it bare of vegetation, which helps hold soil
in place. The drought may have prevented the seeds from taking root.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest slide was perhaps 500 yards across and caused most of
the damage. Another slide as wide as 300 feet blocked a canal east of
Santaquin and caused more flooding, Utah County sheriff's Sgt. Yvette
Rice said.</TE>

<HD>Hearing for Gov. Bush's Daughter Is Postponed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A court hearing scheduled Friday for Noelle Bush, the daughter of
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and a niece of President Bush, was postponed so
police can finish investigating a report that she had crack cocaine
in her possession while in a drug treatment facility.</LD>
<LD>   Bush, 25, has had several brushes with the law this year
concerning drugs and is serving a mandatory term at a rehabilitation
center here.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday a resident at the facility tipped police that officials
at the Center for Drug Free Living had found a rock of crack cocaine
in Bush's shoe.</LD>
<TE>   Police investigated, but a supervisor at the agency told employees
not to cooperate, according to a police report. One employee then
ripped up a sworn statement she had been writing.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they gathered the torn bits of the statement and have
held it as evidence, but since the statement was not completed or
signed, they lacked probable cause to arrest Bush, and the matter
remains under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Upon the conclusion of the criminal investigation, this court
will immediately schedule a status hearing to address the alleged
violation, and at that time will impose any sanction that is
warranted," Florida Judge Reginald Whitehead said in an order
released Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Whitehead sent Bush to jail for three days in July after she
violated the terms of a drug treatment program.</TE>
<TE>   The treatment was ordered after she was arrested in the capital,
Tallahassee, in January for allegedly trying to buy the anti-anxiety
drug Xanax using a false prescription.</TE>
<TE>   If Bush is removed from the program, she could face prosecution on
that charge, which carries a sentence of as much as five years in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Possession of cocaine, a felony, carries the same possible
sentence.</TE>

<HD>FAA Orders Check of 737s' Flight Control</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The federal government ordered inspections Saturday of Boeing 737s
flying worldwide to see if any have potentially defective flight
control modules that could make the planes hard to control. The
emergency order by the Federal Aviation Administration gives airlines
10 days to complete the review.</LD>
<LD>   Each plane has two modules that control hydraulic fluid to the
flight control system. A failure of both modules could significantly
affect the system, making the planes sluggish to nearly impossible to
operate, according to FAA spokesman Paul Takemoto.</LD>
<LD>   The FAA said it's looking for a recent batch of modules that has a
high rate of failure. Fifteen modules were found to be defective,
four while in flight, 11 during inspections on the ground. None
caused an accident, Takemoto said.</LD>
<TE>   There are 84 foreign aircraft with the modules from the bad batch
and nine U.S. 737s, he said.</TE>

<HD>EPA Backs Off Snowmobile Pollution Rules</HD>
<DH>Environment: Makers get two more years, until 2012, to hit
emission reduction goals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Responding to pressure from the White House and from manufacturers,
the Environmental Protection Agency will give snowmobile makers more
time to reduce pollution under federal regulations released Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The emissions standards for snowmobiles and other primarily
gasoline-burning recreational and industrial engines were released in
response to a court order. They represented the first air pollution
rules the Bush administration has developed and completed.</LD>
<LD>   EPA officials stressed that the new standards are important
because, when they are in full force, they will reduce pollution by 2
million tons a year, equivalent to taking 32 million cars, or 15% of
today's traffic, off the road.</LD>
<TE>   "When fully implemented, this action will not only protect public
health but will help restore the view of our nation's treasured
scenic parks and wilderness areas," EPA administrator Christie
Whitman said.</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists blasted the administration for weakening
what they considered an already lax rule proposed by the EPA a year
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "EPA is squandering an important and highly cost-effective
opportunity to cut harmful air pollutants from these very dirty
engines," said Vicki Patton, a senior attorney for Environmental
Defense Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with the EPA's initial proposal, the final rule will give
snowmobile makers two additional years, until 2012, to achieve the
reduction targets. It also gives them more flexibility in how much of
each pollutant they reduce.</TE>
<TE>   EPA spokesman Joe Martyak said the changes were made after hearing
from snowmobile makers that "it would have been difficult for them to
achieve those reductions in some of their engines in that time
frame."</TE>
<TE>   The only other change made in the rule was to the emissions
standard for all-terrain vehicles. They will be allowed to emit 50%
more pollution under the final rule than they would have been under
the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists were particularly concerned about the rules for
snowmobiles, which are responsible for a large percentage of the air
pollution in some national parks and forests. The Bush administration
already rejected a Clinton administration policy to ban them in
Yellowstone and Grand Tetons national parks. The Bush administration
does plan to limit the use of snowmobiles in those parks, and that
policy is expected to be completed this fall.</TE>
<TE>   A group that represents enthusiasts of snowmobiles and other
recreational vehicles cheered the administration's new standards.</TE>
<TE>   "EPA has been responsive to industries' concerns about the
standards being reasonable and achievable," said Bill Dart, public
lands director of the Blue Ribbon Coalition, a national group of
motorized recreational enthusiasts.</TE>
<TE>   Snowmobilers praised the administration for setting emissions
standards without telling the industry what kind of technology to
use. The manufacturers and snowmobilers are eager to keep the popular
two-stroke engines, which power most snow machines.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pleased they are talking about using standards rather than
dictating technologies," Dart said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists were appalled that such engines will be legal
for many years even though cleaner-burning four-stroke engines, which
require more piston strokes per fuel cycle, already are made by all
four major manufacturers. They said the new regulations defy the 1990
Clean Air Act, which commanded the EPA to set standards that result
in "the greatest degree of emissions reduction achievable," taking
cost into consideration.</TE>
<TE>   "Dirty, noisy two-strokes are the most polluting engines on the
planet, so frankly, we're shocked that the Bush administration plans
to allow them in new snowmobiles for at least another decade," said
Russell Long, executive director of Bluewater Network, a national
environmental group. California regulates some of the vehicles
targeted by these new standards but has been prevented by law from
regulating others. EPA officials said their new standards will be
tougher than the state's rules.</TE>
<TE>   State officials did not have time to analyze the new rules. But
California air-quality officials were pleased that the EPA had
produced the standards, which were ordered by Congress 12 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been urging the federal government to set emissions
[standards] for what we cannot control," said Jerry Martin, spokesman
of the California Air Resources Board.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA engaged in an extensive cost-benefit analysis after its
initial proposal was criticized by John Graham, the White House
Office of Management and Budget's chief regulatory official. He took
aim at the proposal for failing to measure the benefits of the
engines now available.</TE>
<TE>   "A mediocre proposal has been made even weaker by John Graham's
influence," said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air
Trust, a bipartisan group that fights to reduce air pollution.
"Unfortunately, it may send a chilling signal to the staff at EPA for
future rules."</TE>

investigating and detaining people, sometimes without charges, as
part of its war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Some marchers challenged President Bush's assertion that the war
effort is aimed at terrorists, not Muslims. One protester carried a
sign that accused Bush of "targeting one billion Muslims."</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, leaning on crutches after foot surgery,
said there could be election day consequences for the White House
policy.</LD>
<TE>   "We march in September, we register in October and we remember in
November," he told the crowd of several hundred.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has said that detaining suspects without
naming them publicly--even without formally charging them--is key to
preventing more terrorist attacks like on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   James J. Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, said the
policy has led to "massive racial profiling" and the disappearance of
people of Middle Eastern descent.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not know their names," he said of some detainees. "We do
not know where they are."</TE>
<TE>   Civil libertarians said the administration's policy tramples
constitutional protections.</TE>
<TE>   "... No matter what he [John Ashcroft] says, we're the true
patriots," said Kim Gandy, president of the National Organization for
Women.</TE>

<DL>NEWARK, N.J.</DL>
<LD>A ship ordered offshore for testing after radioactivity was detected
in a container was cleared to return to port, federal officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Inspectors determined Friday there was no threat from the M/V
Palermo Senator, a 708-foot container ship registered in Liberia,
according to a statement from the FBI, Coast Guard and Department of
Energy.</LD>
<LD>   The Coast Guard ordered the ship into the Elizabeth, N.J., port
Tuesday for an inspection after hearing suspicious sounds during a
routine boarding offshore.</LD>
<TE>   Later that day, the ship was ordered out to sea after
radioactivity was detected among its 650 shipping containers. It
remained in a security zone six miles offshore.</TE>
<TE>   The low-level radioactivity came from ceramic tile in the cargo
and was harmless, the agencies said.</TE>

<HD>Skateboarding Whiz Kid Flips and Flies Despite Size</HD>
<DH>Sport: Mitchie Brusco, age 5, is poised beyond his years
and already has a board named for him. And he still rides in a car
booster seat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KIRKLAND, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Zooming by in baggy shorts and tattoos, the skateboarders sail over
ramps, railings and stairs, stopping only to chug energy drinks from
wide-mouthed bottles.</LD>
<LD>   Then there is Mitchie Brusco, the kid known as Little Tricky.</LD>
<LD>   He quenches his thirst by drinking orange juice his mommy poured
into a plastic cup with a built-in spout and a screw-on lid so he
can't spill it.</LD>
<TE>   Just 5 years old, Mitchie still rides in a booster seat in his
family's minivan and shares a bedroom with his 3-year-old sister,
Colie. His helmet is plastered with photographs of his sisters,
brothers and smiling grandfather, and when he takes it off, his ears
pop out like the doors on a taxicab.</TE>
<TE>   But at skate parks nationwide, where loud music and teenage
bravado reign, Mitchie has staked out his turf as a rising star of
the rebel sport. He can turn his board 180 degrees underneath him,
careen up steep ramps and shimmy down rails with a set of wheels on
either side. And all without a wobble.</TE>
<TE>   His poise already has caught the attention of competition
organizers, corporate sponsors and an agent looking for the sport's
next "it" boy to replace aging pros such as 29-year-old Andy
MacDonald.</TE>
<TE>   "He's 5, and he competes in the '8 and under' groups," said
Mitchie's mother, Jennifer, on a recent morning at their home in this
Seattle suburb. "He's the best in that group, and he's the youngest."</TE>
<TE>   "No, I'm not," Mitchie piped up. "There's a 6-year-old."</TE>
<TE>   "Six is older than 5," she reminded him with a smile and a rub on
his back.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yeah! But he's smaller. Mom?" he asked, jumping off the couch
and planting his feet by a door frame marked with heights and ages of
the family's five children. "Can you measure me?"</TE>
<TE>   At 43 inches tall and 43 pounds, the boy with the big brown eyes
and fine hair buzzed into an impish crew cut came across the radar of
Patty Seder during a June competition. As president of the 300-member
Pacific Northwest Amateur Skateboard League, Seder sees good
skateboarders all day long. But Mitchie stood out.</TE>
<TE>   "He's totally calm and focused, which is unusual at that age. I
was mowed down. He was fearless, even though he was much younger than
the kids he was skating against," she said. "It also helps that I
don't see parental pushing."</TE>
<TE>   In a sport whose half brother, snowboarding, was recognized as an
Olympic event at the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan, the potential
visibility of top-ranking skateboarders is huge.</TE>
<TE>   "They're really tandem sports, and I wouldn't be surprised if
skateboarding was eventually in the Olympics," Seder said.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchie already has made such a name for himself that when he
ventured onto a snowboard for the first time last winter, it was
given to him by manufacturer World Industries.</TE>
<TE>   "He's too young for the snowboarding camps," Jennifer Brusco said,
"but that's definitely a sport we're going to get more into this
winter." She is a former professional baseball player for the
Colorado Silver Bullets who is now a stay-at-home mom, and her
husband, Mick, works in sales in the lumber industry.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Mitchie's skateboarding prowess drew the family to
Cleveland, where he competed in the Gravity Games, a professional and
amateur contest for the daredevils of street athletics. To qualify,
Mitchie beat out every skateboarder in the country younger than 8 and
then got lucky enough to be selected from a raffle of other winners
in the Northwest League.</TE>
<TE>   He finished 13th out of 14 amateur contestants, but he was
competing against kids who were 12 or older.</TE>
<TE>   "He's by far the youngest person to compete," said Wade Martin,
executive director of the Gravity Games, which will be broadcast on
NBC this fall. The youngest skateboarder last year was almost 12.</TE>
<TE>   "It's way too hard to tell what kind of future Mitchie has when
he's 5 years old, but he's one of the best skaters in his age group
that anyone's ever seen," Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   Competitively, skateboarding is an inexact science that requires
charisma as well as technical merit to impress the three judges. Each
athlete performs alone for two runs of 45 seconds each, and the lower
of those scores is thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   "Before each competition, he prays for the safety of the other
skaters," said Jennifer Brusco, adding that she and her husband do as
well. The risk of broken wrists or worse doesn't preoccupy her. With
five kids from 3 to 12, she said worrying about every child's
athletic events is simply a time drain.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Mitchie's parents spend their time making home movies of
his pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   "I like this one because it shows his tenacity," Jennifer Brusco
said, holding the remote control as a video shows Mitchie jumping off
a flight of stairs and trying to land solidly on his board. He
finally does, after falling five times. "It shows that he really
loves to do this, and we're not making him."</TE>
<TE>   And, by all appearances, they're not.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, Mitchie, Colie and a friend piled into the
minivan with mom for a day at the park. On the way, Mitchie hummed
the song "All Star" from his favorite movie, "Shrek." It was the
first week of school, and while that meant the skate park wasn't
crowded, it also meant it was less fun for Mitchie--less camaraderie,
smaller audience.</TE>
<TE>   After about 10 minutes of sailing up ramps and asking his mom to
watch, he cruised over to the jungle gym to play with other kids his
age.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchie doesn't start kindergarten for another year, so the months
stretching ahead of him are filled with grape Popsicles,
skateboarding and church. Mitchie's family worships three times a
week at Cedar Park Assemblies of God in Bothell, and in August the
large congregation acquired a 10,000-square-foot wooden skateboarding
park from summer festival organizers who no longer wanted it. The
park has given rise to a weekly event that Pastor Joseph Fuiten calls
"skate church," which draws more than 100 kids and intertwines the
sport with prayer and song.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchie saw his first skateboard two years ago while shopping with
his mom. He fell in love, and from the moment she paid for it,
Mitchie never stopped carrying it, jumping on it, falling off it or
talking about it. That first board is still lying around the house,
even though one of its wheels is now missing.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Mitchie's nickname adorns a child-sized board sold by the
Skate Key, a Centralia, Wash., store owned by a family friend.
"Little Tricky" skateboards have a stop sign logo and measure 25.5
inches, 6 inches shorter than adult-sized boards. The store has sold
50 this year at $55.99 each.</TE>
<TE>   While lucrative corporate endorsements may be in Mitchie's future,
his parents drop a fair amount of money on travel and hotels for his
competitions, so they're grateful for corporate sponsors, such as
Termite and DC Shoes, that donate Mitchie's pads, helmets and shoes.</TE>
<TE>   The only drawback, Mitchie said, is that his black DC sneakers
don't have Velcro tighteners, only laces.</TE>
<TE>   "And I can't tie 'em yet."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The Georgia High School Assn. has approved a 14-year-old's use of a
prosthetic swim fin for competitive use. The device had been banned
from a league after complaints that it helped him swim faster.</LD>
<LD>   Hunter Scott of Roswell has a birth defect that kept his left leg
from growing to full size. It ends just above the knee.</LD>
<LD>   After the coach of an opposing team questioned the use of the
flipper in June, the DeKalb-Atlanta Swim and Diving league ruled it
violated guidelines that prohibit athletes from using artificial
devices in competition.</LD>
<TE>   But the state association, which governs high school athletics,
reaffirmed an earlier decision to let Hunter compete with the
specially designed fin if he makes the swim team at his school,
Woodward Academy.</TE>
<TE>   The swim league's 10 board members resigned after Hunter's father
threatened to sue. The lawsuit was never filed.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter said his improvement came from weightlifting and growth,
not from using the flipper.</TE>

<LD>Like a blooming rose, a nearby nebula glows pink and white in an
image released by scientists using the Hubble Space Telescope. The
nebula N11A looks flowerlike because of the glow from radiation of
massive stars at its heart, the European Space Agency said in a
statement. Visible in true color at hubble.esa.int, N11A lies in a
star-forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small companion
galaxy to the Milky Way galaxy, which contains Earth.</LD>
<LD>   This Hubble image, made on May 17, 2000, allows scientists to
identify the stars that make the nebula glow, which could help
astronomers learn more about the formation of massive stars, those
more than 10 times as massive as the sun. N11A is about 8 light-years
across and 168,000 light-years from Earth. A light-year is the
distance light travels in a year, about 6 trillion miles.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mice whose fur glows green may be the first step to using gene
therapy to treat hair loss, baldness and perhaps even to permanently
change hair color, researchers say. They put jellyfish genes into the
hair follicles of the mice, which grew fur that glowed fluorescent
green under the right light.</LD>
<LD>   "The hair now is glowing green because green fluorescent protein
is in the hair shaft," said Robert Hoffman of San Diego-based
AntiCancer Inc., whose company led the study. "We saw lots of green
fluorescent hair."</LD>
<LD>   Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,
Hoffman and his colleagues said their experiment involved skin taken
from a mouse, treated, and then grafted to another mouse. They need
to try it now directly on live mice.</LD>
<TE>   "It's got a way to go before the market," said Hoffman, who worked
with scientists at MIT and Japan's Kitasato University School of
Medicine.</TE>

<LD>A "wave" of 50,000 sports fans that sweeps around a stadium may be

popularization in Mexico City during the 1986 World Cup soccer
tournament, the action begins when fans stand and raise their arms in
succession, then quickly drop their arms as they sit down. The surge
of movement generally rolls across the crowd until it completes the
circle at least once.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers applied the same mathematical formulas used to gauge
the spread of forest fires to analyze how behaviors are amplified in
large crowds, said Tamas Vicsek, the lead researcher and a physicist
at the University of Budapest in Hungary. The study's suggestion that
a few fans' enthusiasm sways tens of thousands of people may be used
for crowd control, the researchers said.</LD>
<LD>   "In violent street incidents associated with demonstrations or
sporting events, it is essential to understand the conditions under
which small groups can gain control of the crowd," Vicsek and his
colleagues said.</LD>
<TE>   The researchers studied tapes of waves at 14 stadiums designed to
hold 50,000 or more people. A wave usually rolls clockwise at about
20 seats per second. At any given time, about 15 rows wide of people
are standing.</TE>

<HD>Neanderthal Remains Those of Woman, Child</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>

<LD>Archeologists have discovered the bones of a Neanderthal woman and
child in the German valley where the original Neanderthal Man was
found about 150 years ago. Neanderthals died out about 30,000 years
ago, and scientists say they are not direct ancestors of modern
humans. The species is named after a village near Dusseldorf where
the first Neanderthal remains were discovered in the summer of 1856.</LD>
<LD>   Archeologists said they had determined that arm bones and a milk
tooth found about two years ago were those of a woman and child who
lived about 40,000 years ago. "The arm bones probably belonged to a
woman. They are more fragile than those of the Neanderthal Man. And
the milk tooth is that of a 12-year-old child," said Gerd-Christian
Wen- iger, director of the Neanderthal Museum, where the remains are
displayed. Weniger said it was not certain whether the three
Neanderthals had lived at the same time. "They were all around about
40,000 years ago. But they could have lived a thousand years apart,"
he said.</LD>

<HD>Angels Refusing to Visit Old Haunts</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They continue to ignore ghosts of past
pennant-race collapses, beating Texas, 3-2, for 14th win in 15 games
and remaining tied for first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels are not only exorcising demons of Septembers past, they're
burying them and dancing on their graves nightly in a raging party
with no end in sight.</LD>
<LD>   The mood is festive these days at Edison Field for everyone except
the visitors, with the Texas Rangers being added to the list Friday
night in a 3-2 Angel victory before 35,345 that enabled Anaheim to
keep pace with the Oakland Athletics atop the American League West.</LD>
<LD>   Jarrod Washburn (18-5) continued the positive trend for the Angels
with his third consecutive victory, helping to reduce the club's
magic number to clinch a playoff spot to eight games while providing
a needed lift for himself after a trying week.</LD>
<TE>   The young ace was sharp in his first start since the Orange County
district attorney declined to file sexual assault charges against him
Wednesday. The left-hander gave up five hits--including Todd Greene's
eighth home run--and and two runs (one earned) in 7 1/3 solid
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia lifted Washburn after Ruben Rivera fouled
out on his 100th pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Fans responded with a standing ovation, prompting Washburn to
raise his cap high in appreciation..</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big, big lift for me," said Washburn, who with three
scheduled starts remaining could become the club's first 20-game
winner since Nolan Ryan in 1974. "I was a little anxious going into
this start, not knowing exactly how the fans were going to react, and
they answered it pretty quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was warming up before the game, I heard a lot of positive
comments and support, and they were outstanding the entire game. I
felt it was only appropriate to let 'em know how much I appreciated
it."</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 1-0, after the Rangers scored in the first with the help
of second baseman Adam Kennedy's 11th error, the Angels scored two
runs in the third on David Eckstein's sacrifice fly and Garret
Anderson's two-out single.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy atoned for his early miscue, first by walking and scoring
the first Angel run after advancing to third on a wild pitch and
passed ball, then giving the Angels a 3-1 lead with a two-out RBI
single in the fourth. He also singled in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   After relieving Washburn in the eighth, setup man Ben Weber made a
nifty play on pinch-hitter Todd Hollandsworth's line drive for the
second out in his team-leading 55th appearance. He then struck out
Michael Young to hold the Rangers in check with closer Troy Percival
getting ready.</TE>
<TE>   Percival had to earn his 38th save in 42 chances the hard way,
facing shortstop Alex Rodriguez (54 homers) to start the inning.
Rodriguez fouled out to third baseman Troy Glaus on Percival's first
pitch, Rafael Palmeiro (40 homers) popped out and Ivan Rodriguez
struck out to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels (92-55) won for the 14th time in 15 games, moving
within one victory of duplicating the franchise record for wins in a
season set during the 1982 run to the West division championship. The
Rangers (69-78) had their winning streak ended at four games as
starter Joaquin Benoit (3-4) gave up three runs in four innings.</TE>
<TE>   Fans did not boo when Washburn's name was announced in the opening
lineups, and there did not appear to be any backlash directed at him.</TE>
<TE>   He had been under investigation for 10 days and left the team to
be with his family Tuesday, when Anaheim police publicly confirmed
the investigation of the allegations. Washburn rejoined the club
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Holding to form this season, Washburn didn't disappoint in the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "Wash has shown that he can go out there and not take any
distractions or any baggage with him," said Scioscia, whose team is
29-17 in one-run games. "It was obviously a very emotional week for
him, and for all of us, and he went out there and ... he pitched. He
was strong all the way through it, and I think the way the crowd
reacted says it all."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Losing Control of Race</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Bullpen can't hold a 4-2 lead in seventh, and
Shuey walks in winning run for Rockies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The little things didn't seem so little to the Dodgers on Friday
night. An ill-advised dash to the plate, a grounder off the glove of
a pitcher, a bobble in the outfield, a couple of walks ... add them
up, and they amounted to a disappointing 5-4 loss to the Colorado
Rockies before 26,441 in Coors Field.</LD>
<LD>   Center fielder Marquis Grissom's error allowed the tying run to
score, and reliever Paul Shuey walked home the winning run, as the
Dodgers blew a two-run lead in the seventh inning and lost for the
sixth time in seven games. They also fell a game behind San Francisco
in the National League wild-card race with 15 games to go.</LD>
<LD>   "It's frustrating," said left fielder Brian Jordan, who hit a
two-run homer in the first inning. "The rookie [Kevin Beirne] threw a
great game, and to see it all fall apart in the seventh. ... We
battled against a good pitcher [Jason Jennings], we got the lead ...
you've got to hold on to win that game."</LD>
<TE>   Jordan wasn't through venting. He was surprised that, with the
score tied, 4-4, Shuey walked Todd Zeile to load the bases in the
seventh and pinch-hitter Greg Norton, a .209 hitter, to force in the
go-ahead run.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan also couldn't believe how many good pitches the Dodgers
gave No. 8 batter Juan Uribe, who had a triple, a double, two singles
and two runs batted in, continuing a disturbing trend on a trip in
which opposing No. 8 hitters--Uribe and San Francisco's David
Bell--are batting .529 (nine for 17) with a homer and seven RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't walk a guy in that situation late in the game--you've
got to make them beat you with the bat," Jordan said of Shuey. "And
we're still getting frustrated by No. 8 guys getting all these hits
and RBIs."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers hoped Beirne, making his second big league start,
would go five or six innings, limit the Rockies to a few runs and
hand a lead to the bullpen. Beirne did his part, giving up two runs
on seven hits in 5 1/3 solid innings; the bullpen did not do its
part, giving up three runs in the seventh to turn a 4-2 lead into a
5-4 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Guillermo Mota gave up an infield single to Uribe
that nicked his glove. Gabe Kapler grounded out, Uribe taking second,
and after Uribe stole third, Juan Pierre walked. Brent Butler lined a
single to center, scoring Uribe from third, and Grissom's error in
the outfield enabled the speedy Pierre to score from first to make it
4-4.</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Jesse Orosco replaced Mota and got Larry Walker to pop
to third. The Dodgers let Butler steal second so they could
intentionally walk Todd Helton, and Dodger Manager Jim Tracy summoned
Shuey.</TE>
<TE>   "Orosco did a fantastic job, and once he got Walker, I chose not
to give Helton a chance to beat us," Tracy said. "I had two chances
with Shuey against Zeile and Norton. I thought those were better
matchups."</TE>
<TE>   They might have been, had Shuey pitched aggressively. But the
right-hander tried to nibble the corners and walked Zeile and Norton.</TE>
<TE>   "I went in there, and I was trying to pitch defensively, that was
the deal," Shuey said. "When the score changed, then I went to an
offensive mode. I have to take a hard look at that and maybe
reevaluate it."</TE>
<TE>   Adding sting to the seventh was a questionable baserunning
decision by Alex Cora in the top of the inning. Cora had doubled with
two outs, and Adrian Beltre walked.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom beat out a chopper to short, and Cora tried to score as
Uribe's throw from shortstop reached Helton at first. But Helton
fired a strike to the plate, easily nailing Cora to end the inning
with the heart of the Dodger order, Paul Lo Duca and Shawn Green, due
to hit.</TE>
<TE>   "If you could have it back, we would have liked one more shot to
hit with the bases loaded," Tracy said. "But I'm not going to
second-guess or criticize aggression by one of my players."</TE>

<KH>OSCAR DE LA HOYA VS. FERNANDO VARGAS/ Why De La Hoya Will
Win:</KH>
<HD>The Gloves Come Off</HD>
<DH>He'll keep his emotions, and his opponent, in check</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Fernando Vargas, formerly an admirer of Oscar De La Hoya, speaks
often about an incident several years ago that turned him against the
older fighter. But Vargas has refused in recent weeks to elaborate
and De La Hoya says he doesn't recall anything occurring between them
that would have inspired such venom. Vargas says he will remind De La
Hoya tonight.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to tell him about it in the ring," Vargas says. "We'll
see if he's man enough to remember it."</LD>
<LD>   If it happens, it will provide drama to what otherwise could be a
disappointing fight. (More on that later.) It also is indicative of
why Vargas will lose. He is all about drama, an emotional and
passionate fighter so fixated on his dislike for De La Hoya that he
will forget when he enters the ring that this sport, at this
154-pound super-welterweight level, rewards the cold, dispassionate
tactician, like De La Hoya.</LD>
<TE>   In a street fight, I'd like Vargas. This is not a street fight.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya will win a unanimous decision.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He could even win it sooner. In one of the restaurants in the
lobby of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, which is playing host to
the fight in its events center, a two-day tribute to boxing began
Thursday with a replay of the second Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran
fight. A similar scenario could unfold tonight, with De La Hoya in
the role of Leonard.</TE>
<TE>   I don't envision Vargas quitting, a la Duran's "no mas"
concession, but he could become so frustrated by his inability to
connect with his punches, much less inflict damage, that he would
leave himself open for De La Hoya's quick and precise strikes.
Vargas' chin, as revealed when he went down five times in a loss to
Felix Trinidad, is suspect.</TE>
<TE>   It also is possible that De La Hoya has regained his knockout
punch. Conventional wisdom holds that he lost much of his power when
he began moving up in weight classes. Although he has 27 knockouts in
36 fights--his record is 34-2--five of the seven fights he has had
since 1999 have gone at least 11 rounds.</TE>
<TE>   But there were mitigating circumstances. One is that the quality
of his opponents, fighters such as Trinidad, Ike Quartey and Shane
Mosley, has been better. The other is that De La Hoya injured his
left wrist against Oba Carr in 1999 and hasn't had the same potency
in his left hand, his more dangerous hand, since.</TE>
<TE>   In the first test for him since wrist surgery in December, perhaps
he will be less tentative with the left than he has been.</TE>
<TE>   But even if that is not the case, he might be an even better boxer
than he was before the injury because his new trainer, Floyd
Mayweather Sr., has focused on developing the right hand. He and De
La Hoya believe it has become a legitimate weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Mayweather also has worked with De La Hoya on moving from side to
side instead of back, a defensive tactic that, although effective in
avoiding punches, made it appear to critics as if he lacked courage.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In fact, De La Hoya, like Muhammad Ali and Leonard in their
primes, is smart enough to know that the fewer times you get hit, the
more often you win.</TE>
<TE>   "In my mind, I can bang with him," De La Hoya, 29, said this week
of Vargas. "But it's not necessary."</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya acknowledges that Vargas, 24, has an edge in strength.
Although both weighed in Friday at 154, Vargas will enter the ring at
least 10 pounds heavier than that. The more slightly built De La Hoya
will add no more than six pounds.</TE>
<TE>   But De La Hoya has turned that into a psychological advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to be stronger, yes," he said. "But when you fight a
strong guy, it is much easier. It makes you more aware that you have
to get out of the way of the punches. That's what happened with
Trinidad. He was a hard puncher. It made me move more. I boxed him
too much, but it was an easy fight."</TE>
<TE>   It's also a fight he lost because he ran the last three rounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought we had the fight in the bag," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He says he will not make that mistake again, just as he will not
make the mistake again of standing toe to toe and banging, as he did
in the second fight against Julio Cesar Chavez. De La Hoya won in the
eighth round, but he suffered needless punishment in what should have
been an easy fight because he let his emotions get the best of him.</TE>
<TE>   He always has been and always will be at his best as a
counterpuncher. Mayweather couldn't change that if he wanted. Vargas,
despite his image as a brawler, is also more effective when he's
counterpunching.</TE>
<TE>   If neither fighter forces the action, you might feel tonight that
you've wasted your $49.95 on the pay-per-view telecast. Take some
comfort in that you didn't pay $1,200 to sit ringside.</TE>
<TE>   But I'm guessing that Vargas, who is neither as smart nor as
experienced as De La Hoya, will not be able to control his anger,
once it is no longer pent up, and will lose his patience. Fools rush
in. It perhaps will provide more entertainment but also a more
decisive outcome. The promotion is called "Bad Blood," but the smart
money is on Sweet Science.</TE>

<LD>The Anaheim Police Department should be prepared to stand up to a
storm of criticism for releasing the investigation of Jarrod
Washburn, without also acknowledging the major discrepancies in the
case.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, one day after the police disclosed the investigation,
the Orange County district attorney declined to file a sexual assault
case against Washburn. If only the police had buttoned their lips a
few days longer, they might have saved Washburn a wrenching personal
experience.</LD>

<TE>   I do not believe in jinxes or anything like that, but being a
die-hard Angel fan for 24 of my 32 years, they are doing everything
they can to change my mind.</TE>
<TE>   First, there was the Gary DiSarcina injury that cost them an
11-game lead, and then Tony Phillips gets caught with cocaine, and
now there is the Jarrod Washburn story. Is this the beginning of the
end again?</TE>
<TE>   I hope the Angels can erase all the jinx talk and get their fans
one trip to the World Series, but then again, I have been saying that
for 24 years now.</TE>

<TE>   Jarrod Washburn, 28, is investigated for allegedly sexually
assaulting a 16-year-old, and one of his teammates says, "I can't
believe it's true. But it would be terrible timing if it is."</TE>
<TE>   Not that it would be a terrible thing if true, merely terrible

<TE>   The Angels are bringing the best of hard-fought, competitive

<LD>Robyn Norwood's article "Victory Looks Weak in Review," [Sept. 9] was
the most negative approach to reviewing a game that I've read in
recent years.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, the Bruins made some mistakes in their first game of the
season, with many young players taking the field for the first time.
But give them some credit for winning a game that a more experienced
team could easily have lost.</LD>

<TE>   As I listened to the UCLA football game last week, I heard
announcer Steve Physioc speak of "the courage" shown by Colorado
State quarterback Bradlee Van Pelt in trying to lead a late comeback,
and "the courage" shown by UCLA Coach Bob Toledo in substituting a
freshman in at quarterback in place of senior Cory Paus.</TE>
<TE>   This is but another example of the absurd hyperbole that is all
too common in the worlds of sports. In this of all weeks, Physioc and
his ilk would do well to remember that words like "courage" should
not be used lightly.</TE>

<LD>So Fernando Vargas thinks he is a "real Mexican"? As a Mexican
American, I am offended by this notion. I don't identify with a
common street thug like Vargas, and he is the last person I would
want to represent my culture. I don't know how much time he has
actually spent in Mexico, but "real Mexicans" are a respectful,
courteous people, who would have no respect for a gangbanger.</LD>
<LD>   Oscar De La Hoya, on the other hand, is the type of person Mexican
Americans can take pride in. He has achieved the success we would
want for ourselves and our children. This Mexican will be rooting for
De La Hoya to administer the worst beating of Vargas' life.</LD>
<LD>   Vargas has talent, but to be a "real Mexican" one has to act like
one. As long as he keeps associating with the same thugs, he will
never have my respect.</LD>

American under "nationality." I hope that doesn't offend you.</TE>

<LD>Even though he holds the most unbreakable passing record in football,
Johnny Unitas' career wasn't about records or statistics. It was a
Cinderella story about a great leader who couldn't be kept down. It
was a story about a man who stayed loyal to his supporters in
Baltimore, even when his old team wouldn't. It was a story about a
man's integrity being rewarded 30 years later, when the Vince
Lombardi Trophy returned to Baltimore.</LD>
<LD>   His death on a day as historically important as Sept. 11 serves as
a reminder that it's more important to be a great man than a great
star. Fortunately, in Johnny Unitas, we had both.</LD>

<TE>   With all due respect to the late John Steadman, his 1999
comparison of Johnny Unitas' 47-game touchdown pass streak to Joe
DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak, which appeared in The Times on
Thursday, is flawed. Steadman stated that "had DiMaggio missed a game
because of illness or injury, his streak would have stopped."</TE>
<TE>   Absolutely wrong. Per Baseball Rule 10.24, a consecutive-games
hitting streak counts games actually played by the batter, not team
games.</TE>

<LD>Further proof that sports is just the toy department of life.</LD>
<LD>   The toy department: In a lifetime spent rooting against the
Dodgers, few pitchers have irritated me more than Kaz Ishii. While I
admire his skills, his style of pitching can be maddening if you're
pulling for the other team and he's getting people out with
curveballs in the dirt.</LD>
<LD>   The life department: Yet within seconds after seeing Ishii take a
line drive in the face, I found myself one of his biggest supporters.
Let's try not to take the game too seriously.</LD>

<LD>In his article on John Madden's addition to "Monday Night Football,"
Larry Stewart writes, "John Madden is talkative on the air." This is
like saying it is slightly warm in Death Valley or kind of chilly in
Siberia.</LD>
<LD>   I used to be a big fan of John Madden, but now, from the time a
play is whistled over until the quarterback takes the next snap,
Madden yammers incessantly.</LD>

<TE>   Will ABC ever learn? Now John Madden isn't making any difference
and the ratings are down. Well, I'm no rocket scientist, but maybe
they should think about the following: Their ratings have dropped
every year for the last seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Well, could it be that over that period the second-largest market
in the country does not have a football team? Come on, NFL, stop
trying to squeeze us for money. Also, just come out and say that L.A.
will never be considered for a football team as long as it involves
the Coliseum.</TE>

<TE>   Despite repeated warnings from your writers about the hazards of
expansion football, I tuned in to watch the fans of the Houston
Texans expressing either complete nirvana or delirium over their
team's inaugural victory over the Dallas Cowboys.</TE>
<TE>   It made me wonder why I wasn't watching the L.A. Californians
instead. I came up with these reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Like many football fans, when Philip Anschutz pulled out from his
plan to bring a team to L.A., I was crushed, but upon further
thought, is this really the kind of fickle potential ownership we
want? At the slightest provocation have him pull up stakes? So I
thought what we need is a potential owner like billionaire Bob McNair
of Houston, somebody who has the money and the love of their
community to bring football to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately I could come up only with a millionaire who loves
L.A. enough to be our McNair, Randy ("I Love L.A.") Newman. I know he
dislikes short people, but I'm not sure he likes football.</TE>
<TE>   So to any billionaires out there who love L.A. and football,
please contact me ASAP so we don't spend another decade on the
outside looking in.</TE>

<HD>Rodriguez, Anderson Help Fuel MVP Debate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is no need to modify it by calling it one of the best seasons
ever by a shortstop. It is one of the best seasons, period.</LD>
<LD>   The fact that Alex Rodriguez is producing it for a team that is
last in the American League West shouldn't be held against him, says
Garret Anderson, who could stake claim to the
most-valuable-player-award himself, but there are voting members of
the baseball writers committee who might hold it against him.</LD>
<LD>   The poorly defined award has long confused the people responsible
for deciding who wins it, and it also has Anderson and Rodriguez
confused to the point that Rodriguez suggests it should be clarified.</LD>
<TE>   He also suggests (insisting he is only stating a fact and not
campaigning for the MVP) that there is some confusion about his Texas
Rangers being a last-place team.</TE>
<TE>   In Anaheim on Friday night, Rodriguez said the Rangers are last
only in the context of being fourth in the four-team AL West.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the seventh or eighth best record in the league, and the
truth of the matter is that if Minnesota [about to clinch the AL
Central] was in this division, they'd be last, too," Rodriguez said.
"We play in what is arguably the best division in baseball. Three
teams may win 100 games, and any of them might end up as world
champion.</TE>
<TE>   "To say we're in last place is overdone."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels and Oakland A's do, indeed, have a shot at 100 wins,
but the Seattle Mariners, who won 116 last year, may not win 90.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers, statistically more last than not, had something to do
with that, having swept a four-game series from the Mariners in Texas
while the Angels were winning three of four from the A's and slowing
Miguel Tejada's own MVP express.</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland shortstop had only two hits in 14 at-bats against the
Angels, who did a similar number on Rodriguez and the Rangers in the
opener of a three-game series.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez checked in with a shortstop-record 54 home runs, 132
runs batted in and 367 total bases, but he was held to a single in
four at-bats as the Angels cooled the Rangers, 3-2, to remain tied
with the A's for the division lead. Both are virtually assured of a
playoff berth because the Mariners are eight back in a wild-card race
that is basically over.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod Washburn, in an important test for the rest of the season
and beyond, demonstrated he can deal with the mental fallout of the
sexual assault allegation by pitching 7 1/3 strong innings for his
18th win.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, too often left out of an MVP equation that generally
includes Rodriguez, Tejada and three New York Yankees (Alfonso
Soriano, Jason Giambi and Bernie Williams), singled in a run in a
game decided by a run.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have won four in a row, and the left fielder is driving
his team down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson has 14 RBIs in the last 11 games and a .340 average since
the All-Star break. He is batting .311 with 26 homers, 114 RBIs and a
major league-high 54 doubles.</TE>
<TE>   In September of a season in which he was selected for the All-Star
game for the first time, he knows his MVP candidacy is a longshot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough division, let alone a tough league," Anderson said.
"There are a lot of guys with real good numbers. I'd be honored to
receive votes, but I don't know the true definition. There are so
many different [interpretations]. It would be nice if there was a
clearer definition."</TE>
<TE>   The instructions that accompany the ballot say that the award
"need not" go to a member of a division winner or other playoff team
and that a player should be judged on his "actual value" to his own
team.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion," said Anderson, "the MVP of the league is the guy
who demonstrates the best numbers across the board, regardless of how
his team does, and Rodriguez has done that.</TE>
<TE>   "Besides, playing on a team that is not doing well is harder, and
he's demonstrated his professionalism by not letting the losing get
him down. I mean, it's easier to play when the team is winning, but
he's still being responsible to his organization by going out there
and being the player he's capable of being."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, of course, is paid handsomely to do that, but there are
examples of other well-paid players showing commitment only on the
way to the bank, especially in September.</TE>
<TE>   On his own view of the MVP, Rodriguez said:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm confused what the MVP means. If the MVP has to play for a
first-place team, I'm not a winner, not a contender really. If the
MVP is the best player in a particular year, I have a shot. I'm very
proud of what I'm doing, but I'll let the writers deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   He added, however: "I'm hoping in the future they can find a
remedy, or every year it will be the same thing and they'll have to
answer, 'How unique does a year have to be to transcend the MVP
award?' If they change it and make it clear, it will be easier for
the writers and everyone else to understand."</TE>
<TE>   The MVP is what it is. The award has gone to players on good teams
and bad teams, and the instructions are unlikely to change.</TE>
<TE>   Asked who he would vote for if he couldn't vote for himself,
Rodriguez called it "one of those years when there's not just one
guy" and mentioned Tejada, the Yankee trio and said that, perhaps, it
should go on a collective basis to Oakland pitchers Barry Zito, Tim
Hudson and Mark Mulder.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't mention Anderson, but what's new? The Angel left fielder
is often overlooked, and the MVP is certain to confuse anyone.</TE>

<KH>OSCAR DE LA HOYA VS. FERNANDO VARGAS/  Why Vargas Will Win:</KH>
<HD>The Gloves Come Off</HD>
<DH>The ingredients of an upset: hubris, hunger and heart</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL PLASCHKE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>With absolutely no due respect to Floyd Mayweather Sr....</LD>
<LD>   Vargas is a warrior; his head looks like he mows it.</LD>
<LD>   De La Hoya is a warrior like his trainer is a poet</LD>
<TE>   Vargas wore a bracelet, a gift from the police.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya wears jewelry that looks good on your niece.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas has begged for this fight since he was first dissed.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya backed out once with a boo-boo on his wrist.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya is fighting for money, Vargas is fighting for home.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Boy will be knocked back on his golden arches, and land
flat on his golden dome.</TE>
<TE>   What everyone says, it's true.</TE>
<TE>   In tonight's junior-middleweight title fight between Fernando
Vargas and Oscar De La Hoya, one guy will be overwhelmed by the
stage.</TE>
<TE>   One guy will panic under the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   One guy will turn into a dumb puncher.</TE>
<TE>   One guy will charge early, stagger late and finish cold.</TE>
<TE>   But what everyone thinks, it's wrong.</TE>
<TE>   That guy will not be Vargas.</TE>
<TE>   It will be De La Hoya, who doesn't want to wear the gloves any
more than we want to see him crooning love songs and wearing fishnet.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya, a 2-to-1 favorite, is supposedly a much better pure
boxer.</TE>
<TE>   Well, yeah, he was.</TE>
<TE>   But this is the first time in his life he has waited 16 months
between fights.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time he will be fighting after two injuries and
one surgery to his important left wrist.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time he has fought a 154-pounder who did not
have "Heinz" written on his shirt.</TE>
<TE>   That's a lot of firsts for a guy who some thought had already
fought his last.</TE>
<TE>   When De La Hoya backed out of the fight last spring because of
wrist problems, the boxing world was buzzing with talk that he
retired. He was happily married, living mostly in Puerto Rico,
avoiding all memories of his jarring losses to Felix Trinidad and
Shane Mosley.</TE>
<TE>   He was playing golf so much that, upon visiting his Big Bear
training camp last month, I stumbled over balls nestled in his front
lawn.</TE>
<TE>   He had become so out of touch with the demands of his profession
that, during the middle of a question about his workouts, he leaned
back on his plush couch and shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really, really hard," he said. "I forgot how hard this
was."</TE>
<TE>   Walking from that lifestyle into a ring with Fernando Vargas is
like stepping from the Mandalay Bay into the Mojave.</TE>
<TE>   During a sandstorm. Surrounded by snakes. With orders to jog 10
miles.</TE>
<TE>   The notion held by those who have seen only Vargas' biggest fight
is that he can't box.</TE>
<TE>   It is understandable, but it is wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Vargas became caught up in the carnival and fought the
worst fight possible against Trinidad, sacrificing himself at the
altar of his machismo.</TE>
<TE>   But he has learned.</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by other hardscrabble types, living in a cluttered
bedroom with sheets on the floor and a "Scarface" poster on the wall,
he has spent the last couple of months in his Big Bear training camp
remembering.</TE>
<TE>   He was a terrific boxer when he knocked out champion Yory Boy
Campas in seven rounds. He was splendid when he won a decision over
Ike Quartey.</TE>
<TE>   And he was even better against Raul Marquez.</TE>
<TE>   You remember Raul Marquez. He was an Olympic teammate of De La
Hoya, a close friend who later worked in his gym.</TE>
<TE>   Because of this close association, Vargas hated Marquez nearly as
much as he hates De La Hoya. He loathed his attitude. He pined for
his respect.</TE>
<TE>   Once they got into the ring, he finally did something about it,
pounding Marquez around the ropes until finishing him with an
11th-round knockout.</TE>
<TE>   That was three years ago. The pounding by Trinidad has ensured
that Vargas is not the same fighter. He does not have the same chin.
He might not have the same stamina.</TE>
<TE>   But he has the ability, the same style and, more important, the
same will.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya will be fighting for a paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas will be fighting for respect.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya doesn't need this.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas, who said he is willing to die in the ring, cannot live
without it.</TE>
<TE>   They both say they are fighting for the hearts of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But only one of them really lives there anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Ignore the hype. Bet the heart.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

Plaschke can be reached for congratulations at

<HD>A Bruin Win Might Strike Their Fancy</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>STILLWATER, Okla.</DL>
<LD>Maybe the stagecoach broke an axle and word never reached Oklahoma
State that UCLA is 4-0 against Big 12 Conference opponents under
Coach Bob Toledo.</LD>
<LD>   A column in the Daily Oklahoman on Friday referred to UCLA as:
"Fancy Boys."</LD>
<LD>   What will it take for the baby-blue Bruins to lose their froufrou
image?</LD>
<TE>   They physically manhandled Colorado State last week, scoring 23
fourth-quarter points in a 30-19 victory by wearing down the Rams
with rugged line play.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, led by All-American middle linebacker Robert Thomas,
UCLA established a physical identity, and there is plenty of residual
toughness, as any opponent who has banged heads with defensive
lineman Rodney Leisle, offensive tackle Mike Saffer, fullback Manuel
White or cornerback Ricky Manning can attest.</TE>
<TE>   Off the field, regrettably, the Bruins don't back down either,
having been involved in several brawls that resulted in criminal
charges.</TE>
<TE>   Fancy boys?</TE>
<TE>   Out here on the lone prairie, them's fightin' words.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a strong effort to become a physical football team last
season," Toledo said. "We're the same kind of team this year. The
people we play realize that."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State, today's opponent, ought to know that UCLA beat
Texas, 66-3, in 1997, and 49-31 in '98. The Cowboys should have been
informed that the Bruins beat Texas A&amp;M, 29-23, in '97 and Kansas,
41-17, last season.</TE>
<TE>   That's four victories over the Big 12 by a combined score of
185-74, numbers that if not fancy, are certainly gaudy.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been fortunate to have success against teams from one of
the top conferences in the country," Toledo said. "The Big 12 and
Pac-10 conferences are very much alike."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State has never played UCLA, although Coach Les Miles was
a Michigan assistant in the 1981 Bluebonnet Bowl game when the
Wolverines defeated the Bruins, 33-14. Miles is as diplomatic as
Toledo, refusing to be drawn into characterizing the Big 12 as
producing tougher players than the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in the old days, that was probably true," Miles said. "If
you think about Pennsylvania and coal towns and the Midwest, Chicago,
the Irish guys who would show up on campuses, there was some
fistfight to them.</TE>
<TE>   "UCLA is as talented as any we will line up and play--Texas,
Oklahoma, anybody. They compare favorably to those teams."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins, in fact, hold an advantage in the trenches. Oklahoma
State (1-1) has had injuries to the offensive line and only senior
left tackle Kyle Eaton is regarded as a standout.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is experienced on both sides of the line. The recent
emergence of guard Steve Vieira and center Mike McCloskey, combined
with veterans Saffer, Bryce Bohlander, Eyoseph Efseaff and Mike
Seidman, makes for a formidable offensive line.</TE>
<TE>   On defense, Leisle, Steve Morgan, Sean Phillips and Ryan Boschetti
at tackle and Dave Ball, Rusty Williams, Mat Ball and Asi Faoa at end
provide two-deep quality at each position.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, UCLA's weakness appears to be precisely where the
fanciest plays often are made--special teams. Two fumbled kick
returns, two missed field goals, a roughing-the-kicker penalty and a
55-yard Colorado State punt return marred the opener.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA finished at the bottom of the Pac-10 in punt and kick return
coverage last season. Despite relentless work during fall camp,
problems remain.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all hyped up and anxious," receiver Craig Bragg said.
"We'll get better quick."</TE>
<TE>   They'd better. Oklahoma State is dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Massey led the nation in kick returns last season and
Terrance Davis-Bryant averages 13.9 yards a punt return.</TE>
<TE>   Against Colorado State, Bruin senior Nate Fikse, recognized as one
of the nation's best punters and kickoff specialists, was not
accurate.</TE>
<TE>   "He's supposed to kick outside the left hash mark to reduce the
size of the field," said assistant Marc Dove, who is responsible for
kicks and kick returns. "His kicks, and the punt returned for 55
yards, were unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Coaches, however, resisted making wholesale changes on special
teams. In fact, the same personnel that took the field last week will
play today.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not going to panic," Dove said. "We're not going to change
a bunch of people. We've got to coach better and they have to be more
attentive.</TE>
<TE>   "We were fortunate to overcome special teams mistakes and win the
game."</TE>
<TE>   Special teams is the only area in which Oklahoma State figures to
hold an advantage. UCLA must avoid giving up big pass plays to
receiver Rashaun Woods, and Manning is charged with ensuring it
doesn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   Thunderstorms are forecast, and a wet field could benefit the
Bruins, who with White and tailback Akil Harris running behind a
veteran line are better equipped than the no-huddle, pass-happy
Cowboys to pound the ball on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to mix it up, throw the ball and try some things," Saffer
said. "But maybe what we do best is open holes and run down people's
throats. If that's what we have to do, that's what we'll do."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing fancy about that.</TE>

<TE>   WHEN UCLA HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins rushed for 215 yards last week by overwhelming an
undersized Colorado State front. Oklahoma State, which employs a 4-2
defense with a five-man secondary, is much larger and has been stingy
against the run. Both Cowboy opponents, however, passed the ball
effectively, so this is an opportune time for Bruin quarterback Cory
Paus to gain momentum after a so-so opener. Freshman quarterback Drew
Olson will play at least one series again. UCLA scored its first
touchdown last week on a 49-yard reverse by freshman receiver Junior
Taylor. Expect more trick plays from Coach Bob Toledo, who is seeking
ways to get the ball in the hands of potential game-breakers such as
Taylor, Tyler Ebell and Craig Bragg.</TE>
<TE>   WHEN OKLAHOMA STATE HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys use a no-huddle offense and spread the field with
receivers. Quarterback Josh Fields, who passed for a career-high 261
yards last week against Northern Iowa, throws mostly medium-range
passes and his receivers run well after the catch. Rashaun Woods is
the most dangerous weapon and will be guarded by cornerback Ricky
Manning. Woods has 19 catches for 301 yards and three touchdowns
after leading the Big 12 with 80 catches and 1,023 receiving yards
last season. The Cowboys could find it difficult to run against a
strong Bruin front seven. Besides left tackle Kyle Eaton, who has 29
starts, Oklahoma State's line is inexperienced.</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO UCLA VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Containing the potent Cowboy passing game, especially Woods.</TE>
<TE>   2. Improving special teams play.</TE>
<TE>   3. Establishing a running attack against a Cowboy defense that has
given up only 71 yards a game on the ground.</TE>

<DL>BOULDER, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Ask Pete Carroll about altitude and you get attitude.</LD>
<LD>   USC's second-year coach scoffs at the notion that his 17th-ranked
Trojans might experience stamina problems today when they play No. 18
Colorado at 5,345 feet above sea level.</LD>
<LD>   "They might feel it for the first series or two, but after that
they'll be fine," said Carroll, who as an NFL coach took teams to
Denver's Mile High Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Time will tell for the Trojans (1-0). A bye week allowed players
to catch their breath after defeating Auburn in their Sept. 2 opener
at the furnace-like Coliseum. It also gave them extra days to prepare
for the defending Big 12 Conference champion Buffaloes (1-1) and a
sellout crowd at Folsom Field.</TE>
<TE>   "We're rested, we're ready, I don't think the elevation is going
to be any problem for us," defensive tackle Shaun Cody said.</TE>
<TE>   USC showed its resolve against Auburn by controlling the ball in
the second half and eating up more than eight minutes of the fourth
quarter during a go-ahead 50-yard drive.</TE>
<TE>   Senior running back Malaefou MacKenzie stood out, catching six
passes for 117 yards and rushing 10 times for 33 yards. Quarterback
Carson Palmer completed 23 of 32 passes for 302 yards and a
touchdown, but threw two interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans amassed 386 yards, but rushed for only 84--almost four
fewer than their embarrassing 87.7-yard average of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not anywhere near where we need to be, to be a good running
football team," Carroll said earlier this week. "We'll just continue
to hammer away at it."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans are still without one of their main tools. Senior
tailback Justin Fargas missed the opener because of a hamstring
strain, and it is doubtful that he will play today.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Sultan McCullough will alternate with MacKenzie, and senior
Chad Pierson, who missed the opener because of a hamstring strain,
will start at fullback.</TE>
<TE>   The offensive line also will sport a new look, with freshman
Winston Justice scheduled to start at right tackle and redshirt
junior Eric Torres moving to right guard.</TE>
<TE>   USC's defense, which limited Auburn to 281 yards, is unchanged.
Weakside linebacker Melvin Simmons is scheduled to start despite
having been hospitalized for two days this week because of an
infection in his left leg and flu.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado, ranked seventh in the Associated Press preseason poll,
lost its opener to Colorado State, 19-14, and defeated San Diego
State, 34-14, last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone can watch us play and say we've been
terrific," Buffalo Coach Gary Barnett said.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's backfield, regarded as one of the nation's best before
the season began, is not at full strength. Junior running back Marcus
Houston, who rushed for 150 yards against USC two seasons ago, is out
because of a knee injury. Quarterback Craig Ochs also will miss the
game after suffering a concussion at the end of the first half
against San Diego State.</TE>
<TE>   The Buffaloes, however, still have junior Chris Brown, who rushed
for 94 yards and a touchdown against Colorado State and 185 yards and
two touchdowns against San Diego State.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very good cutback runner who really accelerates when he
sees the hole," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hodge, a senior who played at Manhattan Beach Mira Costa
High and El Camino College, will start at quarterback. Hodge replaced
Ochs against San Diego State and engineered two scoring drives.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a tough kid and a good leader," said USC quarterback coach
Steve Sarkisian, who tutored Hodge at El Camino in 2000. "Guys will
rally around him because they see how hard he plays. He doesn't shy
away from a hit."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's defense is giving up 263.5 passing yards and 97 rushing
yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   "We have decent speed," Barnett said. "Not USC speed, but decent
speed."</TE>
<TE>   The Buffaloes played six defensive backs much of the time against
pass-happy San Diego State and USC will probably see the same set.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman safety J.J. Billingsley made 15 tackles, and junior
safety Clyde Surrell recorded 12 for a unit that also features junior
linebacker Sean Tufts and senior linebacker Drew Wahlroos.</TE>
<TE>   "They're really committed to eight-man-front football," Carroll
said. "They blitz a lot on passing downs and load up on you on the
running downs."</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Jeremy Bloom--an Olympic freestyle skier--averages 28.2
yards per punt return, but he is questionable because of a broken big
toe on his left foot.</TE>
<TE>   Punter Mark Mariscal averages 46.9 yards a kick, which ranks
second in the NCAA.</TE>

<HD>Angels Use 'Small Ball' to Produce Big Results</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Behind Mike Scioscia's managing style, the Angels have become one of
the most feared "small ball" teams in baseball.</LD>
<LD>   And it's really simple how they've done it. It starts with the
Angels' ability to move runners, which was evident this week when
they took three of four games from the Oakland A's in a big series at
Anaheim's Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels kept the A's jumping in a variety of ways. If they
weren't taking an extra base on an out, or stretching a single into a
double, the Angels were scoring a run with a suicide squeeze bunt, as
they did Wednesday night in a 6-5 comeback victory.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a very aggressive style of baseball," said shortstop David
Eckstein, the Angels' leadoff man. "We go out there and put pressure
on the defense. We do things like laying down bunts, sacrificing, hit
and runs--anything that makes them have to make plays. That's been
the big key to our success."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels certainly did not start off Wednesday's game the way
they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   With Oakland pitcher Cory Lidle doing a solid job of getting big
outs, the A's took a 4-0 lead. The Angels, meanwhile, left four
runners on base in the first three innings.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of panicking and trying to hit home runs in every
at-bat, the Angels stayed cool and stuck with their game plan, just
as they have all season.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect it from ourselves," said left fielder Garret Anderson,
the club's leading home run hitter. "We don't feel any added pressure
because we are not going out there trying to do anything that we are
not capable of doing. We go about our business the same all of the
time."</TE>
<TE>   That's why it should not have been much of a surprise when the
Angels rallied to get back into Wednesday's game with a big fourth
inning.</TE>
<TE>   Designated hitter Brad Fullmer got things going when he knocked a
2-2 pitch into the left-center field gap for a double. Scott Spiezio,
who'd started at third base in place of Troy Glaus, followed with a
single over the head of Oakland shortstop Miguel Tejada, scoring
Fullmer.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Wooten continued the rally, hustling to turn a single into a
double, giving the Angels runners on second and third with no out.
Catcher Bengie Molina did his part, hitting a sacrifice fly to center
that scored Spiezio and enabled Wooten to move to third.</TE>
<TE>   With the A's lead cut to 4-2, Adam Kennedy stepped up and hit a
blooper that bounced off Tejada's glove as Wooten scored. But the key
to the play was Kennedy's determination to get to second base and not
settle for a single.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get down early, we know not to try and make up all the runs
in one inning with one hit," Eckstein said. "We are not afraid to be
aggressive running the bases. Look at AK, he gets a single and then
the next thing you see, he's on second."</TE>
<TE>   With Eckstein up next, the extra base Kennedy took became even
bigger when Lidle bounced a 1-0 pitch in front of the plate. Without
hesitation, Kennedy easily made it to third to set up a squeeze-play
opportunity for Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels didn't go with the play on Lidle's next pitch,
which was a strike to move the count to 2-1 on Eckstein. That's when
it turned into a cat-and-mouse game between Scioscia and Oakland
Manager Art Howe.</TE>
<TE>   "The squeeze is a play that is incredibly dependent on
coordination and timing," said Scioscia, who has used this tactic at
least five times this season. "When the elements come together and
you feel good about it, then it's easy to go with it.</TE>
<TE>   "But execution is the key. Maybe the guy on third doesn't get a
good break and is a little late, or the bunt isn't perfect, or the
infield is in and charging and able to make a play at the plate.
There's also times when your guy breaks too early and the pitcher is
able to read it and throws the ball up or has a pitchout. Those are
times when you're not going to be able to get the bunt down."</TE>
<TE>   With Lidle behind in the count, Scioscia called for the squeeze on
the next pitch and Howe guessed right by having Lidle fake a throw to
third, hoping to get the Angels to tip their hand.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for the A's, Kennedy and Eckstein were not fooled by
the fake, Scioscia kept the play on, and it worked to perfection.
Eckstein tapped a textbook bunt down the third base line and by the
time Oakland catcher Greg Myers picked up the ball, Kennedy was
already at the plate to tie the score at 4.</TE>
<TE>   "You're just trying to get the ball down anywhere in fair
territory," Eckstein said.</TE>
<TE>   "With AK's speed, as long as you get the ball on the ground, he's
going to be safe and that was my main objective. As soon as I hit it,
I knew it was going to work. That's a great feeling, knowing that
you've pulled off one of the most exciting plays in the game."</TE>
<TE>   Added Scioscia, "Obviously, they had their antennas up because you
could see they were trying to defense it. You try and get a count
when the pitcher is concentrating on getting the ball across the
plate. But although a pitcher can have squeeze in his mind, he
doesn't want to be preoccupied with defending the squeeze and going
ball 3 or 4 on the hitter."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels went on to win on Wooten's two-out double in the
seventh. It was their 12th win in 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   That might surprise everyone but them.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a bunch of guys that will do whatever it takes to help
the team win," Eckstein said. "Other teams might not have that type
of lineup, but we do. It's kind of funny, because [small ball] seemed
to be going away from the game not too long ago, but I think it's
starting to become [fashionable] again."</TE>

<HD>Zito Pushes Mariners to Another Loss, 5-0</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Zito held Seattle hitless until John Olerud singled to lead off
the eighth inning, and the Oakland Athletics defeated the struggling
Mariners, 5-0, Friday night at Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   The Athletics, who remained tied for first place in the American
League West with the Angels, ended a three-game losing streak.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle lost its fifth in a row and fell farther behind the A's
and Angels in its bid for the wild-card spot. The Mariners' losing
streak is their longest since they dropped eight in a row from Aug.
12-20, 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Zito (21-5), who leads the league in victories, retired the first
16 batters before walking Dan Wilson on four pitches in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Olerud singled to center field to start the eighth and Ruben
Sierra followed with a single. After Manager Art Howe visited the
mound, Zito retired Mike Cameron on a fly ball and got Wilson to hit
into a double play.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Durham hit a solo home run in the seventh off Ismael Valdes
(8-11) and scored three runs.</TE>
<TE>   Zito's brilliant season appeared as if it was about to get even
better as he bid to pitch Oakland's first no-hitter since Dave
Stewart did it against Toronto in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Zito draped a towel over his head in the dugout after the inning
in which he allowed his only two hits. The left-hander struck out
seven and walked one in eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 12, Minnesota 5--The Indians, in no rush to surrender
their division title, stalled the Twins' inevitable clinching again
with a rout at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Former Dodger Terry Mulholland took a shutout into the seventh
inning, and Jim Thome and Karim Garcia hit three-run homers for the
defending AL Central champions, who blasted Eric Milton (13-9) for
nine runs in the first two innings.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Fryman homered for the Indians, who would prefer if the
Twins wrapped up their championship elsewhere. Minnesota arrived in
Cleveland on Thursday with a magic number of three. The Twins have
brought in 10 cases of champagne in anticipation of celebrating their
first playoff appearance since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 8, Boston 3--Rookie Rodrigo Lopez earned his 15th
victory and Geronimo Gil hit a two-run homer at Boston as the Orioles
ended an eight-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore's Mike Bordick set an AL record with his 96th
consecutive errorless game at shortstop, breaking a tie with former
Oriole star Cal Ripken. Rey Ordonez of the New York Mets set the
major league record of 101 games in 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   Bordick handled three chances in the field, increasing his major
league record to 485 in a row without an error.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 13, New York 2--Magglio Ordonez went three for three with
three RBIs and three runs scored as the White Sox capitalized on
three errors to win at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Mussina (16-10) struggled with his control, walking four
batters and hitting one, to lose his third consecutive start as the
Yankees' five-game winning streak ended.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Tampa Bay 2--Eric Hinske hit a three-run homer as the
Blue Jays tied a season-high with their fifth consecutive win,
defeating the Devil Rays at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays turned their first triple play in franchise history
in the fifth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 4, Kansas City 2--Carlos Pena hit a two-run homer with one
out in the 10th inning at Detroit and the Tigers defeated the Royals.
Pena's 18th homer gave reliever Eric Eckenstahler (1-0) his first
major league victory.</TE>

<HD>Scioscia Weighing Rotation Options</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It appears the Angels are headed to the playoffs, tied with the
Oakland Athletics atop the American League West and eight games ahead
of Seattle in the wild-card race, but they are taking nothing for
granted.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Mike Scioscia knows nothing is guaranteed until the Angels
clinch the division title or AL wild-card berth, though he's
considering rotation options for the division series just to be
prepared.</LD>
<LD>   "If we do make an adjustment it'll probably be somewhere in the
Oakland series," Scioscia said of the four-game showdown starting
Monday at Oakland. "If we want to make adjustments for things to line
up after that."</LD>
<TE>   Left-hander Jarrod Washburn and right-hander Kevin Appier, the
Angels' top starters, could pitch the first two games of an
opening-round series against the Minnesota Twins or New York Yankees,
probable winners of the AL Central and East, respectively, if each
worked three times on three days' rest. Washburn and Appier would
then each have five days' rest before starting Oct. 1 and 2 in the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   After starting Friday's opener of a three-game series against the
Texas Rangers at Edison Field, Washburn would pitch Tuesday against
the Athletics at Oakland, Sept. 21 against the Mariners at Seattle
and Sept. 25 against the Rangers at Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Appier, scheduled to start today, would start Wednesday in
Oakland, Sept. 22 in Seattle and Sept. 26 in Texas. Both pitchers
would skip the final regular-season series against Seattle at Edison
Field.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Agent Scott Boras said allegations of sexual assault against
Washburn would not affect the Angels' view of their staff ace, who
can go to arbitration after the season. The Orange County district
attorney Wednesday declined to file charges against Washburn, who was
under investigation by Anaheim police for 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Mead, Angel vice president of communications, said the club
has launched an internal investigation into security at Edison Field
because of news reports about where the alleged incident occurred.
Mead reiterated the club supports Washburn.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels on Friday extended their contract with Class A Rancho
Cucamonga through the 2004 season. The Quakes, an Angel affiliate the
last two seasons, have led the California League in attendance in
each of their first 10 seasons but finished this year with the worst
record in the league, 52-88.</TE>

<HD>Calvin Wins His Racial Discrimination Case</HD>
<DH>Jurisprudence: Jury decides in basketball coach's favor,
awarding him $210,000 in lawsuit against Cal State Dominguez Hills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court jury on Friday ordered Cal State
Dominguez Hills to pay former NBA player Mack Calvin $210,000, ruling
that he was the victim of discrimination based on race while coaching
the school's men's basketball team during the 1996-97 season.</LD>
<LD>   Calvin, who is African American, had his one-year renewable
contract terminated after one season as coach.</LD>
<LD>   The jury voted, 10-2, in Calvin's favor after four days of
testimony and two days of deliberations. Calvin was awarded $90,000
for lost wages and $120,000 for emotional distress. His complaint
said he required medical attention for stress and anxiety.</LD>
<TE>   "The jurors spoke loudly that there was institutional racism at
Cal State Dominguez Hills," said Calvin, 54, who is now boys'
basketball coach at Compton Dominguez High. "I've said all along this
wasn't [just] about me. People were hurt and careers had been taken
from them."</TE>
<TE>   Dana Cartozian, the deputy attorney general representing Cal State
Dominguez Hills, said no decision had been made whether to appeal the
civil court decision.</TE>
<TE>   Cartozian had told the jury during opening statements that Calvin
was dismissed from a job that paid him more than $60,000 a year
because of the team's poor record and Calvin's lackluster recruiting
efforts, inadequate fund-raising abilities, and NCAA rules
violations. The Toros finished the season 7-20.</TE>
<TE>   "We strongly disagree with the verdict," said Thomas Knox, senior
media relations officer for Cal State Dominguez Hills. "It does not
appear to be based on the evidence that was presented during the
trial. The evidence established that Mr. Calvin's contract was not
renewed because of a variety of documented performance problems.</TE>
<TE>   "These allegations are about things that happened six years ago in
a different administration. Today, the campus president, the vice
president of student affairs, who is in charge of athletics, and the
vice president of university advancement are African American. Also,
five coaches are African American.</TE>
<TE>   "Our university prides itself on its diversity and strives to
maintain a fair and positive environment for faculty, staff and
students."</TE>
<TE>   Calvin's new team, Compton Dominguez, had been a regional power
until his arrival last year. The Dons won five state titles and a
mythical national championship under coaches Steve Singleton and
Russell Otis from 1987-2001.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the team finished 15-12, losing more games than it had
in the previous three seasons combined.</TE>
<TE>   Calvin, a standout guard at USC who played four of his 11 pro
seasons in the NBA, was also an NBA assistant for eight years,
including two with the Clippers.</TE>

<HD>Olowokandi's Agent Issues Ultimatum</HD>
<DH>Clippers: Duffy says client must be signed by Wednesday or
he will play elsewhere after season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The agent for Clipper center Michael Olowokandi has set a Wednesday
deadline for the team to sign his client to a long-term contract
extension worth more than $80 million. If the two sides can't reach
an agreement by then, Olowokandi will accept his one-season
qualifying offer and look to sign elsewhere when he becomes an
unrestricted free agent next summer.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't want this to go into training camp unsettled," Bill
Duffy, Olowokandi's agent, said Friday. "I would like to see a
resolution by Wednesday."</LD>
<LD>   When asked if that meant Olowokandi would not re-sign with the
Clippers next summer if a new contract wasn't reached Wednesday,
Duffy said, "Never say never. Obviously, it's Michael's decision."</LD>
<TE>   Said Olowokandi: "I don't want it to seem unfair by holding the
Clippers to Wednesday, but they had all summer to get the deal done.
... I hope it gets done by Wednesday. I feel like I've found my niche
here. I'd like to be part of something that started out basically
from nothing five years ago."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   NBA teams have until Oct. 31 to re-sign players eligible for
long-term extensions.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi, forwards Elton Brand, Corey Maggette and Lamar Odom
and point guard Andre Miller are eligible for such extensions. The
team is focused on re-signing only Olowokandi and Brand before Oct.
31, however. Talks with Brand's agent, David Falk, continue.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi averaged career bests of 11.1 points and 8.9 rebounds
last season. "He's not upset," Duffy said of Olowokandi. "He was more
emphatic" that a contract be signed by Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Duffy said talks have progressed to the point that a deal could
soon be struck, but he also said Clipper owner Donald Sterling must
give the final OK.</TE>
<TE>   "My take on it is that across the entire organization there is a
desire and a willingness to sign Michael," Duffy said. "You can't
hold [General Manager] Elgin Baylor and [Clipper vice president] Andy
Roeser accountable. It comes down to one individual. Mr. Sterling has
expressed a desire to keep this team together and to pay his players
fairly.... There's only one individual who can dictate everything."</TE>
<TE>   There would be a lengthy list of potential suitors if Olowokandi
were to rule out re-signing with the Clippers next summer, starting
perhaps with the New York Knicks, who have coveted a 7-foot center
since trading Patrick Ewing to the Seattle SuperSonics more than two
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in the next few years the top three centers in the league
will be Shaq [O'Neal], Michael and Yao Ming," Duffy said. "I don't
see any Michael Olowokandis coming along around the globe. I don't
know who you would draft to replace Michael Olowokandi."</TE>
<TE>   Part of what makes Olowokandi so valuable is his rapid progress
last season. To outsiders, he had been something of a disappointment
in his first few seasons, playing without much passion after being
selected first overall in the 1998 draft.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' patience paid off, with the help of intensive
tutoring from assistant coach Igor Kokoskov and the addition of Brand
in a trade last summer. Olowokandi, who played in only 77 organized
basketball games by Duffy's tally before being drafted from Pacific,
emerged as a force in the middle of last season.</TE>
<TE>   "The Clippers have done a good job of coaching him," Duffy said.
"He's responded well. If you were to conduct the 1998 draft again,
arguably the only player you would take ahead of Michael is Dirk
Nowitzki [of the Dallas Mavericks]."</TE>

<HD>Slumping Beltre Goes to the Bench</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Somewhere inside third baseman Adrian Beltre is what Dodger batting
instructor Jack Clark describes as a "magical swing," a short, quick
and powerful stroke that Beltre often displays in the batting cage.
But when the games begin, that swing magically disappears.</LD>
<LD>   "For some reason he doesn't trust it enough to take it out there
with him," Clark said. "It's unbelievable the different kinds of
swings and the bat control he has, but when he goes out there, he
takes that big swing.... I want him to hit, not just swing."</LD>
<LD>   Beltre has done plenty of swinging and virtually no hitting
lately. Mired in a one-for-34 slump, with no runs batted in, one run,
one walk and nine strikeouts in his last eight games, Beltre was
benched in favor of Tyler Houston on Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Beltre was so hot after the All-Star break, batting .370 with
eight homers, nine doubles, 29 runs batted in and 29 runs in 35
games, Tracy moved him to the third and fourth spots in the order in
early August. But Beltre has slipped into some old, bad habits,
swinging for the fences, swinging at too many bad pitches, and trying
to pull too many balls to left. His average fell from .273 to .258.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you need the two-run home run, and to his credit, he
takes a shot at it," Clark said. "Sometimes, he takes two or three
shots at it.... You don't have to look for the big hurt all the time.
Use the whole field and try to find a happy medium, where you're a
little more under control. When he does that, he's really good."</TE>
<TE>   When he doesn't, he looks lost, a fact that is not lost on
opposing pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   "They expand the [strike] zone on him," Clark said. "You can see
them going up and out of the zone and down in the dirt. He has to be
patient. If a pitcher beats you, fine, but you don't want to see him
get himself out."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy praised Beltre for not letting his slump affect
his defense--Beltre has two errors since the All-Star break--but he
believes Beltre is trying too hard at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "That comes from realizing what's at stake for this club and how
little time there is left in the season, and as a young player, he's
trying to get it fixed way too fast," Tracy said. "You start to see
the body language of a player who is really searching, and that's
when you need to give him a chance to step away."</TE>
<TE>   What Beltre is searching for, he isn't sure. Asked what the
difference is between his swing now and two weeks ago, Beltre said:
"I have no idea. I'm seeing the ball good, swinging and missing.
Obviously, something is missing, but it's not like I feel lost at the
plate."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby, who missed his last start because of an infection on
the middle finger of his throwing hand, threw 50-60 pitches during a
bullpen workout Friday and declared himself fit to start Sunday
against the Rockies.... An MRI test on Kazuhisa Ishii's fractured
skull was normal, and Ishii, who is out for the season after being
hit in the head by a line drive Sunday, was released from the
hospital Friday.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There are a couple of angles that point to Sigfreto in this
afternoon's feature, the $50,000 Phil D. Shepherd Stakes.</LD>
<LD>   You hear "horse for the course" thrown around frequently by
handicappers, and nowhere on the Southern California circuit is it
more applicable than around these tight turns. With an emphatic
victory in the Pomona Derby here last season, Sigfreto certainly
fills the bill. In fact, he and J T's Song are the only members of
the cast to have posed for pictures locally.</LD>
<LD>   The Doug Peterson trainee is also making his third start off a
vacation that had him sitting out from mid-January to early August.</LD>
<TE>   Sigfreto's biggest challenge could come from Most Likely, who was
claimed for $80,000 last month by Bruce Headley, and the prodigal son
Sign Of Fire, who travels 3,000 miles in search of a hat trick.</TE>
<TE>   The 12th race features another matchup between mules Black Ruby
and Taz.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Touso Ishto. 2. The Grind. 3. Sideshow Caper. 4.
Shutlin. 5. Barron H. 6. Splendid Mover. 7. Missionairess. 8. Pass
The Reality. 9. Streets Of Laredo. 10. Sigfreto. 11. Primacy. 12.

<HD>A Career Night for Vargas and De La Hoya</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>All the miles of roadwork have been run, all the wood has been
chopped, all the sparring partners have been pummeled, all the
promises of pain and punishment have been made, all the insults have
been uttered and all the hot air of the prefight hype has been
expended.</LD>
<LD>   In a few hours, the supporting cast--the promoters and managers
and trainers and cut men and sparring partners and publicists and
writers and broadcasters and pay-per-view hucksters and
hangers-on--will fade into the background and only Oscar De La Hoya
and Fernando Vargas will remain in the spotlight, finally squaring
off at the Mandalay Bay Events Center for their long-awaited battle.</LD>
<LD>   Everybody wants to know the answer to the big question: Who will
win?</LD>
<TE>   But first, everybody needs to know the answers to nine other
important questions.</TE>
<TE>   * Officially, what is at stake tonight?</TE>
<TE>   The World Boxing Council and World Boxing Assn. 154-pound titles.</TE>
<TE>   * And unofficially?</TE>
<TE>   The career prospects for both men. A victory by De La Hoya in his
first match against a credible opponent in more than two years puts
him in position to avenge losses to Felix Trinidad, if Trinidad can
be lured out of retirement, and Shane Mosley and realize the
greatness long predicted for him. A victory by Vargas would put him
among the elite nonheavyweights. A loss by De La Hoya might mean
retirement. At 29, he has a fortune safely invested, a wife who would
prefer to see him hang up his gloves and the option of a singing
career. A loss for Vargas, 24, would mean a long road back, but he
would still have the youth and determination to travel it.</TE>
<TE>   * Where can this fight be seen?</TE>
<TE>   All 11,425 seats in the Mandalay Bay Events Center have been sold.
The fight is available on pay-per-view and in 700 closed-circuit
locations in 40 states, including 300 in Southern California. It is
also being shown in 57 other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Or--here's the worst-kept secret in television--it will be
available on noncommercial cable television one week from tonight.
HBO and Showtime desperately guard the fact major fights are replayed
seven days later on their networks. After years of sticking to that
schedule, television executives can't really think they are fooling
fans into buying the fight on a now-or-never basis, can they?</TE>
<TE>   * Who's on the undercard?</TE>
<TE>   A group of fighters only an aficionado could appreciate. The days
when promoters spend money on undercard fighters are over, concedes
Bob Arum, one of the promoters of tonight's event.</TE>
<TE>   There is one quality match on the undercard, pitting Miguel Cotto
(11-0, nine knockouts) of Puerto Rico, who lost his only bout in the
2000 Olympics, against credible veteran John Brown (23-9, 11) in a
10-round super-lightweight bout.</TE>
<TE>   There will also be a North American Boxing Federation
super-featherweight title match between champion Nate Campbell (21-0,
19) and challenger Daniel Alicea (27-4-2, 20).</TE>
<TE>   * How much will De La Hoya and Vargas make?</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya is guaranteed $14 million, Vargas $6 million, with both
expected to make even more based on pay-per-view guarantees.</TE>
<TE>   * How many pay-per-view buys are expected?</TE>
<TE>   The record is approximately two million for the Lennox Lewis-Mike
Tyson heavyweight title match earlier this year. The record for a
nontitle match is 1.4 million for De La Hoya-Trinidad in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   This fight won't do nearly as well as either of those, but the
2000 match between De La Hoya and Mosley drew 588,000 and
pay-per-view executives believe this fight will exceed that, but may
not do as well as the 1997 match between De La Hoya and Pernell
Whitaker, which drew 765,000.</TE>
<TE>   * What were the numbers at Friday's weigh-in?</TE>
<TE>   Both fighters came in at exactly 154 pounds, and both, true to
their word, appeared to be in excellent shape.</TE>
<TE>   * What are the keys to the fight?</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya's left hand and Vargas' chin. This fight was postponed
once because of De La Hoya's lingering problems with his bruised
hand. He insists that hand, his primary weapon, has been pain-free in
training camp. Vargas must prove that the five knockdowns he suffered
in December 2000 against Trinidad did not leave him damaged goods.</TE>
<TE>   * What must each fighter do to win?</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya must use his superior speed, footwork and boxing
ability to pile up points and stay out of harm's way. Vargas must
lure De La Hoya into a brawl where Vargas' superior punching power
could prove decisive.</TE>
<TE>   * Finally, who will win?</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya. With trainer Floyd Mayweather Sr. to keep him on a
steady course, De La Hoya, while lacking the power to stop Vargas,
will cruise to an easy decision.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marshall Martinez of Ontario fought to a majority draw with Luis
Arceo of Tijuana Friday night in a six-round lightweight bout at
Mandalay Bay. Two of the three judges scored the fight even.</TE>

<LD>Mirror, mirror on the wall....</LD>
<LD>   Terrific home records. Terrible road records. All this and more
means a deadlock at the top of the MLS Western Conference between the
Galaxy and the San Jose Earthquakes. The teams are separated by the
narrowest of margins: a plus-three goal differential puts San Jose in
front.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight at the Rose Bowl, the Galaxy will play its final
regular-season home game, and the first of a pivotal home-and-home
series with the Earthquakes.</LD>
<TE>   The back end of the series--which will determine home-field
advantage for the playoffs--will be a week from today at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be one of the biggest games that we've played in L.A.
in the regular season," Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy, unbeaten at home (8-0-1) since June 8, is at a
disadvantage. The consistent starting lineup of the last 10 games
will be disrupted because of the suspensions of defenders Alexi Lalas
and Ezra Hendrickson. The resurgent Lalas is the team's
second-leading scorer behind league leader Carlos Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   Schmid said defender Craig Waibel will be in the back in place of
Lalas. Sasha Victorine and Adam Frye may replace Hendrickson.</TE>
<TE>   One continuing thread of the Galaxy season has been the ability to
score the late goal. They have scored 16 of their 42 goals after the
75th minute, the highest total in the league ahead of Colorado (15).</TE>
<TE>   Another constant has been Ruiz, who has 22 goals and one assist
for 45 points and is trying to become the first Galaxy player to win
the league scoring championship.</TE>

<HD>Fury and Soundness</HD>
<DH>Trainer and father-figure Garcia helped Vargas harness his
anger and make it work for him in the ring</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eduardo Garcia had seen this kind before, a street kid with an
attitude and a penchant for fighting.</LD>
<LD>   So it was no wonder that Garcia, a respected longtime boxing
trainer, paid little attention to 10-year-old Fernando Vargas when
the angry young pup came strutting into Oxnard's La Colonia boxing
club. A dime a dozen, Garcia thought, until he saw something in the
fuming youngster that surprised even him--ganas. Desire.</LD>
<LD>   Vargas, in desperate need of someone to help harness his rage, a
fury born of a broken home in an Oxnard barrio, would walk five miles
from his home for his workout, then trudge the five miles back home.</LD>
<TE>   Finally one day, Garcia offered him a ride.</TE>
<TE>   It was the start of a relationship that not only propelled Vargas
to the Olympics and a pair of world championships, but also gave him
a father figure, a stabilizing influence.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia will be in Vargas' corner tonight when the World Boxing
Assn. super-welterweight champion meets World Boxing Council champion
Oscar De La Hoya at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in a 154-pound
unification bout, the biggest fight of Vargas' career.</TE>
<TE>   "God puts people in your path in life so you can learn from them
or just experience life with them," Vargas said. "As a kid, I was
always in trouble. I was very angry because my father wasn't there.
My stepfather was a [jerk] and my mother ... sided with him. I was
always in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "But Eduardo Garcia, he's the father I never had. He's taught me
how to be a man inside and outside the ring."</TE>
<TE>   As a young man, Garcia would often come north from Michoacan,
Mexico, looking for work. He found it on the docks of the L.A. harbor
and in the fields of the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   As a youngster, his athletic love was soccer. When he was 14,
though, and with his family one day in Guadalajara, he noticed that a
church was holding a boxing show as a fund-raiser. One problem--there
weren't enough boxers.</TE>
<TE>   A God-fearing youth who wanted to help the church, Garcia laced up
the gloves, jumped in the ring and fell in love with the sweet
science.</TE>
<TE>   When he came to the United States for good in 1964, he began
training fighters. And years later, he found Vargas.</TE>
<TE>   "Fernando was a cocky little guy, but he had a lot of talent,"
said Garcia, 57, who still speaks only in Spanish. "He was strong and
had a lot of interest. He ... wanted to learn, so I taught him."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas, the second-oldest of three brothers and two sisters, has
had a chip on his shoulder for as long as he can remember.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been an underdog since I came out of the womb," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said his biological father left the family "before I was born,"
and refers to him as a "maggot." He uses similarly colorful language
to describe his stepfather.</TE>
<TE>   Bitter at being virtually fatherless in his formative years,
Vargas became a schoolyard bully.</TE>
<TE>   On one of the numerous days he was home on school suspension,
Vargas happened upon an amateur boxing show on local cable. Kids his
age and younger were duking it out--and being praised.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas was inspired and began his life-altering walks to La
Colonia that afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just like I had found gold," Vargas said. "I didn't know
kids could box. I mean, I was like, 'I love to fight. I want some of
those trophies.' "</TE>
<TE>   Under Garcia's tutelage, he got plenty of them, compiling an
amateur record of 100-5 and earning a reputation as an up-and-comer
who had great things awaiting him in the ring ... if he could steer
clear of trouble out of the ring.</TE>
<TE>   He still isn't always able to do that--he is on probation after
having pleaded no contest in an assault case--but he says he has
matured. And Garcia still is there to help.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, man, if he hadn't met my dad that day and not gone straight
to the gym, Fernando would have ended up locked up or even dead,"
said Garcia's son Robert, a former junior-lightweight champion. "He
was a little troublemaker going in the wrong direction."</TE>
<TE>   A gold medal was predicted for the 18-year-old Vargas at the 1996
Olympics in Atlanta, a feat that would have mirrored the
accomplishment of De La Hoya at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   But Vargas, fighting at 147 pounds, lost a controversial decision,
8-7, to Romania's Marian Simion in the second round of the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   A distraught Vargas sought Garcia's counsel.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me not to worry about it, to not let it get me down. 'Voy
a llenar su estomago,' " Vargas said. " 'I'm going to fill your
stomach with gold,' he told me."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia was telling his eager pupil that better days lay ahead.
"I'm very happy with our relationship," Garcia said. "He respects me
as a father and I respect him as a son. There is nothing but respect
between us so I can be honest with him."</TE>
<TE>   It took Vargas 15 fights to win his first title, beating Yory Boy
Campas into submission and taking his International Boxing Federation
junior-middleweight title on Dec. 12, 1998, in Atlantic City.</TE>
<TE>   A run-in with his management team ensued.</TE>
<TE>   Main Events, which had signed Vargas when he turned pro, had
brought in Lou Duva to share training duties with Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas was uncomfortable with the move but kept quiet--until he
sensed Garcia being pushed aside.</TE>
<TE>   An irate Vargas fired Duva shortly thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   "When they tried to cut out Garcia, they got cut," Vargas said.
Duva has since said that he never tried to push Garcia out, that
Vargas was surrounded by yes-men who were threatened by Duva's strong
personality.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, Vargas' reaction wasn't surprising. His loyalty to
Garcia had already been proven.</TE>
<TE>   Before signing with Main Events, Vargas had rejected a reported
$2-million offer from International Marketing Group because, he said,
the group wanted him to move to Miami and sever his ties to Oxnard
and Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Then in May this year, Vargas questioned the commitment of
co-trainer Roger Bloodworth, who had been in the Vargas camp since
1997, and fired him, leaving the full training load for Vargas'
biggest payday--$6 million, plus a share of the pay-per-view take--to
Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas, who said he has no written contract with Garcia, wouldn't
have it any other way. Besides, he said, Garcia has taught Vargas how
to be a father to his own two boys, Fernando Jr., 5, and Amado, 2.</TE>
<TE>   "Without him in my life, a lot of people would have been hurt
because I was so angry," Vargas said. "He will always be my trainer,
my father."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Is Out to Prove That It's Still No. 1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. women had enough of a burden trying to defend their title in
the 2002 FIBA Women's World Basketball Championship that begins today
in China.</LD>
<LD>   Now there is added pressure thanks to the stumbling performance by
the U.S. men's team, which lost three of its last four games and
finished sixth in the recent world tournament in Indianapolis.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not anything really spoken, but as individuals we're feeling
[the pressure]," said DeLisha Milton, one of three Spark players on
the 12-woman USA Basketball squad. "For the men to fall three times,
it was unheard of. We don't want that to happen. We don't want the
ridicule back home."</LD>
<TE>   The gap that has narrowed between the U.S. men and the rest of the
world is also closing in the women's game. At least, that is what the
rest of the world hopes to prove over the next two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   There are 16 teams in the 2002 FIBA tournament, which will be
played in nine Chinese cities from today through Sept. 25. Team USA
is in Group C along with Russia, Lithuania and Chinese Taipei. The
Americans open against Russia in Zhangjiagang.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve top-flight WNBA players comprise the U.S. team. Besides
Milton, Tamecka Dixon and Lisa Leslie of the Sparks, the USA roster
has league most valuable player Sheryl Swoopes (Houston), Sue Bird
(Seattle), Tamika Catchings (Indiana), Jennifer Gillom (Phoenix),
Shannon Johnson (Orlando), Tari Phillips (New York), Katie Smith
(Minnesota), Dawn Staley (Charlotte) and Natalie Williams (Utah).</TE>
<TE>   They will see some familiar faces in opposing uniforms. Brazil has
six WNBA players, including Spark reserve center Erika DeSouza.
Australia has four WNBA players; France, Russia and Yugoslavia have
two each, and Senegal has one.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has a 71-20 record and has won six championships since
the FIBA tournament began in 1953. But since 1986 the Americans have
been dominant, winning three of four tournaments while going 31-1. In
their three gold medal-winning years--1986, 1990 and 1998--they were
undefeated (24-0).</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Americans can maintain that level of superiority in
this tournament remains to be seen. They are not lacking confidence,
however, after sweeping through the Opals World Challenge last week
in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Milton warned against complacency, though.</TE>
<TE>   "Internationally, the game has changed," she said. "Now [the rest
of the world is] just as athletic, plays smart basketball and is very
physical. Athleticism can get you so far. But when you can look at
teammates and know what's going on without having to think, that
outweighs athleticism."</TE>

<HD>Laffit the Horse a Big Winner Too</HD>
<DH>Fairplex: Legendary jockey's namesake victorious at 12-1 in
Foothill Stakes. Crowd of 8,250 for opener.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An appearance by Laffit Pincay at Fairplex Park in Pomona is as rare
as the cotton-candy stand running out of the pink sweet stuff. The
Hall of Fame jockey, who didn't ride at the Los Angeles County Fair
at all last year, only occasionally drops in, and made some noise
there five years ago when he won a pair of stakes.</LD>
<LD>   Resting after a successful Del Mar season, Pincay isn't expected
to ride at the marathon 17-day Pomona run that started Friday, but
his namesake arrived at Fairplex with both barrels blazing. Named
after Pincay by his Canadian owner, Laffit the 3-year-old colt gunned
down four rivals through the track's 660-foot stretch to win the
Foothill Stakes by one length over From A To Z. The opening-day crowd
was estimated at 8,250.</LD>
<LD>   Laffit, owned by James Whyte and trained by Frank Olivares, who
used to ride against Pincay, paid $26.40 to win as he ended an
eight-race losing streak and won for the first time in almost six
months.</LD>
<TE>   Mighty David, the 3-2 favorite, finished seventh. The stewards
disallowed a foul claim by Mighty David's jockey, Martin Pedroza,
against From A To Z and Pickled Bay, the fourth-place finisher.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Iggy Puglisi, Laffit completed 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:16
1/5.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of trouble in the race," Puglisi said. "When we
got to the [three-sixteenths pole], horses started to bunch up, and
this is a tight racetrack. I was sitting right behind those horses,
so once we got past that trouble point, I kind of angled my horse to
the outside."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Black Ruby is 2-5 and Taz is even money for their $10,000,
winner-take-all mule match race that concludes today's card.</TE>
<TE>   This will be the first mule race in the 64-year racing history of
the fair. Last Sunday at Del Mar, in the first mule race ever staged
there, Black Ruby beat Taz by two lengths, for the 10-year-old's 48th
win in 55 starts. Black Ruby's only loss this year came at
Sacramento, where Taz, with an eight-pound weight advantage, won by a
head on Aug. 24.</TE>
<TE>   The mules carried equal weights in the non-betting race at Del
Mar, but Taz, an 8-year-old, will have a five-pound edge in the
weights today.</TE>
<TE>   There will be win betting at Fairplex.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Mike Mitchell, who beat Grey Memo with Literal Prowler in
last year's Phil D. Shepherd, will try to win the stake again today
with J.T.'s Song, a 5-year-old gelding that he claimed by Del Mar for
$50,000 last month.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Woodland Hills Taft is nowhere as good as it can be, according to
Coach Troy Starr. But if the Toreadors are much better than they
showed Friday afternoon against Crenshaw, that could be an ominous
sign for the rest of their opponents.</LD>
<LD>   Running back Ian Bell rushed for 145 yards and two touchdowns in
his first game for Taft, and quarterback Cary Dove threw for 237
yards and three touchdowns in a 38-26 nonleague victory over the
Cougars in a season opener at Crenshaw.</LD>
<LD>   Taft, No. 10 in The Times' preseason rankings, took the lead in
the second quarter and kept a solid advantage throughout the second
half in a rematch of last season's City Section semifinal. But the
victory was about the only thing that pleased Starr.</LD>
<TE>   "We're light years away from what we can be," Starr said. "We're
so far away from being a good football team. But we'll take the win.
They're a tough team."</TE>
<TE>   Bell, who transferred from Pasadena Muir in late July, had a
strong debut. The junior gave Taft a 21-8 lead with a one-yard
scoring run midway through the third quarter. He then ran up the
right sideline for a 40-yard touchdown late in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a perfect debut, however, as he lost a fumble in the
third quarter that Crenshaw cashed in for six points to stay in the
game. But Bell provided what the Toreadors hoped for--another threat
in an already prolific offensive attack.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a few times where he was an eyelash away from popping
one," Starr said. "He's just going to keep getting better."</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw took an 8-0 lead on quarterback Bryant Thompson's 31-yard
option keeper and Daymeion Hughes' conversion.</TE>
<TE>   Taft came back on a 37-yard scoring pass play from Dove to Steve
Smith and pulled ahead before halftime when the quarterback beat a
linebacker blitz and connected with Paul Pratt on a 35-yard scoring
play.</TE>
<TE>   Dove's third scoring pass, an eight-yarder to Noah Smith, followed
a 44-yard touchdown pass play from Thompson to Hughes that cut Taft's
lead to 21-14.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew they were going to try to get to us," Dove said of
Crenshaw's aggressiveness. "We kept our composure and played our
game."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Smith caught six passes for 124 yards and also had an
interception on defense. Hughes ran for 59 yards and caught 11 passes
for 166 yards and three touchdowns, but the Cougars ultimately fell
short.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Dorsey 24, Sylmar 17--Ryen Carew of Sylmar rushed for 217
yards and a 76-yard touchdown in 27 carries for the host Spartans,
but two fourth-quarter drives ended at the 40-yard line and the
defending City champion Dons held on for a nonleague victory.</TE>
<TE>   Jody Rucks of Dorsey rushed for 182 yards in 17 carries and scored
on a 59-yard run on the Dons' first play from scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey scored 18 points in the second quarter, highlighted by a
35-yard interception return for a touchdown by George Harris. Joey
Rucks returned a blocked field-goal attempt 90 yards as time expired
in the first half to give Dorsey a 24-14 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey quarterback Donald Prince completed five of eight passes
for 93 yards and a 25-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   John Klima</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks Notre Dame 24, Lake Balboa Birmingham 20--Collin
Morgan scored on a 10-yard run with 44 seconds to play, and Cary
Harris intercepted Ryan Lombardo's desperation pass as time expired
to give the host Knights the intersectional victory in a season
opener for both teams.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Keyes scored on a 60-yard run with 6:55 left in the third
quarter to give the No. 22 Patriots a 20-9 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Marcel Marquez scored on a five-yard run three minutes
later, and Mike Allen kicked a 37-yard field goal to pull Notre Dame
to within 20-18.</TE>
<TE>   Lombardo completed 17 of 27 passes for 321 yards with two
interceptions. Chad Green caught five passes for 116 yards and one
touchdown for Birmingham.</TE>

<LD>Mission Viejo quarterback Josh Rodarmel, who left the Diablos' 48-0
victory Thursday over Fountain Valley in the first half, will likely
to be sidelined five weeks because of a broken collarbone.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a clean, simple fracture of the clavicle," said Marty
Spalding, Mission Viejo's offensive line coach. "They are talking
five or six weeks before he can participate. We were all thinking he
would be out for the year, but it's still intact."</LD>
<LD>   Rodarmel completed six of his first seven passes for 103 yards,
and two touchdowns. He also had one pass intercepted. Rodarmel played
an additional four downs with the broken collarbone and during that
time he had two incomplete passes.</LD>
<TE>   "[Offensive coordinator] Bret Johnson's brother, Rob [quarterback
for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers], broke his clavicle last year,"
Spalding said. "Bret was talking to Rob, and Rob told Bret, 'If the
kid can throw two passes after breaking his clavicle, he must be one
of the toughest guys on the planet.' "</TE>
<TE>   Matt Uritas completed one of three passes for no yards in relief
of Rodarmel. Sixth-ranked Mission Viejo plays No. 7 Mater Dei on
Friday at Santa Ana Stadium.</TE>

<TE>   Glenn Marx has resigned after 13 seasons as boys' basketball coach

<TE>   Marx, 51, amassed 382 victories as coach at Mira Costa and Playa
del Rey St. Bernard. He also served as an assistant coach at USC,
Hawaii and Brown. Marx will continue to teach at Mira Costa.</TE>

<TE>   Jeremiah Tupuola, a 14-year-old freshman at Encino Crespi who
collapsed at a football game Thursday, was released from Childrens
Hospital Los Angeles on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Tupuola had participated in some plays before he collapsed on the
field and lost consciousness for about two minutes, an L.A. Fire
Dept. spokesman said. He was airlifted to Childrens Hospital, where
his condition went from serious to fair Thursday evening, a hospital
spokesman said.</TE>

<DH>Jordan trying to emerge from shadow cast by Long Beach Poly</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regardless of the score in its opener, it looks like that high school
in Long Beach is going to be pretty good in football this season.
Some big-time prospects are coming up through the ranks, the team was
rated high in the preseason polls, and fans are expecting a winner.</LD>
<LD>   Surprisingly, the school is not Poly.</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach Jordan, a longtime also-ran in the Moore League, was
ranked No. 4 in the Southern Section Division I preseason poll, based
primarily on its 15-6 record the last two seasons.</LD>
<TE>   Jordan lost its opener Friday night, 32-22, to Carson, another
highly regarded team, but Coach Willie Guillory and Co. have no
reason to fret. The Panthers lost their opener last season, too--by
10, to Carson--and by the end of the season were battling toe to toe
with Santa Ana Mater Dei in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   That noted, it's difficult to overcome an inferiority complex when
the folks 3 1/2 miles away churn out college players like few other
schools in the nation. Twenty-five Poly players are on NCAA football
teams, six are in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, on the other hand, has sent a handful of players to
four-year colleges ... in the last two decades. The best known is
probably quarterback Ortege Jenkins, who led Jordan's last victory
over Poly, in 1994, then played for Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   It's tough, however, to overlook Jordan's progress the last few
years, an upturn in fortune that has coincided with the arrival of
Guillory, a former police officer.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't too long ago that Guillory and assistant John Kane used
to canvas the Jordan campus, begging anybody over 5 foot 7 to play
football.</TE>
<TE>   Now, kids walk up to them, asking if they can be part of the
program. A surprising turnaround for a school that has a rough time
competing against Poly, particularly with the setup of the Long Beach
Unified School District. The district allows students to attend any
of the five Moore League schools within district boundaries, assuming
space is available at the school of choice.</TE>
<TE>   The quarterback at Poly last season, Brandon Brooks, lived down
the street from Jordan but took the bus to Poly every day.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan will play Poly in the 10th and final regular season game
this year.</TE>
<TE>   One person on the Jordan campus is particularly familiar with
Poly's success: Principal Greg Mendoza. He was an assistant coach on
the Poly basketball team that won the Southern Section Division 5-AA
championship in 1990 with Willie McGinest and Tyus Edney.</TE>
<TE>   When Mendoza arrived at Jordan six years ago, there were no
blocking sleds, no tackling dummies, no equipment bags for the
football team.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza increased funding for the athletic department and hired
Guillory a year later.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel like there's room in Long Beach for two powerhouses,"
Mendoza said. "This area is so rich with talent it's amazing. If we
keep all the kids in our attendance area, we'll be all right. We
haven't lost any [incoming freshmen to Poly] that I know of in the
last three years, and it's starting to show."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's freshman team defeated Poly last season, 26-20.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan threw a scare into Poly last season and trailed, 27-20,
heading into the fourth quarter. But Poly dominated the last 12
minutes en route to a 41-20 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like every year they're maybe getting closer to beating
us, and that's a concern," Poly Coach Raul Lara said. "They have good
athletes that can compete with us."</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Jordan has a few things to work on. In the first half
against Carson, the Panthers had 11 penalties and gained only 85
yards. Carson, which has won 10 City championships, got a 117-yard
rushing performance from Brandon Myles in only five carries. He
scored on runs of 47 and 48 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to panic," Guillory said. "Why should I? We'll get
it going again, just like we did last season. All we have to do is
mature."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Jordan's football team emulates the rest of the school in
struggling through growing pains.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan lags behind Poly--and the rest of the Moore
League--academically.</TE>
<TE>   Of the five LBUSD schools in the Moore League--Jordan, Poly,
Wilson, Lakewood and Millikan--Jordan had the lowest SAT scores of
college-bound seniors in 2000. The average SAT score at Jordan was
847, according to LBUSD documents. College-bound seniors at Poly, on
the other hand, posted a 994 SAT average, the highest in the Moore
League.</TE>
<TE>   "When I came here, people said to me, 'Are you sure you want to go
to that school? That school where they don't learn? That school where
all the kids end up leaving for Poly?' " said Guillory, in his fifth
season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a struggle. Every day I have to defend my program. Defend my
kids. Defend my school. But I've been dealing with crisis all my
life. I'm a sharecropper's son. I'm not afraid to say I grew up in
the thicket, in the swamp. If I can make it, so can they."</TE>
<TE>   Guillory, 49, was raised in Leton, La., a small rural town 35
miles east of Shreveport. He moved with his older brother to Los
Angeles and played on the 1971 City Section championship team at
Carson. He was an All-City linebacker for the Colts.</TE>
<TE>   He worked for 13 years at Carson as an on-campus police officer
and assistant football coach, but said he retired because of knee and
shoulder injuries he suffered in 1994 while scaling a fence in
pursuit of a person with a gun.</TE>
<TE>   Guillory came out of retirement, worked as an assistant at Compton
Centennial for a couple years, and was hired as head football coach
at Jordan in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of a practice this week, Guillory saw a wide-body
youngster walking around the track in a white T-shirt. With a little
work in the weight room, the coach envisioned a future lineman.</TE>
<TE>   "Come over here young man," Guillory yelled. And then, "You're
going to have to hustle," as the boy started to amble toward him.</TE>
<TE>   The boy ran the rest of the way, and Guillory draped an arm around
him.</TE>
<TE>   "Where you going to junior high?" the coach asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Hamilton," the boy said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll see you next year then," Guillory said, patting a shoulder.
"You're going to play football for us, right?"</TE>
<TE>   The boy smiled and nodded, and the coach sent him on his way.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton Middle School is a feeder school for Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he wants to play for us," Guillory said proudly.</TE>
<TE>   Another prospect staying home.</TE>

<HD>Hart Wings It in Tie With Los Alamitos</HD>
<DH>Football: A last-second, 63-yard pass play gives the No. 8
Indians a 21-21 tie after the No. 2 Griffins rally for lead with 28
seconds to play.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not often Coach Mike Herrington will let a penalty slide,
especially one that could have cost his Newhall Hart High football
team a victory.</LD>
<LD>   But when his players stormed the field and were flagged for
excessive celebration Friday night in their season opener against Los
Alamitos, ranked No. 2 in The Times' preseason rankings, Herrington
simply smiled with the rest of them and changed the next play.</LD>
<LD>   Hart receiver Cody Kase had just hauled in a desperation pass from
Sean Norton for a touchdown to pull Hart within one as time expired.
What would have been a two-point attempt to win the game turned into
a 35-yard extra point attempt. Will Simons drilled the kick through
the uprights, ending the game in a 21-21 tie at Veterans Stadium in
Long Beach.</LD>
<TE>   Herrington said Hart, ranked No. 8, would have gone for two had
the 15-yard penalty not been assessed.</TE>
<TE>   "We already had the play called," Herrington said. "But you can't
fault the kids. We don't really go over that in practice. It's not
something we work on, telling players not to rush the field if we
score on the last play of the game and still need the extra point."</TE>
<TE>   The desperation play at the end, called Big Ben, is something they
work on, however. Norton, making his Hart debut, lofted the ball from
his own 37. The ball bounced off two defenders and Kase, who didn't
break stride, grabbed it and raced in for a 63-yard score.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a dream," Kase said. "I was like 'Oh my God.' "</TE>
<TE>   Moments earlier, the game appeared to be a nightmare in the making
for Hart. The Indians had taken a 14-13 lead with 3:43 to play, but
Los Alamitos (0-1) drove 80 yards in 11 plays, capped by a one-yard
touchdown run by Randy Estes that gave the Griffins a 19-14 lead with
28 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   A two-point conversion pass from Justin Elway to Brandon Tripp
gave Los Alamitos its 21-14 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Overtime was not an option because Herrington had vetoed an extra
period when referees asked him before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to do that in a meaningless game," Herrington said.
"We have a long way to go in the season and this is the first game.
We don't need our guys to go through that. To us, tying a game like
this is a win."</TE>
<TE>   Norton, who follows a long line of standout Hart quarterbacks,
completed 17 of 28 passes for 245 yards and two touchdowns. Both came
in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos came up with several big plays on offense but had
trouble capitalizing when it got close. Twice in the first half, the
Griffins were inside the Hart 30, but all they got out of those
possessions was a 25-yard field goal by Kevin Gamarnik with 24
seconds left in the half for a 10-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Bagley led Los Alamitos with 109 yards in 22 carries and the
Griffin defense dominated most of the game until the final moments,
holding Hart to 74 yards in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy with the way we played," Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes
said. "I think we're going to be a decent football team. We pretty
much shut them out most of the game and they got one at the end."</TE>
<TE>   The tie extends Hart's unbeaten streak to 24 games.</TE>

<LD>San Clemente's defense was so inexperienced at the start of fall
practice that even seniors such as outside linebacker Aubrey McCravey
were having seconds thoughts about the season opener against No. 5
Huntington Beach Edison, which would already have a game under its
belt.</LD>
<LD>   Not to worry. San Clemente, No. 23 in The Times' preseason
rankings, is going to be just fine. The Triton defense used a
bend-but-don't-break approach, and a touchdown reception and field
goals of 45 and 43 yards by multipurpose standout Chris Miller to
stop Edison, 13-10, Friday night at Huntington Beach High.</LD>
<LD>   Quarterback Tommy Grady of No. 5 Edison (0-2) passed for 280 yards
and a late touchdown, but was sacked seven times and chased out of
the pocket several times by the Tritons, who were led by McCravey and
lineman Brian De La Puente.</LD>
<TE>   Grady completed 14 of 30 passes, but was often throwing on the
run, thanks to the secondary coverage of San Clemente (1-0).</TE>
<TE>   Only two games into the season, Edison, which lost to Iolani High
of Honolulu, 34-20, last week, needs to regroup.</TE>
<TE>   "Our defense was really suspect all during the off-season,"
McCravey said. "We lost eight starters, we only had three returning
players and a bunch of young kids."</TE>
<TE>   Edison had a few moments in the first half during which it looked
as if it would live up to its advanced billing. On the third play of
the Chargers' second drive, Grady connected with Matt White on a
75-yard pass play that gave Edison a first down at the San Clemente
14-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   But the drive stalled when two of Grady's passes were dropped, and
all the Chargers could come away with was a 28-yard field goal by
left-footed Dominik Bronowicki with 5 minutes 50 seconds left in the
first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers had a golden opportunity again about five minutes
later, marching 80 yards in 11 plays to the Triton two. But it was
backward from there. In the next six plays, Grady was sacked for six
yards in losses and two would-be Edison touchdown passes were called
back because of penalties. The Chargers came up empty when
Bronowicki's 33-yard field goal attempt sailed left.</TE>
<TE>   A 37-yard punt return by Travis Weber gave San Clemente a first
down at the Edison 16-yard line on its opening possession of the
second half. A play later, Edison defensive back Travis Simon was
called for pass interference on San Clemente's Miller at the Charger
one. That gave the Tritons a first and goal at the Edison eight.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Beau Budde ran a bootleg to his right on the next play
and completed a touchdown pass to Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Paul McLeod</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   La Puente Bishop Amat 17, Valencia 14--Christopher Seals scored on
a four-yard touchdown run with 1:05 left in the game to give the
Lancers the nonleague victory at Canyon Country Canyon High.</TE>
<TE>   Seals' run capped an 11-play, 73-yard drive that was kept alive
when No. 19 Valencia was penalized five yards for having too many
players on the field when Bishop Amat punted on a fourth-and-four
play from its own 33-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   Valencia (0-1), which had taken a 14-10 lead with 4:44 left in the
game on a 10-yard touchdown pass from Stephen Wright to tight end
Desmond Blair, drove from its own nine-yard line to the Bishop Amat
with 20 seconds remaining. But Wright threw two incomplete passes
before his third pass was intercepted by Michael Shea on the Lancer
20 with two seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Seals, a transfer from La Verne Damien, rushed for 127 yards in 29
carries.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Matthew Lawhorn completed 11 of 19 passes for 133
yards and a 27-yard touchdown pass to Ryan Smith that gave Bishop
Amat (1-0) a 10-7 lead with 11:01 left to play.</TE>
<TE>   Wright completed 10 of 20 passes for 106 yards and two touchdowns
for Valencia, which was playing without four starters who were
suspended for a game by Coach Brian Stiman after they were involved
in an alcohol-related car crash over Labor Day weekend.</TE>
<TE>   John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach Mira Costa 56, North Torrance 28--Standout running
back Michael Okwo suffering from a hip pointer, played only sparingly
on defense, but the 14th-ranked Mustangs (1-0) hardly missed him.</TE>
<TE>   Reserve running back Austin Liggett had 118 yards and three
touchdowns in seven carries, and Tyler Pringle added two more scores
and 50 yards in eight carries in the nonleague game at Manhattan
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The Saxons (0-1) were led by quarterback Lyle Moevao, who
completed eight of 18 passes for one touchdown with two
interceptions. Dionte Harvey gained 86 yards and scored twice in
eight carries.</TE>
<TE>   Rafer Weigel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Corona Centennial 49, Rialto Eisenhower 0--Ray Bass ran for a
nine-yard touchdown, returned a blocked punt 10 yards for a score,
and intercepted two passes to set up two more touchdowns for the No.
17 Huskies in a nonleague victory at Eisenhower.</TE>
<TE>   Terrell Jackson rushed 23 times for 97 yards, almost all in the
first half, and scored three times on runs of one, one and two yards
as Centennial outgained Eisenhower, 272-7, and opened a 37-0 lead,
scoring on its first four drives.</TE>
<TE>   Shaun Lewis completed 14 of 20 passes for 165 yards and a
touchdown, and Ramiro Hernandez caught six passes for 111 yards and a
20-yard score.</TE>

<LD>Picking between the two expected co-favorites tonight in the Go Man
Go Handicap may be among the most difficult bets in the house this
season.</LD>
<LD>   A victory carries an automatic berth into December's $500,000
Champions of Champions. Chiarascuro, winner of the MBNA America
California Challenge, and last year's champion 3-year-old gelding
Whosleavingwho, who has earned $425,088 to date, are expected to be
up to the task in the 400-yard, $100,000 race. But if those two can't
cut it, there are several others in the field that could, such as the
Charlie Treece-trained Rare Coup, who finished third in last month's
Vessels Maturity.</LD>
<LD>   Also entered are Runahalf, who has won five of seven races this
year, recent allowance winner Royal N Rowdy and stakes winner Solar
Dash.</LD>
<TE>   New kid on the block: Trainer Juan Aleman earned his first Grade I
stakes win with Running Bac in the Mildred Vessels Memorial Handicap.
Now he's sending Runahalf to post. Runahalf, sired by Runaway Winner,
has won three times this season, including an impressive victory over
a field of $100,000 claimers by 1 1/4 lengths. His only setback in
the last six starts was at short distance to Classic First, who set a
record time in winning the 220-yard Firecracker Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   No Go Gomez: Trainer Jaime Gomez sent out 13 horses to Friday
night's Pacific Coast Quarter Horse Racing Assn. Futurity. Tonight
he's sending out two quality horses, both in the derby trials, and
none in the Go Man Go. His derby chances rest on Babe Watcher, who
won five of nine starts in 2001, and Sassy Smith, one of the top
two-year olds in the nation last year, earning $380,000. The horses
with the 10 fastest times in the two derby trials advance to the
$117,000 final on Sept. 27.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Scoop Up The Cash, 2. Ano Lani, 3. A Campus Chic, 4.
Vega CS, 5. Aegens Effort, 6. A Blurring Jet, 7. Babe Watcher 8.
Check Him Out, 9. Chiarascuro, 10. With Reflections, 11. Easy Angel
Eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Four: Take class dropper Western Waltz, consistent Scoop Up The
Cash and recent winner I Got Hot Pants in the first. In the second,
double up with Lost Pirate and Ano Lani. In the third, speed will pay
off again for A Campus Chic, and finally, after a long layoff, Vega
CS should do well, as will Sherife USA in the fourth. Cost: $24.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Take Aubrey Rain in the eighth.</TE>

<LD>William W. "Hootie" Johnson, chairman of Augusta National Golf Club,
had heart surgery Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson, 71, was resting comfortably at an undisclosed location
after the planned operation, according to club spokesman Glenn
Greenspan.</LD>
<LD>   Heart surgeons performed a coronary artery bypass, repaired an
aortic aneurysm and replaced an aortic valve during the procedure.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson, who lives in Columbia, S.C., is in his fourth year as
chairman of the club, which opened in 1932. Johnson, who has been in
charge of the Masters since becoming club chairman in 1998, is at the
center of a public dispute over its all-male membership.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bought your Peyton Manning jersey yet? Don't bother.</LD>
<LD>   Ready to wait in line for tickets to see the L.A. Colts play?
Bring a book.</LD>
<LD>   The Colts won't be bolting Indianapolis for the West Coast any
time soon, despite an ESPN report that owner Jim Irsay and his team
could be heading to Los Angeles "faster than people think."</LD>
<TE>   Apparently, if Irsay wants to own a football team in this city, he
might want to look into arena ball.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no appetite for accommodating Jim Irsay in terms of
moving," said an influential NFL owner, who is very familiar with the
league's position on L.A. and spoke Friday on condition of anonymity.
"The appetite could grow to accommodate a sale of that team to
move--without him--to local ownership. Enough is enough with people
who relocate and dislodge and aren't able to make it work in their
own market.</TE>
<TE>   "[L.A. is] too big a market and too important a move to allow it
to fail. The NFL will not permit a situation to occur that's not
right for that market and for the league."</TE>
<TE>   Irsay did not return phone messages for this story and has kept a
low profile since the ESPN report. It's not the first time the
subject has been raised; The Times has reported for almost a year
that Irsay has been eyeing L.A. Their lease keeps the Colts in
Indianapolis at least until 2006, and city officials are convinced
there are no gaping loopholes.</TE>
<TE>   City and Colt officials have talked for months about ways to
bolster the team's revenues, and several options are being
considered. Among them, building a new stadium to replace the RCA
Dome and city payouts to enhance the team's bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN reported the team could move to L.A. as soon as next year.</TE>
<TE>   Not so fast.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing will happen in Los Angeles until the scenario in San
Diego plays itself out," the aforementioned influential owner said,
referring to the Chargers' push to replace aging Qualcomm Stadium,
site of this season's Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "There won't be discussion before the Super Bowl, and nothing
before the post-Super Bowl discussion plays out."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's why the L.A. task force that NFL Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue assembled in May--a group composed of New England's Bob
Kraft, Pittsburgh's Dan Rooney, Cleveland's Carmen Policy, Miami's
Wayne Huizenga and Carolina's Jerry Richardson--has convened only
once--by conference call--and merely had a casual conversation.</TE>
<TE>   The next twist in the L.A. story?</TE>
<TE>   Never mind. Wake me when it's over.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NFL has nixed Manning's request to wear black high-top shoes
against Miami on Sunday in honor of Johnny Unitas, who died of a
heart attack Wednesday. Unitas wore similar shoes throughout his
career.</TE>
<TE>   The league sent out a memo Friday saying no team other than the
Baltimore Ravens will be allowed to wear a patch or armband Sunday in
remembrance of Unitas.</TE>
<TE>   My memo to the league: Lighten up.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it isn't the first time this type of thing has come up.
In 1999, after Walter Payton had died of a liver ailment, several
players, among them Marshall Faulk, wanted to change their jersey
numbers to 34 to honor him. No dice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   They are only Unitas' adopted team, but the Ravens are planning
several tributes to him at Sunday's game.</TE>
<TE>   The marching band will take the field and form a No. 19, then a
video homage will play on the monitors at either end of the stadium.
One of Unitas' former teammates, running back Lenny Moore, will
unveil a blue and white 19 where Unitas used to stand during
games--around the 30-yard line, to the left of the Raven bench. A
pair of his cleats will be placed near the number and will stay there
for the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll do whatever we can to salute him posthumously," said Raven
owner Art Modell, who counted Unitas among his closest friends. "He
was an icon in this town. I can't tell you how much of a beloved
figure he was in Baltimore."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If the Dallas Cowboys are America's Team--a dubious nickname in
the wake of Sunday's face plant at Houston--the Cleveland Browns
belong to the world.</TE>
<TE>   For evidence, look no further than the Bougouni Browns Backers of
Mali, West Africa, a group selling Cleveland T-shirts to raise money
to build a school in its village. The goal is to sell 500 shirts.</TE>
<TE>   "What touches us most is not necessarily the orders that we are
receiving, but the outpouring of support and encouragement," reads a
statement on www.clevelandbrowns.com from Scott Lacy, president of
the Bougouni Browns Backers. "People from Ohio to Nevada and beyond
have sent us inspirational notes and inquiries about our life here in
Mali."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Of the 10 teams that made the playoffs last season, only three
started quarterbacks they had drafted--Pittsburgh with Kordell
Stewart, New England with Tom Brady, and Philadelphia with Donovan
McNabb.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego defensive end Marcellus Wiley on the Chargers' 34-6
victory at Cincinnati last Sunday: "Hey, we were 3-0 last year,
weren't we? The champagne was pouring out of our lockers. We won't do
that this year. Marty [Schottenheimer] has his mind right about this
game, and he's going to make sure our minds are right."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The New York Giants have lost three in a row, dating to last
season. They have done that seven times during Coach Jim Fassel's
tenure, but they have never lost four in succession.</TE>
<TE>   They play at St. Louis on Sunday, so it could be history in the
making.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City's John Tait had never run the ball in any game, at any
level, until his 28-yard rumble at the end of the Cleveland game last
weekend. That, coupled with Cleveland linebacker Dwayne Rudd's being
penalized for throwing his helmet, set up the winning field goal for
the Chiefs with no time remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Tait, the starting right tackle, said precisely the right thing
after the game: "Well, I've got to give credit to my offensive line."</TE>

<HD>Gonzalez Signs Seven-Year Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kansas City Chief tight end Tony Gonzalez has agreed to a seven-year
deal worth more than $31 million, along with a $10-million signing
bonus that is the most any NFL tight end has received.</LD>
<LD>   The bonus, to be paid out over at least three years, is the most
the team has given to any player.</LD>
<LD>   "I can confirm that this is the largest signing/option bonus in
the history of the Kansas City Chiefs," General Manager Carl Peterson
said Friday. "I don't have a problem paying players who have been
productive on and off the field."</LD>
<TE>   The deal is voidable after five years, but Gonzalez said that he
hopes to finish his NFL career in the same city where it began five
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy today to get this thing done," Gonzalez said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to be in Kansas City and to know that I'm going to be
here for at least the next five years."</TE>
<TE>   The deal also allows Gonzalez, who played college basketball at
California, to pursue his dream of playing in the NBA. But if
Gonzalez is injured playing basketball, the new contract calls for a
pro-rated repayment of his option bonus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Holcomb, who threw three touchdown passes in the Cleveland
Browns' season-opening loss while filling in for the injured Tim
Couch, will start this week against the Cincinnati Bengals.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, though, Couch, who has torn scar tissue in his right
elbow, will be installed as the starter for the following week's game
at Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Brown Coach Butch Davis also said defensive end Courtney Brown
might not play Sunday because of a neck injury</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas Cowboys cut veteran cornerback Bryant Westbrook, days
after he committed costly penalties in the team's embarrassing 19-10
loss to Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys said Westbrook, who at one point was yanked off the
field so coaches could talk to him, had lost confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been hanging in there with him," Cowboy vice president
Stephen Jones said on the team's Web site. "It's not like we didn't
have a lot of patience. And then he had a tough week of practice
too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee Titan linebacker Randall Godfrey said his chances of
playing against the Cowboys on Sunday are "very slim."</TE>
<TE>   Godfrey sprained his ankle in last week's victory against the
Philadelphia Eagles. He played four seasons in Dallas before signing
with Tennessee in 2000.</TE>

9     N.Y. GIANTS  (0-1)   Michael Strahan always plays well vs.

13    TAMPA BAY  (0-1)     Gruden's offense takes time to digest. (7)
14    TENNESSEE  (1-0)     If Eddie George is truly back, Titans are
                           in great shape. (19)
15    WASHINGTON  (1-0)    Spurrier passed his first test, but now
                           his team faces tougher foe. (14)
16    N.Y. JETS  (1-0)     Return game is spectacular; run defense is

17    BUFFALO  (0-1)       Drew Bledsoe was dazzling in his debut.
                           (15)

21    KANSAS CITY  (1-0)   Once traded for almost nothing, Priest
                           Holmes is exceptional. (25)
22    ATLANTA (0-1)        Not only did Vick run, he threw touch
                           passes like a 10-year pro. (23)
23    JACKSONVILLE  (0-1)  Defense broke down in crunch time. (26)
24    MINNESOTA (0-1)      "Randy ratio" is one thing, but Vikings
                           need a better ground game. (27)
25    ARIZONA  (0-1)       Cardinals blew too many chances in the red
                           zone. (28)
26    CAROLINA  (1-0)      Conservative game plan suits Rodney Peete.
                           (31)
27    SEATTLE  (0-1)       Hard to believe, but Mike Holmgren could
                           be on shaky ground. (21)
28    HOUSTON (1-0)        After beating Dallas, even 1-15 would be a
                           success. (32)
29    DETROIT  (0-1)       Defense consistently puts Lions in a hole.
                           (30)
30    BALTIMORE  (0-1)     Chris Redman looked OK, but his was a
                           virtuoso performance. (29)
31    CINCINNATI  (0-1)    Same old Bengals, with a twist--zero
                           offense. (22)
32    DALLAS  (0-1)        Too bad Quincy Carter's receivers can't
                           catch shoe-top passes. (20)</TE>

<HD>Kings Lose Miller for Start of Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe and Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Already stung by the off-season departure of Philippe Boucher, who
signed with the Dallas Stars as an unrestricted free agent, the
Kings' defensive corps learned Friday that it will also start the
season without Aaron Miller.</LD>
<LD>   While his teammates opened training camp in El Segundo, Miller,
31, had abdominal surgery in Inglewood to repair an injury known as a
sports hernia. Dr. Craig Smith performed the operation at Centinela
Hospital Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   Miller, a U.S. Olympian last February at Salt Lake City and one of
the Kings' steadiest defensemen since his trade from the Colorado
Avalanche a year earlier, is expected to be sidelined six to eight
weeks.</LD>
<TE>   Teammate Mathieu Schneider, who had similar surgery last November,
sat out 24 games while recovering, and King forward Ian Laperriere,
after having a similar procedure last month, is expected to sit out
all of training camp.</TE>
<TE>   If Miller is ready to play in six weeks, he'll have sat out six
regular-season games. If he's ready in eight, he'll have sat out 13.</TE>
<TE>   Acquired in the February 2001 deal that also brought Adam
Deadmarsh and Jared Aulin to the Kings and sent Rob Blake and Steven
Reinprecht to the Avalanche, the 6-foot-4, 200-pound Miller has
blossomed into a star with the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   He and captain Mattias Norstrom were the defensive stalwarts last
season as the Kings established a club record with a 2.29
goals-against average and ranked third in the league in penalty
killing with the second-best success rate in franchise history. He
led the Kings with 147 blocked shots and tied for the club lead with
a plus-14 ranking. Three of his five goals, matching the most in his
career, were game-winners.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been tremendous for us, obviously," Schneider said. "I think
he's taken his game to another level. He plays such a big role on our
team, and the way he stepped in so comfortably, he probably could
have done the same in Colorado, but I don't think he was really given
the opportunity that he's been given here."</TE>
<TE>   A native of Buffalo, N.Y., who lives during the summer in
Colchester, Vt., Miller suffered the injury last month while working
out in Vermont, Coach Andy Murray said. Doctors determined this week
that surgery was needed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Norstrom sat out the first day of camp because of an undisclosed
illness and Ken Belanger sat out because of a sore back, Murray
said.... All practice sessions, including intrasquad scrimmages
Monday, Tuesday and Saturday nights next week, are open to the
public.... The Kings open their eight-game exhibition schedule
Thursday night against the San Jose Sharks at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks and Kings will hold a rookie game Thursday at the
Arrowhead Pond. The game, which starts at 1 p.m., will feature both
teams' prospects.</TE>
<TE>   No admission will be charged and seating is on a first-come basis.
The parking lot will open at noon.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Crowe and Chris Foster</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Vernon, who backstopped the Calgary Flames and Detroit Red
Wings to Stanley Cup titles, retired after a 19-year NHL career.</TE>
<TE>   The goalie, 39, went 385-273-92 with Calgary, Detroit, San Jose
and Florida. He also had 27 shutouts with a 2.98 goals-against
average in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Vernon led the Flames to the 1989 Stanley Cup and won the Conn
Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP in 1997 when the Red Wings won the
championship.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Helps Giants Take Over Wild Card</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds went four for four and Jeff Kent hit his career-best 34th
homer as the San Francisco Giants routed the San Diego Padres, 10-3,
Friday night at San Diego to regain the National League wild-card
lead.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants moved one game ahead of the Dodgers, who lost at
Colorado. Russ Ortiz pitched into the eighth inning and went three
for four with three runs scored and a run batted in.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds, who at 38 is trying to become the oldest first-time batting
champion, reached base in all 10 plate appearances in the two-game
series, and has reached 12 consecutive times overall.</LD>
<TE>   He raised his major league-leading average to .372, and drove in
three runs. Bonds walked a career-high five times in Thursday night's
3-2, 10-inning loss.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds also reached in his last two plate appearances of a 7-3 loss
to the Dodgers on Wednesday in San Francisco. He and John Olerud
share the NL record for consecutive times reaching base, at 15, both
accomplished in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Aurilia tied his career high for hits by going four for five.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz (12-10) held the Padres to three runs and seven hits over 7
2/3 innings to win his fourth consecutive start. He struck out four
and walked three.</TE>
<TE>   Kent's homer was the 250th of his career.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 3, Houston 2--Edgar Renteria hit an RBI single in the
10th inning at Houston as the Cardinals extended their lead in the NL
Central.</TE>
<TE>   Renteria had three hits and two RBIs for St. Louis, which leads
second-place Houston by 6 1/2 games.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Pujols led off the 10th against Tom Gordon (1-3) with a
double. Pinch-runner Eli Marrero went to third on a throwing error by
Gordon, who turned and made a pickoff throw to second with no one
covering the bag. Marrero scored on Renteria's ground single to left.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 8, Arizona 4--Jim Rushford hit his first big league home
run and Glendon Rusch pitched a seven-hitter at Milwaukee as the
Brewers ended a four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Rusch (10-13) won his fourth in a row, the longest streak of his
career. He is the first Milwaukee pitcher to reach double-digit
victories this season.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 13, Atlanta 3--Greg Maddux struggled through the worst
first inning of his career, giving up six runs, and the Marlins
totaled 16 hits and three home runs to win at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux (13-6) left after two innings trailing, 7-0. His earned-run
average, the lowest in the NL entering the game, rose from to 2.42 to
2.74.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 11, New York 8--Vladimir Guerrero hit his 37th homer and
drove in three runs at Montreal, reaching 100 RBIs for the fifth
consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets made a season-high six errors--including three by 10-time
Gold Glove second baseman Roberto Alomar--and gave up six unearned
runs. The Mets lead the majors with 130 errors.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 7, Cincinnati 6--Fred McGriff got his 1,500th career RBI
with a two-run homer, and Moises Alou hit a three-run shot as the
Cubs won at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, Philadelphia 3--Adam Hyzdu homered, Jack Wilson
drove in two runs and the Pirates used some aggressive baserunning to
score twice in the seventh inning to win at Pittsburgh.</TE>

<HD>FBI Issues Warrant in Dele Disappearance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The FBI issued an arrest warrant Friday for Miles Dabord, also know
as Kevin Williams, the brother of missing former NBA player Bison
Dele.</LD>
<LD>   Dabord is being sought for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution by
the FBI bureau in Phoenix, where he is suspected to attempting to
steal his brother's identity.</LD>
<LD>   The Phoenix police also have a warrant out for Dabord, who on
Sept. 5 allegedly tried to purchase $152,000 in gold using his
brother's identification and a check drawn on Dele's account.</LD>
<TE>   By issuing its warrant, an FBI source said the bureau would be
able to "use all of our resources" in the pursuit of Dabord, who is
believed to be in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Bureau officers on Thursday raided a Tijuana hotel room that had
been occupied by Dabord as recently as the previous day. Evidence was
gathered, but FBI sources would not divulge what was found.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials want to question Dabord about the South Pacific
disappearances of Dele, a former Santa Monica St. Monica High
standout, Dele's girlfriend, Serena Karlan, and boat captain Bertrand
Saldo. Dabord was aboard Dele's 55-foot catamaran, the Hakuna Matata,
as recently as early July.</TE>
<TE>   The Hakuna Matata was found Thursday, docked in the Tahitian town
of Taravao. FBI officials were preparing to conduct a forensics
investigation aboard the boat, which was logged into the dock on July
8 with the new name Arabella painted on its side.</TE>

<DL>STILLWATER, Okla.</DL>
<LD>For the 14 Bruin freshmen who played in their first college game last
Saturday against Colorado State, more new experiences await.</LD>
<LD>   First road game. First on artificial turf.</LD>
<LD>   "Training camp at Cal Lutheran was something like an away game,
but this will be an entirely new experience," freshman quarterback
Drew Olson said.</LD>
<TE>   Fans at Oklahoma State's Lewis Field are very close to the
sideline and although the capacity is 48,000, the noise level is
similar to that at Oregon's Autzen Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "The stands are so close to the players, people can spit chewing
tobacco right at them," Coach Bob Toledo said. "I'll talk to our guys
about not having rabbit ears."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA substituted liberally at most positions last week and will
continue to do so, ensuring that the large number of young players
gain experience. At linebacker, however, the starting trio of Brandon
Chillar, Marcus Reese and Spencer Havner rarely left the field
against Colorado State.</TE>
<TE>   They were stellar, combining for 24 tackles. Chillar was Pacific
10 Conference defensive player of the week with 10 tackles, an
interception and forced fumble. Reese had nine tackles and Havner, a
redshirt freshman, had five.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State alternates three tailbacks, and all three have been
limping lately.</TE>
<TE>   Tatum Bell, a 215-pound junior, led the Cowboys with 776 yards
last season and added 25 pounds during the off-season. He has only
six carries in two games, however, because of an ankle injury.</TE>
<TE>   Seymore Shaw, a 220-pound sophomore, sat out last season as a
partial qualifier but made an immediate impact in the opener against
Louisiana Tech, rushing for 97 yards in seven carries. An ankle
injury restricted him to five carries last week against Northern
Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   The most intriguing tailback is Vernand Morency, a 22-year-old
freshman who was released by the Colorado Rockies in June after four
years as a minor leaguer. He ran for 108 yards against Louisiana Tech
and 50 against Northern Iowa, but he also has a sprained ankle.</TE>

<LD>   WHEN USC HAS THE BALL</LD>
<TE>   Running back Malaefou MacKenzie caught six passes for a
career-best 117 yards in the Trojans' season-opening victory over
Auburn and probably will be a main target again in the Trojans'
spread passing game. Quarterback Carson Palmer and wide receiver
Kareem Kelly burned Colorado two years ago in a 17-14 win at the
Coliseum and would like to repeat the feat. Sultan McCullough also
will play tailback, and Chad Pierson will start at fullback. Colorado
likes to jam the line of scrimmage with eight defenders and blitzes
often. The Buffaloes used six defensive backs last week against San
Diego State and gave up 359 passing yards.</TE>
<TE>   WHEN COLORADO HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hodge, who played at Manhattan Beach Mira Costa High and El
Camino College, will step in at quarterback for injured Craig Ochs.
Hodge is an average passer but a tough runner who led the Buffaloes
to two-second-half touchdowns against San Diego State last week.
Tailback Chris Brown rushed for 185 yards. USC's defensive line
played well against Auburn, and all the starters are healthy.
Weakside linebacker Melvin Simmons is scheduled to play after being
hospitalized two days this week because of an infection in his left
leg and flu. Cornerback Ronald Nunn suffered a broken right thumb
during practice, but he will start.</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO USC VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Weather the conditions. Folsom Field is 5,345 feet above sea
level, but Coach Pete Carroll, who took NFL teams into Denver,
downplays the effects of thin air on visitors. Rain also could be a
factor for a team that relies on the pass.</TE>
<TE>   2. Establish a running game. The Trojans were fortunate to beat
Auburn with only 84 net rushing yards.</TE>
<TE>   3. Reduce penalties. The Trojans were flagged eight times for 92
yards in their first game.</TE>

<DL>BOULDER, Colo.</DL>
<LD>The last time USC receiver Kareem Kelly played against Colorado, he
caught a career-high 10 passes for 145 yards.</LD>
<LD>   But that is not what he recalls about the second game of the 2000
season.</LD>
<LD>   "On the first drive, I ran a route in the red zone," Kelly said.
"I was going to score, but the ball bounced off my chest, and they
got an interception.</LD>
<TE>   "Throughout the game, I was thinking I had to redeem myself and do
something exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly got his chance during the final drive when he caught several
passes from Carson Palmer as the Trojans drove for a field goal that
gave them a 17-14 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly has caught a pass in all 36 games he played for the Trojans
since arriving from Long Beach Poly High in 1999. If he catches a
pass today against No. 18 Colorado, he will tie John Jackson's school
record for consecutive games with a reception.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to be consistent, but as far as records go, I'm
not concerned about that," said Kelly, who had six receptions for 66
yards and a touchdown in the Trojans' season-opening victory against
Auburn. "If you're a receiver, and you're playing, you should catch
the ball."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More than 4,000 USC fans are expected to be among the sellout
crowd at Folsom Field. USC defeated Colorado in Boulder in the
Trojans' 1963 opener. Mike Garrett made his college debut, rushing
for 58 yards in 11 carries in a 14-0 victory.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC is 26-6-2 against Big 12 Conference opponents and has won six
of its last seven games against Big 12 teams. The Trojans defeated
Colorado in 2000 but lost to Kansas State, 10-6, last season.
Colorado is 35-30-1 against Pacific 10 Conference teams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colorado cornerback Lovell Houston finally gets to play against
USC.</TE>
<TE>   Houston, the older brother of injured Colorado running back Marcus
Houston, attended UCLA for two years but redshirted in 1998 and
missed the USC game in 1999 because of a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   Lovell sat out the 2000 season after transferring and was
sidelined because of a hamstring injury last season. He missed this
season's opener against Colorado State because of a sprained knee,
but he made four tackles as a nickel back against San Diego State.</TE>
