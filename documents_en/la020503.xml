<LD>A small gathering of journalists--Italian and Italian
American--gathered poolside at the hilltop home of Italian Consul
General Massimo Roscigno. A glance at the guest list (most surnames
ended in vowels) showed that this group shared a common heritage
along with a vocation. Italian mingled with English as people sipped
wine and got acquainted, often using their family's region of origin
as an opener. The consul's dog padded around the party as smells of
the evening's pasta meal wafted outside.</LD>
<LD>   "I had no idea there were so many Italian Americans in L.A.," said
one woman to a new acquaintance. "They're everywhere, really,"
responded the man.</LD>
<LD>   Italian journalists representing national publications like La
Stampa, La Repubblica and L'Espresso stuck close to one another,
smoking cigarettes and speaking in rapid Italian. Meanwhile, their
Italian American counterparts talked shop and eyed the buffet. And,
as seems customary at dinner parties in Los Angeles, there were two
well-known actors among the crowd--Joe Mantegna of the CBS show
"First Monday" and "The Practice's" Michael Badalucco.</LD>
<TE>   The event was hosted by the National Italian American Foundation,
a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit founded in 1975 to debunk
stereotypes, promote Italian Americans in government, encourage ties
between Italy and the U.S. and monitor the portrayal of Italian
Americans in media and entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   (The group's most recent victory took place two weeks ago when the
Los Angeles City Council voted to keep Columbus Day as a local
holiday in October instead of replacing it with one honoring Cesar
Chavez's birthday. As a compromise, the council will allow city
employees to celebrate either holiday.)</TE>
<TE>   At the group's West Coast gala Thursday night, the organization
was to induct actor Nicolas Cage (ne Coppola) into the Italian
American Hall of Fame and honor Garry Marshall (whose father, Tony
Maschiarelli, changed his name when his family moved to the States)
for his career achievements.</TE>
<TE>   Two and a half years ago, Roscigno and his wife, Agnes, were
granted a reprieve from Beirut and assigned to four years in Los
Angeles. They'll stay another 18 months before returning to their
villa in Rome.</TE>
<TE>   For Roscigno, the dinner party was an opportunity to educate local
journalists on his job and his nation. "A lot of people confuse the
consul general with a [military] general, a counselor, a concierge,"
he joked. "On one side it might look like an easy job. On the other
hand ... my biggest challenge is to try to make known the Italy of
today ... a modern and very complex country."</TE>
<TE>   A Critical Eye on</TE>
<TE>   'Governtainment'</TE>
<TE>   The mobile awareness campaign set to cruise near CBS Television
City and through the rest of the city next week has a simple tagline:
"The CIA has its hand in Hollywood." The posters are not hyping a new
show but posing the question: Should government agencies serve as
script consultants on TV shows?</TE>
<TE>   The campaign, to coincide with May sweeps, comes from a group of
artists based in Boston and Los Angeles. Citing shows like "The
Agency" on CBS, "Alias" on ABC and the Fox show "24," co-founder S.A.
Bachman said the group wants viewers to think about overlaps between
news and entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   "We love our TV," Bachman said. "We're not telling people to turn
off their TV but inviting them to look critically at ...
'governtainment.'"</TE>
<TE>   Bachman, a professor of art at the School of the Museum of Fine
Art, Boston, and David Attyah, a Boston-based printmaker and artist,
have previously collaborated on campaigns designed to raise questions
about depictions of race and gender in the media.</TE>
<TE>   The new campaign was conceived after Sept. 11 (though the three
shows prompting the group's concern were all ordered and scheduled
before the attacks).</TE>
<TE>   "What does it mean at this moment to have intelligence agencies
collaborating with these shows?" said Bachman, offering no answers
but hoping to provoke a discussion. "What does it mean to have all
these shows on the air, glamorizing the intelligence agencies?"</TE>
<TE>   Chris Ender, a CBS spokesman, has a thought about that. "'The
Agency' does from time to time get technical advice [from the CIA],"
he said, "but the CIA has no influence or approval in the creative
process."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "Television series from time to time generate their fair
share of conspiracy theorists. This appears to be another one."</TE>
<TE>   But Bachman is undaunted. In addition to the above-mentioned
shows, Bachman cited a recent episode of NBC's "The West Wing," which
featured real-life presidents Bill Clinton, Gerald Ford and Jimmy
Carter and took the form of a documentary, as an example of "the
increasing blurry lines between news and entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   "We live in a world that's a TV world, [and] TV is a really
important place to look at what's going on because TV reflects and
creates the times," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In a TV world, Bachman knows, her mobile awareness campaign may
face an uphill challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have the audience that 'Alias' does."</TE>

<LD>THE FOURTH TREASURE</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   by Todd Shimoda</LD>
<TE>   Doubleday</TE>
<TE>   320 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   The novel is dead. Long live the novel! Last night, shortly after
reading Todd Shimoda's unique and exuberant "The Fourth Treasure" and
before beginning this review, I went out for a drink with some of my
writing students. One young man, a survivor of the dot-com frenzy,
said he'd heard the essence of that shimmering era summed up in a
single remark: After hours of presentations by young dot-commers
schmoozing with "old-style business," a suited veteran of industry
pronounced his conclusion: "You're just a bunch of guys with ideas."</TE>
<TE>   "Shimodaworks" is the name of the stunningly polished Web site
where a browser can investigate and sample from past, current and
forthcoming "projects" of author, consultant and engineering
professor Shimoda and his artist-collaborator and wife, L.J.C.
Shimoda. To term them a "couple of guys with ideas," though, would be
to wildly understate the case. In addition to respective talents in
the visual and storytelling arts, collectively the pair draws
inspiration and connection from an array of fields that includes
cybernetics, neurology, traditional Japanese scroll-painting,
calligraphy and the Japanese language.</TE>
<TE>   Each of these strands, bound together by the keen cross-cultural
sensitivity of this nisei-generation American writer, plays a
significant role in "The Fourth Treasure," a detective story that
glides effortlessly between contemporary San Francisco and Kyoto,
dips back into the mid-1970s and, with a fresh leap of imagination,
returns to the classical Edo of the mid-17th century.</TE>
<TE>   But the story itself is only the thickest strand of the novel as a
whole, which is enriched by the artwork, which delivers a parallel
unfolding of secrets. Calligraphy is real: in thick, black strokes
and whorls on the page, far more than a metaphor. Calligraphy, or
shodo, is the engine of this novel, the title of which derives from
the four treasures, or necessities, of its practitioner: paper, ink,
brush and inkstone.</TE>
<TE>   The silent central figure of the tale, outwardly calm yet inwardly
tormented, is an aging master calligrapher, a former star of that art
in Japan. Self-exiled to Berkeley, he heads the obscure Zenzen
(Nothing) School of Calligraphy. All he has brought with him from the
illustrious academy in Kyoto is a stolen inkstone and an abraded
heart.</TE>
<TE>   "The Daizen Inkstone began its life as [a tiny part of] a
mountain. At some point in its ancient history, the mountain began to
disintegrate, as all objects do, as all people do." Chipped in free
fall, subsequently "smoothed and mellowed" by the force of a river,
the stone is finally fished out by the wandering poet Jinmai: "'I
think you would make an outstanding inkstone.' The stone, of course,
had nothing to say." Nonetheless, tumbling down generations of
calligrapher-poets, the accidental, perfect stone rose to being both
a well of inspiration and a contested trophy.</TE>
<TE>   Like other traditional art disciplines of Japan, shodo is ideally
an all-consuming do, a discipline, a path for life. Ten thousand
strokes for ten thousand days, the minimum prerequisite for mastery.
Discipline, however, invites--in more sensitive individuals, it may
even compel--transgression. Fittingly and hungrily, utterly
nonjudgmental, "The Fourth Treasure" explores varieties of
transgression in various contexts: adultery, dishonoring of parents,
cheating on a lover, acceding to blackmail, acceding to bribery,
handing out marijuana for medicinal cause and, not least,
misappropriation of an MRI machine.</TE>
<TE>   The front-stage protagonist of the story is Tina Suzuki,
fatherless daughter of a self-denying immigrant-turned-restaurant
waitress, Hanako Suzuki. Tina is a good girl, first-year Berkeley
grad student in neuro. But after a long evening's work analyzing MRI
results with a fellow grad student she fancies: "Tina smiled for a
moment. 'I've been thinking of something kind of kinky. Have you ever
wondered what your brain looks like when you're having an orgasm?'"</TE>
<TE>   The fates of Tina, her self-sacrificing mother, the silent teacher
and certain other players tie up as neatly as treasures bound in a
furoshiki  scarf. The confident reach of this text-plus-visual-aids
is prodigious, exhilarating and provocative. If you read it, you may
turn the last page and absorb the final hieroglyph only reluctantly.</TE>
<TE>   Old-style novelists, move over? Maybe. But in this intriguing
product of a new take on the Renaissance art workshop, a few
traditional elements of fiction are much missed. The characters are
sketchily drawn and without inward development. For all the
dovetailing of a strong plot, the reader feels little emotional
impact. And, ironically given the novel's subject and metaphor, there
is little honor shown to the "ten thousand strokes" of the discipline
of writing. The pervasive dispensing with the past perfect tense
fosters confusion, and pronouns and modifying phrases are sometimes
haphazardly assigned. Technical details? Perhaps. But in the case of
language, essence dwells in style and syntax. A bold experiment,
especially, needs the guidance of an old master.</TE>

<HD>Sweating It Out</HD>
<DH>Embellished, tightened and jazzed up, workout wear ventures
beyond the gym and into fashionable daily life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Slumped over an open shoe box at Nordstrom in West L.A., a tanned
Leesa Mayer, 47, is decked out in navy blue Adidas track pants and a
white hooded sweatshirt.</LD>
<LD>   "Aren't they the cutest?" asks the Beverly Hills blond, an arm
loaded with gold jewelry reaching past her Louis Vuitton tote for a
red sling-back shoe.</LD>
<LD>   Forget Prada's d'Orsay pumps and Gucci's bamboo heels. It's Nike's
"Visi Mazy" cross trainers that have Mayer salivating.</LD>
<TE>   "I used to be a Manolo girl," says the former retailer. Then, two
years ago, she abandoned her $2,000 crocodile stilettos for a
wardrobe of sneakers and sweatpants. "Nowadays, if you carry a good
purse and have a big ring, you can wear anything."</TE>
<TE>   Sneakers and sweatpants have stepped fashionably out of the gym
and onto the street as L.A.'s new urban uniform. The days when a
woman's status could be measured solely by her costume have gone the
way of hoop skirts, corsets and white gloves. Both body conscious and
unconscious at the same time, the new leisure wear appeals to women
of all ages and sizes and has been spotted everywhere from the
Mariposa lunchroom at Neiman Marcus to the nail salons of Studio
City.</TE>
<TE>   "Used to be, when you walked into a store like Neiman's dressed
like this, you wouldn't get service. They would assume you couldn't
afford it. Now they figure it out," says Lori Seker, a 46-year-old
interior decorator from West L.A. who was shopping with Mayer and
also clad in Adidas pants.</TE>
<TE>   Leisure wear's last fashion moment was during the aerobics-crazed
1980s. Women then took style cues from Jane Fonda and "Flashdance,"
donning oversized pastel sweatshirts from Au Coton or Camp Beverly
Hills with fashion color high-tops from Reebok or L.A. Gear, leg
warmers and braided headbands.</TE>
<TE>   But today it's less of a fad and more of a reaction to the fashion
status quo. Many women have had it with clothes that don't fit, are
too expensive or just aren't relevant to their active lives. The new
urban uniform is relaxed but tidy, with a bit of style punch. This
time around, women are still picking up tips from their fitness
trainers, though now they are often from personal trainers.</TE>
<TE>   This revolution in dressing is much bigger than any one label.
Old-school sneaker giants Adidas, Puma and Pony have cashed in on
their vintage cachet, reviving classic logo wear and sneaker styles
from the 1970s in updated color combinations and shapes. And Nike is
trying to appeal to soccer moms with its new Nike Goddess clothing
stores.</TE>
<TE>   The high-fashion world has jumped on board too. Puma partnered
with fashion designer Jil Sander to create limited-edition styles.
And Adidas tapped Yohji Yamamoto and Stella McCartney to make
sneakers, at about $300 a pair, for upscale boutiques such as
Maxfield. Even luxury brands Chanel, Gucci and Prada offer sneakers
and active wear.</TE>
<TE>   "Sneakers are so much more than just sports shoes now," says Abby
Guyer, Adidas trend marketing manager.</TE>
<TE>   But it is Juicy Couture in the San Fernando Valley that has
elevated sweats from sloppy to sexy with new silhouettes and details
that are trickling down to Old Navy and Mossimo for Target.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a whole casual-yoga-spa wear thing happening at retail,
and a lot of it is based on what Juicy has done," says Kathy
Bradley-Riley, a market analyst for fashion trend forecasting firm
Doneger Group in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Fashion designer Pamela Skaist-Levy, 38, and former actress Gela
Nash-Taylor, 41, founded Juicy Couture in 1994 as an upscale T-shirt
line. The company has since expanded into denim and in 1999
introduced its now signature low-riding drawstring pants and
form-fitting zip-up hoodies in an ever-widening array of colored and
patterned velour, terry cloth and even cashmere. Tops and bottoms
start at about $70 each and are typically worn together as a kind of
fashionable leisure suit.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone wants to wear sweats. It's the first thing you do when
you get home--you take off your clothes and put something comfortable
on," says Nash-Taylor, who is married to Duran Duran's John Taylor.
"But ours have a sexy fit, and the fabric keeps its color, so you
don't feel like you're leaving the house with curlers in your hair,
looking like a slob. You look put together enough to go where you
want to go."</TE>
<TE>   The Ron Herman boutiques started carrying Juicy Couture's updated
leisure suits three seasons ago, and they are still top sellers.
"When I first bought the line, I didn't think people were going to
wear the pieces together," says John Eshaya, women's wear buyer for
the stores. "But the look has become the thing to wear on your day
off. The jackets are high, the pants are low, so you get a little
midriff action going....It's perfect for the L.A. girl."</TE>
<TE>   Other labels are focusing more on embellishment. Great China Wall
specializes in one-of-a-kind, hand-embroidered and tie-dyed vintage
sweatshirts and sweatpants for $200 and up. L.A. hair accessories
line Joomi Joolz and jewelry designer Tarina Tarantino have added
rhinestone-studded tank tops and sweats to their collections.</TE>
<TE>   "I work out every day of the week, and this is something I can
keep on through the afternoon until I change to go out for the
evening," says Lisa Machat, 46, a full-time mom shopping at Saks
Fifth Avenue recently in black sweatpants with a flared leg and a
Great China Wall sweatshirt embellished with rhinestones and Harley
logos, topped off with a Chanel quilted black patent tote. But even
with leisure wear storming the streets, there's still style-building
going on in the gym. Forget Tiger Woods--sportswear labels are now
making sponsorship deals with personal trainers for product
placement.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how many clients ask me what stores have the
stuff I wear or what I think would look good on them," says Helene
Guzman, who left hairstyling six years ago to start the independent
training company L.A. Rox.</TE>
<TE>   Guzman, 38, favors Juicy Couture sweats and Tarina Tarantino tops.
She has about 150 pairs of sneakers, many free from her sponsor,
Reebok. "I try to bring as much fashion into fitness as I can," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   Her clients take notice. "She does have a distinct style ... and
the physique to go along with it," says Deborah Oppenheimer,
executive producer of "The Drew Carey Show" and "The George Lopez
Show," who trains with Guzman three times a week.</TE>
<TE>   Oppenheimer snapped up a few Tarina Tarantino tops after seeing
them on Guzman, who also convinced her to try a velour Reebok warmup
suit. "I thought I could never wear it, but she said I could. And she
knows my figure better than anyone," says Oppenheimer, who wears the
track suit to the gym, shopping at Hermes and to all-night editing
sessions at the studio.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, not everyone is hip to the new casualness or to Juicy's
leisure suits. Liz Dolan, president of accessories showroom Parallel
Lines and a serial perfect outfit wearer, thinks the look is a
cop-out. She says, "I kind of miss the old I. Magnin/Bullocks way of
dressing up to go out."</TE>

<LD>Korean-born violinist Yejin Kim, 15, moved to Glendale when she was
4. She is a ninth-grade student at Cross Roads School in Santa
Monica. In this Learning Link, Kim discusses her beloved violin and
her upcoming performance for the American Youth Symphony, when she
will play one of the most difficult violin concertos ever written.</LD>
<LD>   My mom started me on the violin when I was 2 1/2 because she had a
theory that kids should move their fingers at an early age to make
them smarter. I don't know if that's true, but it turns out that I
had a talent for the violin and liked it.</LD>
<LD>   I became serious about the violin at age 11. Performing is very
exciting. The most important thing to me is communicating with the
audience and expressing myself. I don't get nervous, I think of it as
excess energy. When I choose a dress for a performance, I have to
like it, but it also needs to be comfortable. It has to be loose and
breathe. I don't like sleeves. Shoes are also very important. You
need a strong foundation when you play. I don't wear heels that are
too high.</LD>
<TE>   For the past six years, I've played an Italian violin made by
Joseph Rocca. It's my first full-sized violin, and I'm very grateful
for it. You establish a deep connection with your instrument. It's
like a piece of you, like your hand. I take it in for regular
maintenance checks and also clean it regularly so the dust and dirt
don't alter the sound. I have to change the strings every three
months or so.</TE>
<TE>   I average three to four hours of practice a day on weekdays and
five to six a day on weekends. It's a challenge to stay focused, but
you need to be prepared; you never know what will happen onstage.</TE>
<TE>   When Mr. Treger, the conductor of the American Youth Symphony,
invited me to appear as a soloist with the orchestra, he asked me
what I was practicing. It was the Violin Concerto No. 1 by a composer
named Wieniawski, which some people consider to be the most difficult
violin concerto ever written. It took me about three months to learn
it. Even people who don't think they like classical music might enjoy
it. It's an exciting virtuoso piece for violinists who want to show
their stuff!</TE>
<TE>   The American Youth Symphony invites you to a free concert
featuring Yejin Kim at 8 p.m. Sunday at UCLA's Royce Hall located on
the campus of UCLA in Westwood. For more information, call (310)
234-8355 or visit www.AYSymphony.org.</TE>

<HD>Where the Wedding Bells Keep Ringing</HD>
<DH>On screen and off, nuptials are a Hollywood staple. A new
book gives glimpses of the intimate relations between bridal trends
and the movies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood loves a wedding. The cake, the flowers and, mostly, the
gowns have been reason to celebrate love on screen ever since the
beginning of cinema.</LD>
<LD>   A new book, "Hollywood Gets Married" (Clarkson Potter Publishers,
2002), by costume and couture collector Sandy Schreier, gives a
behind-the-seams peek at how Hollywood has glamorized weddings, on
and off the screen, and helped set bridal trends for millions.</LD>
<LD>   From the movie industry's infancy in the early 20th century,
filmmakers have included wedding scenes, and not just because they
thought audiences were suckers for romance, according to Schreier,
who was visiting from Detroit this week for, as it happens, a
friend's wedding.</LD>
<TE>   Whether it was a gangster film, an epic set in a desert or even a
cowboy flick, couples were always getting hitched, usually in a gown
that seemed out of context for the movie's setting.</TE>
<TE>   "Something was fishy," said Schreier, a onetime model who shared
her lifelong interest in cinema costumes in her first book,
"Hollywood Dressed and Undressed" (Rizzoli International
Publications, 1998). She learned that many early studio heads came
from garment manufacturing backgrounds, including glove merchant
Samuel Goldwyn, furrier Adolph Zukor and button dealer Louis B.
Mayer.</TE>
<TE>   "When they first started, they decided that they were going to
make costumes the most important thing because they didn't know how
to make movies," she said over lox and bagels at Nate'n Al's in
Beverly Hills. Eventually they realized that showing "the most
beautiful clothes that you ever saw" would be a good audience draw.
But clothing that met that standard--French couture--was expensive.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when they built their own warehouses with every
specialty--milliners, embroiderers, glove makers--to make the special
clothes," said Schreier, who wore a Junya Watanabe denim skirt.</TE>
<TE>   Her research revealed that executives kept their studio clothing
factories busy and were "making money on the side by making and
selling wedding gowns to department stores," said Schreier.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Hollywood helped establish what wedding gowns came to
look like," she said, noting that moviemakers wrapped into one
glamorous satin and lace package every little girl's dream of
becoming a movie star, fairy princess or bride. The book includes the
author's own 1950s wedding portrait, in which she was also a princess
bride.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's version has stood the test of time, through the
streamlined bias cuts of the '30s to the padded shoulders of the
wartime '40s, the exuberant poufs of '50s cocktail dresses and
today's bare dresses.</TE>
<TE>   Though the paperback is a fun read, it's light on the kind of
facts and studied observations that would more insightfully document
Hollywood's influence on popular culture. Schreier's command of her
subject comes across more clearly in conversation than in the
light-on-type book, a common failing in many of today's flashy
fashion tomes.</TE>
<TE>   The picture-laden, 176-page book is filled with stills and chatty
captions that chronicle the fun and dishy details of the film, the
gowns and, often, the number of times each actress walked down the
aisle. The author gathered some of her best scoop directly from
costume designers such as Edith Head and Theadora Van Runkle, whom
she interviewed years ago as part of a classic movie TV series she
co-hosted.</TE>
<TE>   "All the classic costume designers were [retired] and feeling
unwanted and unloved," said Schreier, who is a major contributor to
the new exhibit on costume designer Adrian that will open this month
at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. "They had nothing to do
but sit and talk to me."</TE>
<TE>   But don't ask Schreier to discuss wedding scandals or private
details of the stars. "To me," she said, "movies and movie stars are
sacred. And I want to keep it that way. Fun and fantasy."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is the dark night of American Catholicism's communal soul.</LD>
<LD>   For months, each day's news has brought more accusations of
children sexually abused by priests, of deceit and dereliction by
their episcopal superiors; more lawsuits filed; more settlements
reached; more judgments recorded.</LD>
<LD>   No other American denomination ever has been subjected to the sort
of broad, intense and sustained news coverage the Roman Catholic
Church has received since the current scandal first came to light in
the archdiocese of Boston.</LD>
<TE>   And the coverage has had its consequences: Since January, at least
177 priests accused of molesting children have resigned or been
removed from their ministries.</TE>
<TE>   In conversations this week, the editors of the country's three
leading Catholic publications--the National Catholic Reporter;
Commonweal, a biweekly journal of opinion edited by laypeople; and
America, the U.S. Jesuits' weekly magazine for "thinking
Catholics"--agreed that the secular print media have done a good job
covering the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   But is there too much coverage?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there can be too much, as long as there is one
child in danger," said Father Thomas Reese, editor of America.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret O'Brien Steinfels, who edits Commonweal, said "the Los
Angeles Times and the New York Times have done a very good and
balanced job, and I think the Boston Globe has done what it had to
do. The story there is of enormous importance." But, she said,
newspaper editors must continuously ask themselves "whether this is a
story they're reporting or one that they're driving."</TE>
<TE>   "So far, though, I don't think there have been any egregious
errors," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Roberts edits the National Catholic Reporter, a lay weekly
newspaper. "We've been reporting on this problem for 17 years," he
said, "but the story never took off nationally until papers like the
Boston Globe, the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times got
involved. I've seen some great reporting since then, and it shows the
effect the American press can have when it mobilizes itself in a
responsible way around an important issue. Frankly, I'm glad. The
most important thing is to get at the truth, even though it's tough
to take because it concerns something you love."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts singles out the Globe and its editor, Marty Baron, for
particular praise. "Boston was a turning point in three ways," he
said. "First, because the story broke under the white hot light of
East Coast media coverage; second, because it implicated Cardinal
[Bernard] Law, who is a major player in the church, a kingmaker of
other bishops and very well connected in Rome. But what really made
the difference was that Baron came in as editor of the Globe and
asked his reporters a fundamental question: 'What do you need to push
this story forward?' They said they needed documents unsealed, and he
saw that his paper went to court and got them unsealed.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't overstate the importance of that. When Catholics
finally got a look at the unedited Bernard Law, it set their teeth on
edge. Catholics understand individual failure, particularly in sexual
matters. They're able to forgive individuals enormous sins. But when
they see official cover-up and the way the victims have been treated,
it makes their blood boil."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts also believes reporter David Briggs of the Cleveland Plain
Dealer deserves credit for "doing a superb job of bringing the
problem to light in that diocese with the same sort of coverage that
exposes the church's abusive countersuits and badgering of victims.
It's an example of the church's culture being explored as we always
wished it would be."</TE>
<TE>   Steinfels believes the major newspapers have been somewhat late in
engaging "the issue of what I would call abuse chasers, the lawyers
making a specialty of this. These lawyers are a very important
feature of this story and, I think, will be increasingly so. But over
time, the newspapers have covered what was missing in the beginning
from their reporting."</TE>
<TE>   "Look," said America's Reese, "the problem is that what has
happened is awful. Obviously not all priests are pedophiles, and some
people in the church feel that the way headlines and words get thrown
together gives that impression. Frankly, I think the problem is so
serious that many people inside the church had to be hit over the
head with a 2-by-4 before they woke up and began to deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   Where would the Catholic editors like to see the story go from
here?</TE>
<TE>   Steinfels and Reese would like to see a more sustained media focus
on the problem of child abuse. "As a society, we don't fully have our
arms around this problem," Commonweal's Steinfels said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were advising newspaper editors right now," said America's
Reese, "I would say it's time to expand the story beyond the Catholic
clergy. In every American city, tens of thousands of children are
abused each year, and the press must speak up as strongly for them as
it is doing now. I think this is where the church should move also.
It should do penance for what has occurred by putting the full power
and weight of the Catholic Church to work dealing with sex abuse more
generally," Reese said. "When you see how underfinanced child
protective services are in this country, it's a scandal. We all need
to take this American crisis more seriously and do something about
it. I think the church should take a leadership role in this to make
up for all the damage it has permitted to be done."</TE>

<TE>   Dear Good: Let's rein in some of those misconceptions before they
scamper off willy-nilly. Marilyn Monroe's physical statistics,
according to Current Biography, were as follows: 5 feet 5, about 120
pounds, with measurements of 37 1/2-23-36. While she's often been
described as full-figured and zaftig, those numbers suggest instead
that she was thin, but curvy.</TE>
<TE>   Miss Monroe very well may have been a size 12 or even a 14 during
the 1950s, since over the years sizes have in general become much
more generous (although some designers have recently scaled back
down). We've also seen the addition of teeny-tiny sizes such as 0 and
2, as well as petites, to accommodate very thin and shorter women.</TE>
<TE>   Today the actress would probably fit nicely into a 6 or an 8,
depending on the designer or manufacturer. Uniform standards for
American sizes disappeared in the 1980s, when the National Bureau of
Standards allowed the garment industry to determine its own set of
numbers. So it's not unusual these days for men and women to have a
three-size range in their closet, and it's not even because of big
weight swings.</TE>
<TE>   Plus sizes are usually tagged with the letter "W," as in 12W, to
distinguish it from a regular size 12. But there's a wide variation
in what clothing companies consider plus sizes, although 14-16 is
usually the kick-off point. However, Talbot's starts its plus sizes
at 12W (with measurements slightly larger than a regular size 12),
while Lands' End's plus sizes begin at 18. But we think that starting
at 12 is something of an anomaly, and you shouldn't flip out because
you think you're a plus size or because you have X's on your labels.
We know a few size 8s and 10s who sometimes pick up an extra-large in
an item that tends to run small.</TE>
<TE>   But there's more to this than sizes and measurements. Our
standards of beauty have changed over the past decades, and what was
once thought the epitome of beauty and sensuality--feminine curves
and roundness--has given way to a new standard of almost impossible
thinness, coupled with unnaturally large breasts. We're sure the
beauty aesthetic will change again, but unfortunately we can't give
you a timeline on that.</TE>
<TE>   As for junior sizes, which use odd numbers (or are sometimes
written as 5/6, 7/8, etc.), they're still around. Junior retailers
such as Wet Seal and Rampage still use them, in addition to the
all-purpose small, medium and large.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: I am 71 years old and have had painted
toenails since I could hold a bottle of nail polish. Lately I've been
seeing bare naked toes everywhere, so I'm wondering if painted
toenails are hopelessly out of date. It's almost time for sandals,
and I don't want my cute toes to be objects of ridicule.</TE>
<TE>   --FOOTSIE</TE>
<TE>   Dear Footsie: Don't worry, your cute toes are right in step with
the times. Well-groomed feet are never out of fashion, especially
when they're exposed to public scrutiny during spring and summer.
Polish is still very much in style, from pale shades to hot brights.
Just keep an eye on it, and when it starts to chip, remove it or
touch it up. And don't forget to give your toes a breather between
applications of polish. It's also fine to go without polish; just
make sure nails are trimmed and neat.</TE>
<TE>   We encourage men as well as women to keep up regular pedicures.
This is important even if sandals aren't in the picture because it
keeps nails and calluses from getting out of hand. In fact, pedicures
should part of the grooming regimen all year long, not just when it's
warm.</TE>

<HD>Families on the Cusp of an Uncharted Realm</HD>
<DH>Relationships* As they approach 18, the children of women
who patronized a pioneering sperm bank face the choice of learning
donor fathers' identities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT HARRIS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>Marcus has two moms. And once the 15-year-old reaches his 18th
birthday, Marcus expects to meet his ... well, what's the right term
for the mystery man who provided the sperm that made his life
possible?</LD>
<LD>   "The donor" is how Marcus Liefert thinks of him now. Certainly not
"dad," even though Marcus imagines they might go out to a ballgame
someday. How about "genetic father"?</LD>
<LD>   "No. I know that's biologically true, but that's not the term I
would use," Marcus says.</LD>
<TE>   The word "father" connotes parenthood, and Marcus knows who his
parents are: Francey Liefert, who conceived him and carried him in
her womb, and Laurel Liefert, Francey's longtime partner and the
biological mother of Marcus' 12-year-old sibling, David. The Lieferts
insisted on sperm from the same donor to assure that Marcus and David
are genetic half-brothers, thus tightening the familial bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The Lieferts are among a group of families on the cusp of an
uncharted realm in human relations. The children born to women who
have patronized the Sperm Bank of California since feminists founded
it in Oakland in 1982 have been offered an unprecedented option:
disclosure of the donor's identity when the child crosses the legal
threshold of adulthood.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit sperm bank, founded primarily to help lesbians and
single straight women fulfill maternal goals, has helped in the
conception of more than 1,100 children. Roughly four out of five
clients have chosen the donor ID release option, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   So far, three children who were conceived under the agreement have
turned 18, one of whom has requested and received her donor father's
identity. Claire, the daughter of a single Palo Alto woman, has seen
the donor's photograph and received other factual information. (Sperm
Bank of California officials urge participants to use only their
first names in the media to help preserve confidentiality. The
Lieferts prefer to use their full names.) A high school senior,
Claire intends to meet her donor someday, program officials say, but
she has not decided when. When she is ready, it will be up to Claire
and the donor to handle the specifics of their meeting, but the task
force hopes to stay in touch with all parties to see what issues
arise down the line so they can prepare for the next generation.</TE>
<TE>   Before the year is out, 15 other children of the bank's donors
will turn 18. Within three years, the total will approach 100, says
Sue Rubin, one of the sperm bank's directors. Rubin led a task force
to find out the expectations among sperm bank participants and found
that most children and mothers hope to meet the donors. Those donors
are curious as well, Rubin says, and intend to honor the contracts
they all had to sign more than 18 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The concept is a radical change in a reproductive field that dates
to the 1880s and for generations has functioned as a clandestine
service. Infertile couples assisted by sperm donors--who, before the
advent of cryogenically freezing sperm, were often medical
students--seldom revealed the nature of the conception to children.</TE>
<TE>   The earliest published accounts of sperm donation--such as a
doctor's memoir in the early 20th century and a British medical
journal article in the 1950s--so scandalized the public that the
practice remained secretive until the sexual revolution of the 1960s.
"Society was truly offended," says Dr. Cappy Rothman, founder of
California Cryobank in Los Angeles, one of the world's largest sperm
banks.</TE>
<TE>   Although the practice has become less closeted, the identification
of donors is extremely rare. Only a few banks across the nation have
followed the Sperm Bank of California's lead in promising disclosure
at a later date. Some banks have weaker policies, including the
"willing to be asked" option, in which a donor agrees to consider
coming forward if the child, after turning 18, requests his identity.</TE>
<TE>   California Cryobank promises parents that, if an adult offspring
requests contact with the donor, the sperm bank will attempt to relay
the request to the donor. Rothman suggests the varying and evolving
policies reflect the clientele. Married couples, he says, have little
interest in the disclosure compared with single women who "eventually
have to tell the child something." The Sperm Bank of California
developed its disclosure policy through discussions with clients,
says founder Barbara Raboy. The children's right to know their
genetic forebear, it was decided, outweighs the donor's desire for
privacy--even if disclosure might create a Pandora's box of
unsettling psychological effects for every child, mother and donor.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that risk, "this is how it should be," says Bill Cordray,
an advocate for donor offspring. "Ethically, everybody should have
the right to know where they came from." Cordray speaks from
experience. The 56-year-old Salt Lake City man was in his 30s when,
after his father's death, his mother revealed they had relied on
donor insemination. Anger at his parents' secrecy, Cordray says, gave
way to a sense of liberation. He had been so different from his
father that as a teenager he formed the belief that he had been
conceived in an extramarital affair, a notion that fomented anger
toward his mother and guilt for his suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates put the number of children born each year via donor
insemination in the tens of thousands, but only a fraction will ever
learn the identity of their genetic forebears, Cordray says. Apart
from psychological issues, there are documented cases of unknowingly
incestuous relations that would be prevented by disclosure, he says.
The secrecy will persist, Cordray argues, unless new laws are
adopted. The medical community opposes such changes. "It's not a
one-size-fits-all situation," says Sean Tipton, a spokesman for the
American Society of Reproductive Medicine. "And if the option of
anonymous donation is removed, you'll have fewer donors."</TE>
<TE>   Disclosure has its risks. Rubin, a medical ethicist, says the
children, mothers and donors interviewed by her task force, share a
lurking fear: "What if the person they are meeting is a nut case?"
But there are several reasons, Rubin quickly adds, there is optimism
that most people will interact with mutual respect and have a
positive experience. One reason is that the mothers and donors made
conscientious decisions to participate, believed it was morally right
and considered the possible pitfalls ahead of time. Another is that
these children, unlike many donor offspring, have long understood the
atypical nature of their conception and families, and have had years
to adjust.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the more intriguing issues revolve on the sperm bank's
policy in which donors are "retired" after 10 family units have
successfully given birth, although they may be asked to donate again
by families who want more children from the same donor. Some donors
are linked to 10 or more offspring. One donor is genetically linked
to 20 children--not including two with his wife.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-family policy "is actually very conservative," Rubin says.
The standard adopted by the American Society for Reproductive
Medicine is for donors to help conceive no more than 25 offspring
within a regional population of 800,000. For many offspring, the
existence of genetic half-siblings is as intriguing, if not more so,
as the identity of their genetic father, says San Ramon-based
therapist Jean Benward, a sperm bank task-force member. Most of the
half-siblings are within the same peer group, she points out, and
share common experiences.</TE>
<TE>   But Marcus says he is less curious about genetic half-siblings
than his donor. After all, he has a brother in David. (In addition to
the genetic link, each boy was legally adopted by their biological
mother's partner.)</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, Marcus may already be unknowingly acquainted with
some of his half-siblings within the social network of lesbian
families in the Bay Area fostered by the sperm bank. It would not be
difficult to find out, because mothers select donors from a catalog
containing descriptive information. In addition to race, height,
color of eyes and hair, donors answered a variety of questions,
including one that invites them to convey a message to the offspring.
(Donors, in contrast, know nothing of the mothers and offspring, save
for their existence.)</TE>
<TE>   Marcus says one of his teachers theorizes that he is related to a
classmate who is also a donor offspring, based on their similar
appearances and behavior. But Marcus says they've never been curious
enough to compare notes. "I'm not sure I want to be related to him,"
he says, grinning.</TE>
<TE>   For donors, meanwhile, the 10-family policy magnifies the worry
that some youths may seek deeper relationships than they are willing
to provide. "I would not want to be a father replacement," says a
donor named James. "That is a concern of mine--that boundaries be
respected. That's just one of the risks you take, and I'm willing to
accept that." The donors, the task force found, say their wives and
girlfriends are often wary that offspring could prove disruptive.</TE>
<TE>   James says he decided to become a donor because he knew he didn't
want to raise a family himself and felt "this was a way of giving
back to society." He also said he was impressed with the sperm bank's
philosophy, including the ID disclosure option. He laughs at the
suggestion that someday he might get a call from an offspring trying
to get bailed out of jail. His only obligations, he says, are to
answer whatever questions the offspring may have, such as family
history. Although he doesn't rule out the possibility of a lasting
relationship, James insists that it would be friendship, not kinship.
"I don't want to be considered a father, because I'm not. I'm a
donor."</TE>
<TE>   Mothers, meanwhile, worry for their children. The Lieferts say
they're optimistic. "But I'm afraid the boys will be disappointed,
that he won't be as interested in them as they are in him," Francey
says. They worry less about Marcus, the Lieferts say, than David.
"He's always had more of a longing to have a dad--a feeling that
something was missing in our family," Francey says.</TE>
<TE>   Will younger siblings such as David learn the donor's identity
when their older siblings turn 18? Rubin calls that "a really tricky
issue." The sperm bank urges the young adult to honor the
confidentiality protocols, Rubin says, and not reveal the identity of
the donor. Many donors, however, "feel comfortable deferring to the
families' wishes," she adds.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus is tall, husky and poised beyond his years. He explains
that from a young age he has known the nature of his conception--"it
was just a fact of life." His curiosity about the donor has grown
over the years, especially recently. "I'm really interested in
meeting him, just to know who he is, this mysterious figure. Looking
at the genetics is really interesting. What are the traits that I
have that might come from him?" He isn't seeking a father figure, he
says, yet seems hopeful that the genetic link will produce "the
chemistry" for a special friendship. No longer would Marcus refer to
him as "the donor," but by his first name. Going to an Oakland
Athletics game "would be fun," he says. But even if the chemistry
wasn't right, that would be OK too--just to meet him would resolve
the mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Francey and Laurel say they want to meet him too, if just to say
thank you. Over red wine, Marcus' two moms reminisce about their path
to motherhood. Laurel tried first but had trouble conceiving, then
Francey tried. They rejected a boastful donor who claimed an IQ of
160 because his "packet reeked of ego." They wanted a donor who came
across as a good guy. Francey laughs recalling how a sperm bank
worker excitedly called her to report that a new donor had passed the
screening: "Have I got a donor for you! He's got great motility!
Great numbers!" She was referring to his sperm count.</TE>
<TE>   And, based on his questionnaire, he seemed to be the decent fellow
they were seeking. This is one reason the moms are optimistic, with
fingers crossed, that Marcus and David are in for an enriching
experience. Laurel laughs, suggesting an icebreaker: "Hey, you still
got that motility?"</TE>

<HD>'70s Echoes From Five for Fighting</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eras of pop music never really go away. There's always a band like
Oasis aping the Beatles, or one like the Strokes obsessing over a
period from the New York underground that ended before its members
were born. Somewhere in all that now is an echo of sensitive male
balladeers, with such new hit-makers as Train and Five for Fighting
reaching for the feel-good '70s touch of Elton John.</LD>
<LD>   At its concert Wednesday at the House of Blues in West Hollywood,
Five for Fighting ended its current tour with a hometown show that
was soothing and unassuming. This past year the quartet enjoyed a hit
with "Superman," which during its 90-minute show peaked with vocals
of warmth and vulnerability from leader John Ondrasik.</LD>
<LD>   "Thank you for taking this song to heart," he told the crowd. But
little else of the band's material reached that same emotional level.
So most of the night was pleasant enough but uninvolving beyond the
good-natured vibe of the band.</LD>
<TE>   With his sideburns and black muscle T-shirt, Ondrasik showed a
certain '70s flamboyance as a frontman, his swagger sometimes coming
off like Burt Reynolds with a guitar.</TE>
<TE>   He pulled two fans onstage to dance through "Out of Love" and sat
at his electric piano for the bloodless longing of "Jainy."</TE>
<TE>   Five for Fighting was mostly like a no-frills Dave Matthews Band.
In his favor, Ondrasik kept things direct, finding appropriate
material in the Elton John-Bernie Taupin hit "Rocket Man." Less
convincing was a set-closing "Let It Be," a fine choice that
nevertheless failed to capture the grandeur of the Beatles original.
Not everything is so easily recyclable.</TE>

<HD>Staging a Rebirth in a Theater's Ruins</HD>
<DH>Arts* In Peru, an opera house ravaged by fire has become a
hot spot for shows and events.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DREW BENSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LIMA, Peru</DL>
<LD>Shows at Lima's 1920 Municipal Theater would have a hard time
bringing down the house, considering a fire largely did the job in
1998.</LD>
<LD>   But that hasn't kept the charred opera house from becoming one of
the smartest places in town for shows and celebrations. Plays,
concerts and musical revues usually sell out, with patrons filling
the folding chairs that line the once-carpeted concrete ground floor
and balconies.</LD>
<LD>   From once grand and elaborate molding, crumbling plaster faces
stare into the dark, stripped of their cream, aqua and gold paints by
the fire.</LD>
<TE>   "Oh, this is horrible. This is so sad," said 29-year-old Fiorella
Donayre as she took in the darkened theater before a recent revue of
Peruvian music and dance. "I remember it when I was a girl."</TE>
<TE>   Other shows at the theater have included modern dance acts,
classical music concerts and productions of "King Lear" and "Faust."</TE>
<TE>   Juan Carlos Adrianzen, who produced "Faust" last year, said he
could think of no better place than a decaying opera house to
represent the mind of a man descending into madness after selling his
soul to the devil.</TE>
<TE>   "The Municipal Theater became the work, another character in the
play," Adrianzen said. "When you put on a play, you have thousands of
ways to do it. This space leaves you a thousand more ways to bring it
to life."</TE>
<TE>   That's part of the idea, said Dennis Ferguson, who heads Lima's
Municipal Theater restoration office.</TE>
<TE>   When Mayor Alberto Andrade reopened the theater in March 1999 to
promote its restoration, he also opened an unusual artistic
opportunity for producers and directors.</TE>
<TE>   The theater's stage has evolved with each production,
incorporating a metal ramp from "King Lear," a cement platform from
"Faust" and twin, three-tiered platforms from the Peruvian music
revue.</TE>
<TE>   At that show, video clips of interviews with dead Peruvian
songwriters were projected onto the whitewashed brick wall of a
neighboring building behind the stage, making the opera house feel
like a ghostly, drive-in movie theater.</TE>
<TE>   The locale also appealed to Frecuencia Latina, a local TV channel,
which held a party there to celebrate the one-year anniversary of the
end of disgraced former President Alberto Fujimori's decade-long
regime and the return of the station's owner from self-imposed exile.</TE>
<TE>   About 500 guests attended the "One Year of Liberty" celebration in
December. They watched musical and dance allegories in the opera
hall, then retired for cocktails in the lobby, where brass
chandeliers, tall mirrors and mauve marble Corinthian columns were
untouched by the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso Maldonado, Frecuencia Latina's public relations director,
said the theater seemed perfect for marking Peru's return to
democracy. "It is a cultural center in the process of rebirth, like a
phoenix from the ashes--like Peru," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson said the $30-million reconstruction project will begin
early next year and the fully restored theater will open in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   The city began with a $5-million renovation budget, to which Spain
chipped in $15 million and the Inter-American Development Bank added
$5 million. Ferguson said the city is looking to Peru's national
government and private donors for the rest.</TE>
<TE>   Using pre-fire photos, the project will preserve the opera house's
original polyglot of Old World styles and restore the 1,385-seating
capacity, but it will also modernize the acoustics and expand the
backstage area. Before the fire, the limited backstage--and a tanking
local economy and turmoil caused by Maoist Shining Path rebels--had
bumped Lima off the international tour circuit for several decades,
Ferguson said.</TE>
<TE>   The city has also bought five properties within three blocks of
the theater to house restaurants, cafes and galleries, with
underground parking linking six other area theaters, one of which
currently shows porno movies.</TE>
<TE>   Adrianzen, however, believes that restoring the site is a
misguided idea. It will lose its vogue in time, and it is too
expensive to continue using, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of a roof and stage wall means actors need to wear
microphones to be heard. Those costs, plus the need to rent lighting
and sounds systems for each show, add up, Adrianzen said.</TE>
<TE>   It costs $100,000 to $120,000 to produce a show in the Municipal
Theater, which can only seat 400 now, he said. In contrast, shows
across town in the 200-seat theater at Catholic University's cultural
center cost $20,000 to $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   "When you enter, it moves you--it is like entering a ruin,"
Adrianzen said of the Municipal Theater. "It is a beautiful ruin, but
it's not a theater."</TE>

<HD>There's Trouble in the Air for Webcasters Over Music
Royalties</HD>
<DH>Internet stations say that proposed payments would put them
out of business. However, there is talk of compromise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two cents may sound like a pittance, but it's a figure that has
thrown the future of Internet radio into doubt and set off a bitter
fight between the record industry and Webcasters.</LD>
<LD>   The amount is the average price per hour, per listener that
Webcasters will have to shell out to play music on their sites if a
proposed schedule of royalty fees goes into effect later this month.
The Webcasters say the royalties--which can quickly add up beyond the
minimum of $500 per year and will be retroactive to 1998--will drive
niche and independent programmers out of business, leaving only a few
huge corporations controlling the music that's heard. Just like what
has happened with conventional radio, they warn.</LD>
<LD>   The argument from the record companies and artists, on the other
hand, is simple: It's unfair to have their work used and not get paid
for it.</LD>
<TE>   "They'll pay for bandwidth, but they won't pay for the backbone of
their industry," said Ann Chaitovitz, national director of sound
recordings for the American Federation of Television and Radio
Artists.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, hundreds of Webcasters nationwide shut down their
streams to protest and raise awareness of the issue. And Thursday,
KCRW-FM (89.9), which operates three Internet music streams, began a
weeklong series of editorials and interviews to educate listeners
about the debate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just about KCRW, it's about the whole philosophy of the
Internet and an open source of music and culture," said Jason
Georges, KCRW's Webmaster. "In broadcast there are very, very few
sources of alternative music, while on the Web there are hundreds and
hundreds of sources. And the concern is, all of that will go away."</TE>
<TE>   The battle began in 1998, when Congress passed the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, which was supposed to codify the rules and
regulations for playing music over the Internet as well as compensate
artists and record companies for the use of their work. They have
never gotten royalties from conventional radio, because Congress for
decades has accepted the argument that the stations offer invaluable
free promotion simply by playing the music. The rationale for
Internet royalties was the belief that, unlike with conventional
radio, listeners could make perfect copies of the music off the
Web--a possibility that Webcasters contend is not technically
feasible.</TE>
<TE>   When royalty negotiations between Webcasters and the recording
industry failed, the U.S. Copyright Office authorized the Copyright
Arbitration Royalty Panel, or CARP, to set the rates. The
three-member panel came back in February, recommending that
Internet-only Webcasters pay 0.14 cents per song per listener
($.0014), which, at roughly 15 songs per hour, comes to about 2
cents. Radio stations simulcasting on the Internet would pay half
that, and noncommercial broadcasters would pay 0.02 cents. The
minimum annual fee would be $500, but Webcasters contend the fees for
medium-sized operations could escalate to hundreds of thousands of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, the [copyright act] came into effect when the Web
was overhyped and seemed like it could be profitable," Georges said.</TE>
<TE>   It also seemed as if it would be the promised land for music
listeners and programmers who wanted to branch out from the sounds
available over the airwaves and listen to things they couldn't hear
from their local stations. But in truth, Webcasters range from those
dilettantes spinning their favorite tunes in their basements to
industry behemoths, such as Clear Channel Communications, which
simulcasts on the Web some of the 1,200 radio stations it owns
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to work with the Webcasters. We don't want to put anybody
out of business," said AFTRA's Chaitovitz. "We want to foster the
growth of these new outlets, as the breadth and diversity on the
radio shrinks.</TE>
<TE>   "What's basically happened is the big guys, they don't want to
pay," she said. "Most of the rates quoted are false. And the $500
isn't going to put anybody out of business."</TE>
<TE>   She added that the Recording Industry Assn. of America and the
artists' unions want to work with the hobbyists, amateurs and other
small fry and are already negotiating with college radio stations and
the National Assn. of Community Broadcasters to set separate fees for
nonprofits and small outlets.</TE>
<TE>   But Kurt Hanson, publisher of the Radio and Internet Newsletter
and organizer of Wednesday's online "Day of Silence," said the
hobbyists will already be gone if the proposed fees go into effect.
Most individuals get online using a service such as Live365.com,
which, for fees starting at $6.95 a month, hosts 47,000 streams of
programming ranging from U.K. garage bands to Christian music. "If
Live365 can't stay in business, those 47,000 hobbyists can't
broadcast," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Radio stations and Webcasters do pay royalties to songwriters, but
those fees are based on a percentage of the station's revenue and
amount to far less than what the artist royalties could entail.
Webcasters are asking that the Copyright Office amend the fee
schedule to include a provision for paying a percentage of
revenue--an amendment they say would save small Webcasters who make
little or no profit by substantially reducing the fees they pay.</TE>
<TE>   "Webcasters aren't objecting to paying a royalty," Hanson said.
"What the RIAA doesn't realize, and what people trying to sell
records do realize, is that Internet radio is good for the industry.
It gives airplay to dozens of styles that don't get airplay on
broadcast radio.... If they approve the CARP recommendations, it
destroys the industry."</TE>
<TE>   The Librarian of Congress, whose agency oversees the Copyright
Office, is scheduled to either impose or amend the recommended fees
May 21, so Webcasters are lobbying members of Congress to influence
its decision. In addition, the Copyright Office has scheduled a
public round-table discussion of the issue for next Friday in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue right now is one of timing. It shuts down the industry
at a very sensitive point," as it is starting to gain momentum in
listeners and advertising, said Zack Zalon, general manager of Radio
Free Virgin, a Los Angeles-based network of 46 music channels owned
by British entrepreneur Richard Branson.</TE>
<TE>   The music industry needs Internet radio to break new acts and
expose listeners to a wide range of music, and Webcasters need the
music to fill their shows. "Everybody needs each other here. We're
looking for a fair and balanced approach," Zalon said, adding that
he's hopeful a consensus can be reached between Webcasters and the
music industry sooner or later.</TE>
<TE>   "The digital radio industry is going to be huge. It just takes a
little bit of faith and a little bit of patience," he said. "Maybe
I'm being overly optimistic, but I think this is going to work out
fine for everybody in the long run."</TE>

<HD>Dafoe's Role as Green Goblin Isn't the Stretch It Might
Seem</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY DRETZKA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Willem Dafoe action figure ... what will they think of next?</LD>
<LD>   Of all the hundreds of actors working in Hollywood, this intense
and cerebral performance artist would have to be among those least
likely to be immortalized in "super-poseable, highly articulated"
plastic.</LD>
<LD>   Stroll through any Wal-Mart or Toys R Us, and you'll find shelves
full of action figures that resemble the Rock, Arnold Schwarzenegger
Sylvester Stallone, Eminem, even the Simpsons. Last year, one
adventurous toy maker produced a series of promotional figurines
inspired by the jewel thieves in "Reservoir Dogs" (Mr. Blonde came
with a straight razor).</LD>
<TE>   Dafoe, who fully embodies the demonic Green Goblin in
"Spider-Man," couldn't hide a toothy grin after being coaxed into
acknowledging the existence of his very own action figure. The wiry
Wisconsin native squirms nervously in his rattan chair and tries not
to look too embarrassed by this unexpected concession to
commercialism.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, next thing, people will start recognizing me in shopping
malls," quipped Dafoe, sipping on a Gan Bei Longevity Tonic in the
garden of the Elixir tearoom on Melrose. "I've never really been
involved in such a big production ... one that's had as much
integration of special effects with traditional scenes. 'Flight of
the Intruder' was an action movie ... and 'Last Temptation [of
Christ]' even had some.</TE>
<TE>   "On stage, I'm always doing physical stuff. So, I guess, that was
one of the attractions of this role."</TE>
<TE>   These days, many less-than-buff stars rely on computer-generated
imagery, or CGI, technicians, makeup artists and strength coaches to
mask their physical limitations. Not Dafoe.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have a trainer," brags Dafoe, whose taut, wiry body
seems to be devoid of even an ounce of fat. "I knew it wouldn't all
be CGI.... I'd have to perform quite a bit of the actual fighting and
glider work myself. Unfortunately, though, a lot of the blue-screen
and wire work didn't end up on the screen."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's farfetched to think that "Spider-Man" merchandise
will be sold this summer in the lobby of the Wooster Group's
Performing Garage, back in New York. In a world where studio press
kits can be found on EBay, however, anything is possible.</TE>
<TE>   Truth is, Dafoe fits right into the pantheon of action stars.</TE>
<TE>   In Sam Raimi's reconstruction of the "Spider-Man" legend, Peter
Parker and Norman Osborn experience parallel metamorphoses. This
deviates from the blueprint drawn 40 years ago by Stan Lee and Steve
Ditko, but it does no disservice to their creative vision.</TE>
<TE>   Some time compression was necessary, because it wasn't until issue
No. 14 of "Amazing Spider-Man" that the bomb-throwing villain was
introduced to readers.</TE>
<TE>   "Growing up, I was aware of the Marvel superheroes, but I wasn't
much of comic-book reader," concedes Dafoe. . "It wasn't as if I was
against reading them, it's just that I wasn't doing it. My
introduction to comic books was through Zap Comix and Zippy the
Pinhead.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are the images I'd see when I visited my older brothers and
sisters at the University of Wisconsin."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of following his seven siblings to Madison, Dafoe left his
Midwest hometown of Appleton, Wis., and took off for the closest big
city, Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   He stayed at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee long enough for
a couple cups of coffee but dropped out to join the acclaimed
experimental acting company Theater X. Before long, he was on his way
to the Big Apple and the fledgling multimedia performance troupe the
Wooster Group.</TE>
<TE>   Dafoe appeared in eight films before winning praise as the
Christ-like Sgt. Elias in Oliver Stone's "Platoon," for which he
received a best supporting actor Oscar nomination. Two years later,
in 1988, he was elevated to full-blown son-of-God status, in Martin
Scorsese's "The Last Temptation of Christ."</TE>
<TE>   (In his dramatic transformation scene in "Spider-Man," there's a
moment when Dafoe looks as if he's enduring another crucifixion. He
denies, however, it's "a nod" to any previous roles.)</TE>
<TE>   While making his bones in Hollywood, playing a steady succession
of saints and sinners, priests and pushers, Dafoe also maintained his
commitment to the Wooster Group. Last year, he received a second
supporting actor Oscar nomination for his wonderfully creepy
interpretation of Max Schreck in "Shadow of the Vampire."</TE>
<TE>   Even before "Spider-Man" was released, the 46-year-old father of
one college-age son (with Wooster Group founder Elizabeth LeCompte)
has grown weary of answering questions about the eye-popping scene in
which Norman Osborn is transformed into Green Goblin. His
impressively cut torso is on full display when Osborn bursts out of
his shirt. "Everybody wants to know what I did to get in shape for
the movie, but I didn't do anything special," said Dafoe, insisting
that, while he occasionally will accept a piece of fish, he draws the
line at red meat or cheese. "I try to keep quiet about my personal
preferences. I don't want to become a cheerleader for yoga, but I'm
probably stronger now than I ever was before."</TE>
<TE>   Because he was in such good shape, Dafoe volunteered to perform
the majority of the stunts himself.</TE>
<TE>   "He's extremely flexible and an extremely quick learner," confirms
stunt coordinator Jeff Habberstad. "At one point during the scene in
which Norman Osborn becomes the Green Goblin, Willem is required to
jump onto the top edge of the glass chamber. That morning, though,
Sam [Raimi] and Willem got to talking and decided, 'Wouldn't it be
cool if Norman could leap 25 feet in the air, from the edge of the
glass, and land on the ground right in front of the camera?'</TE>
<TE>   "We ended up running over to another stage, building a special
harness--remember, he wouldn't have a shirt on--then tested it and
shot the scene after lunch."</TE>
<TE>   When Spider-Man and Green Goblin do battle on the screen, many in
the audience will wonder whether they're watching actors or stunt
doubles under those body suits. The costumes are consistent with the
mythos, however.</TE>
<TE>   As conceived by Lee and Ditko, Spider-Man not only was one of the
first superheroes to rise up from humble, middle-class roots, but he
also was the first to wear a head-to-toe costume. Any pullback from
that decision probably would leave fans howling.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge became designing costumes in which the personalities
of the actors and characters would allow full freedom of movement and
facial expression.</TE>
<TE>   "When Willem came into the first fitting, he did the splits and
said, 'I want my costume to be flexible enough for me to do this,'"
recalled costume designer James Acheson, for whom "Spider-Man" was
his first Hollywood production. "He's a yogi and probably the most
flexible actor I've ever worked with. He wanted to do as much of his
own stunt work as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed to sculpt the costume to Willem's body, yet give it a
certain amount of elasticity."</TE>
<TE>   Habberstad was involved in the design process as well.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first went over there, they only had a puppet of what the
Goblin was going to look like," he said. "We picked out the major
points where we would be hooking wires up to a harness under the
costume. They designed the costume around those points, so we could
pick him up from his back or hips and do several different things on
wires."</TE>
<TE>   The masks presented yet another dilemma.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that you wouldn't always be able to see the Goblin's eyes
or mouth, so he'd have to express himself vocally and through body
language," Dafoe said. "That was a challenge, because you don't want
to make it a dumb show, overstate things or indicate them. You only
want to invest as much motion as is needed to perform the required
actions."</TE>
<TE>   Acheson wasn't sold on the preliminary illustrations provided him
of Green Goblin. He felt as if they made the villain look "cheesy."
He entrusted Amalgamated Dynamics Inc. with the responsibility of
creating a face for the character.</TE>
<TE>   "As drawn he was very cartoony," said Tom Woodruff Jr., co-founder
of the Chatsworth-based company, which specializes in special makeup,
prosthetics and creature effects. "It was a good enough concept, but
it would be difficult for a contemporary audience to accept that
character as the villain. The first thing we did was get the go-ahead
from Sam Raimi to explore a design concept in which we developed a
prosthetic ... an appliance makeup ... for the character.</TE>
<TE>   "We developed a prosthetic appliance made of a translucent
silicone material. Because of the structure of the Goblin's forehead,
we also built a very low-profile, low-relief radio-control mechanism
to articulate the brow."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone agreed it looked great, but, perhaps, was a bit too
emotive.</TE>
<TE>   "Sam thought we should go with something more static ... sort of a
tribal, ceremonial mask as an inspiration," Woodruff said. "From that
came the idea that Osborn was a collector of masks, which you see on
the walls of his office."</TE>
<TE>   Acheson insisted that they come up with a mask that "retained the
Green Goblin's face ... , that terrifying mouth and eyes. In all the
drawings, his mouth is locked into that maniacal scream."</TE>
<TE>   And so it remains.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the costume was intended to resemble a "high-tech
flying suit" and reference the streamlined look of Green Goblin's
glider. Dafoe describes the glider experience as being a "cross
between surfing and riding a bull. If you don't stay with it, it's
very unforgiving."</TE>
<TE>   For his next "outsider" role, in Paul Shrader's "Auto Focus,"
Dafoe leaves fantasy behind and returns to the realm of the merely
perverse. In it, he portrays John Carpenter, a pioneer in the art of
video voyeurism and slain "Hogan's Heroes" star Bob Crane's partner
in sleaze.</TE>
<TE>   "The characters I play are outsiders; they don't function as
villains," he said. "One role informs the next. I think all your
lessons are learned intuitively, and you don't have to be able to
articulate them.</TE>
<TE>   "You empathize so deeply, you want to be dissolved into that
character."</TE>

<HD>Exhibition Seeks to Reinstate Banjo to Its Rightful Place</HD>
<DH>Collection* A showcase in Massachusetts highlights
'America's Instrument' and tracks the part it has played in our
heritage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THEO EMERY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LEXINGTON, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Banjos have bounced on the knees of slaves and mountain folk, leaned
in the corners of Boston mansions and stolen the stages of music
halls.</LD>
<LD>   But the humble banjo, which evolved from its African roots to
become 19th century America's most popular instrument, strummed its
way right out of the musical mainstream.</LD>
<LD>   An exhibition called "The Banjo: The People and the Sounds of
America's Instrument," on view at the National Heritage Museum in
Lexington through Sept. 3, seeks to restore "America's instrument" to
its rightful place.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a lot of different stories to be told. It's one of the
few really American instruments," said Jim Bollman, a collector who
donated many of the instruments in the Lexington exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say the banjo has strummed its last chords. After
all, it remains a main ingredient in folk and bluegrass music, and
the instrument sees periodic revivals, such as in the success of the
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack, which won this year's Grammy
for album of the year.</TE>
<TE>   More than 60 banjos are on display, including an akonting--the
banjo's predecessor from Gambia. There also are ornate "presentation
banjos" made of cherry, mahogany and rosewood--even whalebone--inlaid
with mother-of-pearl floral patterns, and silver- and gold-plated
strings.</TE>
<TE>   Other instruments range from a Henry P. Stichter banjo made in
1847 to a brand-new Deering "Crossfire" solid-body banjo. More than
50 of them come from Bollman's personal collection; some would fetch
tens of thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   There are also displays of sheet music, lithographs, pottery and
posters featuring the instruments, including William Sydney Mount's
1865 painting "The Banjo Player." Also featured are items that
demonstrate the role of minstrel shows, with their crass and cruel
characterizations of blacks, that were so much a part of the
instrument's history.</TE>
<TE>   Bela Fleck's Grammy is on view, and there's also a poster of
Kermit the Frog with a banjo on his knee in "The Muppet Movie."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the banjo's down-home strains have largely become
associated with whimsy and folklore, and even a sense of the corny,
said Phyllis Barney, executive director of the North American Folk
Music and Dance Alliance in Silver Spring, Md.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to evoke a feeling of home or country, you just need
a couple of bars of the banjo, and if you have your eyes closed,
you're looking across a wheat field," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It is believed that the banjo's predecessor was the akonting,
fashioned from gourds and animal hides that came to America with
slaves.</TE>
<TE>   It was largely an instrument of Southern blacks in the early 1800s
and was rarely seen in the North. It was an everyman's instrument
that even the poorest porch musician could afford.</TE>
<TE>   "You could make a banjo out of a dead groundhog and a coffee can
and a few sticks of wood and some stove bolts, and they regularly did
that in the South," Bollman said.</TE>
<TE>   But the impatient banjo didn't stay South. It became a favorite
prop of minstrel shows that traveled north and west with circuses.
"It's kind of an icon for minstrelsy, and by extension racism and
bigotry," Bollman said.</TE>
<TE>   The shows became enormously popular. By the 1860s, some 160
minstrel companies played to huge crowds around the nation,
introducing the country to the worst stereotypes of blacks but also
to black spirituals and songs as well as Irish ballads, German folk
songs and opera.</TE>
<TE>   "When you want genuine music--music that will come right home to
you like a bad quarter, suffuse your system like strychnine whisky
... just smash your piano and invoke the glory-beaming banjo!" said
Mark Twain in 1865.</TE>
<TE>   The new popularity also meant a booming market. Hundreds of
patents were issued for improvements, and instrument makers,
including A.C. Fairbanks, William A. Cole and Bay State in Boston,
began manufacturing "presentation banjos" for the wealthy.</TE>
<TE>   At the Heritage Museum show, Eugene and Gwynne McKenzie of Memphis
lingered over the presentation banjos made to please the ears and the
eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "They're so beautiful," said Gwynne McKenzie, 66. "I think they
put the art in it not so that it would be displayed, but because they
wanted to play a beautiful instrument."</TE>
<TE>   As jazz guitar slowly edged out the banjo in popular music, its
fortunes faded, and the Depression knocked the banjo out of the hands
of common folks.</TE>
<TE>   "People didn't need them, and they weren't crucial to living for
someone to get through the day, just like lots of other excesses,"
Bollman said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the banjo maintains an important spot in American music
tradition but is rarely heard on the airwaves. Traditional music
enthusiasts were all the more dumbfounded by the success of "O
Brother, Where Art Thou?"--so much so that folk groups recently held
a "Roots Music Industry Summit" in Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a real need to get away from being spoon-fed your
entertainment, so music buyers are more interested in digging a
little deeper" into traditional American music, Barney said.</TE>

<HD>Savage Drama From Furious Theatre</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Saturday Night at the Palace," the inaugural production of the
Furious Theatre Company, may not be a perfect debut. However, it is
an ambitious and richly rendered effort by an impressive new group
that bears watching.</LD>
<LD>   The group's new performance space, part of a former
plastic-container factory in Pasadena, has been handsomely
reconfigured into a 99-seat black-box theater, the backdrop for set
designer Melissa Teoh's minutely rendered re-creation of a flyspecked
roadhouse.</LD>
<LD>   The technical production, including Christie Wright's unobtrusive
lighting, is first-rate, although the acoustics of the space, which
has been masked off by black draperies within a cavernous shipping
and receiving area, are difficult. But the success of this production
hinges on the material itself, South African playwright Paul
Slabolepszy's savage apartheid-era drama, seen here in its U.S.
premiere.</LD>
<TE>   In the play, September (Sean Blakemore), the Zulu manager of a
small burger joint on the outskirts of Johannesburg, is just closing
up for the night when his regular routine is rudely interrupted by
the arrival of Vince (Shawn Lee) and Forsie (Eric Pargac),
twentysomething white youths who have apparently broken down on the
road. The bitterly racist Vince, an emotionally disturbed delinquent
with dreams of becoming a soccer star, is the flashpoint for the
explosion to follow. But it is Forsie, a childlike "nice guy" whose
egalitarian principles ultimately extend only as far as his own
self-interest, who most shocks and dismays us.</TE>
<TE>   At first, director Damaso Rodriguez's staging is inappropriately
broad, as are the performances, with the exception of the
pitch-perfect Blakemore. Vince initially comes across as a swaggering
stereotype, while Pargac is so comically obtuse that he smacks of
Graham Chapman in his Monty Python "Village Idiot" routine.
Fortunately, both Lee and Pargac gradually assume the authority and
momentum necessary for the agonizing denouement.</TE>
<TE>   Why it took so long for Slabolepszy's harrowing parable of
powerlessness and privilege to reach this country is a mystery, but
the Young Turks at Furious are to be commended for their choice, as
well as this difficult but rewarding first production.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Saturday Night at the Palace," Furious Theatre, Armory Northwest,
965 N. Fair Oaks Ave., Pasadena. Fridays-Sundays, 8:30 p.m. $15. Ends

<HD>'Music Man' Knows How to Charm</HD>
<DH>As a small band of picketers protest the use of nonunion
performers, the well-appointed production marches in with lively
numbers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was trouble--and not only in River City--when "The Music Man"
opened at the Orange County Performing Arts Center's Segerstrom Hall
on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Well, not that much trouble.</LD>
<LD>   This first national tour of the 2000 Broadway revival of the
Meredith Willson musical is at the center of a labor dispute over its
use of nonunion actors and musicians.</LD>
<TE>   So, clusters of peaceful but determined members of American
Federation of Musicians Local 7 picketed outside the parking lot on
opening night, distributing leaflets in protest. One sign read
"Non-Union Means Amateur."</TE>
<TE>   Protesting union versus nonunion wages and benefits, or lack
thereof, is more to the point; "amateur" is unfair. This production,
bathed in a soft glow of nostalgia, may not electrify, but it's a
handsome charmer, from the overture, performed by some orchestra
members in red band uniforms in a train compartment on stage, to the
surprise curtain-call finale involving many trombones (and an anvil).</TE>
<TE>   In Willson's Corn Belt classic, flimflam man Professor Harold Hill
awakens a strait-laced, turn-of-the-20th century Iowa town to romance
and heady new life as he bamboozles residents with his bogus scheme
for a marching band.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are no breakout performances in the serviceable
cast, it pulls its weight and steps lively, seamlessly directed by
Ray Roderick (the staging is based on Susan Stroman's Broadway
direction and choreography).</TE>
<TE>   As Professor Hill, Gerritt VanderMeer lacks the roguish
muscularity that Robert Preston brought to the role, and his vocals
are a bit pallid, but he complements his tall, romantic-lead presence
with the lithe movements of a dancer, and sparks fly when he gets
Carolann M. Sanita's Marian in a clinch.</TE>
<TE>   Sanita's graceful Marian doesn't resonate with much depth either,
until she sings, sending her full, liquid soprano soaring, especially
in the musical's loveliest ballad, "Till There Was You."</TE>
<TE>   Overmiking muffled some dialogue and lyrics, particularly in the
first act, and Pam Feicht as Mrs. Paroo projects her hearty Irish
lilt a mite too enthusiastically for comfort. But small comic moments
are well-realized and the big numbers are bouncy fun, particularly
the physically demanding, comic "Rock Island" talk song, "Seventy Six
Trombones" and "Marian the Librarian."</TE>
<TE>   The barbershop quartet--Kent Alan Bollman, Dan Debenport, Evan
Harrington and Joacquin Stevens--is deservedly a crowd favorite, and
so are the two solidly professional child actors, Joseph Fanelli as
lisping Winthrop Paroo and Angela Deangelo as feisty Amaryllis.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hill's ripe-for-plucking, Norman Rockwell-ish River
City blooms into being with tree-lined streets, town square,
gymnasium, library, park and Marian the Librarian's candy box
Victorian house and parlor, courtesy of scenic designer J. Branson's
sumptuous set pieces, scrims and backdrops. Tom Reiter's period
costumes are gorgeous, and so is the notable artistry of lighting
designer Charlie Morrison. Moonlight has rarely looked so lovely on
stage.</TE>
<TE>   "The Music Man," Orange County Performing Arts Center, Segerstrom
Hall, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, today, 8 p.m.; Saturday, 2
and 8 p.m.; Sunday, 2 and 7:30 p.m. (Saturday, 2 p.m., will be
sign-language interpreted.) $20-$55. (714) 556-2787, (213) 365-3500.

<HD>On Lauryn Hill's New Album, Less Would Have Been More</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Lauryn Hill asks, "What's going on?" during a song on her new
live album, she's trying to draw a parallel between the anxious
social consciousness in her new tunes and the classic strains of the
late Marvin Gaye.</LD>
<LD>   Puzzled listeners of Hill's disjointed new album, however, may be
asking themselves, "What's going on?" in a less flattering way.</LD>
<LD>   If it seemed Hill could do little wrong four years ago when her
acclaimed debut album arrived, she doesn't seem able to do much right
in the new "MTV Unplugged No. 2.0," which will be released Tuesday by
Columbia Records.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike most "Unplugged" albums, this two-disc package is not a
career retrospective. None of the material from Hill's richly
absorbing, Grammy-winning "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" album is
featured.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Hill, whose stylishly arranged tales of pride and
sisterhood opened commercial doors for such inviting soul newcomers
as Alicia Keys and Jill Scott, offers 11 new songs, backed almost
exclusively by her own acoustic guitar work. This kind of daring is
all too rare in pop, but the boldness isn't accompanied by any
consistent discipline and craft.</TE>
<TE>   At times you can't tell whether the album, recorded last summer,
is drawn from a concert or a press conference. Hill, who has been
largely absent from the pop scene for three years, wants to chronicle
some traumatic personal times, and she apparently doesn't feel the
songs alone are enough to tell the story.</TE>
<TE>   The 26-year-old New Jersey native spends nearly a quarter of the
100-plus-minute album talking to the audience, and the commentary is
often rambling, tedious and self-indulgent.</TE>
<TE>   In the new songs, Hill celebrates a spiritual awakening that
followed what she describes as a soul-draining period filled with
disillusionment stemming from show-business demands, the legal system
and the country's social apathy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a new day," she says at the start. "I used to be a
performer. I really don't consider myself a performer so much
anymore. I'm sharing, more or less, the music that I've been given."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Hill reaffirms the changes in her world since the night she
accepted five Grammys for her work on "Miseducation," a record at the
time for a female artist on a single night. She tells the audience
that she had to overcome a lot of resistance, presumably from friends
and business associates, in shedding her old show-biz ways. "People
were saying, 'Money is changing her.' I say, 'Listen, the money is
not changing me. God is changing me.'"</TE>
<TE>   The singer-rapper speaks a lot about torment and redemption in the
songs, and there are times when she is touching through her images
and raw emotion.</TE>
<TE>   "I Find It Hard to Say (Rebel)" is an eloquent prayer for social
justice inspired by her sense of outrage after the 1999 New York City
police killing of Amadou Diallo, a black West African immigrant who
was shot 44 times. "Just Want You Around" is also a moving expression
of devotion that could be directed at either a lover or God.</TE>
<TE>   But some of the tunes, such as the opening "Mr. Intentional," are
so vague that they are meaningless, while others, including "Mystery
of Iniquity," an attack against the justice system, seem more a
personal diatribe than a thoughtful reflection. (Hill went through a
highly publicized legal skirmish with four musicians over production
credit on the "Miseducation" album. The case was settled in 2000 for
an undisclosed sum.)</TE>
<TE>   Rather than insist that every minute of the MTV taping be included
on the album, Hill should have slashed most of the 25 minutes of
talk, dropped some marginal songs and edited the remaining ones more
tightly.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, you can see what the resulting single-disc collection
would have sounded like in the one-hour version of the "MTV
Unplugged" taping that debuts tonight at 10 p.m. on MTV. (A longer
version of Hill's "Unplugged" session has already been shown on
MTV2.)</TE>
<TE>   In the shorter show, Hill, dressed casually in a denim jacket and
jeans, ranges from joyful to tender, sometimes testifying to her
religious faith, then suddenly breaking into tears during the
reflective "I Gotta Find Peace of Mind."</TE>
<TE>   There are moments in the program when you feel a link with the
command and insight of the artist who delivered "Miseducation." But
in the full album, the excesses simply smother the few moments of
genuine creative impulse.</TE>
<TE>   Why would Hill's record label let her put out such a cumbersome
effort?</TE>
<TE>   "It's a work of art that is incredibly deep," a label spokesman
said in March. "We're completely behind it."</TE>
<TE>   Well, maybe.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Columbia management team fears the worst, however, it
has to publicly support Hill's wishes. The last thing the label
wants, at a time when record companies are being widely accused of
artistic insensitivity, is to get into a public debate with someone
whose debut album was such a major commercial and critical success.</TE>
<TE>   If the album is an unexpected hit, the label is a double winner.
Besides the sales, it will have maintained the artist's respect and
trust. If "Unplugged" is a failure, it might be seen by the public as
simply a side step and the next Hill album could be promoted as the
true follow-up to "Miseducation."</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the responsibility for releasing the unedited
"Unplugged" ultimately rests with Hill.</TE>
<TE>   During one of her talks on the album, Hill says life is all about
learning from mistakes. "A friend of mine once said to me that if we
weren't supposed to turn around, why does the car have a steering
wheel?" she says. "We just supposed to crash into the wall?"</TE>
<TE>   From the looks of this album, the friend must have forgotten to
also tell her about the brakes. In "MTV Unplugged No. 2.0," she
simply didn't know where to stop.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The buzz is building, and I'm so excited.</LD>
<LD>   "Entertainment Tonight," "Extra" and "Access Hollywood" have
called. Oprah has called. Larry King has called. Bill O'Reilly has
called. Rush Limbaugh has called. Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat have
called.</LD>
<LD>   I'm trying not to get emotional, but knowing they care means a
lot. You see, this day is very significant to me.</LD>
<TE>   It's the anniversary of my April 29 column.</TE>
<TE>   Has it really been four days since I wrote so magnificently about
the PBS series "Frontier House," working myself into a good cry over
my tender, graceful prose?</TE>
<TE>   It seems like only ... this week.</TE>
<TE>   I thank me for being so splendid. I thank me for thanking me. Hey,
will I please stop it? Can't I see I'm blushing, that I'm
embarrassing myself with my praise of me? Go on, me, get outta here
with all that public affection.</TE>
<TE>   You're thinking, what's the big deal? Well excuse me, but don't
fault someone for getting swept up in the self-adoring anniversary
fever now raging on TV. Never in memory have as many prime-time
reunions and retrospectives been packed so tightly into a
concentrated period.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving Sunday may be the biggest head case of all, "NBC's 75th
Anniversary," in which the network will spend three hours
bear-hugging itself for being NBC.</TE>
<TE>   I must compose myself. I'm tearing up again. It's just so moving.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, brother. Although this industry has spent much of the last
half-century kissing up to itself, we surely have "Carol Burnett Show
Stoppers"--along with our own hunger for nostalgia as a retreat from
troubles of the present--to thank for this latest orgy of TV
narcissism.</TE>
<TE>   The Burnett special's popularity a few months ago delivered this
commandment to programmers: Thou shalt make similar U-turns
throughout this month's ratings sweeps.</TE>
<TE>   So CBS reran its Burnett program last week and tapped her to also
host its "CBS: 50 Years From TV City" special, which drew sizable
ratings on Saturday. While the network was at it, CBS on Sunday
toasted the first six years of "Everybody Loves Raymond." In 2003,
there will be seven years to toast.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight features more euphoria, by the way, with Dick Clark
hosting "American Bandstand's 50th ... A Celebration" on ABC.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Tuesday brought NBC's "Bob Hope's Funniest Outtakes,"
which should have been billed as an hour of "Fear Factor," and later
that night it presented another prime-time bouquet, this one to Jay
Leno for his decade of hosting "The Tonight Show."</TE>
<TE>   Lasting nearly all month, in fact, NBC's celebration is not only
the giddiest but probably the longest TV birthday bash in history. If
the ratings hold, NBC History Month may become an annual event on the
network rivaling Black History Month.</TE>
<TE>   It also includes a May 12 movie reuniting the cast of "L.A. Law."
And arriving later in May are "'The Cosby Show' Retrospective," plus
90 minutes touting NBC's Thursday night lineups as "Must-See TV" and
an hour of "NBC's Funniest Outtakes." No way could they be as
depressing as Hope's outtakes.</TE>
<TE>   To show you how determined NBC is about this, it asked the
nation's TV critics to take part in its jubilee by picking their
favorite NBC shows and having their choices printed in the network's
75th anniversary publicity packet. Coming through were such sure bets
as "Hill Street Blues," "The West Wing," "Seinfeld," "Cheers" and
"Saturday Night Live." As evidence that rationality is not necessary
for writing about TV, however, one critic tried to make a case for
"Car 54, Where Are You?"</TE>
<TE>   What is the big deal?</TE>
<TE>   Looking backward can be comforting. When watching a newscast or
reading a newspaper these days, who doesn't yearn for a past that our
selective memories misinform us was simpler and less acrimonious. So
there's lots to be said for noting anniversaries that do not stir
memories of hatred, destruction and death. Take media histories
recalling the Los Angeles riots of 1992. No laughs there. And more
painful memories are coming next 9/11.</TE>
<TE>   Yet most of these entertainment shows are being staged by an
industry on the cutting edge of chalky decadence, one less interested
in pursuing new ideas than in brushing away cobwebs and
congratulating itself for old ones.</TE>
<TE>   Look what else is in the wings, for example.</TE>
<TE>   Coming Monday on CBS is a retrospective of "The Honeymooners," and
Tuesday on ABC, the schlemiel, schlimazel of "Entertainment Tonight
Presents: Laverne &amp; Shirley Again." Then on May 13, CBS returns with
a clip extravaganza that reunites the cast of "The Mary Tyler Moore
Show." On the same night, ABC will air "TV Guide's 50 Best Shows of
All Time."</TE>
<TE>   No. 25 on the list is "MASH," being feted May 17 in a "30th
anniversary reunion special" on Fox, whose parent company's TV wing
produced the series.</TE>
<TE>   Showcasing its sense of the absurd, moreover, ABC has scheduled
for May 21 a "That's Incredible" reunion honoring one of the least
honest, least defensible series ever, a blight that someone once
dismissed as a "freak show annex" to NBC's "Real People." That is
incredible.</TE>
<TE>   You can make a case, at least, for testimonials to Burnett, "The
Honeymooners," "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and "MASH," which remind
us how good television can be, and that some comedy transcends age.
Yet most of these shows are being unzipped from their body bags only
because of their potential for profit, reunions and clip shows being
easy to promote--just march in the big names--and relatively cheap to
produce.</TE>
<TE>   If this really takes off, get ready for the next wave, and the
wave after that. How about an Olsen twins retrospective? Or a CBS
tribute to "Mister Ed"? I'm pulling for a boffo night on ABC
celebrating "The Flying Nun." Has it really been 32 years?</TE>
<TE>   As Ralph Kramden would say: "Pow! Right in the kisser."</TE>

<HD>Woody Allen's Familiar Screen Persona Isn't Aging Well</HD>
<DH>In 'Hollywood Ending,' the actor-writer-director's usual
neurotic nebbish is present, but this character has seen better days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's as sad and painful to report as it is to experience, but
"Hollywood Ending" makes the conclusion inescapable: Woody Allen has
become his own worst enemy.</LD>
<LD>   Allen is, of course, one of the iconic figures in American comic
cinema. But where once his presence in the films he wrote and
directed was a good part of what made them unforgettable, his
appearance in "Hollywood Ending" makes parts of it close to
unwatchable. When a film's bad guy, in this case Treat Williams'
Neanderthal Hollywood producer, seems more worthy of the girl than
Allen's nominal hero, you know something is wrong.</LD>
<LD>   The characters Allen plays, in this case a film director named Val
Waxman, are the same nebbishy Manhattan-loving neurotics they have
always been. What's changed is that as the actor has gotten older,
those once-engaging character traits have ossified and lost their
charm. In fact, they've become so strident and dyspeptic that they
completely throw you out of the picture.</LD>
<TE>   It especially strains credulity to have Allen's characters
invariably end up with their youthful, attractive co-stars (in this
case a producer played by Tea Leoni). No matinee idol has more
insistently cultivated his on-screen romantic image than Allen, who
gets the girl no matter how unlikely the scenario. This even though
the sight of him passionately embracing those increasingly younger
women gets harder and harder to take seriously.</TE>
<TE>   In fairness to Allen the actor, it's been quite some time since
Allen the writer-director has given him consistently worthwhile
material to work with. Despite the near-reverence Allen's frequently
surrounded by (one co-star calls him "this amazing genius ... this
legend"), of the seven big-screen films he's written, directed and
starred in over the past decade, no more than one or two are worth a
second look.</TE>
<TE>   Meager though it ends up, "Hollywood Ending" is initially
promising. It's a movie-business story, a genre that tends to get the
juices flowing; it's got an effective cast; and, at least until
Allen's increasingly unpleasant presence drains the film of all
discernible life, it does not fail to amuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood Ending" opens at a "creative meeting" of the top people
at Galaxie Studio, including head man Hal (Williams), his right hand
Ed (George Hamilton) and a producer, Ellie (Leoni), who happens to be
both Val's ex-wife and Hal's current fiancee.</TE>
<TE>   Galaxie has a new project, "Streets of New York," which Ellie
thinks would be perfect for Val, but because he's such a neurotic
perfectionist, it's been years since anyone's trusted him with a
feature. In fact, Val's funny first appearance is in a Canadian
blizzard, preparing to shoot a deodorant commercial. "Have you ever
seen Canada?" he asks his even-younger-than-Ellie girlfriend Lori
(Debra Messing) when he gets back. "Now I know why there's no crime
up there."</TE>
<TE>   Even though, as his agent Al Hack (a well-cast Mark Rydell)
reminds him, his last offer was for a geriatric diaper ad, Val is
reluctant to take an offer from his ex and her new beau. "He's a
philistine, she's a quisling, they have a religious conflict," he
says before concluding, "I would kill for this job, but the people
I'd like to kill are offering me the job."</TE>
<TE>   While all this is not exactly sidesplitting, it's more amusing
than what happens when Ellie and Val confront each other for the
first time, a meeting which sends his character into whine overdrive.
This "bicker and then bond" story line plays as it did with Helen
Hunt in last year's "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion," and Val's
persona is deeply off-putting, an unintentional warning about the
perils of staying that neurotic that deeply into middle age.</TE>
<TE>   Equally unhappy is "Hollywood Ending's" one-joke plot
complication, the notion that Val's anxiety gets so intense it brings
on a case of hysterical blindness. Val as a sightless director pushes
this film to concentrate more and more on his incessant worrying and
complaining to the exclusion of all else, making it progressively
less and less funny.</TE>
<TE>   Paradoxically, as with John Cusack in "Bullets Over Broadway" and
Sean Penn in "Sweet and Lowdown," Allen has had good luck over the
past decade casting other men in the starring roles. But much like
the film's Val, who feels compelled to put his girlfriend in "Streets
of New York" even though everyone knows she's completely
inappropriate, he can't not give himself the lead. Whether this is
art imitating life or life imitating art, it's an unhappy situation
all around.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for some drug references and sexual material.
Times guidelines: Lots of sexual innuendo.</TE>

<HD>Two Sisters, Not Your Typical Servants</HD>
<DH>'Murderous Maids,' a French film based on a 1933 incident,
may be the most accurate take yet on what happened and why.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As literal a title as "Murderous Maids" is, it by no means tells all
in regard to this most compelling psychological drama. Filmmaker
Jean-Pierre Denis makes plausible a terrible incident that occurred
in Le Mans in 1933--one that has inspired Jean Genet's play "The
Maids" and at least three films, including the outstanding 1994
English-language "Sister My Sister."</LD>
<LD>   "Murderous Maids" may well be the most comprehensive of these
films and also strike closest to the truth. Working from Paulette
Houdyer's book "L'affaire Papin," Denis is so skilled, imaginative
and perceptive that he sustains his sympathetic, socially critical
view of his heroines' narrow existence.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, he spends a good portion of his film telling us about the
lives of the sisters Christine and Lea Papin before they took their
fateful posts as maids to the prosperous Lancelin family.
Essentially, the film is Christine's story. The eldest of three
sisters, Christine (Sylvie Testud), early on begins feeling hatred
for her often selfish and irresponsible mother Clemence (Isabelle
Renauld), whose husband leaves her and who then packs off Christine,
then 11, and her middle daughter Emilia to a convent school. A
hoped-for rescue by their father, unsavory as he may be, is not in
the works, for he is off to fight in World War I.</LD>
<TE>   Christine, who begins working as a maid, becomes determined to
protect her youngest sister Lea (Julie-Marie Parmentier) from both
their parents and make as secure a life for her as she can. Life as a
domestic, however, only fuels her long-simmering inner rage, thanks
to the severe, unfeeling treatment she receives from a succession of
employers. Eventually, she is hired by Madame Lancelin (Dominique
Labourier), who is impressed with Christine's skill and her gift at
anticipating tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Madame Lancelin is far more humane than any of Christine's
previous employers, but she is exacting and can be a snob, taking for
granted that servants know their place. (By contrast, in "Sister My
Sister," Julie Walters' Madame Danzard is a monster, almost comically
so, who not only treats her servants badly but also crushes the
spirit of her near-adult daughter.)</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the situation is the best Christine has known in her
entire life, and she is thrilled when she's able to get the Lancelins
to hire Lea, who is sweet but not nearly as intelligent as her older
sister. The sisters' love for each other takes on a sexual dimension
that neither was prepared for, but they embrace it rapturously. As
happy as Christine is in Lea's arms, this first experience with any
joy in life heightens her anger with her constantly unsettling mother
and her sense of injustice over her station in life as a maid.
Christine has become volatile--it won't take much to make her
explode.</TE>
<TE>   In short, Denis and Testud, in a wondrous collaboration of a
gifted director and equally gifted actress, succeed in making
Christine a tragic figure; she's worthy of the sympathy easily
extended to the innocent Lea, also beautifully played by Parmentier.
Renauld's Clemence, while not particularly likable and certainly not
admirable, is not the monster her eldest daughter considers her to
be. She's just an ordinary woman, a hardy, self-serving survivor, and
Renauld shows us all her sides.</TE>
<TE>   "Murderous Maids" marks the return to the screen after a 12-year
absence for Denis, little-known in the U.S. but an observant
filmmaker whose visual grace matches his gift at directing actors.
The truth of the Papins' inner lives will never be known, even
though, much to his surprise, Denis discovered that when he was
making this film two years ago that Lea Papin was still alive at 88
but rendered unable to speak or write by a stroke.</TE>

<HD>Take the Easy Way? No</HD>
<DH>Movies* For her feature debut, director Christine Jeffs
chose a hard-to-adapt poetic novel with difficult lead roles for
children.</DH>

<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>By SUSAN KING TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When award-winning New Zealand commercial director Christine Jeffs
finally got a chance to make a feature film, the experience wasn't
quite what she anticipated. "I had always hoped when I got a chance
to make a movie, I would have a chance to perfect shots and make it
look right," Jeffs said.</LD>
<LD>   But her film "Rain," which she made two years ago in her native
country, didn't give her the opportunity to stretch her artistic
muscles. It's a low-budget, independent production that she shot in
32 days. "We felt there was such a rush in making the film, there was
no chance for any artisticness to seep through," she said.</LD>
<LD>   "Rain," which opens today after having made the rounds of numerous
festivals, including Cannes and Sundance, is an unflinching
coming-of-age story based on the 1994 novel of the same name by
Kirsty Gunn.</LD>
<TE>   Set in the summer of 1972 at a New Zealand beach community, "Rain"
focuses on precocious and flirtatious 13-year-old Janey (Alicia
Fulford-Wierzbiki) and her young brother Jim (Aaron Murphy) as they
witness their parents' marriage slowly crumble. Their parents retreat
from their unhappiness by drinking during the nights, then nursing
their hangovers the following day in the sun.</TE>
<TE>   Janey's mother catches the attention of a drifter photographer and
begins an affair with him. When Janey discovers the affair, she
becomes angry and decides to use her burgeoning sexuality to
insinuate herself in the life of the photographer, with tragic
results.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffs was drawn to Gunn's novel when she read it in 1994. But it
was difficult to persuade producers that the mood piece could be
turned into a film. "A lot of people said to me, 'People are not
interested in a story about a girl,'" Jeffs said during a recent
visit to Los Angeles. "That kind of got my back up a bit. I was like,
'Why not?' I think it's quite a dangerous story about a girl's loss
of innocence and how family comes undone. It's very intimate for the
audience. It is not told through a voice-over of an adult looking
back."</TE>
<TE>   In the novel, the adult Janey reflects on that tumultuous summer.
Jeffs decided to discard that element. "I wanted the story to be more
immediate and for the audience to connect with the experience of the
girl," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Gunn's novel, said Jeffs, was very poetic and densely descriptive,
not easy to translate into a screenplay. "It was hard to get tangible
stuff from it," Jeffs said. Several scenes were taken from clues in
the book. "There was one line that would trigger something, and then
I would write a scene out of it. So a lot of the action and scenes in
the film didn't exist in the book except from innuendo. I wanted to
take it out of the poetic sense and give it a more tangible meaning."</TE>
<TE>   Jeffs knew she had to find the right children or "Rain" wouldn't
work. She saw a tape of Alicia, who had some experience as a dancer,
early in the audition process. "She was original in the way she did
her audition," Jeffs recalled. "She wasn't robotic and trying to
please. She kind of had a sense of being self-contained."</TE>
<TE>   But Jeffs almost had to abandon the project because she couldn't
find the young actor to play Jim. "The intangible quality I was
looking for was more special than boys being able to walk and talk
their lines. They needed to be very unique and original and
spontaneous." So friends of Jeffs began going to local schools and
taking photographs of boys in the classroom. Jeffs' eyes were
immediately drawn to the picture of little red-headed Aaron. She put
him in a workshop with the boys who had already been considered for
the part through the formal casting process. "He was so introverted,"
she said. Though everyone told her not to cast him, "it made me want
to see more of him. I just had to go with hunch and think he was the
right boy."</TE>
<TE>   To help her young performers' confidence, Jeffs tried as much as
possible to shoot the film in chronological order. "We did a lot of
talking," she added. "My role was to focus and explain what was
necessary and just keep them on track. I think they just got it."</TE>
<TE>   Jeffs' significant other, John Toon, was the film's associate
producer and cinematographer. The two met eight years ago on her
short film "Stroke." Toon said Jeffs' background as a film editor was
a boon in directing her first feature.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives you an uncanny knack of being able to judge what on set
works and what doesn't," Toon said. "You don't necessarily know how
to get something, but you know when something isn't working and
something is."</TE>
<TE>   Their collaboration on "Rain" was not without its stormy moments.
"There were times on 'Rain' in the first couple of weeks where I
thought we were definitely making different films," he said. "I saw a
much more beautiful film and she saw a much more austere film. There
were really beautiful scenes we shot that were sensational, but
because it didn't fit with how she saw the story, they went straight
out the door. Her film is there."</TE>

<LD>Gun violence in schools isn't your typical Saturday-morning cartoon
series topic, but as it turns out, "Static Shock," the WB animated
action series about a 14-year-old with "electromagnetic" powers,
isn't your typical Saturday-morning cartoon series.</LD>
<LD>   This younger-skewing version of the Milestone/DC Comics property
stars an African American superhero, and combines cartoon action with
substantial teen-centric stories about such issues as racism and
homelessness.</LD>
<LD>   In this week's show, airing Saturday at 7:30 a.m., superhero
action takes a back seat to a very carefully written drama about what
happens when a new kid at school, Jimmy, a misfit loner, is
relentlessly bullied.</LD>
<TE>   The worst-case scenario--a shooting--has already happened when the
show opens. Virgil Hawkins, the teen whose secret alter ego is the
supercharged Static, is working through his emotions about it with a
school psychologist.</TE>
<TE>   Virgil is coping with feelings of anger, grief (his best friend
happened to be in the line of fire when the tormented boy confronted
the bullies) and guilt (why didn't Virgil do more to stop the
bullying and why didn't he tell an adult when Jimmy talked about his
father's gun?).</TE>
<TE>   Flashbacks show how the situation escalated out of control, and
care has been taken not to glamorize or justify the shooting. The
emotional and physical consequences are given realistic weight
throughout.</TE>
<TE>   The episode--written by Alan Burnett (story) and Dwayne McDuffie
(teleplay)--ends with Static giving viewers some sobering statistics
on gun deaths and reinforcing the show's messages about the hazards
and hurtfulness of bullying and the need for young people to tell
adults when they hear peers making threats about using guns to solve
a problem.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Static Shock" can be seen Saturday at 7:30 a.m. on the WB. The
network has rated it TV-Y7-FV (may be unsuitable for children younger
than 7, with an advisory for fantasy violence).</TE>

<LD>   Princess Di Ballet Due to Premiere in Denmark</LD>
<LD>   Denmark's Peter Schaufuss Ballet has announced plans for a show
based on the life of the late Princess Diana, who died in a Paris car
wreck in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   The premiere of "Diana--the Princess" is scheduled for Sept. 14 in
the Danish city of Aarhus, 125 miles northwest of Copenhagen.
According to BBC News, British ballerina Zara Deakin will play the
role of the princess. Schaufuss is hoping to get a U.K. pop group to
provide the music for the show, which is scheduled to tour the
Scandinavian country in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Schaufuss was one of the most celebrated figures on the world
ballet scene in the 1970s and 1980s--dancing at the New York City
Ballet, the Bolshoi in Moscow and the Kirov in St. Petersburg, as
well as in London and Paris. He also was the artistic director of the
English National Ballet (of which Princess Diana was a patron), the
Berlin Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet, staging unconventional
interpretations of classics.</TE>
<TE>   The Peter Schaufuss Ballet, created in 1997, also has performed
original works inspired by the music of Elvis Presley and the
Beatles. The Princess Di ballet follows musicals and operas based on
her life in Germany and New York.</TE>

<TE>   KFI Apologizes for 'Error in Judgment'</TE>
<TE>   Talk-radio station KFI-AM (640) apologized to the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department for playing Bob Marley's "I Shot the
Sheriff" before the 6 a.m. news on Wednesday and Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   A technical assistant played a snippet of the song, prompting
station officials to inform Sheriff Lee Baca of the mistake and issue
several on-air mea culpas.</TE>
<TE>   Baca said the tune was in poor taste at a time when the department
is mourning the death of Deputy David March, who was gunned down
during a Monday-morning traffic stop in Irwindale.</TE>
<TE>   "I was outraged to learn of the inappropriate and insensitive
music selection ..." Baca said. "I have accepted their apology on
behalf of the Sheriff's Department and laud them on their efforts to
correct this error. Let us now put this incident behind us."</TE>
<TE>   KFI marketing director Bill Lewis called the incident "an error in
judgment" and "an inadvertent mistake." In all, he said, less than 10
seconds of the tune was aired.</TE>

<TE>   Haggard Halts Auction of Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   An Internet auction of a Merle Haggard cassette has been halted
after the country music star won a court order claiming the tape was
stolen from his tour bus. The object was removed from the EBay site
on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Schroeder, a concert promoter and bed-and-breakfast
operator, had offered the cassette for sale on EBay for $325,000, the
Dallas Morning News reported. Haggard's lawyers say they plan to turn
the case over to law enforcement for prosecution on theft or other
charges, but the first priority is preventing the spread of bootleg
copies.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason I am pursuing it is because this is obviously the
nightmare we all fear," Haggard told the newspaper. "I had to defend
myself. What's on the tape is a rough mix of an ongoing project. It's
like she kidnapped my children."</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder's attorney said he couldn't comment because he hadn't
seen a copy of the order.</TE>

<TE>   TLC's Lopes Laid to Rest Before Thousands</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of fans, U.S. music industry notables and relatives
gathered in suburban Atlanta Thursday to bid farewell to
Grammy-winning R&amp;B singer Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, remembered as a
creative musician who gave generously to family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   Lopes, a member of the trio TLC, died last week in Honduras when a
sport utility vehicle she was driving overturned.</TE>
<TE>   A capacity crowd of about 10,000 people filled New Birth
Missionary Baptist Church in the Atlanta suburb of Lithonia and
hundreds more waited outside during the 30-year-old singer's funeral.
A host of music industry stars attended, including producer Kenneth
"Babyface" Edmonds, and singers Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson and
Keith Sweat.</TE>

<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   'Breaking News' Finds a Home at Bravo</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a year after TNT pulled the plug on the dramatic series
"Breaking News," the Bravo network has acquired rights to the show,
with plans to begin airing it in mid-July.</TE>
<TE>   TNT completed 13 episodes of the program--which focuses on a
fictional all-news television network--at a cost of roughly $20
million before deciding last June not to televise any of the
episodes. Since then, the producers have been seeking a home for the
program.</TE>
<TE>   TNT delayed the show's premiere several times before opting to
scuttle it entirely, saying the channel's resources would be better
spent elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Breaking News" features an ensemble cast that includes Tim
Matheson, Clancy Brown, Lisa Ann Walter and Scott Bairstow.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   MTV has rescheduled its Video Music Awards out of respect for the
one-year anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The ceremony,
which usually takes place the first Thursday in September, has been
moved up to Aug. 29, when it will air live from Radio City Music Hall
in New York.... Outfest's second annual Screen Idol Awards, honoring
movie and TV performances in gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered
roles, go to "Mulholland Drive's" Naomi Watts (best actress) and
"Hedwig and the Angry Inch's" John Cameron Mitchell (best actor)....
CBS has set May 17 as the last day for Bryant Gumbel to host "The
Early Show." "Hollywood Squares" host Tom Bergeron is scheduled to
fill in for him the following week.... Kansas City Symphony music
director Anne Hanson, one of the few women to head a sizable American
orchestra, will be stepping down after June 2003 to spend more time
conducting in Europe.</TE>

<HD>A Subtle 'Night' Explores the Depths of Love</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Fleeing by Night" is an exquisite love story directed with admirable
subtlety and sensitivity by Li-kong Hsu and Chi Yin from a superb
script by Hui-ling Wang and Ming-xia Wang. It has striking
similarities to Chen Kaige's landmark "Farewell, My Concubine" but is
more intimate, even though it spans six decades.</LD>
<LD>   The setting is Tianjin in the late '30s. A wealthy businessman,
whose properties include a beautiful old theater, invites a Beijing
opera company to perform there. The troupe arrives not long before
Hsu Shao-dung (Lei Huang), the fiance of the businessman's pretty
daughter Wei Ing'er (Rene Liu), returns from America after a long
sojourn. A gifted cellist, Hsu expresses no interest in traditional
Chinese opera, but Ing'er persuades him to attend a solo performance
by the company's star, Lin Chung (Chao-te Yi), in the opera "Fleeing
by Night." Lin portrays a disillusioned warrior who was slandered at
the emperor's court and is fleeing government troops.</LD>
<LD>   Lin has a strong, impressive voice, and the despair he expresses
in wondering whether he will ever see his wife and mother again
strikes an unexpectedly deep chord in Hsu. He feels connected to his
Chinese roots, and he responds to the sound of Lin's voice as he
responds to the sound of the music of his cello.</LD>
<TE>   When Ing'er and Hsu become friendly with the diffident Lin, they
come to love him. What Hsu is slow to understand is that the love he
feels is not platonic. Both Hsu and Ing'er are also unaware of the
grimmer aspects of Lin's existence: In truth he is free only on
stage.</TE>
<TE>   All these feelings start roiling beneath a surface of the
traditional formal behavior of Chinese society. Yet Ing'er's mother
(Ah-leh Gua) worries that her daughter is seeing more of her fiance
than is proper, and Haung Zilei (Li-jen Tai), the insinuating scion
of a rich family, who scarcely bothers to disguise his lust for Lin,
is quick to grow jealous over Lin and Hsu's intense budding
friendship.</TE>
<TE>   How long will it be before this complicated situation boils over?
How long will it be before Tianjin falls to the invading Japanese,
commencing the oppression of the city's elite that will be completed
a decade later by the Communist Revolution?</TE>
<TE>   Yin shows us the vulnerability and resignation behind Lin Chung's
quietly dignified public persona, and Hsu and Ing'er emerge as
complex and caring. Hsu and Ing'er are the kind of solitary
individuals of whom people remark how sad it is that they're alone
and apparently never have met the right person. They, however,
experience isolation not as a consequence of having never loved but
rather for having loved so deeply.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout this beautiful film, which has a daringly long yet
potent epilogue, ideas and emotions reverberate. "Fleeing by Night"
is a film of extraordinary cumulative impact.</TE>

<LD>Painter Enjeong Noh has refined her work dramatically since her
already remarkable debut show two years ago. In her new still lifes,
narrative fragments and portraits at Hunsaker/Schlesinger Fine Art,
she manages to finesse a delicate balance between material revelation
and psychological concealment.</LD>
<LD>   Her images leave us wholly convinced and at the same time
wondering.</LD>
<LD>   A small self-portrait at the entrance to the show seems
straightforward, expository. The artist stands, brush in one hand, in
a three-quarter pose of serious contemplation. She wears a blue
turtleneck; a headband tames her long, dark hair. She presents a
demeanor of restraint, yet one small gesture suggests something
deeper, perhaps more rapturous within: With one hand, she lightly
embraces her own breast, cupping it tenderly, as if claiming the
sensuality that is amply evident in her painting, if not in her
external appearance.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout this soulfully beautiful show, Noh paints with
exquisite skill but never allows that formal certainty to extinguish
an essential emotional tenuousness. In two of her gem-like still
lifes, she paints just a single object--a small box, wrapped in
fabric. Like so many of the paintings themselves, these packages have
a luxurious, tactile presence, but also an intriguing elusiveness.</TE>
<TE>   In a grand, updated "Annunciation," Noh paints Mary as an ordinary
woman in bed, nude, crimson covers reaching to her waist. The
messenger is no winged angel but a little girl in white who stands,
reticently, just inside the door. Light filters into the spare,
cell-like room through a leaded-glass window, the scene's only real
hint of sacred import.</TE>
<TE>   On the bedside table--where symbolic lilies might be found in a
traditional annunciation scene--Noh rests an open sketchbook, with a
reproduction of a painting by Picasso on one page, and facing it a
drawing after Raphael. While the scene reads easily as an early
morning mother-daughter confrontation, Noh intensifies its charge by
layering it with religious and art historical references. She has
even provided a "motif bibliography," listing the writings (by Rainer
Maria Rilke, Milan Kundera and others) and particular images that she
has drawn upon in this current body of work.</TE>
<TE>   Her visual sources range widely, from a Rembrandt self-portrait
through religious paintings of the Northern European Renaissance, to
the idiosyncratic realism of Balthus and Stanley Spencer. All of the
artists from whom she has assimilated motifs are known for the
psychological intensity of their work, and Noh indeed sustains their
legacy through her compelling brand of realism.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California boasts a plethora of talented figurative
painters (as the recent museum show "Representing L.A." attested) and
Noh, who lives in Pasadena, is among the best of them. The two small
ceramic cups in her painting "Jade" resonate with familiarity--the
hand knows instantly how they would feel, cool and smooth. At the
same time, mind and heart register the emotional imbalance between
the cup filled with water and its empty partner.</TE>
<TE>   In "Wet," Noh paints a couple at rest on the floor, sexual energy
quietly pulsing through them, the drama of friction and suction
played out entirely through their soaked and clinging shirts. When,
in a corner detail of another painting, Noh paints the end of an
incense stick, tiny cylinders of ash fallen from its tip, the image
echoes a transmutation that occurs throughout her spectacular work,
as one substance evokes another, and the physical lends its form to
the metaphysical.</TE>

<TE>   The World Evolves in Vibrant Collages</TE>
<TE>   If there's any tension at all in Maritta Tapanainen's exuberant
new collages, it's a tension born of excess, not of conflict.
Abundant life and ebullient energy drive these wonderful images at
Couturier Gallery. They are built from meticulously excised bits of
scientific, botanical and mechanical illustration. Tapanainen
extracts these images from printed material she's scavenged at flea
markets and thrift shops, liberates them from their natural contexts
and contours, slices them into new shapes, and combines them in
collages. Their visual generosity is akin to that of the physical
world itself.</TE>
<TE>   In "Avaruus (Outer Space)," the largest of the works here (many
are smaller than a sheet of standard notebook paper), the artist
scatters a wealth of shapes and patterns that refer to inner as much
as outer space. Small snippets recall arteries, blood platelets,
moons, orbital paths, living things on both microcosmic and
macrocosmic scales. All adhere to a frontal plane of sorts, a
continuous field defined by the blacks and grays of the illustrated
material and the richly aged, ivory-to-gold shades of the mosaic
tiles of paper between them.</TE>
<TE>   Tapanainen treats the so-called negative space not as passive
background, but as an atmosphere dense with motion and change.
There's a democracy to her method that could stand some deviation,
but it does vividly convey a living landscape that is one continuous,
uninterruptible whole. Zero gravity rules the scene, and loops, pods,
spines, spheres, birds, spirals, ropes and tusks hover harmoniously
within, complying with some implicit law of spatial equity.</TE>
<TE>   Life looks and acts like a laboratory in these charming works.
Things are percolating, bubbling, evolving, metamorphosing. Rhythms
within and among the constituent parts are irrepressibly animate.
These are reveries, hommages to the forces and patterns, the pulses
and flows that keep life--to borrow the title of one the
collages--eternally, gloriously "Settled Unsettled."</TE>

<TE>   Hand-Formed Pots That Collaborate With Nature</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Lee's exquisite vessels at Frank Lloyd Gallery assume
fairly modest forms--softly conical bowls, slim pots with slightly
indented waists. What captures the eye, and in a startlingly profound
way, the soul, is their affinity with the organic.</TE>
<TE>   Their textures and pigmentation do not just evoke natural elements
and processes, but convey an equivalency with them. Lee's pots
conjure the essence of sand, stone, silt and sedimentation.
Breathtaking in their simplicity, they don't merely illustrate
conditions of nature but elegantly, gracefully manifest them.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, born in Scotland and living in London, forms her pots by
hand, from coils built upon a pinched base. Although they don't rely
on a potter's wheel, they do convey a sense of motion--either
circular, through swirled patterns of pigment, or tidal, their
irregular striations reminiscent of the brief traces left by waves on
beach sand, nature drawing itself.</TE>
<TE>   According to the technical notes available at the gallery, Lee
stains the clay with oxides, natural pigments, rather than applying
glazes. Color and image are wholly integrated with surface.</TE>
<TE>   One pot ("Pale pot, speckled trace") bears a single diagonal swoop
of gray-green pigment, a concentrated, calligraphic gesture
against--or rather within --its pure, eggshell surface.</TE>
<TE>   Others bear markings that recall liquid spills, attenuated clouds,
seams within stone, creeping rust and mildew, crusty films left by
evaporation. Lee swells the vessel walls in some of the pots so that
their rims thicken and show cross-sections of color, layers of
pigment. The sense of elapsed time is pronounced in these works,
which seem to embody cycles of motion and rest, like the rhythm of
the tide surging forward and pulling back. Lee's creations touch the
spirit because ultimately they are collaborations--with earth,
gravity, time and motion.</TE>

<TE>   Meditations on Moral Failings</TE>
<TE>   This year's Whitney Biennial has been dismissed as bleak, pious
and naive by the New York Times, banal, dreary and thin by this
paper. It's hard to imagine that Yun-Fei Ji, one of the 113 artists
included in the exhibition, doesn't offer at least one redeeming
moment, based on his small but engaging show at Post.</TE>
<TE>   Ji's paintings cross the freakish moralizing of Hieronymous Bosch
with the literary atmospherics of traditional Chinese landscape
painting, and filter them both through a 21st century sensibility
honed by natural disasters, warfare and violation of the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Only two paintings hang here (additional studies are available for
viewing), but their dense imagery sustains attention equal to a much
larger show. Both paintings, in ink and mineral pigments on mulberry
paper, read immediately as older than they are. Smoky gray and blue
washes stain the paper, which appears abraded with age. The linear
articulation of figures, craggy rocks, trees and waterfalls
subscribes to a classical Chinese idiom.</TE>
<TE>   As if seen from an elevated viewpoint, the landscapes consume the
entire vertical span of the paper, forgoing a horizon to allow for
more narrative action to unfold among the multiple, continuous zones
of the composition. In "Three Gorges Project," clouds billow and
waves ripple as if a final reckoning were taking place.</TE>
<TE>   Scale has lost its familiar logic. Flies outsize cars. Cicadas and
wasps and several creepy, hybrid, Bosch-like creatures with scissor
beaks and leonine jowls posture in vaguely threatening ways. An
apocalyptic wind has unhinged this world, loosing trucks and tanks
and houses through the air.</TE>
<TE>   "The Boxer, the Missionary and Their Gods" follows much the same
format but presents a more complex narrative, ripe with the odd and
grotesque.</TE>
<TE>   The cast here includes goddesses and demons, decapitated bodies
and a multi-headed tree. Creatures of land, sea and air, mortal and
mythic, all exercise their power--or suffer their powerlessness--on
this fantastic, time-warped stage.</TE>
<TE>   Something has gone cosmically wrong here, yet the New York-based
Ji has given us an opportunity to savor and reflect. His work, as he
says, "is a meditation on the land as the image of our own moral
failure."</TE>

<HD>Storm Brews Beneath Idyllic Surface in Stunning 'Rain'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Rain" is a sensual, moody coming-of-age drama of wide implications
and stunning impact that marks an important feature debut for New
Zealand writer-director Christine Jeffs. In bringing to the screen
Kirsty Gunn's highly acclaimed 1994 novel, Jeffs has created a
breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute
expressiveness. Jeffs has that paradoxical gift of maintaining
complete and crucial control of every aspect of her film while
allowing it to seem spontaneous. No wonder Jeffs, one of New
Zealand's top directors of commercials, has made Variety's "Ten
Directors to Watch" list.</LD>
<LD>   Right on the beach of what looks to be paradise on Earth, a couple
with two children have rented a comfortable vacation cottage in the
summer of 1972. Kate (Sarah Peirse) has the mature beauty of a Greek
goddess, and her husband, Ed (Alistair Browning), is a
pleasant-looking fellow. Their 13-year-old daughter Janey (Alicia
Fulford-Wierzbicki), who has her mother's dark hair, is blossoming
into a knockout. Janey's kid brother, Jim (Aaron Murphy), a redhead
like his dad, is about 8.</LD>
<TE>   It's swiftly clear, however, that Kate and Ed's marriage is in
trouble. Kate, whose natural looks and easy poise convey a sultry
allure, continually rebuffs her sweet-natured husband's displays of
affection. She increasingly drowns her sexual hunger in drink, just
as her husband does the same with his feelings of rejection. They
have chosen the worst place possible to rekindle their love, although
Kate is moving past caring. That's because there's nothing much to
do, and there are drunken parties with neighbors every night.</TE>
<TE>   Kate and Ed are, however, loving parents. An affectionate, caring
man, Ed makes an effort to spend time with the children and to take
them along when he goes fishing. Just as Kate tries to reach out to
Janey, a stranger emerges on the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   Having anchored his cabin cruiser nearby, Cady (Marton Csokas), a
noted photographer, has struck up an acquaintance with the family.
His strong sexual appeal has not been lost on either a mother craving
passion or a daughter who is just beginning to discover her own
allure.</TE>
<TE>   Beneath a surface as calm as the sea in front of the cottage,
tension begins to build, but "Rain" moves way past the predictable
into the shocking. Indeed, the film is so expertly structured and
paced that its denouement knocks you off your feet. So intense is it
that it seems downright punitive on the part of Gunn and Jeffs, yet
it is undeniably organic to the plot and grows out of the psychology
of the well-defined, flawlessly played characters. Even little Murphy
gives as nuanced a portrayal as the others and may well prove to be
the big discovery among the cast.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: strong sensuality, some nudity, heavy
drinking, adult themes, extremely intense.</TE>

<KH>Movie Review</KH>
<HD>Gee, Officer Krupke, Can't You Intervene?</HD>
<DH>Oops, wrong movie. The formulaic 'Deuces Wild' may be set
in the world of 1950s New York street gangs, but it's no 'West Side
Story.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE SEYMOUR</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who knows? Maybe being in a street gang in late-1950s New York really
was like being trapped in a bad movie. All that jazz about defending
turf, avenging real and imagined slights, and adopting a thugs' code
of honor could have been sculpted from cheese recycled from B
westerns, battle epics and swashbucklers playing at the corner movie
house.</LD>
<LD>   Given such dime-store sensibilities to work with, it's somewhat
surprising that some very good films have been made about 1950s New
York street gangs, notably "West Side Story" (1961), "The Lords of
Flatbush" (1974), and your correspondent's favorite, "The Wanderers"
(1979). With gems like these as inspiration, it's both inexplicable
and inexcusable that a boneheaded operation like "Deuces Wild" could
have been allowed to exist.</LD>
<LD>   Let's guess why. Someone probably figured that now would be a good
time to return to those thrilling days of yesteryear, replacing the
misty haze of lyricism and nostalgia with a blunt-edged hyperrealism.
Which sort of makes sense when you consider that the target audience
for blood-and-guts movies these days is way too young to get the warm
fuzzies from listening to doo-wop and remembering when Duke Snider
played for the Dodgers.</LD>
<TE>   Director Scott Kalvert ("The Basketball Diaries"), working with a
script drawn from the boyhood memories of co-writer and co-producer
Paul Kimatian, wields this down-and-dirty impulse like one of the
lead pipes used in the gang fights. Those fight scenes, by the way,
are orchestrated with a mix of operatic brutality and high-tech
razzle-dazzle that would appear to mitigate any claims to realism.
(Still, the fights are staged better than scenes requiring personal
interaction.)</TE>
<TE>   In no other way is "Deuces Wild" a groundbreaker, except in the
manner in which it grinds the old formula trappings into asbestos.
There's the kindly neighborhood priest urging his volatile young
flock to play nice. (Once you get over the giddy shock of seeing
Vincent Pastore from "The Sopranos" with a priest's collar as Father
Aldo, you notice the role isn't a bad fit.) There are the grandly
dysfunctional neighborhood moms, wailing and moaning while their kids
break things over each other's heads. There's even forbidden romance
between a member of one gang and a sister of a rival gang member.</TE>
<TE>   The smoldering core of this messiness is Leon (Stephen Dorff),
who, if this were set in 1998 instead of 1958, would be called a
multi-tasker. He's the leader of the Deuces, a teen gang patrolling a
stretch of Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood with the tacit
approval of local mobster Fritzy (Matt Dillon). His short-fused
brother, Bobby (Brad Renfro, once again showing why he's so perfect
at playing knuckleheads), makes goo-goo eyes at Annie (Fairuza Balk),
who is sister to a member of the rival Vipers gang. The head Viper is
a drug-dealing angel of death named--can't you guess?--Marco (Norman
Reedus), who wants Leon dead. And Leon wants Marco dead because ...</TE>
<TE>   Skip it. Just fill in the blanks and you too can brew the same
bland, goopy mixture, right down to such clunker lines as "There is a
Santa Claus, Ma. He just doesn't come to Brooklyn anymore." Or, I
guess, to the multiplexes.</TE>

<HD>New Geffen Season Opens With 'Blue Sky'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four West Coast premieres, including a new play by the Tony
Award-winning book writer of the musical "James Joyce's The Dead,"
will be part of the Geffen Playhouse's 2002-03 season.</LD>
<LD>   Opening the season will be David Eldridge's "Under the Blue Sky,"
Sept. 18-Oct. 20. Set in Britain, where it was produced at the Royal
Court Theatre, it consists of three interconnecting plays about the
after-hours affairs of three pairs of teachers. The U.S. premiere is
slated for June in Williamstown, Mass. The Geffen production will be
staged by the theater's producing director, Gilbert Cates. His last
directorial effort at the Geffen was 1999's "Collected Stories,"
starring Linda Lavin and Samantha Mathis.</LD>
<LD>   Choreographer Debbie Allen conceived and will direct "Pearl" (Nov.
20-Dec. 22), a contemporary adaptation of "Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs," with music by Allen, two-time Grammy winner James Ingram and
Diane Louie. Allen directed an earlier version of "Pearl" at the

<HD>Heartfelt 'Shot at Glory' Misses a Strong Kick</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"A Shot at Glory" is a standard sports story given an endearing
Scottish accent, a vital star turn by Robert Duvall and an
unexpectedly strong finish. But as good-natured as the film is, it is
likely to be involving only for dedicated sports fans.</LD>
<LD>   Duvall's Gordon McLeod is the stalwart manager of the
football--i.e., soccer--team in the picturesque seaside village of
Kilnockie. The team, the Knockies, hasn't won a title in more than a
century, but the locals cherish its players, who enjoy the game, win
or lose.</LD>
<LD>   But now the Knockies have a new owner, an American, Peter Cameron
(Michael Keaton, in a virtual guest appearance), who declares that if
the team can't win the Scottish Cup he'll move it to Ireland. To
bolster the Knockies' chances of an incredibly longshot win, Cameron
has gone ahead and hired a former star, Jackie McQuillan (Ally
McCoist, a real-life soccer star).</LD>
<TE>   Jackie has been one of the greats, but he's also a hard-drinking
womanizer who not only has threatened his career but also eroded his
marriage to none other than McLeod's lovely daughter Kate (Kirsty
Mitchell). McLeod manfully accepts this turn of events, but even if
Jackie takes the opportunity to redeem himself on the field and
bolster his marriage, Gordon, who has a decidedly stubborn streak,
may still find himself unable to resume speaking to his daughter for
having married Jackie in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Though Denis O'Neill's script is not especially involving for
non-sports fans, it is surprisingly mature for the genre and has been
directed by Michael Corrente with the same warmth and intimacy he
brought to the admirable "Federal Hill" and "Outside Providence."
Duvall has plenty of opportunities to draw upon his mastery of the
tight smile of a proud man under duress, and McCoist is as much a
natural on the screen as he has been on a soccer field. Brian Cox is
the tough manager of the Glasgow Rangers, the country's top team,
which the Knockies must face in a David-versus-Goliath match.</TE>
<TE>   The film's strongest presence, and refreshingly so, is Mitchell's
Kate, who is strong and wise enough to deal with her father and her
husband. "A Shot at Glory" is not as distinctive or even as humorous
as its needs to be to stand out, but it has clearly been made with
affection and care.</TE>

<HD>Faith and Violence Collide in Timely Mystery 'Exmagare'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daryl H. Miller,  David C. Nichols, F. Kathleen Foley</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a California mission in the late 1800s, a padre kneels in
early-morning prayer when shots ring out and a frightened young man
and woman rush onto the grounds. In these gripping first moments of
his new play "Exmagare," Joe Camareno begins to lay out a mystery
that combines a bitter chapter in state history with Catholic Church
belief in a Holy Mother who watches over her children.</LD>
<LD>   A dispute over landownership becomes central to the story, as does
a series of abuses, including one that violates the church's sacred
trust. These themes resonate with current events in much the way that
the Eclectic Company's last show, "Victor," did when its Frankenstein
story dovetailed with new concerns about cloning.</LD>
<LD>   Director Paul Millet and designers Jeff G. Rack (set), John J.
Grant (lighting) and Mary Reilly (costumes) render "Exmagare" in the
dark, burnished glow of an old religious painting.</LD>
<TE>   It's just the right atmosphere for the eerie yet wondrous events
that begin to occur once young Padre Alejo (Armando Valdes-Kennedy)
gives shelter to Diego (Peter Pasco) and Anita (Tonantzin Carmelo).
The teenage brother and sister have been chased from family land by
the mean-tempered settler (Frank Elmore) who has appropriated it.
Anita has sustained gunshot wounds and is about to give birth.</TE>
<TE>   Standing guard at the 15-year-old's bedside is a specter arrayed
in the Virgin Mother's white veil (Sandra Cevallos). Anita--the only
one who can see her, at first--refers to her as "Our Mother." Is she
a bringer of peace? Or retribution?</TE>
<TE>   The symbolism might prove a bit much for some tastes, and the bad
guys--the rancher and the doubting Father Egon (Eugene Boles)--are
written with too little dimension. Still, Camareno, who wrote the
less successful "Delia's Song," presented at the Eclectic in 2000,
proves to be a vivid and thoughtful writer with this story, as he
plumbs the mysteries of faith while exposing the violence that
baptized California in blood.</TE>

<TE>   Irreverent 'Bible' Sputters With Inconsistency</TE>
<TE>   The worlds of vacation Bible school and "Whose Line Is It Anyway?"
collide in "The Bible: The Complete Word of God (Abg'd)," an Ark
Theatre Company presentation. Authors Adam Long, Reed Martin and
Austin Tichenor follow up their hit "The Cmplt Wrks of Wllm Shkspr"
with a deconstruction of the world's best-selling book.</TE>
<TE>   Performers Roxanne Meyers, Steven Shields and Richard Tatum open
with a direct-address prologue resembling a sitcom pre-taping warmup.
This sets the tone for the freewheeling blend of sketch comedy and
collegiate revue that follows, one Testament per act.</TE>
<TE>   The actors, all possessing high-voltage comedic energy, are the
motor here. Meyers is an agile physical clown; Tatum displays an
imposing range of character voices; and director Shields' outsized
responses are hilarious, particularly the payoff to a running gag
about Noah's Ark.</TE>
<TE>   The scattershot text contains some keenly irreverent notions
(notably song lyrics recalling Tom Lehrer), and as many groaners as
knee-slappers. Similar inconsistency marks Shields' staging, whose
living room pageant charm is undercut by erratic tempo and point. And
the Don Rickles-style attitude toward viewer response (or lack
thereof), in tandem with an arbitrary audience participation segment,
creates an occasionally off-putting atmosphere. Such unevenness
suggests this promising work-in-progress might benefit from an
outside eye and judicious rewriting.</TE>

<TE>   Problems Run Deep in Swollen 'Red River'</TE>
<TE>   Too many cooks can spoil the broth. Conversely, too few can
thicken it to tastelessness.</TE>
<TE>   Take the case of Sally Wills, creator of the glutinous "Red River"
at the American Renegade Theatre. "Red River" revolves around the
trials and tribulations of Bobbie Jean (Keira O'Keiff), a
disenchanted Texas blueblood whose politician husband, Doug (David
Schulz), is on the fast track to the governor's mansion.</TE>
<TE>   Fed up with her hubby's philandering, this time with his sultry
campaign manager (Heather Schulz), Bobbie Jean moves to the mountains
of New Mexico with her best friend Ethel (Kayrin J.B. Nichole) in
tow. Bobbie Jean purchases a rural roadhouse, only to learn that it
rests on disputed Indian territory (a wacky story point that
resurfaces at a later juncture). A rousing success in her new
business, Bobbie Jean also finds true love in Native American
mountain man Eagle (Mark Luna). But an ugly custody battle with the
dirty-dealing Doug threatens her happiness.</TE>
<TE>   As sole writer and director, Wills gets points for the sheer
audacity of her undertaking, which features a large cast, complicated
scene changes, live music, full-blown dance sequences (courtesy of
choreographer Qyn Hughes) and 20 musical numbers. But Wills could
have used an objective observer to help channel this circuitous
"River," which overflows with cliches and dramatic dead ends.</TE>
<TE>   Stereotypes abound. Particularly problematic is the combination of
Bobbie Jean's one-note niceness and Eagle's affectless sagacity.
Alarmingly impassive, Eagle (who, by the way, lives in a tree)
exhorts Bobbie Jean to "Feel the oneness" and "Live in the moment,"
while Bobbie Jean marvels at Eagle's mystical connection with nature,
his "wisdom and inner peace."</TE>
<TE>   Fine sentiments, if you're at a holistic health fair, but where's
the romantic sizzle? Wills contributes some engaging tunes, but the
plot is hopelessly atonal. Act 1 (which, by the way, lasts two hours)
culminates in a trumped-up "crisis" that does little to further the
story--just one example of the piece's many structural weaknesses. A
few professional flourishes, most notably Nichole's glorious voice
and Hughes' lively dancing, are welcome respites in this overlong and
uneven evening.</TE>

<TE>   Expanded 'Bergeron' Falls Short of Its Potential</TE>
<TE>   In a world that values conformity, Harrison Bergeron sticks out.
He's a smart young man, attuned to beauty and human
potential--qualities that society can't knock out of him, no matter
how hard it tries.</TE>
<TE>   The hero of a Kurt Vonnegut Jr. short story, Harrison stands as a
champion for those who feel that America is degenerating into
mindless sameness. He is, in short, a wonderful subject for a play.</TE>
<TE>   So it's unfortunate that the version of his story told at the
Lillian Theatre in Hollywood doesn't live up to its potential.
Vonnegut's "Harrison Bergeron," published in 1961 and later included
in the collection "Welcome to the Monkey House," has been adapted and
self-produced by Stan Daniels, a writer-producer for the final three
seasons of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and co-creator of the comedy
series "Taxi." In the 1990s, Daniels wrote three episodes of the
Showtime cable television series "Kurt Vonnegut's Monkey House." He
also wrote the teleplay for the Showtime movie "Harrison Bergeron,"
although after becoming dissatisfied with the project, he asked to
have his credit changed to a pseudonym.</TE>
<TE>   His stage adaptation imaginatively expands Vonnegut's brief tale
about an upside-down United States several decades into the future,
when the government has pushed the idea of equality to a warped
extreme. Daniels finds humor as well as horror in a society where
citizens must wear headbands that interrupt higher intellectual
functions and where all stimulating thought is weeded out of
television programming.</TE>
<TE>   Still, problems arise because Daniels has structured his play just
like a teleplay, with action unfolding in 54 short scenes, some
barely a minute long. A more imaginative director might have found a
way to make these segments flow without interruption. But Daniels,
serving as his own director, merely dims the lights while, for
several long moments, the actors move into new positions. The result
is 21/2 hours of action that jerks forward and stops, like a car
driven by someone just learning how to use a stick shift.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Randy Kravis' Harrison wins over the audience with
earnestness and heart, and in video clips meant to represent
videophone technology in 2060, Ed Asner makes a humorous cameo as a
bellowing, foul-tempered president of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad, but with all its smarts, "Harrison Bergeron" is capable
of better.</TE>
<TE>   D.H.M.</TE>
<TE>   "Harrison Bergeron," Lillian Theatre, 1076 N. Lillian Way,
Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 5 p.m. Ends May 26.
$17.50-$20. (323) 655-TKTS. Running time, 2 hours, 35 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   'Daisy's' Lesson Rekindled by Riots' Anniversary</TE>
<TE>   Alfred Uhry's "Driving Miss Daisy" has always possessed a quiet
power. As it charts the delicate blossoming of friendship between a
Southern Jewish matron and her black chauffeur, it provides a
hope-filled example of people seeing beyond their differences and
embracing one another.</TE>
<TE>   That message resonates all the more powerfully right now, as Los
Angeles looks back on the civil unrest--much of it exploding out of
racial and economic tensions--that occurred here 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Civic Light Opera of South Bay Cities offers this chance for
reflection in a beautiful staging of Uhry's 1988 Pulitzer Prize
winner at the Hermosa Beach Playhouse, directed by Michael Michetti
and performed by Marcia Rodd, Lance E. Nichols and Time Winters.</TE>
<TE>   Slow and easy is the motto here, as Michetti lets the action
unfold gradually and naturally. (Indeed, he manages to sustain this
flow even though the producers insisted on inserting a break into
Uhry's intermission-less structure.) As the story progresses from
1948 to 1973, emotions steep and bodies slowly stoop.</TE>
<TE>   Rodd is astringent and imperious as Miss Daisy, at 72, at first
resists being chauffeured by Hoke (Nichols), who's been hired by her
son, Boolie (Winters), after she totaled her Packard without leaving
her driveway. Nichols' Hoke is patient, calm and forever
good-natured--a solid rock who will wear down the angry river, not
the other way around.</TE>
<TE>   But beneath the feel-good sentiment is a sharp observation about
human nature. Miss Daisy and Hoke pride themselves on
open-mindedness, yet ingrained prejudices occasionally rush to the
surface. The 1992 L.A. riots taught much the same lesson. As
commentators have pointed out it recent days, it was partly because
the city blithely thought it had moved beyond racism that the
explosion of frustration took it so much by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   D.H.M.</TE>
<TE>   "Driving Miss Daisy," Hermosa Beach Playhouse, Pier Avenue at
Pacific Coast Highway, Hermosa Beach. Today-Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday,

<HD>Can't Get Enough of Spidey? Try These</HD>
<DH>Releases include animation from TV series over the years,
interactive material and an interview with co-creator Stan Lee.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three home entertainment companies are jumping on the web in hopes of
cashing in on the enormous interest and hype surrounding Sam Raimi's
big-screen version of "Spider-Man," opening in theaters today.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Buena Vista released on DVD ($20) and VHS ($15) the
very entertaining "Spider-Man: The Ultimate Villain Showdown," which
features four animated adventures from the 1995 series starring
everyone's favorite wall-crawling superhero. Spidey goes mano a mano
with his super nemeses the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and the
Kingpin in these enjoyable, fast-paced cartoons. Also featured on the
disc is an episode of the 1967 Saturday-morning cartoon version of
"Spider-Man," titled "The Origins of Spider-Man." The animation on
the vintage adventure isn't on par with the new version, but it's
campy fun and features the catchy, albeit somewhat annoying, theme
song, "Spider-Man, Spider-Man."</LD>
<TE>   The real star of the DVD, though, is the 79-year-old Stan Lee,
former publisher of Marvel Comics and co-creator of Spidey and
numerous other superheroes like the Hulk and the Fantastic Four. In a
series of interviews, the colorful and gregarious Lee talks about the
origins of Spider-Man, his desire to imbue Spidey's alter ego, Peter
Parker, with realism, and the success of the series. There's also a
fun, interactive "Villain's Gallery," which features extensive data
on each of the superhero's foes, Lee's comments on the bad guys, and
clips of the villains in action.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving May 7 on video ($10) and DVD ($15) from Anchor Bay
Entertainment is the rather cheesy "How to Draw Comics the Marvel
Way." Originally released on video in the late '80s, this how-to
program is based on the best-selling book by Lee and comic book
artist John Buscema. For an hour, the two talk about "simple"
techniques to draw comic book characters. Buscema seems uncomfortable
in front of the camera, but Lee, in his dark glasses and polyester
outfit, is all personality as he discusses such topics as shapes, the
power of perspective, figure drawing, composition and design.</TE>
<TE>   Lee is also front and center in Columbia TriStar's VHS ($20) and
DVD ($25) entry in the "Spider-Man" canon, "Stan Lee's Mutants,
Monsters &amp; Marvels," scheduled for release May 14. Lee and Kevin
Smith, director of such films as "Clerks" and "Chasing Amy" and a
comic book fanatic, have a lengthy chat at a comic book store in
Santa Monica. Smith, who has written comics and even owns a comic
book store in New Jersey, is clearly in awe of Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Their conversation is divided into two parts: "Creating
Spider-Man" and "Here Come the Heroes."</TE>
<TE>   In "Spider-Man," Lee talks about the origins of the superhero,
though his story is a bit different than in the Buena Vista release.
He also talks about the controversy over the credit of "Spider-Man."
Lee believes that since he came up with the idea, he should be the
sole creator. However, original artist Steve Ditko believes he should
be considered co-creator since he brought Lee's vision to life.</TE>
<TE>   In the second program, Lee talks about his history and his 60-plus
years in the comic book business.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD also includes cast and crew biographies, a very short
behind-the-scenes featurette, an interview with Lee's wife of 54
years, Joan, home movies from Lee's personal collection and Lee's
original poem, "God Woke."</TE>

<DH>The California EAR Unit investigates the sounds machines
make in a loud, fresh program.</DH>

<LD>May Day is noise day. Demonstrators take to the streets; revelers
too. Wednesday night, leaving downtown for midtown, one could hear
the sounds of 10,000 marchers on Spring Street demanding rights for
illegal immigrants; listen to a radio report about a million in Paris
protesting Le Pen; and then, facing blaring boring music from a
private fund-raising party, attempt to walk up the steps of the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art, past guards stationed to divert
concertgoers. Ironically, all we were after was more, if fresher and
artful, noise in the Leo S. Bing Theater.</LD>
<LD>   The concert was the blowout of the California EAR Unit's 20th
anniversary season, but it was called "Brown Out." On this evening,
noise, along with a hint of political protest, was this ever-mutable
ensemble's metier. The six superb players of conventional instruments
variably confronted, collided with, marched in lock step with and
outwitted the electronic ether, with the secret sounds your computer
makes, with the sounds of sophisticated Space Age gear, with the
amplified ritual of the world around us. A lot of it was loud; some
of it was interesting; much of it was new.</LD>
<TE>   The most ambitious piece was a premiere by Laetitia Sonami, an
Oakland-based composer who has been picking up prestigious prizes
lately (she just won this year's Herb Alpert Award in Music). "A
Blind Ride" modifies sounds apparently hidden in electronic documents
and spreadsheets, over which the musicians improvise. Variously
placed lightbulbs illuminate the stage in brief bursts.</TE>
<TE>   Who knows quite what she was up to on the darkened stage--framed
by four glowing blue dots of lights from the loudspeakers--with her
homemade "lady's glove," full of embedded sensors that let her
control sound and the lightbulbs. Still, Sonami's electronic,
computer-document-derived noises revealed a fascinating papery
texture that was not just satisfyingly visceral, but, at least to one
writer not always happily glued to his machine, downright comforting.
The ensemble played mostly floating fragments that made a beautiful
fit with the rustling, swirling electronics.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Francis Chase, a recent CalArts graduate, picked up his
electronic ideas from scratch DJs in "OPUS," in which the composer
manned two turntables. Breaking up his new piece into turntable duets
with piano and percussion, trios with winds and strings, and a fifth
section for all the players, Chase has a fine ear for combinations of
sounds. Flamboyant music for pianist Vicky Ray made intriguing
counterpoint with a hand-modulated piano recording (Brahms'
"Paganini" Variations?).</TE>
<TE>   Chase amusingly challenged violin and cello with a stuck record,
sent bass flute and bass clarinet into scat song with amplified
scratches, and created a percussion extravaganza for Amy Knoles. Not
exactly fleet-fingered, however, Chase broke the piece's momentum
with long pauses as he gingerly changed records and adjusted his
score between each section, making the finale an anticlimax.</TE>
<TE>   Three other pieces pitted solo instruments against the machine. In
Anna Rubin's "Landmine," written last year and receiving its Los
Angeles premiere, Dorothy Stone's live flute, often electronically
thickened, added moody atmosphere to a pre-recorded, digitally
dithered text about the land mine crisis in Cambodia.</TE>
<TE>   Clarinetist Marty Walker gave the premiere of a new version of
Barney Childs' "The Edge of the World." Originally for live organ
accompaniment, Walker has adapted the 1981 piece--written for him by
Childs, who died in 2000--with an electronically realized organ part,
making it seem all the more a haunted landscape as the bass clarinet
improvises over insistent, sonically exaggerated diapason chords.</TE>
<TE>   Although receiving a local premiere, Eric Chasalow's "Hanging in
the Balance" for cello and electronic sounds was the oldie of the
evening, not so much because it was written in 1983, but because the
electronics had the flavor of the back-to-the-future Space Age bleeps
and bloops of the '50s and '60s. Still, Erika Duke-Kirkpatrick's
exciting performance (from memory), and the piece's brief duration
made it hang on, if just, in the present.</TE>
<TE>   For Mark Trayle's premiere, "Periodic transmission at regular
intervals (are not allowed)," crabbed phrases played by violin (Robin
Lorentz), cello, flute and percussion were tracked by a chirping
computer. Typical of these machines, when given leeway, they want all
the attention for themselves whether they have anything to say or
not.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously in the early stages of evolution, geek musique needs all
the help it can get from real musicians. In the case of the EAR Unit,
it is actually getting it. I just hope the machines are paying
attention as well.</TE>

<LD>Bad day at the office? Try this: Show up for work late. When you do
arrive, help half a dozen of your friends hold the place hostage.
Then reveal to the boss and the rest of the world that you're a
genetically engineered, bar-coded escapee from a secret Wisconsin
laboratory.</LD>
<LD>   Not exactly the way to earn a raise, but when you're Max, the
babe-on-a-bike anti-heroine of the Fox sci-fi series "Dark Angel,"
there are bigger things at stake than holding down a job at the Jam
Pony X-Press courier service. Primary among them: leading her "freak"
brethren in the fight for equality in post-apocalyptic Seattle, circa
2019.</LD>
<LD>   So begins the 90-minute second-season finale, airing tonight at
8:30. It pulls no punches in life-altering revelations for its
characters or in action sequences reminiscent of films such as "The
Terminator." No surprise then that the director of that movie, James
Cameron, co-created and executive-produces this series and tonight
makes his TV directing debut. (It's also his first directorial
project to be seen since the 1997 film "Titanic.")</LD>
<TE>   In terms of sheer action, this episode of "Dark Angel" kicks as
much behind as Jessica Alba's Max does. The violence climaxes in a
nearly six-minute battle pitting her and her allies against an elite
squad sent in by Agent White (Martin Cummins) to kill Max and "take
out anything with a pulse." Gunfire crackles; combatants hurtle
through glass; fists and chairs fly in kung fu and "WWF Smackdown!"
style. Indeed, Amy "Lita" Dumas of the World Wrestling Federation is
a guest star.</TE>
<TE>   The message underlying the melee is tolerance for one's fellow
beings, no matter how different they may be. Like in most science
fiction, the words of hate expressed by humans for the "mutants" or
"transgenics" in this futuristic setting echo those used by today's
racists and zealots.</TE>
<TE>   As for the plot and the dialogue being particularly original: Did
we mention how great the action and Alba look?</TE>

<HD>The Spider and the Fly Girl</HD>
<DH>'Spider-Man' has a surprising and satisfying romance angle,
and yet the film still manages to be a solidly crafted comic-book
adventure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Spider-Man" may look like an action comic come to life, but its best
feature is its romance comic heart. It's that rare cartoon movie in
which the villain is less involving than the love story.</LD>
<LD>   Like any celebrity biography, "Spider-Man" is more interesting
when its subject is struggling than after he succeeds--and of
Spider-Man's renown there can be no doubt. Uncommonly popular since
his comic-book creation by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko some 40 years
ago, Spidey was conceived as a new kind of hero, very much a teenager
with age-specific uncertainties and anxieties that having unusual
powers did nothing to ease. But let Peter Parker, Spider-Man's alter
ego, tell you himself in the voice-over that starts the film:</LD>
<LD>   "Who am I? You sure you wanna know? The story of my life is not
for the faint of heart. If somebody said it was a happy little tale,
if somebody told you I was just your average, ordinary guy, not a
care in the world ... somebody lied."</LD>
<TE>   Director Sam Raimi, a long-time "Spider-Man" fan, was once known
for mainlining the kind of murky midnight sensibility that Tim Burton
brought to the "Batman" films. Though he's used Burton's composer
Danny Elfman, Raimi's tone here is distinctly sunny. And though his
"Spider-Man" marks time more than it needs to and is no more than
sporadically exhilarating, it does enough things right to be a solid
comic-book citizen.</TE>
<TE>   The key thing Raimi did right was insist on Tobey Maguire ("Wonder
Boys," "The Cider House Rules") for the title character. Though he
convincingly trained and bulked up for the role, Maguire will never
be the traditional hunk that studios prefer in these kinds of parts.
But the appropriateness of his creaky-voiced sincerity, the very
ordinariness of his offbeat charisma, turns him into the most
convincing of Spider-Men.</TE>
<TE>   Before there was a Spider-Man, there was Peter Parker, a senior at
Midtown High School in Queens, N.Y., who's so nerdy even the school
bus driver wants nothing to do with him. An orphan who lives with his
Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), Peter has
pined for the lovely girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (a red-headed
Kirsten Dunst) ever since he was 6. A lot of good that's done him.</TE>
<TE>   Peter has only one friend and fellow outcast, Harry Osborn (James
Franco of TV's "James Dean"), the son of the fabulously wealthy
Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), a man whose expertise in nanotechnology
has made his company, Oscorp, a key supplier of advanced weapons to
the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   One fateful day, Peter accompanies his class on a field trip to
the science departments of Columbia University. As photographer for
the school paper, Peter is concentrating on a shot of Mary Jane when
a rare, genetically designed super-spider takes a healthy bite out of
him.</TE>
<TE>   By the next morning, Peter is a different person. His body is
buff, he doesn't need his glasses, and he has reflexes ordinary
humans can't even imagine. Uncle Ben thinks it's just raging
hormones, but we know better. We know that Spider-Man has been born.</TE>
<TE>   If these intentionally dopey interactions with Aunt May and Uncle
Ben are the film's weakest links, its strengths are the sequences in
which Peter discovers and then shakily/gleefully tries out his spider
powers. Scenes of him climbing walls, slinging webs and then
gradually, through awkward trial and error, learning how to use them
are cleverly worked out and great fun to experience. It's also
enjoyable to watch how the film, through a combination of acrobatic
stand-ins and computer-generated imagery, enables Spider-Man to
hurtle and swoop through the concrete caverns of Manhattan as if he
were Tarzan on the most elastic of jungle vines.</TE>
<TE>   What "Spider-Man" hasn't been able to manage is a creditable
villain. Green Goblin, the bad guy, is in reality that fabulously
wealthy scientist Norman Osborn, who tested performance-enhancement
drugs on himself and found out--too late!--that the potential risks
of violent behavior and insanity were all too real.</TE>
<TE>   Screenwriter David Koepp, who does a creditable job laying out
Spidey's origins, has less to offer once our hero accepts that "with
great power comes great responsibility" and starts to fight crime.
Green Goblin is a completely generic evil-doer, and the uninventive
battles with him are not helped by dialogue like "Goblin, what have
you done!"</TE>
<TE>   What we do root for in "Spider-Man" is the romance between Mary
Jane and Peter. Dunst and Maguire make a real connection on screen,
and we are involved in their relationship to an extent that's rare in
films like this.</TE>
<TE>   Paradoxically, this makes Parker's Clark Kent-ish unwillingness to
tell MJ his secret identity less palatable than it would otherwise
be. But with a sequel already in the works, mere human desires aren't
allowed to get in the way of the almighty dollar.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for stylized violence and action. Times
guidelines: a few intense dreamlike sequences but otherwise fairly
mild.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Plans to Restate Results After Review of Its
Accounting</HD>
<DH>Cable: Earnings for last three years may reflect loans to
partnerships. The company could default on certain debt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cable operator Adelphia Communications Corp. said it expects to
restate its last three years of financial results and may default on
some of its debt because of an internal accounting review.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia, the nation's sixth-biggest cable firm, said that it
could add $1.6 billion in debt to the company's balance sheet and
that its delay in filing an annual report for 2001 may make it
default on certain debt. The firm is the subject of a Securities and
Exchange Commission probe and could have its shares delisted from
Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia shares fell 94 cents, or 14%, to close at $6.01. The
stock has plunged about 70% since officials disclosed in March that
the company had guaranteed $2.3 billion in loans to off-balance-sheet
partnerships owned by the Rigas family, Adelphia's founders.</LD>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether
Adelphia properly disclosed the off-balance-sheet practices. More
than 10 class-action shareholder suits have been filed against the
Rigas family and Adelphia, based in Coudersport, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   The restated financial results may place it in violation of
existing credit arrangements, analysts said. As a result, Adelphia
could have trouble raising additional cash.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia probably failed to convince its auditors, Deloitte &amp;
Touche, that debt to the Rigas family partnerships should remain
separate from the company's results, an investor said.</TE>
<TE>   "The auditors are afraid they'll get sued and made these guys
restate their earnings" to reflect the loans on the balance sheet,
said Kevin Loome, an analyst at T. Rowe Price. "You know who was
holding all the cards: It was the auditors, not Adelphia."</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia said it had obtained a waiver to prevent default "until
at least May 16" on one credit agreement relating to its UCA unit.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia may have avoided adding the full $2.3 billion in loans to
its books because it plans to recognize $700 million as a receivable
from the Rigas family, one analyst said. The $1.6-billion balance is
being written off because Adelphia believes that amount will not be
repaid, said Lehman Bros. analyst Robert Willens.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia also may sell up to half its cable systems, worth as much
as $8 billion, to pay down debts, according to people close to the
company. The Rigas family has agreed to put up for sale cable
operations, including the Los Angeles cable system it acquired two
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia also owns cable systems in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio
and Florida and serves a total of about 5.8 million subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the restatement, Adelphia ranked among the most
leveraged of the major cable companies, with about $15 billion in
debt. As part of an industrywide consolidation, Adelphia purchased
several rivals in recent years, including Century Communications
Corp., the leading provider in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Adelphia, like other cable firms, poured millions of
dollars into costly upgrades of its systems. The new digital
technology enabled it to sell Internet access and interactive
television services.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia said it is continuing to work with its auditor to
complete its 2001 annual report.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Times wire services were used in compiling this report.</TE>

<LD>The Southland's largest publicly traded companies have tripled the
number of women and ethnic minorities on their corporate boards
during the last 10 years, a new study found, although observers were
split over whether the gains were impressive or merely modest.</LD>
<LD>   Women and people of color held 16% of the board seats on the 41
largest publicly traded companies in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura
counties last year, the study said. That's up from 5.4% in 1991.</LD>
<LD>   The study, released this week by Los Angeles-based executive
search firm Berkhemer Clayton Inc., examined companies with at least
$1 billion in 2001 revenue.</LD>
<TE>   Women and minorities held 68 of 416 seats on those boards last
year, compared with 20 of 369 seats for the same corporations in
1991.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the growth stems from companies that have expanded their
boards by creating new seats. In other cases, companies made
concerted efforts to increase diversity.</TE>
<TE>   Ryland Group, a Calabasas-based home builder, went from no women
or minorities in 1991 to two women and two minorities last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the decisions about buying a house are made by
women--that's just a fact," said Ryland Chairman and Chief Executive
Chad Dreier.</TE>
<TE>   "And one-half of our houses are sold to minorities."</TE>
<TE>   George Ott, who heads the local chapter of the National Assn. of
Corporate Directors, saw the increase as "a pretty good jump,
considering that board seats just don't turn over very much."</TE>
<TE>   Betsy Berkhemer-Credaire, whose company released the study, said
she was happy to see some increase but called the growth modest.</TE>
<TE>   "Corporations are moving in a positive direction, but 16% isn't
much," said Berkhemer-Credaire, whose firm has launched a service to
help corporations find female and minority directors.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the growth, minorities and women still hold a small
fraction of board seats locally.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, minorities held 0.5% of the board seats, and only two of
the 41 companies--Burbank-based Walt Disney Co. and Century
City-based Northrop Grumman Corp.--had minorities on their boards.</TE>
<TE>   By 2001, the minority makeup on those boards grew to about 5%, but
28 of the 41 firms still lacked directors of color.</TE>
<TE>   Women made up nearly 5% of the corporate boards in 1991. That
figure grew to 11.3% by last year, when only nine firms had no female
directors.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said that in the next several years, the pace of change
may pick up, thanks in part to the recent Enron Corp. scandal, which
has triggered a wholesale review of corporate governance issues.</TE>
<TE>   Among other changes, some chief executives are being pressured by
shareholders, including institutional investors, to give up board
seats on outside companies so they can concentrate more fully on
their jobs, said Roger W. Raber, president and chief executive of the
Washington-based National Assn. of Corporate Directors.</TE>
<TE>   That will help address the low turnover that has stymied efforts
to increase diversity, he said.</TE>
<TE>   And several of the largest executive search firms are developing
services devoted exclusively to helping boards find new, and more
diverse, candidates, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been an increasing interest in bringing more diversity to
the board room," Raber said. "What happened at Enron is going to
hasten that."</TE>
<TE>   But even in Southern California, home to one of the most diverse
business communities in the nation, there is much room for
improvement, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Seven of the firms surveyed-- including Smart &amp; Final Inc. in
Commerce and Computer Sciences Corp. in El Segundo--had no women or
people of color in either year, the report showed. Representatives
from those firms either declined to comment or did not return phone
calls.</TE>
<TE>   The most diverse board could be found at Disney, which had three
female or minority directors in 1991 and six last year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Costa Mesa drug maker ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. reported a 60% hike in
first-quarter net income as royalties more than doubled for its
biggest product, the hepatitis C drug ribavirin.</LD>
<LD>   ICN, which also sells antibiotics, sedatives, vitamins and
cosmetic lasers, said net income rose to $33.7 million, or 40 cents a
share, from $21 million, or 26 cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue increased 23% to $245.7 million.</LD>
<TE>   The earnings exceeded Wall Street estimates averaging 36 cents a
share, and Chairman Milan Panic said he expects better results for
the second quarter. He forecast earnings to exceed current Wall
Street estimates of 43 cents a share for the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   For the first quarter, ribavirin royalties jumped to $57 million
from $27.6 million as more doctors prescribed the antiviral drug in
combination with Schering-Plough Corp.'s Intron A and an improved
version called Peg-Intron. Schering-Plough introduced Peg-Intron in
October. It sells the former combination as Rebetol.</TE>
<TE>   ICN also sells ribavirin overseas in other forms for viral
diseases such as herpes, influenza, measles, chicken pox and HIV.
Ribavirin made up 16% of product sales last year, the bulk of that
from royalties, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of ICN's specialty pharmaceuticals, a line of more than 400
prescription drugs and 200 nonprescription products sold in 40
countries, increased 10% to $188.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   ICN partially spun off Ribapharm Inc., which makes ribavirin, in
an initial public stock offering last month. But a group of dissident
shareholders called for ICN to break up into three separate
businesses to enhance shareholder value.</TE>
<TE>   ICN stock rose 7 cents to close at $27.80 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Other earnings from California companies:</TE>
<TE>   * Calpine Corp. reported a first-quarter net loss of $74.3
million, or 24 cents a share, contrasted with net income of $119.7
million, or 36 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 30% to $1.74
billion from $1.34 billion as new plants owned by the San Jose-based
power plant developer boosted generating capacity.</TE>
<TE>   * Clorox Co.'s fiscal third-quarter net income dropped to $46
million, or 20 cents a share, from $79 million, or 33 cents, a year
earlier. Revenue for the Oakland home products manufacturer rose 7.4%
to $1.03 billion in the period ended March 31.</TE>
<TE>   * Health Net Inc. said first-quarter net income rose to $49.8
million, or 40 cents a share, from $42.4 million, or 34 cents, a year
earlier. Revenue fell to $2.47 billion from $2.49 billion as
enrollment in the Woodland Hills insurance company's health plans
declined.</TE>
<TE>   * Rubio's Restaurants Inc. reported first-quarter net income of
$427,000, or 5 cents a share, contrasted with a net loss of $154,000,
or 2 cents, a year earlier. Revenue for the Carlsbad restaurant chain
was up 12.4% to $29.9 million.</TE>

<HD>Chip Sales Fall 25% in March From a Year Ago</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Worldwide computer chip sales fell 25% in March from a year ago, the
smallest decline since last June, thanks to a resumption of sales to
personal computer makers. But compared with February, chip sales rose
7.2%, the highest month-to-month increase in 16 years.</LD>
<LD>   Sales totaled $10.75 billion in March, down from $14.41 billion in
March 2001 but up from $10.03 billion in February, the Semiconductor
Industry Assn. said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Chip makers such as Intel Corp., Texas Instruments Inc. and
Samsung Electronics Co. cut production and worked off inventories
last year amid the industry's worst year on record. Although signs
are beginning to emerge of a recovery in chip demand, investors said
they're still not sure whether the trend will continue.</LD>
<TE>   The industry "is bottoming out, but I'm not sure if demand for
final products [such as PCs] is strong enough to sustain a rally in
chip sales," said Nobuaki Murayama, who helps manage $462 million in
equities at Cigna International Investment Advisors Co.</TE>
<TE>   First-quarter sales rose 5.6% to $32.25 billion from the fourth
quarter last year, thanks to a record 82.4% revenue surge for dynamic
random-access memory chips, SIA said.</TE>
<TE>   DRAM prices plummeted to below the cost of production last year
after PC sales slumped, resulting in huge losses among memory chip
makers. DRAMs are the main memory in personal computers and other
consumer electronics.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's five largest chip makers racked up losses of $11.6 billion
last fiscal year, and South Korea's Hynix Semiconductor Inc., the
world's third-largest memory chip maker, turned to creditors for two
multibillion-dollar bailouts to remain alive.</TE>
<TE>   "The March quarter sales are another sign that the industry is
rebuilding from 2001, with growth in all major geographic regions
except Japan, which was flat," said SIA President George Scalise.
"The DRAM sales are a result of increased demand and price increases
from the depressed levels of 2001."</TE>

<HD>NBC Confirms Clinton Meeting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC officials confirmed Thursday that they met with Bill Clinton this
week in Los Angeles to discuss various TV ideas, although a
spokeswoman for the former president downplayed a Times report that
he was pitching himself as a talk show host.</LD>
<LD>   NBC executives met with Clinton on Wednesday for lunch at the
offices of producers Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and Harry Thomason
who, sources say, orchestrated the meeting to pitch the former
president as host of a talk show similar to "The Oprah Winfrey Show."
The price tag for Clinton was set at $50 million a year, sources
said.</LD>
<LD>   Among other ideas discussed was a weekly political talk show,
according to an NBC source.</LD>
<TE>   "[The] informal meeting was one of many meetings President Clinton
has had with many people over the past year," said Julia Payne, a
Clinton spokeswoman. "President Clinton did not demand a talk show.
He went to listen."</TE>
<TE>   Payne confirmed the meeting at the Thomasons' offices, but said,
"We don't have a second meeting [planned]."</TE>
<TE>   Privately, an NBC source said it was unlikely that Clinton would
go beyond the talking stage and actually do a TV show.</TE>
<TE>   A key figure in the discussions with NBC was Harry Thomason, an
Arkansas native who has known the former president since he was
governor. Thomason and his wife, who are best known in Hollywood for
the hit 1980s comedy, "Designing Women," had been advisors to Clinton
at various times during his presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood sources say Thomason arranged the meeting with Ed
Wilson, who is president of NBC Enterprises, the network's
syndication division, and an Arkansas native. NBC President Andrew
Lack also was at the meeting Wednesday, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of a former president hosting a talk show was the hottest
topic in Hollywood on Thursday. Most television executives dismissed
the idea because a 39-week, daily program schedule would trap Clinton
in New York or Los Angeles and keep him off the lucrative speaking
circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "If Clinton has a need to go against tradition, the perfect forum
is for him to go on PBS once a month and hold a town meeting with
opinion makers and world leaders," said Larry Lyttle, president of
Big Ticket Television, a Viacom Inc. company that produces "Judge
Judy."</TE>
<TE>   "To be a great talk show host, you have to ... let guests take
center stage. When you are the former president of the United States,
you are always going to be the center," Lyttle said.</TE>

<LD>EchoStar Communications Corp.'s first-quarter loss narrowed as the
second-largest U.S. satellite TV broadcaster added more subscribers
than analysts expected and sales rose 28%.</LD>
<LD>   EchoStar's loss narrowed to $38.6 million, or 20 cents a share,
from $169.9 million, or 36 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose to $1.1
billion from $861.9 million.</LD>
<LD>   EchoStar, which has agreed to purchase larger rival Hughes
Electronics Corp., added 335,000 subscribers to its Dish Network.
Analysts had forecast as many as 315,000 new users. Costs to acquire
customers this year will be higher than the $395 per user the company
expected because of promotions and greater expenses to help
subscribers pay for equipment.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Littleton, Colo.-based EchoStar dropped $1.35 to $26.26

<DL></DL>
<LD>Adult entertainment company Playboy Enterprises Inc. reported its
first-quarter net loss narrowed, helped by improved results in its
online and television divisions.</LD>
<LD>   The Chicago-based publisher of Playboy magazine, which also has
cable-TV channels, a home video division and Web programming,
reported a net loss of $9.4 million, or 38 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $11.8 million, or 49 cents, the year before. This
year's results included a charge of $5.8 million related to a change
in accounting rules. Revenue rose slightly to $66.1 million from
$65.4 million. The company reported that earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, a common measure of operating
performance, nearly doubled to $14.6 million in the first quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Another potentially positive development for Playboy involves
debt-laden cable television provider Adelphia Communications Corp.,
the nation's only major carrier that does not carry adult channels.
If Adelphia goes through with plans to sell some of its subscriber
base, the buyer probably would add Playboy channels to some of those
accounts, Playboy said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As part of a reorganization of its specialty film business, Universal
Studios said Thursday that it will acquire Good Machine, a highly
successful producer of independent films, including Ang Lee's hit
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."</LD>
<LD>   Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Good Machine principals David Linde and James Schamus, based in
New York, would manage the new specialty film unit, to be called
Focus, reporting to Universal Pictures chief Stacey Snider. Focus
would combine USA Films' production marketing and distribution with
Good Machine's management team and international sales unit and
produce up to 12 films a year.</LD>
<TE>   The consolidation follows Vivendi Universal's $11-billion
acquisition of the film and television businesses of USA Networks
Inc. Universal wanted to eliminate overlapping functions among the
specialty film labels of Universal Focus, USA Films and Studio Canal
USA.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Greenstein, the current chairman of USA Films, who had been
expected to lead the new label, would step down.</TE>

<HD>Factory Orders Rise; Jobless Claims Fall</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Factory orders rose more than expected in March, but spending on
goods such as machinery and computer equipment--a barometer of
business investment seen as crucial for the nation's economic
recovery--fell, data released Thursday showed.</LD>
<LD>   A separate report showed the unemployed are having trouble finding
work even though the number of Americans lining up to claim jobless
benefits dropped last week.</LD>
<LD>   "The economy is expanding, but we are simply growing at a slower
rate," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in
Minneapolis. "We cannot really expect the economy to be growing as
rapidly as it did in the first quarter."</LD>
<TE>   The economy rocketed along in the first three months of this year.
The government said last week that gross domestic product, the
broadest economic gauge, grew at a 5.8% annual pace, its fastest clip
in more than two years.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, some of the recent data have raised questions about
the speed of the recovery in the near term.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department said Thursday that new orders at U.S.
factories rose 0.4%, beating economists' expectations of a 0.1% rise.
Nondurable goods led the way with a 1.6% increase.</TE>
<TE>   But demand for machinery tumbled 1.2% and orders for computer
products fell 1.9% in another sign that businesses remain skeptical
about the recovery.</TE>
<TE>   A separate report from the Labor Department said first-time
jobless benefit claims--a guide to the job market and the pace of
layoffs--fell 10,000 to 418,000 last week from 428,000 the previous
week, but stayed well above Wall Street's forecast of 407,000. The
figure has been above the key 400,000 level for six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "The initial read suggests a bit more weakness in labor markets
than one would have expected," said Paul Ferley, assistant chief
economist for Bank of Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department is due to release today the closely watched
monthly employment report for April. Analysts are expecting only a
slight improvement in the jobs market.</TE>

<HD>Edison, PG&amp;E File to Resume Power Purchases</HD>
<DH>Utility: Move key to getting state out of
electricity-buying business. PUC showdown is expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric told state
utility regulators that they must be able to sign long-term contracts
and pass electricity price spikes on to customers if the utilities
are to resume power purchases that the state has been making on their
behalf.</LD>
<LD>   The filings, made late Wednesday with the Public Utilities
Commission, are a key step in getting the state out of the
power-buying business by the end of the year, as required by state
law. But the plans appear headed for a showdown with a much more
restrictive proposal by PUC President Loretta Lynch.</LD>
<LD>   The Lynch proposal addresses only 2003 and would require the
utilities to buy power on the spot market, or through contracts that
are no longer than one year.</LD>
<TE>   Edison President Robert Foster said Thursday that Lynch's proposal
ties the utilities too much to potentially volatile spot markets and
would repeat the mistakes that pushed the utilities to the edge of
bankruptcy in January 2001. Pacific Gas and Electric subsequently
filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2001. Power sellers refused
to deal with the utilities, and the state Department of Water
Resources, under an emergency order by Gov. Gray Davis, stepped in to
buy electricity for the 10 million customers of Edison, PG&amp;E and San
Diego Gas &amp; Electric.</TE>
<TE>   "That is not an appropriate path. It's a path that could return us
to crisis," Foster said in a conference call with reporters. Edison
wants to sign multiyear deals and to begin the process this fall in
partnership with the DWR as a transition to negotiating its own deals
once it regains an investment-grade rating from Wall Street debt
rating firms.</TE>
<TE>   Key to becoming investment grade again is the ability to pass any
increases in power costs on to users, Edison said in its filing,
which proposed a formula for changing rates without a PUC vote if
electricity costs change. Edison is rated BB, two notches below
investment grade.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocate Doug Heller said such a proposal shifts the risk
of volatile prices to customers.</TE>
<TE>   "Edison is using their theoretical need for credit-worthiness in
order to pass on all the costs of their deregulation disaster
forever," said Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer &amp; Consumer
Rights.</TE>
<TE>   SDG&amp;E took a different path and advocated that the PUC and the
state Legislature postpone returning power purchasing to the
utilities for another year so that a comprehensive statewide system
for buying power can be developed.</TE>
<TE>   The utility filings are part of a PUC proceeding that is expected
to result in a commission decision by early October. Hearings on the
matter are scheduled for June.</TE>

<HD>Enron to Unveil Restructure Plan</HD>
<DH>Energy: The new company would include utilities, pipelines,
exploration operations. Creditors will have choice of selling assets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. today will offer creditors a plan that could result in
Enron's reassembling itself as an integrated energy company with $10
billion in assets, Enron's lead bankruptcy lawyer said.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, drafted by Enron's new management team, will be
presented to Enron's 15-member official unsecured-creditors committee
in New York today and unveiled publicly afterward in a conference
call led by Enron's chief executive, Stephen Cooper.</LD>
<LD>   "What Enron is proposing ... is a method to determine whether its
pipelines, power projects and exploration businesses are worth more
bundled together or sold separately," the bankruptcy lawyer, Martin
Bienenstock of law firm Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges in New York, said
Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   A reshuffled Enron could quickly be put on the auction block and
sold if that's what creditors demanded, Bienenstock said.</TE>
<TE>   The main idea of the plan is to separate decisions about the best
way to maximize the value of Enron's remaining assets from decisions
about how the proceeds will be split among creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Enron filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history Dec. 2, owing
creditors an estimated $60 billion to $100 billion.</TE>
<TE>   A reconstituted Enron could include Oregon utility Portland
General Electric Co., Brazilian utility Elektro, about 15,000 miles
of natural gas pipelines in North America and South America and oil
and gas exploration operations.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's investment bankers value the new company's assets at $10
billion to $20 billion, Bienenstock said. He said the plan aims to
save 20,000 jobs at the Houston-based company.</TE>
<TE>   Luc Despins, lawyer for the official creditors committee, did not
respond to requests for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for other Enron creditors reserved judgment.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen the plan, but I don't think Enron has $10 billion
worth of assets," said Rhett G. Campbell, whose Houston law firm,
Thompson &amp; Knight, represents a group of Enron energy creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Entwistle, who represents a Florida state pension plan that
lost $334 million on Enron bonds and stock, said it has long been
Cooper's plan to bundle assets into an operating company and offer an
ownership stake in the company to creditors to satisfy their claims.</TE>
<TE>   It will be impossible to judge a business plan until Enron's new
court-appointed examiner has completed a preliminary investigation,
Entwistle said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez approved the
position last month, but the examiner has yet to be named. Part of
the examiner's job will be to identify the remaining assets, a task
that will entail penetrating the thicket of limited partnerships and
other "special-purpose entities" Enron created to hide debts and
boost its reported profit.</TE>

<HD>Searching for Fresh Options</HD>
<DH>Restaurants: 'Fast-casual' chains are small but growing
quickly, spurring fast-food giants to upgrade menus or gobble up
upstart rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumers hungering for tasty food at a moderate price are flocking
to so-called fast-casual restaurant chains, making them the
fastest-growing segment of the restaurant industry.</LD>
<LD>   Fast-casual outlets such as Baja Fresh Mexican Grill, Panera Bread
Co. and Panda Express--which combine the speed of fast food with the
quality and freshness of a casual dining chain--still grab only a
small share of Americans' overall dining dollar.</LD>
<LD>   But their growing popularity, coming partly at the expense of
slower-growing traditional fast-food giants, is triggering McDonald's
Corp., Wendy's International Inc. and others to counterattack with
their own versions of fast-casual fare or by acquiring their own
fast-casual chains.</LD>
<TE>   The result is a fierce battle for market share, posing risks for
fast-casual chains that lack the advertising and marketing muscle of
their bigger rivals. Fast-food chains also face risks because their
burgers-and-fries image may not attract diners seeking alternatives.
Competition--always fierce in the restaurant industry anyway--already has
taken its toll on some earlier upstart fast-casual chains.</TE>
<TE>   Several dining trends are driving the fast-casual boom. Aging baby
boomers and others--suffering from what one analyst calls "fast-food
fatigue"--are eager to move up to classier fare. Cost-conscious
businesspeople are looking for inexpensive but still presentable
alternatives for client expense-account lunches. Diet-conscious
consumers are looking for healthier or less caloric versions of fast
food.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, despite the sluggish economy and an overall decline in
restaurant visits, fast-casual chains "are a bright spot in the
restaurant industry," said Tim Carlin, senior associate at Technomic
Inc., a research and consulting firm in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Sales for the fast-casual segment are growing at a robust 6% to 8%
annually, to a total of $2.75 billion last year. That is still less
than 1% of the $411-billion restaurant industry, said Technomic. By
contrast, fast food--growing at 1% to 2% annually--registered revenue
of $128 billion, accounting for nearly one-third of all restaurant
sales.</TE>
<TE>   The potential to take share from other dining segments has
attracted a host of well-established players and upstarts.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfgang Puck, best known for his ritzy Spago restaurants,
plans--in conjunction with franchisees--to expand his fast-casual
Wolfgang Puck Express from 19 units today to 300 by the end of 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh Enterprises Inc. of Thousand Oaks, owner of Baja Fresh,
filed for a public stock offering last week amid a strong market for
equities of many fast-casual and casual restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Panda, the nation's largest Chinese restaurant chain, is expected
to open its 500th restaurant soon, spokesman Wen Hong said.</TE>
<TE>   And Panera Bread, a premium sandwich chain, has seen its stock
price more than double.</TE>
<TE>   To blunt the challenge while broadening their appeal beyond
the core audience of young males, many fast-food chains are adding
premium products or gobbling up fast-casual competitors.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, they have become more like those rivals, said Bob
Sandelman, a Villa Park restaurant consultant.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's, the world's largest fast-food chain, said recently
that it planned to jointly develop as many as 30 outlets with
Fazoli's, a Kentucky-based fast-casual chain of about 400 Italian
restaurants. McDonald's also said it eventually could acquire the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Arby's, the Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based unit of Triarc Cos. known
for its roast beef sandwiches, last year unveiled a line of Market
Fresh sandwiches, which sell for up to $4.29, company spokeswoman
Anne Kirchhoff said.</TE>
<TE>   CKE Restaurants Inc., the Santa Barbara-based parent of the Carl's
Jr. and Hardee's hamburger chains, last year introduced the
Six-Dollar Burger, a hamburger that actually sells for $3.95. The
popularity of the sandwich has helped boost sales and move CKE toward
profitability, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Wendy's offers four upscale salads at about $3.99 each,
which helped increase same-store sales by 5.6% in the first quarter,
the company said.</TE>
<TE>   But Technomic analyst Carlin said there's a limit to how far
fast-food chains can wander from their pizza-and-fried-chicken roots.</TE>
<TE>   That limit could allow fast-casual chains such as Baja Fresh and
Panera to continue to do well.</TE>
<TE>   Baja Fresh, which had an operating profit of $6.4 million, before
charges, on sales of $72.8 million in 2001, hopes to raise $58
million from its planned IPO. The 157-store chain, which hopes to
expand to 500 outlets within three to five years, has won a loyal
following with its lard-free beans and charbroiled mahi mahi fish
tacos, among other items.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything here tastes yummy and authentic," said Cammy Devereux,
a 34-year-old teacher, as she ate a soft taco combo meal at a Costa
Mesa restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Panera, based near St. Louis, has rung up strong profit and sales
by offering premium sandwiches on freshly baked gourmet bread,
homemade soups and upscale coffees. Meals are served on real plates
with silverware.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, earnings jumped 92% to $13.1 million. Revenue at the
369-restaurant chain--which does not have outlets in Southern
California--increased 51% to more than $529 million.</TE>
<TE>   Not all fast-casual chains have met unqualified success.</TE>
<TE>   Boston Market, one of the segment's pioneers, slid into bankruptcy
protection in the late 1990s after a period of supercharged growth.
The chain, which once had more than 1,000 restaurants, expanded too
quickly and signed some expensive leases, analysts said. McDonald's
acquired the chain two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Carlsbad, Calif.-based Rubio's Restaurants Inc., famous for its
fish tacos, put its plans for a national roll-out on hold because of
trying times, Chief Executive Ralph Rubio said. In 2001, the company
shut down 10 stores, mainly in Denver, Salt Lake City and Las Vegas.
The problems: Fish tacos don't translate well outside Southern
California, and some stores were in bad locations, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, seeking to ride the fast-casual wave, several fast-food
chains have snapped up or purchased stakes in such chains, lest they
get left behind.</TE>
<TE>   In March, CKE acquired Santa Barbara Restaurant Group Inc. in a
stock swap valued at nearly $82 million. The deal gave CKE ownership
of the 95-outlet La Salsa chain, a Baja Fresh competitor.</TE>
<TE>   One month earlier, Wendy's made its first foray into the
fast-casual arena by investing $10 million for a 45% stake in Cafe
Express, a Houston-based chain of 13 restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's, suffering six consecutive quarters of shrinking
profit, has jumped most aggressively into the fray. In addition to
its recent partnership with Fazoli's, it has a stake in 1,280
non-burger outlets worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Schlosser, author of the bestseller "Fast Food Nation," said
fast-food companies such as McDonald's are branching out by necessity
rather than choice. Simply put: There are so many burger, pizza and
fried chicken joints that there's little room for expansion.</TE>
<TE>   "The hamburger-and-fries model is something out of the last
century," he said. "Fast casual is the future."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fleetwood Enterprises Inc., the largest maker of recreational
vehicles, said it will report its eighth straight quarterly loss next
month because of a slowdown in its manufactured-housing business.</LD>
<LD>   Fleetwood didn't specify the size of the loss for its fiscal
fourth quarter ended April 28. It had a loss of $44.5 million, or
$1.36 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 8% to $591 million from
$547 million, based on preliminary results, Fleetwood said.</LD>
<LD>   Recreational vehicle sales rose 28% while manufactured housing
sales fell 15% in the quarter, the Riverside-based company said.</LD>
<TE>   "The sales improvement in the last half of the year in our RV
group was gratifying," said David Engelman, Fleetwood's interim chief
operating officer. "Manufactured housing, however, continues to face
a difficult environment, which we expect to continue at least through
calendar 2002."</TE>
<TE>   Its shares rose 52 cents to $11.12 on the New York Stock Exchange
after the news was announced.</TE>

<HD>Race Is On to Get Gay Network on the Air in U.S.</HD>
<DH>TV: Viacom's, Canadian channel's efforts reflect programs'
growing acceptance, digital cable's need for shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just five years after Ellen DeGeneres shattered stereotypes as the
first openly gay lead character in a television sitcom, attitudes
have changed so dramatically that media companies are laying the
groundwork to launch cable networks devoted to gay viewers.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike the almost routine presence of gay characters on mainstream
television these days, the new networks would focus exclusively on
gay lifestyles with shows about fitness, travel, politics and even
explicit sex.</LD>
<LD>   The efforts of media giant Viacom Inc. and the Canadian channel
PrideVision reflect the growing acceptance of gay programming and the
increasing demand for new shows to fill up hundreds of digital cable
channels.</LD>
<TE>   PrideVision debuted in Canada in September, and its operators are
shopping for distribution and funding in the United States. Viacom
announced this year that its MTV and Showtime divisions are exploring
a joint effort to create a gay network.</TE>
<TE>   Marketers covet gay audiences because they are believed to have
more disposable income than other viewers and be more willing to
spend it on entertainment. Still, the race to launch a 24-hour-a-day
gay channel astounds veteran gay activists.</TE>
<TE>   "Thirty years ago it would have taken a civil rights action to get
something like this started. Now it's a business decision," said
author Malcom Boyd. "I never thought in my lifetime I would see
anything like this."</TE>
<TE>   It took mainstream networks to show the way. ABC was picketed
after DeGeneres came out on her show. But NBC's "Will &amp; Grace" is a
hit with straight and gay viewers alike. Likewise, Showtime's "Queer
as Folk" and HBO's "Six Feet Under."</TE>
<TE>   "For networks, a lot of it has to do with the lowering of the fear
threshold about gay content," said Larry Gross, author of "Up From
Invisibility: Lesbians, Gay Men and the Media in America."</TE>
<TE>   "The shows got on and the Earth did not open up and swallow them
up. The peasants with pitchforks did not march on the studios."</TE>
<TE>   Although welcomed by gay viewers, PrideVision does little to quell
the stereotype of gay men as fitness-obsessed, sex-crazed partyers
who swoon over Barbra Streisand. Indeed, its shows, with names such
as "SoGay TV," "Bump!" and "Locker Room," feature lots of innuendo
and flesh. After midnight, the channel shows sexually explicit
programs, alternating between "Frisky Femmes" and "Steamy Knights."</TE>
<TE>   Viacom has divulged little about its plans.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the growing acceptance of gay programming on television,
some conservative groups in the United States have vowed to oppose
any all-gay network. Unlike similar cable networks targeting a
particular audience--such as Lifetime for women and Black
Entertainment Television for African Americans--the prospect of a gay
channel still inspires condemnation from some.</TE>
<TE>   L. Brent Bozell, president of the Parents Television Council,
wrote in January that the creation of a gay cable channel "is not
some kind of affirmative-action proposal to bring gays into
Hollywood. They're there, at every level, already. This is a move to
promote the homosexual lifestyle to the public."</TE>
<TE>   Some U.S. residents want their gay TV so badly that they have
circumvented federal law by purchasing Canadian satellite receivers
and established fake Canadian mailing addresses to sign up for
PrideVision, which is owned by Headline Media Group Inc. and counts
18,000 subscribers who pay about $7.50 a month for the channel.
Headline Chief Executive John Levy said the channel needs 245,000
subscribers to break even.</TE>
<TE>   That's a tiny audience by traditional broadcast standards. But in
the new world of digital cable and satellite service, it's possible
for networks to be profitable with a small audience. PrideVision has
guaranteed distribution on Canadian cable and satellite systems. It's
negotiating with U.S. operators, but has yet to secure a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Although a pay channel, PrideVision supplements its income with
advertising. Levy said the advertising was needed to help pay for
original programming. Early niche channels such as Lifetime were able
to buy programming. But the dearth of gay shows meant PrideVision had
to produce its own.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to have programs specifically by and for the ... audience
to do a pay, 24-hour-a-day channel," Levy said. "There was just not
that much out there we could pick up in the way of gay programming
directly for a gay audience."</TE>
<TE>   Programming will make or break a niche pay channel.</TE>
<TE>   "A novelty will take you just so far," said industry analyst Derek
Baine of Kagan World Media.</TE>
<TE>   Baine said he would be "a lot more bullish" on Viacom if the two
companies try to launch networks simultaneously. But Michael Thorton,
who heads acquisition for satellite service DirecTV, said he has met
with PrideVision and Viacom and might carry both channels.</TE>
<TE>   Jason, a 28-year-old Santa Monica resident who did not want his
last name used because he receives PrideVision illegally, said he is
a big fan of the channel.</TE>
<TE>   "The travel show 'Bump!' is my favorite, and I like 'SoGay TV,'
which gets into serious topics and sometimes real risque topics. And
they have a lot of eye candy."</TE>
<TE>   The eye candy is mostly male and buff. Although some PrideVision
shows address serious matters, many of the programs, no matter what
the subject matter, feature young men with at least their shirts off.
Even a segment on the "Locker Room" at a gay ski event featured a guy
on the snow with chest bare and muscles bulging.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you can count on that being the case with Showtime too if
that channel happens," said Gross, who teaches at the University of
Pennsylvania. "There is no question eye candy is going to be a major
ingredient. Just look on any newsstand--this culture is drenched in
it."</TE>
<TE>   Suzanna Walters, author of the book, "All the Rage--The Story of
Gay Visibility in America," has seen PrideVision shows and was
disappointed by the lack of sexual, race and age diversity. But she
understands the economic underpinnings of the choice.</TE>
<TE>   "When they think of the gay person with disposable income, they
think of the young, white, urban male with no children. So, you are
probably not going to see much of a black lesbian single parent."</TE>
<TE>   But, she said, "I guess that having some version of yourself
portrayed is better than nothing at all. And it does get away from
some of the old stereotypes. I'd rather be considered a niche of a
niche market than portrayed as a killer prison matron from hell."</TE>

<HD>Allstate Wins State Approval for Rate Hikes</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Increases of 18.5% for homeowners and 8.9% for
motorists will begin taking effect this month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State regulators Thursday granted Allstate Corp. increases in auto
and homeowner insurance rates--more bad news for California consumers
already grappling with rising premiums and diminishing options.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by the state Department of Insurance comes on the
heels of other rate increases, including hikes totaling more than 14%
for State Farm General Insurance Co., the state's largest home
insurer. Farmers Insurance Group and the Automobile Club of Southern
California have rate-increase requests pending, and State Farm said
last week that it would stop writing new homeowner policies in
California because of rising losses.</LD>
<LD>   Allstate, California's third-largest insurer, asked for a 22.3%
increase for homeowner policies and was granted 18.5%. For auto
coverage, it requested 20.1% and was granted 8.9%.</LD>
<TE>   The company's 895,000 California homeowner policies have an
average annual premium of $605, Allstate spokeswoman Lisa Wannamaker
said. The increase will boost the payment on such a policy by about
$112 a year. The average annual increase for Allstate's 2 million
auto policyholders, who pay an average of $718 a year, will be $64.</TE>
<TE>   The increase appears to demonstrate that insurers have convinced
the Department of Insurance that they are in a genuine profit
squeeze, as shown by a series of recent downgrades of insurance
company credit ratings.</TE>
<TE>   The most convincing evidence of that may have been State Farm's
announcement last week that it would suspend taking on new homeowner
business in California because of rising building costs and soaring
claims related to mold.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people say insurers just want to make a lot of money, but
you can tell it's serious when State Farm says they're no longer
going to sell insurance," said Brian Sullivan, an independent
insurance analyst who edits trade journal Property Insurance Report.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to say they're making big money when they aren't
selling any insurance."</TE>
<TE>   For many years, strong profits on auto coverage and a bull market
for investments helped subsidize homeowner rates, Sullivan said.
Allstate, for example, hadn't raised rates for homeowner policies
since 1994, although the company increased auto rates last year by
6.2%.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all in a little bit of sticker shock now, but the trends
have turned," said Nancy Kramer, a spokeswoman for the California
Department of Insurance. "Claims are up, and the cost of
claims--especially medical--has gone through the roof. And then the
stock market bubble burst, so the market is no longer shoring up
their losses" on operations.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the State Farm and Allstate actions, 21st Century
Insurance said recently that it would end its three-year experiment
with selling homeowner insurance in California.</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills-based 21st Century instead has begun referring
customers to a subsidiary of Countrywide Credit Industries Inc. for
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan noted that auto rates actually went down somewhat in the
late 1990s, while homeowner rates remained flat. The homeowner market
hasn't been highly profitable since the 1960s and 1970s, he said, but
big carriers such as Allstate, State Farm and No. 2 California
insurer Farmers had bundled auto and homeowner polices profitably.</TE>
<TE>   Now, though, the industry is suffering from a triple whammy, he
said: skyrocketing auto claims, the high cost of building materials
and labor, and "the whole hullabaloo over mold caused by water
damage."</TE>
<TE>   Rates also had been held down in recent years because State Farm,
which had a huge surplus, had decided to keep its rates down at all
costs to maintain its market share--even though it was losing money.
Its decision to stop writing new homeowner policies in California,
along with its departure from the mold-ridden Texas market and other
cutbacks, indicates that policy has ended, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The higher Allstate rates go into effect May 13 for new and
renewed homeowner policies and May 27 for auto policies.</TE>

<HD>Nasdaq at Lowest Level in 6 Months</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Doubts about a rebound in tech earnings continue
to hurt index, which has dropped nearly 12% since April 1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The battered Nasdaq composite index slid Thursday to a new six-month
low, while blue chips ended mixed after a two-day rally.</LD>
<LD>   In other trading, the dollar strengthened against key currencies
after the Swiss National Bank cut interest rates. And crude oil
prices fell as Mideast tensions eased somewhat.</LD>
<LD>   On Wall Street, many big technology stocks remained "falling
knives," dropping in some cases to new multiyear lows.</LD>
<TE>   The selling dragged the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite down 32.71
points, or 2%, to 1,644.82, its lowest since Oct. 10. The index has
dropped nearly 12% since April 1.</TE>
<TE>   The tech sector was slammed anew by disappointing earnings from
Priceline.com and by a debt downgrade of Xerox. Priceline .com
tumbled $1.16, or 22%, to $4.09 and Xerox slumped $1.08, or 12%, to
$7.99.</TE>
<TE>   Also, troubled telecom giant WorldCom's shares hit a new 10-year
low, down 18 cents to $2.03.</TE>
<TE>   The tech sector's main problem continues to be that investors
don't believe an earnings turnaround will happen soon despite the
economy's rebound, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors also appear to be throwing in the towel on major
names such as WorldCom, Sun Microsystems and Oracle.</TE>
<TE>   Sun and Oracle fell to new multiyear lows Thursday, with Sun off
52 cents to $6.45 and Oracle down 90 cents to $8.55.</TE>
<TE>   "The mood is ugly," said Seth Tobias, a trader for hedge fund
Circle T Partners. "Buyers are staying on the sidelines."</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch analyst Christopher Shilakes advised clients in a
note not to "bargain hunt" among depressed technology shares, "given
continuing concerns of earnings risks for bellwethers like Oracle
which could cap any near- term rallies in the group," according to
Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Still, winners and losers were nearly even on Nasdaq overall,
reflecting that many investors continue to snap up non-tech names.
Winners topped losers by 18 to 13 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   In the broader market, the Dow Jones industrials added 32.24
points, or 0.3%, to 10,091.87, and the Standard &amp; Poor's small-stock
index rose 0.4%.</TE>
<TE>   In currency trading, the dollar rose against the yen and the Swiss
franc after the Swiss National Bank cut its key short-term rate half
a point, to a range of 0.75% to 1.75%, to halt the franc's recent
climb against the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   The news caught traders off guard, even though other major central
banks aren't expected to reduce their rates.</TE>
<TE>   In commodities markets, near-term crude oil futures in New York
fell 51 cents to $26.24 a barrel.</TE>
<TE>   Gold continued to ease from recent two-year highs, losing 80 cents
to $308.30 an ounce in New York futures trading.</TE>
<TE>   Among Thursday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * In the tech sector, Cisco Systems lost 6 cents to $13.64, IBM
fell 44 cents to $83.86 and Microsoft dropped $1.54 to $51.21.</TE>
<TE>   * Among telecom shares, AT&amp;T fell 29 cents to $13.67 and Equant
lost 70 cents to $8.32.</TE>
<TE>   * Some investors turned to heavy-industry shares. Steel firm Nucor
rose $1.76 to $59.69. Weyerhaeuser gained $1.73 to $61.12.</TE>
<TE>   * Consumer-related shares also rallied, led by Alberto-Culver, up
$1.33 to $56.54; Clorox, up $1.81 to $46.39; and Wendy's
International, up $1.28 to $38.21.</TE>
<TE>   * Among bank stocks, Citigroup rose $1.17 to $44.95 and Bank of
America added $1.31 to $73.55, a 52-week high.</TE>
<TE>   * Biotechnology firm Protein Design Labs slumped $3.43 to $13.90
after saying Laurence Jay Korn, a co-founder of the company, had
resigned from the chief executive post he has held since 1987.</TE>
<TE>   * In Brazil, the main market index dived 4.2%, hammered by
concerns about a leftist candidate's gains in election polls,
postponements of some corporate bond issues and Wall Street losses,
traders said.</TE>

<HD>Firm Told to Stop E-Mail Offers of Motorola Pagers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Motorola Inc. said Thursday that a court ordered a Pasadena company
to stop harassing consumers with false promises of free Motorola
pagers.</LD>
<LD>   Motorola accused Paging America of "inundating" consumers with
unsolicited e-mails offering a free pager. The e-mails misled
consumers into thinking Paging America was affiliated with Motorola,
and people who responded either got nothing or pagers made by
competitors, according to a federal suit Motorola filed a year ago in
Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   The court order blocks Paging America from using Motorola
trademarks or misleading consumers, and requires it to pay Motorola
$100,000. Motorola also will get $100,000 for each future e-mail that
results in a contempt of court citation, under the terms of a consent
agreement with the principals of the company and its telemarketing
firm.</LD>
<TE>   Paging America also was ordered to turn over all advertisements to
Motorola so they could be destroyed, and to give Motorola the contact
information of consumers who responded to the fraudulent e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Winter, a principal for Paging America, and David Kluge,
principal of telemarketing company Alliance Direct Fulfillment &amp;
Telemarketing Inc., agreed to stop the spam e-mails, said Motorola
spokeswoman Josephine Posti.</TE>
<TE>   Paging America, owned by closely held Digital Wireless
Technologies Inc., never responded to the trademark infringement
lawsuit, so a default judgment was entered, Posti said.</TE>
<TE>   In the lawsuit, Motorola claimed it was getting complaints from
consumers who said they would not buy Motorola products because of
the advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Motorola shares Thursday fell 9 cents to $15.35 on the New York
Stock Exchange. News of the judgment was released before the opening
of Wall Street trading.</TE>

<HD>BP to Switch From MTBE to Ethanol</HD>
<DH>Energy: Experts say shift in fuel additives in California
could tighten supplies and raise prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BP, the largest gasoline supplier in California, said Thursday that
it will switch federally mandated fuel additives in the largest U.S.
gasoline market in a move industry experts have said could tighten
supplies and hike pump prices.</LD>
<LD>   BP said it would phase out cleaner-burning fuel additive MTBE, or
methyl tertiary butyl ether, in California gasoline by Dec. 31, and
has begun to sign contracts with several suppliers of the alternative
gasoline additive, ethanol.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis banned MTBE in 1999 amid mounting evidence the
chemical contaminated groundwater supplies. In March, however, Davis
postponed his original deadline for MTBE's phaseout by one year to
Dec. 31, 2003, citing fears of supply shortages and sharp price
spikes reminiscent of last year's electricity crisis.</LD>
<TE>   BP's announcement comes a day after a report in the U.S. Senate
cited the company as one of several oil firms under investigation for
deliberately withholding supply to profit from higher retail prices,
particularly in key markets such as California and Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Federal clean air laws require the use of either ethanol or MTBE
as an oxygen-enhancing agent to help gasoline burn cleaner in a third
of the nation's gasoline supply.</TE>
<TE>   "We considered all of the factors within our control and
determined that we could transition from MTBE to ethanol early," said
Bob Malone, BP's regional president.</TE>
<TE>   Agricultural giant Archer Daniels Midland Co., the largest
producer of ethanol, pushed for other refiners to follow BP's move.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope other refiners move sooner rather than later to replace
MTBE with ethanol despite the one-year extension of the ban," said
Larry Cunningham, the company's senior vice president of corporate
affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "There are strong environmental and economic reasons for refiners
to go ahead and make that move."</TE>
<TE>   MTBE producers, however, criticized BP's move as financially
motivated and noted studies commissioned by the California Energy
Commission that pointed to a 5% to 10% shortfall in the state's
ultra-clean gasoline supply if Davis had stuck with his original 2002
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "This shift to ethanol by BP is an outrageously transparent move
designed to raise gas prices in California by tightening gasoline
supplies," said Ryan Knoll, spokesman for Lyondell Chemical Co., the
world's largest producer of MTBE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Oakley Inc. said it settled patent infringement lawsuits against Nike
Inc. over sunglasses. Financial terms weren't disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Sunglass maker Oakley sued Nike in 1997 and 2001, accusing the
world's largest maker of athletic shoes of infringing patents for XYZ
Optics and lens coatings. Oakley uses the patented technology in its
X Metal line of glasses. Nike filed a countersuit, claiming unfair
competition. Both denied wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   Under the agreement, the two companies agreed to continue
competing. Oakley will sell under the XYZ Optics name and Nike will
sell sunglasses with its Max Lens Technology, which the two sides
agree don't use features covered by Oakley patents.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Oakley fell 10 cents to $19.89, while Nike shares rose
55 cents to $55.23, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley, based in Foothill Ranch, reported $429.3 million in sales
last year, primarily from sunglasses. Beaverton, Ore.-based Nike
reported sales of $7.21 billion for the nine months ended Feb. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the two companies were not immediately available
for comment.</TE>

<HD>Near-Retirees Don't Have Enough Saved</HD>
<DH>Pensions: Study's surprising conclusion is that most older
workers lost ground during the 1990s economic boom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Despite the longest period of economic prosperity in American
history, most older workers are less well-provisioned for retirement
than they were when the growth began, according to a study released
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The study, by New York University economist Edward N. Wolff,
concludes that more than 40% of households headed by workers nearing
retirement--those 47 to 64 years old--don't have enough to replace
even half their pre-retirement income, up from less than 30% in the
1980s. Nearly 20% don't have enough to keep themselves above the
poverty line.</LD>
<LD>   Most experts say people need to replace 75% to 80% of
pre-retirement income to live comfortably after quitting work.</LD>
<TE>   "We thought near-retirees would be far ahead of their
predecessors" because of rising incomes and stock market gains, Wolff
said. Instead, he said, "what we found is that most people had lost
ground in the 1990s."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Economic Policy Institute, the labor-backed
think tank that sponsored the study, said Wolff's findings prove that
Washington should resist conservative calls for privatizing Social
Security and find ways to revive traditional, company-run pension
plans as an alternative to individually controlled 401(k)s.</TE>
<TE>   "The way we now go about providing for retirement just isn't
working for middle- and low-income Americans," said Jeff Faux, the
EPI's president. "It's time to stop talking about shifting Social
Security money to private accounts and start talking about how we can
make sure that working Americans will have adequate pensions that
will enable them to live decently in retirement."</TE>
<TE>   However, a close look at Wolff's study suggests that it offers as
much ammunition to proponents of individual accounts and
privatization as it does to opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, it traces many of middle Americans' retirement
troubles to an erosion of Social Security and traditional pension
wealth during the 1980s and 1990s and suggests that the decline would
have been even greater had it not been offset by immense gains in
401(k) wealth.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure this study proves all the things its author thinks
it proves," said Andrew G. Biggs, an analyst with the libertarian
Cato Institute in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the political spin, Wolff's conclusions contradict the
conventional wisdom that a large fraction of Americans in the middle
and upper range of the nation's economic pile are better prepared for
retirement because of the boom of the 1980s and 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   They seem likely to feed worries spurred by the stock crash, a
recession and corporate debacles such as that of Enron Corp. that the
good times of the 1990s may not have been quite as good--nor their
benefits quite as enduring--as many thought only a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, there's something going on here that reflects a growing
financial anxiety among the middle class," Faux said.</TE>
<TE>   Wolff based his study on the Federal Reserve's every-three-years
Survey of Consumer Finances, which provides the most comprehensive
look available at the wealth--including retirement wealth--of
American households.</TE>
<TE>   Among his findings:</TE>
<TE>   * From 1989 to 1998, the last year he examined, the share of
households whose projected retirement income is less than half their
pre-retirement income rose from 29.9% to 42.5%. The news is even
worse for African American and Latino households, which saw an
increase to 52.7%.</TE>
<TE>   * For households at the median or the middle of the nation's
economic pile, overall retirement wealth declined by 11% from 1983 to
1998.</TE>
<TE>   * Only the very richest of near-retirees, those with a net worth
of $1 million or more, saw their retirement wealth increase in that
period. All other groups--even those with net worth between $500,000
and $1 million--saw a decline.</TE>
<TE>   * The share of near-retirement households with non-Social Security
retirement coverage climbed only 3.5 percentage points to 73.7%
despite the proliferation of 401(k) plans. At least in part, that was
because many people covered by traditional pensions at the start of
the period traded their coverage for individual accounts.</TE>
<TE>   * In what Wolff and EPI officials portrayed as the one bright spot
in the retirement landscape, Social Security coverage became
virtually universal, rising from 82.4% in 1983 to 98.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Wolff said though 1998 was the last year he examined, his findings
still are applicable. That's because stock gains in 1999 and early
2000 largely have been erased.</TE>

<LD>Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Europe's largest oil producer, said
first-quarter profit fell 42%, less than that of its chief rivals, as
energy prices dropped and margins from making and selling gasoline
collapsed.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell to $2.26 billion from $3.89 billion a year
earlier. First-quarter profit slid 58% at Exxon Mobil Corp. and 57%
at BP.</LD>
<LD>   Royal Dutch/Shell said that excluding one-time items and the
effect of changes in the value of inventories, profit fell to $1.99

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tesoro Petroleum Corp. shares plunged 30% to an eight-year low
because the company may not complete a $1.13-billion purchase of a
California refinery from Valero Energy Inc. amid falling earnings and
rising debt.</LD>
<LD>   The stock fell $3.11 to $7.25 on the NYSE. Valero, one of the
largest U.S. refiners, dropped $1.79 to $41.80, also on the NYSE.
Both companies are based in San Antonio.</LD>
<LD>   Tesoro reported a $55.6-million first-quarter loss Wednesday,
which may leave it with too high a ratio of debt to earnings under
one of its lending covenants.</LD>
<TE>   Valero agreed to sell the Golden Eagle refinery near San Francisco
to win regulatory approval of its $5.45-billion purchase of Ultramar
Diamond Shamrock.</TE>

<LD>Fannie Mae said it no longer would take an active role in shaping
state legislation on predatory lending after some housing advocates
said the largest buyer of mortgages was seeking exemptions from the
laws.</LD>
<LD>   "We will monitor anti-predatory lending legislative efforts at the
state level, but will not take an active role in shaping such
legislation," the government-sponsored enterprise said.</LD>
<LD>   The statement followed the offer of legislation by Senate Banking
Committee Chairman Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) to prevent the growth of
predatory mortgage lending. Sarbanes said he had some concerns about
Fannie Mae after it was reported that the company asked to be
exempted from predatory lending laws in California and Georgia.</LD>

<LD>A Microsoft Corp. executive presented a plan in 1999 to conquer the
market for audio and video delivery over the Internet using a tactic
already employed to fend off a rival Internet browser, a federal
judge was told.</LD>
<LD>   Nine states seeking stiff antitrust sanctions against the software
giant cited a Jan. 3, 1999, e-mail to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates
outlining a plan to use the Windows operating system to promote
Microsoft's Netshow media-streaming software over that offered by
RealNetworks Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Will Poole, a vice president in charge of Microsoft's Windows New
Media Platform Division, testified in U.S. District Court that he was
unsure whether the strategy was ever adopted.</LD>
<TE>   Later in 1999, Microsoft integrated Netshow into the media player
that is bundled into every copy of Windows.</TE>

<LD>Kmart Corp., the biggest U.S. retailer to seek bankruptcy protection,
may ask former Chief Executive Chuck Conaway and other executives who
have left the company to repay millions of dollars in loans.</LD>
<LD>   The company is investigating the executives' contracts to see
whether the circumstances of their departures make the loans
forgivable, Kmart attorney Jack Butler said at a meeting with
creditors. Kmart also has suspended severance payments to some
managers.</LD>
<LD>   "For every dollar that's not spent, it's money that can be used to
satisfy legitimate debt," said Charles Tatelbaum, an attorney
representing some of Kmart's suppliers.</LD>
<TE>   The discount retailer made more than $30 million in loans to 63
executives in the year before it filed Chapter 11, court papers show.</TE>

<HD>$16 Billion Found in Dubious Deductions</HD>
<DH>Taxes: The IRS also received information on shelter
promoters from 577 taxpayers who came forward during four-month
voluntary disclosure program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The government's effort to encourage taxpayers who use questionable
tax shelters to come forward has uncovered $16 billion in dubious
deductions, as well as information about people who promote the
abusive shelters, IRS officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The IRS, which launched the four-month tax shelter disclosure
program in December, said 577 individual and corporate taxpayers had
come forward. The claimed losses and deductions in these disclosures
totaled $16 billion--an amount that probably would result in an
assessment of $5.6 billion in tax.</LD>
<LD>   But that may understate the impact of the program, said IRS
spokesman Ken Hubinak. The $16-billion figure excludes shelters that
were disclosed without deduction or loss figures estimated by the
taxpayer, he said. When those are tallied, the total probably will
soar.</LD>
<TE>   The disclosure program, which ran from late December to last week,
waives underpayment penalties that can boost tax assessments by as
much as 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers, in turn, were required to voluntarily turn over
documents related to the shelters they used and provide information
about the promoters who sold them.</TE>
<TE>   "We have agreed to work with these taxpayers to resolve their
concerns as quickly and efficiently as possible," said Larry Langdon,
IRS commissioner of large and mid-size business. "At the same time,
we are beginning to go after the tax shelter promoters identified in
these documents."</TE>
<TE>   Once those leads are followed, the agency may uncover billions
more in unpaid taxes, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are trying to identify promoters, because once you get the
promoter, you can subpoena their client list," said Wayne McEwan, an
investigative consultant who previously ran the IRS' criminal
investigation division in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Not all tax shelters are illegal. But the government loses
billions of dollars in revenue a year because of complex,
questionable tax avoidance schemes aggressively marketed by
accounting and law firms to companies and wealthy people.</TE>
<TE>   The agency recently has won several battles in its war on tax
shelters--including getting credit card companies to disclose
information about owners of offshore accounts--that are nearly
certain to result in future criminal and civil tax cases and possibly
deter future cheating.</TE>
<TE>   The penalty waiver program was meant to bolster an existing IRS
registration program for tax shelters. It was aimed at taxpayers who
were worried that their arrangements might be illegal but were afraid
to come forward.</TE>

<LD>R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. was ordered by a judge to pay a
$14.8-million fine for handing out free packs of cigarettes at an
event where kids were present, California's attorney general said.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Conrad Aragon's fine is
the largest against a tobacco company for violating California's law
banning tobacco product giveaways on public grounds where minors
might be in attendance, according to Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer's
office. R.J. Reynolds said it would appeal the ruling.</LD>
<LD>   The tobacco firm said it leased space to set up enclosed booths at
events that were restricted to people age 21 and over who presented
identification to security guards. Reynolds also claims the state was
aware of the promotion at the time.</LD>
<TE>   The tobacco company's shares, which hit a 52-week high of $71.82
on Thursday, rose $1.05 to $71.35 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. said a pact to provide as much as $450 million of data
services to the Defense Department has been stalled by protests from
the company's two biggest rivals, AT&amp;T Corp. and Sprint Corp. The
second-biggest U.S. long-distance phone company said last month that
it had beaten AT&amp;T, its biggest competitor, and No. 3 Sprint to
connect the offices of 6,000 scientists and engineers for 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   AT&amp;T declined to say why it objected; Sprint said its proposal
wasn't fairly evaluated. A Defense Department official said the
dispute will be resolved by July 22. The contract originally was
awarded to Global Crossing Ltd., but the government revoked it over
the firm's financial troubles.</LD>

<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. will change its ticker symbol Monday to HPQ from

Trading of Compaq common stock will be suspended before the market

<LD>   HP said a final, certified vote count showed it won shareholder
approval to buy Compaq, clearing the last hurdle to completing the
deal. Palo Alto-based HP expects to close the purchase today and
start combined operations Tuesday after six months of fighting
dissident former director Walter Hewlett.</LD>
<LD>   Also, Moody's Investors Service said it was reviewing for
potential downgrade its ratings on $6.4 billion in HP debt, citing
the risk of the firm's purchase of Compaq. Moody's is reviewing

<HD>Micron Withdraws From Talks to Buy Hynix</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Micron Technology Inc. said it has formally withdrawn from talks to
acquire Hynix Semiconductor Inc. assets despite continued interest in
a deal from the South Korean company's creditors. The announcement
came two days after the collapse of a multibillion-dollar deal for
Hynix memory chip operations that would have made Boise, Idaho-based
Micron the world's largest memory chip producer, with 40% of the
global market. Samsung Electronics Inc. is the world's biggest memory
chip maker, with 28% of the market.</LD>
<LD>   The directors of Hynix, the world's third-largest producer,
rejected the offer from Micron, the No. 2 chip maker, even though
Hynix's creditors had endorsed it. The directors said the offer of
108.6 million shares of Micron for their memory chip operations was
inadequate. At the time of their decision, the Micron stock was worth
just under $2.9 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Micron shares fell $1.34 to $23.36 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of six private investment groups are planning an initial
joint offer of up to $8 billion for Qwest Communications
International Inc.'s telephone directory business in a preemptive
strike that could significantly narrow the list of potential bidders,
sources close to the situation said.</LD>
<LD>   The creation of a such a powerful alliance has caused a stir among
some of the other large bidders, which have initiated talks with each
other and major financial institutions about forming their own
coalitions, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Denver-based Qwest, which is selling its massive phone-book
business to raise additional capital amid a prolonged industry slump,
officially put the unit on the auction block two weeks ago, hoping to
raise up to $10 billion.</LD>

<HD>Class-Action Status Rejected for Ford, Firestone Claims</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court Thursday overturned a ruling granting
class-action status to millions of product liability claims involving
Ford Motor Co. and Bridgestone Corp.'s Firestone unit, saying a
single trial would be unmanageable.</LD>
<LD>   The product liability claims involve Ford's Explorer sport utility
vehicle and Firestone's Wilderness tires and do not involve any
injuries. The ruling does not affect hundreds of personal injury
lawsuits against the companies that are pending across the country.</LD>
<LD>   Federal regulators have linked rollover accidents involving Ford
Explorers and Firestone tires to about 271 deaths and more than 800
injuries.</LD>
<TE>   The decision means that more than 3 million owners of Ford
Explorers made between 1991 and 2001 and 15 million Firestone tire
owners would have to file individual cases instead of joining a
consolidated case.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago agreed with the
companies' arguments that a single trial on the product liability
claims would be unmanageable given the various state laws and
circumstances involved.</TE>
<TE>   The decision reverses a ruling made in November by District Judge
Sarah Evans Barker of Indianapolis to form two classes, one class for
the buyers of Ford Explorers and one for buyers of the Firestone
Wilderness tires.</TE>
<TE>   The companies applauded the decision and noted that the appellate
judges recognized that most of the tires had been recalled by Ford
and Firestone and that the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration had investigated the safety of the tires and the
Explorers and did not find any additional action to be warranted.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys representing consumers said they are examining all of
their options, including a possible appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "The battle's not over by a long shot," said Don Barrett, lead
counsel for the plaintiffs' class-action cases pending before Barker
in Indianapolis. He said a task force is being formed that would take
the cases to various state courts.</TE>
<TE>   "Firestone made a terrible tire, Ford made a terrible vehicle, and
they conspired together to hide it," Barrett said. "We will continue
seeking justice until we find it."</TE>

<HD>PwC Consulting Unit to Offer Stock</HD>
<DH>Investing: Move would separate business from its accounting
firm parent company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the nation's largest
accounting firm, filed papers Thursday for a stock offering that
would separate the consulting business from its parent company.</LD>
<LD>   The offering, announced in January, is aimed at freeing the
consulting unit from new federal rules that restrict the kinds of
services that accounting firms can provide to the companies whose
books they audit.</LD>
<LD>   The rules, imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, are
intended to eliminate any real or perceived conflicts of interest
between accounting firms and their audit clients. Arthur Andersen,
which audited Enron Corp.'s books for years, has been indicted for
destroying Enron documents after the energy giant's financial
troubles deepened.</LD>
<TE>   Other accounting firms also are taking steps to separate their
consulting businesses from their audit practices. Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu said it would split those business groups, and KPMG
Consulting, which had split from its former parent company KPMG, is
planning to change its name to reinforce the separation.</TE>
<TE>   The PricewaterhouseCoopers unit's stock offering, which probably
would come in mid-August, would raise at least $1 billion. Brokerage
Morgan Stanley will handle the offering, and the stock is expected to
list on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   PricewaterhouseCoopers' consulting business filed the registration
papers under the name PwCC Ltd. but said in the filing that it would
change its name before the offering.</TE>
<TE>   In the filing, PwCC said its business was being hurt by clients'
concerns about running afoul of the new federal rules on auditor
independence. PwCC said its average monthly booking from clients that
also were audit clients of PricewaterhouseCoopers declined by about
57% in the quarter ended March 31 compared with the average monthly
amounts in the last half of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   PwCC had $424 million of income, before distributions to partners,
in the year ended June 2001, a 30% decline from the previous year.
Revenue was $7.5 billion, up 5% for the year, compared with a 15%
rise the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   "The business has a boom-and-bust nature," said Marshall Cooper,
president of Kennedy Information, a research firm that follows the
consultant business.</TE>
<TE>   Bermuda-based PwCC has 32,000 employees worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Briefly</TE>
<TE>   Rates earned on U.S. savings bonds are falling: The Treasury said
the annualized yield on Series EE bonds issued on or after May 1,
1997, was cut to 3.96%, down from 4.07%. The new rate will be in
effect through Oct. 30. The Treasury adjusts the rate twice a year,
Nov. 1 and May 1, based on market interest rates.</TE>

<LD>Ira Berkow of the New York Times interviewed Mike Tyson, who is
training in Wailea on Maui for his bout June 8 with Lennox Lewis:</LD>
<LD>   "[He] is in training in a gym not far from the Haleakala volcano,
which before Mike showed up was the lone volcano on this lush,
splendiferous island.</LD>
<LD>   "He spoke about his [older] brother, Rodney, who is an assistant
to a brain surgeon in California: 'We took two different paths in
life. I scramble people's brains and he fixes 'em.'"</LD>

throws made?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two of a kind: U.S. Amateur golf champion Bubba Dickerson, on
playing two rounds with Tiger Woods at the Masters: "I learned that
he's real patient and he manages his game real well, and he just
makes a lot of putts. Other than those three things, he didn't do
anything better than me all week."</TE>

Johnson pitched a two-hitter against them recently, striking out 17?</TE>
<TE>   "If they wanted to save time and shorten the game," Rick Donnelly,
former Rockies' coach told ESPN.com, "they could have dragged the
infield when he was out there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why, oh why? Dan Le Batard of the Miami Herald has some questions,
but no answers. A sampling:</TE>
<TE>   * "Why, after the third out of an inning, does a first baseman, no
matter who he is, take out the ball and stare at it like the
to-be-or-not-to-be skull in 'Hamlet,' as if this were his very first
time seeing a thing as magnificent and interesting as a baseball?"</TE>
<TE>   * "Why do tennis players stare at their rackets and fiddle with
the strings after missing shots?"</TE>
<TE>   * "Why incessant spitting and crotch adjusting the exclusive
domain of baseball players?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth: Sports Illustrated listed five college
football teams on the rise and five on the decline. The No. 1 team on
the rise? USC. The No. 5 team on the decline? UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ZZZZ: Prisoners with records of good behavior in Bangkok,
Thailand, will be permitted to watch televised World Cup soccer
games.</TE>
<TE>   "Allowing model inmates to watch live broadcasts is one measure to
make them relax and decrease stress," said a prison official.</TE>
<TE>   Makes sense. Watching 0-0 ties is better than a sleeping pill.</TE>

<TE>   Showtime: Jeff Gordon in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: "So Anna

<LD>The California Interscholastic Federation's federated council will
vote today on a transfer proposal that aims to curtail recruiting.</LD>
<LD>   The statewide proposal would require school officials to certify
that no one connected with their booster clubs or athletic programs
had contact with transfers. The proposal, which would require school
officials and parents to sign a pre-enrollment contact form, would go
into effect on a two-year trial basis starting with the 2002-03
school year.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives from the Southern Section, who compose 28% of the
state's voting membership, decided at a section council meeting to
support the proposal.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Gregory, the only boys' basketball coach in Ayala High history,
has resigned, ending a 12-year run marked by 10 consecutive 20-win
seasons and quarterfinal appearances in the Southern Section
playoffs. Gregory notched his 400th career victory during the 2001-02
season as the Bulldogs won their sixth Sierra League title in seven
years.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm definitely not going to coach for a year," Gregory said.
"That's the pep talk I gave myself when I decided to leave Ayala."</LD>
<LD>   Gregory has been slowed by his recovery from off-season hip
replacement surgery and said he wants to spend more time with his
family.</LD>
<TE>   Gregory's Ayala teams had a 253-75 record. He also coached 11
years at Anaheim Savanna High. His career record is 407-179.</TE>

<LD>Freshman Jessica Stewart of Alverno on Wednesday became the seventh
pitcher in Southern Section softball history to strike out 21 batters
in a seven-inning game.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart pitched a perfect game, striking out every batter in a
14-0 victory over Bishop Conaty Loretto to help Alverno (16-3, 9-0)
clinch a share of the Horizon League title. The record for strikeouts
in a seven-inning game is 22, set by Brenda Selvey of Chaffey in
1983.</LD>

<HD>This Would Take Tennis Straight to the Penthouse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is it or isn't it Anna Kournikova, partially naked, in that Penthouse
spread?</LD>
<LD>   And how about that juicy dust-up between Jennifer Capriati and
Billie Jean King over practicing with--of all things--the Fed Cup
team, the lesser-known women's version of Davis Cup? As if anything
could be less known to the American sporting public than Davis Cup.
Jennifer reportedly said bad words to Billie Jean. There was a fight.
Jennifer was removed from the team. The U.S. lost.</LD>
<LD>   These two incidents have gotten women more attention in the
sporting media than any recent athletic achievement. The majority
male press, let's face it, much prefers a scantily-clad vamp or a cat
fight to accomplishment.</LD>
<TE>   But Venus and Serena Williams could change all that.</TE>
<TE>   The tennis-playing sisters could make worldwide waves and a
statement about female athletes if only they would accept the
challenge from the tennis-playing McEnroe brothers, John and Patrick.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of this grudge match seems to have been John's, of
course. John McEnroe loves to talk trash about women's tennis and in
some part of his chatter on television, Johnny Mac said he'd like to
take on the sisters with the help of his brother. Venus and Serena
have never been shrinking violets when it comes to their own talents
either.</TE>
<TE>   But this time the women seem to be backing away from
confrontation. A $45-million lawsuit has been filed by
representatives of the McEnroe brothers who say there is a contract
signed by Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena, agreeing to
this match.</TE>
<TE>   Keven Davis, legal counsel for the sisters, says it doesn't matter
what Richard signs, only what Venus and Serena sign. And Venus and
Serena have signed nothing, Davis says.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, this would be wonderful news, an indication the sisters
are distancing themselves from Richard, who too often puts his
daughters in a bad light with rash statements, careless denigrations
and off-the-wall pronouncements.</TE>
<TE>   But for once, even if it's the last time, the sisters should
listen to their father.</TE>
<TE>   Venus and Serena should most definitely play John and Pat.</TE>
<TE>   Because the sisters just might win. Really.</TE>
<TE>   Venus and Serena are athletes. They are strong, aggressive, quick
athletes who can cover the court. They don't have girl serves. Venus
and Serena consistently serve more than 100 mph. They can be
fearless. They can hit 10 balls into the stands but the 11th will be
a winner from an impossible angle or from off the court. They hit
their ground strokes hard, as hard as some men, as hard as many men
who played when John was in his prime. John and Pat won't be able to
sit and wait on too many powder puff balls.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, John is the best doubles player in history. He might be
43, but he was never one to overwork himself. His soft hands, the
best ever, were God-given. His reflexes might be slower, but he will
still be able to volley far better than anyone Venus and Serena have
played.</TE>
<TE>   And Patrick, 35, is not that far from his prime. He can still hit
a hard ground stroke and a rough serve.</TE>
<TE>   This is not an argument that women are better athletes than men,
after all. The best men will always be stronger, quicker, faster than
the best women.</TE>
<TE>   But this isn't between the best men and women. It's between the
best women and men who used to be the best. A decade or more ago.</TE>
<TE>   This proposed matchup would be one of the most-watched sporting
events ever. It would offer everything today's sports fan seems to
love. Sex, race, drama, controversial characters (John, Richard
Williams) and something we've never seen before. There has never been
anything like it.</TE>
<TE>   When King played Bobby Riggs, Riggs was way too old, a survivor of
cancer and a hard-lived life. King was in her athletic prime. And
still the match was huge.</TE>
<TE>   Even the news of the lawsuit last week had the goofballs on Fox's
"Best Damn Sports Show Period" devoting significant time analyzing
the match. Seriously. They didn't dissect the bodies of Venus and
Serena, only their serves and volleys.</TE>
<TE>   That is breathtaking progress and a real compliment to Venus and
Serena.</TE>
<TE>   Venus and Serena would earn themselves a ton of respect by playing
this match. They'd have the guts to put themselves on the line.
Sports isn't about women playing men. That will turn out one way 99%
of the time. But sports is about the challenge, and this would be a
great challenge for the sisters.</TE>
<TE>   And it would be a great match for tennis. The outcome would be
furiously debated. The TV and talk radio coverage would be nonstop.
There would be rooting interest for old white guys and young
African-American girls and every demographic in between. It would be
the opposite of the "Hear Me Roar" women's lib exhibition that the
King-Riggs match was.</TE>
<TE>   This would be real, athletic competition. Made for television,
yes, but made for much, much more.</TE>

<CX>   Tennis-A column in Friday's sports section incorrectly stated that
representatives of John and Patrick McEnroe had filed a $45-million
lawsuit against Venus and Serena Williams over a proposed doubles match
between the famous tennis siblings. In fact, the suit was filed in Palm
Beach (Fla.) Circuit Court by Women's Sports Zone Inc., a company with
which the McEnroes have no affiliation, according to a representative of
John McEnroe.</CX>

<HD>Number of Border Detainees Declines</HD>
<DH>Security: Officials credit tougher post-Sept. 11 measures
for decreasing illegal crossings. But drug seizures have risen, they
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Immigration officials credit tougher security measures since Sept. 11
for a sharp drop in the number of people detained trying to cross the
U.S.- Mexico border in the past seven months.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, the number of drugs seized along the Southwest border rose
significantly in the same period, as drug traffickers tried to move
contraband that had accumulated in the weeks after the terrorist
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   From Oct. 1 to April 28, the Border Patrol caught 518,812 people
trying to cross the 2,000-mile border that stretches between
California and Texas, according to figures released by the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service.</LD>
<TE>   That is a 34% drop from the same period last year, when 786,099
were caught, the largest decline in eight years.</TE>
<TE>   While the figures may include multiple attempts by the same
person, apprehensions are viewed as the best measure of how many
people try to enter the country illegally.</TE>
<TE>   That number has been decreasing since the end of 2000, the year
that arrests for illegal immigration on the Southwest border hit a
record high of 1.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   INS officials said the decline that followed was due to a
combination of factors, including more border enforcement, an
economic downturn in the United States and optimism in Mexico after
the election of President Vicente Fox.</TE>
<TE>   The number of people attempting to cross illegally dropped even
more dramatically after Sept. 11, when Border Patrol agents increased
their presence and officials more thoroughly scrutinized people at
border crossings.</TE>
<TE>   "The conventional wisdom for so long has been that greater
enforcement doesn't work, and I think this post-9/11 effort is
challenging that," said Alan Kessler, a visiting scholar at the
Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at UC San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   However, tighter border security since the terrorism attacks has
merely delayed drug smuggling, not stopped it. Narcotics seizures
dropped in the first few weeks after the attacks, then shot up in the
months that followed.</TE>
<TE>   Customs officials seized 16,570 pounds of cocaine along the border
in the last six months, almost twice as much as in the same period
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Marijuana seizures are up 12%. And in California, officials
captured 199 pounds of heroin, more than six times the amount seized
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials believe that the boost in seizures is being caused
by a backlog of drug shipments that accumulated in the weeks after
the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of reluctance to move drugs because of the
scrutiny on the border," said Donald Thornhill Jr., a spokesman for
the Drug Enforcement Administration in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "But if [the drug smugglers] don't make money, they can't pay
their sources," he said. "They're playing catch-up."</TE>
<TE>   And with the tighter security measures, more drugs are being
discovered.</TE>
<TE>   "Since we've gone to the highest level of alert, we have had much
more intensified inspections of people and cargo," said Jay Ahern,
who directs Customs field operations in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike drug traffickers, undocumented migrants apparently remain
discouraged by the increased border security.</TE>
<TE>   Apprehensions crept back up after an initial plunge in October and
November, but the number of people being detained remains far below
the levels before the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego County, the number of undocumented immigrants caught
using false documents or hiding in vehicles at the three border
crossings in the last seven months fell to 11,929, a 66% decline from
the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   The beefed-up security is most noticeable in San Ysidro, the
busiest border crossing in the world, where cars and pedestrians now
idle in long lines as they wait to cross.</TE>
<TE>   Between 30% and 50% of vehicles are now physically searched, up
from less than 1% before the attacks, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, all pedestrians must show photo identification to get
into the country, and inspectors run more names through a criminal
database.</TE>
<TE>   Unarmed National Guard troops are on hand to assist the efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "We know our effectiveness increases with length of the
inspection," said Adele J. Fasano, director of the INS' San Diego
office.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always a balance between the wait time and security, and the
balance has shifted to security after Sept. 11," Fasano said.</TE>

<LD>Susan and Jeffrey Markowitz of West Hills will be paid nearly
$350,000 in settlements from the parents of their son's alleged
killers and others who they say failed to save his life, court
documents show. A total of 14 defendants, including the Los Angeles
Police Department, contributed to the deal, according to the
documents.</LD>
<LD>   Nicholas Markowitz, 15, was kidnapped Aug. 6, 2000, and shot two
days later at a campsite near Santa Barbara, allegedly because his
half-brother owed a drug debt.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit claimed that the owners of homes where Nicholas was
held and of cars used to transport him were negligent for failing to
help their son.</LD>

<LD>A Simi Valley woman and her teenage daughter were ordered Thursday to
stand trial on charges of attempted murder, arson and assault with a
deadly weapon for allegedly trying to burn and beat the woman's
husband to death.</LD>
<LD>   Eileen Childs, 37, and Jennifer Childs, 19, were arrested after a
March 25 attack in which Larry Childs' bedroom was set on fire and he
was hit on the head with a baseball bat.</LD>
<LD>   The women told police they were defending themselves after
55-year-old Larry Childs grabbed them by the hair during the chaos
that ensued when the family's house caught fire.</LD>
<TE>   After a preliminary hearing, Superior Court Judge Colleen Toy
White found there was sufficient evidence to order the women to stand
trial on the felony charges and related allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen Childs was also ordered to stand trial on a charge of
felony grand theft for allegedly stealing $132,000 from her husband
by forging his signature on an insurance check.</TE>

<HD>Harbor, Chinese Port in Accord</HD>
<DH>Trade: Port of Hueneme officials sign 'friendly exchange'
with Qinhuangdao, which may boost the amount of citrus from county
farms exported overseas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Port of Hueneme, the nation's chief gateway for citrus exports,
has signed its first agreement with a Chinese port, a move officials
say could boost Ventura County's $1-billion agriculture
industry--with an emphasis on citrus.</LD>
<LD>   The Oxnard Harbor District, which operates the port, announced a
"friendly exchange" agreement with the Port of Qinhuangdao on
Thursday, days after harbor district officials returned from a
diplomatic mission to China.</LD>
<LD>   Like other U.S. businesses, Ventura County's commercial port has
been eager to take advantage of China's acceptance into the World
Trade Organization late last year, which means drastic reductions on
tariffs and bans being lifted on agricultural products.</LD>
<TE>   The sister port agreement requires formal approval by the Chinese
government, expected by midsummer. A delegation from China is
scheduled to visit the Port of Hueneme next month.</TE>
<TE>   The tentative agreement calls for the two ports to exchange market
research and technology. While it does not include specific purchase
arrangements between the Chinese port and local growers, Port of
Hueneme officials said they hope to export fruit to Qinhuangdao by
the end of next year. Goods, they said, would flow mostly from Port
Hueneme to China, not the other way.</TE>
<TE>   "This agreement is an important first step toward trade with China
from the Port of Hueneme," Harbor Commissioner Jess Herrera said.
"It's a tremendous opportunity for us."</TE>
<TE>   Coal is the chief export of Qinhuangdao, which is 200 miles east
of Beijing. Qinhuangdao officials said their city is the entry point
for 60% of northern China's bananas and that they want to purchase
refrigeration sheds similar to the ones at the Port of Hueneme to
accommodate more shipments of perishable items.</TE>
<TE>   Sunkist already exports some citrus to Hong Kong and to mainland
China, but not directly to the region served by the Qinhuangdao port,
officials said. Sunkist officials could not be reached Thursday for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Strawberries are considered too perishable for export. Avocados
are so unusual in Qinhuangdao that none of the port officials that
met with the Oxnard delegation had ever eaten one, said Port of
Hueneme marketing director Will Berg.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said it was too soon to estimate how much money the
agreement with Qinhuangdao might yield for the Port of Hueneme or its
customers. Last year, the Port of Hueneme--one of California's
smallest commercial ports--reported gross revenues of $8.3 million,
mostly from handling $4 billion worth of imports, including
automobiles and Del Monte bananas.</TE>
<TE>   Citrus exports represented $400,000 of port revenues last year.
Sunkist exports 250,000 boxes of citrus to Japan each week through
the port. Port officials said they expected the market for northern
China would eventually be larger than that.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a burgeoning middle-class population that is willing to
pay premium prices for first-class fruit," Bob Pinkerton, a Santa
Paula lemon grower, said of China. "If this opens up another port of
entry there, we surely welcome that."</TE>

<HD>Senate Extends Ban on Human Cloning, OKs Stem Cell Research</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The state Senate agreed Thursday to make permanent California's
5-year-old prohibition on the cloning of human beings and research
into "reproductive" cloning of people.</LD>
<LD>   But opponents of Senate Bill 1230 by Sen. Dede Alpert (D-San
Diego) complained that it failed to outlaw cloning for research into
development of medications that may prevent cancer, Parkinson's
disease and other severe illnesses.</LD>
<LD>   On a virtually party-line vote, Democrats prevailed over
Republicans, 22 to 5, and passed the bill to the Assembly.</LD>
<TE>   Only Republican Sen. Jim Battin of La Quinta broke ranks and voted
with Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Senate approved and sent to the Assembly another bill
(SB 1272) by Sen. Deborah Ortiz (D-Sacramento) that specifically
would permit medical research using human embryonic stem cells. The
party-line vote was 21 to 10, one more than the two-thirds majority
required.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, California became the first state to adopt a moratorium
on cloning for "reproductive purposes."</TE>
<TE>   The measure outlawed cloning cells that produced another human
being or doing research with the intent of creating a second person.</TE>
<TE>   The moratorium was to expire next Jan. 1. Instead, the bill would
make the prohibition permanent.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was silent on the issue of using stem cells from human
embryos for "therapeutic" or medical research.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Sen. Ray Haynes of Riverside, an opponent of abortion,
said the legislation should ban all cloning research without any
exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a cloning ban at all," Haynes said of Alpert's plan.
"The bill says some cloning is banned and some is not.... In order to
do the [medical] research, you've got to kill a fetus."</TE>
<TE>   Haynes tried to amend an airtight prohibition of any form of
cloning for any purpose, including medical research. Majority
Democrats scuttled his amendment, 20 to 12.</TE>
<TE>   But Battin, a coauthor of the original moratorium bill, said he
mistakenly believed five years ago that "we were banning all
cloning." He said in spite of promising research into preventing and
curing diseases, California may need to prohibit all cloning.</TE>

<HD>Fair Looks to Big Weekend</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Along with the ongoing carnival, a highlight of
annual Conejo Valley Days is Saturday's parade on Thousand Oaks
Boulevard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Conejo Valley Days has been a family tradition for as long as Teri
Hamilton can remember. Now that she is a mother, Hamilton and her
husband look forward to sharing the fun with their children.</LD>
<LD>   ''When we were growing up, it was all about socialization and
hanging out with your friends,'' the Thousand Oaks mother said.
''It's no different now. I bump into people I know [at the carnival]
and I've seen friends I haven't seen in years.''</LD>
<LD>   As Hamilton reminisced about Conejo Valley Days long past,
Brittany, 3, and Brandon, 5, were all smiles while enjoying a ride
featuring ladybug-shaped cars.</LD>
<TE>   ''This is so much fun for them,'' Hamilton said. ''I worry about
certain rides at the larger fairs and this one has quite a few rides
that are good for their age.''</TE>
<TE>   The Hamiltons are among the thousands of people expected at the
five-day carnival that runs through Sunday at Conejo Creek Park South
in Thousand Oaks. Last year, more than 50,000 attended the
Western-themed event, which is mainly run by volunteers and benefits
local charities.</TE>
<TE>   ''I expect the numbers will go up this year, especially if the
weather heats up this weekend,'' said Scott Wolfe, the carnival's
on-site chairman responsible for making sure everything runs
smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   Conejo Valley Days, with rides, sports memorabilia and funnel
cakes, offers a little something for many tastes. Midway rides range
from favorites, such as a Ferris wheel and carousel, to Gravitron, a
sparkling gold spaceship that holds riders against the wall with
centrifugal force as it spins around.</TE>
<TE>   Gravitron left some riders barely able to walk straight and others
covering their mouths as they rushed to the nearest bathroom. But
hearty youngsters such as Heather Dormblum, 8, and Breanna Vergess,
10, of Thousand Oaks couldn't wait to try the next thrill ride.</TE>
<TE>   ''It made me a little dizzy, but it was really fun,'' Heather
said. Her friend Breanna added that the ride was a little scary
because she couldn't lift her hands while stuck to the wall, but she
was ready to go again. Heather's mom, Patti, said this is the fifth
consecutive year they have come to the event.</TE>
<TE>   To enhance the carnival atmosphere, a juggler on a unicycle, a
mariachi band and a ventriloquist travel around the park.</TE>
<TE>   For those looking for something different, there is the Baxter

<HD>Reworked Power Deal to Save State $71 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The state announced Thursday that it has renegotiated a $403-million
long-term electricity contract for a savings of $71 million.</LD>
<LD>   The changes to a 10-year contract with CalPeak Power cancel the
construction of one of seven small "peaker" power plants, which are
designed to run for short periods when electricity consumption rises.
State officials say the new contract also gives the state more
flexibility about when and how much power it must purchase.</LD>
<LD>   The CalPeak contract is one of dozens signed by the state
Department of Water Resources in the spring of 2001 when wholesale
electricity prices were roughly 10 times higher than today. Gov. Gray
Davis' administration has been working for months to restructure the
contracts with terms more favorable to the state.</LD>
<TE>   Three of the six peaker plants CalPeak must build under the
contract are already operating. Two more are expected to be finished
by June and the last is scheduled to begin working in June 2003.</TE>

<HD>Leader of Gang Found Guilty of Racketeering</HD>
<DH>Court: Patterning itself after an East Coast Mafia family,
drug-protection ring collected about $85,000 a week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The leader of a street gang that controlled narcotics trafficking
around Los Angeles' MacArthur Park was convicted along with two
associates Thursday on federal racketeering charges.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-one other members of the Columbia Lil' Cycos, a clique of
the 18th Street gang, previously pleaded guilty in the case, the
latest in a series of federal prosecutions against local gangs under
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.</LD>
<LD>   Until their indictment two years ago, the Lil' Cycos were
collecting about $85,000 a week in protection money from street-level
narcotics dealers in the neighborhood northeast of the park,
according to testimony in the six-week Los Angeles federal court
trial.</LD>
<TE>   Those who challenged their rule often paid with their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Attys. Luis Li and Bruce Riordan said the gang
tried to pattern itself after an East Coast Mafia family. Instead of
squandering their money, they spent much of it on suburban houses,
two restaurants, a juice parlor and a used car lot. Some of it
allegedly was sent to Mexico for safekeeping.</TE>
<TE>   The gang's leader, Francisco "Pancho Villa" Martinez, 38, ran the
enterprise from behind bars, issuing orders through his wife, Janie
Maria Garcia, 51. FBI agents seized about $450,000 in cash along with
thousands of dollars worth of jewelry when they raided her home in
Monterey Park. Garcia went to trial with her husband but after three
weeks pleaded guilty to racketeering charges.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, also a member of the prison-based Mexican Mafia, was
found guilty Thursday on 12 criminal counts involving racketeering,
murder, assault, narcotics distribution, money laundering and use of
a firearm during a violent crime.</TE>
<TE>   His chief enforcer, Anthony "Coco" Zaragoza, 29, of Maywood was
convicted on nine counts. They included three murders and three
murder conspiracies. Alberto "Nefty" Pina, 29, of Los Angeles,
described as a loyal soldier in the gang, was found guilty of
conspiring to commit racketeering and being a felon in possession of
a firearm.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office said all three are expected to receive
life prison terms when they are sentenced Aug. 5 by U.S. District
Judge Ronald S.W. Lew.</TE>
<TE>   Zaragoza, who has 18th Street gang logos tattooed on his cheek and
neck, was the only defendant to take the stand during the trial. He
admitted collecting about $5,000 a week in "rent" money from drug
dealers who operated on gang turf, but he denied taking part in any
murders.</TE>
<TE>   However, former Lil' Cycos member Juan "Termite" Romero, who was
the prosecution's star witness, testified that he and Zaragoza killed
gang member Carlos Alberto Lopez, known as "Truco," in September
1994. Also killed in the MacArthur Park attack was Donatella
Contreras, a companion of Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Romero said Martinez gave the order to kill Lopez for trying to
take over his territory on behalf of a rival Mexican Mafia member.
Contreras was killed "because she was in the same car as Truco,"
Romero testified.</TE>
<TE>   After the assassinations, Romero said, he rose rapidly in the
ranks. He said he became the most productive rent collector in the
organization, delivering about $40,000 a month to Martinez's wife and
pocketing about $8,000 for himself.</TE>
<TE>   In March 1999, the FBI raided the homes of Garcia and her
relatives, seizing the cash that she and Martinez were hoarding. Not
realizing that the search grew out of information gathered through
wiretaps, Garcia and Zaragoza began looking for an informer in the
ranks. Garcia openly speculated that it was Romero.</TE>
<TE>   Angered that he was being falsely accused, Romero wrote a letter
to Martinez saying it was obvious "you don't trust us any more and we
don't trust you. We're not going to let your family put us down. From
here on, we'll walk alone."</TE>
<TE>   Later that year, Martinez allegedly sent a letter from prison to a
gang member, saying it was time to "fumigate the Termite." Romero was
shot and seriously wounded, but not killed, outside the gang-owned
auto lot. Afterward, he agreed to talk to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The case against the Lil' Cycos follows three recent prosecutions
in Los Angeles federal court of members of the Mexican Mafia. Federal
authorities are preparing to go to trial later this year against
leaders of the Wah Ching, an Asian gang operating in the San Gabriel
Valley.</TE>

<LD>An El Toro airport will not be removed from regional transportation
blueprints, a planning board decided Thursday, because members said a
legal challenge could bring an airfield back to the table.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal to eliminate El Toro from the plan to handle an
expected increase in airline passengers was made by representatives
of Lake Forest and Laguna Niguel. But it was rejected by the Southern
California Assn. of Governments after representatives from other
cities called the move premature.</LD>
<LD>   In March, Orange County voters killed an airport at the former
Marine Corps Air Station, replacing it with zoning for parkland and
limited development. The day after the vote, the Navy--which still
owns the 4,700-acre base--announced it would sell the bulk of the
land under the new restrictions imposed by voters.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, however, Ventura County Supervisor Judy Mikels, who
chairs the association's aviation committee, echoed several
panelists' comments when she said any attempt to remove El Toro would
be premature because a lawsuit challenging the legality of Orange
County's vote is pending.</TE>
<TE>   "This issue has not been resolved," she said. An airport "is still
a viable option until the court cases are decided or the land has
been sold."</TE>
<TE>   The association's Regional Transportation Plan, approved a year
ago, calls for Orange County to handle 30 million airline passengers
a year by 2025. It was expected El Toro would handle 22 million
passengers annually and John Wayne Airport, 8 million.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over how to distribute among regional airports a
predicted surge of passengers has divided communities and fractured
political alliances.</TE>
<TE>   Officials representing cities near Los Angeles International and
Ontario International airports traveled to Washington recently in a
failed attempt to persuade the Federal Aviation Administration to
intervene and keep an airport option alive for El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest Councilman Richard T. Dixon proposed Thursday to begin
the process of removing El Toro from the region's aviation plan. He
said he felt "a little like Don Quixote" in the quest.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel Councilwoman Cathryn DeYoung argued that the
regional plan will lack credibility if it includes an airport that
voters rejected. "El Toro is not and will not be an airport," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The SCAG plan has been challenged in court by a coalition of 10
south Orange County cities opposed to an El Toro airport. A proposed
settlement--to drop the lawsuit if El Toro is removed from the
regional blueprint--was rejected Thursday after representatives from
the suing cities were asked to leave a closed-door discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Algird Leiga, a Claremont councilman, said later that the panel
should reexamine "the whole picture" during an update of the regional
aviation plan, which begins in July. A new plan will be adopted in
2004.</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo Councilman Kelly McDowell, among the most adamant for
keeping El Toro as part of the plan, agreed that the group should
wait until July to consider any revisions. Rich Macias, aviation
program manager for the regional association, said the Southern
California region could absorb about 10 million of Orange County's
future passengers.</TE>

the process of removing El Toro from the region's aviation plan. He
said he felt "a little like Don Quixote" in the quest--an
acknowledgment that his view was unpopular with most of the regional
planning board, which represents cities and seven counties in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel Councilwoman Cathryn DeYoung argued that the
regional plan will lack credibility if it includes an airport that
voters rejected. "El Toro is not and will not be an airport," she
said. "If we keep it in the regional transportation plan, we look
like fools."</TE>
<TE>   Brea Councilwoman Bev Perry also supported Dixon's proposal,
saying that even though she represents an Orange County city that
voted against the March initiative, "I think we need to move on."</TE>
<TE>   An airport at El Toro "isn't going to happen," she said. "I care
about a vote of the people who twice in Orange County have now said
they do not want an airport at El Toro."</TE>

<TE>   El Segundo Councilman Kelly McDowell, among the most adamant for
keeping El Toro as part of the plan, agreed that the group should
wait until July to consider revisions. "We trust that SCAG will
recognize that the burden of aviation demand is properly the
responsibility of Orange County," said McDowell, who represents
residents closest to LAX. To shift Orange County's need for
commercial aviation services "to any other community in this region
is going to be an injustice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Macias, aviation program manager for the regional
association, said the Southern California region could absorb about
10 million of Orange County's future passengers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't have El Toro in the mix, you have a loss of
capacity," he said. "What do you do with 30 million annual
passengers?"</TE>

<HD>Ida Engel, 98; After Late Start Became a Star of
Commercials</HD>

<LD>As a child growing up near Temple Street in downtown Los Angeles in
the days when movies were silent, Ida Engel would occasionally run
into film companies shooting in the streets and dream of one day
becoming a star like Charlie Chaplin or Mary Pickford.</LD>
<LD>   Engel never reached those heights, but she did prove that if you
live long enough in Los Angeles just about anything is possible.</LD>
<LD>   Engel, who landed a Hollywood agent in her 90s and went on to
appear in a string of commercials, including a current series for
Holiday Inn in which she plays a laughing granny, has died. She was
98 and was one of the oldest working members of the Screen Actors
Guild.</LD>
<TE>   Engel died of natural causes Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last five years, she appeared in more than a dozen
commercials, including spots for Church's Chicken.</TE>
<TE>   In the three-part series of chicken commercials, she managed to
burn down not just one but three houses--and the fire station next
door to the third house--while frying chicken.</TE>
<TE>   In the ongoing series of Holiday Inn commercials, she is seen as
the grandmother of a demanding thirtysomething slacker who is still
living in his parents' home. The commercials always end with the
punch line, "What do you think this is, the Holiday Inn?"</TE>
<TE>   Then Engel would explode with laughter.</TE>
<TE>   "It made you laugh when she laughed because it was such a funny
laugh," said Engel's daughter, Ruth Zebrack. "I mean, she was a real
comedian, my mother."</TE>
<TE>   Engel, a formally trained pianist and vocalist, always enjoyed
being the center of attention.</TE>
<TE>   The 4-foot-8 great-grandmother with the bubbly personality "would
sing at the drop of a hat," Zebrack said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everywhere she went, she just brought down the house, this tiny
little thing."</TE>
<TE>   For years, Engel had been the hit of local synagogues, senior
citizen centers, convalescent hospitals, showers, bar mitzvahs and
family gatherings, where she performed solo or with various groups.</TE>
<TE>   Engel was a member of the Chansonettes choral group for more than
50 years. She also organized weekly talent shows at a senior center
and served as emcee.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, she appeared on "The Gong Show," winning first prize with
a rousing rendition of her signature song, "Second Hand Rose."</TE>
<TE>   At 90, she appeared in the documentary "Young at Hearts," about a
group of eight Los Angeles women, all over 80 and all with upbeat
attitudes about life.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary filmmaking experience revived Engel's old
show-business aspirations. She joined a commercial acting class at
the Claude Pepper Senior Center and landed an agent.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother has always wanted to be a star all of her life, and she
ended up a star, she really did," Zebrack said. "They picked her up
for these commercials in limousines, and they had a stand-in for her
so she wouldn't have to stand there with all the lights. They'd say,
'Go get Ida. We're ready to shoot.' I mean, they just carried her
around in a chair like a queen."</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of Russian immigrant parents, Engel moved to Los
Angeles from her hometown of Winnipeg, Canada in 1907, when she was
4.</TE>
<TE>   Home was on Victor Street in the Temple Street area. Her father,
Harry Mandel, owned a clothing store on Main Street. Her mother,
Bessie, was known for opening their house to immigrants from Europe
and the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   At 15, Engel began serious piano lessons. After high school, she
enrolled at UCLA--the campus at the time was still on Vermont Avenue.
She studied music for two years, going to school in the mornings and
working afternoons for a wholesale jewelry company downtown on 5th
and Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   In 1924, she married Murray Engel, a Czech immigrant who had
stayed at the Mandel home after arriving in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In her 40s, Engel began taking singing lessons. She performed
whenever she could.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you," said Engel's other daughter, Sylvia Zamel, "my
mother performed because she loved it so much. She gave so much
pleasure to everyone. She saw a smile on their faces and that's all
she asked in return."</TE>
<TE>   When Engel began auditioning for commercials in the mid-1990s, she
wasn't discouraged by her initial lack of success at auditions. "We
kept saying, 'What are you wasting your time for?' She'd say, 'I
don't care, I'm having the best time,'" Zebrack said.</TE>
<TE>   On commercial sets, Engel was known to entertain cast and crew
members by launching into "Second Hand Rose."</TE>
<TE>   Engel made her final Holiday Inn commercial six weeks ago. It
aired for the first time in mid-April, the same day she went into
intensive care for a a medical condition.</TE>
<TE>   "It must have come on eight times that day," Zebrack said. "Every
time it would come on we'd wake her up. She'd say, 'Be quiet. If you
didn't talk so much I could hear it.'"</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her daughters, Engel is survived by five
grandchildren and four great grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral service will be held at 1 p.m. today at Hillside
Memorial Park and Mortuary in Culver City.</TE>

<HD>Senate Votes to Require Cleaner-Running Cars, Light Trucks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Siding with conservationists over automobile manufacturers, the
Senate voted Thursday to fight global warming with new restrictions
on tailpipe emissions of cars and light trucks.</LD>
<LD>   The bill AB 1058 matched all the big-name car makers against
environmental organizations in a clash reminiscent of their first
collisions more than three decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate returned the measure to the Assembly for expected
approval. It would then go to Gov. Gray Davis, handing him a
difficult political choice as he seeks reelection both as an advocate
for environmental protection and as a supporter of business and
commerce.</LD>
<TE>   Russ Lopez, a spokesman for Davis, said the governor had not yet
taken a position on the bill. "He wants to make sure it doesn't
adversely affect either group," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   Senate approval, on a 22-13 vote, provided a victory for
environmentalists who for at least a month had fought against a
costly advertising blitz opposing the bill.</TE>
<TE>   They claimed that opponents spread misinformation by suggesting
that the plan would increase taxes and the cost of automobiles.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, by first-term Assemblywoman Fran Pavley (D-Agoura
Hills), would direct the state Air Resources Board to devise and
approve unspecified rules that get "maximum feasible and
cost-effective" reduction of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.</TE>
<TE>   The standards would take effect in 2006. It also would prohibit
the board from banning the sale of any motor vehicle by category,
including SUVs and light trucks. Additionally, it would order the air
board not to impose any tax on miles driven or to impose any
restrictions on land use.</TE>
<TE>   Although scientists are split, many experts say that manufactured
carbon dioxide is contributing to global warming, a phenomenon that
could have potentially devastating effects on California. Those might
include reducing the water supply from a diminished Sierra snowpack
and damaging the coastline by altering delicate ocean ecosystems and
raising the sea level.</TE>
<TE>   In California, proponents of the bill contend, cars and light
trucks contribute about 40% of the greenhouse gas pollution,
producing twice as much greenhouse gas as other regions of the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents contend, however, that California's contribution to
global warming is less than 0.1%.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans, who with Democratic Assemblyman Mike Machado of
Linden cast all the votes against the bill, suggested that the
proposal would result in new taxes, less choice for car buyers and
higher prices for vehicles, especially highly popular SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats argued that the clean-air board has no power to raise
anybody's taxes.</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), the GOP candidate for
state controller, claimed the bill would give such power to the
agency.</TE>
<TE>   "Voters will see thousands of dollars go out of their pockets as a
result of this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The price of those [SUVs] will go up, but the rich people will be
able to afford them," said Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside).</TE>
<TE>   But other people would not be able to afford new SUVs and would
buy used ones instead, and produce even more carbon-dioxide
pollution, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) noted that the well-heeled
automobile industry had mobilized to kill the bill, just as it did in
years past when it opposed removing lead from gasoline, fought safety
belts, lobbied against federal fuel-efficiency standards and more
recently claimed air bags were not feasible. All came to pass.</TE>
<TE>   "Their credibility is, at the very best, low," Bowen told the
Senate.</TE>
<TE>   By opposing the bill, she said, the auto industry is "fighting to
stay stuck in the past."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), Senate floor manager for the
bill, told her colleagues that it was their duty to order
manufacturers to make changes when necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't do something to protect the people, God be with us,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the bill included the Bluewater Network, Coalition
for Clean Air, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club,
American Lung Assn., League of Conservation Voters, the city of Los
Angeles, various scientists and public officials.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents included the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which
represents virtually every car maker, General Motors, Daimler
Chrysler, the California Motor Car Dealers Assn., California State
Automobile Assn., California Chamber of Commerce and the Western
States Petroleum Assn., which represents major oil companies.</TE>

<HD>Holden Links Shooting to Departure of Parks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City Councilman Nate Holden on Thursday said last week's
officer-involved shooting of a 16-year-old was a predictor of life in
the Los Angeles Police Department without Chief Bernard Parks--"shoot
first, ask questions later."</LD>
<LD>   During a news conference at the scene of the Mid-City shooting,
Holden accused officers of resorting to street justice in the absence
of Parks, who was denied a second term as chief last month. Parks
announced his retirement two days before the April 24 incident and
has been away on vacation since.</LD>
<LD>   "This was excessive force," Holden said. "And it's a sign of
things to come, now that Parks is gone."</LD>
<TE>   The head of the Los Angeles Police Commission, which rejected
Parks' request for a second term, said Holden's remarks were meant to
inflame Parks' supporters. Deputy Chief Michael Bostic was named
acting chief while the commission conducts a nationwide search for
Parks' replacement.</TE>
<TE>   "I am appalled at this despicable statement, wholly designed to
incite tension in the city of Los Angeles," Police Commission
President Rick J. Caruso said.</TE>
<TE>   Quadry Green remained in critical condition Thursday at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Officers had pursued Green and another youth riding in a stolen
Toyota, a police report said. Green got out of the car and ran from
police and into a backyard on the 2300 block of West 20th Street.</TE>
<TE>   Wilshire Division Officer Scott Blackman, 32, recognizing the
neighborhood was an "active violent gang area" and thinking Green
reached for a gun from his waistband, fired once and struck Green in
the torso, police said. The youth reportedly had a pair of scissors,
not a gun. Green has been placed on paid administrative leave while
the shooting is under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The other teenager was arrested after a foot chase.</TE>
<TE>   "Statements by Councilman Holden that suggest a lack of leadership
in the police department or a deviation from long-standing LAPD
policy and procedure," a department rebuttal said, "are inflammatory
and inaccurate."</TE>
<TE>   The shooting gave Holden the opportunity to revisit a divide
between the police and some residents of South Los Angeles who have
felt targeted by police because they are black.</TE>

<HD>Msgr. George Higgins, 86; Backed Workers Rights</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAEME ZIELINSKI</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Msgr. George G. Higgins, a principal draftsman of modern-day Catholic
social theory who was called "the labor movement's parish priest,"
has died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Higgins died Wednesday at his sister's home in La Grange Park,
Ill., of complications from an infection.</LD>
<LD>   For several decades, Higgins was considered the leading
intellectual in the U.S. Catholic Church's links to 20th century
trade unionism, immigrant advocacy and liberal social policy.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no one in the United States who has had the singular
impact he has had on the Catholic Church and social teaching in the
last half century," said the Rev. Brian Hehir, former dean of Harvard
Divinity School.</TE>
<TE>   Higgins was a close confidant of virtually every major labor
leader since the 1940s, including John Brophy, George Meany, Walter
Reuther and John Sweeney, the current AFL-CIO president.</TE>
<TE>   Higgins served on the staff of the Washington-based National
Catholic Welfare Conference, now the U.S. Conference of Catholic
Bishops, from 1944 until retiring as secretary for special concerns
in 1980. He was director of the conference's influential social
action department from 1954 to 1967.</TE>
<TE>   He had, since his early priesthood, established himself as a
sought-after economics and labor expert at a time during the Cold War
when religious figures played bigger roles in public life and
industrial relations were the vexing question of the U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   "More than any other American in the 20th century, Msgr. Higgins
argued that Christian beliefs must prominently include the notion
that work must be valued and workers honored," Sweeney said in a
statement Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Higgins served from the 1960s to 2001 as chairman of the United
Auto Workers Public Review Board. He helped defuse a steelworkers
action that threatened major disruption to the economy in the 1950s.
In the late 1990s, he was a champion of janitors organizing in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   What he called one of his most satisfying efforts, however, was
the political success in the late 1960s and early '70s of Cesar
Chavez and the United Farm Workers. The determined priest cemented
the relationship between the Catholic Church and the workers.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout it all, he called on laypeople to support unions and
aggressive social policy, armoring himself with the church's own
teachings, especially two foundational papal encyclicals that
endorsed workers' rights, Rerum Novarum (1891) and Quadragesimo Anno
(1931).</TE>
<TE>   Higgins made enemies when he argued against the reticence of major
labor groups to admit minorities and railed against corruption in the
manner of an "On the Waterfront" priest. He also fought a rear-guard
action against the Teamsters in his advocacy of the United Farm
Workers.</TE>
<TE>   He described his career as one of a "ministry of presence," and
himself as a "social-action bureaucrat."</TE>
<TE>   Higgins also was a key figure seeking to mend the rift between
Jews and Catholics. He was influential in removing a reference to
"perfidious Jews" from the Catholic Good Friday Mass.</TE>
<TE>   As a media spokesman and consultor for U.S. bishops based in Rome
in the early 1960s, he was prominent in framing and explaining to
American Catholics the significance of the landmark reforms of the
Second Vatican Council.</TE>
<TE>   "Much of what the world press reported about the council filtered
through George's clean and succinct prose," the Rev. Andrew Greeley
wrote in a recent appreciation.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Higgins' sway stemmed from his weekly column, "The Yard
Stick," which he took over from another one of his mentors, the Rev.
Raymond A. McGowan, in 1945. He continued writing until recently,
though his eyesight had been failing for years. The column, noted for
its steel-clean writing and contrarianism, was syndicated in hundreds
of diocesan newspapers and often was a lone liberal voice amid a sea
of conservative Catholic commentary.</TE>
<TE>   Higgins began his social education during lunch breaks from
parochial school as a 10-year-old at his kitchen table in his native
La Grange, Ill. There, his father, a night postal foreman and union
supporter, would have him read aloud from the liberal Catholic
journals Commonweal and America. As a child, his father also would
take him on regular visits to Jewish neighborhoods on Chicago's Near
West Side.</TE>
<TE>   Higgins later would attend the Chicago Archdiocese's St. Mary of
the Lake Seminary and would come to the attention of another
legendary activist priest, Reynold Hillenbrand, the seminary rector
who inspired an impressive crop of social-minded clerics in that
period.</TE>
<TE>   Upon his ordination in 1940, Higgins was sent to Washington to
study at Catholic University, where he completed a doctorate in
economics in 1944. Higgins would be associated with Catholic
University as a teacher and lecturer for several decades. Though he
was assigned to the Chicago Archdiocese, Higgins found a way to stay
on in Washington, after accepting what was to be a temporary
appointment at the bishops conference. He ended up staying 36 years.</TE>
<TE>   Higgins was looked upon as radical for his talk about minorities
and as "dinosaurian" by others for his support of the union movement.
He parted with liberals on the issue of abortion, which he denounced.
And he tweaked members of the church hierarchy on the issue of the
rights of workers at Catholic institutions to organize.</TE>
<TE>   In later years, Higgins expressed frustration at the declining
influence of unions within the Catholic Church, and vice versa,
blaming the diminution on the increased affluence of Catholics. He
was awarded the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian
honor, by President Clinton in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Higgins is survived by two sisters.</TE>

allow illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses inadvertently
became law last year and needs to be implemented by the Department of
Motor Vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   The California attorney general's office, which was asked to weigh
in by the DMV, recently wrote the Latino advocacy group to deny the
claim and intends to fight the matter.</LD>
<LD>   The measure by Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles), which
would allow immigrants applying for citizenship or permanent
residency to obtain a driver's license, was approved by the
Legislature and landed on Gov. Gray Davis' desk shortly after the
Sept. 11 attacks heightened concerns about security.</LD>
<TE>   The Assembly's chief clerk, E. Dotson Wilson, then pulled the bill
back from the governor's desk--after the Legislature had adjourned
for the year and without its formal consent, a move the advocacy
group claims was illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, who said the measure was sent to the governor by mistake,
cited a legislative rule that allows him to pull back measures to fix
a "clerical error." But the group contends that Wilson overstepped
his bounds and that the bill was never legally removed from Davis'
desk.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the group says, Assembly Bill 60 became law after 30 days
passed without a signature or veto from the governor. An attorney for
the state curtly dismissed that argument in a letter to the defense
and education fund last week, but did not specify why.</TE>
<TE>   "We respectfully disagree" with the attorney general's office,
fund attorney Hector Villagra said Thursday at a Los Angeles news
conference. "Under the Constitution, there's no question AB 60 is the
law."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer declined to comment
Thursday, saying the staff had not yet seen the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   For several years, Cedillo has attempted to pass a law in
California that would permit immigrants who entered the country
illegally but are working to become citizens or permanent legal
residents to obtain driver's licenses. His office estimates that
roughly 2 million immigrants are driving in the state without a
license or insurance, and argues that that poses a safety concern.</TE>
<TE>   A number of law enforcement leaders agreed with Cedillo's
contention that it would be better to license illegal immigrants than
have them drive without government oversight. But when it was
revealed that some of the hijackers involved in the terrorist attacks
on the World Trade Center reportedly had fraudulent driver's
licenses, law enforcement leaders expressed new concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund has argued
the measure needed to be implemented by the DMV ever since The Times
first published a story on the technical blunder last fall. But it
waited to take legal action because Cedillo and Davis pledged to work
together on a compromise measure that would allow immigrants to
legally drive while protecting California from terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The talks have not resulted in new legislation, however. In fact,
they added fuel to the controversy when law enforcement officials
proposed that immigrants should have special licenses with an "I"
designating their status, an idea that the fund, Cedillo and others
charged would make them vulnerable to discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   "The final blow really was this scarlet letter on the driver's
license," Villagra said in an interview. "That has nothing to do with
the security concerns raised in September and undermines the entire
purpose of having these licenses."</TE>
<TE>   Cedillo treaded carefully Thursday after the fund announced it was
taking the dispute to court, along with the Legal Aid Foundation of
Los Angeles, on behalf of Yolanda Avila and Mary Grace O. de Asis.
The two immigrants attempted to obtain driver's licenses this year
but were told they needed a Social Security Number, something that
would not be required if AB 60 had been implemented.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Cedillo said he favors legislation over litigation
and will continue working with Davis, immigrants' advocates and law
enforcement leaders to fashion a measure all can support.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he said in unequivocal terms that he opposed
"using any form of physical distinction, such as an 'I' or a
different color-coded license to distinguish and differentiate
driver's licenses for immigrants. I believe that all licenses should
look the same for all drivers."</TE>

<LD>Eighty Marines joined dozens of police detectives Thursday in raking
thousands of tons of trash at the city dump in San Diego, searching
for clues in the disappearance last week of 2-year-old Jahi Turner.</LD>
<LD>   "We still have not located Jahi and we still have no suspects in
his disappearance," said Police Department spokesman David Cohen.</LD>
<LD>   The boy's stepfather, Tieray Jones, 23, reported him missing a

Balboa Park. Jones said a woman with two children was in the park at

mentioned by Jones. But later they determined that the woman had not
been in the park.</TE>

<HD>8 LAX Workers' Badges Seized</HD>
<DH>Security: Background checks find criminal convictions for
the employees, who had access to sensitive areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city agency that operates Los Angeles International Airport has
confiscated badges from eight employees with access to airplanes and
other security-sensitive areas after it found that the workers have
previous criminal convictions.</LD>
<LD>   The airport employees, who worked as fuelers and baggage handlers
and in facilities maintenance and administrative offices, have logged
18 months to more than 10 years of service at the world's
third-busiest airport. The majority of them have criminal histories
involving gun possession or drug-related convictions, airport
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery is part of a nationwide push by airports to complete
criminal background checks on more than 750,000 employees by Dec. 6
to comply with the aviation security law Congress approved in
November.</LD>
<TE>   Airport officials nationwide checked the records of 111,000
employees from Jan. 1 to March 1, compared with 170,000 checks
completed in all of 2001, said Rebecca Trexler, a spokeswoman for the
federal Transportation Security Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The checks are separate from arrests or indictments made at about
15 airports this year by federal law enforcement officials as part of
an investigation known as Operation Tarmac.</TE>
<TE>   Under the aviation security law, airports must revoke
high-security clearances for employees if they have been convicted of
one of 37 crimes within the past 10 years, including murder, rape,
kidnapping, robbery, extortion and aircraft piracy.</TE>
<TE>   Since early March, officials at LAX have sent 18,000 employees'
fingerprints to the FBI for comparison with its criminal databases.
Of that group, the airport agency revoked security clearances for
eight employees who had criminal convictions. All eight had lied
about their records on their applications, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Their cases were referred by airport officials to the FBI and the
Transportation Security Administration. Questionable applications
filed by about 15 additional employees at LAX are being investigated
during a 45-day review period.</TE>
<TE>   "The number of employees disqualified by the newly authorized
criminal background checks is extremely low, and we're heartened,"
said Paul Haney, an airport spokesman. "At the same time, we strongly
believe that one employee identified with a disqualifying crime is
too many."</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, officials at San Francisco International Airport
have revoked high-security clearances for 40 employees with criminal
convictions out of 7,905 employees fingerprinted so far under the new
law, said Ron Wilson, an airport spokesman. The airport is about
halfway through its background checks.</TE>
<TE>   "We anticipated that around 1% would be questionable," Wilson
said. "So we're under that. As different groups come in we have
different percentages."</TE>
<TE>   About 14,000 employees at LAX with access to secure areas are
still to undergo criminal background checks. It will cost the airport
agency $3.5 million to fingerprint and re-badge the 32,000 employees
who fall under the new aviation security law. Those employees work
for about 700 companies that provide services at LAX, including the
airlines.</TE>
<TE>   There are also 20,000 or so employees who do business at LAX who
will not undergo criminal background checks because they don't have
access to security-sensitive areas. This includes people in
concessions, parking lot attendants and taxi and shuttle drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Many LAX employees aren't required to complete the new checks
because they have already complied under a December 2000 federal law
requiring criminal checks of all new hires.</TE>
<TE>   The government's nationwide airport-badge identification system
was prompted by an LAX security breach that led to a fatal airplane
crash in December 1987. A disgruntled airline employee used his
company ID to skirt a security checkpoint and board an airplane while
carrying a gun. Then he shot and killed his boss and both pilots,
causing the plane to crash near San Luis Obispo. All 44 passengers on
board were killed. The USAir employee, David Burke, had been fired
that day for stealing $68 from a drink fund set up by flight
attendants.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to employee background checks being conducted at the
nation's airports, federal law enforcement officials have arrested or
indicted more than 450 workers at 15 airports as part of Operation
Tarmac.</TE>
<TE>   Those workers were arrested on charges such as using phony Social
Security numbers, lying about past criminal convictions or being in
the U.S. illegally. Some could face prison terms of up to 10 years,
and the illegal immigrants could be deported.</TE>
<TE>   Employees were arrested at airports in Washington, Baltimore,
Phoenix, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento and Las
Vegas, among others.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Hits GOP With Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Long Beach city attorney filed a lawsuit Thursday charging the
California Republican Party with violating city election law by
spending $5,431 on behalf of Norm Ryan's mayoral bid.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit is the second filed by the city since the April 9
election and aims to stop "soft money campaign violations," said City
Atty. Bob Shannon.</LD>
<LD>   State GOP chief Shawn Steele said Shannon "does not appear to be
aware of Long Beach's own campaign statutes or state law governing
election activity. The CRP has a right to contact members of the
Republican Party under the provisions of Proposition 34, which
preempts local campaign law restrictions."</LD>
<TE>   But under city law, Shannon said, the state party could have given
Ryan the $5,431 only if donations to the party are each $600 or less,
and naturally they aren't.</TE>
<TE>   On April 17, Shannon sued an independent spending committee,
California Citizens for Neighborhood Empowerment, which spent more
than $25,000 on Vice Mayor Dan Baker's behalf. Again, he said, once
the group spent in the city race, it fell under the city ban on
getting donations above $600.</TE>
<TE>   That suit also named committee treasurer Kinde Durkee, who is also
treasurer of Baker's mayoral campaign. Baker and campaign manager
Mike Orlito have not returned phone calls since then. A campaign
spokeswoman said Baker had no comment because there is no connection
between the committee and his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Because no candidate won more than 50% of the vote, a runoff will
be held June 4. The top vote-getter in April was incumbent Beverly
O'Neill, a write-in candidate because of term limits. Baker received
the second most votes. However, because O'Neill is a write-in, only
Baker's name will appear on the June ballot.</TE>

<HD>EPA Fines Lockheed for Water Cleanup Violations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lockheed Martin Corp. was fined $1.38 million by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency for improperly operating its water
cleanup system in Burbank, officials announced Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Under the terms of a 1992 federal consent decree, Lockheed's
Burbank unit was ordered to pump 9,000 gallons per minute from the
local aquifer to help purge water supplies of toxic solvents.</LD>
<LD>   But the EPA said Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Md., did not comply
with the agreement because it failed to operate the plant at full
capacity between June 2000 and July 2001.</LD>
<TE>   "Lockheed took the position that the extraction problems at the
plant were due to lack of water in the aquifer," said EPA attorney
Marie Rongone. "After extensive reviews, we determined that they were
due to plant maintenance and design choice issues that we believe
contributed to the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed Martin spokeswoman Gail Rymer said company officials did
not believe the fine was warranted, adding that the aeronautics firm
was attempting to resolve any production issues at the Burbank plant.</TE>
<TE>   "This dispute has nothing to do with public health," Rymer said.
"We've been in good-faith negotiations with the EPA and the U.S.
Department of Justice for many months."</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed's former Burbank production complex has been identified
by state and federal environmental officials as a major source of
solvents that have polluted ground water in Burbank and forced the
city to shut municipal water wells.</TE>
<TE>   The area was designated for cleanup in 1986 under the federal
Superfund program, which requires those responsible for pollution to
pay for the removal of toxic materials.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental officials say ground water in the Burbank area is
contaminated with TCE and PCE, two types of toxic solvents from past
aerospace manufacturing operations.</TE>
<TE>   "The less [water] you pump, the longer it takes to clean up,"
Rongone said. "And that's going to take long enough as it is."</TE>

<HD>Cardinals Look Out for No. 1 in Scandal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Entirely by coincidence, I happened to be in Rome while American
bishops and cardinals were there for a powwow with the pope. Once or
twice, I was tempted to interrupt the vacation with my wife and run
over to the Vatican to see if I could corner a cardinal or two.</LD>
<LD>   Thankfully, logic prevailed.</LD>
<LD>   It was preordained that church leaders would say very little in
Rome, and do even less. After the meetings, America's vicars of
morality left as they had arrived: secure, intact, not one of them
held accountable for a scandal of their own making.</LD>
<TE>   This avoidance of responsibility is its own little miracle, when
you think about the likes of Cardinals Roger Mahony and Bernard Law
of Los Angeles and Boston. Law, in particular, would have been tossed
out on the street months ago if he were in any other business. But in
the church, he's just one or two scandals away from being promoted to
Rome.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of priests nationally--30 in California alone--have been
driven out of the church since January. One, an alleged rapist on the
run from Boston, left his San Diego apartment in handcuffs Thursday
morning. He's the fellow who was dished off to a San Bernardino
parish after dozens of abuse allegations, and his attendance at a
gathering of the North American Man/Boy Love Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Any idea how many bishops and cardinals have lost their jobs since
January?</TE>
<TE>   One.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Anthony J. O'Connell, of West Palm Beach, Fla., admitted
fondling a seminary student and had the humility to walk away.</TE>
<TE>   Day after day, bells toll in Rome as evidence mounts that bishops
and cardinals have harbored, reassigned and otherwise protected
abusive priests, in the process putting more potential victims within
reach.</TE>
<TE>   But not one such leader has been indicted, dismissed or demoted,
or had the decency to step down, as O'Connell did. You get the
feeling the confab in Rome was nothing more than a company picnic.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't get anybody to understand that the corruption comes from
the top down and not from the bottom up," says Richard Sipe, a former
priest living in La Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping the cases in Boston and Los Angeles will advance that
idea. The church hierarchy says they have to get better screening of
new priests, and that's not going to make one bit of difference. It's
not a case of little perverts sneaking into the church. It's a case
of men flourishing in a system that is accountable to no one and
considers itself above the law."</TE>
<TE>   This brings up another crime in the church, one that hasn't gotten
much attention. When rogue police officers are found out, there's a
rush to condemn the code of silence that protects corruption and
abuse. We all want to know why just one good cop didn't have the
courage to blow the whistle.</TE>
<TE>   The priesthood is a small fraternity, too, with relatively few
secrets. So why haven't good priests had the courage to give up the
predators among them?</TE>
<TE>   Sipe says he tried. Two times as a priest and three times since
he's left the church and worked as a therapist, he's reported abuse
or suspected abuse to church officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been turned away every time," he says. "Just like the police
force, there isn't just one reason it's kept quiet. The clergy is a
culture, and rules of truth and honesty that would seem appropriate
on the outside don't mean a thing on the inside."</TE>
<TE>   Sipe told of one case of rape, in which the victim later asked a
priest who had witnessed the act why he didn't do anything. "And the
response was, 'Father is only human,'" Sipe says.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a sense of entitlement in the priesthood, and an odd
contradiction. Priests consider themselves held to a higher
standard--the standard of Jesus Christ and the law of God. At the
same time they don't feel bound by the same rules that apply to
others. That is the culture, and once you understand it, a lot of
things come into focus."</TE>
<TE>   I think things have been coming into focus for a while. I started
in on this subject last summer, writing about a priest in Dana Point
who volunteered gads of information about his abuse of a teenager and
his relationships with several women. I've never understood why he
gave himself up like that; maybe it's because he knew no one else
would.</TE>
<TE>   That pastor was run out of his parish after the publicity. Last
weekend, the same church lost another priest. This one had been sent
there in 1996, three years after admitting "inappropriate behavior"
with men, and two years after the parents of two sons accused the
priest of molesting the boys.</TE>
<TE>   And on and on and on.</TE>
<TE>   If you grew up in a church, as I did, there's something comforting
about walking into St. Peter's in the Vatican, no matter what route
you've followed to get there. The echoes of footfalls seem to bounce
off the rafters of heaven, and you are taken back to a time in your
youth when you believed so much and knew so little.</TE>

<HD>Parents of Slain Teen Settle</HD>
<DH>Court: West Hills couple will receive nearly $350,000 from
parents of son's alleged killers and others. Boy died in 2000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Susan and Jeffrey Markowitz will be paid nearly $350,000 in
settlements from the parents of their son's alleged killers and
others who they say failed to save 15-year-old Nicholas' life, court
documents show.</LD>
<LD>   A total of 14 defendants, including the Los Angeles Police
Department, contributed to the deal, according to papers filed in
Santa Barbara County Superior Court this week.</LD>
<LD>   Nicholas was kidnapped near his West Hills home Aug. 6, 2000, and
fatally shot two days later in a mountain campsite called Lizard's
Mouth near Santa Barbara. Authorities alleged that fugitive Jesse
James Hollywood, 22, orchestrated Nicholas' kidnapping and murder
because the boy's half brother, Benjamin, 24, owed him $200.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleged that the owners of the homes where Nicholas
was held captive and the vehicles used to transport him were
negligent for failing to help their son escape danger.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wake-up call to everybody," attorney Richard G. Tarlow
said. "We have responsibilities."</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, all of those settling disclaimed responsibility.
Among them, longtime Hollywood family friend John Roberts will pay
almost half of the total settlement, or $165,000, documents show.
Roberts, 70, loaned Hollywood the van used to kidnap Nicholas.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's parents, Jack and Laurie Hollywood, will pay $50,000,
according to the proposed settlement order. The lawsuit alleged that
they were aware of Nicholas' kidnapping and did not try to help him.</TE>
<TE>   While Nicholas was being held hostage, Hollywood met with his
father and Roberts at the Calabasas home of Hollywood's girlfriend,
Michelle Lasher, the suit alleged. Under the settlement, Michelle
Lasher and her parents, Douglas and Elaine Lasher, will pay $35,000,
documents show.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement will include $35,000 from the city of Los Angeles,
documents show. The lawsuit alleged that if Los Angeles Police
Officers Brent Rygh and Donovan Lyons had properly investigated two
separate 911 calls reporting the kidnapping, they might have saved
Nicholas' life.</TE>
<TE>   Five men, including Hollywood, were charged in Santa Barbara
County with Nicholas' murder. Ryan Hoyt, 22, of West Hills was
sentenced to death in November. Jesse Rugge, 22, of Santa Barbara is
awaiting a verdict in his murder trial. And two others, William
Skidmore, 22, of Simi Valley and Graham Pressley, 18, of Goleta, are
awaiting separate trials.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Affronti, then a teen, was in the van used to kidnap
Nicholas and will pay $17,500, according to the proposed settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Two other then-teens, Natasha Adams-Young and Casey Sheehan, will
pay the Markowitz's $1,700 and $1,000, respectively, for driving
Nicholas and his captors from one site to another, documents show.</TE>
<TE>   Another defendant, Stephen M. Hogge, has not settled. He is the
Simi Valley attorney who prosecutors allege offered the legal advice
that led to Hollywood's decision to have Nicholas killed. Hogge has
said he was ethically bound to protect his client's confidences.
Tarlow said his clients have not yet decided whether to pursue their
case against Adams and Hogge.</TE>
<TE>   Tarlow said he will seek a default judgment against Hollywood, an
alleged drug dealer who, at 19, owned a three-bedroom house in West
Hills and drove a Mercedes. Markowitz also will seek damages against
Hollywood's co-defendants, Tarlow said.</TE>
<TE>   Five other defendants settled earlier. Two are fighting the
claims. At least four defendants, including the gun manufacturer,
have been dismissed or were never served. And the case against the
five criminal defendants is pending.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers will pay most of the settlement, Tarlow said.</TE>

<HD>MTA, Bus Activists Hold Rare Meeting With U.S. Mediator</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Representatives of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and
members of an advocacy group whose lawsuit brought about a bitterly
contested federal consent decree to boost bus service held
face-to-face talks Thursday with a federal mediator, the first such
meeting in two years and the first since the agency's legal appeals
were quashed by the Supreme Court.</LD>
<LD>   The meeting, at the U.S. District Courthouse in downtown Los
Angeles, was important because the two sides rarely come together to
address mediator Donald T. Bliss, the Washington attorney overseeing
the 5-year-old agreement with judge-like power.</LD>
<LD>   Bliss could force the MTA, which is responsible for finding
solutions to the nation's worst traffic, to spend hundreds of
millions of dollars more than budgeted over the next decade on buses.
Such a move could damage the MTA's greatest hopes, including
expansion of its light-rail network.</LD>
<TE>   The two sides remain engaged in a legal street fight, agreeing on
virtually nothing. As has been the case since the 10-year-long
agreement was signed, the broadest point of contention Thursday was
figuring out what constitutes bus overcrowding. The decree binds the
MTA to benchmarks requiring it by June 30 to have an average of eight
standees on its buses.</TE>
<TE>   Given its first chance to address Bliss in a joint meeting in two
years, MTA officials immediately painted themselves as having
fulfilled their mission. "Under any reasonable interpretation the
standard has been met," said James Schreier, a lawyer hired by the
MTA.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA made the same case unsuccessfully to the federal courts
before it was finally turned away in March by the Supreme Court,
which refused to review the consent decree.</TE>
<TE>   The Bus Riders Union, in response, characterized the MTA's bus
system as vastly overcrowded and "massively out of compliance" with
the consent decree's benchmarks, said representative Ted Robertson.</TE>
<TE>   Because the meeting was exploratory, Bliss offered no solutions.
He did have positive words for much of what he has seen from the MTA,
acknowledging that the agency's fleet of about 2,100 buses has vastly
improved. Bliss will gather more information and come up with a
short-term solution, potentially ordering scores more buses, within
the next few months.</TE>

<HD>Woman Is Charged With Stabbing Child With Needle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police on Thursday said they were looking for at least
four other children who could be victims of the same woman who
allegedly stabbed a 22-month-old boy in the ear with a hypodermic
needle.</LD>
<LD>   Felony charges were filed this week by the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office against Phyllis Marie Johnson, 44, who was
arrested Saturday on the 600 block of South Broadway. Authorities
have not yet determined the contents of the syringe but said the
victim, Daniel Aburto, is in good health.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel and his mother were on a busy sidewalk in the Jewelry
District when he began rubbing his ear and crying in her arms.</LD>
<TE>   She saw Johnson walking away and alerted Historic Core Business
District security bike officers, who contacted police, said LAPD Det.
Dennis Moeller.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was arrested about a block away. Witnesses at the scene
told police they saw Johnson approach at least four other children
with an object concealed in her sleeve, touch them on the side of
their heads and then walk away, Moeller said. The children began
crying after Johnson touched them.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Aburto was taken to a local hospital and is in "great
condition," said Capt. Jim Rubert.</TE>
<TE>   The syringe and needle taken from Johnson are being analyzed, said
LAPD Det. Kelvin Higa. According to the felony complaint filed by the
district attorney's office, Johnson had heroin with her when she was
arrested. Higa said it is suspected that heroin was in the needle.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who is being held in Twin Towers jail in lieu of $500,000
bail, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges of felony child abuse,
assault with a deadly weapon, possession of a controlled substance,
torture and corporal injury to a child. Her preliminary hearing is
scheduled for May 10.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Johnson does not have a history of mental illness and
is a resident of downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Higa said police don't believe the incident is related to a
similar one in April in which a 21-year-old man was arrested for
allegedly injecting women with a tranquilizing drug in Santa Barbara
and Mammoth Lakes.</TE>
<TE>   Parents who believe their children may have been victims of an
attack are asked to call LAPD Central Division detectives at (213)
485-2671 during business hours or (213) 405-2504 24 hours a day.</TE>

<HD>Nurses Union to Vote on Strike</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The union representing nearly 8,000 registered nurses within the
University of California health system has scheduled a vote next week
to authorize a strike at six hospitals statewide.</LD>
<LD>   The nurses and the university have been attempting to renew a
labor contract that expired at midnight Tuesday, but talks this week
have not produced an agreement. The chief negotiator for the
California Nurses Assn., the union representing the nurses, said he
doesn't expect any new talks before the vote Tuesday and Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   If the nurses authorize a strike, the negotiating team has agreed
to give 10 days' notice before nurses walk off the job at the six
hospitals, including UCLA's facilities in Westwood and Santa Monica.</LD>
<TE>   "We're really at a breaking point," said the CNA's chief
negotiator, Joe Lindsay. "None of the major issues have been
resolved."</TE>
<TE>   UC spokesman Paul Schwartz acknowledged fundamental differences
between the two sides, but said UC officials want to keep
negotiations open. He said another meeting has been scheduled for May
13.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, we're going to have to work this out together,"
Schwartz said. "We don't think a strike serves anybody's interest,
least of all patients. We would hope that they would look for other
options to make progress."</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the nurses union wants UC to abandon its merit pay
plan and adopt a system of raises based solely upon years of service.
The nurses also want the hospital to prohibit mandatory overtime and
immediately implement minimum ratios of nurses to patients.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current merit pay system, some 10-year nurses earn less
than two-year nurses, said CNA negotiator Maxine Terk, a neonatal
intensive care nurse at UCLA Medical Center in Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   "They limit the nurses that have been there the longest and reward
the nurses that are coming in at the bottom," Terk said. "It's who
you know and how they like you, and it's budget driven. This makes
for a major morale problem."</TE>
<TE>   UC officials defend the current pay system. In its latest offer,
UC proposed average pay increases of 13.5% over two years, mostly
through merit raises. The only nurses excluded would be those with
unsatisfactory performance ratings, which has been about 1% of
nurses, Schwartz said.</TE>
<TE>   "We very much believe in a performance-based compensation program
in order to continue to properly recognize quality nursing and
quality patient care, as opposed to the kind of pay system that CNA
wants that really doesn't take that into account at all," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The CNA plans to release the results of the strike vote on
Thursday. If the nurses actually do strike, it would be the first
walkout in the history of the UC system, both sides say.</TE>
<TE>   The UC hospitals are located in Westwood, Santa Monica, San Diego,
San Francisco, Davis and Irvine. The nurses union also represents
nurses that work at four student health centers on UC campuses.</TE>

<LD>A former Marine from Orange County was convicted Thursday of two
felonies in connection with a crash on Interstate 5 near Carlsbad
that killed a California Highway Patrol officer.</LD>
<LD>   A Superior Court jury convicted Christopher Merrick, 20, of felony
hit-and-run and gross vehicular manslaughter in the Oct. 20, 2000,
death of Officer Sean Nava. The jury acquitted Merrick of
second-degree murder.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors alleged that Merrick, originally of Breckenridge,
Colo., was drunk from a night of partying in Tijuana when his car hit
Nava, who was standing near the median.</LD>
<TE>   Merrick remains in jail pending his sentencing. He faces up to 15
years in prison. He was discharged from the Marine Corps after the
accident.</TE>

<HD>Officials Pumped Up Over Sweet-Smelling Boat Fuel</HD>
<DH>Environment: New facility at Ventura Harbor is called the
first to offer a pure 'biodiesel' made from soybean oil.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One by one, people drifted from an outdoor buffet table to the
rumbling rear of a National Park Service boat called Sea Ranger II,
sniffing the exhaust for its elusive bouquet.</LD>
<LD>   "French fries,'' offered one man.</LD>
<LD>   "Definitely not popcorn," someone else ventured. "Maybe a bit of
Chinese restaurant."</LD>
<TE>   The fumes were the centerpiece Thursday at the opening of a
Ventura Harbor fuel dock where boaters can fill their tanks with a
clean-burning brew made from a first cousin of tofu: soybean oil.</TE>
<TE>   While forms of "biodiesel" are available to yachtsmen at a handful
of West Coast anchorages, Ventura's operation is far and away the
largest, according to Jenna Higgins, a spokeswoman for the
Missouri-based National Biodiesel Board.</TE>
<TE>   It's also the first fuel dock to offer pure biodiesel instead of a
blend, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Gathered for a ribbon-cutting at the new pump, officials with the
city, Ventura Port District, Ventura Chamber of Commerce, National
Park Service, Ventura Harbor Patrol and the Navy inhaled
enthusiastically.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pleasant smell," said Niel Madsen, who runs the fuel dock
for Ventura Harbor Marine Fuel Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Regular diesel makes me seasick," he said.</TE>
<TE>   John Johnson, the firm's owner, said more than $500,000 had been
poured into upgrading the dock opposite Andria's seafood restaurant.
About one-third of his company's 60,000-gallon storage capacity will
be given over to the soy-based fuel that is trucked in from the
Midwest, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At $2.89 a gallon, biodiesel works in any engine that runs on
standard diesel but goes for more than twice the cost. Proponents,
however, say it does less harm to the environment and eliminates the
thick, noxious billows of diesel smoke that, combined with robust
waves, have turned many a passenger green.</TE>
<TE>   "Your wife will say the boat smells like home," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's biggest customer will be the National Park Service. With
a federal subsidy, Channel Islands National Park burns biodiesel in
two of its four boats.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have an unplanned release, we're basically spilling
vegetable oil into the ocean," said Rhonda Brooks, the ranger who
oversees the national park's fleet. "It won't compromise the
environment."</TE>
<TE>   Until now, Brooks said, the National Park Service has relied on
biodiesel hauled in by truck. Filling up took three hours, she said.</TE>
<TE>   With the new biodiesel pump, however, it will take 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Recreational boaters also can fuel at the dock. At a few other
California harbors, the biodiesel setup involves nothing much more
than a 55-gallon drum and a hose, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   With less biodiesel for sale, the cost is higher, topping out at
as much as $5 a gallon.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, biodiesel has been adopted by more than 150 government
agencies and school districts across the country. But its sales still
are well below 1% of petroleum-based diesel's, according to the
National Biodiesel Board.</TE>
<TE>   It could wind up competing with another alternative fuel.
Scientists at Naval Base Ventura County are planning a pilot project
that would convert restaurant grease into fuel.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have local crops for the job," the Park Service's Kent
Bullard said. "But we can always harvest McDonald's."</TE>

<HD>Asleep at the Wheel? Coffee Can't Get You Going When You
Leave It Behind</HD>

<LD>On her way to work, Pam Coyle of Coto de Caza noticed "a tan
Expedition on the 133 tollway had a white Styrofoam cup, complete
with red stir stick, on the rear bumper. I ... could tell there was
still [presumably] coffee in the cup, slightly sloshing. I had to get
on the northbound 5 while the Expedition continued on. I hope that
the cup was still on the bumper when she arrived at work so she could
finish the coffee and stop wondering where she set it down.''</LD>
<LD>   Hey, I have an idea! Why don't commuters try that trick with their
cell phones!</LD>
<LD>   These SUVs are really getting out of hand: Jim Moore of Nipomo saw
an ad for a vehicle where a large family could live comfortably--and
even sip coffee on a porch (see accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: Michael Kory said he complained "many
times to the post office about the misdelivery of others' mail to our
home.'' So a postal supervisor gave a notice about the problem to the
carrier for the carrier's eyes only.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, it was delivered to Kory (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   I'm reminded of the time postal carriers went on strike and
Groucho Marx proposed this: "We give them the raises--but by mail.''</TE>
<TE>   Wait 'til the animal rights folks hear about this: Elinor Kastner
of Venice noticed that one salon made a startling admission (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Seal of disapproval: In a discussion of bandit (unlicensed) taxis,
I pointed out that you can spot the legal cabs in L.A. because they
display the city seal. But Rufus Baker says some wily illegals have
taken to painting the seal on their hacks themselves. But they aren't
all such great spellers. Baker saw one that said, "City of Lost
Angeles.''</TE>
<TE>   I've heard of trees being stripped...: The Beach Reporter's police
log says a woman "went out back to talk to her gardener [but] . saw a
man she had never seen before, completely naked. Her gardener was
nowhere to be seen.''</TE>
<TE>   Now for another episode of "Ye Olde Cops!'': I'm not sure if there
was an Only at Plymouth Colony columnist in the mid-17th century. But
amateur genealogist Patricia Bausman of Westminster has found a
wealth of police log-type items from the colony at a University of
Virginia Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Her favorite involved the arrest of one "Allice, the wife of
Richard Berry, of Yarmouth,'' who was charged with "goeing into the
house of Benjamine Hammond, when noe body was att home, and
felloniously tooke away a womans shift, that was new made, but
without sleeus and a peece of porke.'' Bausman says, "We don't know
what her sentence was, but I wonder if they went easy on her because
the 'womans shift' had no sleeves.''</TE>
<TE>   Good thing he said "perhaps'': Iquoted columnist David Allen of
the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin saying that Kem Nunn's "Pomona
Queen'' was "perhaps the only novel of suspense whose hero is a
vacuum cleaner salesman.'' Don Burke responded that Allen had
forgotten about the vacuum cleaner salesman in Graham Greene's "Our
Man in Havana,'' portrayed in the movie by Sir Alec Guinness.</TE>
<TE>   And Angelo Laiacona adds that a vacuum cleaner salesman thwarts an
assassination attempt in the 1957 British comedy "The Green Man.'' My
late father, who was a Hoover salesman, never told me the profession
was so exciting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Paula Brynen says she was listening to the radio when
she heard, "This traffic report is made possible by Rosarita refried
beans. Wind advisory everywhere in Antelope Valley.'' She said the
report was interrupted briefly by the announcer's laughter.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Edith Clinton Truslow, 91, who co-wrote a history of the experiment
that produced the atomic bomb, died Saturday in Santa Fe, N.M. The
cause of death was not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   She was co-author with David Hawkins and Ralph C. Smith of
"Project Y: The Los Alamos Story," which was published in 1983, 36
years after it was written and classified secret by the federal
government.</LD>
<LD>   It was declassified in the early 1960s, but was virtually
unavailable until its reissue two decades later. A Los Angeles Times
review called it "considerably more literate and revealing than most
of the genre."</LD>
<TE>   Truslow had been a lieutenant in the Women's Army Corps after
World War II when she won a transfer to Los Alamos, N.M., as a
historian in 1946, the year after the test blast overseen by Robert
J. Oppenheimer, director of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos
Laboratory. She later retired from the military and spent 35 years
working as a commercial photographer.</TE>
<TE>   The history was primarily the work of Truslow's colleague,
Hawkins, a UC Berkeley philosopher who joined his friend Oppenheimer
at Los Alamos in 1943 as the project's troubleshooter and later as
its official historian.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Kenneth L. Melmon, 67, a noted pharmacologist, founder of an
online information service for physicians and former chairman of the
department of medicine at Stanford University, died April 8 of a
heart attack at his home in Woodside, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   A second-generation San Francisco native, he was a graduate of
Stanford and the UC San Francisco School of Medicine. He was chief of
UC San Francisco's clinical pharmacology division for 13 years before
joining the Stanford faculty in 1978.</LD>
<LD>   Melmon served as chief of the department of medicine at Stanford
until 1984, when he was censured by a university ethics committee for
"grossly negligent scholarship."</LD>
<TE>   He resigned as department head after acknowledging that he had
failed to secure permission to use material from a book he helped
edit in writing the chapter of another textbook. Melmon remained on
the Stanford faculty with no loss of tenure or other responsibilities
until assuming emeritus status in 2000. During his last seven years,
he also served as associate dean for postgraduate medical education.</TE>
<TE>   In his last years at Stanford, he led an effort to develop
software for an online service providing physicians with access to
medical textbooks, clinical journals and drug databases.</TE>
<TE>   Called Skolar M.D., it allows users to search for answers to
clinical questions. Melmon was chief medical officer of the
independent technology company that offers the service.</TE>

<LD>Richard Newhouse, 78, a former Illinois state senator who was the
first black man to run for mayor of Chicago, died April 24 of heart
failure in Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   Newhouse, a Democrat, represented the state's 13th and 24th Senate

<HD>Pesticides Still Pose a Risk to School Kids, Group Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While a new law has prompted some California school districts to
reduce usage of dangerous pesticides on school campuses, many
children are still regularly exposed to chemicals linked to cancer
and birth defects, the California Public Interest Research Group
reported Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "Kids spend seven or eight hours a day and nine months a year in
the same area," said Corina McKendry, who surveyed the state's 15
largest districts about their use of pesticides . "It's unacceptable
to take the risk of exposing children to these chemicals."</LD>
<LD>   The Healthy Schools Act, which became law in January 2001,
requires schools to notify the parents of schoolchildren about the
pesticides that they expect to use during the year. The law also
requires schools to provide ways for parents to learn about pesticide
applications in advance and to post warning signs near treated areas.</LD>
<TE>   The law does not require school districts to cut back on pesticide
usage, but the research group found that some districts have taken
positive steps to reduce children's exposure to chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   While the law allows districts to develop their own pesticide
reduction plans, it does require the California Department of
Pesticide Regulation to show districts how they can decrease their
dependency on chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   According to the survey, the districts reported that they expected
to use 54 different pesticides. Ten districts reported plans to use
products containing carcinogens or toxins that may affect children's
reproductive and nervous systems.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these chemical products could be replaced by less harmful
substances, said Glenn Brank, spokesman for the state's department of
pesticide regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Ziegler from Santa Ana Unified said the district has saved
closed to $50,000 by switching to more environmentally friendly
methods. Los Angeles Unified, the San Francisco and Oakland school
districts were praised in the report for their plans to reduce
pesticides.</TE>

<HD>Huntington Beach Hasn't Got a Prayer Without Her</HD>
<DH>Religion: Resident Debbie Borden has taken it upon herself
to fill the void left when the invocation at council meetings was
banned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Debbie Borden can't fight City Hall, so the Huntington Beach woman
has decided to pray for it instead.</LD>
<LD>   At the public-comments portion of each City Council meeting, the
soft-spoken homemaker rises to the podium and recites a simple
prayer. She's been doing it since January, when Councilwoman Debbie
Cook became mayor and immediately discontinued the traditional
invocation at the beginning of each meeting.</LD>
<LD>   Cook's decision has sparked a passionate controversy in the city
about the role of prayer and religion at public meetings. The mayor
has been criticized at council meetings and in a flood of letters to
local newspapers by residents who think banning the traditional
prayer is positively un-Christian.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the heat, Cook is standing firm. "It's not government's
job to direct people on how to pray and who to pray to; that's the
church's role," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Borden, 49, is less strident than some of Cook's critics. Instead
of getting angry, she said, she is trying to do something good for
the city. At a recent council meeting, she ended her prayer by asking
for "the wisdom and knowledge of our Lord in order to guide our
leaders in making decisions for our city."</TE>
<TE>   She admits she is no public speaker but believes government
meetings should include some type of prayer.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I go up there, I'm very, very nervous," she said.
"Each time it ought to be getting a little bit easier, but it always
is an emotional thing."</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach is one of several cities to struggle with prayer
during public meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank was sued in 1999 by Jewish Defense League Chairman Irv
Rubin after a minister delivered a prayer invoking the name of Jesus
Christ at a City Council meeting. Rubin claimed the religious
reference was unconstitutional, and a year later a Los Angeles judge
ordered Burbank to bar prayers that reflect a specific religion's
beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the council has begun each meeting with a
nondenominational invocation. In addition, the agenda now warns that
sectarian prayer has been deemed unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank is appealing the ruling. The last time the U.S. Supreme
Court took up the issue was in 1983, when it upheld the
constitutionality of an opening invocation at legislative sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Other cities, such as El Cajon in San Diego County, have
substituted a prayer before meetings with a moment of silence.</TE>
<TE>   The Huntington Beach invocation was intended to include different
religions, with ministers, rabbis, priests and others sharing the
duty. But Cook said the rotation system didn't always work because
religious leaders weren't always available. As a result, city staff
members ended up leading the prayer during some sessions.</TE>
<TE>   After Cook eliminated the prayer, Rabbi Steven Einstein, president
of the city's Interfaith Council, offered to have his group handle
the scheduling and provide guidance to those who would say the
prayers. But, he said, Cook turned him down.</TE>
<TE>   "She wasn't comfortable with that because the city should not be
in the position of telling people how to pray," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, 51, is an attorney known as an outspoken advocate of
environmental protections and slow growth.</TE>
<TE>   She said she's aware that her decision has caused controversy but
believes she was left with no choice.</TE>
<TE>   She points to the 1st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which
states: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of
religion, nor prohibit the free exercise thereof."</TE>
<TE>   "I swore to uphold the Constitution," she said. "And that's what
I'm doing."</TE>
<TE>   But that argument doesn't sway Borden, who said she will keep
reciting her own prayer until the rules are changed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my personal belief that a prayer needs to be said for the
city of Huntington Beach," she said. "I believe we should ask for
divine guidance in the governing of our city."</TE>

<HD>8 Men Claim Priest Abused Them as Boys</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Oxnard police are pursuing allegations
against a pastor now working in Mexico. The men have sued him, his
order and the L.A. Archdiocese.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oxnard police are investigating allegations by eight men who say they
were sexually abused as children at a church and on trips by a priest
now working in Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   The eight men, including two who are now police officers, sued
Father Fidencio Silva, his order and the Archdiocese of Los Angeles
on Thursday, alleging battery, negligent supervision and sexual
abuse. Under California law intended to protect civil defendants in
such cases, the four lawsuits did not name the priest or other
defendants. However, the attorneys filing the lawsuits provided the
names.</LD>
<LD>   Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez said his department has begun an
investigation into the allegations of abuse by Silva.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuits filed in Los Angeles Superior Court seek unspecified
monetary damages. They allege Silva actively concealed the sexual
exploitation of the boys and that church officials "knew or
reasonably should have known" about the priest's conduct.</TE>
<TE>   The suits accuse Silva, 45, of sexually abusing the boys from 1979
to about 1985 after becoming a pastor at Oxnard's Our Lady of
Guadalupe parish. Some alleged abuses occurred during trips to
Mexico, said Jeffrey R. Anderson, a St. Paul, Minn., attorney
handling the case.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy is a pedophile predator," Anderson said. "We have
identified a total of 10 victims in a few years in Oxnard.... He is
still out there and in position to ruin the lives of Mexican
children. Our goal is prevention first, and maybe justice someday."</TE>
<TE>   The men only recently confided the abuse to each other, they say.
All are identified in the lawsuits as Juan Doe.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me he was painting this Christ rising for Easter Sunday,"
said one of the men. "He was an artist and needed a model. He
arranged for me to leave school and in the upper sacristy he asked me
to disrobe.... I remember in my mind thinking, 'How does my body
compare to the body of Christ?' I think I was a seventh-grader."</TE>
<TE>   The man, now 35, alleges that Silva took photographs of him naked
and then committed a sex act, saying he needed the photographs for a
sex education class.</TE>
<TE>   The man was allegedly molested from 1979 to 1983, the suit
alleges.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Drivon, a Stockton attorney also representing the eight men,
said Silva was "sent to a dump ground for predator priests in
Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   Silva, also known as Silva Flores, could not be reached in Mexico
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   However, in a TV interview aired this week with Joel Grover, a
CBS-2 reporter, Silva denied he sexually abused his accusers.</TE>
<TE>   Silva is a member of Missionaries of the Holy Spirit, a small
Mexico-based order that provides services to bilingual parishes.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Deems, an attorney for the order, said a letter from Anderson
a few weeks ago was the first notice the order had received about
abuse allegations against Silva..</TE>
<TE>   Deems said an adult in 1995 complained of sexual misconduct
allegedly committed by Silva the year before.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese required the order to investigate the allegation.
It determined Silva did not commit a crime, Deems said, but because
of the "appearance of impropriety" he was removed from his
assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "He was removed from his pastoral assignment and relocated back to
Mexico," Deems said. Silva took a leave of absence and underwent
"some counseling" and then was assigned to a retreat in San Luis
Potosi, Mexico. He is permitted to say Mass and hear confessionals,
Deems said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Los Angeles on Thursday, a 37-year-old former altar
boy at Boyle Heights Church said he has reported to police that he
was molested by a priest who was known for his work with Eastside
gang members.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzo Najera alleged that Father John Santillan molested him
during the late 1970s, when Najera was age 12 through 17, at Santa
Teresita Church.</TE>
<TE>   He alleged the priest abused him in an upstairs bedroom of the
church, during retreats in San Bernardino County and on a trip to
Europe. He sued the priest in 1998 but the civil case was dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Santillan has been assigned to a parish in Bolivia since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "What proof does he have?" said Santillan when reached by La
Opinion newspaper in the town of Cochabamba in Bolivia.</TE>

<LD>Authorities across Orange County went on heightened alert Thursday,
scouring hundreds of playgrounds with metal detectors after sheriff's
deputies uncovered more than 50 razor blades and nails hidden around
a Laguna Niguel park, the fourth city to be hit in the last year.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives believe there is a link between the razors discovered
at the Laguna Niguel park and those found Sunday at the playground of
Main Beach in Laguna Beach.</LD>
<LD>   In response, Sheriff Michael S. Carona ordered deputies and
rangers to sweep 250 South County parks for signs of more sharp
objects. No one has been injured, but the incidents have parents and
children in the surrounding areas on edge.</LD>
<TE>   "This is an act of domestic terrorism," Laguna Beach Police Capt.
Danell Adams said. "It makes people retract, refrain and get enclosed
in their homes. It's a sick mind."</TE>
<TE>   The discovery has had just that effect on residents near the small
Laguna Niguel neighborhood playground that was roped off Thursday
with police tape.</TE>
<TE>   "We're afraid to take the kids to the park now," said Mina
Kuwahara, 66, as she picked up her three grandchildren at a bus stop
a few blocks away. "It is just horrible."</TE>
<TE>   The first wave of razor findings occurred a year ago at six parks
in Costa Mesa and Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Police set up elaborate undercover surveillance operations at
several parks, with officers instructed to get out of their cars and
check the playgrounds every hour. They also used bloodhounds to trace
the scent of the blades. But the efforts failed to catch any
suspects.</TE>
<TE>   When the attacks stopped by the end of last May, police still had
no idea whether they were the work of adults or children.</TE>
<TE>   Then razors began appearing again last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   It started at 4 a.m. Sunday, when Laguna Beach police received an
anonymous call from a young woman warning that some friends--eight
males and possibly a female--were going to do something at Main Beach
to hurt people.</TE>
<TE>   Officers searched the beach but found nothing unusual at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Four hours later, a resident at Laguna Beach's Main Beach
playground noticed razor blades on the ground of the tot lot. He then
turned up 17 razor blades partially buried in the sand there.</TE>
<TE>   Police closed the park temporarily to scan the sand with a metal
detector and turned up one more blade.</TE>
<TE>   "The razors had been strategically placed," Laguna Beach Police
Sgt. Jason Kravetz said. "There's a chance that we could definitely
solve this case with [the help of] the person who originally called
us. But the frustration is that she has failed to contact us again.
She seems to be the key."</TE>
<TE>   As Laguna Beach police waited for the woman to call, Joe Kiani
brought his 18-month-old daughter Kayla to the small "view park" in
the Marina Hills community in Laguna Niguel at 6:30 a.m. Thursday, a
daily ritual for the two.</TE>
<TE>   The park sits atop a hill with a sweeping canyon view in a quiet
community of large tile-roofed houses and townhomes. It is so far out
of the way, residents say, that nobody uses the place except children
who live in the 1,500-home development.</TE>
<TE>   While Kayla played in the wood chips on the ground of the park,
her dad noticed something shiny sticking up from the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "I quickly took her away and started picking up razors," he said.
"There were about a dozen.</TE>
<TE>   "I called my wife and told her to call the police," Kiani said. "I
have no idea what these people were thinking. Whoever did this
doesn't have any children."</TE>
<TE>   The razors Kiani spotted are the same type that surfaced in Laguna
Beach, a common brand that can be purchased at hardware stores.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say this week's incidents followed a similar pattern
to last year's, though they are not sure if the same person is
responsible in all four cities. In all cases, razor blades were
placed in similar areas of the playground: at the end of slides, on
the stairway up to the slide and play area, and at the bottom of the
slides.</TE>
<TE>   "We're taking this very seriously," said George Jaramillo,
assistant county sheriff. "It's a sick thing to do and a stupid thing
to do."</TE>
<TE>   He urged parents to remain vigilant and supervise their children
at parks while deputies patrol and continue to scour the parks daily
with metal detectors, but he cautioned against overreacting.</TE>
<TE>   "It is worthy of a response to check things out and let people
know it's happening," Jaramillo said. "Anything beyond that creates
hysteria that just feeds into what some sick individual wants to
create."</TE>
<TE>   But some parents remain unconvinced and said they intend to bring
their children only to parks where there is a security patrol, like
Laguna Niguel Regional Park, which costs $2 to enter.</TE>
<TE>   Kids say they are nervous too.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to go to the park now," said Mackenzie Andelin, 10,
who had been a frequent visitor to the Laguna Niguel playground where
the nails and razors surfaced Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "My family used to go there every Sunday," she said. "This is not
fair to the kids."</TE>

<HD>Delgadillo Proposes High-Rise Safety Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles skyscraper owners can do little to prevent a major
terrorist attack, but they can better prepare themselves and their
tenants to respond to such a crisis, according to a new study
released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In response, City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo proposed an ordinance
that would mandate drills, response plans and specially trained
officials in every high-rise building.</LD>
<LD>   "All of us understand that more practice is a good thing and
practicing evacuations has proven to be very successful," he said.
"It's certainly something we need to move forward on right away,
rather than waiting for a lot of public discourse on it."</LD>
<TE>   In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast,
the city attorney's office, along with other public officials and
private entities, commissioned the Rand Corp. to study how to protect
Los Angeles high-rises. The city is home to more than 800 high-rise
buildings. Eighteen downtown are more than 500 feet tall, and one
tops 1,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Rand analysts concluded that L.A. appears to be less at risk than
some other areas but that the city nevertheless presents
opportunities for those seeking to do harm.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of the kinds of major icons of power and hegemony that
the terrorists seemed to be targeting on Sept. 11, those things are
largely concentrated in cities back east, and in Washington and New
York in particular," said Jack Riley, director of Rand's public
safety and justice research program. "Another factor that [works] in
Los Angeles' favor is we don't have the same kind of concentration
and population. We're so spread out."</TE>
<TE>   Because so many types of attacks could be launched against
buildings, Rand officials recommended that owners concentrate their
efforts on response measures.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, authorities suggested that managers review
evacuation plans to make sure they take into account lessons learned
from the Sept. 11 tragedy. They also recommended updating threat
assessments, maintaining understandable protocol, educating tenants
and installing a mix of security features, from special landscaping
to high-tech devices.</TE>
<TE>   The study also recommended that government require or provide more
training for high-rise occupants about emergency preparedness. And it
suggested that the city and county make public buildings strong
examples of security, provide oversight to private security firms,
establish guidelines for reporting suspicious activity, and pay for
research and evaluation of security measures.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo said that after the 1993 bombing at the World Trade
Center, evacuation took six hours. After the terrorist attack last
year, evacuation took 58 minutes, and 99% of the people below where
the planes hit the towers survived.</TE>
<TE>   "That's attributable, in part, to all of the drilling and practice
that occurred after 1993," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To make Los Angeles' high-rise occupants equally well-prepared,
Delgadillo proposed a new city law Thursday morning that would
require owners of all buildings greater than 75 feet tall to:</TE>
<TE>   * File an emergency plan with the Fire Department every six
months.</TE>
<TE>   * Have a fire safety director and floor wardens who receive annual
training.</TE>
<TE>   * Have occupants certified as community emergency response team
members, with one member for every 500 building occupants.</TE>
<TE>   * Perform evacuation drills at least twice a year.</TE>
<TE>   * Require certain fire and safety personnel to be on site from 7
a.m. to 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Violations of the provisions would be misdemeanors under the
proposed ordinance, which requires approval by the mayor and City
Council.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is expected to be introduced today or next week.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Burbank man, who police believe may have been under the influence
of a controlled substance, was arrested Thursday in a series of
hit-and-run accidents on Cahuenga Boulevard that left one person dead
and two others injured, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Karl Matthisen, 39, faces numerous charges, including vehicular
manslaughter, in the death of Elizabeth Alboyadjian, 50, of Glendale,
whose car was allegedly struck by his vehicle, said Det. Ken Grik of
the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   The first accident occurred about 10:10 p.m. Wednesday near
Universal City, when Matthisen allegedly rear-ended a Honda Civic on
Cahuenga Boulevard near Regal Place, Grik said. The Honda driver had
minor injuries.</LD>
<TE>   Matthisen continued southeast along Cahuenga Boulevard and
allegedly hit two more cars from behind as they were stopped at a
traffic light near Universal Center Drive. A 30-year-old Los Angeles
woman complained of neck and back injuries and was taken to a local
hospital, Grik said.</TE>
<TE>   As he approached Woodrow Wilson Drive, Matthisen allegedly crossed
over the double yellow lines and headed into oncoming traffic,
hitting Alboyadjian's older-model Mercedes-Benz, Grik said. She died
at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Matthisen had minor injuries. He was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center for treatment and arrested there Thursday, Grik said.</TE>

<HD>Slaying Suspect Ordered to Trial</HD>
<DH>Simi Valley: Kidnapping and attempted rape charges stand in
case of college student shot in her car. Confessed killer Vincent
Sanchez could face death penalty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Simi Valley handyman who admitted gunning down a 20-year-old
college student with an assault rifle last summer was ordered
Thursday to stand trial on charges of murder, kidnapping and
attempted rape.</LD>
<LD>   Vincent Sanchez, 31, could face the death penalty if convicted of
murder and allegations that the killing occurred during an abduction
and sexual assault.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorneys conceded during a preliminary hearing in Ventura
County Superior Court that Sanchez fatally shot Moorpark resident
Megan Barroso and dumped her body in a ravine.</LD>
<TE>   But they urged Judge Ken Riley to throw out the kidnapping and
rape charges, arguing the district attorney's evidence was too weak
to proceed to trial.</TE>
<TE>   Riley agreed there was insufficient evidence of rape, but ordered
Sanchez to stand trial on suspicion of attempted rape.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very pleased," said Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Lela
Henke-Dobroth, who argued that Sanchez was a serial rapist who tried
to add Barroso to his list of victims.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez faces multiple life prison sentences after admitting to
raping and assaulting nearly a dozen women in Simi Valley during a
string of prowler-style attacks between 1996 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Deputy Public Defender Neil Quinn told reporters that his
client is ready to settle the Barroso case by pleading guilty to
murder, but not the related allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "He is ready to take responsibility for what he did," Quinn said.
"He cannot ever give that life back, but he is prepared to spend the
rest of his life in prison."</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors, who decided to seek the death penalty after
reviewing Sanchez's criminal history, say they have no interest in a
plea bargain and are ready to proceed to trial.</TE>
<TE>   "He clearly is the type of individual who it is appropriate to
seek the death penalty for," Henke-Dobroth said. "That is our
position and it will remain our position."</TE>
<TE>   Barroso's bullet-riddled car was found abandoned near a freeway
overpass in Moorpark in the early morning hours of July 5. Her
remains were recovered a month later in a canyon near Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Ballistic evidence showed six shots were fired at close range from
a high-powered rifle, and casings were later matched to an AK-47
assault rifle seized from the defendant's house in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The coroner determined that Barroso, a Moorpark Community College
student, died from a gunshot to the abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   During the preliminary hearing, prosecutors argued that Sanchez
shot up the car, then abducted and sexually assaulted Barroso before
she died. They noted that Barroso was found wearing only a T-shirt
and panties and argued that Sanchez's prior sex crimes were evidence
of a propensity to stalk and rape women.</TE>
<TE>   But defense attorneys called the prosecution theory illogical and
inconsistent. In the prior rape cases, Sanchez studied his victims
and carefully planned the attacks, cutting phone lines and unscrewing
porch lights before slipping into victims' homes through windows or
unlocked doors. According to court testimony, he wore gloves and ski
masks and usually used a knife to subdue his victims.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn said Barroso's shooting was different--a sudden encounter
with an assault rifle. If Sanchez had wanted to rape Barroso, the
lawyer suggested, he would not have used lethal force.</TE>
<TE>   "That is no way to accomplish a rape," he told Riley.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn further argued that prosecutors presented no physical
evidence to support an attempted rape charge. Although Barroso was
found unclothed, her body was so decomposed that the coroner could
not determine whether a sexual assault had occurred.</TE>
<TE>   And Quinn questioned whether Barroso may have been unconscious or
dead at the time of the alleged kidnapping and sexual assault given
the lack of evidence of a struggle inside the car.</TE>
<TE>   Although those arguments did not persuade the judge to throw out
the kidnapping and attempted rape charges, Quinn said prosecutors
will have a tougher time convincing a jury.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very mindful that at a preliminary hearing the standard of
proof is low compared to the standard at trial," he said. "I don't
think a jury would logically convict."</TE>
<TE>   However, given Sanchez's notoriety as a serial rapist, Quinn said
he worries a jury could convict based solely on emotions. It is one
reason he intends to argue for a change of venue before trial.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the murder and kidnapping charges, Sanchez is
charged with six felony counts involving alleged attacks on five
other women.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn conceded in his closing arguments that Sanchez committed a
1999 carjacking as part of a sexual assault on a 20-year-old Simi
Valley woman. But he disputed two other alleged carjackings, arguing
that there is no evidence the victims were in possession of their
vehicles at the time they were taken.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn also disputed allegations that his client attempted to run a
Simi Valley woman off the road during a high-speed freeway chase in
October 2000. The woman testified during the preliminary hearing that
Sanchez tried six times to ram her car with his white truck as she
drove home from work one night.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend Sanchez was trying to run down a potential sex
assault victim during that episode. They charged him with attempted
kidnapping and assault with a deadly weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Riley found sufficient evidence to order Sanchez to stand trial on
those counts as well. A trial date is expected to be set May 13.</TE>

Highway officer.</LD>
<LD>   A Superior Court jury convicted Christopher Merrick, 22, of felony
hit-and-run and gross vehicular manslaughter in the Oct. 28, 2000,
death of Officer Sean Nava. But the jury acquitted Merrick of

<HD>D.A. Search Shuts Down Legal Newspaper in L.A.</HD>
<DH>Probe: Paper's owner assails Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley as
investigators look for business records related to South Gate's
recall election.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>District attorney's investigators armed with a search warrant shut
down the Los Angeles legal newspaper the Metropolitan News-Enterprise
for three hours Thursday, sending reporters and staff out to the
street, in a mission to obtain proof that a law firm paid for an ad
in the paper more than two months ago.</LD>
<LD>   Roger M. Grace, owner of the newspaper, said that after a
telephone conversation with Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve
Cooley and two subordinates, he agreed, once they gave the name of
the law firm, to turn over the business records requested and that
the closure ended when he did so.</LD>
<LD>   But Grace said the afternoon edition of his paper was delayed by
the closure, and he assailed Cooley for using "exceedingly poor
judgment and failing to realize how abhorrent a newsroom search would
be to our 1st Amendment rights."</LD>
<TE>   A few hours later, Cooley issued a statement saying, "The
Metropolitan News was closed due to the initial refusal by a
co-publisher of the newspaper to cooperate" with a broad-ranging
investigation into a recall election in South Gate.</TE>
<TE>   "This search had nothing to do with 1st Amendment rights," Cooley
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The district attorney's office did not search the newsroom of the
Metropolitan News," Cooley said. "This was a focused and narrow
search. We were only requesting business documents for one
transaction."</TE>
<TE>   But Grace said that he had been told the search could last as long
as three days, all for the origins of a tiny ad Feb. 21 giving notice
of intent to circulate recall petitions in a small suburban city.</TE>
<TE>   Grace said a Cooley aide had told him reporters' desks would be
searched if necessary to find the advertising records.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had good relations with Mr. Cooley in the past," Grace said.
"During our conversation, he offered to settle this over dinner. But
now I don't think he's the kind of man I would like to go to dinner
with."</TE>
<TE>   Experts on the 1st Amendment expressed concern at what happened.</TE>
<TE>   USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky called the episode "enormously
troubling" given recent statutes severely limiting newsroom searches.</TE>
<TE>   Alonzo Wickers, a leading Los Angeles media attorney, observed, "I
think it was a lot of bullying. They cleared the newsroom, disrupting
operations, threatening to keep everyone out for three days.</TE>
<TE>   "And they did this to a small newspaper," Wickers added. "I don't
believe there's any possibility they would have attempted this with
the L.A. Times. I believe this was illegal and completely
inappropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Grace and Cooley agreed that there had been discussions going back
two or three weeks over the district attorney's demand that the
newspaper turn over the records that would prove the Los Angeles law
firm of Albright, Yee &amp; Schmit had paid for the recall petition ad.</TE>
<TE>   Grace said, however, that initially Cooley's office would not
acknowledge that the district attorney knew the name of the firm and
that the Metropolitan News felt it would compromise its private
business relationship if it divulged it.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he said, when it turned out that Cooley knew what law
firm it was, there was no point in refusing to turn over the
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley's statement asserted that investigators had been assured
two weeks ago "we would have full cooperation" with providing a legal
document requesting the material and that Grace had initially reneged
Thursday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Grace called that a misstatement of the facts.</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday afternoon, the district attorney's office faxed to
news reporters a list of what was finally obtained from the
Metropolitan News office. It included "three-page copies of the
original [advertising] invoice [from] the first desk, first row [and
a] two-page faxed document taken from second desk, second row, north
side."</TE>
<TE>   The Metropolitan News has a circulation of about 2,500 and a staff
of 55 in its downtown office, Grace said.</TE>

<HD>Revised Budget Buoys Harbor City Viability</HD>
<DH>Breakup: Secessionists' new plan achieves some savings by
contracting with county--instead of Los Angeles--for police, fire and
other services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Secessionists determined to cleave the harbor area from Los Angeles
submitted a revised budget plan Thursday that shows the proposed city
would be financially healthy, a key requirement for placing harbor
independence on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The new budget comes as the harbor secession drive nears a moment
of truth. Next week, the state commission charged with reviewing
secession will issue its final report on a harbor city's viability.
Earlier reports found that such a city, with a population of 141,000,
would have to slash costs to stay afloat.</LD>
<LD>   But with help from fellow secessionists in the San Fernando Valley
and Hollywood, harbor independence backers on Thursday unveiled a
$101-million annual budget that depicts a thrifty municipal
government with a modest surplus.</LD>
<TE>   The blueprint has a harbor city saving money by contracting with
Los Angeles County, rather than the city of Los Angeles, for police
and fire protection, libraries and animal control. Hiring the county
Sheriff's Department instead of the Los Angeles Police Department
would save $15 million a year alone, according to the secessionists'
estimates. More savings would come from using private companies for
sanitation and park maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can make it onto the ballot based on these figures,"
said Andy Rafkin, head of the secession group Harbor Study
Foundation. "I'm still very optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   But Los Angeles City Councilwoman Janice Hahn, a secession
opponent who represents the harbor area, said the plan cuts vital
services. "I don't think this is the golden city that people are
expecting," she said. "It would hurt everything from our property
values to our public safety."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said the plan would lump a number of departments, including
emergency preparedness and disability services, into the city
manager's office. "The departments we have right now would be reduced
to one person's desk," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The harbor area's fate could have serious implications for the
secession efforts in the Valley and Hollywood. To win, each secession
measure must capture a majority of votes, both within the breakaway
region and citywide.</TE>
<TE>   If all three cityhood bids hit the November ballot, the theory
goes, each stands a better chance of winning citywide approval.</TE>
<TE>   "The more secession movements they can get onto the ballot at
once, the more people will vote yes," said Harvey Englander, a
campaign strategist who has worked in Los Angeles for 34 years. "It
also creates difficulties for the people fighting secession, because
now they've got to fight on three fronts."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the director of the Local Agency Formation Commission
gave Valley secession his virtual blessing, deeming it financially
feasible. Now the nine-member LAFCO board, the panel empowered by
state law to set secession elections, is slated to decide May 22
whether to place Valley cityhood on the Nov. 5 ballot. Decisions on
whether Hollywood and harbor secession should go on the ballot will
follow.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO Director Larry Calemine has yet to present his
recommendations on Hollywood, but earlier reports have indicated that
the area could survive financially as a city.</TE>
<TE>   The harbor area's prospects for financial independence have long
appeared shaky, however. In March, LAFCO found that Los Angeles
spends about $37 million more on harbor communities than the area
generates in tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   State Controller Kathleen Connell reviewed those findings and
concluded that the harbor area wouldn't be able to make ends meet.
Then, in another blow to cityhood, the state Lands Commission last
month voted against including the Port of Los Angeles in the proposed
city, denying it millions in revenue.</TE>
<TE>   But Calemine has indicated that harbor secessionists might not be
out of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Losing the port could have an upside, he said. That's because the
new city wouldn't have to spend any money policing, fighting fires or
providing other services at the port.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Calemine said he was not sure his final analysis--expected
to be released Wednesday--would result in favorable findings for a
harbor city.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor secessionists maintain that LAFCO unfairly judged their
initial proposal. The commission superimposed big-city budget data
over the region instead of envisioning a mid-sized town with a
bureaucracy to match, they say.</TE>
<TE>   It remains unclear whether LAFCO will support the new plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard some commissioners say that any city could be viable,
because there are some small cities that do survive, even with very
little revenue," said Craig Hoshijima, a consultant who helped LAFCO
analyze harbor cityhood.</TE>

<DH>South Gate: Federal and county investigators take documents
and computers from officials' homes and City Hall in fraud probe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 150 county and federal investigators fanned out across
South Gate on Thursday morning, serving search warrants at City Hall
and the homes of leading officials in the biggest show of force yet
against alleged political corruption there.</LD>
<LD>   For much of the day, City Hall teemed with about two dozen
blue-jacketed district attorney's investigators who scoured several
offices, aided by a joint FBI-Secret Service computer fraud task
force.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities, suspecting theft of public funds, seized numerous
documents, including financial statements and canceled checks. The
records focus on an attorney hired by the city, Clifton Albright, who
has been accused of using public funds to organize voter recall
drives against officials.</LD>
<TE>   Albright, in an interview, denied wrongdoing and criticized
investigators for seizing items from his downtown Los Angeles office.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad they would come to my home and office and take our
computers, because we are a law firm and South Gate is not our only
client," Albright said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Thursday's raid was one of the biggest in the
history of Los Angeles political corruption investigations. It
contrasted sharply with previous years, when watchdog groups charged
that the district attorney failed to investigate allegations of
official corruption. The search warrant affidavit cited 15 locations,
and numerous vehicles, to be searched by investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities, targeting officials suspected of being linked to
Albright, also served search warrants at the homes or offices of
Treasurer Albert Robles, Mayor Xochilt Ruvalcaba, Vice Mayor Raul
Moriel, Councilwoman Maria Benavides, City Atty. Salvador Alva,
acting City Manager Dennis Young and attorney Julia Sylva.</TE>
<TE>   The raid marked the latest round in several ongoing investigations
by federal and local authorities in the city of 96,000 residents in
southeast Los Angeles County. It created a now-familiar scene at City
Hall, with investigators searching through files, and officials
issuing denials to reporters as citizens hounded the officials' every
step.</TE>
<TE>   Setting up for a news conference in the council chambers, several
cameramen asked residents to identify the deputy city manager, Jesus
M. Marez, who was expected to make a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll be the one perspiring," said Pascual Cervera, an outspoken
critic.</TE>
<TE>   Marez complained that the district attorney's office conducted the
raid without warning. "Despite ... the potential disruption and
daunting prospect of numerous investigators descending on City Hall
this morning, we continue to work for the citizens of South Gate," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Liar!" several citizens screamed as the cameras rolled.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of the investigation is Albright, whose downtown Los
Angeles law firm, Albright, Yee &amp; Schmit, was hired last year to
handle labor and personnel issues for the city.</TE>
<TE>   A constant presence at public meetings, Albright has long been
criticized by Councilmen Hector De La Torre and Henry Gonzalez for
his billing practices. In the last six months, he has charged about
$1.2 million, and officials had long failed to meet requests by De La
Torre and Gonzalez for detailed information on Albright's work.</TE>
<TE>   This week, after the FBI subpoenaed all attorney and consultant
contracts in a separate investigation, officials finally provided
some billing details.</TE>
<TE>   In a rare public statement at Monday's regular City Council
meeting, Albright acknowledged accidentally duplicating billings of
$6,000, an admission that was met with a mocking swipe by De La
Torre.</TE>
<TE>   Albright insists that all his work was authorized by Young, the
acting city manager, and Alva, the city attorney, and points out that
he provided a comprehensive report on all of his work to the council
Monday. The probe seems to focus on allegations by Gonzalez and City
Clerk Carmen Avalos that Albright helped organize recall elections
against them.</TE>
<TE>   Avalos has told authorities that a messenger once tried to submit
recall papers with the letterhead of Albright's firm on the
documents. Realizing his mistake, the messenger withdrew the papers,
according to Avalos.</TE>
<TE>   Avalos, along with Gonzalez, later confronted Albright's
assistant, Cristeta Klaparda, in her City Hall office. "Cristeta had
a copy of the recall," Gonzalez said in an interview. "'Are you
involved in this recall?' I asked her, and she just got all nervous."</TE>
<TE>   Klaparda was not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Albright denies that his firm had anything to do with the recall
papers. "Our firm has not been leading any recall, and has not billed
the city in regards to those individuals," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's raid is the latest targeting city leaders
or their allies. Last month, Treasurer Robles was charged with making
murderous threats against public officials.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Ruvalcaba, as she has in the past, said the investigations
are politically motivated attacks. Investigators, she said, searched
her home and car for three hours and only seized a couple of items,
including a computer disk.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve Cooley should be ashamed of himself," she said of the
district attorney. "This is getting to the point where he is
harassing innocent people such as myself."</TE>
<TE>   But many others cheered the investigators, even shaking their
hands and patting them on the back as they walked through City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Marilyn Logan, a 36-year resident, was sleeping when friends
notified her of the raid by telephone.</TE>
<TE>   "I just jumped out of bed and flew over here," said Logan, who
spent much of the morning hounding city officials. "I think it's
fantastic."</TE>

<DH>Crime: Police are seeking more possible victims of tattoo
artist accused of molestation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investigators on Thursday sought more possible victims of a North
Hollywood tattoo artist who has pleaded not guilty to charges of
molesting two 16-year-old girls at his business.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Victor Rivas, 46, was arrested Tuesday on a felony warrant
alleging sexual assault on the girls after tattooing their lower
backs between May 2000 and March of this year, Det. Blair Grabiak of
the Los Angeles Police Department's North Hollywood Division said.</LD>
<LD>   "From a canvass of the area and talking to students at local high
schools, we have learned that Rivas had a reputation for tattooing
juveniles without checking them for an ID," Grabiak said. "More
victims may be out there."</LD>
<TE>   Rivas pleaded not guilty Wednesday to two felony counts of sexual
assault and five misdemeanor counts--two involving sexual battery and
three involving the tattooing of a person younger than 18, Deputy
Dist. Atty. Andrew Bassis said. Rivas faces five years in prison if
convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Rivas has owned Dr. John's Tattoos in the 6600 block of Lankershim
Boulevard for several years, usually working alone but occasionally
receiving help from his girlfriend, neighbors said. The tattoo
parlor, decorated with neon lights and a flaming dragon, is usually
busy and full of girls, the neighbors said.</TE>
<TE>   "The victims in these assaults were apprehensive about reporting
the assaults since they were under 18 years of age and did not have
their parents' permission," Grabiak said. Rivas is being held at the
Men's Central Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail. He is to appear in Van
Nuys Superior Court on May 13 for a preliminary hearing. Other
possible victims are asked to call detectives at (818) 623-4965.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Latino Teens Are More Sexually Active Than Peers</HD>
<DH>Promiscuity: Planned Parenthood study backs up state
finding of high birthrate among group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's Latino teens are more likely to be sexually active
and less likely to use birth control regularly than teens nationwide,
according to a Planned Parenthood study released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The survey dovetails with recently released state statistics that
show a high birthrate among teenage Latinos even as the state's teen
birthrate has dropped in the past decade.</LD>
<LD>   The family-planning organization hopes its study will lead to more
sex education in the county's schools.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a misperception that comprehensive sex education
encourages people to be more sexually active," said Jon Dunn,
president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Orange
and San Bernardino Counties. "Just saying no doesn't work. These
teens are already sexually active. It's an unrealistic expectation."</TE>
<TE>   Of 448 Orange County teens interviewed, 44% of the Latino males
were sexually active by age 14, higher than the national average of
30%. In addition, 35% of the Latino females were sexually active by
age 15, and 67% of Latino teens ages 13 to 19 have had sex. Both
figures are significantly higher than the national average. But only
48% of Latino teens use a condom every time they have sex, well below
the national rate.</TE>
<TE>   A recent study by the state Department of Health Services showed a
birthrate of 90 for every 1,000 teenage Latinos in the state,
compared with an average of 48.1.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County study showed that many teens responded to sex
education classes: 21.8% said they decided not to have sex when given
the opportunity after taking the classes, and 32.7% said they began
to use condoms.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a large, growing population of Latino teens who are
sexually active at a young age, with a lack of knowledge of where
they can go on these issues. It is very troubling," Dunn said.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn said Planned Parenthood will use the study to seek funding
for programs that target Latino youths. Planned Parenthood has been
allowed to bring its program into half a dozen schools in Orange
County, its officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Unified School District trustee Nadia Davis, who
appeared Thursday when the results were released, said she had
difficulty convincing other board members to support Planned
Parenthood.</TE>
<TE>   "There is this perception that Planned Parenthood is all about
abortion," she said. "There's a fear it's a controversial
organization, even among teens."</TE>
<TE>   But Anaheim Union High School District trustee Harald G. Martin
said more sex education is not needed.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had sex education in the schools for more than 25 years,
and I don't see that the message has gotten through," he said. "It's
up to parents to teach their children that they need to be
responsible if they want to be in a sexual relationship."</TE>

<HD>Seconds Make a Difference With Search Warrants</HD>
<DH>How much time should officers give suspects to come to the
door before breaking it down? With courts offering varied guidelines,
the answer remains unclear.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Open the door! Police search warrant!"</LD>
<LD>   Lashawn Banks, who had been taking an afternoon shower, said he
didn't hear the command. But he did hear the loud boom 15 to 20
seconds later, when officers used a battering ram to crack open his
apartment door.</LD>
<LD>   Officers found him in the hallway, naked and soapy, and seized
guns and cocaine in his North Las Vegas, Nev., apartment.</LD>
<TE>   Banks pleaded guilty to federal drug-related charges. Nearly four
years later, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco
voided the conviction, after ruling 2 to 1 that officers had not
given Banks enough time to respond to their request.</TE>
<TE>   How much time officers should give suspects to come to the door
before breaking it down is hotly debated in courts nationwide. And
with no specific time guidelines in place, the answer is basically
unclear.</TE>
<TE>   "Those seconds count," says Sheriff's Deputy Tim Carr, who trains
deputies in how to execute search warrants at the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Academy. "It's allowing someone to arm themselves" or
destroy evidence, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Those who challenge searches, meanwhile, invoke constitutional
privacy protections under the 4th Amendment, which prohibits
unreasonable searches and seizures.</TE>
<TE>   One thing all can agree on is that there is a lot at stake in this
debate.</TE>
<TE>   In cases where a judge can be convinced that not enough time
elapsed between the door knock and a forced entry, incriminating
evidence obtained in the search can be tossed out, making prosecution
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Cases at issue generally concern searches in which damage is done
to private property. If officers enter a home through an unlocked
door, for example, it is difficult to challenge the search on the
grounds that not enough notice was given.</TE>
<TE>   Another exception comes when knocking would endanger officers'
lives or allow a suspect to flee or evidence to be lost. Magistrates
in some states, though not in California, can even hand out
"no-knock" warrants if they agree in advance that it would be
dangerous or ineffective for officers to announce their presence .</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the mid-1990s that officers are
required under both common and constitutional law to knock and
announce their presence in most searches.</TE>
<TE>   But other than requiring knocking, the Supreme Court decided that
the framers of the Constitution did not intend for specific rules to
be established.</TE>
<TE>   Police officers must decide at the scene, after taking in a
variety of factors, such as the time of day and the size of the
residence and whether there are exigent circumstances. Later, judges
are often asked to rule on whether they were correct or incorrect.</TE>
<TE>   Because searches are reviewed on a case-by-case basis, one court
may approve a 10-second delayed entry while another may find it
unreasonable, depending on the circumstances officers faced.</TE>
<TE>   "The courts like the 'reasonableness' standard," says Charles
Whitebread, a USC criminal law professor. "Sadly, what I think they
don't consider is that it leaves the police confused as to what they
can do."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors in the Banks case have asked the appeals court for a
rehearing, arguing that the original panel's overturning of the
search goes against what other circuit courts across the country have
held.</TE>
<TE>   In the panel's decision, Justice Henry A. Politz wrote: "The
officers heard no sound coming from the small apartment that
suggested that an occupant was moving away from the door, or doing
anything else that would suggest a refusal of admittance."</TE>
<TE>   The officers, Politz continued, "were required to delay acting for
a sufficient period of time before they could reasonably conclude
that they impliedly had been denied admittance."</TE>
<TE>   The dissenting justice, Raymond C. Fisher, wrote that because the
apartment was small, the officers could have reasonably believed that
Banks heard them knocking and was refusing to open the door.</TE>
<TE>   Under those circumstances, "15 to 20 seconds is not an
insignificant amount of time to wait after a loud knock and
announcement. Knock, then count out the time to see for yourself,"
Fisher wrote.</TE>
<TE>   A survey of 9th Circuit decisions in the last few decades shows
how several searches fared under judicial scrutiny. In 1964, the
court upheld a search in which officers kicked down a house door five
seconds after they knocked. In that case, they saw through a window
an occupant of the house turn and run from them and heard "footsteps
running in the wrong direction."</TE>
<TE>   In August, on the other hand, the court found unreasonable a
five-second delay in an early morning search of a suspected drug
trafficker's apartment. The court ruled that the defendant, who shot
and wounded two officers in the belief he was being robbed, had not
been given enough time to ascertain who was at the door and respond
to the request to open it.</TE>
<TE>   While 15 to 20 seconds was deemed insufficient by the majority in
the Banks case, similar time lapses were upheld in two cases in the
1970s.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, the court upheld a search in which officers knocked,
heard scampering sounds and forced entry after waiting 10 seconds.
And in a 1974 case, it allowed a search in which federal narcotics
agents forced open the door of a Burlingame, Calif., resident 10 to
20 seconds after knocking and hearing a dog bark and some movement
within.</TE>
<TE>   Some legal observers say that, for the sake of uniformity, courts
should set specific standards.</TE>
<TE>   "One would think that some fixed period would be acceptable," such
as waiting at least 20 seconds unless there are suspicious sounds
coming from inside the residence, USC's Whitebread says.</TE>
<TE>   Yale Kamisar, a specialist in criminal procedure at the University
of Michigan Law School, agrees that guidelines are needed.</TE>
<TE>   "You ought to have a bunch of veteran police officers get together
and work out some rules and regulations," Kamisar says. "You don't
want to lose a case because you didn't wait long enough."</TE>
<TE>   Police say the results could be disastrous if they were
constrained by such rules while executing searches, which sometimes
turn into life-or-death situations.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that's a fair burden to put on the Police
Department," says Sgt. John Pasquariello, a Los Angeles Police
Department spokesman. "We don't stand there and look at our watches.</TE>
<TE>   "A few seconds might be reasonable, if it's a one-bedroom
apartment.... If it's a multistory, cavernous place [where] someone
might have to walk a long way to get to you, it might take a little
longer," he adds. "We have to base it on what we feel is reasonable
at the time. Then again, it can always be challenged in the court."</TE>

<HD>Teacher Held in Kidnapping</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police discover 33-year-old woman in a Las Vegas
hotel room with a 15-year-old boy from her science class. She faces
felony charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD and TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN BERNARDINO</DL>
<LD>A popular science teacher and her 15-year-old student, apparently
tangled in an intimate relationship that has equally captivated and
horrified their school, were discovered Thursday in a Las Vegas hotel
room where they had fled together, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Tanya Joan Hadden, 33, a Cajon High School teacher, and Richard
Pena, a 15-year-old freshman, were found by police investigators in a
room at the $39-a-night New Frontier Hotel &amp; Gambling Hall, where
Elvis Presley reportedly played his first Vegas gig in 1956.</LD>
<LD>   Hadden was arrested in Las Vegas on suspicion of first-degree
kidnapping for bringing a minor across state lines, and will be
charged in San Bernardino with the unlawful "taking" of a child, said
Lt. Frank Mankin of the San Bernardino Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   Both charges are felonies, and a school district official said
that Hadden will probably be placed on administrative leave while the
school conducts its own investigation, and then fired.</TE>
<TE>   The teacher also may face a charge of contributing to the
delinquency of a minor because authorities believe she may have
served alcohol to Pena and another male student at an April 26 party
in Rialto, said Lt. Kathy Thompson of the Rialto Police Department.
The investigation into that party--first reported to police by one of
the boys' sisters three days later--may have prompted the pair to
flee to Las Vegas, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Pena was in protective custody Thursday. Classmates and teachers
described him as a bright student and seemingly well-adjusted
teenager who was in Hadden's first-period science class,</TE>
<TE>   His parents, Herman and Ida Pena, were being escorted Thursday
night to the California-Nevada border to be reunited with their son,
a day after making a tearful plea for his safe return, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are looking into allegations that Hadden and Pena
had an improper relationship for at least five weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "First and foremost, we should not send our kids to a school where
they have to fear they may be abused by the teachers who are supposed
to be taking care of them," said Teresa Parra, a member of the San
Bernardino City Unified School District board. "If it's true, I hope
she never teaches again."</TE>
<TE>   As students tumbled out of Cajon High on Thursday afternoon, their
conflicted emotions tumbled out too.</TE>
<TE>   They referred to the teacher as "Miss Hadden," like they had every
morning in science class. But they also referred to her in the past
tense, as if she had vanished. They gleefully traded tawdry nuggets
of gossip.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, students needed little else to talk about, teachers
tried hard to stay above the fray and parents struggled for words
with their children.</TE>
<TE>   "My son graduates in June, so luckily we are out of here," said
Kim Brown, who lives behind the school in northern San Bernardino
amid rose gardens, Spanish-tile roofs, backyard barbecues and
basketball hoops in every other driveway. Brown was waiting to pick
up her son's girlfriend after school.</TE>
<TE>   "It just goes to show you that you can't be too careful with your
kids no matter where they go, even in school," she said. "You think
they're safe, other than the guns and the drugs."</TE>
<TE>   Brown's daughter graduated from Cajon High in 1996, and went on to
become a schoolteacher, and her son, Peter, a pitcher on the school
baseball team, is a senior.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember when I was in school," Kim Brown said. "The kids would
have a crush on the teacher. Not the other way around. What does a
15-year-old boy have to offer an adult?"</TE>
<TE>   It's far from the first time in Southern California, which has
shouldered more than its share of scandals involving teachers and
students over the years.</TE>
<TE>   The region was only peripherally involved in perhaps the
best-known case, when elementary school teacher Mary Kay LeTourneau
was found guilty of having sex with a sixth-grader.</TE>
<TE>   LeTourneau, who was 36 at the time, later gave birth to a daughter
and said the 13-year-old student was the father. LeTourneau,
sentenced to more than seven years in prison in 1997, is the daughter
of a former Orange County congressman.</TE>
<TE>   Many years earlier, a similar case captivated the Los Angeles
area. Fourteen-year-old Ellsworth "Sonny" Wisecarver, who eloped with
a 21-year-old mother of two in spring 1944, earned himself the
nickname "L.A. Lothario" and then, in Life magazine, "The Woo Woo
Boy, the world's greatest lover."</TE>
<TE>   Wisecarver's tale was turned into a movie, "In the Mood," starring
Patrick Dempsey, in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   The Hadden-Pena case is the second of its kind this year at Cajon
High. About two months ago, another female teacher, Linda Martinez,
left the school amid allegations that she was having a relationship
with a male student, Parra said. The student denied it and no charges
were filed, but the school board still terminated her, the school
official said.</TE>
<TE>   School officials insisted they have done all they can to screen
for these sorts of incidents, including background checks and
fingerprint tests.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what more we can do to stop something like this from
happening," said Barbara Wyatt, a school district spokeswoman. "We
don't want any improper relationship, but how much can you do to
avoid it?"</TE>
<TE>   Pena is a precocious teen who will raise his hand to answer a
teacher's question--provided he is sure he knows the answer, friends
said with a laugh--as he did while reading "Antigone" in a recent
English class.</TE>
<TE>   He is enrolled in a program called AVID, or Advanced Via
Individual Determination, a type of college preparatory program, said
classmate Danielle Holleman, 15, a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   Hadden was quite popular among students. Several recalled Thursday
that they enjoyed going to some of her science classes. The classes
were filled with educational games and exercises designed to
introduce classmates to each other--a necessary step in a school with
an estimated 3,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   Many students went to her classroom after school just to do
homework and hang out because it was more fun than going home, others
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most teachers kind of treat you like a robot," Holleman said.
"She wasn't like that. Some students do get close to teachers. If you
have problems at home, they can be someone to talk to. She was a good
person to talk to."</TE>
<TE>   Knowledge of a close relationship between Hadden and Pena appears
to have been common knowledge, many students said Thursday. Not only
were there widespread allegations about an intimate relationship, but
Hadden often drove Pena and his friends home after school.</TE>
<TE>   "You know how kids are," said 15-year-old Dale Caddell, a
sophomore, while pointing out that he will turn 16 in a matter of
days. "They feel like it's no big deal, and there is no use in
getting in trouble just because you suspect something. Next thing you
know, some kid disappears."</TE>
<TE>   Other students remained more surprised by the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "Not Miss Hadden!" said Jason Cruze, 16, a 10th-grader, upon
learning that the pair had been caught together in a Las Vegas hotel
room. "She was cool!"</TE>

<HD>A Reward Approach to N. Korea</HD>
<DH>Only societal change will yield genuine peace.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES E. GOODBY</AU>
<BD>James Goodby, a special representative of the president
for nuclear security and dismantlement during the Clinton
administration, is affiliated with the Center for Northeast Asian
Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The White House has announced that the North Korea government is
finally ready to sit down for talks with the Bush administration. But
the administration does not appear geared up to wage diplomacy on the
Korean peninsula. We need a multi-pronged approach that confronts the
political and economic issues in North Korea, as well as the military
threats. It is clear what the administration does not like about
North Korea: nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles and heavily armed
troops within range of Seoul, all made more ominous by the repressive
character of the North Korean regime.</LD>
<LD>   And over these threats looms another specter: North Korea's
erratic regime could give weapons of mass destruction to terrorist
groups such as Al Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   Removing these dangers is a high priority. Succeeding in doing so
will require a concerted and coherent U.S. strategy--one so far not
in evidence--pursued across a broad front for as long as it takes.</LD>
<TE>   North Korea's military threats are real, both in its conventional
component and in the dangers posed by its nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons programs. But the scope of U.S. strategic thinking
about North Korea should not be defined only by the military threats.
We also should try to induce societal change. Only that will yield
genuine peace. The regime in Pyongyang will resist it. It saw what
happened to East Germany. Still, the U.S. position should be to
reward North Korean policies that promote positive change. These are
likely to be in the economic sphere initially.</TE>
<TE>   To succeed in this ambitious overall agenda, Washington needs to
improve the process it uses to deal with North Korea. Deputy
Secretary of State Richard Armitage, while a private citizen, urged
that "the U.S. point person should be designated by the president in
consultation with congressional leaders and should report directly to
the president.... This step also aims to move the issue to the
highest possible level of decision-making in North Korea." He was
right.</TE>
<TE>   We also need a new policy track that focuses directly on the
threat of missiles and weapons of mass destruction. Previous attempts
have produced results. But they are running out of steam.</TE>
<TE>   It should not be impossible to get North Korea to end its missile
program. Pyongyang already has announced a missile flight-test
moratorium until 2003 and proposed giving up its long-range missile
program altogether if another country would launch its satellites.
China or Russia could do this.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has a well-tested method of encouraging
dismantlement of nuclear weapons. Three U.S. administrations and
successive U.S. Congresses have strongly supported the Nunn- Lugar
cooperative threat reduction program, which provides assistance for
weapons dismantlement and blocks the spread of weapons of mass
destruction. This program has been confined to the former Soviet
Union, but Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) has introduced a bill that
would expand it.</TE>
<TE>   Such a program in North Korea could be used to redirect
technological efforts to civilian purposes and to dismantle
facilities related to weapons of mass destruction. It could be used
to block North Korea's dangerous missile exports and its missile
development work.</TE>
<TE>   Our ally South Korea needs a new policy track to promote peace on
the Korean peninsula, and so does the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   In the near term this should consist of military measures to deal
with miscalculations by either side and to enhance crisis management.
Over the longer term, South Korea and the U.S. should move toward
achieving a stable balance, with reduced force levels that accentuate
nonoffensive postures and that reduce the heavy concentration of
North Korean firepower just north of the demilitarized zone. The
all-important context would be an eventual peace settlement, not a
demand for unilateral concessions.</TE>
<TE>   The outlook for this is not bright at the moment. But South Korea
and the U.S. should have a shared vision for achieving peace and
reunification, even if there were no prospect of negotiating with
North Korea, because our diplomatic campaign would be weakened if we
were not seen to be standing for something positive.</TE>

<HD>Le Pen's Ilk Preys on Fears About 'Unlikes'</HD>
<DH>France may be shocked again in Sunday's second round of
voting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANAN R. LURIE</AU>
<BD>Ranan R. Lurie, a senior adjunct fellow at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., is an
internationally syndicated columnist and political cartoonist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I remember Jean-Marie Le Pen from many years ago: We were both young
paratroop officers--boarding different planes, taking off in
formation for a jumping exercise. He was a regular of the French
"para" forces, and I was a foreign officer training with their crack
special forces. I didn't mingle with his crowd, but I remember
noticing him. He was popular among the guys, flaunting tremendous
bravado and natural, aggressive leadership. The soldiers followed him
with glee.</LD>
<LD>   "This guy's going to pull himself up and probably become the
commander of France's paratroopers," Maj. Pierre, my host in that
French special unit,   predicted. Little did he realize how much
then-Capitan Le Pen would shake France and Europe with his stunning
electoral showing years later.</LD>
<LD>   I have studied Le Pen, Joerg Haider of Austria and several other
far-right leaders and have concluded they should instead be called
far-right manipulators. All of them command with strikingly similar
characteristics--traits they were probably born with. They all have a
burning ambition and lust for power. And each possesses a sixth sense
about which issue is likely to inflict the most pain on his
constituency. Then, each one analyzes that issue or problem--the most
common is economic hardship or personal safety--and throws into the
ring the "solution."</LD>
<TE>   With Hitler it was the "Final Solution," and with Le Pen, as well
as Haider and the newly successful right-wing extremists in
Switzerland, Denmark and Holland, it is the "we're preparing a
solution" against new immigrants, especially Muslims. Anti-Semitism
is now virtually being replaced by anti-Islamism, but Europeans are
not yet aware of that.</TE>
<TE>   Let us not forget that Europe for the last 4,000 years has been a
very bad neighborhood. Only under Roman rule did Europe know some
relative calm. Before and after the Romans, all hell broke loose
because xenophobia was the name of the game, and the game's main rule
is "the dislike of the like toward the unlike." The more "unlike" you
are, the nastier the repercussions. The Jewish community in Europe
eventually learned this in the hardest way possible.</TE>
<TE>   During the last few decades, impressive numbers of "unlikes"
flooded Europe. The bulk were, and are, Muslims. For Europeans,
Muslims are perhaps the ultimate "unlikes" because they seem to
cherish their differences and even flaunt them.</TE>
<TE>   While we learned in America that the Italian, Irish or Norwegian
immigrant wishes so much to become an "American," the new Islamic
society in France, which now numbers more than 6 million, in recent
years built 1,550 mosques there. Muslims have established
neighborhoods that are entirely Arab, where residents dress in
traditional Muslim clothing, eat traditional North African foods and
mainly study the Koran and Arab history. They rarely make an effort
to mingle in French society or to adopt French history and tradition
as their own. They don't have even one member in the French
Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Capitan Le Pen, who jumped out of military planes at 2,000 feet,
is now gladly jumping into the depths of the fears of the French
blue-collar soul, and harps on them like a maestro.</TE>
<TE>   The wishful thinking of the French, voiced by this week's polls,
anticipates Jacques Chirac winning with 78% of the vote in Sunday's
second round, and Le Pen receiving only 22%. Considering all of the
above, France may be shocked again this Sunday: Le Pen may pull more
than 35% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   If France won't stop basking in its traditional "equality" slogans
and really do something about them, Le Pen's group and other parties
like his all over Europe will surprise all of us very much in
forthcoming elections.</TE>

<HD>For Mexican Americans, U.S. Interests Come First</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK OSIO Jr.</AU>
<BD>Patrick Osio Jr. of Chula Vista is editor of
HispanicVista.Com, a weekly online publication.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Juan Hernandez, head of Mexico's office for Mexicans abroad, has
remarked that Mexico wants the "whole enchilada"--amnesty for those
illegally in the United States as well as a guest worker program
allowing many more Mexicans in every year.</LD>
<LD>   But is the whole enchilada best for both Mexico and the U.S.?</LD>
<LD>   Does the U.S. need a guest worker program, and if so how many
workers? How would this affect employment among Mexican Americans?</LD>
<TE>   Hernandez estimates that there are 3.5 million Mexicans illegally
in the U.S. Since it was Mexico's inability to create economic
opportunity for all its citizens that created the need for so many to
migrate, what are Mexico's concrete plans to stop the continuing
waves of illegal immigrants?</TE>
<TE>   Or does the whole enchilada mean amnesty to those already here,
plus an additional 1.5 million Mexican guest workers he says the U.S.
needs each year?</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez seems to think that most of the 23 million Americans of
Mexican origin will support Mexico's "whole enchilada" concept. But I
think he is wrong.</TE>
<TE>   He may not understand that adult Mexican immigrants, like
immigrants from other countries, spend their life in the U.S.
referring to Mexico as "back home." But their "new" home and new life
are here. Their native language is Spanish; English, limited or
fluent, is their second language.</TE>
<TE>   But their children are no longer immigrants; their reference to
"home" is their U.S. place of birth and childhood. The newer
generations no longer feel a part of Mexico, though they retain some
of the inherited culture and language in varying degrees.</TE>
<TE>   They may feel Mexican, but as a culture: Latino, Chicano or
however they choose to identify their roots. They feel no allegiance
or obligation to Mexico, even as they care for its humor, food,
soccer, boxing, music, fiestas, tequila and other aspects of its
culture.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez has been traveling throughout the U.S., meeting with
members of Mexican American organizations. He is received warmly and
supported in his quest to improve the lot of Mexican immigrants who
still are Mexican citizens. Hernandez has suggested that Mexican
Americans invest in Mexico's economic development to create jobs and
better the situation. The idea is well received and underway to some
degree.</TE>
<TE>   But Hernandez should understand that the first responsibility of
all those Mexican American organizations is to their community here
in the U.S. Yes, they support the idea that Mexican nationals should
be able to get driver's licenses, with the mandate to carry liability
insurance. They understand that children brought here illegally by
their parents are not themselves illegal immigrants but undocumented
immigrants, so they support educational benefits for the children.</TE>
<TE>   They support allowing those children, who know no life other than
the one in the United States, to apply for citizenship. And they
defend the legal, civil and constitutional rights of all, including
those here illegally from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   But if Hernandez believes that U.S. citizens of Mexican heritage
will support ideas or programs not in the best interest of their
country, the United States, he might find that Mexican Americans
prefer burritos over enchiladas.</TE>

<LD>Stephanie Raygoza was riding a scooter back and forth in front of her
Boyle Heights home when, down the street, tires screamed. A van full
of young men, who police say were out for payback because a rival
gang had tagged their turf with graffiti, started blasting. The
gunfire killed a 19-year-old in a driveway. One bullet ricocheted
into the 10-year-old girl.</LD>
<LD>   The neighbors had seen shootings before. As Stephanie's father
lifted his daughter, the growing crowd shouted advice: Pick her up.
Leave her still. Even now many recall the father, stooping and
straightening, stooping and straightening, eyes blank with shock.</LD>
<LD>   With Stephanie's death, the neighbors said, "Enough."</LD>
<TE>   After dropping for seven years, gang killings began to climb in
2000. Remembering the bloody days of a decade back, when gang battles
in Los Angeles County killed 803 in one particularly bad year, some
neighborhoods are finding new courage and tenacity to stand up to
these home-grown oppressors.</TE>
<TE>   One, just east of downtown, is distinguished by aging public
housing projects, the poorest church in the Los Angeles Archdiocese
and at least three rival gangs that, until that evening in October
2000, shared turf with a fifth-grade girl who dreamed of becoming a
teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Even before cross-fire killed Stephanie, dozens of Boyle Heights
residents had begun marching each Friday night, defiant proselytizers
for peace. After her death, the number of protesters swelled to
hundreds. Neighbors who had never met, in part because their fear of
gangs kept them indoors, started talking. And started pushing.</TE>
<TE>   We need speed bumps, they told the city. Give us three months,
came the reply. The neighbors took pillows and blankets and bedded
down in the streets. Raised asphalt humps went in a week later,
slowing the cars that might harbor murderous boys and men.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood asked to barricade an alley used as a drug market
and getaway route. We need the permission of the people who live next
to it, the bureaucrats said. In just three days neighbors gathered
190 signatures.</TE>
<TE>   Two dozen residents, mainly women, signed up for leadership
training from the neighborhood Catholic church, Dolores Mission, and
the nonprofit Pacific Institute for Community Organization. Their
neighbors began to call them los lideres, the leaders. "We learned
how to build, how to work, how to create a new community," Arturo
Lopez said. "For Stephanie, and all the people who died."</TE>
<TE>   The gangs kept shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The leaders set a new goal: Form a partnership with the Los
Angeles Police Department's Hollenbeck Division, which patrols the
area. "I have never seen an officer get out of his patrol car and go
talk to a resident," said community organizer Mario Fuentes. More
than 500 residents crowded into the church in November to meet with
Chief Bernard C. Parks. The leaders asked for a yearlong pilot
project that would help cops work more closely with the neighborhood,
on foot and bicycles. Activist Rita Chairez recalls a conversation in
which an officer said, "If you have it, other people are going to
want it." Her reply: "Well, yeah!"</TE>
<TE>   Parks pledged his support. But now, with a nudge from Mayor James
K. Hahn, he's leaving, continuing the endless rotation of decision
makers that has frustrated the community for years. Last week, the
mayor announced an anti-gang initiative that would put 100 more
police officers on the streets. Now he needs to name an initiative
director who can bring the cops together with neighborhoods like this
one.</TE>
<TE>   The people stirred to action by Stephanie's death deserve the city
at their side. The homicide count in the Hollenbeck Division already
stands at 23, and it's only May. How many more children will young
gangsters murder before adults with the power to change this city
forcefully intervene?</TE>

<HD>A Loss in Musharraf's 'Win'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the better photographs to emerge from what Pakistan is trying
to pass off as a legitimate referendum was of a billboard drawing of
President Pervez Musharraf on horseback. Ah yes, the age-old portrait
of the man on a horse, riding in to save the nation.</LD>
<LD>   The image may have been heroic, but the campaign for this
self-called referendum on his presidency was not. Gen. Musharraf
diminished himself in this effort to gain five more years as
president.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistan's history since independence in 1947 has been split
almost evenly between rule by military dictators and corrupt but
democratically elected civilian governments. Many Pakistanis hoped
Musharraf would improve the economy of a desperately poor nation and
dampen violence between different Muslim sects after ousting Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif in a 1999 bloodless coup.</LD>
<TE>   He has made some progress, especially since Sept. 11. Musharraf
sided with the United States decisively in the fight against the
Taliban in next-door Afghanistan, even though Pakistan had been the
prime sponsor of the Taliban. He has spoken out against Islamic
radicals within Pakistan, banned several of their organizations and
jailed about 2,000 of their members. He promised the restoration of
democracy and scheduled parliamentary elections for October.</TE>
<TE>   But the general originally seen as a plain-talking soldier now
appears the crafty politician bent on personal power. He has insisted
that Parliament will serve at his pleasure, banned Sharif and another
former prime minister from running for office and released many of
the militants he had jailed.</TE>
<TE>   Only Musharraf appeared on the ballot in a yes-or-no vote he was
certain to win. Even so, ballots were by all accounts rigged to
inflate the turnout and margin of approval.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf would do better by his nation if he served one more
year, not five, and promoted a constitutional change to return more
power to the elected Parliament. Then he could run for Parliament
himself instead of presiding over another chapter of rule by
strongman.</TE>

<HD>New Doors to Andean Trade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long-stemmed roses, auto parts and asparagus. Smack and crack.</LD>
<LD>   The first three products are among those that the Andean Trade
Preference Act encourages people in four South American countries to
export to the United States. The other two products, made from opium
poppies and cocaine derived from coca plants, are surely in a bit
shorter supply here as an indirect result of the act.</LD>
<LD>   "The program works," Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle recently
said of the modest but effective international trade program, which
lowers tariffs on certain products from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador
and Peru.</LD>
<TE>   He's right. The U.S. is the leading export market for each of
these countries, and two-way trade has increased dramatically, from
$9.2 billion in 1992 to almost $18 billion in 2000. The act has
helped these countries spur legitimate economic development and aided
the troubled region's democracies.</TE>
<TE>   When the act, passed in 1991, lapsed late last year, the Bush
administration offered a temporary relief measure. That expires May
16. We urge the U.S. Senate to follow the lead of the House of
Representatives, President Bush and Sen. Daschle and embrace
legislation by Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) to renew the act. With its
proposed enhancements it would add apparel and a handful of other
products to the list subject to the lower tariffs.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. textile industry opposes the bill, arguing that it could
drive U.S. jobs abroad. Graham and a coalition of moderate
Republicans and Democrats, including Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.),
Charles Hagel (R-Neb.) and Mike DeWine (R-Ohio), counter that the
bill would merely offer equal opportunity so the Andean countries
could compete with Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean in
trading with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Andean trade pact is presently a missing component in
the United States' significant commitment to a region where drug
dealers are major employers and armed rebellion has never stayed
dormant for long.</TE>
<TE>   Increased trade means increased opportunities for the peasants.
And increased stability in the hemisphere.</TE>

<LD>Re "Last Chance for Amtrak," editorial, April 30: I do not understand
how Amtrak "lost" $1.1 billion in 2001. Actually, Amtrak spent that
amount, which was one-fifth of what was provided for highways and 15
times less than what was given to airlines. It was not enough to
maintain and improve service because over the years Congress has
refused to provide the funds and has the wrongheaded idea that Amtrak
must be profitable.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. is the only major country in the world expecting its
nationwide railroad system to be profitable. Railroad passenger
service is essential and should be fully subsidized by the federal
and state governments and an assessment on railroad freight service.</LD>
<LD>   Passenger fares are not cheap, but prices must continue to be
reasonable or the crowds won't come. Compared to the trillions spent
on interstate, other highways and airline subsidies since the end of
World War II, national passenger service has been cut to the point of
erosion of safety. Yet people still take the train, and more are
doing so each year. This, in spite of station closings,
inconveniences and the need for continued roadway improvement.</LD>
<TE>   I wish David L. Gunn, the new president of Amtrak, the best of
luck in not only streamlining management but in selling Congress on
the necessity of a superior railroad passenger service and the
billions necessary to provide it.</TE>
<TE>   Michael V. Allen</TE>
<TE>   Hawthorne</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Just six months after our nation's airports are shut down from
coast to coast and fear of flying reaches new heights, how can we
even consider defunding Amtrak? Especially the cross-country routes?
Just the opposite: Investment in America's passenger rail system
should be increasing.</TE>
<TE>   Our passenger trains are not only America's heritage but also an
essential part of its vital infrastructure. The trains not only move
people safely and efficiently, they represent the peace of mind that
public transportation can't be brought to a standstill by 19 fiends
with box cutters.</TE>

<LD>Re "Police Resistance to Gutting DARE Program Angers Panel," April
30: Deputy Chief J.I. Davis claims that "DARE has a very positive
role." I defy him to show how graduating from DARE courses results in
any lessening of drug use, the stated purpose for the DARE program.
DARE supporters have lots of bluster but no facts. Are we funding the
wrong programs? Marijuana use among young people in the Netherlands
(without DARE) is half that of the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   DARE is much like forfeiture laws, which serve to buy fancy cars
and other gadgets but do not reduce drug use. Supporters say that
"DARE improves school safety by bringing officers to campuses and is
also a valuable officer recruitment tool." How true. However, schools
are to provide a learning environment, not a recruitment site for the
police. The 71 DARE officers would serve as better recruitment tools
out in the community. The DARE budget should be diverted to treatment
programs that have been shown to reduce drug use.</LD>

<LD>Re "Teachers Protest Dress Code," May 1: As a parent of a junior high
student and two elementary students, I am amazed by some of the
outfits teachers wear. Teachers are role models for the children in
their school and should dress neatly and professionally.</LD>
<LD>   Tennis shoes and jeans are great, but there are other comfortable
options. I don't think the men should have to wear a tie every day,
but they present a very professional appearance when they do. As for
the women, if the teachers can't get themselves together, how can
they help our children do so? Clothes don't make the teacher, but
they do set the tone.</LD>

<LD>Re "AIDS Scare at Tiny College Shakes Town," April 30: Privacy laws
prevented health officials from informing anyone of Nikko Briteramos'
infection. Probably the same laws that enabled the partner who
infected him. It's time our nation realizes that AIDS has never been
a gay or race issue and takes action to prevent the unnecessary death
sentences inflicted on these young adults. I hurt for the
individuals, the families and friends of all infected, because it
shouldn't have happened at all.</LD>

<LD>Re "Last-Minute Effort to Salvage Jenin Inquiry Fails," May 2: Why
did U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan advocate dropping the
investigation into the Jenin refugee camp? The power to perform such
inspections will be seriously compromised by doing so.</LD>
<LD>   The U.N. must be free to question actions taken by all sides in a
conflict--not just those of so-called rogue states. How can the U.N.
hope to enforce any future inspections when it willingly backs down
on this one?</LD>
<LD>   The U.N.-member nations need to remain united for peace with an
authority that's globally respected, or we could all just go home and
suspiciously eye the rest of the world from behind our fortresses.</LD>

<TE>   After it equated Zionism with racism at its anti-Semitic hate fest
last summer in Durban, South Africa--when the World Conference
Against Racism singled out Israel for condemnation yet failed to
denounce human slavery in Sudan or human rights abuses in a number of
other repressive regimes--the U.N. lost all claim to neutrality.
Likewise, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which reportedly has
allowed terrorists and their murderous infrastructures to fester and
grow in the refugee camp of Jenin that it funds and administers,
cannot be regarded as neutral.</TE>
<TE>   I applaud the Israelis' refusal to subject themselves to another
Durban--to a predetermined, condemnatory kangaroo court of the U.N.,
and I thank Annan for calling on the U.N. Security Council to stop
clamoring for a "probe" of Jenin.</TE>

<TE>   The U.S. is loudly talking of going to war with Iraq. That country
is ostracized and boycotted under the guise of not permitting U.N.
inspections. Israel does not like the makeup of the U.N. inspectors
of the Jenin massacre, makes a fuss, and the U.N. (and the U.S.) say
OK, let's forget it.</TE>
<TE>   How's that for another example of the double standard that the
world sees in the Arab-Israeli conflict?</TE>
<TE>   Richard A. Poedtke</TE>
<TE>   Vista</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For weeks now the media have been spreading the Palestinian
propaganda of "massacre" in Jenin. Thousands around the world have
jumped on the Israel-bashing bandwagon. And now the Palestinians have
been forced to tell the truth. Just as Israel has maintained, fewer
than 60 Palestinians were killed in Jenin, most of them armed gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   Where are the headlines? Where are the news articles stating that
the Palestinians lied? Where are the Arab spokespersons who so
vehemently denounced the "massacre"? I haven't seen them. Why? To
answer Annan: Yes, all the world can be wrong and Israel right.</TE>
<TE>   Tobi Ruth Love</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For a country with an excellent reputation for its military might
and prowess against terrorism, what was Israel thinking? Attacking a
refugee camp from helicopters, tanks and bulldozers is not using the
left or right side of the brain. What is a terrorist infrastructure?
Is it the 1972 Fiat or perhaps the home of a senior citizen? How is
this defeating terrorism? Destroying homes, arresting thousands,
killing hundreds will lead to a path of more terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to defeat terrorism you need to defeat the radicals
and gain the goodwill of the masses. If you defeat the radicals and
alienate the populace, you have only multiplied the problem. Recent
military actions defeated no one, arrested few, collected some small
arms and alienated the world from Israelis. Destruction of the
Palestinian Authority was a total success. The ministries of
Education, Public Works and Security have been destroyed. What next?
If the goal was to teach soldiers that their "neighbors" are subhuman
and can be starved, tortured, detained, curfewed, disrespected,
humiliated, robbed, vandalized and harassed, then the youth of Israel
have been tainted.</TE>

<HD>Health Insurance Parity for Mental Illness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Mental Health Parity Urged," April 30: I am grateful that
President Bush supports insurance parity for mental illness. In 1990,
I suffered a sudden onset of severe mental illness while working as a
civil engineer in Orange County. I started having hallucinations and
became very paranoid. I never used street drugs, and I was not
abusing alcohol. Simply put, something went chemically wrong with my
brain.</LD>
<LD>   I was stunned to learn that my company's insurance policy had an
exclusion clause that limited coverage for mental illness to a
lifetime benefit of $25,000. Within a few weeks of inpatient
hospitalization this sum of money was depleted, and I found myself
very sick and uninsured. Fortunately for me, I had previously served
as a U.S. Navy officer, so I was eligible for free treatment at the
West. L.A. Veterans Affairs hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Brain disorders are very real and require medical treatment as do
other physical illnesses.</LD>
<TE>   Frank C. Baron</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mental illness is an epidemic that affects millions of Americans
every year. Ignorance and stigma are the major barriers that prevent
individuals from seeking services in a timely manner, before they hit
"rock bottom." The mind is much more complex than a routine sprained
ankle, and it requires getting deep below the surface in treatment.
With the help of therapy and medication management, symptoms are
often reduced or removed. It is about time that our leaders see how
important it is to have mental health coverage made available under
basic medical coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Sonya Woods</TE>
<TE>   Torrance</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mental health parity deserves a good hard look, in all its
aspects. Let's take a look at who pays for it, for instance. The
field of mental health has long been known as a hotbed of fraud.
Psychiatrists or other providers bill for thousands of hours of
therapy that just plain never happened, and overmedication is
rampant.</TE>
<TE>   Who pays for this? The insurance companies, of course. And where
do they get the money to pay for it? From their subscribers, of
course. And what happens when subscriptions start dropping because
companies can't afford a package that includes mental health-care
coverage and the fraud that comes with it? People who need physical
health-care coverage pay for it. They end up out in the cold because
their employers can no longer offer health-care benefits. They pay in
pain and suffering because the cost of fraud is so high. Who pays?
You do and I do.</TE>

<LD>Re "Ad Man Gives His Bitter Divorce a Happy Ending--in a Film
Fantasy," May 1: How incredibly nice of The Times to give local
filmmaker and advertising man Steven Dworman such glowing,
four-column, full-color, front-page coverage on the theatrical run of
his $1.5-million film. May he achieve the best of success.</LD>
<LD>   However, could you please explain what is so newsworthy about this
film that merits front-page news space? Or should I say advertising
space? Hundreds of equally worthy, truly independent films being
four-walled in L.A. theaters have gone completely unnoticed by The
Times. Does this mean The Times is ready to give equal coverage to
all local filmmakers?</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Giambi keeps making the Oakland Athletics wish he never had
left.</LD>
<LD>   Giambi homered and drove in three runs against his former team,
and Roger Clemens won his third consecutive start as the New York
Yankees defeated the A's, 9-2, Thursday night at New York.</LD>
<LD>   Giambi, who left Oakland in the off-season for a $120 million,
seven-year contract in New York, lifted a low breaking ball from Cory
Lidle over the right-field fence for a two-run shot in the sixth
inning, snapping a 2-2 tie and bringing loud cheers when he came out
of the dugout for a curtain call.</LD>
<TE>   "I said, 'They're asking you for more, go out there and give it to
them,'" Yankee Manager Joe Torre said. "He needed that. It was an
impact night for him."</TE>
<TE>   In his first series back in Oakland, Giambi hit a go-ahead,
two-run double to defeat the A's last week.</TE>
<TE>   With the New York City area under a rare tornado watch, a sparse
crowd announced at 30,463 showed up on a gloomy night in the Bronx
and wound up giving Giambi his biggest cheers since his arrival. He
has hit only two of his five home runs at Yankee Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exciting to have those guys give you standing O's," Giambi
said. "Every day I get more and more comfortable with calling this
place home."</TE>
<TE>   Clemens (4-2) earned his 284th victory, passing Jim Kaat on the
career list and catching Ferguson Jerkins for 25th place.</TE>
<TE>   Kaat is now a Yankees' broadcaster.</TE>
<TE>   "It was neat. I knew I was coming up on Kitty," Clemens said. "To
pass Kitty and tie Fergie is a great honor. Two great men and two
great pitchers. I mean, Kitty pitched for what, 24 or 25 years. It's
amazing. And to do it here with Kitty in the ballpark announcing the
game, it was a real treat for me."</TE>
<TE>   Derek Jeter went three for four with a walk and scored twice, and
Robin Ventura had three hits and two runs batted in for the Yankees,
who took four of six from their playoff rivals in the last 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 5, Toronto 3--Frank Catalanotto hit an RBI double off Mike
Smith (0-2) in a four-run fifth inning at Toronto, and the Rangers
extended their winning streak to a season-high five. The Rangers have
won seven of eight, improving to 12-15 with their longest winning
streak since last July 24-27.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto, which tied a season-high with three errors, has lost
eight in a row for the first time since June 20-27, 1995. The crowd
of 13,011 was the second-lowest ever at SkyDome, ahead of only the
12,571 Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Bell (2-0) gave up three runs and four hits in 52/3 innings,
and Hideki Irabu pitched the ninth for his sixth save.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 7, Tampa Bay 6-- Corey Koskie hit his second homer of
the game in the 10th inning, capping a comeback from a six-run
deficit as the Twins completed a four-game sweep at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota trailed, 6-0, after six innings but scored four runs in
the seventh and tied it in the ninth on Doug Mientkiewicz's two-run
single off Steve Kent (0-1) with two out and two strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay, which has lost seven in a row, was swept by the Twins
for the first time and also went winless on a road trip of two stops
or more for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 6, Kansas City 2--Sidney Ponson (2-2) gave up one run
and six hits in seven innings at Baltimore to defeat the Royals for
the second time in six days and dropping Kansas City interim manager
John Mizerock to 0-3.</TE>
<TE>   David Segui, Tony Batista and Jeff Conine homered off Paul Byrd
(4-2) to give Baltimore a 4-0 lead after three innings.</TE>

<LD>At a charity event last winter, the greatest second baseman in Angel
history introduced himself to the current second baseman. With a few
adjustments, Bobby Grich told Adam Kennedy, you could develop into a
terrific hitter.</LD>
<LD>   "If he can hit between .260 and .270 with an uppercut like that,"
Grich said, "then if he could flatten his swing out who knows what he
could hit?"</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy agreed to work with Grich several times during the winter,
and the two discussed the finer points of the swing and the stance.
In spring training, Kennedy hit .439. "I thought he was going to have
a bust-out year," Grich said.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, after hitting .266 and .270 in his first two seasons with
the Angels, Kennedy is hitting .247 and is platooning with Jose
Nieves.</TE>
<TE>   In watching the Angels, Grich has seen Kennedy revert to old
habits, but he is reluctant to get involved. "Mickey Hatcher is the
hitting coach," Grich said. "I don't want to step on any toes."</TE>
<TE>   Hatcher said it wouldn't bother him. "You learn from good
hitters," he said. "I don't have an ego about this."</TE>
<TE>   Said Kennedy: "I'm trying to make adjustments to keep Bobby's plan
on my mind. But I won't go up to the plate with something I'm not
comfortable with. Bobby was working mostly on one thing. Mickey sees
me every day."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wil Cordero cleared waivers and became a free agent, but the
Angels opted not to pursue the veteran right-handed hitter, because
they believed his recent spotty offensive production and his
defensive weakness did not justify taking a chance on him.</TE>

<HD>Grievance Ruling Expected in July</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The arbitrator hearing the grievance by baseball players against
contraction will try to rule on the case by July 15.</LD>
<LD>   Shyam Das, who listened to 20 days of testimony from nine
witnesses from Dec. 4 to April 10, is to hear final arguments from
lawyers for both sides on June 6.</LD>
<LD>   He told the parties he "will make every effort" to have a decision
on the case by July 15, management lawyer Rob Manfred said Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Players contend the Nov. 6 vote by owners to eliminate two teams
violated their labor contract, which expired the next day. Owners,
who attempted to fold Montreal and Minnesota, say they have the right
to eliminate teams. Players say their consent is needed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the sides resumed collective bargaining talks Thursday,
then recessed them for at least a week. Manfred said owners made
proposals on about six noncore issues.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Florida Marlin right-hander Brad Penny was removed from Thursday's
game against the St. Louis Cardinals after two innings because of
elbow soreness and probably will miss at least one start.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't at this point think it's real serious," Manager Jeff
Torborg said.</TE>
<TE>   Penny was examined by Cardinal doctors, who told the Marlins the
injury involved nerve irritation near the triceps.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, it was announced that Torborg will serve a one-game
suspension today at Milwaukee for an ejection on April 8, with Major
League Baseball reducing the penalty from two games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh Pirate infielder Pat Meares said he will not have
surgery on his injured left hand, which has hampered his performance
at the plate since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Meares has disagreed with management about whether he should play
without the surgery. Team officials say the decision has been left to
Meares.</TE>
<TE>   Meares, who remains on the disabled list, has two years left on
his $15-million, four-year contract.</TE>

<HD>Sosa Doubles His Pleasure</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Sammy Sosa is aiming for the fences with extra vigor. And he's not
missing.</LD>
<LD>   Sosa homered in consecutive at-bats, giving him four in two games,
and the Chicago Cubs defeated the San Diego Padres, 6-1, Thursday to
end their season-high five-game losing streak.</LD>
<LD>   Sosa seemed to hop out of the batter's box with extra energy after
he drove his first homer an estimated 426 feet into the seats in
left-center field leading off the fourth, the first of a season-high
four homers for the Cubs.</LD>
<TE>   "We lost the first two games [of the series] and today we came out
with intensity and got it into our heads that we need some runs,"
Sosa said. "When you have that attitude, really, you've got
something. We played some great ball today."</TE>
<TE>   Sosa took over the major league lead with 12 homers, one ahead of
Houston's Lance Berkman and Florida's Cliff Floyd. Sosa also moved
into a tie with Jose Canseco for 22nd on the career list with 462. He
moved past Ken Griffey Jr., who has 461.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa's first homer came on a full-count pitch. He got another
belt-high fastball on a 3-0 count leading off the sixth and hit a
line shot that just cleared the fence 379 feet away in left-center.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been waiting for it for a while," manager Don Baylor said.
"I know he has too."</TE>

<HD>For a Hunch Bet, Go See Cal-Bred</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Lusty Latin will be trying to become only the
fourth in that category to win the Kentucky Derby and the first in 40
years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>You can set your sundial by it: Every 40 years, a horse bred in
California wins the Kentucky Derby.</LD>
<LD>   In 1922, Morvich, a lazy colt with crooked legs, was the first
California-bred to win the Derby. Morvich, undefeated in 11 starts as
a 2-year-old, made it an even dozen in the Derby, then never won
another race.</LD>
<LD>   In 1962, Decidedly, a gray son of '54 Derby winner Determine, had
never won a stakes race, but he copied his sire with an unexpected
victory at Churchill Downs.</LD>
<TE>   Between Morvich and Decidedly, Swaps, in 1955, was the only other
Cal-bred to win the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   If California's 40-year thing holds, Lusty Latin, a former
claiming horse and a gray like Decidedly, will deliver a shocker
Saturday in the 128th Derby.</TE>
<TE>   A month ago, Lusty Latin was third in the Santa Anita Derby, three
lengths behind Came Home, but the son of El Prado and Scarlet Ann has
won only twice in 11 starts and is 30-1 on the Derby's morning line.
He will be the 41st Cal-bred in the race since Decidedly won. The
best Cal-bred finishes since Decidedly's victory have been seconds by
Hill Rise in 1964, Rumbo in 1980, Best Pal in 1991 and Cavonnier in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen minutes after Lusty Latin's third-place finish at 47-1 in
the Santa Anita Derby, Joey Platts, who owns the horse with his wife
Wendy, said that Team Valor had called with a feeler to buy.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them we weren't interested," said Platts, a 40-year-old
construction executive from Lyman, Wyo. "We hadn't even had time to
party yet."</TE>
<TE>   Team Valor appeared to have a horse in the Derby, anyway, with
Windward Passage, but Danthebluegrassman, an entry-time afterthought
for trainer Bob Baffert on Wednesday, knocked the Valor runner out of
the field.</TE>
<TE>   The week after the Santa Anita Derby, when Lusty Latin earned
$90,000, enough for him to qualify for the Kentucky Derby, Platts'
phone kept ringing. Madeleine Paulson, the widow of Allen Paulson,
the owner of two-time horse-of-the-year Cigar, said she was
interested, and there also were reports that Baffert's main client,
Prince Ahmed Salman, had taken a sniff. Salman wound up buying War
Emblem, the Illinois Derby winner, and Baffert will saddle him and
Danthebluegrassman on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "There must have been 10 or 15 inquiries," Platts said. "Some of
them were kind of interesting. A man from New York wanted to buy one
one-third of the horse. He said that the horse could run in my colors
in the Derby if he ran in his colors in the Belmont. That was asking
a lot for just 33%."</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Jeff Mullins, who claimed Lusty Latin for $62,500 after
the colt had finished second at Hollywood Park on Nov. 29, said that
Platts could have sold the horse for $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way we might have considered selling was if we would
have kept 50.1%," Platts said. "But all [of the potential buyers]
wanted a majority. They all wanted to switch trainers, and would have
insisted on a different jockey. We didn't want to give up our first
chance at the Derby, and deprive ourselves of the chance to live the
Derby dream. And I wasn't going to reach in and pull the heart out of
Glenn Corbett and throw it on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Corbett, 36, a former high school bronco rider, has ridden Lusty
Latin in his last four races, finishing third three times and winning
something called the Rattlesnake Stakes at Turf Paradise in Phoenix.
Corbett, who splits his year between Turf Paradise and Prairie
Meadows in Iowa, has never ridden in a Derby. The day of Spend A
Buck's Derby win in 1985, Corbett was in racing's hinterlands at Penn
National, riding the first race of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Although other Derby-hunting jockeys were hovering, Platts and
Mullins refused to copy trainer Ken McPeek, who jettisoned Tony
D'Amico, another rider with no Derby experience, for Edgar Prado when
Harlan's Holiday, Saturday's favorite, lost consecutive races early
in the year.</TE>
<TE>   McPeek's switch was a business decision, in a big-bucks business,
and he has averted much criticism. At Derby time, with top jockeys
wheeling and dealing to ride horses that will get them into the race,
the decision by Platts and Mullins to retain Corbett is the
exception. But then most things about Lusty Latin are exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, horses rarely emerge from claiming races to have a
shot at the Derby, although Charismatic, the 1999 winner, raced twice
in $62,500 claimers without being claimed.</TE>
<TE>   On the day Mullins claimed Lusty Latin, he was looking at another
horse in the same race, but he decided to buy his eventual Derby
starter because Lusty Latin had run fifth in the California Cup
Juvenile, in which Yougottawanna and Officer finished 1-2.
Yougottawanna was a Derby possible before he was injured and Officer,
before his bubble burst, was one of Baffert's contenders.</TE>
<TE>   Mullins, who claimed Lusty Latin away from trainer Ed Moger Jr.,
said that the next day Moger called him, offering to buy the horse
back for $85,000. That would have made for a 26% profit in less than
24 hours, not a bad turn-around for the horse game, but Mullins
resisted, even though the Kentucky Derby was hardly on his radar
then. Now it's the only thing on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   After the disappointment caused by Windward Passage's failure to
qualify for the Kentucky Derby, Team Valor and trainer Steve Asmussen
won Thursday's $100,000 La Troienne Stakes for 3-year-old fillies
with Cashier's Dream, who covered seven furlongs in 1:244/5 on a
sloppy track and beat the Baffert-trained Shameful by a head.
Cashier's Dream, ridden by Donnie Meche, paid $3.40 after winning for
the fifth time in seven starts.</TE>
<TE>   Before the race, Barry Irwin, president of Team Valor, distanced
himself from remarks made by Bob Lively, one of the owners of
Windward Passage. Lively was highly critical of Baffert for running
Danthebluegrassman and costing Windward Passage a spot in the race.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no problem with Baffert," Irwin said. "He made the
decision based on horsemanship. His horse didn't run well at Santa
Anita, but he loves Churchill Downs and would seem to deserve a shot.
There's no bad blood between me and Baffert. My main problem with the
draw is the [ESPN] TV show. You're required to enter the Derby at 10
o'clock in the morning, and then they don't go on the air to draw
until seven hours later. The whole show is stupid. It's contrived and
it's boring, and a few years ago it took a guy who loved racing,
[sportscaster] Chris Lincoln, and ruined his life because he was
blamed for a mix-up during the draw. They ought to go back to when
they had a public draw at 10 in the morning, the same time you were
required to enter your horse."</TE>
<TE>   Lonnie Meche, 10 minutes younger than his twin brother Donnie,
rode Repository to victory in the $100,000 Mamzelle Stakes.... Sunday
Break, another horse left out of the Derby because of a purse
shortage, will run in the Preakness on May 18, providing trainer Neil
Drysdale's colt can qualify there. Pimlico restricts the Preakness to
14 horses, and although that many haven't run since 1992, early
estimates indicate an overflow of entries this time. Drysdale said
that if Sunday Break were excluded from the Preakness, he'd run in
the Peter Pan at Belmont Park on May 25. Ostensibly, that would be a
prep for the Belmont Stakes on June 8.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Jordan, Knee Get Some Rest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brian Jordan's left knee was barking, and his bat lost its bite, so
Manager Jim Tracy gave the Dodger left fielder the night off
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan's knee began to bother him in spring training, and he
aggravated it legging out an infield hit in San Diego on April 14.
With treatment and medication, trainers calmed Jordan's patella
tendinitis, but the knee began to act up in Pittsburgh and Chicago
last week.</LD>
<LD>   "You [stink] two days in a row, something isn't right," Jordan
said. "I was feeling pretty good, but that cold weather [on the road]
set me back a bit."</LD>
<TE>   It didn't show at the plate. Jordan went eight for 24 with a homer
and three runs batted in on the trip. But he returned to Dodger
Stadium and went hitless in eight at-bats Tuesday and Wednesday,
continuing a trend that is beginning to disturb Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan is batting .333 in 15 road games but only .179 in 12 road
games. He was a career .240 hitter in Dodger Stadium before the
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tracy pulled Kevin Brown after 84 pitches Tuesday night, when the
right-hander returned from the disabled list and gave up two runs and
five hits in five innings to the Reds. But Brown, who was sidelined
because of a tearing of scar tissue in his surgically repaired right
elbow, said he could have gone longer.</TE>
<TE>   "I could have thrown more," Brown said. "That was precautionary on
their part--they wanted to play it safe. I have no problem with my
stamina. Physically, I'm fine."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he was doing mentally, how he was coping with the
emotional highs and lows of returning from surgery, Brown said,
"That's none of your damn business.... I don't feel like I'm
rehabilitating. I'm just trying to find my rhythm, my comfort. It's
just a matter of touch and repetition, of knowing where the pitch is
going to go. Once you gain that consistency, it allows you to be more
comfortable."</TE>

<HD>Forsman Is Early Leader With a 65 at New Orleans</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Dan Forsman, taking advantage of an early tee time on the wind-swept
English Turn course, shot a seven-under-par 65 Thursday to take the
first-round lead in the Compaq Classic.</LD>
<LD>   Rich Beem opened with a 67, Stewart Cink and Dudley Hart topped a
group at 68, and defending champion David Toms shot a 69.</LD>
<LD>   Phil Mickelson, who finished second last year, shot a 73.</LD>
<TE>   Forsman, who won the last of his four PGA Tour titles in 1992,
backed off three times because of the wind before sinking a 12-foot
birdie putt on No. 18, worried that the wind would steer it off
course. But it was his putting, with only 24 putts on the day, that
gave Forsman the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't had a 24-putt round in quite some time," Forsman said.
"But I've been working hard on my putting."</TE>
<TE>   Beem, who teed off an hour after Forsman, shot a 29 on his first
nine, then ran into the wind and had a 38 on the last nine.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my lowest nine in competition," Beem said. "I've probably
shot it out messing around with my buddies, but certainly not in
competition."</TE>
<TE>   No one has led a tournament wire-to-wire this year, and only two
first-round leaders have won tournaments--Jerry Kelly at the Sony
Open and Tiger Woods at the Bay Hill Invitational.</TE>

<LD>The proposed Major Champions Tour isn't disappearing from the pro
golf landscape, it's just going to look different than planned,
according to the sports television guru responsible for overseeing
the project.</LD>
<LD>   "The notion isn't going away," Terry Jastrow said. "In fact, I
think it's going to happen, one way or another, next year."</LD>
<LD>   The tour was intended to feature winners of major championships
between the ages of 37 and 55 in seven televised events beginning in
2003, and required 20 of the 35 eligible players to agree to give up
their PGA Tour cards in order to play. Although the MCT fell short of
that number, Jastrow said that the majority of the players embraced
the concept but did not want to damage the PGA Tour.</LD>
<TE>   There are discussions underway about playing MCT events on
weekends in November and December and on Mondays and Tuesdays during
the regular PGA Tour season. Fox remains the prime broadcast prospect
for the new venture.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With a lot of the big-name riders in Kentucky for the Oaks and Derby,
local fans will get their first in-person look at jockey Jason
Lumpkins.</LD>
<LD>   Second to Russell Baze in the standings at Bay Meadows, Lumpkins
is named on four horses this afternoon, then is scheduled to be on
three more tonight at Bay Meadows. Hollywood Park has a 1:15 p.m.
post time because of the early kickoff on Saturday at Churchill
Downs, but Bay Meadows is sticking with its usual 7:20 p.m. start.</LD>
<LD>   Two of Lumpkins' mounts in Inglewood are trained by Nick Hines and
both are contenders.</LD>
<TE>   Runaway Susie, who has won four times up north, drops a notch
after a third at Bay Meadows in the first race, a $12,500 claimer for
older fillies and mares at six furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Three races later, Eric Da Bomb will try to go wire-to-wire for
the Hines-Lumpkins combination in an allowance race at 11/16 miles.</TE>
<TE>   The gelding won two in a row for Lumpkins at Bay Meadows and
Pleasanton last year, and, on March 30, they lost by a head to Workum
at Golden Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Lumpkins' other Hollywood Park mounts are Investor's Dream, a
Brazilian-bred making his first U.S. start for Richard Mandella in
the seventh, and the maiden filly Hard To Call, making her second
start in the eighth for trainer Dean Greenman. At Bay Meadows,
Lumpkins is supposed to ride Blue Moonray in the first, Nice Fish in
the third and Winter Melon Soup in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Outstanding Hero, Pacing The Cage, Macabe and
Fleetstreet Dancer are among the contenders in an interesting turf
sprint.</TE>
<TE>   The $51,000 optional claimer goes as the fifth on the card at
Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Mark Guidry. The jockey won with four of his first 10
mounts at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Double Our Flag. The 8-year-old gelding tries for his
first win in today's second at Bay Meadows in his 34th start.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Captian Bell, Misanello
and Power Wing in the sixth, I've Decided, the Entorchado-Lycitus
entry and Harrisand in the seventh and singling Cease Span in the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/18. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $16.40/$96.20. Total money bet: $120.</TE>

<LD>Able to win only once in nine starts as a 2-year-old, He Doll has
become a different animal since stretching out to 870 yards.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Margarito Farias and trained by Jorge Farias, the gelded
son of Pritzi Dash is perfect in four starts in 2002 at the distance,
winning by a combined 121/2 lengths.</LD>
<LD>   Thirteen days after winning his trial by three-quarters of a
length, He Doll is the 4-5 favorite to win his fifth in a row in
tonight's $80,000 Gold Rush Derby.</LD>
<TE>   Ramon Sanchez will be aboard the California-bred, who has not lost
since he was fifth going 350 yards in an allowance Nov. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Completing the field, from inside out, are Fly Jimmy Fly, Justa
For Fun, Ferragamo, Raise A Legend, Bac In The Saddle, Kels Leap Of
Faith and Delusively.</TE>
<TE>   Kels Leap Of Faith won the Gold Rush's other trial and has won his
last two at 870 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Hula Honey. 2. Slated. 3. Run Away Man. 4. Dedicated
Diplomat. 5. Gina Z. 6. Just A Berry. 7. Gabriels Thunder. 8. Debuts
Dasher. 9. He Doll. 10. Market Demand.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Let's use Really Western, Gabriels Thunder and Reeking Havoc
in the seventh, Debuts Dasher, Special Fly Bye, A Chic Chaser and
Bucky Bounce in the eighth, single He Doll in the ninth, and use
Market Demand and Outofthecloset GVL in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Baroness Kenmare just won and could surprise
again for hot trainer Christopher O'Dell in the first. After failing
to come close at Santa Anita and Hollywood Park, Drivers Seat takes a
big drop in class in the third.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Detroit goalie Dominik Hasek credited defense and a little luck for
the Red Wings' win.</LD>
<LD>   He neglected to mention his contribution.</LD>
<LD>   Hasek wowed the crowd with many of his 23 saves as the Red Wings
beat the St. Louis Blues, 2-0, Thursday night in the opener of their
Western Conference semifinal series at Detroit.</LD>
<TE>   It was the seventh playoff shutout for Hasek, a six-time Vezina
Trophy winner still looking for his first Stanley Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "They tried to be physical, but my defense did a very good job in
front of me," Hasek said. "Twice on the power play, I think they hit
the post. I was very lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Brett Hull and Pavel Datsyuk scored for a Detroit team that played
with much more focus than the one that dropped the first two games of
its first-round series with Vancouver. The Red Wings rallied to win
four in a row in that series to advance.</TE>
<TE>   "The first game in the [Vancouver] series, the bounces didn't go
our way. Tonight they did," Detroit Coach Scotty Bowman said. "They
had some shots from the point and some of them hit the crossbar or
the posts, and that's what happens."</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 5, Toronto 0--Now that the Senators have proven they can
beat the Maple Leafs in the playoffs, they're focused on the next
step--beating them again.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only one game," said Senator goaltender Patrick Lalime.
"It's a long series. You want to enjoy it when it's done. But you've
got to move on and prepare yourself for the next one."</TE>
<TE>   Lalime, who stopped 27 shots, and the rested Senators were
certainly prepared, opening the Eastern Conference semifinals with a
rout of the exhausted and battered Maple Leafs at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Lalime became only the 14th goalie to record four shutouts in one
postseason after getting three in the first-round series against
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the Senators' first win in Toronto in six
postseason visits.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Alfredsson and Martin Havlat had a goal and two assists
each as the Senators set a franchise record for most goals in a
playoff game.</TE>

<LD>Carolina can't approach Montreal's hockey tradition. The Canadiens
have won more Stanley Cups than the Hurricanes have logged years in
the NHL.</LD>
<LD>   But Carolina is still not impressed, as it prepares for today's
Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.</LD>
<LD>   "I remember breaking into the league and everybody was talking
about the [Montreal] ghosts. That's just a bunch of bull," Carolina
defenseman Glen Wesley said Thursday. "It's just another uniform."</LD>
<TE>   Montreal has won 24 Stanley Cups, but has struggled since trading
future Hall of Fame goaltender Patrick Roy in 1996. The Canadiens
missed the playoffs three straight seasons before making it in 2002
as the No. 8 seed in the East.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not Larry Robinson and all of those other guys over there
anymore," Carolina's Jeff O'Neill said. "It's a new wave of players
and a different NHL. Half of the young guys in here, including
myself, don't even remember those dream teams of the past."</TE>
<TE>   Two-time NHL All-Star Milan Hejduk of the Colorado Avalanche was
fined $300 and ordered to take a driving class after pleading guilty
to speeding.... Phoenix Coyote forward Brad May pleaded guilty to
misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct charges in a fight with a
nightclub manager and two sheriff's deputies. May was fined $5,000
and sentenced  to a year of probation and 100 hours of community
service.</TE>

<LD>Snapshots left over from Saturday's opening day of the Eastern Sierra
general trout season:</LD>
<LD>   * Put a cork in it: Rick Ortega of Covina is standing on the deck
at Gull Lake, one of four sparkling gems on the scenic June Lake
Loop. All but mummified in heavy clothing on a frigid, blustery
morning, he poses next to a scale where hangs a trout weighing 7
pounds 8 ounces.</LD>
<LD>   An 8-pounder brought in earlier at Gull will win another fisherman
a sizable cash prize for being the biggest opening-day fish caught on
the Loop. Ortega is miffed. His trout weighed 8.3 pounds on his
hand-held digital scale out on the water, but then he recalls that it
had oozed eggs continuously after being brought out of the water, as
he and his group kept fishing.</LD>
<TE>   "I guess I should have quit fishing and brought it in right away,"
he says. "Oh well, at least I caught one bigger than my uncle."</TE>
<TE>   His uncle Ray caught a five-pounder.</TE>
<TE>   * Fortieth time a charm: There's no mistaking Charles F. Pitts in
his cherry red jacket. Pitts, 77, of Irvine, is setting the timer on
his camera so he can run in and pose for a family portrait outside
the Gull Lake tackle shop. He had just participated in his 40th
consecutive opener. With him are his son, sons-in-law and a grandson.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the best part about opening day," he says, adding that all
caught their five-fish limits not long after sunrise.</TE>
<TE>   * By hook or crook: It's 9:30 a.m. at picturesque Convict Lake,
so-named because of an 1871 shootout here between a posse and six
escaped prisoners from Carson City, Nev.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Bauer, 45, of Long Beach maintains that a bandit is still at
large.</TE>
<TE>   "At exactly 5:01 this morning, a raccoon came down to the water
and tried to steal my fish--he took the whole stringer," Bauer says.
"He nearly made off with it too, but some kids yelled and he ran
off."</TE>
<TE>   Still dangling from his stringer is a 3.65-pound rainbow trout,
which was caught on Velveeta cheese.</TE>
<TE>   If you're wondering about the escaped convicts, they managed to
kill two in the posse and get away. Three of the six convicts were
later captured in nearby Round Valley. Two of them were promptly
lynched.</TE>
<TE>   * Fishy business: It's 1:30 p.m. at Crowley Lake Fish Camp.
Fishing has been good and Curtis Milliron is on hand to determine
just how good. The Department of Fish and Game biologist, through
interviews, weights and measurements, is coming to the following
opening-day conclusions:</TE>
<TE>   Anglers are catching an average of 4.92 trout overall and keeping
an average of 4.32. That's an outstanding opener. They're catching
1.18 trout an hour, exceeding the DFG's target catch rate of one an
hour. The average length/weight of rainbow trout: 14 inches and 1.12
pounds. The longest/heaviest: 25.5 inches and 5.4 pounds--caught by
Harry Groff of Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   * Cutthroat business: Ricardo Escobedo of Los Angeles has just
weighed in a 2.3-pound cutthroat trout. It's among the largest of two
dozen cutthroats brought to the biologists' table, and the scientists
are as pleased as the anglers. Crowley's rainbow trout fishery, with
three strains, is its bread and butter.</TE>
<TE>   But cutthroat trout are taking a solid foothold in the sprawling
reservoir, thanks to the fall stocking in recent years of larger
fish, which are less susceptible to predation by bigger fish and
birds. The opening-day cutthroat catch is only 0.7% of the overall
catch, but that's an improvement over previous years.</TE>
<TE>   * A sigh and a smile: These are the expressions of Jeff Conaway as
he takes a breather in the dining room adjacent to Crowley's tackle
store. As Crowley's new concessionaire, this is his first opener and
it has come on the heels of a windstorm two months ago that tore
apart some of his docks, and a fire that destroyed his storage shed
and everything in it.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, our biggest catastrophe has been backed up toilets," he
says. "Well, I'd better get back to work."</TE>
<TE>   * Firebug: It's the day before opening day and this reporter is
checking out the five-mile portion of the Owens River that was burned
a month earlier by a fire some say was set intentionally to enable
access to its banks. The Lower Owens is open year-round to fishing so
this is a popular spot on a day with so many new anglers in town.</TE>
<TE>   The reporter hikes downriver to escape the crowd, and finds
another large burn area on both sides of the banks. He wonders
whether indeed there might be a pyromaniac on the loose. Two days
later, a day after opening day, another suspicious fire will burn 200
acres along the banks of the Owens near the Pleasant Valley Reservoir
campground.</TE>
<TE>   Wiggle room: It's the day before the opener and the Big Pine High
seniors, all 10 of them, have sold hundreds of cartons of worms to
passersby en route to their opening-day hot spots (pardon the pun).
They needed $2,700 to earn a trip to Maui but by late afternoon have
surpassed that, with $3,096, and call it quits.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll use the extra money for activities," class advisor Amy
Steinwand says. "Some of the students want to mountain-bike down a
volcano."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of volcanoes, one fisherman nearly blows his top after
counting his worms and discovering the count stops at one. When told
later that one of the customers had been shorted, Steinwand explains,
"The little jerks kept worming their way out of the little pinholes
we poked in the cartons to give them air."</TE>
<TE>   Men Overboard</TE>
<TE>   Four anglers from the Oxnard area were forced to abandon their
23-foot fishing boat last Sunday off Santa Cruz Island when a larger
boat was closing in fast and showing no signs of stopping.</TE>
<TE>   It was a good thing they jumped. The 62-foot Cat Special out of
Cisco Sportfishing broadsided the little boat, causing "significant
damage" to its hull, according to Coast Guard investigator Troy
Rentz.</TE>
<TE>   There were no reported injuries and the smaller vessel was piloted
across the channel to the mainland. Cat Special skipper John Fuqua on
Thursday said he would not comment until the investigation is
complete.</TE>
<TE>   Rentz wouldn't speculate but said "the purpose of the
investigation is to determine the cause of the accident and whether
there was negligence on the part of the captain or any individual"
aboard the Cat Special, which was carrying 35 passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Seabass Strike</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Catalina Island white seabass bite Southland anglers had
been long awaiting erupted this week on the windward side of the
island. One-fish limits were the rule through Wednesday, but on
Thursday pressure seemed to get to the fish. They dived for cover and
had not surfaced as of 3 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Winners' Circle</TE>
<TE>   * Pro surfing: C.J. Hobgood of Satellite Beach, Fla., reigning
champion in the Assn. of Surfing Professionals, was the winner of the
inaugural Foster's Cup, held last Saturday at the famed break near
San Clemente. Melanie Bartels of Oahu's west shore was the women's
winner. The two-star World Qualifying series event was the first
North American stop on the 2002 Foster's Pro Surfing Tour.</TE>
<TE>   * Halibut fishing: The winner of last weekend's event was Steve
Rondash of Lompoc. He caught a 33.8-pound halibut on a live sardine
off Malibu, beating out 831 others. The top female angler was Karen
Otterbein of Venice with a 27.5-pounder, and the top junior was
Kumiko Homma, 7, of Torrance with a 17.3-pounder.</TE>
<TE>   * Largemouth bass fishing: Aaron Martens of Castaic emerged
victorious last Saturday at the Citgo Bassmaster Western Open, with
the top weight of 67 pounds 15 ounces over three days of competition
at Clear Lake in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was worth $35,000 and qualified him for the
prestigious Bass Masters Classic July 25-27 in Birmingham, Ala. Also
qualifying for the Classic was eighth-place finisher Mike O'Shea of
Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   The Newport In-the-Water boat show is in progress through Sunday
at Newport Dunes Resort and Marina. Among the highlights is a
"Survivor"-themed contest to see who can stand in a designated area
and hold a rod and reel in a fish-fighting position the longest.</TE>
<TE>   Ten finalists were chosen in a drawing and began their endurance
test--with a $25,000 boat going to the winner--Wednesday at noon. By
late afternoon Thursday, only seven remained. The lone female
participant, Pamela Redcher of Costa Mesa, was first to drop out,
seven hours into the competition.</TE>

<LD>Matt Moore is devouring the UCLA playbook and his mother's cooking in
equal helpings to prepare for his first football season in Westwood.</LD>
<LD>   Willnett Crockett is jumping into a demanding exercise regime
before making the leap of playing for Connecticut's national
championship women's basketball team.</LD>
<LD>   Pieter Berger is focusing on his schoolwork to avoid the pitfalls
of "senioritis" in anticipation of the academic rigors he'll face as
a soccer recruit at California.</LD>
<TE>   Staci Venski is training alongside Olympic-caliber weightlifters
to strengthen her chances of playing volleyball as a freshman at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks before graduation, these Southland high school
seniors are among many top athletes already turning their attention
toward college and competing at the next level.</TE>
<TE>   Scholarships in hand, they have no intention of letting their
dreams slip through their grasp by showing up unprepared.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be prepared in case they call your name," said Moore,
a quarterback from Newhall Hart High who is being given the rare
opportunity to compete for a starting spot as a freshman at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be able to act on the spot, whether it's starting the
game or coming in with 30 seconds left in the fourth quarter."</TE>
<TE>   Moore was a regular visitor at UCLA's spring practice sessions,
which concluded Saturday. He chose not to play baseball for Hart this
season so he could devote more time to his studies and be able to
drive to Westwood after school to begin learning the nuances of
playing quarterback for the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   "I miss baseball a lot, but I think I made the right move," he
said. "If I was playing baseball, I wouldn't be able to go [to spring
practice]. This is educational in the long run."</TE>
<TE>   By observing spring practice, Moore was able to get a jump on
learning UCLA's intricate playbook and pick the brain of returning
senior quarterback Cory Paus.</TE>
<TE>   "Cory has been great," Moore said. "Any question I have, he'll
answer and tell me more. Hopefully I can take what he's telling me
and use it."</TE>
<TE>   Although UCLA Coach Bob Toledo has opened the quarterback job to
allow Moore and fellow incoming freshman Drew Olson to compete for
the starting spot in the fall, Moore knows it will be tough to beat
out Paus, who is being forced to earn back his job after angering
Toledo by not informing him about two drunk-driving convictions.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking at it as an opportunity, whether I'm the backup or
the starter," Moore said. "Knowing that I can play [as a freshman]
makes me want to work that much harder."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to lifting weights, Moore has been eating a lot of his
mother Mindy's cooking and drinking protein shakes to try to bulk up
his slender 6-foot-3, 185-pound frame. He's hopeful of having a late
growth spurt like his father, Don, who is 6-6 and 270 pounds and
still pumps iron.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad didn't get his size until he was 19 or 20," Moore said. "I
want to be a little bigger."</TE>
<TE>   For Crockett, the goal is a little different. The 6-3,
All-American forward from Harbor City Narbonne wants to firm up and
be in better shape when she starts summer school at Connecticut on
July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Five days a week, she is following an exercise routine drawn up by
Narbonne Coach James Anderson that incorporates running,
weightlifting and basketball drills. Afterward, she goes to Harbor
City Park near her home for full-court games. She also is cutting
back on fast food, sodas and candy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm working on my fitness more so than ever," Crockett said. "In
past years, I just [relied] on talent."</TE>
<TE>   She got a taste of what to expect in college by playing in the
McDonald's and Nike all-star games the first week of April. Playing
with and against some of the nation's top seniors, including four of
her future Connecticut teammates, Crockett said she realizes what it
will take to excel in college.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of those girls were quicker than I thought, stronger than I
thought," she said. "[But] I'm willing to do whatever it takes. I
have no problem working hard for something I really want."</TE>
<TE>   With Connecticut graduating several post players from last
season's 39-0 team, Crockett is confident she will get playing time
as a freshman.</TE>
<TE>   She is less sure what to expect from college life on a campus
3,000 miles away from family and longtime friends.</TE>
<TE>   "Being away from home, that's the scary part," she said. "But it's
a new chapter in my life. We're going to have fun. We're going to
have a ball."</TE>
<TE>   Berger also wonders how he'll fit in at college. The soccer
standout from Irvine Woodbridge accepts that living in Berkeley, a
hub of liberalism and open-mindedness, will be a big change after
growing up in conservative Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Berger, who has a 3.6 grade-point average, is preparing for Cal in
the classroom and on the soccer field. At a time when many seniors
are skating through their final weeks of high school, Berger is
taking a demanding class load that includes calculus.</TE>
<TE>   After school, he spends much of his time practicing and playing
with the Irvine Strikers, his 19-and-under club soccer team. Berger
tied Woodbridge's season scoring record with 28 goals this year and
was recruited to add punch to Cal's forward line.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what I'm doing in soccer, I can handle that," he said.
"The thing I'm worried about is fitting in at school from an academic
standpoint."</TE>
<TE>   Though he is big for a soccer player at 6-3 and 200 pounds, Berger
worries about being physical enough to play in the competitive
Pacific 10 Conference. He said he might start lifting weights to
improve his strength.</TE>
<TE>   Fitting in with Cal's soccer team probably won't be a problem.
Berger said four of his former Irvine Striker teammates already are
playing for the Golden Bears, and one of his current teammates, Tyson
Wahl of Newport Harbor, is also headed to Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Venski seemingly has been preparing for USC since she moved out of
her parents' home two years ago for athletic and academic reasons.</TE>
<TE>   She relocated from the desert town of California City to
Calabasas, where she lives with a family she met through volleyball,
to be closer to her club volleyball team. The move allowed her to
gain access to a more well-rounded curriculum at Calabasas High than
was available at her previous school, Mojave.</TE>
<TE>   Venski then showed how seriousshe was about her future when she
decided not to play on the Calabasas girls' volleyball team, choosing
instead to concentrate on training and playing club volleyball.</TE>
<TE>   "My main reason for not playing high school [volleyball] was
because I was selfish," she said. "I wanted to get stronger and
faster. Training five days a week is what it took."</TE>
<TE>   Venski is pleased with the results. The 6-3 middle blocker has
added six inches to her vertical leap and improved her strength in
the 18 months she has been working out at Van Nuys High under the
guidance of Bob Takano, a teacher at the school who conducts
weight-training sessions for Olympic weightlifting prospects and
athletes in other sports.</TE>
<TE>   "His training has helped me so much," she said. "I feel so much
stronger on my feet."</TE>
<TE>   Venski splits her week between weight-training sessions and
playing or practicing with the Redondo Beach-based Southern
California Volleyball Club, whose season lasts from November to July.
She says the ultra-competitive club competition has prepared her for
college more than playing high school volleyball would have.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she knows there's more work to do.</TE>
<TE>   "People congratulate me after a club match, but in the back of my
mind I ask myself, 'Is that going to get the job done in college?'
Probably not. So I need to change something.</TE>
<TE>   "I look forward every day to getting better."</TE>

<LD>North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake won eight of nine doubles sets en
route to a 12-6 nonleague boys' tennis victory over San Marino on
Thursday at Studio City Golf and Tennis.</LD>
<LD>   Harvard-Westlake (21-1) is ranked No. 2 in the Southern Section
Division V rankings, with San Marino (20-4) at No. 3. Corona del Mar
is ranked No. 1. The Wolverines, No. 4 in The Times' rankings,
registered three-set sweeps from the top doubles team of senior Jon
Rubenstein and junior James Thayer and the No. 3 team of senior Joel
Wiles and freshman Sam Wagner.</LD>
<LD>   The Wolverines played without No. 2 singles player Josh Lederman
(sprained right hand) and No. 3 John Lee (strained right Achilles'
tendon) while San Marino's No. 1 singles player, Travis Kinard,
missed the team bus.</LD>
<TE>   In City Section boys' tennis:</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills Taft 15, Palisades 14 1/2--Andy Posner, Chris

<LD>The long-range plan to raise soccer's profile in the United States by
bringing top-level foreign clubs to play here moved closer to
fruition Thursday with the announcement that Manchester United of the
English Premier League will play three games in the U.S. in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   The games are tentatively scheduled for Los Angeles on July 12,
Boston on July 16 and the New York area on July 19.</LD>
<LD>   Manchester United is supposed to bring its first team, but no
decision has been made on opponents.</LD>
<TE>   The trip is being put together by ChampionsWorld, a New Jersey
marketing company, and Soccer United Marketing (SUM), which counts
the Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), the Hunt Sports Group and
Dentsu Inc. among its investors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One unexpected no-show at the U.S. World Cup team's 10-day
training camp that opened in Cary, N.C., on Wednesday was winger
Eddie Lewis, who, for reasons not clear to Coach Bruce Arena, was not
released by his English club, Fulham.</TE>
<TE>   Fulham Coach Jean Tigana, a standout midfielder on France's 1986
World Cup team, said he wanted to keep the former UCLA player at
Fulham until after the club's final game May 11.</TE>
<TE>   The decision means Lewis will miss the U.S. team's warmup game
against Uruguay on May 12 at RFK Stadium in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Europe</TE>
<TE>   Germany will be without Jens Nowotny for the World Cup after
doctors confirmed that the 28-year-old defender had suffered a torn
ligament in his right knee Tuesday while playing for Bayer Leverkusen
in its Champions League semifinal against Manchester United.</TE>
<TE>   Nowotny, being counted on by Coach Rudi Voeller to organize
Germany's back line, will undergo surgery in Vail, Colo., and will be
sidelined for six months.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not only a bitter setback for Jens and all of us, it's a big
loss for the national team," Voeller said. "Jens ... was going to
take charge of defense and relay my instructions from the bench. It
will be difficult to replace him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   England's midfielder David Beckham, who broke a bone in his foot
last month, should be fit for the World Cup, Coach Sven-Goran
Eriksson said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph "Sepp" Blatter, FIFA's president, faces a potential vote of
no confidence today when the FIFA executive committee meets in
Zurich, Switzerland, to determine whether to override Blatter's
decision to suspend an internal audit of FIFA's finances.</TE>
<TE>   At the meeting, Michel Zen-Ruffinen, FIFA's general secretary, is
expected to offer evidence of the financial mismanagement that he
claims is rife within soccer's international governing body.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter has denied those claims. Unless Zen-Ruffinen can offer
compelling proof in the closed-door session, Blatter is likely to win
reelection May 29 in his race against Issa Hayatou of Cameroon for
the top job in soccer.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's former captain, Igor Shalimov, lashed out at Coach Oleg
Romantsev, accusing him of keeping CSKA Moscow winger Rolan Gusev and
Lokomotiv Moscow goalkeeper Sergei Ovchinnikov off the national team.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are the national team coach, a professional, you have to
put the team interests above anything else," Shalimov told Russian
television. "It's nonsense when you have two of Russia's best players
omitted from the national team for whatever reason."</TE>
<TE>   Asia</TE>
<TE>   Japan made up deficits three times before eventually settling for
a 3-3 tie with Honduras in a warmup game played in front of 38,130 at
Kobe, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Shunsuke Nakamura scored twice for Japan in a five-goal first
half, partially offsetting a pair of goals by Honduras' Carlos Pavon
and one by Jose Luis Pineda.</TE>
<TE>   Japan earned the tie and extended its unbeaten streak to seven
games when Brazilian-born Alessandro Santos scored on a penalty kick
in the 76th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Africa</TE>
<TE>   Tunisia's World Cup plans were dealt a blow when veteran
goalkeeper and national team captain Chokri El Ouaer announced his
retirement for undisclosed health reasons.</TE>
<TE>   El Ouaer, 35, said he would explain later.</TE>

<DH>Track and field: USC, UCLA unhappy with international
tabulation for dual meet.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tradition will take a back seat Saturday when it comes to scoring the
USC-UCLA track and field meet at UCLA's Drake Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The scoring system that has been used in every USC-UCLA dual meet
since the series began in 1934 awarded points to the top three
finishers in individual events on a 5-3-1 basis. In the 400- and
1,600-meter relays, the winner got five points while the runner-up
got zero.</LD>
<LD>   It's out.</LD>
<TE>   What's in is the so-called international scoring system, adopted
by the NCAA in 1999, which awards points on a 5-3-2-1 basis for
individual events--but with only the top two finishers from each
school counting in the scoring. It will be in effect for the first
time in a USC-UCLA meet when competition starts in the field events
at 9 a.m. and in the running events at 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a feel-good kind of thing," UCLA men's Coach Art Venegas
said with disdain about the new system. "The better team is usually
still going to win, but it's very hard for a team to blow the other
team out."</TE>
<TE>   Ron Allice, the director of track and field at USC, is even more
critical of the international scoring format that rewards depth less
than the traditional format.</TE>
<TE>   "It has no validity," Allice said. "It doesn't reward excellence.
It rewards mediocrity."</TE>
<TE>   With the new system, athletes from the same team could sweep the
top three places in an event but outscore the opposition by only an
8-3 margin as long as the other team has two competitors who finish a
race or post a mark in a field event.</TE>
<TE>   In the traditional scoring system, a 1-2-3 finish in an individual
event would give a team a 9-0 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's designed to keep the scores close for the crowd," Allice
said of the new system. "It doesn't necessarily indicate what's truly
going on in the meet."</TE>
<TE>   The international scoring system also differs from the traditional
one in the relays because the second-place team gets three points to
the winner's five.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't stand that in the relays, you get three points for just
getting it around the track," Venegas said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite protests from both sides, USC and UCLA will use the new
scoring system in Saturday's meet because the Pacific 10 Conference
has declared they must.</TE>
<TE>   "They basically told us that we would be in violation of NCAA
rules if we continued to score meets the way we had been," Venegas
said.</TE>
<TE>   No matter the scoring system in use Saturday, the women's meet is
expected to be the highest-quality collegiate dual meet in the nation
this season.</TE>
<TE>   The USC women won their first NCAA title last year and are favored
to win again when the championships are held at Louisiana State from
May 29-June 1. But NCAA runner-up UCLA is the five-time defending
Pac-10 champion and has beaten USC in nine consecutive dual meets.</TE>
<TE>   The USC men snapped their 22-meet losing streak to UCLA last year
with a 82-81 victory, but the Trojans will be underdogs Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "On the women's side, every area is a war," Venegas said. "Every
event is going to be important.... There seems to be a lot of women's
events where the No. 3 entrant could win. Things are that
competitive."</TE>

<HD>Watkins' Finances Still in Question</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Twins say Alabama businessman hasn't proved he
can afford them. He also has made offer for more-expensive Angels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN and ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after the Minnesota Twins declared that Donald Watkins had not
demonstrated the financial capacity to purchase their team, a highly
placed baseball official said Thursday that the Alabama businessman
has not proved that he can afford the Angels either, or any other
team.</LD>
<LD>   "We still don't know what Donald Watkins has [financially] and
what he doesn't have," the official said.</LD>
<LD>   Watkins met with Disney officials in March and subsequently made a
preliminary offer of $250 million for the Angels. He previously had
made a preliminary offer for the Twins of $125 million to $150
million, pending review of the team's finances. The Twins' assessment
of Watkins' finances, however, casts doubt on his ability to pay
perhaps twice as much for the Angels.</LD>
<TE>   In a letter to Minnesota legislators debating a funding proposal
for a new stadium, Twin President Jerry Bell said Wednesday that no
party "with adequate resources to consummate a transaction" has
emerged as a potential buyer for the team, which is for sale.</TE>
<TE>   "If Mr. Watkins were to reliably demonstrate his ability to secure
$150 million in funds that are fully committed and readily accessible
for the acquisition of the Minnesota Twins, I can unequivocally
assure you that he would have every opportunity to become the owner
of the team," Bell wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins, in a response to the legislators, wrote Thursday that he
submitted an offer to Bell on Feb. 11, including a financial
disclosure form that listed his net worth. The Twins have not asked
questions about the form, entered into negotiations or otherwise
responded to the offer, Watkins added.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the Angels, he continued, he has "letters from two
respected investment banking firms arranging the first $200 million
needed for the acquisition of this team."</TE>
<TE>   Bell, in his letter, wrote that if Watkins released the Twins from
their mutual confidentiality agreement, the team would disclose the
financial data he provided "to put to rest any lingering concerns"
about how the Twins treated Watkins.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins' attorney dismissed that suggestion Thursday. Watkins "is
perfectly prepared" to detail and defend his financial statements to
an owner selling a team and to the other owners who would approve any
deal, as required by baseball rules, Jonathan Rose said.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion that he has to prove something to anybody anywhere
else is not something he feels he has to do," Rose said. "That will
be proven when he buys a team, and that is what he plans to do."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins turned his attention to the Angels when his efforts to buy
the Twins stalled. Disney executives told Watkins that several other
parties also had expressed interest in buying the team, Rose said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney has revealed the Angels' confidential financial data to
Watkins and other parties but has not granted exclusive negotiating
rights to any party, and no deal is imminent. Paul Pressler, the
executive who runs the Angels and Mighty Ducks for Disney, is
believed to have met recently with a group of Los Angeles businessmen
interested in buying the Angels. The financial capacity of that group
is not believed to be in question.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler, citing a confidentiality agreement with Watkins, would
not say whether Disney believed he had shown he has the financial
resources to buy the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "People have come through and kicked the tires," Pressler said.
"If somebody made us an offer that was right for our shareholders, we
would give it consideration. In the meantime, we're running the clubs
for success."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins privately lists his net worth at $1.5 billion. In his
letter, he says that "various privately held partnerships ... hold
the vast majority of my wealth" and says he can convert sufficient
assets into cash "expeditiously."</TE>
<TE>   Said the major league official: "We received a net worth statement
from him, but it's all in privately owned companies and it's hard to
determine their value. We have seen very little in the way of cash.
We don't know how to monetize his [assets]. Everyone has had a tough
time getting a handle on it."</TE>
<TE>   The official said baseball's so-called 60-40 rule could be a
factor in considering any application from Watkins, should he reach a
purchase agreement with Disney. The rule limits the debt of an owner
to 40% of the team value, defined under the rule as twice the annual
revenue of a team.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels reported revenues of $92 million last season, which
would place their "60-40" value at $184 million. The rule counts
operating losses and long-term player contracts as debt, so if even
some of the promised $200 million financing adds to the debt burden,
the road to approval could be tenuous for Watkins, who wants to be a
sole owner.</TE>
<TE>   "He is going to comply fully with all the rules of baseball in any
proposal we make," Rose said.</TE>

<HD>Roll Reversal Is Going Strong</HD>

<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>Behold the power of the Angels, who are so hot that they called up a
guy with a .103 lifetime average, put him into the lineup and watched
him turn into an instant hero.</LD>
<LD>   Julio Ramirez, promoted from the minor leagues Wednesday, did not
arrive here Thursday until two hours before game time. He started in
right field, dropped a beautiful bunt single in his first at-bat and
threw out a runner at home plate--on the fly--as part of the Angels'
highlight reel in an 8-0 victory over the Cleveland Indians.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels extended their winning streak to seven games, their
longest in four years. And squeakers these are not--the Angels have
outscored opponents, 69-19, during the streak, never winning by fewer
than three runs.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a good roll, no doubt about it," said reliever Dennis Cook,
whose earned-run average fell to 0.90. "It seems like everything
we're doing is right."</TE>
<TE>   The reverse is true for the Indians, who have lost 14 of 16 and
were outscored, 36-4, in these three games.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to give them a lot of credit for sweeping us,"
Cleveland Manager Charlie Manuel said, "even though I don't think
we're that bad. In fact, I know we're not this bad."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were singing that chorus last week, when they were
6-14. Now look at them: Kevin Appier pitched six shutout innings
Thursday to extend his string of consecutive scoreless innings to 13
and lower the staff ERA during the streak to 1.99. Troy Glaus drove
in two runs Thursday and eight for the series; he is hitting .455
during the winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   David Eckstein, the leadoff hitter, had three hits Thursday and
has scored nine runs during the streak. Bengie Molina had two hits
and is batting .449 during the streak. Darin Erstad had seven hits in
the sweep and contributed a spectacular diving catch Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time we chipped in," Erstad said of the hitters.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon chipped in Thursday, as the designated hitter. After
striking out three times, he hit the 250th home run of his career in
the ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   "They handed me the ball and I said, 'OK, great.' For two and a
half hours, I'm having a miserable game. Two seconds later, it all
changes."</TE>
<TE>   To the Angels, the most gratifying aspect of their success is
their situational hitting, a focus in spring training.</TE>
<TE>   In the series, they scored four runs on sacrifice flies, stole six
bases, drew 15 walks and batted .489 with runners in scoring
position.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the Angels batted .242 with men in scoring position.
This season, they lead the major leagues at .326.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez, the newcomer, wasplaying center field in a triple-A game
in Sacramento Wednesday. In the fourth inning, he was yanked and told
to pack for Cleveland, and back to the majors.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He hit .143 in 15 games for Florida in 1999 and .081 in 22 games
for the Chicago White Sox last year. Chicago released him in spring
training, and the Angels never would have signed him had they not
lost their triple-A center fielder, Nathan Haynes, to injury.</TE>
<TE>   The way the Angels are going, Ramirez could develop into a hitter
before their very eyes.</TE>

<HD>Cameron Crazy: 4 HRs</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Mariner outfielder hits two homers in first
inning and ties record in 15-4 victory over White Sox. He almost hits
a fifth in his final at-bat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Mike Cameron was always known as the guy who took away home runs.</LD>
<LD>   Not anymore.</LD>
<LD>   Cameron hit four homers and came close to a record-setting fifth
Thursday night, leading the Seattle Mariners over the Chicago White
Sox, 15-4.</LD>
<TE>   Cameron, until now recognized for his Gold Glove and being part of
the trade for Ken Griffey Jr., became only the 13th player in major
league history to homer four times in a game and the first since Mark
Whiten in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   In the ninth inning, Cameron lined an opposite-field drive that
had the Comiskey Park crowd thinking he'd done it. But right fielder
Jeff Liefer made a running, backhanded catch at the front of the
warning track.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to cherish it forever," Cameron said. "I'm going to
enjoy this day to the utmost. This is the best day of my baseball
career."</TE>
<TE>   Cameron connected in his first four at-bats, doing it in five
innings. He got two more chances to be the first player in the
132-year history of big league ball to homer five times in a game.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh, Cameron was hit by a pitch from Mike Porzio in the
back of the left thigh, drawing boos from the crowd of 12,891.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron then flied out.</TE>
<TE>   "The wind wasn't going too well to right-center. I hit it well. I
struck it as best as I could," he said. "I thought I had a base hit
on that one."</TE>
<TE>   Whiten hit four homers on Sept. 7, 1993, for St. Louis in the
second game of a doubleheader. Rocky Colavito was the last to do it
in the American League, on June 10, 1959, for Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron began his historic night by joining Bret Boone as the
first teammates ever to both hit two home runs in the same inning.
They connected back-to-back twice in a 10-run first.</TE>
<TE>   "This first one, I got a ball that was kind of in on me a little
bit, and I got it up in the wind a bit, I guess," he said. "The
second one, I knew I extended it pretty good on this one. I knew that
was gone."</TE>
<TE>   Cameron hit a solo shot in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   "Just full extension," he said. "I just hit it well."</TE>
<TE>   With two out in the fifth, Cameron hit another solo homer on a 2-1
count. As his fourth shot soared toward center field, a loud,
"Ohhhh!" went up from the crowd. He rounded the bases with a big grin
on his face and slapped hands with third-base coach Dave Myers.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just trying to hit the ball real hard right here. And it
just carried out for me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Sierra, one of Cameron's closest friends on the team,
greeted him with a big hug after he crossed home plate. And with the
crowd giving him a standing ovation, he headed to the dugout as the
rest of the Mariners came out to greet him.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron, 29, started his major league career with the White Sox in
1995.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron began this night with five home runs in 91 at-bats, and he
hadn't homered since April 15, a span of 41 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, as his average dipped to .238, he visited an eye doctor
last week. Because of problems in one eye, he was considering using a
contact lens.</TE>
<TE>   Along with his four solo homers--the first one off Jon Rauch and
the last three against Jim Parque--Cameron made one of his trademark
defensive gems. He reached high above the center-field wall to rob
Magglio Ordonez of what would have been a grand slam.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron is only the fifth player to hit four home runs
consecutively. He had never hit more than two homers in a game.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Lee and Royce Clayton hit solo homers for the White Sox.
Rauch (0-1) gave up eight runs--five earned--and six hits in
one-third of an inning. He was booed as he left the field.</TE>
<TE>   James Baldwin (3-1) gave up four runs and seven hits in seven
innings to beat his former team. Of course, he had Cameron to thank
for that.</TE>

<KH>DODGERS 3, REDS 2 (14)</KH>
<HD>Beltre Blooper Is a Big Relief</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers' series finale against the Cincinnati Reds turned into a
late-night battle of the bullpens Thursday, with relievers from both
teams combining for 12 shutout innings before the Reds finally
blinked in the bottom of the 14th.</LD>
<LD>   Moments after what was left of a Dodger Stadium crowd of 27,224
sang a 14th-inning stretch, Adrian Beltre flared an RBI single into
right field to lift the Dodgers to a 3-2 victory over the Reds,
ending a 3-hour 55-minute affair and the Dodgers' two-game losing
streak.</LD>
<LD>   Shawn Green beat out an opposite-field chopper behind the
third-base bag for a single to open the 14th and took second on Eric
Karros' groundout to third, which came on a full-count pitch with
Green running.</LD>
<TE>   Red reliever Scott Sullivan intentionally walked Marquis Grissom,
and Beltre dumped his game-winning hit to right, as Ruben Mateo's
attempt for a diving catch came up short.</TE>
<TE>   The best previous scoring threat in extra innings came in the
11th, when Paul Lo Duca, who knocked in the Dodgers' first two runs
with a single and a home run, singled to right with one out and
Green, hitless in his previous 11 at-bats, lined an opposite-field
single to left, putting runners on first and second.</TE>
<TE>   Karros worked a full-count against Red closer Danny Graves, and
Manager Jim Tracy chose to send the runners on the next pitch, hoping
to stay out of a double play. But Karros lined out to center fielder
Juan Encarnacion, who had plenty of time to double Lo Duca off second
to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger reliever Giovanni Carrara (1-0) retired the side in order
in the top of the 14th, capping six hitless innings by the Dodger
bullpen, to gain the victory, and left-hander Omar Daal threw three
perfect innings, striking out four.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Quantrill retired the side in order in the 10th, and closer
Eric Gagne threw a scoreless ninth, but it wasn't easy for the Dodger
closer.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 2-2, Gagne walked Sean Casey to open the
inning, the third free pass the right-hander has issued in 14 innings
this season. Pinch-runner Reggie Taylor stole second and took third
on Adam Dunn's fly ball to deep right.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Boone squared for a suicide squeeze, missing the bunt but
getting hit on the right shoulder with the pitch. Home-plate umpire
Brian Gorman awarded Boone first base and sent Taylor back to third.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy argued the pitch should have been called a strike, but
Gorman, after conferring with first-base umpire Phil Cuzzi, stuck
with a hit by pitch, putting runners on first and third.</TE>
<TE>   Wilton Guerrero popped to third baseman Beltre, who made the catch
in foul territory, and Mateo grounded to first, where Karros made a
nice play to stab the ball down the line and tossed to Gagne covering
the bag to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Odalis Perez gave the Dodgers another strong start,
giving up two runs and five hits in eight innings, striking out five
and walking none, but for the sixth time this season, a Dodger
starter gave up two earned runs or fewer in five innings or more and
didn't get the win.</TE>
<TE>   Of Perez's 93 pitches, 70 were strikes. But one pitch, a
seventh-inning fastball that didn't seem like much of a mistake, cost
him a chance for the win, when Dunn drove it over the wall in
left-center to tie the score at 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the first when Dave Roberts
singled, stole second, took third on Cesar Izturis' grounder to the
right side and scored on Lo Duca's RBI single to center.</TE>
<TE>   The Reds equalized in the third when Jason LaRue singled, took
second on Elmer Dessens sacrifice bunt, stole third and scored on
Barry Larkin's sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca's leadoff home run to left in the fourth gave the Dodgers
a 2-1 advantage, and a strong throw from Grissom, subbing for the
injured Brian Jordan in left, preserved the lead in the top of the
fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Mateo doubled to left with one out, and LaRue lined a single to
left. Mateo had to freeze, making sure the ball wasn't caught, before
he broke for third. Third-base coach Tim Foli waved Mateo home, but
Grissom air-mailed a throw to Lo Duca, nailing Mateo by a good eight
feet.</TE>

<HD>Murray Moves Up With the Ducks</HD>
<DH>Hockey: He relinquishes Anaheim coaching duties to become
general manager. His first task is to hire a coach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bryan Murray, the coach who held the Mighty Ducks together despite a
disappointing season, was hired as the team's senior vice president
and general manager Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Murray, who will relinquish his coaching duties, has previously
been general manager at Detroit and Florida. He replaces Pierre
Gauthier, who was fired after four seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Murray's chore is considerable, considering the Ducks finished
tied for 13th this season, were last in 2000-01, and have qualified
for the Stanley Cup playoffs only twice in their nine-year existence.
They have had three general managers and five coaches.</LD>
<TE>   "For the players' sake, I would like to see a couple changes to
show them that we really care, that we really want to win," Murray
said. "It might only be lateral moves, because it is hard to make
huge upgrades. We want to show them we believe."</TE>
<TE>   First off, that means hiring a coach.</TE>
<TE>   Although Murray said that previous NHL head coaching experience
would not be a requirement, there is a long list of former head
coaches to choose from, among them Ken Hitchcock, who was at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Duck assistant Guy Charron, who served as head coach for
two-thirds of the 2000-01 season, and Colorado assistant coach Bryan
Trottier may also be considered. King assistant Dave Tippett was
among the candidates considered for the Duck job last year, when
Murray was hired. Murray did rule out his brother, Terry Murray, whom
he hired to coach the Florida Panthers.</TE>
<TE>   "I really hope to have someone in place by the draft [June 22-23],
hopefully well before the draft," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Finding the right coach isn't the only difficult task at hand.</TE>
<TE>   Interest in the team has dwindled, attendance having dropped for
five consecutive seasons. The Ducks were last in the NHL in
attendance this season. The business side of the operation--ticket
sales, sponsors, marketing--will be handled by Doug Moss, recently
hired as senior vice president of business operations, but Murray has
to provide a team people will want to pay to see.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had an encouraging finish this season, going 15-13-2
over the last 30 games. Yet they finished 25 points out of a playoff
spot.</TE>
<TE>   There is a solid core of players--Paul Kariya, Jean-Sebastien
Giguere, Keith Carney, Matt Cullen, Mike Leclerc, Oleg Tverdovsky,
Jeff Friesen and Keith Carney. Yet, there is a gaping hole on
offense.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks scored two or fewer goals in 58 of 82 games. They lost
21 one-goal games.</TE>
<TE>   "The latter part of the year, I thought the team came together
fairly nicely," Murray said. "We have on defense three, four, five
guys who are very adequate, good players. We have five, six, seven
forwards.... If there is a free agent there who brings something
special to the table, then we will inquire about him."</TE>
<TE>   The special thing the Ducks need is a scorer. Only the Columbus
Blue Jackets scored fewer goals last season, and the team's power
play ranked last in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey's Bobby Holik, Boston's Bill Guerin, San Jose's Teemu
Selanne and Chicago's Tony Amonte are the prominent players who
probably will be unrestricted free agents this summer. Murray could
also seek a trade, as he did in Florida when he acquired Pavel Bure.
The Ducks, however, lack the depth necessary for such a blockbuster
deal.</TE>
<TE>   "It might be hard to get the top guys to come because they may
think we're far from being in the playoffs," Murray said. "Maybe we
can convince them to come here and helps us get to the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question we have to address the offense. If we get
that kind of player, then we have addressed our power play at the
same time. We get that and continue to improve defensively, I think
we can play awfully well with any team."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pressler, the Disney executive who oversees the Ducks and
Angels, said he was impressed with Murray's record as a general
manager. Murray laid the foundation for two Stanley Cup championships
in Detroit, bringing in such players as Sergei Fedorov and Nicklas
Lidstrom.</TE>
<TE>   He spent seven seasons as the general manager at Florida and
assembled a team that reached the Stanley Cup final in 1996, losing
to the Colorado Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he has a tremendous eye for talent, and demonstrated an
ability to develop young players, which is critical for any team in
the league," Pressler said. "Most importantly, he has a passion to
win."</TE>
<TE>   That passion was unrequited here. The Ducks were basically out of
the playoff race in November.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tough at the start of the season," Leclerc said. "There
was a little feeling-out process, as any team has with a new coach.
He was getting to know the players. We could have went the other way,
but he kept us together, kept things a lot looser and took a lot of
stress off us."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, though, will have another coaching transition to make.
They have had three since December 2000--Craig Hartsburg, Charron and
Murray.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been nice to have [Murray] back as coach, no
question about that, because we kind of know what to expect from
him," center Steve Rucchin said. "But I think some of us are used to
this. It has happened to us a few times in the last few years. We
should be able to assist the new coach because we're familiar with
this situation."</TE>
<TE>   Besides hiring a new coach, Murray also must sign the team's
restricted free agents, with team captain Kariya topping that list.
Kariya made $10 million last season.</TE>
<TE>   Cullen, Rucchin, defenseman Ruslan Salei, defenseman Vitaly
Vishnevski and goalie Steve Shields are other key players who are
restricted free agents.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Bryan knows what it takes to win in this league," Rucchin
said. "He had hands-on experience with the team and should be a
really good judge of what guys here can do and what he needs to bring
in."</TE>

<HD>Loaded Indy 500 Field Won't Include Gordon</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sunday is opening day of practice for the 86th Indianapolis 500,
which has a field reminiscent of an all-comers meet.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Andretti, perhaps the greatest driver to never win, Gil de
Ferran, the two-time champion of the CART FedEx Series, and Sam
Hornish Jr., the champion of the Indy Racing League, will be in a
field that has six former champions-- Arie Luyendyk, Al Unser Jr.,
Kenny Brack, Eddie Cheever, Buddy Lazier, and last year's winner,
Helio Castroneves.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, there are some serious players at Indy this year,"
said Winston Cup driver Robby Gordon, who also will compete, along
with a few drivers with Formula One experience, such as Johnny
Herbert. "I wish Tony Stewart was going over. That's one player we'd
like to have. If we had him, we'd have everybody. I'd love to see
Jeff Gordon."</LD>
<TE>   Everybody would love to see Jeff Gordon, the four-time Winston Cup
champion. But Gordon has no plans to race the Indy 500 and Coca-Cola
600 on the same day, as Robby Gordon and Stewart have done.</TE>
<TE>   "The race is something that appeals to me, but to do them both in
one day really doesn't," Jeff Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be sweating it out all day long, whether or not I'm going to
be able to make it [for the start of the night Winston Cup race in
Charlotte]. If it rained one single drop [in Indianapolis] I'd be
freaking out.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what the guys on these race teams do, the effort they put
into each event, especially the big events, and if I'm off doing
another race, what would be going through their minds is, 'It's a
neat opportunity for Jeff, but is he really going to be 100% here
with us when he gets back?' I don't want those guys to ever doubt how
bad I want to win Winston Cup races.</TE>
<TE>   "It's different for me too, because I'm a part owner, and I play a
much larger role than just a driver."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon said he has had several offers to race at Indy, but he
remembers his early days, when he tried to get involved in open-wheel
racing in the CART series.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it goes back to [trying] to pursue Indy cars and getting
turned down by those guys," he said. "I went to CART races, I went to
the Indy 500 and talked to a lot of people. They all said, 'Yeah,
we'd love to put you into our car. Bring this much money and you've
got a deal.' To me, that didn't send a very good message.</TE>
<TE>   "I went down and started talking to the NASCAR guys and they're
like, 'Yeah, we're looking for a talented driver that can get the job
done, and we'll find the sponsorship if we can get the right person
in there.' That, to me, was the opportunity I was looking for."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the loss of Gordon contributed to Tony George's
forming the Indy Racing League, and today, the CART-IRL split helps
keep Gordon away.</TE>
<TE>   "The split made it less appealing," he said. "Now it seems to be
coming back around, now you have the Andrettis and Unsers and some
really talented drivers in the IRL and some really top teams coming
in there. The competition is a lot tougher, a lot stiffer.</TE>
<TE>   "That makes it more appealing, but I'm pretty comfortable doing it
the way I'm doing it now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PJ Jones will make his first Indy 500 start after being selected
by team owner John Menard as the replacement for injured Jaques
Lazier, who fractured a vertebra in a race crash with Tomas Scheckter
at Nazareth, Pa., on April 21. Jones, son of 1963 winner Parnelli
Jones, will be a teammate of Robby Gordon. Lazier, of Alta Loma, was
released from the hospital on Tuesday and could be out of racing for
as long as six months.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis Motor Speedway has installed so-called "soft walls"
in its turns. The SAFER (Steel and Foam Energy Reduction) barrier
system, developed by the IRL and the University of Nebraska Lincoln's
Midwest Roadside Safety Facility, makes IMS the first superspeedway
to use energy-absorbing walls.</TE>
<TE>   The IRL has informed Penske Cars that it will not be selected as a
chassis manufacturer for the series in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Motorcycles</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa Speedway will open its 34th season Saturday at the
Orange County Fairgrounds. Chris Manchester, who won the Spring
Classic on April 13, will carry the No. 1 plate this season, and
leads a field including such riders as Bart Bast, Bobby Schwartz,
Gary Hicks, Mike Faria, Josh Larsen and Shawn McConnell. Gates open
at 5:30 p.m., and racing begins at 7:30.</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Carmichael's 250cc victory last weekend in Salt Lake City
gave the Honda rider his second consecutive AMA/EA Sports Supercross
title. The season ends Saturday at Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas with
a pay-per-view event that includes the 125cc East-West Shootout.
Carmichael will be going for his 10th victory in 16 races.</TE>
<TE>   Yamaha rider David Vuillemin is second to Carmichael, and
seven-time champion Jeremy McGrath needs a victory on his Yamaha to
extend to 10 his streak of consecutive seasons with a victory.</TE>
<TE>   Honda rider Nicky Hayden, who has won two of three races this
season in the AMA Chevy Trucks U.S. Superbike Championship series,
has a 14-point lead over Yamaha's Anthony Gobert as they head into
Round 4 this weekend at Sears Point in Sonoma.</TE>
<TE>   Water Sports</TE>
<TE>   It's not that Kelle Skelton wants to carry the flag for women in
the International Jet Sport Boating Assn. Pro Watercraft Tour today
and Saturday at San Buenaventura State Beach in Ventura, it's just
that the 21-year-old has a history of beating the men she competes
against.</TE>
<TE>   The New Zealander didn't begin riding competitively until 1998 but
by 2001, she was the national champion in her native New Zealand in
pro runabout superstock 1200 and 785 classes, meaning no men were
titleholders in the premier classes.</TE>
<TE>   "After completing my first season [as pro-am women's runabout
national champion] in New Zealand, the next step was to race the
men," Skelton said. "It's just a matter of being the best I can be,
and in return, that could be the best in the world. I still feel I'm
a long way off, but you can't get better competition than what's
here."</TE>

<TE>   Ricky Gaunt took first and Steve Ostling second in last week's
SCRA sprint car race at Perris Auto Speedway, foiling third-place
Cory Kruseman's bid for a third consecutive main event victory there.
Perris, which features super stocks, champ trucks, dwarf cars and
lightning sprints on Saturday, will have freestyle motorcycle riders
tonight at 8 as part of the Freestylemx.com tour. Kruseman will be
after his second straight Jeff Bagley Classic victory Saturday when
the SCRA sprint car series makes its season debut at Ventura Raceway.</TE>
<TE>   Irwindale Speedway will have the super late models, super stocks,
legends, American race trucks and modified 4s Saturday night. After
four races in super late models, Tony Green of Oak Hills has already
opened a 44-point lead over Brent Reynolds of Escondido.</TE>
<TE>   The NHRA announced that its Summit Sport Compact drag racing
series has added a new category, pro V-8.... Longtime Winston West

"Well, I just retired," he said. "If I cannot keep up, be near the
front, have fun and be comfortable, which is how it has been, then I
think the time has come."</TE>

<LD>Unable to reach an agreement with the players' union, the NBA will
retain the best-of-five format for the first round of the playoffs,
Commissioner David Stern said in New York.</LD>
<LD>   "I told the players' association that it would be important for
the league to go to seven, but they're not going to accept that and
that's too bad," Stern said.</LD>
<LD>   Plans to go to a best-of-seven format for the first round were
part of the league's new six-year TV contracts with ABC and Turner
Sports, although the change was subject to union approval. Union
officials said most of the players oppose an extended first round.</LD>
<TE>   The only change will be a maximum of three days off between
first-round games, Stern said.</TE>

<HD>Miller Can't Stop the Nets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Another playoff miracle by Reggie Miller, a banked-in three-point
shot at the buzzer in regulation, couldn't stop Jason Kidd from
leading the New Jersey Nets out of the first round for the first time
in 18 years.</LD>
<LD>   Kidd scored 20 of his career-playoff best 31 points in the fourth
quarter and two overtimes and the Nets ousted Miller and the Pacers,
120-109, Thursday night in the deciding Game 5 of their first-round
series.</LD>
<LD>   Miller was at his best under pressure, scoring from 35 feet to
force overtime and tying the score again on a two-handed dunk with
3.1 seconds left in the first overtime. But he went 0 for 4 in the
second overtime--all on three-point shots.</LD>
<TE>   It marked only the second time since the Nets joined the NBA in
1976-77 that they have made it out of the first round. The only other
time was in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   "To do that for this franchise means a lot to me and my
teammates," said Kenyon Martin, who added 29 points. Keith Van Horn
had 27 before fouling out as New Jersey advanced to a best-of-seven
Eastern Conference semifinal against the Charlotte Hornets.</TE>
<TE>   Miller had 31 points in only the third series-deciding playoff
game in history to go to double-overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's miraculous three-pointer that barely beat the buzzer--the
initial replay seemed to support the officials but the second showed
Miller with the ball still in his hands as time expired--almost ended
the greatest season in Nets' history.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd wouldn't let it happen.</TE>
<TE>   Even though his jumper at the end of the first overtime went in
and out, Kidd set up a three-point play by Kerry Kittles and then
added a jumper with 3:07 left to give the Nets a lead they never
lost.</TE>
<TE>   "We just left it all on the court," Martin said. "It was Game 5,
we wanted to take it. J. Kidd stepped up and showed why he's MVP."</TE>
<TE>   Mercer scored for Indiana to make it 112-109 with 2:45 left, but
the Pacers went scoreless afterward.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets seemingly had the series locked up after Kevin Ollie
missed a drive down the lane with five seconds to play and New Jersey
ahead, 96-93.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Jefferson got the rebound and needed to make one of two
free throws to ice the game.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson missed both, however, and the Pacers rushed the ball
upcourt for Miller's heroics.</TE>

<HD>Vanderbilt Coach Quits Over Resume</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after being hired, Tom Collen quit as women's basketball coach
at Vanderbilt on Thursday because of inaccuracies on his 1997 resume.</LD>
<LD>   Vanderbilt gave the former Colorado State coach a choice--resign
or be fired--after a newspaper published a portion of the old resume
that incorrectly claimed he earned two master's degrees.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a deal breaker," Vanderbilt Athletic Director Todd Turner
said.</LD>
<TE>   The case comes five months after George O'Leary, the former
football coach at Georgia Tech, lost his job at Notre Dame within a
week of his hiring. He falsely claimed on his resume that he had a
master's degree in education and had earned three letters as a New
Hampshire football player. He attended New Hampshire only two years
and didn't play in any games.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Vanderbilt checked Collen's bio on Colorado State's Web
site, which credited him with master's degrees in health education
and recreational programming from Miami of Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   When the university asked for verification, Collen gave officials
transcripts, diplomas and a resume correctly showing one master's
degree in physical education and health education.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the discrepancy, Vanderbilt hired him Wednesday. When it
became clear Thursday that the mistake was on the 1997 resume Collen
gave Colorado State--not only on the Web site--Vanderbilt changed its
mind.</TE>

<HD>Leiweke: L.A. May Get Team in 2003</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Anschutz president also confirms plans to
build NFL stadium adjacent to Staples.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A key principal in a group trying to bring the NFL back to Los
Angeles confirmed, for the first time, plans to build a downtown
stadium adjacent to Staples Center and outlined a best-case scenario
that would have a team ready to play here as soon as the 2003 season.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Leiweke, president of Anschutz Entertainment Group, on
Thursday identified South Park as the stadium site--although he did
not name specific streets. He said it would require less than 55
acres, originally believed to be the size of the project.Leiweke, who
to date has refused to discuss the specifics of the project, broke
his public silence in a speech to the board of directors of the Los
Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce.</LD>
<LD>   "He wanted to let us know the project is moving along," said Rusty
Hammer, the chamber's president and chief executive, who was in
attendance. "They want to know if they have the support of the
business community.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone that I talked to is very much in support of seeing if
this can happen."</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke, who did not return phone calls seeking further comment,
is part of a coalition led by Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz that
includes L.A. Avenger owner Casey Wasserman, supermarket billionaire
Ron Burkle, and developer Ed Roski. Leiweke and Wasserman will meet
with NFL executives next week to discuss the details of bringing a
team, and Super Bowls, back to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Because the league has no plans to expand beyond its current 32
teams, an existing team will have to relocate to L.A. The heavy
favorite is the San Diego Chargers, who are already putting the
finishing touches on negotiations to move their training camp to
Anschutz's tennis and soccer facility in Carson. That $120-million
complex is expected to be completed in time for Charger training camp
in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Although Anschutz lives in Colorado, he has proved he has the
ability to navigate L.A.'s choppy political waters to get major
projects completed. In September, the City Council approved his plans
for a $1-billion, 27-acre hotel and theater development near Staples
Center, which he also owns.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes magazine estimated his net worth at more than $9.6 billion,
placing him 16th on the 2001 list of wealthiest Americans and 54th on
the list of the world's wealthiest people.</TE>
<TE>   AEG, a collection of 32 companies, manages Staples Center, the
Forum, the Kodak Theater, and L.A. Live, a 7,000-seat theater to be
built across from Staples.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke's speech was as much about AEG's plans for theaters,
shopping centers and downtown housing as a state-of-the-art stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "It was impressive," said Charlie Woo, CEO of Megatoys and past
chair of the chamber of commerce. "Very ambitious. He wasn't talking
about the distant future; he was talking about things that could
happen two years down the road."</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke's comments come one day after the Los Angeles City Council
held a hearing on a massive redevelopment district with the potential
to generate billions of dollars in tax revenue, some of which could
be used to help clear the land for a downtown stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would allow land acquisitions through condemnation and
create a mechanism to capture tax-increment revenues from the
879-acre district including South Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen these type of proposals before," Hammer said. "But
if anyone can do this, Tim Leiweke and this team can bring this thing
to a reality."</TE>

<LD>There goes Tex Winter, still tinkering, still tweaking players, still
seeking perfect execution of his beloved triangle offense.</LD>
<LD>   That's him lobbing entry passes into players who seem twice his
size.</LD>
<LD>   There's the legendary eater, finishing off another meal in the
media dining room before a game at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   At 80 years old, the Laker assistant coach is still going strong.
But one of the little subplots of these 2002 playoffs is that Winter
could be going, going, gone.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't made the announcement yet, but I'm considering
[retiring] at the end of the year," Winter said.</TE>
<TE>   He was very close to calling it quits after the Lakers won the
championship last year. The Lakers brought Kurt Rambis to the bench
as an assistant coach, and Winter wanted to be assured that he wasn't
being pushed aside. A lighter workload was one thing; obsolescence
was another.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always said I don't want to be around just to be
accommodated," Winter said. "I want to feel like I can make a
contribution. And I feel like I can. When I feel like I can't, then I
know it's time to quit. It may be time to quit anyway depending on my
health and what I want to do the rest of my life."</TE>
<TE>   That's the tricky part. What to do next? He doesn't have a clue.
He hasn't really thought about it. He hasn't thought about anything
or dedicated himself to doing anything other than coaching basketball
for the last 55 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think him and Chick [Hearn] are just alike," Laker forward
Robert Horry said. "If they hang it up, they're going to cease to
exist."</TE>
<TE>   Winter's journey began a month after college graduation in 1947,
when he joined the Kansas State staff as an assistant, and his career
has taken him through the Big 12, the Pacific 10 and the Big West
conferences (when they were known as the Big 8, the Pac-8 and the
Pacific Coast Athletic Assn.), in addition to the Big Ten and the
Southeastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   He was head coach at Marquette, Kansas State, Washington,
Northwestern and Long Beach State and in the pros with the San Diego
Rockets. He also has been an assistant at Louisiana State and the
Chicago Bulls. In college and the pros, he has coached or coached
against such basketball legends as Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, Oscar Robertson, Michael Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd have to say I've seen it all," Winter said. "I've been very
fortunate.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't invent the game, but I've coached it longer than
anybody. Sometimes the players say I act like I've invented it."</TE>
<TE>   And if he didn't write the book on the game, he wrote a book 40
years ago, "The Triple Post Offense," which outlined the offense that
Jackson has used in winning eight championships.</TE>
<TE>   So now what?</TE>
<TE>   Should he travel the world? He already has done that through
basketball. In the last two years alone he has been to Australia, New
Zealand and Greece teaching at basketball clinics.</TE>
<TE>   Live a daredevil's life? Those who have done it will tell you
nothing is more frightening than landing an airplane on an aircraft
carrier, and Winter did that 82 times while training to be a Navy
pilot during World War II. Four of his colleagues died ... and that
was during the practice runs on the aircraft carrier Sable in Lake
Michigan. The war ended before he was called to duty.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's time for more television commercials. He liked making
that IBM commercial, the one where he drops in on a team (including
former NBA stars Moses Malone, Bill Laimbeer, Muggsy Bogues and
Detlef Schrempf), gives a to-the-point lesson on his triangle offense
and charges an outrageous consultant fee.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a great experience," he said of his acting debut. "Not
to mention the residuals."</TE>
<TE>   He got the gig because a player he coached at Northwestern, Chris
Wall, now serves as a creative director for the ad agency Ogilvy &amp;
Mather.</TE>
<TE>   When someone mentioned in a meeting that they wanted an old
basketball coach, Wall said, "I've got the ideal guy for us."</TE>
<TE>   It's an example of the type of lasting bonds Winter has formed
throughout the years. Another Northwestern player, Billy McKinney,
recalls helping Winter move his stuff from an apartment to a condo.</TE>
<TE>   "You usually don't have that type of relationship with a coach,
where you would help him move," said McKinney, now an executive vice
president for the Seattle SuperSonics. "But he had that kind of
impact on my life."</TE>
<TE>   And even though Winter has been telling McKinney that he's going
to retire for the last 10 years, McKinney said: "I'd have to see it
first. I'd have to really see it."</TE>
<TE>   Winter thought he was ready to retire once. He and his wife Nancy
had the Toyota truck packed up and were ready to head to her home
state of Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   That was 17 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   That was before he even got to the good part of his career, the
time when he coached the best of the best, won world championships
and made tons of money.</TE>
<TE>   That was before he got a call from an old friend asking him to
join the coaching staff of the Chicago Bulls. The request came in
1985 from a guy named Jerry Krause, the new general manager of the
Bulls.</TE>
<TE>   Winter knew Krause from the days when Krause was a scout for the
Baltimore Bullets, and they had always been friendly. When Krause
agreed to pay him twice as much as he'd ever earned as a college
coach, they were in business.</TE>
<TE>   Winter was an assistant to Doug Collins, along with Phil Jackson.
Four years later, Jackson replaced Collins. Two years after that, the
Bulls won their first of six championships.</TE>
<TE>   When Jackson came to the Lakers and wanted Winter to join him, it
was like coming home. He went to high school in Huntington Park, went
to junior college in Compton and played at USC.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to imagine Jackson on the bench without Winter
sitting beside him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been a great soldier and a student and sat along me and
beside me for many hours of videotape," Jackson said. "He's made
adjustments over these playoffs for a long time. I still don't see
why he won't continue a consulting role and kind of find a way into
it at some level."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has heard the same thing from Winter every year, that he
would have to sit down at the end of the season and decide if he
wanted to come back.</TE>
<TE>   Things do feel a little different this time.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the year that he didn't travel on the road with us,
unless there were special situations," Jackson said. "One time he did
go on the road with us, he ended up in the hospital in the emergency
room [after a bad reaction to a spicy postgame meal in Philadelphia
in January]. That was really kind of an exclamation [point] behind
that maybe this is a situation where it is nature's turn to kind of
dictate terms. This is a guy that's defied age. He's been a youthful
man all his adult life, his mature life."</TE>
<TE>   The only accomplishment missing from his resume is a spot in the
Hall of Fame. He has been nominated again, this time as a
"contributor." The inductees will be announced June 5.</TE>
<TE>   So Winter hopes he'll get in this time, after coming up short four
times.</TE>
<TE>   And he ponders what else there could be in this world. He's not
averse to change. After all these years he just learned to type,
because lately he spends a lot of time at the computer sending e-mail
and checking his investment portfolio. More new lessons await.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure there's a lot of other things in life other than just
basketball," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, "My idea is to get someplace where I can bring all my
junk and just stay put."</TE>
<TE>   The "junk" consists of mementos he has collected in his career.
And his most cherished items are his eight championship rings.</TE>
<TE>   "I wear the last one, generally," Winter said. "But I like 'em
all."</TE>

<HD>Pistons Are Back in Hunt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AUBURN HILLS, Mich.</DL>
<LD>The Detroit Pistons proved all season that they could win without
Jerry Stackhouse carrying the scoring load. They did it again
Thursday night when it really counted.</LD>
<LD>   Stackhouse had only five points, but his first field goal after an
0-for-8 start put Detroit ahead to stay with 1:43 left as the Pistons
eliminated the Toronto Raptors, 85-82, in the deciding Game 5 of
their first-round series.</LD>
<LD>   The Pistons are in the second round of the NBA playoffs for the
first time since 1991 and the first time in Stackhouse's career.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone outside this room said all the weight was on me, but
that's not how this team works," said Stackhouse, who finished one
for 10 from the field and three for five at the line. "Our veteran
guys, like Cliff [Robinson], Corliss [Williamson] and Jon Barry
stepped up and won the game for us."</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors had a chance to become only the seventh team to
overcome a 2-0 deficit to win a best-of-five series.</TE>
<TE>   But they made only one basket in the final two minutes, and Chris
Childs forced up a bad shot with seven seconds left on Toronto's
final possession.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit will play the winner of the Boston-Philadelphia series,
with Game 1 set for Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew Stack was going to hit a big shot," Detroit Coach Rick
Carlisle said. "I just felt it in my heart."</TE>
<TE>   Stackhouse, Detroit's leading scorer, didn't score at all until
making a free throw with 9:38 left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Williamson, the NBA's sixth man of the year, scored a
career-playoff high 23 points.</TE>
<TE>   Del Curry led the Raptors with 17 points, 14 of them coming in the
final quarter.</TE>

<KH>Bill Plaschke /128TH KENTUCKY DERBY</KH>
<HD>Ain't Life Grand at 50-1?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>His room is on the backside of the backside, a stall facing the
street, miles from the cameras, days from the finish line.</LD>
<LD>   His name tag is a homemade wreath tacked to a wall above a
pitchfork and a rake.</LD>
<LD>   His protection is a homemade blanket one size too small.</LD>
<TE>   He arrived at Churchill Downs not because of victory, but because
of a recent late-night phone call from owner Darwin Olson to trainer
Wilson Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's run him in the Derby," Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   "What Derby?" Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   His name is It'sallinthechase.</TE>
<TE>   But it should be changed to Ain't Never Been.</TE>
<TE>   "I ain't never been to a Kentucky Derby," said Brown, the trainer
from Cement, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   "I ain't never been neither," said Rusty Paul, the red-headed
groom who lives wherever her trailer is parked.</TE>
<TE>   The owner ain't never had a horse in the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   The jockey ain't never ridden in a Derby.</TE>
<TE>   The jockey, in fact, ain't never even officially ridden this
horse.</TE>
<TE>   It'sallinthechase, a 50-1 longshot to be ridden by Eddie Martin
Jr. Saturday, is a plodding example of the excesses that are
supposedly ruining this race.</TE>
<TE>   And a wonderful example of how they only make it better.</TE>
<TE>   Although It'sallinthechase was one of the bottom three horses that
fattened this field to 20, this is not about an excess of bodies.</TE>
<TE>   It's about an excess of hope.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody writes that we have no chance," Brown said. "But, you
know, the horse can't read."</TE>
<TE>   It's about an excess of innocence.</TE>
<TE>   "I got here and they gave me a car to use all week for free,"
Brown said. "I thought that was the most amazing thing until I
realized they also put gas in it."</TE>
<TE>   It's about an excess of humor.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw three ladies watching him work the other day, reading their
form," Paul said. "I bet that under his name, it read, 'Ha, ha, ha.'"</TE>
<TE>   What such an assessment lacks in details, it makes up for in
accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   In his last race, the Arkansas Derby three weeks ago,
It'sallinthechase finished ninth.</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't finished higher than third in any race this year.</TE>
<TE>   He has, in fact, never won a race that wasn't held at minor-league
Remington Park in Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   "After the Arkansas Derby, I cried all the way home, because I
didn't think we had a chance at Kentucky," Paul said.</TE>
<TE>   But she was forgetting what Bob Baffert says is the best thing
about this big event.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a race that allows owners to dream in Technicolor," he says.</TE>
<TE>   And so, back home in Rochester, Minn., where he owns an insurance
agency, Darwin Olson dreamed.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought about how my heart pumps so fast when my horse is
running, it's like I'm having a child, and you can't put a price on
that," Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   He thought about how his family--and Brown's family--might never
have a chance at a Kentucky experience again.</TE>
<TE>   "We're first-timers, and maybe only-timers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He then rechecked his balance sheet and saw that, with $117,000 in
graded stakes earnings, It'sallinthechase was 18th on the top 20
money list and would qualify for the race.</TE>
<TE>   Some say that system, because it allows for so many horses, is
dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   I say, because it allows for so many of those Technicolor dreams,
it's splendid.</TE>
<TE>   It's like the NBA, at the end of every season allowing every team
with 39 wins to take one shot at the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   It's like It'sallinthechase is the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "Say what you want, it isn't like we didn't earn our way here,"
Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   Thus it happened that Olson paid more to enter the Derby ($30,100)
then he paid for the horse that he entered ($27,000).</TE>
<TE>   A horse that will compete against horses purchased for as much as
$2.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Brown heard the news, and phoned his brother.</TE>
<TE>   "He has the truck that we needed to haul the horse here from
Oklahoma," he said. "I guess some people actually fly their horses
here, huh?"</TE>
<TE>   Then, when he realized that regular jockey Gerald Melancon
couldn't ride at Churchill Downs because of a past infraction here,
Brown had to make another phone call.</TE>
<TE>   "I needed to find me a boy to put on the horse," he said.
"Somebody told me that Eddie Martin really liked our horse, so I
called him."</TE>
<TE>   While Brown is a respected trainer at smaller tracks, his most
famous winning trip involved not a race, but a fight.</TE>
<TE>   A losing trainer once insulted him after a race, so Brown decked
him in the winner's circle.</TE>
<TE>   And while Olson is considered a good owner, his most famous
victory occurred in the Indiana Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Did you even know there was an Indiana Derby?</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the horse is here, and his handlers are taking no
chances.</TE>
<TE>   It'sallinthechase was walking toward the track for a workout the
other morning when a black cat crossed his path.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'No way, we're getting out of here,'" recalled groom
Paul, who immediately turned the horse around and entered the track
from the other side.</TE>
<TE>   Then, while getting accustomed to the race-day paddock, Brown
summoned the horse into stall No. 13.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'I'm not bringing him in there, so you better move,'"
Paul said. "So he moved."</TE>
<TE>   She told the story and howled, her laughter carrying through the
backside of the backside. It is the music of a horse that, on this
most serious of weeks, is also a message.</TE>
<TE>   It'sallinthechase, indeed.</TE>

<LD>When the Lakers begin the second round of the NBA playoffs Sunday,
Chick Hearn, as he has been doing lately, will use a walker to get to
his broadcast position at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   And Marv Albert more than likely will use a wheelchair.</LD>
<LD>   Hearn, who will be there to do the KLAC (570) broadcast, has been
using a walker since returning to work after first heart surgery and
then hip surgery.</LD>
<TE>   Albert, who will be announcing the game along with Bill Walton and
Steve "Snapper" Jones for NBC, is returning to work this weekend for
the first time since being injured in a limousine accident April 18.</TE>
<TE>   Albert will be in Sacramento Saturday for Game 1 of the Kings'
series against Dallas, then fly to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   There may be some snickers from fans when they see Albert in a
wheelchair Sunday, and Walton may get in a few playful jabs, but what
happened to Albert and his TNT broadcast partner, Mike Fratello, was
no laughing matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, we're very fortunate to be alive," Albert said Thursday
from his home in New York. "If you've seen the pictures, you know the
stretch limo was totaled."</TE>
<TE>   The two broadcasters had done a game between the Indiana Pacers
and Philadelphia 76ers in Indianapolis for TNT and flown to
Philadelphia on the 76er charter. They were traveling to New York by
limo when the accident occurred at 3 a.m. The limo struck a delivery
truck that had stalled along the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "We were both asleep," Albert said. "I don't remember a thing
about the accident. I was knocked unconscious and must have been out
for about 45 minutes. I came to in the ambulance."</TE>
<TE>   Albert is wearing a cast on an ankle that was broken in three
places. Because of painful chest and back injuries, he's unable to
use crutches. Therefore he needs a wheelchair to travel any kind of
distance.</TE>
<TE>   "I can hobble around a little, but I'm pretty sure I'll still need
a wheelchair Sunday," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Albert and Fratello will be back together for Tuesday's Game 2,
which will be televised nationally by TNT but shown locally by Fox
Sports Net.</TE>
<TE>   New Fox Lineup</TE>
<TE>   As expected, Fox announced Thursday that Joe Buck, Cris
Collinsworth and Troy Aikman will make up the network's new No. 1 NFL
announcing team, replacing Pat Summerall and John Madden.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the legendary producer-director tandem of Bob Stenner and
Sandy Grossman will be moved to the No. 2 team. Stenner and Grossman
came to Fox from CBS with Summerall and Madden.</TE>
<TE>   Moving up to the No. 1 team will be producer Richie Zyontz and
director Artie Kempner. Fox said it wanted to give the new No. 1
broadcast team a fresh start.</TE>
<TE>   Buck, who will continue as Fox's No. 1 play-by-play announcer on
baseball, will take time off from football to announce the playoffs
and World Series. Dick Stockton will move up from the No. 2 team to
fill in on those weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Fox probably won't replace Collinsworth on the pregame show. Cris
Carter and Shannon Sharpe had auditions, but at least initially Fox
plans to go with just James Brown, Terry Bradshaw and Howie Long.</TE>
<TE>   A Spot for Fouts</TE>
<TE>   Dan Fouts, who got bumped out of the "Monday Night Football" booth
after the arrival of Madden, will be paired with Keith Jackson on
Pacific 10 Conference football telecasts next season on ABC. Fouts
and Jackson have worked together before.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Brant, who had been working as an analyst with Jackson, will
go back to play-by-play.</TE>
<TE>   Reality TV Flavor</TE>
<TE>   NBC's coverage of Saturday's Kentucky Derby will have less taped
features than usual, according to producer David Michaels, the
younger brother of ABC's Al.</TE>
<TE>   NBC will be using more live action in an attempt to capture the
pageantry and excitement of being at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Michaels said that television fails to capture the true essence of
the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an experience that is larger than the small eye of
television. Television, it's almost like you really have blinders on,
and when you're there you have a full panoramic view of everything.
So finding a way through this peephole to feel and see the things you
do when you're there, that's extremely difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Michaels said seven cameras will be used to isolate seven horses.
Which seven will be determined at a production meeting tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "This could be the longest production meeting in the history of
horse racing coverage," Michaels said.</TE>
<TE>   Race coverage begins at 2 p.m., and post time is 3.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second year NBC will be televising the Triple Crown,
having taken over the series from ABC. The crew includes co-hosts Tom
Hammond and Bob Costas, analyst Charlsie Cantey, race caller Tom
Durkin, contributing analysts Mike Battaglia and Bob Neumeier,
reporter Kenny Rice and on-track reporter Donna Barton Brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Passing</TE>
<TE>   Jay Craven, 40, who worked in sales for KXTA (1150) and other
Clear Channel sister stations and occasionally was on the air on KXTA
as part of a team called "The Third String," died of cancer late last
week. The funeral was Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   No Sugarcoating</TE>
<TE>   Former Laker coach Del Harris, a guest of Chris Myers and Bob
Golic on KMPC (1540), said the relationship between Jerry West and
Jerry Buss was strained at times the past two years. Harris said
there was a "total break in trust" because West believed Buss was
listening to his kids more than he was to him.</TE>
<TE>   Recommended Viewing</TE>
<TE>   Like heartwarming stories? There are nine in a 90-minute Mother's
Day special, "Apple Pie," that will be on ESPN this Saturday at 9
a.m. before airing on May 12, Mother's Day, on ESPN Classic at 4:30
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Nine athletes and their mothers, including Shaquille O'Neal and
his mom, Lucille Harrison, were interviewed for the special. Shaq,
among other things, tries to teach his mom how to ride his Harley.</TE>
<TE>   Other athletes and theirs moms on the show include Drew Bledsoe,
Kenny Lofton, Grant Hill, Mia Hamm, Brandi Chastain, Greco Roman
wrestler Rulon Gardner, Indy race driver Sarah Fisher, and Ironman
triathlete Molly Barker. Possibly the best segment features blind
mountain climber Erik Weihenmayer and his father. Weihenmayer's
mother died in a car accident when he was 16, which was three years
after he lost his eyesight.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   On "Outside the Lines" on ESPN Sunday at 7:30 a.m. (and 10:30 a.m.

<HD>Guerrero's Hiring Viewed as Fresh Start for UCLA</HD>
<DH>Analysis: Thinking a wake-up call was needed,
administrators picked an athletic director with no perceived
allegiances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The impetus for change was not prompted by crisis, instead merely by
a lifelong administrator's decision to retire.</LD>
<LD>   Encumbered by limitations that bubbled below the surface of the
job description, the three-month search for a replacement appeared as
unremarkable as it was methodical, ending where it began.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the way UCLA arrived on Dan Guerrero as its athletic director
reveals plenty about the department.</LD>
<TE>   Where it has been and where it is headed.</TE>
<TE>   Who is in charge and who is in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   The decision by Pete Dalis to step down after 19 years gave
Chancellor Albert Carnesale and Vice Chancellor Pete Blackman reason
to examine a department often characterized as a "sleeping giant."
And while soliciting opinions, reviewing resumes and conducting
interviews, the senior administrators came to realize the time was
right for a wake-up call.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody thought about revolutionary change,"
Carnesale said. "We wanted the best possible athletic director. It
was not as if we felt the need for an overhaul ... but it provided an
opportunity to move forward."</TE>
<TE>   A leading national search firm and a six-person, in-house
committee constructed a template of the ideal candidate. Dalis was
neither consulted nor kept informed, which many interpreted as a
signal there would be a departure from the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   Carnesale takes a different view, pointing out that in UCLA's
recent search for an executive vice chancellor, the opinion of the
person who formerly held the position was not sought.</TE>
<TE>   "As a general rule, when I'm selecting a successor, the person
currently in the position plays little to no role," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Neutrality was a central consideration in the choice of Guerrero,
a 50-year-old former Bruin baseball player and the athletic director
at UC Irvine. He brings everything the decision-makers desired, and,
just as important, little else.</TE>
<TE>   He is familiar with everyone--but beholden to no one.</TE>
<TE>   He has ties to UCLA--but few that should tug him toward a
particular faction within the department.</TE>
<TE>   He is expected to bring change--but in a deliberate manner because
he is respectful of the entrenched nature of the athletic hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   "The beauty of this situation is that it is a clean slate,"
Guerrero said. "My understanding of the staff is that it is top
notch. When I came to Irvine there were many individuals who had
never worked anywhere else. I found their experience and commitment
to the university a strength.</TE>
<TE>   "What I brought was some creativity and enthusiasm. I lit a fire."</TE>
<TE>   The less-is-more standard narrowly separated Guerrero from the
other finalists, Boise State Athletic Director Gene Bleymaier and
UCLA associate athletic director Betsy Stephenson.</TE>
<TE>   Before introducing Guerrero at a news conference, Carnesale spoke
about the characteristics he sought.</TE>
<TE>   "First and foremost, we focused on the qualities of the person,"
he said. "For example, a person of unquestionable integrity, both
real and perceived, both real and perceived."</TE>
<TE>   His emphasis was unmistakable, although his choice of the word
"integrity" might have been unfortunate because he said in an
interview this week that he did not intend to question the honor of
Bleymaier or Stephenson.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody would have gotten to the end game if all members of our
community did not believe they were people of integrity," Carnesale
said.</TE>
<TE>   Substitute "objectivity" for "integrity" and the comment is
telling. Among the finalists, Guerrero alone is not inextricably
linked to the UCLA old guard.</TE>
<TE>   Bleymaier, a former Bruin football player and administrator, is
close to Dalis and influential football boosters. His record of
transforming remote Boise State into a regional athletic power is
impressive, but his perceived allegiance to football cost him.</TE>
<TE>   The disappointment must have cut deep for Bleymaier, a childhood
friend and UCLA classmate of Guerrero who grew up in the South Bay.
His in-laws live in Los Angeles, and he and his wife spent a day
house hunting while in town for one of his three interviews.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife and I never reached a conclusion about what we would do
if given the opportunity," he said. "We know it would have been
difficult to move back to L.A. after living in Boise."</TE>
<TE>   Stephenson, 41, has been Dalis' top assistant for six years,
assuming greater responsibility as her boss neared retirement. Her
record of maintaining the unparalleled success of Bruin nonrevenue
and Olympic sports is strong, but her perceived insider status cost
her.</TE>
<TE>   Often an inside candidate who is passed over feels compelled to
depart. However, Stephenson e-mailed Guerrero this week to offer
assistance in his transition and has emerged with her humor intact.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying hard not to become the girl on the rebound," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Stephenson and Bleymaier both said the selection process was fair
and thorough. It also was elliptical--the same three names mentioned
the day Dalis announced he would retire eventually became the
finalists despite a nationwide search that identified more than 40
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The outside firm Heidrick &amp; Struggles cut the list to about 20 and
the in-house committee chaired by Blackman whittled it to
seven--athletic directors Rick Bay of San Diego State, Gary
Cunningham of UC Santa Barbara and Gary Walters of Princeton, UCLA
associate athletic director Rick Purdy and the three eventual
finalists.</TE>
<TE>   Carnesale met with each and beginning in April those told they
would not get the job withdrew.</TE>
<TE>   Bay, who had been athletic director at Minnesota, Ohio State and
Oregon as well as chief operating officer of the New York Yankees and
Cleveland Indians, was eliminated first.</TE>
<TE>   Next to go was Cunningham, a UCLA basketball player in the early
1960s and the Bruin coach from 1977-79. He had the support of John
Wooden and others aligned with basketball, but as with Bleymaier, the
lobbying of one segment of the athletic department worked against
him.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Cunningham and Blackman did not get along well as Bruin
teammates and their relationship reportedly never warmed.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the committee's few missteps, Purdy, a 1968 UCLA
graduate and associate athletic director in charge of fund-raising,
learned he was no longer in the running through a newspaper story.
Guerrero can expect support from Purdy, a loyal employee less than 10
years from retirement.</TE>
<TE>   The withdrawal of Walters was surprising. He was considered the
most viable candidate with no UCLA ties, and several coaches and
longtime department employees nervously anticipated him getting the
job and making wholesale changes.</TE>
<TE>   There is speculation that the compensation of $235,000--low by
Pacific 10 Conference standards--was insufficient to lure Walters
from Princeton. Although Walters did not comment on his reason for
withdrawing, another candidate said, "It had a lot to do with money;
$235,000 in L.A. is not $235,000 in Collegetown, USA. Anyone from
outside the area had to think twice about relocating."</TE>
<TE>   Carnesale, however, disputes the notion.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody withdrew for that reason," he said. "We told [Heidrick &amp;
Struggles] from the outset to let us have the very best candidates
and not to take into account the finances of this.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, there were candidates who said they weren't interested in
moving out here, and I don't know how finances fit into that. But I
can tell you honestly that nobody [withdrew] because of the
compensation level."</TE>
<TE>   It certainly wasn't a consideration to Guerrero, whose salary will
double.</TE>
<TE>   Besides tying up loose ends at Irvine, he will spend the next two
months continuing to familiarize himself with UCLA, planning ways to
rouse the sleeping giant without provoking its ire.</TE>
<TE>   "Between the summers of 2002 and 2003, it will be real interesting
to see who is here and what's changed," one longtime mid-level Bruin
administrator said. "Face it. People come and go when change occurs
at the top."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero is aware that security and comfort have nudged aside
creativity and passion in some corners of the Morgan Center, in the
offices of certain coaches as well as those of paper-shufflers.</TE>
<TE>   That and other constraining factors--from the relatively low pay
to the dearth of money and land for new or improved facilities--made
this a more difficult position to fill than Carnesale expected.
Because the search did not attract high-powered candidates and
eventually came full circle to one of the first names that came to
mind, some consider it a failure.</TE>
<TE>   Only one person can ensure that Guerrero is a good hire--Guerrero.
Integrity and objectivity he has in bundles. With those qualities as
a cornerstone, can he flourish at the helm of a program expected to
produce championship teams quickly and consistently?</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest expectations should be from the athletic director,"
he said. "There are certain absolutes. We are going to be about
winning and winning without compromising integrity. We will win in a
way that will make everyone who supports this program proud."</TE>

<HD>Waves Will Play for Title</HD>

<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pepperdine Coach Marv Dunphy said watching Ball State take the
opening game of the NCAA men's volleyball semifinals stirred up
something in his team.</LD>
<LD>   The Waves responded by dominating the next two games and rallying
in the fourth to win, 30-32, 30-19, 30-20, 33-31 Thursday night at
Penn State's Recreation Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Pepperdine (29-4) won its 17th consecutive match and will play
Hawaii for the national title Saturday. It's the ninth time the Waves
have reached the title match.</LD>
<TE>   Hawaii advanced with a 30-26, 27-30, 35-33, 30-27 victory over
Penn State.</TE>
<TE>   Ball State (23-8), the champion of the Midwest Intercollegiate
Volleyball Assn., was a worthy opponent early on. The Cardinals
rallied from a five-point deficit, ending the first game with
consecutive kills by Jary Delgado to snap a 30-30 tie.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we needed a wake-up call as much as Ball State
played really well," Dunphy said. "We knew their middle blockers were
pretty good and they were going to them a lot. They were big and they
were athletic."</TE>
<TE>   Brad Keenan and Sean Rooney had 19 kills each to lead the Waves.
Rooney, a freshman, had five kills in the second game and Keenan, a
junior, tied the match at one game each with three consecutive kills
to finish the game.</TE>
<TE>   Keenan was named national player of the year Wednesday by the
American Volleyball Coaches Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "We ran what we call a backslide play and he was doing a fine job
on that play," Dunphy said of his 6-foot-8 middle blocker. "I thought
Rooney did a nice job."</TE>
<TE>   The Waves took control of the match midway through the third game
after some Ball State errors. Consecutive errors by Tom Tegethoff and
a bad set by Jary Delgado gave Pepperdine a 15-9 lead. The Waves went
on to score four of the next five points as Keenan had two kills and
a block during that stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Beau Daniels finished off the decisive third game with a service
ace. The senior setter had 55 assists, directing an offense that hit
.348 (65 kills, 18 hitting errors) for the match.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine then fought back from three game points in the fourth.
Matthew Denmark gave Ball State a 31-30 lead with a kill but he
followed with a service error on game point.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Zuidema gave the Waves an opening with a hitting error. They
took advantage as Chris Van Reusen and Fred Winters teamed to block
Kyle Weindel, ending the match.</TE>
<TE>   Lance Walker had 15 kills for Pepperdine.</TE>

arms in the air, after completing a 17-hour flight from New York to
Paris.</LD>
<LD>   His grandfather, aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh, made the
groundbreaking solo, nonstop flight across the Atlantic in 1927,
crossing the ocean in 33 1/2 hours, nibbling on just one sandwich.</LD>
<TE>   "I really wanted to celebrate the 75th anniversary of
grandfather's flight," Erik Lindbergh said at a news conference. "I

<LD>   The Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong confirmed in a statement that
three priests who worked in Hong Kong were accused of abusing
children and that two of them were suspended from public ministry.
One of them later left the priesthood. The statement did not say when
the alleged abuses took place.</LD>
<TE>   The third priest was accused of sexual abuse in another country,
years before he came to Hong Kong, and was sent home and barred from

<HD>A Poorer Cousin Is Catching Up With Hong Kong</HD>
<DH>China: Booming Shanghai is on track to eclipse the
ex-colony as a financial powerhouse in East Asia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>These are unsettling times for Hong Kong, whose success has been
closely tied for nearly a quarter of a century to its role as the
undisputed gateway to the vast markets of mainland China.</LD>
<LD>   China's entry into the World Trade Organization, a move that has
brought new competition from mainland ports, is just one problem.</LD>
<LD>   Hong Kong's recently reinstalled political leader, Tung Chee-hwa,
is widely perceived as weak and ineffectual, the independence of the
Chinese territory's judicial system is in question, and its economy
is struggling.</LD>
<TE>   Then there's Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   As Hong Kong struggles to find its balance and redefine its place
in a fast-changing world, its longtime civic competitor 750 miles to
the north has steadily grown in importance as a business and
high-tech manufacturing center.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, Shanghai has a long way to go. Hong Kong authorities
claim that even at its current high growth rate, Shanghai would need
15 years to equal the size of Hong Kong's economy and more than that
to match its levels of per-capita income.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many are convinced that it's just a matter of time before
Shanghai eclipses Hong Kong as a financial center and eventually
emerges as East Asia's premier city--its Big Apple.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend, Shanghai's government hopes to accelerate this
process when it opens a job fair here with one central purpose:
raiding Hong Kong's much-prized pool of cosmopolitan,
English-speaking managerial talent. Such people are in short supply
nearly everywhere in mainland China after decades of Communist rule,
and they are vital to the country's transition to a more open
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Fair organizers predict that many here will make the jump.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of interest," said Joyce Lam, associate director of
BM Intelligence International, the Hong Kong-based company organizing
the fair. "We're optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "Professional people in Hong Kong see what's happening on the
mainland, and they want to go to Shanghai or Pudong," the high-tech
manufacturing district east of the city center, Lam said. "There are
more opportunities there."</TE>
<TE>   Lam said about 100 Shanghai-based companies, ranging from banks
and law firms to electronic-component manufacturers, plan to offer
about 700 jobs at the fair.</TE>
<TE>   She said salaries for the posts, ranging from $19,000 to $250,000
annually, had generated Web site queries and phone calls from
overseas Chinese as well, many of them in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, we welcome them to come to the fair too," she said.</TE>
<TE>   For Hong Kongers, whose feelings toward Shanghai are somewhat akin
to the rivalry between Angelenos and San Franciscans, the job fair is
both a galling bit of chutzpah and extremely worrisome.</TE>
<TE>   The workers Shanghai hopes to attract are exactly what Hong Kong
needs to hold on to in order to breathe new life into its economic
base.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong's competitiveness has noticeably deteriorated since
1997, when the territory reverted from British to Chinese rule.
Almost immediately after that transfer, authorities in the
Cantonese-speaking region replaced English with the mainland's
dominant Mandarin as the first foreign language.</TE>
<TE>   "Hong Kong's integration with China poses more problems than
solutions because China is competing for the same manpower and
skills," said Hong Kong University political scientist Sonny Lo, who
has tracked the region's transition to Chinese sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   Lo listed poor management of Hong Kong's human resources as a
major government weakness and said he sees no hope for short-term
improvement.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, Hong Kong is sandwiched between [mainland] China and
its own human resources problem," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A survey assessing Hong Kong's future business environment
published last week by the Economist Intelligence Unit appeared to
confirm Lo's gloomy assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "The quality of the work force ... remains a major worry," the
study concluded.</TE>
<TE>   The document also carried other bad news for Hong Kong--news that
will only add to its image as a region struggling to find a new
niche.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Cavey, the EIU's senior economist for greater China, noted
that among the nations or regions surveyed, Hong Kong was one of only
three where the business environment is expected to decline over the
next five years. The other two were Argentina and Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   Cavey also cited evidence of decline in Hong Kong's role as a
trade gateway to mainland China. Cavey noted that although China's
overall exports rose by about 8% during the first three months this
year, reexports from Hong Kong actually fell.</TE>

<HD>Bush Vows to Fix Trade Spat</HD>
<DH>Policy: President tells Europeans he will prod Congress to
resolve a $4-billion tax dispute. But new U.S. tariffs may only add
to differences.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush promised European leaders Thursday that
he would prod Congress to resolve a $4-billion tax dispute, and both
sides agreed to work together to settle differences over U.S. steel
tariffs.</LD>
<LD>   Yet even as Bush tried to defuse those trade flaps, America's
relations with its allies were further roiled by a final decision to
slap punitive tariffs on Canadian lumber and by House approval of
huge farm subsidies.</LD>
<LD>   Following a two-hour summit with European leaders, Bush said both
sides had agreed to address trade issues with the same cooperative
spirit they have brought to the war on terrorism, and he cited his
pledge to resolve the tax dispute as an initial step.</LD>
<TE>   "I hope and expect that we can all act in the same spirit of
understanding as we work through other problems," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But trade analysts said the combined effect of U.S. actions to
protect politically powerful steel, lumber and agricultural interests
was likely to have the opposite effect.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush claims to be a free trader, but he takes actions that are
protectionist," said Sidney Weintraub, director of the Americas
Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a
Washington public policy center. "It's gone too far now. And it's not
just the administration. The Democrats are complicit in agriculture.
The Democrats are complicit in steel."</TE>
<TE>   Bush did not discuss lumber or agriculture at his news conference
with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and European Commission
President Romano Prodi. But he promised that the U.S. would take
whatever steps are necessary to resolve the tax dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The European Union has asked the World Trade Organization for
permission to impose trade sanctions on up to $4 billion in U.S.
exports because the U.S. has not rescinded a tax subsidy for
corporations with overseas operations.</TE>
<TE>   The WTO has ruled repeatedly that the corporate tax break violates
global trading rules, and it is expected to decide soon on the amount
of compensation Europe is entitled to receive.</TE>
<TE>   The provision lets multinational corporations such as Boeing Co.
and Motorola Inc. reduce their tax bill by excluding profits from
exports. Any reform will require an act of Congress, but lawmakers
have been reluctant to take back the tax break.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he informed Aznar and Prodi that he would work with
Congress to ensure compliance with the WTO decision.</TE>
<TE>   "This will require both time and legislation," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The president referred to the steel spat only obliquely, but Prodi
indicated that Europeans would refrain from imposing retaliatory
tariffs until the WTO decides whether the U.S. tariffs are justified.</TE>
<TE>   Bush imposed temporary tariffs of 8% to 30% on imported steel
under a WTO rule that allows countries to protect domestic industries
that are injured by a surge of imports. The steel tariffs have been
challenged by several countries, and the WTO is expected to issue a
ruling on those challenges next year. But pressure has been building
in some European capitals to impose retaliatory tariffs this year,
and a preliminary target list took aim at more than $300 million in
annual U.S. exports.</TE>
<TE>   The United States maintains that a preemptive retaliation would be
a violation of WTO rules, and Prodi indicated that the Europeans
might be willing to hold off.</TE>
<TE>   "We both intend to play it by the WTO rules," he said. "Even in
this sphere, we shall demonstrate a friendly way of working."</TE>
<TE>   On lumber, the U.S. International Trade Commission gave final
approval to a Commerce Department proposal to levy 27% tariffs on
Canadian 2-by-4s and other softwood products to compensate for
alleged illegal "dumping" and government subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, including the Canadian government and U.S.
homebuilders, say the move could add as much as $1,500 to the cost of
a typical new home. Supporters insist that the price hike would be
much smaller and say the tariffs would help keep struggling U.S.
sawmills in business.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, House approval of the farm bill, which would boost
subsidies by more than $30 billion over six years, was denounced by
foreign governments and others. Opponents argue that the subsidies
would lead to massive overproduction, causing world commodity prices
to fall and unsubsidized producers to go under.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, however, called the bill a "generous and reliable" safety
net for farmers and said he was prepared to sign it. The measure now
goes to the Senate for a final vote.</TE>
<TE>   Several analysts praised the president for promising to resolve
the tax subsidy dispute, which dates to 1997. But they expressed
concern that negative fallout from the steel, lumber and farm actions
would undermine the administration's ability to negotiate regional
free-trade agreements and advance U.S. interests in global trade
talks launched last year in Doha, Qatar.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of one step forward, and two or three steps back," said
Robert E. Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings
Institution, a centrist think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "The trade agenda is in real trouble, that's the bottom line,"
Litan said. "A lot of the momentum that had been building up in the
wake of the Doha meeting has been lost."</TE>
<TE>   But University of Maryland economist Peter Morici, a former U.S.
trade official, said he thinks that Bush deserves more credit.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the lumber tariffs were prompted by an industry
lawsuit that was largely out of Bush's hands, the farm bill is the
handiwork of Congress, and the steel spat can probably be settled by
granting exemptions to key exporters. Meanwhile, he said, the
president's other trade priorities remain in place.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a hard-headed realist," Morici said. "He wants to pursue a
free-trade policy, but there are areas where he has to compromise."</TE>

<HD>Arafat Tours Ruins; Church Siege Goes On</HD>
<DH>West Bank: The Palestinian leader also focuses on Bethlehem
standoff. Activists there slip by troops and supply those inside with
food.</DH>

<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>No longer under Israeli siege, Yasser Arafat toured the wreckage of
this city Thursday, praying over a mass grave and pretending to patch
a cracked wall to symbolize the massive reconstruction effort that
lies ahead.</LD>
<LD>   The Palestinian Authority president's first day of freedom was a
series of photo ops at schools and office buildings destroyed by the
recently departed Israeli army. But any euphoria among the smallish
crowds was tempered by the harsh realities Arafat faces--and by the
festering standoff at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.</LD>
<LD>   Israel lifted its monthlong siege of Arafat's headquarters here in
the middle of the night Wednesday, pulling the last of its tanks and
troops away from Arafat's headquarters and redeploying them on the
outskirts of Ramallah. The government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
had said it was imposing the siege to force Arafat to rein in
terrorists.</LD>
<TE>   At midmorning, a pale Arafat flashed a "V" for victory and emerged
defiantly from the compound, most of which lies in ruins, then
speeded away in a convoy of security vehicles as crowds who had
gathered to see him cheered in support.</TE>
<TE>   First stop was a grave in the parking lot of Ramallah Hospital,
where 17 people killed during the Israeli invasion lay buried. They
died during the siege, and when their families could not reach a real
cemetery, they were laid to rest en masse instead.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat said brief Muslim prayers over the grave.</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem on Thursday, Israeli troops shot dead one man and
injured two others at the entrance to the Church of the Nativity as
talks stalled over the fate of gunmen holed up inside. An army
spokeswoman said the men were shot because they were spotted carrying
guns.</TE>
<TE>   Peace Activists</TE>
<TE>   Carry In Food</TE>
<TE>   Several hours after the shooting, peace activists with the
International Solidarity Movement, and a Los Angeles Times
photographer, eluded troops besieging the church and dashed, with
their hands up, to its wooden door. As one activist unfurled a banner
saying "Free Palestine," the door swung open. Ten members of the
group carried in backpacks stuffed with rice, lentils, chocolate,
sugar and other food.</TE>
<TE>   The activists' presence promised to further complicate an already
fraught impasse in which the Israeli army has encircled one of
Christianity's most revered sites and confined thousands in the
biblical town to their homes for a month.</TE>
<TE>   Among the activists are Nauman Zaidi, 26, from Rancho Cucamonga,
and Robert O'Neill, 21, from Claremont. Zaidi, a student at UC
Riverside, and O'Neill, a student at UC Berkeley, are studying this
year at American University in Cairo, Zaidi said in a telephone
interview from the church. The two are spending their spring break
working as volunteers for the International Solidarity Movement, he
said. The group's Web site, www.palsolidarity.org, says it aims to
raise awareness of the Palestinian struggle for freedom and for an
end to Israeli occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn Cole, the Times photographer, said the Palestinians
barricaded inside the church warmly received the activists and
immediately began cooking a large pot of rice from among the stores
the newcomers brought.</TE>
<TE>   She said the men inside were broken up into small groups around
the 4th century basilica, where they are sleeping on blankets spread
on the stone floor. Cole said windows inside the church had been shot
out but that no serious damage was visible.</TE>
<TE>   The cavernous structure was illuminated by candles, she said, and
the men inside said they had been eating leaves from a lemon tree in
the courtyard as their rations ran out.</TE>
<TE>   "You are welcome," a pharmacist who identified himself only as
Aziz told the activists. "But you are free to go if you want."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat seemed obsessed with Bethlehem in the first hours after his
own siege was lifted. He lashed out at Israel, which he blamed for
two fires that erupted during a Wednesday night gun battle at the
church.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians said the fires were ignited by Israeli flares
shot into the compound during the fighting. The Israelis initially
accused the Palestinians of setting the blazes, but Col. Miri Eisen,
an Israeli military intelligence officer, said Thursday that the army
was checking the possibility that its flares had indeed started the
fires.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat also commented Thursday on the Jenin refugee camp, site of
fierce fighting that claimed the lives of at least 50 Palestinian
gunmen and civilians and 23 Israeli soldiers. Israel has refused to
allow an independent inquiry by the United Nations, which it regards
as biased. Arafat said it was disgraceful that the U.N. team won't be
allowed into Jenin.</TE>
<TE>   'We Will Really Have</TE>
<TE>   to Rebuild From Zero'</TE>
<TE>   In his inspection of Ramallah, Arafat paid quick visits to the
Education Ministry, the sprawling Preventive Security Service complex
and other Palestinian Authority buildings that Israeli forces
destroyed or damaged in what Palestinians charge was a clear attempt
to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   "We will really have to rebuild from zero," said Salah Zuheikeh, a
senior official in Arafat's Fatah movement.</TE>
<TE>   He stood amid the rubble of Arafat's headquarters, where repeated
Israeli bombardment, tank fire and bulldozing had smashed nearly
every structure. Inside a garage, Israeli soldiers had methodically
attacked each of Arafat's six Mercedes-Benzes and three Jeep
Cherokees.</TE>
<TE>   At the Ramallah Hospital and its adjacent Sheik Zayed Hospital,
Arafat greeted members of his bodyguard unit who were wounded in
fighting. Dr. Samir Saliba said the 72-year-old Palestinian leader
looked tired and pale, having lost weight, but that his overall
health seemed good.</TE>
<TE>   The virtual destruction of the Palestinian Authority and Arafat's
desire to rebuild have helped fuel new demands for major reform in a
regime widely viewed as corrupt and inefficient.</TE>
<TE>   "No one can know what Abu Ammar is thinking," Saliba said, using
Arafat's nom de guerre, "but everyone on the street is demanding new
faces and new blood."</TE>
<TE>   From the opposite end of the political spectrum, however, Arafat
is coming under enormous criticism for the deal he struck to secure
his freedom.</TE>
<TE>   He agreed to allow six men who had been hiding with him in his
compound to be transported to a Palestinian prison in the West Bank
town of Jericho, where they are being monitored by U.S. and British
wardens. The six include four people convicted in the fatal shooting
of Rehavam Zeevi, an extreme right-wing minister in Sharon's Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   At a town hall meeting Thursday of the radical Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, whose members ordered and executed the
Zeevi assassination, posters saluted the killers as heroes and
demanded their release from the clutches of "CIA collaborators, their
agents and ideologues."</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, the foreign activists said they intend to stay
inside the church until the siege is lifted and all the Palestinians
and others inside--more than 100 people--are allowed to go free.</TE>
<TE>   Bethlehem Mayor Hanna Nasser said Thursday night that the army has
told Palestinian negotiators that seven wanted militants are inside
the church.</TE>
<TE>   Nasser said the Palestinian negotiators want those men transferred
to Jericho, where he said they will stand trial if the Palestinian
Authority decides they have committed crimes. If convicted, the men
could be held in a Palestinian jail under British and U.S.
supervision, like the other group of men sent to Jericho.</TE>
<TE>   Nasser said a third party should step in to handle the
negotiations, and he has invited Vatican envoy French Cardinal Roger
Etchegaray to visit Bethlehem. Etchegaray met Thursday with Israeli
President Moshe Katsav and with Arafat in an effort to break the
deadlock over the church.</TE>
<TE>   In another development Thursday, the Israeli prime minister's
office said that Marwan Barghouti, the top Fatah commander in the
West Bank, who was captured by Israeli forces last month, has told
his interrogators that Arafat personally approved attacks on
Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Barghouti is the highest-ranking Palestinian leader to be taken
into custody during Israel's recent sweep through the West Bank.
Since his April 15 capture, he has complained that he has been
permitted only short periods of sleep and has been questioned round
the clock for days at a time.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the prime minister's office said Barghouti told
Israel's Shin Bet secret service that when a militiaman wanted to
carry out an attack, he had to fill out a detailed request and hand
it in to Barghouti, who would sign it and pass it along to Arafat for
final approval, the statement said. Also, Arafat had to approve every
outlay of funds, whatever the amount.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has been trying to mount a case against Arafat that will
link him definitively to terrorist acts and discredit him in the
world's eyes.</TE>

<HD>Many Palestinians Angered by Jailings in Jericho</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Supporters say the six men traded in Yasser
Arafat's release should not be held under U.S. and British watch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERICHO, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Palestinians have a derisive new name for the prison that sits just
off the dusty main road in this ancient desert town. They call it
"Guantanamo Jericho," a reference to the military base in Cuba where
the U.S. is imprisoning suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters.</LD>
<LD>   There is widespread anger among Palestinians about the terms of a
U.S.-brokered agreement in which Israel on Wednesday released
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat after a monthlong siege
of his headquarters. In exchange, the Palestinians transferred six
men wanted by Israel to the military facility here, where they are
jailed by Palestinians but monitored by a team of Americans and
Britons.</LD>
<LD>   Shopkeeper Jamila Hamed Saleh said the Palestinian leader should
have stayed in his shattered offices rather than cut such a deal. "I
think he has put his personal interest before the people's interest,"
said Saleh, 58, in the tiny grocery store she owns in the shadow of
the biblical Mount of Temptation.</LD>
<TE>   She and others interviewed Thursday, the day after the men arrived
at the prison, said the unusual monitoring arrangements were an
affront to Palestinian sovereignty. And Palestinian Cabinet minister
Saeb Erekat said he anticipates protests outside his office here.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, in the West Bank city of Ramallah, a radical
Palestinian faction held a town hall meeting to criticize the deal.
Members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine erected
a model jail cell with a picture of their leader, one of those in
custody, and draped it with paper replicas of American and British
flags. A sign read: "Out with CIA collaborators, their agents and
ideologues."</TE>
<TE>   Another PFLP leader declared the deal cut for the prisoners a
"black chapter" in the history of the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   But inside Jericho's gated, British mandate-era military
headquarters, the team of American and British monitors was settling
in Thursday, working its first shifts and waiting for more members to
arrive, according to Palestinian and Western officials.</TE>
<TE>   Watchful guards outside the compound's tall, white metal gates
shooed away anyone who lingered for more than a moment, saying entry
was forbidden.</TE>
<TE>   The team is made up of people with experience in prisons or
international monitoring efforts, including several former British
army officers, the officials said. They will not be armed. Ten
members, mostly from Britain, have arrived, with others expected by
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are doing is verifying that the Palestinians are holding
them," a Western official said. "We're watching to make sure that
they comply with their own laws and regulations, then reporting back
to the two sides."</TE>
<TE>   Israel has long accused the Palestinians of quickly releasing most
suspects they arrest. The official said the Palestinians, rather than
being angry about the deal, should look on the presence of the
monitors as an opportunity to demonstrate their compliance.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Israel Radio on Thursday, the British
ambassador to Israel, Sherard Cowper-Coles, said the idea for the
monitoring grew out of a conversation between British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in November, in
which Blair made a general offer of British help in fighting
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The ambassador said the group's preliminary guidelines were being
drawn up by Andrew Coyle, the former warden of a high-security
facility holding many IRA prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   The six men transferred Wednesday are the only prisoners being
held in the Jericho facility. Damaged in a brief Israeli incursion
last fall, it had not housed any prisoners for some time.</TE>
<TE>   Erekat said once he heard that the facility, built in 1932, might
be used, he made hurried arrangements for it to be repaired and
painted, for furniture to be moved in and air-conditioning installed.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Lotfi, 22, said he was among those who helped, even
though he believes the prisoners should not have been arrested. The
men, he said in an interview near Jericho's vegetable market, "were
defending the honor of the Palestinian people."</TE>
<TE>   Of the six prisoners, four were accused in the shooting death of
Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi last fall, and were convicted
by the Palestinians in a cursory trial recently inside Arafat's
Ramallah headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The others, PFLP leader Ahmed Saadat and Arafat's financial
officer, Fuad Shubaki, have yet to stand trial, and Erekat said the
Palestinian attorney general must decide soon whether to charge them
or let them go.</TE>
<TE>   The monitors will find themselves in a sleepy desert oasis that
had held promise for the Palestinians as a tourist attraction.</TE>
<TE>   Sleek new cable cars ferried tourists, including many Israelis, up
to the Mount of Temptation, and a $50-million casino on the edge of
town attracted gamblers by the score. But the beginning of the
Palestinian intifada in September 2000 frightened the tourists away,
and both the cable car and the casino are now shuttered. A gleaming,
181-room Intercontinental Hotel beside the casino averages a single
guest a month, a desk clerk said.</TE>
<TE>   So if the American and British monitors ever enter her grocery
store, Saleh said, she will welcome them despite her concerns about
their role in Jericho. "If they stop here, like anyone else, they are
welcome," she said.</TE>

<HD>Massacre at Jenin Doubted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JENIN, West Bank</DL>
<LD>No matter how few bodies have been found, people in Jenin remain
convinced that Israeli soldiers committed a massacre here. But there
is a growing consensus among human rights groups, international aid
workers and even some Palestinians that no massacre took place.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinians have maintained since Israel's attack on Jenin and
the West Bank town's refugee camp last month that between 300 and 500
Palestinians were killed.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody saw what happened," said Abdul Karim Saadi, 26, who
said he was wounded by Israeli gunfire while sleeping in his bed. He
lifted his shirt to show a long raw scar on his stomach and a bandage
on his shoulder.</LD>
<TE>   However, Israeli government officials have said that 54
Palestinians died, all but seven of them members of militant groups
that had turned the camp into a terrorist haven. Twenty-three Israeli
soldiers also were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Human Rights Watch today became the latest group to weigh in. It
released a report that found no evidence of a massacre, although it
uncovered "very serious violations of the laws of war," according to
senior researcher Peter Bouckaert.</TE>
<TE>   Through interviews, the human rights group documented 52 deaths in
the camp, of which 22 were civilians. Of those, researchers said, 10
appear to be war crimes. The rest are in need of further
investigation but could be attributable to human error or be less
serious human rights violations, it said.</TE>
<TE>   Human Rights Watch also raised concerns about disproportionate use
of force, the use of civilians as human shields, and the Israeli
military's denial of access to medical and aid groups during and
after the attack.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli military denied those allegations. It said
Palestinians, not the Israeli army, had used human shields. And it
said it prevented ambulance access only when the situation was too
dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   The army also said the low number of casualties known so far was
evidence of Israel's caution during the operation.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army "anti-terror operation was planned and conducted
strictly against terrorists, not civilians," read a statement
released by the military late Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The Times and other media also have conducted investigations that
failed to turn up evidence of mass executions, though the reports
raised questions about individual incidents that could be human
rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty International, another rights group, has already dismissed
the massacre allegations, though its inquiry also found examples of
human rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   Worries About Diverted Attention</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some researchers have begun to worry that the focus on
whether a massacre took place has diverted attention from allegations
that other serious abuses occurred during the operation.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is denying that there were militant groups operating in
the camp. But that does not excuse the Israeli army from protecting
the civilian population," Bouckaert said.</TE>
<TE>   Even some Palestinian officials interviewed Thursday acknowledged
that the 300 to 500 figure was probably not true.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed Kassan, the assistant director of the refugee camp, said 51
corpses had been found and estimated that perhaps 30 more remain
buried in the rubble. A Palestinian medical worker, who declined to
give his name, confirmed Kassan's estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Kassan said he was still waiting to get a final list from the
International Committee of the Red Cross of the people still missing.
But he said he doubted that the final figure would exceed 80 dead.</TE>
<TE>   He remained adamant, though, that the Israeli army bore a heavy
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at this camp," he said, pointing to the stacks of rubble
that were once homes to hundreds of refugee families. "Don't you
think that's a massacre?"</TE>
<TE>   This was the sort of question the United Nations was hoping to
help answer when it proposed opening an inquiry into the Jenin
attack, already famous among Palestinians as a symbol of resistance.</TE>
<TE>   But the Israeli government refused to cooperate with the team,
expressing fears that the report would be biased against the Jewish
state.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials pointed out that none of the three leaders of
the mission had experience in urban warfare. They also worried that
their soldiers might be tried for war crimes. Israel and the United
Nations were unable to reach a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Bouckaert said a U.N. report would have helped settle the debate,
at least in some circles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear there are very divergent views about what happened in
Jenin," Bouckaert said. "It would have been very important for the
U.N. team to get here and establish a credible, impartial picture."</TE>
<TE>   Small parts of that picture have filled in during the last few
weeks, as Israeli forces pulled out of most West Bank towns and aid
officials began the slow, hard work of assessing the damage.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N., which operates refugee programs in the camp, now
estimates that about 800 of the 2,450 dwellings were destroyed during
the Israeli operation and 300 more rendered unlivable.</TE>
<TE>   The World Bank believes that the total cost of damage to buildings
and infrastructure could reach as high as $100 million in the camp
and the sprawling city that surrounds it.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli tanks and bulldozers leveled more than 100 buildings
during the operation, turning the heart of the camp into a gray
moonscape of dust, reinforced steel bars and shattered homes.</TE>
<TE>   Tanks and armored personnel carriers destroyed streets, knocked
down lampposts and utility poles and ruined underground water and
sewage pipes, according to city officials.</TE>
<TE>   Blackouts and phone outages remain common. Pools of water and
sewage can be seen bubbling up throughout the camp.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the buildings in the camp had some damage," said Hisham
Labadi, a local official with the World Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no buildings that don't have at least some bullet
holes."</TE>

<HD>U.S., Allies Plan Peace Conference</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The gathering will seek to build on the easing of
Israeli- Palestinian tensions and advance efforts toward a final
settlement.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States said Thursday that it is planning an international
peace conference to accelerate a political settlement of the
half-century-old Mideast conflict.</LD>
<LD>   The conference, backed by the United States, the United Nations,
the European Union and Russia, could be held as early as next month,
according to U.S. officials. The conference supporters, dubbed "the
quartet," came together last month to co-sponsor the peace process.</LD>
<LD>   The conference will seek to build on the easing of tensions in the
West Bank, particularly the end of a monthlong siege at the Ramallah
headquarters of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat. The
international community then hopes to use its collective clout to
prod the Israelis and the Palestinians to address their differences
before the situation on the ground can deteriorate again.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a time for prompt action to take advantage of this new
window of opportunity that has been presented to us. And we intend to
do just that," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said at a news
conference with top officials representing the other sponsors of the
peace effort.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement came as President Bush declared that the newly
energized peace process was gaining momentum. "I'm optimistic we're
making good progress," he said at a news conference with EU
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said details of the peace conference, including venue,
participants and timing, were still to be worked out. But the
gathering is likely to be held at the level of foreign ministers.</TE>
<TE>   The initial goal will be to "pull together ideas and create
momentum and figure out a way to move forward," a senior State
Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   "We committed ourselves to the promotion of serious and
accelerated negotiations toward a settlement," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the secretary appealed to the Israelis, the
Palestinians and the rest of the Arab world to "rise to the
challenges ahead."</TE>
<TE>   But the co-sponsors have not yet determined whether the conference
will be the beginning of a longer process or, as many in the Arab
world prefer, a lengthy session to thrash out the terms of a final
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate comment from the Israelis or Palestinians.
It was the middle of the night in the Mideast when the announcement
was made.</TE>
<TE>   A well-placed U.S. official involved in the effort said the
organizers hope to "light a fire" under the peace process, which has
been stalled by 19 months of intermittent violence.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically you have the four parties commit to holding this
conference--come hell or high water and despite the preferences of
the parties. The world's major leaders have given notice that they're
serious and they won't take no for an answer," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The last international conference on the Mideast was held in
Madrid in 1991, after the Persian Gulf War altered the regional
balance of power. It paved the way for the past decade of progress,
including the 1993 Oslo accords between Israel and the Palestinians
and the 1994 peace treaty between Israel and Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Announcement of plans for a new conference came on the eve of
critical talks next week. Bush will host Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon on Tuesday and Jordan's King Abdullah II on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Talk of a conference has been in the background of recent U.S.
efforts. Sharon had suggested a summit between Israeli and Arab
leaders--but without Arafat, a proposal Arab nations immediately
rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Even this week, proposals to hold a regional or international
conference appeared to be vague ideas not formally endorsed by the
administration. Bush recently referred to such a conference as one of
several options. So the announcement came as a surprise at the news
conference that included Powell, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov, EU foreign policy chief
Javier Solana and Foreign Minister Josep Pique of Spain, which
currently has the rotating EU presidency.</TE>
<TE>   The conference is part of a three-pronged strategy to cover
security and economic issues as well as produce a final political
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "They all have to be integrated," Powell said. Such a move is not
likely to be welcomed by the Israeli government. Sharon has insisted
that full security guarantees must precede any talk of a political
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The emerging peace strategy will be based on principles outlined
in Bush's April 4 address on the Mideast, the peace offer initiated
by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and accepted unanimously by
the 22-member Arab League in March, and several U.N. resolutions,
Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   To help restore security, the U.S. and its allies will press
Arafat to exert "maximum effort" to restore calm and rebuild his
security forces. They also stressed the need to assess Palestinian
capabilities, establish responsible security institutions and find
ways for Palestinian and Israeli security forces to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said both CIA Director George J. Tenet, who has played a
role in establishing a framework for security contacts in the past,
and special U.S. envoy Anthony C. Zinni would be available to play
roles in this phase.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials suggested later that Tenet or Zinni--or both--might
be headed to the region after resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian
standoff at Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity.</TE>
<TE>   To address the economic issues, Powell said, the U.S. and its
partners would give urgent attention to reconstruction of "strong,
accountable, democratic and market-oriented" institutions for the
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "The people in the region are in great need" of jobs, food, access
to markets, medical supplies and other essentials, he said. "We are
united in our determination to bring that about."</TE>
<TE>   To help the process, Powell called on Israel to lift closures of
Palestinian areas and on the Palestinians to ensure no new violence
that would lead to another Israeli clampdown. He pledged that the
quartet would move quickly on both the political and economic tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the U.S. role in orchestrating the deal ending Israel's
siege of Arafat's headquarters, the administration had some tough
words for the Palestinian leader.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important for Chairman Arafat to show the world that
he's capable of leading," Bush said. "He's had some chance to grab
the peace and hasn't done so in the past, and therefore he has let
down the Palestinian people. He's now free to show leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also warned Arafat that a viable Palestinian state cannot be
based on "a foundation of terror or corruption."</TE>
<TE>   The United States and its Arab allies are pressing Arafat behind
the scenes to take specific steps over the next few days to arrest
extremists, close down bomb-making facilities and send out a tough,
well-publicized message condemning all violence against Israel,
administration officials said. These actions are considered critical
to prove Arafat's commitment to the peace process, which the
president needs to be able to urge Sharon to move forward.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said it was time for Arafat to move "in a new direction--to
denounce terrorism, denounce violence" and to proclaim that "this is
the time to find a peaceful way forward."</TE>
<TE>   The secretary, whose 10-nation swing through the region last month
gave impetus to the current effort, said he had "the most direct
conversations possible" with Arafat to explain what the Palestinian
leader needs to do. "He knows what is expected of him," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Powell had strong praise for Arab allies. The quartet
praised the "new attitude" demonstrated by the Arab League and the
Arab willingness to play a more effective and more aggressive role in
the peace process.</TE>
<TE>   "We look forward to working with them," Powell said. He said Saudi
Arabia's peace offer must play a "very, very important and helpful
role" as the process advances.</TE>
<TE>   On another issue certain to anger many Israelis, Powell warned
that the construction of settlements on occupied territory must be
stopped and that unspecified action would have to be taken concerning
those already in place.</TE>

<HD>Gunman's Family Apologizes</HD>
<DH>Germany: Parents and brother of shooter say they cannot
explain what led teen to commit his 'brutal, crazed act.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>The family of the German school gunman who killed 16 people and
himself apologized Thursday for the pain he caused, saying they were
at a loss to explain his pent-up "hate and desperation" that exploded
into a blood bath.</LD>
<LD>   In a signed letter published in local newspapers, Robert
Steinhaeuser's parents and older brother said they were filled with
grief and torment after he gunned down 13 teachers, two teenage
students and a policeman last Friday at a secondary school in the
eastern city of Erfurt that had expelled him in October.</LD>
<LD>   "Until this brutal, crazed act, we were an absolutely normal
family and we knew a different Robert," the family said.</LD>
<TE>   Steinhaeuser, 19, had joined a gun club and, a few weeks after he
was expelled from school, received a weapons permit that allowed him
to own a pistol and pump-action shotgun that he sneaked into the
school. Police say that even on the morning he set out to kill, his
parents still believed he was attending classes.</TE>
<TE>   "Since this terrible deed of last Friday, we are asking ourselves
again and again where Robert's hate and desperation came from and why
we never found out about it beforehand," the letter says.</TE>
<TE>   "We are infinitely sorry that our son and brother brought such
terrible suffering upon the victims and their relatives, the people
of Erfurt ... and all of Germany."</TE>
<TE>   Steinhaeuser's older brother, Peter, said the family knew Robert
had trouble in school and had joined a gun club but that they had no
clue he had bought weapons and had been expelled for faking a
doctor's note.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service for the victims was planned for today in
Erfurt's main square.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in western Germany on Thursday, police arrested a
teenager suspected of trying to gas teachers and pupils at his former
school.</TE>

<HD>New Allied Sweep Targets Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>In a renewed offensive to sweep Taliban and Al Qaeda holdouts from
their mountain lairs, British Royal Marines backed by U.S. Special
Forces and other troops scoured the caves and crevices of eastern
Afghanistan on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The British-led offensive by about 1,000 fighters, code-named
Operation Snipe, appears to be employing a pincer movement, with
troops closing in on a network of caves and hide-outs from both sides
of the rugged Afghan-Pakistani border.</LD>
<LD>   U.S.-led coalition forces have already made numerous attempts to
kill or capture Osama bin Laden's loyalists hiding in the hostile
eastern territory. But each time, some fighters have managed to
escape--and some of them are thought to be across the poorly guarded
border, which is delineated by soaring peaks and laced with
circuitous tunnels.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. and Pakistani authorities have confirmed a troop buildup on
the Pakistani side, where local tribes still strongly support
Afghanistan's deposed Taliban regime and its religious extremism.</TE>
<TE>   At Bagram air base, an hour's drive north of the Afghan capital,
Kabul, British Brig. Roger Lane declined to specify the area targeted
by Operation Snipe. Royal Marines spokesman Lt. Col. Paul Harradine
denied that it was the Khowst-Gardez area where coalition troops have
been seen in increasing numbers this week.</TE>
<TE>   Lane said the target of the offensive is "one of the few remaining
areas that has never before been investigated by coalition ground
forces, and we have good reason to believe that it is or has been a
key base for the Al Qaeda terrorist network."</TE>
<TE>   Harradine said U.S. Apache attack helicopters and A-10 Warthog
jets were on hand to provide air cover.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces on both sides of the border have come under repeated
attack in the last few days. As many as four rockets were fired
Thursday at the Khowst airport, where U.S. troops are based. It was
the second attack on the site in two weeks. U.S. positions in the
Waziristan region of Pakistan, just across the border, were hit with
rocket fire Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks have not resulted in casualties or serious damage, but
they do illustrate the hazards that coalition forces face as they
confront a determined enemy on its own turf.</TE>
<TE>   Coalition forces patrolling eastern Afghanistan have encountered
Taliban and Al Qaeda stragglers this week, killing four in two
exchanges of fire at close range Monday and Tuesday. On Thursday,
Australian forces killed another Al Qaeda suspect whom they
encountered on patrol, said a military spokesman in Canberra, the
Australian capital.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Operation Snipe force was deployed Monday, but none of
the troops assigned to the mission has yet come into contact with
enemy forces, Harradine said.</TE>
<TE>   The British spokesman said there was no credible intelligence that
Bin Laden was in the area, despite claims by some local fighters that
he is.</TE>
<TE>   British troops make up about half of the force, with about 100
U.S. Special Forces soldiers providing support along with Canadians,
Australians and several hundred Afghan allies.</TE>
<TE>   Lane declined to say how many Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters are
believed to be holed up in the area, where mountains tower as high as
13,000 feet. The success of the campaign "will not be measured solely
in a count of the number of dead terrorists," he said, but he did not
specify what other yardsticks would be used.</TE>
<TE>   British officers said earlier this week that any fighters they
capture will be remanded to Afghan custody under the Geneva
Conventions' rules for treatment of prisoners of war.</TE>
<TE>   Those captured by U.S. forces so far have been labeled "illegal
combatants" and are being denied the rights and conditions normally
granted to POWs--a sore point between Washington and some European
allies.</TE>
<TE>   The area targeted by Operation Snipe appears to be near where
Operation Anaconda took place two months ago. U.S. military officials
say that campaign, in the Shahi Kot valley southeast of Gardez,
killed hundreds of Al Qaeda or Taliban fighters. Eight Americans also
died in the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   In December, U.S.-led coalition forces pounded the Tora Bora
mountain region near Jalalabad for weeks in pursuit of Bin Laden and
his fighters. Many were reported killed, but the main targets of the
campaign apparently slipped over the border into Pakistan.</TE>

<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>Iran's hard-line Revolutionary Court has summoned a top opposition
leader who returned home from the U.S. two weeks ago despite a
warrant for his arrest on charges of subversion.</LD>
<LD>   Ibrahim Yazdi, 70, an aide to the late supreme leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini and a former government minister, had been
undergoing cancer therapy in the United States. He was ordered to
return home last year to face charges of acting against state
security.</LD>
<LD>   "The court has sent Yazdi a summons, or more accurately, an
invitation," Abbasali Alizadeh, the head of the Tehran judiciary,
told state radio Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   It was not immediately clear whether Yazdi, secretary-general of
the banned Freedom Movement, was to be charged or interrogated.</TE>
<TE>   "We received a summons; it was very polite. He should attend court
within three working days, but there was no mention of charges," a
relative of Yazdi said. "He will go to court Saturday."</TE>

<DH>Desperate times for chiropractors drive some to set up shop
with prostitution rings, officials say. Operators say they were
tricked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Dr. Jim" pitched himself as the ultimate New Age healer, a
chiropractor who also practiced electro-acupuncture and hypnosis and
dispensed botanical elixirs.</LD>
<LD>   James F. Aquila promised to remedy life's stresses and addictions
with a blend of spinal adjustments, counseling and
"psychobiochemical" therapy. Relief, he wrote, was just a matter of
"utilizing the mind/body connection" and "channeling spiritual flow."</LD>
<LD>   Authorities have a simpler term for what went on at Dr. Jim's
Midnight Therapy in Anaheim: prostitution.</LD>
<TE>   The "therapy," prosecutors say, consisted mainly of young women in
metallic miniskirts performing sexual acts for cash. Aquila is to
stand trial later this year on charges that he operated a house of
prostitution, using the chiropractic clinic as a cover.</TE>
<TE>   Driven by police from their longtime haunts on street corners and
massage parlors, prostitution rings are setting up shop in suburban
strip malls, medical plazas and business parks--often using
chiropractic offices as a cover.</TE>
<TE>   Web sites provide clients with rankings and directions to these
clandestine establishments. The operators try to frustrate law
enforcement by constantly changing the roster of prostitutes and by
training the women to spot undercover cops.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, police in Anaheim have raided five
chiropractic clinics alleged to be fronts for prostitution. Los
Angeles police have raided 18 chiropractic establishments since
October, mostly in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The state chiropractic board, meanwhile, has stripped 11
practitioners of their licenses for involvement in prostitution over
the last two years. The board is investigating similar allegations
against 20 other chiropractors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a problem that's only escalating," said Catherine Hayes,
enforcement program manager for the board. "We get calls about this
every day from law enforcement. It's giving the profession a black
eye."</TE>
<TE>   Why is this happening? Authorities say a financial squeeze on
chiropractors has left some of them desperate enough to share their
premises with prostitution rings, whose leaders are always looking
for respectable fronts to hide behind. The rings are believed to have
ties to Asian organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   Times are tough for California's 12,500 active chiropractors. HMOs
have slashed their reimbursements and reduced the number of
chiropractors included in their health plans. Yet the ranks of
practitioners keep growing, up 30% in California over the last
decade. Many struggle to cover rents and pay off school loans that
often exceed $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a reflection of absolute desperation," said Robert Dubin, a
chiropractor in Petaluma and president of the California Chiropractic
Assn. "Why else would anyone risk their license after investing all
that money and time just to make some quick cash on hookers?
Employment opportunities for chiropractors are getting few and far
between."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Jim" Aquila says it was financial desperation that landed him
in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Aquila, 65, who grew up in the Chicago area and studied
psychological counseling at UCLA, has been a licensed chiropractor
for more than 30 years. He's described on several holistic health Web
sites as a "life coach" who counsels people in how to handle stress.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, he had trouble drawing patients to his Placentia
practice. He filed for bankruptcy in 1995, listing more than $200,000
in debts. The state filed four tax liens against him totaling
$70,000.</TE>
<TE>   His financial woes worsened when he and his wife separated several
years ago, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The bills were mounting," Aquila said in an interview. "There was
just this unbelievable set of circumstances that have hit me."</TE>
<TE>   By last year, Aquila was reduced to treating neighbors and friends
in the garage of his Diamond Bar home. Thumbing through the local
paper one day, he saw an ad he thought could turn his career around.
The ad sought a seasoned chiropractor to run a new office in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "It was for $40 an hour, which looked good to me," said Aquila "I
didn't think too much about it. They assured me everything was on the
up and up."</TE>
<TE>   He declined to identify the people he says hired him, and police
refused to say if they were investigating others in connection with
the establishment.</TE>
<TE>   The job didn't require Aquila to do much. He sat in the clinic,
performing little if any therapy. The office employed several female
masseuses, whom he was supposed to supervise.</TE>
<TE>   Aquila said he had no idea the women--with nicknames like "Rosie"
and "Kinky"--were prostitutes until police raided Midnight Therapy
last June, arresting Aquila and three "therapists."</TE>
<TE>   "I've been chosen as the scapegoat," said Aquila, who has pleaded
not guilty to a misdemeanor charge of operating a house of
prostitution. "I needed money at the time. I had no intention of
doing what the police say I did. My God, I had 30 years of practice!
To end it this way is just very humbling."</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim police maintain that Aquila was a willing participant in
the prostitution operation.</TE>
<TE>   Midnight Therapy's storefront was in a bland stucco shopping plaza
on Broadway, a few miles from Disneyland. Investigators said there
were no X-ray machines, bone charts, ultrasound machines or other
medical equipment commonly found in chiropractors' offices.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they found $1,300 in cash and copies of advertisements in
Vietnamese-language newspapers describing Midnight Therapy as a place
where "girls happily serve your every need."</TE>
<TE>   Police and neighbors say the operation catered exclusively to male
customers, who would sometimes wait furtively in the parking lot and
toss condoms on the asphalt after leaving.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh yes, they were busy. Extremely busy," said Angel Ergun,
a bridal wear supplier who leases space next door. "I heard a lot of
what was going on. I had to hit the wall. I said, 'Enough!'"</TE>
<TE>   The masseuses wore miniskirts and tightfitting, low-cut tops,
according to affidavits by undercover investigators. On one occasion,
an undercover officer said, he complained to Aquila that a masseuse
had refused to give him a "special massage."</TE>
<TE>   Aquila allegedly told him to ask for a different
woman--"Rosie"--on his next visit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As one of America's biggest tourist destinations, Anaheim has long
struggled to rid itself of prostitution. The city drove out most of
the hookers who hung out in front of neon-lit motels near Disneyland
in the early 1990s. Some rings then moved into massage parlors.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim--along with many other cities--responded with ordinances
requiring all massage employees to get police background checks,
receive certification and undergo training. Nearby Westminster is
considering a proposal to require massage operators to undergo
medical tests for sexually transmitted diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the prostitution rings are moving out of those locales and
into storefront businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to experience the normal types of prostitution"--street
walkers and call girls, said Westminster Police Det. Tom Rackleff.
"But right now the prostitution is in the workplace. Shutting these
places down has become a very difficult game of cat-and-mouse."</TE>
<TE>   The fronts usually operate for months before neighbors complain or
a customer's wife or girlfriend tips off police. Other operations
soon spring up to take their place, with prostitutes trained to foil
undercover police operations.</TE>
<TE>   "They know ... what we're looking for," Rackleff said. "Most
of the girls know how undercover officers operate. They look for wires.
If someone is new, they won't solicit you unless you make a
provocative act first. And if that happens, they can use that as a
sexual assault charge in response."</TE>
<TE>   Chiropractic offices are attractive as fronts for prostitution
because of the way they are regulated.</TE>
<TE>   Although chiropractors must be licensed, the state allows them to
hire unlicensed assistants. By contrast, assistants at massage
parlors often are required to hold massage licenses and register with
city officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any of these chiropractors set up to have
prostitution be a part of their business, but there are some who are
looking to supplement their income," Rackleff said. "Often they're
approached by a business manager who says they can increase their
income with a variety of massage therapists ....It's a wink-and-nod
type of thing. They say, 'Just pay me some money to use the room.
Don't ask, don't tell.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Something just didn't look right about Anthony Wassif's
chiropractic clinic in Commerce, city officials say.</TE>
<TE>   It was in an industrial area, and the only entrance was from a
back alley. Inside were 12 private rooms, showers and video cameras.
A sign at the front door advised clients not to submit to a police
search unless the officers produced a warrant.</TE>
<TE>   City officials shut the Commerce Chiropractic Clinic earlier this
year. Several other offices operated by Wassif have been raided by
Los Angeles police. Wassif, 34, has not been criminally charged, but
the state's chiropractic board is trying to strip him of his license,
alleging that his eight chiropractic clinics in Southern California
are actually houses of prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   Wassif maintains that he was duped. His story sounds eerily like
Aquila's.</TE>
<TE>   Wassif said he answered advertisements in local weekly papers that
promised to pay willing chiropractors up to $1,000 a week. The deal
was that Wassif would apply to the state for a so-called satellite
license, allowing him to operate multiple chiropractic clinics, and a
behind-the-scenes owner would run the facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Wassif said he never knew anything illegal was going on.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of false information flying around out there," said
Wassif, who lives in West Hills. "It's very tough right now for
chiropractors to make money. They get tricked."</TE>
<TE>   Wassif declined to identify who hired him. "I don't want to have
health problems, if you know what I mean," he said. "They've been
around for a long time. First, they'd used acupuncture and
acupressure places and then they realized massage was allowed in
chiropractors' offices."</TE>
<TE>   Raymond Ramirez, assistant director of community development for
Commerce, said he is convinced that a prostitution ring was pulling
the strings at Wassif's Commerce Chiropractic Clinic. "This is not
small peanuts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The premises that Wassif used were leased by a man suspected of
running chiropractic offices that front for prostitution in Inglewood
and other communities, Ramirez said. The man hasn't been charged with
a crime, and Los Angeles County authorities declined to say whether
they are investigating him.</TE>
<TE>   Police investigators across Southern California are comparing
notes in an effort to identify the people who recruited Wassif and
other chiropractors and paid their rent. Officials said the
prostitutes and chiropractors who have been arrested in different
places are often represented in court by the same defense lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got pretty good indications that there are elements of
Asian organized crime behind it," said Sgt. Marcus Frank, a vice
investigator at the Westminster Police Department. "There is
definitely an organization that is recruiting the women, training the
chiropractors how to do it and evade the police, and giving them
legal help."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Birch Acu-Therapy was tucked amid suites of lawyers, real estate
agents, engineers and communication firms in a smoked-glass office
building in the Santa Ana Heights area near Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Men driving Jaguars, Mercedes and BMWs marched up to the office
for what neighbors thought was legitimate therapy. They were shocked
when sheriff's deputies swept in, arresting the chiropractor and
several female assistants in March.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm totally mortified," said Shawna Pierno, the building's
property manager. "This is just so embarrassing.... I always thought
they were good tenants. They were quiet and they always paid their
rent on time."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities contend that Birch Acu-Therapy was a high-end
prostitution service that brought in undocumented young women from
Los Angeles' Koreatown by taxi each morning to serve as "therapists."</TE>
<TE>   For several weeks after the arrests, a stream of patrons continued
to arrive in luxury cars, apparently unaware that Birch Acu-Therapy
was no longer in business.</TE>
<TE>   One regular, a 40-year-old construction contractor from Los
Angeles who declined to give his name, said the operation was upscale
and "professional." The amenities, he said, included private showers,
tranquil posters of mountains landscapes and classic rock music piped
into the three bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad. This place was above-average," he said. "I
drove more than half an hour just because of that. It's kind of like when
you have a favorite restaurant, a place that's clean and you like
what they have on the menu. Why go someplace else?"</TE>

<DH>Conflict: Native Americans, commercial fishermen struggle
as farms siphon off the water and the salmon stocks plummet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KLAMATH RIVER, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The old Eureka Ice building stands almost empty, its cavernous,
frost-caked rooms testimony to a dying industry once sustained by the
Klamath River and its fish.</LD>
<LD>   Where the once-mighty Klamath River meets the sea, commercial
fishermen and Native American tribes together struggle to eke out a
livelihood from steadily dwindling salmon stocks. For much of the
last century, federal water policies serving upriver needs, including
agriculture and hydropower, have taken a severe toll on the lower
Klamath.</LD>
<LD>   Once the West's third-richest salmon river, the Klamath is today a
shadow of its former self. Salmon die stranded in dried-up streams,
weakened by disease, suffocating in warm water sapped of oxygen.</LD>
<TE>   North Coast fishermen brought 4.27 million pounds of salmon into
the three major North Coast ports from 1976 through 1980. In 1998,
they landed only 58,000 pounds. Income from recreational salmon
fishing plummeted 80% in 13 years. So scarce are fish that the Yurok
tribe, which has lived off salmon for centuries, has been able to run
a normal commercial fishing operation in only five of the last 15
years.</TE>
<TE>   The decline of North Coast fisheries has been a long, slow process
as the Klamath and its tributaries were dammed and diverted to
generate electricity and to provide water for alfalfa, onions,
potatoes and other crops in places such as the Klamath Basin, the
Scott and Shasta valleys, and the Central Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction of downriver folk to the loss of fish has been muted
compared with the outcry of farmers 250 miles upriver since last
year, when their water supplies were sharply curtailed by drought and
by provisions of the U.S. Endangered Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   But that is changing. In late April, a group of commercial
fishermen joined environmental groups in filing suit against the
federal government. They invoked the Endangered Species Act in an
attempt to protect coho salmon by sending more water downstream, even
if it means less water for farmers.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge is expected to hold a hearing today and rule soon
on their request for a court order to get water to the salmon
immediately.</TE>
<TE>   At the Interior Department in Washington, officials declined to
comment on the lawsuit, but said they plan to abide by the act.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers and those who depend on their business lashed out at those
bringing the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows once again that they're not willing to work with us to
find us a solution," said Bob Gasser, co-owner of a fertilizer store
in the Oregon border town of Merrill.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw four communities just get ripped last year," said farmer
Rob Crawford of Tule Lake. "Now I'm seeing communities just get their
feet back on the ground. They need this time to settle down, and they
need stability."</TE>
<TE>   The tension between upriver and downriver needs is an inevitable
result of a river system re-engineered beginning nearly a century ago
to serve too many people. Now, as the Bush administration takes steps
to help farmers, people downriver are speaking out.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush Kills Salmon," read signs carried by members of the Yurok,
Karuk and Hoopa tribes who journeyed upriver to Klamath Falls, Ore.,
in March to protest as two Bush administration Cabinet members opened
gates that sent river water into irrigation channels that supply farm
fields.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers popped champagne corks. They describe the struggle for
water as a matter of people versus fish and, as they see it, the
humans were finally getting their due.</TE>
<TE>   "To us, it wasn't a celebration at all," said Susan Masten,
chairman of the Yurok, the largest and one of the poorest Native
American tribes in California. "It was a loss. It was a slap in the
face."</TE>
<TE>   Others downriver watched the ceremony on television, feeling shut
out and ignored.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that farmers feed America, but fishermen feed America
too," said Ronnie Pellegrini, 36, of Eureka, whose fisherman husband
left her and their two young daughters Tuesday to fish for five
months in more promising waters south of San Francisco. Fishing off
the North Coast is severely restricted.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush last month ordered the secretaries of Interior,
Agriculture and Commerce and the head of the Council on Environmental
Quality to come up with plans to balance the needs of the farmers,
tribes and fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to send the message that we are going to pay
attention to all three legs of the stool," said Sue Ellen Wooldridge,
Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton's deputy chief of staff. And, she
added, people in the basin need to work together.</TE>
<TE>   But even scientists are arguing over how to help the river. A
National Academy of Sciences panel has questioned some of the
findings that led to a decision last year to give more water to fish
and less to farmers. Higher flows might actually harm coho salmon by
sending warmer water from upstream lakes into the river, the panel
concluded in a February report that was applauded by farmers. Other
biologists insist that higher water levels are essential to the fish.</TE>
<TE>   The Klamath springs from streams in the mountains of eastern
Oregon, then moves through arid flatlands, irrigated farms and
scrub-covered hills into California. The river winds west through
forests of pine, other conifers and magnificent redwoods before
emptying into the Pacific an hour's drive north of Eureka.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of salmon has forced change on thousands of people on the
lower Klamath. Jimmy Smith gave up fishing after 34 years and
persuaded his son to forgo a life pursuing salmon. Looking out of
place in a suit and tie, Smith stood aboard his still-immaculate boat
in Eureka harbor and stared at the empty berths where his fellow
fishermen once docked.</TE>
<TE>   "They vanished along with the fish," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Eureka Fisheries Co., once one of the West Coast's largest fish
processors, shut down in July. Half a dozen party boats used to
anchor at Eureka for recreational fishing. Only one remains.</TE>
<TE>   Fishing produced $12.4 million in personal income in Humboldt
County in 1987. That dropped to $5.8 million just 12 years later.</TE>
<TE>   Experts blame the collapse on farming, overfishing, increased
regulation, global competition from foreign fishermen, and logging,
which disturbs the forest soil and clogs streams with silt that
sullies spawning grounds.</TE>
<TE>   By 1997, coho salmon were so rare that they were granted
protection under the Endangered Species Act. Coho may be added this
summer to California's own endangered list.</TE>
<TE>   These adaptive, powerful fish are famed for their ability to move
from fresh water to the salty ocean and back to the river to leap up
waterfalls, spawn and die.</TE>
<TE>   Now, when spring irrigation begins, the Klamath drops as if a
million straws were sucking it dry.</TE>
<TE>   The water level in one major Klamath tributary, the Shasta River,
fell so abruptly in April 2001 that salmon were stranded in puddles
in the rocky riverbed. Federal biologist Tom Shaw and other rescuers
rushed upstream and frantically scooped up thousands of fish with a
paint strainer, the only tool they could find in their car. Thousands
more salmon died for lack of water.</TE>
<TE>   "There were just too many fish," Shaw said. "We didn't have the
time. We didn't have the people."</TE>
<TE>   The Yuroks and other tribes still depend on the river and the
salmon, grilling the fish they catch or smoking it for future use.</TE>
<TE>   They credit salmon for keeping them lean and healthy, a belief
predating recent medical research linking oils found in fatty fish
such as salmon with helping prevent heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   But these days, with wild salmon so scarce, the Yuroks eat more
fried foods, and the diabetes rate is rising.</TE>
<TE>   Even the tribal rites of childhood are changing, said Troy
Fletcher, Yurok executive director, whose son loves to fish. "I'd
rather have my son on the river fishing than on the street corner
buying drugs or experimenting with alcohol," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Yurok reservation begins at the mouth of the Klamath, flanking
the river for 44 miles through thick redwood and pine forests mingled
with dogwood, redbud and lush green ferns.</TE>
<TE>   Executive orders in 1855, 1864 and 1891 reserved the rights of the
Yuroks to continue to make a livelihood from the river, for food,
sale and ceremony, Fletcher said. Those rights were reaffirmed in a
1988 Hoopa-Yurok settlement act, he said, and the tribe successfully
defended that right in court as recently as last year.</TE>
<TE>   To protect the river, the tribe employs 15 biologists and as many
as 45 technicians in summer, using grants and tribal money.</TE>
<TE>   But the Yuroks fear they are losing the water war. The farmers
upriver have crafted an elaborate Web site, replete with legal
opinions, snowpack reports, and accounts of agricultural bankruptcies
and other hardships blamed on the Endangered Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   Eighty percent of the Yurok reservation lacks electricity or
telephone service.</TE>
<TE>   "The Indians are too poor to declare bankruptcy," said Yurok
biologist Mike Belchik.</TE>
<TE>   The re-engineering of the Klamath River began in 1907, when the
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation launched a massive irrigation project to
promote settlement and agriculture in the arid plain along the upper
Klamath.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the river flow changed so drastically that Klamath
Falls lost its waterfalls.</TE>
<TE>   Two dams opened in the early 1960s on the Trinity River, the
Klamath's largest and most important salmon tributary. Today, 75% of
Trinity water is rerouted to the Central Valley. Chinook salmon
numbers there have nose-dived as much as 90%.</TE>
<TE>   By 2000, as many as 1,400 farms depended on federal irrigation
water from the Klamath project to grow crops on 220,000 acres along
the Oregon-California border.</TE>
<TE>   The current crisis began last year with a historic drought,
coupled with decisions in court and by regulators that favored two
rare upriver fish and the downriver coho salmon over farmers. The
Bureau of Reclamation was forced to reduce irrigation flow by 90%,
leaving 1,200 farmers without water. With many farmers forced to quit
planting their fields, civic leaders warned that the local economy
was teetering on the brink of ruin.</TE>
<TE>   The protests caught the attention of the White House. President
Bush vowed to do everything he could to deliver water to farmers this
year. Interior Secretary Norton and Agriculture Secretary Ann M.
Veneman personally presided over the March 29 opening of the
irrigation head gates.</TE>
<TE>   Norton, in particular, has come under sharp criticism downriver.</TE>
<TE>   She oversees three agencies with conflicting Klamath agendas: the
Bureau of Reclamation, which provides water to farmers; the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, which oversees rare species; and the Bureau of
Indian Affairs, which is supposed to look out for the interests of
Native Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Central to the Klamath riddle is the Endangered Species Act, as
well as a 2000 court ruling that gives the imperiled fish and the
tribes first priority to Klamath water.</TE>
<TE>   For the Yuroks, like the salmon, the river is the way home.
Traditionally, when a member died, the tribe placed the body aboard a
boat and took it upstream, stopping at sacred spots along the river
to perform ancient death rites. They sometimes follow this ritual
today.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the river is our life," tribal elder Moore said. "We
travel on it. It brings us food. That's why we're careful with the
river."</TE>

<HD>Nike Can't Just Say It, Court Rules</HD>
<DH>Law: Firms can be found liable for deceptive public
statements, justices decide. Critics call the decision a blow to free
speech.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Corporations can be found liable for deceptive advertising if they
make misleading public statements about their operations and conduct,
the California Supreme Court ruled Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In its 4-3 decision, the court said Nike and other corporations
are not protected by the First Amendment when they present as fact
statements about their labor policies or company operations in
advertisements, press releases, letters to the editor or public
statements.</LD>
<LD>   "If a company is going to issue press releases or any information
to the consumer about their factories, they are going to have to tell
the truth," said Alan Caplan, the plaintiff's attorney in the case.
"That shouldn't upset any corporation."</LD>
<TE>   The ruling is expected to increase public scrutiny of corporate
image campaigns. But critics said it also will prevent businesses
from engaging in pubic debate on isues that affect them.</TE>
<TE>   No other state high court is believed to have ruled in such a
case, and a Nike lawyer said the firm is likely to appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The decision "sets a dangerous precedent by restraining companies,
such as Nike, from making public statements about their business
practices when challenged in the arena of public debate," the company
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The court's ruling came as a result of statements Nike made to
defend itself against charges that its products were made in Third
World sweatshops.</TE>
<TE>   Several media outlets published critical stories about working
conditions in Asian factories where Nike's athletic shoes are made,
prompting Nike's response. A San Francisco activist contended that
Nike lied in its press releases and letters to newspapers and
athletic directors, and sued the company for false advertising.</TE>
<TE>   The corporation argued that its statements were protected by
constitutional guarantees of free speech. Lower courts agreed and
dismissed the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The state high court, however, said Thursday that the statements
were commercial in nature and subject to a broad California law that
prohibits misleading advertising.</TE>
<TE>   When a corporation makes "factual representations about its own
products or its own operations, it must speak truthfully," Justice
Joyce L. Kennard wrote for the majority.</TE>
<TE>   Without deciding whether the athletic shoe and apparel maker lied
in its statements, the court revived the lawsuit, which could lead to
a trial and possible restitution.</TE>
<TE>   Justices Ming W. Chin, Marvin Baxter and Janice Rogers Brown
vehemently dissented.</TE>
<TE>   Chin complained that the ruling unfairly protects the free speech
rights of private critics of corporations but not corporations that
defend themselves from attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "If Nike utters a factual misstatement, unlike its critics, it may
be sued for restitution, civil penalties and injunctive relief,"
wrote Chin, whose dissent was signed by Baxter.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, in a separate dissent, said the majority's decision fails
"to account for the realities of the modern world--a world in which
personal, political and commercial arenas no longer have sharply
defined boundaries."</TE>
<TE>   "Nike's commercial statements about its labor practices cannot be
separated from its noncommercial statements about a public issue
because its labor practices are the public issue," Brown wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Labor and environmental groups presented arguments against Nike in
the case, Kasky vs. Nike, while the American Civil Liberties Union
sided with the corporation.</TE>
<TE>   The case arose in 1996 with a report on "48 Hours," the CBS
television news program, about conditions in factories under contract
with Nike in Southeast Asia. Articles about the workers who make Nike
shoes also appeared in several newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   The stories cited claims that the workers were paid less than the
applicable minimum wage, required to work overtime, subject to
physical, verbal and sexual abuse and exposed to toxic chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   Nike countered in public statements, ads and letters that the
factory workers were paid in accordance with local labor laws and on
average received double the minimum wage plus free meals and health
care.</TE>
<TE>   Marc Kasky, 57, who has managed a foundation that preserves San
Francisco's Ft. Mason, decided to sue Nike after reading an article
in the New York Times about the company's contract factories.</TE>
<TE>   If Kasky ultimately prevails at trial, Nike could be ordered to
turn over an unknown amount of profits it has made in California. The
money then could be distributed either to charities or to consumers
who bought Nike products, lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   The state high court relied on U.S. Supreme Court precedents to
distinguish speech that is protected by the 1st Amendment from
commercial speech, which government can regulate and ban if it is
false.</TE>
<TE>   The California court said speech can be commercial even if it is
not in the form of an advertisement.</TE>
<TE>   Communications are subject to government regulation if they are
made by a commercial speaker, such as an officer of a company,
intended for a commercial audience and contain representations of
fact that are commercial in nature, Justice Kennard wrote for the
majority.</TE>
<TE>   'Labor Practices Do Matter'</TE>
<TE>   "Speech is commercial in its content if it is likely to influence
consumers in their commercial decisions," Kennard wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "For a significant segment of the buying public, labor practices
do matter in making consumer choices."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, she said, the ruling "in no way prohibits any
business enterprise from speaking out on issues of public importance
or from vigorously defending its own labor practices."</TE>
<TE>   Nike, in a press release, said it was "extremely disappointed" by
the ruling and stressed that the accusations are unproven.</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturer also said it has made significant progress in its
contract factories since the lawsuit was filed in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which has contracts with more than 700 factories in
more than 50 countries, said it forbids child labor and has raised
wages by more than 40% over the last several years for entry-level
workers in Indonesian shoe factories.</TE>
<TE>   Caplan, an attorney for Kasky, said the ruling will affect
corporate public relations across the country.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't say, 'We are issuing this for everybody's ears except
those people under California Supreme Court jurisdiction,'" Caplan
said.</TE>
<TE>   Al Meyerhoff, a plaintiffs' lawyer who also worked on the Kasky
case, said corporations should be held accountable if they lie.</TE>
<TE>   "If companies are claiming their goods are manufactured under
certain conditions--no clear cutting or organic food or free from
child labor--if those statements are being made, they should be
true," Meyerhoff said.</TE>
<TE>   But Ann Brick, an attorney with the ACLU of Northern California,
declared that free speech was "the loser" in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Its impact could be very broad," Brick said. "If you are a
business speaker, your ability to speak out on a public issue that
directly affects your company is dramatically affected."</TE>
<TE>   Ruling Could 'Open a Business to Extortion'</TE>
<TE>   The 1st Amendment dictates that "it's the people, not the
government, who gets to decide which side is right" in a public
debate, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Fred J. Hiestand, general counsel for the Civil Justice Assn. of
California, said the ruling will limit corporations' ability to
defend themselves against false charges and expose them to undue
pressure from interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would open a business to extortion," said Hiestand,
whose group represents a coalition of business interests and others
that promote tort reform.</TE>
<TE>   Lester L. Jones, a partner in the Los Angeles office of Littler
Mendelson, the nation's largest corporate employment law firm, said
the decision creates an uneven playing field for business.</TE>
<TE>   "This case has the potential to place a chill on the rights of an
employer to defend itself in the court of public opinion," Jones
said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California Highway Patrol officers moved in Thursday to halt
shredding at the state's information technology department, and Gov.
Gray Davis suspended the agency's chief amid a widening investigation
of the state's multimillion-dollar computer contract with Oracle
Corp.</LD>
<LD>   As those developments were unfolding in the Capitol, Davis'
director of e-government, Arun Baheti, quit.</LD>
<LD>   His resignation came one day after he acknowledged to Davis aides
that he had personally accepted a $25,000 Oracle check for the
governor's reelection committee, which reported receiving the money
two weeks after the state signed the $95-million computer software
deal.</LD>
<TE>   Late Thursday, Davis issued a statement saying that he would give
"immediate and careful attention" to an offer Oracle has said it made
in the past to rescind the entire deal. Oracle said earlier in the
day that its offer to undo the contract still stood.</TE>
<TE>   That contract has become the object of scrutiny and criticism. A
state audit concluded that the deal, designed to save money, could
cost the government $41 million more than if there had been no
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Baheti was the second department head in a week to lose his job as
a result of the controversy, and a third, Information Technology
Director Elias Cortez, was suspended by Davis on Thursday pending the
outcome of the state investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Oracle deal has become a political issue for the
governor, who is seeking reelection. Republican gubernatorial nominee
Bill Simon Jr. suggested that Davis aides engaged in a cover-up, and
other Republican leaders called on federal authorities to become
involved in the probe.</TE>
<TE>   Davis offered no comment on either Baheti's resignation or his
suspension of Cortez, who will continue to receive his $123,255
annual salary during his indefinite leave.</TE>
<TE>   "There was shredding, but we have no idea what it was," Davis
Press Secretary Steven Maviglio said, adding that Cortez was not in
the building Wednesday when the shredding occurred. "Was there
shredding related to the Oracle contract? We have no idea. That's
what we want to find out."</TE>
<TE>   While department officials said any shredding was routine, Atty.
Gen. Bill Lockyer said in a statement: "Any destruction of documents,
e-mail and other materials that may be associated with the Oracle
contract could pose the potential for obstruction of justice."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' legal advisor, Barry Goode, said his office received an
unsubstantiated report of document shredding at the Department of
Information Technology.After calling the department to check on the
report, he said, he informed Lockyer's office. Highway Patrol
officers were then dispatched to the department headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Simon issued a statement suggesting that Davis or his staff shared
responsibility for the shredding. "I'm deeply disturbed that it
appears the governor's legal affairs advisor called the Department of
Information Technology while documents were being shredded and let
DOIT officials know that the attorney general's office was en route.
If this is true, it's essentially letting them know they have an hour
to shred."</TE>
<TE>   Republican Assembly Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks called on the
U.S. attorney in Sacramento to enter the investigation, alleging that
the Davis administration has tried to derail the Legislature's probe.</TE>
<TE>   "The terms of the Oracle contract and any attempts on behalf [of]
the Davis administration to silence state-level inquiries into this
matter are most troubling," Cox said in a letter to acting U.S. Atty.
John K. Vincent.</TE>
<TE>   Cortez had a lead role in pushing for the deal in which Oracle
proposed to license software for as many as 277,000 state employees
and contended that it would save the state as much as $111 million,
according to the state audit.</TE>
<TE>   The audit said officials improperly relied on claims by Oracle and
its partner in the venture, Logicon, that their software would save
the state money. Further, the audit said, the state evidently was
unaware Logicon stood to make more than $28 million on the deal.</TE>
<TE>   A department spokesman said accusations of improper shredding were
untrue and unfair to an agency that already has been demoralized by
"negative" news reports of its role in the Oracle debacle. "I have
been aware of no illicit shredding of any kind," said Communications
Director Kevin Terpstra. "In terms of shredding contracts or official
records, I do not believe that has occurred and I have no knowledge
of that occurring."</TE>
<TE>   The document shredding occurred as Department of Information
Technology officials were preparing to testify before a legislative
oversight committee Monday. Terpstra said department employees were
preparing documents for the committee and "making sure everything was
correct."</TE>
<TE>   Terpstra said the department owns 24 shredders that are used to
destroy "nonessential" confidential documents it gets from other
state agencies that are embarking on computer technology contracts.
He said the department has an understanding with those agencies that
after reviewing confidential drafts and reports it will shred them.</TE>
<TE>   A department worker, speaking on the condition that she not be
identified, said about 10 plainclothes officers with the Justice
Department filed into the office on the 21st floor of the downtown
high-rise at about noon. Others, including two Sacramento Police
Department officers and two state police officers, arrived shortly
thereafter. About 1 p.m., the worker said, bosses sent an e-mail
telling employees to shut down their computer systems.</TE>
<TE>   She said the contracts office had been working to prepare
documents requested by the governor's office and legislative
committees. The contracts office was locked at 5 p.m. Wednesday, as
it normally is, and the large shredder that sits in the hallway
outside the contracts office was not used at all Thursday, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department investigators took away some documents, she
said, but even if anything was shredded Wednesday night, nothing
would be lost because the contracts at the Information Technology
office are all copies and the originals are kept at the Department of
General Services.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a bureaucrat by profession," said the Information Technology
worker. "I understand policy. But this was totally unfounded."</TE>
<TE>   The Davis campaign committee reported receiving the Oracle check
in June, two weeks after Oracle won the lucrative state software
contract, which was awarded without competitive bidding. A source
close to Davis' campaign committee said the check was dated in March,
but could not explain why it was received in June.</TE>
<TE>   In his resignation letter to Davis, Baheti made no mention of the
campaign donation. Rather, he said, "It is apparent in retrospect
that I should have more vociferously raised questions about the
details" of the deal with Oracle and Logicon, a subsidiary of
Northrop Grumman.</TE>
<TE>   "Today," the letter continued, "there are people who would use me
as a tool to attack you and the important work of the administration.
I refuse to allow my service to you to become a distraction from the
real work of government or to detract from your accomplishments. I
cannot stay if my effectiveness for you has been compromised; the
faith you placed in me deserves nothing less."</TE>
<TE>   Baheti, a lawyer, had been state director of e-government since
September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   He also had worked for Davis when the governor was lieutenant
governor, and worked on Davis' 1998 election campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Baheti has told aides to Davis that when he took the check, he was
not on government property, but was having dinner with a friend who
is a lobbyist.</TE>
<TE>   It is illegal to conduct such campaign activity in the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Aides to Davis informed Lockyer about the transaction. Lockyer's
office is investigating circumstances involving the state contract
with Oracle.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor has had a policy of not allowing his state employees
to be involved in our fund-raising in any way," said Davis campaign
strategist Garry South.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not illegal for them to do, but it is his preference that
they not do so," South said.</TE>
<TE>   South said that although the governor's political aides were aware
in June that Baheti had violated Davis' policy by taking the check,
the campaign decided against returning it.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no way of knowing what Oracle's motivation was," South
said of the timing. "The check came from a well-known California
company and it didn't violate any law."</TE>
<TE>   Oracle spokesman Jim Finn said he did not know why the check was
dated in March. He said the person who gave the $25,000 check to
Baheti was Ravi Mehta, a lobbyist hired by Oracle and also a former
chairman of the Fair Political Practices Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Political contributions are entirely separate from any sale
activities and always have been," Finn said. "California is our home
state and we have more than 10,000 employees in the state, so it is
natural that we would want to contribute to the governor."</TE>
<TE>   Baheti is the second official to resign as a result of the Oracle
deal. On Friday, Barry Keene quit as director of the state Department
of General Services.</TE>

<HD>Early Fires Worry Birders</HD>
<DH>Environment: Habitats could be threatened in bird-watching
mecca of southeastern Arizona as drought increases fuel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>Wildlife managers and bird watchers are keeping an anxious eye on the
region's world-famous bird habitat--home to nearly 500 species of
birds--as forest fires continue to rage across southeastern Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   Fire crews on Thursday contained a 36,000-acre fire that burned
near Fort Huachuca, about 70 miles south of here. That blaze centered
on a mountain range containing three canyons that are meccas for bird
watchers.</LD>
<LD>   This week's fire did not do any significant damage to the canyons
but one had already been threatened. Ramsey Canyon Preserve, an
internationally known destination for birders, was shut down for a
week in March because of an early-season wildfire.</LD>
<TE>   With a long-term drought here making fires more likely, experts
say bird habitats are in peril because they are often precisely in
the path of wildfires--heavily wooded areas.</TE>
<TE>   "If all three canyons were to go, you're talking about real
problems with habitat," said Carol Lambert, Ramsey Canyon's manager.
Although the 300-acre preserve, operated by the Nature Conservancy,
was well fortified against fire, the potential was great for damage
to the area's rare birds, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it's a pretty scary fire season," she said. "Chances
of a huge fire here are slim, but they are better this year than any
time in the last 50 years. And, given the number of rare birds we
have here, fire damage would be a great loss."</TE>
<TE>   Bird watching-related tourism is a boon to the region's economy,
supporting a string of bed and breakfast inns. Bird watchers come
from around the world and stay in southeastern Arizona for weeks at a
time, making a tour that takes in the Chiricahua Mountains in the
east to the Huachuca Mountains and the Santa Rita Mountains in the
west.</TE>
<TE>   Birders flock here because of the great variety of birds--many of
them rare--and for the region's surprising biodiversity. Among the
seldom-seen birds that have made the region famous: elegant trogons,
hepatic tanagers, whiskered screech owls, Arizona woodpeckers,
dusky-capped flycatchers and dozens of species of hummingbirds.</TE>
<TE>   Birding is a $15-billion industry in this country, with Arizona
and Texas as the top two destinations, said Andy Thompson, publisher
of Bird Watcher's Digest.</TE>
<TE>   "In the minds of most birders, southeast Arizona is certainly in
the top two or three bird watching hot spots in the continental
United States," Thompson said. "They've got a long history of
catering to and addressing and servicing bird watchers. For us, these
fires are a difficult thing to witness."</TE>
<TE>   Experts agree that fire is not necessarily bad and in fact may
improve the long-term health of a forest. But the massive, hot fires
officials fear would certainly destroy whole forests and bird habitat
with it.</TE>
<TE>   Hotter fires happen in areas where fires have not been allowed to
burn naturally and dead wood and underbrush pile up.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing that is worrisome is that because of fire
suppression, the fires we do have tend to be extreme. They have the
potential to be bigger and more devastating," said Courtney Conway,
an avian ecologist at the University of Arizona. Conway is studying
the buff-breasted flycatcher, a rare bird that is believed to fare
better in fire-damaged areas.</TE>
<TE>   Low-intensity fire, experts say, will likely benefit birds. Sheri
Williamson is a biologist and hummingbird expert at the Southeast
Arizona Bird Observatory in Bisbee, which hosts a hummingbird
festival every August. She said the fire's clearing of trees creates
meadows, increases the insect population and makes birds happy.</TE>
<TE>   Birds are also more likely to quickly return to a habitat burned
by a low-intensity fire, Williamson said.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, experts say, birds smell smoke and fly away before fires
ever reach them. In the case of a devastating fire that destroys vast
tracts of habitat, flocks will relocate to the closest suitable
place. Succeeding generations may or may not return to the original
nesting area once the habitat is restored.</TE>
<TE>   The special concern now is that the fires in Arizona are occurring
so early, at the start of nesting season.</TE>
<TE>   Mother birds "won't leave their young unless, literally, flames
are at the trunk of their nesting tree," Lambert said.</TE>
<TE>   Lambert also manages a bed and breakfast that serves visitors to
Ramsey Canyon. She said the inn had to be evacuated during the
Oversight Fire in March, which burned to within 11/2 miles of the
preserve.</TE>
<TE>   Bird watchers, she said, are constantly monitoring local
conditions and bird populations via the Internet. The fires--and fear
of them--have been bad for business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty flat since the fires in March," Lambert said. "Some
people called yesterday to ask about the Ryan fire [in Fort Huachuca]
and wanted to know if we were affected. People around here view the
preserve as a jewel--it's important for the local economy. Fires
don't help the birds or us."</TE>

<HD>Bush Breaks With Right on Policy Toward Saudi Arabia</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Conservatives push hard line against the Saudis,
but White House isn't following.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush's deepening embrace of Saudi Arabia is
dividing the administration from the dominant current in conservative
opinion as much as any domestic or foreign issue.</LD>
<LD>   Since Sept. 11, conservative leaders and publications have urged
Bush to pursue a harder line against the Saudis, whom the right
accuses of encouraging anti-Western attitudes and, at least
indirectly, subsidizing terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Bush has praised the Saudis as partners in the war
against terrorism and has provided them a growing role in the search
for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Bush moved to deepen
that alliance at his meeting last week with Saudi Crown Prince
Abdullah, when the sides agreed on what one senior White House
official termed a "complementary effort" to push the Israelis and
Palestinians toward agreement.</LD>
<TE>   The prospect of the United States working with the Saudis and
other Arab states to simultaneously seek concessions from their
respective allies--the Israelis and the Palestinians--has raised
alarms among some U.S. Jewish groups and conservative leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea . . . that the Saudis are going to lean on [Palestinian
leader Yasser] Arafat while we lean on our Israeli friends to force a
political solution is disgusting," said Gary Bauer, a leading
conservative activist.</TE>
<TE>   While insisting that that characterization oversimplifies the
strategy, administration officials show no sign of accepting the
conservative calls for reducing reliance on the Saudis. Some White
House aides acknowledge that it is difficult to think of another
foreign policy issue in which Bush has so thoroughly rejected the
central strain of conservative opinion as in his promotion of closer
ties with Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   In that tilt, some conservative critics see the hands of Vice
President Dick Cheney and the president's father, ex-President George
Bush, both of whom have long advocated close Saudi relations. "I
suspect the explanation is blood is thicker than loyalty to
conservatives," said one conservative closely watching administration
policy.</TE>
<TE>   As he has zigged and zagged in search of a sustainable Middle East
policy, Bush regularly has drawn flak from conservative critics. Most
agitated have been the Jewish and Roman Catholic intellectuals, known
as neoconservatives, and leaders of the evangelical Christian
movement, which has become a staunchly pro-Israel constituency.</TE>
<TE>   But on virtually all of the policy issues under dispute--how much
to rely on Arafat, whether to seek to restrain Israeli military
action--Bush has reflected at least some of the conservative
argument, even if he hasn't gone as far in that direction as his
critics prefer.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's favorable posture toward Saudi Arabia may be the great
exception in that pattern. "I can't think of anything in foreign
policy that would be as much a repudiation of the conservative view,"
one White House aide said.</TE>
<TE>   That may be partly because the critics are urging such a wrenching
shift in U.S. policy. For decades, presidents of the two major
parties have pursued close ties with the Saudis, who sit atop a
quarter of the world's known oil reserves and also have been seen as
a source of stability in the turbulent region. In 1990, the first
President Bush sent U.S. troops to protect Saudi Arabia against a
feared invasion from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   But since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon, in which 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi
citizens, the Saudi regime has come under withering fire from U.S.
critics, mostly conservatives. In a steady stream of articles,
conservative publications such as the National Review and the Weekly
Standard have accused the kingdom of exporting its domestic
discontent by funding militant Islamic groups and schools that teach
anti-Western attitudes abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "The Saudis, in short, have created a radical Muslim network from
the Philippines to Chicago," National Review editor Rich Lowry wrote
earlier this year in an article titled "Desert Rats."</TE>
<TE>   Other critics have accused Saudi leaders of failing to adequately
investigate the links between Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who is
the son of a prominent Saudi family, and individuals and institutions
inside the kingdom. A state-sponsored Saudi telethon to support
Palestinian "martyrs" and the publication of a poem by the Saudi
ambassador to Britain praising Palestinian suicide bombers have only
deepened the strains.</TE>
<TE>   "Since Sept. 11, most conservatives, and I dare say most
Americans, have considered Saudi Arabia more part of the problem than
part of the solution in the war on terrorism," said William Kristol,
editor of the Weekly Standard.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials privately echo some of the conservative
complaints about Saudi links to extremism. Bush, in his closed-door
meetings with Abdullah, stressed that Arab nations "had to address
the issue of incitement of violence," one senior aide said.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not clear how forcefully Bush raised those concerns. And
in public, he has only praised the Saudis and Abdullah for their
contributions to seeking peace. "He's been very strong in the
condemnation of terror, for which I'm grateful," Bush said of
Abdullah.</TE>
<TE>   More important, Bush has tightened coordination with the Saudis in
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</TE>
<TE>   While conservatives see the Saudis mostly as a problem in the
region, the administration sees them as part of the solution to a
perplexing dilemma: how to revive a peace process without relying on
Arafat, whom the president has made clear he doesn't trust. The Bush
administration's answer is to increase the role of other Arab
nations--led by the Saudis, the Egyptians and the Jordanians--in any
talks. Bush administration officials say they believe one reason that
President Clinton's efforts to broker an Israeli-Palestinian deal
failed was because he didn't involve other Arab states until the last
moment.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing we have been consistently trying to do is get the Arabs
involved in a productive way on this," the White House aide said.</TE>

<HD>Wind Theory May Clear Up Warming Mysteries</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is one of the biggest climate mysteries today: If the Earth is
getting warmer, why are vast parts of Antarctica getting colder?</LD>
<LD>   For the last decade, the behavior of Antarctica has become
increasingly inexplicable. And the inability of scientists to figure
out what they were seeing has been one of the most troubling gaps in
explanations for why the Earth seems to be warming--one repeatedly
pointed to by global warming skeptics.</LD>
<LD>   Now a team of researchers thinks it has an answer to the Antarctic
puzzle. The explanation involves the effect of wind patterns far
above the Earth's surface as well as the hole in the atmosphere's
ozone layer that opens over Antarctica for several months each year.</LD>
<TE>   If correct, the explanation would close a big gap in theories
about global warming. But the explanation also suggests that up to
half the warming may be caused by changes in the wind patterns of the
stratosphere, implying that human activity, while a major factor, is
not the direct cause of as much of the warming as many experts and
activists have thought.</TE>
<TE>   The mystery of Antarctica is that one part of the continent has
warmed dramatically even as the rest of the continent has gotten
colder.</TE>
<TE>   Along the slender Antarctic peninsula, which juts toward South
America, ice shelves the size of Delaware and Connecticut have
thinned, collapsed and broken off, disintegrating into bergs.</TE>
<TE>   But in Antarctica's frozen interior, the temperature has dropped
and glaciers have grown. Instead of retreating, sea ice on the
eastern side of the continent has thickened.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been lots of thinking on what is causing the warming, but
the cooling has remained a mystery," said David W.J. Thompson, an
atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson studies the swirling patterns of wind in the
stratosphere, the high, thin part of the planet's atmosphere six
miles overhead.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, scientists thought nothing much happened in this
wispy realm to directly affect the Earth's weather, that the winds
there merely responded to atmospheric turbulence closer to the
Earth's surface.</TE>
<TE>   Work by a number of atmospheric scientists in recent years,
though, suggests that the tail may wag the dog: The lightweight
stratosphere doesn't merely respond to the thicker lower atmosphere;
instead, it shapes the weather far below.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Thompson and John M. Wallace of the University of
Washington suggested in a paper in the journal Science that a
stratospheric pattern that swirls an enormous doughnut of wind above
southern Alaska and north-central Europe plays a central role in
determining the climate throughout the Northern Hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   A weather pattern that is associated with those high-altitude
winds is called the Northern Annular Mode, and it seesaws between two
phases.</TE>
<TE>   In one phase, air pressures are high over the polar cap and
high-altitude winds are weak.</TE>
<TE>   When this pattern is in effect, cold Arctic air masses flow
downward and cool more temperate parts of North America and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In the other phase, high-altitude winds stay strong, holding cold
northern air in and steering ocean storms north.</TE>
<TE>   This means that North America and Europe stay much warmer than
normal.</TE>
<TE>   For the last few decades, the Northern Annular Mode has largely
stayed locked in the second phase. This has allowed warmer weather to
sweep out over the planet's northern reaches.</TE>
<TE>   That helps explain why parts of the Arctic have seen such dramatic
warming in this time period and why winters throughout North America
and Eurasia have generally been less bitter.</TE>
<TE>   The atmospheric pattern could be responsible for about a third of
the warming throughout the Northern Hemisphere in the last three
decades.</TE>
<TE>   That warming is so dramatic that many scientists think that
year-round sea ice in the Arctic could disappear within 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Any perception that winters have been less wintry is as much due
to changes in atmospheric circulation than to increases in global
mean temperature," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   "The big question is, was this also happening in the South?" said
Thompson. He and Susan Solomon, an expert on Antarctic ozone
depletion with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
decided to take a look. They paid particular attention to a major
disruption in the southern stratosphere--the ozone hole.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis was more difficult for the Southern Hemisphere:
Temperature records in the uninhabited region are rare and sparse.
The team, Wallace said, "really made use of just about all the data
there is."</TE>
<TE>   As in the Northern Hemisphere, the winds high in the stratosphere
over Antarctica also are organized in predictable patterns and have
an associated weather pattern called the Southern Annular Mode. It,
like its northern counterpart, has two variations.</TE>
<TE>   For a great deal of the last few decades, the Southern Annular
Mode has followed a pattern in which winds are strong and cold air
remains trapped in polar regions. That pattern helps explain the
Antarctic puzzle: Temperatures at the South Pole and in Antarctica's
interior remain colder than they otherwise would be while
temperatures at the edge of the continent rise.</TE>
<TE>   The ozone hole, which forms high over Antarctica in December,
plays an additional role. Without the insulating layer of ozone, the
stratosphere gets very cold and polar stratospheric winds tend to
speed up.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson and Solomon found that in the months after the ozone hole
appeared, the high-altitude winds were strongest and the weather in
those parts of Antarctica known to be cooling were coldest.</TE>
<TE>   Not all scientists are convinced that the stratosphere--an
atmospheric lightweight--plays such a powerful role or that the new
study proves that the changes in the stratosphere cause changes at
the surface and not vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence is there that there is indeed an effect. There's
just some question over what the magnitude is," said James Hurrell,
an atmospheric scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric
Research in Boulder, Colo., whose studies focus on the role that the
oceans play in controlling global climate.</TE>
<TE>   While the new findings explain most of the cooling seen in parts
of Antarctica, the atmospheric circulation can account for only about
half of the warming seen elsewhere on the continent, suggesting that
other factors, including human-induced global warming, may be
involved.</TE>
<TE>   Humans' use of chemicals has ripped apart the protective ozone
layer. In addition, greenhouse gases may help create the
stratospheric conditions that Thompson and Solomon described.</TE>
<TE>   The same gases that warm the surface of the planet can make the
stratosphere cooler by reflecting sunlight away from the Earth.
Cooling the stratosphere may lead to stronger wind patterns and
change the way that the Northern and Southern Annular Modes work. If
that is the case, greenhouse gases may hijack these natural patterns
and intensify them. The new findings on the planet's southern edge
add some credence to that idea.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing similar trends in both hemispheres, which adds
weight to the argument we're seeing changes that are truly global,
fundamental changes in the structure of the atmosphere that could be
human-induced," Wallace of the University of Washington said.</TE>

<HD>FDA Approves Heart Device With Jump-Start Mechanism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved a new heart
implant that combines a souped-up pacemaker to boost the heart's
pumping power with a jump-starter that kicks in if the heart stops.</LD>
<LD>   Guidant Corp.'s Contak CD is the first implanted defibrillator
with "cardiac resynchronization," a way to make a struggling heart
beat more normally by forcing its main pumping chambers to work
together.</LD>
<LD>   A resynchronizer is already available from Medtronic Inc., and
many companies sell implanted defibrillators that jump-start hearts
that suddenly stop beating. Guidant's device is the first to combine
the two types of implants.</LD>
<TE>   The caveat: Doctors can't yet tell who will benefit from
resynchronization therapy, FDA medical reviewer Helen Barold said.</TE>
<TE>   The Contak CD is for advanced heart-failure patients who are not
adequately helped by medication and need a defibrillator.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very individualized," Barold cautioned. "It's a little bit
of a last resort for patients."</TE>

<HD>Massive Farm Subsidy Bill Passes House</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Outlays for major crops would grow by 70% over
a decade. Measure also restores a food stamp program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House on Thursday passed a farm bill that would increase
government subsidies for major commodities by 70% over the next
decade, scrapping a 6-year-old law that sought to wean farmers off
government aid.</LD>
<LD>   The bill also includes an important provision for many in
California: It restores federal food stamp benefits for legal
immigrants who lost them in 1996 under the Welfare Reform Act.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate is expected to approve the bill early next week, and
President Bush said Thursday that he planned to sign it. Although the
White House earlier had resisted big subsidy increases, Bush hailed
the measure for providing "a generous and reliable safety net" for
farmers.</LD>
<TE>   The bill calls for federal aid to farms to total $171 billion over
10 years, an increase of $73.5 billion over current levels. It
provides the biggest benefits to farms in the South and Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   Far less would go to California, even though the state is the
biggest agricultural producer in the nation. That's because federal
farm programs focus on subsidizing specified row crops--corn, wheat,
rice and cotton among them--while most of California's farmers grow
fruits and vegetables not covered by federal programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very pleased with the farm bill overall," said Bill Pauli,
president of the California Farm Bureau. "But for fruit and vegetable
and specialty crop producers, there is very little in the farm bill
for them. That's one of the frustrations."</TE>
<TE>   Fruit and vegetable growers stand to benefit from the bill's new
spending on conservation programs--an increase of $17 billion, or
80%, over 10 years--and other provisions that promote agricultural
research and exports.</TE>
<TE>   But only 9% of all California farms receive the commodity
subsidies that make up the bulk of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the state received $586.4 million in federal agricultural
assistance in 2001 out of a total federal agriculture budget of $21
billion, according to the California Farm Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   The bill passed the House, 280 to 141. The California delegation
tilted against the measure: 34 opposed it (11 Republicans, 23
Democrats); 17 voted for it (nine Republicans, eight Democrats).</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, Democrat Barbara Boxer said she would vote for the
bill despite the concerns that her home state farmers in California
did not get an equitable share of aid. An aide to Democrat Dianne
Feinstein said she was undecided.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was praised by farm groups, but lambasted by analysts at
both ends of the political spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists and advocates for smaller family farms opposed
the measure because it did not include a provision--approved in a
version initially passed by the Senate--that would have slapped an
annual cap of $275,000 per farm couple on federal subsidy payments.
The cap had gained considerable political momentum as a way to
channel more money to small and mid-size farms and reduce big
payments to a relatively small number of large agribusinesses.</TE>
<TE>   But the cap ran into powerful opposition from Southern farmers,
whose big rice and cotton operations would have been hardest hit by
it. The compromise drafted by a House-Senate conference committee set
a $360,000 cap on payments--but left loopholes that critics said
rendered the limit meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives also denounced the bill because it repudiated the
free-market principals of the Freedom to Farm Act of 1996. That
measure was designed to eliminate government planting controls and
subsidies, and thus open agriculture to the risks and rewards of the
free market.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Butler, vice president of the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank, denounced the bill as "a shameless example
of pork-barrel spending" that Bush should veto.</TE>
<TE>   Bush opposed earlier versions of the bill for providing increased
subsidies that he argued would stimulate overproduction and benefit a
relatively small number of big farms.</TE>
<TE>   He said Thursday that he would sign the compromise measure
because, among other things, it included strong conservation
provisions and would spread spending more evenly over its 10-year
period.</TE>
<TE>   As he did when he approved steel import quotas earlier this year,
Bush's support for the farm bill shows his willingness to alienate
free-market allies when faced with stiff demands from a politically
important constituency.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's backers said the new and increased commodity subsidies
were needed to stabilize a farm economy that has been battered by low
prices ever since the 1996 legislation passed.</TE>
<TE>   "This farm bill provides for a strong safety net for our
agricultural producers," said House Agriculture Committee Chairman
Larry Combest (R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   The food stamp provision was included because the bill
reauthorized nutrition programs. It restores food stamp eligibility
for any legal immigrant who has been in the United States for at
least five years; legal immigrant children would become immediately
eligible, without a residency requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional analysts estimate that about 360,000 legal
immigrants and their children would be affected; about a third of
them are estimated to be in California.</TE>
<TE>   The principal impact in California will be to reduce state
government costs for food stamps. That is because the state since
1998 has picked up the cost of continuing food stamps to legal
immigrants after they were cut off by federal law.</TE>

<HD>Documents Claim Hastert Belittled Rights Concerns</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Before becoming House speaker, Rep. J. Dennis Hastert told Colombian
military officers that he was "sick and tired" of human rights
considerations controlling U.S. anti-drug aid, according to a newly
declassified government document.</LD>
<LD>   At the time, the Clinton administration was pushing Colombia to
improve its human rights performance as a condition of receiving U.S.
aid.</LD>
<LD>   Leading a May 1997 congressional delegation, Hastert also
encouraged Colombian military and police officers to bypass the White
House and deal directly with Congress, according to a cable signed by
then-Ambassador Myles Frechette.</LD>
<TE>   John Feehery, Hastert's spokesman, said the speaker strongly
supports human rights efforts in Colombia and that the language in
the cable likely reflected that Hastert "did not have a particularly
strong relationship" with Frechette.</TE>
<TE>   The cable was among 70 documents obtained by the National Security
Archive, an independent research center.</TE>

<HD>Ethnicity Discrepancy Found in Patients in HIV Trials</HD>
<DH>Health: Study suggests facility location, mistrust of care
as reasons for lower black and Latino enrollment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Black and Latino HIV patients are enrolling in experimental
treatments at much lower rates than whites, according to a national
study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers say the disparity is caused by minorities' mistrust of
experimental treatments and lack of access to university health
facilities.</LD>
<LD>   Those experimental HIV treatments may be the last hope for
patients who fail to respond to retroviral drugs, said Dr. Allen
Gifford, lead author of the study.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, "being able to entertain the option of experimental
care is important," said Gifford, a physician and researcher at the
Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System.</TE>
<TE>   The study did not track whether patients enrolled in the
experiments had exhausted other more mainstream options.</TE>
<TE>   Gifford's team analyzed data from a Rand Corp.-sponsored study of
2,864 HIV patients receiving care across the country from 1996 to
1998.</TE>
<TE>   At the study's outset, 49% of the 231,000 Americans receiving any
type of HIV treatment were white, 33% were black and 15% were Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Of those enrolled in trials, however, 62% were white, 23% were
black and 11% were Latino, even if whites and minorities had similar
education, type of health insurance and degree of illness.</TE>
<TE>   Although the study did not survey patients about the cause of the
discrepancy, researchers stressed that access to the experiments
plays a role. Many university centers providing treatment are not
near ethnic neighborhoods, said Gail Wyatt, associate director of the
UCLA AIDS Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Also, African Americans may associate experimental therapies with
the notorious Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment. From 1932 to 1972,
Alabama doctors lied to poor black patients, studying the disease
when left untreated.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a reason to start from a position of suspiciousness,"
Wyatt said.</TE>
<TE>   It is customary for contemporary medical researchers to provide
consent forms with as many as 10 pages, but that may backfire, said
Susan Cohn, AIDS researcher and associate professor of medicine at
the University of Rochester in New York. "People may be more turned
off than not," she said. "There's a wariness on the part of
patients."</TE>
<TE>   The study also found that patients with fee-for-service health
insurance were more likely than those in HMOs to receive experimental
treatment, as were subjects whose primary-care physician is fewer
than eight miles from a major clinical trial center.</TE>
<TE>   The study also looked at gender and found that women were enrolled
in the experiments at rates comparable to their overall rate of HIV
treatment, Gifford said. In recent years, researchers have made a
special effort to recruit women who may infect their babies in utero.</TE>

<HD>No Indictment in Death of Immigrant</HD>
<DH>Law: A Houston grand jury's failure to bring charges
against police officers angers the Latino community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A grand jury Thursday chose not to indict four police officers in the
suffocation death of a Mexican immigrant in a case that angered
Latino leaders.</LD>
<LD>   They said the Harris County grand jury's decision sent a racist
message and called for the Latino community to take "drastic action."</LD>
<LD>   The Baytown police officers were accused of using excessive force
when they detained Luis Alfonso Torres, 45, on Jan. 19 after he fled
from an ambulance called in by relatives concerned that he had high
blood pressure.</LD>
<TE>   A police video showed the officers throwing him to the ground,
then piling on top of him as he struggled to get up. Torres, a legal
immigrant from Mexico, stopped breathing and died the next day in the
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The death was ruled a homicide by Harris County Medical Examiner
Joye Carter, who said Torres suffered "mechanical asphyxiation," or
compression of his airways.</TE>
<TE>   Baytown police officials defended the officers, saying they
followed proper procedures.</TE>
<TE>   League of United Latin American Citizens local director Johnny
Mata reacted angrily to the grand jury's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "The message is 'it's open season to kill Mexicans and get away
with it,'" he said at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   He said Latinos should consider a citywide work stoppage to make
their anger known.</TE>
<TE>   "Think about how many people would not report to work in a lot of
the construction sites and the loss of money the city will have,"
Mata said.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican Consul Enrique Buj Flores, at the same conference, said he
"deeply deplored the grand jury's decision" but charged that police
officers in Houston are not punished for crimes against Mexicans.</TE>
<TE>   In another controversial case, a 1998 grand jury refused to indict
Houston police officers who shot Mexican immigrant Pedro Obregon
Navarro to death after breaking into his apartment without a warrant
in search of drugs. No drugs were found, and the Houston police chief
called the case an "egregious" case of official misconduct, but the
Harris County grand jury thought otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Harris County prosecutor Don Smyth, who helped direct the grand
jury's investigation in the Torres case, said the jury had done well.</TE>
<TE>   "They made a full inquiry, and I have no reason to believe any
other grand jury would not reach the same conclusion," the prosecutor
said.</TE>

<HD>House, Senate Express Firm Support for Israel</HD>
<DH>Congress: Resolutions put Bush in an awkward position as he
works to defuse Mideast violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House and Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly approved resolutions
to support Israel and condemn Palestinian suicide bombers, but only
after a debate that exposed some sharp divisions over the
congressional intervention in Middle East diplomacy.</LD>
<LD>   The votes allowed lawmakers to express collectively the outrage
many have voiced individually as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has
escalated.</LD>
<LD>   Approval of the two resolutions, legally nonbinding but
politically significant, puts President Bush in a somewhat awkward
position as he reaches out to Arab allies of the Palestinians in an
attempt to defuse the Middle East violence.</LD>
<TE>   The House voted 352 to 21 for a lengthy, tough-worded resolution
sponsored by Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) that condemns "the
ongoing support of terror" by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
suggests that his actions "are not those of a viable partner for
peace," and supports additional U.S. aid "to help Israel defend
itself."</TE>
<TE>   In a 94-2 vote, the Senate approved a shorter, milder resolution
sponsored by Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.). It declares
"solidarity with Israel, a front-line state in the war against
terrorism," and urges "all Arab states"--pointedly naming Egypt and
Saudi Arabia--"to declare their unqualified opposition to all forms
of terrorism, particularly suicide bombing."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration had sought changes in both resolutions,
with limited success. It endorsed neither.</TE>
<TE>   "The Congress has a right to speak out," White House Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of Thursday's votes was never in doubt from the moment
they were scheduled. Congress long has supported Israel with military
and economic aid; this year the assistance totals nearly $3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   One late change to the House resolution, in response to
administration concerns, included a statement encouraging an
international effort "to alleviate the humanitarian needs of the
Palestinian people." Another change eased criticism of Arafat,
deleting from the final version a phrase in an earlier draft that had
condemned him for "coordination of terror."</TE>
<TE>   But overall, the House resolution gave staunch support to the
Israeli government's drive to defend its citizens from Palestinian
bombings--comparing it to the U.S. military campaign launched after
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The people of Israel are resisting a wave of terrorism," DeLay
told the House. "And as we watch the violence directed against them,
we are roused to resolve that terrorism in all its forms must be
defeated. There is no moral equivalence between a democratic
government defending its citizens and a calculated strategy of death
waged by terrorist organizations."</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers offered only muted support of the resolution. House
Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), who voted for the
resolution, stressed in a short speech the humanitarian needs of the
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, 194 Republicans, 157 Democrats and one independent
voted for the resolution. Voting against it were 17 Democrats and
four Republicans, nearly twice as many negative votes as the 11
recorded when the House approved a pro-Israel resolution in December.
In addition, 29 lawmakers voted "present" as a way to lodge
protest--most of them Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   One Republican who voted for the December resolution but against
DeLay's resolution was Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of Huntington Beach. "We
must be scrupulously honest," he told the House on Thursday. "There
are piles of bodies in the Middle East, and many of the victims are
noncombatants." He blamed "both sides" for "the slaughter of
innocents."</TE>
<TE>   Other Californians who voted against the resolution were Reps.
Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres), Barbara Lee (D-Oakland), George Miller
(D-Martinez) and Pete Stark (D-Hayward).</TE>
<TE>   Those who voted present were Reps. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles),
Sam Farr (D-Carmel), Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena), Hilda L. Solis
(D-El Monte) and Lynn C. Woolsey (D-Petaluma). Reps. Calvin M. Dooley
(D-Visalia) and Juanita Millender-McDonald (D-Carson) did not vote.</TE>

from a story Friday about a Senate resolution supporting Israel.
Criticizing it as ill-timed, Sens. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) and Ernest F.

<HD>Senate Breaks Logjam on Court</HD>
<DH>Law: The first nomination in five years to the half-empty
6th Circuit Court is unanimously approved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday unanimously advanced U.S.
District Judge Julia Gibbons' nomination to the half-empty U.S. 6th
Circuit Court of Appeals, the first time a nomination has moved
forward for that court in five years.</LD>
<LD>   Only eight of 16 judgeships on the 6th Circuit in Cincinnati are
filled. Gibbons' nomination now goes to the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm glad Judge Gibbons was on the agenda today and I hope that
we'll have the chance to approve other judges for the 6th Circuit,"
said Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) after the 19-0 vote.</LD>
<TE>   Gibbons has been praised by both Republican and Democratic
legislators.</TE>
<TE>   She has been a federal judge in Memphis, Tenn., since she was
appointed in 1983 by President Reagan. And if confirmed by the
Senate, she would be the first judge appointed to the court serving
Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee and Michigan since Judge Ronald Lee Gilman
was confirmed in November 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate committee, said
the panel, while under Republican control, refused to move through
former President Bill Clinton's nominees for that circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Cassell, a nominee for a U.S. district judgeship in Utah, won
committee endorsement Thursday but four rare negative votes were cast
against him.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy and Democratic Sens. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts,
Richard Durbin of Illinois and Russ Feingold of Wisconsin voted
against Cassell.</TE>
<TE>   Cassell, a University of Utah law professor, persuaded the U.S.
Supreme Court to re-examine the Miranda warnings that police are
required to give suspects. He lost, however, in a 7-2 decision in
2000 with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist writing, "Miranda has
become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the
warnings have become part of our national culture."</TE>
<TE>   Cassell argued that a 1968 law loosened the restrictions imposed
by Miranda and allowed voluntary confessions to crimes to be admitted
as evidence, even if suspects aren't read their rights.</TE>
<TE>   In his confirmation hearing, Democratic senators questioned
whether he would be pro-prosecution in a criminal trial as a federal
judge.</TE>
<TE>   However, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) called Cassell "one of the most
qualified people ever nominated to the District Court bench."</TE>

rape and robbery that sent him to prison, but an old federal firearms
charge will keep him there a little longer.</LD>
<LD>   A judge in Memphis overturned Clark McMillan's conviction after
tests showed McMillan's DNA did not match that in semen left on the
teenage victim's clothes.</LD>
<TE>   McMillan, 45, was convicted of forcing two teens from their car in
1979, raping the girl and robbing her boyfriend. The girl identified
McMillan as the rapist, but he maintained his innocence.</TE>

<LD>   The state Senate rejected a House-passed bill to have Hawaii join
Oregon as the only states allowing physician-assisted suicides.</LD>
<LD>   The "death with dignity" measure supported by Gov. Ben Cayetano
was modeled after the Oregon law approved in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   The measure would have allowed competent, terminally ill adults to
obtain a lethal dose of prescription drugs from a doctor to end their
lives.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was approved April 7 by the House. The Senate voted, 11
to 14, to kill it.</TE>

<HD>Support Growing on Hill to Arm Commercial Pilots</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Giving flight crew guns is a 'necessary step,'
House member says. But administration and some lawmakers oppose the
effort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Momentum is building in Congress for a proposal to arm America's
commercial airline pilots to protect against terrorist hijackings,
even though Bush administration officials have opposed it.</LD>
<LD>   At a hearing Thursday before a House aviation panel, some members
of both houses endorsed legislation to let pilots have guns available
to foil takeovers.</LD>
<LD>   "Arming trained and qualified flight crew members is a necessary
step to ensure the safety and security of the flying public," said
Rep. John L. Mica (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Transportation
aviation subcommittee and sponsor of a bill to arm pilots.</LD>
<TE>   "Nothing else can provide the deterrence or effectiveness of a
weapon wielded by a highly trained individual."</TE>
<TE>   Four senators--Republicans Bob Smith of New Hampshire, Frank H.
Murkowski of Alaska and Conrad R. Burns of Montana and Democrat Zell
Miller of Georgia--are writing their own bill to arm pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Other lawmakers, however, said arming pilots would detract from
their main job.</TE>
<TE>   "Their primary duty is to see that the plane is flown and landed
safely," said Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta and Homeland Security
Director Tom Ridge have said they oppose arming pilots, but John
Magaw, undersecretary for Transportation Security, said a final
decision has not been made.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's let all the information come forward," Magaw said.</TE>
<TE>   Mineta has said that guns are not needed because cockpit doors
have been reinforced, preventing terrorists from commandeering
airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation officials also are reviewing whether to allow
nonlethal weapons, such as stun guns, in the cockpits. A study by the
National Institute of Justice found that such weapons could allow
flight crews to thwart a hijacking attempt.</TE>
<TE>   "These weapons have the potential to interrupt an attack, control
the aggressor or delay an attack while the flight crew safely lands
the plane," said Sarah Hart, director of the institute's Office of
Justice Programs. "However, substantial testing is required before
informed decisions can be made as to whether these weapons should be
deployed on commercial airlines."</TE>
<TE>   Pilots unions have been lobbying for guns in the cockpits, sending
a letter to President Bush and launching a petition drive that had
attracted more than 44,000 signatures through Wednesday, according to
the Web site of the Allied Pilots Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "Our pilots have requested the ability to defend themselves," Mica
said. "They are our last line of defense and should have at least a
fighting chance."</TE>

<HD>A Day of Prayer and Exultation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush chuckled Thursday as a minister marked the National
Day of Prayer by asking God for "unprecedented unity in Congress."</LD>
<LD>   At an event that had the air of a Christian revival, 200 people
said "Yes!" and "Amen!" through a series of prayers and songs in the
East Room of the White House.</LD>
<LD>   Thunder rumbled outside as Bush said, "A great people must spend
time on bended knee, in humility, searching for wisdom in the
presence of the Almighty."</LD>
<TE>   Bush stepped up his efforts after Sept. 11 to reach out to
non-Christian groups, and he has assigned White House aides to court
Jewish and Muslim voters. Yet the event was almost exclusively
Christian. Bush and his wife are Methodists.</TE>
<TE>   A choir sang the Christian anthem "Amazing Grace," an opera
soloist performed Mozart's "Exultate Jubilate," and two Christian
pastors offered prayers praising Bush for living his faith. It did
not appear there were non-Christian religious leaders there; the
White House said it did not have a list.</TE>
<TE>   "What a blessing you are to this nation, by your witness, by your
commitment," said Daniel Coughlin, the House chaplain.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, along with millions of Americans, we pray for nothing less
than a spiritual awakening in America and an unprecedented unity in
Congress," said Lloyd Ogilve, chaplain in the Senate, which Democrats
narrowly control and where several Bush proposals have stalled.
Bush's chortle could be heard above the laughter.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband and I find strength in the word of the Lord, and we
realize the power that prayer has in our own lives," Laura Bush said.
"I'm truly blessed to be married to a man who's strong enough to bear
the burdens and humble enough to ask God for help."</TE>
<TE>   Prayer, the president said, "sweeps away bitterness and heals old
wounds. Prayer leads to greater humility and a more grateful spirit.
It strengthens our commitment to things that last and things that
matter. It deepens our love for one another."</TE>

<HD>Priest Arrested in Abuse Scandal</HD>
<DH>Crime: Father Paul Shanley is accused of regularly abusing
a Massachusetts boy for seven years. Other victims are alleged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN and TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A Roman Catholic priest who has been the focus of some of the most
shocking disclosures in a nationwide sex scandal was arrested in San
Diego on Thursday on three counts of raping a child.</LD>
<LD>   Father Paul Shanley, 71, will be arraigned today on charges of
regularly abusing a Massachusetts boy over a seven-year
period--sometimes in the church confessional. He was arrested without
incident at his apartment in the Hillcrest section of San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   The victim, now 24, was not named in the complaint. He allegedly
was molested from 1983 to 1990, beginning when he was 6 years old and
a student in a weekly religious education doctrine class taught by
Shanley.</LD>
<TE>   Middlesex County Dist. Atty. Martha Coakley said Thursday that the
young man approached authorities earlier this week after extensive
media coverage of a civil lawsuit against the Boston archdiocese by
another alleged Shanley victim, 24-year-old Gregory Ford.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost on a weekly basis, Paul Shanley would come to take not
only [the latest alleged victim] but others from that class for
'talks,'" Coakley said.</TE>
<TE>   The priest allegedly took the young students, all male, either to
the rectory, the bathroom or the confessional.</TE>
<TE>   "That is where the abuse took place," Coakley said.</TE>
<TE>   The description echoes accounts offered by Ford, who also was a
religious education student while Shanley was pastor at St. Jean's
parish in Newton, Mass., outside Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Coakley said the priest told the victim that if he reported the
abuse, no one would believe him. "He was 6 years old and fond of
[Father] Shanley," the district attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   But coverage of the sex abuse trial and conviction in January of
former priest John J. Geoghan--also assigned to the Boston
archdiocese--brought a flood of painful memories to Ford and others
who claim they were abused by Shanley. Ford's civil suit forced the
archdiocese last month to release more than 1,600 pages of documents
about Shanley.</TE>
<TE>   The records contained sexual abuse complaints against Shanley
dating from 1967, when he allegedly took children to a cabin at Blue
Hill, a ski mountain near Boston. In 1977, according to the
documents, Shanley was present at the organizational meeting of what
later became the North American Man-Boy Love Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The flamboyant former "street priest" allegedly tried to blackmail
the late Cardinal Humberto Medeiros, the records indicate. When
Shanley was transferred to California in 1990, a bishop here sent a
letter to St. Ann's parish in San Bernardino praising Shanley as a
priest "in good standing."</TE>
<TE>   While in Southern California, Shanley co-owned a hotel in Palm
Springs that catered to gay clients.</TE>
<TE>   Shanley next went to New York to work at Leo House, a residential
rehabilitation facility for young people. He moved to San Diego in
the late 1990s and recently was dismissed from his volunteer job with
the San Diego Police Department. On his application for that
position, Shanley did not mention that he was a priest but listed his
occupation as "hotel director."</TE>
<TE>   Shanley's attorney in Boston, Frank Mondano, did not return a call
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego police spokesman David Cohen said Thursday that
detectives called Shanley from outside his gated apartment complex
and told him they had an arrest warrant. He invited them inside and
did not protest when placed in handcuffs, Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the U.S. marshal's office in San Diego said Shanley
apparently had been moving between his own apartment and a friend's
home in the Linda Vista neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   At the Santa Fe Villas apartment complex, neighbors described
Shanley as friendly and helpful but not forthcoming about his
background.</TE>
<TE>   None knew he is a priest. He is credited with saving a neighbor's
life by administering CPR when the man had a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very nice-looking and charismatic," apartment manager Mel
Lee said. "The majority of people who meet him like him right away. I
was very shocked at this. I don't believe any of it until it's
proven."</TE>
<TE>   Lee said Shanley introduced his male roommate, about 20 years
younger than Shanley, as "my caregiver."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Samuel Goldberg said: "He was a very courteous, affable
gentleman. I didn't know he was a priest. I didn't even know he was
from Boston."</TE>
<TE>   No criminal charges are pending against Shanley in San Diego,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   He is due to be arraigned this morning in San Diego Superior Court
on a fugitive warrant requesting his extradition to Boston. Shanley
is being held in isolation in county jail for his protection,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Coakley said that the investigation into Shanley is ongoing and
that other criminal charges are possible.</TE>
<TE>   Each child rape count against Shanley represents not a specific
incident but a type of molestation, Coakley said. In Massachusetts, a
charge of child rape can include forced oral sex or digital
penetration, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Each count carries a potential life sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecution was possible, the district attorney said, because the
alleged crimes took place within a 10-year statute of limitations
that begins when a victim turns 16 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Coakley said her office was prepared to handle a potential
onslaught of such cases if numerous alleged victims step forward.</TE>
<TE>   Shanley's name was on a list of more than 80 alleged pedophile
priests turned over by the archdiocese in the wake of the clerical
sexual abuse crisis, Coakley said.</TE>
<TE>   She said that her office had feared Shanley had fled the country,
until television reporters tracked him down in San Diego early this
week.</TE>
<TE>   "We were pretty relieved," Coakley said.</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday, Boston archdiocese spokeswoman Donna M. Morrissey
issued a brief statement expressing hope that Shanley's arrest "will
bring some level of relief and contribute to the healing of those who
have been sexually abused as children and teenagers, their families
and all who suffer at this horrific time."</TE>
<TE>   In Manchester, N.H., Bishop John B. McCormack--who was responsible
for supervising Shanley while in Boston--said Thursday that he wished
he had paid closer attention to signs of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Thursday, three lawsuits were filed in Oregon, claiming
sexual abuse by four Catholic priests; three priests suspected of
sexually abusing teenagers more than 20 years ago were suspended from
the Roman Catholic archdiocese in Rochester, N.Y; the diocese in
Joliet, Ill., agreed to comply with a judge's order seeking documents
containing allegations of sexual abuse of minors by priests; and in
Hazleton, Pa., a chaplain at a Roman Catholic high school was
suspended following a claim that he sexually abused a boy in 1998.</TE>

<HD>Virginia Governor Apologizes for Law That Forced
Sterilizations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RICHMOND, Va.</DL>
<LD>Gov. Mark R. Warner issued a formal apology Thursday for the state's
decision to forcibly sterilize thousands of Virginians from 1924 to
1979.</LD>
<LD>   His apology coincides with the 75th anniversary of the U.S.
Supreme Court's Buck v. Bell decision upholding Virginia's eugenics
sterilization law, which became a model for other states.</LD>
<LD>   Virginia forcibly sterilized about 7,450 people under the banner
of eugenics, or selective human breeding and social engineering.</LD>
<TE>   The practice continued until 1979. Last year, the General Assembly
passed a resolution expressing "profound regret" for the state's
role, but stopped short of issuing a formal apology.</TE>
<TE>   With the governor's statement Thursday, Virginia becomes the only
state of the 30 that conducted eugenics sterilizations to apologize.
There are believed to be more than 60,000 eugenics victims
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, I offer the commonwealth's sincere apology for Virginia's
participation in eugenics," Warner said.</TE>
<TE>   "As I have previously noted, the eugenics movement was a shameful
effort in which state government never should have been involved," he
said. "We must remember the commonwealth's past mistakes in order to
prevent them from recurring."</TE>
<TE>   The law targeted virtually any human shortcoming that was believed
to be hereditary, including mental illness, mental retardation,
epilepsy, alcoholism and criminal behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Even people deemed to be "ne'er-do-wells" were sometimes targeted.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday in Lynchburg, two state legislators presented a
commendation from the General Assembly to eugenics victim Raymond W.
Hudlow for his service as a decorated combat soldier in World War II.
Hudlow had been sterilized against his will at age 16 because he was
a runaway.</TE>

<HD>Patient Privacy Issues at Heart of Vaccine Safety Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Health: A congressman looking into autism might subpoena a
database that contains medical records.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An aggressive effort by Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.) to investigate
whether childhood vaccines can cause autism has set up a political
showdown over the medical privacy of 8 million HMO patients, more
than 6 million of them Californians.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists said Thursday that the public-private research
partnership set up to protect all Americans from deadly diseases and
bioterrorist attack could be undermined if Burton subpoenaed the
project's huge database.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) urged Burton in a letter
Thursday "to reverse course."</LD>
<TE>   But Burton made no such promise. "While I am not poised to issue a
subpoena at this time, I will not foreclose my right to do so at some
point if events warrant such action," he said in a response.</TE>
<TE>   Burton's letter criticized the vaccine project's methods. He said
he was waiting to see if the "research procedures" to be used in a
compromise offered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
would be acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC has said it could allow independent researchers to analyze
the project's data at the National Center for Health Statistics in a
way that would not violate patient confidentiality. The partnership
is called the Vaccine Safety Datalink Project.</TE>
<TE>   Burton, who has a grandchild with autism, has conducted numerous
hearings on vaccine safety as chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee. Vaccine safety researchers and government scientists said
Burton's continued involvement could have an "incredibly broad
impact" on public health.</TE>
<TE>   "These issues need to be resolved in the scientific arena, not the
political arena," said Dr. Neal Halsey, director of the Institute for
Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Burton first asked the CDC in November 2000 to turn over the
vaccine project's records.</TE>
<TE>   CDC officials refused, citing the strict privacy agreements it has
with eight large health-maintenance organizations and the HMOs'
confidentiality contracts with their members.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1991, the project has used the HMOs' computerized medical
records to watch for vaccine-related health problems and improve the
safety of the 12 vaccines, delivered in 20 shots, administered to
most American children by their second birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Large databases have always been needed for public health
research, "but with Sept. 11 and the threat of bioterrorism and the
need for vaccines [for] anthrax and smallpox, it's even more
critical," said Dr. Steven Black, co-director of the Kaiser
Permanente Vaccine Study Center in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Burton's campaign has set up "a lose-lose situation for the
country," said Dr. Robert Chen, chief of vaccine safety and
development activity for the CDC's National Immunization Program. If
the confidentiality of the patient records is breached, he said, HMOs
would no longer participate in the vaccine safety project and public
health would suffer.</TE>
<TE>   Burton first rejected the CDC's offer to set up an outside,
confidential process to allow independent researchers to analyze its
data.</TE>
<TE>   In February, almost a year after the private Institute of Medicine
found no link between autism and the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine,
Burton's committee drafted a subpoena for "all records collected" by
the CDC's vaccine safety project. The CDC and the National Institutes
of Health have begun their own studies to determine if the MMR
vaccine can sometimes cause autism, a severe and increasingly common
developmental disorder.</TE>
<TE>   While autism's cause is unknown, most scientists believe there is
a genetic basis for the disability, which afflicts about 1 million
American children and adults.</TE>

<HD>Arms Issue May Sink Army Chief</HD>
<DH>Military: Move to save endangered Crusader system angers
Rumsfeld. Secretary White's job appears to be at risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER and JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Army Secretary Thomas E. White's tenuous grip on his job appeared to
slip further Thursday after Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld
scolded Army leadership for going behind his back to Congress to save
an endangered weapon program.</LD>
<LD>   Rumsfeld said the Pentagon is looking into reports that Army
leaders lobbied lawmakers in recent days to salvage an arms system
that the Defense secretary and his top deputy are poised to scrap.</LD>
<LD>   In characteristic language, Rumsfeld said he would have "a minimum
of high regard" for such behavior, a swipe aimed at least in part at
White, who is fighting to save the Crusader artillery system from
budget cuts.</LD>
<TE>   And even as top lawmakers vowed to work with leaders in the
Pentagon to save the $11-billion program, Rumsfeld made it clear he
expects Army leaders to fall in line. A Defense secretary ought to
"be able to expect that the leadership and overwhelming majority [of
the Army] will in fact be supportive," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's comments cast further doubt on the job security of
White, already in some peril because of questions about ties to his
former employer, Enron Corp., and his recent use of military aircraft
for personal business.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as last week, White was taking credit for having
persuaded Rumsfeld to spare the Crusader system from cuts--a seeming
success that many interpreted as a sign that White's standing in the
Pentagon remained solid.</TE>
<TE>   White, a retired general, was unavailable for comment. An Army
spokesperson would say only that the secretary "is still firmly
committed to serving the Army."</TE>
<TE>   Several officials in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill said the
flare-up could bring White's troubles to the tipping point. "The
scuttlebutt has been for a long time that they are looking for a way
to get rid of White," said a congressional source familiar with
defense issues.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld has shown little patience for subordinates who voice
dissent on Capitol Hill. An assistant Army secretary, Mike Parker,
was fired in March after criticizing another budget proposal.</TE>
<TE>   But others suggested that the Crusader fight could boost White's
position by aligning him with influential members of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [White's job] is in less jeopardy because the support the
Crusader has had on the Hill in the last 24 hours would seem to
support Secretary White's position, not diminish it," said one senior
Pentagon official who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Among the key backers of the Crusader are Sen. Don Nickles and
Rep. J.C. Watts, both members of the GOP leadership and both from
Oklahoma, where Crusaders would be assembled and based at Ft. Sill.
Sen. James M. Inhofe, another Oklahoma Republican, is also fighting
to save the program.</TE>
<TE>   The latest tussle centers on a high-powered, self-propelled
howitzer that is slated to cost $475.2 million in the coming fiscal
year.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say that it is an outdated weapons platform and that the
money would be better spent on unmanned aircraft and other
next-generation systems. But backers say it provides three times the
firepower of current artillery and can't be replaced by air power.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz directed White to begin
drafting other spending plans "that would assume that Crusader was
canceled," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Caught off guard, members of Congress desperate to save the
program and, apparently, officials from the Army's legislative
affairs office, rallied to resist Rumsfeld's plans. Lawmakers
reportedly received faxed "talking points" from the Army saying that
cutting the Crusader would put soldiers at risk. And the House Armed
Services Committee late Wednesday included in a pending defense
authorization bill nonbinding language that calls for the
continuation of the Crusader.</TE>
<TE>   There have also been contacts between White and key lawmakers. A
spokesman for Watts said the congressman has had at least two
conversations with White in recent weeks, but he would not elaborate.
A spokesman for Inhofe said the senator had also spoken to White but
that it's "not true" White has lobbied members.</TE>
