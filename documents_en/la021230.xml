<HD>AIDS battle advances on 2 fronts</HD>
<DH>Gene therapy or experimental vaccine that 'hijack' the
immune system may be the next step in fighting HIV.</DH>

<LD>A cure for AIDS remains elusive, but with more than 42 million
infected people worldwide, the need for better treatments is
undeniable. Last week, researchers announced two promising, if early,
developments.</LD>
<LD>   One approach, developed at Caltech in Pasadena and at UCLA, uses
gene therapy to keep the AIDS virus from entering human
disease-fighting cells. The other approach, from French researchers,
uses a therapeutic vaccine to lower the amount of virus while
boosting the immune system.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Kenneth Mayer, a national authority on AIDS and director of
the Brown University AIDS Program in Providence, R.I., called both
approaches exciting for HIV therapy and, potentially, prevention.</LD>
<TE>   HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is a powerful and insidious foe
because it disrupts the immune system, Mayer said. The two
experimental techniques represent "attempts to hijack the immune
system in positive ways. Both have a long way to go, but neither one
is something that is currently being done."</TE>
<TE>   Both techniques might be used in combination with existing
antiviral drugs to eliminate HIV from the body or keep it at bay, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The gene therapy work was led by David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate
biologist and president of Caltech, who collaborated with Irvin S.Y.
Chen, director of the UCLA AIDS Institute. Using a technique they
compared to a Trojan horse, the researchers invaded T-cells (human
immune cells) with a harmless AIDS virus. The disabled virus then
unleashed a piece of synthetic genetic coding it had carried inside.
The genetic coding knocked out a receptor on the cell's surface,
essentially locking one door HIV uses to enter cells.</TE>
<TE>   Early results in a laboratory dish found the technique protected
more than 80% of T-cells from HIV infection, according to the
research published last week in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   In the French research, reported in the January issue of Nature
Medicine but made available online last week, lead researcher Wei Lu
of the Universite Rene Descartes in Paris and his colleagues created
a vaccine by treating immune cells in monkeys with an AIDS-like virus
altered so it couldn't reproduce. The researchers used dendritic
cells, a type of immune cells found in monkeys and humans. The cells
can migrate from mucus membranes, where HIV infections begin, into
lymph nodes.</TE>
<TE>   When 10 macaque monkeys were vaccinated with cultures of their
treated cells, then given four booster shots in eight weeks, virus
levels dropped in the blood of seven monkeys.</TE>
<TE>   Their viral levels stayed low over the next 34 weeks, the authors
wrote, but it remained unclear how long the effects will last. In the
remaining three monkeys, the virus started to increase after the
first immunization.</TE>
<TE>   "If the approach is confirmed in monkeys and successfully adapted
in humans, it may represent a major new therapeutic approach," Dr.
Bruce D. Walker, director of the Division of AIDS at Harvard Medical
School, said in an accompanying Nature Medicine commentary.</TE>
<TE>   The Caltech-UCLA work was supported by the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Damon Runyon-Walter Winchell
Fellowship. The French research was supported by the Institute for
Research Into Vaccines and AIDS and Cancer Immunotherapy.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Incredibly, I was actually losing ground.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, over the past year I'd been trying out various sports and
recreational activities for this column, but my 54-year-old body
still wasn't getting the kind of exercise it needed.</LD>
<LD>   Time that would have been spent on workouts in the old days had
gradually given way to hauling my teenagers all over Southern
California for baseball tournaments, track meets and band
competitions. They were in shape, but my paunch was expanding as the
pounds piled on.</LD>
<TE>   When I reached 190, at least 15 pounds heavier than my optimum
weight and perilously close to the dreaded 200-pound mark, I knew
radical action was needed. I decided to hire a personal trainer and
give myself two months to get back in shape.</TE>
<TE>   Just the thought of having a trainer had an elitist feel to it, as
if I were joining the posh crowd of big-time executives and movie
stars. But I hoped that being pushed by someone else would produce
results -- and the cost alone might prove an impetus to make the
time.</TE>
<TE>   As thousands of Angelenos already know, prices were all over the
map, but most ranged from $50 to $100 an hour. I found dozens of
personal training Web sites for the Los Angeles area, and any number
of organizations that certify personal trainers, some of them
offering relatively inexpensive quickie courses while others are more
expensive and demanding.</TE>
<TE>   I wanted to find someone close to my home in Arcadia, so I
narrowed my search to the strip of towns from Monrovia to Pasadena,
then started asking around about gyms and trainers.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, word of mouth found me my trainer. Very early in
the search, I stopped off at a health store in Monrovia to buy some
carbohydrate and protein supplements for my son, who has been trying
to add some pounds (ironically, given my situation) in anticipation
of freshman baseball tryouts.</TE>
<TE>   I struck up a conversation with the proprietor, who immediately
suggested a personal trainer named Eric Coleman. He coached the track
team at Monrovia High School, and he'd set up a gym a few blocks
over.</TE>
<TE>   I called and made an appointment for the next evening. When I
arrived, I introduced myself to Coleman, a heavily muscled man, who
told me that he was a member of the 15-year-old National Academy of
Sports Medicine and that for two months of training he would charge
me $35 an hour. A bargain. We agreed to three hourlong sessions a
week, starting on the following Monday morning, when he would give me
a fitness evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a pretty sight. During that first hour, Coleman put me
through a series of exercises, starting with the stationary bike and
ending with old-fashioned push-ups. Of the latter, I did a grand
total of seven. He also took a series of tape measurements, the most
demoralizing being the waist, which came in at 40 inches.</TE>
<TE>   But he seemed affable and competent and said he would put me on a
program in which we would start with simple exercises and move on to
weight training as soon as possible. We would eventually be doing
some of our workouts outside, he said, running hills and jumping rope
to build stamina and cardio fitness.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman also asked about my diet, and shook his head in amusement
when I told him I always skipped breakfast and ate only two meals a
day. He recommended as many as three to five small meals a day, with
the emphasis on a low-fat, low-carbohydrate diet.</TE>
<TE>   For the rest of the day after that first visit, I felt somewhat
queasy from the exertion, and the following day I shifted into the
sore mode. But my first real workout was on Wednesday, and little did
I know that the aches and pains of the previous two days would be
nothing compared with the rest of the week.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, for all his gentle demeanor, demands hard work. "Tuck in
skinny" is one of his favorite sayings he puts clients through their
paces. "The last set is the best set" is another favorite. On that
first real workout, we didn't touch a weight. Instead, he had me do a
brutal (to me anyway) set of 15 abdominal crunches, followed by knee
bends, stretching exercises and leg thrusts. By the time I got to the
office, my legs had begun to tighten up. But the following day was
worse, when simply climbing stairs was an act of courage.</TE>
<TE>   I limped into Coleman's gym on Friday and he immediately put me on
the stationary bike, keeping me pedaling for almost 15 minutes before
beginning upper-body weight training. Then I was back on the bike for
the rest of our session to further loosen the muscles.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of that first weekend, the pain in my legs was gone --
but I'd gained a pound and a half.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll worry about the scales later," said Coleman, explaining
that the first order of business was to build strength and stamina.
We also talked about his recommendation of a colonic cleansing, which
he said would result, among other things, in weight loss. I declined
on the grounds that I wanted to see how I'd do going the natural
route. And, frankly, I had absolutely no knowledge of the product he
was recommending, which made me more reluctant. I told him I would
have to do more research.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of two weeks, I had begun a regimen of light weight
training, as well as continued abdominal, chest and leg exercises.
Coleman was beginning to increase the number of repetitions for each
exercise as well as add weight. I could tell there was progress
because on Wednesday of the second week I did three sets of push-ups,
with 12 in each.</TE>
<TE>   "One more, one more," Coleman kept saying. And it helped.</TE>
<TE>   Six weeks to go. Stay tuned. And Arnold, watch your back.</TE>

<HD>New home test for diabetics</HD>
<DH>It allows patients to better track how well they are
controlling their glucose levels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many diabetics check their blood glucose levels several times a day,
but they've had to visit a doctor for a test to determine whether the
disease is under control. Now, they'll be able to buy that test
without a prescription for use at home.</LD>
<LD>   The test, approved for over-the-counter sale earlier this month,
measures glycated hemoglobin. The substance is produced when sugar
levels rise and interact with the hemoglobin in red blood cells.
Because red cells live 90 to 120 days, the so-called A1c test result
shows how well a patient has kept his or her blood sugar within the
target range over a few months.</LD>
<LD>   "The A1c is a very, very important measure of the control of the
blood glucose level," said Dr. Francine R. Kaufman, president of the
American Diabetes Assn. "For the most part, [the test] should be done
quarterly and linked to a health care visit."</LD>
<TE>   The FDA decision should benefit those among the nation's 17
million diabetics who aren't routinely being tested at a doctor's
office.</TE>
<TE>   People with Type 1 diabetes, especially children, tend to see
specialists who test them regularly, but those with Type 2 diabetes
often are treated by primary-care doctors who may be less likely to
order A1c tests, said Kaufman, head of pediatric endocrinology at
Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas
stops making the insulin necessary to metabolize sugar. In the more
common Type 2 diabetes, the body makes too little insulin and
responds poorly to the little it does make.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Anne Harmel, director of clinical diabetes programs at USC,
said a home test could help patients better monitor their disease and
push for better care. It also could benefit patients who have trouble
getting to the doctor, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Diabetics already do finger-stick blood tests using a small
glucose meter to measure their blood at that moment. The reading
helps them calculate how much insulin to use.</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman and Harmel warned that the home A1c test is no substitute
for a comprehensive medical visit. Besides checking blood sugar
levels, doctors use visits to check for such diabetic complications
as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, kidney problems, blindness
and slow-healing sores that sometimes lead to amputation.</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman said she feared that self-testing could deter patients
from seeing doctors, while encouraging health plans to shift more
responsibility onto patients.</TE>
<TE>   The A1c test, manufactured by Metrika Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif.,
has a suggested retail price of $24.95.</TE>

<HD>Resolve all you want, but fitness needs a real plan</HD>
<DH>Paired with specific goals, even a simple strategy can
carry good intentions through the new year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the new year dawns, strange things will happen in homes across
Southern California. Sweatpants and tennis shoes will suddenly
materialize, long-forgotten gym membership cards will appear out of
nowhere and cartons of eggnog will mysteriously disappear. With
motivation so strong it could power a jet, thousands of people will
embark on exercise regimens with the admirable intent of getting in
shape and dropping some weight. According to a recent poll by the
Marist Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., 39% of the
population will make New Year's resolutions this year, with many
(17%) vowing to lose weight. That's the good news.</LD>
<LD>   Coping with change</LD>
<LD>   The bad news is that the vast majority probably won't keep these
pledges past March. Success often remains elusive, experts say,
because of a few key matters: a lack of planning, unrealistic goals
and the simple fact that human beings aren't keen on change.</LD>
<TE>   "The idea of physical exercise is a change of habit, and it's not
welcomed," says Emanuel Maidenberg, a clinical psychologist with the
anxiety disorders program at UCLA. "It requires effort which, in most
cases, we are not too eager to apply. What makes it even more
difficult is the investment of hard work."</TE>
<TE>   But the hard work doesn't have to involve a two-hour stint of
no-pain-no-gain workouts every day for weeks. That's a self-defeating
strategy many people have until the demands of daily life -- family,
travel, work -- derail them. Planning an exercise regimen can ensure
greater long-term success.</TE>
<TE>   "People spend an inordinate amount of time planning a trip or a
wedding, but when it comes to getting in shape, people are unwilling
to plan," says Charles Stuart Platkin, author of "Breaking the
Pattern: The 5 Principles You Need to Remodel Your Life" (Red Mill
Press, 2001).</TE>
<TE>   That resurrects old patterns and habits that didn't work then and
won't work now: "If every year you join a gym but you hate going to
the gym, then maybe you need to come up with something else that
provides you with cardiovascular and strength training."</TE>
<TE>   Platkin, founder of the Nutricise weight-loss program, suggests
rediscovering some long-forgotten but favorite sport, such as
racquetball or swimming. If socializing is important, get a workout
buddy (preferably one with equal zeal), join a team or make friends
at the gym.</TE>
<TE>   If just the thought of setting up an exercise routine seems
daunting, break it into manageable steps, says Jerald Jellison, a
professor of psychology at UCLA. "If you're going to join a gym,
bring a checklist of things you want to know, such as the quality of
the instructors, the kinds of classes they offer, and when they're
open."</TE>
<TE>   Man versus machine</TE>
<TE>   Even fear of not knowing how to use a piece of equipment is enough
to keep some out of a health club, says Bess Marcus, director of the
Physical Activity Research Centers at Brown Medical School and the
Miriam Hospital in Providence, R.I. "A lot of YMCAs have classes on
how to use the machines," she says, "and that way you're in the same
boat with other people."</TE>
<TE>   Setting unachievable goals is one way to almost ensure dropping
out of a fitness program. Expecting to run a marathon by spring or
dropping 30 pounds in a month is unrealistic for most people.
Instead, focus on training for a 5- or 10-kilometer run before
tackling anything more. Also, replace amorphous objectives with
specific ones. Says Maidenberg, "What is the goal and how will you
know when you succeed?"</TE>
<TE>   He suggests tailoring the exercise to the purpose: "If you're very
overweight, then do a particular kind of exercise. Focus on what you
want to do and why you want to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Shafer, a personal trainer with the Sports Club/LA, says
he's heard clients proclaim, "I'm going to work out for two months
and get back to the way I was when I graduated high school."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, they're 42 years old now and sit at a desk all day. Their
whole lifestyle is different and it may not be realistic to lose two
pounds in two weeks. It may take a month."</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect quick results</TE>
<TE>   Often goals remain unattained because people focus only on their
ultimate objective, which doesn't come fast enough. Resolutions are
broken during the critical first few weeks of a new exercise program,
when the pounds haven't come off, abs haven't gone flat, and getting
up early and schlepping to the gym is still an excruciating chore.
Small victories are frequently ignored, but they shouldn't be.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you feel like you have more energy or can handle daily hassles
better?" says Marcus, coauthor of "Motivating People to Be Physically
Active" (Human Kinetics, 2003). "Do your clothes feel a little less
tight? Do you just feel less bad? Short-term benefits could be having
time for yourself to take a class, dance like you don't really get
to, socialize and laugh. The fitness part is almost secondary."</TE>
<TE>   Marcus and others advise keeping a diary of not just weight loss
or time spent exercising, but also notes about positive changes in
mood, sleep habits and overall health. "Write down if you did
something active for 10 minutes. Then try to get in two 10-minute
sessions. Feeling like you're making progress motivates all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Jellison recommends looking to friends or family for positive
feedback, "one or two people who are sincerely interested in the
details of your progress," to act as designated cheerleaders.</TE>
<TE>   There's also nothing wrong with a tangible incentive every now and
then -- as long as it's not a piece of cheesecake. "When you lose 5
pounds, buy yourself a CD or call a friend," Jellison says.</TE>
<TE>   Analyzing past successes, even ones not related to fitness, can be
inspirational, Marcus says. "I'll ask people to think about how they
changed some bad habit, or even how they managed to move their house
or reorganize their office.... That can be a template for other
things."</TE>
<TE>   A lapse isn't a relapse</TE>
<TE>   But breaking a resolution, whether by skipping three days of
exercise or eating a handful of cookies, can send good intentions
spiraling downward.</TE>
<TE>   Says Jellison: "A lapse is not a relapse. When you've done
something you think, 'I've failed, I might as well eat.' You even see
it in professional athletes, they get into a slump. It only means you
took too big a step, and building back confidence comes from the
results of small actions -- getting out of bed, putting on your gym
shoes. You can do this any time you hit an obstacle."</TE>
<TE>   Many times, says Marcus, lapses occur when "people could have
predicted a bad time," such as the holidays, a wedding or a report
due at work. "During that time, you can tell yourself you're not
going to be active, but plan how you will get back on track. If you
give yourself permission, then you didn't fail, and you can move on.
Having to be perfect all the time really haunts us."</TE>
<TE>   Similarities do exist among those who manage to maintain their
resolutions and achieve their goals, but the traits they share aren't
superhuman.</TE>
<TE>   "They try to approach this as another problem-solving task,"
Maidenberg says. "They think it through: 'If I want to lose weight,
what is it I need to achieve that goal?' "</TE>
<TE>   Those who "used strategies more," says Marcus, were also more
likely to succeed. "They had extra clothes in the car in case they
wanted to go to the gym, they made commitments, read more articles
and rewarded themselves."</TE>
<TE>   It helps to know that even the most motivated people have their
moments of couch potato-dom.</TE>
<TE>   "Trainers are no different from anyone else," Shafer says. When he
feels himself starting to slide, he trades work for play: "I ride my
bike, play volleyball, join some activities."</TE>
<TE>   "Just remember where you are today so you can make changes
tomorrow," he says. "Remember why you started in the first place."</TE>

helps you think more clearly and definitely improves the way you look
and feel.... But as exercise gets away from you, it gets easier not
to do it."</TE>
<TE>   His goal, in addition to dropping 45 pounds, is to run three
mornings in the workweek and once or twice on weekends. He'll start
at a slow pace and try for as much distance as he can. He'd also like
to run a marathon again within a year. However, job demands take
priority: "If I'm suited up to run and they need me, I have to go to
work," says McLachlan, who runs a Stanton-based cosmetics company.</TE>
<TE>   As for his diet, "There are definitely things I can eliminate,"
such as fast-food lunches. McLachlan also is determined to get off
his cholesterol medication. "I'm at the age when I have to make a
decision to do this," he says.</TE>

<TE>   Yvonne Crafter</TE>
<TE>   Age: 46</TE>
<TE>   Height: 5 feet, 7 inches</TE>
<TE>   Weight: 225 pounds</TE>
<TE>   Goal: To reduce body fat, now 47%, lose weight and get fit through
walking and strength training.</TE>
<TE>   Yvonne Crafter isn't happy that she weighs more than 200 pounds,
but her reasons for wanting to drop some weight are different from
what they were years ago. "I'm more concerned about health and not as
concerned about appearance as I used to be," says Crafter, a
client-service representative for a medical lab in Van Nuys. "It used
be that everything was about how I looked. But now I know more people
with health problems -- my sister has diabetes -- and I could develop
those problems."</TE>
<TE>   Her plan is to walk three to four days a week, eventually working
up to 45 minutes to an hour each time. Two days a week, she intends
to do weight training at a gym near her home. Crafter recalls how she
felt when she was consistent with her workouts: "I was very toned and
I really liked it."</TE>
<TE>   To get results, Crafter knows she must change her diet, which, she
admits, isn't the healthiest. She's also thinking of joining a
support group, "which will help with my motivation -- especially the
eating part. It's good to have another person to talk with and be
accountable to."</TE>

<TE>   Liana Neyer</TE>
<TE>   Age: 34</TE>
<TE>   Height: 5 feet, 8 inches</TE>
<TE>   Weight: 153 lbs.</TE>
<TE>   Goal: To trim waist, now 32.5 inches; lower body fat, now 34%; and
lose weight and tone her body via cardiovascular exercise and weight
training.</TE>
<TE>   Like many mothers, Liana Neyer's life revolves around the needs of
her 2-year-old son, which leaves little time for things like sleep,
reading -- and exercise.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I feel better when I exercise," she says, "but I've just
been making excuses for too long, that I don't have the time. But if
I really, really wanted to do something I could. I could do more than
I'm doing now."</TE>
<TE>   Neyer's weight gain since childbirth has been only 10 or 15
pounds. But it's the too-tight clothes and "the fact that I'm
starting to feel more flabby" that's got her concerned. She also
misses "the way you feel after a workout."</TE>
<TE>   Her at-home strategy will include riding a stationary bike for 20
minutes three times a week and strength training using dumbbells, and
plus sit-ups. She hopes to increase her time as she progresses.</TE>
<TE>   With diabetes in the family, Neyer is aware she might be
susceptible: "It's something that's always going to be in the back of
my mind," says Neyer, who lives in Torrance.</TE>

<HD>Virtual second opinions</HD>
<DH>Patients who want to consult another physician now have
online access to several prestigious hospitals. But many doctors
question diagnosing without an in-person exam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Costello</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After his doctor told him he had a brain tumor that would require a
10-hour surgery, Al Flesh wanted a second opinion. Surprisingly, he
never had to leave his house to get it.</LD>
<LD>   Researching his options on the Internet one night, Flesh found
that a top-tier hospital in Ohio was offering second opinions online,
even for patients with serious illnesses like his. The next day, he
typed up his medical history on the Cleveland Clinic's Web site, had
his recent medical records sent through the mail and paid the $730
bill on his credit card.</LD>
<LD>   Just two weeks later, a doctor e-mailed a diagnosis that confirmed
what his first physician said. Flesh is now having surgery next month
and doctors predict he will make a full recovery. "This has been a
rough experience," says the 53-year-old consumer electronics
executive from Fort Myers, Fla. Even if it came online, "being able
to get that second opinion made me feel a whole lot better."</LD>
<TE>   Several of the nation's best-known hospitals, including
Massachusetts General, Johns Hopkins University Hospital and the
Cleveland Clinic, have recently started offering patients second
opinions over the Internet for as little as $500. Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center in Los Angeles is planning to launch a similar service
for neurology patients sometime next year.</TE>
<TE>   Although several Web sites and one-shop docs are already providing
medicine via cyberspace, the fact that such well-known hospitals are
entering the controversial dot-com medicine business is surprising.
After all, there are limits to what can be done over a keyboard and
many doctors remain extremely skeptical about how well a physician
can diagnose a patient he or she has never seen -- whether for a
second opinion or not.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the hospitals report that up to 80% of their initial
inquiries are coming from cancer patients or those with other major
illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. David Goldstein, co-director of the University of Southern
California's Pacific Center for Health Policy and Ethics, says many
doctors like him worry that online physicians can miss critical
information they might catch otherwise. They may also be unable to
adequately convey complex medical information in writing. And is
there really such a thing as a virtual bedside manner?</TE>
<TE>   The American Medical Assn. says it recommends against doctors
treating patients online whom they have not first seen. Last month,
the eRisk Working Group on Healthcare, an online health-care advisory
group consisting of state medical boards and medical malpractice
insurers, also recommended against the practice.</TE>
<TE>   "[Diagnosing online] is dangerous," says Goldstein. "This is not
what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Just a few years ago, online medicine looked like health care's
next big thing. While some patients and doctors remain skeptical, the
endorsement by world-class medical institutions is convincing more
patients to give the idea a try. Still, some patients remain
reluctant to replace a physical examination and a doctor visit with
the Internet. And doctors have their own qualms. Many are concerned
about liability (e-mails are physical records, of course) and the
ethical implications of treating patients without personally
examining them are murky under these circumstances. Another big
hurdle? Every state requires doctors to be licensed in the state in
which they provide services. For that reason, Johns Hopkins provides
online consultations only to international patients, although it says
it is researching how to enter the domestic market.</TE>
<TE>   The hospitals offering virtual second opinions say the practice is
safe and don't have many of the problems of initial consultations
online. After all, another doctor first sees the patient in person.
And this way, those who are too sick or can't afford to travel to a
major research center have access to some of the best doctors in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Some patients who rely on a local community hospital often want
the reassurance of a larger medical center where doctors deal more
frequently with complex cases. They may believe that a major center
is less prone to make a misdiagnosis. A 1999 study of cancer patients
nationwide by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that 1.4%
of pathology results -- or 30,000 patients--were misdiagnosed
annually. And 20% of the recommended treatments for cancer patients
were also incorrect, the study found.</TE>
<TE>   One recent survey found that two-thirds of people would be
interested in online second opinions if they were easy and
affordable. An estimated 5,000 patients around the country have
signed up for online second opinions through these few hospitals just
this year. Some smaller and older second opinion companies not
affiliated with hospitals, such as MDExpert.com and
FindCancerExperts.com, report their numbers are rising too.</TE>
<TE>   Most e-second opinion programs work the same way. All patients
must first be examined by another doctor. They then fill out an
extensive medical history questionnaire online and later have their
primary doctor send their medical records, such as CAT scans, X-rays
and lab tests, through the mail.</TE>
<TE>   Some hospitals send the opinions directly to the primary doctor so
the doctor can discuss it with the patient. Most services cost from
$500 to $1,000 and are not covered by insurance.</TE>
<TE>   But what happens when your second doctor disagrees with the first?
Dr. Joseph Kvedar, director of telemedicine for Partners Healthcare,
which oversees Massachusetts General's online program, says that
happens up to 30% of the time. In such cases, patients are usually
asked to visit the medical center in person for an exam.</TE>
<TE>   While the services available today primarily use e-mail, hospitals
say they are trying to improve technical capabilities so they can
both send and receive the medical information better. Some hope to
have video-conferencing next year, while others are counting on new
remote real-time diagnostic technology that will allow doctors to
scan and diagnose patients without being in the room. "This is only
the very beginning," says Kvedar.</TE>

<HD>MS drug may slow progress of disease</HD>
<DH>A new round of research will be crucial to defining
Antegren's true potential.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>Almost 10 years ago, people with multiple sclerosis were heartened by
the approval of the first medication to slow progression of the
disease. Since then, four more prescription drugs have reached the
marketplace. But the best may be yet to come.</LD>
<LD>   The new drug, Antegren, which works differently than existing
treatments, also may be more effective. Over the next two years, it
will be tested in two studies involving more than 2,000 patients.</LD>
<LD>   "None of the agents approved by the FDA seem to have effects this
prominent -- and prominent in a relatively short time," said Dr. J.
Theodore Phillips, a Dallas neurologist who is helping conduct the
studies.</LD>
<TE>   Multiple sclerosis affects the nerves of the eyes, brain and
spinal cord, causing the nerves to lose patches of myelin, the
protective sheath that allows electrical impulses to be carried along
nerve fibers. When myelin is destroyed, scar tissue called plaques
forms. These lesions can appear in multiple places within the central
nervous system and cause blurred vision, numbness, jerkiness of
limbs, loss of balance and fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   Research over the last 15 years has revealed that myelin is
destroyed when certain white cells (cells that attack infection) gain
access to the brain and spinal cord. Once within that tissue, these
white cells cause inflammation that eventually leaves the scar
tissue, Phillips said.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the key steps in the development of multiple sclerosis is
the entrance into the brain or spinal cord of these problematic white
blood cells," he said. "Antegren blocks that important, fundamental
step of crossing that blood-brain barrier."</TE>
<TE>   Antegren, which is being developed by Elan Corp. and Biogen Inc.,
is not a cure for multiple sclerosis. Like existing medications, it
only slows progression of the disease. But an earlier study of 213
people boosted hopes for Antegren's effectiveness. In that study,
Antegren reduced the number of new lesions by 85% to 95% (detected by
magnetic resonance imaging) and relapses by 45% to 75%. Antegren is
given in monthly infusions; most study subjects improved after the
first infusion.</TE>
<TE>   Existing therapies, which aim to calm the inflammation in the
nerves, typically improve relapse rates by about 30%, said Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Antegren appears safe, with side effects limited to mild
allergic reactions, skin rashes and fever. But the new round of
research will be crucial to defining the drug's true potential and
whether its side effects are minimal, said Dr. Stephen Reingold, vice
president of research programs for the National Multiple Sclerosis
Society.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a whole new mode of action, and that's a good thing,"
Reingold said. But, he added, "the [previous] study was very short,
six months, and a small study. Obviously, you can't say for sure how
well it will work."</TE>

<TE>   MS at a glance</TE>
<TE>   It affects about 400,000 Americans.</TE>
<TE>   It affects twice as many women as men.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, onset occurs between the ages of 20 and 50.</TE>
<TE>   It occurs more in people of Northern European ancestry, but other
ethnicities are not immune.</TE>
<TE>   Symptoms vary greatly among individuals. There are four types of
MS, which are diagnosed based on the frequency and severity of
symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   It is not fatal. Two-thirds of people with the disorder are able
to walk, although many need aid.</TE>
<TE>   Its cause is unknown.</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to diagnose because symptoms can come and go.
There is no single test to prove or rule out MS. Magnetic resonance
imaging can help produce a diagnosis by showing the presence of
plaques.</TE>

<HD>A cycling caution</HD>
<DH>Two recent studies rekindle the debate over how risky the
sport is -- particularly mountain biking -- to a man's reproductive
health.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For male bicyclists, the road to fatherhood may have just hit a few
more bumps.</LD>
<LD>   Two studies in as many months add to recent evidence that
bicycling can be hazardous to a man's reproductive health --
especially for dedicated mountain bikers. One, released a few weeks
ago, found that frequent mountain bike riding can lower sperm counts,
damage the scrotum and possibly reduce fertility. The other,
published in November, showed that even less strenuous cycling can
cause genital numbness and interfere with erectile function.</LD>
<LD>   Studies suggesting a troubling link between cycling and
procreation have been steadily surfacing since a prominent urologist
asserted five years ago that bicycling has caused at least 100,000
men to become impotent, and the latest research is sure to add to
debate among cyclists and physicians.</LD>
<TE>   "Biking overall is a great sport," said Dr. Ferdinand Frauscher,
who presented the most recent findings at a conference of the
Radiological Society of North America. "It's excellent exercise for
the cardiovascular system, but like other sports -- like skiing and
running -- it carries a certain set of risks."</TE>
<TE>   But not even the latest findings, serious though they are,
probably will knock the millions of cycling men off their bikes. Not
only are doctors reluctant to discourage the activity, particularly
when done in moderation, the cycling industry has developed new
designs that can mitigate whatever potential harm may exist.</TE>
<TE>   Frauscher's study compared 40 mountain bikers with 35 non-cyclists
over one year and found that 90% of the cyclists who rode more than
3,000 miles a year produced one-third the sperm and had much lower
sperm motility and volume compared with non-cyclists. The cyclists,
too, were almost four times as likely to exhibit scrotum
abnormalities, including cysts, calcifications and varicose veins.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the microtrauma from shocks and vibrations are the
major reason for the resulting testicular vascular damage," said
Frauscher, a uroradiologist at University Hospital in Innsbruck,
Austria.</TE>
<TE>   The other study, published last month in the Journal of Andrology,
followed a group of 17 bicycle police in Long Beach and found that
they had erections for less time during sleep compared with
non-riders. The study was done by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health.</TE>
<TE>   Both studies cited the bicycle seat, or saddle as bikers refer to
it, as the chief culprit. The more time on the bike, the more likely
there would be a problem. The saddle's nose often puts extra pressure
on the perineum, the area behind the scrotum, where nerves and
arteries run to the genitals.</TE>
<TE>   Many bicyclists -- backed by some physicians -- say the recent
studies overstate the risks. They point to countries such as China,
where a vast majority of men bicycle and don't experience
above-normal rates of infertility or sexual dysfunction. Also, they
say, fertility difficulties pale in comparison to the well-known
risks of remaining sedentary, a practice that contributes to obesity,
diabetes and heart ailments.</TE>
<TE>   But even the most enthusiastic cyclists concede the saddle can be
a real pain. Cyclists say the key to finding a good one is trial and
error and learning to make small angle adjustments.</TE>
<TE>   "The saddle is the worst part of the bike, always has been, always
will be," said Jim Hasenauer, a board member of the International
Mountain Bicycling Assn. and a Woodland Hills resident. "I know guys
whose garages are full of saddles. It can be like trying to find the
holy grail."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, bicycle manufacturers have created dozens of new
ergonomically designed saddles, which more evenly distribute a
rider's weight, promising comfort and alleviating pressure on the
perineum.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the seats, which offer more padding or feature a
triangle-shaped wedge cut out of its middle, have received positive
reviews. In the case of mountain biking, doctors say the seats --
when combined with a full suspension system -- can go a long way in
warding off any potential fertility problems. Full suspension systems
function like shock absorbers on a car and create a smoother ride.</TE>
<TE>   But there are a couple of reasons some bikers balk at the
improvements. The first is cost. The new generation of saddles can
run $45 to $100, while full suspension can add as much as $150 to
$600 to the overall price. Also, saddles tend to be heavy and would
add burdensome extra weight to the bicycle.</TE>
<TE>   If the precautions are taken, however, there's no reason to
abandon cycling for fear of not being a father, said Frauscher,
himself a mountain biker.</TE>

<HD>Banking on your own blood</HD>
<DH>In light of the FDA's concerns about the Red Cross supply,
some patients may opt for 'auto' donations.</DH>

<LD>After federal officials chastised the American Red Cross earlier this
month for not doing enough to keep the blood supply safe, blood
experts took great pains to emphasize that the risk of contamination
is, in fact, smaller than ever.</LD>
<LD>   Newer, more sensitive tests can now detect viruses such as
hepatitis and HIV with greater accuracy, said George J. Nemo, a
transfusion expert at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in
Bethesda, Md.</LD>
<LD>   But it's possible to reduce the risk further. Patients who are
scheduled for an elective operation can donate their own blood in
advance.</LD>
<TE>   Less than 5% of patients who need elective surgery donate their
own blood, a process known as autologous blood donation, according to
the American Assn. of Blood Banks. Because no two people have
identical blood, an "auto" donation eliminates the possibility of
having an allergic reaction from a transfusion and avoids infection
from HIV or hepatitis.</TE>
<TE>   People should discuss the option with their doctor, who can
determine if their surgery requires a transfusion and how many units
are needed.</TE>
<TE>   The physician then must submit a prescription requesting an
autologous transfusion to the hospital's blood bank or the local Red
Cross, depending on where the collection will be done.</TE>
<TE>   Some diabetics and people who suffer from anemia, severe heart
conditions, respiratory conditions or bacterial infections are not
good candidates for the procedure. "We want to be sure we're not
harming the patient by taking blood," said Dr. James Louie, executive
director of Long Island Blood Services in Westbury, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Making an autologous donation is no different from making an
ordinary blood donation. But because blood can't be stored more than
42 days, donations shouldn't be scheduled more than five weeks before
surgery. If more than one unit is needed, donations must be made
seven days apart and no closer than seven days before surgery.
Normally, up to three units can be donated before surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Since these units of blood require special handling, blood banks
and hospitals usually charge fees of $70 to $100 per unit. "The blood
center and the hospital has to create a special tracking system for
the blood," Louie said. Some insurance companies will cover the added
costs, but others don't. So check this out beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   With the Food and Drug Administration's report on safety problems
at the Red Cross fresh in patients' minds, more people may opt to
donate their blood ahead of time. Blood banks across the nation have
reported an increase in calls from people worried about the blood
supply.</TE>
<TE>   But experts caution that even autologous blood transfusions are
not risk free. The blood could be mislabeled, so you might get the
wrong batch, or it could be infected during the collection process.</TE>
<TE>   "These are very rare events," said Dr. Charles D. Bolan, a
scientist in the National Institute of Health's blood bank in
Bethesda, Md. "It's like landing an airplane: It's very safe, but
there's always a chance something could go wrong."</TE>

<HD>The shiny new pills, and the tried-and-true</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Marc Siegel</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An arthritis sufferer for many years, Mr. B had tried one
anti-inflammatory medicine after another. It was his habit to request
whichever pill had been most recently touted in television ads
promising miracles. But his hips ached no matter what drug I
prescribed, and I shared his frustration during his subsequent office
visits.</LD>
<LD>   He was not alone in falling for the commercials. Recent studies
show direct-to-consumer advertising as 16% of drug company spending,
and surveys by the Food and Drug Administration and the Kaiser Family
Foundation suggest that more than 50 million people respond to this
aggressive salesmanship by making requests of their doctors for these
same medicines.</LD>
<LD>   "The expensive new pills don't work any better than the cheap old
pills," Mr. B concluded during one of his worst days, when his hips
could interpret the humidity as well as any weather forecaster
portending rain.</LD>
<TE>   I looked unhappily across my office desk. Sometimes the patients I
was the most concerned about were the ones I could help the least.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the drug salespeople brought free lunches as well as
flashy product samples to my office, trying to entice me and my
patients with the latest and greatest. It was tempting to believe
that the new pill would work -- we both wanted it to. It was easy to
forget last year's pill, which was probably just as good and, having
gone generic, a whole lot cheaper. But Mr. B was growing more and
more cynical, not believing any pill could help his hip pain. On the
rare day when his symptoms eased and he felt well, he would claim
that medications had nothing to do with it.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. B would not consider hip surgery -- he was afraid of
complications -- though he finally did agree to see an arthritis
specialist. This doctor prescribed a yellow pill, the latest
once-a-day medicine that was supposed to be easier on the stomach
than other drugs. Taking it for a two-week trial, Mr. B reported that
his stomach was fine, but he still limped noticeably. At his request,
I sent him to a second arthritis expert, who switched him to a green
pill, which didn't work even as well as the yellow one. The second
arthritis expert recommended surgery, but Mr. B still refused it.</TE>
<TE>   During a phone conversation, this doctor told me he felt that
there was no cure-all for hip arthritis and that the billion-dollar
arthritis drugs were almost interchangeable. "Pharmacies should be
stocking, at most, one of these pills, not both," he said testily.</TE>
<TE>   In my office, the yellow pill competed with the green one for
space in my sample closet. Both manufacturers clearly thought that I
would end up prescribing the drug. All the drug salespeople seemed to
know how much of their product I prescribed. They brought clumps of
samples for various conditions all at once, probably believing if I
gave out their green pill for arthritis, I would also start
prescribing their red pill for sinus infections.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it was the red pill that had caught Mr. B's attention the
time he came to my office just before a trip out of town. Besides his
arthritis, he also suffered from sinus infections, a second condition
I was having trouble treating. He asked me if he could have some of
the red pills just in case he got sick on the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," I said, happy to offer help. I'd always wondered why Mr. B
continued to come to see me when I couldn't solve his hip problem.
He'd once said, "No one can help my hip, but at least you won't give
up."</TE>
<TE>   When he called me from out of town with a sinus infection, I told
him to take the red antibiotic. Two days later he called back to say
he was feeling better, not only in terms of his sinuses, but also his
hips. Why?</TE>
<TE>   "Are you taking the yellow arthritis pill or the green?" I said
excitedly.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither one."</TE>
<TE>   "And your hips are better?"</TE>
<TE>   Considering the hype about the new red antibiotic, I wasn't
surprised that his sinuses were better, but I couldn't understand the
improvement in his hips.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you taking besides the red pill?"</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing. Just an aspirin every four or five hours, for the cold."</TE>
<TE>   "Aspirin? That must be what's helping your hips!"</TE>
<TE>   From that moment on, Mr. B would have nothing to do with any of
the fancy pills that modern medicine or its sales representatives
could offer him.</TE>
<TE>   Cured of his penchant for the ads, he insisted on taking only
aspirin for his hips. He was surprised to find out how cheap aspirin
was and how well it could work.</TE>
<TE>   And I was a better doctor for it as well, returning aspirin to a
regular place in my doctor's bag. I told this story to the two
arthritis experts I'd referred Mr. B to, and they both admitted that
aspirin was a forgotten pill for arthritis that still had value for
some people. I regretted not having thought of it sooner. I relearned
an old lesson: Sometimes the old-fashioned remedy works better than
the latest discovery.</TE>
<TE>   As far as Mr. B's sinuses were concerned, I felt here was at least
one clear instance where a new chemical invention had helped me to
cure. But my patient differed. He didn't believe that his sinuses had
cleared that night in his hotel from any state-of-the-art
sports-car-red antibiotic but from the chicken soup and hot tea the
bellhop had brought up to his room.</TE>

<LD>You can get an overall workout for your upper body without having to
use weights or machines by doing sets of push-ups. Because they use
your own body's weight as resistance, they are a perfect exercise to
do anywhere, any time.</LD>
<LD>   1 Begin by lying face down with your hands just outside your
shoulders, fingers pointing forward, elbows bent. Inhale. On the
exhale, push up to a lifted plank position. Tighten your abdominals,
keeping your body in a straight line. Squeeze your chest and arm
muscles; don't let your elbows "lock out" or collapse into your
shoulders. Keep your shoulders pressed away from your ears.</LD>
<LD>   2 Inhale and slowly lower your body. Feel your arm and chest
muscles tensing as you descend. Start with a set of 10 repetitions
and aim to do two sets as you get stronger.</LD>

<HD>An alternative to skiing and snowboarding</HD>

<LD>When snowboarding came on the scene, it was touted as an alternative
to skiing, eventually becoming so popular it was introduced as an
Olympic sport in 1998. Now there's an alternative to skiing and
snowboarding, via a contraption that looks like a cross between a
bicycle and skis.</LD>
<LD>   Snowbike: Made by the Austrian-based company Brenter Original
Snowbike, it looks like a squat bike with a seat, handlebars and skis
instead of wheels. Riders also wear miniature skis on their boots,
which helps with steering and stopping. Roger Hollenbeck, a company
spokesman, riders sit with knees tight against the seat, arms
straight and elbows locked. Stops are made by turning sideways, as
with skis.</LD>
<LD>   Fitness: According to Hollenbeck, Snowbikes provide a pretty good
workout: "You have to grab the seat with your knees, and use your
shoulders, arms and stomach muscles as well."</LD>
<TE>   Bob Hamilton, a spokesman for the Northstar at Tahoe ski resort,
which rents Snowbikes, says that riding the bikes requires balance
and strength. "It's really like an isometric exercise. You're using
pretty much everything."</TE>
<TE>   Where to go: Snowbikes are available for rent at many ski resorts,
as well as for sale. They cost between $699 and $1,995. For
information, go to www.snowbike.com.</TE>

<HD>Touchy teeth linked to other sensitivities</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dianne Partie Lange</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having extremely sensitive teeth can make eating ice cream and
thorough toothbrushing a challenge. It also could be linked to
heightened senses of hearing, smell or sight, a new study suggests.</LD>
<LD>   Norman C. Bitter, author of the study, suspected that such
sensitivities might be linked, so he asked 92 patients to rate their
various sense perceptions. The 45 patients who had touchy teeth
turned out to also be sensitive to sunlight. They all needed to wear
sunglasses outdoors, compared with only eight of the 47 people who
didn't have especially sensitive teeth. Most in the hypersensitive
group also rated themselves as very sensitive to sound, spices in
food, smells and pain.</LD>
<LD>   Although the mechanics of the various senses differ, Bitter
believes that the common denominator is the fact that all nerves
supplying the special sensory organs and the teeth arise from the
same area of the developing embryo. The variations among people, he
says, could be genetically determined.</LD>
<TE>   Although more research is needed to confirm the sensitivity link,
people who tend to avoid perfume, bright lights or itchy clothing
could let their dentist know so proper precautions can be taken
before treatment starts. "They may want to use a desensitizing
toothpaste too," says Bitter, formerly associate professor of
clinical dentistry at USC School of Dentistry and now in private
practice in Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   The study was published in the November/December issue of the
journal General Dentistry.</TE>

<TE>   Many parents unaware young kids are carrying too heavy a load</TE>
<TE>   Despite a barrage of publicity about back injuries caused by heavy
backpacks, most parents don't know how much their young child's
backpack weighs, a survey has found.</TE>
<TE>   The study focused on more than 700 younger students, from
kindergarten to fifth grade, at three central Texas schools.
Researchers weighed all the children's packs and asked the 188
students who were hauling more than 10% of their body weight if their
parents had ever checked their loads. Only seven parents had weighed
their children's packs; two-thirds hadn't looked to see what was in
them. Children whose parents had never checked their backpacks were
most likely to be carrying the heaviest loads.</TE>
<TE>   On average, the children with heavy packs were carrying about 14%
of their body weight in textbooks, sports gear, lunch and personal
items. "That's about the point where kids begin to complain of pain,"
says Bryan Lane, the lead author of the study and a family physician
at the Scott &amp; White Clinic in Temple, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The study appears in the December issue of the Archives of Disease
in Childhood.</TE>

<TE>   Massaging babies may help improve sleep patterns</TE>
<TE>   Gently massaging babies' heads and backs for 30 minutes at bedtime
not only relaxes them, it may help their developing body clocks get
in sync with their moms' sooner, new research suggests.</TE>
<TE>   The study, done at Tel Aviv University and the University of Haifa
in Israel, is the first time researchers have documented how massage
affects production of the sleep-regulating hormone, melatonin, in
infants. Twenty-one mothers volunteered for the intricate research
project, in which the babies' urine was collected periodically around
the clock. Half of the mothers gave the newborns a bedtime massage
for 14 evenings starting when they were 2 weeks old, and half handled
their babies in the usual way.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the massaged infants were 8 weeks old, their activity
patterns more closely resembled their mothers'. They were most active
early in the morning, between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m.; the infants in the
control group were most active between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. At 3 months
old, those babies massaged early in life produced more melatonin
during the night than babies who weren't massaged.</TE>
<TE>   The study appears in the December issue of the Journal of
Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics.</TE>

<HD>Do the cardio, but avoid routine</HD>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the gym I always hear that I need to do "cardio." Other than for
weight loss, what do I need this type of exercise for?</LD>
<LD>   "Cardio" is short for cardiovascular exercise, and it's crucial
for a healthy heart, lungs and vascular system. Cardio activities
include walking, running, rowing, cycling, swimming and dancing.</LD>
<LD>   You should keep the workout going for 20 to 30 minutes or longer.
But if you can't, do what you can and gradually build up to 20
minutes. Cardio exercise should optimally be done four to five days a
week.</LD>
<TE>   It's best to build variety into your exercise routine to keep
things interesting, fun and challenging and to minimize the risk of
overuse injuries.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a runner and newly pregnant. Did you continue to run during
your pregnancy?</TE>
<TE>   Women who have an exercise routine are usually advised to maintain
it -- at a reduced intensity -- during their pregnancy. Last year,
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said that
pregnant women who already have an exercise routine should continue
to engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate exercise several days a
week.</TE>
<TE>   But there are cautions. The main one is not to start a vigorous
exercise program if you haven't already been active. Also, pregnant
women shouldn't scuba dive, because the baby is at risk for
decompression sickness. And some sports carry a risk of abdominal
injury, such as ice hockey, kick boxing, soccer, skiing and horseback
riding.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, running doesn't usually come with such risks. During my
first trimester, I was lucky not to have morning sickness too badly,
so I continued my running, usually for one hour four days a week
(about five miles) and followed up with stretching. Because it was
summer, I ran inside on a "soft" treadmill in a well-ventilated room
to avoid overheating. I continued to run in my second trimester,
albeit at a slower pace to keep my heart rate at the recommended 140
beats per minute. I also modified my duration and intensity. Remember
that when you're pregnant, your balance may be off a bit, so wear
stable shoes and be careful to avoid any balance hazards. By my
seventh month, I really felt too big to run, so I switched to the
stationary recumbent bike and walking.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, individual needs vary, so consult with your
obstetrician-gynecologist before continuing or beginning any exercise
program during your pregnancy.</TE>

<LD>Diuretics -- A story last week on nonprescription diuretic therapies
for hypertension contained two errors in the listings of prescription
diuretics. In the listing of thiazides, a class of diuretic, the
story incorrectly named Dyazide as a brand name for
hydrochlorothiazide. Dyazide is actually a more complex medication
that contains two diurectics: hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene.
Also, the loop diuretic known commercially as Lasix is not fursemide,
as the story stated, but furosemide.</LD>

<HD>Feel-good kava has a down side</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shari Roan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kava, an herb from the South Pacific islands, has long been used to
create a sense of relaxation and well-being. But cases of adverse
side effects associated with the use of kava supplements are
mounting.</LD>
<LD>   Uses: The root from the kava plant historically has been used as a
social drug. As a supplement, it's touted as a mild natural
tranquilizer that can relieve anxiety and stress. It's sometimes used
to treat insomnia.</LD>
<LD>   Dose: Usually 300 milligrams per day.</LD>
<TE>   Precautions: Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention issued a report on two cases of liver failure in the U.S.
linked to kava supplements, including one in a 14-year-old girl who
needed a liver transplant. The herb can be toxic to the liver,
especially among people with liver disease or who take drugs that
affect the liver. Kava in very high doses can cause mental
impairment. It should not be combined with alcohol or sedating drugs
because the herb can intensify the effect. Some people are allergic
to kava.</TE>
<TE>   Research: Even with its potential risks, interest in kava as a
medicine remains high. Researchers are exploring whether low doses
could be an acceptable replacement for prescription drugs for the
short-term treatment of anxiety and stress-related insomnia.</TE>
<TE>   Dietary supplement makers are not required by the U.S. government
to demonstrate that their products are safe or effective. Ask your
health-care provider for advice on selecting a brand.</TE>

<KH>New York, N.Y./ GERALDINE BAUM</KH>
<HD>With time, the frenzy over firemen has cooled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This season New York firefighters are back to spending the holidays
with one another, back to the brotherhood and neighborhoods that have
always sustained them. It seems the sisterhood -- or at least the
women who "discovered" firemen after Sept. 11 -- is a little fickle.
The cult of the hunk fireman is mostly over.</LD>
<LD>   Consider: For the second year in a row, a celebrity (please, no
names) invited his Upper East Side firehouse (along with stars Meg
Ryan and Regis Philbin) to his annual Christmas bash. Last year these
firemen were the honored guests. This year guests were complaining
that the firemen were drunk and pulling girls onto their laps.</LD>
<LD>   In the weeks after Sept. 11, 2001, it seemed that every woman in
New York wanted to throw her arms around a firefighter. Marisa Tomei
told David Letterman she was dying to have a romance with one.
Jennifer Aniston, Britney Spears, Sarah Jessica Parker, Gwyneth
Paltrow and others popped by Ladder No. 5 in Greenwich Village to
show their appreciation. Which meant hugs all around. And group
photos.</LD>
<TE>   At another firehouse across town, women in skimpy tops and tight
jeans stopped by regularly with all the fixings for Friday night
supper. One brought her guitar to a firehouse near Madison Square
Garden and spent the next two hours serenading the late shift.</TE>
<TE>   All over status-conscious Manhattan, cultural divides melted the
way they did in the 1960s days of radical chic when Black Panthers
were hanging out at Leonard Bernstein's apartment. The American
hostages returning from Iran in 1981 got a taste of the same
treatment when Kenny Rogers took them all to Las Vegas for a
vacation. (Within weeks, one hostage was complaining that he couldn't
even get his newspaper delivered.)</TE>
<TE>   But while sophisticated-girl-meets-humble-fireman has high
cinematic value, the reality is predictable: Cultures eventually
collide. Rebecca Liss, an attractive New York television producer,
was quite taken with a fireman in her neighborhood. After tearfully
recalling his Sept. 11 experiences, he worked up the courage to ask
her out. For their first date they went to a hip local restaurant,
not the sort of homey place he was used to. He ordered the mozzarella
appetizer. But when the cheese turned out to be smoked, he seemed
taken aback: "It tastes like fire," he told Liss. Then, after a meal
he clearly didn't enjoy, he asked if she wanted to go for pizza.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized we had nothing in common," Liss says. "He was so cute
and sweet, and I was so moved by him and his tears. I did want to
reach out and take care of him. I couldn't say no when he asked me
out. But our worlds were so different."</TE>
<TE>   Now she's back to dating lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Simon laughed when he heard this dating story. Tim O'Neill
snickered at the notion of his comrades getting rowdy at the
celebrity Christmas party. In separate interviews Simon and O'Neill,
firemen in Ladder No. 5, had almost identical reactions.</TE>
<TE>   "What did she expect?" says Simon.</TE>
<TE>   "What did they expect?" says O'Neill. "A year ago it would have
been funny, right, if a bunch of firemen got a little drunk at a
Christmas party. Now it's: What are these guys doing here? Well,
we're the same guys. We're who we always were."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill and Simon and the rest at Ladder No. 5 are real men in
real relationships who experienced real trauma last year. Just 15
months ago life as they knew it took a hairpin turn, and they found
themselves sifting through bent steel for body parts and mourning 343
of their own.</TE>
<TE>   While there is still a huge reservoir of respect and affection for
all New York firefighters, life has returned to normal for most of
their newfound admirers. But not for the firemen, and that's the real
cultural divide.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, they're back to their mind-numbing routines -- drilling
twice a day, double shifts twice a month, paying into football pools,
saving little old ladies from gas leaks, putting out Christmas tree
fires, working out in small gyms tucked into the corners of the
firehouse.</TE>
<TE>   But the loss is relentless.</TE>
<TE>   Half the men of Ladder No. 5 and Engine No. 24, who share a
firehouse on 6th Avenue and West Houston Street, are gone. Eleven
died when the towers fell. Another dozen are retired or on medical
leave. The house is now filled with young recruits who need a lot of
training. And now the mayor is closing eight firehouses and enforcing
a hiring freeze citywide. Which means more overtime for everybody but
also more fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   The confluence of death, retirement and cutbacks is keeping the
pressure on experienced leaders like Anthony Varriale, the
51-year-old captain of Engine No. 24. He also has to cope with
injuries of his own. Varriale lost 14% of his lung capacity working
on the cleanup at ground zero and was out sick for four months.
Although he is tan after a brief Caribbean vacation, he looks tired
and tense.</TE>
<TE>   "We need more training for terrorism and biological warfare, and
all we get is a three-hour course and $9 radiation detectors with
batteries that go out," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Varriale is irritated with the mayor, with the whole city for that
matter. With 26 years in the department, he too could retire. So many
have gotten out. But he can't seem to leave. His concern is for the
men, particularly for the recruits who have come into the department
in so much turmoil, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Now they're losing their "hunk" status. The unkindest cut of all?
Varriale forgets his anger for a minute and laughs. "As if I care,"
he snorts, stepping into his boots to answer a call.</TE>
<TE>   Not that there isn't always plenty of action around the firehouse
lately. Eleven guys became fathers last year, high for house of just
50 men.</TE>
<TE>   "That number 11 sticks around here a lot," says Simon, pausing for
a long drag on his cigarette. It's a warm night for December, and
he's out in front of the brick firehouse, studying the skyline after
a busy shift. "We lost 11 guys on Sept. 11. We've had 11 babies.
There are 11 probies [new recruits still on probation] in the house
right now. It's weird."</TE>
<TE>   A little while later he mentions that a neighbor was around the
house that evening dropping off her annual gift for the guys, a
barrel of chocolate-covered pretzels. She did that the Christmas
before the attack, and she's still doing it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a whole new ballgame around here," Simon muses. "It's slowed
down with people trooping through. And yet the neighborhood is still
good to the house. Some things are really very much the same."</TE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Worried about overpopulation, pollution, dwindling natural resources
and global warming? Well, the good news, according to British
paleobiologist Michael Boulter, is that our selfish behavior as a
species may not, in the long run, destroy our beautiful planet or
most of the life forms that inhabit it. The bad news, however, is
that our abuse probably will put an end to most of the larger
mammals, in particular us, the soi-disant Homo sapiens, apparently
less sapient than billed.</LD>
<LD>   A professor of paleobiology at the University of East London,
Boulter has been studying extinction, including the five major mass
extinction events that have occurred since the beginning of life on
Earth. The largest single factor in each case, he concludes, was
radical change in the environment, leaving erstwhile flourishing
species suddenly unable to survive. "Evolution," Boulter explains,
"is less to do with winning battles between species and individuals,
more to do with being able to live well together in the same
environment."</LD>
<TE>   Right now, he believes, we are on the verge of another
mass-extinction event. Scientists in almost every field have been
finding evidence that our climate, water levels and atmosphere are
changing at an alarming rate. In the past, such drastic environmental
changes were caused by impersonal forces like asteroids, meteorites
or intense volcanic activity. This time, however, the culprit has
been man. Our agriculture has been destroying forests and other
natural habits. Migration and travel on an unprecedented scale have
spread disease and wiped out native species of plants and animals.
And our increasing consumption of fossil fuels is causing radical
changes in climate.</TE>
<TE>   These, in turn, he predicts, will unleash floods, droughts,
disease, famine and wars, along with other unimaginable horrors
resulting in the end of the human species. Freed of this disruptive
element, other species will eventually bounce back and flourish
nicely.</TE>
<TE>   Boulter bases his dire prediction on several key factors: data
about the rapidly deteriorating state of our oceans, forests,
climate, soil and atmosphere; the pattern he discerns in
mass-extinction events of the past; and a version of the so-called
Gaia theory, which maintains that life on Earth is a complicated,
self-regulating system that will eventually return things to a more
peaceful state by first getting rid of the chief troublemaker, the
humans.</TE>
<TE>   Mother Earth as an angry parent punishing her most destructive
child? As Boulter explains, it is not necessary to descend to
anthropomorphic fables to grasp the thesis. A complex animal like
man, whose population has shot up exponentially over the last century
and who (unlike an amoeba, jellyfish or rat) requires so much to
sustain life, is more likely to suffer from the consequences of the
floods, droughts, famines and diseases that will be unleashed when,
for instance, the Himalayan snowpack melts down onto the Indian
subcontinent or the cities of New York, Baltimore, Boston and New
Orleans are submerged by the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Can anything be done? Boulter is extremely skeptical: "There are
conventions and summits, a permanent United Nations Conference to
look after the Biodiversity Convention, as well as regular meetings
of environment ministers. But sales of cars and refrigerators soar in
China and India; gasoline stays cheap in North America; Europe
consumes timber from a dwindling tropical rainforest. The tourist
industry booms globally." It is his belief that our species lacks the
political will to modify our behavior: We are simply too selfish and
aggressive for our own good.</TE>
<TE>   Boulter writes with clarity and verve about findings, theses and
models from a wide variety of fields. Still, it can sometimes be hard
for the nonscientist to follow some of the more technical arguments
or to get an overall sense of how all the parts fit together. And
indeed, the sheer complexity of the subject, as Boulter remarks, is
one reason why political leaders and the general public have so poor
a grasp on the severity and magnitude of the problem. But simply
because scientists have not yet arrived at incontrovertible proof
does not mean that we can ignore the alarming picture that is
developing.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some scientists, who have raised urgent voices in desperate
warning, hoping to persuade political leaders to act before it's too
late, Boulter's tone is oddly serene, almost blithe: "The effect [of
humans' becoming extinct] would be that the abuse would stop being
inflicted and peace and quiet would return." His curious air of
sang-froid would seem to bear out Nietzsche's complaint about
scientists being so coolly objective as to seem lacking in ordinary
human feeling. Is he writing this book simply to give himself the
satisfaction of having been right? Isn't there some danger that his
defeatist tone may convince readers that the environmental cause and
mankind are doomed anyway, so why not gas up the SUV and drive at 80
mph?</TE>
<TE>   Boulter's pessimism is understandable. Over the course of our
history and prehistory, humans have killed one another and hunted
many species to the point of extinction. Since the Industrial
Revolution, we have been wreaking havoc on the natural environment.
Boulter sees selfishness and aggression as our fatal flaws. But,
considering the shortsighted way many of us behave, selfishness -- or
the ability to grasp what is in our own interest and act on it --
would be a step up.</TE>
<TE>   We've all seen "selfish" drivers running red lights, cutting ahead
of other cars or swerving at breakneck speed across several lanes of
traffic. Yet, "selfish" drivers gain no real "advantage": They risk
becoming involved in accidents, damaging their cars and possibly
injuring or even killing themselves. Surely, truly "selfish" drivers
who value their time, money and lives would be cautious, alert and
courteous. What makes us so oblivious to our own well-being? Perhaps,
as Boulter suggests, aggression is to blame for making us not just
selfish, but downright stupid. Perhaps this book, like a splash of
cold water, will help wake us up.</TE>

<HD>Classic-books school saves a classic hall</HD>
<DH>St. John's is showing Richard Neutra's work the respect
that has been lacking elsewhere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edward Gunts</AU>
<BD>Baltimore Sun</BD>
<DL>ANNAPOLIS, Md.</DL>
<LD>The past year has not been especially kind to the memory of modern
architect Richard Neutra, who died in 1970. One of his best-known
residences, the 1962 Maslon House in Rancho Mirage, was torn down in
March. The National Park Service threw its support behind a plan to
demolish Neutra's 1961 Cyclorama Center at Gettysburg National
Military Park.</LD>
<LD>   But at least one Neutra building is ending the year in better
shape than it began. St. John's College in Annapolis has completed a
$12.9-million restoration and modernization of Mellon Hall, the 1959
classroom and laboratory building that the California-based architect
designed for its campus.</LD>
<LD>   Because of the college's efforts, one of the few remaining Neutra
buildings on the East Coast has a secure future, and St. John's has a
modern classic enhanced by sensitively designed improvements that
make it more useful than ever.</LD>
<TE>   St. John's is better known for its classic books than its classic
buildings, modern or otherwise. All students are required to focus
their studies on approximately 130 "Great Books."</TE>
<TE>   Neutra and St. John's came together when the architect was invited
to give a lecture on campus in April 1954. The college, which traces
its history to 1696, was planning to expand on the north end of
campus.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Vienna in 1892 and educated in the universities of Vienna
and Zurich, Neutra had moved to America in 1923 to practice
architecture. He settled in California and made his mark with simple
structures that had flat roofs and expansive glass-window walls that
showed off the surroundings. One of the few architects ever featured
on the cover of Time magazine, he was particularly known for blurring
the lines between the interior and exterior of a building.</TE>
<TE>   When he went to St. John's, Neutra was at the peak of his
popularity. A recent article in Time described him as second "only to
the lordly Frank Lloyd Wright," with whom he studied. His lecture at
St. John's was part of a speaking tour to promote his book, "Survival
Through Design" (Oxford University Press, 1969), which outlined his
approach to architecture. In it, he argued that modern architecture
must go beyond providing shelter and act as a social force to improve
mankind.</TE>
<TE>   "Neutra created a unique and visionary architecture that
integrated nature, environmental responsibility, science, technology
and an optimistic humanism," said Steve Ziger, a partner in the firm
of Ziger/Snead Architects, which was hired in 1999 to carry out the
renovation. "He established an eloquent and dramatic relationship
between modern building technology and carefully controlled
landscapes."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Weigle, then St. John's president, was impressed with
Neutra's views. He also saw the potential benefit of having a
celebrity architect design the college's new building, which would be
the largest on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Neutra wanted more work on the East Coast. One year after the
lecture in Annapolis, he signed a contract to design the St. John's
building for considerably less than their regular fee.</TE>
<TE>   It was an unconventional choice for St. John's and Annapolis, so
steeped in colonial history. But it suited the governors of the
college, who wanted to contribute to the campus the best in
contemporary architecture. The selection also won support from
donors, including philanthropist Paul Mellon, a St. John's graduate
whose Old Dominion Foundation gave $1.25 million toward construction,
more than half the total cost of $2.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Neutra spent time on St. John's campus, consulting with faculty
members, attending classes and learning about the Great Books
program.</TE>
<TE>   The 99,000-square-foot building was designed to contain
classrooms, offices, laboratories and an auditorium. Like many of
Neutra's schools, it is a low, abstract building that originally had
an outdoor courtyard in the center, opening to a larger green space
beyond. The building's large horizontal windows and relatively low
scale help integrate it with the campus while making it seem smaller
than it is.</TE>
<TE>   One of its distinctive features is a series of aluminum louvers,
linked to motors, that enable occupants to open or close them
depending on the amount of natural light they want.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Neutra's attention to detail, the building had its share
of flaws. Its central court never got much use. Its long and unbroken
corridors were monotonous and dark. The solar louvers, while
innovative and environmentally responsible, broke down soon after
opening day and were never fixed. Mechanical and electrical systems
were quickly outdated. Interior spaces lacked air conditioning. The
roof leaked. The auditorium was inadequate. A reflecting pool around
the planetarium couldn't hold water.</TE>
<TE>   Later additions closed off the court and negated Neutra's effort
to create a building that was open to its surroundings. Part of the
problem was that design ideas that worked in California may not have
translated well to Maryland. A tight construction budget also led to
shortcomings that would not have emerged if the building had been
better funded from the start.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to renovate and modernize the building, principal-in-charge
Steve Ziger and project architect Joseph Cellucci aimed to capitalize
on the best of Neutra's principles and designs and address as many of
the flaws as possible. The architects conducted extensive research on
Neutra and consulted with his son, Dion, an architect who shared
insights about his father's design philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first took on the renovation, there was a generalized
belief at the college that modern architecture was kind of evil, in
part because of the problems with the building over the years,"
Cellucci said. "We thought we would be successful if we changed that
perception."</TE>
<TE>   The renovations began in April 2001. As of this fall, the exterior
has been restored, and the classrooms, offices and common spaces have
been improved. Modern mechanical and electrical systems were
installed. The auditorium has been renovated. Even the louvers work
again.</TE>
<TE>   A red-tile floor was installed to humanize and brighten once-dark
corridors. A solarium cafe was created to add life to the center
court, and a new wing houses a pottery studio, darkroom and a
teleconferencing and seminar center called the Hodson Trust
Conference Room. Both the cafe and Hodson Trust wing are compatible
with Neutra's original design.</TE>
<TE>   Not every flaw has been addressed. The additions that closed in
the center court were left in place and will most likely remain, and
other problems won't be fixed until money becomes available.</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, the recent changes have brought new luster to a
modern classic.</TE>

<HD>Caymmi weaves Brazilian rhythms into supple cloth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guitarist-singer-songwriter Dori Caymmi doesn't surface often for
public performances, devoting most of his time to producing and
arranging for other performers. And that's a shame, since the
Brazilian-born artist, the son of Dorival Caymmi (who wrote some of
Carmen Miranda's greatest hits), is one of the Southland's authentic
originals.</LD>
<LD>   Caymmi -- who has lived in Los Angeles since the '80s -- played a
rare engagement Friday and Saturday at La Ve Lee in Studio City,
leading a quintet in a program mixing his original songs with
familiar bossa nova items and occasional standards (including a
distinctly offbeat rendering of the "Pink Panther Theme").</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, the primary focus centered upon the supple
interaction between Caymmi's gruff but appealing vocals and his
harmonically mesmerizing guitar playing. On every number, from his
remarkable reworking of "Samba de Uma Nota So" ("One Note Samba") and
his linkage of "Desafinado" with the classic "Aquarelado Brasil"
("Brazil"), to the atmospheric sounds of a pair of originals,
"Spring" and "The Amazon River," his capacity to create colorful
tonal clusters over a surging undercurrent of rhythm was a constant
source of amazement.</LD>
<TE>   Caymmi, who won a Latin Grammy award in the best Brazilian song
category this year for "Saudade De Amar," was aided in his set by a
sterling group of players.</TE>
<TE>   Drummer Mike Shapiro and bassist Jerry Watts produced
samba-drenched rhythms, saxophonist Scott Mayo added a series of
warm-toned solos, and -- best of all--keyboardist Bill Cantos
countered Caymmi's vocals with his own energetic scat efforts, sung
in unison with his keyboard improvising.</TE>

<KH>POP MUSIC REVIEW</KH>
<HD>A star is born? Well, not quite</HD>
<DH>Kelly Osbourne's punkish gig at the Roxy lacks command but
does show her fascination for the music and respect for her fans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How are we supposed to treat Kelly Osbourne's opening Saturday at the
Roxy?</LD>
<LD>   Should we resent the 18-year-old, on behalf of all the struggling
musicians out there, because the main reason she landed a record
contract and a headline gig at the fashionable pop club is that she
is the daughter of Ozzy and Sharon?</LD>
<LD>   Or should we go easy on her because we all love the Osbourne
family TV show, bulldog and all, and because being a celebrity
offspring can be as much of a burden as a blessing. Do we need to
name names? On Saturday, the pouty-faced punkette made it easy to cut
her some slack because she approached the night with the enthusiasm
and innocence of a fan rather than the haughtiness and cool of a
self-proclaimed star.</LD>
<TE>   You could see signs at every turn of her own fascination with rock
performers -- from the way she planted her feet firmly and thrust her
arm in the air during songs, a la Billy Idol, to how she mirrored the
wide-eyed party exuberance of the Go-Gos.</TE>
<TE>   The most engaging moment in Kelly's 40-minute set came during the
final number when she invited more than a dozen members of the
audience onstage to join her in singing Madonna's "Papa Don't
Preach."</TE>
<TE>   It was a sweet, generous instinct because Kelly probably knows
that the only way she could get on such a high-profile stage these
days without the family ties would be if some other performer invited
her up. The fans were so excited to be onstage Saturday that they
hugged Kelly and each other, and Kelly seemed as thrilled as any of
them.</TE>
<TE>   That same love for the pop experience runs through the teenager's
debut album, "Shut Up." There's nothing about the Epic release that
makes the music seem any more lasting than a coat of fingernail
polish. But the musical foundations of the songs are sometimes
inviting because they rely so heavily on proven punk and pop-punk
strains, be it the snarl of the Sex Pistols (as on "Disconnected") or
the more poppy, Go-Gos undercurrent of several songs. The lyrics echo
equally generic themes about teen impatience and confusion -- with
lots of attention given to boys.</TE>
<TE>   Onstage Saturday, Kelly didn't show enough character as a singer
or command as a performer to make us feel the fury of the songs,
leaving it up to her four-piece band to supply the energy and
aggression written into the numbers. But her disarming manner kept
the whole thing from being an empty exercise.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever Kelly's future as a singer, this solo career move should
provide interesting footage for the TV show. It'll be fun to know
what Ozzy, Sharon and brother Jack have to say about it. To her
credit Saturday, Kelly stood on her own. None of the other Osbournes
stepped onstage, though a proud mom cheered her on from a rear table.</TE>

<HD>Served up weekly, this show could be a big fat Greek flop</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some movies should remain movies. For example, here's a prediction
for 2003: Nothing short of liposuction will make a CBS version of "My
Big Fat Greek Wedding" -- retitled "My Big Fat Greek Life" for TV --
palatable as a weekly comedy.</LD>
<LD>   If you're thinking this is about Plato, Aristotle, the Acropolis,
Athenian art or other Hellenic antiquities, you're living on another
planet. Nor is there anything remotely Socratic about its dialogue.
In fact, you can bet that "My Big Fat Greek Life" will go against one
of the cherished concepts inscribed on the great shrine of Delphi:
"Nothing in Excess."</LD>
<LD>   Scheduled to begin shooting in January, the series is spun from a
movie based on a one-woman stage show by comic Nia Vardalos. She
walks her story's ethnic high wire as 30ish Toula Portokalos, whose
romance with high school teacher Ian Miller (John Corbett) frees her
from dowdiness and a drab life but not the smothering attentions of
her Grecophile father, Gus (Michael Constantine), and the rest of her
family. They're all over Toula about ending her unmarried status,
pressuring her not to mate with just anyone but to wed a Greek boy,
have Greek babies and feed the multitudes.</LD>
<TE>   Fat chance. The movie ends right after Toula and non-Greek Ian
marry and set up housekeeping under Gus' close monitoring, which is
where the TV series is said to begin, with Corbett the only major
big-screen cast member who isn't returning.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the intrusive in-laws factor, there's been talk about
Everyone Loves Toula being a ringer for CBS' smart and witty
"Everyone Loves Raymond." That, too, is fanciful thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Look, I've nothing against the film, which has become this year's
surprise box office behemoth, a lucrative romantic comedy for the
ages and the most famous movie about Greeks since "Never on Sunday,"
which also earned a ton of money after being made in 1960 for a
pittance.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, I found "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" very funny, was
charmed by Vardalos, and related some of the cultural mandates
imposed on Toula to my own Jewish background ("What -- you can't find
a Jewish girl?").</TE>
<TE>   Plus, I gave thumbs down to negative reviews that sniffed about
director Joel Zwick's background in TV sitcoms, as if his entry into
cinema's great, glistening Parthenon had ruined the neighborhood.
Now, that's funny.</TE>
<TE>   Many good feature directors first worked in television, so what's
the problem? Besides, a dazzling sitcom is as much high art as a top
theatrical movie. NBC's "Seinfeld," HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show"
and a few other masterworks, for example, are TV comedy's very own
Mona Lisa and Sistine Chapel rolled into one, to be roped off and
admired.</TE>
<TE>   This is apples and oranges, of course, but on their own terms,
Citizens Seinfeld and Sanders stand as tall as "Citizen Kane." And
are arguably even more impressive, given the challenge of successful
TV series to sustain their appeal over extended periods instead of
just two hours.</TE>
<TE>   Yet don't expect "My Big Fat Greek Life" to join that elite crowd.
Or come even close.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the original pilot was made before the movie was
released, the series is bucking tradition. That's because TV series
rarely translate well as movies, and movies just as rarely succeed
creatively as series. One striking exception was "MASH," which
quieted skeptics by soaring on TV for more than a decade, thanks
largely to Larry Gelbart, Gene Reynolds and Burt Metcalfe, while only
partially imitating Robert Altman's terrific movie.</TE>
<TE>   As for the coming Vardalos series, its good cast (which also
includes Lainie Kazan, Andrea Martin and Joey Fatone) won't prevent
it from buckling creatively under the same tonnage of burlesque and
broad nonsense that made the movie such a hoot.</TE>
<TE>   Hyperbole works wonders for comedy in limited increments, and
there was nothing subtle about Melina Mercouri's "Never on Sunday"
hooker with a heart. But week after week after week, throughout an
initial order for seven episodes? They don't call it over the top for
nothing, and a special brand of genius (think what Larry David gave
"Seinfeld") is required to find freshness in weekly extravagance.</TE>
<TE>   Vardalos has said: "I basically took every Greek wedding I've ever
been to, including mine, and on a scale of one to 10, turned it up to
11."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, her characters are stereotypes if not flat-out
caricatures, the fattest of these being Gus, who insists in the movie
that all words have Greek roots and believes that a spritz of Windex
cures everything short of terminal illness.</TE>
<TE>   Although initially funny, these gags begin to age well before the
final credits roll. As do Ian's effete, brainless, super-WASP
parents, who are not just over the top, but over the moon. Imagine
this coming to you on a weekly basis.</TE>
<TE>   "Muriel's Wedding" it's not. Observed from afar, in fact, the CBS
adaptation of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" seems much like prime time's
look-alike sitcom mediocrities, and it will take something truly
inspired from Vardalos and her writers to lift it above that teeming
herd.</TE>

<HD>One actor who can take it to 'The Bank'</HD>

<LD>Among the many actors from Down Under who have migrated to U.S.
shores to forge successful movie careers -- Mel Gibson, Russell
Crowe, Geoffrey Rush and Heath Ledger immediately come to mind -- the
name Anthony LaPaglia may not immediately register with the average
American moviegoer.</LD>
<LD>   But the versatile Adelaide-born Tony Award-winning actor with the
Italian name and American accent, who has lived in New York for two
decades, is on a roll. In addition to "The Bank," which opens Friday
in limited release, LaPaglia can also be seen in the recent Robert De
Niro-Billy Crystal comedy sequel "Analyze That," and he has a
starring role opposite Sigourney Weaver in "The Guys," which tells
the story of a fire captain who lost eight men in the collapse of the
World Trade Center. He also appears in the CBS-TV crime drama
"Without a Trace."</LD>
<LD>   In "The Bank," LaPaglia plays a ruthless executive who devises a
bold insider-trading scheme that could rank among the biggest banking
scandals of all time. Written and directed by Robert Connolly, "The
Bank" co-stars David Wenham as a brilliant mathematician working to
perfect a program that can predict stock market crashes.</LD>
<TE>   Over the years, LaPaglia has played his share of gangsters and
cops. Is he worried about stereotyping? Not really, he told
Australian television. "Anything that keeps you from having to wait
tables is a good thing."</TE>

<LD>On Christmas Day about five years ago, my best present came. I opened
it and gasped. It was a large pirate ship with Playmobile people to
go on it. There was a cabin, some steps and a steering wheel on the
top. I still admire the ship in my memory because I don't have it
anymore. It got too old. But one thing is for sure: I won't ever
forget it.</LD>

<HD>A chorus of affection for the razzle-dazzle man</HD>
<DH>Actors from Shirley MacLaine to Joel Grey recall the vision
and creativity of Bob Fosse, creator of 'Chicago.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If there hadn't been Bob Fosse, there wouldn't be the acclaimed new
movie musical "Chicago." The dazzling innovator choreographed and
directed the original 1975 Broadway production of "Chicago," which
starred his wife, Gwen Verdon, as well as Chita Rivera and Jerry
Orbach.</LD>
<LD>   Fosse's choreography was sexy and bold, his direction of musicals
and movies surreal and daring. Although his first feature film,
1969's "Sweet Charity," was not a hit, his next film, 1972's
"Cabaret," transformed the world of movie musicals. The dark and
daring film won eight Oscars, with Fosse winning best director over
Francis Ford Coppola for "The Godfather." That same year, Fosse also
won the Tony for directing "Pippin" and the Emmy for directing the
NBC special "Liza With a Z." Fosse is the only director to receive
all three honors in the same year.</LD>
<LD>   Fosse received Oscar nominations for best director and screenplay
for his 1979 semiautobiographical film, "All That Jazz," about a
womanizing, chain-smoking choreographer-director who dies of a heart
attack. His last feature film was 1983's "Star 80," a stark,
disturbing drama about slain Playboy Playmate Dorothy Stratten. A
smoker who refused to give up cigarettes even after bypass surgery,
Fosse died at 60 of a heart attack in 1987 while walking on the
street in Washington, D.C.</LD>
<TE>   Several people who worked with Fosse talked recently about his
creativity, personality and legacy.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley MacLaine, whom Fosse plucked out of the chorus of "Pajama
Game" to understudy the role of Carol Haney in the Broadway musical;
MacLaine also starred in "Sweet Charity":</TE>
<TE>   He would always lurk around in the back of the theater. We would
see this little guy hunched over. He was hunched when he was probably
9, and he would always have that cigarette dangling from his lips. He
would have us in the basement of the St. James Theatre rehearsing
"Steam Heat" at 3 or 4 in the morning, cigarette smoke coming out of
his mouth. He would always say, "I apologize -- but can we do it
again?" and again and again and again.</TE>
<TE>   With "Sweet Charity," this is what happened: Lew Wasserman [then
head of MCA] called me and said, "What do you want to do next?" I
said, "Sweet Charity." He said, "Who do you want to direct it?" and I
said, "Fosse." "He said, "Fosse! He's a choreographer." I said,
"Yeah, but he is going to be one of the great directors. Trust me on
this."</TE>
<TE>   So he brought out this little guy, and we started working. As we
started to work, I realized that he was truly a Fellini aficionado,
that's why he had so many big close-ups. I found him working on the
picture to be absolutely calm, not at all temperamental, and
exquisitely specific.</TE>
<TE>   Do you know what? He died on the street in front of my old ballet
school in Washington, D.C. If it wasn't for Fosse putting me in that
part in "Pajama Game," how would any of this have happened to me? And
then I brought him to Hollywood, and he died in front of my ballet
school. So tell me there is no such thing as synchronicity or karma.</TE>
<TE>   John Rubinstein, who starred in the title role of the 1972 musical
"Pippin":</TE>
<TE>   He always had the audience in mind. He didn't use euphemisms and
mysterious director language when he wanted you to do a take or do a
piece of business. Of course, he was very much like that in his
choreography. Every move was based on an emotion and thought, a
puzzle piece of a total story. That's what made his choreography so
electric.</TE>
<TE>   The elbow had to be bent in a certain way because it gave a dancer
an attitude, and it was the attitude he was after. Even in death, he
did one of the greatest gestures that anybody had ever done. He left
in his will a list of people where he left you something like $332.75
to go to dinner on him. Then Gwen called and said we will send you a
check, of course, but if you want to pool all of this money we will
throw a huge party and that is what, I guess, most of us did ... this
big party at Tavern on the Green on the night of his memorial
service. There was a huge band and a great dinner. We drank and
danced, and Bob was sort of all-pervading. He sort of orchestrated it
for us.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Orbach, who starred as Billy Flynn in Fosse's original 1975
version of "Chicago":</TE>
<TE>   Fosse had a dark, kind of jaded view of the world, and he loved
satire and black humor. And like other choreographer-directors, his
vision was mainly visual rather than verbal. But he loved writers. He
wanted to shock people, make them laugh and entertain them. It's that
kind of the hat-over-one-eye, winking-at-the-world philosophy. He was
easy for me to work with. We made up a lot of stuff. We improvised
things and put them into the script. We invented whole speeches that
we worked on and that whole circus atmosphere of "Razzle Dazzle." One
of the things Bob did was that he made filmic transitions from scene
to scene without going to a blackout or a curtain coming down. At the
end of the number "All I Care About Is Love," which I did as a
striptease down to underwear, from that I walked right into my office
where a guy is fitting me for a new suit, so you go right from one
thing into another -- in a sense like a film dissolve.</TE>
<TE>   Michael York, who starred as Brian Roberts in the film "Cabaret":</TE>
<TE>   I worked with him before the Fosse legend sort of settled in. He
had this Broadway reputation, but as a film director he had to prove
himself because "Sweet Charity" hadn't exactly been a big success. I
remember during the making of "Cabaret" there were executive
gentlemen in suits wanting him to get on to it. But you quite clearly
could tell he had a vision and a way he wanted it done.</TE>
<TE>   I knew this was a great property, but I remember going to Munich
and really starting to concentrate on the script. I realized there
wasn't a role to play -- [I played] an observer that all of these
extroverted characters revolved around, so I didn't know what to do.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't know Bob Fosse, but I remember getting up the courage to
speak to him. He agreed with me, and we had this extraordinary week
where they were also doing the dances and laying down the soundtrack,
and he used it to just beef up the whole narrative and relationships
so this opaque character had flesh and blood.</TE>
<TE>   Mariel Hemingway, who starred as Dorothy Stratten in "Star 80":</TE>
<TE>   He was the total choreographer. He choreographed all of the photo
shoot scenes we did together as if they were a dance. We rehearsed
six weeks prior to shooting. He taped out the sets on the floor of
the stage, and by the end of the third week he would get a stopwatch
and time out the movie. We would go from one scene to the next in
sequence, and it was extraordinary because by the time you went to
shoot it, it was in you as if it were a play. Nobody was really
surprised [about his early death]. He would sit on the set and go
into these coughing fits that would frighten us, and then he would
put another cigarette in his mouth. He came from the idea that the
artist has to be on the edge of turmoil and pain.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Grey, who won the best supporting actor Oscar for his role as
the emcee in "Cabaret":</TE>
<TE>   "I knew in the first place when I read the script that it was
going to be something very different, that the form would be new, and
even if it hadn't been a musical, it would have been very compelling.
I knew he was onto something he had never mastered before. Though he
had made good work, this was a big step forward for him.</TE>
<TE>   When we started working, I started to see what his vision was, and
I started to see the physical production. The first day I saw
dailies, I wept. His films were so awesome. I think in many ways his
films were greater than his Broadway stuff, which was pretty damn
good. I think he made gems in the movies.</TE>
<TE>   Debbie Allen, who won a Tony for the Fosse revival of "Sweet
Charity":</TE>
<TE>   I never worked with a director before or since who was so
specific. He worked in small moments. He was brilliant with lights on
stage. He used to make a joke: "I have two steps. I just do it all
with lighting."</TE>
<TE>   There were so many women and girls around him, but he couldn't
function without Gwen. I remember there was a period of time when we
were doing "Sweet Charity" in New York; he was also doing "Big Deal,"
and he was going through a real frustrating time. And there was
something that happened between him and Gwen. There was an argument,
and she left the theater. He was not himself for about two days until
she came back.</TE>
<TE>   Chita Rivera, who appeared in the movie version of "Sweet Charity"
and the original production of "Chicago" and has a cameo in the
movie:</TE>
<TE>   He was crazy about women. He was crazy about sex, obviously. He
made women look phenomenal and broke all kinds of rules. It was
magical to work with him because you didn't know where he was going
or what he was up to until he was finished with it and you would go,
oh my God, that is what it is.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Reinking, a singer-dancer-actress who was Fosse's leading lady
offstage and on in "Dancin' " and in the movie "All That Jazz." She
also won a Tony for choreographing the long-running revival of
"Chicago":</TE>
<TE>   One of the best things about Bob or a director who is really
gifted is they have something in them that permeates the room, and
they make you want to be the very best you could be. Also, a really
great director is really a great teacher. They inspire, they coach,
they nurture.</TE>
<TE>   Bob's real gift was that he had a tremendous ability to tell a
story exceptionally well, no matter what the story was. If he
committed to the story and wanted to tell it, he would use everything
in his power and education, whether it is by dancing or acting.</TE>
<TE>   He was a real sweet man and very shy. He loved to make things. He
loved to cook. We used to take long walks, and he used to pick things
up off the street that interested him, and he would save things. He
read like you couldn't believe. He just loved sports. He had lifelong
friends for 30, 40 or 50 years, and he was close to his sister, and
he was a great father. When he wasn't working there was an amazingly
shy and dear, very sweet person who did things you wouldn't expect.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Marshall, director of the film "Chicago" who also danced in
Ann Reinking's one-woman show:</TE>
<TE>   I worked with Fosse so briefly. I did Ann Reinking's act down at
the Joyce Theater, and she was doing a number from "Dancin'," and he
came down and worked with her. That was my one sort of brush with
him.</TE>
<TE>   I saw the original production of "Chicago" with Gwen and Chita. It
was so brilliant and so beautiful. I thought it was so dark and
cynical and funny and sexy and glamorous. I was sort of overwhelmed
by it.</TE>
<TE>   I have such respect for this man as a genius of the theater and
film that I swore to myself that I would not do a watered-down Bob
Fosse version. In other words, I wouldn't bastardize his work and
sort of interpret it myself and do my version of Bob Fosse. To me
that's sacrilegious. You just kind of hope he would be pleased.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that actually gave me such gratification is [agent] Sam
Cohn, who was one of his best friends, saw the movie and turned to me
and hugged me and said, "Bob would have been so proud." That's all I
needed to hear.</TE>

<LD>Ah, remember the good old days when New Year's Day meant
back-to-back-to-back college football bowl games?</LD>
<LD>   Don't worry, the good old days are still here. New Year's Day will
feature six games, beginning with the Outback and Cotton bowls at 8
a.m. (on ESPN and Fox, respectively) and not ending until nearly 10
p.m. on the West Coast, by which time Georgia and Florida State will
exit the Sugar Bowl field in New Orleans' Superdome (ABC).</LD>
<LD>   But wait, there's more: On Thursday, USC squares off against Iowa
in the Orange Bowl, at 5 p.m. on ABC, and on Friday, Miami and Ohio
State battle for the national championship in the Fiesta Bowl, at 5
p.m. on ABC.</LD>
<TE>   College athletics continue to strain the credulity of quaint
expressions like "student athlete." The major bowl games are now
called the Bowl Championship Series, or BCS. If BCS sounds like a
bank, perhaps it's no coincidence. Last year, for instance, ABC
anchored part of its coverage from Disney's California Adventure
theme park, giving the Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC, some
synergistic exposure for both its theme park and TV divisions.</TE>

<HD>In search of the year that's just gone by</HD>

<AU>AL MARTINEZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The year crept out like a kitten down the hall, leaving only soft
imprints of its passing. True, there are still a couple of days left,
but for the most part 2002 is gone, and one wonders, where did it go?</LD>
<LD>   You can look for its existence in the news, of course, in all
those year-end wrap-ups offered by both the print and electronic
media, complete with pictures and poetry, but that's not where the
year goes for people like us. Ordinary folks.</LD>
<LD>   We're not generally associated with the larger events that demand
to be noticed, except possibly as victims or as remote viewers like
spectators at a football game. I'm talking about the year as we know
it that disappeared down the hall or around a corner somewhere. Our
year. The small year.</LD>
<TE>   I was thinking about this the other night, about how everyone is
saying, "Where did the year go?" They say it as though the year were
a tangible thing, maybe even a living creature, like the kitten, or a
bird that suddenly flew out an open window.</TE>
<TE>   I asked a friend where the year went and he said, pointing to his
newfound gray hair, "Right here!" But he was talking about time,
which is a grander show, and I was thinking on a smaller scale, like
a lounge act in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "Where did the year go?" I asked Cinelli, and she handed me a new
photograph of our grandchildren, who have grown taller and smarter
and wiser. "Right there," she said softly, thinking of them as the
babies she held and now as kids growing up.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, I suppose, the year is the passage of lives and phases that
we mark with tears and laughter, with awe and wonder. Where did the
little girl go who is now a teenager? Where did the little boy go who
is now a man?</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't really thinking about that exactly," I said to her.</TE>
<TE>   "Then," she said, "where did the year go? Maybe you should look
for it."</TE>
<TE>   She ignites my thinking process. I could not be a writer without
her, a woman who can throw an idea into a breeze and send it
fluttering like a butterfly. Look for it indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the year is in my closet, where old and new clothes
register fluctuations in weight and taste. But I have only vague
recollections of wearing that dark suit to a wedding and the blazer
to a reception and the turtleneck sweater to dinner. If the year is
there, I can't find it.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's in the boxes of mementos I have stored away, or in the
large plastic containers of scripts and manuscripts that I've stuck
here and there. I save them because I don't know what else to do with
them. Too many memories are encompassed in the mementos and too much
work in the written words to just toss them away.</TE>
<TE>   Only one batch of paper, 300 pages, is pertinent to the year that
is all but gone, and that's the book I've just finished. Much of 2002
is there, in the days and hours I spent assembling the paragraphs
that dwell in the mind's corners, waiting like puppies to be let into
the house.</TE>
<TE>   Kittens, puppies, birds. I realized as I composed these words that
I kept thinking of the year in terms of small animals, and that led
me to wonder whatever became of the squirrel that lived in the oak
tree just outside our dining room window. Did he, like the year, run
off somewhere to spend the cold nights in a warmer place, promising
to return when the chill passed? Does a year, like a squirrel, have
those instincts?</TE>
<TE>   As I looked for the squirrel, I noticed the garden. Surely the
year is contained there, in the growth of shrubs and trees and the
sudden appearance of an autumn flower that refuses to die in the
changing seasons. I considered the fir tree, now 12 feet tall, that
we bought as a living Christmas tree so many years ago when our
teenagers were babies and my hair less gray.</TE>
<TE>   Where did the year go?</TE>
<TE>   I turned finally to my appointment book, where the year lived in
doctor's visits and dinners, in interviews and meetings, in vacation
reminders and birthday parties, in duties and deadlines, in quick
trips and long illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Is that where the year went, in the minutia of living? In coming
and going, eating and sleeping, driving and walking, shopping and
watching television and holding a little grandson in your arms? Of
course. The year settles in that place where small memories live,
glimpses of the past that endure long after more calamitous events
are forgotten. It creeps down the hall and out the door and nestles
in a tree where time hides.</TE>

<HD>'Two' is No. 1 with 'Catch' closing in</HD>
<DH>The 'Lord of the Rings' film continued to dominate while
Spielberg's caper movie was solidly in second.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" dominated holiday moviegoing,
grossing an estimated $48.9 million over the three-day post-Christmas
weekend and crossing the $200-million mark in two weeks. Steven
Spielberg's 1960s caper film "Catch Me If You Can" came in at No. 2
with a solid $30 million estimated gross over the same period, in
3,156 theaters versus 3,622 for "The Two Towers."</LD>
<LD>   Even though "Catch Me If You Can," based on the life of a teenage
con artist, has failed to garner many critics' kudos or award
nominations so far, the DreamWorks movie's picaresque attitude seems
to be a genuine audience pleaser.</LD>
<LD>   While "The Two Towers" brought in a broad spectrum of moviegoers,
"Catch" played mainly to one demographic -- people older than 25.</LD>
<TE>   New Line Cinema enjoyed a golden weekend on two fronts, with
sustained business for "The Two Towers" and its quirky drama "About
Schmidt." The Jack Nicholson vehicle, directed by Alexander Payne,
grossed an estimated $815,000 over three days in 34 theaters for a
total to date of $2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, business for "The Two Towers" is 28% ahead of last
year's "Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring." The film's
overseas gross hit $201 million Sunday, bringing its worldwide total
to $401 million to date.</TE>
<TE>   Christmas Day launched a strong period for moviegoing, with "The
Two Towers" taking in $12.4 million, followed by almost $15.4 million
on Thursday. "Catch" brought in $9.9 million and $8.7 million
respectively on those two days.</TE>
<TE>   "Catch," which stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the young con artist
Frank Abagnale Jr. and Tom Hanks as the FBI agent who pursues him,
was made for about $60 million. The lighthearted film has grossed
$48.6 million since it opened Christmas Day. Considering that 70% of
"Catch's" audience was over 25, DiCaprio's role as the 1960s swinging
con man did not seem to pull in the hordes of teenage girls that made
"Titanic" such a gigantic hit.</TE>
<TE>   "Gangs" brought in $11.9 million Friday through Sunday in 2,190
theaters and has grossed $30 million in 10 days. Martin Scorsese's
dark, violent historical epic about the brutal gangs of 19th century
New York City remained at No. 5, behind the two romantic comedies
"Two Weeks Notice" and "Maid in Manhattan" respectively. Miramax
executives maintain they must make at least $55 million domestically
to break even on their share of the investment for the $100-million
film.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax's glossy musical "Chicago" opened this weekend to a strong
$2.1 million on only 77 screens. The highly anticipated film, based
on the Bob Fosse Broadway musical, grossed a healthy average of
$27,300 per screen. But Miramax's poorly reviewed "Pinocchio,"
directed by Italian comedian Roberto Benigni, averaged a paltry $955
per screen for a total of $1.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   On other fronts, Paramount saw a bright spot in an otherwise bleak
year with "The Hours," a star-studded drama about the parallel lives
of three unrelated women in different generations. The film, which
stars Julianne Moore, Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman, opened to an
estimated $337,000 in 11 theaters for an impressive average of
$30,636 per theater. Not surprisingly, it appealed mainly to women
over 35.</TE>
<TE>   Considering that many of their films this year, including "Star
Trek: Nemesis" and "The Four Feathers," bombed, Paramount executives
breathed a sigh of relief Sunday over "The Hours," a co-production
between Paramount and Miramax.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to have a pleasant conversation about the box office on
a Sunday for a change," said Wayne Lewellen, the studio's president
of distribution.</TE>
<TE>   Other releases this weekend included Focus Features' Holocaust
drama "The Pianist," which made $104,051 over three days in six
theaters. United Artists' rendering of Charles Dickens' "Nicholas
Nickelby" grossed $43,000 on five screens for an average of $8,600.</TE>
<TE>   This week's three-day box office total for all films was an
estimated $173 million compared with last year's $167 million, up
3.5%, according to box-office tracking firm Nielsen EDI.</TE>

<HD>Actor's life laid bare</HD>
<DH>Robert Guillaume holds nothing back in a memoir about rage,
pain, forgiveness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gayle Pollard-Terry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I'm a bastard, a Catholic, the son of a prostitute, and a product of
the poorest slums of St. Louis," says Robert Guillaume, reading from
the opening of his memoir to a standing-room-only crowd at Eso Won
bookstore, on La Brea Avenue near Baldwin Hills. " ... How did I get
from there to here?"</LD>
<LD>   Here is the age of 75, with two Emmys to his name, one for his
work in "Soap," the other for "Benson"; a second marriage, his only
successful union; a teenage daughter, the only one of his five
children to grow up with him; an exhibition of his career memorabilia
at the Smithsonian's Anacostia Museum in Washington, D.C.; and a new
book that describes a private life far from his public image.</LD>
<LD>   "Guillaume: A Life" (University of Missouri Press), his candid
autobiography co-written with David Ritz, sugarcoats nothing: not his
sad beginnings; his resulting rage; his mistreatment of women; his
abandonment of his older children; the 1990 death of his youngest
son, Jacques, from complications of AIDS; or the stroke four years
ago in January on the set of "Sports Night" that weakened his left
side, stole his independence and forced him to give up his beloved
Cadillac.</LD>
<TE>   Here is a very long way from where Robert Williams was born on
Nov. 30, 1927.</TE>
<TE>   Fatherless. Rejected by an abused, alcoholic mother who hated his
dark skin. Growing up in a back-alley apartment with neither
electricity nor plumbing. Sharing an outhouse with two dozen people.
Very, very poor.</TE>
<TE>   His grandmother, Jeannette Williams, rescued him. She taught him
to read. A domestic, she sacrificed to send him to Catholic school, a
mixed blessing. The nuns provided a good education, but many favored
black children with much lighter skin and "good hair."</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to be special.</TE>
<TE>   Did they know he was smart? After a couple of weeks in the first
grade, he was promoted to the third grade.</TE>
<TE>   Did they know he was good? The altar boy perfectly enunciating the
Latin responses, always ringing the little bells at the right time
during Mass. He wanted to become a priest. But he was told no boy
born out of wedlock could follow that sacred path.</TE>
<TE>   Did they know he could sing? His "Ave Maria" soared. His Gregorian
chant was beautifully holy. In the school musical, his "Just a Kid
Named Joe" brought down the house.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing was ever good enough. Rejected everywhere -- at home,
at school, even by his religion -- he disrupted class, talked back to
the priests, refused to obey the nuns.</TE>
<TE>   "By 12 or 13, I began to feel unloved," Guillaume says in an
interview in the family room of his Encino home. "I was loved by my
grandmother, but that didn't count. It was my mother's love that I
was seeking." He knew that wasn't going to happen.</TE>
<TE>   He stopped trying, stayed in trouble. He "grew increasingly
hostile," got kicked out of high school, enlisted in the Army, got
booted out of it too (although with an honorable discharge).</TE>
<TE>   Back in St. Louis, he worked at the post office, quickly finished
high school and enrolled in Jesuit-run St. Louis University, proving
once again that, yes, he was smart. He aced philosophy, "devoured
Shakespeare" and read "Paradise Lost," feeling the pain and anger in
Satan, relating to "his fury."</TE>
<TE>   He became the city's first black streetcar driver, switched to the
elite Washington University in St. Louis, where a music professor
recognized his talent, and trained his rich tenor on German lieder.</TE>
<TE>   Always on the make, at age 21 he escalated his "here today, gone
tomorrow" treatment of women. He fathered a daughter, Patricia, in
1950; never married her mother; and abandoned her as a baby.</TE>
<TE>   His grandmother's death in 1951 revealed just how impotent he was.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't bury her," he says. For years, she had paid
religiously on a burial policy. The premium didn't cover a fifth of
the cost. Duped, she ended her life in a pauper's grave. "I was so
terribly devastated, and still am, by the fact that I could never do
anything for this woman who had sacrificed for me," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He sacrificed for nobody. He married his first wife in 1955, and
he soon abandoned her and his two sons, Kevin and Jacques, a pattern
he would repeat in 1980 with his next daughter, Melissa, and her
mother.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he pursued a singing career that propelled him, song
after song, to New York, through a name change from Williams to
Guillaume, on to musical productions in Europe, where he quickly
picked up the languages, always enunciating perfectly. He performed
on Broadway and finally on television, where he would become famous
not for his singing, but for his acting.</TE>
<TE>   As a servant.</TE>
<TE>   His Benson was anything but servile. He skillfully played the
character without shuffling. John Wesley, then a young actor about to
appear on the show, remembers his advice: "You don't have to spook it
up."</TE>
<TE>   "I had reached," he says, "the confidence not to play old
stereotypes.... I had seen people who could make you laugh without
clowning."</TE>
<TE>   Guillaume is "an African American who was not in an African
American show, but whose work showed that African Americans could be
funny and have dignity," says Steve Newsome, director of the
Anacostia Museum &amp; Center for African American History and Culture,
in a telephone interview from Washington. "Roles, Reaction and
Reality: The Robert Guillaume Collection," which closes Thursday,
displays newspaper articles, reviews, photos, awards, fan mail,
playbills, CDs and costumes spanning his Broadway hits, including
"Guys and Dolls" and "Purlie," his best-known television shows
"Soap," "Benson" and "Sports Night," and his performance in the 1990
L.A. production of "The Phantom of the Opera."</TE>
<TE>   The perceptions of black viewers mattered to Guillaume. In a
conversation with actor-director Robert Townsend, held at the museum
earlier this month to coincide with the opening of the exhibit, he
reflected on concerns that his friends expressed in 1977 about a
black actor playing a butler on an otherwise white television show:
"If I'd done it 10 years earlier, people would have said, 'Get that
guy out of here. He'll set us back 100 years.' "</TE>
<TE>   He didn't. He had the confidence to insist that the socially
mobile Benson rise from butler to lieutenant governor.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, he won an Emmy for best supporting actor in a comedy for
his role as Benson in "Soap." In 1985, he won an Emmy for best actor
in a comedy for his title role in the spinoff "Benson." He was, as
his book recounts, "a bona fide star."</TE>
<TE>   He began to recapture the feelings he had as a child -- that maybe
he was handsome and charming. But where another successful man in his
late 50s might have sought a trophy starlet, he chased an
intellectual trophy, Donna Brown, a Harvard-trained, very independent
KCBS-TV news producer.</TE>
<TE>   She made demands. Get rid of your live-in girlfriend. Get divorced
from a wife you haven't lived with for nearly 40 years. Become
monogamous.</TE>
<TE>   He complied.</TE>
<TE>   What motivated this transformation? His wife's demands? Maturity?
On the last page of his book, he writes: "To assuage bitterness
requires more than human effort. Relief comes from a source we cannot
see but can only feel. I am content to call that source love."</TE>
<TE>   He avoids the therapist's couch, but he thinks he has forgiven his
mother. Forgiving himself for walking away from his older children is
much harder, although he has reconciled with them.</TE>
<TE>   Donna Brown Guillaume says that, with her, he got the nuclear
family he missed as a child. He got family he could count on,
including John Wesley, who became his brother-in-law and, since the
stroke, his frequent companion.</TE>
<TE>   And at age 61, he got another chance at fatherhood. Rachel is now
14.</TE>
<TE>   He's played many roles. He'll play many more. He's rehearsing for
a part as a judge on an NBC replacement show, "A.U.S.A." (assistant
U.S. attorney), scheduled to air in February. He's preparing for a
role as a doctor in the movie "Big Fish," the story of a dying father
and his son, to be directed by Tim Burton for Columbia Pictures. But
today his paramount role is Dad.</TE>
<TE>   "Donna has done things that, 20 years ago, I'd walk. But, I did
decide that the reason for me to stay is Rachel," he says. "I have
more of an appreciation for, simply, the ubiquity of a parent. It's
all well and good to say you love someone, but if that person is not
there, that speaks louder to the child. The child thinks, 'Is there
something about me?' My other children all suffer from that, and I
wanted to spare Rachel, if I could."</TE>

<HD>A fix for fans of Jane's Addiction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Boucher</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're lucky enough to have a ticket for the New Year's Eve show
by Jane's Addiction at the Wiltern, prepare yourself for an
extravagant swirl of an event that uses the lobby as part of its
party stage. "It's what you would expect of Perry," says Adam
Schneider, the band's manager, referring to lead singer Perry
Farrell, who has a penchant for the fiery and the flamboyant.</LD>
<LD>   More than ushering in 2003, the concert also rings in a year that
will see the classic Los Angeles band try to reestablish itself with
its first studio album since 1990.</LD>
<LD>   Jane's reunited in 2001 as a concert concern and, enthused by the
stage success, began working in April on a new album with the
guidance of producer Bob Ezrin (Pink Floyd, KISS, Lou Reed). An album
tentatively titled "Hypersonic" could be in stores by summer.</LD>
<TE>   Billboard has reported that Warner Bros. Records will handle it,
but Schneider said the band is still considering several music
labels.</TE>
<TE>   The lineup has three original members -- Farrell, guitarist Dave
Navarro and drummer Stephen Perkins -- and one new face, bassist
Chris Chaney, best known for his work with Alanis Morissette.
Original Jane's bassist Eric Avery has not joined in the assorted
reunions since the band splintered in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The band's manager says the new efforts mark a return to glory
days. "This album is an absolute Bob Ezrin masterpiece," Schneider
said. "There's the guitar and the feel of the vintage Jane's
sound.... There are radio songs and the songs that will make the fans
of 'Three Days' happy." That reference is a nod to the epic head-rush
of a song that has been a longtime fan favorite. Will the new
material stack up? Tuesday's show will be an early indicator: The
band will be sprinkling the new material in as the clock ticks toward
2003.</TE>

<HD>Sisters track art stolen by Nazis</HD>
<DH>Christie's auction house, citing confidentiality mandates,
refuses to name a client who may possess a painting taken in Austria
in 1940.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Reich</AU>
<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For nearly 60 years, a family of Viennese Holocaust survivors
searched for its looted artworks, to no avail.</LD>
<LD>   But now that the twin sisters carrying on the family quest have
come close to finding one masterpiece, they have been blocked from
attempting to recover it by the confidentiality agreements that are
intrinsic to the private-art business. An appraiser hired by
Christie's auction house believes he saw the painting in the home of
a client, but Christie's refuses to disclose that person's identity,
leaving the sisters frustrated and leading to a court battle.</LD>
<LD>   While auction houses and museums have significantly stepped up
their efforts to identify stolen art in recent years, this family
saga shows how the business practices and legal nuances of the
private-art community still can make it difficult to get information
on a painting with a questionable provenance. For sisters Eva Glaser
and Erika Tauber, who live in Lexington, Mass., the issue is simple:
The painting was stolen, and they should be able to count on
institutions like Christie's to help them. They have filed a "John
Doe" lawsuit against the anonymous holder in U.S. District Court in
Boston and subpoenaed Christie's for information on the holder's
identity.</LD>
<TE>   "If you saw someone stealing something from your neighbor's house,
wouldn't you have to say what you saw?" asked Eva Glaser, 70.
"Wouldn't you want to?" To Christie's, the issue is not so clear-cut.
Its lawyers say the auction house has done all it can to help,
including contacting the collector and informing him that the
painting's ownership may be at issue.</TE>
<TE>   Christie's lawyers also said that the auction house would not
knowingly sell looted art and that in this case it never was in
possession of the missing painting, "View of Canale Grande and
Dogana," an oil by the 18th century Italian master Michele Marieschi
worth close to $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   "While in no way underestimating the seriousness of the claim, we
are not in a position, without the consent of the owner, or an order
from the court, to disclose his identity or the location of a work of
art," Christie's officials said in a statement to the Chicago
Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   Art experts disagree on whether the Christie's position is
ethically sound, though none dispute the legal right of an auction
house to withhold the identity of someone who may possess stolen art.</TE>
<TE>   "Auction houses and dealers almost never give up that kind of
information," said Robert Spiel, a Chicago security consultant who
specialized in cultural theft as an FBI agent.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, contend that auction houses and art dealers ought
to be forthcoming in helping claimants track down art that was
stolen. "It's true that when I hire anyone, I tell them that anything
they learn here is strictly confidential," said Leslie Hindman, a
Chicago gallery owner whose Leslie Hindman Auctioneers was acquired
by Sotheby's in 1997. (Hindman also writes a weekly syndicated column
for the Tribune.)</TE>
<TE>   "But I believe it's in an auction house's best interests to share
information in that kind of a situation," Hindman said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Paul Gray, a noted Chicago art dealer, "If I thought that
there was any reason to believe that locating the work would help to
address some outstanding legal issues, I would share the name of the
person who has the art. But if I believed that locating the work
would make no difference, then I might not reveal the identity of the
person."</TE>
<TE>   The Tribune learned of the case of the missing Marieschi while
investigating the looted art objects of Peter Glaser, Eva Glaser's
husband, and the paper obtained court records and private documents
to re-create the events surrounding the family's search for its
stolen property. In an interview, the appraiser who may have unlocked
the family mystery, Charles Beddington, said the decision by
Christie's to invoke confidentiality has left him powerless.</TE>
<TE>   "I've done all that I can do," said Beddington, reached by
telephone in London, where he runs an art gallery. He is no longer a
Christie's employee but remains a freelance consultant to the auction
house. Beddington said auction houses are unlikely to volunteer
information about possibly stolen art for basic business reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Heinrich "Henry" Graf and his family, including his daughters, Eva
and Erika, fled Vienna on Aug. 30, 1938, leaving all their property
in Austria with Schenker &amp; Co., a storage firm.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the family settled in suburban New York in 1941, the
Grafs had given the Nazis thousands of dollars for the safe return of
their property, family documents show. The Nazis kept the money but
did not return the art or other valuables and heirlooms.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the war, Graf resumed his attempts to reclaim
his property, but Schenker &amp; Co. said Nazis had seized the family's
property. "We would like to inform you that the furnishings of Mr.
Heinrich Graf, engineer, were confiscated by the Secret State Police
[Gestapo] on Nov. 16, 1940," a Schenker official wrote on Feb. 20,
1946. "As far as we know, the furnishings have been sold by public
auction."</TE>
<TE>   Graf's search for the Marieschi might have ended with the letter
about the Gestapo seizure of the art, if not for the fact that the
gallery that sold him the paintings in December 1937 had made a
professional photograph of the Marieschi, and it had survived the
war.</TE>
<TE>   Graf continued his pursuit in vain until his death in 1976 at age
84; his daughters and their husbands picked up where he left off. The
possible identity of the current holder became known to Christie's in
1998, when Beddington, who then worked for Christie's, noticed a
photograph of the Marieschi in an ad in the international edition of
the Art Newspaper, a publication circulated among art professionals
and aficionados.</TE>
<TE>   The ad had been placed by the Art Loss Register, a New York- and
London-based organization that tracks stolen art and often helps
Holocaust survivors locate looted cultural property.</TE>
<TE>   Beddington, an expert in Marieschi, immediately recognized the
painting and believed he had seen it in the French home of a British
entrepreneur in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   But when Beddington asked Christie's if he could be released from
a confidentiality agreement with the auction house and reveal the
name of the holder to the Holocaust survivors, Christie's officials
said no.</TE>
<TE>   Beddington told the family that he received the approval of Edward
Dolman, the managing director of Christie's London office at the
time, to write to the holder of the Marieschi. Dolman now is CEO of
Christie's International. Beddington shared with the family the
contents of his letter to the holder.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that you will not mind me writing to you and will
understand my reason for doing so," Beddington wrote on Aug. 18,
1998.</TE>
<TE>   After explaining that he believed he had seen the painting in the
collector's apartment in France, Beddington continued, "Two American
ladies have given the Art Loss Register convincing evidence that the
picture was taken from their father by the Gestapo in 1940.... As far
as I am aware, you have legal title to the picture, and if so, you
need not feel obliged to take any action. However, in the present
situation the painting might prove difficult to sell, should you ever
wish to do so. The only way to resolve this would be to make some
sort of agreement with the American ladies [offering them part of the
proceeds might obviously be a solution]."</TE>
<TE>   Beddington then met with the sisters. He told them that because he
got no response from the holder, he phoned the man but was brushed
off. Beddington advised the sisters to put pressure on Christie's to
divulge the holder's name, noting that Christie's is a shareholder in
the Art Loss Register and promotes its efforts to help Holocaust
survivors reclaim looted art.</TE>
<TE>   After the sisters' attorneys, Palmer &amp; Dodge of Boston, wrote to
Christie's and asserted that the auction house "has shielded the
identity of the current holder of the painting," Christie's attorneys
responded that the house would not disclose the holder's name without
a court order. Moreover, Christie's asserted that no such order could
be made by a U.S. court. "The information that you are seeking is not
in possession of either the Boston office of Christie's, or of anyone
at Christie's Inc.," wrote Jo Backer Laird, senior vice president and
general counsel of the auction house, in response to the Boston
subpoena issued by the sisters' attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   "Such information as Christie's has is solely located in the
United Kingdom," continued the letter. "Therefore, without waiving
any arguments we may have as to jurisdiction, including arguments
relating to the service of the subpoena, Christie's Inc.'s response
to the subpoena is that we have no responsive documents or
information."</TE>
<TE>   The sisters estimate they have spent $50,000 on attorney fees in
Boston and London, a private investigator in London and a new round
of ads featuring the photograph of the Marieschi in the Art
Newspaper. But they said they feel stymied by the position of
Christie's.</TE>
<TE>   "We are sort of trapped by the way the art world seems to work,"
said Erika Tauber, 70. "Apparently it's OK to keep a secret about a
stolen work of art, something that was taken during the Holocaust,
while the Nazis were trying to kill us."</TE>

<HD>The man with the dangerous mind returns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roy Rivenburg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After two decades of self-imposed exile in southern France, the
curly-haired creature who brought us "The Gong Show," "The Newlywed
Game" and other TV schlock is back.</LD>
<LD>   Chuck Barris sinks into a stuffed chair in his Beverly Hills hotel
room and marvels at the turn of events. "Two years ago, I was sitting
in Columbia-Presbyterian hospital in New York with lung cancer," he
says. His second marriage was over, he had just buried his mother and
his own life seemed to be slipping away.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the 73-year-old game-show mogul is remarried (to a
43-year-old ex-model), embarking on a singing career, writing his
fourth book and basking in the publicity surrounding "Confessions of
a Dangerous Mind," the film based on his bizarre memoir about being a
CIA assassin.</LD>
<TE>   "Who would've guessed it?" says Barris, whose 1970s-era wide
lapels and big bow tie have given way to a suede jacket, jeans and
granny glasses. "Everything is brand new."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Barris is haunted by the past. He blames himself in the death
of his adult daughter in 1998. He frets that the only accomplishment
he'll be remembered for is "The Gong Show." And he's still wounded by
the lambasting his TV shows endured more than 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Although such fare as "The Dating Game" and "The $1.98 Beauty
Show" might seem tame by today's standards, critics of the era
derided them as trashy and demeaning to contestants.</TE>
<TE>   "I took the criticism so hard," says Barris, who intended the
shows as nothing more than good fun. "I don't know if I'll ever get
over it."</TE>
<TE>   But he did devise an intriguing response. In the early 1980s, he
pulled the plug on his television empire, barricaded himself inside a
Wyndham Hotel suite and penned "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind: An
Unauthorized Autobiography."</TE>
<TE>   In it, Barris made the astonishing claim that while he was being
"crucified" by critics for "polluting the airwaves with mind-numbing
puerile entertainment," he was simultaneously receiving presidential
citations for his work as an undercover CIA assassin. He said some of
the killings were carried out while he chaperoned winning "Dating
Game" couples to such destinations as "romantic West Berlin."</TE>
<TE>   Could it possibly be true?</TE>
<TE>   In a media kit for the film version of "Confessions," which opens
Tuesday, director George Clooney says, "There is something shockingly
fascinating about someone of his wealth and fame who would want to
say this about himself.... Whether it's true or not is in Chuck's
head.... I've asked [him] about the specifics of the story, and he
would look me in the eyes and not say anything."</TE>
<TE>   Barris is equally mysterious with reporters. Although he admits
that one of his other books, the 1974 bestseller "You and Me, Babe,"
was a fictionalized account of his first marriage, when he is asked
how much of "Confessions" is fantasy, he says, "I'll never answer
that question."</TE>
<TE>   Even his wife, Mary, is evasive. "After I met Chuck, I read the
book and I didn't really place any judgment on it one way or the
other. Chuck and I never talk about whether he really did it."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Virginia, CIA officials seem amused by the saga. "It
sounds like he might have been standing too close to the gong all
those years," says CIA spokesman Tom Crispell. "Chuck Barris has
never been employed by the CIA. And the allegation that he was a
hired assassin is absurd."</TE>
<TE>   Barris waves off the rebuttal, saying: "Have you ever heard the
CIA acknowledge someone was an assassin?" To skeptics, he adds,
"Believe what you want. I wrote the book and that's how I felt when I
wrote it."</TE>
<TE>   The CIA story isn't the only questionable claim he makes. There's
also the matter of who created "The Dating Game." In "Confessions,"
Barris takes full credit for the idea. But a 1980 Times article
indicates someone else might have been involved. While discussing
lawsuits over Barris shows that were "created or co-created by
others," his sidekick Budd Granoff acknowledged that Barris' company
settled a suit out of court around 1970 regarding creation of "The
Dating Game."</TE>
<TE>   When asked for details last week, Barris declined through his
publicist to comment.</TE>
<TE>   But even if some aspects of his newly reissued autobiography are
embellished, Barris' story is still remarkable. The son of a
Philadelphia dentist, he reportedly held jobs as a TelePrompTer
salesman, steelworker, songwriter (Freddie Cannon's 1962 hit
"Palisades Park" is credited to him) and NBC tour guide before
climbing the food chain at ABC and finally forming his own production
company. In 1965, he launched "The Dating Game," which revolutionized
TV game shows. Next came "The Newlywed Game," "The Game Game" and a
Mama Cass special, among others.</TE>
<TE>   "Those were the happiest days of my life," Barris says. "It was
Camelot."</TE>
<TE>   A 1969 Times article described his company as "a swinging, with-it
outfit" staffed by "super-cool chicks in miniskirts clacking away on
typewriters." The office walls were "a freaky collage of pop-hippie
art," and Barris sported "a groovy mod haircut."</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, in 1976, he debuted his signature program, "The
Gong Show," a wacky amateur talent contest that featured such acts as
the Unknown Comic (a guy with a bag over his head), Gene Gene the
Dancing Machine and a woman who whistled "I'm Looking Over a
Four-Leaf Clover" through her nose. Barris emceed the shenanigans,
and such luminaries as David Letterman and Jaye P. Morgan served as
judges. When an act was really lame, the panelists clanged a huge
gong to get them offstage.</TE>
<TE>   The secret to Barris' success, wrote Maxene Fabe in "TV Game
Shows," was that he was "the first man in America to realize how
desperately 'ordinary' people want to be on television."</TE>
<TE>   Today, he has mixed feelings about the show. "It was four years of
total fun," he says, but it also consumed his life. "It was all I
did, seven days a week," and there was a casualty: his daughter,
Della, who was a teen when "The Gong Show" began.</TE>
<TE>   Barris, who took custody of Della after divorcing his first wife,
had enrolled her in a private school. "But she wanted to go to
Beverly Hills High, and I let her," he recalls. "She got lost. I
wasn't giving her the proper ... "</TE>
<TE>   His voice trails off.</TE>
<TE>   In high school, Della got involved in drugs and Barris didn't know
what to do. He took her to psychiatrists and finally settled on a
"tough love" approach.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't work. You lose 'em and they rarely come back."</TE>
<TE>   Della left home at age 16 and never beat her drug problem, he
says. In 1998, Barris flew out from New York for one of his periodic
visits with her, only to get a message upon arriving that she had
just died of an overdose. "I was absolutely floored," he says.</TE>
<TE>   One of his most painful memories is of taking Della to a "Gong
Show Movie" screening in 1980. "When she came on the screen [Della
had been an occasional guest on the show], the audience booed,"
Barris says. "She ran out of the theater."</TE>
<TE>   Barris soon made an escape of his own. After his film tanked at
the box office, he gonged himself off the public stage. "I figured I
didn't have my finger on the pulse of what's going on anymore, so I
took off," he says. His shows were getting canceled, critics were
hammering him, and so he moved to St. Tropez, France, with his future
second wife, Robin Altman. He later sold his TV business to a
conglomerate that manufactured cement.</TE>
<TE>   "They say if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.
Well, I got out of the kitchen and went to France, but I should've
stayed. It was a big, big mistake."</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was ready to make a comeback in the 1990s, TV
executives regarded him as a dinosaur. They might be right, he
concedes. Although some critics consider him the godfather of modern
shows like "Fear Factor" and "Survivor," Barris insists he "couldn't
think of those shows if you put a gun to my head."</TE>
<TE>   He believes game shows are on a path he's no longer attuned to. "I
believe we're going to eventually have somebody killed on TV," he
says. "They're already showing autopsies on TV in London. There is no
end to how low TV will go to get an audience."</TE>
<TE>   So Barris has turned to other projects. Dividing his time between
an apartment in Manhattan and a stone cottage on the Hudson River in
Sneden's Landing, N.Y., he is finishing the sequel to his CIA memoir,
tentatively titled "Bad Grass Never Dies: More Confessions of a
Dangerous Mind."</TE>
<TE>   Barris also serves on the New York Police Foundation's board. And
he recently taped some public service ads for lung cancer prevention.
Noting that his own tumor was detected during a CAT scan of a
shoulder injury, Barris "begs people" to get checkups: "If you see
cancer on a lung X-ray, it's too late. CAT scans can find it early."</TE>
<TE>   But most of his attention has been focused on the filming of his
autobiography. Barris met with actors, faxed memos to the producer
("I have fax-itis," he says) and played a cameo as himself. He is
thrilled with the final product. "I sure wish Della could have seen
this movie," he says wistfully. "She would've loved it."</TE>
<TE>   Barris' other new venture is singing. "I was thinking, what can I
do to take advantage of this wave of publicity [for the movie]," he
says. "So I got all the 'Gong Show' musicians together and we cut a
CD."</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't landed a record contract yet, but he did perform at New
York's Carnegie Hall as part of a benefit concert. "I've never been
so scared in my life," he says of the moment before going onstage. "I
couldn't breathe."</TE>
<TE>   But the audience was great, he says: "The applause after the first
song, there's nothing like it.... It was the most memorable moment of
my life. If they ask me to play next year, I won't do it because
nothing will beat that."</TE>
<TE>   Plus, he knows adulation can be fleeting.</TE>
<TE>   "My life has always been ups and downs. This is all going to be
gone in a month or two and we'll just go back to enjoying simple
things again -- books, movies, dinner with friends, fixing up our
little house."</TE>
<TE>   And how would he like to be remembered when his time is up? Not
the way he knows he will be.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been second," he says. "I've created hit TV shows,
but nothing has been great. I've written rock songs, but I'm not a
big music star. I've penned a bestselling book, but I'm not Hemingway
or Fitzgerald. I've never saved any lives. It's just
middle-of-the-road greatness. So I know what my legacy will be. It's
'The Gong Show' and that's a shame. It's not the legacy I want to
have. It gave the impression of me being a clown, a court jester.
None of that's true."</TE>
<TE>   His big fear, he admits, is that the headline on his obituary will
say, "Barris gets gonged."</TE>
<TE>   But he's not wild about being remembered as a CIA gunman, either.
"The persona of me in the movie is 180 degrees from the real me," he
says. "I'm quiet and well-read."</TE>
<TE>   Meeting Barris in person, it's hard to imagine him as the central
character in his book -- a raunchy, cold-blooded assassin who kicks
his dog, uses women and spends thousands of dollars on abortions for
his girlfriends.</TE>
<TE>   Receiving visitors in his Beverly Hills hotel room, he comes
across as serious and reflective.</TE>
<TE>   So, if he could go back in time, would he pass on "The Gong Show"?
"No, I would do it all again. If you gave me a choice to go back and
erase all that, I'd hate to lose the good times."</TE>

<LD>It's not as if Sam Rockwell wasn't prepared. He had read game-show
icon Chuck Barris' "unauthorized autobiography," "Confessions of a
Dangerous Mind." He had gone over the script for the movie based on
it a million times, it seemed. He watched old "Gong Show" tapes,
including rehearsal tapes, to hone Barris' Philly accent and
alternately authoritative and nebbishy mannerisms. Still, when it
came time to shoot, the pressure was nerve-racking, Rockwell says.
"It's one thing to do 'Hamlet' in your garage, and another thing to
do it on Broadway," he says.</LD>
<LD>   Playing Barris -- the violent, lewd and strangely likable "Gong
Show" host who claims he assassinated 33 people for the CIA -- is the
highest-profile role of his low-profile career. Hollywood has been
talking about the movie, scripted by screenwriter-of-the-hour Charlie
Kaufman ("Adaptation"), for at least four years. Megastar George
Clooney was directing for the first time. Nearly a dozen bigger-name
stars, from Johnny Depp to Sean Penn to Mike Myers, wanted the chance
to play Barris.</LD>
<LD>   Now it appears that "Confessions" could be a career watershed for
Rockwell, 34, known to friends as the archetypal "actor's actor."
Trained in theater and in stand-up comedy, he lives in New York and,
friends joke, spends more money on therapy than on rent.</LD>
<TE>   Even after 14 years in the business, Rockwell recently won
Movieline's Breakthrough Award for a "career launching" performance.
He has even landed on some long lists of Oscar hopefuls.</TE>
<TE>   Barely known outside Hollywood, Rockwell is familiar to many
producers, directors and other actors for his believable eccentrics
in small independent films: the free-spirited backwoodsman in "Box of
Moonlight" (1996), the trailer-trash exhibitionist in "Lawn Dogs"
(1997) and the inept safecracker in "Safe Men" (1998). In the last
three years, mainstream audiences have begun to recognize his small,
scene-stealing parts in big studio films: a psychopathic prisoner,
cowardly nerd and evil con man in, respectively, "The Green Mile"
(1999), "Galaxy Quest" (1999) and "Charlie's Angels" (2000).</TE>
<TE>   "No one can deny he's a major talent," says casting director
Deborah Zane, who directed producers of "Galaxy Quest" to Rockwell.
"I put him on any list I can. The main thing is that his acting is so
seamless. It's hard to catch him acting, whether he's playing a dope,
an idiot, someone terrified or charming." As a stage-trained actor
and comic, he is also highly disciplined, says director Ridley Scott,
who cast Rockwell in "Matchstick Men" (to be released next year) as a
protege of con man Nicolas Cage. "He comes prepared, like an
athlete."</TE>
<TE>   The only problem is that he's been an unproven commodity as the
lead in a big-budget film, and Zane says "studios still tend to get
hung up on the box office." In the case of "Confessions," Clooney
held out for Rockwell, with whom he had worked in this year's
disappointing "Welcome to Collingwood."</TE>
<TE>   Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein "didn't want someone who's not
well-known in the lead in a $30-million film," Clooney says. Part of
the deal was that Rockwell be backed up with more bankable actors
Julia Roberts and Drew Barrymore, who play his love interests.
Clooney himself had already signed on to play a CIA agent.</TE>
<TE>   By studying old "Gong Show" tapes and talking with Barris, who
consulted on the set, Rockwell mastered every detail of Barris'
mannerisms -- the hand clapping, the head tousling, the squinting at
the cue cards and the high, raspy voice. Barris, Rockwell says, had
stage fright and psychosomatic asthma when he hosted "The Gong Show."
He squinted at the cards because he'd forget his glasses.</TE>
<TE>   Early this month, when director Mike Nichols hosted a New York
screening, Weinstein witnessed firsthand the audience's enthusiastic
response. "He said, 'Tell Sam to put a suit on,' " as Clooney puts
it. "He [Weinstein] went into sell mode."</TE>
<TE>   A wiry 5-foot-9, Rockwell is cleanshaven, tousled and a little
lost in his roomy suit. He has a winning, streetwise smile and a
take-it-easy attitude toward those who want to call him a rising
star.</TE>
<TE>   He is grateful to Clooney for having the faith in his talent to
fight for him. "It's rare that somebody goes to bat for you in that
way. It's a very courageous thing, and in this business, it's really
rare. I could almost use the word 'noble.' "</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Clooney says, "I had the right actor in the right
role." Rockwell, he says, "looks exactly like Chuck, which helps.
He's the right age. Just simply, he's one of those actors all actors
know about and like. He steals movies."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Rockwell won over even Barris, who had initially
pushed for Robert Downey Jr., Edward Norton or Depp to play him in
the film. Barris, now 73 and living in New York, says he was
astounded by Rockwell's performance. "At the end of the movie when he
portrays me having a quasi-nervous breakdown on the set [of 'The Gong
Show'], it was stunning," he says. "I could feel that same feeling I
had."</TE>
<TE>   Toughest playing himself</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, the scary part," says Rockwell, having just been warned that
the conversation is about to turn personal.</TE>
<TE>   He already felt the surprise of media exposure in 1996 after the
indie success of "Box of Moonlight." Rockwell now regrets some things
he said to the press then, like naming starlets he might want to date
and not clarifying his upbringing -- a bicoastal custody arrangement
between his remarried father in San Francisco and his bohemian
actress mother in New York. He compares his relationship with his
mother to the one "that Cher has in 'Mask' with her kid, Eric Stolz."
When he visited in the summer as a 10-year-old, they smoked pot
together and he acted in her company, "Joan Crawford's Children," on
the Lower East Side.</TE>
<TE>   "Smoking dope and being treated as an adult is good and bad," he
says. "Bad in that boundaries are crossed and there's nothing to
rebel against. Good in a 'Confederacy of Dunces' kind of way. It
prepared me."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he adds, "I'm talking about a sip of Budweiser. A hit of
a joint. I wouldn't go crazy with that one."</TE>
<TE>   His friend Leif Tilden says Rockwell's charisma was apparent 12
years ago when they first met as actors on the set of "Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles," in which Rockwell played the head thug.</TE>
<TE>   Rockwell frustrates girls who are attracted to him, Tilden says.
"He's still working on himself. He's not ready." The only character
Rockwell doesn't have a grasp of is himself, Tilden says.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his anxieties, Rockwell says he can be confident when
necessary. When he interviewed for the role of junior con man Jimmy
Silk in last year's "Heist," he says director David Mamet told him he
needed a guy who could steal a girl from Gene Hackman. "I said, 'I
can do that!' I was terrified. I didn't know if I could do it. The
character's cocky, so I had to be sort of cocky to get the job."</TE>
<TE>   One thing Rockwell has learned, he says, is that an actor can't
care too much during an audition. "That will kill you. They smell it
on you. They smell desperation," Rockwell says. He believes acting is
a science, but one in which the unconscious does the homework. Done
properly, dancing, he says, is one way to unleash impulse and
spontaneity and let them rule. To calm himself on the set of
"Confessions," he brought a boombox to the set, turned on James Brown
and danced before takes. He did some clogging on the set of "The
Green Mile"; under a shaded canopy amid the lunchers and waiters,
Rockwell stands up in his suit and pointy shoes and demonstrates.</TE>
<TE>   Rockwell knows he's not a star yet, but he's already thinking
about how he'll deal with the rest of his allotted 15 minutes. All
sorts of scripts are coming to him now -- many, he says bemusedly,
that cast him in ethnic roles. What he wants are the sort of
leading-man roles that Clooney gets.</TE>
<TE>   He knows his unconventional Irish-German good looks aren't
traditional matinee star like Clooney's, and he says, "I don't think
I will ever be as famous as George. I don't think I have that
quality. In a more offbeat way, I could be like the more
unconventional leading men of the '70s." He ticks off his favorites:
Dustin Hoffman, Hackman, Jon Voight, Jeff Bridges, and newer stars he
compares himself with: Kevin Spacey, Ben Stiller, Billy Crudup, Steve
Zahn.</TE>
<TE>   He knows he's ready to move on from comedy, he says. "I'm looking
more for something like 'Taxi Driver.' "</TE>

<HD>'Love Liza,' a shifting ride of emotions</HD>
<DH>Hoffman handles well the challenging role of a man whose
life goes haywire after tragedy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the 34 -- yes, 34 -- films Philip Seymour Hoffman has made in the
past dozen years, he has established himself as one of the movies'
most distinctive and versatile young character actors. Pale and
freckled, with longish red hair and a decided paunch, Hoffman
automatically stands out, especially in contrast to classic
leading-man types. He was part of the extraordinary "Magnolia"
ensemble, played a gutsy drag queen opposite a macho Robert De Niro
in "Flawless" and was the hapless gay guy with unrequited love for
Mark Wahlberg's porn star in "Boogie Nights."</LD>
<LD>   With "Love Liza" he moves up to undisputed above-the-title star,
and he's up to the challenge; Hoffman holds the screen with ease and
confidence in what is a terrifically tough film to watch. "Dark and
demanding" doesn't begin to describe this devastating film, which
holds out the possibility of redemption and rebirth on the slenderest
of threads.</LD>
<LD>   The setting is Mobile, Ala., where Hoffman's Wilson is a
successful Web site designer who lives with his beloved, beautiful
wife, Liza, in a spacious suburban home. Wilson seems a droll, happy
man until he comes home and discovers that Liza has committed suicide
in a particularly horrible fashion. She has left him a note, but he
cannot bear to read it.</LD>
<TE>   Actor turned director Todd Louiso, in a fearless feature debut,
and writer Gordy Hoffman, who wrote the script for himself but
deferred to his brother, make Wilson's inability to bring himself to
read his wife's suicide note the driving force of the entire film.
Liza's death has hit Wilson with the force of an 18-wheeler, and as
the shock of her perplexing suicide gradually starts waning, the
magnitude of his loss becomes ever clearer to him, leaving him
reeling all the more from its impact. Inevitably, his life and career
disintegrate, and he becomes derelict and inconsolable in his grief.
Even as he becomes enveloped in his pain, he tries, despite erratic
outbursts, to make occasional efforts to be polite and grateful to
those who try to reach out to him.</TE>
<TE>   In seeking escape from the black hole his life has become, Wilson
falls into sniffing gasoline, and a desperate attempt to hide his new
habit inadvertently leads him to a new and unexpected passion --
remote control model planes and the friendship of a kindly aficionado
(Jack Kehler). There are moments when Wilson's spirits soar like
those miniature aircraft. "Love Liza" proceeds episodically,
mirroring Wilson's shifting moods, but the filmmakers' ramblings
prove deceptive, for in its indirect way the film is all the while
building to a climactic moment. Determinedly modest in tone, "Love
Liza" is a fiercely brave and honest work.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson is a big, all-over-the-place role, and Hoffman has more
than enough talent, range and discipline to fill it fully. Hoffman is
not afraid to show how self-indulgent all-consuming grief can become.
Lisa Rinzler's low-key cinematography is in keeping with the film's
unpretentious tone.</TE>
<TE>   For all his rightful dominance in the film, Wilson is not the
whole story, and the filmmakers have surrounded Hoffman with a
stellar supporting cast of actors as individual as he is. Kehler is
the ultimate good guy, yet even he has his limits; Sarah Koskoff is
Wilson's concerned yet overly attentive boss; Stephen Tobolowsky
plays another kindly man who tries to give Wilson a second chance
professionally; and, best of all, Kathy Bates plays Wilson's
distraught mother-in-law, confounded and stunned by her daughter's
death and exasperated by Wilson's refusal to open the letter and his
increasingly irresponsible behavior. Louiso melds all these
exceptional actors into a seamless ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   The look and feel of the film is deliberately and effectively
artless, the better to set off Wilson and his grappling with a tragic
loss. Mercifully, "Love Liza" is not without humor and is boosted by
Jim O'Rourke's score and its use of songs that not only echo Wilson's
mercurial moods but also sometimes effectively counterpoint them. It
is not too much to say that without its splendid use of music "Love
Liza" might not be bearable.</TE>

<HD>'Port Charles' struggling to find audience as Saga No. 10
unfolds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Sachs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wedding bells are ringing today in "Port Charles," the
ratings-challenged ABC soap opera that has left virtually no plot
device unexplored in an increasingly desperate struggle to find an
audience.</LD>
<LD>   Since spinning off from genre heavyweight "General Hospital" in
1997, the show has gone from dealing with some of the familiar
soap-opera motifs, such as illicit affairs, evil twins and split
personalities, into strange new realms inhabited by demons, angels
and even vampires, but to little avail. The show's ratings are
routinely half that of "General Hospital," which usually finds itself
runner-up to "The Young and the Restless" for daytime dominance.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, "Port Charles" even dumped the traditionally loose
soap pattern of employing story lines that twist and turn but stretch
into infinity. The show's creators opted for a structure taken from
the popular Spanish-language telenovelas, in which the stories unfold
in 12-week arcs, or books, within which a number of plot points have
their beginning and end.</LD>
<TE>   So after today's regularly scheduled "Port Charles" episode airing
at 11:30 a.m., closing out the Book 9 "Naked Eyes" era, Book 10 gets
launched with a special one-hour show at 1 p.m., following the old
ABC warhorse "All My Children."</TE>
<TE>   The first installment of the new story arc, titled "Surrender,"
was directed by Scott McKinsey from a script by Barbara Esensten,
James Harman Brown and Barbara Bloom. The centerpiece is the
scheduled wedding of Rafe Kovich (Brian Gaskill) and Alison
Barrington (Erin Hershey), two of the nicest folks in town and a pair
who who would seem to truly deserve each other.</TE>
<TE>   But if there was ever a kiss of death in soap operas, that might
be it, so fasten your seat belts.</TE>

<LD>Here's an easy assignment: write about writer's block. Nothing to it.
Story can write itself. There's no easier assignment for a writer
than to write about any aspect of writing. This just happens to be
about writer's block. Nothing to it. Story can write itself. Here
goes. Here goes the story about writer's block. (Clever readers are
asking themselves: Is this a writer pretending to have writer's block
or a writer really having writer's block and stalling for time? A
fascinating question. A dandy of a question. Don't you just love that
question?) Here goes again: a story about writer's block. Any second
now.</LD>
<LD>   When stalled, tap the dictionary. The American Heritage Dictionary
defines writer's block as "a usually temporary psychological
inability to begin or continue work on a piece of writing." Well,
that was good for a paragraph.</LD>
<LD>   Any story about writer's block must include quotes from famous
writers who said famous things about "the utter pain of blank," as
poet Emily Dickinson termed it. Poet Philip Larkin dubbed himself
"the world-famous unable-to-write poet." The American novelist John
Steinbeck advised, "write as though you are writing to your sister or
someone you love. Write 'dear.' It unlocks you a bit."</LD>
<TE>   Dear, this story should also mention a movie recently opened:
"Adaptation." Nicolas Cage plays the screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman of
"Being John Malkovich" fame. He's struggling to adapt writer Susan
Orlean's book, "The Orchid Thief" (Ballantine Books, January 2000),
into a screenplay. He does not know how to write a screenplay about
flowers. He sweats a lot and talks to himself even more. Rather than
write, he daydreams. Initially, Cage's character can't find the heart
of Orlean's story, which is about finding a singular passion for
something, anything.</TE>
<TE>   Many movies have dealt with writer's block. Woody Allen's main
character in "Deconstructing Harry" suffers a severe case of writer's
block. Audiences, however, were already suffering from "Woody Allen
block," which prevented them from wanting to see another Woody Allen
movie. No one, though, seems to suffer Jack Nicholson block.
Nicholson's character in "The Shining" has a touch o' the block. He
takes his family to a secluded hotel, where he slaves away at his
typewriter. His wife finally peeks at his manuscript: pages and pages
with only this typed: "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."
She is alarmed by his lack of progress, then becomes increasingly
concerned when he fails to shave and goes at her with an ax.
Audiences can still relate.</TE>
<TE>   The Coen brothers, makers of fine quirky movies, produced their
homage to writer's block in "Barton Fink." Barton is holed up in
another creepy hotel and can't write a paragraph to save his sanity.
"I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that
lets you get started, I still haven't gotten it," the character says.
"Maybe I only had one idea in me." Fear -- that's the rub. Writers
often fear their writing isn't any good. They fear their best work is
behind them, waving at them in the rearview mirror and laughing. In
this blocked state, writers are easily distracted. Instead of
writing, they turn to household chores. Housework gives them a reason
to live.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes of great literature have been writers battling
great periods of creative dormancy. William Shakespeare's writer's
block was memorably featured in the movie "Shakespeare in Love."
Ernest Hemingway, Joseph Conrad, Mark Twain (so blocked he left the
country), Dashiell Hammett, Agatha Christie, E.B. White (crippling
"non-writing jags") and Truman Capote had bouts of writer's block.
Capote! He kept readers waiting for about a decade for "Answered
Prayers," which he never completed. The book haunted him. In Gerald
Clarke's "Capote" (Linden, 1990), the biographer ends the book with
Capote's dying thoughts: "He continued to talk, about his mother
mostly, but also about his writing and 'Answered Prayers.' " Some
books, perhaps, resist completion for the right reasons.</TE>
<TE>   J.K. Rowling admitted to having writer's block while writing
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" (Scholastic, June 1999) the
follow-up to her colossal debut. "I was scared the second book
wouldn't measure up, but I got through it," Rowling said in a
newspaper interview. Some Potter fans have wondered this year whether
writer's block is to blame for the absence of the fifth book in the
series.</TE>
<TE>   Some writers say writer's block is a crock. Anthony Burgess,
author of "A Clockwork Orange" (W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1987), said he
never had writer's block. "That would be rather like a cobbler having
cobbler's block, wouldn't it?" True, writer's block must sound like
an artsy, feeble excuse to the rest of the world. Imagine a
professional athlete, say, Baltimore Ravens offensive lineman and
former UCLA All-American Jonathan Ogden. Do you think he gets
blocker's block? Imagine him saying, "I feel a temporary
psychological inability to block."</TE>
<TE>   Best-selling author Tom Clancy called writer's block "pure
laziness." In a 1994 newspaper article, Clancy said, "The writer with
writer's block doesn't want to write." Robert Ludlum said he
researches books for three months, writes the book in 15 months and
gets writer's block for "11 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   But Sue Grafton, author of the popular alphabet mystery series,
told an interviewer that she loves writer's block because it means
something is trying to get her attention, to make her work and think
harder. She says it's a writer's ego acting selfishly, as usual.</TE>
<TE>   We're getting to the end. But this story did not write itself. It
took three days, on and off, on and off, on again. There were coffee
breaks and popcorn and that incessant voice saying, "There is nothing
original to be said about writer's block, so give up, son. Go ahead,
lean on a movie, the dictionary, what famous people said about the
subject. Don't stop yet. Think harder about a singular passion." This
story, too, must be about a passion for one simple thing.</TE>

<HD>Low-Emission Biodiesel Is Gaining Mainstream Attention</HD>
<DH>Made from restaurant grease or vegetable oil, the fuel
works in most diesel engines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen Gaudette</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Surrounded by a pack of tail-wagging dogs, Dave Hawley of Ukiah stuck
his bearded face up to the exhaust pipe of his delivery truck, closed
his eyes and inhaled.</LD>
<LD>   Hawley is hooked on biodiesel, a low-emission fuel gleaned from
restaurant grease or the oil of crops such as soybeans.</LD>
<LD>   Biodiesel is the fastest-growing alternative fuel in the country,
according to the National Biodiesel Board, which touts its ability to
extend engine life, improve fuel economy, cut down on air pollution
and reduce reliance on foreign oil.</LD>
<TE>   It has been in use in Europe for some 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   But biodiesel is more expensive than traditional diesel -- at
least 30% more at one point last summer.</TE>
<TE>   To lower costs, lawmakers have proposed tax incentives for using
biodiesel, but Congress adjourned for the session without acting on
the bills.</TE>
<TE>   "If it were the same price, I think we would see use expand
dramatically," said Jenna Higgins, spokeswoman for the biodiesel
board, a trade group affiliated with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   Biodiesel releases less carbon monoxide and fewer hydrocarbons and
particles than petroleum-based diesel, according to the Environmental
Protection Agency. It works with most diesel engines.</TE>
<TE>   Hawley's so sold on it, he's even sipped the amber-colored liquid
to demonstrate its low toxicity to the 100-plus customers of his
Yokayo Biofuels firm in Ukiah, Calif. Customers include farmers,
California wineries and a fleet of coffee delivery trucks.</TE>
<TE>   "It really just gives people a way not to live with hypocrisy,"
Hawley said outside the garage where he and business partner Kumar
Plocher experiment with batches of lye, wood or grain alcohol and
various vegetable oils.</TE>
<TE>   Biodiesel is produced by blending lye, methanol or ethanol and
oil, then letting it settle. Glycerin, a soap ingredient, separates
from biodiesel in large vats.</TE>
<TE>   Plocher and Hawley might even add essential oils so tailpipes will
spew the scent of lavender, rosemary or sage.</TE>
<TE>   Yokayo distributes 13,000 gallons of biodiesel a month -- enough
to rank as one of the country's largest independent distributors in
this small but growing industry, which now has annual sales of about
$25 million, according to the National Biodiesel Board.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Piper, director of vineyard operations for Fetzer Vineyards,
one of California's 10 largest wineries, has powered tractors and
other farm equipment with biodiesel for the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "They're running great, absolutely no difference," Piper said.</TE>
<TE>   Except for the price.</TE>
<TE>   In its most common form, biodiesel is sold in a mixture of 80%
petroleum-based diesel and 20% biodiesel.</TE>
<TE>   Because of growing demand and relatively few suppliers, a gallon
of the 80-20 blend cost $1.79 on the West Coast in July, compared
with $1.38 for a gallon of petrodiesel, according to the Department
of Energy. Pure biodiesel costs even more.</TE>
<TE>   But many conservationists say they don't mind paying more for
cleaner fuel, and federal pollution regulations also are providing an
incentive for managers of fleets. The U.S. Postal Service, for
instance, has used biodiesel at several locations, including San
Francisco, Miami and New York.</TE>
<TE>   Higgins said biodiesel has grown quickly in use because it
generally works with any diesel engine made after 1992. She said
older engines need only slight modifications -- many have parts made
with natural rubber, which could interact adversely with biodiesel.</TE>
<TE>   Other fuel alternatives, such as natural gas and propane, need
special equipment or more extensive modifications.</TE>
<TE>   Though biodiesel, like one form of traditional diesel, has a
tendency to coagulate at colder temperatures, producers and
distributors can add anti-jell substances to prevent that.</TE>
<TE>   Diesel's roots are organic. Rudolph Diesel, the German engineer
whose engine concept published in 1893 eventually bore his name,
fueled his prototype with peanut oil. But such oils lost sway when
petroleum-based fuel became cheaper and more plentiful.</TE>
<TE>   Biodiesel producers are hoping for an organic comeback.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. production of biodiesel is expected to grow to more than 20
million gallons this year and as much as 40 million gallons in 2003,
according to the biodiesel board. Soybean oil accounted for 90% of
the material used to produce biodiesel in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Hawley and Plocher say they're already turning a modest profit and
plan to open biodiesel filling stations in Ukiah and Santa Rosa,
Calif., in the next few months, complete with a convenience store
stocked with organic products.</TE>
<TE>   They also hope to persuade other biodiesel peddlers to open in
other parts of California to encourage more use.</TE>
<TE>   "The beauty of biodiesel, in my opinion, is it comes from plants,"
Plocher said. "It's part of an active cycle."</TE>

<HD>Gilmore Completes Farmers Market Addition</HD>
<DH>The new North Market brings office space to the site for
the first time in its 69-year history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roger Vincent</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Through the decades, it has been home to such diverse enterprises as
dairy farming, drive-in movies and professional baseball.</LD>
<LD>   But after a four-year construction binge that transformed the
property into one of the city's top retail draws, the Farmers Market
is inviting yet another kind of customer: office tenants.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles institution at 3rd Street and Fairfax Avenue this
month completed an addition called North Market. The new complex
includes 60,000 square feet of office space, a new home for Gilmore
Bank and 30,000 square feet of retail space. It's the first time that
offices have been available to rent on the site in its 69-year
history.</LD>
<TE>   The latest improvements began in 1998 when A.F. Gilmore Co. -- a
family-owned real estate enterprise run by descendants of the
property's original owner -- and Caruso Affiliated Holdings announced
plans to build the Grove at Farmers Market.</TE>
<TE>   The 640,000-square-foot open-air shopping center, as well as four
new Farmers Market buildings and a new plaza housing the restored
Farmers Market clock tower, opened last March. The cost of North
Market and the other Gilmore additions was $45 million, said A.F.
Gilmore Vice President Mark Panatier.</TE>
<TE>   The Gilmore Bank building, constructed in 1955, was razed to make
way for the Grove, and the one-branch community bank operated from
temporary quarters nearby until North Market was completed.</TE>
<TE>   Retail tenants in the project include Organized Living, a Kansas
City-based retailer that sells organizational tools such as shelving,
racks and containers, and beauty supply store Beauty Collection
Apothecary. An accompanying salon and spa, Elements, is set to open
there next year, as is a Fazio Cleaners.</TE>
<TE>   North Market sits on a site rich in Los Angeles history.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers Market dates to 1934, when a contingent of farmers pulled
their trucks onto an expanse of empty land at the corner of 3rd and
Fairfax. The property has been in the Gilmore family since 1880, when
Illinois immigrant and rancher Arthur Fremont Gilmore took control of
a 256-acre dairy farm.</TE>
<TE>   Drilling for water at the turn of the last century, Gilmore
instead struck oil. By 1905, the dairy farm was gone and Gilmore Oil
was on its way to becoming one of the largest petroleum distributors
in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other enterprises that have taken root on the property
over the years was the Gilmore Drive-In, an outdoor theater that
included several rows of benches so neighbors could walk in and see a
movie. The Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League played
professional baseball at Gilmore Field for decades and engaged in a
spirited cross-town rivalry with the Los Angeles Angels, who played
at Wrigley Field south of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Semiprofessional football also was played on the former dairy
farm. The site of North Market and what is now CBS Television City
once housed Gilmore Stadium, home to the Los Angeles Bulldogs, who
were champions of the old American Football League in 1937.</TE>
<TE>   The stadium also hosted circuses, dog shows, boxing matches,
political rallies, an Esther Williams aquatic show and midget car
racing, which got its start in Los Angeles in the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   The original Farmers Market still is open seven days a week with
70 shops selling a broad range of goods, including produce and toys.
The site remains one of the region's top attractions, drawing about 3
million visitors a year.</TE>

<HD>Global Woes May Hit U.S. Economy</HD>
<DH>Problems in Europe, Asia are just part of challenge facing
growth worldwide in '03.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evelyn Iritani</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Portending a tough time ahead for California exporters, the global
economy is limping into the new year weighed down by the threat of
war in Iraq and held back by tepid growth from Europe to Asia.</LD>
<LD>   The lack of a strong driver in the coming year raises the risk
that the world economy could lose its momentum or even slip into
recession, the World Bank warned in its latest economic scorecard.
Nicholas Stern, the bank's chief economist, had held out hope for a
stronger rebound, but recent events have prompted him and other
analysts to lower growth projections for 2003.</LD>
<LD>   "The recovery has been much more hesitant and uneven than we
expected," Stern said.</LD>
<TE>   The domestic front also is fraught with uncertainty. Heading the
list of worries at home, business experts say, is the possibility
that a military conflict in the Middle East could trigger a spike in
oil prices or a new wave of terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   If a war in Iraq dragged on, it could spook U.S. consumers whose
spending has kept the nation's economy and its trading partners from
sliding into recession.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest single vulnerability right now is oil and
geopolitical issues," said Stuart Schweitzer, chief global investment
strategist for J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management in New York. "The
other big issue concerns the U.S. consumer.... It is legitimate to
ask how long the consumer can keep going."</TE>
<TE>   Such uneasiness was heightened after the retail sector reported
that the holiday shopping season was the worst it had experienced in
decades.</TE>
<TE>   If the global economy can't count on the United States to propel
growth, neither can American businesses rely on many others around
the world.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Bush administration is pushing hard to wrap up trade
agreements with Chile and Singapore by early next year, overseas
sales are unlikely to be a major source of strength for U.S. firms
because their biggest customers in Asia and Europe are struggling.</TE>
<TE>   The only cause for cheer is a recent weakening of the dollar,
which makes U.S. goods cheaper overseas. But since products are
ordered months in advance, it takes time for currency shifts to have
an effect on trade flows.</TE>
<TE>   Sluggish exports are especially worrisome for trade-dependent
California, whose major industries -- technology, aerospace and
agriculture -- count heavily on foreign sales. Through October,
California's exports were down 15.3% compared with the same period a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   That included declines of 26% to Japan, 18% to Canada and 24% to
Britain. Even sales to China, the world's most promising area of
growth, were off 8%.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were additional movement in the dollar, that could be
especially helpful," said Thomas Duesterberg, president of the
National Assn. of Manufacturers, a Washington trade group. "We don't
expect -- at least in the first half of the year -- for Europe, Japan
or Latin America to be a source of strong growth."</TE>
<TE>   The first half of 2003 is likely to be particularly difficult for
Japan. The world's second-largest economy is threatening to slide
from slow growth to no growth. Meanwhile, Germany, Europe's largest
economy, is saddled with rising unemployment and widespread business
discontent, according to analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Although growth by region is expected to vary widely -- from 1.8%
in Latin America to 6.1% in East Asia -- the World Bank is projecting
that global gross domestic product will rise by 2.5% next year, up
from 1.7% in 2002 but well below the 3.9% expansion in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The uncertainty of the Iraqi situation already has imposed a "war
premium" of $5 to $6 per barrel of crude oil, said Gerard Walsh,
director of economics at London-based research firm Economist
Intelligencer Unit.</TE>
<TE>   Higher oil prices translate into bigger energy bills for
businesses and consumers and more expensive gasoline. If the war
premium lasts for as long as a year, it could shave at least 0.2% off
global growth, he said. Particularly vulnerable are Asia's largest
economies, which depend heavily on imported oil. Japan buys 86% of
its oil from the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   China, however, is emerging as an exception in an otherwise gloomy
picture. Its economy, although small compared with that of the United
States, is expected to continue a robust expansion propelled by an
estimated $50 billion in foreign investment that poured into
export-oriented manufacturing companies, automakers, steel producers
and others in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "Where Japan's leadership has difficulty dealing with the past and
still has its back turned to the future, China has embraced the
future," said Kenneth Courtis, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia.
"China's leadership understands if it can't generate this growth, it
won't stay in power."</TE>
<TE>   China's growth has huge benefits for a region whose primary
engine, Japan, has been stalled for more than a decade. To fuel its
export factories, China has dramatically increased its imports,
particularly of raw materials and components. This year, South Korea,
Singapore and Taiwan will ship more goods to China than to Japan,
Courtis said. But in a stagnant world economy, much of China's
manufacturing growth will come at the expense of less competitive
developing countries in Asia and Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   "China is an important new competitor for growth prospects for
both Eastern and Western Europe and for Latin America, for Russia and
for some companies in the U.S.," said Donald Straszheim, president of
Straszheim Global Advisors, an economic consulting firm in Los
Angeles. "The defense of the status quo is going to become more
difficult, not less."</TE>
<TE>   South of the U.S., the downside pressures are enormous.</TE>
<TE>   Maquiladoras, the border factories dependent on exports to the
U.S., have lost tens of thousands of jobs to lower-cost competitors
in Asia, particularly China. Under the North American Free Trade
Agreement, tariffs will be lifted on almost all U.S. agricultural
commodities Jan. 1, and Mexico's long-protected farmers are bracing
for an onslaught of cheap U.S. meats and other farm goods.</TE>
<TE>   In South America, Brazil and its neighbors are struggling to
contain the repercussions of Argentina's currency collapse and the
political strife that has paralyzed Venezuela's oil industry.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Feinberg, an international relations specialist at UC San
Diego, said the Bush administration has changed its tune on Brazil's
new leftist leadership, recognizing that a collapse in South
America's largest economy could damage the bottom line of U.S.
financial institutions. The U.S. government has supported the
International Monetary Fund's $30-billion bailout package for Brazil,
and President Bush invited Brazilian President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula
da Silva to the White House this month.</TE>
<TE>   "When the economy is already wobbly, the one thing the Bush
administration wants to avoid where it can is any additional negative
shocks," said Feinberg, who served as the Clinton administration's
point man on Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining international confidence in the U.S. economy is vital,
since foreigners have supported America's spending spree by pouring
their funds into U.S. Treasury bills and equity markets. Just to
offset its current account deficit and maintain the dollar's value,
the U.S. needs to attract $1.4 billion a day in foreign capital. In
recent days, worries about the uneven U.S. recovery and the prospect
of war have depressed the dollar's value against the euro and the
yen.</TE>
<TE>   Growing European uneasiness over the U.S.-led campaign against
Iraq also may be slowing investment flows into the U.S., said Joan
Payden, chief executive of Payden &amp; Rygel, a Los Angeles investment
management firm with a focus on Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "I think some flows from an investment standpoint are somewhat
emotional right now," she said. "Europe does not like what we're
doing in the Middle East.... The sentiment overseas is very negative.
I think it's a short-term phenomenon, but it might affect flows into
this country."</TE>
<TE>   Though the 12-nation European Union has hit a rough spot, Payden
believes that the collapse of the equities markets in those nations
has created opportunities for U.S. investors to pick up solid
companies at rock-bottom prices, particularly in insurance and health
care.</TE>
<TE>   Payden's firm, in partnership with Metzler Bank, the oldest
private bank in Germany still owned exclusively by the founding
family, is launching five mutual funds focused on Europe, including
the Eastern European countries that are lined up to join the euro
zone. Also in their sights is Russia, whose struggling economy has
gotten a boost from higher oil prices.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think people look enough for diversifying both
geographically as well as sectors," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Though another year of bumping along at the bottom is likely,
there also is the possibility that the global economy could get a
confidence-building "surprise on the upside," such as a major success
in the U.S. war against terrorism, said Gary Hufbauer, a trade
specialist at the Institute for International Economics in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "That would put a very different perspective on everything," he
said. "I think a lot of firms are holding back investment for fear of
another wave of terrorism."</TE>

<HD>Toy Firm Turns Popular Mint Strip Into Child's Play</HD>
<DH>Jakks Pacific pins hopes on Tongue Tape to be the next
bubblegum cigar or Pez dispenser.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Abigail Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his quest to create the hottest edible toy since the whirling
lollipop, no detail has been too trivial for Michael Bianco, chief
merchandising officer of Malibu-based toy maker Jakks Pacific Inc.</LD>
<LD>   So Bianco appointed himself Jakks' chief taste tester and, in that
capacity, rejected a grape candy sample as too gritty, a blue
raspberry for being too sticky and an orange attempt as too flimsy.
Would-be cherry versions were nixed for being too bitter, too
brittle, too brown or too pink.</LD>
<LD>   Bianco's goal? An elusive candy version of the dissolving
breath-freshening strips popular with adults.</LD>
<TE>   And after more than a year of tasting, tossing out and trying
again, he thinks he's got it -- and that the kids of America will
want it. The product is set to begin showing up on select toy store
shelves this week.</TE>
<TE>   What might sound like a silly endeavor is a potential Holy Grail
to those in the business of selling to children. Done right, the
candy strips could be a kind of modern-day bubblegum cigar and Pez
dispenser rolled into one: a kid version of an adult product that's
also fun to collect.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw it, I thought, they're going to sell millions of these
things and make a ton of money," said Sean McGowan, a toy industry
analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York. "It puts a bunch of
the right things together -- it's a toy and a collectible and a cool,
Space-Age-like candy. What more do you need?"</TE>
<TE>   Still, there's also the potential for Jakks to wind up with
another flash fad or an all-out dud. Candy counters and toy aisles
across the country are overstuffed with companies' hopes for the next
big craze. Jakks won't say how much it spent to develop the candy --
its first foray into an edible plaything -- but says the product is
the company's biggest launch of a nonlicensed toy.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Jakks has met the first big challenge: whetting the
appetite of a few key buyers.</TE>
<TE>   After running what it's calling Tongue Tape by just a few
retailers, Jakks says it has landed orders for more than 5 million
units during the first quarter of next year alone. And that was
without being able to show buyers the final product, which was still
in development.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to turn a toy into a hit is part whimsy and part work. Fads
often come out of nowhere, as with Beanie Babies and Cabbage Patch
dolls. Other times, the winners are carefully plotted.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Tongue Tape, Jakks is hoping to exploit the
popularity of adult products: Pfizer Inc.'s Listerine PocketPaks,
introduced about 18 months ago, and Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co.'s Eclipse
Flash Strips, in cinnamon and peppermint flavors, which followed last
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Already, consumers have snapped up more than 200 million Listerine
strip packages alone, according to Pfizer. With different-size
packages selling at $1.50 to $6 a pop, that means hundreds of
millions of dollars in retail sales.</TE>
<TE>   To a toy or candy maker, that's enough to signal that a product is
ripe for an extension into the kid market. (Neither Pfizer, which
recently sold off its candy unit, nor Wrigley would discuss their own
plans for new flavors.)</TE>
<TE>   It was the same route traveled by the ultimate in candy toys, Pez,
the edible pellets of which Americans buy 3 billion each year. The
fruit-flavored candy, which is packaged as a toy, also began as a
minty product; the name Pez, coined 70 years ago in Austria, comes
from Pfefferminz, German for peppermint.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, most toys -- from cars to baby dolls -- are pint-size
versions of adult products or interests.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a kid there were candy cigarettes," said M. Eric
Johnson, a professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Management, who
studies the toy industry. "Toys prepare you for adulthood. It allows
kids to play out adult life through the toys. Even the simplest,
youngest toys are after that idea."</TE>
<TE>   For Jakks -- which after a series of acquisitions this year became
the nation's third-largest toy company, behind Mattel Inc. and Hasbro
Inc. -- this particular take on an adult product is part of a broader
objective. Jakks wants to offer a range of products that sell
strongly all year long, not just during the Christmas shopping
season.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Jakks, best known for its professional wrestling action
figures and Flying Colors activity sets, has tried to reach this goal
through mergers. With the 2000 addition of Pentech, which brought gel
pens and stationery under the Jakks umbrella, the company gained
access to the lucrative back-to-school market and claimed new shelf
space at general merchandise and office-supply stores.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 2002, Jakks added Toymax International, the creator of Go
Fly a Kite and Funnoodle products, including kites and pool floats
that sell well in the summer. This month, Jakks built on its summer
offerings, announcing the purchase of the water guns, play sets and
other assets of privately held Trendmasters.</TE>
<TE>   With Tongue Tape, Jakks' plan is to construct its own line of
products with year-round appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Jakks, though consistently profitable, lags far behind the toy
industry's multibillion-dollar leaders, estimating its 2002 revenue
at $310 million to $330 million. The company, which went public in
1996, has seen its stock up 27% this year, closing Friday at $13.70
on Nasdaq. But shares are down from a 52-week high of $23.70 reached
in March.</TE>
<TE>   Toy industry analyst McGowan and others say Jakks' strongest moves
so far have been in following Mattel's and Hasbro's model of
establishing a broad stable of brands and products. A hit candy toy,
McGowan said, would mark another smart step in line with that
strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to create Tongue Tape, however, was anything but child's
play. And Jakks got word early on that others were on the hunt.</TE>
<TE>   When Jakks contacted edible plastic film producers from around the
world, several said they were already working on candy strips for
other candy and novelty companies and expected to ship them within
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "That was eight months ago," Bianco said, sitting in his
ocean-front Malibu office and smiling. "They still haven't."</TE>
<TE>   To make the breath-freshening strips, an oil-based flavoring is
added to oil-based film, a fairly simple process. The problem is that
most candy flavors are water based. And as most of Jakks' target
audience knows, oil and water don't mix.</TE>
<TE>   Just adding sugar to an oil flavoring doesn't work either because
the thin, wispy films don't have enough mass to hold the dense
sweetener.</TE>
<TE>   So Bianco and his chemists began toying more than a year ago with
a starch-based medium. That kind of product has worked well for
Hasbro, which used a similar type of base for its Nibble Notes, an
edible pad of paper with an accompanying food-color marker.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with a starch base is that it didn't have the
see-through, melt-away qualities of the product that Jakks wanted to
mimic. Nor was Bianco pleased with what he thought was a
Styrofoam-like taste.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm an old Catholic, so I know -- this tasted like a host,"
Bianco said.</TE>
<TE>   Jakks moved on to other bases and combinations, using edible,
food-grade plastics already FDA-approved for use in wrapping meats
and other grocery products.</TE>
<TE>   To speed the process, Bianco signed three manufacturers -- one in
the United States, one in Canada and one in Japan -- to their own
contest for the right formula.</TE>
<TE>   A Japanese-made candy film was too gritty and gluey. Various other
companies' combinations of plastics and starches made the product too
thin, brittle or flavorless.</TE>
<TE>   As the companies began shipping sample after sample to Bianco,
Jakks' chemists were also experimenting with ways to create a sweet
candy flavor. The first trick the chemists and edible film companies
employed was using artificial sweeteners, which are much thinner and
more easily manipulated than the denser traditional sugar.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was the bitter aftertaste, an unpleasant sensation
that harkens back to the early days of sugar substitutes made for
coffee and diet sodas.</TE>
<TE>   The various Jakks-contracted scientists found a way around that by
trying different amounts of citric and tannic acids. Though bitter in
their own right, the acids have the effect of enhancing the sugary
taste of Aspartame while cutting its bitter residue, similar to the
way salt brings out the sweetness in watermelon and tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Cherry was the toughest to crack. If the flavoring isn't just
right, a slightly off cherry has an unpleasant association for many
consumers -- what Bianco calls the "cough syrup factor." And that's
how the first versions turned out, with a bitter and medicinal taste.</TE>
<TE>   To show how far the products have come in just a few short months,
Bianco dug through a bunch of plastic bags until he found one filled
with a day-glow green film. This, he said, was supposed to be either
green apple or watermelon, though he couldn't remember which until he
put it in his mouth. "Sour green apple," he said, swirling the candy
through his mouth like a sommelier tasting a fine wine.</TE>
<TE>   "Ahh, the worst of all worlds -- gluey and bad flavor!" Bianco
proclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, just a few weeks ago, Jakks thought its chemists and one
of the film companies finally hit on the right formulas.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly thereafter, Bianco met with buyers from KB Toys, carrying
a lunchbox filled with eight Ziploc bags of his flavored films and
mock packages cut out of foam and covered with hand-drawn designs.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the meeting was over, he had an order for $1 million
worth of the product.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart and Toys R Us also placed orders through the first quarter
on the basis of samples and drawings, Jakks said.</TE>
<TE>   "It dissolves so quickly in your mouth but leaves a lasting
flavor. That's cool," said KB's merchandise manager, C.B. Alberts. "I
brought a couple pieces back to my daughter and her friends --
they're 12 -- and they thought it was very cool. They already like
the Listerine things, and that isn't for the taste."</TE>
<TE>   The various flavors are housed in plastic containers similar to
those of the breath fresheners, but with different cartoon-like
decorations, each sporting a giant tongue that reinforces the names:
Growlin' Grape, Lip-Lemony-Lemon, Cherry Pit Stop, Blue Ratsberry,
Cinna-Bomb and Ooh-Ooh Orange. Jakks is working to perfect a sour
line for the next installment of Tongue Tape.</TE>
<TE>   Jakks' suggested retail price for a basic container of 24 strips
of Tongue Tape is $1.99. A deluxe package for $3.99 will include 36
strips and a necklace, key chain, ring or zipper pull holder.</TE>
<TE>   Bianco spun off a list of possibilities for the next group of
dispensers, with the tape coming out of wheels on a car, an action
figure's backpack or the hood of a toy automobile. Jakks could sell
Tongue Tape in reels, rolls and printed sheets, he added.</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, the ideas are as basic as the once-humble Pez
dispenser.</TE>
<TE>   "We're relatively simple folk around here," Bianco said.</TE>
<TE>   "We tend to shy away from cutting-edge technology.... Kids are
kids and they like good, basic, fun things.</TE>
<TE>   "And they like candy."</TE>

<HD>K-Swiss Is Making Big Strides Without Utilizing Star Power</HD>
<DH>Athletic shoe firm bucks the industry norm of shelling out
millions for endorsements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Frammolino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nike has Tiger. Reebok snagged Alan Iverson. And Adidas has been on a
roll with Orlando Magic basketball star Tracy McGrady.</LD>
<LD>   But don't expect K-Swiss Inc. to engage in the multimillion-dollar
race to sign sports stars to tout its athletic footwear and clothing.
About the most the Westlake Village shoemaker ever ponied up was
$90,000 a year for the "Woodies."</LD>
<LD>   Never heard of them?</LD>
<TE>   That's exactly the point, says K-Swiss President Steven Nichols,
whose company claims 1% of the overall $16.3-billion athletic shoe
and apparel market. Only die-hard tennis fans know they're the most
successful men's doubles combo in history.</TE>
<TE>   "No one gets to see doubles much, so that's how we could afford
them," says Nichols.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the anti-celebrity company.</TE>
<TE>   By necessity and intent, K-Swiss has charted a relentlessly
contrarian course in a star-dazzled industry, now buzzing over which
company will sign Los Angeles Laker Kobe Bryant and Ohio high school
basketball phenom LeBron James to new shoe deals. Such contracts are
measured in the tens of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Yet K-Swiss has rarely paid more than $5,000 or so for a player
endorsement, preferring to aim low on the glamour-o-meter. Among its
pitchmen: Oba Carr, a welterweight best known for having lost to
Oscar de la Hoya in a 1999 championship bout. It once signed
baseball's player of the year -- for the minor leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the company has abandoned sports celebrities altogether to
put its marketing money on a decidedly no-name advertising campaign
for its K-Swiss Classic shoes, a perennial favorite with its five
stripes and D-shaped shoelace rings. Offering no slick mottos,
special effects or smiling personalities, the ads simply show
teenagers talking about the shoes against the backdrop of a mild rap
beat.</TE>
<TE>   The low-concept strategy seems to be working. During the last
quarter, the company shipped 943,000 pairs of the Classic -- up 160%
over last year. Overall, the company's share of the
"lifestyle-fashion" segment of the shoe industry increased this year
from 13.4% to nearly 19%, according to Sportscan Inc., a firm that
collects sales data on sporting goods.</TE>
<TE>   K-Swiss had 14 models among the top 50 sellers, an industry
benchmark, second only to Reebok with 18. (Those rankings do not
include sales through Foot Locker, one of the world's largest
athletic shoe retailers.)</TE>
<TE>   "I think the ads have resonated with people, and they've placed
them smartly in markets where they're trying to reawaken people to
the brand," including Southern California and the Northeast, says
Virginia Genereux, analyst for Merrill Lynch Global Securities.</TE>
<TE>   It also hasn't hurt that shoppers' tastes in athletic shoes seem
to be changing. With the economy down, buyers are less interested in
pricey fashion treads than they are in getting good value, say stock
analysts. Meanwhile, teenagers -- who account for roughly 50% of
sneaker sales nationwide -- are particularly hungry for anything
retro.</TE>
<TE>   While industry giant Nike Inc. has hustled to reintroduce older
models, the trend couldn't be sweeter than for K-Swiss, whose
white-on-white Classic hasn't changed since brothers Art and Ernest
Brunner introduced it 36 years ago as the first leather tennis shoe.</TE>
<TE>   K-Swiss has stuck with the shoe against a constant churn of
fashion that has exalted the lowly sneaker into a status symbol
packaged in metal casing and carrying a price tag of $150 or more.
Driving this development were not only technological changes --
gel-filled soles and air-filled cushions -- but the desire of
shoppers to identify with the marquee sports stars hired to tout the
footwear.</TE>
<TE>   K-Swiss tried something of that approach when it promoted its
training shoe line, which is different from the Classic. Dubbed its
"up and comers" campaign, the company hired "emerging" athletes who,
in many cases, up and went. Signed for between $3,000 to $5,000 each,
their names now read like a Who's Who of Sports Agate.</TE>
<TE>   There was Bill Muckalt, a journeyman National Hockey League player
who once went 70 games without scoring a goal. Erin
Veenstra-Mirabella, a cyclist who came in 10th in the 2000 Sydney
Olympics. Kris Farris, a standout as a UCLA offensive lineman who's
now looking for work on a National Football League team. Kristin
Schritter, a pro beach women's volleyball player who has been dogged
by injuries. And the former minor league player of the year,
outfielder Gabe Kapler, who hit two home runs with the Colorado
Rockies last season.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest name among the "up and comers" was quarterback Aaron
Brooks, now piloting the New Orleans Saints. K-Swiss landed him for
$12,000, but only for his less ballyhooed rookie year.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have the budget to afford the big-name athletes,"
retail securities analyst David P. Campbell of Davenport &amp; Co. says
about the K-Swiss campaign, which ran from 1999 to 2001. "That's
about all they could do." Sales of the training shoes sputtered, he
noted.</TE>
<TE>   About the hottest sports stars K-Swiss had going was the tennis
duo of Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde from Australia. Known as
the "Woodies," they racked up a record 61 tournament titles, won five
straight Wimbledons and captured the gold medal for doubles at the
1996 Atlanta Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys were, to us, like Michael Jordan," says Nichols,
referring to the Air Jordan campaigns made famous by Nike. In
K-Swiss' case, the Woodies were hired to impress a select crowd of
tennis fanatics whom the company was targeting for its
high-performance athletic shoes.</TE>
<TE>   The average sports fan, however, never heard of the Woodies
because TV routinely pulls the plug on its national tournament
coverage before the doubles ever get underway. Besides, whatever
advantage K-Swiss gained in its niche marketing disappeared three
years ago. "They retired," says Nichols.</TE>
<TE>   For its current Classic shoe campaign, K-Swiss has gone even more
downscale.</TE>
<TE>   The effort was overseen by a marketing department that Nichols put
together after sales took a nosedive in the mid-1990s, from $155
million to $107 million. The new group immediately instituted a
consumer research effort that periodically dispatches employees to
malls, shoe stores and high schools in 12 American cities to ask
representative teens what they think about new styles and color
schemes.</TE>
<TE>   Nichols says the system has been remarkably accurate.</TE>
<TE>   "These teams go out and when they come back, they almost always
have the same information," says Nichols. "Somehow, a kid in Miami,
either through osmosis or mental telepathy ... gives the same answer
as a kid from Seattle.... This is what almost always blows us away."</TE>
<TE>   The Classic ad campaign has taken the same tack, posing its own
set of questions: What exactly do you like about the white-on-white
shoes? And when do you wear them?</TE>
<TE>   The result has been a string of sound bites such as "I like them
clean and white" and "I like my K-Swiss fresh out of the box" and
"with my jeans." K-Swiss then lined up a dozen teenage actors and had
them repeat the words over a light rap background, also approved by
young shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   The ads began airing in February on MTV; the WB (which is partly
owned by Tribune Co., publisher of the Los Angeles Times); the Black
Entertainment Network; Fox Sports; and ESPN. Those outlets are key to
reaching the 12- to 24-year-old demographic group that sneaker
companies covet, says Nichols.</TE>
<TE>   Companion print ads, which have run in Vibe and other
youth-oriented magazines, are even plainer: They show a bunch of
teens holding the shoe.</TE>
<TE>   While the campaign won't win any Clios, Nichols says he's more
than satisfied. The company posted $236 million in revenue during the
first nine months of 2002 -- the same as for all of last year.
Earnings for the nine months ended Sept. 30 climbed to $23.9 million,
or $1.30 a share, from $18.8 million, or 96 cents, during the
year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   The company's stock is up 34.5% this year, after reaching a
52-week high of $27.75 on Dec. 2. K-Swiss shares closed Friday at
$22.33 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   And that was all achieved without some high-priced big name
pushing its products -- a lesson not lost on the sports agents who
represent star athletes in shoe deals.</TE>
<TE>   "They stopped calling long ago," says Nichols.</TE>

<HD>War Fears, Unrest in Venezuela Help Drive Up Oil Prices</HD>
<DH>Crude surpasses $33 a barrel, crossing that level for the
first time in more than two years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Crude oil rose above $33 a barrel early today amid concern that the
United States may attack Iraq early next year and that a strike in
Venezuela looks set to disrupt oil supplies for a fifth week.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. is increasing its military presence in the Persian Gulf
in preparation for a possible attack on Iraq, which President Bush
has accused of developing chemical and nuclear weapons.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. hopes United Nations weapons inspections in Iraq will
deliver results by the end of January, Secretary of State Colin
Powell said over the weekend.</LD>
<TE>   In Venezuela, the fourth-largest supplier of crude oil to the
U.S., strikers including 40,000 oil workers extended an
opposition-led walkout to the fifth week, demanding that President
Hugo Chavez resign or call elections.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq and Venezuela remain the two big issues," said Simon
Games-Thomas, an independent energy consultant in Sydney. "It's
concern over whether there's an early strike against Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil for February delivery rose as much as 45 cents, or 1.4%,
to $33.17 a barrel in after-hours electronic trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the highest since Dec. 1, 2000, after closing at
$32.72 Friday.</TE>
<TE>   At 12:40 p.m. Singapore time, crude was trading at $33.09.</TE>
<TE>   In Venezuela, state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela's President
Ali Rodriguez said the country's oil output by the end of January
will rise to two-thirds of the amount it was producing before the
nationwide strike started on Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Output will rise to 2 million barrels a day by the end of January,
he said. Rodriguez was appointed by Chavez as head of the state oil
company after a failed coup in April.</TE>
<TE>   Traders and analysts said production probably won't rise to a
pre-strike level of about 3 million barrels a day in the next few
months as workers will need time to restart pumps and refineries.</TE>
<TE>   "Chavez has announced that Venezuelan oil production will increase
to over 2 million barrels per day," Games-Thomas said. "His previous
assessments of production have, however, been both wildly optimistic
and inaccurate, so there is a bit of a problem with credibility over
this point."</TE>

<KH>PREVIEW / WEEK OF DEC. 30-JAN. 5</KH>
<HD>2003's First Trading Days May Be Indicative</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News, Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This week marks the last two trading sessions in 2002. U.S. markets
will be closed Wednesday in observance of New Year's Day.</LD>
<LD>   "We're likely to see some fairly weak volumes, as many people are
on vacation," Tobias Levkovich, institutional equity strategist for
Salomon Smith Barney, said about this week. "News can get exaggerated
one way or the other because of that. Generally speaking, it's going
to be very hard to get much of a read out of the markets."</LD>
<LD>   But investors no doubt will try to do just that, with many of them
believing that market action during the first five trading days of
January often serves as an early indicator for the whole year.</LD>
<TE>   "There's an old saying: 'So goes the first week of the new year,
so goes the month, so goes the year,' " said Jeffrey Saut, chief
investment strategist at Raymond James Financial.</TE>
<TE>   Early January gains since 1950, excluding 1994, have been matched
by whole-year gains with only three war-related exceptions, according
to the Stock Trader's Almanac.</TE>
<TE>   This week, investors also will get a reading on consumer
confidence and the U.S. manufacturing sector.</TE>
<TE>   Confidence figures will be released Tuesday. Experts expect the
confidence measure to rise to 85.5 in December from 84.1 in November
-- an important rise given that consumer spending underpins about
two-thirds of the nation's economy.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management will issue its
report on the U.S. manufacturing sector. The report is expected to
show growth in December, after contraction for the third straight
month in November.</TE>
<TE>   "As the first economic data of the new year, next week's numbers
should get us off to a good start," said James F. Smith, director of
the Kenan Institute's Center for Business Forecasting at the
University of North Carolina. "The economy will be far healthier in
2003 than it was in 2002."</TE>
<TE>   Economists and monetary policy officials expect growth to pick up
in 2003 after slowing to a crawl at the end of this year. In the
first quarter, the economy is forecast to expand at a 2.5% annual
rate, up from 1.5% in the previous three months, based on the median
estimate of 71 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News this month.</TE>
<TE>   A drop in new orders kept the ISM manufacturing index from rising
above 50 last month. Since then, manufacturers have expressed more
optimism.</TE>
<TE>   In the group's semiannual outlook survey reported earlier this
month, 70% of goods makers and service providers said their sales
will be higher in 2003 than this year. Manufacturers said they expect
to increase their capital expenditures an average of 4.6% next year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a report today from the National Assn. of Realtors is
expected to show that sales of existing homes fell in November to an
annual rate of 5.7 million from October's pace of 5.77 million.
Existing-home sales are primed to beat the record 5.3 million sold
last year.</TE>
<TE>   But low demand for commercial space is causing construction
activity to slow. U.S. construction spending increased 0.1% in
November, a Commerce Department report probably will show Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Also ...</TE>
<TE>   * Today, unemployment benefits run out for about 780,000 American
workers under a temporary extension program.</TE>
<TE>   * Tuesday, Chicago Futures markets close at 10 a.m. PST; the bond
market closes at 11 a.m. PST; and stock markets close at the regular
time.</TE>
<TE>   * Wednesday, U.S. and most global markets closed.</TE>

<HD>Networks to Offer Bigger Dose of 'Reality'</HD>
<DH>Broadcasters see the shows as a cheaper way to give ratings
a boost, draw younger viewers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Meg James</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's the reality in television: The networks will start seeding
their schedules next week with a bumper crop of unscripted shows --
as many as 20 in the months ahead -- hoping to grow midseason ratings
on the cheap.</LD>
<LD>   More than a few of the upcoming programs seem to have sprouted
from quite fertile imaginations.</LD>
<LD>   ABC has plans for at least six so-called reality shows to plug
holes left by a string of failed prime-time dramas. Among them:
"Family Trust," in which relatives feud over the inheritance of a
departed loved one.</LD>
<TE>   New offerings by Fox Broadcasting include one in which the network
flies 20 single women to Paris to pursue a man they believe is filthy
rich. Turns out "Joe Millionaire" is a $19,000-a-year construction
worker.</TE>
<TE>   CBS is prospecting the hills of rural America for a modern-day
Clampett family to star in an unscripted version of "The Beverly
Hillbillies" -- complete with servants and cameras.</TE>
<TE>   On the WB network, stay tuned for "The Surreal Life," which
chronicles the lives of seven off-the-radar celebrities, including MC
Hammer and Corey Feldman, as they coexist under the same suburban
roof. (WB is majority owned by AOL Time Warner Inc. Tribune Co.,
publisher of the Los Angeles Times, has a 22.5% stake in the
network.)</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, NBC will be standing pat with "Meet the Folks" and the
weird food groups of "Fear Factor."</TE>
<TE>   In sum, TV has come a long way from the original unscripted show
of the late 1940s, "Candid Camera" (which began on radio as "Candid
Microphone").</TE>
<TE>   "There is absolutely going to come a point where there's a glut of
these things and it's going to be hard to launch new ones," said
Susan Lyne, entertainment president of Walt Disney Co.'s ABC. "But
that hasn't happened yet."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the prime-time ratings of Lyne's network have been
resuscitated by the unscripted show "The Bachelor," prompting ABC to
create "The Bachelorette," which will debut in January.</TE>
<TE>   "A few more reality shows can make a world of difference for us,"
Lyne said. "Obviously, the network is in the process of a long-term
rebuilding, and we needed some time to come up with some strong
scripted shows."</TE>
<TE>   For the networks, reality shows typically require less time to
ramp up than do sitcoms and dramas. Fewer writers are needed, and
there are no big-salaried stars. A program can be ready to air three
or four months after a network places an order.</TE>
<TE>   Industry sources say unscripted, hourlong shows usually cost
$700,000 to $850,000. In contrast, networks typically pay about $1.3
million for a one-hour drama.</TE>
<TE>   Also unscripted shows tend to be safer bets as midseason
replacements.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say dramas and comedies have higher failure rates because
viewers have been conditioned to sample new shows in September, not
during the winter. Thus, network executives are reluctant to roll out
more than two or three new big-budget programs.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a period when all networks are facing intense capital
budgeting restraints -- more than they did during the go-go years" of
the late 1990s, said Leland Westerfield, a broadcasting analyst for
UBS Warburg. With unscripted shows, he said, "you can generate a
profit in the first episode, rather than waiting for the back-end
with syndication."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the biggest payoff for the networks is that unscripted
shows attract the younger viewers prized by advertisers -- those aged
18-34 -- many of whom were weaned on MTV's "The Real World."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, some unscripted shows can turbocharge ad sales as the
programs build to a crescendo, creating a buzz that attracts more
viewers.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of the fall season, for example, 30-second
commercials on "The Bachelor" cost $136,000, slightly less than the
network's price for comedies. By November, when more than 20 million
viewers were tuning in to see which of the nubile contestants would
be chosen, that figure rocketed beyond $400,000.</TE>
<TE>   The same happened with Fox's summer blockbuster "American Idol,"
in which TV viewers voted for their favorite would-be pop star.</TE>
<TE>   Last-minute rates for commercials "went up significantly," said
Jon Nesvig, advertising chief for News Corp.-owned Fox. He wouldn't
disclose the amount, but advertisers say the price of 30-second spots
for the second installment of "American Idol," which will debut Jan.
21, have been selling for nearly $400,000.</TE>
<TE>   Not that many marketers were eager initially to jump aboard what
has become a gravy train. When the CBS show "Survivor" premiered in
2000, setting the stage for today's swirl of knockoffs, some ad
buyers were uneasy.</TE>
<TE>   "People were eating rodents and stuff and we felt that wasn't what
we wanted for our clients," said Roy Rothstein, vice president of
national broadcast research for Zenith Media. The firm's clients have
included Toyota Motor Corp. and its Lexus brand, General Mills Inc.
and GMRI Inc.-owned Olive Garden restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Today, "Survivor," which ranks in the top 10, draws among the
highest advertising rates in television -- more than $420,000 for a
30-second commercial.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Moonves, president of Viacom Inc.-owned CBS, noted that
unscripted programs such as "Survivor" have now passed the point of
being curiosities. They have become "like comedies, dramas, movies
and news magazine shows," Moonves said. "It's just part of your
schedule."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there can be the temptation to go with a winner once too
often, as ABC did with its hit "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." The
network aired the show so many times each week that its novelty wore
off.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone learned a little bit of a lesson with 'Millionaire,' "
Moonves said, "although I'm not knocking what ABC did because I might
have done the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   Network executives also have begun questioning whether unscripted
programs are really a cure for the bottom-line blues. Some point out
that although unscripted shows are less expensive than other types of
programming, the gap is narrowing.</TE>
<TE>   "Successful reality shows are not the bargains that everyone
thought that they were," said NBC Entertainment President Jeff
Zucker, who added that "most of them don't repeat well." NBC is owned
by General Electric Co.</TE>
<TE>   Gail Berman, president of Fox Broadcasting Entertainment, agrees.
"There's a lot of money that goes into these programs, said Berman,
whose network established itself more than 15 years ago with the
reality shows "Cops" and "America's Most Wanted."</TE>
<TE>   "Shows and formats come and go," she said. "What's wildly popular
right now eventually won't be as predominant."</TE>

<HD>Some Analysts Foresaw Weak Holiday Retail Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Cresci and Brian Kelleher</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- The few Wall Street analysts who recently lowered their
ratings on some of the nation's biggest retailers are sitting pretty,
as the industry faces its worst holiday sales season in 30 years.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts from Salomon Smith Barney and CIBC World Markets
downgraded companies such as discount store group Target Corp.,
warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale Corp. and electronics chain
Circuit City Stores in November.</LD>
<LD>   Since the beginning of this month, the Standard &amp; Poor's retail
index, which includes Target, Costco and Circuit City, has fallen
more than 10%.</LD>
<TE>   A look at analyst upgrades and downgrades over the last two months
shows that market watchers were much more optimistic on the stocks
they cover, according to data from Starmine, which tracks their
recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   But Salomon's Deborah Weinswig and CIBC's Dan Wewer were most
prescient with their bearish calls.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 7, Weinswig put "sell" ratings on shares of Target and
Costco, citing the potential for weak sales. Since then, Target
shares have fallen nearly 8%, while Costco stock dropped 15%. On
Friday, Target closed at $28.65 on the New York Stock Exchange, and
Costco closed at $27.39 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Wewer was ahead of the curve on East Coast chain Tweeter Home
Entertainment Group Inc., telling investors to sell shares of the
consumer electronics retailer Nov. 18. Just more than a month later,
the Canton, Mass.-based company warned that its fourth-quarter profit
would be less than half what Wall Street was expecting, and its
shares plummeted 34%.</TE>
<TE>   Some market gurus also have been avoiding the sector. Carlos
Asilis, chief U.S. equities strategist for J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.,
rated the retail industry "underweight" -- his lowest rating -- in a
report issued Oct. 31.</TE>
<TE>   "Risks to consumer spending are concentrated to the downside, in
our view," Asilis said in the report. "Weaker job and wage growth
dynamics are likely to reinforce weakening sector earnings
expectations."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the equation were analysts such as Lazard's
Todd Slater and Buckingham Research Group's Barbara Wyckoff, who
recently boosted their ratings on key retailers.</TE>
<TE>   Slater upgraded Costco and Target in late November to "buy" from
"hold," in part because of a sanguine view of the holiday selling
season. In a Nov. 19 note on Target, Slater cited the company's
better-than-expected sales results at stores open at least one year
and said, "Christmas won't be canceled."</TE>
<TE>   But shoppers didn't come out in force during the following weeks,
as fears over everything from job losses to a possible war with Iraq
and high oil prices restrained the freewheeling ways that have made
consumers the cornerstone of the U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 12, at the height of the holiday shopping season, Costco
warned that its profit for the current quarter would fall short of
Wall Street estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Buckingham's Wyckoff raised her rating of San Francisco-based Gap
Inc. and Columbus, Ohio-based Limited Brands Inc., both apparel
retailers, to "buy" in November. Shares of both have fallen in
December.</TE>
<TE>   Across the industry, the holiday season seems soft. Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. all but gave up hope that post-Christmas shopping sprees
will make up for sluggish pre-holiday sales, cutting its December
outlook the day after Christmas.</TE>

<HD>Cuba Seeks to Break Sugar Habit by Retraining Industry
Workers</HD>
<DH>Central planners hope reducing reliance on the crop will
help stem the economy's slide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol J. Williams</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN CRISTOBAL, Cuba</DL>
<LD>In the cloying tropical heat of Pinar del Rio province, the "national
garden" where jungles of sugar cane sag under their own weight,
central planners are cultivating an economic revolution.</LD>
<LD>   Sugar has been Cuba's dominant crop and a vital source of dollars
for two centuries. But dependence on one product has sickened a
national economy already suffering from U.S. trade sanctions and the
loss of trade when the Soviet bloc collapsed more than a decade ago.
Tumbling world sugar prices have forced those governing this last
flickering light of communism in the West to engineer an exit from
their sugar addiction.</LD>
<LD>   Cuban authorities have closed half of the country's 154 sugar
factories this year and have sent the first of an expected 200,000
idled cane cutters and mill hands to be retrained for work in greener
pastures.</LD>
<TE>   Independent economic analysts predict that the undertaking will
fail. Cuba still is reeling from the loss more than a decade ago of
Moscow's subsidies, and the most promising opportunities -- in
tourism and biotechnology -- are limited by a worldwide economic
downturn.</TE>
<TE>   To take what amounts to one in every 20 Cuban laborers out of
productive work during an expensive conversion, analysts say, smacks
of the outsized defiance of reality exhibited decades ago when Soviet
leaders attempted to reverse the course of Siberian rivers and flood
deserts in order to plant cotton and corn.</TE>
<TE>   Sugar production has been on a downhill slide since 1970, when
President Fidel Castro's drive to harvest 10 million tons fell short
by a million despite conscription of every able-bodied worker
available to cut cane. Since then, output has eroded, to 4 million
tons last year.</TE>
<TE>   Even when sugar was fetching 12 cents a pound a few years ago,
Cuba was spending at least 25% more on production than it was getting
back in sales. Today, with the world overstocked with sugar to the
tune of six months' demand, Cuba spends about 17 cents a pound making
a product that sells for only 5 cents a pound.</TE>
<TE>   The rush of good money after bad prompted a government edict in
May to retrain sugar workers for jobs in forestry, fruit and
vegetable production, food processing and horticultural science.
Planners hope they can reduce the country's dependence on food
imports, which costs the cash-strapped regime $1 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never good to depend on just one product, which is why we
need to diversify," said Jose Luis Rodriguez, head of business and
international relations at the Ministry of the Sugar Industry.</TE>
<TE>   Agricultural engineer Oscar Almazan contends that Cuban
researchers are perfecting the use of sugar cane as animal fodder.
That would boost meat production and avoid waste of cane output, he
said, calling the sweet feeds a promising "staple of the tropics."</TE>
<TE>   Those with a hand in the retraining effort also point to Cuba's
generally well-educated workforce as a reason for optimism in the
daunting transformation. Cutters can just as easily harvest corn or
cabbage, they insist, touting the community-based labor market as an
attraction for foreign investors.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, sugar workers are not so much based in their communities
as bound to them. Prohibited by the regime's anti-ownership ideology
from selling or renting their state-owned homes or from buying cars
that would allow them to commute, idled workers could not easily take
jobs in another market even if they were being offered.</TE>
<TE>   Developed along the Soviet model of horizontal integration, the
sugar industry is mostly situated in remote company towns such as San
Cristobal, where kindergartens, clinics, housing and all other
services are provided under the factory umbrella. Castro has vowed to
close the plants while maintaining salaries and services that made
production a losing venture. Cuban economists such as Tirso Saenz
Coopat insist that the regime can find a way to square the economic
logic.</TE>
<TE>   "We are driven by necessity. We can't do anything with our
industrial architecture without a market, and there is no market for
sugar at the moment," said the economist, who heads the state Assn.
of Sugar Technicians.</TE>
<TE>   Saenz cites soaring maintenance costs for idled mills as
justification for shutting them down and stripping them of equipment
that can be used elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, from the sugar ministry, notes that the shuttered mills
contain some of the most powerful generators in Cuban industry and
can be tapped to supply electricity to counter the island's frequent
blackouts. And for every $35,000 boiler the state can avoid buying
for the mills in the future, five greenhouses can be built to grow
vegetables and flowers -- products impossible to import at affordable
prices, he added.</TE>
<TE>   With the country already on its economic knees, however,
independent economic analysts say they see no way the regime can
afford to finance its projected three years of downtime for former
sugar workers.</TE>
<TE>   "The retraining program is an intelligent effort by the government
of Cuba to restructure, but it does have substantial short-term and
medium-term costs," said John Kavulich, head of the U.S.-Cuba Trade
and Economic Council in New York. "These people won't be productive
while they are learning new skills."</TE>
<TE>   The intellectual transformation will be even more trying.</TE>
<TE>   "Sugar workers are generally unskilled laborers," the analyst
said. "Some individuals are just not going to be capable of making
the transition."</TE>
<TE>   One of 71 complexes surviving the mass shutdown, the 30th of
November plant here in San Cristobal stands in grimy tribute to the
corroded state of the industry. Rusty screws protrude from corrugated
aluminum walls. Uneven concrete floors are safety minefields, strewn
with stray electrical cords, loose parts from crumbling machinery and
singed pieces of cane stalks. A rickety catwalk missing half its
handrails traverses the grime-encrusted production line, which looks
capable of making only smoke and noise.</TE>
<TE>   At the Eduardo Garcia Lavandera agro-industrial complex, an hour's
drive west of here, two dozen workers huddle at tiny desks on a patio
of the hacienda seized from sugar magnate Julio Lobo after Cuba's
1959 revolution. The two personal computers set up yards away, like
alabaster busts in an art museum, are of no use because the complex
has been without electricity since morning.</TE>
<TE>   If any of the workers doubt the viability of the transition, they
are loath to say so. Others continue to trust their fate to the
faltering revolution.</TE>
<TE>   "We have security in our social system, so I'm not afraid of
changes," said Rosario Soca, a 40-year-old mother of two who has
worked at the factory for 20 years and takes home less than $10 a
month in pay. "Even if something happens, I will still get my
salary."</TE>

<HD>Redpoint Ventures Is Taking It Slow</HD>
<DH>A partner talks about the outlook for investing and the
firm's strategy after the tech slump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like many venture capitalists, Brad Jones has plenty of money to
invest in promising start-up companies in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   But also like many of his VC peers, Jones is in no great hurry to
put that money to work.</LD>
<LD>   The 47-year-old is a founding partner of Redpoint Ventures, one of
Southern California's largest venture firms. Redpoint, formed in 1999
when it was spun out of Brentwood Venture Capital, is working its way
through an experience widely shared in the business: The
technology-focused firm has ample capital to put to work -- $450
million left in a fund to which investors committed $750 million --
but it is going slow in the aftermath of the tech sector's deep
slump.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, Jones sees substantial promise in such areas as wireless
data communications and network security, and he expects the stricter
environment for venture investing today to result in a stronger, more
seasoned roster of private firms selling stock to the public in the
future.</TE>
<TE>   Jones spoke with The Times last week.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Venture capital firms raised record sums in the late
1990s, but there's a lot of second-guessing today about how the money
was put to work. What happened?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Everyone made mistakes. In the VC business, what we did
wrong was investing in companies that looked sexy at the time but
didn't have the attributes to be a sustainable business. Sometimes
you knew the business model was shaky but you saw other companies
going public with $1-billion or $2-billion valuations -- and they had
even shakier business models.</TE>
<TE>   On the limited-partner side, returns were so astronomical for a
while that they were pouring in money at a huge rate -- too much, too
fast.</TE>
<TE>   That's corrected itself. Anybody who doesn't believe in capitalism
ought to look at how the system gets rid of the excesses. Everyone is
investing more carefully. You see headlines about how VCs are chicken
now, but that isn't necessarily bad. It doesn't help the economy if
you're investing in a lot of companies that are going to fail and end
up throwing people out of work.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What is the effect of the new venture environment in terms of
your approach and the attitude of the entrepreneurs you work with?</TE>
<TE>   A: Valuations of companies are far lower, so we're able to buy the
same size stake for less. For entrepreneurs, the downturn might sound
bad but it's really not. What was happening a few years ago was not
sustainable. Money was so cheap and available that entrepreneurs were
spending it recklessly.</TE>
<TE>   Now, entrepreneurs are more careful and they're getting more for
their money. It might have taken $30 million to develop their
products a few years ago, and now it takes $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   Also, fewer companies are being funded, so that removes
competition. You might be facing one or two or three other start-ups
[in your industry], but not 10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: You originally planned to raise and invest $1.25 billion
through your second fund but scaled back your plans to $750 million.
Why?</TE>
<TE>   A: Our pace of investment was slower than we thought it was going
to be -- and slower than it has been historically for us -- because
it's tough to find great deals these days. We want to invest over a
reasonable time period -- four years or so -- because if it gets to
be too long that can hurt the returns of the fund.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Where did Redpoint invest this year?</TE>
<TE>   A: The only Southern California investment we made was in Telasic
Communications, an El Segundo company that makes chips for wireless
communications. Telasic is run by a team spun out of Raytheon and it
has an interesting technology that should lower the cost of building
wireless systems. It might be able to get its first product to the
market in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Redpoint also invested in five tech companies based in Northern
California this year, primarily in the software and wireless areas.</TE>
<TE>   We've averaged 15 investments per year, if you look at the
combined history of Brentwood and Redpoint.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What's your outlook for 2003? Will the pace of venture
investing depend on whether the stock market recovers after enduring
three straight losing years?</TE>
<TE>   A: The stock market and the initial public offering market are
important, but they won't necessarily affect the VC market
immediately. First of all, the IPO market may not return even if the
stock market goes up. There is a cascade effect, but it takes time.</TE>
<TE>   The funding slowdown has taken the pipeline of IPO candidates
away, and the criteria set by the underwriters have tightened. People
want to see a couple of quarters of profit, whereas in 1999 and 2000
a lot of companies went public without even having a product.</TE>
<TE>   For venture capital, I don't expect 2003 to all of a sudden go
from a slow deal year in 2002 to a return to the late-1990s heyday. I
see 2003 as a year when the VCs will invest with a lot of scrutiny,
which will position them for a lot of good IPOs in future years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are the hot tech areas you're watching?</TE>
<TE>   A: One is wireless data communications such as 802.11, also called
Wi-Fi or wireless fidelity. Another big area is 802.15, or
ultra-wideband. You can see why people use the nicknames -- so they
don't have to remember the numbers [which refer to standards set by
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, an industry
group].</TE>
<TE>   These are fairly short-range networks for a home or office where
you connect wirelessly and cheaply at high speed.</TE>
<TE>   There are all kinds of potential applications. Business travelers
could go online at airports. In home entertainment, you wouldn't have
to have coaxial cable running all [over] the place inside the house
[to connect various devices].</TE>
<TE>   But there are also a bundle of issues being sorted out, including
how all the fragmented people who own the networks get paid. There
are also all kinds of security issues, because you could be sending
important information out there.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you expect any Wi-Fi companies to go public in 2003?</TE>
<TE>   A: One Wi-Fi company in our portfolio is Trapeze Networks [based
in Pleasanton, Calif.], but it's a little early. I don't think the
company is ready to come public in 2003. Wi-Fi is a year or two
behind DSL and cable modem in terms of catching on -- at this point,
only the very early adopters are using it.</TE>
<TE>   In 2003, we'll see more use by business and consumers, but the
companies are not mature enough to meet the current standards for
going public. If demand for IPOs improves, that could change, but I'm
more inclined to think we could see Wi-Fi IPOs in 2004 or 2005.</TE>
<TE>   In 2003, we'll see a lot of growth in the industry and we'll
probably see more companies getting started.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What other industries are you watching closely?</TE>
<TE>   A: There is a lot going on in the [network] security area:
software that screens users; intrusion detection; and the
Web-services area -- for example, allowing people remote access to a
system and letting them run parts of a program.</TE>
<TE>   Take the accounting system at General Motors. You might want to
let customers see how much inventory is in the system, but you might
not want to let Company A, which makes exhaust manifolds, rummage
through and see how many side doors you have.</TE>
<TE>   Redpoint does not have any pure security companies in its
portfolio, but we have several that have security as part of their
application. In the future, almost every software company will have
to adopt a Web services model that includes security as part of the
application. Companies want to be accessible to customers and
suppliers, but nobody wants that access to be unlimited.</TE>

<TE>   Background Information</TE>
<TE>   About Brad Jones</TE>
<TE>   Before launching Redpoint Ventures, Jones was a general partner
with Brentwood Venture Capital (and its predecessor, Brentwood
Associates), which he joined in 1981, when venture capital was in its
infancy. Jones earned degrees in chemistry and physics from Harvard
University and an MBA and a law degree from Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   About Redpoint Ventures</TE>
<TE>   Redpoint, founded in 1999, raised $600 million from investors for
its first fund in that year. In 2000, the firm formed a second fund,
through which it initially expected to raise $1.25 billion. But with
the slump in the technology sector, Redpoint said it reduced the size
of the second fund to $750 million, of which $300 million has been
invested.</TE>
<TE>   Between the two funds, the firm has investments in about 40
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Redpoint has offices in Los Angeles and in Menlo Park, Calif.</TE>

<HD>Flood of Afghan Returnees Continues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Kraul</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Modern history's second-largest repatriation -- the return of Afghans
to their homeland -- will continue next year at a diminished but
still staggering rate, with about 1.2 million refugees expected to
make the trek back, the United Nations said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   As many as 6 million Afghans -- more than 20% of the population --
fled their native country during the 23 years of warfare that ended
with the defeat of the Taliban by U.S.-led forces last year.</LD>
<LD>   Almost a third of those who left -- about 1.8 million people --
came flooding back in the past year, 50% more than anyone expected.
An additional 250,000 internally displaced Afghans returned to their
homes with U.N. assistance. That wave of humanity is second in size
only to the 9 million people who returned to Bangladesh in the 1970s
after that nation achieved independence from Pakistan, according to
the United Nations.</LD>
<TE>   The U.N.'s Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, the
principal international aid agency for refugees here, spent $271
million on food, transportation, housing and health assistance this
year and will spend an estimated $194 million in 2003, spokeswoman
Maki Shinohara said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 100,000 refugees a week were streaming in during the
peak month of May. Although most of the returnees have gone on to
their hometowns or regions, tens of thousands remain in U.N. refugee
camps, including 30,000 each in Spin Buldak on the Pakistani border
and at another sprawling camp in the west near Herat.</TE>
<TE>   Ethnic violence in some areas of Afghanistan, especially in the
north, makes the return of some Pushtun refugees still too risky, the
U.N. said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the U.N. was overwhelmed by the number of returnees, much
of the aid it budgeted for reconstruction of schools, housing and
clinics was used instead for emergency relief, including food and
clothing.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the U.N. has joined the chorus of Afghan government
officials and international agencies pleading for new donations of
reconstruction aid.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan was slated to receive $1.8 billion in international
aid in 2002 and expects $1.2 billion in 2003 if pledges by donor
countries at a Tokyo conference earlier this year are made good.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent interview, Afghan Minister of Planning Haji Mohammed
Mukhaqiq said he was optimistic that his country will receive as much
as $2 billion in foreign aid next year, based on unofficial pledges
made at a conference this month in Oslo.</TE>

<HD>Philippine President Says She Won't Seek New Term</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MANILA</DL>
<LD>In a surprise announcement, Philippine President Gloria Macapagal
Arroyo said today that she will not seek a new term in elections due
in 2004. She cited the potentially divisive effect of a campaign as
her reason for bowing out.</LD>
<LD>   Arroyo was elected vice president under President Joseph Estrada
but took over the top job in January 2001 when he was ousted in a
popular revolt. Estrada is now on trial for corruption.</LD>
<LD>   "Since I am one of the principal figures in the divisive national
events in the last two or three years, our political efforts would
result in a never-ending divisiveness," she said in a speech. "In
view of these factors, I have decided not to run."</LD>
<TE>   Arroyo's decision came amid growing concern among busi- nesspeople
about economic prospects in the face of a surging national budget
deficit, poor tax collection efforts and perceptions of increased
lawlessness.</TE>
<TE>   With her decision not to run, Arroyo said she felt "relieved of
the burden of politics."</TE>
<TE>   She said she intends to devote the last year and a half of her
term to the economy and to encouraging business activity "unhampered
by corruption and red tape in government."</TE>

<HD>In Baghdad, Many Insist Americans Would Regret an Invasion</HD>
<DH>Saddam Hussein doesn't need his people's love to command
their loyalty, Iraqis contend, saying the U.S. faces a populace
primed to fight back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sergei L. Loiko</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Engineer Qusai Jabbar has a word of advice for Americans who think
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is so unpopular that ousting his
regime will be a cakewalk: Remember Stalin.</LD>
<LD>   "Russia lived under a bloody tyrant for a long time," Jabbar said.
"This tyrant killed millions of his own people and sent millions ...
to Siberia. But when the big war came, his people rallied around him
and fought like the possessed."</LD>
<LD>   Just as Russians struggled against Nazi Germany's World War II
attack regardless of their feelings toward Soviet dictator Stalin,
virtually all Iraqis will fiercely resist any U.S.-led invasion,
Jabbar predicts.</LD>
<TE>   "You don't need to be in love with Saddam to defend your country
to the last," he said. "Americans think they will come here and rule
us. They don't know what they are coming into. If they get food from
someone, it will be poisoned. If they turn around with their back to
us, we will stick a knife in it. Snipers will be looking for them
from every rooftop."</TE>
<TE>   In Iraq today, talk among artists and intellectuals revolves
around United Nations sanctions, U.N. weapons inspectors and what is
widely seen as the prelude to war. Public anger is fueled by the
sanctions, which are viewed as unfair and inhumane, and by memories
of the bombing that Baghdad endured during the 1991 Persian Gulf War,
when a U.S.-led effort drove out Iraqi forces that had taken Kuwait.
Iraqis do not necessarily see their country as the aggressor in that
invasion.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know the history of the conflict. Kuwait was
stealing our oil, cheating on us all the time," complained Amal Khoderi,
65, an amiable and energetic patron of the arts in Baghdad. "We appealed
to the world community many times to stop it, but nothing was done."</TE>
<TE>   At the busy open-air Rashid Street book market, where men squat to
peruse books in languages including English and Russian, bookseller
Hussein Ali, 55, bemoans what sanctions have done to his life.</TE>
<TE>   A retired high school biology teacher with five children, Ali says
he draws a pension worth just $4 a month. Buying and selling books
brings in about $50 a month, which is nearly enough for his family to
live on, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Sanctions are killing us slowly," Ali said. "The war will kill us
fast."</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Khalak, a novelist who sports a Saddam Hussein-type
mustache, shared his views at a cafe frequented by writers and
students. A color portrait of Hussein hung on the wall, in this case
with the beaming strongman holding not his usual gun but a cup of
coffee. Some of the customers were smoking traditional narghiles, or
water pipes.</TE>
<TE>   Khalak said the U.N. inspectors' work reminds him of "a most
boring Indian movie which goes around in circles and never ends."</TE>
<TE>   "You want to stand up and leave the movie theater," he said.
"Right now, our problem is that we can't. We have to watch it to the
end. And the end is bitterly predictable: The U.S. may attack us any
second with no respect for what the inspectors find or do not find."</TE>
<TE>   Broad willingness to rally around the government in the face of
any U.S.-led invasion comes partly from a widespread belief that
Washington is not being honest about its motives, said Wamidh Nadhmi,
a political analyst who teaches at Baghdad University.</TE>
<TE>   "What Americans really care for is oil -- and help to Israel," he
said. "They are not concerned with the fate of human rights and
freedoms in Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   War seems almost inevitable to many Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   "One day, when Americans maybe understand us better, they will see
that we are not animals eating human flesh," said Khoderi, who
occasionally stuck small, even pieces of dry wood into her fireplace
to cut the winter chill. "Thousands of years of civilization can't be
discarded and downtrodden just like this. But I am afraid that
Americans -- I mean those Americans who are prepared to give orders
to bomb us out of existence -- don't have an understanding of history
and the meaning of it. They don't care."</TE>
<TE>   Khoderi was speaking in a house overlooking the Tigris River in
old Baghdad that now serves as an art salon, museum, shop and center
for music recitals.</TE>
<TE>   A two-story brick-and-wood structure on a gray and dusty street,
it boasts arched ornamental ceilings, a walled-in garden with palm
trees and flowers, and hundreds of craft items ranging from drawings
to carpets and elaborate calligraphy tapestries. Agatha Christie used
to stay in the house when she visited Baghdad, Khoderi said.</TE>
<TE>   During the Gulf War, when the United States bombed a bridge just a
hundred yards from her home, the attack also destroyed half the
house, which she inherited from her father. After that, she was
determined to rebuild.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really the ruins of the bridge, not my crippled house,
which sent this signal to my very heart," she explained.</TE>
<TE>   "This house is my life, and my life is this house," she
said. "They once tried to bomb my life out of existence. Now, they are
ready to try again. You know, only people with no sense of history
and its role in our civilization can drop bombs on such cities as
Baghdad. It is as if they are not humans but some kind of aliens who
come from another planet and know nothing about our civilization, our
history and culture."</TE>
<TE>   Khoderi predicted that any invasion force will face fierce battles
in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "We will resist," she said. "We may see Baghdad burned to
ashes, but we will resist. It is not the first time in history that
Baghdad is burned. The Tigris River may become red with blood again, as it
was in the past, but we will not surrender."</TE>

<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>They returned to build a new Palestine. But after more than two years
of deadly, dead-end Mideast violence, many Palestinian businesspeople
and professionals have given up.</LD>
<LD>   The early 1990s saw tens of thousands of Palestinians arriving in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip after years studying or working abroad,
mostly in the United States. Lured by landmark peace accords, they
brought their children and their expertise and began investing in
what they believed would become an independent nation. They built
hotels, villas and a stock market.</LD>
<LD>   Today, many of those same people have abandoned the dream, at
least for now. As the best-trained, best-educated leave, a void has
been created in which political extremists and religious
fundamentalists are gaining prominence.</LD>
<TE>   Of five Palestinian professionals interviewed by The Times a few
weeks after the intifada began in September 2000, only one is still
here.</TE>
<TE>   Nidal Harb, a cardiologist, and his wife, Sana, a university
professor, had moved back to their native Ramallah after 20 years in
the United States. They wanted their four children to learn Arabic
and know their roots. Last year, after a particularly nasty round of
shelling in this West Bank city, they left.</TE>
<TE>   Nidal sold the state-of-the-art heart clinic he had opened here.
He is practicing today in Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   The difficult decision to leave "was a combination of many
factors," Sana said by e-mail. "Mainly our sad realization that the
conflict will not be resolved in the near future."</TE>
<TE>   Nader Shahin, a U.S.-schooled engineer who created and ran a
highly lucrative brokerage firm, left a few months ago for North
Carolina. He could no longer turn a profit. He had to rent out his
offices to the Canadian Embassy.</TE>
<TE>   The Masri family has it especially tough. Businessman Bashar Masri
remains in Ramallah, but his wife, Jane, and their two daughters
moved to the suburbs of Washington last year after their house came
under fire. He visits periodically.</TE>
<TE>   "The price is high," he said. "I go there and I'm like a visitor.
The girls jump on the bed and celebrate. They're so happy Daddy is
home. But it's only a week. Then I leave, I come back here, and I'm
lonely and miserable."</TE>
<TE>   A luxury hotel that Masri co-owns is in bankruptcy, and most of
his other companies are struggling. Death and destruction, the
punishing restrictions imposed by Israel and the corruption and
mismanagement of the Palestinian Authority all have derailed the
plans Masri once had.</TE>
<TE>   "No doubt, most of my dreams are shattered," he said. "A lot of
people came with such euphoria, to build a state from scratch, a
chance that history doesn't give very often.... And today it's just a
disaster."</TE>
<TE>   Masri, 41, has kept financially afloat by investing in
Internet-related companies that seem to be the one kind of business
flourishing in Ramallah these days.</TE>
<TE>   He thinks investors will one day return. And the physical damage
to Ramallah and other parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip can be
repaired, though it will take "years and years and years." But the
minds of Palestinians, as well as Israelis, are poisoned by hatred
and politics, Masri said, and he's not sure that can be changed.</TE>
<TE>   "The progressives and the moderates are gone," he said. "The young
professionals, the ones who came with experience, they're gone. It's
going to be difficult to bring them back."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Troops Kill Boy, 11, in West Bank</HD>
<DH>Shooting death is second such slaying of a Palestinian
child in two days. Witnesses dispute army's description of
circumstances as riot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>For the second time in two days, Israeli troops Sunday fatally shot a
Palestinian child, this one a boy of 11 who was killed when soldiers
fired on a crowd of young stone-throwers in the northern West Bank
town of Tulkarm.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, a 9-year-old Palestinian girl was killed outside her
home in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian witnesses said the slain boy, Abdel Karim Salameh, was
part of a crowd of students walking home from school. Some of the
boys threw stones at a passing army vehicle, and the soldiers opened
fire, the witnesses said.</LD>
<TE>   Tulkarm, like most other major West Bank cities and towns, has
been under an intermittent Israeli military curfew for the last
several months. The curfew was lifted for some hours Sunday, and the
streets were filled with Palestinians going to work and school,
shopping and visiting family members.</TE>
<TE>   The army said that a "violent riot" broke out in the late morning
in the eastern part of town and that its troops responded with
nonlethal means -- a term generally used to characterize crowd
control measures such as tear gas, stun grenades and rubber-coated
steel bullets.</TE>
<TE>   However, the director of the town's hospital, Dr. Ahmed abu Bakar,
said the boy was killed by a live bullet to the head. A second
11-year-old was hit in the leg with a rubber bullet in the same
incident, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This army has no principles or ethics -- it was a direct hit to
kill this boy," said the governor of Tulkarm, Izzedine Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   The army said it was investigating the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's death was the latest in a string of child fatalities
over the last several weeks. Earlier this month, four Palestinians
under the age of 16 were killed in the course of a single week in the
Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups, including the Israeli organization B'Tselem,
say the number of Palestinian minors killed in 27 months of violence
has exceeded 300. Palestinians say the figure is higher than that.</TE>
<TE>   Tulkarm, which lies close to the Green Line dividing the West Bank
and Israel, has been the home base of many suicide bombers and others
who have launched attacks against Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   As elsewhere in the West Bank, Israeli soldiers operating in
Tulkarm have carried out an aggressive campaign of arrests -- and
sometimes killings -- of Palestinian militants, coupled with
demolitions of homes belonging to families of those who have carried
out attacks.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,200 Palestinians have been arrested in such raids over
the last two months, Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz told fellow Cabinet
ministers Sunday, in what has been one of the largest sweeps in
memory.</TE>
<TE>   In the southern West Bank, Israeli troops Sunday arrested three
members of Islamic Jihad, which claimed responsibility for killing
four Jewish seminary students in a shooting attack Friday night,
hours after the start of the Jewish Sabbath. The army said the three
arrested men were believed to belong to the same cell that carried
out the attack on the yeshiva, or religious seminary, at the
settlement of Otniel, outside the city of Hebron.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's Cabinet meeting brought a brief but highly unusual debate
over targeted killings of Palestinian militants -- not over the
legality or morality of the practice, but over whether it serves
mainly to provoke more violence.</TE>
<TE>   The attack at Otniel came one day after nine Palestinians died at
the hands of Israeli troops in a 24-hour period. Several of those
deaths bore the hallmarks of what Israel calls "pinpoint" killings of
militants. Among the dead was a local leader of Islamic Jihad, which
vowed it would exact revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli government sources and media reports said that during the
closed-door Cabinet gathering, Atty. Gen. Elyakim Rubinstein pointed
to the Otniel attack -- and the fact that it came on the heels of the
deaths of several militant leaders -- in arguing that targeted
killings should be only a last resort.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups estimate that about 90 such killings, which
the Palestinians call assassinations, have taken place since the
current intifada began in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   According to people present at the Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon strongly defended a range of tactics, including mass
arrests and targeted killings, that his government says are meant to
preempt Palestinian attacks inside Israeli cities and towns.</TE>
<TE>   The latest military crackdown in the West Bank has corresponded
with more than a month of relative calm inside Israel, but in the
past, gruesome suicide attacks have occasionally occurred even during
times of stringent clampdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Also Sunday, in the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers fired toward a
group of protesters approaching a military checkpoint near the
settlement bloc of Gush Katif. A Palestinian cameraman on assignment
for Associated Press Television News was injured when his head was
grazed by a bullet, the news agency reported.</TE>

<HD>Cornered N. Korea Will Stand Firm, Critics Say</HD>
<DH>Washington wants the regime to forswear its nuclear
objectives. But many observers believe further isolating it is not
the answer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's strategy to pressure North Korea into
repudiating its nuclear ambitions through international isolation and
economic sanctions is meeting a skeptical response from critics in
South Korea and elsewhere who say it simply will not work.</LD>
<LD>   The critics, who include many diplomats and veteran Korea
watchers, say that the United States' refusal to enter direct
negotiations with North Korea and a decision to refer the issue to
the United Nations will only make the regime dig in its heels.
Meanwhile, they say, sanctions against a country that is already one
of the poorest and most repressive in the world are more likely to
produce a humanitarian disaster than a change of policy.</LD>
<LD>   "Economic sanctions, blockades, punishment will only make the
situation worse," said Moon Chung In, a North Korea specialist with
Yonsei University who has close ties to the South Korean government.</LD>
<TE>   South Korea's Nobel Peace Prize-winning President Kim Dae Jung and
the president-elect, Roh Moo Hyun, who is scheduled to take office
Feb. 25, are hoping that South Korea can open a line of communication
between the United States and North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that if this goes to the U.N. Security Council, it will
take more time and drag on," said Yoo Jay Kun, an assemblyman who
serves as an advisor to Roh. "We would rather see America directly
engaged with North Korea."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Secretary of State James A. Kelly is expected to visit
Seoul during the second week of January to meet with Roh. Shortly
afterward, Roh plans to send an envoy to the North Korean capital,
Pyongyang, perhaps with a message from the U.S. administration, Yoo
said.</TE>
<TE>   The North Koreans have refused to discuss the issue of nuclear
weapons with either South Korea or Japan and have instead sought
direct talks with the United States. They take the position that the
1994 agreement under which they were supposed to relinquish their
nuclear program in return for energy assistance was a bilateral one
with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has been equally adamant that it does not
want to become mired in what would surely be protracted and difficult
talks with the North Koreans. Since President Bush took office, there
has been one official visit of a U.S. envoy to Pyongyang -- an
October trip by Kelly during which the North Koreans were forced to
admit that they were secretly trying to enrich uranium for nuclear
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The administration takes the view that North Korea's pursuit of
weapons of mass destruction is a matter of concern for the entire
international community, not just the United States, and that
negotiating at this time would be succumbing to nuclear blackmail.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that North Korea was caught red-handed with the
uranium-enrichment program -- in clear violation of the 1994
agreement -- cast doubt on their trustworthiness as far as future
deals are concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "The North Koreans have lied about every agreement they've signed.
How can you deal with them?" said a Western diplomat here.</TE>
<TE>   Even many critics acknowledge that the White House is right in
principle. But they say the approach is wrong in practice and will
only make the North Koreans more determined and more dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "On the one hand, they have a point. But being so rigid and
refusing to negotiate with the North Koreans is a big mistake. It is
simplistic, it is idiotic, to think that any negotiation is a
concession. It could easily be a big disaster," said Daniel Pinkston,
a North Korea specialist at the Institute for Nonproliferation
Studies in Monterey, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Another advocate of direct negotiations is Donald P. Gregg, the
U.S. ambassador to South Korea under the previous Bush administration
and chairman of the Korea Society.</TE>
<TE>   "Washington keeps saying, 'We won't reward bad behavior,' and the
problem is that now the Bush administration has a 'face' problem --
because the more they say that, the more it makes it harder and
harder to start talking," Gregg said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the hang-ups for the Bush administration is the specter of
what happened in 1993-94 when the Clinton administration was
confronted with a similar challenge from North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, North Korea threatened to pull out of the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty and then started removing spent fuel rods
from its 5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, presumably to extract
weapons-grade plutonium.</TE>
<TE>   The end result was the 1994 agreement under which the U.S., with
funding from South Korea, Japan and the European Union, pledged to
build for North Korea two "safe" light-water reactors for its energy
needs and to supply it with 550,000 tons of fuel oil annually until
the reactors were completed. The Bush administration has never liked
the deal, which was brokered by former President Carter and which it
sees as unduly generous to the North Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Snyder, the Seoul representative of the Asia Society, notes
that the Clinton administration also insisted at the beginning of the
earlier crisis that there would be no negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "It took months for a negotiating avenue to be determined and for
the U.S. to come to the table. We are in a very similar situation,"
Snyder said.</TE>
<TE>   Many seasoned diplomats believe that the Bush administration --
whether directly or indirectly, through its allies -- will eventually
negotiate a settlement of the standoff with the North Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation will likely get much worse before it gets better,
but I don't think it will go down to disaster," said Han Sung Joo,
South Korea's foreign minister during the previous crisis.</TE>

<HD>Cloned Girl Will Fly to U.S. Today, Firm Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The company that claims to have created the world's first cloned
human says the baby, nicknamed "Eve," is coming to the United States
today.</LD>
<LD>   The baby is flying into the country with her family, Brigitte
Boisselier said Sunday, two days after she announced the child's
birth. Boisselier is chief executive of Clonaid, the cloning company
affiliated with a religious sect that believes space aliens started
life on Earth.</LD>
<LD>   "The baby is going home, and once at home it is possible for an
independent expert to go there, and once a sample is taken, we will
see," she said, referring to DNA testing needed to prove the child is
a clone. "[Today], if a sample is taken, perhaps by the end of the
week or early next week we should have all the details."</LD>
<TE>   Boisselier previously said the child's mother is American but has
offered no further details. On Sunday, neither she nor Clonaid
spokeswoman Nadine Gary would say where in the United States the
mother is from, where the child was born or what U.S. city they would
be arriving in.</TE>
<TE>   Both said details were being kept secret to protect the child and
her family.</TE>
<TE>   Boisselier's comments Sunday came two days after she announced at
a Florida news conference that Clonaid scientists had produced the
world's first cloned baby. She said "Eve," a healthy 7-pound girl,
was delivered by Caesarean section Thursday and is an exact genetic
copy of her mother.</TE>
<TE>   Boisselier offered no scientific proof, provided no photographs
and did not produce the child or the mother, who she said is a
31-year-old with an infertile husband. Her announcement was met with
doubt by the scientific community and revulsion by many ethicists.</TE>
<TE>   To gain convincing proof that "Eve" is a clone, Boisselier said
she had accepted an offer by a former ABC News science editor who has
chosen independent experts to draw DNA from the mother and the
newborn and test them for a match.</TE>
<TE>   Clonaid was founded by Claude Vorilhon, a former French journalist
and leader of a sect called the Raelians. Vorilhon, who calls himself
Rael, claims a space alien visiting him in 1973 revealed that
extraterrestrials had created all life on Earth through genetic
engineering.</TE>
<TE>   Boisselier, who claims two chemistry degrees, identifies herself
as a Raelian "bishop" and said Clonaid retains philosophical but not
economic links to the Raelians.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Boisselier said that a pediatrician has seen the baby
and that the child is "doing fine." She also said a second cloned
baby is due to be born next week to a lesbian couple in northern
Europe. Boisselier had previously announced that four other couples,
including the lesbians, were expected to give birth to
Clonaid-created clones by early February.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has no specific law against human cloning. But
the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates human experiments,
says its regulations forbid human cloning without prior agency
permission, and it has begun an investigation into whether Clonaid
illegally performed any work on U.S. soil.</TE>

<HD>Study Finds Less Use of Drugs With Random Testing</HD>
<DH>Oregon pilot program shows reduced usage among
student-athletes compared with their counterparts who were not
tested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Student-athletes subject to random drug testing at an Oregon high
school were almost four times less likely to use drugs than their
counterparts at a similar school who were not tested, a study shows.</LD>
<LD>   The one-year pilot study by researchers at Oregon Health &amp;
Sciences University compared Wahtonka High School in The Dalles,
where all student-athletes were subject to random testing, and
Warrenton High School, a demographically similar school near Astoria,
where they were not.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 135 athletes subject to the random testing at Wahtonka,
5.3% said they were using illicit drugs by the end of the school
year, versus 19.4% of the 141 athletes at Warrenton.</LD>
<TE>   They also were three times less likely to use
performance-enhancing substances such as steroids, according to the
survey responses, which were confidential.</TE>
<TE>   The study, conducted during the 1999-2000 school year, was funded
by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, an arm of the National
Institutes of Health. The results are being published in next month's
Journal of Adolescent Health.</TE>
<TE>   "The differences between the schools were dramatic," said Dr. Linn
Goldberg, a lead researcher in the study. "And the differences
between the non-athletes [who were not tested at either school but
who filled out questionnaires about drug use] were not significantly
there" -- 32.2% at Warrenton and 26.6% at Wahtonka.</TE>
<TE>   The study comes six months after the issue was thrown into the
spotlight by the U.S. Supreme Court. In June, the court ruled that
children attending public schools can be required to participate in
drug testing if they join any competitive after-school activity, from
football to chess.</TE>
<TE>   Merry Holland, principal at Wahtonka, said the school has
continued to test athletes since the study ended.</TE>
<TE>   She said the program has helped curb drug use. But, she said, the
drug testing has also led some students to switch to substances that
are more difficult to track, such as beer.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of parties with alcohol," she said. "If they want
to stay with sports, and participate, they might switch to something
they think is harder to detect."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last few years, about 5% of schools nationwide have
required that athletes be drug-tested. About 2% have tested students
in other activities.</TE>
<TE>   The Oregon pilot study is the forerunner of a wider, three-year
study at 13 Oregon high schools.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed SATURN, for Student Athlete Testing Using Random
Notification, the wider study is meant to examine whether the threat
of testing keeps kids away from drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The study was suspended in its third year after a federal agency
expressed concerns about some of the methodology used in the study's
previous two years.</TE>
<TE>   The Office of Human Research Policy said the study violated a
number of federal regulations by not properly obtaining informed
consent from children or protecting research subjects from coercive
environments. The survey results used in the published study were not
affected.</TE>
<TE>   The agency issued a response this month offering to better ensure
student confidentiality, to stop using principals and coaches to
solicit participation in some schools, and to end financial
incentives for participating schools. Goldberg said researchers are
awaiting word on whether the study will be reinstated.</TE>

<HD>A Grieving Dad Takes His Own Vengeance</HD>
<DH>After his son was beaten to death by white supremacists, a
Phoenix man is hunting down the alleged killers. He has police
support.</DH>

<LD>Cole Bailey Sr. walks a fine line on the pavement where it happened.
He pictures his son lying here two months ago -- bleeding, groaning,
begging for mercy.</LD>
<LD>   He glares at the ground. He stands over the spot where his son was
punched and kicked and stomped, where 20-year-old Cole Jr., an
innocent bystander caught up in a vicious bar brawl, took his last
faint breaths.</LD>
<LD>   "At some point tonight," Cole Sr. says, "I'll probably break down
all over again."</LD>
<TE>   But also at some point tonight, Cole Sr. will probably read the
police report again, sort through a few more leads again -- and again
-- because Cole Sr. is no ordinary grieving father.</TE>
<TE>   He's a hunter, stalking the suspects in his son's killing, one by
one.</TE>
<TE>   Ten days ago, he caught his first. After two months of working the
phones, huddling with private investigators, directing his squad of
ex-Marines and security guards from the Arizona nightclubs he owns,
Cole Sr. tracked down Chris Whitley, a 24-year-old white supremacist.</TE>
<TE>   Through go-betweens, Cole Sr. sent Whitley an ominous message:
Surrender or face a father's wrath.</TE>
<TE>   So, days before Christmas, in a bizarre confrontation, Whitley met
with Cole Sr. at a Phoenix coffee shop.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of the hardest and strangest things I've done in my
life," Cole Sr. says. The grief-stricken father sat directly across
from his son's suspected killer, whose face and head are covered with
tattoos.</TE>
<TE>   Whitley ordered a hamburger, and he let it sit while he rambled
and justified himself and admitted nothing. "I wanted to get a full
admission," Cole Sr. says. "But the only thing he said was that
Cole's death was wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the meeting was a victory for Cole Sr. He got the chance to
look Whitley hard in the eye before undercover police officers,
posing as customers, swarmed and made the arrest. More important,
Cole Sr. managed to contain his rage. Had the meeting taken place
right after the killing, he admits, it might not have gone the same
way.</TE>
<TE>   "In those first days," he says, "I felt like I needed to do to
them what they did to my son. And I felt I would give my life to do
it. Time goes on, you think a little differently."</TE>
<TE>   He walks a fine line, he concedes, between vengeance and justice.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, in the very next breath, he says he's now turning his
full attention to Samuel Colin Compton, 26, suspected leader of the
mob that set upon his son. "He's the one I have a passion for," he
says, predicting that Compton's capture won't be peaceful. "This is
the type of guy that, if somebody comes between him and his freedom,
they're going to suffer consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Cole Sr. isn't afraid, he says. And his bravery has little to do
with the .40-caliber Sig Sauer he carries. "The anguish I feel inside
overpowers the fear."</TE>
<TE>   While Phoenix police say Cole Sr. should be afraid of the suspects
-- some of whom have spent time in prison -- they refrain from
condemning his hunt. In fact, police are including Cole Sr. in their
investigation and helping with his.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a father who's not going to stand by idly and watch the
people who murdered his son roam freely," says Sgt. Randy Force, a
Phoenix police spokesman. "As a father myself, I can understand what
would drive a father to do what Cole Bailey Sr. is doing."</TE>
<TE>   Cole Sr. looks nothing like a hunter, and even less like a father.
At age 38, dressed all in black, with long black hair and gold hoop
earrings, he looks like someone's rebellious teenage son.</TE>
<TE>   He became a father young, he explains. An 18-year-old Navy seaman
when Cole Jr. was born, he was surprised by fatherhood -- then caught
off guard by its emotional hold.</TE>
<TE>   Cole Jr. was born with a heart defect, and he wavered for months
between life and death. "The first year of his life I'd stay awake
every night and watch him to make sure he didn't stop breathing. I
was probably overdoing it a little," Cole Sr. says.</TE>
<TE>   But such is the power children have over you, he says.</TE>
<TE>   After Cole Sr. separated from Cole Jr.'s mother, Cole Jr. lived
with his father. Father and son got along well, Cole Sr. says, but
lately they had been arguing. Cole Jr. had fallen behind in the
payments on his Mustang, and Cole Sr. was frustrated. The day his son
died, Cole Sr. scolded him.</TE>
<TE>   "It brings you to your knees," Cole Sr. says. "If you could just
have a few minutes to say some other words."</TE>
<TE>   The three suspects named in Cole Jr.'s killing have ties to white
supremacist groups, police say, and Cole Jr. didn't know them or
their world. He merely wandered into the path of their unpredictable
hatred.</TE>
<TE>   It was Oct. 16, about 8:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Cole Jr. stood outside River City Pockets, a pool hall where he
had just applied for work as a bartender. He was waiting for a taxi,
going to see his girlfriend, who was sick with the flu.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, a fight erupted inside the pool hall. Several skinheads,
ejected from the hall, began goose-stepping around the parking lot,
shouting, "White Power!"</TE>
<TE>   Police say the skinheads spotted Cole Jr. -- shy, bespectacled,
painfully soft-spoken. He stood 5 feet 9 inches and weighed barely
130 pounds. (He also had a pacemaker, because of his congenital heart
defect.)</TE>
<TE>   Cole Sr. -- who interviewed nearly every witness -- says Compton
confronted Cole Jr. and asked what he was looking at.</TE>
<TE>   Cole Jr. didn't answer.</TE>
<TE>   Compton, tall and burly, allegedly marched toward Cole Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "He walked up to my son and punched him straight between the eyes
with brass knuckles," Cole Sr. says.</TE>
<TE>   Cole Jr.'s glasses went flying as he fell to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "He rolled over to his hands and knees," Cole Sr. says. "He
crawled about 3 feet and gathered enough of his senses, and had
enough adrenaline, to run."</TE>
<TE>   But the mob gave chase.</TE>
<TE>   "One of them pulled my son to the ground and the other two began
kicking him with their steel-toed boots in the head and the body.
While he could speak, he said, 'No, please, I was just waiting for a
taxi.' "</TE>
<TE>   When Cole Jr. went limp, his attackers ran -- except one, who
allegedly delivered one last "field-goal kick" to Cole Jr.'s head.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested that last alleged attacker two days later, Cole
Sr. says. While police have named three suspects, Cole Sr. believes
there are six.</TE>
<TE>   Cole Sr. visits the crime scene frequently. Each visit hurts, he
says. But there is always the chance of learning something new.</TE>
<TE>   Now, standing where his son waited for the taxi, Cole Sr. turns to
see a man emerge from the shadows. The man comes forward slowly,
haltingly, and introduces himself: He was the bouncer at the pool
hall the night of the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "Joe," he says, shaking Cole Sr.'s hand. "I've been wanting to
talk to you."</TE>
<TE>   Joe tells Cole Sr. how the fight in the pool hall started, how
violent it became, how quickly he managed to get everyone out the
door. Only minutes passed, he says, before someone ran inside and
told him what was happening in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "I came out," he says. "And saw -- you know."</TE>
<TE>   "Where was he?" Cole Sr. whispers.</TE>
<TE>   "His feet were right about here," Joe says. "His head was here."</TE>
<TE>   They stand over the spot.</TE>
<TE>   "What was his appearance?" Cole Sr. asks.</TE>
<TE>   Joe clears his throat. He doesn't want to answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Please," Cole Sr. says.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't know how to describe it," he says. "I never seen
anything like it. I wouldn't want to choose the wrong words."</TE>
<TE>   "Were his eyes open?"</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't tell," Joe says. "His eyes were so covered in blood, I
couldn't tell if they were open or not."</TE>
<TE>   Cole Sr. barrages Joe with questions: Was Cole Jr. breathing? Was
he conscious? Was anyone with him at the end?</TE>
<TE>   Joe answers each question plainly, but reluctantly, seeing how the
answers fall like blows on the father. Finally he walks back to the
pool hall.</TE>
<TE>   Cole Sr. takes a last look around the parking lot. He stares at
the cars, the pavement, the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   "Those must have been the longest three minutes of his life," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Then, shoulders hunched against the cold, he returns to his car,
to his grief.</TE>
<TE>   To the hunt.</TE>

<HD>FBI Seeks 5 Men in Terrorism Probe</HD>
<DH>Agency officials say they may have entered the country
illegally on Christmas Eve and may have knowledge about terrorist
activities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Peterson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The FBI said Sunday that it was seeking information about five men
who may have entered the United States illegally on Christmas Eve and
who possibly have knowledge of terrorist activities.</LD>
<LD>   FBI officials appealed to the public for help in finding the men,
who are of interest because of information developed through
investigations into terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   In a posting featured on its Web site (www.fbi.gov) Sunday, the
FBI displayed color photographs of the men, who were tentatively
identified as Abid Noraiz Ali, 25; Iftikhar Khozmai Ali, 21; Mustafa
Khan Owasi, 33; Adil Pervez, 19; and Akbar Jamal, 28. The photos
appear over the words "War on Terrorism."</LD>
<TE>   "Although the FBI has no specific information that these
individuals are connected to any potential terrorist activities,
based upon information developed in the course of ongoing
investigations, the FBI would like to locate and question these
persons," the bureau's announcement said.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI provided no further details, but CNN reported that the men
may have entered the United States through the border with Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Immigration and Naturalization Service also had
little to disclose Sunday. Dan Kane, an INS spokesman, said only that
the immigration agency has "implemented additional measures to look
for these individuals."</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear under what circumstances the men may have
illegally entered the country. Inspectors at U.S. ports of entry rely
on watch lists, which include names of suspected terrorists that
intelligence agencies are supposed to provide. Inspectors also have
access to consular data from State Department computers, which
include information on visa applications and photographs taken
overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Visas to enter the United States are granted by the State
Department, although nationals of many countries, including much of
Europe, do not need them.</TE>
<TE>   The INS has long been maligned for doing an inadequate job of
policing the borders.</TE>
<TE>   In its news release, the FBI cautioned that the names and ages of
the men sought may be fictitious. The bureau said it was working with
the Customs Service, INS and Transportation Security Administration
to hunt for the men. The bureau noted that information "has also been
disseminated to the appropriate law enforcement agencies around the
United States and throughout the world."</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone with any information pertaining to these individuals is
asked to contact their nearest FBI office," the FBI said.</TE>
<TE>   The report of the possible illegal border crossing comes three
years after U.S. authorities captured a terrorist who planned to bomb
Los Angeles International Airport during celebrations surrounding New
Year's Day in 2000. Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian national tied to a
Montreal terrorism network with links to the Middle East, was caught
at the Washington border with Canada in a car filled with explosives
on Dec. 14, 1999.</TE>

<HD>Liberty, Ellis Island Tour Numbers Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Since last year's terrorist attacks, tourism has plummeted at the
Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, across the harbor from the World
Trade Center site.</LD>
<LD>   Some foreigners are staying away from New York, domestic visitors
are spending less time and tight security remains in effect at
Liberty Island, considered a target for terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   In the last year, an estimated 2.5 million visitors rode the
ferries from Lower Manhattan to Liberty and Ellis islands, according
to the National Park Service, which oversees the sites.</LD>
<TE>   That is half the number who made the trip in 2000, and well below
the more than 4 million who had visited in 2001 before Sept. 11,
which prompted a 100-day shutdown of the national monuments.</TE>
<TE>   The figures reflect a decline of as much as 20% in the number of
foreign tourists, who in normal times stay longer than domestic
tourists, and are more likely to visit the Statue of Liberty and
Ellis Island, with its displays detailing the history of the
country's immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the number of domestic visitors to New York City in
general has remained the same or even surpassed pre-Sept. 11 figures
-- about 30 million a year, according to NYC &amp; Co., the city's
tourism bureau.</TE>
<TE>   And although the city in general has shown signs of a tourism
recovery, various factors keep the two iconic islands in the harbor
from drawing the crowds they once did.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent winter day at the boarding dock in Battery Park,
hundreds of people still packed a ferry to make that trip.</TE>
<TE>   "Seeing the statue still gives me goose bumps!" said Murray Gould,
70, of Potomac, Md., who first sailed into New York harbor in 1938,
barely escaping the Nazis as a 6-year-old Jewish refugee from Poland.</TE>
<TE>   National Park Service spokesman Brian Feeney said that, because
domestic visitors spend fewer days in the city, some decide to skip
the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, a boat ride that consumes the
better part of a day.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Feeney said, many people assume that all of Liberty
Island is still off-limits.</TE>

<HD>Health-Care Storm Brewing in California Threatens to Swamp
U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An alarm bell is ringing in California. Will President Bush and the
new Republican majority in Congress respond?</LD>
<LD>   The alarm is warning of an approaching catastrophe in the
health-care system. It's a perfect storm collision of threatening
trends.</LD>
<LD>   From one side, the sagging economy and skyrocketing costs of
insurance are pressuring more employers to drop health-care coverage
for their workers. From the other side, the cavernous deficits in
state budgets are forcing governors and legislators to slash
Medicaid, the joint state-federal health program for the poor. As
these two trends meet, the result could be a tidal wave in the number
of Americans without access to health care.</LD>
<TE>   As is often the case, that wave is hitting the beach first in
California.</TE>
<TE>   Even in good times, an unusually large share of Californians lack
health insurance -- mostly because the state has so many small
employers (who are less likely to provide coverage) and new
immigrants, many of them here illegally, working in low-wage jobs
that don't offer insurance.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Census Bureau, almost one in five Californians
lacked health insurance in 2001, one of the highest figures in the
country; a statewide UCLA survey puts the figure at a smaller, but
still daunting, one in six. All evidence suggests the problem got
worse this year.</TE>
<TE>   Ordinarily, this would be precisely the time the state expands its
health-care safety net to catch those losing private insurance. But
instead, under the pressure of a budget deficit that could hit $35
billion over the next 18 months, Gov. Gray Davis has proposed two
major retrenchments in the state's Medicaid program, known as
Medi-Cal.</TE>
<TE>   One proposal would toughen paperwork requirements for recipients
in a way meant to weed out adults already on the rolls; the second
would reduce the number of uninsured low-income adults eligible for
benefits in the future. Together, these two changes are expected to
reduce the Medi-Cal rolls by roughly 500,000 through June 2004.
That's more than one-third the total number of Americans who lost
health-care coverage across the entire nation in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   And that's not all. These cutbacks are coming after the budget
crunch last year forced Davis to shelve an expansion of the state's
Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers children in working
poor families. Following a national trend, Davis wanted to open the
program to the children's parents, nearly 300,000 low-income workers
in all. But now that idea is indefinitely on hold. And Davis aides
privately acknowledge that, as he scrambles to close the massive
budget shortfall, he may propose further cuts in Medi-Cal next year.</TE>
<TE>   The state budget squeeze is most severe in California, but
virtually every state is sliding into this same ravine. In a study
last week, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal
think tank in Washington, reported that the states are facing a
combined deficit of at least $60 billion to $85 billion in the coming
budget year.</TE>
<TE>   Those shortfalls, the center calculated, equal at least 13%, and
maybe as much as 18%, of state spending. States haven't faced
deficits that deep for at least 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, those deficits are forcing states to point their
knives at Medicaid, now the second-largest cost (behind elementary
and secondary education) in most state budgets. Besides California,
states this year considering significant reductions in eligibility
for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program include
Connecticut, Montana, Missouri, Nebraska and New Jersey; this month,
Tennessee's governor said he would appeal a court order blocking him
from eliminating Medicaid coverage for 200,000 recipients.</TE>
<TE>   In all, states are already considering Medicaid cuts that could
strip coverage from 1 million low-income people, the budget and
policy center reported. That number is guaranteed to rise as more
governors release their budgets over the next month.</TE>
<TE>   And all these Medicaid cuts, remember, are coming as the number of
workers receiving health coverage on the job is shrinking. It is as
if firefighters were dismantling their rescue equipment just as
survivors were jumping from a burning building.</TE>
<TE>   "The incredible stress we are all going to experience from that is
something that none of us have really grasped," says E. Richard
Brown, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all in for a very rude awakening when the results of these
kinds of cuts are really transmitted down to the level of the doctor
and the patient."</TE>
<TE>   States are hardly without blame. Many governors bought popularity
by excessively cutting taxes during the good times of the 1990s; now,
to avoid unconscionable reductions (not only in health care but also
education), most will have to bite the bullet of asking for tax
increases.</TE>
<TE>   But even if governors accept that responsibility, the impending
Medicaid disaster is not a problem the states can handle alone; their
budget shortfalls are too big. "The problem is nationwide," says Stan
Rosenstein of California's Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   "The cost of health care far exceeds the ability of states to fund
during a revenue decline."</TE>
<TE>   In July, the Senate (with support from 27 Republicans) voted to
temporarily raise the federal contribution to Medicaid by $6 billion.
But Bush opposed the idea and it died in the House; he has proposed
to send states half that much to subsidize not only health care but
all social services during the downturn. That's little more than a
gesture. Even the original Senate proposal now looks inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   Health care is returning to Washington's agenda, with the two
major political parties developing proposals to expand coverage for
the uninsured through tax credits either for individuals
(Republicans) or businesses (Democrats). But if Washington stands
aside while the Medicaid safety net unravels, nothing else it does
will overcome the damage.</TE>
<TE>   More families without care, longer lines in emergency rooms, more
hospitals and public clinics bleeding red ink, more kids sick at
school: That's what is looming if Washington continues to close its
ears to the health-care alarm ringing now in California -- and soon
in state capitals from coast to coast.</TE>

<HD>Scholars Advise Illinois Governor on Issuing Blanket
Clemency</HD>
<DH>Group says he has the right to commute the sentences of all
inmates on death row.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>As Illinois Gov. George Ryan decides whether to commute the sentences
of some death row inmates, hundreds of the nation's law professors
want him to know that he would be justified in granting clemency to
all of them.</LD>
<LD>   The legal scholars planned to deliver that opinion today in an
open letter to Ryan bearing more than 400 of their signatures, the
latest act in a hard-fought public relations battle over Illinois'
death row inmates.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan halted the state's executions nearly three years ago after
courts found that 13 death row inmates had been wrongly convicted
since the state resumed capital punishment in 1977.</LD>
<TE>   Now the governor is reviewing clemency requests from more than 140
death row inmates and has said he will rule before he leaves office
Jan. 13. About 160 inmates are on death row.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, the legal scholars take exception to some death
penalty supporters' view that Ryan should consider clemency only on a
case-by-case basis.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel compelled to share with you our considered judgment that,
in our country, the power of executive clemency is not so limited,"
the letter said. "To the contrary, where circumstances warrant,
executive clemency should be and has in fact been used as a means to
correct systemic injustice."</TE>
<TE>   The governor has described blanket commutation of death sentences
to life without parole as being "on the back burner," but he will
consider the professors' letter, spokesman Dennis Culloton said.</TE>
<TE>   Cook County State's Atty. Richard Devine, one of those most
publicly opposed to a blanket clemency, said the professors have
missed the point.</TE>
<TE>   "We have never disputed that the governor has unlimited powers to
grant clemency, but we believe that granting blanket clemency would
be an abuse of that power," said Devine's spokeswoman, Marcy Jensen.</TE>
<TE>   The professors' letter doesn't take a position on whether the
governor should commute all death row inmates' sentences.</TE>
<TE>   New York University law professor Anthony Amsterdam said the
professors are sending the letter to Ryan "to make him feel that he
can consult his own conscience and decide what he thinks is right."</TE>
<TE>   Amsterdam, who organized the letter-signing campaign, said the
power of clemency is broad enough "to allow the governor to use his
own sense of justice and right in issuing commutations."</TE>
<TE>   New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya commuted the sentences of all death
row inmates in 1986. Arkansas Gov. Winthrop Rockefeller did it in
1970.</TE>

<HD>Ventura Couple See Stoicism, Need on Visit to Afghanistan</HD>
<DH>The physician and his wife, a nurse, bring medical relief
to a war-weary people who lack supplies, money and expertise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carrying little more than an abiding passion for Afghanistan, Dr.
Cedric Emery and his wife, Norma, flew into Kabul last month with a
simple question: How can we help?</LD>
<LD>   A few days later, Cedric was doing surgery and Norma, a nurse, was
setting up a clinic in an orphanage for 850 children.</LD>
<LD>   "I had absolutely no expectations," said Emery, a Ventura
urologist. "I thought we might be sitting around drinking tea for a
month."</LD>
<TE>   The couple, who recently returned to Southern California from a
two-week stay in Afghanistan, are no strangers to the battle-scarred
Central Asian nation. They met there in 1967, when Norma was a Peace
Corps volunteer and Cedric worked as a family physician with the U.S.
Public Health Service. They returned to Afghanistan in 1972 and 1976,
to visit and train surgeons.</TE>
<TE>   But since the Sept. 11 terror attacks and subsequent war in
Afghanistan, both have been itching to see what became of the
Afghans, a people they grew to love for their kindness, toughness and
hospitality.</TE>
<TE>   "The country is awe-inspiring," Norma said. "If you make an Afghan
friend, you make a friend for life."</TE>
<TE>   After weighing the security risks, the couple decided this fall
that the time was right. They flew to Dubai and then to Kabul aboard
a jet owned by Ariana, the tiny national airline of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Upon arrival, they checked into the Kabul Hotel and soon
discovered that, aside from government ministers and heavily armed
bodyguards, they were the only guests.</TE>
<TE>   "We went in cold, on our own," said Cedric Emery, 63. "Kabul was
almost the same except for 2 million more people and lots of taxis
from Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Norma traveled to an orphanage she had heard about.
She brought hats, gloves and scarves that had been donated by friends
in Ventura and Santa Paula. The staff appreciated the gifts but were
puzzled by the 60-year-old nurse.</TE>
<TE>   "They hemmed and hawed, not knowing what to do with me," she
recalled. "I told them I would clean windows, organize classrooms,
wash hair, whatever they needed."</TE>
<TE>   She noticed the children suffered from poor hygiene, so she set up
a tooth brushing and cleanliness program. Many children suffered from
flu, skin rashes and untreated stomach ailments.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't go to a hospital until they were dying," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Norma cleaned up a dirty, empty room in the orphanage. Then she
and an Afghan pharmacist went to the bazaar and ordered 11 metal beds
to be made along with pillows and mattresses.</TE>
<TE>   They put in poles for IV bags and medicine cabinets, and painted
the room. Soon they had a new clinic and found a doctor who would
visit once a week.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked fabulous," she said, noting it was all done for about
$1,000. "That room will be used for very sick children." She also
bought two pairs of shoes for the guards at the orphanage gate, who
hadn't been paid in seven months.</TE>
<TE>   Across the city, Dr. Emery headed for Ali Abad Hospital, the only
facility he knew of in Afghanistan with a urology wing. He met Dr.
Hassan Manawi, the only English-speaking, foreign-trained physician
at the hospital, who was teaching all the other doctors urology
procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Emery watched in awe and horror as complex surgery was done with
primitive instruments that resembled something from the Civil War
era. Clamps were corroded, sutures scarce and sterilizing solution
tightly rationed. When doctors didn't have gloves, they operated
without them.</TE>
<TE>   Patient charts weren't the hefty tomes found in U.S. hospitals.
They were often just a single page. But at least the hospital had
anesthesia.</TE>
<TE>   "The patients would walk into the operating room in their bare
feet and take off all their clothes," Emery said. "Then they would
lie on the table. When the operation was over, the patient was taken
out, the table was wiped down and the next patient was sent in."</TE>
<TE>   A day later, Emery was doing surgery with instruments he would
have thrown out at home.</TE>
<TE>   "I made do," he said with a grin. "Just like the Afghans."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the primitive conditions and occasional post-operative
infections, Emery said most surgeries were successful. The hospital's
seven urologists perform 1,200 operations each year. Emery was
especially impressed with the stoic, grateful nature of the patients.</TE>
<TE>   "I never heard one complaint," he said. "It was refreshing."</TE>
<TE>   Family members brought the patients' food. When blood was needed,
a relative would sit in the operating room and donate blood,
transfused straight into the person on the table. Pain medication was
virtually unknown, but the Afghans showed an uncanny ability to
tolerate discomfort.</TE>
<TE>   "It's wonderful in a way because the doctors make do and the
patients do well," Emery said. "You are appalled on one hand, but
impressed on the other."</TE>
<TE>   Emery did a dozen surgeries at the hospital and taught at the
medical school. Physicians told him horror stories of Taliban troops
ransacking and vandalizing the hospitals, often out of sheer spite.</TE>
<TE>   "They were like the brownshirts of Nazi Germany," he said. "The
Afghans love America for getting rid of these people."</TE>
<TE>   But while making do is admirable, Emery said many Afghans die
because of a lack of basic medical tools.</TE>
<TE>   Scalpels, sutures, retractors and clamps are in short supply. More
important, the Afghans lack endoscopy equipment, which can look into
the bladder, prostate and urethra to detect cancer and other major
problems. Such tools can cost $100,000, and Emery has already sent
letters to manufacturers, seeking donations of equipment.</TE>
<TE>   He also has asked urology colleagues around the country for
donations of basic surgical equipment. "If we can get the endoscopy
equipment, then I will go back and show them how to use it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the hardships, Emery, a partner in a Ventura medical
group, called the trip "wildly successful."</TE>
<TE>   "This was the best thing that ever happened to me," he said. "We
learned a lot and grew a lot."</TE>
<TE>   His wife, a nurse at hospitals in Ventura and Santa Paula, is also
eager to return. Aside from Afghanistan, she has traveled to Vietnam
and China as part of Operation Smile, which does restorative surgery
on children with cleft palates.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the lesson in all of this is that one person can make a
change," she said. "If you are willing to reach out and look for
opportunities."</TE>

<HD>Reagan Building a Shining Success</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. Reza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four years after its unveiling as the crown jewel of downtown Santa
Ana, the mammoth Ronald Reagan Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse
is nearing capacity. And some nearby merchants said the facility is
boosting downtown business as well.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said about 10,000 square feet of office space remains
vacant in the building, most of it courtrooms and offices that will
be filled when Congress approves three more U.S. District Court
judges for the county. Office space in the building totals 517,360
square feet.</LD>
<LD>   "Vacancy is not a problem. The U.S. Attorney's office and marshal
recently expanded their presence in the building," said Allen
Leslein, architect for the U.S. Central District of California, which
includes Orange County. "The Bankruptcy Court is pretty much at full
steam. If it wasn't for the empty courtrooms [where criminal and
civil trials are held], most of the office space would be taken up."</LD>
<TE>   Leslein said that as more employees are moved to the Ronald Reagan
building, the space they leave behind in other buildings is quickly
filled by other federal workers. Twenty years ago, most federal
agencies in Orange County, including the IRS and FBI, were housed in
the old Federal Building at the Santa Ana Civic Center.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the FBI occupies 25,000 square feet of private office space
in Santa Ana, said General Services Administration spokeswoman
Bethany Rich.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be ideal to have the FBI and other federal law
enforcement agencies in the Ronald Reagan Building, but the available
space there doesn't meet the needs of these agencies," said Rich.</TE>
<TE>   When completed in January 1999, the Ronald Reagan building was
expected to accommodate federal prosecutors and judges in Orange
County. Previously, federal trials were held in modular courtrooms on
the southwest corner of the Civic Center.</TE>
<TE>   Almost from the day construction began, the elegant structure with
gleaming green glass and travertine marble was trumpeted as an
economic boon to Santa Ana, which had just begun an ambitious
downtown redevelopment program.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-story building occupies what used to be a couple of city
blocks and towers over the two- and three-story brick buildings that
have been fixtures in the downtown area for about 70 years. Its
modern facade of glass and light-colored marble, accented by a huge
gold-colored U.S. seal, stands out but also complements the red brick
buildings built three generations ago, many say.</TE>
<TE>   "I love what the new building has done for downtown and my
restaurant," said Laverna Gilbert, manager of Shelly's Bistro, across
from the Ronald Reagan building. "Business has tripled since it
opened. We had to remodel and put a patio outside to accommodate our
customers."</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert said her growing customer base includes the building's
employees and its visitors, who also show up for live jazz on Friday
and Saturday nights when the restaurant remains open until 11:30 p.m.
But she admits there are days when the restaurant is not as busy.
Those days usually coincide with the slow days at the federal
building, said Gilbert.</TE>
<TE>   When the building opened in 1999, officials estimated that as many
as 4,000 people would use it every day for business. But often the
areas that are accessible to the public are empty. Leslein said the
courthouse corridors look empty at times because of "the nature of
how court business is conducted these days."</TE>
<TE>   "Nowadays, a lot of court work is done in chambers and through
telephonic conferences. A lot of legal issues get resolved without
going to trial," he said.</TE>

<HD>With a Last-Minute Grant, Probation Officer Can Continue
Crime Fight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Without warning at least one night a week, Steve Sandoval takes to
Fullerton's roughest neighborhoods to check up on his charges, joined
by a police officer for backup.</LD>
<LD>   As an Orange County deputy probation officer, Sandoval keeps track
of 40 to 50 young men and women who became involved with the city's
gangs.</LD>
<LD>   Many of them teens, they are on probation under terms that call
for curfews and require that they carry no weapons and stay away from
gang members.</LD>
<TE>   And they never know when Sandoval and his partner might show up.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities credit the unannounced visits with giving them a rare
advantage in their fight against gangs. The patrols, which began 11
years ago, are made possible by a program known as CUFFS (Communities
Uniting for Furthering Safety).</TE>
<TE>   At a time when many gang programs are being cut back, officials
said the Fullerton efforts show how a relatively small amount of
money -- about $300,000 a year -- can go a long way in combating
gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the city nearly lost the state grant that
covered the cost of sending Sandoval and a local officer into the
heart of gang territory for four hours a week. But the funding came
through at the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   As many surrounding communities scale back on gang enforcement
because of budget woes, Fullerton officials said these patrols are
making a difference. The number of gang killings more than doubled
across Orange County this year, to 35. Fullerton recorded one such
homicide this year and none last year.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton Officer Brent Rebert, who helped write the initial CUFFS
grant, said it is impossible to know how much crime has been deterred
by the program. But the consequences of eliminating it, he predicted,
would be severe.</TE>
<TE>   Rebert, now a high school resource officer who helps to identify
troubled youth, recently joined Sandoval on a tour through the maze
of streets and alleys controlled by two gangs that date back several
generations.</TE>
<TE>   Through his contacts, Sandoval knows many of the characters. Fresh
graffiti on dumpsters, garages and other buildings provides him with
clues about what's been going on since his last visit.</TE>
<TE>   "The graffiti is the neighborhood newspaper," Sandoval says,
noting a new moniker he hasn't figured out: "Confused."</TE>
<TE>   In Baker Street's west end territory, he spots three youths
sitting on a stoop and asks Rebert to pull over. Two of the boys
admit they are on probation.</TE>
<TE>   They are patted down for weapons, and their probation officers are
called to check them out. One of the youths is ordered to report to
his probation officer the next morning for a drug test.</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks away, Sandoval and Rebert approach a half-dozen young
men standing in a frontyard. The contact is brief this time because
none are on probation.</TE>
<TE>   The pair decide to drive across town to check on a teenager who
seems to be making steady progress in his efforts to break from a
gang. He landed a construction job and has been working for several
months.</TE>
<TE>   Sandoval says the teen has been making a good-faith attempt to
stay away from his former gang associates.</TE>
<TE>   But within minutes, the young man, who once went by the nickname
"Little Fatso," is being led out of his family's apartment in
handcuffs. A switchblade was found in his pocket.</TE>
<TE>   The teen says he used the knife to cut fruit. But he knows he made
a mistake by having it.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my first job, and now I'm losing it -- for a knife," he
said. "Do I regret it? Of course. Do you think I want to be arrested
right now?"</TE>
<TE>   Sandoval, who has given the young man a few breaks in the past for
breaking curfew, said he can't let him slide this time because it's a
matter of public safety.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted me to cut him another chance. I've done it before. But
something like this is a community risk," Sandoval says.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have been worse. It could have been a gun."</TE>

<HD>Float Builders Stick to 'Glue Man'</HD>
<DH>Bob Dickey, 80, brings adhesives, expertise and reassurance
to nervous decorators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joe Mathews</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Hey! Glue Man!"</LD>
<LD>   The eyes of South Pasadena's teenage float decorators turn toward
a Santa Claus look-alike emerging from a glue-white 1988 Nissan
pickup. Soon, the man is surrounded and showered with hugs and kisses
before he can break free and pose his favorite question:</LD>
<LD>   Is everything sticking together?</LD>
<TE>   Bob Dickey, an 80-year-old who appears two decades younger, is the
Rose Parade's glue consultant. To frantic decorators working late at
night, he is a human adhesive, the rare parade figure who binds the
competing float builders with reassurances that come Jan. 1, their
creations will hold.</TE>
<TE>   Each year on the day after Christmas, Dickey drives from his
Carlsbad home to stay with his sister in the Alhambra house in which
he grew up during the 1930s. From there, he spends evenings shuttling
to every float decorating barn in the San Gabriel Valley. At his
seven stops, he offers good humor and poor puns, dispenses tips on
dealing with water-based adhesives in freezing temperatures, and
replenishes supplies for decorators who run short.</TE>
<TE>   "So, Bob, where do you keep all the horses?" jokes South
Pasadena's decorating chairman, Dave Andrews, as he helps unload four
five-gallon cans from Dickey's truck -- an emergency replenishment
for the city's 155-foot-long train float, the longest in parade
history.</TE>
<TE>   "That, my friend," replies Dickey, "is a trade secret."</TE>
<TE>   "There's just a certain mystique about glue," said the Glue Man,
who introduces himself as such to get by security at the decorating
facilities. "When people find out that I do the glue, well, there's a
warm, friendly reaction."</TE>
<TE>   Though the flowers capture the public's imagination, it is glue
that remains the frantic backstage concern, a particularly sticky
subject.</TE>
<TE>   Glue is complicated -- there are eight major types used in the
decorating process, including one formulated for Rose Parade floats.
Glue is expensive -- in any float budget, it costs more than
everything but labor and flowers. And glue is potentially hazardous
-- some of the solvents used on flowers cause air pollution and are,
except for Rose Parade use, illegal.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of things with glues that can go wrong," said Jim
Hynd, floral director of Fiesta Parade Floats and a longtime friend
of Dickey. "It's important to have someone there to guide you along."</TE>
<TE>   Dickey's family moved to Southern California when he was 4; he
rarely missed a Rose Parade growing up. He served in the military,
became a chemical engineer, and worked for 3M and later for a glue
company.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring in 1986, Dickey approached a colleague from his 3M
days, who owns a small adhesives company, Coral Industries Inc., in
Santa Fe Springs. They decided to develop a line of glues for
builders. At that point, a large glue manufacturer had served the
parade. But Dickey, according to builders, was Coral's secret weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Working under a consultant's contract with Coral that pays him a
commission on glue sales, Dickey quickly made himself a staple of
parade life. He not only sold glue but provided on-site advice on its
application. Within a few years, Coral dominated the Rose Parade glue
business.</TE>
<TE>   Dickey also has helped float builders negotiate with air pollution
regulators. More than a decade ago, the South Coast Air Quality
Management District approved a clean-air plan that banned a number of
smog-producing solvents in floral glues used for the parade. That
wreaked two years of havoc, as float builders watched whole strips of
flowers, secured by weaker glues, peel off their floats. Eventually,
Dickey helped builders appeal to the AQMD.</TE>
<TE>   The district responded with an exemption, still in effect: "The
provision of this rule ... should not apply to adhesives used to glue
flowers to parade floats."</TE>
<TE>   "Float building is done at a time of year, December, when we do
not exceed the ozone standard," said Sam Atwood, an AQMD spokesman.
"Plus, the amount of adhesive used by Rose Parade float builders is
relatively small, and gluing flowers to the float is a unique
application and it may well be that an adhesive that would comply
with our regulations would not do an adequate job."</TE>
<TE>   8 Types of Glue</TE>
<TE>   As of Jan. 2, 2004, however, the AQMD will require that all glues
in Southern California -- the parade floats are not exempt on this
count -- not contain a number of toxic, chlorine-based compounds.
That could cause a tweaking of several parade glue formulas.</TE>
<TE>   All eight types of glue are vital, builders said, because each has
a unique use. Each is known by a number.</TE>
<TE>   The most common is white glue, or 4089, a moisture-resistant
adhesive engineered by Dickey himself and used in the first days of
decorating to laminate seeds, powders and flower petals.</TE>
<TE>   Decorators also employ contact cement (4124) to attach corn husks.
A rubber cement (4090) like that used by schoolchildren binds
delicate petals. Mosses and ferns are attached with sticky glue
(4026), which stays tacky almost indefinitely. An adhesive spray
(117) is used for repair work.</TE>
<TE>   Hot pan glue, which comes in pellet form, is melted to hold heavy
materials.(It is so dangerous that float builders usually don't let
volunteer decorators handle it). Some builders use a quick-setting
"oasis" glue -- sometimes buying it from a Coral competitor -- on
certain flowers.</TE>
<TE>   The piece de resistance, though, is 4137, the main glue to attach
whole flowers to floats. Applied to the back of a flower, it is left
to dry three or four minutes, then pressed into place.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be careful getting a lot of these glues on your
hands," said Toni Groves, a decorator on the float sponsored by Rain
Bird, the sprinkler company. "Some of this stuff sticks to you and
will stay with you for the rest of your life."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, some glues -- such as formula 4091 -- were
abandoned. "It burned the flowers," said Dickey. Glue once arrived in
55-gallon drums, but fire marshals objected. Now it is shipped in
five-gallon cans and then poured into foam cups or squeeze bottles
for application.</TE>
<TE>   By rule of thumb, builders need 125 gallons of glue per float. In
2002, Fiesta Parade Floats' order to cover 10 floats totaled 1,400
gallons.</TE>
<TE>   If such shipments prove not to be enough, Dickey -- at any time of
night -- will drive to the Santa Fe Springs factory for more. And if
the weather is cold -- which often means that the glue won't hold --
he can get Coral to tweak the formula.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm on call for anything," he said. "If there's a problem with
the glue, if they run out of something, I'm around to get them the
adhesive that they need."</TE>
<TE>   Starting His Rounds</TE>
<TE>   Wearing jeans, a light jacket and a baseball cap with an image of
the dwarf Grumpy, Dickey begins his rounds at 5 p.m. At a Duarte
decorating barn, he watches closely as volunteers apply white glue to
the face of Orville Wright for a float that recognizes the centennial
of powered flight. At the Charisma company's decorating tent near the
Rose Bowl, he gently chides owner Larry Crain, who is down to his
last 30 gallons of white glue and wants more.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't carry enough on your truck," Crain says.</TE>
<TE>   "You're supposed to order all you need from the plant ahead of
time," Dickey replies.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday night, with no glue emergencies, Dickey is done by 9.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got pretty much everything working the way it should," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Builders have nervously noted Dickey's advancing years. He says he
is contemplating retirement, but first must find and train a
successor.</TE>
<TE>   Dickey doesn't stay for the parade. On Tuesday, when the
decorating is finished, Dickey will drive home to Carlsbad. There he
will watch the parade on TV.</TE>
<TE>   "I see enough of the floats," he said, "through the glue."</TE>

<HD>Hundreds Join Hunt for Missing Woman</HD>
<DH>Modesto-area residents rally after pregnant Laci Peterson,
27, disappeared on Christmas Eve.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Arax</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MODESTO</DL>
<LD>Laci Peterson's life was just where she wanted it to be.</LD>
<LD>   She had grown up on a dairy farm outside town and went away to
college on the Central Coast. When it came time to plant roots and
have children, Peterson came back to this community with her new
husband Scott.</LD>
<LD>   They were expecting their first child, a boy, in a few weeks. It
was Christmas Eve and the invitations to the baby shower were in the
mail. Scott was away on a daylong fishing trip. The 27-year-old
stayed home to prepare for Christmas brunch. She loved to entertain
and already had begun setting and decorating the table.</LD>
<TE>   That's when she took the golden retriever out for a walk.</TE>
<TE>   She hasn't been seen since.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson's disappearance rallied this agricultural community into
action. Her cousin, Kathleen Farley, said so many new people were
volunteering each day to search and hand out fliers that she "hadn't
seen the same face twice."</TE>
<TE>   She said she knew why the disappearance had struck such a chord.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it has to do with her being pregnant and the idea of
someone being taken from their home and family on Christmas Eve,"
Farley said.</TE>
<TE>   By Sunday, 10,000 fliers had been distributed and 15,000 more were
being printed. Grim-faced dairy farmers were among hundreds of
volunteers combing the area on foot and horseback.</TE>
<TE>   A makeshift command center at a motel was inundated with those
seeking to help, any way they could. Cheryl Bell and Lisa Cano drove
in from outlying towns and carried out armloads of fliers to
distribute at area stores.</TE>
<TE>   "She was pregnant, she was our age, and we feel like we can relate
to her," Cano said, pushing her toddler in a stroller. "We were free
and able to do something."</TE>
<TE>   It is not an unexpected response from this tightly knit region.
Suburbia may be gobbling at its fringes and housing tracts swallowing
farmland, but even as Modesto has grown, it has responded to
Peterson's disappearance with a rural heart.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as this town has grown, it hasn't lost its concern for
other people," said Modesto police chaplain Don Crooker. "The feeling
of community, that family feeling, is still very strong here."</TE>
<TE>   Crooker said that what Modesto could not do for Chandra Levy, a
Modesto woman who disappeared far from home while an intern in
Washington, D.C., it was doing for Peterson.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson is described by family and friends as vivacious, fearless
and feisty. The former high school cheerleader attended Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo, where she received an award as outstanding freshman in
her major, ornamental horticulture.</TE>
<TE>   At college she met Scott Peterson, who grew up in the San Diego
area. After graduation, the couple opened a restaurant, The Shack, a
hangout for college students. They closed it after deciding to move
here two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In Modesto, the Petersons settled in an upscale neighborhood near
La Loma Park, where Laci Peterson was last seen walking her dog about
10 a.m. on Christmas Eve. Scott Peterson told police he had been
fishing from a Bay Area marina and returned home in the late
afternoon to find her missing.</TE>
<TE>   Police did not name Peterson as a suspect, but said they were
working to corroborate his story. So far, police said, they were
unable to find anyone who saw Peterson at the marina the day his wife
disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they had identified 175 high-risk parolees and sex
offenders in the area and had begun questioning them.</TE>
<TE>   "Five days have passed, and the longer it goes, the harder it
becomes," police spokesman Doug Ridenour said. "It's not been easy,
but we are going to continue."</TE>
<TE>   Ridenour said authorities have received 340 tips and were
investigating the promising ones.</TE>
<TE>   The reward for information leading to Peterson rose to $500,000
Sunday, as the young woman's family made an emotional plea for her
safe return.</TE>
<TE>   "I love you very much. We want you home," said Peterson's father,
Dennis Rocha.</TE>
<TE>   A small, powerfully built man wearing steer roping boots and
pressed jeans, Rocha said his dark-haired daughter was his "spitting
image," favoring his Portuguese ancestry.</TE>
<TE>   He recalled the first seven years of his daughter's life on the
350-acre dairy, and caring for 600 Holsteins.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the support for Peterson comes from the farming community
of Escalon, where the Rocha family raised milk cows for 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tearing our family apart," Rocha said. "Christmas Eve, of
all times, to pull something like this. We've got to get her back."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Rocha, who divorced her husband more than 20 years ago,
said that although more than five days had passed since her daughter
has been seen, she needed to believe in the best of outcomes.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to find Laci and she's going to be fine," she said.
"And then we are going to finally have Christmas."</TE>

<HD>Part of Powerball Windfall to Benefit Tiny Torrance Church</HD>
<DH>A West Virginia man is sending some of the $314.9-million
jackpot to former pastor to honor tenet of his faith.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Hymon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the first people Andrew "Jack" Whittaker called after winning
the record $314.9-million Powerball lottery last week was a pastor in
Torrance.</LD>
<LD>   "Jack didn't tell me exactly what he would do with the money. All
he told me was that he had won and to pray for him," Pastor Gerald
Abreu recalled Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   But now, a $334,000 check is in the mail to Abreu, and Whittaker
said at least $3 million more will soon be on the way.</LD>
<TE>   Whittaker, who decided to take his Powerball winnings in one lump
sum and will receive $111.7 million after taxes from the lottery,
said it's part of his pledge to tithe 10% of his winnings to the
church. He plans to divide about $11.3 million among three pastors,
including Abreu.</TE>
<TE>   Abreu, who is now pastor of Abundant Life Church of God, was the
minister of a church Whitaker attended in Hurricane, W.Va., for 10
years before moving to Torrance in September.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Abreu and his small flock of about 50 were still
grappling with what the money might mean for their lives and church,
a small stucco and brick two-story building in a working-class
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "It will certainly expand the opportunities we have to help people
here," said Abreu, 43. "One of the things our church does is we have
a small food bank to help a few families here in Torrance. This money
will allow us to keep doing that and maybe expand it."</TE>
<TE>   Abreu met Whittaker when he was the pastor of the Tabernacle of
Praise church in Hurricane. Whittaker, now 55, was ill with
pancreatitis for much of the time, and Abreu spent many days and
nights at the hospital with his parishioner.</TE>
<TE>   "He was here for 10 years, and I probably had 16 major
operations," Whittaker said in a telephone interview. "Abreu was at
the hospital the whole time, and he looked after my family when I was
sick."</TE>
<TE>   Two other pastors in West Virginia who were ministers of churches
Whittaker attended will get the same amount as Abreu.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm Christian, and a Christian is supposed to tithe 10% of what
they get," Whittaker said from his home in Scott Depot, W.Va. "I've
been doing that my whole life. The Abreus have three children,
they've had hard times their whole life and preaching isn't the
highest paying job in the whole world.</TE>
<TE>   "I want them to get the maximum that I can give them. I've got two
tax lawyers and three CPAs working on it right now."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time that Whittaker was suffering from his illness,
Abreu and his wife, Karla, had their own misfortune. In 1996, their
5-day-old son died of a rare heart ailment. Whittaker paid for the
burial.</TE>
<TE>   The Abreus have experienced other tragedies. As a 12-year-old,
Gerald Abreu lost his father, brother and sister when the car they
were in was struck by a drunk driver. Karla Abreu's mother, father
and two sisters also were killed by a drunk motorist when she was 10.</TE>
<TE>   The Abreus have three children, ages 2, 12 and 17, but money has
always seemed to be in short supply. That wasn't the case for
Whittaker, who owns three construction-related firms in West Virginia
and describes himself as a "self-made millionaire."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Whittaker has played the lotto for years, but only
when the jackpot climbed over $100 million. "I figured if I happened
to win, there would be plenty to do with the money," he said. He
usually bought 100 tickets, but the most he had ever won was $24.
Then came Thursday morning, when he learned that his luck had
changed.</TE>
<TE>   If possible, Whittaker is trying to give the money directly to the
three pastors and to a specific church. For one thing, he hopes the
Abreus can buy their own home. They now live in a church-owned home
in Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   But Whittaker also said the money is coming with a stipulation
attached: The pastors must use the bulk of the funds to help people.</TE>
<TE>   The Abreus are reluctant to say how they might spend money they
don't yet have. But when pressed they said they could see sprucing up
the congregation's church building and perhaps supplementing the
small salary that Gerald draws from the parish.</TE>
<TE>   At the tidy but no-frills church, about 20 people attended evening
services Sunday, where Abreu's sermon was devoted to the theme that a
person's worth is determined by their faith.</TE>
<TE>   On a bulletin board near the building's entrance was a small sign
built to resemble a thermometer to show the progress of a youth
ministry fund-raising drive. As of Sunday night, $100 of the $800
goal had been raised.</TE>
<TE>   "All this is so strange that I have to think God has his hands in
all of this," said Karla Abreu before the evening's services. "I
can't help but believe that of all the people who play the lottery,
this isn't a fluke. Not at all."</TE>

<KH>Orange Peeled / A LOOK AT LIFE INSIDE THE COUNTY</KH>
<HD>For Now, It's the Ultimate Surf Museum</HD>
<DH>Huntington Beach's tribute to its favorite sport is small,
cozy and volunteer-run. But its operators have big plans for its
future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From outside, the Huntington Beach International Surfing Museum looks
more like a doctor's office, its Art Deco facade lost amid downtown
redevelopment and fresh stucco.</LD>
<LD>   But inside, it's got a going-back-in-time feel. Visitors are
greeted with old movie posters and photographs from the 1960s of
Southern California surf stars such as David Nuuhiwa, Corky Carroll
and Huntington's own Robert August, who starred in Bruce Brown's
cherished documentary "The Endless Summer."</LD>
<LD>   The museum also houses everything imaginable that has ever gotten
wet: old single-fin longboards, antique dive suits, even a pair of
neon-colored Jams.</LD>
<TE>   It's a quick walk from the pier to the museum at 411 Olive Ave., a
pilgrimage made by thousands each year, thanks in part to its popular
Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect to find gleaming marble floors, white walls or artsy
indirect lighting. Think small. Think cozy. With only 2,200 square
feet, the museum is roughly the size of one room at a metropolitan
museum.</TE>
<TE>   Since its opening in 1987, the museum has operated on a
shoestring, largely relying on donations of cash and artifacts. The
museum has no paid staff. Volunteers include members of the board of
directors, headed by Robert Frederickson, a 51-year-old project
manager for an Orange County engineering group who rides a longboard
and as a teenager grooved to the surf tunes of Jan &amp; Dean.</TE>
<TE>   "I was born and raised in San Francisco and have been a lifelong
musician," Frederickson said. "I grew up on music like 'Wipe Out' and
surf stuff, so after I moved to Orange County, I put a band together,
and to help out the museum we started its Surfin' Sunday series where
bands play in the museum parking lot in the summer."</TE>
<TE>   Frederickson's goal is to encourage greater participation among
nonsurfers and to show through the museum how the sport's image has
matured from its rowdy days to its status as a hip lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just a bunch of grommets running 'round downtown," he
said. "Go to San Onofre beach on a Sunday and you will see three
generations of surfers in the water. If you dawn-patrol, you might
see a beat-up VW van there. But look at the other automobiles.
Chances are you'll find a big Suburban or Volvo station wagon."</TE>
<TE>   A $5-Million Goal</TE>
<TE>   The board's new push is to create a foundation that will raise at
least $5 million to move the collection into Pacific City, a 31-acre
proposed development that is to include condominiums, a hotel and a
shopping plaza. The area lies between 1st Street and the Hyatt
Regency.</TE>
<TE>   "Pacific City is the last big chunk of land around in the city,"
said Natalie Kotsch, a real estate broker who founded the surf museum
to help market the city and downtown retailers. "We still have to
negotiate for the property. But even if we fail, that's OK. Our goal
is to eventually build the ultimate surfing museum."</TE>
<TE>   Finding a permanent home has been a battle. Kotsch once housed old
surf magazines, surfboards and other items at her downtown real
estate office after she and surfer George Farqahar, whose family
owned the Huntington Beach News, agreed that somebody should be
saving the city's cultural ties to surfing.</TE>
<TE>   The museum was housed on Walnut Avenue before settling at its
present site on Olive, where it leases a building owned by the city.</TE>
<TE>   One of the keys to the museum is that it pays homage to Hawaiian
Duke Kahanamoku, who died in 1968 at 77. Regarded as the "father of
surfing," he rode the waves around the city pier during the 1920s.
Exhibits highlight Kahanamoku's life achievements and include a
recently issued U.S. postage stamp.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Beasley, the museum's head docent, is quick to offer visitors
a tour and a story or two about Kahanamoku. She still recalls a 1994
phone call to Kahanamoku's widow, Nadine, during which Nadine told
her that what she wanted most was for Duke to be recognized with a
stamp.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to think that our museum helped out a lot getting that
stamp for the Duke," Beasley said, adding that dozens of groups,
elected officials and individuals across the country helped the
effort.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Beasley nor Kotsch surfs. They never have. Kotsch is from
Canada and Beasley is from West Virginia. But don't hold that against
them, Frederickson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't it ironic that it took nonsurfers to start the museum?"
Frederickson said. "But when you talk to both Natalie and Ann, they
exude passion for the sport that overwhelms someone who doesn't surf.
It's a testament to what the aloha spirit really is."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, several people from the San Fernando Valley paid a visit
to the museum and watched a surf video.</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking for something to do and we wanted to go to a
museum " said Maria Ryff, 23, of Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   A novice surfer, Ryff said she found a portion of the museum that
highlighted female surfers inspiring.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Alex, 28, of Irvine, who accompanied Ryff, summed up the
museum: "It's cool."</TE>

<HD>Aerobatics Pilot Is Not Winging It</HD>
<DH>Precision and practice is everything for Santa Paula's
Vicki Cruse, who experts say will be a top national competitor in the
sport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gail Davis</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Get the terminology right, says pilot Vicki Cruse of Santa Paula:
Trapeze artists perform acrobatics. Pilots perform aerobatics.</LD>
<LD>   Still, to onlookers, the crisp figures that the 34-year-old Cruse
snips out of the sky with her nimble Edge 540 single-prop plane
resemble a high-wire act.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike trapeze artists, however, Cruse has no net. When she
competes next year as the newest member of the United States
Unlimited Aerobatic Team, it will just be Cruse, her blue-and-yellow
Edge and a few thousand feet of empty air.</LD>
<TE>   If something goes wrong, "You can't fix it," she said recently in
her hangar at Santa Paula Airport. But she doesn't mess with her own
mind by thinking about that.</TE>
<TE>   "You just try to be as safe as you can," she said. "You don't act
stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Precision is her safety net. And Cruse is, if anything, precise.
In a polo shirt and neat jeans, the petite Cruse conjures up an image
of a Marine in mufti as she gives a tour of her immaculate hangar.</TE>
<TE>   Her two planes -- the second is a commuter plane she flies to her
business at Santa Monica Airport -- are parked with their noses to
the sun. Tools are stored, awards hang on a wall. There's not a drop
of oil anywhere. A welcome mat printed with happy dachshunds lies,
swept and spotless, on the cement floor.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always liked dachshunds, but I'm never home" to take care of
one, Cruse explained. "Even plants are a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, she's got her planes and her knack for precision, both of
which she's been putting to use, dipping and diving above Santa
Paula's orange groves. She's preparing for her first World Aerobatic
Championship next June in Lakeland, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The competitions are held every two years, with about 20 countries
participating. The U.S. team is composed of five men and five women.</TE>
<TE>   A first place would be great, but with only four years of
aerobatic flying under her belt, that may be a few years off, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Stephen Cunningham, just-retired president of the nonprofit
United States Aerobatic Foundation, which oversees Cruse's team, said
Cruse has learned the skills necessary for aerobatic flying much
faster than most pilots. She will probably start getting major
trophies sooner than she thinks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If she stays with her training routine, she can be in the top
five in the world," Cunningham said. "She's that good."</TE>
<TE>   There are about 500 aerobatic pilots who compete in the U.S. and
about 2,000 worldwide, said Geri Silveira of the Aerobatic
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The flying in aerobatic competitions is a far cry from the
low-level flash and dazzle of air-show stunts, Cruse said. Instead,
competitors perform so high they look from the ground like map tacks,
as they take turns executing sharp maneuvers with names like Laydown
Eight, Snap Rollover and Tail Slide.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots perform with the help of metal grids bolted to each wing
tip as sighting aids and diagrams attached to their control panels
with Velcro. That's after they have literally walked through their
routines beforehand, with arms spread like wings, to memorize the
patterns.</TE>
<TE>   Judges award points based on the precision of each maneuver. To
spectators, it has all the drama of a geometry class. But oh, Cruse
said, to be in the cockpit. Her single-seater, made of lightweight
but strong carbon fiber, has a 330-horsepower engine, can fly up to
250 mph and can roll at a rate of 420 degrees per second.</TE>
<TE>   It can also withstand pressure up to 23 times the force of
gravity, although the most Cruse experiences is about 9 Gs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rocket," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She fell in love with planes as a child in Springfield, Mo. Her
engineer father took the family on fishing trips each summer, and
while Cruse loved fishing, she loved the plane rides to get there
even more.</TE>
<TE>   While in college in Florida, a fellow student who owned a plane
encouraged Cruse to get her pilot's license.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating with a degree in marine biology, she worked as an
environmental consultant and pursued flying as a hobby.</TE>
<TE>   She met her boyfriend, Dave Ronneberg, at an air show, and Cruse
has owned Berkut Engineering, a kit aircraft company based at Santa
Monica Airport, for 10 years now. Ronneberg designed the kit planes,
which sell for $44,000.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by watching air-show aerobatics, Cruse bought her first
aerobatic plane in 1995 and came to Santa Paula Airport, long a
center for aerobatic training, to learn to fly it. She flew her first
contest in 1997 and was soon placing high at national competitions.</TE>
<TE>   One advantage, she said, is her size, or lack of it. At 5 feet 2
and 105 pounds, she can't reach the pedals in either of her planes,
so she uses pedal extensions and a booster seat to see over the
dashboard. But that means she adds little weight to her already-light
plane, in a sport in which lightness counts.</TE>
<TE>   Aerobatic flying is not an inexpensive pursuit. Her
top-of-the-line planes cost about $225,000. Expenses for competitions
run $20,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   She and Ronneberg, 51, are in the process of selling their
company. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, airplane sales have
been down nationwide, Cruse said.</TE>
<TE>   But for the moment, Cruse keeps busy in Santa Paula, practicing
for the championship next June, dipping over the orange groves,
turning sharply, and then roaring off into the sun.</TE>

<HD>Hybrid Autos to Get Their Own Show Outside</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the big L.A. Auto Show inside the Convention Center on Friday
morning, it'll be fossil-fuel heaven (with probably a few
experimental-fuel vehicles).</LD>
<LD>   Outside, it'll be about clean and green machines, as the Union of
Concerned Scientists enlists pols and celebs to put faces behind the
steering wheels when it releases its report on the benefits of hybrid
cars and trucks (how does 60 miles per gallon sound?).</LD>
<LD>   Elected hybrid car owners Eric Garcetti (the L.A. City Council
member has two of them), Assemblywoman Gloria Negrete McLeod (a Chino
Democrat), and Santa Monica's Councilman Kevin McKeown will be
matching rpms with famous-faced hybrid car-owner actors Ed Begley Jr.
(who made a cross-country, round-trip drive in his hybrid for $150 in
fuel), Mimi Kennedy, Nancy Allen and Steven Collins.</LD>
<TE>   Just-plain-folk hybrid owners from El Cajon and Pomona to Simi
Valley will also be driving in to show off their wheels to one
another and to the public. Look for the helium balloons and banners
-- but please, no wheelies in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Sick of Prison and</TE>
<TE>   Health-Care Politics</TE>
<TE>   Now, see? This is the kind of thing that makes people mock
California in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   A 15-year-old gang member suspected of murder, shackled at the
ankles and escorted by probation officers, escaped last week -- on a
trip to an orthodontist.</TE>
<TE>   A week earlier, a man serving time in prison for robbery died
after his body rejected the new heart he got in a nearly
million-dollar transplant and post-op procedure about a year ago. A
public clamor questioned whether a convict should be at the top of
the list, and whether the state should foot the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Now that California's black-hole budget deficit threatens to suck
away nearly $35 billion, there's talk of saving money by releasing
some elderly and nonviolent prisoners -- freeing them from prisons
where medical care is provided into a state where money for medical
care for the poor and unemployed, like some people out of prison,
could be chopped back even further.</TE>
<TE>   Predictable Recoil</TE>
<TE>   to Stolen-Gun Study</TE>
<TE>   Across the nation, nearly 1.7 million guns have been stolen over
the last 10 years. Many of them -- a reported 153,140 -- were stolen
in California, the state that also manufactures the most guns.</TE>
<TE>   But in spite of those big raw numbers -- the numbers are always
big when you're dealing with the nation's most populous state --
California ranks only 29th in guns stolen per resident, according to
the Americans for Gun Safety foundation. The highest is Alaska, with
42.7 thefts per thousand homes (the moose militia, maybe?).</TE>
<TE>   The study is titled, "Stolen Firearms: Arming the Enemy," and the
foundation's policy and research director, Jim Kessler, cited a 1997
Justice Department study that nearly 10% of prison inmates used
stolen guns in the crimes that put them in stir.</TE>
<TE>   "A stolen gun is like gold to a criminal," said Kessler, "because
it can be quickly resold without fear of it being traced to them. If
you love your gun, you should lock it up."</TE>
<TE>   It's a law of political physics that, for every gun study, there
is an equal and opposite spin. The study says those state-rate
differences go to varying state laws requiring owners to keep their
guns locked up. But at least one gun-owner organization says pshaw --
the report is just gun-control tactics masquerading as information.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Doug Ose, a Sacramento Republican congressman, has formed an
exploratory committee -- the formal name for "please send me money"
-- to consider running against Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer in 2004.
Ose could afford to be his own first donor, having made multiple
millions as a Sacramento developer before being elected in 1998. He's
likely to be the first of several Republicans to try to take on
Boxer.</TE>
<TE>   * Two Californians have been named to influential federal advisory
panels. Dr. Linda C. Giudice, chief of reproductive endocrinology and
infertility at Stanford University Medical Center's gynecology and
obstetrics department, will head the FDA's panel on reproductive
drugs. And the Health and Human Services Department's advisory panel
on genetics, health and society will be chaired by Dr. Edward McCabe,
executive chairman of pediatrics at UCLA and chief physician at
UCLA's Mattel Children's Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   * Maybe it's the proximity to Berkeley, which has a long history
of passing resolutions about international policies. The city of
Oakland has joined a lawsuit claiming that two federal aid agencies'
environmental studies aren't up to snuff when it comes to overseas
energy projects. The federal suit argues that the Export-Import Bank
and the Overseas Private Investment Corp. haven't given adequate
thought to the global warming consequences of carbon dioxide from the
$32 billion in investments in coal-fired power plants, pipelines and
oil fields from Mexico to Asia and Africa.</TE>
<TE>   * A proposed New Year's resolution: that Republicans, who take
turns with their rival party claiming the mantle of the education
party, stop subordinating grammar to politics: the correct adjectival
form for that other party is not "Democrat," it is "Democratic." So
please, make it "the pinko-liberal Democratic Party" or "the
ultra-radical Democratic agenda" -- not ``Democrat.'' The English
teachers of America will thank you.</TE>
<TE>   * Invitations for Planned Parenthood Los Angeles' Jan. 22 dinner
marking the 30th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade
decision legalizing abortion note that 30 years ago, "fat was bad,
and carbs were good," and "rehab was something you did to a house."</TE>
<TE>   * District attorneys from Stanislaus, Merced and Madera counties
have filed environmental complaints against Union Pacific Railroad,
alleging that railroad officials knew hazardous lime was leaking from
moving trains, but violated Fish and Wildlife and water codes by not
alerting the counties the trains passed through. The railroad says
the charges are groundless.</TE>
<TE>   * Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman, who grew up on a Ceres peach
farm, has wrapped up treatments in Washington, D.C, for an early form
of breast cancer and returned to California for the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   * Beverly Ziegler, a regular in L.A. civic politics since she
worked on Sam Yorty's campaigns, has business cards identifying
herself with tongue-in-cheek panache as Beverly Ziegler DPE -- doctor
of political engineering.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "Get me back in the courtroom, out of politics, and I'll be
happy."</TE>
<TE>   Sonoma County D.A. Michael Mullins, who lost his reelection shot
in March, will be back in court in January as a senior prosecutor for
Solano County. During his 30 years with Sonoma County, he oversaw
high-profile cases, including the prosecution of Richard Allen Davis
for kidnapping and murdering Polly Klaas in 1995.</TE>

<HD>Sale of Land Under Fire</HD>
<DH>Giveaway is alleged as South Gate seeks deal with an
associate of Treasurer Albert Robles. City officials insist the price
is fair.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Marosi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Embattled South Gate Treasurer Albert Robles is at the center of
another controversy, as city officials plan to sell an 11-acre site
to his former business partner for a price that critics and real
estate experts say is far below its market value.</LD>
<LD>   Officials want to sell the mostly vacant, industrial-zoned land
for $425,000. Several real estate experts say the property, which
fronts the Long Beach Freeway, could be worth anywhere from $2
million to $5 million.</LD>
<LD>   Compounding the controversy are recent revelations that a building
on the site is apparently being used by a telemarketing company to
work on a city-funded campaign against the police officers union, one
of Robles' political foes.</LD>
<TE>   The latest developments have prompted complaints of cronyism and
misuse of public funds as the city prepares to hold a recall election
next month targeting Robles and his three allies on the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   City officials contend that the land deal is no giveaway. The
sloping expanse of property, a former landfill and shooting range, is
rife with environmental problems, said Oliver Mujica, the city
director of economic development.</TE>
<TE>   "There is very little you can do without spending an exorbitant
amount of money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have already approved use of a portion of the site as an
impound lot for a towing company owned by the father-in-law of
Lynwood Mayor Fernando Pedroza.</TE>
<TE>   Critics contend that action runs counter to the city's own
argument that the land is of little use. They say the deal
shortchanges taxpayers in one of the county's poorest cities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fire sale at City Hall," said Councilman Hector De La
Torre, a Robles critic. The land deal "is a gift that keeps on
giving," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The three-member majority on the City Council that is allied with
Robles has already expressed support for the deal. It is scheduled to
be discussed at a council meeting Jan. 6.</TE>
<TE>   The 37-year-old Robles is considered the most powerful political
force in the city. He recently faced charges of threatening to kill
state legislators. The trial ended when a jury deadlocked.
Prosecutors have not said whether they will retry him.</TE>
<TE>   Robles was not available for comment, but in the past has said
that he no longer has financial ties with George Garrido, the
businessman who has offered to buy the land.</TE>
<TE>   Garrido, a nursery owner who was Robles' partner in a trucking
company, was not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The site, with extended freeway frontage, sits near the confluence
of the Los Angeles River and the Rio Hondo Channel in the
southeastern part of the city. About half the acreage was a dump
until the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining land was used mainly as a shooting range until
earlier this year, when the council agreed to lease it to Garrido.</TE>
<TE>   Critics and real estate agents say the $15,000 Garrido is paying
annually under the 35-year lease is far below market value. And by
leasing the land for such a long time, the city made it unattractive
for anyone other than Garrido to buy the property. The site could
have been leased for as much as 10 times more, the real estate agents
said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said the low rent was necessary as an incentive for
Garrido to move his nursery from another site slated for a housing
development. Officials said if he wasn't accommodated, the city would
have had to pay damages.</TE>
<TE>   A few months after the lease agreement was approved, Mujica said
Garrido told the city he wanted to buy the land.</TE>
<TE>   Officials ran a sale notice for two weeks in a local newspaper.
The only other offer, at a lower price, came from the former owners
of the shooting range.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said the property was not marketed seriously.
Municipalities normally seek real estate agents' help in selling
large industrial sites, they said, and it can take months to get the
word out and structure a good deal.</TE>
<TE>   "They got no exposure. They hid the property," said Leo Vusich of
Lee &amp; Associates, an industrial real estate broker in the City of
Commerce with more than 30 years of experience.</TE>
<TE>   City officials disagree, saying the market exposure was
sufficient, and that the price is fair.</TE>
<TE>   That price, they said, was based on an appraisal from Duncan
Appraisal Corp., which is a Garden Grove-based company.</TE>
<TE>   The appraiser, Donald Duncan, wrote that the site's value is
limited because it is criss-crossed by several easements, including
overhead high-tension wires and railroad tracks.</TE>
<TE>   The appraisal's value of $425,000 is one-tenth the price, on a
square-foot basis, of nearby sites, which Duncan said are better
situated.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of problems on the site. I don't know what you
could put on it," Duncan said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   The appraisal was criticized by several real estate experts who
reviewed it at The Times' request. They acknowledged that the site's
value is impacted by the landfill and the uncertainties surrounding
the cleanup costs.</TE>
<TE>   But the appraisal was incomplete, they said, because it failed to
give any value to potential uses as a storage yard for trucks and
trailers.</TE>
<TE>   A buyer "can use the [property] for parking or a parking-related
concession," said Larry Kosmont of Kosmont and Associates, a real
estate consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks before the proposed sale, city workers have been
making several taxpayer-funded improvements. Some of them, like
closing the landfill and installing monitoring wells, were required
by the Regional Water Quality Control Board.</TE>
<TE>   City workers have also fenced the site and installed a heavy metal
gate. City Atty. Salvador Alva said those improvements were necessary
to reduce the city's risk of liability in case of trespassers.</TE>
<TE>   But critics question why such changes are being made now. And they
question the legality of the telemarketing operation.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the council approved a $98,000 contract to
hire a telemarketing company to question residents about donations to
the police union. De La Torre, one of two council critics of Robles,
said the council was acting on Robles' recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   The union, say city officials, is not a qualified nonprofit
organization because its corporate powers were suspended by the state
in 1983 and it therefore cannot function as a charity.</TE>
<TE>   Phone operators have been canvassing residents for weeks, telling
them that donations to the union might not be tax deductible because
of the union's status, according to residents who have received the
calls. Donors may be entitled to a refund and damages from the
association, according to a letter written to residents from Alva,
the city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The city has not disclosed where the callers for the telemarketing
company are working, but sources say the building on the land being
leased by Garrido was remodeled earlier this month and equipped with
a 24- to 36-line phone bank.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to interview telemarketing officials at the site were
unsuccessful. A guard prevented access to the building, which is
fenced off and guarded by dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "They are just trying to smear the credibility of the union," said
Frank "Pico" Rivera, a policeman working to recall Robles and his
three council allies. "They know we have the public's support." The
union has teamed with community groups in the recall effort against
Robles.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials say they ran afoul of state regulations by
allowing the union's state registration to lapse, but insist that it
is a qualified nonprofit with a federal tax identification number.</TE>

<HD>New West Symphony Upbeat</HD>
<DH>As classical orchestras around the country struggle, the
Ventura County group boasts a possible budget surplus and growing
interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josef Woodard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many orchestras have been singing the blues lately.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this month, the San Jose Symphony announced its
bankruptcy, and even highly respected American orchestras such as
those in Chicago and Cleveland have felt the sting of
multimillion-dollar deficits.</LD>
<LD>   But Ventura County's New West Symphony is holding its own against
the tide, officials say, even sailing into its eighth season with the
possibility of a surplus.</LD>
<TE>   The challenge now is less about paying the piper than about
picking the tune.</TE>
<TE>   From his home near Toronto, founding music director Boris Brott
called the orchestra's relative health "an interesting dilemma."</TE>
<TE>   "What do we do?" he asked, pondering a problem that some less
financially stable groups wouldn't mind having. "Do we increase the
number of main series concerts or do more satellite, boutique
programming? Do we program a series of contemporary concerts or do
pops concerts?"</TE>
<TE>   Whatever direction New West takes, Brott will rely heavily on an
important new player, recently hired executive director Kenneth
Hopper. In charge of the orchestra's business side, Hopper said its
financial position has been aided by some staff downsizing and a
rearrangement of rehearsal time.</TE>
<TE>   "I think for an orchestra that's only 7 1/2 years old, a
close-to-$2 million budget is pretty good," said Hopper, who has held
similar jobs in Westfield, N.J., and Des Moines.</TE>
<TE>   Hopper said the group's audience will only grow.</TE>
<TE>   "More and more people are hearing about us in the San Fernando
Valley and are choosing to come in this direction for their orchestra
concerts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The New West saga has at times been turbulent, starting with its
birth in the merger of the Ventura County and the Conejo Valley
symphonies. Some musicians who played with those groups are still
rankled by competition for New West slots with musicians from outside
the area.</TE>
<TE>   But Brott is quick to point out that one source of New West's
strength is its proximity to Los Angeles, home to some of the finest
classical musicians in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Many of New West's musicians make a living in studios, playing for
films and doing other commercial work. But they relish the
opportunity to play orchestral music.</TE>
<TE>   "The quality of the playing overall has been a great joy for me to
witness and be a part of," said Brott, a former student of Leonard
Bernstein who has served as guest conductor to orchestras around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   "The players continue to improve, as does the quality of the
ensemble, which is kind of amazing because we don't play together all
the time."</TE>
<TE>   Paradoxically, the part-time nature of the orchestra, which will
present six concerts in the 2002-2003 season, helps ensure a higher
caliber of player, Brott said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you start to get permanent, you start to lose the potential
to have the very best people, because those very best people need
their freedom in order to really earn a living," he said.</TE>
<TE>   January's New West agenda leans toward youth.</TE>
<TE>   The annual Discovery Artists Concert program, on Jan. 17 and 18,
will feature young soloists from the area, and the Symphonic
Adventures concerts the week of Jan. 21 in Oxnard will offer a taste
of classical music to thousands of Ventura County schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the season, the symphony will be host to a number of
renowned guest soloists, including pianists Lorin Hollander and Anton
Kuerti and organist Frederick Swann. The season finale includes
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, with the joined forces of the Ventura
County Master Chorale and Los Robles Master Chorale.</TE>

<HD>Better Water Deal Is Sought</HD>
<DH>Imperial Valley seeks revisions as deadline looms to sign
agreement or lose allotment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EL CENTRO</DL>
<LD>If there is a moral in the confrontation between the water barons of
the Imperial Valley and the outside world, it may be the backwoods
truism about swamp drainage.</LD>
<LD>   It says that when you're up to your hipbone in alligators, it's
difficult to remember that your initial goal was merely to drain the
swamp.</LD>
<LD>   That's the dilemma facing the directors of the Imperial Irrigation
District, the nation's largest agricultural irrigation district,
holders of water rights that are the envy of farmers and city
dwellers throughout the Western states. As the district board
prepares to meet tonight in El Centro, it faces a New Year's Eve
deadline to either sign a deal to sell water to San Diego County or
see that water taken by the federal government without compensation.</LD>
<TE>   The details are complex, but the bottom line is simple: Sell it or
lose it.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial directors, in an effort to stave off the threatened
reduction in their water supply, may try to modify the deal to their
liking before the deadline.</TE>
<TE>   But it is unclear whether that will be acceptable to the six other
states that depend on the Colorado River or to the Department of
Interior, which controls annual allocations.</TE>
<TE>   The desire of the Imperial directors to change the terms of the
sale is not surprising. The deal confronting the board is
significantly different than what was envisioned when negotiations
began seven years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, things that the farmers were expressly promised would not
be part of the deal are now major elements in the proposed 75-year
pact with the San Diego County Water Authority.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego, nearly bereft of native ground water, is desperate to
sign a long-term deal with Imperial as a way to liberate itself from
near-total dependence on the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California. Under the deal, Imperial would sell
up to 200,000 acre-feet of water a year to San Diego, enough for 1.6
million people.</TE>
<TE>   The farmers had been promised that the water to be sold would come
through the installation of conservation devices in their fields, not
through letting fields go fallow.</TE>
<TE>   Although economists disagree, it is widely believed in the
Imperial Valley that fallowing will undermine the region's
agricultural economy, leading to increased unemployment, business
bankruptcies, and loss of tax revenue for local governments and
schools.</TE>
<TE>   In the beginning, even the hint of fallowing was a deal-breaker.</TE>
<TE>   But it now calls for immediate fallowing for at least 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Salton Sea was not an issue when negotiations began. Now the
sea is possibly the issue, with Imperial concerned about getting
soaked for hundreds of millions of dollars in restoration projects.</TE>
<TE>   "The Salton Sea has been the proverbial 800-pound gorilla," said
Imperial board member Andy Horne. "Everybody has chosen to ignore it
as long as it was sleeping. Well, the gorilla is standing up and
looking for something to eat."</TE>
<TE>   The deal, when proposed in 1995, was to be strictly voluntary.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Bush administration, in an announcement made Friday, has
warned that unless the deal is struck, it will take away about 7% of
the district's annual allotment from the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   The deal was to involve only the sale of water, not the sale of
the rights to that water. But Friday's announcement would reduce not
just the allotment for 2003 but the district's rights for the future.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time that the federal government has
threatened to reduce Imperial Valley's right to take water from the
river.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, the government tried to restrict use of water from
reclamation districts to farmers of 160 acres or less. The Imperial
Irrigation District fought to the U.S. Supreme Court and won.</TE>
<TE>   In the Imperial Valley, water rights are not just business
conditions, although they undergird a $1-billion-a-year agricultural
industry. They are also considered a birthright.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the farmers involved in the current dispute -- some
willing to sell water, some not -- are the descendants of pioneers
who settled the desolate valley and were taking water from the
Colorado River long before coastal Southern California had formed the
Metropolitan Water District to tap into the river.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those pioneers were refugees from the Owens Valley who
fled when the valley's water was acquired through fair means and foul
by Los Angeles. Fear of losing their water rights runs deep in the
Imperial Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer and poet Rick Mealey has been warning in his verse about
outsiders deciding the water "wasn't ours; And they needed it all
somewhere else; for amusement parks and power," and so the water was
shipped away "and this valley died too soon."</TE>
<TE>   Despite such fears, Dennis Cushman, assistant general manager of
the San Diego County Water Authority, says he remains confident that
a deal can be reached before the deadline. Meetings and calls
continued over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "All the king's men and women, and all the king's horses, are
trying to put this thing back together again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 9, the Imperial board rejected the proposed deal by a vote
of 3 to 2.</TE>
<TE>   One way the deal might be stitched back together would be to craft
a shorter contract and provide some pledges about protecting the
Imperial district from problems involving the Salton Sea. Whether
such changes would withstand scrutiny in Washington and six Western
statehouses is unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Interior Secretary Bennett Raley, who announced the
threatened cuts, said California and the Imperial district have to
accept that this is a new day for Western water issues.</TE>
<TE>   The other six states, Raley said, will no longer permit California
and Imperial to use lavish amounts of water. Also, the 1930s-era
formula that gives Imperial and two smaller agricultural districts
75% of California's share of the river is an anachronism, Raley said.</TE>
<TE>   Refusal to accept those facts, Raley warned, will force the
government to reduce water shipments to the Imperial district and to
the MWD, which serves 17 million people in six counties.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a California choice," he said. "It's time to deal with
reality."</TE>
<TE>   But Raley's reality is not the reality of many farmers. The talk
here this weekend has been of ways to fight what some see as an
illegal "water grab," possibly with a lawsuit defending the valley's
water rights.</TE>
<TE>   "If Bennett Raley thinks he's tough and can threaten the Imperial
Valley, let him try," said John Pierre Menvielle, a third-generation
Imperial farmer. "We'll take him on. We may be backed up against the
wall, but we're not going to give in."</TE>
<TE>   The deadline for signing the San Diego deal was set two years ago
during a convention in Las Vegas of officials from the seven states
that depend on, and fight over, the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for finalizing the Imperial-San Diego deal, coastal
Southern California was to be allowed to continue receiving so-called
surplus water from the Colorado River for 15 years in addition to the
state's assured allocation. Failure to meet the deadline would mean
an immediate suspension of surplus water shipments for California.</TE>
<TE>   The Las Vegas convention that year was a festive one, with lots of
good cheer about California finally finding a way to live within a
water budget by reallocating water from desert farms to thirsty
coastal cities.</TE>
<TE>   One highlight of the gathering was a large painting showing
then-Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt standing amid seven snarling
and snapping creatures, each with the name of a Colorado River state
on its back.</TE>
<TE>   The creatures?</TE>
<TE>   Alligators, of course.</TE>

<HD>Whittier Unveils Plans for 'Grand Boulevard'</HD>
<DH>City has not determined how it will pay for the ambitious
commercial redevelopment project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Errin Haines</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whittier officials are planning the city's most ambitious commercial
redevelopment project since the 1987 earthquake that caused more than
$90 million in damage and devastated local businesses and
neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   City planners say they expect the Whittier Boulevard Master Plan
to transform the jumbled development on Whittier's 7 1/2-mile section
of the thoroughfare into a "grand boulevard" with five distinctly
zoned segments: a gateway, business park, shopping district, auto
mall and residential area.</LD>
<LD>   Residents who attended the City Council meeting Dec. 17 saw dozens
of slides depicting some of what could unfold along the street over
the next 30 years, including a street lined with palm trees, new
shopping centers, townhouses and an office district. The Whittier
portion of the boulevard stretches from the San Gabriel River Freeway
to the Orange County border.</LD>
<TE>   "This is very big. A lot of people have their hopes for Whittier
pinned on the success of this plan," said Charles Claver, 27, a
lifelong resident.</TE>
<TE>   "It's forward-thinking. A lot of people want it right away," said
Arthur Rock, a 30-year resident.</TE>
<TE>   To make the sweeping changes the plan calls for, Whittier would
have to negotiate transfer of ownership for its section of the
boulevard, which is a state highway controlled by the Department of
Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   The city also has to figure out which part of the project it wants
to tackle first. Planners have suggested starting with the area
proposed for shopping, which stretches from Washington Street to
Laurel Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The beautification process, including street repairs and
landscaping, could cost $8 million to $10 million. City officials
said they have not identified funding sources to pay for any of the
planned improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Planning Commissioner Helen Rahder, a former councilwoman, said
the project's goal is a far cry from what is on the boulevard now.</TE>
<TE>   Side by side on one part of the street are a motel, beauty salon,
restaurant, a tailor, an accountant, a pizza shop, furniture dealer
and car repair shop.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, there's no rhyme or reason. Everything was zoned
commercial, and folks just put things wherever they wanted to,"
Rahder said. The result, she said, was a boulevard that didn't match
the rest of the town of tree-lined streets, historic buildings and
scenic hills.</TE>
<TE>   With limited available space and access to only one major freeway
at the edge of town, business in Whittier has struggled to compete
with nearby cities such as Brea, La Habra and Montebello, city
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "The lack of freeway access is a negative, but the thing that
probably hurts us to a greater degree is the lack of available land,"
said City Manager Steve Helvey. "We don't have 10 acres to put in a
Costco or 50 acres to put in a shopping center."</TE>
<TE>   The economy and natural disaster also have hurt the city. Fifteen
years ago, the quake caused substantial damage to about 5,000 homes
and businesses. Hardest hit was the 52-block uptown area. When the
smoke and dust cleared, 34 buildings housing 78 businesses had been
destroyed or had to be demolished.</TE>
<TE>   "Whittier used to be the place to shop, but all of a sudden Brea
Mall, Puente Hills Mall and Montebello Town Center were the places to
go," said Ann Ybarra, the city's director of community development.</TE>
<TE>   The Pico Rivera native said she had always wanted to live in
Whittier, and moved to the city 10 days before the earthquake. "The
towns around Whittier were growing. Whittier got jealous," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The city's approach will be key to the plan's success, said Robert
S. Harris, a fellow of the American Institute of Architects at USC.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of starting with the worst problems, you start
strategically with the places that have the most chance of being
valuable and successful," said Harris, owner of Los Angeles-based
Harris Architecture and Urban Design. "Then you take advantage of
that success by trying to extend it to the adjacent areas."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Freedman, the planner who designed Whittier Boulevard's
proposed new look, warned against being too eager for change, adding
that the vibrant urban design he envisioned for Whittier was at least
10 to 15 years away.</TE>
<TE>   Still, officials are hoping the plan gets rid of what they
consider general stagnation on the street. "The development community
drives through the city," Councilman Allan Zolnekoff said. "They want
to know: Is the city on the way up or on the way down?"</TE>

<LD>Whether you are a seasoned air warrior accustomed to constant
traveling for business or an occasional flier joining the holiday
crowds, if you've been to an airport lately you know how much harder
flying has gotten.</LD>
<LD>   The airlines were already in trouble before the Sept. 11 attacks
and now, with less travel and more delays, bankruptcy is the order of
the day for some major carriers. And the cutbacks in service and
amenities mean longer lines and even more delays.</LD>
<LD>   The only carriers that seem to be doing at all well are the
low-cost, point-to-point carriers like Southwest and JetBlue that
have abandoned the hub-and-spoke model favored by the major airlines.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of routing all trips from smaller cities into a few major
hubs, these carriers hopscotch across the country, dispensing jokes,
peanuts and little else but on-time service and low fares.</TE>
<TE>   Does this signal the end of the hub-and-spoke system that has
allowed major airports like Los Angeles International to become
economic factors in their metropolitan areas? And are people from
smaller cities now doomed to either no air service or an endless
chain of short hops across the country?</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, there can be another model.</TE>
<TE>   Europe has confronted the terrorist threat for years.</TE>
<TE>   There, the traditional airline system is being replaced with an
air-rail hub-and-spoke system, where people use airplanes for longer
flights and transfer inside the airport to high-speed trains to
complete their trips.</TE>
<TE>   With increased congestion on the roads and security delays at the
airports, trains are often the fastest way to travel up to 300 miles.</TE>
<TE>   And if the train serves the airport directly, changing from plane
to train can be as convenient as changing flights.</TE>
<TE>   In the long run, an interconnected air-rail-bus system would
provide higher-quality service to more locations at a lower cost to
the environment and with far greater security than the current
system.</TE>
<TE>   Making the rail connection in Southern California certainly would
be possible, if the Green Line were directly connected to LAX and
with Burbank already on the proposed California high-speed rail
corridor and Ontario envisioned as part of the L.A.-to-Las Vegas
corridor.</TE>
<TE>   Congress can create the framework for a new national
transportation system next year when the funding legislation for air,
rail, highways and mass transit all come due at the same time. What's
needed is a bill that does three things: maps a new, interconnected
system for air, rail and bus; provides money to turn airports into
"travelports," with rail and bus terminals inside the airport; and
funds upgrading of rail tracks to accommodate higher speed levels in
key intercity corridors.</TE>
<TE>   Such an investment in building a national transportation system
for this century is far better than the next most likely action by
Congress: providing the major airlines and Amtrak with yet another
bailout.</TE>
<TE>   Such a move would merely allow the rail and air industries to
continue with the failed business models of the last century.</TE>

<HD>The Administration Can't See the Forest for the Sequoias</HD>
<DH></DH>

Project and is a national director of the Sierra Club. E-mail: chad

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the spring of 2000, then-President Bill Clinton issued a
proclamation establishing the Giant Sequoia National Monument east of
Bakersfield, ensuring that the giant sequoia groves and their
surrounding ecosystems would be forever protected, or so we thought.</LD>
<LD>   This month, the Bush administration announced its draft management
plan for the 329,000-acre monument, which proposes a commercial
logging program that includes patch clear cuts within the sequoia
groves and large-scale removal of big, green trees. Even century-old
giant sequoias would be logged.</LD>
<LD>   That the Bush administration would target such a revered refuge
for logging raises a serious question: If the Giant Sequoia National
Monument isn't safe under this administration, what is?</LD>
<TE>   Though shocking, the move comes as little surprise, given that the
sequoia monument is still managed by the U.S. Forest Service, which,
in turn, is overseen by a former timber industry lobbyist, Bush
appointee Mark Rey.</TE>
<TE>   The plan cavalierly ignores the fact that the monument
proclamation was clearly intended to prevent continued logging and
designed to ensure far greater protection than the area previously
had as a national forest.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Bush administration's proposal turns this goal on its
head.</TE>
<TE>   What's even more disturbing is that the plan claims such logging
of large trees is necessary to prevent severe forest fires.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government's own scientists have consistently found
that removal of large trees increases severe fire risk by removing
the most fire-resistant elements -- big trees -- from the forest and
by reducing the cooling shade of the forest canopy.</TE>
<TE>   The logging of mature trees also increases sun exposure, causing
more rapid growth of highly flammable brush within a few years.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the comprehensive Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Report, which
was produced by university and Forest Service scientists, concluded
that "timber harvest, through its effects on forest structure, local
microclimate and fuel accumulation, has increased fire severity more
than any other recent human activity."</TE>
<TE>   The report recommended thinning of undergrowth and prescribed
burning as appropriate fire management tools. It strongly opposed the
removal of mature trees.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service's own National Fire Plan, which again was
developed by government scientists, warned that the Forest Service
"should not rely on commercial logging or new road building to reduce
fire risks" because the "removal of large, merchantable trees from
forests does not reduce fire risk and may, in fact, increase such
risk."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration doesn't appear to care what the nation's
top scientists -- even the government's own researchers -- are
saying.</TE>
<TE>   For this administration, it's all about pleasing big timber
industry campaign contributors, and logging corporations have no
interest in underbrush.</TE>
<TE>   The timber industry wants economically valuable big trees, and
lots of them.</TE>
<TE>   The Giant Sequoia National Monument was established for the
protection of the sequoia ecosystem and the species it supports,
including the California spotted owl and the mink-like Pacific
fisher.</TE>
<TE>   The fisher is nearly extinct in the Sierra, in large part because
of habitat degradation from logging.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's new logging plan may well drive the remaining fisher
population to extinction in the Sierra Nevada range.</TE>
<TE>   This plan to "save" the Giant Sequoia National Monument by
allowing logging corporations to clear-cut within sequoia groves and
remove big trees is more than a little disingenuous.</TE>
<TE>   It is a shameless political move loaded with enough hypocrisy and
cynicism to flatten a forest.</TE>

<LD>Schoolchildren in the 1950s practiced diving under desks in case the
Soviets launched the Bomb. Today, parents in some school districts
are being asked for permission to administer potassium iodide to
their children in a nuclear emergency. How did the United States,
long after the Cold War ended and Russia's missiles were redirected,
come to such a pass?</LD>
<LD>   The short answer is 9/11. But at least two lessons may be drawn
from the manifest vulnerability demonstrated that day.</LD>
<LD>   One is that we are at war and must fight back. President Bush
communicated this effectively with his "evildoers" rhetoric, his
promise to hunt the terrorists down one by one no matter how long it
takes and by establishing a new government agency for homeland
security.</LD>
<TE>   The other lesson asks "why the hatred?"</TE>
<TE>   Such a question is difficult so close to 9/11 and, in wartime,
invites attacks on one's patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   But asking unpopular questions is the hallmark of real leaders.
John F. Kennedy's "Profiles in Courage" reminds us of some in our
nation's history: Thomas Jefferson splitting with George Washington
over foreign policy, Henry Clay risking defeat by searching for
compromises on slavery, Sam Houston alone among Southern senators
opposing the Kansas-Nebraska concessions to the South, and Abraham
Lincoln, first among equals in the American pantheon.</TE>
<TE>   What are the causes of terrorism and anti-American hatred? Unless
this is asked, and the question is generally absent from contemporary
discussion, how can intelligent, dispassionate and effective
responses be shaped?</TE>
<TE>   If the commission investigating the events leading up to Sept. 11
focuses mainly on intelligence failures and not on policy failures,
it too will be a failure. This is not the place to explore specific
answers.</TE>
<TE>   Historians and policymakers will no doubt disagree over what
responsibility the United States bears for the violence-producing
conditions in the world. Some say we have no responsibility at all;
others that we brought it on ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two, denial is more dangerous because it obscures questions
of responsibility and reinforces the popular domestic view that the
U.S. is a force only for good in the world, the defender of liberty
and democracy, the best country on Earth and probably in history.</TE>
<TE>   These beliefs are the stuff of which war fever, not effective
policy, is made.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. drew the wrong lesson from 9/11. Instead of emphasizing
that the American people, given the half-life of hatred, may never
again be free from attacks unless we stand for peaceful and fair
change, our leaders turned toward war. What if this decision produces
thousands more casualties in the U.S. and more carnage as far into
the future as one can see? How wise will the president's war policy
seem then?</TE>
<TE>   Searching for peaceful answers in the Middle East and elsewhere is
harder than being goaded into war by hopeless fanatics, but history
teaches that it is often the question not asked that leads to
disaster. More than 58,000 names on the Vietnam War Memorial in
Washington attest to the wisdom of pausing before choosing war as a
solution.</TE>

<BD>Crispin Sartwell teaches philosophy at the Maryland
Institute College of Art.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From 1912 to 1913, the military government of Mexico, under
Victoriano Huerta, tried with unrestrained brutality to repress a
rebellion in the southern part of the country. The rebellion, led by
Emiliano Zapata, had wide popular support, so Huerta's forces decided
to attack the populace as a whole.</LD>
<LD>   They burned almost every village in the state of Morelos, engaged
in summary executions of people they regarded as collaborators,
conscripted all other men of fighting age into the army for use
elsewhere as cannon fodder and herded the people who remained into
concentration camps.</LD>
<LD>   These steps led to something very unusual in human history: an
armed uprising of women. Led by a tortilla maker known as La China,
widows, mothers, daughters and wives raided throughout the Tetecala
district.</LD>
<TE>   John Womack, in his biography of Zapata, writes: "Some in rags,
some in plundered finery, wearing silk stockings and dresses,
sandals, straw hats and gun belts, these women became the terrors of
the region."</TE>
<TE>   Now this sounds to me like a movie, and we could surely recruit a
distinguished group of Latinas and quasi-Latinas for the cast; I'm
picturing Sonia Braga, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Salma Hayek and (let's
see) Shakira, burning and looting tonight in plundered finery. We
might take some slight liberty and have La China return after a hard
day at the insurrection, soak in a nice hot bath, kick back with a
mustachioed Antonio Banderas as Zapata and pillow plan an attack on
Mexico City. Indeed, our popular entertainments are now brimming with
armed, rebellious women, starting with "Thelma &amp; Louise."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the truest cultural insurrection was Riot Grrrl punk, a
movement that started in Olympia, Wash., in the early '90s. Such
founding daughters as Kathleen Hannah of the band Bikini Kill
featured fishnets, combat boots and neo-feminist anthems that
reverberate still. They called for "revolution girlstyle now."</TE>
<TE>   On television and movie screen, the Powerpuff Girls -- Blossom,
Bubbles and Buttercup, preschool cuties confected from sugar, spice,
everything nice and Chemical X -- prosecute villains with extreme
prejudice, splattering American living rooms with cartoon gore.</TE>
<TE>   Popular entertainment is, perhaps, a relatively trivial context
for revolution. But you can't sit there and tell me we couldn't use a
genuine revolution of women.</TE>
<TE>   We may debate, for example, whether women feel oppressed under
strict Islamic law. Well, an insurrection of Saudi moms would answer
that question once and for all. Do it for your daughters, to your
husbands.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, in every place in the world where women are dispossessed,
used, denigrated -- in the Sudan or in Hollywood, for example, in
Bosnia or the fashion industry -- an armed insurrection would bring a
look of surprise to men's faces, but perhaps also sudden changes.</TE>
<TE>   In every place where women are being abused, raped, harassed,
stalked, hemmed in, gawked at like zoo animals, bought and sold like
chattel, exploited, degraded, there is a reason for revolution
girlstyle now.</TE>
<TE>   And the world over, as in Morelos in 1913, women and girls are
being widowed or orphaned, men disappearing into graves and gulags.
In the charming old tradition of Victoriano Huerta, homes and schools
are being bulldozed, children are being equipped with Kalashnikovs or
outfitted as explosive devices.</TE>
<TE>   When you get down to it, people have about as much freedom as they
can seize and defend. You're free when you liberate yourself.</TE>
<TE>   As a man, I predict that, more or less, we will continue to act
the way we've been acting until we ... can't.</TE>
<TE>   And so, if you and Shakira take to the hills tonight with
automatic weapons concealed beneath your plundered finery, I will
shake with fear.</TE>
<TE>   But I will understand.</TE>

<LD>In the 1920s, so many budding broadcasters were trying out a growing
technology called radio that stations canceled out one another in a
mess of howls, screams and whistles. Leaders of the infant industry
were forced to implore then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover to
"bring order out of chaos," as one journal put it, "so at least some
of us can be heard."</LD>
<LD>   The relationship between media and government has reversed today.
At the behest of media companies, Congress and the courts have since
1996 struck down many provisions in the 1934 law that cleared the
early 20th century static. Federal Communications Commission Chairman
Michael K. Powell, who has pledged to ease remaining key
restrictions, recently put off a decision until spring -- an
indication of the intensity of debate.</LD>
<TE>   The courts and the FCC have already waived rules barring cable
operators from owning TV stations in their markets and TV networks
from owning Internet companies. It seems capricious to forbid a
company from owning a daily newspaper and a TV or radio property in
one market. Newspaper companies (including The Times' corporate
parent, Tribune Co.) argue that they have had to grapple with losses
generated by the new multimedia economy, such as the flight of
classified advertising to the Internet, so they should also be
allowed such cross-ownership. That does not mean Powell should accept
deregulation at any cost, surrendering the last of the agency's
public-interest provisions.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Clear Channel Communications, a conglomerate that
owns more than 1,000 radio stations, wants the FCC to eliminate the
eight-station cap on radio ownership in a single market. The previous
loosening to eight helped bring U.S. listeners homogenized,
formatted-from-afar commercial radio, the bulk of it aimed at
18-to-34-year-old males. A proposal to allow one company to own two
or more television stations in a single market could have a
homogenizing effect on local TV as well.</TE>
<TE>   Powell should defend grass-roots communications like very
low-power radio stations run by high schools or the local garage
band, and require broadcasters to set aside a modicum of free air
time for political candidates. His encouragement of new technologies
and media expansion can be healthy. But deregulation that doesn't
keep consumers in mind is no public service.</TE>

<LD>America's sprawling intelligence apparatus is a wreck in need of a
complete makeover -- quickly. Unfortunately, CIA chief George J.
Tenet and FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III seem more interested in
defending their turf than in demanding the tough changes needed to
make their agencies capable of fighting terrorists. And, though the
newly established Homeland Security Department will help protect
America's borders and improve medical responses to terrorist attacks,
it wields little authority to coordinate the intelligence work of the
Pentagon, FBI and CIA.</LD>
<LD>   It's no wonder that lawmakers are rushing forward with ideas to
close the intelligence breach. Two high-profile government reports
have even inched open the door to something whose very idea the
nation has long abhorred: a domestic intelligence agency. Now the
administration and Congress need to take a deep breath and scrutinize
just what such a move would accomplish -- and at what cost.</LD>
<TE>   One report comes from a 19-member federal commission headed by
former Virginia Gov. James S. Gilmore III. This fourth annual report
by the commission attempts to deal with the potential threat to civil
liberties by suggesting that information gathering and arrest powers
be kept separate. Concerned that the FBI not become something akin to
the old Soviet KGB -- and worried that it isn't up to the task anyway
-- the report recommends creating a national "counter-terrorism
center" that would coordinate information gathered by various
agencies and report directly to the president.</TE>
<TE>   The other report comes from the Senate Intelligence Committee,
which has recently finished its investigation of Sept. 11
intelligence failures. It calls for creating a director of national
intelligence, a Cabinet-level position. That would curb the power of
the head of the CIA and allow a single person to oversee the welter
of civilian and defense intelligence agencies. Sen. Richard C. Shelby
(R.-Ala.) has appended to the report an 85-page proposal to create a
new domestic intelligence-gathering agency -- a move clearly based on
skepticism that the existing agencies will ever overcome their
aversion to reporting to a director of national intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Both the FBI and CIA stubbornly deny that any fundamental changes
are needed. Mueller insists that the FBI can make the transition from
fighting crime to battling terrorism, while the CIA's Tenet dismisses
as second-guessing suggestions that his agency ignored the looming
terrorist threat. But something is clearly amiss when Tenet, at the
same time, declares that the nation remains pretty much as vulnerable
as ever to terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the Gilmore commission nor the Senate reports go into
enough detail about how to improve the intelligence services or
guarantee that civil liberties are preserved. They do provide a
starting point. The 9/11 commission headed by former New Jersey Gov.
Thomas H. Kean almost surely will build on them to investigate
whether a new agency would really help prevent attacks.</TE>
<TE>   If the 9/11 commission concludes that the nation needs a domestic
spy agency, the president will have to weigh in. He and his attorney
general have yet to meet an incursion into domestic freedoms that
they didn't deem necessary. So it may be up to Congress, which has
been inexcusably remiss in defending civil liberties since Sept. 11,
to make sure the nation does not move an inch in this dangerous
direction without full public debate.</TE>

<LD>Gov. Gray Davis, famously averse to risk, tossed caution aside this
month in choosing termed-out state Sen. Steve Peace as his finance
director. Speaking of risk, it is now Peace's thankless job to find a
path out of the state's $35-billion budget deficit, a fiscal hole
that dwarfs anything any state has experienced.</LD>
<LD>   The mercurial Peace, a 49-year-old veteran of two decades in the
Assembly and Senate, was most recently the workaholic chairman of the
Senate Budget Committee. He built a reputation as one of the
Legislature's most creative thinkers, able to master complex issues
and not afraid to let mere mortals know of his mastery. He is known
for his short temper, sarcastic wit and inability to suffer fools
gladly -- not necessarily assets in forging legislative compromises.</LD>
<LD>   Peace is remembered outside Sacramento, however, for the one thing
he can't live down. He was an engineer of the electric power
deregulation scheme that led the state to rolling blackouts and
billions of dollars in crisis purchases of overpriced power.</LD>
<TE>   Peace got something of a bum rap on power. The flaw was more in
the implementation of the program than in the concept. And the
Legislature's plan was better than the original, developed by the
state Public Utilities Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The power debacle still haunts him, but in fact Peace may be the
right state finance director for the times. For all his legislative
activism, he is a fiscal conservative amenable to sharp budget cuts
in areas including the state prisons, a fact that may help him
negotiate with Republicans. Also, Peace has long promoted basic
fiscal and bureaucratic reforms to control the wide revenue swings
that, along with overeager spending, made this mess.</TE>
<TE>   Peace has advocated stabilizing the tax base and stimulating the
state's manufacturing economy. He has said he favors a modest change
in Proposition 13, the 1978 property-tax-limiting initiative, to
allow adjustment of business property taxes to reflect market values.
Those would usually be fighting words for the GOP, but if modifying
Proposition 13 could eliminate the need for sharp increases in more
volatile revenue sources, such as the top income tax rate, who knows
what might start to look acceptable?</TE>
<TE>   One of Peace's strengths is the ability to advocate change as a
matter of good public policy, not just to satisfy a political agenda.
To get from idea to legislative passage, though, he'll have to learn
to cajole rather than berate his former colleagues, even his favorite
"fools."</TE>

<LD>Re " 'No Third Way' for U.S. Iraqis," Dec 26: Of course there is a
third way -- by advocating that we stop the war drive, end the
sanctions immediately and let the Iraqi people live to get rid of
Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   During the '80s up until the Gulf War, the overwhelming support by
the U.S. and the West for Hussein made it impossible for any
democratic civic institutions to prosper. A lot of evidence has
surfaced lately indicating that the U.S. had full knowledge of
Hussein's atrocities back then, but the Reagan and Bush
administrations tried to block attempts by Congress to investigate
and reacted by providing more military and agricultural aid to keep
the regime afloat. The sanctions have replaced U.S. support for
Hussein by strengthening the Iraqi regime.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is almost beyond understanding that the myth is going to
prevail that Hussein is so great an enemy that we must purge the
world of him by going to war. Yet those of us who do not believe the
myth or endorse all the government accommodations to support such a
myth (for instance, obliterating civil rights), and those of us who
write our representatives or join peace marches, are seen as enemies
of the state. Not wanting to be seen as such, we shrink and thereby
become accomplices and supporters of our government's trumped-up
myth. It is the history of war.</TE>

<HD>Medi-Cal Fraud Remains Untreatable</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "State Hit Hard by Medical Fraud," Dec. 26: As a practicing
physician, I am not at all surprised by the estimate of 10% ($2.5
billion) of Medi-Cal fraud in California. In most average
communities, only a relative handful of physicians see Medi-Cal
patients. In order to be successful with Medi-Cal, large numbers of
patients must be seen, with minimal amounts of time spent with each
one. If Medi-Cal treated all physicians properly, most physicians
would take it, and the likelihood of fraud would significantly
decrease. However, for the average physician, Medi-Cal is a hopeless
case because its payments are tiny, it is notorious for delays of six
months or longer and its denial of payment can be for missing a
period or for not putting a number in the center of a box. Nothing
has changed with this $25-billion boondoggle for the last 20 years
despite the election rhetoric every two to four years. It would take
a dictator or a miracle to change the system.</LD>

<LD>Re "The Wrong Message for Black Male Athletes," Dec. 23: NCAA
Division I colleges depend on sports, particularly football, as a
major source of income. Look at what a school receives when it is in
a major bowl game. Coach Jimmy Johnson once told Michael Irvin, when
they were at the University of Miami: If you want an education, go to
Harvard; you are here to play football. It is nearly impossible for a
high school student with a 4.0 grade-point average to get into UCLA,
but the rules are different for a skilled athlete. One way or
another, they will find a way to make him eligible.</LD>
<LD>   End the hypocrisy; pay these guys. They are there for one reason
-- that is, to produce revenue for the university -- no more, no
less.</LD>

<HD>Rosenfield's Goals: No Victory for the Insured</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Insurers Flip the 'Crisis' Switch," Commentary, Dec. 24: Sept.
11, which Harvey Rosenfield dismisses as "[an excuse] for insurance
company profiteering," was in fact the largest insured loss in
history, more than double the Northridge earthquake. It caused $40.2
billion in insured losses -- four times the number cited for stock
market declines that Rosenfield erroneously blames for current
insurance conditions.</LD>
<LD>   The cost to policyholders of the mold crisis is genuine. In Texas,
mold went from a $14-million to a $1-billion problem in only two
years. Self-proclaimed consumer advocates called a $32-million mold
suit a consumer "victory." That judgment was recently reduced to $4
million, but not before it spawned an onslaught of copycat claims
that have added $444 to insurance costs for every Texas policyholder.
Some victory.</LD>
<LD>   As to his favorite target, stock market losses -- property and
casualty insurers' 2002 investments actually gained $26.4 billion in
investment income through September and will likely approach $36
billion for the year. And 66% of these investments are in bonds, only
17% in stocks. Investment income declined from its 1997 peak, but how
would a prudent investment strategy dependent on bonds do anything
else in the face of 12 interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve?</LD>
<TE>   Homeowners nationwide are actually paying about the same for
insurance as they did 10 years ago, despite dramatically increased
home values. Nationally, average insurance costs have increased less
than $50 this year, while the median cost of a home has climbed by
more than $15,000. Does Rosenfield not understand that a more
expensive home costs more to insure? Laughably, Rosenfield shifts the
blame for medical malpractice problems away from lawyers. The success
of the 1974 Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act wasn't mentioned
because the trial bar wants desperately to do away with it --
inevitably causing the same medical availability and affordability
problems experienced elsewhere.</TE>

<LD>Re "The Rise and Stall of LACMA's Planned Reinvention," Dec. 26: At
last some force has come along and killed the truly awful Rem
Koolhaas design for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In this
case it is the worsening economy that has dried up donations for the
planned razing of the existing structures in favor of the pretentious
and totally pedestrian scheme of smug Dutch architect Koolhaas, who
would replace the current mishmash of buildings with something worse,
a giant shoebox with a stretched tent over it that looks like a
throwback to Disneyland's 1970s vision of the future.</LD>
<LD>   The undertone of the article that went unsaid, but I'll say here,
is that the moneyed elite, which is counted upon to deliver about
$200 million of the money, doesn't like Koolhaas' design and hence is
withholding its donations. This is Southern California, and the
architecture of LACMA should reflect the region and its people. The
best examples of architecture in Los Angeles are by Paul Williams,
who fully understood understatement, indoor-outdoor living, setbacks,
beautiful landscaping, water features and refinement. Koolhaas would
give us a sterile tomb for our city's art. The fates have spoken;
LACMA, heed the message and dump the Koolhaas design for good.</LD>

<TE>   You ask, "How does a $400-million project ... go from fast-forward
to pause in 364 days?"</TE>
<TE>   I have better questions: Who had the audacity to suggest that $400
million was ever anything but an obscene amount of money for a museum
to spend to have a nicer place to hang its pictures?</TE>
<TE>   What collection-enhancing pieces could be acquired for a tiny
fraction of that amount? What visitor improvements, what curatorial
and preservation improvements, what education and outreach programs?</TE>
<TE>   And how much good could that much money do in the greater Los
Angeles community, where philanthropy can be purchased $1,000 or $10
at a time? How many worthwhile projects would be swept away because
of the disappearance of $400 million? Tough times and tight wallets?
Nope. Try ego and hubris.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Is Not Ready to End Affirmative Action</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Without a scintilla of evidence, Norah Vincent concludes that blacks
have come so far that affirmative action is no longer needed
("Affirmative Action's Negatives," Commentary, Dec. 26). Affirmative
action programs are intended to promote racial and gender diversity
and to prevent discrimination. I should know. During the Clinton
administration I headed the agency that enforces President Johnson's
executive order on affirmative action.</LD>
<LD>   The cases we saw on a weekly basis were a testament to the
continuing problem of discrimination in the workplace. In one, we
found a worker who had raffled his Ku Klux Klan knife on the
company's shop floor.</LD>
<LD>   African Americans are not the only beneficiaries of affirmative
action. It has also benefited women, Latinos, Asians and other
individuals who have been historically excluded. Witness the
increasing numbers of women in the workplace. The progress that has
been made for all of these groups does not suggest that Johnson's
vision of equal opportunity has been accomplished, however. The
debates surrounding the Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) affair are
indicative of that.</LD>
<TE>   Shirley J. Wilcher</TE>
<TE>   Executive Director</TE>
<TE>   Americans for a Fair Chance</TE>
<TE>   Washington</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there is a flip side to affirmative action: that two wrongs
don't make a right. There is a solution to affirmative action, and
it's called "equal opportunity." When all Americans can enjoy the
same educational opportunities, then the process of college
admissions will not be so mired in controversy.</TE>
<TE>   In the public sector, and in law enforcement in particular, the
"good ol' boy" network routinely promotes less-qualified male whites
over more-qualified minorities, the untold twist of affirmative
action. In corporate America, the most-qualified minorities are
routinely placed in sidetrack jobs that are "ghettoized," devoid of
upward mobility, while a few male whites are groomed for executive
positions. It takes more than slapping a Title VII poster on a
business wall to claim the problem is fixed.</TE>
<TE>   Alexandro Villanueva</TE>
<TE>   Whittier</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The real "monstrous lie" for conservatives is the assertion that
their opposition to affirmative action is not based on racism. If
this were true, you would see these conservatives protesting all
forms of affirmative action: corporate cronyism and nepotism, legacy
admissions to elite colleges, etc. If affirmative action is based on
race, it is unfair and must be struck down in the name of equality.
If (the far more prevalent) affirmative action is based on wealth,
however, it's perfectly acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "Compassionate conservatives" such as Vincent should ask
themselves why that is before they pat themselves on the back and
deem themselves enlightened.</TE>

<HD>Radio Telescope Project Encounters Interference</HD>
<DH>Caltech, UC Berkeley want to erect 23 dishes in the Inyo
Mountains. But Native Americans and conservationists worry about the
impact.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bettina Boxall and Leslie Carlson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>BIG PINE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>There are few places in California where one can slide as easily into
the past as the Inyo Mountains rising at the edge of the Owens
Valley.</LD>
<LD>   History, geography and climate have conspired to keep the modern
age largely at bay. The range is high, empty and dry -- just the
place, astronomers believe, to put a highly sophisticated group of
radio telescopes to probe the dawn of time and the expansion of
space.</LD>
<LD>   Caltech and UC Berkeley are proposing to erect 23 radio dishes in
a high mountain basin to gather clues about the evolution of the
universe and the birth of distant solar systems.</LD>
<TE>   But while the next generation of radio astronomers is counting on
the $15-million project -- known as the Combined Array for Research
in Millimeter-wave Astronomy, or CARMA -- there remain some very
earthly concerns about its location in the largely unspoiled
mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Local Native American tribes complain that the 800-acre telescope
installation will trample land roamed by their ancestors and which
continues to be used as traditional gathering grounds.</TE>
<TE>   And the local conservation chairman of the California Native Plant
Society scolds that, of the two leading proposed sites, one is far
too pristine for what he calls a "giant trailer park for telescopes."</TE>
<TE>   The altitude and aridity that have kept the Inyos off the beaten
track are precisely what attracts Caltech, which has for decades
operated a radio observatory nearby on the floor of the Owens Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Dry as the Owens is, it is even drier high up in the Inyos, which
are in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada and next door to Death
Valley. And the more arid the better for radio astronomy, since water
vapor in the lower atmosphere absorbs and distorts radio signals. As
radio telescopes have evolved and become more sensitive, atmospheric
moisture has become even more of an issue.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the Inyos' wrinkle-inducing dryness, the range is also
within driving distance of the two institutions that would operate
the telescopes and use them as a critical training ground for
graduate students.</TE>
<TE>   "We produce the people and train the people who make the next
generation" of astronomers, said Leo Blitz, director of Berkeley's
radio astronomy laboratory. "They need hands-on experience with the
equipment. That's how you learn."</TE>
<TE>   Nine of the 23 telescopes planned for the Inyos would be moved
down from Berkeley's Hat Creek installation in Northern California,
where Berkeley plans to build a new telescope array. Caltech would
move six telescopes up from its observatory facilities on the Owens
Valley floor about 5 miles from Big Pine.</TE>
<TE>   The other eight radio dishes would be built on site by the
University of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   They would be placed on concrete pads scattered in a radial
pattern across an area about a mile and a quarter in diameter,
totaling 800 acres. The dishes could be hauled on trucks into
different positions to obtain different observations. Two buildings
for monitoring equipment also would be built on the site and manned
around the clock.</TE>
<TE>   By combining the telescopes into one grouping at about 8,000 feet,
astronomers say the resolution of the antennae would be greatly
sharpened and the dishes' collection area would effectively double.
That is because the telescopes would work as one large instrument,
with the smallest dishes -- arranged in the center -- acting as a
zoom lens.</TE>
<TE>   Developed in the late 1930s and '40s, radio telescopes catch radio
signals emitted by cosmic sources. The signals are coordinated by a
supercomputer, which then produces images that laymen may find
unimaginable.</TE>
<TE>   Astronomers should be able to trace the likes of blue dwarf
galaxies, newly born stars, comets and cosmic radiation left over
from the Big Bang by tracking radio wave emissions from molecules and
dust throughout the universe.</TE>
<TE>   "We basically have gone as far as we can go at our [Hat Creek]
site, and the site at Owens Valley is insufficient to do the next
generation of science," said Blitz, an astronomy professor who
described Caltech and Berkeley as pioneers and friendly competitors
in their particular fields of radio astronomy. "So going to a higher
elevation gives us better sensitivity. And combining the arrays gives
us better sensitivity and better imaging."</TE>
<TE>   A similar, somewhat larger installation is planned by an
international alliance for the Southern Hemisphere in Chile, but
until that is completed around 2010, Blitz said the Inyo Mountains
grouping would be the largest of its kind in the world.</TE>
<TE>   But before it is built, the project has various hurdles to clear,
chief among them the approval of the U.S. Forest Service, which has
to grant a special-use permit for use of the Inyo National Forest
land. Inyo administrators are expected to issue a draft environmental
impact statement on the proposal this winter.</TE>
<TE>   The project has already undergone several years of informal
vetting, which has whittled prospective sites from roughly a dozen
down to two. One location, called Cedar Flat, is just off California
Highway 168 in the vicinity of several campgrounds near Westgard
Pass. The other, called Juniper Flat, is to the east of Big Pine in a
remote area now accessible only by a rutted, washed-out dirt track
that would have to upgraded if that site is chosen.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Juniper Flat site has stirred less concern than an
earlier one dropped in the face of strong opposition -- Harkless
Flat, a few miles to the south -- it too has drawn some objections.</TE>
<TE>   "We view Juniper Flat as unacceptable," said Daniel Pritchett,
conservation chairman of the Bristlecone Chapter of the California
Native Plant Society, who described it as a relatively pristine
sagebrush basin ecosystem ringed by ridges of old pinyon pine and
juniper.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it comes down to the public good," Pritchett said. "They
are arguing for a very short-term public good, and we think the value
of Juniper Flat appreciates. Undisturbed areas inherently become more
precious over time.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the Forest Service would consider a trailer park or
a ski development for that area, and this is basically like a giant
trailer park for telescopes."</TE>
<TE>   The Plant Society is not so bothered by the Cedar Flat site, which
is just off the road to the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Beasley, an astronomer at Caltech's Owens Valley observatory
and manager of the Inyo Mountains project, said that, from the
standpoint of astronomical observation, "the two sites are pretty
similar. Each has their pluses and minuses." Juniper Flat is slightly
better, he said, but if Cedar Flat proves more acceptable
environmentally, "that's absolutely no problem."</TE>
<TE>   But Owens Valley Native Americans don't want to see a bunch of
telescopes anywhere in the Inyos, which were used by their forebears
and harbor tribal sacred spots and traditional gathering grounds.</TE>
<TE>   "The Big Pine Paiute tribe of the Owens Valley is very concerned
with the proposed CARMA project because of documented historic,
cultural and contemporary connections at the proposed locations,"
said Jessica Bacoch, tribal chairwoman. "Ultimately, the tribe will
take action to protect these areas for the preservation of our
culture."</TE>
<TE>   An assistant said the tribe is waiting for the release of the
draft environmental statement before deciding its next step.</TE>
<TE>   At tiny Deep Springs College, administrators also worry that
installation of the telescopes at Cedar Flat could impinge on the
college's cherished isolation.</TE>
<TE>   "The college has gone to great lengths to be in a very remote
place and has maintained that for 85 years," said Deep Springs
President Jack Newell.</TE>
<TE>   Noise from the telescopes' generators, light and views of fencing
surrounding the facility could all erode the quiet solitude of the
sprawling campus, where a couple dozen students combine academics and
ranch work in one of the most unusual college programs in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Newell nonetheless said his latest conversations with the
project's backers have left him hopeful they can accommodate Deep
Spring's concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, while it has not appeased everyone, the radio telescope
team says it is trying hard to be a good neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to work with the communities," Blitz said. "This isn't a
logging company. This isn't a ski resort. Community relations are
very important to us. The scientists live there."</TE>

<HD>In O.C., More Gang Deaths, Fewer Funds</HD>
<DH>Even as such homicides nearly double -- to 35 this year --
departments cut back on prevention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County recorded a sharp increase in gang homicides this year,
at a time when some local police departments are scaling back their
gang-suppression programs because of budget cuts.</LD>
<LD>   Gang homicides -- which most police departments define as a
killing that has some link to street gangs -- nearly doubled over the
last year to 35, the most in five years, according to estimates from
the district attorney's office. Santa Ana led the way with 15, up
from 10 in 2001. Anaheim recorded 11 gang killings, up from two a
year ago.</LD>
<LD>   The increases mirror a trend across California this year. Atty.
Gen. Bill Lockyer has singled out gang problems as a chief factor in
the overall rise in homicides in the state. In Los Angeles, about
half of the city's more than 600 homicides this year are blamed by
police on gang activity.</LD>
<TE>   This is occurring at a time when some police departments are
struggling to keep their focus on gang prevention. Officials said
it's impossible to know whether there is a connection between the
cuts in gang programs and the rise in gang killings, which some blame
on the poor economy and gang leaders getting out of prison. But they
believe further budget cuts could hurt their ability to crack down on
gang crimes.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Ana, for example, the Police Department has lost 25 sworn
officers since March 2001 to early-retirement programs. And though
the gang unit is still larger than those in most cities, it is much
thinner than it was during the mid-1990s, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Detective Kevin Ruiz, a corporal who helps supervise Santa Ana's
gang unit, said the increase in homicides doesn't tell the whole
story. He notes that other types of crime involving gangs are down
and that Santa Ana's murder numbers are still a fraction of what they
were in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Ruiz said, he would always welcome more money.</TE>
<TE>   Participation in the countywide anti-gang task force, known as
Target, is also declining. The unit comprises county probation
officers, district attorney investigators and local police officers
who team up to target gang leaders. Recently, at least three police
departments -- Brea, Placentia and La Habra -- pulled officers off
the team to fill holes elsewhere in their agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "When you take these types of task forces down, you lose the
intelligence, the constant pressure on gangs, and crime goes up,"
said Fullerton Police Chief Patrick E. McKinley.</TE>
<TE>   Another gang unit, the district attorney's Regional Gang
Enforcement Team, was shut down this year because federal grant money
ran out. The award-winning task force brought together local, state
and federal investigators to crack down on home-invasion robberies
and other financial crimes committed by roving gangs.</TE>
<TE>   The unit was formed in 1999 and was involved in several
high-profile investigations, including the seizure of $5 million in
counterfeit designer clothing in Westminster and the arrests of
leaders of a West Coast drug ring. Scores of arrests were made for
murders and other felonies.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has cut way back, and the budget picture for next year
is bleak," said Larry Lambert, an investigator with the Orange County
D.A.'s office, who is awaiting reassignment now that the special task
force has been disbanded. "You can only drain the pot so far."</TE>
<TE>   Even agencies that have not cut back are seeing a rise in gang
killings.</TE>
<TE>   In Anaheim, murders nearly doubled to 17. Of those, 11 are
believed to have involved a gang member.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Sgt. Rick Martinez said the size of the Police
Department's gang unit has remained stable, and he has no explanation
for the increase.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't know why. I've been racking my brains over that,"
Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   Some attribute the rise in gang homicides in part to the release
of gang leaders imprisoned during the crackdowns of the 1990s, many
of whom end up back in their old neighborhoods making trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Gang violence in Orange County peaked during the recession of the
early 1990s. Police departments without gang units established them,
and those with existing teams increased their staffs. Armed with
tougher laws, prosecutors sought to put gang members behind bars for
longer periods.</TE>
<TE>   Outreach programs were launched or strengthened by communities
through police departments and social service groups such as the Boys
&amp; Girls Club, with the goal of identifying troubled youths and
providing them a haven from gang neighborhoods and alternatives to
criminal activities.</TE>
<TE>   From 1993 to 2000, the number of gang-related homicides steadily
declined in Orange County to 16 from an all-time high of 74. The
trend began to reverse last year, but only slightly, when the total
rose to 18. Though the numbers are small compared with big cities
such as Los Angeles, they still alarm officials. Some see troubling
parallels to a decade ago, when a spasm of gang violence that started
in Los Angeles eventually spread to Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened in Los Angeles, and it will happen here," said
McKinley, the Fullerton police chief. "Hopefully when the budget
situation turns around, we'll be able to put those things back in
place."</TE>

<HD>Harold Charnofsky, 71; Longtime Sociology Professor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Thurber</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harold "Hal" Charnofsky, a founder of the sociology department at Cal
State Dominguez Hills who had been an All-American baseball player at
USC, has died. He was 71.</LD>
<LD>   Charnofsky died Dec. 21 of pancreatic cancer at his home in
Manhattan Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Trenton, N.J., Charnofsky came to Los Angeles with his
family when he was a youngster. He played baseball at Lincoln High
School and got a scholarship to USC. A shortstop, he was half of the
Trojans' formidable double-play combination, which included his twin
brother Stanley, a second baseman. Harold was chosen to the
All-American team in 1952.</LD>
<TE>   Charnofsky was signed to a professional contract by the New York
Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   He played for several clubs in their minor league system,
including Binghamton, N.Y., where he and his brother formed the
double-play combination; Modesto, and Greensboro, N.C. He served as
player-manager at Modesto and Greensboro and was voted manager of the
year in 1959 at Modesto.</TE>
<TE>   But while playing professional baseball, he continued his academic
career, earning a master's degree in secondary education at USC in
1957.</TE>
<TE>   From 1961-66, he was an assistant baseball coach for Rod Dedeaux
at USC, including the 1963 NCAA championship team.</TE>
<TE>   After completing his coursework for a PhD in 1966, Charnofsky
joined the faculty at Cal State Dominguez Hills, where he was one of
the founders of the sociology department. He taught at Dominguez
Hills from 1966 until this year.</TE>
<TE>   He earned his PhD at USC in 1969, writing a dissertation entitled,
"The Major League Baseball Player: a Sociological Study."</TE>
<TE>   The study, part of which Charnofsky presented to a meeting of the
American Sociological Assn. in 1967, noted that the notion of
baseball as a model of democracy, especially where race relations are
concerned, was a myth.</TE>
<TE>   In his academic career at Dominguez Hills, Charnofsky coordinated
the master's degree program in marriage, family and child counseling
from 1980-2002.</TE>
<TE>   He also received the school's outstanding teacher award in 1990
and the outstanding professor award from the Cal State University
Foundation in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife, Michele Linden-Charnofsky; sons Eric
and Michael; a daughter Tessa; his brother Stanley; sisters Beatrice
Perlberg, Charlotte Goldberg and Leonore Arvidson; stepson Scott
Linden; stepdaughters Stephanie Landon and Deborah Linden; a
grandson, two step-granddaughters and numerous nieces and nephews.</TE>
<TE>   The family suggests that donations in his name be made to the
marriage and family therapy masters degree program at Cal State
Dominguez Hills or the TreePeople or the Carson Child Guidance
Program.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held today at 3 p.m. at Carson
Community Center, 801 Carson St. in Carson.</TE>
<TE>   Another memorial service will be held at the Student Union
Building at Cal State Dominguez Hills at 1 p.m. on Feb. 9.</TE>

<HD>Margaret Hancock, 90; Memoir Tells of Her Mixed-Race Family</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Thurber</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Margaret Taylor Hancock, whose life as part of a family that lived on
both sides of the racial divide known as the color line was
chronicled in the biography "The Sweeter the Juice," has died. She
was 90.</LD>
<LD>   Hancock died Dec. 24 at a hospice in Branford, Conn., according to
her daughter, the writer Shirlee Taylor Haizlip, who wrote the
biography.</LD>
<LD>   In telling the story of her mother and a family estranged by the
harsh realities of racism, Haizlip examines the facile labels of race
and identity in 20th century America.</LD>
<TE>   Haizlip notes that in the census of 1900, her mother's family had
been classified as mulatto, but by 1910, with racism rising, the
family was classified as black. In subsequent censuses, however, part
of the family was noted as white.</TE>
<TE>   This cross-racial categorization made for some difficult economic
circumstances for those declared black, and forced some of the
fairer-skin members of the family to resort to the practice of
"passing" -- taking on a new racial identity, generally that of a
white person.</TE>
<TE>   Published in 1994 by Simon &amp; Schuster, Haizlip's book was a hit.
She went on a national book tour -- her mother in tow -- and appeared
on "Oprah" and "Larry King Live." Her mother was popular at book
signings and readings, and generally took all the notoriety in
stride, kiddingly asking her daughter "who was going to play her in
the movie."</TE>
<TE>   Hancock was born the fifth child of a family of six children. Her
mother died when she was 4, an event that broke up the family. The
supervision of most of the children fell to the eldest child, an
18-year-old male who raised his sister, twin brother and another
brother as white.</TE>
<TE>   Hancock, who was quite fair-skinned herself, and her younger
brother were given over to a series of black caretakers -- one a
first cousin, and then families who raised the children as black. The
brother who stayed with her died at a young age. Her siblings who
were raised as white and eventually learned of their black heritage
never told those they married or their offspring of their racial
heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Hancock grew up in Washington, D.C., the city of her birth, and
trained to be a teacher. She later married a black Baptist minister,
Julian A. Taylor, and moved to Connecticut, where they lived an
upper-class life.</TE>
<TE>   Active in community affairs, Hancock was a founder of the NAACP
chapter in Ansonia and was active in Democratic politics. She was
also a force in the community's foster children program -- parenting
six girls herself and placing several others with families.</TE>
<TE>   But over the years, Hancock's attempts to reconnect with her
estranged siblings met with rejection.</TE>
<TE>   On one occasion in the 1930s, she received notification of an
inheritance. When the family gathered at a lawyer's office in
Washington to deal with the legal matters, Hancock asked her
estranged kin to meet with her. They refused and left the meeting
before she arrived.</TE>
<TE>   In Haizlip's view, this was less about resentment or disdain for
her mother but spoke volumes about the racial climate of the day when
those passing as white were in constant fear that their secret would
be discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Haizlip's recounting of her mother's story started modestly as a
personal "This Is Your Life"-type of manuscript for her mother's 80th
birthday, Haizlip told The Times some years ago. "Then I saw the
drama of all the things that had happened to her. I thought, 'This
could be a book,' " Haizlip said.</TE>
<TE>   She used all available resources to trace her family ancestry,
finding strands of Africans, American Indians and Scots. The book
took 13 years to research and two to write.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Haizlip found her mother's only sister, Grace Morris
Cramer, who was eight years her mother's senior, living a quiet life
as a white woman in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Haizlip made a surprise visit to her aunt at an upscale mobile
home park and found a woman who looked like her mother and talked
like her mother. And like her mother, they both had children named
Patricia and grandchildren named Geoffrey or Jeffrey.</TE>
<TE>   But in Haizlip's view, the lives of the two sisters turned some
American stereotypes on their heads. Her aunt was fragile and alone
after the deaths of her husband and her only child. Haizlip's mother
had lost two husbands, but was living in far better means in
Connecticut, surrounded by family and grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Haizlip said that when she brought her mother out from Connecticut
to meet the sister she hadn't seen in 76 years, her mother was
nervous as an 8-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   "She kept saying that she hoped her sister would like her,"
Haizlip told The Times Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting lasted the afternoon. Both women -- who loved cats --
started petting Cramer's cat and began to establish a relationship
that grew in strength and lasted for the next six years, until
Cramer's death in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Haizlip recalled that her mother asked why she had been left
behind. Cramer could only respond: "You know, I was a little girl
too, and I was taken by my older brother."</TE>
<TE>   "At that time, she had no choice, either," Haizlip said.</TE>
<TE>   Hancock's first husband died in 1981. Her second husband, Graham
Hancock, died in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Haizlip, who lives in Los Angeles, Hancock is
survived by two other daughters, Dr. Jewelle Taylor Gibbs of Palo
Alto and Patricia Taylor Brown of North Haven, Conn.; two
stepdaughters, Mauryne Taylor Brent and Doris Keith, both of
Washington; a stepson, Robert Hancock of New Haven, Conn.; three
foster daughters; and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Hancock will be buried today in New Haven, with members from both
sides of her family's color line in attendance.</TE>

as a "This Is Your Life"-type of 80th birthday present, took 13 years

<HD>How a Single Act of Kindness Has Multiplied</HD>
<DH>Some 2,800 people have a roof over their heads as the
result of a man's dedication.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicholas Riccardi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was on a rainy winter afternoon 17 years ago that Jim Miller saw a
woman and her three children crowd into their battered car at a
Huntington Beach park and prepare to turn in for the night.</LD>
<LD>   Miller took them to his home so they could sleep under a roof. He
kept noticing more and more people who needed a place to sleep.</LD>
<LD>   "One thing led to another," Miller said, "and I said, 'We've got
to get a home.' "</LD>
<TE>   Now Miller has 43 homes across Orange and Los Angeles counties,
providing housing for 2,814 people annually.</TE>
<TE>   The Shelter for the Homeless, of which he is executive director,
has recently expanded to take in more than down-on-their-luck
families.</TE>
<TE>   It now shelters 18-year-olds who have just become legal adults and
left foster care. These youths, who generally have no family to help
them, are no longer eligible for county-supported housing in group or
foster homes and suddenly must support themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The former foster children can come with various problems. One
youth who recently left the program had lived in an abandoned hotel
for five months before being sheltered by Miller's group.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like having your own kids, but more challenging," Miller
said. "The key is to stabilize them and get them a job."</TE>
<TE>   Helping the shelter do that is a $10,000 grant from the Los
Angeles Times Holiday Campaign, which pays for trade school lessons,
clothes to wear to job interviews and other accouterments of adult
life.</TE>
<TE>   The annual Holiday Campaign was established in 2000. Last year,
the effort raised $653,000, which went to 56 charities serving Los
Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   The agencies provide services to disadvantaged children and
youths, including food, clothing and shelter; early childhood
literacy programs; and services for the developmentally delayed and
disabled.</TE>
<TE>   They also run programs to prevent drug abuse, violence and teen
pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   The nine emancipated youths cared for by Shelter for the Homeless
are housed in two buildings in Santa Ana: a converted convent for the
six boys and a residential house for the three girls and their
children.</TE>
<TE>   They have a 10 p.m. curfew but are free during the day. It might
be more liberty than they ever have enjoyed before, said Kai Brandt,
who works with them.</TE>
<TE>   The young people have counselors who train them in everything from
cleanliness to balancing a checkbook, and they are randomly tested
for drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The girls are helped with child care.</TE>
<TE>   "Oftentimes you have a child who comes out of a group home and
they have never had freedom," Brandt said.</TE>
<TE>   "When they go from super structure to no structure, that's when
they have problems."</TE>

<HD>Hotel Manager Killed in Fire Failed to Heed Official's
Warning</HD>
<DH>Use of elevator was victim's fatal mistake in San
Bernardino blaze.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a trash can blaze broke out in a downtown San Bernardino
residential hotel last month, Robert Downs grabbed a fire
extinguisher and rode the elevator to the third floor where he put
out the flames.</LD>
<LD>   After the Nov. 8 blaze, a Fire Department captain warned Downs,
the hotel manager, to stay out of the elevator if it happened again,
Battalion Chief Mike Alder recalled Sunday. Take the stairs, he was
told. Too many things can go wrong if you take the elevator.</LD>
<LD>   But when another fire broke out on the third floor of the Sunset
Hotel early Saturday, Downs ignored the advice and it cost him his
life. He was one of four men killed in the fire.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators Sunday were trying to determine whether the blaze
was deliberately set. "There's been a history of trash can fires
there ... so our guys are taking it very seriously," Alder said.</TE>
<TE>   The battalion chief said trained dogs had failed to find flammable
liquid that could have been used to start the fire. He said a fire
that started in the waist-high bin may have been fueled by shelves
holding magazines and other combustible materials.</TE>
<TE>   All of this took place in front of the elevator, he said. When the
doors opened, the hotel manager probably was met with a wall of
flames and a temperature of 1,000 to 1,500 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "When the heat hit him, it would drop him like a rock," Alder
said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also want to make sure that the hotel's fire alarm
was working, Alder said.</TE>
<TE>   None of the alarms was pulled Saturday, which Alder called
"absolutely unusual."</TE>
<TE>   During a July 30 inspection, the Fire Department found an
insufficient number of smoke detectors and alarms that weren't
working. The violations were corrected within a day, according to the
department.</TE>
<TE>   The other victims were identified as Gregory A. Abdun-Nur, 34;
Harold M. Turman, 41; and Michael Lloyd Stevens, 50.</TE>
<TE>   Six people remained hospitalized in critical or serious condition.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was limited to the third floor, but the entire hotel
sustained smoke and water damage.</TE>
<TE>   Seventy-three people who lived at the Sunset were moved from an
emergency shelter at San Bernardino High School to motels by the Red
Cross.</TE>
<TE>   Many low-income families and formerly homeless people, some with
drug, alcohol or mental health problems, resided at the Sunset.</TE>
<TE>   Alder said the hotel had been "a nightmare for us."</TE>
<TE>   He said authorities often were called there for medical
emergencies and domestic quarrels.</TE>
<TE>   Because of its age, about 40, the building was exempt from the law
that requires sprinklers in newer hotels and apartments.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of sprinklers, the building layout and the trash had
worried Alder.</TE>
<TE>   "It always has been a fear of mine to go to a fire at that
building," he said.</TE>

<DL>CORONADO, Calif.</DL>
<LD>A trolley driver had a gun put to her head by an ex-boyfriend who led
police on a freeway chase Sunday before he was caught, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   Police arrested Jayson August, 49, of Spring Valley, for
investigation of carjacking, assault and kidnapping.</LD>
<LD>   Officers stopped the trolley, which had no passengers on board,
after a 90-minute chase by throwing spike strips in front of it. A
police dog bit August and police arrested him, officers said.</LD>
<TE>   The driver of the trolley was not hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The incident began around 11:30 a.m. when witnesses reported
seeing the suspect board the trolley at a tollbooth on the Coronado
Bridge and put a gun to the driver's head, authorities said.</TE>

<LD>   Milutinovic was indicted with former Yugoslav leader Slobodan
Milosevic and three other officials on charges of atrocities against
ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo.</LD>
<LD>   Yugoslavia has declined to send Milutinovic to the U.N. court
because of his immunity, but Nebojsa Sarkic, the nation's assistant
justice minister, said authorities might start proceedings today to
hand him over.</LD>

<HD>Inspectors Search Iraqi Customs Department</HD>
<DH>Records may hold clues to imports that could be used to

<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>U.N. inspectors spent three hours at the Iraqi customs department
Sunday in their hunt for signs of banned weapons programs, while a
short circuit at the monitors' headquarters in Baghdad brought Iraqi
firefighters into the normally off-limits hotel.</LD>
<LD>   Experts say Iraq may have gone to great lengths to hide weapons of
mass destruction, secreting programs in civilian areas and using
ordinary products for military projects. A search of customs records
could help inspectors determine what Iraq has imported that could be
used to develop banned weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Inspectors also visited a state-owned electronics factory, an
engineering firm, a chemical engineering company and two other
Baghdad facilities, Eyz Co. and the Salam factory. Eyz Co. produces
electronic, communications and power distribution equipment; the
Salam factory, communications equipment.</LD>
<TE>   Also Sunday, 12 more U.N. inspectors arrived in Baghdad, bringing
to 110 the number who have worked in Iraq since inspections resumed
Nov. 27 after a four-year break.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the electrical short circuit at the Canal Hotel meant
Iraqis were allowed into the inspectors' headquarters there.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. spokesman Hiro Ueki said a small fire from the short circuit
started on the ground floor about 7 a.m. but was extinguished
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "It did not affect the premises for inspectors, which are located
on the top floor," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cleaning and maintenance crews from Cyprus, where the inspectors
have another base, were flown in to ensure that Iraqi access to the
building would be minimal. The structure was swept for electronic
listening devices before the inspectors moved in.</TE>

<HD>Kenya's Invisible Candidate</HD>
<DH>Longtime President Daniel Arap Moi didn't run, but citizens
voted against him anyway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Davan Maharaj and Patrick Mwangi</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>OTHAYA, Kenya</DL>
<LD>In the end, it was all about Moi.</LD>
<LD>   President Daniel Arap Moi was not even on the ballot in last
week's Kenyan elections, but citizens who for the first time in four
decades voted the opposition into office were essentially sweeping
out one of Africa's longest-serving leaders.</LD>
<LD>   "Kenyans said, 'We've had enough,' " said John Githongo, a
prominent political analyst. "Enough of corruption, enough of lies,
enough of mismanagement."</LD>
<TE>   Across this East African nation, people held wild celebrations to
mark the end of Moi's rule after the Electoral Commission of Kenya
officially declared opposition leader Mwai Kibaki the winner of the
presidential election. In Kibaki's hometown of Othaya, a coffee- and
tea-growing region near Mt. Kenya, villagers chugged changaa, a
potent local brew, as they danced around bonfires in the streets. In
Nairobi, the capital, jubilant Kenyans rode in cramped trucks along
Moi Avenue, shouting "Kibaki! Kibaki!"</TE>
<TE>   Uhuru Kenyatta, whom Moi handpicked to be the candidate for the
ruling Kenya African National Union, or KANU, conceded defeat after
receiving 30% of the votes -- less than half of Kibaki's tally.</TE>
<TE>   "KANU and I will respect him in his position in accordance with
our constitution," said Kenyatta, son of Kenya's first president,
Jomo Kenyatta.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Uhuru Kenyatta's defeat represented the rejection of
Moi's way of doing business. Moi, who assumed the presidency in 1978
on the death of the elder Kenyatta, was the only leader that the
majority of Kenyans knew. And like his ubiquitous portraits hanging
in all public offices and private businesses, Moi lorded over his
people, determining which villages received water, which politicians
tasted power and who benefited from the hundreds of millions of
dollars he doled out from his presidential mansion.</TE>
<TE>   Githongo and other analysts described Moi's decision to accept the
election results as a dramatic conversion to democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "He has accepted the democratic will of the people, which was
unstoppable," said Githongo, who also heads the Kenyan chapter of
Transparency International, an anti-corruption watchdog group. "Like
Saul on the road to Damascus, it appears that he has finally seen the
light."</TE>
<TE>   In the initial days of his rule, Moi was almost never described as
enlightened. In the early 1980s, after senior members of the
country's air force tried to overthrow him in a coup, Moi adopted
harsh measures, unleashing his secret police on journalists, human
rights activists and political opponents. Many Kenyans were
imprisoned for years with no charges filed against them. Moi's
decision to centralize power in the Office of the President meant
that Kenyans from all walks of life -- from government ministers to
people seeking basic government services -- found themselves beholden
to him.</TE>
<TE>   Binyavanga Wainaina, an author and playwright who was 7 years old
when Moi became president, said the way Moi did business became
Kenya's way of doing business.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember going to get my birth certificate and going through
all sorts of problems from people who wanted me to cringe and crawl
because of their perverted sense of self-importance," Wainaina said
in a recent article. "It was still a who-you-knew, who-you-are sort
of thing. It was as if if you wanted to do anything in Kenya, you
needed a godfather, who you would bow to and say, 'Your holiness,
please help me.' Everywhere was broken down into small feudal
spaces."</TE>
<TE>   But Moi's rule was not to endure. Nearly two years ago, on a visit
to the Kenyan capital, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell admonished
Moi to fulfill his constitutional obligation and not seek reelection
when his term expired in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   His decision to leave peacefully could prod other African leaders
to follow suit when their terms expire. Kenya, with unstable
neighbors including Somalia, Sudan and Congo, is a popular
destination for European and American tourists who come here for the
country's warm beaches and game parks teeming with wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   The United States' interest in Kenya has increased since the Sept.
11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Kenya is among a few African countries named by President Bush as
key strategic partners in his campaign against terror.</TE>
<TE>   Kenya suffered its second major terrorist strike in four years
when suicide bombers with alleged links to Al Qaeda blew up an
Israeli-owned resort near Mombasa last month, killing at least 16
people, including 10 Kenyans. U.S. authorities say that in 1998, Al
Qaeda was responsible for bombing the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and
in Dar es Salaam, in nearby Tanzania, killing more that 200 people
and injuring thousands.</TE>
<TE>   Moi's decision to handpick Kenyatta as KANU's leader led to the
party's poor showing at the polls, analysts say. Kenyatta, according
to some critics, was an insurance policy against post-election
prosecution for alleged corruption of Moi and his cronies. Kenyatta,
the argument went, would protect Moi's riches because Moi, during his
long tenure, had protected the Kenyatta family's business empire.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen how Kibaki will handle pressure to prosecute
senior members of Moi's administration for alleged crimes ranging
from corruption to murder.</TE>
<TE>   Several leading KANU members, who had hoped to get a shot at the
top job, defected to the opposition after Moi selected Kenyatta. And
the National Rainbow Coalition, an alliance of Kenya's previously
splintered opposition parties, began to tap into widespread anti-Moi
sentiment. "Everything is possible without Moi," chanted huge crowds
at opposition rallies across the country. Moi, who took charge of
Kenyatta's campaign, was booed and heckled when he appeared in some
KANU strongholds. In some instances, crowds paid to attend KANU
rallies would leave when the president took the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Kenyans said they were simply fed up with seeing their quality of
life deteriorate with little hope of improvement. Moi, reputed to be
one of the richest men in East Africa, was out of touch with their
problems, they said. In Othaya, 28-year-old Alan Mwangi, who cares
for two children and five siblings, on Sunday exulted in Kibaki's
win. The president-elect has vowed to provide free primary education
to all Kenyan children, a promise that secured Mwangi's vote.</TE>
<TE>   "Moi and his men looted all the money," said Mwangi, who makes
about $2.50 a day as a minibus taxi driver. "We have to forget about
this period in our history. He is not a person who should be
remembered. If Kenyatta had won, my children would have suffered as
much as I have suffered my entire life."</TE>
<TE>   "They've eaten everything," said Esther Murugi, a 72-year-old
grandmother who cares for nine grandchildren orphaned by AIDS. "Even
money that should go toward these poor children has been stolen."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say a Kibaki administration will have to find money to
deliver on some election promises, especially the pledge of free
education. Kibaki will also have to quickly institute anti-corruption
measures so that international lending agencies unlock hundreds of
millions of dollars in loans. The World Bank and International
Monetary Fund quit lending money to Moi's government because large
chunks of cash were funneled to senior government officials.</TE>
<TE>   Kibaki, who once served as Moi's vice president, promised Sunday
to make sweeping changes.</TE>
<TE>   Running a country "is not a matter of promoting the ego of a
president," the 71-year-old economist said to supporters gathered at
his mansion in Nairobi. "A president should prove himself by things
he's going to do which change the life of ordinary Kenyans."</TE>

<HD>Patient Stand on N. Korea Urged</HD>
<DH>Powell says the U.S. is focusing on a diplomatic solution
to the nuclear issue, but it will not 'appease' the regime by
resuming talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Peterson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As tensions simmered over North Korea's nuclear plans, Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell downplayed talk of crisis on Sunday and said
the United States was working for a diplomatic solution with the help
of other nations.</LD>
<LD>   Powell said the United States had political, economic and
diplomatic means to influence North Korea, and that a U.S. military
attack was not at the forefront of current plans. His comments came
in a series of television appearances that seemed designed to present
a firm and deliberate U.S. posture and also to counter fears that the
situation on the Korean peninsula was heating up precipitously.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't want to create a sense of crisis or [suggest] that we're
on the brink of war, because I don't believe we are," Powell said on
ABC's "This Week."</LD>
<TE>   He added: "Let's take this patiently. Let's take it with
deliberation. Let's work with our friends and allies."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Powell argued against a speedy resumption of
talks between the two nations, which the North Korean regime is
seeking. The United States must not "appease" the government in
Pyongyang by offering it concessions for violating its previous
agreements, he said repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't reward misbehavior of this kind by asking them: 'What
will it take [for] you to stop misbehaving?' " Powell said on CBS'
"Face the Nation."</TE>
<TE>   Powell's flurry of television spots -- he appeared on all five
Sunday morning network news shows -- underscored the extraordinary
international pressures on the administration, which simultaneously
faces the possibility of war in Iraq and a nuclear crisis on the
Korean peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and other countries have expressed concern over
North Korea's efforts to restart the Yongbyon energy facility, which
is capable of producing plutonium for nuclear weapons. North Korea
has claimed that the plant, which has been closed for eight years,
will be used for producing electricity, but the Bush administration
disputes that. North Korean officials last week escalated tensions by
ordering nuclear inspectors from the United Nations out of the
country.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, the United States agreed to provide much-needed fuel oil,
plus two nuclear reactors designed to produce only electrical power,
to North Korea if Pyongyang halted a program that could have led to
the development of nuclear weapons. North Korea then shut down the
Yongbyon plant.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said Sunday that North Korea secretly started a program to
enrich uranium in the late 1990s. U.S. officials learned of the
development in October, and the administration halted the fuel oil
shipments.</TE>
<TE>   On the subject of Iraq, Powell said that war was not inevitable.
The regime in Baghdad, he said, has shown some cooperation with the
U.N. weapons inspectors who are searching for evidence to determine
whether Iraq has secretly been developing weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   In the event of war, Powell said the United States would try to
secure the nation's oil fields, saying that they are the property of
the Iraqi people and should not be destroyed by the country's leaders
as part of a "scorched earth" policy to damage Iraq's infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   "They have been cooperating with the inspectors, and we'll see if
that cooperation continues," he said on ABC. "There's been some
resistance in recent days.... We'll see whether that attitude of
cooperation continues."</TE>
<TE>   Powell also declared that the United States would try to prevent
Iraq from becoming splintered if the regime of Saddam Hussein is
toppled. Asked about the possibility that Iraq would fragment into
ministates dominated by different Muslim sects and ethnic Kurds, he
told "Face the Nation" that the risk is genuine.</TE>
<TE>   "We are sensitive to it. We do not believe that would be in the
interest of anyone," he said, adding, "We are committed to keeping
Iraq intact." But while the Bush administration has made clear that
military action against Iraq is very possible, Powell suggested that
the dispute with North Korea might be solved by "a different set of
tools."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the tensions with North Korea, Powell noted that
"military action is always an option, but it is not an option that is
in the forefront of our thinking right now, because it doesn't seem
necessary or appropriate.... There are no forces being put on alert
on either side."</TE>
<TE>   He pointed to a practical argument against a U.S. military strike
on the Yongbyon facility: "It's now a functioning facility, so it
would be a dirty hit if we were to go after it," he told "Fox News
Sunday," alluding to the risks of radiation and civilian victims.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, he expressed hope that the nuclear issue could be
defused with the aid of the international community, pointing
specifically to China, Japan, South Korea and Russia as having an
interest in the outcome. On "Fox News Sunday," he maintained that the
international message to North Korea was clear: " 'You're moving in
the wrong direction. This is not the right thing to do.' "</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials also suggested that North Korea had the
ability to end the international chorus of disapproval. A senior
White House official said that Powell was only trying to remind North
Koreans that "the international community is standing ready to help
them, but they have to change course and show a willingness to end
their nuclear weapons program."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats on Sunday urged the White House to begin talks with
North Korea. The administration has opposed negotiations, contending
that talks are not the appropriate response to North Korea's
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), outgoing chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said President Bush was wrong to have cut off
talks with North Korea when he took office.</TE>
<TE>   "We should not be afraid to talk," Levin said on ABC. "We're not
going to negotiate giving them anything for doing what they already
promised to do, but they should hear from our lips how significant
their missteps have been. We're not going to appease them, but
there's nothing wrong with talking to them."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman ( D-Conn.), another member of the Armed
Services Committee, agreed: "We ought to be confident enough of our
strength -- and we are, after all, the strongest nation in the world
-- to go right back to direct negotiations with them," he said on
CBS. "And I'd put the military option on the table as part of those
negotiations."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and North Korea have various channels through which to
communicate, including third-party countries.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the International Atomic Energy Agency has scheduled a
meeting next Monday in which the board of governors could refer the
matter to the U.N. Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, James A. Kelly, assistant secretary of State for East
Asian and Pacific affairs, is expected to visit South Korea in
mid-January, where he will meet with individuals who have contacts in
North Korea. It was Kelly who first learned in October that North
Korea had resumed its nuclear program.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Pyongyang have called on U.S. officials to sit down
and negotiate a resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "It is quite self-evident that dialogue is impossible without
sitting face to face, and a peaceful settlement of the issue would be
unthinkable without dialogue," said a government spokesman quoted by
KCNA, the North's state-run news agency.</TE>

<LD>Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Caracas demanding
the resignation of President Hugo Chavez on Sunday, the 28th day of a
general strike that has nearly halted oil exports and exhausted
domestic gasoline supplies.</LD>
<LD>   The protesters converged on Victory Avenue as politicians,
businesspeople and labor leaders read a long list of arguments why
Chavez should quit.</LD>

supporters that he was beating the strike.</LD>

Palestinian state is today etched in rubble and poverty. In a shift
of momentous proportions, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has
succeeded in collapsing the Palestinian Authority and relegating its
head, Yasser Arafat, to political oblivion.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis say the Palestinians are to blame for their fate. The
army reoccupied the West Bank and parts of the Gaza Strip as part of
a campaign to stop suicide bombers and root out Palestinian gunmen
fighting Israeli forces and killing Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians say their entire population is being made to suffer
for the actions of a few.</TE>
<TE>   There is plenty of blame to go around. One thing is certain:
Palestinians are facing a long-term deterioration of the society they
hoped to build, and their vision of independence and sovereignty has
rarely seemed more remote. By the same token, Israel in the coming
year will have to decide whether to assume the job of providing basic
services to the reoccupied territory or risk being blamed for a major
humanitarian disaster at its doorstep.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the West Bank -- in Ramallah, say, or Nablus --
physical damage may be more dramatic, the death toll higher. But it
is in the dozens of small towns here that would form the backbone of
a future Palestine where the erosion is most insidious.</TE>
<TE>   In Deir Istiya, hardly an adult male today has work. Barter has
replaced commerce. The single clinic is overrun with patients but
undersupplied with medicine. Children sometimes don't have enough to
eat, and signs of malnutrition have crept into a population that was
once relatively healthy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Essentially Trapped</TE>
<TE>   The 4,000 or so residents of Deir Istiya are essentially trapped.
The entrance to the town is blocked by three haphazard walls of
rust-red boulders courtesy of the Israeli army. Residents
periodically open up an alternative, muddy path through nearby olive
groves to allow passage of a few hardy souls and four-wheel-drive
vehicles. The army routinely detects and closes the paths, and the
residents find new ones to open.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors, some students, merchants and officials make the tedious
journey from Deir Istiya to other towns for supplies, studies or
business. Most residents, however, don't leave, or do so only rarely.</TE>
<TE>   Buildings in this ancient-stone town have the look of desertion.
Even on a recent weekday afternoon, after the rain had stopped and
yellow light streaked the sky, almost every store was shuttered.
Restaurants and most businesses closed down long ago.</TE>
<TE>   Three generations of Deir Istiya males loitered in the streets, as
they do most days. The older men placed plastic chairs at roadside,
facing nothing really except an empty street and a stand of cactus
and silvery olive trees. They smoked narghiles and talked about
politics and the number of Palestinians killed that day in gun
battles with Israeli troops. Someone roasted freshly shucked ears of
corn.</TE>
<TE>   As Israeli helicopter gunships passed overhead, one man,
65-year-old Ali Mansour, railed against America. "They give us flour
to feed us with one hand," he said, referring to U.S. food donations,
"and give Israel the weapons to kill us with the other hand."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many other Palestinian towns, Deir Istiya -- 24 miles from
Tel Aviv and surrounded by Jewish settlements -- is not plastered
with posters of "martyrs," Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in
the ongoing conflict. Despite that, the town did produce a handful of
such figures. Three gunmen who hailed from the village were killed in
a clash with Israeli troops about a year ago; another native son was
a suicide bomber in the Israeli city of Netanya almost two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The siege on Deir Istiya was tightened after two ambushes at the
nearby settlement of Emmanuel, one in July that killed nine Israelis
and another seven months earlier that killed 11.</TE>
<TE>   During a recent visit to the village, Deir Istiya's sparse, clean
clinic was the center of most activity. Dr. Yasser Qasin, 29, said he
sees an average of 80 patients on the two days a week he practices --
twice the number who sought care before the intifada. There is a high
rate of hypertension, diabetes and gastrointestinal disease, which he
chalks up to stress and poor nutrition. Of special concern, he said,
is a slightly higher rate of miscarriages and heart attacks, lower
birth weights and anemia in mothers and children.</TE>
<TE>   Births are down, as well, he said. Eighty-seven babies were born
in Deir Istiya last year; there were 57 this year, and almost all at
home, not in hospitals. "If you want to take your wife to a hospital
to deliver, it's impossible now" because of army roadblocks, Qasin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Qasin has worked at the clinic for a year. He used to practice in
the hospital in Jericho, but he can no longer reach that eastern city
with any certainty.</TE>
<TE>   Abir Selman, a nurse, has worked in Deir Istiya and neighboring
villages for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is born big anymore," said Selman, 30. Babies are often
anemic and stay that way the first couple of years of their lives,
she said. Their faces are pale, their eyelids are pink instead of
red, they are listless. "We had this before [the intifada], but it
was much less," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sundus Abdul-Karim, pregnant, anemic and suffering a kidney stone,
shuffled into the clinic for her appointment. Dressed in a velour
robe-like dress and plastic sandals, despite the cold, she said her
husband hasn't worked in months, and they can no longer take their
deaf 7-year-old for special education in Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   This is her 12th pregnancy. The 36-year-old manages to feed her
children bread, rice and tea with sugar from donations ferried in by
the Red Cross once a month or so. Occasionally they obtain chicken.
For the youngest, she makes a pudding-like substance from starch and
water, "whatever I can do to make them think they have milk," she
said. "To fill their stomachs and stop them from crying."</TE>
<TE>   People like Abdul-Karim were always poor and are more so now. But
many Palestinians had reached a level of prosperity in the years
leading up to the September 2000 outbreak of the intifada. That makes
the deterioration so startling.</TE>
<TE>   A survey over the summer by the Johns Hopkins schools of medicine
and public health, which was financed by the U.S. Agency for
International Development, found that one in five children under age
5 in the Palestinian territories is suffering from malnutrition. The
study said the figure was on a par with impoverished Third World
countries such as Bangladesh. Before 2000, Palestinians had the
highest standard of living and education of any Arab people outside
the Persian Gulf region.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian society has flipped from being highly productive to
being dependent on handouts and humanitarian aid.</TE>
<TE>   "So rapid has been the humanitarian collapse that it will take an
[enormous] emergency program ... to prevent a complete breakdown in
Palestinian society," the commissioner general of the United Nations'
Palestinian refugee agency, Peter Hansen, said this month in
announcing a multimillion-dollar appeal for donations.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli military officials say they make the delivery of food and
medicine a priority in the villages and towns that they have sealed
off. They deny impeding medical care or other help.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Physicians for Human Rights, after a survey in the West
Bank, concluded that stillbirths were up fivefold in rural
Palestinian areas and vaccination programs depleted. Palestinians
give even bleaker statistics.</TE>
<TE>   According to the World Bank, nearly three-quarters of Palestinians
are living below the poverty line, defined as $2 a day, unemployment
has soared to more than half the population and Palestinian industry
is on the verge of collapse. The Palestinian economy loses $7.6
million a day, according to the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Widespread Pain</TE>
<TE>   "Every place in the West Bank is really hurting," said Thomas Neu,
director of American Near East Refugee Aid, a U.S.-funded
organization. "The physical devastation, from tanks and shelling, is
just the tip of the iceberg. That's cosmetic compared to other
aspects" such as economic and agricultural losses, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous villages that live on what they grow simply decided not
to plant this season, he said. Unable to reach a market for their
products, and in some cases unable to reach the fields themselves,
residents decided it wasn't worth it.</TE>
<TE>   In Deir Istiya, 70% of the work force had jobs in Israel before
the intifada began, according to Mayor Nafez Mansour, one of the
town's two dentists, who says that only half his patients these days
can afford to pay for treatment. Israel now bans most Palestinian
workers, so most of Deir Istiya's men are unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   The rest depended heavily on olive harvesting. These Samarian
hills are one of the West Bank's richest olive-growing regions. The
people of Deir Istiya and several neighboring villages had trouble
harvesting this season because of attacks from Jewish settlers who
claimed the groves were often used by terrorists as firing positions.</TE>
<TE>   With the protection of foreign and Israeli peace activists, the
Palestinians were able to finish the harvest successfully. Deir
Istiya's estimated half a million olive trees were plucked of their
fruit, and gallons and gallons of oil were squeezed in antique,
sputtering presses.</TE>
<TE>   But then another problem emerged: Locked inside their village, the
people of Deir Istiya could not reach their traditional markets to
sell the oil.</TE>
<TE>   Townsfolk like Fuad Awad, the man rolling his cigarettes, and
Saeed Zeidan, the man whose house is unfinished, are now stuck with
jugs of oil that they cannot sell, even after slashing the price 40%.
Some villagers have taken to paying their bills or purchasing goods
from the grocery store with olive oil.</TE>
<TE>   Awad and Zeidan were born in Deir Istiya but, like many
Palestinians, went to Kuwait to earn money before returning about 12
years ago. Things were comfortable in Deir Istiya. Even at times of
political upheaval, it always seemed that there was work and a
measure of prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   But all that has changed, Zeidan said.</TE>
<TE>   "People had money, there was work, either here or inside Israel,"
said Zeidan, 46 and burly, wrapped in a black and white checkered
kaffiyeh and torn leather jacket. "Now people are afraid. They don't
go out at night. They're afraid of getting shot. The army comes and
breaks into houses."</TE>
<TE>   Zeidan began building his family home just before the intifada
started. He invested about $20,000 in what was going to be a
two-story abode near the town's entrance. But he lost his job in
Israel as a construction subcontractor, and his project halted. He
and his wife, Suheila, are living with their children and his
parents, crowded into his late grandfather's home.</TE>
<TE>   In a society where large families are the norm, Zeidan says he and
his wife are stopping at four.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can't take care of them," Zeidan said, "why have
children?"</TE>

<HD>3 U.S. Doctors Killed by Gunman in Yemen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SANA, Yemen</DL>
<LD>A suspected Muslim extremist shot and killed three American doctors
at a missionary hospital in Yemen today, security officials said.</LD>
<LD>   A fourth doctor, also an American, was wounded in the attack at
the Jibla Missionary Hospital in Ibb province, 120 miles south of the
capital, Sana, security sources said on condition of anonymity.
Sources at the U.S. Embassy in Sana confirmed the victims were U.S.
citizens.</LD>
<LD>   The officials said the attacker was a suspected Muslim
fundamentalist who entered the hospital's complex and opened fire
with a semiautomatic rifle and a gun. He was arrested.</LD>
<TE>   A Yemeni official described the gunman as an Islamic militant.
After he was arrested, he allegedly told police that he had shot the
two men and two women to "cleanse his religion and get closer to
Allah."</TE>
<TE>   Yemeni security sources linked the so-far unidentified man to a
member of an Islamist opposition party who killed a prominent
opposition official last week.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital was founded in 1967 by Southern Baptists James and
June Young of Ruston, La.</TE>
<TE>   According to a U.S. State Department report, the hospital has
experienced occasional threats and harassment from local Islamic
extremists who fear the hospital might be used to spread
Christianity. Local religious extremists have reportedly harassed its
Muslim employees.</TE>

<HD>New Year's Delicacy Is Bittersweet for Family</HD>
<DH>An L.A. shop has made mochi for 99 years, but times and
tastes have changed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Tamaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just like his father and grandfather before him, Brian Kito grabs a
steaming, 2-pound blob of rice and, in a matter of seconds, coaxes it
into a smooth bun.</LD>
<LD>   Kito is making okasane mochi: large, double-decker pieces of
steamed, kneaded rice that, when topped with a dainty tangerine, in
Japanese culture are said to symbolize the new year and a hope for
prosperity.</LD>
<LD>   It is a task the Kito family has dutifully performed for
generations, helping supply Japanese Americans in Los Angeles with
the many holiday variations of mochi, one of Japan's culinary
delicacies.</LD>
<TE>   This holiday season, it is taking on a particular significance.
Fugetsu-Do, the mochi confection shop that Kito's family has owned
since 1903, will turn 100 next year, a cause for celebration in
downtown Los Angeles' historic Little Tokyo neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "I never expected it would last for 100 years," said Roy Kito, 83,
who handed the business over to his son, Brian, 18 years ago. "I'm
kind of happy Brian has kept it. He makes me proud."</TE>
<TE>   The shop's 100th anniversary, however, is somewhat bittersweet.</TE>
<TE>   The New Year's season isn't as profitable as it used to be, partly
because of growing competition at home and from Japan, according to
Brian Kito. And as Japanese Americans become more assimilated, they
are buying less mochi.</TE>
<TE>   Customers' New Year's orders, which were paid, wrapped and bagged
in advance, once filled three binders, according to Brian Kito. Now,
there are only 100 to 150 advance orders -- a change he attributes
partly to the proliferation of Asian markets that have boosted the
availability of mochi.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese traditions that feature the treats are also practiced by
fewer people in the United States, he explained. Spring sales of
sakura mochi, which is prized for its blush color and young
cherry-tree leaf wrapping, have also weakened.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the market mirrors what has happened to the Japanese
community, which has moved from Little Tokyo to the suburbs, taking
its purchasing power and developing tastes for non-Japanese desserts.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say the business has lost significance.</TE>
<TE>   Fugetsu-Do conjures up fond memories for many in Southern
California's Japanese community, perhaps because, other than its
location, so little about the business has changed over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Customers relish the gold and white paper that the Kito family has
used for decades to wrap their pastry boxes. The shop's display case
is the same one the family has used since it moved to its current 1st
Street location in 1956, as are the two dozen wooden drawers used to
sort pastries for packing.</TE>
<TE>   So dear are Joanne Tashiro-Tang's memories of the shop that when
she got married in August, she dragged her husband, Terence Tang, and
their wedding party to Fugetsu-Do so they could be photographed
there.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of my family didn't understand why I wanted to take photos
there for my wedding," said Tashiro-Tang, who lives in San Jose. "But
when I was little, my grandmother used to take me there. She always
used to say that Fugetsu-Do was better."</TE>
<TE>   "So I think she would understand why I was doing it," Tashiro-Tang
continued. "And I hope she would be proud I was remembering."</TE>
<TE>   Fugetsu-Do will face its biggest rush of the year over the next
few days as mochi-loving customers snap up tens of thousands of
pieces for their New Year's celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese not only like to give the treats as gifts at New Year's,
they also use the okasane mochi to decorate their homes, and they
float smaller pieces of plain mochi in ozoni, a special New Year's
soup.</TE>
<TE>   During December, the staff of Fugetsu-Do makes an average of 4,500
pieces a day, compared with 1,500 to 2,000 pieces a day the rest of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we make mochi all day and all night long, so by New
Year's, our hands are pretty much scorched," Brian Kito, 46, said of
himself and his predominantly Latino crew.</TE>
<TE>   New Year's aside, the mochi business isn't what it once was.</TE>
<TE>   Waning traditions include handing out namagashi -- sweetened bean
paste, typically wrapped in a thin layer of mochi or a cake coating
-- at funerals. Funeral attendees give envelopes of money referred to
as koden to the family of the deceased, and in exchange the family
bestows the pastries on those attending.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dying of some traditions," Brian Kito said. "It's the type
of thing that was typically learned from Grandma and Grandpa."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he is ready to serve families that want to carry on
Japanese traditions. He recalled a recent order placed by a family
that had lost its matriarch, a 102-year-old woman named Daisy whose
favorite color was violet.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than choose a traditional funeral confection, the family
worked with Kito on a custom, two-piece set. It consisted of a violet
flower and a white flower, each made of mochi and topped with a
yellow center made of bean paste and sprinkled with poppy seeds.</TE>
<TE>   "I was drudging through this order," Brian Kito recalled. "It was
600 pieces of the same thing. But they were nice people, and I knew
it would make their day. It was also tradition. It made sense."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say Brian Kito runs the business exactly as his
father and grandfather did.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his father, who focused solely on making and selling mochi,
Brian Kito divides his time between running the family business and
getting involved in the community. He busies himself during slower
periods by organizing volunteers to patrol Little Tokyo and staff a
police drop-in center to attract visitors to the neighborhood and, he
hopes, his family's business.</TE>
<TE>   At any given time, two dozen or more varieties of namagashi are
for sale at Fugetsu-Do, which also has a small shop in Little Tokyo's
Mitsuwa Marketplace. The edible art sells for about 90 cents a piece,
and each variety conveys something about nature, Kito said. For
example, kuzu manju -- sweetened, dark azuki bean paste covered with
a translucent mochi coating -- is meant to resemble a brook running
over pebbles. "It's suppose to give you the feeling of being cool,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, he recounted how the family business got
started, as he prepared a large batch of yokan -- sleek, green bars
made of sugar, lima bean paste, water and gelatin -- in a massive
copper kettle. His grandfather Seiichi Kito learned how to make yokan
and other treats at a shop called Fugetsu-Do in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Seiichi Kito bestowed the same name on the shop he opened in
November 1903 with the help of his business partners to serve Little
Tokyo's growing Japanese community.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody had a pastry shop in Little Tokyo back then, so it would
get very busy," Roy Kito recalled. "We would put up a rope and tell
customers they couldn't come into the store."</TE>
<TE>   Business was disrupted during World War II, when Seiichi Kito and
his son Roy were among the 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry sent
to internment camps. At the Heart Mountain camp in Wyoming, Roy Kito
said, on a small stove, his father made manju -- cake-covered,
bean-filled pastries -- for elderly Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, the family returned to Little Tokyo. But because
they could not afford to pay the back rent demanded by their
landlord, they found themselves without the equipment to resume their
pastry-making business. Roy Kito said he started Fugetsu-Do grocery
store, from which the family started selling namagashi.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent mochi-making demonstration, Brian Kito said, an
elderly Japanese woman recalled running sugar rations from her family
over to his grandfather, so Seiichi Kito could make manju for them.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Kito is searching for more anecdotes for a family reunion
next year. He said it's common for his three siblings and many
cousins to recall the days leading up to each New Year's as a time of
working hard as a family.</TE>
<TE>   "They remember napping on the sugar sacks and shivering in the
back as the fans cooled the namagashi," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He plans to keep running the business as long as it continues to
draw customers.</TE>
<TE>   Although he hopes that his son Korey, 2, will possess the Kito
family work ethic, he doubts the boy will follow in his footsteps by
someday running Fugetsu-Do.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm almost positive he won't," Brian Kito said. "But my son will
still grow up with a father with a little more culture than if I
hadn't done this."</TE>

<HD>Bush Ally Is Top Contender for Nomination to Supreme Court</HD>
<DH>If a vacancy occurs as anticipated, Alberto Gonzales could
become the first Latino justice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales, the soft-spoken son of migrant
farm workers, has emerged as the overwhelming favorite for a Supreme
Court nomination in the months ahead, a move that would give
President Bush a historic and politically powerful chance to name the
first Latino to the nation's highest court.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzales' ascension has been remarkable -- from a childhood home
without hot running water, to Harvard Law School, to the White House.
He has been a trusted friend of the president since Bush recruited
him as a general counsel when he was elected governor of Texas in
1994.</LD>
<LD>   Now the 47-year-old former Texas Supreme Court justice is in
charge of the process for recommending a Supreme Court nominee.</LD>
<TE>   Two years ago, Dick Cheney, another trusted Bush advisor, was put
in charge of selecting a running mate for Bush and emerged with the
job.</TE>
<TE>   The process could repeat itself.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a huge lead over everyone else," one administration
official said of Gonzales.</TE>
<TE>   If Bush names Gonzales to replace Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, a prospect that is becoming more likely, conservatives
worry that the president will shift the high court to the left, not
the right, on key issues such as affirmative action and abortion.</TE>
<TE>   The usual speculation over a Supreme Court vacancy grew more
intense after November, when Republicans retook the Senate.
Rehnquist, 78, had said he preferred to step down when a Republican
president could fill his seat.</TE>
<TE>   And all of the justices say they do not want to retire during a
presidential election year. So, if 2004 is out, that means 2003 is
the year for Rehnquist and possibly Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, 72,
to retire.</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist has been hobbled by knee surgery since late November. A
few days before Christmas, the chief justice, walking slowly with a
cane, went to see Bush at the White House. The unannounced visit has
only heightened speculation that he will retire at the end of the
court's term in late June.</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist took his seat on the Supreme Court in January 1972, the
fourth and final nominee of President Nixon.</TE>
<TE>   He compiled an unwaveringly conservative record on matters ranging
from crime and the death penalty to abortion, religion, affirmative
action and free speech. President Reagan elevated him to be chief
justice of the United States in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist is fond of saying that as chief justice he has only one
vote, the same as his eight colleagues. But filling Rehnquist's seat
as chief justice could pose a special problem for the White House. At
first glance, some legal experts say Gonzales lacks stature and
experience as a federal judge. But other options also do not appear
promising on second glance, administration lawyers say.</TE>
<TE>   One popular choice would be to elevate O'Connor, the first woman
to serve on the high court. If Bush named her to replace Rehnquist
and chose Gonzales to fill her seat, the president would get credit
for two historic firsts. O'Connor would be the first woman to head a
branch of the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   But in a television interview this year, O'Connor herself offered
the best counterargument. "I'm too old," she replied firmly when
asked about her possible promotion.</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives would be happier if Bush promoted Justice Antonin
Scalia, 66. While O'Connor has voted to preserve the right to
abortion, the ban on official school prayers and the Miranda decision
that allows criminal suspects to remain silent, Scalia has voted to
reverse all three.</TE>
<TE>   Scalia, along with Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas, form the
court's conservative wing. During the presidential campaign, Bush
cited Scalia as his favorite justice.</TE>
<TE>   But liberal activists and Senate Democrats could unite against a
Scalia nomination. An easy confirmation for Gonzales would turn into
a bitter fight if his nomination is coupled with Scalia's elevation.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a risk to go with Scalia. I wonder whether the Senate
would confirm him," said Nan Aron, who heads the liberal Alliance for
Justice.</TE>
<TE>   Liberal Republicans, such as Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania,
played a key role in killing the Supreme Court nomination of Judge
Robert Bork in 1987. A supporter of abortion rights, Specter said he
wouldn't vote for a court nominee who was determined to overturn Roe
vs. Wade.</TE>
<TE>   Scalia has vowed to oppose the abortion right at every
opportunity. Specter, a senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary
Committee, would stand as an important obstacle to his confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   If Rehnquist and O'Connor were to retire in the spring, Bush could
nominate J. Harvie Wilkinson, the chief judge of the U.S. 4th Circuit
Court of Appeals in Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   He is a well-liked and highly esteemed conservative judge whose
past includes clerking for Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell,
working as a lawyer in the Reagan administration and serving as
editorial page editor at the (Norfolk) Virginian-Pilot.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkinson, 58, has been at the top of the White House list of
candidates. Two weeks ago, Gonzales chose as deputy White House
counsel David Leitch, a 41-year-old lawyer who clerked for Wilkinson
and Rehnquist.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike with Gonzales, Bush would not get a political boost
from naming Wilkinson to the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Other leading candidates include Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl,
a favorite of Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft; Deputy Atty. Gen. Larry
Thompson; and Judge J. Michael Luttig, a conservative who worked in
the first Bush White House.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, conservatives focused their hopes on Miguel Estrada, a
native of Honduras and Bush's nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington. If he had been confirmed, he could have emerged as an
alternative to Gonzales. But the Democrats have stalled his
confirmation, leaving the way clear for Gonzales.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in San Antonio, the second of eight children of Pablo
and Maria Gonzales. The two had met as teenage farm workers, and
neither went beyond the sixth grade in school. After high school,
Alberto enlisted in the Air Force and later won a spot at the Air
Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo. But he left after two years,
graduated from Rice University in Houston and earned a law degree
from Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Bush won his first race as governor of Texas, he
recruited Gonzales, and the two have worked together since, except
for Gonzales' two-year stint on the Texas Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   As White House counsel, Gonzales has moved to strengthen Bush's
power as a wartime commander by saying, for example, that the
president on his own authority can designate terrorism suspects as
"enemy combatants" and lock them up without criminal charges, a trial
or even access to a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he has moved to shield the White House from
outside scrutiny. His office refused a request from the General
Accounting Office to learn who met with Vice President Cheney when he
was formulating the administration's energy plan.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO went to court, but the administration won the first round
when Judge John Bates, a new Bush appointee, threw out the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales also won plaudits from conservatives for ending the
American Bar Assn.'s long-standing special role in evaluating
judicial nominees and for surrounding himself with young lawyers with
conservative credentials. They include Brett Kavanaugh, 37, formerly
a key staffer for Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr and the
reputed author of much of the "Starr Report" that called for
President Clinton's impeachment.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, many conservatives have remained wary of Gonzales,
believing he has a moderate-to-liberal view on issues such as
affirmative action and abortion.</TE>
<TE>   A key test will come in the next three weeks when the White House
must decide whether to intervene in the pending Supreme Court case
involving the University of Michigan's affirmative action policy.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, in an interview with The Times, Gonzales said he was
not troubled with the notion of using a person's race or ethnicity as
one factor in their favor.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that I've been helped because of my ethnicity," he said.
"Personally, I'm not offended that race is a factor. But it should
never be the overriding factor or the most important factor."</TE>
<TE>   That moderate position on affirmative action is troubling to many
conservatives, who hope that the White House will side with Rehnquist
and Scalia in calling for a strict ban on the use of race in college
admissions.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a worry from the beginning among conservatives
that Gonzales is not reliable on abortion and racial preferences, two
very important issues for conservatives," said Roger Clegg, general
counsel for the Center for Equal Opportunity. "I think the
president's base feels very strongly about this issue, and they'll be
very unhappy if the administration goes the wrong way on it."</TE>

<HD>The Old South, Up North</HD>
<DH>Milwaukee is the most segregated metro area, data show. Its
black residents face glaring inequities in income, schools and home
loans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>The jeers and taunts, the hate hit them as they reached the bridge.
Bricks flew. They kept walking, crossing "the line between Africa and
Poland," marching though the white neighborhoods on the other side of
the Menomonee River.</LD>
<LD>   The black men and women of Milwaukee marched again the next
evening, and the next, vowing that they would not remain cooped up in
the "Negro district." They marched for 200 days before the city and
its suburbs finally passed laws granting blacks the right to live
where they wanted.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty-five years later, the region remains divided, the races
separate and the housing the most segregated in America.</LD>
<TE>   The furor over GOP Mississippi Sen. Trent Lott's praise for a
former segregationist candidate for president has focused attention
on the long history of racial division in the South. These days,
however, the gulf between white and black is widest in the North.</TE>
<TE>   In Milwaukee, where 37% of the city's 600,000 residents are
African American, the disparities between the races are among the
greatest in the nation. The inequities are glaring in nearly every
social index: income, child poverty, education, even access to home
mortgage loans.</TE>
<TE>   Blacks in metropolitan Milwaukee earn just 49 cents for every
dollar that whites earn, far below the national average of 64 cents
to the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, 44% of the city's black children live in families
scrambling to subsist on incomes below the poverty line. Only 10% of
white children are equally poor.</TE>
<TE>   Even middle-income African American families face inequities: They
are denied home loans three times as often as middle-income whites,
the biggest racial gap in America.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee is home to three-quarters of Wisconsin's African
American residents, so the racial disparities statewide show up
starkly in this sprawling city of smokestacks and steeples.</TE>
<TE>   The state does extremely well, for instance, in graduation rates
for white students. But just 41% of black students finish high school
-- the lowest rate in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at our city, you don't see the blight and decay
that exist in other cities," said Ralph Hollman, president of the
Milwaukee Urban League. "So it can be easy not to recognize our
problems. But when you look at the statistics, you see."</TE>
<TE>   The latest statistic comes from a new Census Bureau report that
names the Milwaukee metropolitan region the most segregated in the
nation, based on an analysis of where blacks and whites live and how
isolated each race is from the other.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor John O. Norquist disputes the Census Bureau's conclusion,
arguing that analysts unfairly compared his city with others with far
smaller black populations.</TE>
<TE>   But when independent demographers measure Milwaukee against metro
areas with racially diverse populations, the same picture emerges.</TE>
<TE>   This city on the glittering shore of Lake Michigan ranks high in
every measure of housing segregation, at or near the top of lists
dominated by Northern cities: Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland,
Detroit, St. Louis, Newark, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The gutsy marches of 1967 and 1968 may have earned blacks the
right to live in any neighborhood, but very few have ventured into
the suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   In the city too, they remain in traditionally black neighborhoods
north of the Menomonee River. Whites live in the south, joined by a
growing number of Latino and Asian immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Woodrow Reed, now a middle-age car mechanic, crossed the river on
those marches as a defiant black teen. He is proud, even now, of the
victory. But he has long since retreated to what he calls "the heart
of the 'hood."</TE>
<TE>   He does not stray south of the river, does not cross the wasteland
of the Menomonee River Valley, with its tangle of railroad tracks and
old brick smokestacks. He stays where he feels comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm back where I came from," Reed said.</TE>
<TE>   John Logan, a sociologist, sees similar patterns in cities across
the Midwest and the Northeast.</TE>
<TE>   They have maintained, he said, "almost an iron curtain" dividing
black neighborhoods from white.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, several Southern and Western cities with substantial
African American populations have drawn note for their integration --
among them, the Raleigh-Durham region of North Carolina; Tampa, Fla.;
Norfolk, Va.; Augusta, Ga.; and in California, San Diego and
Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   For blacks to be evenly integrated through the Milwaukee
metropolitan region, 82% of them would have to move.</TE>
<TE>   To achieve such balance in the region around Augusta, Ga., just
45% of blacks would need to move.</TE>
<TE>   To take another index of segregation: Blacks in Riverside or San
Diego are more than twice as likely as blacks in Milwaukee to be
exposed to whites.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen-year-old Naomi McBride, who is black, is asked if she ever
sees whites in her impoverished north-side neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "If you drive around," she suggests. She sounds dubious.</TE>
<TE>   "You can basically take a marker and map out the white boundaries
and the black boundaries," said Genyne Edwards, 29, a black lawyer
who recently returned to Milwaukee after nine years.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, some residents refuse to accept the calcified patterns
of segregation.</TE>
<TE>   One of the few whites left in the Rufus King neighborhood in
northern Milwaukee is a 70-year-old woman who has lived in her
bungalow since 1941.</TE>
<TE>   The woman, who would not give her name, resisted the "white
flight" in the 1970s, and she now waves cheerily to her black
neighbors as she tidies up her lawn. "I don't see that we have a
problem in this city," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Freeman, 25, a black woman who lives on the south side,
agreed: "To me, it's a big melting pot," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Civil rights activist Marion Heaney wishes she could believe that.</TE>
<TE>   Heaney, who is white, helped elect the city's first (and for a
dozen years, only) African American council member in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   In the half-century since, the rigid segregation she fought so
hard has barely eased, she said. "I don't think people on this end of
town would be very happy to have a black family move in," Heaney, 78,
said as she walked her terrier near her south-side home.</TE>
<TE>   "My kids go to school with some colored kids, but people in my
generation don't accept them as much," agreed Cheryl Fabian, 39.
Although she has lived in Milwaukee all her life, Fabian, who is
white, has ventured to the northern side just a few times, to drop
off toys for needy children at Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   To explain the stubborn legacy of segregation in the Midwest and
Northeast, demographers cast back to the 1920s and 1930s, when
African Americans began moving in large numbers to the great hubs of
the industrial age -- Northern cities such as Chicago, Detroit and
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Factory foremen welcomed their labor. But real estate agents
refused to sell them homes outside a few designated blocks. As late
as the 1950s, even the federal government offered home loans only in
neighborhoods without any "incompatible racial or social groups."</TE>
<TE>   In Milwaukee, blacks were crammed into the oldest neighborhoods in
the central city, into the narrow row homes that even then were
beginning to sag with rot. The segregation was ruthlessly enforced.
Several suburbs passed laws banning blacks from walking the streets
at night.</TE>
<TE>   During that era of legal discrimination, most blacks in the South
lived in rural areas. It was not until the late 1980s that an
extraordinary boom in the Southern economy -- coupled with the
collapse of many Rust Belt industries -- began to lure blacks by the
millions to Southern cities. Reversing the "Great Migration" of the
1930s, African Americans flocked to such newly vibrant hubs as
Atlanta, Dallas and Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   "That rapid growth makes it easier to integrate because it creates
new residential developments that don't have reputations as black or
white neighborhoods," said Logan, the sociologist.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, just 15% of black newcomers in the South choose to settle
in central cities. Overwhelmingly, they opt for the suburbs,
integrating them as they move in and creating a strongly multiracial
middle class, according to William H. Frey, a demographer at the
University of Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   But as the South has surged, the Midwest has stagnated. Blacks in
the Rust Belt are falling further and further behind. In Milwaukee,
even African American families that could afford to move to the
suburbs often end up in downtrodden city neighborhoods -- sometimes
by choice and sometimes because they feel unwelcome anywhere else.
Less than 2% of the suburban population is black.</TE>
<TE>   The result: Black families earning more than $60,000 a year are
just as segregated as those earning less than $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   Upper-middle-income blacks live in neighborhoods where, on
average, one in five families falls below the poverty line. Whites
with similar incomes live in neighborhoods where just 4% of residents
are poor, according to Logan, who studies segregation at the
University of New York in Albany.</TE>
<TE>   The median value of a white-owned home in the Milwaukee
metropolitan area is $137,000. The median value of a black-owned home
is $58,400.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a problem with separate but equal. It's just that
this isn't equal," said Ruben Hopkins, 43, a financial analyst, who
is black.</TE>
<TE>   Parsing the statistics, it can be hard to untangle cause from
effect, hard to know whether to blame the segregation on poverty, or
the poverty on segregation. Demographer Roderick Harrison, who
studies these issues at Howard University in Washington, D.C.,
suspects that blame is due all around.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have these disparities" in income, education and
housing, "it feeds the stereotypes: Black people equal poverty,
crime, welfare -- all the things that whites moved out to the suburbs
to escape," Harrison said. "That increases white resistance and fear
to having even middle-class blacks move into the suburbs."</TE>
<TE>   And that increases segregation -- which in turn widens the gulf
between black and white, by keeping African Americans from better
schools and jobs in the suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty simple: America has had a racist strain for as long
as it has been a society, and Milwaukee, as a part of America, is
going to have that racist strain too," said John Gurda, a local
historian, who is white.</TE>
<TE>   Gurda points out, however, that the Milwaukee neighborhoods where
blacks tend to cluster are not stereotypical slums.</TE>
<TE>   The largely black north side features several suburban-style
developments -- ranch homes with wood decks and broad lawns, quite
similar to working-class subdivisions on the mostly white south side.</TE>
<TE>   The north side offers as well elegant Victorian houses painted
shades of sherbet, new single-family homes and tidy duplexes dating
from the 1920s. In Sherman Park, the most integrated north-side
neighborhood, graceful brick mansions sell for up to $300,000, a
fortune for urban Milwaukee. In the poorest, most dangerous
north-side neighborhoods, bullet scars pock the peeling paint on some
homes. Iron grates guard many windows -- when there are windows,
instead of stretched plastic. But there's virtually no graffiti and
very little trash. Vacant buildings are securely boarded up.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to aggressive city marketing efforts, Martin Luther King
Jr. Boulevard -- once a thriving black business district -- is
reviving from seedy disrepair, attracting young professionals of all
races to the funky Bean Head Cafe and the Ponderosa steakhouse.</TE>
<TE>   An ambitious school-choice program lets students attend class
anywhere in the city, or even in any suburb with open seats. Some
families deliberately choose schools on the opposite side of the city
to expose their children to diversity, making the elementary schools
more integrated here than in a dozen other cities.</TE>
<TE>   Yet racial tensions persist. The police chief, who is black, has
been engaged in a war of racially charged words with the mayor, who
is white. This fall, a white radio host proposed banning African
American kids from a suburban mall, after police had to break up a
crowd of black youths turned away from a sold-out movie.</TE>
<TE>   "Milwaukee still has a long way to go," Gurda said.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Norquist says he's committed to erasing the racial
inequities, and he points out that black household incomes rose much
faster than white incomes in the 1990s. But he insists that most of
the problems originate beyond the city's borders.</TE>
<TE>   He blames the suburbs -- all but two are at least 85% white -- for
failing to build low-cost housing, for failing to welcome minorities,
for failing to support a light-rail system that would ferry urban
workers to outlying jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In the suburb of Menomonee Falls, village president Joe Greco
responds that his community, although 97% white, has "done our part"
for diversity by offering affordable housing, including a trailer
park and modest ranch homes priced at about $120,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The housing is here. I don't know what more we can do," Greco
said. "We don't get into social engineering."</TE>
<TE>   Back in central Milwaukee, however, engineering has its appeal. A
new organization called Young Professionals of Milwaukee recently
gathered more than 300 men and women of all races to talk frankly
about their city's reputation. Each agreed to make at least one lunch
date a month with someone of a different background.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping lots of little conversations will add up to big
change," said one of the group's leaders, Jeff Sherman, who is white.
"That may be overly optimistic. But at least it's a start."</TE>

<HD>A Spirited Debate Over DUI Laws</HD>
<DH>The government's effort to compel states to lower
blood-alcohol limits encounters resistance. A senator in Iowa calls
the policy 'blackmail.'</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A high-pressure federal effort to toughen drunk driving laws across
the nation is meeting resistance in a third of the states, where many
politicians say the policy is counterproductive and misguided.</LD>
<LD>   Highway safety regulators in 1998 called on states to lower the
allowable blood-alcohol level for drivers to 0.08%, or risk losing
millions of dollars in federal highway grants.</LD>
<LD>   The majority of the states have conformed, but 17 states -- from
Minnesota to South Carolina and Nevada to Delaware -- have rejected
the approach and maintain laws that define drunk driving at 0.10%
blood-alcohol.</LD>
<TE>   Though no one defends drunk drivers or suggests abandoning the
campaign against them, the states say federal officials have not
shown that 0.08% laws save lives. Critics say the tougher laws weaken
the emphasis on catching hard-core drunks who cause the most deadly
crashes and saddle states with the costs of prosecuting tens of
thousands of additional violators.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there would be one person saved by a .08 law," said
Tom Rukavina, a Minnesota legislator representing the state's Iron
Range, a sparsely populated region west of Lake Superior. "All we
would have is more arrests. Almost every court case up here already
involves drunk driving."</TE>
<TE>   Rukavina estimates that a 0.08% law would result in 6,000
additional criminal arrests costing the state about $60 million,
outweighing the potential loss of federal highway funding. Nevada
legislators have voted down 0.08% laws repeatedly for similar
reasons, said Bernie Anderson, chairman of the state Assembly
Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The federal-state standoff reflects broader controversies about
the nation's campaign against drunk driving.</TE>
<TE>   Some safety experts express frustration that the campaign against
drunk driving has become such a politically powerful force that many
safety issues involving roads, car standards and driver behavior are
left in the shadows.</TE>
<TE>   They say the dimensions of the drunk driving problem also may be
misrepresented by complex government statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials reject the criticism, asserting that 0.08% laws
save lives and that the statistics showing that 40% of highway deaths
involve alcohol do not exaggerate the problem.</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of the holiday season, the airwaves are again filled
with warnings to motorists to avoid drinking and driving. An average
of 1,000 alcohol-related deaths occur between Christmas and New
Year's, the deadliest holiday period of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Runge, chief of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, launched a campaign this month to further step up
enforcement, citing the continuing threat posed by "1 billion
drinking and driving trips annually, which kill more than 45 people
every day."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody questions that the fight against drunk driving has resulted
in tremendous progress during the last half a century, saving by some
estimates 21,000 lives and radically changing the public mind-set
about alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   But progress in reducing drunk driving deaths has stalled in
recent years. Between 1993 and 2001, alcohol-related driving deaths
leveled out at about 17,000 a year despite many states adopting
tougher laws and stepped-up enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the most powerful advocacy group on
the issue and a driving force behind the federal government's push to
lower the legal blood-alcohol limit, says the nation risks losing the
battle and must pass even stricter laws, raise beer taxes and beef up
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials launched a holiday season campaign with the
motto: "You Drink &amp; Drive, You Lose." The advice for drivers is to
avoid all drinking.</TE>
<TE>   But many state officials and some accident experts worry that
other types of driver impairments may not be getting the same kind of
attention.</TE>
<TE>   "Theoretically, very small amounts of alcohol in your blood
impairs you, but so do antihistamines and lack of sleep," said Brian
O'Neill, president of the highly respected Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety.</TE>
<TE>   "We should focus on people who are seriously impaired at the kind
of levels that are illegal. That's one reason the problem is
overstated."</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for safer cars and improved roads support the drunk
driving effort, but say federal officials lack the same commitment to
preventing the nearly 24,700 highway deaths involving sober drivers
last year. That death toll has leaped 39% in the last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "There are other elements to highway safety than stopping drunk
drivers," said Bella Dinh-Zarr, director of traffic safety policy at
the American Automobile Assn. "We don't think [the campaign against
drunk driving] is a silver bullet."</TE>
<TE>   Added Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto
Safety, an organization that often butts heads with the auto industry
and government concerning vehicle safety standards: "It is a lot
easier and cheaper to blame the driver than to blame the vehicle or
the road design."</TE>
<TE>   The federal highway safety agency has made drunk driving its
priority, spending more than $300 million annually on the issue, more
than half its budget. Apart from the money, the issue occupies center
stage politically, a coveted position MADD fiercely defends.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want cell phones and drowsy driving to become the next
hot-button issue for the country, because they don't even compare
with the problem of drunk driving," MADD President Wendy Hamilton
said.</TE>
<TE>   One of MADD's most unlikely critics, however, is its founder,
Candace Lightner. She says MADD has turned into a
"neo-prohibitionist" organization that has lost its focus on safety.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the emphasis on .08 laws was not where the emphasis
should have been placed," she said. "The majority of crashes occur
with high blood-alcohol levels, the .15, .18 and .25 drinkers.
Lowering the blood-alcohol concentration was not a solution to the
alcohol problem."</TE>
<TE>   The toll of drunk driving is tabulated annually by the NHTSA; its
Fatality Analysis Reporting System compiles figures from accident
reports by police across the country.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the system reported that alcohol-involved crashes took
the lives of 17,448 people. That includes cases where there was
direct evidence of alcohol and others where no evidence of alcohol
was reported. Those cases are statistically estimated by a complex
mathematical model that uses variables such as driver age, time of
crash and gender. For example, if a young man hits a tree early in
the morning, the model would classify the crash as alcohol-related,
even without any evidence of alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   A breakdown of the 17,448 deaths in 2001 includes:</TE>
<TE>   * About 2,500 to 3,500 crash deaths in which no driver was legally
drunk but alcohol was detected.</TE>
<TE>   * 1,770 deaths involved drunk pedestrians killed when they walked
in front of sober drivers.</TE>
<TE>   * About 8,000 deaths involved only a single car and in most of
those cases the only death was the drunk driver.</TE>
<TE>   * That leaves about 5,000 sober victims killed by legally drunk
drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Those statistics are compiled largely through police reports that
sometimes provide an incomplete and equivocal historical record.</TE>
<TE>   Police sometimes blame alcohol with little or no evidence. For
example, when Alabama State Trooper Darrick Dorough investigated a
fatal crash last year in the town of Aliceville, he suspected that
the driver, Marvin B. Turnipseed, had been drinking. No alcohol test
was reported and the family would later allege in a lawsuit that a
defect caused their Ford Explorer to roll over.</TE>
<TE>   Now Dorough can't recall why he suspected drinking. "I don't think
drinking was the primary cause of the accident. It could have
contributed to it. That's a guess."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, NHTSA Administrator Runge says the agency's
statistics and its mathematical models to estimate drunk driving data
are scientifically valid and represent the actual risks of alcohol
consumption in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't overstate it at all," Runge said. "The question is, is
it a solvable problem? It is solvable."</TE>
<TE>   More than 1.5 million people in the U.S. will be stopped,
handcuffed and detained on drunk driving charges this year, putting
it near the top categories of criminal behavior. A heavy legal hammer
falls on the convicted, often including mandatory jail time, heavy
fines and large legal defense costs. A drunk driving arrest can cost
a motorist $10,000, as well as license suspension.</TE>
<TE>   While critics say that's well-deserved punishment, they are
concerned that merely arresting more drivers will not reduce highway
deaths.</TE>
<TE>   The federal push for lowering the blood-alcohol limit to 0.08% is
based on the assertion that it would save 500 lives per year
nationwide, according to the formal rule issued by the NHTSA. But
that estimate is highly controversial.</TE>
<TE>   A June 1999 report by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, found that NHTSA's death reduction
estimate was based on four studies that were flawed and failed to
"provide conclusive evidence that 0.08% ... laws by themselves have
resulted in reductions in drunk driving crashes and fatalities."</TE>
<TE>   The NHTSA estimate also seems squishy to some drunk driving
researchers.</TE>
<TE>   "You are not going to see a big statistical difference between .08
and .10 blood alcohol level," said Kurt M. Dubowski, a pioneer in
drunk driving medical research at Indiana University.</TE>
<TE>   "While we lower the standard, brakes are getting better, highways
are becoming safer, but congestion is growing. You can't peel those
factors apart."</TE>
<TE>   But the NHTSA's Runge argues strongly that impairment begins with
the first sip of alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it better to drive stone cold sober? Sure," he said. "Clearly,
by .08 virtually all of the population is too impaired to react to a
simple emergency."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Carra, director of the National Center for Statistics and
Analysis, the NHTSA office that compiles the data, contends that all
17,448 alcohol-related highway deaths in 2001 would have been
prevented if alcohol was removed from every driver.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA rests its case with studies such as those conducted by
Herbert Moskowitz, a medical doctor, who is president of the Southern
California Research Institute and regarded as a top alcohol
researcher.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question that with any level of alcohol you increase
the probability of a crash," Moskowitz said. "Most people don't
realize the effects of low blood-alcohol. You are not intoxicated.
You are not staggering."</TE>
<TE>   A Moskowitz study, funded by NHTSA in April 2000, noted that
activities requiring mental activity begin to degrade at below 0.05%
blood-alcohol levels. Specifically, low levels of alcohol impair the
ability to perform tasks that require divided attention, commonplace
in driving.</TE>
<TE>   But many accident investigators say it is often wrong to
automatically blame alcohol whenever it is present in a crash.</TE>
<TE>   "If you were to take away all that alcohol, would you take away
all those accidents?" asked Kerry M. Clark, a human factors accident
investigator in Southern California. "No. I can say that pretty
strongly.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate drunk drivers with a passion," he said, "but I have
reviewed many circumstances where accidents by drunk drivers involved
a reaction within the normal range of human response. In some cases,
people would still make mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Among the states that still have 0.10% laws, there are bitter
feelings about the federal government's pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Under NHTSA's rule, the states that refuse to lower the drunk
driving limit are losing portions of a six-year, $500-million
incentive grant program. Brad Hutto, a South Carolina senator, has
long opposed a lower legal limit and says he doubts his state will
change its law even with the loss of funds.</TE>
<TE>   "I call it blackmail," said Stewart Iverson, the Iowa Senate
majority leader. "Why is .08 the magic number? By lowering it to .08,
we are going to catch more of what I call the social drinkers. I had
two friends killed by drunk drivers, but we have to be realistic."</TE>
<TE>   And in Ohio, the anger is equally great.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is for drunk driving, but they are after the wrong end of
the stick," said Richard Finan, president of the Ohio Senate. "The
people who have had a few beers or a glass of wine are not the
problem. We call it prohibition drip by drip. It is prohibitionists
who want this. Their goal is zero tolerance."</TE>
<TE>   MADD President Hamilton said she has heard such criticism many
times before.</TE>
<TE>   "My family has seen a lot of sorrow because of drunk driving, but
it doesn't mean people should stop drinking. I am sitting here right
now with a beer," Hamilton said on the evening she was interviewed by
The Times.</TE>
<TE>   MADD and its allies say the legislators are influenced by the
alcohol and restaurant lobby. Legislators and their advocates deny
that allegation and say MADD's $50-million annual budget distorts the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   Although highway safety organizations endorse tough drunk driving
laws, they lament the government's lack of commitment on other
issues. Jackie Gillan, a vice president for Advocates for Highway &amp;
Auto Safety, notes that federal regulators have set a formal goal of
reducing drunk driving deaths to 11,000 a year by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "Why don't they have a goal for reducing rollover deaths, which is
increasing yearly and now exceeds 10,000 deaths a year," Gillan
asked. "Their solution to rollover is to get people to buckle up to
prevent death and injury. What about preventing the rollover from
occurring in the first place?"</TE>
<TE>   Roadway safety advocates say they are in the same boat.</TE>
<TE>   "It is easier to pass a law that raises the threshold on drunk
driving than it is to get rid of dead man's curve," said William Fay,
president of the Roadway Safety Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of politicians don't want to spend money on things that
don't have high visibility. But 15,000 deaths are caused every year
due to maintenance and design of roadways. Our roads are designed for
a fraction of the current traffic load."</TE>

<HD>Bills Can Build on This; Bengals Try to Recover</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>As the Buffalo Bills look forward to a promising future, the
Cincinnati Bengals face another offseason of uncertainty and
frustration.</LD>
<LD>   The bumbling Bengals, who haven't had a winning season in 12
years, ended 2002 with a 27-9 loss to the Bills on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Along with clinching the NFL's worst record and the right to the
No. 1 pick in next April's draft, the Bengals (2-14) set franchise
records for fewest wins and most losses in a season.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not any fun for any of us," Bengal Coach Dick LeBeau said.
"Life is about living. We aren't happy with what happened this year,
but we are looking forward to 2003 and getting things straightened
around."</TE>
<TE>   Whether LeBeau, whose record is 12-33 since taking over in 2000,
will be around to be part of the perennial rebuilding process is
unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Bengal owner Mike Brown is anticipated to make a decision on his
coaching staff as early as this week.</TE>
<TE>   It's a different story in Buffalo, where the Bills (8-8) made
significant strides in erasing the dreadful memories of last year's
3-13 finish.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Bledsoe had a good game to cap his first season in Buffalo.
He completed 23 of 31 passes for 231 yards with a touchdown and
scored on a seven-yard run.</TE>

<LD>   Florida Atlantic (4-7) at UC Irvine (5-3), 7:30, KUCI (88.9) --
The Anteaters can wrap up their nonconference portion of their
schedule in fine fashion with a victory tonight. Since opening the
season with losses to Oklahoma and Western Michigan, Irvine has won
five of six. Six players reached double figures in Saturday night's
win over Indiana Purdue Fort Wayne, including center Adam Parada and
forward Stanislav Zuzak. Both veterans have been inconsistent. Coach
Pat Douglass has changed his starting lineup often but said he likes
going with Jeff Gloger and Mike Efevberha at guard, Jordan Harris and
Matt Okoro at forward and Greg Ethington at center. The Owls made the
NCAA tournament last season but have found the going rough at the
start. Florida Atlantic is finishing a two-game West Coast swing
after losing at San Diego State on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Portland (5-5) at Long Beach State (1-7), 7:30 -- The 49ers
haven't played a game in 10 days, which may be the best news for a
team that has lost six in a row. The 49ers continue to struggle
adapting to the motion offense employed by first-year Coach Larry
Reynolds. They've shot under 40% in each of the last four games.
Junior Marcel Jackson is expected to get another start at center
while senior Vance Lawhorn nurses a groin pull. Freshman 7-foot
center Alex Graham has seen extended minutes lately. Portland, which
defeated Northern Arizona on a layup by Adam Quick in the final
seconds, has been streaky this season. The Pilots won their first
three, then lost their next five until rebounding with two
consecutive wins.</TE>

<LD>The New York Yankees lost to the Angels in the first round of the
American League playoffs last season, and guess who isn't happy about
it?</LD>
<LD>   George Steinbrenner, that's who.</LD>
<LD>   The Yankees' owner blamed four-time All-Star Derek Jeter's
declining production on the shortstop's numerous off-field activities
and said he's not quite ready to be the team's first captain since
Don Mattingly.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview with the New York Daily News printed Sunday,
Steinbrenner also said he is holding Manager Joe Torre and his
coaching staff accountable for the team's early playoff exit.</TE>
<TE>   Of Jeter, Steinbrenner said: "As far as trying and being a
warrior, I wouldn't put anyone ahead of him. But how much better
would he be if he didn't have all his other activities?</TE>
<TE>   "I tell him this all the time. I say, 'Jetes, you can't be
everything to everybody. You've got to focus on what's important.' I
want to see Jetes truly focused."</TE>
<TE>   As for Torre and his staff:</TE>
<TE>   "I just want his coaches to understand that just being a friend of
Joe Torre's is not enough. They've got to produce for him. Joe Torre
and his staff have heard the bugle.</TE>
<TE>   "Joe is the greatest friend I've ever had as a manager.... I don't
want to destroy that, but I will tell you this: I want his whole
staff to understand that they have got to do better this year."</TE>
<TE>   More from George: Steinbrenner also believes baseball, and
Commissioner Bud Selig, targeted his team in the new collective
bargaining agreement, which features a luxury tax on high-payroll
teams -- such as the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a Bud Selig man. I consider him a good friend," Steinbrenner
said, before adding: "But while I'm loyal to Bud Selig, the biggest
beneficiaries in this whole plan are the Milwaukee Brewers.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't seem quite right. I don't know how he sleeps at
night sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the Pacific 10 Conference bowl record for
the longest run from scrimmage?</TE>
<TE>   Irish wake: Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post commenting on
Carson Palmer's performance against Notre Dame: "He completed 32 of
46 passes for 425 yards and four touchdowns. The last time Notre Dame
got its bell rung like that was by the Hunchback."</TE>
<TE>   Comedy team? Thomas Boswell of the Washington Post writes that
Redskin Coach Steve Spurrier has flipped-flopped his quarterbacks so
many times, "they might as well have Larry, Moe and Curly on their
jerseys."</TE>
<TE>   Shrinking man: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle on the
Golden State Warriors' signing of diminutive Earl Boykins:</TE>
<TE>   "They'd better utilize him fast. Boykins was listed as 5 feet 8 in
high school, 5-7 in college and now he's 5-5. If the trend continues,
bobblehead dolls will be posting this guy up."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Dwight Ford of USC, 94 yards against Texas A&amp;M in
the 1977 Bluebonnet Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Frank Fitzpatrick of the Philadelphia Inquirer, on
Cincinnati conducting a raffle in which the winners pushed the button
to implode Cinergy Field: "One suspects the contest would attract
considerably more attention if the Bengals' offices were still
there."</TE>

<KH>TAMPA BAY 15, CHICAGO 0</KH>
<HD>Gramatica Gets No Cold Feet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHAMPAIGN, Ill.</DL>
<LD>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers get a mighty nice reward for finally winning
a game in cold weather: A first-round bye, and a week to recuperate
in the Florida sun.</LD>
<LD>   With their playoff fate in their hands and the game-time
temperature at 34 degrees Sunday night, the Buccaneers hounded the
short-handed Chicago Bears incessantly, setting up all but one of
Martin Gramatica's five field goals on the way to a 15-0 victory.</LD>
<LD>   The Buccaneers secured the No. 2 seeding in the NFC with their
franchise-best 12th victory, giving them a bye next weekend and a
home game in the second round.</LD>
<TE>   "How about that? That's really something," Coach Jon Gruden said.
"A milestone tonight, winning 12 games, first time we've been able to
do that. We made sure the thermometer was accurate and we
accomplished something tonight. Hopefully, we can put some of those
streaks to end and maybe start some new cold-weather streaks."</TE>
<TE>   The warm-blooded Buccaneers had a long record of ineptness in the
cold, losing 21 in a row when the temperature was 40 degrees or
below. But they could have passed for penguins Sunday, with the
temperature dipping into the low 30s as the night went on and the
southeast wind making it feel even chillier.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a 30-year Florida boy. I hate this stuff," tackle Warren Sapp
said. "It'll always be brought up, but at least we got it off our
resume."</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers (12-4) had already locked up the NFC South title.
But after losing last Monday night to Pittsburgh, they needed help
from the New York Jets to get the first-round bye.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets did their part with a 42-17 victory over the Green Bay
Packers about two hours before the Buccaneers and Bears (4-12) kicked
off. The Buccaneers were well aware of the outcome of that game --
the end played on the scoreboard at Memorial Stadium -- and took the
field knowing their fate was in their hands.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation we let get away from us Monday was put right back
into our laps. You can't ask for anything better than that," Sapp
said. "We had the table set for us with a nine-course meal. All we
had to do was sit down and eat. We ate."</TE>
<TE>   Feasted is more like it. Tampa Bay's offense was hardly
impressive, with Rob Johnson getting sacked five times -- four times
in the first half -- and mustering only 134 yards passing.</TE>
<TE>   But the defense more than made up for the offense, abusing Bear
third-string quarterback Henry Burris, who was making his first NFL
start because of injuries to Chris Chandler and Jim Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay intercepted Burris four times, setting up four of
Gramatica's field goals.</TE>
<TE>   Just how ferocious were the Buccaneers? Chicago's first five plays
in the fourth quarter were passes, and Tampa Bay picked off three of
them. Burris completed only seven of 19 for 78 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers lead the league with 31 interceptions, and extended
their streak of games with at least one takeaway to 41. It was the
second shutout this season for the league's stingiest defense, which
has given up only 196 points.</TE>

<HD>Redick Has Hot Hand for Duke</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Duke freshman J.J. Redick can no longer say he hasn't had a hot
streak this season.</LD>
<LD>   Redick made his last eight shots Sunday night and scored a
career-high 26 points to lead the No. 3-ranked Blue Devils over
Dayton, 85-74, at Durham, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   The Blue Devils are off to their third consecutive 7-0 start. They
improved to 162-8 against nonconference teams at Cameron Indoor
Stadium under Coach Mike Krzyzewski. The Blue Devils are 127-23 in
December under Krzyzewski.</LD>
<TE>   Dahntay Jones had 15 points, Casey Sanders had 13 and Chris Duhon
came up with two big defensive plays late for the Blue Devils, who
jumped to a big lead and held off a rally by the Flyers (7-3).</TE>
<TE>   Redick, who had been shooting 38% from three-point range, made
five of seven three-point shots and five of six free throws.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Devils hadn't played since defeating North Carolina A&amp;T,
91-57, at Greensboro on Dec. 17, but they showed few signs of rust
early, taking a 10-1 lead that would not dip below six points the
rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Dayton, a veteran club that started a senior, three juniors and a
sophomore, committed only three turnovers in the second half after
having 11 in the first half, but the Flyers never were able to
overtake the young Blue Devils.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt they would be as veteran a team as we could play,"
Krzyzewski said. "And then after a 12-day break, I knew it would be a
difficult situation for our guys. And I thought they responded well."</TE>
<TE>   Duke won for the fifth time in six games against Dayton, but it
was the first meeting between the schools since 1971. The Flyers won
the first meeting, 71-63, in December 1959.</TE>
<TE>   No. 18 Creighton 93, Southeast Missouri State 70 -- Kyle Korver
scored 22 points to lift Creighton at Omaha, Neb.</TE>
<TE>   The Bluejays improved to 10-0, the best record in Division I this
season and the program's best start since the 1942-43 team opened
16-0, a school record.</TE>
<TE>   Creighton's pressing defense forced 17 turnovers. The Bluejays
outscored the Indians, 17-0, off turnovers in the first half and 30-4
total.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Scheer led the Indians (5-6) with 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   No. 23 Maryland 84, Georgia Tech 77 -- Drew Nicholas scored a
career-high 29 points at College Park, Md., and the Terrapins opened
defense of their Atlantic Coast Conference title.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Randle scored 16 of his 20 points in the second half for
Maryland (6-3, 1-0), which earned its ninth consecutive home victory
over the Yellow Jackets.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland, which captured the ACC regular-season title last season
on the way to its first national championship, has won a
school-record 13 consecutive conference games.</TE>
<TE>   B.J. Elder had 19 points and Chris Bosh had 16 for the Yellow
Jackets (5-4, 0-1), who have lost 12 of 14 to Maryland since January
1996.</TE>

<KH>DENVER 37, ARIZONA 7</KH>
<HD>Portis Runs Over Hapless Cardinals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Denver's season was all but over before the Broncos even took the
field. Rookie Clinton Portis proved he's only getting started.</LD>
<LD>   Portis secured his spot as the latest in a long line of superb
Denver rookie backs, running for a career-high 228 yards and two
touchdowns as the Broncos defeated the Arizona Cardinals, 37-7, on
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Following the tradition of Terrell Davis, Olandis Gary and Mike
Anderson, Portis set team rookie records with 1,508 yards and 17
touchdowns.</LD>
<TE>   He finished with seven 100-yard games, had the fifth-highest
rushing total by a rookie in league history and has a good chance to
become Denver's second offensive rookie of the year in three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked like Terrell Davis," Denver defensive end Trevor Pryce
said. "That's the biggest compliment you can give a running back."</TE>
<TE>   The Broncos (9-7) started the game knowing they were already out
of the postseason, but it didn't stop Portis from getting his first
200-yard game.</TE>
<TE>   Portis had 120 yards in eight carries by halftime and scored on a
four-yard run off left tackle to put the Broncos ahead, 30-7, midway
through the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   He added a 12-yard touchdown run late, taking off around right end
and dancing his way through the middle before working his way back to
the left side of the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad for someone who didn't become the starter until the fifth
game.</TE>
<TE>   "You look back and think that things happen for a reason," Portis
said. "What if I would have actually played in those games?"</TE>
<TE>   For one, the Broncos might have secured a playoff spot early
instead of watching the scoreboard before their last game.</TE>
<TE>   Denver's postseason hopes hinged on Atlanta beating Cleveland
earlier in the day, but the Falcons lost, 24-16.</TE>
<TE>   Denver Coach Mike Shanahan gave his team the news just before
kickoff, and the Broncos responded with 450 total yards.</TE>
<TE>   It couldn't mask the disappointment of what many players felt was
a wasted season.</TE>
<TE>   Denver lost five of eight after a 6-2 start to miss the playoffs
for the third time in four years since winning consecutive Super
Bowls.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is going to make any excuses," said Steve Beuerlein, who
started in place of Brian Griese. "We know we blew it and the
disappointment was evident."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona (5-11) lost nine of 10 after a 4-2 start. The
injury-plagued Cardinals lost at least 11 games for the eighth time
in their 15 seasons in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "You found out that these guys will fight, but at the same time
we've got to get better in some areas," said Arizona Coach Dave
McGinnis, who had 13 players out for the season.</TE>

<LD>The Clippers can't seem to make a basket when it counts and can't win
consistently on their home court. In fact, the reason the Clippers
aren't better at Staples Center has a great deal to do with their
poor outside shooting at crunch time.</LD>
<LD>   Their twin shortcomings were on full display during their latest
home loss on Saturday against the Golden State Warriors. The
Clippers' 29-for-75 shooting (38.7%), including three for 13 from
behind the three-point arc (23.1%), sent them reeling toward their
10th defeat in 17 home games this season.</LD>
<LD>   One night earlier, they made 38 of 84 shots (45.2%), but only two
of 18 three-pointers (11.1%) during a loss against the Suns at
Phoenix.</LD>
<TE>   The Warriors and Suns, knowing the Clippers' top perimeter shooter
Eric Piatkowski is on the injured list because of an abdominal
strain, played zone defense for a good chunk of each game. Both teams
were well aware that the Clippers' best chance for a victory was to
pound the ball inside to power forward Elton Brand and center Michael
Olowokandi.</TE>
<TE>   Facing steady double- and triple-teaming from the Warriors, in
particular, Brand and Olowokandi were neutralized. When the Clippers
failed to click from the perimeter late in the game, the Warriors
escaped with a 99-92 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to be able to pass the ball out of the post against the
double team," Coach Alvin Gentry said. "We've got to make our
perimeter shots. We've got to throw into the post, throw it back out
and swing it around, then step up and make shots."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have been outshooting opponents by 44% to 43% this
season, but lose their touch during pivotal stretches.</TE>
<TE>   "Games are going to be close," Gentry said. "Teams are going to
make runs. You've got to make shots. You can't go four for 15 in the
fourth quarter like we did against Portland [Dec. 18] and expect to
win. We have to be able to come through [in critical spots]. You
learn to win. It's a process and every team goes through it.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a situation where we had the ball right at the basket
and couldn't get it in. NBA games come down to the last 6 1/2
minutes, when you've got to make shots and free throws. It doesn't
matter if you're an 80% free throw shooter if you don't make them in
those situations."</TE>

<KH>WASHINGTON 20, DALLAS 14</KH>
<HD>Redskins End Skid Against Cowboys</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LANDOVER, Md.</DL>
<LD>Nobody seemed happy Sunday as Dallas and Washington finished
disappointing seasons.</LD>
<LD>   In the Washington locker room, Steve Spurrier gave the game ball
to Dan Snyder. But Spurrier wasn't happy about a messy victory over a
bad team, and the owner got a souvenir to remind him of his first
losing season.</LD>
<LD>   In the Dallas locker room, Dave Campo talked about the game as if
it were any other, even as owner Jerry Jones said a decision was
coming "immediately" about the coach's future.</LD>
<TE>   In a nine-turnover game with many sideshows, the Redskins (7-9)
ended a losing streak at 10 to their fiercest rival. LaVar Arrington
scored one touchdown and set up another with two fumble recoveries in
a 20-14 victory over the Cowboys.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously their coach is probably going to be canned tomorrow,"
Spurrier said. "He knows it, and so it's hard to get his team really
riled up to play. We had a chance to beat them pretty good, but we
allowed them to stay in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard for me to get excited. I know they've beaten us a lot,
so don't get me wrong. They're still a 5-11 team three years in a
row. Sometimes we maybe give Dallas too much credit, you know what I
mean?"</TE>
<TE>   It was Washington's first victory over Dallas since Oct. 13, 1997,
and it came amid a farewell party for retiring cornerback Darrell
Green and tenuous futures in Dallas for Campo and running back Emmitt
Smith. Snyder got his first victory over the Cowboys since buying the
Redskins in 1999. Spurrier had promised to give Snyder the game ball
whenever the Redskins broke the losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, 33, could be on his way out of Dallas because of salary cap
issues. If so, the league's all-time leading rusher went out
sputtering, gaining a season-low 13 yards in 18 carries. He finished
with 975 yards for the season, failing to reach 1,000 for the first
time since his rookie year.</TE>
<TE>   Green, 42, said goodbye after 20 seasons with the Redskins. The
cornerback cried during a pregame ceremony.</TE>

<DH>Doba is ready to assume control of Cougars after the Rose
Bowl</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howie Stalwick</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>PULLMAN, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Bill Doba has heard all the negatives about Pullman.</LD>
<LD>   Too small. Too isolated. Too backward. Too ... Pullman.</LD>
<LD>   Why, people ask, would a Pacific 10 Conference football recruit
choose to play for a school in Pullman rather than, say, one in Los
Angeles? Or Seattle? Or the Bay Area? Or Arizona?</LD>
<TE>   Doba, bless his heart, doesn't even have to lie -- and yes,
college football coaches do sometimes lie when recruiting teenagers
whose exploits get coaches hired and fired -- when extolling the
virtues of wheat-engulfed Pullman.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no better place to live than Pullman, Washington,"
insists Washington State's new head coach and longtime assistant.</TE>
<TE>   "Where else can you go to the grocery store, the post office and
fill up your car with gas in half an hour?"</TE>
<TE>   Uh ... Mayberry?</TE>
<TE>   Go ahead, Doba says. Make the snide remarks. Tell the same tired
jokes year after year. Rip away to your heart's content.</TE>
<TE>   All Doba knows is that he just landed his dream job at the school
he loves in the city he cherishes. Oh, and one more thing: The next
time you want to hurl your venom at Pullman and Washington State,
Doba suggests, why not save it for Wednesday? That's when the Cougars
will be playing in the Rose Bowl for the second time since 1998, and
virtually every college player, coach and fan in the country will be
watching in envy.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Coach Doba," All-American defensive tackle Rien Long said.
"He's the one who got me here. He's the one who made me fall in love
with this place."</TE>
<TE>   "You'd be hard-pressed," Cougar Athletic Director Jim Sterk said,
"to find anyone that could have anything but great things to say
about Bill Doba."</TE>
<TE>   It is the ultimate sign of the respect held for Doba that nary a
negative remark has been heard in the wake of his hiring, even
though, at the not-so-tender age of 62, he has become a college head
coach for the first time. He has zero experience in one regard, but a
rather lengthy lifetime of experiences to draw from in virtually
every other regard.</TE>
<TE>   "He's old enough to have some wisdom, and he's just about ready to
enter the prime of his life," Washington State President Lane Rawlins
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel so great about Bill getting the job," Mike Price said of
his close friend, neighbor and hand-picked successor. "He's just a
great guy. He deserves it."</TE>
<TE>   Doba, the last holdover from Price's original staff of 1989, had
been defensive coordinator since 1994. Price pushed hard for Doba
when head-coaching jobs opened in previous years. Two of those were
in Doba's native state, Indiana, and one of the schools, Ball State,
is Doba's alma mater. Doba never got a sniff, though, and finally
gave up hope of ever becoming a college head coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I said last year, I can go to my grave and not feel I missed
anything by not being a head coach," Doba said. "But I think it is
every coach's dream."</TE>
<TE>   Doba lacks Price's buoyant personality, but is known for his dry
wit.</TE>
<TE>   How will he gauge his success?</TE>
<TE>   "I imagine by reading the newspaper."</TE>
<TE>   Will it be difficult replacing Price?</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, if you've been to our practices, Mike stands and
watches."</TE>
<TE>   Now that you'll be making more public appearances, will you scan
the Internet to find a few jokes to tell?</TE>
<TE>   "You've gotta teach me how to turn on that computer."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a great public speaker," Doba said, perhaps
underestimating himself. "I'm not a one-liner and joke teller and all
that stuff. I've got to get better at that.</TE>
<TE>   "But," he summed up, "I think the main thing is winning."</TE>
<TE>   Born and raised in South Bend, Ind., Doba might be the only
Catholic football player in South Bend history who did not dream of
playing in his hometown for Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "If you live in South Bend, Notre Dame just gets stuffed down your
throat so much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Doba headed a few hours south to Muncie for college. He played
football at Ball State.</TE>
<TE>   Doba spent three years as a high school assistant coach and 12
years as a high school head coach -- all in Indiana -- before landing
his first college job in 1977, coaching the outside linebackers at
Indiana for current ESPN analyst Lee Corso. After Corso's staff was
fired, Doba found work at Purdue and The Citadel before coming to
Washington State on the recommendation of then-Cougar assistant Joe
Tiller, now coach at Purdue.</TE>
<TE>   What followed has been the most glorious period in the
oft-nightmarish history of Cougar football. The Cougars have won a
school-record 10 games three times in the last six seasons, including
the last two, and Doba says a healthy core of returning players and
incoming talent bodes well for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "He will continue a winning tradition," Rawlins said. "I never
thought I'd say that about Cougar football."</TE>

<KH>NEW ENGLAND 27, MIAMI 24 (OT)</KH>
<HD>Disappointment All Around</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FOXBORO, Mass.</DL>
<LD>The Patriots leaped for joy, the Dolphins hung their heads -- and
then both waited to see if they'd make the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Three hours later, both teams were disappointed.</LD>
<LD>   The hope New England got from its amazing comeback for a 27-24
overtime win Sunday over Miami ended when the New York Jets beat the
Green Bay Packers, 42-17.</LD>
<TE>   That gave the Jets the AFC East title and eliminated the Super
Bowl champion Patriots and the Dolphins. All were 9-7.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very disappointed," New England Coach Bill Belichick said
in a statement released by the team. "Unfortunately, it was a
situation where other things had to fall into place for us to get
into the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins were less than two minutes from winning the AFC East,
leading, 24-21. But they missed the playoffs for the first time in
seven seasons after blowing a 24-13 lead in the final five minutes.
That enabled Adam Vinatieri to kick a 35-yard field goal 2:03 into
overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "This team does not have a killer instinct," Miami linebacker Zach
Thomas said. "You can say all you want about how we should have won,
but I'm sick and tired of hearing how good we are. We can't win a big
game."</TE>
<TE>   After battling each other for more than 60 minutes, the Patriots
and Dolphins rooted for the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   They'd both be in the playoffs with a Jets loss, one as a
wild-card. Instead, Cleveland, also 9-7, got the wild-card spot.</TE>
<TE>   For the fourth consecutive season, neither team that went to the
previous Super Bowl will return. The Patriots beat St. Louis, 20-17,
in last season's Super Bowl on Vinatieri's 48-yard field goal on the
final play.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, his 43-yard field goal tied the score with 1:09 left in
the fourth quarter before he won it.</TE>
<TE>   "We might be causing lots of gray hairs out there, myself
included, but it's a lot of fun," Vinatieri said.</TE>
<TE>   His joy was short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots needed a win and a Jet loss or tie to win the
division but lost their third straight game. Had they beaten the Jets
a week earlier and then the Dolphins, they would have won the
division.</TE>
<TE>   The dramatic finish overshadowed another outstanding day by
Miami's Ricky Williams, who ran for 185 yards and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   He ended the season with a league-leading 1,853 yards rushing.
That's the eighth-best rushing season in NFL history, one yard more
than Walter Payton had in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   "Championships are rare, playoffs are rare, and you need to take
advantage of the opportunities," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots won with a comeback reminiscent of last season's
unexpected title run by a team that was 5-11 the previous year. On
Saturday, Belichick tried to motivate his players by showing them the
Super Bowl trophy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is ours, and his point was, 'I'm not ready to give it away,'
" quarterback Tom Brady said. "And when that really sinks in, I'm not
ready to give it away either."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots fell behind, 24-13, with 4:59 left in the fourth
quarter when Olindo Mare made a 28-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Miami mistakes set up the Patriots' next three scores.</TE>
<TE>   New England made it 24-21 on Brady's three-yard pass to Troy Brown
-- helped by a pass interference call -- and a two-point conversion
pass to Christian Fauria with 2:46 left.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots kicked off deep rather than try an onside kick, then
forced a punt by Mark Royals, which went only 23 yards. Taking over
at Miami's 34-yard line, they moved close enough for Vinatieri's
43-yarder.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the best kicker in the league, so if you want anybody in the
league kicking, it's him," Belichick said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Patriots' playoff opener last season, Vinatieri kicked a
45-yard field goal on the final play of the fourth quarter, then made
a 23-yarder in overtime through driving snow to beat Oakland.</TE>

<HD>Sykora Misses His Chance</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CALGARY, Canada</DL>
<LD>Petr Sykora was in a position to give the Mighty Ducks a two-goal
lead in the first period Sunday, and possibly break the backs of the
struggling Calgary Flames.</LD>
<LD>   Sykora had a chance to score his second goal of the game after
Calgary defenseman Bob Boughner was called for covering up the puck
in the goalie crease. Sykora never seemed to have control of the puck
as he charged toward goalie Roman Turek on the penalty shot. The puck
slipped off Sykora's stick as he went to his backhand to shoot.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought I had him," Sykora said. "It's a one-on-one battle and
he won.</LD>
<TE>   "I know he's a right-handed goalie and it's tough to get the
blocker up. So I tired to go backhand. He played me very well. I
guess he gets the credit."</TE>
<TE>   Sykora scored on the only other penalty shot of his career on Jan.
6, 2000, against Buffalo when he was playing for New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' Patric Kjellberg scored his second goal in as many
games, which tied the score 2-2 in the second period Sunday. Jason
Krog dug the puck from behind the net and centered it to Kjellberg,
whose first shot was stopped. He then put back the rebound.</TE>
<TE>   However, the two-game streak means little to Kjellberg, who has
five goals this season. "You want your goals to mean something,"
Kjellberg said. "I'd rather not scored and we won both games."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duck Defenseman Fredrik Olausson was a healthy scratch for the
second consecutive game.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Let Another One Slip Away</HD>
<DH>Two mistakes on defense lead to Calgary goals and a 4-2
loss as Anaheim fails to win for the third consecutive outing since
Christmas.</DH>

<DL>CALGARY, Canada</DL>
<LD>Sifting through the rubble of another loss, there were moments --
painful ones -- that the Mighty Ducks could point to that sealed
their fate.</LD>
<LD>   Defenseman Niclas Havelid makes a weak effort to clear the puck.</LD>
<LD>   Defenseman Ruslan Salei falls down.</LD>
<TE>   Two mistakes. Two third-period goals allowed.</TE>
<TE>   Those were the easy snapshots to produce Sunday after a 4-2 loss
to the Calgary Flames, the last-place team in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   The 16,922 at the Pengrowth Saddledome saw the Flames win at home
for only the third time this season, a nice present for new Coach
Darryl Sutter, gift-wrapped by the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   The wide-screen version of the Ducks' recent tumble has been in
production for a week.</TE>
<TE>   In that time they have gone from starring as the hottest team in
the NHL, to playing their usual supporting role by handing out two
points at every stop.</TE>
<TE>   This was their third game in four nights and their third
consecutive loss, which gave first-year Coach Mike Babcock cause for
concern.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is, we had three days off [for Christmas] and we've
played three games in four nights," Babcock said. "So the zip in our
game wasn't there [tonight].</TE>
<TE>   "Structurally we were fine tonight. What was evident was this was
our third game since Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   As structures go, this one needs some retrofitting.</TE>
<TE>   This was the Ducks' third game in four nights, but it was the
first time they failed to pick up at least two points in that
situation.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is, we didn't get points in three games," Babcock
said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're in this conference and in [the Pacific Division],
that's an emergency."</TE>
<TE>   That left the aura of concern in the air.</TE>
<TE>   "A team could be in a playoff spot, but in two weeks, if they
don't keep playing well, they could be out of it," Petr Sykora said.
"That's exactly where we are right now. We have to stop this or it is
going to be very tough to come back."</TE>
<TE>   Through two periods, the Ducks held their own and were sitting in
a 2-2 tie. The Flames controlled the entire third period, but still
needed the game handed to them.</TE>
<TE>   First, Havelid tried to clear a puck high and out of the Duck
zone, only to have Calgary's Chris Clark bat it down. Oleg Saprykin
pounced on it and fired a shot that goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere
stopped.</TE>
<TE>   But Saprykin put his rebound into the net for a 3-2 lead at 11
minutes 32 seconds into the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Salei later tripped and fell while chasing the puck in the Duck
zone. Blake Sloan got to the puck, lost it, then retrieved it and
centered a pass to a charging Stephane Yelle. His goal put the game
away at 14:26.</TE>
<TE>   "It was 2-2 going into the third and we're in a good position
there," team captain Paul Kariya said. "We gave them the game ...</TE>
<TE>   "The first game after Christmas, we just weren't ready to play and
it has kind of snowballed. We got to turn this thing around quick.
This was the best game we played since we came back and it certainly
wasn't good enough."</TE>
<TE>   Things started well. McDonald made a slick centering pass to
Sykora, who chipped in a shot for a 1-0 lead midway through the first
period.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary's Martin Gelinas redirected a Jerome Iginla shot to tie
the score four minutes into the second period. Chris Drury lined up a
shot and buried it for a 2-1 lead two minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' Patric Kjellberg knocked in his own rebound to tie the
score 17 minutes into the second period.</TE>
<TE>   The stage was set. The Ducks took the prat fall.</TE>
<TE>   Said Babcock: "The reality is, we're leaving here without a win."</TE>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>And the winner is ... ?</LD>
<LD>   Willis McGahee and Ken Dorsey heard those words often on this
month's rubber-chicken award show circuit, yet not once did the
sentence end with one of their names.</LD>
<LD>   Interesting.</LD>
<TE>   Here were the top two players on the nation's top team, Miami, yet
every time a guy in a tuxedo cracked open an envelope some player
from a school that has not won 34 consecutive games stood to collect
a prize.</TE>
<TE>   Doak Walker Award, given to the top running back: And the winner
is ... Penn State's Larry Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Davey O'Brien, awarded to the nation's top quarterback: And the
winner is ... Iowa's Brad Banks.</TE>
<TE>   Maxwell Award: And the winner is ... Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Camp Award: And the winner is ... Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Unitas Award: And the winner is ... USC quarterback Carson
Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   Then, of course, there was the Dec. 14 presentation of the 68th
Heisman Trophy, McGahee and Dorsey once again squirming in seats.</TE>
<TE>   And the winner was?</TE>
<TE>   Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   McGahee, a sophomore tailback who had more impact on opposing
defenses than any player in the country, finished a distant fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey, a senior who is 38-1 as a starting quarterback, ended up
fifth, two spots worse than his 2001 Heisman finish even though the
threw for more yards and touchdown passes in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey and McGahee, combined, did not get as many votes as Palmer
amassed.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing personal ... or was it?</TE>
<TE>   What had those award winners done on the field that McGahee and
Dorsey had not?</TE>
<TE>   For one, every hardware-taker not named McGahee or Dorsey played
for a school that lost at least one game in 2002. Banks lost one,
Palmer lost two, and Johnson's three-trophy haul matched the number
of Penn State defeats.</TE>
<TE>   Miami went 12-0 but nearly 0-for-the-trophy case, the exception
being center Bret Romberg winning something called the Rimington
Award.</TE>
<TE>   Nation's best shaver?</TE>
<TE>   No, nation's best center.</TE>
<TE>   "I was probably upset more than any of the players," Miami Coach
Larry Coker said of the McGahee-Dorsey snubs. "As their coach I want
to see them win every award and every game. I'm over it now and I
think they're over it now."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   At Sunday's first Fiesta Bowl news conference, McGahee suggested
people out there don't want Miami players to win awards or the
Hurricanes to extend their remarkable winning streak to 35 in
Friday's national title game against Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   Call it Miami fatigue, born of clothes worn by the ghost of Fiesta
Bowls (1987) past.</TE>
<TE>   "Not too many people out there like Miami, so we didn't get as
many votes as everyone else did," McGahee said bluntly. "I think it
goes way back to the days when they got off the plane with [military]
fatigues on, but I really don't know."</TE>
<TE>   So, if we've got this story straight, writers with an ax to grind
purposely stuck it to Miami players at award time.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the impression I got," McGahee said.</TE>
<TE>   As for Dorsey, it got to the point this year where he could no
longer stand the criticisms of him -- average arm strength, product
of a great system, you know, another Gino Torretta.</TE>
<TE>   Romberg, Dorsey's roommate, said the senior quarterback was quick
with the television remote control whenever discussion turned to him.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd be watching and he'd flip the channel," Romberg said. "He
wouldn't want to hear it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   You sense Dorsey would like to lash out and name names but is
smart enough not to make it an issue six days before Friday's
national title game.</TE>
<TE>   With typical poise in the pocket, Dorsey speaks in measured tones
about alleged slights against him.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned a lot this year in terms of how to handle myself,"
Dorsey said Sunday, "in terms of criticism and people not always
having a positive opinion of me."</TE>
<TE>   The reality?</TE>
<TE>   It's ludicrous to believe there was an orchestrated plot to
deprive Dorsey and McGahee of their just rewards.</TE>
<TE>   The reality is Dorsey and McGahee had the misfortune, if you can
possibly call it that, of playing on the same team. Their
achievements were tempered by each other and their Heisman votes, in
essence, canceled out.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey had a terrific season, throwing for 3,073 yards and 26
touchdowns, but not quite as terrific as seasons posted by USC's
Palmer or Iowa's Banks.</TE>
<TE>   McGahee rushed for 1,686 yards and 27 touchdowns, yet Penn State's
Johnson rushed for more than 2,000.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey might have thrown for more yards without McGahee, and
McGahee might have rushed for more yards without Dorsey, yet together
they have formed a so-far unbeatable combination.</TE>
<TE>   McGahee also was up against history, as no sophomore has won the
Heisman.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't really think I was going to win it," McGahee said,
"because it was my first year and I really didn't do too much to run
up my stats like everybody else did. I was just happy to be there. I
was expecting Dorsey to get a little bit more credit than what he
got."</TE>
<TE>   Any way you look at the Miami situation can not be good for Ohio
State.</TE>
<TE>   Miami, on the threshold of becoming the next college football
dynasty, is continually looking for ways to motivate itself. The
Hurricanes tend to play their best when challenged or provoked.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the empire looked ready to crumble during a
three-game stretch against Florida State, West Virginia and Rutgers.
The Hurricane defense was giving up rushing yards by the chunk and
the winning streak appeared in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on Nov. 9, right on cue, Miami traveled to Knoxville and
crushed Tennessee, 26-3.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when Miami seeks to become the first team since Nebraska
in 1994-95 to repeat as national champion, Hurricane players are
looking for any motivational hook to keep their edge.</TE>
<TE>   It seems odd that a school on a 34-game winning streak would think
it has something to prove, but that appears to be Miami's pitch.</TE>
<TE>   As for all those other players not named Dorsey or McGahee who
took home trophies this month?</TE>
<TE>   "We're the only two that's going to play for the national
championship," McGahee said. "So that's something they can't take
away from us."</TE>
<TE>   And the winner is ... ?</TE>
<TE>   We'll find out Friday.</TE>

<KH>CLEVELAND 24, ATLANTA 16</KH>
<HD>Wait Is Worth It for Browns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>They won and waited. And then, the Cleveland Browns were forced to
wait some more before they could celebrate.</LD>
<LD>   After taking nearly every game this season down to the final
excruciating seconds, the Browns -- and their playoff chances -- had
to survive three hours of sudden death.</LD>
<LD>   Could there be any other way?</LD>
<TE>   Rookie William Green ran for 178 yards and had a 64-yard touchdown
run with 3:53 to play Sunday, giving the Browns a 24-16 win over the
Atlanta Falcons.</TE>
<TE>   However, Cleveland's first playoff berth since 1994 wasn't secured
until hours later, when the New York Jets beat Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just how our season has been," said wide receiver Quincy
Morgan. "Everything hanging from a thread."</TE>
<TE>   The Browns went from an expansion team to the playoffs in only
four years. The original franchise moved to Baltimore and became the
Ravens in 1996, and Cleveland was awarded an expansion team in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Also appropriate for this crazy season, the Falcons lost and made
it back to the playoffs anyway. Atlanta (9-6-1) backed into the NFC
playoffs as a wild card when New Orleans lost at home to Carolina.
"I'm really, really, really down," Atlanta tight end Alge Crumpler
said. "I feel like we backed into these playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Brown linebacker Earl Holmes stopped Warrick Dunn at the one-yard
line on fourth and goal with 23 seconds left, and the Browns (9-7)
ran out the clock for their biggest win since returning to the
league.</TE>
<TE>   They did it without quarterback Tim Couch, who broke his right leg
in the first half, and won another gut-wrenching game despite
committing four turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "This game was a microcosm of the whole season," Brown Coach Butch
Davis said. "What can you say?"</TE>
<TE>   When the final seconds ticked off, the Browns -- led by linebacker
Dwayne Rudd, whose impulsive helmet toss in Week 1 cost Cleveland a
win -- ran to midfield and danced in celebration on the Browns'
orange helmet logo as 73,528 fans rocked Browns Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a roller coaster of a season, and the ride hasn't
stopped," said quarterback Kelly Holcomb, who replaced Couch.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland's players went to the locker room having done all they
could, but they had to wait for the final score from New England,
where the Miami Dolphins and Patriots went to overtime.</TE>
<TE>   When Adam Vinatieri's 35-yard field goal went through to give the
Patriots a 27-24 win, it gave the Browns a chance. Then, their last
hope hinged on the Jets beating the Packers.</TE>
<TE>   At 7:16 p.m. EST, the Browns officially became a playoff team when
the Jets drubbed the Packers, 42-17.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland will play its arch rivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers, in
the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Holcomb, who looked rusty in his first game since Oct. 6, threw a
15-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Johnson to put Cleveland up, 17-16,
with 6:58 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Green then gave Cleveland some breathing room when he busted
through a pile at the line of scrimmage and sprinted down the right
side for his second touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   But Atlanta quarterback Michael Vick drove the Falcons downfield.
His 12-yard pass to Trevor Gaylor gave the Falcons a first down at
the Cleveland four.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn ran it to the one, and Vick threw an incompletion on second
down. Rudd then submarined Dunn just short of a touchdown on third
down, and Holmes tackled the Atlanta running back on fourth down,
inches from a score that would have brought the Falcons within a
two-point conversion of tying it.</TE>
<TE>   As they began their final drive, the Falcons heard over the
stadium P.A. that the Saints had lost.</TE>
<TE>   "That was kind of a sigh of relief," Vick said. "But I still
wanted to win the game."</TE>

<HD>A Long Way From Fiesta Bowl for Oregon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In October, Oregon was 6-0, ranked No. 6, and dreaming of playing for
the national title.</LD>
<LD>   Things sure changed quickly.</LD>
<LD>   Starting with a 45-42 loss to Arizona State, the Ducks lost five
of their last six games and fell out of the top 25.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of the Fiesta Bowl, Oregon (7-5) will play Wake Forest
(6-6) today in the Seattle Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm appreciative of the fact that we get another game," Oregon
Coach Mike Bellotti said. "We get another opportunity to finish the
season right."</TE>
<TE>   Oregon should get a boost with the return of Onterrio Smith, who
rushed for 1,079 yards and 12 touchdowns in eight games before a left
knee injury sidelined him for three of the last four games.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an electrifying running back," Oregon quarterback Jason Fife
said. "Since he's been back, just practicing with us, the offense has
been uplifted."</TE>
<TE>   Bellotti plans to alternate Fife and freshman Kellen Clemens
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a plan in mind on how that's going to be accomplished,"
Bellotti said, refusing to say who will start. "There is no mystery
about it, but they'll both play."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Jim Grobe said stopping Smith is a greater concern than
trying to prepare for two quarterbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's healthy, their thoughts may be to run the ball more than
they've been running it," Grobe said. "We know if we can't slow them
down running the football, we've got problems."</TE>
<TE>   The Demon Deacons are hoping Calvin Pace can play. The 6-foot-6,
260-pound defensive tackle broke his left leg Nov. 23 against Navy,
then sat out the last game of the regular season and didn't practice
until Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Pace has 29 sacks in his career, one short of Wake Forest's career
record, held by former Seattle Seahawk standout Mike McCrary. Pace is
the school's leader in tackles for loss, with 53.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky will introduce its new coach today, amid reports that
former Oregon and St. Louis Ram coach Rich Brooks has been hired.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Byrne, associate athletic director at Kentucky, said the
school will make an announcement, but he would not confirm Brooks has
the job. Byrne said Brooks was in Lexington, Ky., Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks did not immediately return messages left at his Oregon home
and on his cell phone. His wife told the Courier-Journal of
Louisville on Saturday that her husband was taking the job. CBS
Sports reported Saturday Brooks would join Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   Guy Morriss resigned Dec. 9 to become coach at Baylor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 25-ranked Arkansas (9-4) will make its 33rd postseason
appearance when it plays Minnesota in the Music City Bowl at
Nashville today.</TE>
<TE>   Not as impressive is Arkansas' record in those bowl games. The
Razorbacks are 1-9 in their last 10 (the victory coming against Texas
in the 2000 Cotton Bowl), and are 10-19-3 overall.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get in the tradition of winning bowls, and we've got
to start now," senior tailback Fred Talley said.</TE>

<HD>McGahee Might Wait to Cash in His Chips</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Miami sophomore Willis McGahee has all the gears you'd want in a
superstar tailback, yet he's admittedly stuck when talk turns to
leaving early for the National Football League.</LD>
<LD>   "Right now, I'm in neutral," McGahee said Sunday. "I'm not worried
about it right now, I can't worry about the NFL, that's a big
decision."</LD>
<LD>   McGahee burst onto the national scene this year, rushing for 1,686
yards as a sophomore after winning the starting job when projected
starter, Frank Gore, tore up his knee at spring practice.</LD>
<TE>   The odds would seem to favor McGahee leaving after Friday's
national title game. He said he would consider the NFL if he was a
top-10 pick -- and that seems a cinch given McGahee's often awesome
display of power and speed.</TE>
<TE>   McGahee spent most of his freshman year as a fullback, making his
first start in last year's national title game for the injured Najeh
Davenport.</TE>
<TE>   He said Sunday his goal is to leave as "the best running back ever
at the University of Miami," and one win against Ohio State might
push him over the top.</TE>
<TE>   As McGahee contemplates his decision to leave for the NFL, Ohio
State All-America safety Michael Doss reflected Sunday on his
decision to return for his senior year.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of people figured Doss was NFL-bound last year, but he opted
to get his degree and try to help Ohio State win its first national
title since 1968.</TE>
<TE>   "It was difficult at the time thinking about personal life and
family situations, but I think it was the best decision for me," Doss
said. "We've had a blessed season all season and here we are in the
national championship. It was a wild gamble, but it worked out and
here we are."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Don't believe the hype: Miami players are trying to downplay the
fact the Hurricanes are double-digit favorites over Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a lot closer than 13 or 14 points," Miami defensive
tackle Matt Walters said. "To be undefeated at the end of a 13-game
season, they are doing something right. I don't see the game getting
out of hand. I think it's going to come down to late in the fourth
quarter."</TE>
<TE>   Miami is considered the fastest team in the country, but who is
the fastest Hurricane?</TE>
<TE>   McGahee said he is probably tops for the first 40 yards, but
concedes that receiver Andre Johnson is faster over the length of the
field.</TE>
<TE>   "I like die after 70 yards," McGahee said. "Andre Johnson  is the
fastest. I'm in the top 10."</TE>
<TE>   McGahee says sometimes the talk of speed gets carried away.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a linebacker, as a matter of fact, who thinks he's faster
than me," he joked of teammate Jarrell Weaver. "I keep telling the
boy he's not faster than me, but it brings out the best of
everybody."</TE>

<KH></KH>
<HD>Grain Elevator</HD>
<DH>Gesser lifts team, spirits at Washington State, where his
work ethic resonates with rural constituency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DUSTY, Wash.</DL>
<LD>The town of Dusty isn't much to see, a patchwork of wheat and barley
fields and a few grain elevators set amid shallow hills. Off the
highway stands a cafe where farmers gather around noon.</LD>
<LD>   They sit at a table in back, guys named Wally and Butch and
Rooster, dressed in overalls, pouring themselves coffee and ordering
the lunch special. The conversation soon turns to football.</LD>
<LD>   "Most of the local farmers are Washington State alumni," said Dean
Hall, who works at the farm cooperative across the street. "Everybody
talks about the Cougars."</LD>
<TE>   And when that happens, they inevitably talk about quarterback
Jason Gesser.</TE>
<TE>   Fans in Dusty and other rural communities around the university
are partial to Gesser because he has led their team into the Rose
Bowl against Oklahoma on New Year's Day.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second bowl appearance in as many seasons for
Washington State, a long-time doormat that now has a No. 7 ranking
and newfound respect.</TE>
<TE>   But winning isn't the only reason for Gesser's popularity.</TE>
<TE>   This Honolulu kid who arrived here a fish out of water has become
a local favorite because of the way he plays.</TE>
<TE>   The flip-flops and shorts, the island accent that still marks his
words -- none of that matters. He has succeeded on unfamiliar terrain
because of an attitude that makes perfect sense here.</TE>
<TE>   The Competitor</TE>
<TE>   Listen to stories of his youth.</TE>
<TE>   Like the time Gesser was four or five years old and his mother
Janet signed him up for youth soccer. She noticed him frowning as he
ran around the field.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you having fun?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   He snapped back: "No, we're losing."</TE>
<TE>   Or the high school banquet when his basketball coach told the
audience: "If Jason was playing jacks with my little daughter and she
was beating him, he would cheat to win."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis High never lost a game he started at quarterback,
rolling to consecutive Hawaii state championships.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a tough kid," said Cal Lee, his football coach there. "He
could have been a linebacker. That's the mentality of his football."</TE>
<TE>   It was 1998 and Washington State was still glowing from its first
trip to the Rose Bowl in 67 years.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser liked Coach Mike Price and the Cougar heritage -- the
school had produced Drew Bledsoe, Mark Rypien and Ryan Leaf. He liked
the idea of winning.</TE>
<TE>   But it would not be so easy.</TE>
<TE>   His first season, while he stood on the sideline as a redshirt,
the Cougars staggered to a 3-8 record. In 1999, he battled a thumb
injury and played only a few games as they went 3-9.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser kept his mouth shut, listened and watched.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing I noticed, nobody stepped up to say, 'Hey, that was my
fault,' " he said. "I knew I would have to be that guy."</TE>
<TE>   Since becoming the starter in 2000, he has assumed complete
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   If a pass is dropped, well, he should have thrown it better. If
the team loses, it is all his fault. When summer comes around, he
leads the team in voluntary workouts.</TE>
<TE>   "He brought this group together," Price said. "I'd like to take
the credit, but he's the one."</TE>
<TE>   The Warrior</TE>
<TE>   Teammates began to notice it during his freshman season when he
struggled with that thumb injury. Gesser lied to coaches about
feeling better so he could get back in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, he fractured his throwing hand but told no one until
after he had guided the Cougars to a 33-27 victory over Purdue in the
Sun Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "Keep him off the field?" receiver Collin Henderson said. "You'd
have to shoot him or kill him."</TE>
<TE>   This fall, Gesser played with a dislocated rib and was knocked out
of the Washington game with a badly injured right ankle and knee. Two
weeks later, he returned with his leg wrapped and braced for a
must-win game against UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   His statistics weren't much that day, but the other players took
note.</TE>
<TE>   "His toughness motivates us," linebacker Mawuli Davis said.
"That's how he leads us."</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars have needed that moxie more than ever since Price's
surprise announcement that he is leaving Washington State to coach at
Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Several players, including Gesser, reacted with anger and
disappointment at first. The quarterback has quickly put his hurt
behind him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll think about it later," he said. "After the game is over."</TE>
<TE>   The Nice Guy</TE>
<TE>   Price explained it this way: "If you drop a pass in practice,
he'll get on you. But if you need a place to stay, you can stay at
his house."</TE>
<TE>   As much as anything, this facet of Gesser's personality drew him
to Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted a place where people say hello when they meet on the
street. "Just like Hawaii," he said. "You don't walk past people
without talking."</TE>
<TE>   He wanted a college environment where fans come to the stadium
early in their motor homes and the whole town shuts down at kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   "Forget those big-city schools," he said. "You don't get that
closeness. You don't get that sense of pride."</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, university administrators arranged a tongue-in-cheek
publicity stunt, plastering a giant poster of Gesser on one of the
grain elevators in Dusty. He was reluctant to agree, but did not
hesitate to visit the town for the unveiling.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, the fans out there ... those are real fans," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The admiration was mutual.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a pretty good turnout that day," Hall said at the
cooperative. "He came out and shook people's hands. We thought it was
pretty neat."</TE>
<TE>   Hometown Hero</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma defensive coordinator Mike Stoops can see it when he
watches game films.</TE>
<TE>   "Gesser is a winner," Stoops said. "He does the things that a
leader is supposed to do."</TE>
<TE>   Price can see it when he sidles up to his quarterback on those
evenings past October, the wind blowing cold, the team practicing
without benefit of an opponent or cheering crowd to warm the blood.</TE>
<TE>   "Why'd you come here?" the coach teases. "Are you stupid?"</TE>
<TE>   Gesser just smiles.</TE>
<TE>   Eastern Washington has been a perfect fit for this young man. And
vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   Read the e-mail that comes into the Washington State athletic
department. It's not just the gaudy passing numbers or the Rose Bowl
that prompts fans to write. They praise Gesser for his grit, his
blue-collar approach.</TE>
<TE>   The sort of attitude that makes perfect sense in a place where
people work for a living.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser knew it all along.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I came here," he said, "I just thought this was
the place for me."</TE>

<HD>It's Down to Last Day for Frankel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a race that could have led him to within a few dollars of the
one-year earnings record, trainer Bobby Frankel had to settle for
third and fourth places Sunday as the front-running Grammarian scored
a 9-1 upset in the $150,000 San Gabriel Handicap at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Before the race, Frankel needed $129,418 to break the record of
$17,842,358 that was set by Wayne Lukas in 1988. Frankel picked up
$27,000 Sunday as Decarchy, the even-money favorite in the San
Gabriel, finished third, one length in front of stablemate Blue
Steller.</LD>
<LD>   To surpass Lukas, Frankel would have to win both races in which he
has horses entered on Tuesday, Santa Anita's final card of 2002.
Frankel is running Sumitas -- who was scratched from the San Gabriel
-- in a $70,000 allowance and favored Rolly Polly in the
$100,000-added Monrovia Handicap.</LD>
<TE>   Even if he doesn't break the record, Frankel is assured of his
second national purse title. His first was in 1993, when he ended a
10-year run by Lukas. Frankel is ahead of Bob Baffert by more than $5
million on this year's money list, which makes him the favorite to
win a third straight Eclipse Award for trainer. Frankel, elected into
the Racing Hall of Fame in 1995, won his first Eclipse two years
before.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel gives himself little chance to top Lukas after the San
Gabriel. "The two leaders (Grammarian and David Copperfield) kept on
going," he said of the first two finishers in the 1 1/8-mile grass
race. "Nobody closed any ground."</TE>
<TE>   Grammarian, a 4-year-old gelding who was ridden by Jose Valdivia
Jr., has won two races and finished second to Sligo Bay in the
Hollywood Turf Cup since he was moved by owner-breeder Lindsey
Williams from Kentucky to trainer Beau Greely's Hollywood Park barn a
couple of months ago. Grammarian, paying $21.40, beat David
Copperfield by one length in a time of 1:48 over a course listed as
good.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a nice field of horses," Greely said. "Jose rode him
perfectly. It was a masterful ride. This horse is about as well-bred
as you can get, and he seems to relax when he gets to the front."</TE>
<TE>   No matter what he does, Grammarian is a habitual longshot.
Valdivia rode Grammarian for the first time in the Hollywood Turf
Cup, when the horse went off at 14-1. Grammarian was 29-1 when he won
the Sunset Handicap at Hollywood Park in July and 55-1 in September
2001 when he broke his maiden at Kentucky Downs. Grammarian now has
four wins in 10 starts and purses of $356,966.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got speed and he can kick (in the stretch), and that's a
pretty strong combination," Valdivia said. "He loved the track, and
when I called on him, he just blasted home."</TE>
<TE>   Greely's plan is to run Grammarian in the San Marcos on Jan. 20,
followed by the San Juan Capistrano Handicap on April 20.</TE>
<TE>   Laffit Pincay, celebrating his 56th birthday, won the first race
on the card, but could do no better than second with David
Copperfield. "Coming down the stretch, my horse was lugging in a
little bit," Pincay said, "and I ran right up into the other horse's
heels. That cost us a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Bailey, in from Florida to ride Decarchy, is stuck at 65
stakes wins for the year, three short of the record set by Mike Smith
in 1994. Bailey doesn't have any stakes mounts in the final two days
of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alex Solis, complaining of a headache after a horse rolled over
him in a spill on Saturday, was excused from his mounts. Solis is
scheduled to ride Adoration in Tuesday's Monrovia. Rolly Polly, the
high weight at 122 pounds, is 2-1 on the morning line.... Kona Gold,
making his first start since running fourth in the Breeders' Cup
Sprint in October, turns 9-years-old Wednesday and will be opposed by
eight rivals in the New Year's Day $100,000 Conejo Handicap. Kona
Gold, who has six wins and five seconds in 12 starts at Santa Anita,
drew the inside post and will carry 123 pounds, which is between six
and 12 pounds more than the others.</TE>

<HD>Moore Has Twice the Fun</HD>

<AU>Dan Arritt</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an age of specialization among blue-chip high school athletes,
Evan Moore is determined to follow a less-traveled path.</LD>
<LD>   Moore, a 6-foot-7, 235-pound senior at Brea Olinda, is a standout
football and basketball player, evident by his commitment to
Stanford, where he plans to play both sports.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't want to close the door yet," Moore said. "I don't want to
be watching a basketball or football game [at Stanford] next year,
knowing I can still play at that level."</LD>
<TE>   Moore, who turns 18 next week, played receiver and free safety for
Brea Olinda in the fall, leading the team with 28 catches for 659
yards and 12 touchdowns in only nine games.</TE>
<TE>   He's the leading scorer and rebounder for the Wildcat basketball
team, which is off to its best start in school history. Playing
forward, Moore is averaging 23.1 points and 6.1 rebounds through the
first eight victories. His highest-scoring game was a 36-point effort
Thursday night in a first-round game of the Brea Olinda tournament,
when he made 14 of 19 shots.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats (10-0), ranked seventh by The Times, will be seeking
their third tournament title this season tonight at 8 when they play
host to Claremont. The fast start is no surprise to Moore and his
teammates, including 6-9 center Brent Smith. "We had high
expectations going into the season," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   When Moore began high school, he believed his best opportunity for
an athletic scholarship was through basketball. That belief grew
stronger after his sophomore season, when several colleges began
showing interest in Moore as a shooting guard. Moore began playing
football his freshman season, but didn't believe he had much of a
future until early in his junior season. At 6-5, he was about two
inches taller than his sophomore season and began drawing the
attention of college football scouts.</TE>
<TE>   Despite sitting out seven games because of a broken collarbone his
junior football season, Moore was determined to continue playing both
sports until he felt he no longer possessed the ability to compete at
the college level. Most recruiters seemed willing to oblige, but he
wasn't always convinced they would honor their word.</TE>
<TE>   "[Former UCLA football coach Bob] Toledo said, 'I'll let you do
that,' " Moore said of playing two sports. "But I kind of felt like,
if I went there, I would have to do basketball on my free time, and
that's not something I wanted."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't get that feeling when Stanford became interested. Moore
was well aware of the accord Stanford coaches made with two-sport
athlete Teyo Johnson, who recently gave up his last two seasons of
eligibility to make himself available for the NFL draft. Johnson, a
6-7 receiver, led Stanford last season with 41 catches for 467 yards
and eight touchdowns. He also played forward for the Cardinal
basketball team the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an agreement among coaches at Stanford to try and allow
[two-sport athletes] to have equal time among their sports," Moore
said. "They understand that if you want to play two sports, you
should be able."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gary McKnight of top-ranked Santa Ana Mater Dei became the
winningest high school basketball coach in Orange County on Friday
night. The Monarchs defeated Rocklin, 95-44, in the second round of
the Orange tournament, giving him 619 victories.</TE>
<TE>   McKnight, who has won 16 Southern Section titles in 21 seasons at
Mater Dei, surpassed Tom Danley, who coached at Anaheim Katella for
33 years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Poly Coach Ron Palmer, who has said he will retire at
the conclusion of this season, was slowed last week in his quest to
reach 600 victories by two perennial small-school powers.</TE>
<TE>   The Jackrabbits, the defending Southern Section Division I-AA
champions, lost to defending Division V-A champion No. 18 L.A. Price,
55-49, in a Lynwood tournament quarterfinal Friday night. Saturday,
Poly (5-6) lost to No. 15 L.A. Verbum Dei, 65-64, in overtime in a
fifth-place semifinal, leaving Palmer at 594 victories.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said Long Beach Poly is in the midst of "kind of a building
year for the next two years," after losing eight players, including
all its primary starters, from last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-ranked L.A. Loyola advanced to the championship game of the
Rotary Red Cross Classic tonight at Charleston, S.C., marking the
first time a West Coast team has played in the title game in the
history of the 10-year-old tournament. The Lions will play Lilburn
(Ga.) Berkmar High, winner of two of the last three state Class AAAAA
titles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Pacifica is playing its first season of varsity basketball,
but that hasn't stopped the Tritons from advancing to consecutive
tournament finals.</TE>
<TE>   Pacifica (11-3) lost to Solana Beach Santa Fe Christian, 44-35, in
the final of the Santa Maria Valley Christian tournament Saturday
night, two weeks after winning the Goleta Dos Pueblos tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Pacifica Coach Howard Davis couldn't point to a specific player
that has given the Tritons such a fast start, but he said the
2-year-old school has one of the best gymnasiums in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "It has 14 buckets, can seat 3,500 people and the stands go up 22
rows on both sides," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The shot of the week belonged to Pico Rivera El Rancho's Rudy
Navarette in a pool-play game Saturday night in the Montebello
Cantwell Sacred Heart tournament. After Chino Don Lugo's Glen Powers
made two free throws to tie the score, 47-47, with 1.5 seconds
remaining, Navarette let the inbounds pass roll to midcourt, keeping
the clock frozen, then picked it up 50 feet from the basket and
banked it in for a 50-47 victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Dons (8-5) play the championship game against El Monte
Mountain View tonight at 7:30.</TE>

<PH>ORANGE BOWL * USC vs. IOWA</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>Now They're the Bullies on the Block</HD>
<DH>Iowa offensive linemen were thrown into the fray early in
their careers, but the experiences have paid off.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>IOWA CITY, Iowa</DL>
<LD>Iowa Coach Kirk Ferentz calls it scar tissue. Not the physical kind.
The mental kind.</LD>
<LD>   The kind of scars Ferentz worried would be inflicted on his
offensive linemen when, out of necessity, they were thrust into
starting roles as unprepared freshmen.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Nelson could have been one of the casualties. A walk-on
tight end, he played left tackle in his first start as a redshirt
freshman in Iowa's 1999 opener against Nebraska, then the nation's
top-ranked team. He weighed 250 pounds.</LD>
<TE>   Nebraska won, 42-7, and on every play Nelson said he asked himself
the same question: "Why am I out here?"</TE>
<TE>   No one asks that anymore. Today, Nelson is a 6-foot-4, 290-pound
All-American center on an experienced offensive line that many
consider the best in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   His growth as a player has mirrored that of his linemates --
senior guards Eric Steinbach and Andy Lightfoot, senior tackle David
Porter and junior tackle Robert Gallery. They have plenty of war
stories, but the battle scars have healed with the help of an 11-1
record and berth in Thursday's Orange Bowl against USC.</TE>
<TE>   "The great thing about being a veteran group this year is that
we've been through the highs and lows," said Steinbach, a 6-7,
290-pound All-American. "Most of us were out there starting as
redshirt freshmen, 250 pounds soaking wet.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a huge reason why we've been successful, because we
played together on those 1-10 and 3-9 teams."</TE>
<TE>   Those were Iowa's records in 1999 and 2000, the first two seasons
with Ferentz as coach. Defections and injuries among offensive
linemen gave Ferentz little choice than to play underclassmen and
hope for the best.</TE>
<TE>   "When we got here the cupboard was a little depleted," Ferentz
said. "We were forced to look at some guys who probably weren't ready
to play at that level at that point, but we had no choice.</TE>
<TE>   "The most impressive part about guys like Bruce Nelson and Eric
Steinbach is that they've been so resilient. They didn't let the
tough times discourage them; they used it to their advantage. They've
really fought back to have great careers here. It's been very
gratifying to see that happen."</TE>
<TE>   The transformation of the offensive line from sieve to siege was
four years in the making.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999 and 2000, the Hawkeyes ranked last in the Big Ten
Conference in rushing offense. Last season, when they finished 7-5
and played in the Alamo Bowl, they ranked sixth.</TE>
<TE>   This season, behind a line that averages 6-6 and 296 pounds, Iowa
moved to second in conference rushing at 222.1 yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   Before they got physical, though, the linemen regularly took their
lumps.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson said one of the good things about making his first start
against then-No. 1 Nebraska was that he knew things couldn't get any
worse.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a nightmare," he said. "They were a great team and we
had a lot of growing up to do.... I wasn't prepared. I wasn't ready
to be playing, but the situation called for somebody."</TE>
<TE>   Like Nelson, Steinbach came to Iowa expecting to play tight end.
When coaches initially approached him about moving to the offensive
line as a redshirt freshman in 1999, he resisted.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I could come here and play tight end for four years,"
Steinbach said. "Finally, when Coach Ferentz asked me for the second
time, I agreed and said, 'Maybe this might be the smart move.' I can
say that it was. I have no regrets."</TE>
<TE>   Steinbach played guard in his first start, a 41-11 loss to Ohio
State in Iowa's eighth game of 1999. He weighed 250 pounds, 40 fewer
than he does now.</TE>
<TE>   Lightfoot, another fifth-year senior, said the weekly beatings --
on the scoreboard and in the trenches -- caused the young linemen to
consider their options.</TE>
<TE>   "At the beginning, we were all ready to quit," said the 6-6,
285-pound Lightfoot. "It was about to kill us. But for some reason,
we stuck it out."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson said they leaned on Ferentz and offensive line coach Joe
Philbin for support through the tough times.</TE>
<TE>   "And they proved to be pretty good rocks for us," Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, many adjustments had to be made. Gallery played his
first four games at tight end as a freshman in 2000. Because of
injuries, coaches asked him to move to tackle, a position he had
never played.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big change for me," said Gallery, a 6-7, 300-pounder who
was selected All-Big Ten. "It took me a good year and a half to get
comfortable with the things that you have to do as an offensive
lineman."</TE>
<TE>   Gallery credited the seniors for showing him the ropes.</TE>
<TE>   "Those older guys did a great job of teaching me on the go and
really helping me out the last few years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Few seniors on the Iowa roster carry the respect of backup guard
Ben Sobieski. He started one game in 1997 as a true freshman, then
started all 11 games as a sophomore. But a series of injuries,
including surgeries on each shoulder that caused him to sit out the
1999 and 2000 seasons, derailed a promising career.</TE>
<TE>   Sobieski was granted a rare sixth year of eligibility based on a
medical hardship.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's one of the great success stories on our team,"
Ferentz said of Sobieski. "I really questioned if he would be able to
make it through two-a-days this year. There was no way I could
envision him going through practice every day, but he did it."</TE>
<TE>   Sobieski has played in all 12 games, contributing to a line that
has given up only 11 sacks.</TE>
<TE>   Years from now, it's easy to envision this group of offensive
linemen getting together and reminiscing about how they survived the
1-10 season of 1999, when Nelson and his linemates learned the hard
way on the job.</TE>
<TE>   "The beauty of that year is that it makes this year so much
better," Nelson said. "We know how bad it can be and we know how good
it can be.</TE>
<TE>   "And this is as good as it gets."</TE>

<KH>INDIANAPOLIS 20, JACKSONVILLE 13</KH>
<HD>Another Struggle for Colts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Indianapolis Colts hoped on Sunday to fix some of their flaws in
time for the AFC playoffs. They settled for a victory.</LD>
<LD>   The Colts had another sluggish first half, got a scare when Marvin
Harrison was hurt midway through the third quarter and needed Peyton
Manning's 11-yard touchdown pass with 2:26 left to put away the
Jacksonville Jaguars, 20-13, on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   For Colt Coach Tony Dungy, it was good enough.</LD>
<TE>   "That was a big win for us, an important win for us," he said. "We
had to play 60 minutes of football, and that's kind of the way you
want it."</TE>
<TE>   A thing of beauty, it was not.</TE>
<TE>   The Colts (10-6) struggled early on offense and couldn't stop the
Jaguars' ground game either.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis needed two Jacksonville penalties to keep late
scoring drives going in the game's final minutes and also took
advantage of a late melee, in which the teams were called for
offsetting personal fouls. That allowed the Colts to run another play
on third and four, and Manning passed to Marcus Pollard in the back
corner of the end zone for the game-decider.</TE>
<TE>   Manning completed 20 of 28 passes for 146 yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Edgerrin James followed his worst career game with a performance
more worthy of a two-time NFL rushing champ. He carried 15 times for
86 yards and finished 11 short of his third 1,000-yard season and a
$1.5 million bonus.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison caught six passes for a season-low 28 yards to finish his
record-breaking year with 143 receptions and 1,722 yards -- the
fourth-most in league history. He came out after injuring his left
arm in the third quarter but returned on the Colts' next series.</TE>
<TE>   Jacksonville finished 6-10.</TE>

<HD>Jets Break From Pack</HD>
<DH>After getting help from division rival New England, New
York channels emotion against Green Bay, 42-17, to win AFC East title
and complete stunning turnaround from 1-4 start.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Shortly after he was named starting quarterback of the struggling New
York Jets, Chad Pennington stood at a team meeting and made a
prediction that, at the time, seemed absurdly optimistic:</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to the playoffs."</LD>
<LD>   The Jets were 1-3 -- soon to be 1-4 -- and had been outscored in
their losses by a combined 102-13, the most abysmal three-game
stretch since 1962 when they were the New York Titans.</LD>
<TE>   "The score was looking like a basketball game," running back
Curtis Martin recalled. "We were getting blown out. I believe we were
the laughingstock of the whole league."</TE>
<TE>   No one's laughing now. Not after the Jets won Sunday for the
seventh time in nine games, clinching the AFC East title with their
42-17 victory over Green Bay, and Miami's 27-24 overtime loss at New
England.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the most remarkable turnarounds in recent NFL history,
the Jets are division champions for only the second time since the
1970 merger. They will play host to Indianapolis in a first-round
playoff game Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I can remember this room after our second game, against the
Patriots, and after the third game [at Miami]," said Jet Coach Herman
Edwards, addressing reporters from his press-room podium. "Someone
said the season is over. But I wasn't smart enough to know that, and
the players weren't dumb enough to listen. It shows you what
perseverance gets for you when you believe in each other and just go
out and try to win the game."</TE>
<TE>   But beating Green Bay wasn't enough for the Jets to secure a
playoff berth. They needed help from New England, which knocked off
Miami earlier in the day. Had the Dolphins won, they would have
clinched the division title. The Patriots, who had their playoff
plans dashed when the Jets won, mounted a stirring comeback late in
the fourth quarter to overcome an 11-point Miami lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets watched part of that game in their locker room, but, true
to their word, turned off the TVs an hour before their kickoff. Miami
was up, 21-10, and seemed to have the game under control.</TE>
<TE>   "[Guard Randy Thomas] walked down when we were all watching and
kind of shut them off and said, 'That's it. It's time to think about
our game now,' " tight end Anthony Becht said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, players couldn't help but wonder what was going on at
Foxboro. The fans were tuned in, either listening to radios or
watching on TVs around the stadium, and they cheered loudly as the
Patriots began to rally. Giants Stadium shook when New England kicker
Adam Vinatieri made the winning field goal in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "When we heard the crowd cheering, the scores weren't updated
yet," said Becht, referring to the out-of-town scores on the
scoreboards. "As soon as they were finally updated, it just sent
electricity through my body and I'm sure everybody else's."</TE>
<TE>   The team-wide adrenaline surge was obvious. The Jets built leads
of 7-0 and 14-3 in the first half, then scored the first three
touchdowns of the second half to put the game out of reach.</TE>
<TE>   It was a wild weekend at this stadium, where a day earlier the New
York Giants secured a wild-card berth by beating Philadelphia, 10-7,
in overtime. Less than a month ago, the Giants were 6-6 and rumors
swirled that Coach Jim Fassel's job was in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   Fassel, suddenly revered again after four consecutive victories,
was in the tunnel outside the Jet locker room before Sunday's game.
He shook hands with well-wishers and pleasantly agreed to pose for
some group photos with Jet fans. But he didn't stick around to watch
Pennington throw four touchdown passes and upstage Packer quarterback
Brett Favre, considered by many the league's most valuable player.</TE>
<TE>   "He kept his composure," Edwards said of Pennington, who has seven
touchdown passes and no interceptions in the last two games. "He
didn't try to overdo things, he didn't try to compete with Brett
Favre, he was just Chad Pennington. We talked about that all week --
all he needed to do was be Chad Pennington, and that's good enough."</TE>
<TE>   Edwards even happily tolerated the traditional Gatorade shower,
even though it came on a frigid night when the temperatures dipped
into the low 30s.</TE>
<TE>   "It was cold, but it was fun," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since Pennington took over as starter, replacing a struggling
Vinny Testaverde in Week 5, the Jets have gone 8-4. The Jets have
gone to more of a two-back offense -- as opposed to the spread
formations they ran with Testaverde -- and have gotten more out of
Martin, who has been nursing a bad ankle all season.</TE>
<TE>   New York's defense is a big reason for the recent success too, and
looks nothing like the porous unit that had six new starters and
looked so sloppy early in the season.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a stat put up on our bulletin board that we've been one
of the top three defenses in the league in the last 10 games,"
cornerback Ray Mickens said. "Tampa Bay, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh
are right up there too."</TE>
<TE>   If one game marked the beginning of the turnaround, it was New
York's 44-13 shocker over San Diego on Nov. 3. The Chargers were one
of the league's best teams then. The Jets were 2-5.</TE>
<TE>   Now, if the Chargers want to go to the Super Bowl -- which will be
played on their home field -- they'll have to buy tickets. As for the
Jets, well, they have a different dream.</TE>
<TE>   "It all started for us in San Diego," running back Lamont Jordan
said. "Hopefully, it ends there for us."</TE>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>After the Kings and Vancouver Canucks strung together the NHL's best
records in the final four months of last season, King Coach Andy
Murray envisioned both teams building on that success as a new season
dawned.</LD>
<LD>   And while the mostly hale and hearty Canucks have shot to the top
of the Western Conference standings, the Kings have remained stuck in
the middle of the pack, scrambling for points while battling an
inordinate number of injuries.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's great for them, but we're having to do it a little
differently," Murray said Sunday before sending out a patchwork
lineup against the Colorado Avalanche. "It's just something that's
happened and we've got to deal with it.</LD>
<TE>   "It's nice for Vancouver. I like their coaches. I think our teams
play very similar games, so it's good to see that a team that plays
the same way we do, basically, can be successful. A team that's going
with young players, which we are; that didn't do a lot in terms of
going out and signing high-priced free agents; a team that has one
dominant offensive line. It's good to see that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ian Laperriere, on the two-game suspension given Todd Simpson of
the Phoenix Coyotes for high-sticking Laperriere in the throat during
Thursday night's game: "He made a spearing motion and he deserved
what he got."</TE>
<TE>   Laperriere, however, said the NHL shouldn't have to get involved.</TE>
<TE>   "Players have got to start respecting each other a little bit
more," he said. "Fighting and hitting are part of the game, but the
rest of that crap is not. [The solution] is not the referees or the
league. The players have to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "You're playing on the edge but when you cross that line, that's
when it gets ugly."</TE>

<HD>Kings Rolled by Avalanche</HD>
<DH>Colorado takes advantage of an L.A. lineup watered down by
illness and injuries to deliver a 6-1 thrashing at home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>For the last 41 minutes of its 6-1 victory over the Kings on Sunday,
the Colorado Avalanche dominated as if it were playing a minor league
team.</LD>
<LD>   Which, in a way, it was.</LD>
<LD>   With 10 players sidelined because of injury or illness, the Kings
sent a patchwork lineup onto the Pepsi Center ice in front of 18,007
to face an Avalanche team only 18 months removed from winning the
2001 Stanley Cup.</LD>
<TE>   And even with injured scoring leader Joe Sakic missing from the
Avalanche lineup, the result was predictable. Peter Forsberg scored
three goals for his first hat trick in nearly four years and the
Avalanche rolled to its most lopsided victory of what has been an
uncharacteristically bumpy season in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   For the Kings, the five-goal loss was their second in six days.</TE>
<TE>   They lost Dec. 23 at St. Louis, 5-0, before scoring a 4-3 overtime
victory over the Phoenix Coyotes on Thursday even as the injuries
continued to mount.</TE>
<TE>   As Sunday dawned, King Coach Andy Murray knew he would be without
nine injured regulars, among them Jason Allison, Adam Deadmarsh,
Bryan Smolinski, Alexander Frolov and Eric Belanger, all back home.</TE>
<TE>   That left him with only Ziggy Palffy among his top six forwards.
Also sidelined was Aaron Miller, one of his top two defensemen. Then
came word that defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky had the stomach flu.</TE>
<TE>   Murray, though, put on a brave face, telling the players assembled
before him, seven of whom started the season in the minors, that this
was a rare opportunity to pull off a monumental upset.</TE>
<TE>   "The story that's going to be written is that 10 out of a possible
18 skaters were out of our lineup," he told them. "The idea is to
write our own story."</TE>
<TE>   And right up until Mikko Eloranta was called for hooking Alex
Tanguay of the Avalanche at 19:07 of the first period, and the
referees then tacked on a delay-of-game penalty against them, the
Kings believed.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen plenty of times where depleted teams come in and steal
games," defenseman Mathieu Schneider said. "I thought we got a great
start to the game. We jumped on them; we did everything we needed to
do."</TE>
<TE>   They led, 1-0, thanks to a power-play goal by Palffy in the fifth
minute. And they had outshot the Avalanche, 13-3.</TE>
<TE>   But then, during the two-man advantage that followed, Forsberg
kick-started a dramatic momentum shift, scoring the first of three
power-play goals by the Avalanche off a pass from Milan Hejduk, who
had three assists.</TE>
<TE>   With Michael Cammalleri in the penalty box for holding Riku Hahl,
Radim Vrbata scored another power-play goal at the end of a
two-on-one breakaway early in the second period. Another breakaway,
this time with the teams at even strength, led to a goal by Dean
McAmmond about 10 minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg, who also had two goals and an assist in a 4-1 Avalanche
victory Oct. 17 at Staples Center, scored his 11th and 12th goals in
the first 6 1/2 minutes of the third period. The first with
Cammalleri again in the penalty box, and Tanguay completed the
scoring with 4:46 to play.</TE>
<TE>   The delay-of-game penalty seemed to have changed everything,
leading to the Kings' fourth consecutive road loss.</TE>
<TE>   "From there," winger Craig Johnson, "it was a different game."</TE>
<TE>   The penalty was called, the Kings said, as they were asking for
clarification about where a faceoff would be contested.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it wasn't necessary to make that call at that point,"
Murray said. "But whether I agree with it or not, it happened, and I
take responsibility for it."</TE>

<HD>In Web of Intrigue, Jackson a Kobe Ally</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phil Jackson has hinted at philosophical differences with Kobe Bryant
regarding the offense, and now Jackson's friend, co-author and former
assistant coach, Charley Rosen, advocates the Lakers trade Bryant.</LD>
<LD>   In his Internet column, he maintains that Bryant has not been held
accountable by a "jock-sniffing" Los Angeles media, a description
arrived at, perhaps, while waving school girlishly at Jackson before
a game last week.</LD>
<LD>   Rosen was at the press table in New Jersey and Jackson on the
sideline preparing to, you know, coach a basketball game. Finally,
Jackson returned the wave, ending the humiliation and allowing Rosen
to take his seat with the rest of the Pulitzer winners.</LD>
<TE>   Already having sold out a longtime friend, 80-year-old Tex Winter,
for the sake of his fledgling dotcom career, Rosen continues to
receive royalties from a book he wrote with Jackson last year, and in
the past months has praised Jackson's work in at least three columns.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said Sunday his friend chooses to view the Bryant
situation as "half empty," and that Jackson is the optimist of the
two.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows what I want," Jackson said of Bryant. "I've come to the
conclusion he's got a tremendous challenge. I'm making him do a lot
more than he's capable of doing inside the offense."</TE>
<TE>   While there have been occasional comparisons drawn between Bryant
and Michael Jordan in terms of their roles within Jackson's offense,
Jackson said Bryant often has been asked to play the parts of both
Jordan and Scottie Pippen.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, Jackson said, never had to set up the offense or handle
the ball through pressure, as Bryant does.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't fault Kobe for a lot of things," Jackson said. "And I've
asked him to be more aggressive on top of it. I think he'll find his
way back into the offense before the season's too far along. He's got
a rebellious side in him. I know that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Samaki Walker, who has started 18 games at power forward, was
unavailable for a second consecutive game because of tonsillitis. He
was recovering at home and will be re-evaluated this week. A
tonsillectomy has not yet been discussed. Mark Madsen started Sunday
against Toronto.</TE>

<HD>A Bad Patch May Be Over</HD>
<DH>Lakers ring out 2002 with 104-88 rout of Toronto, a
two-game win streak and a soulful look from Jackson.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The year ended about the time the first gray stubble appeared below
Phil Jackson's lower lip, a two-game winning streak sprouting in step
with what looks to be a brand new soul patch, and the Laker camp is
officially accepting all marriages of hoops and karma as it heaves
and strains for a fourth consecutive title.</LD>
<LD>   Amid reports that Jackson isn't as easy to live with as he once
was, and with a fresh certainty in their demeanor, the Lakers swept
their weekend games against two of the NBA impoverished. They beat
the Toronto Raptors, 104-88, Sunday night at Staples Center, 24 hours
after a 19-point victory in Denver, and so have won two in a row for
the first time in three weeks and the fourth time all season.</LD>
<LD>   Having hedged his bets by adding a fourth ring earlier in the
week, newlywed Shaquille O'Neal scored 35 points, most within a few
feet of the rim. He made 14 of 18 shots and took 10 rebounds, then
left without a word, his recent habit.</LD>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant had 13 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds, that
rebound short of his season's fifth triple-double, and Rick Fox
scored 15 points in 22 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have won three times in seven games, twice against the
eight-win Raptors and once against the six-win Nuggets. They played
for the seventh time this season on back-to-back nights, and for the
first time won the second of those, and that, Jackson said, "We feel
like we can build on."</TE>
<TE>   After what they've been through -- and it will be weeks before
they can be sure it's truly behind them -- the Lakers cling to
familiarity, the sight of O'Neal thrashing to the basket, the vision
of Bryant on the wing setting up his fadeaway, and of -- get this --
the triangle offense. Even while O'Neal was having one of those
I'll-get-50-if-I-want-'em games, there appeared to be a purpose to
the games of those around him, more than stuffing the ball into
O'Neal's hands and standing away from the violence.</TE>
<TE>   Though their turnovers remained high (17), so too were their
assists (28, on 43 field goals) and, occasionally, their regard for
finding the open shot.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it started [Saturday] night a little bit," Fox said on
his way out. "The whip has been cracked. We asked for it and Phil has
started to demand it. It's been a nice three-year run. It would be
rather disappointing to end it because we weren't disciplined enough.
It's tough not to be able to have fun and joke with our coach, but
we're not a team that responds to that. It's tough on him, too, I'm
sure, because he wants to enjoy it, too."</TE>
<TE>   They've asked for it, of course. The Lakers rolled to the end of
their calendar year and into their longest break of the season --
they won't play again until Saturday in Phoenix -- with a record of
13-19. Their end-to-end victory against the Raptors pulled them out
of their virtual tie with Golden State for last place in the Pacific
Division, and their rigorous early-season schedule turns airy for the
better part of two months.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, among others, has targeted the coming weeks as their time
to heal and then answer their horrendous start. It'll start with
O'Neal. He has made 24 of 33 field-goal attempts since his wedding
day, and again is the league's most accurate shooter, Sunday climbing
to 57.2%. He has led the league five consecutive seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Against the likes of Jelani McCoy, Greg Foster and Nate Huffman,
and with the Laker offense looking something approaching crisp,
O'Neal made 10 of 13 field-goal attempts and had 24 points in the
first half. He also had seven rebounds, three of them on the
offensive side.</TE>
<TE>   At halftime, his young sons, sitting across from the Laker bench,
pulled new white No. 34 jerseys over their heads and shouted for him,
"Dad! Dad!" so he could see, too.</TE>
<TE>   "He was pretty good," Raptor Coach Lenny Wilkens said. "That's the
quickest I've seen him. We had no answer for him. There were a couple
times we couldn't even get there with the double-team, he was so
quick."</TE>
<TE>   It was that, for sure, but the offense was quicker to O'Neal, as
well, also at Jackson's insistence.</TE>
<TE>   "He's gotten a little less tolerant," Fox said. "The rope has
shortened. If you're not going to police yourself, then you're going
to get policed. We're proving we can still be coached. Once again,
Phil is showing he has something to do with this success."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After tying a record for the lowest-scoring quarter in the history of
the franchise, the Houston Rockets rallied for what Coach Rudy
Tomjanovich called one of their biggest victories of the season.</LD>
<LD>   "This was more than just one win," Tomjanovich said after the
Rockets recovered from a seven-point quarter to defeat the New
Orleans Hornets, 97-85, Sunday night at Houston. "We stayed calm
after the third quarter."</LD>
<LD>   Cuttino Mobley had 12 of his 24 points, and Steve Francis had 12
of his 23 points, in the 38-point fourth quarter.</LD>
<TE>   "I couldn't be happier with the way we responded in the fourth
quarter," Tomjanovich said. "Cuttino got it going. I was really proud
of our guys for not getting completely exasperated."</TE>
<TE>   Mobley realized the Rockets had to turn it around.</TE>
<TE>   "We came out flat in the third period," he said. "We knew we had
to come our hard in the fourth. We didn't run anything in the third.
They were pushing us out of position and trying to be a little
physical."</TE>
<TE>   The third quarter matched the worst for the Rockets, tying a mark
set against the Lakers on Nov. 15, 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Jamal Mashburn had 25 points for New Orleans, but the Hornets lost
their fourth in a row and seventh of eight. Houston had lost a
season-high three in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't feel sorry for ourselves because we have spent a lot of
time on the road," Hornet Coach Paul Silas said. "You still have to
make plays that will win games for you and we didn't do that."</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 103, Cleveland 84 -- Rookie Amare Stoudemire made up for
the absence of leading scorer Shawn Marion, finishing with 19 points
and 13 rebounds to lead the surging Suns at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Stoudemire dominated inside with an active game that had defenders
reaching and fouling in an effort to stop him. The 6-foot-8 forward,
drafted in the first round out of high school, made a career-best 11
of 15 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always talking about him, saying, 'Man, did you see that?'
" said guard Anfernee Hardaway, who scored 16 points to help the Suns
win their fifth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got unbelievable talent and a chance to be outstanding,"
Cavalier guard Milt Palacio said. "He's quick, strong and hustles.
That's a dangerous combination."</TE>
<TE>   Marion, averaging 20.4 points and a team-high 9.8 rebounds, was
not in uniform because of a sprained left ankle suffered against the
Clippers on Friday.</TE>

<HD>Rahlves Wins Downhill Event</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Conquering a course he compared to "skiing down a spiral staircase,"
Daron Rahlves of Sugar Bowl, Calif., recorded the third World Cup
victory of his career by winning a downhill race Sunday at Bormio,
Italy.</LD>
<LD>   Combined with the fifth-place finish of Bode Miller, it was the
first time two U.S. men placed in the top five of a World Cup
downhill since 1968.</LD>
<LD>   Rahlves, the world super-giant slalom champion, finished the
challenging course in 2 minutes 1.42 seconds, ahead of Austrians
Fritz Strobl (2:01.60), Hannes Trinkl (2:01.66) and Peter Rzehak
(2:01.85), and Miller (2:02.08). Miller, of Franconia, N.H., had won
a World Cup giant slalom Dec. 22 at Alta Badia, Italy.</LD>
<TE>   "Bode did it last week and he's been challenging me, so I had to
step up and get it in gear," Rahlves said after covering the course's
3,315-foot vertical drop.</TE>
<TE>   "This is probably the toughest race I've ever had, it was so bumpy
all the way from the bottom up to the start. It was a long course and
was really tough to ski. I gave it everything I had, from the time I
kicked out of the start to the finish line."</TE>
<TE>   World Cup overall leader Stephan Eberharter of Austria, competing
for the first time since he injured a knee in a slalom race Dec. 15,
didn't finish. He was trailing Rahlves' time when he skied off the
course before the bottom section.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter retained his World Cup lead with 548 points. Miller is
second with 478 points. Rahlves is fifth in the downhill standings
and 13th in the overall standings with 205 points.</TE>
<TE>   "It was exciting, to say the least. It was a Christmas-New Year's
present," said Phil McNichol, the U.S. men's coach. "Daron has done
well at Bormio in the past. Typically, he's good on the more
technical downhills, the steeper, high-speed technical challenges,
not so much the tuck-and-glide."</TE>

<TE>   Janica Kostelic of Croatia used two near-flawless runs to win her
third World Cup slalom this season.</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic, a three-time Olympic champion, finished with a combined
time of 1:38.67 at Semmering, Austria, and defeated Christel Pascal
of France by 1.11 seconds for the 14th slalom victory of her career.</TE>
<TE>   Pascal finished in 1:39.78 and Nicole Gius of Italy finished third
in 1:40.45.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sven Hannawald of Germany won the first leg of the Four-Hill Tour
for his fifth consecutive victory in the ski jumping competition.</TE>
<TE>   Hannawald, who became the first ski jumper to sweep the four hills
last season, had jumps of 125.5 and 119 meters at Oberstdorf,
Germany, for 263.1 points. He tied the record of former East German
Helmut Recknagel, who won five in a row in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Hoellwarth of Austria, the World Cup leader, finished
second with 257.7 points and Janne Ahonen of Finland was third with
257.5 points.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball</TE>
<TE>   Free-agent reliever Ramiro Mendoza, 30, a key member of the New
York Yankees the last seven seasons, agreed to a two-year deal with
the Boston Red Sox. Mendoza was 8-4 with four saves and a 3.44
earned-run average in a career-high 62 appearances last season.</TE>

<TE>   Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski, Britain's top two men's players,

<TE>   Henman, the British No. 1, said a shoulder operated on in November
has not fully recovered. He had been scheduled to play in the
Commonwealth Bank International, which starts Jan. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Rusedski, who also withdrew from the Qatar Open this week and the

<KH>OKLAHOMA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Hybl Does Some of His Best Work Outside Spotlight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Squinting in the glare of a Southern California afternoon, his team
just finished with practice, Oklahoma quarterback Nate Hybl said he
doesn't mind playing in the shadows.</LD>
<LD>   The senior from Hazlehurst, Ga., ranks as one of the top passers
in school history and owns a 19-3 record as a starter over the last
two seasons.</LD>
<LD>   But in the Big 12 Conference, these accomplishments pale in the
glare of hype that surrounds Texas quarterback Chris Simms, not to
mention a glitzy season from Texas Tech's Kliff Kingsbury.</LD>
<TE>   Now that the Sooners have reached the Rose Bowl, Hybl finds
himself playing second fiddle to his Washington State counterpart,
Jason Gesser.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm used to it," he said. "It doesn't bother me at all."</TE>
<TE>   But he wonders aloud if his statistics are so much different from
Gesser's. This season, Hybl completed 57% of his passes with 22
touchdowns and eight interceptions. Gesser finished at 60% with 27
touchdowns and 11 interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   The yardage isn't as close -- Gesser with 3,169 to Hybl's 2,298.
Gesser also has a better pass efficiency rating.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Hybl's numbers have been limited because Oklahoma runs the
ball more often, averaging almost 60 additional yards on the ground.
Washington State has made no secret about focusing on Oklahoma
running back Quentin Griffin come New Year's Day.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Hybl should take it personally.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always our goal to make the quarterback beat us because we
feel we have great cornerbacks and safeties," Cougar defensive end
Isaac Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   No offense taken.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I've won a lot of games," Hybl said. "I would think
they're preparing for me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bob Stoops and his brother Mike, the defensive coordinator,
have enjoyed quite a run at Oklahoma, taking the Sooners to four
consecutive bowl games and winning a national championship since
their arrival in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   But, statistically, they can't hold a candle to their younger
brother.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Stoops has been the defensive backs coach at Miami the last
two seasons, during which the top-ranked Hurricanes are undefeated.</TE>
<TE>   "He hasn't lost a game and he lives on the water," Bob Stoops
said. "It's all downhill from there."</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners had a busy Sunday, visiting City of Hope Medical
Center in the morning, gathering for a team photo on the Rose Bowl
field around midday, then holding a closed practice in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Stoops wants his players to enjoy themselves but reminded them,
"The best part is the game. Playing well, that's what you remember
the most."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners spent Friday afternoon at Disneyland, and after a few
hours in the Magic Kingdom during peak holiday season, offensive line
coach Kevin Wilson was ready for some football.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got five kids and I kept looking around, 'Where's this one?
Where's that one?' " Wilson said. "Coaching the game will be easier
than trying to keep track of five kids on a crowded day at
Disneyland."</TE>

<HD>USOC's Ward Facing Hearing</HD>
<DH>Chief executive is alleged to have helped brother's firm in
bid to obtain microturbine deal for Pan American Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lloyd Ward, the U.S. Olympic Committee's chief executive, directed
USOC staff to help his brother's company in its bid to procure a
potentially lucrative deal to provide power generators to officials
in the Dominican Republic, the electricity-starved site of the 2003
Pan American Games, according to a review of key documents and
interviews with figures close to the negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   With ethics and perhaps legal concerns triggered, the USOC will
announce today that it has called a Jan. 13 hearing, probably in
Denver, at which Ward's future as CEO is the sole item on the agenda.</LD>
<LD>   The USOC is likely to consider the following:</LD>
<TE>   * In April, Ward directed the USOC's then-director of
international relations to see him about a proposal Ward first
received in February on behalf of Detroit-based Energy Management
Technologies (EMT). Thereafter, following introductions to officials
in the Dominican Republic made by that USOC official, the company
went on to propose it supply "microturbines," which provide stand-by
power, to the 2003 Pan Am organizing committee. Through the months,
the numbers of turbines, and thus the costs, varied, but one proposal
called for 53 machines at $4.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   * On file in the USOC's Colorado Springs, Colo., offices is a
statement Ward signed July 1 in which he declared he had no actual or
potential conflicts of interest for calendar year 2002. Lloyd Ward
has no financial interest in EMT. Ward's brother, Rubert, is
identified on at least two EMT documents as the company's president.</TE>
<TE>   * Two weeks ago, at a meeting in Santo Domingo, the capital of the
Dominican Republic, an EMT official, Lorenzo Williams, offered 5% of
a deal as "appreciation" to two top executives of the organizing
committee. A Dominican official at the meeting, who in an interview
Sunday characterized the offer as a "bribe," said he emphatically
refused it, adding that no contract with EMT has been signed and none
will be. Williams denies offering any bribe; on Dec. 17, meantime, he
wrote a letter apologizing for his "most egregious and inappropriate
offer."</TE>
<TE>   Ward, who has proven to be tenacious and resourceful in the
behind-the-scenes politicking that marks USOC affairs, did not return
a phone call to his Florida home seeking comment. His wife took a
message.</TE>
<TE>   The USOC thus seems poised to plunge yet again into distraction
and turmoil. It has for years been plagued by management turnover,
and recent years have seen episodes of ethics-related controversies.</TE>
<TE>   In May, for instance, Sandra Baldwin, who two years earlier had
been elected the USOC's first female president, resigned after
admitting to discrepancies in her USOC biography. She had listed a
doctorate in American literature that she didn't earn.</TE>
<TE>   USOC President Marty Mankamyer said Sunday that "the allegations
and issues" about Ward "are both serious and disturbing," adding that
the USOC is "held to a high standard."</TE>
<TE>   Ward, a former Maytag CEO hailed as a marketing expert, came to
the USOC 14 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team won a record 34 medals at the Salt Lake Games in
February. But the USOC has announced few major corporate sponsorship
deals since.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Ward has for months been a focus of attention as one
of a handful of African American members of Augusta National Golf
Club, site of the Masters. The club does not have a female member. In
an Oct. 7 statement, Ward pledged to "aggressively work" for reform
from within and on Nov. 1, the USOC's policy-making executive
committee issued a statement supporting Ward's "principled position
on the issue."</TE>
<TE>   That statement was timed, however, to ensure that the Augusta
issue did not deflect attention from the USOC's Nov. 2 vote at which
New York was picked to be the U.S. candidate for the 2012 Summer
Games. The International Olympic Committee will pick the 2012 site in
2005.</TE>
<TE>   The 14th edition of the Pan Am Games is scheduled to be held Aug.
1-17, 2003, in Santo Domingo; the Games serve as a year-before warmup
for the Summer Olympics and attract thousands of athletes from the
Western Hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   Preparations for the 2003 Games have taxed the small island
nation. The Games are projected to cost at least $120 million, not
including an athletes' village, estimated at another $40 million.</TE>
<TE>   The country has long been plagued by electrical blackouts. In a
letter dated Feb. 19, signed by Williams and by Rubert Ward, EMT
solicited an investment of $150,000 from Lloyd Ward, saying it saw a
market for microturbines in the Caribbean, particularly the
Dominican.</TE>
<TE>   "He turned me down," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   In at least two company documents, Rubert Ward is identified as
EMT's president, Williams its CEO. Williams said Sunday he is
currently president and CEO and that Rubert Ward "has no title now,"
adding, "EMT has basically been me because we haven't had the
financial capability to pay Rubert."</TE>
<TE>   Rubert Ward did not return calls Sunday seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   On April 2, Lloyd Ward sent a handwritten note to Hernando
Madronero, at the time the USOC's international relations director,
that -- in an apparent reference to EMT -- said, "This is an
interesting proposal that could be beneficial for the 2003 Pan Am
Games. Let's discuss. Come see me this week," the "this week" crossed
out and replaced by "today."</TE>
<TE>   Madronero then put Rubert Ward in contact with officials in Santo
Domingo, in particular Jose Joaquin Puello, a neurosurgeon who heads
the Dominican Olympic Committee and the Pan Am 2003 organizing
committee. Later, EMT was introduced to Lowell Fernandez, who is the
Games' project manager. Madronero, whom Ward fired in October,
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   On July 1, Ward signed a conflict-of-interest form, acknowledging
that conflicts, real or perceived, may involve "placement of business
in, or favorable treatment of, a firm owned or controlled by a
volunteer, family member or personal friend."</TE>
<TE>   A July 8 letter from EMT to Lloyd Ward, again signed by his
brother and Williams, says: "We also want to personally thank you for
personally taking an interest in what we are trying to accomplish
with both the Games and our project in the Dominican Republic." A
handwritten note on the letter reads, "Hernando -- FYI Lloyd."</TE>
<TE>   In September, EMT forwarded the $4.6-million proposal to Santo
Domingo. "The problem is, we are not interested in buying anything
for only 15 days, as you might understand," Puello said in an
interview. "From the very beginning, we told them we were not
interested in buying anything."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 13, Williams met with Fernandez in the latter's office in
Santo Domingo. Fernandez, 37, who was recruited from a globally known
accounting and consulting firm to work for the Dominican government
to try to ensure the 2003 Games' success, said he recorded the
conversation and that Williams did not know he was being recorded.</TE>
<TE>   On the tape, which was played for The Times, a voice Fernandez
says is Williams' is heard saying, "It's very important to me to get
this deal," and said as "appreciation" he would offer 5% "for you and
Dr. Puello."</TE>
<TE>   There is a pause in the conversation, and then Williams said, "No?
... More?"</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez can then be heard saying, "I think you should stand up
and leave," which Williams did.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said Sunday, "You let me hear a tape where I said I
offered them 5%." Asked if he had offered a bribe, he said, "No."</TE>
<TE>   In Williams' letter to Fernandez, Williams says he was given "very
bad advice" by "some of my Dominican associates," who said "it would
be necessary to adopt this practice in order to compete effectively
here."</TE>
<TE>   Williams said Sunday he sent the letter because, "[Fernandez] took
it wrong that I was trying to offer him something."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he had any doubts about what had happened in his office,
Fernandez said, "No, of course not."</TE>

<KH>CAROLINA 10, NEW ORLEANS 6</KH>
<HD>Saints Are Put in Place--Out of the Playoffs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>The New Orleans Saints were so close to the playoffs -- just one
victory away with three chances to get in.</LD>
<LD>   But as they have done so often, the Saints will watch the playoffs
after blowing all three games -- two against last-place teams.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday's finale might have been the most disheartening, with
Carolina cornerback Terry Cousin making two interceptions and
recovering a fumble to preserve the Panthers' 10-6 victory.</LD>
<TE>   New Orleans (9-7) needed to win and for Atlanta to lose to reach
the playoffs. The Falcons lost to Cleveland, 24-16, but the Saints
had already lost.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected to go to the playoffs at the beginning of the season,
the middle of the season and even today," Saint receiver Donte'
Stallworth said. "The best team doesn't always win. We found that out
a couple of times this season."</TE>
<TE>   After going 5-0 against first-place teams, the Saints couldn't win
against teams with losing records in the final three games, including
a stunning loss last Sunday to Cincinnati, which finished 2-14. New
Orleans opened 6-1, only to lose six of its last nine.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to win the ones you get chances to win," Saint safety
Sammy Knight said. "We didn't do that all year."</TE>
<TE>   Carolina (7-9), in last place in the NFC South, ended a losing
streak of 13 in division games. The Panthers were 1-5 this season in
the new division after going 0-8 last season in the NFC West.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina shook off a 1-15 season last year to finish with four
victories in its last five games.</TE>
<TE>   "That's character," Carolina receiver Muhsin Muhammad said. "This
team has more character and more togetherness ... it's an almost
eerie feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Fans started booing quarterback Aaron Brooks and the Saints'
offense early.</TE>
<TE>   By the second half, chants of "We want Jake!" -- calling for
backup quarterback Jake Delhomme -- boomed though the Superdome.</TE>
<TE>   "When you play at home, most crowds try to back you and help you
win," Saint Coach Jim Haslett said. "That's what home-field advantage
is all about."</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers, with the No. 4 defense overall, held the Saints to
244 yards, 125 of them rushing. Deuce McAllister gained 117 yards in
28 carries, the first back to have a 100-yard game against Carolina
this season.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks, who completed 12 of 31 passes for 145 yards, was sacked
three times and had two passes intercepted. The Saints converted only
four of 17 third downs.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been making mistakes," Cousin said of Brooks. "When you're
at home and the crowd boos, that speaks volumes."</TE>
<TE>   Carolina's offense wasn't much better.</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Peete completed 19 of 30 passes for 203 yards and a
touchdown. He was intercepted twice and sacked twice.</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers converted three of 14 third downs. They had 273 total
yards, rushing for 85. Nick Goings had 70 yards in 18 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Tempers flared before the game between some New Orleans and
Carolina players. The Panthers' secondary was upset by remarks that
Saint receiver Joe Horn made after the first game this season, when
he said he saw fear in the eyes of the Panthers.</TE>
<TE>   "I took it serious," Carolina safety Deon Grant said. "It got me
excited. It made me want to just go out and hunt all day."</TE>

<LD>Ricky Williams, Deuce McAllister and the reigning Super Bowl
champions are out.</LD>
<LD>   Dwayne Rudd, Wayne Chrebet and a team that lost three of its last
four games are in.</LD>
<LD>   It had to figure, considering the absurdity of the 17 weeks that
produced this playoff field, which seems to missing one dominant
team, one Super Bowl favorite, the 2001 AFC and NFC champions and,
really, a whole slew of people who once expected to be there,
including:</LD>
<TE>   * The top six rushers in the league. Miami's Williams (who
finished with 1,853 yards), San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson (1,673),
Kansas City's Priest Holmes (1,615), Denver's Clinton Portis (1,508),
Buffalo's Travis Henry (1,438) and New Orleans' McAllister (1,388)
all failed to qualify for the postseason. What was that again about
having to establish the running game?</TE>
<TE>   * Drew Bledsoe, midseason consensus MVP and Pro Bowl selection,
who needed a 27-9 victory over the 2-14 Cincinnati Bengals to end a
2-5 Buffalo slide and even the Bills' final record at 8-8. There's a
reason they hand out the big awards after 16 games, not eight.</TE>
<TE>   * The New Orleans Saints, who started the season 6-1 and went 5-0
against first-place teams, only to go 0-3 against last-place teams,
including back-to-back losses to Cincinnati and Carolina during the
regular season's last two weeks. By losing, 10-6, at home to the
Panthers, New Orleans finished 9-7 and a half-game out of the running
in the NFC.</TE>
<TE>   * The Miami Dolphins, who opened 5-1, got a league rushing
championship out of Williams, dominated Oakland in Miami two weeks
ago and led New England by 11 points with 4:59 remaining Sunday. The
Dolphins blew that lead and eventually lost to the Patriots in
overtime, 27-24, dropping them to 9-7 and out of the playoffs. And
they still owe New Orleans their first-round pick in 2003 to complete
the Williams trade.</TE>
<TE>   * The Patriots, who thought they'd saved their season with the
comeback against Miami, only to watch the archrival New York Jets
rout Brett Favre and the Green Bay Packers, 42-17, which gave the
Jets the AFC East title on tiebreakers and ended New England's hopes
of repeating as Super Bowl champion.</TE>
<TE>   These playoffs also will proceed without the reigning NFC champion
St. Louis Rams, eliminated weeks ago; the San Diego Chargers, whose
31-28 overtime loss to Seattle completed a 2-7 swoon that left the
Chargers 8-8; and the Denver Broncos, popular preseason Super Bowl
picks whose 37-7 defeat of Arizona was ultimately meaningless. Since
winning the 1999 Super Bowl in John Elway's last game, the Broncos
have missed the playoffs three times in four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Dolphins, Chargers, Broncos and Bills spent so much of
November and December backsliding, second chances were granted to the
perpetrators of the two most blockheaded plays of the season,
Cleveland's Rudd and the Jets' Chrebet.</TE>
<TE>   Rudd was nearly run into Lake Erie by irate Brown fans after his
premature helmet spike cost Cleveland a season-opening victory over
Kansas City. That play hounded Rudd for four long months, hanging
heavier with every last-minute Brown defeat -- and there were six,
all told, this season, each inching Rudd closer to a very long and
bitter winter.</TE>
<TE>   But Sunday, with their playoff hopes barely flickering, with
Michael Vick's Atlanta Falcons inches away from the Cleveland end
zone late in the fourth quarter, Rudd stopped Warrick Dunn for no
gain on third down, highlighting a goal-line stand that preserved the
Browns' 24-16 victory.</TE>
<TE>   After that, Rudd and the Browns had to sit and wait for the final
results in the AFC East. When the Dolphins, Patriots and Jets all
finished 9-7, and the Dolphins and Patriots were eliminated on
tiebreakers, the Jets claimed the division title and the AFC's last
wild card fell to the Browns.</TE>
<TE>   Rudd, whose name no longer is mud, is playoff-bound.</TE>
<TE>   So, amazingly, is Chrebet, whose foolhardy attempt to hurdle four
Chicago Bears on a desperate downfield run two weeks ago resulted in
a fumble and a 20-13 loss that appeared to snuff out the Jets'
playoff aspirations. After Wayne's whirl, the Jets' only path to the
postseason was this: Sweep the Patriots and Packers while the
Dolphins went 0-2 against the Vikings and Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   Miami did its part, losing its fourth and fifth consecutive road
games, both on late field goals.</TE>
<TE>   More improbably, the Jets routed the Patriots in New England, then
overwhelmed a Packer team playing for the top seed in the NFC -- with
Chrebet catching two scoring passes.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets are in, but more than that, they are champions of the AFC
East, meaning they will host AFC South runner-up Indianapolis (10-6)
in a wild-card game Saturday. The winner probably will travel to
Oakland for a second-round game.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland will play at AFC North champion Pittsburgh (10-5-1) on
Sunday. The Steelers swept the Browns this season and another victory
would send Pittsburgh to Tennessee in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta's loss to the Browns was the third in four games for the
Falcons, who wound up 9-6-1. That should have been more than enough
to finish them, but New Orleans backpedaled even faster down the
stretch, going 3-6 -- including an incredible 0-3 against Minnesota,
Cincinnati and Carolina. At 9-7, the Saints allowed Atlanta to back
into the NFC's final wild card.</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay (12-4), which slipped from No. 1 to No. 3 in the NFC
with its loss to the Jets, will host the Falcons on Saturday. In the
other NFC wild-card game, San Francisco (10-5 entering tonight's game
against St. Louis) will host the New York Giants (10-6) Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Both NFC wild-card games are rematches of season openers. In Week
1, the Packers beat the Falcons, 37-34, in overtime and the 49ers
edged the Giants, 16-13.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, what happened in September means nothing now. As the
Dolphins, Saints, Patriots and Chargers learned the hard way.</TE>

<HD>Simpson Has No Place in This Family Practice</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DAVIE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>It wasn't a premeditated decision, welcoming O.J. Simpson to USC's
Orange Bowl practice Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't that Simpson was invited by the coaches or athletic
officials. It was a "unique situation," Coach Pete Carroll said, a
clash of the family that welcomed back a football star and a
university that might wish its star who was accused of a double
murder chose to stay away.</LD>
<LD>   What could we have done? USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett said.
"Frankly, something happened beyond our control," he said. "It wasn't
planned. I feel our players and coaches handled the situation
properly."</LD>
<TE>   Could Simpson have been kept away from a public practice where one
and all were allowed to watch? Maybe not. Should he have been given a
chance to address the team in the locker room after practice
Saturday? Absolutely not.</TE>
<TE>   Should USC players have been placed in a situation where they
could either be polite to Simpson or turn their backs? One of the
pleasures of watching this Trojan team is that the players are so
respectful, well-spoken and willing to answer questions, sign
autographs and do interviews.</TE>
<TE>   It was not Carson Palmer's inclination to turn away from Simpson.
It is never Palmer's nature to be rude. So now there is a photo and
video, nationally distributed, of Palmer smiling at Simpson, two
Heisman Trophy winners chatting.</TE>
<TE>   "How could Palmer do that?" USC friends and foes might ask. But it
wasn't Palmer's fault.</TE>
<TE>   Did Carroll have to say this afterward about Simpson: "It was good
to have him out here. At 'SC, our guys hold a Heisman Trophy winner
in the highest regard. For them to get a chance to see him and visit
with him was very special for them"? No, he didn't.</TE>
<TE>   That comment evoked rage, pain, anguish and disgust from dozens of
e-mailers, many of them USC alumni.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Arnett, an All-American tailback at USC, former Los Angeles
Ram and a 2001 inductee into the College Football Hall of Fame, wrote
one of the e-mails. And over the telephone, Arnett was eager to
express his feelings.</TE>
<TE>   "I can understand the kids on the team who were very young at the
time, doing what they did," Arnett said. "But I can't imagine Pete
Carroll or anybody else, Mike Garrett, people in authority, who
condoned this.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the USC people I talked to today, and I talked to a lot,
are very unhappy. What I'm concerned about is the example it gives
young kids in the United States that somebody with that kind of
background can still be a role model because of a Heisman Trophy. I
can't condone it, I don't understand it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people like Carroll and Garrett should know that I, and
many others, would walk out of anything Simpson would show up at.
This is not a simple matter. To see Simpson on TV shaking hands with
the kids as if it was all right, everything was all right ... I can't
agree with that."</TE>
<TE>   For those who say that Simpson was acquitted in his criminal
trial, Arnett would answer that in a civil trial Simpson was found
liable for $33.5 million in damages for the murder of his ex-wife,
Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman. There seemed to be
no thought given to how the families of the victims might feel
watching Simpson smile and mug for the cameras. Or to how the
families might feel when they read on Sunday that Simpson referred to
the murders and his trials as "my ordeal."</TE>
<TE>   Simpson took advantage of USC. He took advantage of Justin Fargas,
the USC tailback who had always admired Simpson, the football player.
When Fargas -- whose father, Antonio "Huggy Bear" Fargas, knew
Simpson through the acting grapevine -- took a chance and invited
Simpson to practice, Simpson should have said no.</TE>
<TE>   Any man with a sense of propriety, any man who cared about his
university, any man who considered the feelings of anyone but himself
would not have come to practice. A man with a moral center would have
understood that, innocent or not, his presence anywhere is a
flashpoint, especially so when he hadn't attended a USC football
function in well over a decade by his own reckoning.</TE>
<TE>   He would have known that showing up at this moment, at this time
of celebration, could only tarnish the pride in this team, by its
fans and his university.</TE>
<TE>   But we know Simpson has no sense of propriety or feelings for
anyone but himself. So he showed up. He conducted interviews and
allowed himself to be photographed with players. Simpson is long past
worrying if he looks bad. He certainly wouldn't worry how he would
make USC players look.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Davis, a former USC All-American tailback and Heisman
runner-up in 1974, was passionately angry Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "That took a lot of gall to do that," Davis said. "Simpson lost
the right to be with the team in those situations. If I'm involved in
the biggest murder case of all time, with all the controversy that
surrounded that case ... that's gall to do what he did.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw that, let me tell you. Some people need to know when
they don't need to come around and some people need to know when to
keep people away. You want somebody to talk to the players after
practice? I'd be happy to. We don't need O.J. Simpson to do that."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a unique situation," Carroll said Sunday. "We've had
previous players come by our practices -- Keyshawn Johnson, John
McKay, Tony Boselli. We hold our former players in high regard."</TE>
<TE>   A misjudgment was made. It was made by anybody at USC who thought
Simpson's presence was not going to be taken negatively. It is a
misjudgment to equate Keyshawn Johnson's practice appearance with
Simpson's.</TE>
<TE>   One of the great charms of USC's football program is its embrace
of tradition and its former players. "Family atmosphere" is not an
empty phrase. USC football is truly a family.</TE>
<TE>   But a family can also teach lessons. That's what is supposed to
happen at a university, too. Whether you believe Simpson is guilty of
everything, innocent of everything or is somewhere in between, if you
are a USC athletic official or coach, you must know he is divisive
and distracting. You must know he would do far more harm than good to
your team this week.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson could have stayed away. USC should have begged him to do
so. Because nothing good happened Saturday after only good had been
happening for so long with this group.</TE>

<KH>PITTSBURGH 34, BALTIMORE 31</KH>
<HD>Steelers Continue Winning, Barely</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Two more turnovers by Tommy Maddox that were converted into
touchdowns. More than 400 yards given up to a team with a losing
record. Another squandered big lead at home.</LD>
<LD>   Somehow, the Pittsburgh Steelers found all this the perfect way to
tune up for next weekend's AFC wild-card playoff game against
Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   The Steelers (10-5-1) rallied from 11 points down in the fourth
quarter with the help of repeated Baltimore penalties and turnovers,
and two Amos Zereoue touchdown runs to defeat the Ravens, 34-31,
Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   The victory didn't mean all that much. Tennessee's 13-3 victory at
Houston gained the Titans (11-5) a first-round playoff bye and meant
the Steelers must play the Browns in the playoffs for only the second
time in their long rivalry. They beat Cleveland, 29-9, in a
divisional round game during the 1994 season.</TE>
<TE>   The Browns (9-7) made the playoffs when they beat Atlanta, 24-16,
Sunday and the Jets (9-7) won the AFC East to eliminate New England
and Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Despite losing the weekend off they wanted and giving up 422 yards
to the NFL's 27th-ranked offense, the Steelers say winning the way
they did can only help them in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not what we wanted coming into this game. But like I've said
all season, this team sticks together and this is a huge momentum
lift," Maddox said. "It's an exciting way to go into the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Even if they can't expect to win that way in the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   "But if you look at our last six games, we played only one bad
one," Coach Bill Cowher said, referring to a 24-6 loss to Houston --
their only defeat during that stretch. "We're going to the playoffs
with a lot of confidence, and we'll see how far that takes us."</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens (7-9) couldn't have been expected to do much on a day
in which they had four turnovers and repeatedly kept Steeler drives
going with third-down penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all that, Baltimore rallied from a 17-7 deficit to take a
31-20 lead in the fourth quarter. Then, despite giving up two quick
Steeler scores, the Ravens nearly won it. But Jeff Blake's first-down
pass from the Steeler 11-yard line into double coverage was
intercepted by Dewayne Washington with 14 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you take a shot, and sometimes it doesn't work out,"
said Raven Coach Brian Billick, whose team missed the playoffs for
the first time in three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Washington jumped over rookie Randy Hymes to make the
interception, which prevented any chance of kicking a tying field
goal.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to get a jump ball -- Washington's 5-foot-10 and Randy
is 6-4, and I'll take that matchup all day," Blake said. "I put it
up, and it turned out the other way."</TE>
<TE>   Raven center Mike Flynn said, "I wanted to go for the win. We had
time to make a couple of throws and if not, then kick the field
goal."</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens looked to be in good shape when Blake's 20-yard
touchdown pass to Chester Taylor made it 31-20 with 12:57 left, 10
plays after Anthony Mitchell's interception.</TE>
<TE>   Before that, James Trapp's interception of a pass fumbled into his
hands by Steeler fullback Dan Kreider led to Blake's 31-yard pass to
tight end Todd Heap that put Baltimore ahead 24-20. Blake completed
19 of 26 passes for 336 yards, with Heap making seven catches for 146
yards.</TE>
<TE>   But the Steelers, who blew 17-point leads in consecutive home
games earlier this season, rallied with Zereoue's five-yard scoring
run midway through the fourth quarter and Maddox's go-ahead
eight-yard scoring pass to Antwaan Randle El with 2:29 left. That
score came after Taylor fumbled away the kickoff after the Zereoue
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox completed 20 of 30 passes for 194 yards and two touchdowns,
including one to Hines Ward for a 23-yard touchdown.</TE>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The San Diego Chargers stayed on the field longer than expected
Sunday, losing 31-28 in overtime to the Seattle Seahawks to stumble
to an 8-8 record.</LD>
<LD>   Now the larger question becomes: How long will the Chargers stay
in San Diego?</LD>
<LD>   Other teams will proceed to the playoffs -- and two will come to
town for the Super Bowl on Jan. 26 -- but the Chargers' next skirmish
will be at City Hall.</LD>
<TE>   Charger owner Alex Spanos and city officials are locked in a
dispute about whether the Chargers will get a new stadium or exercise
an option to seek a new home, possibly Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The politically volatile issue will be debated by the City Council
in early January.</TE>
<TE>   As a finale to Coach Marty Schottenheimer's first campaign in San
Diego, the loss at Qualcomm Stadium before a crowd of 52,159 was a
microcosm of the season: a fast start, a stumbling finish and an
almost inherent inability to make big plays.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, 8-8 is below what we're capable of doing, and I'm
responsible for that," said Schottenheimer, his voice thick with
emotion. "We need to learn how to win and we haven't done that."</TE>
<TE>   Said Pro Bowl-bound running back LaDainian Tomlinson: "It's kind
of like a curse."</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks finished 7-9, with a three-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   After starting 6-1, the Chargers lost seven of their last nine
games and were eliminated from playoff contention before Sunday's
kickoff when the Cleveland Browns beat the Atlanta Falcons, 26-14.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers have now missed the playoffs seven consecutive
seasons -- second only to the Cincinnati Bengals' drought of 12.</TE>
<TE>   After trailing 10-7 at halftime and 28-14 midway through the
fourth quarter, the Seahawks scored on a 19-yard pass from
quarterback Matt Hasselbeck to receiver Koren Robinson. With one
second remaining, Hasselbeck capped an 88-yard, 17-play drive with a
one-yard touchdown plunge to tie the score.</TE>
<TE>   On the Seahawks' second possession of overtime, Rian Lindell
kicked a 24-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Brees completed 27 of 49 passes for 332 yards, including touchdown
passes to Steve Alexander, Eric Parker and Fred McCrary and a
two-point conversion to Reche Caldwell.</TE>
<TE>   Hasselbeck was 36 of 53 for a career-high 449 yards and touchdown
passes to Robinson and Darrell Jackson. Shaun Alexander scored on
two-yard run.</TE>

<LD>Playoff scenarios dominated the final Sunday of the regular season,
but Monday morning hangovers could be coming for coaches whose teams
are staying home for the new year.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Coughlin in Jacksonville, Dave Campo in Dallas, Marty
Mornhinweg in Detroit and Dick LeBeau in Cincinnati all could be
seeking new employment by as early as today.</LD>
<LD>   ESPN.com reported Sunday that Coughlin would be fired and that
former NFL coach Dennis Green, Louisiana State Coach Nick Saban and
Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops were possible replacements, although Jaguar
owner Wayne Weaver denied he had made any decision.</LD>
<TE>   After a 20-13 loss to Indianapolis, Coughlin still had little clue
of where he stands.</TE>
<TE>   "He hasn't given me any indication on what he's thinking,"
Coughlin said of Weaver.</TE>
<TE>   Campo could be the first to go as owner Jerry Jones has done
nothing to hide his two meetings in the last two weeks with Bill
Parcells and a phone conversation he had with Green.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said this has been his "most disappointing year" as an
owner. Asked when a decision will be made on Campo's future, he said:
"Immediately," meaning today or Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Campo won't resort to begging for another chance.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to comment on that," Campo said. "That's Jerry's
decision."</TE>
<TE>   It's also the decision of Detroit owner William Clay Ford Sr. on
whether Mornhinweg -- and for that matter General Manager Matt Millen
-- will return after a 3-13 season.</TE>
<TE>   Mornhinweg also declined to speculate.</TE>
<TE>   LeBeau, on the other hand, could have been speaking for all four
coaches recently.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to coach the team like I'm going to be here forever,"
he told the Columbus Dispatch last week. "And I suppose one of these
days, forever won't be an accurate statement."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Despite a 24-16 loss to Cleveland, Atlanta Falcon quarterback
Michael Vick didn't let that take away from a successful season with
a playoff appearance still to come.</TE>
<TE>   "If you read all the preseason articles being written, people was
predicting us to be 5-11, 6-10, like there's no way this team is
going to make the playoffs," Vick said. "There's no way this young
quarterback will be back there making plays. He won't be able to do
enough because he doesn't have the experience."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati Bengal quarterback Jon Kitna came up six snaps short of
earning a $1.625 million contract bonus. To achieve the bonus, Kitna
needed to have 61 snaps against Buffalo to appear in 80% of
Cincinnati's offensive plays this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Colts' Dwight Freeney had two sacks in a 20-13 victory over
the Jaguars, giving him 13. It's the second-most by a rookie in NFL
history. Jevon Kearse of the Tennessee Titans had 14 1/2 in 1999....
Seattle quarterback Matt Hasselbeck's 36 completions against San
Diego is a team record, breaking the old mark of 33 by Dave Krieg
against Atlanta in 1985.</TE>

<HD>Blatter's Wedding a Surprise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seemed as though FIFA President Sepp Blatter spent the last year
jumping through hoops to win re-election while evading a calendar
full of corruption charges.</LD>
<LD>   Blatter, though, ended the year on a high note, marrying a former
dolphin trainer, a Swiss newspaper reported over the weekend.
According to the daily Blick, Blatter and his bride, Graziella
Bianca, were wed Dec. 23 at a registry office in Blatter's home state
of Valais, which came as a surprise to friends of soccer's most
powerful man.</LD>
<LD>   "It may be unexpected for some people, but for us it's sheer good
fortune," Blatter wrote in a wedding announcement to friends and
family, according to the newspaper.</LD>
<TE>   According to Associated Press, the 40-year-old Bianca is a friend
of Blatter's 39-year-old daughter, Corinne.</TE>
<TE>   Blick also reported that Bianca used to work as spokeswoman and
dolphin trainer at a Swiss entertainment park, Conny Land, before
quitting 18 months ago because she disagreed about how the animals
were treated.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter, 66, has long professed that soccer and FIFA are his main
loves, though this is his third marriage.</TE>
<TE>   The early part of his year was spent under a cloud of suspicion
cast by FIFA's former general secretary Michel Zen-Ruffinen, who
accused Blatter of corruption and mismanagement. But on the eve of
the World Cup, Blatter beat back an election challenge from
Cameroon's Issa Hayatou.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter settled the score after the World Cup when Zen-Ruffinen
and other dissidents were unceremoniously kicked out of FIFA House
and Urs Linzi, a Blatter loyalist and Swiss financial expert, was
appointed general secretary at a FIFA meeting in Madrid in
mid-December.</TE>
<TE>   A Zurich court recently dismissed a criminal complaint against
Blatter filed by disgruntled members of FIFA's executive committee on
the basis of Zen-Ruffinen's allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a very agitated year, a year in which we have spoken
more about sports politics than sport," Blatter told the FIFA meeting
in Madrid. "But now we can end the year with satisfaction and
happiness."</TE>
<TE>   Robinho to Germany?</TE>
<TE>   Bundesliga power Bayern Munich, a former Champions League winner,
is interested in obtaining Robinho, one of Brazil's upcoming stars,
the Munich newspaper Abendzeitung reported Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Robinho, an 18-year-old forward, helped lead Santos to the
Brazilian championship by scoring a goal and setting up two others.</TE>
<TE>   According to Abendzeitung, Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge
scouted Robinho during a recent trip through South America and was
impressed.</TE>
<TE>   Revivo too costly</TE>
<TE>   Haim Revivo's asking price was apparently too much and the Israeli
midfielder's transfer to Hamburger SV has fallen through, a top
official of the Bundesliga club told AP.</TE>
<TE>   "We really wanted to get him and in our offer we went to our
financial limit," said Dietmar Beiersdorfer, Hamburg's sport
director.</TE>
<TE>   Jardel returns</TE>
<TE>   Sporting Lisbon striker Mario Jardel returned to his club with a
bandaged right knee, a limp and no answers from a mishap that he had
while on vacation in his native Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good," Jardel told AP. "I'll only give any further
explanations to my club. Now I'm very tired."</TE>
<TE>   He was also stitched up, according to news reports, after what was
described as a "poolside accident" in a house he owns in Fortaleza, a
city about 1,350 miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro. Portuguese media
reported that Jardel had hit his head on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   AP reported that Jardel received three stitches in his knee and
spent two nights at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Jardel, Europe's top scorer last season, has had a lackluster
season this year after being treated for depression following a
divorce from his wife this summer.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Boomer Brazzle had 20 points and 10 rebounds, and Pepperdine's
quickness and rebounding carried the Waves to an 88-68 victory over
New Mexico in the championship game of the Lobo Invitational Sunday
night at Albuquerque, N.M.</LD>
<LD>   Pepperdine (8-4) never trailed and used scoring runs of 12 and 13
points in each half to defeat the shorter, slower Lobos (4-6).</LD>
<LD>   The Waves consistently scored on fastbreak baskets. Pepperdine had
a 44-31 lead in rebounds, including a 26-9 advantage in the first
half when it built a 44-33 lead.</LD>
<TE>   It was only the 12th time in the 38-year history of the Lobo
Invitational that New Mexico has not won the title.</TE>
<TE>   A three-point basket by walk-on freshman Jeff Hart got New Mexico
within 53-44 with 16:15 left. That rally ended when Mike Westphal,
the son of Pepperdine Coach Paul Westphal, made consecutive
three-point baskets.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves, who are 6-1 on the road this season, scored nine more
points before New Mexico's Mark Walters made a three-pointer. By
then, Pepperdine was in front, 66-47, and the Lobos would get no
closer than 15 points.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Miggins scored 16 points, Alex Acker had 13, and Patten and
Westphal each had 11.</TE>
<TE>   New Mexico was led by Jamaal Williams with a career-high 23
points.</TE>
<TE>   Siena 79, Loyola Marymount 71 -- Prosper Karangwa scored 16
points, including six free throws in the last three minutes, to lead
the Saints (6-3) in a Holiday Stores/Big R Classic tournament game at
Bozeman, Mont.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount (5-7) pulled to within 69-65 on Brandon Worthy's
free throw with 1:56 left. But Siena made six of eight free throws
over the next minute to lead, 75-65, with 55 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Kincade's putback with 16 seconds left cut the margin to
77-71.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Gay led the Lions with 16 points and Worthy had 13.
Siena's Tommy Mitchell led all scorers with 17 points.</TE>

<TE>   WOMEN'S GAMES</TE>
<TE>   UCLA 58, Oregon State 54 -- This might have been the last weekend
the Bruins sneak up on anyone -- at least in the Pacific 10
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins (7-4, 2-0) parlayed 29 points by senior guard Michelle
Greco and a full-court press into a victory at Corvallis, Ore. The
victory ended a five-game losing streak to Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first home loss this season for the Beavers (7-4, 1-1),
who outrebounded the smaller Bruins, 40-34, but were pressured into
26 turnovers, which UCLA converted into 22 points.</TE>
<TE>   Brina Chaney had 15 points for Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon 79, USC 73 -- The Trojans will gladly wave goodbye to the
month of December because there has been nothing jolly about it.</TE>
<TE>   The loss at Eugene, Ore., was the third in a row for USC (5-7,
0-2) and the fifth in seven games this month.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon (5-6, 1-1) survived 25 points and seven rebounds by Ebony
Hoffman because the Trojan junior forward was limited to 26 minutes
because of foul trouble. Junior guard Rometra Craig scored 14 points
for USC, which had a 38-34 lead at the half.</TE>

<KH>TENNESSEE 13, HOUSTON 3</KH>
<HD>Triumphant Return for Titans, Adams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Although it has been six years since owner Bud Adams moved the
Houston Oilers to Tennessee, fans haven't forgotten.</LD>
<LD>   While tailgaters mocked Adams outside Reliant Stadium, the Titans
blocked a punt and field goal and Eddie George scored the game's only
touchdown with 5:14 left as they beat the Houston Texans, 13-3,
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Titans (11-5), already the AFC South champions, gained a
first-round bye with the victory, their 10th in 11 games. The Texans
(4-12) closed out their first NFL season with three consecutive
losses.</LD>
<TE>   Adams, blamed by most fans for moving the Oilers, visited both
locker rooms after the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a business and we had to win this game to be the second seed
in the American Football Conference," Adams said. "Outside of that, I
love the Texans."</TE>
<TE>   A record crowd of 70,694 booed the Titans as they came on the
field to play in Houston for the first time since moving to Tennessee
after the 1996 season. The Oilers spent the franchise's first 37
years in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The Oilers played their last game in Houston on Dec. 15, 1996, in
a 21-13 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in a half-filled Astrodome.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans led 6-3 on Joe Nedney's first-half field goals of 28
and 26 yards. They put together the game's only touchdown drive that
was kept alive by a 53-yard pass from Steve McNair to Drew Bennett to
the Texan 18.</TE>
<TE>   George scored on a four-yard run and finished the game with 102
yards in 25 carries. McNair completed eight of 22 passes for 148
yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt like it could be a field position game we made the plays
at the end of the ball game," Titan Coach Jeff Fisher said. "Any time
you win 10 of 11 games there will be some like this, and we'll take
this."</TE>
<TE>   The Titans scratched out a 6-0 halftime lead on the two field
goals, although Tennessee was outgained in total yards, 159-115, and
in first downs, 9-5, in the first two quarters.</TE>
<TE>   McNair's 36-yard pass to Justin McCareins helped set up Nedney's
28-yarder for a 3-0 first-quarter lead.</TE>
<TE>   Rocky Boiman gave Tennessee a first down at Houston's 22-yard line
when he blocked Chad Stanley's punt in the second quarter, before
Nedney's 26-yarder.</TE>
<TE>   In the third quarter, Texan quarterback David Carr was sacked on
consecutive plays by Kevin Carter and Lance Schulters. Houston
settled for Kris Brown's 42-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Carr completed 21 of 40 passes for 214 yards and one interception.
He was sacked three times, increasing his NFL record for times sacked
to 76 for the season.</TE>

<HD>Bibby Is Happy With Everything but Record</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How's this for some holiday cheer? Coach Henry Bibby, a notorious
perfectionist who's seemingly never happy with the play of his team,
is comfortable with the Trojans as they prepare to open Pacific 10
Conference play Thursday at Washington State.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm happy with where we are," Bibby said of the Trojans, who are
4-3 after losing three senior starters from last year's NCAA
tournament team.</LD>
<LD>   "Of course you'd like to be 7-0. We're not, but we're growing,
getting better and the kids are finding their identity. That's what
you hope for."</LD>
<TE>   And while Bibby wasn't exactly hoping for a better record, he did
say that the Trojans could realistically be 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a chance to beat Missouri and I think we should have won
the game at Rhode Island," he said. The Trojans lost to Missouri,
78-72, after blowing an 11-point second-half lead and suffered a
controversial 73-71 overtime defeat at Rhode Island, where fans ran
onto the court before the game clock expired.</TE>
<TE>   "Santa Barbara beat us," Bibby said. "We played very poorly and
they played well. That's probably the only game that we [truly were
beaten]. They outplayed us in every category. They wanted the game
more than we did so we would have had to play a great game to win
that game and we did not play well in any phase."</TE>
<TE>   Neither have the Gauchos since beating USC, 69-53. They've lost
five straight games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior forward Jerry Dupree, who missed USC's first seven games,
pleased more than himself and teammates by retaining his academic
eligibility, which was in doubt until this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I made my father [Jerry Sr.] proud," he said. "He's happy now
that he doesn't have to worry about his fellas at work hounding him,
asking him if his son's coming back. I'm back now."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby, though, tempered his enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   "He will make us deeper but our next game is in the Pac-10 and
that's no time to experiment," Bibby said. "He has to get in shape --
he's in terrible shape -- and show that he deserves playing time."</TE>

<HD>Trophy Line</HD>
<DH>USC's much-improved offensive front made a difference for
Heisman winner, tailbacks</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DAVIE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Zach Wilson strolled past Heisman trophies in the lobby of USC's
Heritage Hall almost every day for the last five years.</LD>
<LD>   The senior offensive lineman recognized the significance of the
statuettes won by tailbacks Mike Garrett, O.J. Simpson, Charles White
and Marcus Allen, but never really gave them a second look.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks ago, Wilson spent time meticulously examining every
detail of quarterback Carson Palmer's Heisman Trophy upon the
quarterback's return from New York.</LD>
<TE>   "A piece of that thing -- maybe just a body part, a foot -- is
mine," Wilson said. "Every O-lineman on the team can say the same
thing. We all had a part in it."</TE>
<TE>   USC's offensive line, maligned a year ago, matured this season
into one of the best in the Pacific 10 Conference and helped the
fifth-ranked Trojans (10-2) earn a berth in Thursday's Orange Bowl
game against third-ranked Iowa (11-1).</TE>
<TE>   USC's linemen average 6 feet 5 tall and 298 pounds. Iowa's
offensive line averages 6-6, 296 pounds and is regarded as possibly
the best in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans intend to show that they deserve similar praise.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are still some doubts about the line out there,"
junior Eric Torres said. "What better venue to show people than the
Orange Bowl?"</TE>
<TE>   Before the season began, Trojan linemen blamed no one but
themselves for their suspect status.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, virtually the same group of players allowed Palmer to be
sacked 36 times. USC, with an injury-depleted tailback corps, rushed
for a conference-worst 87.7 yards a game, and the Trojans finished a
6-6 season by rushing for one yard in a 10-6 loss to Utah in the Las
Vegas Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't need much more than those numbers to motivate us,"
junior center Norm Katnik said.</TE>
<TE>   This season, the Trojans allowed only 22 sacks, fewest in the
conference. They also increased their rushing average to 133.8 yards
a game, fourth-best in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   The combination helped Palmer pass for 3,639 yards and 32
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "We were hoping we could be the best in sacks [allowed] and get
into the average range in the running game -- we thought that would
be enough to make our passing game really light it up," Coach Pete
Carroll said. "And that's what happened. The pass protection was
pretty much right on the money."</TE>
<TE>   Offensive line coach Tim Davis was a catalyst for the improved
performance. Davis, who was hired last March after five seasons at
Wisconsin, injected a healthy dose of intensity to complement the
more reserved Keith Uperesa, who works with tackles and tight ends.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll and offensive coordinator Norm Chow also modified the way
Palmer operated, eliminating many of the deep drops in favor of
quicker throws from either the pocket or on the roll-out.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the tailback corps remained deep throughout the season.
Malaefou MacKenzie and Sultan McCullough shared the bulk of the
carries before Justin Fargas finally shook a hamstring problem and
started the final five games.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't be where we are if the line didn't come through the
way it did," Palmer said. "They definitely set the tone for the
offense this year."</TE>
<TE>   USC overcame a perceived lack of depth by quickly developing
freshman Winston Justice into a starter at right tackle. The 6-6,
305-pound freshman from Long Beach Poly did not play in the opener
against Auburn, but progressed during a bye week and was thrust into
the lineup against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Justice passed his biggest test when he neutralized national sack
leader Terrell Suggs of Arizona State in the 10th game.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think I have a lot to learn, but I expected to be good
because Coach Carroll put that in my mind when he recruited me," said
Justice, who was named a freshman All-American.</TE>
<TE>   While Justice and junior Jacob Rogers provided stability at
tackle, Torres and senior Derek Graf proved valuable in utility
roles.</TE>
<TE>   Torres started at every position on the line except center. He
played the final three games at left guard after Lenny Vandermade
suffered a torn biceps. Graf started in place of Wilson at right
guard against Auburn. He started at center, then alternated with
Katnik, in the regular-season finale against Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "At the start of the year, I had each guy write down their goals,"
Davis said. "Every one of them wrote the same thing, 'to be the best
O-line in the Pac-10.' That's how you get there. That's what they
did."</TE>
<TE>   Next season, Wilson and Graf will be gone, but redshirts Fred
Matua and Kyle Williams are among the players expected to play
significant roles. The onus on the line will be even greater because
a new quarterback and running backs will be operating behind it.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have starters on the line coming back," Katnik said. "We'll
hit the ground running."</TE>
<TE>   Justice said he would begin thinking about next season after the
Orange Bowl. This year's line, he believes, quietly stirred memories
of Trojan units of the past.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're starting anew, starting our own dynasty," Justice
said. "In 20 years, they're going to look back at 2002 and say, 'That
was a good offensive line. That was the group that started it.' "</TE>

<HD>As Game Nears, Players Say Focus Isn't Getting Soft</HD>

<DL>DAVIE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>USC reached the halfway point in its Orange Bowl stay, and players
said the constant stream of activities has not dulled their
preparation for Thursday night's game against Iowa.</LD>
<LD>   "We're practicing better than we have all year," All-American
safety Troy Polamalu said after Sunday's workout. "Everyone is having
fun, but we're keeping our focus."</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans rode personal watercraft and played volleyball among
other activities during an afternoon beach party in Fort Lauderdale.
They spent part of the evening at an amusement park.</LD>
<TE>   Kyle Williams, a 6-foot-6, 280-pound freshman lineman who is
redshirting, said he enjoyed racing against 6-6, 305-pound tackle
Winston Justice on personal watercraft.</TE>
<TE>   "Winston was going so slow, I was just doing circles around him,"
Williams said after the players returned to their hotel Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, USC played horribly in a 10-6 loss to Utah in the Las
Vegas Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   But Coach Pete Carroll blamed the performance on a poor game plan,
not distracted players.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said Sunday's practice was the best of the week, and
praised the Trojans for their concentration.</TE>
<TE>   "They're doing what they're supposed to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said Iowa's tall offensive line poses challenges for USC
defenders, especially with shifty quarterback Brad Banks operating
behind it.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not the biggest or heaviest, but they're certainly
looming factors," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to play faster than they do. We need to use our speed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ed Orgeron, USC's defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator,
said South Carolina Coach Lou Holtz did not speak to him on Saturday
regarding the Gamecocks' defensive coordinator position.</TE>
<TE>   Holtz, who attended practice, has not chosen a defensive
coordinator to replace Charlie Strong, who left South Carolina this
week to fill the same position at Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy here," Orgeron said. "There's good things in my future
with this program."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Grant Mattos missed part of practice after slightly
straining an abdominal muscle.... The Trojans are scheduled to attend
tonight's NBA game between the Miami Heat and Atlanta Hawks.</TE>

<HD>Lion Changes Could Start at the Top</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The Minnesota Vikings and Detroit Lions provided proof that all
losing seasons are not the same. While the Vikings finished strong,
the Lions sank.</LD>
<LD>   Daunte Culpepper threw two touchdown passes and ran for another
score as the Vikings held on to defeat the Lions, 38-36, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Vikings (6-10) ended the season with a three-game winning
streak to surpass last season's victory total by one, ensuring that
Coach Mike Tice will be back for a second season. Minnesota lost its
first four to start the season.</LD>
<TE>   "It may not mean a lot to a lot of people, but being able to
finish with one more win than last year gives you something that you
can reach out and touch," Tice said. "We probably are a little bit
better than our record. I don't think we're a 6-10 team."</TE>
<TE>   The Lions (3-13) also improved on last season's 2-14 record, but
that won't be much consolation to Coach Marty Mornhinweg or chief
executive Matt Millen. Detroit lost its final eight games and put
together the worst two-season stretch (5-27) in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   Owner William Clay Ford Sr. said he will decide whether Mornhinweg
and Millen will be back for a third season. Millen was expected to
talk by phone with Ford, who is vacationing in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Mornhinweg, a head coach for the first time at any level, was
asked why he should be back.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not answering those questions," he said. "But I will say this
franchise is primed for some success."</TE>
<TE>   As they've often done during the Millen-Mornhinweg era, the Lions
came close to winning.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Anderson's 18-yard field goal put the Vikings ahead by eight
with 1:09 left, but Mike McMahon's third touchdown pass -- a
19-yarder to Scotty Anderson -- got Detroit within two with 13
seconds left. The Vikings won when McMahon's two-point conversion
pass was incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   McMahon was 19 for 44 for 293 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's Michael Bennett ran for 82 yards and finished with the
second-highest total (1,296) in team history.</TE>

<PH>ROSE BOWL * WASHINGTON STATE vs. OKLAHOMA</PH>
<KH>WASHINGTON STATE REPORT</KH>
<HD>There's a Real Catch to These Cougars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They don't number as many as the Fab Five receivers from the 1997
Washington State team that played in the Rose Bowl, but this Cougar
team has a trio of receivers that is almost as difficult to cover.</LD>
<LD>   Devard Darling, Mike Bush and Jerome Riley have combined for 145
receptions, 2,216 yards and 23 touchdowns.</LD>
<LD>   "There's nothing more you can ask for than three big-play
receivers," quarterback Jason Gesser said.</LD>
<TE>   "Big" is the key word. Bush is 6 feet 6. Darling is 6-3, and Riley
is 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Each of them has at least 48 receptions, and all of them average
more than 14 yards a catch.</TE>
<TE>   One of the remarkable things about the group is how the receivers
are willing to share the receptions, when any one of them would have
bigger numbers if one of the others weren't around.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I felt like I came in from Florida State and didn't
know what to expect," said Darling, who has tied the school record
for receiving touchdowns in a season with 11 in his first season
after transferring.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't really matter. They accepted me. The whole team
accepted me.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a family atmosphere."</TE>
<TE>   The way Bush sees it, having each other around is an advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's real hard for them to double team one of us and leave the
others open," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State cornerback Jason David figures the Oklahoma
secondary, led by Andre Woolfolk, will be kept busy.</TE>
<TE>   "We go against each other all the time, and I get a look at a guy
who's 6-6 like Bush, as good as Devard, or runs routes like Riley,"
David said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of hard on a defense to stop all our receivers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the coaching staff in transition, new Coach Bill Doba must
try to keep the recruiting class from splintering because of Mike
Price's departure for Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Price can no longer urge recruits to stick with Washington State
because of NCAA rules that a coach can't represent two institutions,
and Doba is limited by the designated recruiting period surrounding
the bowls that allows only one phone call to a recruit a week.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we'll hold on to most of them, but you never really know
until signing day," Doba said.</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle Times reported Carl Bonnell, a quarterback from
Kentwood, Wash., who was expected to enter Washington State in
January, paused to consider the University of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Doba already has taken care of a couple of other issues in the
coaching transition, retaining Mike Levenseller as offensive
coordinator and promoting defensive line coach Robb Akey to defensive
coordinator, a position Doba held under Price.</TE>
