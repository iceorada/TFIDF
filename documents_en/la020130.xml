<HD>Ford Has Designs on Revitalizing Mercury Lineup</HD>
<DH>Seeking to fashion a new identity for the brand, the firm
breaks new ground by naming an exclusive design chief for the unit.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time in its 63-year history, Ford Motor Co.'s Mercury
brand has its own design chief.</LD>
<LD>   His appointment won't be formally announced until next week, but
officials at Lincoln Mercury say the job has been handed to Darrell
Behmer.</LD>
<LD>   The 40-year-old Behmer previously was chief of design at Ford's
large and luxury car center. Before that, he was head designer at
Ford's Advanced Design Studio in Dearborn, Mich. He will report to
Gerry McGovern, design chief for Lincoln.</LD>
<TE>   Behmer is a graduate of the College of Creative Studies in
Detroit--Michigan's answer to Pasadena's Art Center College of
Design--and the place that produces many of the car designers who
find employment with the traditional Big Three auto makers (Art
Center graduates work in Michigan too, but are most prevalent in the
West Coast design studios of Asian and European car makers).</TE>
<TE>   Behmer's job at Mercury will be to develop a distinctive image for
what has become an orphan brand--lost in the gap between the Ford's
everyman products and Lincoln's luxury vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   There were persistent rumblings in the automotive press last year
that Mercury was destined to follow Plymouth and Oldsmobile into
oblivion.</TE>
<TE>   But Lincoln Mercury officials have insisted that reports of the
marque's demise were erroneous. This month, Ford Chairman William
Clay Ford Jr. revealed that his cousin, Elena Ford, is the new brand
manager for Mercury. He assured reporters that he likes his cousin
and wasn't setting her up for a fall with the new job. Ford also has
told global marketing chief Jan Klug to come up with a plan for
fixing Mercury.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders say Behmer's appointment as chief designer for the brand
is further proof of the marque's staying power.</TE>
<TE>   Mercury will lose the Cougar sports coupe and Villager minivan
this year, but it is scheduled for a replacement minivan as a 2004
model.</TE>
<TE>   And decisions are being made on proposals for a new
sport-utility/minivan crossbreed, a high-roofed sedan with truck-like
seating height, and the possible revival of the Cougar using a
platform shared with the next-generation Mustang from Ford.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfgang Reitzle, head of Ford's Premier Automotive Group--which
includes Lincoln as a member but so far sees Mercury as a mere camp
follower--says Mercury is the ideal brand to let Ford fully use its
production capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Upgrade the interior, redesign the front and rear ends and add a
few Mercury-only design touches that could include special wheels and
trim, and the Ford becomes a more expensive Merc with relatively
little new investment by the company.</TE>
<TE>   Dodging GM Bullet</TE>
<TE>   The upcoming overhaul of General Motors Corp.'s design process
isn't expected to do much harm to GM's Advanced Design Studio in
North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The 2-year-old center, headed by former Volkswagen designer Frank
Saucedo, has a staff of 40, including designers, model makers and
support staff.</TE>
<TE>   Saucedo says that although he hasn't been made privy to details,
he's been told that his group shouldn't worry.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, GM is expected to trim about 400 positions from a
worldwide design staff of 1,200. Many of the targeted jobs, though,
probably will be middle-management level--the infamous GM bureaucracy
that is best known for slowing down things.</TE>
<TE>   GM product development guru Bob Lutz, who ordered the overhaul of
the design process, also is expected to get rid of the company's
seven brand-specific design centers and its Advanced Portfolio
Exploration group, or APEX, in favor of a system that pits teams of
designers in competitions to develop new vehicles for the various GM
marques.</TE>
<TE>   Saucedo's studio was not part of the brand-specific system and has
only two APEX group members, who also have other research and staff
development duties that shouldn't be affected by the shake-up, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lutz, a big fan of speed in the product development process, has
lauded the North Hollywood studio for designing and building the new
Pontiac Solstice convertible concept in just 15 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The sporty Solstice won rave reviews when unveiled this month at
the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Moving up at BMW</TE>
<TE>   Designworks USA, BMW's advanced-design facility in Newbury Park,
has appointed Christopher V. Chapman to head its automotive design
team.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman, who joined Designworks in 1994, replaces Adrian van
Hooydonk, who late last year became president of the company.
Chapman, who designed the exterior of the BMW X5 "sport-activity
vehicle" and did the exterior of the X-Coupe concept shown at the
Detroit auto show last year, recently returned to Southern California
from a two-year assignment at BMW's central studio in Munich.</TE>
<TE>   Although about half its income comes from automotive work for BMW,
Designworks also does industrial, product, packaging and
transportation equipment design.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman, 36, will head a team of designers and model makers in the
automotive unit. He is a graduate of the Art Center College of Design
and worked for American Isuzu Motors before joining BMW.</TE>

<HD>Toyota Ends Internet Sales of  Prius Hybrid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. said it is ending its Internet-only sales
program for the Prius hybrid sedan after 18 months and will begin
placing the cars in dealer showrooms.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes as Toyota is boosting sales projections for the
gas-electric hybrid and as American Honda Motor Co. prepares to begin
selling a competing five-passenger Civic hybrid through its
dealership network. Both vehicles should be in dealerships by April.</LD>
<LD>   The online selling program for the Prius was intended to boost
interest in the compact, which combines a small gas engine with an
electric motor for improved fuel economy and low emissions.</LD>
<TE>   Toyota sold 15,556 Priuses last yearand hopes to sell  18,000 this
year. The car carries a suggested retail price of $19,995 and sells
for $20,450 with destination fee.</TE>
<TE>   Honda has not set pricing for the hybrid Civic but has said it
expects it to sell for under $20,000. Honda has set an annual U.S.
sales target of 25,000 to 30,000 Civic hybrids.</TE>
<TE>   Cleaner Focus</TE>
<TE>   From Ford</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co. says it has developed gasoline vapor recovery
technologies that will enable it to meet California's
zero-evaporative-emissions standard next year with one model of its
Focus compact.</TE>
<TE>   That's not the same as zero emissions, but it does mean that
gasoline won't evaporate out of the car's fuel tank when it is parked
in the sun.</TE>
<TE>   The California Air Resources Board says that as gasoline engines
get cleaner, evaporative emissions are becoming one of the biggest
components of auto-related air pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan Motor Co., which so far is the only car maker with a
California-certified zero evaporative emissions vehicle, says its
Sentra CA produces fewer total emissions during a 20-mile round-trip
commute than today's typical new vehicle does while parked in a
driveway all day with the engine off. That's because the Sentra CA
combines its ultra-low-emission engine with a special fuel-line trap
that captures escaping fuel vapors in a special filter before they
hit the atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Division President James O'Connor said the four-cylinder
Focus will use a similar system. And that means that it, like the
Sentra CA, would qualify for so-called P-ZEV status under
California's standards.</TE>
<TE>   The P-ZEV vehicles earn "partial-ZEV" credits the auto makers can
use to reduce the number of zero-emission vehicles they will have to
produce.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the only full ZEV vehicles are battery-powered electric
cars and trucks, which auto makers say are impractical and must be
heavily subsidized to sell.</TE>
<TE>   Honda and Toyota also are expected to field P-ZEV candidates soon.</TE>

<HD>Indian Completes Comeback With Its Own V-Twin Engine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Indian Motorcycle Corp. says it will complete its journey back into
the marketplace this year with the introduction of the 2002 Chief,
outfitted with the first Indian-designed engine in 45 years.</LD>
<LD>   The new 100-cubic-inch V-twin was engineered at Indian's
headquarters in Gilroy, Calif.--near Monterey--and is being built by
a custom-engine manufacturing contractor in Livonia, Mich.</LD>
<LD>   The new Chief, due in dealerships this spring, will be the
flagship of Indian's line, which includes the sport-styled Spirit and
the cruiser-styled Scout. Both models will continue using the
88-cubic-inch engine Indian has been buying from Wisconsin motorcycle
engine maker S&amp;S Cycle Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Indian, headed by former HBO Video President Frank O'Connell, is a
resurrection of the original Indian Motorcycle Co., which built the
first American-made, mass-produced motorcycle in 1901 and went out of
business in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   The new Indian was started in 1998 and began selling motorcycles
in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   By using an engine of its own design, Indian regains the original
equipment manufacturer (OEM) status that went to the grave with its
predecessor.</TE>
<TE>   The new Powerplus 100 engine replicates the design of the original
Indian V-Twin, with rounded cylinder heads and serrated rocker
covers, but uses modern technologies  such as computerized electronic
ignition.</TE>
<TE>   Indian has not set pricing for the new Chief, but the 2001 model,
with the smaller S&amp;S engine, carried a suggested retail price of
$23,995.</TE>

<HD>Soft Prices for Used Cars Don't Mean Deals for Everyone</HD>
<DH>Market* Despite a glut of late-model vehicles, only car
dealers and customers with nothing to trade-in are likely to see much
of an upside in the situation, industry specialists say .</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumers who raced to take advantage of the auto industry's discount
financing and cash incentives for new cars in the last quarter of
2001 flooded the market with late-model used cars, helping create a
glut that has sent used-car prices into a dramatic downward slide.</LD>
<LD>   But before you pick up a speeding ticket hurrying down to auto
row, consider: The situation doesn't mean fantastic deals for
everyone--indeed, only car dealers and customers with no trade-in are
likely to see much of an upside in the situation, auto pricing
specialists say.</LD>
<LD>   The reason? As both new and used vehicle prices soften, so does
the value of cars that shoppers hope to use for trade-ins.</LD>
<TE>   "You can still cherry-pick to find bargains, but the system is
self-adjusting and there are no free lunches," said Jeremy Anwyl,
president of Internet auto shopping service Edmunds.com.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers
Assn., said the used-car glut already is showing signs of drying
up--in part because the new-car sales that generate trade-ins for the
used-car lots are expected to fall by a million or so units this
year.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, for used-car shoppers, it's "a really good time
if you don't need [the proceeds from] a trade-in, and even if you do,
you can probably realize a small savings" over what the same vehicle
would have cost you six months ago, said Jim Hossack, an industry
analyst with AutoPacific Inc. in Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   Edmunds.com, which tracks some 50,000 new- and used-car
transactions a week, searched its databanks for Highway 1 and found
that with the exception of low-volume luxury cars, classic vehicles
and routinely high-value used cars such as the Honda Accord, prices
for late-model used cars have dropped 10% to 15% since August.</TE>
<TE>   A parent buying a used car for a child heading off to
college--often the kind of deal that doesn't involve a
trade-in--could save thousands of dollars now by going after that
late-model Toyota, BMW or Jeep.</TE>
<TE>   A 2000 Toyota Camry LE sedan that would have sold for $13,638 in
August, for instance, was worth an average of $11,888 at the
beginning of this month, according to Jeff Huang, Edmunds.com's
used-car pricing manager. The savings now over then would be $1,750.</TE>
<TE>   But if buying the 2000 Camry is dependent on selling a 1996
Camry--a likely trade-in vehicle for a family of Toyota loyalists
looking for a newer model--the equation changes.</TE>
<TE>   The 1996 Camry lost 18% of its value in the same period, dropping
to $6,693 from August's price of $8,136.</TE>
<TE>   So back in August, the difference between the two Toyotas, or the
effective price of the 2000 model, was $5,475.</TE>
<TE>   In early January, the difference was almost the same:
$5,195--representing a savings of just $280.</TE>

<HD>Probe: Auto Body Fraud Rampant</HD>
<DH>State investigation of the industry finds widespread
quality and billing problems. A whopping 43% of cars inspected had
overcharges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH VARTABEDIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investigators for the state of California say a probe of the auto
body industry is finding widespread billing fraud and repair defects,
confirming their worst expectations of collision repair shops across
the state.</LD>
<LD>   An inspection program initiated last summer by the Bureau of
Automotive Repair has found that billing for 43% of cars inspected so
far after being repaired had evidence of fraud, with an average of
$586 in overcharges for parts not used or labor not performed.</LD>
<LD>   The preliminary results of the 18-month investigation will be
disclosed today in a state Senate Insurance Committee hearing chaired
by Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough).</LD>
<TE>   "They are uncovering big problems," Speier said in a recent
interview. "There is a systemic virus that is plaguing the repair of
vehicles in California. It is alarming, since it is fairly well-known
in the industry that this inspection program is happening."</TE>
<TE>   If the inspection program represents a valid random sampling of
the industry's performance, it would mean that both consumers and
automobile insurers are paying enormous sums of money to an
apparently widespread criminal enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance industry pays out about $3.2 billion for body
repairs in California at the estimated rate of $2,843 a claim,
according to industry figures.</TE>
<TE>   If BAR's survey figures are correct, the $586 average overcharge
amounts to a 20% fraud premium on every repair bill.</TE>
<TE>   Speier said she intends to sponsor legislation this year to
improve consumer protection involving auto body repairs and the
largely unregulated trade in repaired wrecks.</TE>
<TE>   The inspection program was launched amid mounting evidence of auto
body repair fraud against both consumers and insurance companies over
the last several years.</TE>
<TE>   BAR first asserted that auto body fraud was a serious problem in a
1994 report that documented a long list of unsafe repairs, fraudulent
billings and inadequate training in the auto body industry.</TE>
<TE>   The 1994 report cited insurance industry surveys that found 95% of
the shops in some areas were not competent, lacked necessary
equipment and employed poorly trained technicians. In a Senate
Insurance Committee hearing in 2000, BAR reiterated its position that
40% of repairs involved fraud.</TE>
<TE>   One basis for BAR's concern is the fairly large number of cases
its investigators file--about 400 allegations of consumer fraud and
other violations every year against the state's repair shops,
including mechanical garages. In most cases, the agency revokes the
shop's licenses. In 180 cases in 2000, it sought criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   But the auto body industry has sharply disputed assertions that
its members are systemically defrauding the public. The California
Auto Body Assn., which represents just 800 of the state's 5,500 body
shops, said BAR's allegations are unfair and that the agency doesn't
have any hard evidence to prove them.</TE>
<TE>   The current inspection program, mandated by legislation sponsored
by Speier last year, is an effort to get a better assessment. Since
July, BAR has been conducting free inspections of repaired cars at
the owners' request.</TE>
<TE>   "BAR is the only agency that makes house calls," Speier said.
(Consumers can request free inspections by calling 866-881-1332.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the agency has inspected 507 vehicles that qualify under
the rules of the program and found 217 with evidence of fraud,
typically billing by the repair shop for parts that were not used or
labor that was not supplied.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, about 13% of the repaired vehicles had structural issues
that would indicate inadequate or defective repairs to car frames,
said Dan Povey, manager of BAR's auto body program. Those
inadequacies included improper welds and failure to rust-proof key
parts.</TE>
<TE>   Povey said the inspection program did not include putting the
vehicles on frame racks to see whether frames were out of alignment,
but suggested that there are problems there as well.</TE>
<TE>   "You can bet that there is a high percentage of misalignment,"
based on visual abnormalities, Povey said.</TE>
<TE>   Speier said the insurance industry has ratcheted down what it is
willing to pay for repairs by "steering" consumers to specific shops
in so-called directed repair programs that are sponsored by each
company.</TE>
<TE>   That repair shops then "start cutting corners, billing for parts
that aren't on the vehicle, shouldn't be any surprise," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Speier said her legislative agenda would be shaped by today's
hearing, which is scheduled to include testimony from BAR, the
Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Highway Patrol. Among
related issues to be examined is the widespread problem of vehicles
that have been declared total wrecks being recycled into the used-car
market without bearing salvage titles as required by state law.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, car buyers often have no warning that they are buying
a former wrecked vehicle. And under present state law, repaired
wrecks face only a cursory brake and lamp inspection.</TE>
<TE>   DMV estimates that 7% of all vehicles on the road in California
have been previously "totaled" by insurers.</TE>
<TE>   Speier said she wants to examine a more stringent inspection
program that would include making sure cars' frames are structurally
sound and properly aligned. She also said she would like to examine
whether public access to salvage auctions, where such totaled
vehicles are sold, should be limited. Another issue is whether the
so-called salvage title branding law, which is weaker than in many
other states, should be toughened.</TE>
<TE>   "The state in protecting public health and safety has to do a
better job," she said. "We are cracking down on fraud that is going
on."</TE>

<LD>Oh yes! The new cars look great, and the concept cars--I'm ready to
have one grace my driveway (Highway 1, Jan. 16). But one problem, and
it's bothered me for some time: Why are manufacturers still making
cars that can speed to twice the limit in most states?</LD>
<LD>   Seems to me we could do without a 4.6-liter aluminum 32-valve
Northstar V-8 engine that is available with 275 or 300 horsepower, in
favor of a car with a top speed of 75 mph if it really looks great.</LD>
<LD>   And in the hands of some freeway drivers, a car at 65 mph is too
dangerous. We know speed kills, so why make cars that endanger lives?
I don't need the horsepower. Do any of us?</LD>

<TE>   A surcharge on the new 350Z? Why not! It is rare to find a

If the dealer is expected to discount his/her product when that

entitled to a surcharge when supplies dip?</TE>

<HD>Director Diversity Seen as Lacking</HD>
<DH>Studios and production companies lag in hiring female and
minority directors for prime-time shows, a DGA study says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although the four major TV networks have repeatedly cited their
commitment to increase diversity in front of and behind the camera,
studios and production companies have not followed through in regard
to minority and female directors on prime-time series, according to a
Directors Guild of America study being released today.</LD>
<LD>   The report, which examined the 40 most popular series of the
2000-2001 season, reported that about 80% of drama and comedy
episodes--or 663 of the 826 installments--were directed by white
males.</LD>
<LD>   Black males directed 27 episodes, or about 3% of the total, while
Latino males directed 15 episodes, or about 2%. Asian American males
directed nine episodes.</LD>
<TE>   White females directed 87--or 11%--of the episodes. Asian American
females directed two episodes, but no other female minorities were
credited.</TE>
<TE>   Series employing multiple directors that did not hire either
minority or female directors last season include NBC's "Friends" and
"The Drew Carey Show," produced by Warner Bros. Television; and NBC's
"Law &amp; Order," from Studios USA Television, the study reported.</TE>
<TE>   "Friends," "Law &amp; Order," Fox's "Malcolm in the Middle" and CBS'
"Everybody Loves Raymond" were also singled out as the four "worst
offenders" in terms of hiring minorities and women for the current
season.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody Loves Raymond" and "Malcolm in the Middle" have not
hired either female or minority directors this season. "Friends" has
employed a minority director for one episode, and "Law &amp; Order" has
hired a female director for one.</TE>
<TE>   "The fanfare we've had for the last couple of years with TV
executives saying they were committed to change are not reflected in
the numbers we see," said Rodney Mitchell, assistant executive
director of the DGA.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, we have not seen meaningful improvement in the
hiring of minority and women directors for television or in film.
This is just not acceptable to us."</TE>
<TE>   Emmy Award winner Paris Barclay, who has directed several episodes
of "NYPD Blue, "ER" and "The West Wing," said, "I'm really surprised
by the number of shows that don't have any diversity at all. And what
really shocks me is that not one African American female director has
directed a top 40 show. I can name 10--some with Oscar
nominations--who are not even considered."</TE>
<TE>   Among other high-profile series, CBS' "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation," from Alliance Atlantis and CBS Productions, and Fox's
"The X-Files," from 20th Century Fox Television, hired one minority
director and no female directors for episodes last season.</TE>
<TE>   CBS' "Becker," from Paramount, "Malcolm in the Middle" (from
Regency Television in association with Fox) and NBC's "Providence"
(from NBC Studios) were among shows that hired a single female
director and no minorities. ABC's "The Practice," another 20th
Century Fox production, hired one female director and one minority
director.</TE>
<TE>   Executives for "Law &amp; Order" and "Malcolm in the Middle" declined
to comment. Producers from Fox and Warner Bros. did not return phone
calls.</TE>
<TE>   "These numbers are terrible and embarrassing," veteran film and TV
director Martha Coolidge said. "Why is it happening? It's called
discrimination. It's called comfort level. People don't change easily
until they have to."</TE>
<TE>   The study indicates that a significant pool of experienced
minority and female directors is being overlooked, Mitchell said,
adding that training programs--including a program that prepares
directors for work on single-camera shows--are developing even more
worthy candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "There are plenty of women and minorities who can step in and take
on assignments," Mitchell said, placing most of the blame on studios
supplying programs to the networks, as opposed to the networks
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "The guild has conducted several meetings with networks and
production companies, and they all reaffirm their commitment to
diversity. Still, the results that we see are very disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, many of the series listed in the report as being
negligent in hiring minorities or women--including "Law &amp; Order,"
"The Practice," and "Malcolm in the Middle"--have been repeatedly
praised for casting minorities in key roles.</TE>
<TE>   Said Barclay, "I really don't understand 'Law &amp; Order.' I've
always wanted to direct an episode, but I cannot get a meeting with
the producers.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand that show runners want to work with people they're
comfortable with. What we're asking is for an opportunity for them to
be comfortable with others."</TE>
<TE>   Programs that had more than five episodes directed by minorities
or females include NBC's "Frasier" (Paramount), NBC's "Just Shoot Me"
(Universal Pictures), ABC's "My Wife and Kids" (Touchstone
Television), NBC's "Three Sisters" (NBC Studios) and NBC's "Third
Watch" (Warner Bros.).</TE>
<TE>   Because the report encompassed only the 40 most-watched programs,
series from cable or the fledgling WB and UPN broadcast networks were
not examined.</TE>
<TE>   Barclay and Mitchell said they plan to sit down soon with series
producers to discuss strategies that will result in the hiring of
more female and minority directors. Mitchell said he hopes to see
improvement when directing assignments are handed out this summer for
next season.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Opera Sets 2002-03 Season</HD>
<DH>The Arts*  Artistic director Placido Domingo cites Sept. 11
as a cause for some schedule changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When tenor Placido Domingo unveiled his plans as new artistic
director of Los Angeles Opera in September 2000, he announced an
ambitious, multiyear growth strategy for the 2001-02 season and
beyond.</LD>
<LD>   Among his plans: to present a world premiere each season starting
in 2002-03, including a new opera by Luciano Berio starring Domingo
in the story of his own life in 2002-03, and major
entertainment-industry collaborations, including the company's
first-ever "Ring" cycle, to be presented at Shrine Auditorium with
special effects by George Lucas' Industrial Light &amp; Magic.</LD>
<LD>   But the 2002-03 opera season, announced Tuesday at the Music
Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion--the second season to be
programmed under Domingo's leadership--shows as much caution as
ambition, realizing some goals and scaling back others.</LD>
<TE>   "The events of Sept. 11 caused us to lose almost half a million
dollars on the first three shows [of the 2001-02 season], with people
being afraid to come to the theater for the moment," Domingo said
Tuesday in an interview with The Times. "But now, sales are back to
normal; both 'The Merry Widow' and the Bach Mass in B minor [opening
Saturday] will exceed expectations [in ticket sales], so this is
happy news."</TE>
<TE>   As previously announced, the "Ring," estimated to cost as much as
$60 million, has been pushed from spring 2003 to 2006. Domingo said
the new plan is to present the entire cycle in the late spring and
early summer, rather than spreading its four works over two seasons.
"All at once, this will make us save money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fund-raising for the cycle is ongoing; Domingo says the project
will likely be co-produced in Hong Kong.</TE>
<TE>   Though the postponement of the "Ring" represents the biggest
retooling of plans, the 2002-03 program includes other changes.</TE>
<TE>   The company will fulfill Domingo's promise to present one world
premiere per season--with Berio's new orchestration of Monteverdi's
"The Coronation of Poppea," with Domingo and Frederica von Stade
performing, Jan. 11-19, 2003. However, the opera will be presented in
concert form, rather than as a fully staged production. Domingo said
the composer suffered an accident and so was behind in delivering the
new orchestration. The new Berio opera about Domingo's life,
originally announced for 2002-03, is now on for 2006.</TE>
<TE>   While the 2002-03 schedule features no entirely new operas,
Domingo said that plans remain in place for new work in upcoming
seasons, including a new composition by former New York City Opera
composer-in-residence Deborah Drattell, to be conducted by Mstislav
Rostropovich, for 2003-04; one by John Williams in 2004-05; and a new
production in 2005-06 from director Julie Taymor and composer Elliot
Goldenthal. Domingo defended the opera company's commitment to new
commissions by saying that such projects take time to develop.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002-03 season does include one new production originating in
Los Angeles: "Don Giovanni," scheduled for May 31-June 22, 2003. The
director and cast are still to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   The season also includes two company premieres: Verdi's "Nabucco"
and Prokofiev's massive "War and Peace"; neither will originate with
L.A. Opera. "Nabucco" is a production purchased from Lyric Opera of
Chicago, and "War and Peace" is a Kirov production, with casting yet
to be specified, that also opens at the Met next month. The upcoming
season's "Tales of Hoffman" is also a co-production, directed by
Marta Domingo, with Washington Opera (where Placido Domingo serves as
artistic director) and the Kirov.</TE>
<TE>   The opera will open its season Sept. 4 with a gala performance of
Puccini's "Girl of the Golden West," a Bonn Opera production new to
L.A. Opera, starring Domingo and Catherine Malfitano, with baritone
Falk Struckmann and conductor Simone Young, music director of
Sydney's Opera Australia, making their company debuts.</TE>
<TE>   Two revivals are on the agenda: "The Barber of Seville," Feb.
7-23, 2003; and Taymor's restaging of her controversial 1995
production of "The Flying Dutchman," March 22-April 8, 2003. Von
Stade will appear in a recital, June 15, 2003.</TE>

<HD>Feather Adds Witty Lyrics to Waller Instrumentals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jazz can be thankful for dreamers--artists such as Lorraine Feather
who refuse to allow their artistic visions to be tainted by the
demand of commerce. On Monday night at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, Feather
(daughter of the late Times jazz critic Leonard Feather) performed a
set of songs that were--in concept, at least--as esoteric as they
were entertaining.</LD>
<LD>   But just imagine what the reaction might have been if Feather had
taken that concept into a pitch meeting at a major record company.
"What?" I can hear one of the suits saying, "You want to do an album
in which you write a bunch of lyrics for Fats Waller instrumentals?
You're kidding, right?"</LD>
<LD>   Feather wasn't kidding, however, and actually managed to have the
songs released in a collection titled "New York City Drag" on the
Rhombus label. The good news is that it's receiving a surprising
amount of airplay (a tribute to public radio); the downside is that
it's not likely to turn up on Billboard's Top 200 chart.</LD>
<TE>   The best part is that Feather did it at all, that she applied her
witty way with a lyric to a set of vocalese numbers arching through
the stunning complexities of Waller's piano lines. On her menu:
familiar tunes such as "Fractious Fingering" (retitled "Jukebox" in
Feather's version) and "Smashing Thirds" (retitled "Cezanne"), as
well the less familiar "Gladyse" (whimsically retitled "Gal on the
Side/She's Gettin' Some") and "Numb Fumblin'" (retitled "In Living
Black and White").</TE>
<TE>   Feather not only composed this daunting collection of lyrics,
filled with tricky inner rhymes, offbeat stories and sardonic
references, she also sang them with astonishing vocal dexterity.</TE>
<TE>   Accompanied by pianist Shelly Berg (who bravely and brilliantly
managed the Waller-referenced backings and interludes), bassist Chuck
Berghofer and drummer Greg Field, she offered an evening that was as
poetic as it was musical.</TE>
<TE>   The only flaw in an otherwise marvelous program, in fact, was the
tendency of the slightly over-weighted instrumental sound to bury
some of Feather's rapidly paced phrases--every one of which warranted
close hearing. But that's a minor carp for a performance that was a
rare and wonderful example of what can happen when an artist with
Feather's talents decides that a work worth doing is worth doing,
regardless of its commercial potential.</TE>

<HD>'Mind' and 'Bedroom' Top SAG Nominees</HD>
<DH>Awards*  Among surprises are Kevin Kline and Sean Penn as
contenders for outstanding actor.</DH>

<LD>"A Beautiful Mind" and "In the Bedroom" each received three
nominations Tuesday for the Screen Actors Guild awards. The casts of
both films were nominated along with "Beautiful Mind's" Russell Crowe
and Jennifer Connelly, and "In the Bedroom's" Sissy Spacek and Tom
Wilkinson.</LD>
<LD>   There were several surprises among the feature film nominations.
Kevin Kline for "Life as a House" and Sean Penn for "I Am Sam"--both
considered dark horses--received outstanding actor nods. Wilkinson,
who was shut out of the Golden Globes for "In the Bedroom," also
received an outstanding actor nomination. And Dakota Fanning, Penn's
7-year-old co-star in "I Am Sam," received a nomination for
outstanding female actor in a supporting role.</LD>
<LD>   Another surprise was the nomination of Connelly, who won the best
supporting actress Golden Globe for "A Beautiful Mind," in the
outstanding female actor category. A SAG spokesperson said that
Universal submitted Connelly in this category. Last year, Benicio Del
Toro, who won the Golden Globe and the Oscar for best supporting
actor for "Traffic," also found himself competing in the outstanding
actor category for the Steven Soderbergh film. Del Toro ended up
winning the SAG award over Tom Hanks for "Cast Away" and Crowe for
"Gladiator."</LD>
<TE>   Judi Dench was nominated in two feature film categories--for
female actor in a lead role for "Iris" and for female actor in a
supporting role for "The Shipping News."</TE>
<TE>   Notably missing in the feature film category was Gene Hackman for
"The Royal Tenenbaums." Hackman recently received a Golden Globe, the
AFI Award and the National Society of Film Critics honor for the
offbeat dark comedy. Another Golden Globe winner, Nicole Kidman, also
failed to receive a nomination from her peers for either "Moulin
Rouge," for which she received the Globe for best actress in a comedy
or musical, or "The Others," for which she received a Golden Globe
nomination for best actress in a drama.</TE>
<TE>   Other performers absent from the list of nominees include Will
Smith for "Ali," Billy Bob Thornton for "The Man Who Wasn't There"
and "Monster's Ball," Naomi Watts for "Mulholland Drive," Marisa
Tomei for "In the Bedroom," Kate Winslet for "Iris" and Steve Buscemi
for "Ghost World."</TE>
<TE>   In the SAG TV categories, "The Sopranos," "Six Feet Under," "The
West Wing," "Sex &amp; the City," "Everybody Loves Raymond," "Frasier"
and "Will &amp; Grace" are among the series with multiple nominations.</TE>
<TE>   Two randomly selected panels that represent 4,200 SAG members
selected this year's nominees.</TE>
<TE>   Approximately 98,000 members of the guild will vote on all acting
categories.</TE>
<TE>   The SAG Awards will be presented March 10 in Los Angeles in a
two-hour ceremony to be televised on TNT.</TE>

<LD>All the pregame hype and computer-enhanced analysis notwithstanding,
the Super Bowl isn't really about football these days, any more than
the Olympics are about skiing.</LD>
<LD>   Sports have long been heralded as the purest form of human drama,
which may explain why television couldn't resist sinking its hooks
into them. So as we head into this Sunday's big game and next month's
17 days of Olympic glory, let's pause a moment to examine just how
thoroughly sports have been overwhelmed by corporate interests and
converted from recreation into a nonstop promotional machine.</LD>
<LD>   The only real problem with this rant is deciding where to begin.
Consider, for example, the recent college football national
championship game played at the Rose Bowl, when Disney-owned ABC
originated its halftime show--for absolutely no reason--from the
studio's visitor-challenged California Adventure theme park, in one
of those baldfaced displays of "synergy" sports fans are force-fed
daily.</LD>
<TE>   The Super Bowl, of course, has somehow been exempt from such
concerns, having graduated long ago from a sporting event into
something more: a national day of gluttony for Americans to
unabashedly embrace the joys of advertising, consumerism and greasy
foods. In this context, even commercials, usually dismissed as the
bane of commercial television, are celebrated and exalted.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the coalescence of sports, promotion and
advertising has become such standard procedure in television that the
Super Bowl no longer seems quite so special, the orgy of excess
having become an entrenched part of our sports-consuming lives.</TE>
<TE>   While watching even the most mundane sporting events, in fact,
it's impossible to escape commercials during the program, as networks
keep finding new ways to shoehorn ads into every lapse in the action,
desperate to justify the billion-dollar fees they keep shelling
out--despite their pleas of poverty--for broadcast rights.</TE>
<TE>   The examples are everywhere, among them sandwiching promotional
spots between plays in football games and between free throws in
basketball games. Technology has also contributed to this onslaught,
as demonstrated by Fox's decision to superimpose "virtual billboards"
for its prime-time shows behind batters during the World Series,
filling the screen with ads for "Ally McBeal" and "Boston Public"
visible only to TV viewers who, God forbid, might otherwise focus on
pitcher Randy Johnson's fastball.</TE>
<TE>   Gerard Medioni, chair of the computer science department and
professor of electrical engineering at the USC School of Engineering,
was instrumental in developing "virtual signage" technology, and he
expects its use to flourish.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly, the advertisement is encrusted in the content itself,
so if you want to watch the game, you have to see it," he explained,
adding in regard to the propriety of that concept, "It's only
offensive if it's overdone.... The ethical issue is going over the
line of what's outrageous."</TE>
<TE>   One viewer's outrage, however, is simply another's well-told
"story," especially when it comes to tailoring coverage to those for
whom viewing the game itself isn't enough. In the case of the
Olympics, that means not just showing us who won the downhill but
simultaneously trying to breed a new generation of fresh-faced
commercial spokespeople, neatly wrapped in youthful patriotism,
compelling personal histories and athletic derring-do, all set to a
tinkly piano score.</TE>
<TE>   Small wonder that there hasn't been much of an outcry over the
Olympics being tape-delayed for prime-time consumption on the West
Coast, even though many events will be broadcast live in other time
zones. Those who complain that NBC wouldn't do the same with the
Super Bowl are missing the point, because it's accepted by now that
the Olympics are entertainment, so in the network's eyes a better
analogy is the Emmys or Golden Globes. The transformation--from
sporting event to "unscripted entertainment," a la "Fear Factor" or
"Survivor"--is complete.</TE>
<TE>   From this perspective, the entertainment-sports relationship has
become a pretty vicious cycle, with money driving every spoke in the
wheel. Rising salaries lead to exorbitant ticket prices, preventing
many average consumers from attending games in person. As a result,
they're left to watch their favorite teams on TV.</TE>
<TE>   Yet because rights fees have continued to rise, the games
themselves must make concessions to meet television's needs: amending
rule books to be more TV-friendly, accommodating more insidious
methods of advertising and holding virtually all the competition at
night--meaning that kids on the East Coast, the sporting world's next
generation of viewers, must stay awake until near midnight if they
want to see the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing exemplifies this more than college football's Bowl
Championship Series, a made-for-ABC concept that has done far more to
muddle who can lay claim to the No.1 title than to clear it up. Too
bad that the simplest solution--keep the bowl system as it was, then
stage a championship game a week later between the top two finishers
in the final polls--doesn't feather as many nests with seven-figure
payouts.</TE>
<TE>   So before we sit down to digest our annual buffet of chips and
salsa washed down by a mountain-fresh Coors or frosty Budweiser, it's
worth considering how these forces have conspired to reshape the
Super Bowl, Rose Bowl and every other kind of bowl into a more
unorthodox shape oozing ad content from every side.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, one can rightly argue, what in the media doesn't fall
into that category at this point? After all, you can't even listen to
the dulcet tones of CBS radio commentator Charles Osgood anymore
without having to endure pathetic plugs for Body Solutions, just as
ABC's Paul Harvey endorses nutritional supplements that can allegedly
help someone old enough to have seen Jim Thorpe in the Olympics feel
like a spry young colt.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, none of this qualifies as the end of civilization as we
know it, even for dedicated sports fans; rather, it's become more
like a pebble in your sneaker, the sort of persistent annoyance or
minor indignity often easier to ignore than to remedy.</TE>
<TE>   Getting up and turning off the TV would obviously send a message
that things have gone too far, but old habits die hard, so don't hold
your breath waiting for that to happen. Besides, with that bag of
chips on the table just waiting to be washed down by an ice-cold
brew, how many sports viewers could resist the lure of the couch long
enough to actually make a stand?</TE>

<HD>Disney's Greatest Hits</HD>
<DH>LACMA's 100th birthday retrospective of Walt Disney's
animation includes classics such as 'Bambi' as well as lesser-known
works.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL MALLORY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The legacy of Walt Disney can be seen practically everywhere, from
fast-food restaurants to copyright law.</LD>
<LD>   His actual work as a creative producer, however, is harder to find
these days, particularly in the original theatrical format for which
it was designed.</LD>
<LD>   A "greatest hits" collection of that work will be on display the
next three weekends, however, at the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art, in a retrospective titled "Disney at 100: The Animated
Classics."</LD>
<TE>   Staged in conjunction with Disney's 100th birthday (Dec. 5, 2001),
the LACMA tribute, which begins Friday, includes such celebrated
animated features as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," "Bambi,"
"Lady and the Tramp" and the restored 1940 road-show version of
"Fantasia" containing long-excised footage. It also features short
cartoons, documentaries and presentations by Disney historians John
Canemaker, Russell Merritt and Scott MacQueen.</TE>
<TE>   "We're basically doing the films that Walt himself was involved
in," says Ian Birnie, director of the film department for LACMA.
"We're opening with 'Snow White' and 'The Jungle Book,' which bookend
[Disney's career]."</TE>
<TE>   "The Jungle Book," released in 1967, 30 years after the
groundbreaking "Snow White," was the last film Disney had a hand in
creating. The only non-Walt Disney feature on the schedule is "The
Little Mermaid" from 1989, which will screen as part of a children's
matinee series.</TE>
<TE>   Two recent documentaries, "Frank and Ollie," chronicling animators
Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, and "The Hand Behind the Mouse,"
about Disney's artistic and technological right hand, Ub Iwerks, will
also be screened.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney's dominance in the cartoon realm started in the late
1920s, and he produced hundreds of cartoons and 22 animated features,
some of them animation and live-action mixes, contributing to every
aspect of production from story to music to cutting. Selecting films
for "Disney at 100" was not a big challenge, according to Birnie.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that we wanted to put in some of the more obscure things
from the 1940s, the mixtures of live action and animation, and ones
that didn't screen [in theaters] very often, like 'Peter Pan' and
'Bambi,'" Birnie says. "And I knew I wanted to put in the
documentaries because I really think they give an insight into how
the studio worked. Once you added the really famous features, it was
filled up."</TE>
<TE>   Birnie jokes that the two "head" movies, "Fantasia" and 1951's
"Alice in Wonderland," both of which feature mushrooms with magical
properties and other pre-psychedelic images, will be presented as a
double feature.</TE>
<TE>   Another evening will pair 1959's "Sleeping Beauty" with 1961's
"101 Dalmatians," showing the shift in graphic style that occurred
within that span, from the lavish "European," semi-realistic look of
the fairy tales to the far more stylized, contemporary and sketchier
"Dalmatians" look that characterized the films through the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally relegated to the ranks of kiddie fodder, American
animation has endured a long, hard road to recognition as mainstream
art by a major museum. But according to MacQueen, senior manager of
library restoration for the Walt Disney Co., the selected films from
the period show not only animation as art but also animation as
cinema.</TE>
<TE>   "Credit is never given to a picture like 'Pinocchio' for being a
groundbreaking motion picture, but when you look at it objectively,
it is a cinematically advanced as 'Citizen Kane,'" contends MacQueen,
who will present at LACMA an evening of rediscovered "lost" and cut
sequences and behind-the-scenes studio footage.</TE>
<TE>   "Think of that moving shot where we descend past the tolling
steeple and the doves fly by, and the camera descends from a loft
down into the village and goes down the streets as the city awakens,
and we wind up two blocks away at Gepetto's doorstep where Pinocchio
appears. That is as much of a leap as the [camera] pan up to Xanadu
in the opening of 'Kane.'"</TE>
<TE>   Animation Mixes Story, Artistry, Music, Character</TE>
<TE>   MacQueen says the hallmark of Disney's classic animation is its
complete marriage of artistry and story, character, music and even
some subliminal psychological manipulations of form, color, design
and cutting that might have startled Alfred Hitchcock.</TE>
<TE>   He cites as examples of this the famous sequence from "Bambi" in
which the title character's mother is killed and the Witch's
transformation scene from "Snow White," both of which, he said, when
viewed frame by frame, reveal a wealth of "invisible" but emotionally
powerful imagery.</TE>
<TE>   Not all such artistic and technical achievements were reserved for
the studio's feature films, however. Many, if not most, were
introduced through Disney's "Silly Symphonies" series, initially
launched as a blanket title for non-Mickey Mouse cartoons. Far from
being merely silly, the series quickly became a laboratory in which
Disney could experiment and innovate.</TE>
<TE>   "The Skeleton Dance" in 1929 married image and mood to music in a
way that foreshadowed "Fantasia." "Flowers and Trees" three years
later was the first full Technicolor cartoon, and "The Three Little
Pigs" in 1933 pushed the concept of individual personality animation,
without which the Seven Dwarfs would have been seven clones. Even the
studio's much-heralded multi-plane camera, which created remarkable
depth of field by passing through succeeding levels of backgrounds,
was launched in a 1937 Silly Symphony titled "The Old Mill."</TE>
<TE>   The studio's experimentation continued into the 1940s, with such
exercises in color and form as 1945's "The Three Caballeros," one of
a series of wartime mixed-technique and compilations films. Because
the parts of these films are often greater than the whole, they have
tended to be dismissed over the years as a comedown from the glories
of "Pinocchio" and "Bambi," though MacQueen does not see them that
way.</TE>
<TE>   "People say, 'Oh, they lost their way after the war in those
compilation films, but there are wonderful things in 'Melody Time'
and 'Make Mine Music,'" MacQueen says. ("Blame It on the Samba," a
segment from the 1948 "Melody Time," will screen in the LACMA
series.) "'Three Caballeros' itself pushed so many boundaries of
color and form and design that, in its own way, it's as experimental
and rich as 'Fantasia.'"</TE>
<TE>   That attention to form and design was given to more emotional
scenes, such as the one in "Snow White" in which the dwarfs weep over
the body of Snow White.</TE>
<TE>   Art Direction, Mood Contribute to Picture</TE>
<TE>   "That's really a miraculous achievement," says Canemaker, author
of several books on Disney animation, including "Walt Disney's Nine
Old Men and the Art of Animation," "because it could have been
ludicrous, seeing these little cartoon characters weeping over the
death of another cartoon character. But the way it was staged, the
sensitivity of the animation, the minimal amount of movement, the
mood, the art direction, it all contributed to that feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Canemaker's presentation at LACMA centers on the group of
animators known as the Nine Old Men--Frank Thomas, Les Clark,
Wolfgang Reithermann, Eric Larsen, Ward Kimball, Milt Kahl, Ollie
Johnston, John Lounsbery and Marc Davis--who together achieved more
public recognition than other Disney artists.</TE>
<TE>   Although still relatively young when they received their
collective moniker (which came from Disney's joking comparison of
them to FDR's Supreme Court), they had achieved a level of trust and
power from the boss that other studio personnel did not.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of the making of those films, they were almost
individual directors in themselves," Canemaker says. "If you mention
any kind of favorite scene or sequence in a whole number of films
over the past 40 years or so, chances are they were animated or
supervised by one of the Nine Old Men."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Disney's lifetime and beyond, some observers have
attempted to search through the ranks of the artists and craftsmen
who worked at the studio, looking for a hidden genius, cloaked by
Disney's high profile, who was really responsible for the classics.</TE>
<TE>   None was ever found. And if the best Disney films were perfect
marriages of color, form, story, character, music and emotion, the
animated classics on display at LACMA should demonstrate that it was
Walt Disney himself who performed the marriage ceremony.</TE>

<LD>   A Cover-Up in the Justice Department?</LD>
<LD>   The Great Hall in the Justice Department building, completed in
1934, is unexpectedly in the spotlight.</LD>
<TE>   According to ABCNews.com, U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft--a
conservative former U.S. senator who reportedly leads daily prayer
sessions at the Justice Department--was embarrassed by two largely
naked sculptures placed at one end of the hall: a female depicting
the Spirit of Justice and a male representing Majesty or Law situated
at the end of the space.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, they were covered up with draperies costing more than
$8,000, the news outlet says. What provoked the move was a November
news conference in which Ashcroft was photographed with a
bare-breasted sculpture as a backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft told the New York Post that he never ordered the
drapes--and Justice Dept. officials back him up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something he thought about one way or the other," said
his spokeswoman, Barbara Comstock. "He's got better things to do."</TE>
<TE>   The draperies, she said, were ordered up by an Ashcroft aide
because they make for better TV pictures.</TE>

<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Fox News Channel Eclipses CNN in Ratings</TE>
<TE>   Relative newcomer Fox News Channel surpassed 2-decade-old CNN in
January to become the most-watched cable news channel for the first
time, according to Nielsen Media Research figures released Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   For the month, Fox drew an average 656,000 viewers during the
24-hour day, compared with 596,000 average viewers for CNN. Fox News,
which is 51/2 years old, also handily won in the prime-time hours in
which most viewing is done.</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC was third on a total-day basis for the month, while business
news channel CNBC was fourth and CNN Headline News was fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with a year ago, Fox was up by 109%, while the rest of
the networks except CNBC showed double-digit gains--a result of
increased viewer interest in the continuing war on terrorism. CNBC,
however, dropped 25%.</TE>

<TE>   Study: Opinion Is Up in TV News After Sept. 11</TE>
<TE>   A new study conducted by Columbia University's Project for
Excellence in Journalism charges that, in its coverage of the war in
Afghanistan, TV news has put more emphasis on opinion than on facts.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately following Sept. 11, "factual stories" dominated the
airwaves, the findings showed. But by December, they had declined
from 64% to 57% of the newscasts.</TE>
<TE>   Punditry and analysis rose from 35% to 43%. ABC's "Good Morning
America" and "Nightline," in particular, were praised for having the
most factually packed and serious reports.</TE>
<TE>   CNN showed as much pro-administration bias as the traditionally
more conservative Fox News Channel, the report went on. And TV was
far less likely to air criticism of the Bush administration than
newspapers. The number of people who called media coverage
"excellent" dropped from 56% in September to 30% two months later.</TE>
<TE>   Network executives said the findings were skewed because the group
only looked at three days each in September, November and December.</TE>

<TE>   O'Donnell's Book Said to Be Full of Surprises</TE>
<TE>   A sales representative for Warner Books, quoted in Publisher's
Weekly, says people will be "very surprised" by Rosie O'Donnell's
upcoming book "Find Me," due out April 23.</TE>
<TE>   Among the topics the talk show host is expected to tackle: the
death of her mother, her estrangement from her father ... and,
according to insiders, being gay.</TE>
<TE>   A source quoted in Sunday's New York Daily News says that
O'Donnell "talks about her relationship with women and having a girl
break her heart in college." The Warner representative also said that
the book hinges on a phone call the comedian received from a girl.</TE>
<TE>   According to E! Online, "Find Me" has broken the top 250 on
Amazon.com's sales rankings, three months before its publication
date.</TE>
<TE>   Although O'Donnell dedicated her Daytime Emmy award to her
constant companion, Kelli Carpenter last May, she's never officially
come out. Though her camp hasn't denounced the report, neither has it
confirmed it--preferring to describe the book as the comedian's
"personal journey."</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Actress Sandy Duncan and cast members from Broadway shows will
perform a free musical revue Thursday at California Plaza's Water
Court in downtown L.A. at 12:30 p.m. The New York Loves America Tour,
a thank-you to Americans for their support of New York after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, will tour 14 U.S. cities.... Bruce Willis
and Sarah Jessica Parker will travel to Cambridge, Mass., next month
to be roasted by Hasty Pudding Theatricals--a Harvard University
group honoring those who have made "a lasting and impressive
contribution to the world of entertainment".... Fox has canceled the
torture quiz show "The Chamber" --a show it had rushed to get on the
air before ABC's "The Chair." Both programs debuted reasonably well
but saw their ratings drop in subsequent telecasts.... Will Smith
("Ali") will receive the Male Star of the Year award at ShoWest, the
annual convention of movie exhibitors, on March 7 in Las Vegas....
Billy Joel will be honored as the 12th annual Musicares Person of the
Year at the Century Plaza Hotel on Feb. 25. Among those scheduled to

<HD>'West Point' Maps History of Elite Military Training</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Early in the documentary "West Point" about the history of the U.S.
Military Academy, a former faculty member diagnoses the dilemma of
having such an elite institution in a democratic society with
populist tendencies.</LD>
<LD>   Robert H. Moore, a faculty member from 1968 to 1972 and author of
a book about the academy, says West Point "serves as a Rorschach
test" for American values.</LD>
<LD>   "In a time when the country is in agreement about its use of
military power, West Point seems like a marvel of an institution
where their whole professional ethos is devoted to doing the country
service," says Moore.</LD>
<TE>   "[But] at times when there's confusion and disarray about the
country's military objectives, West Point seems like a den of
iniquity where military people conspire to carry out their trade
irrespective of the desires of the civilian population."</TE>
<TE>   That push-pull was present from the beginning. The academy was
authorized in 1802 by President Jefferson, who had once been one of
the most ardent foes of the idea, believing it smacked of the
European system of a professional military hostile to civilian
authority.</TE>
<TE>   Narrated by Andre Braugher, "West Point," tonight at 9 on PBS
stations KCET-TV and KVCR-TV, tells of the triumphs, failures and
controversies of the former Revolutionary War garrison 50 miles north
of New York on the Hudson River--all backed with sumptuous
photography and historic stills.</TE>
<TE>   The effort excels in describing the larger-than-life figures who
shaped West Point and were shaped by it: Lee, Grant, Patton,
Eisenhower, MacArthur, Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   The tactics taught at West Point helped the U.S. whip the
much-larger Mexican army and capture Mexico City in 1847, winning a
piece of real estate now known as California. The Civil War was a
battle between West Pointers who remained loyal to the Union and
those who bolted for home.</TE>
<TE>   The career of Douglas MacArthur, the archetypal West Pointer, is
deftly traced from his days as a brutally harassed cadet to his final
speech to the cadets as an enfeebled and somewhat fallen figure:</TE>
<TE>   "In the evening of my memory, always I come back to West Point. My
last conscious thoughts will be of the corps and the corps and the
corps."</TE>
<TE>   Amid the glory, "West Point" does not disregard the scandals,
racism, sexism, cheating, hazing and drug use. Retired Gen. Andrew
Goodpaster, superintendent from 1977 to 1981, is credited with
rescuing West Point from a corrosive counterculture that condoned
drugs, cynicism and cheating.</TE>
<TE>   If "West Point" is strong on the institution's past, it is less so
on its present and future. Some interviews with cadets might have
helped. Who are these young people who are drawn to the profession of
arms? A peek into a classroom would have been nice. What are cadets
taught about Vietnam?</TE>
<TE>   A discussion with non-West Pointer Colin Powell about the
difference between West Point officers and ROTC-trained officers
would have been beneficial. For all its tradition, West Point
provides only a quarter of Army officers.</TE>
<TE>   Some West Pointers are allowed to go over the top in praise of
their beloved institution, suggesting the insularity that worried
Jefferson.</TE>
<TE>   H. Norman Schwarzkopf, class of '56, says West Point, although
expensive to run, deserves to be supported as the "one place that is
the keeper of the holy flame of military professionalism...."</TE>
<TE>   The one place?</TE>
<TE>   The folks who run Marine training at San Diego and Parris
Island--and provided the majority of combat troops sent to
Afghanistan--might take exception to that view.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "West Point" airs tonight at 9 on KCET and KVCR.</TE>

<HD>Taper Second Stage Gets a Boost</HD>
<DH>A $2.5-million donation from Kirk and Anne Douglas is
targeted for renovation of a Culver City theater that would provide
programming flexibility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES THEATER WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kirk Douglas and his wife, Anne, will announce today they are
donating $2.5 million to help build the long-anticipated new theater
complex that Center Theatre Group plans to operate in downtown Culver
City.</LD>
<LD>   The interior of the Culver Theater, a former cinema that opened in
1947, would be overhauled to create a flexible space with about 400
seats and a smaller upstairs facility that would seat 100. The
exterior of the building, which has been designated a historic
landmark, would be preserved as provided under city ordinance. The
building will be named the Kirk Douglas Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   "The point of the theater is to give young talent a chance to
develop," said the veteran movie star, now 85.</LD>
<TE>   The total cost of the project, to be overseen by Culver City-based
architect Steven Ehrlich, is estimated between $7 million and $8
million. The theater is tentatively slated for a 2004 opening, but
Center Theatre Group still must raise another $2.5 million to $3
million.</TE>
<TE>   Culver City Redevelopment Agency is contributing $1.25 million,
and Center Theatre Group officials hope to raise an additional $1
million from other government sources, including a $250,000 Economic
Development Initiative grant approved by Congress and signed by
President Bush on Nov. 26 as part of the Department of Housing and
Urban Development's appropriations bill.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Theatre would house the play development programs of
Center Theatre Group's Mark Taper Forum, offering a home for works
deemed too intimate for the Taper or for its larger sibling, the
Ahmanson Theatre, or that are not yet ready for a larger space. It
also would be the home of the Taper's youth productions.</TE>
<TE>   Taper artistic director Gordon Davidson said that the two venues
that would be created inside the Douglas have yet to receive
individual names, but he declined to say how much money would be
required for the naming rights.</TE>
<TE>   The direct connection between Center Theatre Group and the
Douglases is Anne Douglas, who was on the theater's board of
directors from 1966 to 1974, including a stint as vice president, and
again from 1991 to 2000. She's now an emeritus director.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the Douglases have attended many Taper and
Ahmanson productions. "L.A. is becoming more important in the
theater," said Kirk Douglas. "A lot of plays have their genesis
here."</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Douglas began his career as a New York stage actor. "In a
sense I'm a failure," he said, "because I never wanted to be a movie
actor." When Hollywood first called on him, "I was appalled."</TE>
<TE>   However, his nine or 10 New York productions were all flops, he
said. With the added responsibility of his firstborn son Michael, "I
thought maybe I could make some money" doing movies.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to L.A., appearing in his first movie in 1946, and
returned to the stage only twice: for an ill-fated production of "One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" on Broadway in 1963, and a 1981 San
Francisco production of "The Boys in Autumn," in which he played an
aged Huckleberry Finn to Burt Lancaster's aged Tom Sawyer. (Rights to
"Cuckoo's Nest" were later obtained by Michael Douglas, who shared an
Oscar for co-producing the 1975 film starring Jack Nicholson.)</TE>
<TE>   Asked why the theater would not be named after both Douglases,
Anne Douglas responded, "I would not have liked that. I never worked
in the theater."</TE>
<TE>   "She knows who the star is," Davidson said in a separate
interview.</TE>
<TE>   Anne Douglas remembered the controversy that erupted over the
first Taper show in 1967, "The Devils," which was considered
scandalous by many members of the board, she said. "It nearly cost
Gordon his career. I was not among those who found it that terrible."</TE>
<TE>   The 745-seat Taper "was built as an experimental theater," in
contrast with the 2,100-seat Ahmanson, she added. "So he was right to
give us something like that. But little by little, they needed the
Taper to be a regular theater. Now we need another theater where
students can come and where writers, producers and actors can try out
plays that will end up either at the Music Center or somewhere else.
Kirk and I wanted to help them have that theater."</TE>
<TE>   Davidson elaborated: "From the beginning, we've done new plays,
and home-grown work is still at the core of our raison d'etre. We
used to do everything on the main stage. But as it became more
necessary to fill the Taper with something that produced more income,
a new home became more important.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost every theater has a combination of small developmental
spaces and presentational spaces," he added. The Taper has rented a
variety of smaller venues over the years--"all wonderful, but not
ours."</TE>
<TE>   Taper officials have been searching for a home for a permanent
smaller space for more than two decades. A plan to create a new wing
of the Taper within Bergamot Station in Santa Monica died in 1996
when lead donor Hiro Yamagata's multimillion-dollar real estate deal
for the space fell through.  The Taper then turned to Culver City,
where civic leaders were eager to find a creative use for the Culver.</TE>
<TE>   The location is close to wealthy Westside communities where many
of Center Theatre's Group's subscribers and donors live, but Culver
City itself is middle-class, "very alive with young people and
affordable housing," Davidson said, adding that he likes the fact
that the entrance to the theater, at 9280 Washington Blvd., will face
a street, in contrast with the plazas at the Music Center. "When
people can walk off a sidewalk into a theater, that's exciting."</TE>
<TE>   The new space will provide more room to showcase the Taper's
commitment "to represent the diversity of this area in a more
meaningful way," Davidson said. The new theater will also serve as
the home of P.L.A.Y. (Performing for Los Angeles Youth), the Taper's
youth wing, which has spent most of its time performing in schools.
Despite its experimental and educational labels, the new theater will
not necessarily drain all new work off the main stage, Davidson said.
"I'm always looking at mixing and matching."</TE>
<TE>   Asked to name some recent main-stage productions that probably
would have been staged in the Douglas Theatre if it had been
available, Davidson mentioned Warren Leight's "Glimmer, Glimmer and
Shine," Robert Glaudini's "The Poison Tree," Patrick Marber's
"Closer" and "Tongue of a Bird" by Ellen McLaughlin.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the plays at the Douglas Theatre will be in need of
more development, Davidson said. Some plays will simply fit better,
aesthetically, into a smaller space that, he said, "will be so warm
and welcoming to the relationship between audience and artist."</TE>

<HD>Cinema Paradiso? Not Always</HD>
<DH>Movies inspire strong passions. Some people watch quietly,
some complain out loud, and others walk out. What pushes some ticket
buyers to vote with their feet?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It takes a lot to walk out of a movie, said a young man named Colin
on a recent Thursday evening. "If I pay for something, even if it
tastes bad, I'll keep eating it," he said as he stood alone in an
empty corridor of Century City's AMC multiplex.</LD>
<LD>   That night he was brimming with the vitriol of a food critic who
had just bitten into an overcooked filet. "It's just unbearable," he
said, explaining why he walked out of the movie "I Am Sam," which
stars Sean Penn as a father with a mental disability. "It should have
ended five or six times by now," said Colin, who was also fulminating
about what he described as the filmmakers' manipulative use of "warm
and fuzzy" Beatles songs.</LD>
<LD>   Multiply Colin by an untold number and you have a topic hardly
anybody in the movie business wants to discuss. While studios and
theater owners will try almost anything to get you into a movie, the
last thing they want to acknowledge is that people walk out.</LD>
<TE>   Almost everyone, it seems, has left a movie at least once,
although many say they can't remember what it was. Some enjoy the
psychic thrill of voting with their feet. Sometimes, they even get
their money back.</TE>
<TE>   The movie doesn't even have to be a bomb. The films people leave
the most are frequently also the most admired.</TE>
<TE>   In an industry town like Los Angeles, purists can be found in two
camps: people who religiously sit through the closing credits to the
bitter end, and those who believe the disappointed and disgusted have
a moral obligation to leave.</TE>
<TE>   According to online film critic Harry Knowles, proprietor of the
aintitcoolnews.com Web site, "There's a passion to attending films
that is every bit as great as the passion in making films."</TE>
<TE>   Taking It No More</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca and Eddie Oertell of Sherman Oaks aren't shy about walking
out. They walked out of "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider." "The acting was so
cheesy. We expected more 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,'" Eddie said.</TE>
<TE>   They walked out of "Eye of the Beholder," a 1999 thriller starring
Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor. "We got totally lost," Rebecca said.</TE>
<TE>   They walked out of a movie so forgettable they couldn't remember
what it was--"a John Travolta movie," he said. "Based on that
Scientology thing," she said. "It was ridiculous. Twenty minutes into
it, we were like, 'Forget it,'" she said. A few minutes later, he
recalled the movie was "Battlefield Earth."</TE>
<TE>   After they sat through all of "Vanilla Sky," the Oertells wished
they had walked out of that one too. "You see Tom Cruise and you
think it's got to be a good movie," she said. "We kept thinking it
might get better."</TE>
<TE>   Many of this season's most acclaimed films have inspired walkouts.
Numerous patrons walked out of "Moulin Rouge" last year, said Marlon
Sanchez, a customer-service representative at the AMC theater in
Century City. The fast-paced musical has been honored by several
industry-related groups and won three Golden Globes, including best
musical or comedy picture.</TE>
<TE>   One person who walked out of the musical when it was released
said, "I went to see it in the summer. The frenetic pace made me
nuts." His opinion has mellowed with time, and he thinks he might
give the admittedly challenging film another chance on DVD.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Glik of Irvine, a fan of "The Royal Tenenbaums" star Gene
Hackman, said he went to that show "like a lamb to the slaughter.</TE>
<TE>   "It started off in neutral, went up to a modest peak, then went
steadily downhill," he said. Glik decided to walk out and left his
wife sitting with their friends. (Hackman won the Golden Globe for
best actor in a musical or comedy.)</TE>
<TE>   Getting Your Money Back</TE>
<TE>   Some, like Glik, roam the multiplexes after they exit one
auditorium in search of more palatable fare, a practice theater
owners frown upon. The Oertells said they ask for their money back
only when they're extremely unhappy, as with "Battlefield Earth." If
they leave within the first half-hour, they said, they're likely to
get a refund.</TE>
<TE>   Each theater chain has its own policy. "Our core belief is that
people are frequent moviegoers. It's not like buying a new car," said
Rick King, spokesman for AMC Entertainment in Kansas City, Mo.
"Hopefully they not only plan ahead but also come on impulse. If
you're dissatisfied, we'll work with you on your choice, to get you
into another movie the same day, or have you come back," he said. The
chain has a "no-questions-asked" policy for the first 30 minutes if
customers want their money back, exchange their ticket for another
show or obtain a pass to return at another time. After that, he said,
"it's really the manager's judgment."</TE>
<TE>   Another chain, Loews Cineplex, doesn't have "a set policy. We
leave it up to the discretion of the managers," Mindy Tucker,
corporate vice president, said from the company's offices in New
York. "Typically if they leave within the first half-hour, we try to
accommodate them. We will give them their money back if there's a
legitimate reason." Usually, she said, managers offer a pass for
another movie. "We want our customers to leave happy."</TE>
<TE>   When patrons have invested much more--at operas, concerts or plays
where tickets can top $400 for a Broadway show, for example--the
motivation to stick it out is understandably stronger. If they decide
they can't stand it any longer, they can depart unobtrusively at
intermission. Otherwise, walking out requires climbing over people in
the dark. What's more, according to Los Angeles Opera spokesman Gary
Murphy, people who remain tend to gossip about those who've left
early.</TE>
<TE>   The Theories</TE>
<TE>   Some say today's moviegoers are less inclined to walk out in this
age of information saturation, because they are more informed going
in.</TE>
<TE>   Others say the added information makes customers more assertive
about walking out. "Your average moviegoer now sees him- or herself
as a movie critic," said Jill Stein, a social psychologist and UCLA
lecturer in American society and culture. "Before, we were more
passive, more receptive, less critical," she said.</TE>
<TE>   More information hasn't necessarily sharpened viewers' tastes, she
added. "We've become barnyard connoisseurs," she said. "We get a
common thrill, a little sense of superiority. We like to think, 'I
could do better; the girl down the street could have taken on that
role.'"</TE>
<TE>   According to other theories, walking out could be a function of a
"television mentality" or a psychological need for emotional
distance.</TE>
<TE>   Going to a movie theater is more emotionally engaging than
watching a video at home. For Dana Polan, a USC professor of critical
studies, walking into a darkened movie theater is a ritual that
signifies leaving everyday life. Some people can't take it, he said,
and need to keep the movie at a distance by talking, sitting in the
back, or getting up and leaving.</TE>
<TE>   What Directors Think</TE>
<TE>   Among people who believe in walking out is director Wes Craven
("Scream," "A Nightmare on Elm Street"). "You want people to react
strongly to your film," he said. "Otherwise, you might as well be
making cotton candy."</TE>
<TE>   Craven recalled that one of his earliest films, "Last House on the
Left," a 1972 movie whose disturbingly graphic murders and rape
caught many audiences off guard, caused riots in some theaters. "In
one theater, the projectionist had to lock himself in the booth," he
said. "I've had people say it was the best film I ever made. Others
say I have to ask God to forgive me when I die."</TE>
<TE>   Craven himself walked out of a screening of director Quentin
Tarantino's critically acclaimed "Reservoir Dogs" in 1992 during a
graphic torture scene that was accompanied by a lighthearted rock
song. (At the time, Craven explained, he thought the director was
self-indulgent, although years later he found it a powerful film.)
Tarantino was in the lobby and saw him leave, Craven said. "He ran
out and told his friends, 'I can't believe I made Wes Craven leave.'
He was very happy."</TE>
<TE>   While some directors expecting a warm reception might have their
feelings hurt by walkouts, audience behavior is crucial to gauging
how effective a film is, Craven explained. "As a director, whenever
you're at a screening, you're constantly watching the audience,
seeing who laughs, who jumps, who gets restless, who gets up to get
popcorn and when."</TE>
<TE>   As artists, filmmakers challenge preconceptions, he said. "If
they're doing their job on the forefront, they're seeing how
paradigms are shifting and new realities are emerging." In his
opinion, viewers who hold on to the old reality are more likely to
leave. Although such films are common now, a movie in the 1950s that
showed an interracial couple, for example, probably would have
resulted in people walking out.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes a film is different from what moviegoers expect. Decades
ago, parents yanked kids out of "Fritz the Cat" when they realized it
was an X-rated cartoon. And not everyone who bought a ticket knew
Todd Solondz's "Happiness" (1998) was a black comedy involving a
pedophile.</TE>
<TE>   Solondz, whose "Storytelling" opened Friday, said, "I've always
known my movies are not for everyone. I feel bad they've wasted money
on a movie they don't appreciate."</TE>
<TE>   Quoted recently in the New York Times as saying he walks out of
movies "all the time," the director confirmed that he sometimes does,
although "not regularly."</TE>
<TE>   "I do it on occasion" when he finds a film "assaultive and
painful." He would not identify any movies he had walked out of
because "I would never do that to the filmmaker."</TE>
<TE>   "There's always a certain element of risk in going to a movie,"
Solondz said. "That's what makes it exciting. If you knew what would
happen at the end, it wouldn't be very adventurous. If there's no
surprise, how much pleasure can you have from the experience?"</TE>
<TE>   He surmised there must be people walking out of "Storytelling,"
which has elicited sharply different reactions. "It's just part of
the territory, I suppose."</TE>
<TE>   Do's and Don'ts</TE>
<TE>   People who walk out do not always go quietly. In 1979, Robert
Altman's gloomy, complex "Quintet" sparked exoduses, recalled
director Craven. Outside a Westwood theater, he said, some people who
walked out told people waiting in line not to go into the theater.</TE>
<TE>   Disgruntled viewers who don't leave sometimes ruin a movie for
others by complaining loudly, said Dana McWeeney, a Los Angeles film
advocate for the Ain't It Cool News site. "At that point," he said,
"it's their obligation to leave."</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago Polan saw a fight break out at the end of
"Affliction" in a theater on Wilshire Boulevard. "Some people were
talking through the entire film and the credits. It started when
someone got up and said, 'Can you shut up?'"</TE>
<TE>   In other cultures, notably India, social psychologist Stein said,
audiences are more active, talking or yelling back to the screen.
"Maybe we're moving in that direction," she surmised.</TE>
<TE>   Reasons to Stay</TE>
<TE>   Web critic Knowles, who refers to movies as his "church," makes it
a "point of pride" to never leave a movie. Not only is it his job,
but he also can't believe a movie can be bad enough to abandon.
"Somewhere in there is a kernel of an idea worth finding," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Knowles explained why he walked out of the 1995 thriller "Never
Talk to Strangers" with Antonio Banderas and Rebecca De Mornay. "I'm
sitting there, watching this film, seeing a sex scene through a
chain-link fence.</TE>
<TE>   "I had found the reason why they made the movie. Someone said,
'Sex through a chain-link fence! Brilliant!'"</TE>
<TE>   Up until that point the film had been so unimaginative, he
preferred to leave at that point so he could imagine for himself
where the movie went from there.</TE>
<TE>   There are also unexpected benefits from seeing a bad film through
to the end.</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Seidman of Beverly Hills said she and her husband, Marvin,
belong to several movie discussion groups. The less popular the film,
she said, the easier it is to remember and the more they have to say.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, they saw the sci-fi thriller "Pi." "We wondered
how we could have sat through this film. The photography was
terrible. The acting was terrible. It was demeaning to almost
everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you what we saw last week," she said. "We never
forgot 'Pi.'"</TE>

<HD>Screwball Corruption on 'The Job'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can police corruption be funny? If it's of the screwball variety
found on "The Job," the answer is yes, but only if you don't mind
some extra vice in your vice squad.</LD>
<LD>   Comedian Denis Leary stars in and helped create this comedy series
about New York City police detectives, which hit the air last season
with six episodes on ABC. Thanks to some tinkering with the network's
lineup earlier this month, the show has returned for the second half
of this season.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's episode at 9:30, the third since the comeback, amply
demonstrates just how crooked, if not entirely bent, the series' thin
blue line can be.</LD>
<TE>   One opportunistic detective, Tommy (Adam Ferrara), has returned
from the scene of a suicide with the victim's telescope, and he has
surveillance on his mind. Or as the veteran Frank (Lenny Clarke)
succinctly puts it: "Tommy stole a telescope from a dead guy, and now
we're looking for naked chicks."</TE>
<TE>   Their prurience is quickly rewarded, much to the delight of
Leary's Det. Mike McNeil, a hard-drinking, heavy-smoking, sarcastic
cop with a wife, a kid and a mistress. (Guess which of the three
seems to take up most of his free time?) It isn't long before McNeil
hatches a plan worthy of Lucy Ricardo, if she'd been male, lecherous
and foulmouthed, and the scheme leads to some improbable
complications.</TE>
<TE>   Despite McNeil's more deplorable traits, or perhaps because of
them, Leary's character is actually quite likable, a rebel who
operates outside departmental and societal codes of conduct just to
make it through another workday.</TE>
<TE>   And, with the major exceptions of his straight-as-an-arrow partner
Pip (Bill Nunn), semi-strait-laced fellow detective Jan (Diane Farr)
and tough-talking boss (Keith David), McNeil is hardly alone.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt, this precinct of policemen behaving badly would not be
pleasant to inhabit in real life. But for the purposes of slapstick
comedy with a mordant edge, it's a nice enough place to visit.</TE>

<HD>'Rose Red' Is Sweet for ABC</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Stephen King miniseries "Rose Red" overcame mostly negative
reviews to scare up plenty of viewers for ABC on Sunday, based on
viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   King's haunted house tale surpassed the opening-night ratings of
his last two ABC productions, "Storm of the Century" and "The
Shining." Viewing dipped by a little more than 1 million viewers
Monday (a number that will be reflected in next week's standings),
with the concluding episode to play Thursday. On another front, ABC
drew just mediocre ratings with "Dr. No," the first in its weekly
Saturday showcase of James Bond movies.</LD>
<LD>   Fox's sitcom spinoff "That '80s Show" got off to a strong start in
its premiere last Wednesday, playing opposite an NBC News special
exploring the White House, which also fared well.</LD>
<TE>   "Friends," meanwhile, remains red-hot, topping last week's
standings with a rerun episode and registering its highest repeat
rating among young adults in nearly three years. The series has seen
its numbers climb since "Survivor: Africa" ended. NBC edged CBS in
terms of overall viewing for the week, its first victory since
October.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In their first giddy optimism, the leaders of the French Revolution
figured they would just sweep away all the old traditions and
substitute bright, shiny new ones. There was a certain goofy, naive
charm to this idea--until it hardened into the fanaticism of the
Terror, anyway.</LD>
<LD>   They decided that the day would be neatly divided into 10 hours,
each made up of 100 minutes 100 seconds long. From 1793 to 1806, the
official calendar in all French-controlled territories began at the
fall equinox and consisted of 12 freshly named months of three 10-day
weeks, plus five holidays at the end of the year to use up the
leftover days. (This "new" calendar was actually one of the oldest.
The Egyptians had used the same basic plan thousands of years
earlier.)</LD>
<LD>   To replace the saints' days of the Catholic Church, the
revolutionaries commissioned one of their number, a poet named Fabre
d'Eglantine, to choose an official revolutionary name for every day
of the year. About a third of the ones he came up with were
food-related.</LD>
<TE>   For example, he named the 28th day of Frimaire (Dec. 18) truffle
day, Pluviose 12 (Jan. 31) became broccoli day and Ventose 25 (March
15) was dedicated to tuna. For some reason, all the names were for
raw ingredients except Thermidor 2 (July 20), bouillon day.
(Incidentally, there was no lobster day in Thermidor or any other
month.)</TE>
<TE>   Some months were relatively barren; Nivose (December-January) gave
the cook nothing to work with but rabbit and salt. But one four-day
stretch, Vendemaire 25-28 (Oct. 16-19), was practically a recipe in
itself--beef, eggplant, red pepper and tomato--particularly if you
could throw in some 3rd of Messidor (June 21): onions.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, this wacky system never caught on. In fact, there's
serious doubt that even back then anybody but Fabre d'Eglantine could
have told you offhand that Prairial 11 (May 30) was strawberry day.</TE>

<LD>When Saddleback Valley Plaza looked for a manager to launch a farmers
market in El Toro last summer, Sandy Heil took up the challenge. For
seven years she had helped her husband, Rick, with farmers markets in
Corona del Mar and San Clemente, and her children were old enough so
that she had the time. Last Thursday, as her market finished its
sixth month of operation, she had only one complaint: Rick "has never
even come by once to visit," she said with a smile.</LD>
<LD>   The market is small and features mostly farm employees, not the
farmers themselves, but Escondido grower Barbara Chapman is a notable
exception. She offered ruffled kaffir limes (the trees are mostly
valued for their leaves, but the rind and juice of the fruits are
also used in Southeast Asian cooking); Palestine sweet limes;
tutti-frutti-flavored Cara Cara pink-fleshed navel oranges; and
Vaniglia Sanguigno ("Vanilla Blood") acidless oranges, with
light-pink pulp and a mild flavor reminiscent of an orange
Creamsicle. She also sold her own homemade preserves, including
yellow Conadria fig jam and fabulous Persian mulberry syrup--great on
vanilla ice cream.</LD>
<TE>   Among local growers, Smith Farms had fresh Brussels sprouts, sugar
snap and English peas, celery, asparagus and artichokes. Tanaka Farms
of Irvine displayed beets, carrots, cauliflower and butternut squash.
Alfredo Barrios, selling for his nephew, Javier Berumen of
Westminster, had slender, tender "second-sprout" broccoli, along with
cauliflower, leeks and cabbage.</TE>
<TE>   From Fallbrook, Eli Hofshi's stand brought arugula, collard greens
and chard, Booth cherimoyas and four varieties of fine avocados:
Pinkerton, Hass, Bacon and Fuerte. Hector Ramos of Carlsbad sold
large, firm and bright red Camarosa strawberries, with decent flavor
for January berries.</TE>

<HD>I Love That Spotsy Soup, Lumps and All</HD>
<DH>Meet rivels, a Pennsylvania Dutch tradition/addiction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDY SZWARC</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rivels means lumps. Children in Pennsylvania Dutch communities learn
this at an early age. That's because rivels are loved by every child,
much like macaroni and cheese. It's a fondness few outgrow.</LD>
<LD>   Growing up with a Pennsylvania Dutch grandmother, I discovered
rivels with my very first bowl of her "spotsy soup." At least that's
what we kids called it. To Grandma Filson, it was what she served her
large family during the Depression and whenever times were hard. My
parents grew up on it, and so did I.</LD>
<LD>   Grandma might have made it because it was so economical--little
more than water, a potato and dumplings--but we just loved this
stick-to-our-ribs soup because of how it tasted. It was the rivels
that made it completely irresistible.</LD>
<TE>   Rivels are tiny egg dumplings made by dropping bits of batter into
boiling liquid until they rise to the surface, light, plump and
slightly chewy. In parts of Germany and Alsace, rivels are known by
other names, such as spaetzli, spatzen or spaetzle.</TE>
<TE>   When Grandma's family immigrated to rural Pennsylvania centuries
ago, they brought many recipes from their home in the Rhineland of
southern Germany. They were among those called the Pennsylvania
Dutch, who lived simply on what their land could provide, valuing the
virtues of hard work and self-sufficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Although their German recipes evolved to reflect the foods
available on their American homesteads, many of Grandma's
Pennsylvania Dutch specialties clearly show their Old World
heritage--such as her endless meat-and-dumpling dishes.</TE>
<TE>   Like generations of Pennsylvania Dutch women, Grandma was a genius
with food. She had to be. The family's survival depended on her
ability to gather and put up foods to see them through the winter.</TE>
<TE>   Especially remarkable was her talent at transforming the most
modest ingredients into satisfying meals day after day. It's this
resourcefulness that defines Pennsylvania Dutch cookery. It
epitomizes simplicity, and its dishes are warm and nourishing--in
other words, just plain comforting.</TE>
<TE>   Grandma used rivels in many ways. She plopped them into soups to
make them more substantial--sometimes merely meat or vegetable
broths, perhaps delicately enhanced with spring greens and herbs,
other times hearty chicken and corn chowders, or ham and bean soups.</TE>
<TE>   When times were good, we enjoyed rivels with her German meatballs,
pork chops, smoked sausage and pork roast, sometimes alongside
homemade sauerkraut or pickled red cabbage. As side dishes they were
drizzled with or fried in butter and tossed with all sorts of
luscious things such as caraway seeds, cheese, sour cream, fried
onions, bacon or browned bread crumbs. We liked them better than
potatoes, filling our plates, and even drowning them in meat gravy
when we could.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting the homes of friends, I discovered every Pennsylvania
Dutch family makes rivels differently. Although I love them all, I
remain partial to Grandma's. She was never one for gadgets, and her
low-tech method is still the one I use.</TE>
<TE>   It can be replicated in any kitchen. Start by stirring together
flour, salt and eggs with just enough milk to give the right
consistency. "The more eggs, the more tender the rivels," she'd say.
One egg and about 1/3 cup of milk per cup of flour was typical of
hers. Watching her, I learned that the "right" consistency is a
gloppy mixture that's thicker than cake batter but not as firm as
dough. It just mounds in a spoon.</TE>
<TE>   Tilting the bowl of batter over boiling salted liquid, take a
kitchen spoon and scoop out teaspoon amounts of batter and quickly
drop them into the liquid. The spoon makes a fleeting dip into the
water, too, to help the batter fall off cleanly. The little dumplings
that form will be varied in size and shape, which makes them more fun
to eat.</TE>
<TE>   To keep the rivels separate while they cook, give them an
occasional gentle stir and be careful not to overcrowd the pot, so
that the liquid is always simmering. Within minutes, the rivels rise
to the top and are done. They'll have fattened two or three times in
size and have a delicious chewiness. If they aren't being left in a
soup, scoop them out of the cooking liquid with a slotted spoon,
drain, then enrich them as your heart desires.</TE>
<TE>   Equally practical, some cooks mix their rivel batter a bit thicker
on a large cutting board and cut off small pieces with a flat butter
knife and drop them into the boiling liquid. Other rivel-makers press
the batter through a large-hole colander, a ricer or a spaetzle
press. This makes little round squiggly noodles of a more consistent
size.</TE>
<TE>   For another style of rivels, some Pennsylvania Dutch women make
them without milk, then crumble bits of the dry dough between their
fingers and drop them into boiling liquid. Their rivels are rice- or
pea-sized and, I think, best for thickening soups and stews.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what type of rivels are made, they're not much to look
at. Lumpy, misshapen little blobs of dull beige dough, they bob
around in everyday soups whose initial purpose was to feed a family
fast, using whatever was in the larder.</TE>
<TE>   I loved rivels as a kid, but nowadays they make even more sense to
me. Not because they're practical or delicious, but because whenever
I settle down to a big bowl of them, their familiar taste is what I
really hunger for.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rivels</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   During the spring and early summer when her garden greened,
Grandma would occasionally embellish her rivel batter with chopped
spinach or dandelion (cooked and squeezed dry), fresh herbs, pinches
of nutmeg and/or grated sharp cheeses. But most often she kept it
simple. The flourish came later with the toppings. Rivels make
sublime side dishes, especially when dressed up. A big bowl of rivels
also makes an absolutely comforting kitchen supper.</TE>
<TE>   2 cups flour</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   2 eggs</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup milk</TE>
<TE>   Bring lightly salted water to boil in a large soup pot or Dutch
oven.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, stir the flour, salt, eggs and milk together in a large
bowl until they form a thick batter, adding more milk if necessary to
form a dough. Working in small batches, press the dough through a
colander with 1/4-inch holes into the boiling liquid, using a spoon.
(Or press through a ricer or spaetzle machine or drop the batter by
small teaspoonfuls into the boiling water.) Boil gently, stirring
once or twice, until the rivels rise to the surface and are tender,
about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon or drain them in a
colander. Repeat with the remaining dough.</TE>
<TE>   You can toss the hot rivels in melted butter to prevent them from
sticking. Or, you can fry them in melted butter until they're golden.
Serve plain or dress up with any desired toppings.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Spotsy" Soup</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   My Grandma Filson used to make "spotsy" soup by the gallons.
Typical of Pennsylvania Dutch soups, it's humble but substantial,
with plenty of "stuff" in it. It was nourishing "poverty soups" such
as this that enabled Grandma and other Pennsylvania Dutch women to
feed their farm families during difficult times. Though her version
was made with water, I prefer beef stock. I hope you won't shun its
paltry ingredients. It tastes like a cross between French onion soup
and potato soup, with rivels.</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons butter</TE>
<TE>   2 onions, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   4 to 6 cups beef stock or other stock</TE>
<TE>   1 large potato, diced</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 recipe Rivels batter</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter in a large soup pot or Dutch oven over medium-high
heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring, until golden brown but still
soft, about 5 to 8 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Add the stock, potato and salt and pepper to taste. (Grandma used
water instead of stock, but I find stock adds a nice meaty flavor.)
Lower the heat to medium, cover and simmer until the potato is just
tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Uncover. Press the rivel batter through a colander with 1/4-inch
holes into the soup (or use a ricer or spaetzle machine). Boil
gently, stirring once or twice, until the rivels rise to the surface
and are tender, about 5 to 10 minutes.</TE>

<HD>Pie for Dinner: The Mediterranean Pleasure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA ROSE SHULMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The noted French chef Careme pronounced the vegetable torte well and
truly dead by the first part of the 19th century.</LD>
<LD>   "Tortes are no longer fancy enough to appear on our opulent
tables, for the simple reason that their form is too vulgar," he
wrote in "Treatise on Hot Entrees." "Even the bourgeois class looks
upon them with disdain, and will only eat hot pates and vol-au-vents,
whereas in the past, important people were happy to begin their
home-cooked meal with a modest torte."</LD>
<LD>   He may have jumped the gun. I don't think I've ever gone to a
Mediterranean country--France or anyplace else--and not come home
with a new recipe for one of these savory pies.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout the Mediterranean you find variations. Usually, they're
based on the same vegetable themes--greens of all kinds, winter or
summer squash, leeks, eggplant, onions. What really distinguishes one
country's pies from another are the fine points, the flavorings, the
cheeses and the crusts.</TE>
<TE>   A winter squash torte from Provence, earthy with sage and
surrounded by a bready olive oil crust, would never be mistaken for a
Greek pumpkin torte, the filling redolent with mint and leeks, set
between layers of crisp filo dough.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, a Greek pie of spinach or bitter greens will be
fragrant with dill and packed with feta cheese, while its French or
Italian cousin will have a more moderate amount of Gruyere and/or
Parmesan, as well as garlic, thyme, rosemary and parsley.</TE>
<TE>   Tortes take a little bit of time to make, but they are forgiving.
And you can make them in steps. The order in which you do things
isn't that important--you can make part or all of a filling one day,
and the crust another (or vice versa), and put it all together when
you're ready to bake.</TE>
<TE>   Because they keep so well, they also can be made ahead, or frozen.
If you do the whole thing, from start to finish, you'll be working
for about an hour, but none of the work will be that difficult. The
yeasted olive oil crust is about the easiest pastry I've ever made.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, they're big, dramatic and versatile. You can make
them in a tart or springform pan, as a double-crusted torte, or you
can make a more open-faced galette and bake it on a cookie sheet.
They are meant to be served as a main dish, and they're good hot or
cold.</TE>
<TE>   Tortes make great party fare, but they're also a wonderful meal
for the family; and leftovers pack easily into a lunchbox. This is
one way I can get my 3 1/2-year-old to eat spinach. Of course, he

<TE>   Greek Winter Squash and Leek Pie</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 35 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1  1/2
hours * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 pounds winter squash, such as 1 large or 2 smaller butternut
squash</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup chopped Italian parsley</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup chopped fresh mint</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</TE>
<TE>   1 cup crumbled feta cheese (about 5 ounces)</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (2 ounces)</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons olive oil, divided, plus 3 to 4 tablespoons for
brushing filo dough</TE>
<TE>   3 large leeks, white and light green parts only, cleaned and
chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 large cloves garlic, minced or pressed</TE>
<TE>   3 eggs</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   9 sheets filo dough</TE>
<TE>   Halve the squash and scrape away the seeds and membranes, then cut
the flesh into 4-inch-square pieces. (If using butternut, cut it in
half crosswise just above the bulbous bottom part, then cut these
halves into lengthwise quarters and scrape away the seeds and
membranes.)</TE>
<TE>   Steam the squash until tender, 15 to 20 minutes, then transfer to
a colander and allow to cool and drain for another 15 minutes
(butternut squash will not be watery). When the squash has cooled,
peel and place in a bowl. Mash it with a fork, a large wooden spoon,
a potato masher or a pestle. Stir in the parsley, mint, nutmeg, feta
and Parmesan.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a
large nonstick skillet over medium heat and add the leeks. Cook,
stirring, until tender and just beginning to color, about 5 to 10
minutes. Add the garlic and continue to cook for another minute,
until fragrant. Remove from the heat and add to the squash. Beat the
eggs and remove 2 tablespoons for brushing the tart, then mix with
the squash. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Brush a 10- or 12-inch tart pan or cake pan with 1 tablespoon of
olive oil and layer in 4 sheets of filo dough, placing them not quite
evenly on top of each other so that the edges overlap the sides of
the pan all the way around. Brush each sheet with olive oil (or a
mixture of olive oil and melted butter) before adding the next sheet.</TE>
<TE>   Fill with the squash mixture and fold the edges over. Brush the
folded-over filo with olive oil, then layer 5 more sheets of dough
over the top, brushing each sheet with olive oil. Crimp the edges
into the sides of the pan.</TE>
<TE>   Brush the top with the beaten egg you set aside. Pierce the top of
the pie in several places with a sharp knife.</TE>
<TE>   Bake until the top is golden brown, 40 to 50 minutes. Serve warm
or at room temperature. Recrisp the crust if necessary in a
375-degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   Pumpkin Torte</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 45 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 2 hours *
Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   In Provence, many of the vegetable tortes are bound with rice,
which gives them both substance and texture, and makes them easy to
slice, thus very portable. This wonderful torte is seasoned with
sage, one of winter squash's favorite companions. The filling also
makes a terrific gratin, without the crust, and it can also be made
as a galette.</TE>
<TE>   Yeasted Olive Oil Pastry</TE>
<TE>   2 to 2 1/2 pounds winter squash</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 large onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   3 large cloves garlic, minced or pressed</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup cooked Arborio or medium-grain rice</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons chopped parsley</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup grated Gruyere cheese, tightly packed (2 ounces)</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (1 ounce)</TE>
<TE>   3 eggs, beaten</TE>
<TE>   Salt (about 1/2 teaspoon or more)</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   Halve the squash and scrape away the seeds and membranes, then cut
the flesh into 4-inch-square pieces. (If using butternut, cut it in
half crosswise, just above the bulbous bottom part, then cut these
halves into lengthwise quarters and scrape away the seeds and
membranes.)</TE>
<TE>   Steam the squash until tender, 15 to 20 minutes, then transfer to
a colander and allow to cool and drain for another 15 minutes
(butternut squash will not be watery). When the squash has cooled,
peel and place in a bowl. Mash with a fork, a large wooden spoon, a
potato masher or a pestle.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil over medium heat in a large nonstick skillet and add
the onion. Cook, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes, then stir
in the garlic. Cook until fragrant, another minute or two. Remove
from the heat and toss with the squash, sage, rice, parsley, Gruyere
and Parmesan cheeses, all but 2 tablespoons of the eggs, salt and
pepper to taste. Taste and adjust seasonings.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Oil a 10-inch or 12-inch tart pan
with a removable bottom or springform pan.</TE>
<TE>   Roll out two thirds of the pastry and line the pan with the edges
overhanging. Fill the crust with the squash mixture. Top with the
remaining pastry, then crimp the edges of the top and bottom pastry
together. Cut 4 small slits in the top crust with a sharp knife,
brush with the reserved beaten egg and place in the oven. Bake until
golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Allow to rest for at least 10 minutes
before serving. This can also be served at room temperature.</TE>

<TE>   Yeasted Olive Oil Pastry</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes
plus 1 hour rising</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yeasted crusts are easier to manipulate than short crusts. They
don't crack and tear. Just be sure to roll this nice and thin so that
it doesn't become too bready. When making the tortes, prepare the
pastry first, then make the filling while it's rising.</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons active dry yeast</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup lukewarm water</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 egg, at room temperature, beaten</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup olive oil</TE>
<TE>   2 to 2 1/2 cups unbleached flour, or use half whole-wheat flour,
half unbleached</TE>
<TE>   3/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Dissolve the yeast in the water, add the sugar and allow to sit
until the mixture is creamy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the egg and the
olive oil. Combine 2 cups of the flour and the salt and stir into the
yeast mixture. You can use a bowl and wooden spoon for this, or a
mixer; combine the ingredients using the paddle, then switch to the
dough hook. Work the dough until it comes together in a coherent
mass, adding flour as necessary. The dough should be springy and not
stick to your hands. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and
knead for a few minutes, adding flour as necessary, until the dough
is smooth; do not overwork the dough. Shape into a ball. Place in a
lightly oiled bowl, cover the dough tightly with plastic wrap and
allow the dough to rise in a draft-free spot until doubled in size,
about 1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, gently knead a
couple of times and cut into 2 equal pieces (or as directed in the
recipe). Shape each piece into a ball. Cover the dough loosely with
plastic wrap and let rest for 5 minutes, then roll out into thin
rounds, as directed in the recipe, and line pans. If not using right
away, freeze the dough to prevent it from rising and becoming too
bready. The dough can be transferred directly from the freezer to the
oven.</TE>
<TE>   Makes enough for 1 (10- or 12-inch) double-crusted torte or 2
(10-inch) tarts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Greens and Potato Torta or Galette</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 1 hour * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour 55
minutes * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   This luscious pie works well with a number of greens--chard,
rapini, beet greens, spinach, whatever looks best in the market. It's
quite dramatic as a galette.</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound small boiling potatoes such as baby Yukon Gold or new
potatoes, peeled</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   2 to 2 1/2 pounds greens (chard, beet greens, rapini, spinach)</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 large cloves garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup chopped Italian parsley</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 cup ricotta or low-fat cottage cheese</TE>
<TE>   2 eggs, beaten</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons milk</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup grated Gruyere cheese, tightly packed (about 2 ounces)</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup grated Parmesan (about 1 ounce)</TE>
<TE>   Dash freshly grated nutmeg</TE>
<TE>   Yeasted Olive Oil Pastry</TE>
<TE>   Place the potatoes and 2 teaspoons of salt in a large pot of water
(you'll be cooking the greens in the same water) and bring to a boil.
Reduce the heat to medium, cover partly and boil the potatoes until
tender when pierced with a knife, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, stem
the greens and wash the leaves thoroughly, making sure to remove all
sand.</TE>
<TE>   When the potatoes are done, remove from the water and set aside
until cool enough to handle, then cut in 1/2-inch slices. Bring the
water back to a rolling boil and add another teaspoon of salt and the
greens. Blanch until just tender, about 2 minutes. Remove from the
water with a slotted spoon or deep-fry skimmer and transfer
immediately to a bowl of cold water. Drain and squeeze dry. It is not
necessary to remove every drop of water. Chop coarsely and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil over medium heat in a large nonstick skillet. Add the
onion and cook, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the
garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds to a minute.
Stir in the greens, potatoes, parsley and basil and gently toss
together. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and transfer to a
large bowl.</TE>
<TE>   In a food processor, process the ricotta or cottage cheese until
smooth. Scrape down the sides. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the beaten
eggs, and add the rest to the processor, along with the milk. Beat
together, then transfer to the bowl with the greens. Stir in the
Gruyere and Parmesan cheeses, add more salt and pepper and the
nutmeg, and combine everything thoroughly. Taste and adjust
seasonings.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Gently punch down the pastry dough.
If making a galette, roll out into a large, thin circle, about 16
inches in diameter. Top with the filling, leaving a 21/2-inch edge,
and fold the edges in over the filling, draping folds all the way
around. If you can stretch the dough up to the middle, gather the
edges together and shape a little top knot. Otherwise you can leave
an opening in the center. If making a torta, oil a 10-inch pie dish,
springform pan or a tart pan with a removable rim. Roll out
two-thirds of the dough into a thin circle, and line the pie dish or
pan; ease the dough into the edges. There should be some overhang.
Fill with the greens mixture. Roll out the other piece of dough into
a circle, and place on top of the filling. Fold the edges of the
bottom crust over the top crust, and crimp the dough all the way
around the edge. Gently score the top of the dough with a paring
knife. Brush the torte or galette with the reserved egg.</TE>
<TE>   Bake until the top is golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove from
the heat and cool for at least 10 minutes before serving. Serve hot
or warm.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few miles east of downtown Los Angeles, tucked near the Long Beach
Freeway, a short stretch of Cesar E. Chavez Avenue is like an
old-time Mexican settlement. It's an area where immigrants arrived
long ago, a part of town where Mexican heritage thrives. It's a place
where tortillas taste like tortillas should, where a bakery still
makes pan dulce as it has since 1928.</LD>
<LD>   In one small, easily walkable area, roughly bounded by Ford
Boulevard and McDonnell Avenue, you'll find shops, restaurants and
bakeries that are both historic and fascinating.</LD>
<LD>   This part of East L.A. feels like a small town from the 19th
century. The avenue is quiet, not crowded and bustling. Spiky maguey
cactuses stand outside the parking lot of one restaurant. Not far
away there's a memorial chapel, now empty, that looks like the
location for a western film shoot. Even the bus stops are ornamental,
with curlicued black iron enclosures.</LD>
<TE>   Merchants tell how their businesses originated generations ago in
Guadalajara or Zacatecas or Guanajuato. Barreras Chicharrones on Ford
Boulevard traces its origins to 1875. Panaderia La Fama has been in
business since 1928. El Gallo Bakery opened in 1949. The quaint,
white, country-style church El Mesias was constructed in 1924 by
members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and the large bell in the
enclosure outside Our Lady of Solitude Church (La Soledad) dates from
1937. Next to it, the Plaza La Soledad offers a place to rest for a
moment.</TE>
<TE>   The food is genuinely Mexican. Tortillas are made from ground
corn, not commercial masa flour. Shops sell succulent tamales,
intricate Mexican sweet breads and snow cones with natural fruit
toppings--even pinatas for a party.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to three restaurants, two bakeries and two
tortillerias, the businesses range from a pet store to beauty and
bridal shops. Galeria Xochitl displays original work by Latino
artists. Botanica La Merced sells Mexican medicinal herbs. A sign in
the window of Sloan's Dry Cleaners advertises nopales limpios (fresh,
cleaned cactus paddles) for sale. The Brooklyn &amp; Ford corner market
recalls the era when Cesar E. Chavez was Brooklyn Avenue. Farther
north on Ford is Majestic Poultry, which sells live chickens.</TE>
<TE>   Parking on the quiet residential side streets is unlimited,
allowing plenty of time to stroll, browse and shop.</TE>
<TE>   1 Tamales Liliana's. This place has much more to offer than
tamales. It's a full-fledged Mexican restaurant with a lively menu of
flautas, sopes, gorditas, huaraches, enchiladas and tacos and a few
meat dishes. The tamales, $1 each, are packed to go at a takeout
counter. Fillings include meat in red or green chile, chicken with
vegetables and chile strips with cheese. There are also sweet tamales
that contain raisins and pineapple and a sweetened tamal de elote
that is made from ground fresh corn. As the waitress said, it's "muy
rico."</TE>
<TE>   Tamales Liliana's, 4619 Cesar E. Chavez Ave. (323) 780-0989.</TE>
<TE>   2 Gallos Grill. Savory aromas waft outside, luring you into this
Southwestern-style restaurant, which specializes in Mexican cuts of
beef grilled over an almond-wood fire. Try gallitos--a sabana steak,
which is a long, thin sheet of meat, folded around Jack cheese, ham,
onion and tomato and grilled. It comes with a quesadilla, grilled
green onions--the Mexican kind with a bulb at the end--rice or beans,
tortillas and a selection of salsas. Other choices include arrachera
(flap meat), carne adobada (marinated meat), carne asada, New York
steak, filete and brochetas. To go with them try the tall, sweet
drink called pepino. It's made with cucumbers.</TE>
<TE>   The grill offers taco combos and tortas (sandwiches) for lunch. On
weekends, a brunch menu includes enchiladas, sopes and chilaquiles.
The patio out back is nice on a warm day.</TE>
<TE>   Gallos Grill, 4533 Cesar E. Chavez Ave. (323) 980-8669.</TE>
<TE>   3 El Gallo Bakery. The sweet perfume of freshly baked pan dulce
entices one to take home sacks full. This is a good idea, because El
Gallo makes breads that require so much hand work they have
disappeared from many panaderias.</TE>
<TE>   A specialty is the rosa, a strip of dough twirled in the air to
form a rose that is then painted with pink sugar. Negritos are capped
with cinnamon dough hand-pinched into little points. Airy, round
campechanas resemble glazed puff pastry. Libros (books) are glazed
rectangles with many "pages" (layers) of dough. Monos (bow ties),
raisin buns called guayabas (guavas) and huge, slightly sweet yellow
cuernos (horns) are only a few of the many temptations. Cookie-like
chamucos, with an outer rim of cinnamon dough and an inner circle of
egg and sugar paste, are especially good at this bakery.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to pan dulce and bolillos, El Gallo sells soft,
slightly sweet dinner rolls that are wonderful for ham sandwiches.</TE>
<TE>   El Gallo Bakery, 4546 Cesar E. Chavez Ave. (323) 263-9551.</TE>
<TE>   4 La Carreta. Folksy and homey, La Carreta (the cart) is a
restaurant hangout for local politicos. It's popular for breakfast,
judging from the long list of morning food including huevos a la
Mexicana, huevos rancheros and chilaquiles. However, the specialty of
the house is beef barbacoa, and the recipe, which appeared years ago
in the Times Food section, is exhibited on the wall that separates
the open kitchen from the restaurant. Host Manuel Plantillas dishes
up plenty of charm. When a little boy asked if the flowers in the
restaurant were real, Plantillas said they were not, then added, "The
real flower is here," gesturing toward the boy's mother.</TE>
<TE>   La Carreta, 4538 1/2 Cesar E. Chavez Ave. (323) 261-1365.</TE>
<TE>   5 La Azteca Tortilleria. At first glance, the shop may appear drab
and empty, but don't be fooled; it's tortilla heaven. The tortillas,
tamales and other foods to go are in the back, where you can't see
them from the entrance.</TE>
<TE>   A heady aroma of dried corn drifts up from the thick, meaty
handmade corn tortillas, so fresh they're still warm when you buy
them. Eat one on the spot, then take the rest home to grill and eat
plain, spread with butter or topped with melted cheese. La Azteca's
handmade flour tortillas contain enough lard to make them soft and
tender. Both kinds, corn and flour, are $1.50 a dozen.</TE>
<TE>   Signs at the counter announce that champurrado, a hot,
chocolate-flavored masa drink, is available daily, while menudo and
lamb's heads are weekend specials.</TE>
<TE>   La Azteca Tortilleria, 4538 Cesar E. Chavez Ave. (323) 262-5977.</TE>
<TE>   6 Eclipse de Mexico. Rustic wooden dining sets just right for a
hacienda are on sale in this large furniture and accessories store.
The most unusual set displayed recently was painted bright blue and
decorated with calla lilies, known in Mexico as alcatraces and used
as a motif for everything from dishes and tiles to clothing. Eclipse
also sells decorative Mexican plates and glassware in bold colors,
including a stand that holds a large pitcher and matching tumblers,
just right for the fruity drinks called aguas frescas.</TE>
<TE>   Eclipse de Mexico, 4512 Cesar E. Chavez Ave. (323) 262-4697.</TE>
<TE>   7 BJ Party Supplies. Come here for pinatas. If you don't like the
ones on display, there's a counter for special orders.</TE>
<TE>   Notice the stacks of boxed candies imported from Mexico. Beyond is
a room devoted to decorations for Mexican-themed parties. Here you
might find molcajetes (stone mortars for grinding), aluminum tortilla
presses large and small, lime squeezers, bean pots, pottery
casseroles, straw tortilla holders and tiny sombreros and serape
strips for party favors.</TE>
<TE>   BJ Party Supplies, 342 N. Ford Blvd. (323) 263-5014.</TE>
<TE>   8 La Fama Panaderia. The pastries here range from chocolate
eclairs, cream horns and fancy cakes to pan dulce and breads stuffed
with cheese and jalapenos. Specialties include light, fluffy pan de
huevo (egg bread), topped with swirls of sugar paste to make the buns
called conchas. Try piedras (rocks), big cookie-breads that are dark
and rough-looking but tender and sweet when you bite into them.
They're made with corn flour. Try also the oatmeal cookies, and the
empanadas de calabaza (squash turnovers).</TE>
<TE>   If you're lucky, a tray of pan con crema will be in the display
case. This luscious pastry consists of a cookie crust topped with a
thick layer of cream and baked until golden brown.</TE>
<TE>   La Fama Panaderia, 420 N. Ford Blvd. (323) 267-8610.</TE>
<TE>   9 Zacatecas Raspados. Red, white and blue-green tiles decorate the
front of this small shop, which serves crushed ice drenched with
toppings popular in Mexico. Choices include guava, mango, pineapple,
strawberry, peach, lime, coconut, rompope (a liqueur that resembles
eggnog), cajeta (a thick caramel), jamaica and tamarindo. It also
dispenses licuados, blended drinks made with mamey, guanabana,
papaya, strawberry, banana or flavored yogurt.</TE>
<TE>   Zacatecas Raspados, 422 N. Ford Blvd. (323) 264-7651.</TE>
<TE>   10 Barreras Chicharrones. This business primarily sells wholesale
to markets, delis and restaurants but welcomes walk-in customers.</TE>
<TE>   Its warehouse-like quarters are jammed with gigantic bags of crisp
fried pork skins, but there's a smaller bag that's practical for home
use. The two types sold are chicharron delgado (fried pork belly
skin), which remains crisp but not hard and brittle, and chicharron
grueso, hand-cut pork leg skin that includes some of the fat and
meat. The pork skins are fried in rendered pork fat produced on the
premises. The fat is also useful for tamales and other traditional
Mexican dishes, but it only comes in six-gallon buckets.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Barreras recalls how his grandfather once operated the
business from his garage. The plant is now USDA-inspected.</TE>
<TE>   Barreras Chicharrones, 460 N. Ford Blvd. (323) 268-7307.</TE>
<TE>   11 La Fortaleza. This large tortilla factory sells mainly to
restaurants but also has a rather inconspicuous window where retail
customers can buy corn and flour tortillas, chips and masa for
tortillas or tamales. The corn tortillas, made from ground corn
rather than instant masa flour, are unusually flavorful, soft and
flexible, excellent for enchiladas and soft tacos or to accompany
Mexican dishes. La Fortaleza makes both plain and colored tortilla
chips and also produces colored tortillas for use as wraps. Another
tortilla factory, La Reina, is located on Ford but has no retail
outlet.</TE>
<TE>   La Fortaleza, 525 N. Ford Blvd. (323) 261-1211.</TE>

<LD>The rest of us might simply have a garage sale, but when Debbie
Reynolds and daughter Carrie Fisher decided to clean out the closets
(for a good cause, of course), their cornucopia of memorabilia and
personal effects went up for bid on Sothebys.com. How about a pair of
slightly used, high-heeled tennis shoes, worn by Fisher? Or a
hairbrush that once touched Reynolds' tresses? Or the irresistible
pinstriped top worn by Reynolds in her exercise video "Do It Debbie's
Way," estimated to fetch between $300 and $400?</LD>
<LD>   "I decided to do it when I ran out of space," said Reynolds by
phone from Florida. "I keep accumulating things. You can say I'm a
pack rat."</LD>
<LD>   There are a few gems in the collection, for those with deeper
pockets. The platinum and diamond wedding band given to Reynolds by
ex-husband Eddie Fisher is estimated to draw between $4,000 and
$6,000. Fisher left Reynolds in 1959, after four years of marriage,
and the ring comes with a note from the actress, saying, "Shortly
after our marriage, Eddie went down the Nile with Elizabeth Taylor"
(who became his next wife). "I had that for all these years,"
Reynolds said. "And I was thinking, why do I have that? That's just
silly. Someone else will enjoy that."</LD>
<TE>   Fisher is also selling jewelry from an ex. A pearl necklace given
to her by singer-songwriter Paul Simon is expected to go for $1,500
to $2,000, and a vintage 1920s diamond watch from $6,000 to $8,000.</TE>
<TE>   Props and memorabilia from the "Star Wars" movies, including an
"Ewok instrument" featured in "Return of the Jedi," are also
available. Seems there are more potential buyers for the spacey flute
than the wedding band. At press time, the instrument had received
five bids, the ring none. However, a spokeswoman for Sothebys.com
cautioned that bidders are savvy and often wait until the last day of
the auction to get the best price.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds from the sale will benefit Reynolds' Hollywood Motion
Picture Museum. Interested buyers can log on to the auction house Web
site and make bids until Feb. 7.</TE>
<TE>   A Different Sort Of Action Figure</TE>
<TE>   Porn star Jenna Jameson has starred in 50 films and graced more
than 300 magazine covers. Some say she is the most downloaded adult
star on the Internet, and her countless awards have earned her a
legitimacy rare in her industry.</TE>
<TE>   Today), however, Jameson reaches the true summit of modern
success: She debuts her own action figure at the Hustler store on
Sunset Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   The Jenna Doll, which features the actress as a superhero from the
1998 film "Wicked Weapon," is intended for the 18-and-older toy
enthusiast. The 7-inch doll features all four of Jameson's tattoos
and--naturally--is anatomically correct. Doll sculptors at Van
Nuys-based Plastic Fantasy Inc. photographed and videotaped Jameson
to ensure authenticity in their design. The doll features a
true-to-life "heartbreaker" tattoo on its right buttock, purple high
heels and what's described as a purple plastic clip-on "vixen teddy."
Accessories include a stripper pole and a pedestal. The doll is
proportioned to match Jameson's 5-foot-5, 104-pound figure. Her
real-life measurements are 34(D)-23-32. "The good thing about a doll
is you can tell them, 'Can you make my butt look a little firmer?'"
Jameson told us. "And you know I did!"</TE>
<TE>   The company's founder, Jerry Macaluso, is a veteran toy designer
known for products based on the TV shows "Star Trek," "Spider-Man"
and "Power Rangers," among others. He said Jameson's doll is the
first of many planned female adult star action figures. "We're
already moving along on one other Jenna," he said. "The next one will
have a voice chip." The current model, whose retail price ranges from
$14.99 to $25, is being sold at Hustler stores nationwide and on the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Going Out in Style</TE>
<TE>   Tina Brown isn't one to dwell on failure. Two weeks after Miramax
pulled the plug on Talk magazine, the former editor has scheduled a
lavish "going out of business" party for Thursday at New York's
stylish lounge Glass. About 100 people are expected. "It's not like
when they first started," Glass owner Fernando told us. "Then they
had 3,000 people."</TE>
<TE>   A New Garcia</TE>
<TE>   A son was born to Andy Garcia and his wife, Marivi Lorido Garcia,
on Monday. Andres Antonio Garcia-Lorida weighed 7 pounds, 13 ounces.
He is the couple's first son. They have three daughters.</TE>

<HD>Impulsive, Daring Pippi Is Still a Reminder of Who We Want
to Be</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIBBY COPELAND</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The braids have been done to death. Remember Halloweens with little
girls wrapping wire hangers into their hair? Add a blue dress, one
sock up and one sock down, and voila, Pippi Longstocking.</LD>
<LD>   In some tiny, light-filled part of ourselves that sober maturity
never smothered, we all wish we could be Pippi, redheaded and
carefree, blessed with superhuman strength and a never-ending supply
of gold coins. Pippi, who didn't need anyone. Headstrong Pippi, who
skipped school, pretended to fly and never got hurt when she hit the
ground. Impulsive Pippi, who announced that her hot chocolate was
finished by upending the mug on her head, then licking the sweet
brown river from the tip of her nose. Pure wish fulfillment was what
Astrid Lindgren bequeathed when she wrote the first of her three
famous Pippi Longstocking books in the 1940s. "Pippi Longstocking"
came out in 1945 in Sweden, 1950 in the States. Lindgren died Monday
in her native Sweden. She was 94.</LD>
<TE>   The Pippi books were curiously subversive: rebellion barely
disguised as a little girl. Pippi lives entirely on her own and does
precisely as she wishes. She is sheer joie de vivre; the original
slacker, in torn duds and mismatched socks, with her best friend a
monkey. When the police show up to take her to school, she is
disdainful. Math class? "I have got along fine without any
pluttifikation tables for nine years," she declares, "and I guess
I'll get along without it from now on, too."</TE>
<TE>   She picks up grown men and carries them off her lawn. When she
runs back and hands them cookies, the gesture is either kind or
patronizing, depending on where you're coming from.</TE>
<TE>   Pippi "seems to live in a world of her own making," says
children's book historian Leonard Marcus. And Pippi is entirely
comfortable there, unlike Alice and Dorothy, who really just want to
go home.</TE>
<TE>   We all want to be Pippi, but few of us are. More likely we're a
Tommy or an Annika, Pippi's normal neighbors. They are the foils to
our outrageous Pippi: Annika, always concerned about the state of her
dress, and Tommy, whose ordinary-boy bravery seems feeble by
comparison with Pippi's. "Do you live here all alone?" Annika
anxiously asks Pippi when she first surveys her ramshackle house.</TE>
<TE>   To which the redhead replies, "Of course not!" There's the horse
and the monkey, too.</TE>
<TE>   Through Pippi, Lindgren posed the question of what really
mattered. "With laughter and seriousness, fantasy and a little
audacity, one becomes tall even if one is little--that's what she
taught us," Prime Minister Goran Persson said of his country's wildly
popular children's author.</TE>
<TE>   Pippi Longstocking doesn't need anyone, which is not to say she
doesn't need anyone. There is always something mysterious and sad
about Pippi's relationship with her father, who lives as a pirate on
the South Seas. This, and Pippi's occasional loneliness, are the only
elements that hint at something deeper. Lindgren herself didn't
always have it easy. She left her home town of Vimmerby for Stockholm
at 19, when she was pregnant and unmarried. She later married, had
another child, a daughter named Karin, for whom the first Pippi story
was invented. Her work won her dozens of prizes, including the Hans
Christian Andersen Medal in 1958 (and did a neat job of exporting
Swedish culture decades before IKEA came on the scene--countless
children learned from Pippi that pepparkakor is a kind of Swedish
cookie). Lindgren later became a children's and farm-animal rights
activist, moving beyond the spunky young girl she was famous for
creating. In 1989, visiting the United States to accept an award,
Lindgren explained to an interviewer why she turned to creating other
characters: "Pippi has had her life. She still exists for children
but not for me. For me, she's not there anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not, but she flies and flops and lifts and runs, even now,
in those books--still big sellers 50 years later. "She defies
gravity," historian Marcus says. "She's not bound by the usual
rules."</TE>

<BD>THE GUY CHRONICLES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Football is a kids' game, invented to give a lot of people a lot of
fun."</LD>
<LD>   --Joe Kapp,</LD>
<LD>   former quarterback</LD>
<TE>   "What I miss most is the violence."</TE>
<TE>   --Dick Butkus,</TE>
<TE>   former linebacker</TE>
<TE>   The glory of touch football is that it's a game that never
evolves--no instant replay, no domed stadiums--just a bunch of domed
dads out on a chilly Sunday, trying to keep middle age at bay and
stay healthy and desirable for our wives.</TE>
<TE>   Because let me tell you a little secret about today's wives:
They're lovely and caring. But let yourself go a little and they'll
dump you like a load of shirts. Just ask Gino.</TE>
<TE>   "She dumped me again," Gino told me one night at the local steak
place.</TE>
<TE>   "She can't dump you," I say. "You're her husband."</TE>
<TE>   Gino explains that some women become so accustomed to dumping us
that by the time they marry, it's imprinted on the right side of
their female cortex, just behind their pretty foreheads. To them,
dumping becomes second nature. Like blinking or buying on credit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm constantly trying to win her back," says Gino.</TE>
<TE>   Which is why we're out here playing touch football on Sunday
afternoon, a bunch of aging Huck Finns trying to hang on to our
boyhoods and our marriages, an improbable goal.</TE>
<TE>   "You, run a slant," Hank says, designing a play in the huddle.</TE>
<TE>   "You, go long," he tells someone else.</TE>
<TE>   "Me?"</TE>
<TE>   "Hook-and-go," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Then we all clap our hands and line up for the next thrilling
play. Hank likes when we clap our hands after huddles. Shows we're a
unit.</TE>
<TE>   And off I go, running my hook-and-go pattern, which I make up as I
run it, sort of the way I make soup.</TE>
<TE>   "What was that?" Hank says when I come back to the huddle.</TE>
<TE>   "Hook-and-go," I gasp.</TE>
<TE>   "Right," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, our games have become a little chaotic. We have had such
huge turnouts--eight to 10 players per team, many of them our sons
and daughters--that the plays unfold with the skill and timing of a
badly botched convenience store holdup.</TE>
<TE>   Now, I admire chaos in a sporting event. Too much precision, and
you lose the fans. A soulless precision is the NFL's worst enemy.
That and those awful indoor stadiums. Tombs, really. Give me games in
the snow and the slop. Give me touch football.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened there?" I ask Hank after eight of our 10 receivers
collide on a crossing pattern.</TE>
<TE>   "Not a clue," Hank growls.</TE>
<TE>   By the second quarter, I have taken to inventing my own pass
patterns and then naming them after people I admire.</TE>
<TE>   On short yardage, I run something called the Jayne Mansfield. Long
yardage, the Loni Anderson, a big loop followed by another big loop,
followed by big hair.</TE>
<TE>   "What's he doing?" I can hear the free safety ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Heck if I know," the cornerback says, and they turn their
attention to players younger and more dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   I used to be a player. At 19, I could catch a jellybean dropped
from a fighter jet. At 25, I was quick as a stolen kiss.</TE>
<TE>   Now, two decades later, I have almost no game left. So I make the
most of what I have, running pass routes shaped like chesty actresses
of yesteryear. Barbara Eden. Adrienne Barbeau.</TE>
<TE>   "How'd he get so open?" I hear Eisen ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Who cares?" Burlison says.</TE>
<TE>   One week, we made the mistake of putting Eisen and Burlison, both
lawyers, on the same team. Being attorneys, they won every rule
dispute by sheer stubbornness.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, they issued a restraining order against our nose
tackle, the little red-haired girl, who would patiently count "one
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi," then scamper like a
field mouse at their hairy lawyer legs.</TE>
<TE>   Later, in a crucial series, the two lawyers refused to honor our
call for a timeout, acting as if they were in court and couldn't hear
the other attorney objecting.</TE>
<TE>   "Timeout!" I screamed about four times, nearly pulling a hamstring
in my tongue.</TE>
<TE>   "Huh?" said Burlison.</TE>
<TE>   "Hike," said Eisen.</TE>
<TE>   "Timeout!" I screamed again.</TE>
<TE>   My advice: When forming teams for touch football, don't put all
the lawyers on the same team. Too competitive. Too tactical.</TE>
<TE>   My other advice: Always stretch. In football, and in life, be sure
to stretch. Stretch before the game. Stretch during the game. Stretch
in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Because once you've pulled a muscle, in your tongue or in your
leg, it is pulled forever. Sure, it'll heal a little, but only enough
to make you think you're fine again.</TE>
<TE>   Then snap. Ouch. Down you'll go. The sniper shot you never hear.</TE>
<TE>   "How many groin muscles do we have?" Eisen asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Me? Hundreds," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "I just pulled them all," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The dads--some pushing 40, others 50--play every down as if it's
our very last.</TE>
<TE>   And the kids, ranging in age from 10 to 16, play every down as if
it's a skit for a fifth-grade play, laughing in key moments and
mugging for the crowd. The kids' basic philosophy of football is that
if it makes someone laugh, it's a good play.</TE>
<TE>   "We done yet?" one of the dads mumbles after an hour.</TE>
<TE>   "We were done 20 years ago," Ulf says.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the game, the dads begin to lose all remaining body heat
out of the tops of our heads, a sort of chimney effect I can't
explain.</TE>
<TE>   The kids, meanwhile, get fresher and happier with every play. Most
are video game kids, unaccustomed to fresh air and sunlight. Many are
out of doors for the very first time. Like Huck Finn, they seem to
take to it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of nice to get out of the house," a teenager says on a
perfectly rainy and sloppy Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Touchdown.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Helen Yarmak couldn't have imagined the turn her life would take to
bring her to New York City's fashionable Fifth Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   A little more than a decade ago, Yarmak was a mathematician with a
doctorate living in Kiev, Ukraine, when it was still part of the
Soviet Union.</LD>
<LD>   She had an interest in fashion, and she experimented with designs,
turning bed sheets into dresses, but under the socialist system she
had little opportunity to explore her creative side.</LD>
<TE>   When her husband transferred to Moscow, Yarmak accompanied him,
but she couldn't find a job. To lift her spirits, she bought a pair
of cheap underwear and a piece of fine wool. Yarmak used them as a
basis for a new dress. That's when her career as a fashion designer
began. "I always felt I had something in addition to math in myself,"
says Yarmak.</TE>
<TE>   About eight years ago, she sought out fabric from a factory so her
designs could be produced in greater quantities. Yarmak says she
posed as a representative of a Russian-Canadian joint venture to get
her foot in the door. The factory loved her work, she told them the
truth and together they created the Helen Yarmak Fashion House label
using the company's money and her ideas. Soon other companies were
coming to her to place orders.</TE>
<TE>   Most of her individual customers are Russian and other European
businesswomen who care about their image, says Yarmak.</TE>
<TE>   Yarmak also founded a charitable foundation, Women for the Support
of the State, which runs programs aimed at making the social and
professional environment more favorable toward women.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, she opened her U.S. showroom and has catered largely to a
celebrity crowd. Her office is filled with photos of Yarmak with
Goldie Hawn, Jim Carrey and others. "My happiness was that I wasn't
from the fashion world, and I didn't know the rules from that world,
so I found my own way," explains Yarmak. The Business Women's Network
honored her as its global entrepreneur of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Her jewelry line consists of mostly large, ornate pieces with
semiprecious stones. Her creations also now include fur coats. Fur
was a natural extension of her clothing line because its roots run
deep in Russia. "At one time, sable was like currency. It was the
gold of Russia," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Yarmak describes her fur and jewelry as classic Russian designs
made using both traditional handcrafted techniques and modern
technology. "I want to remind the world that fashion is in our blood.
Socialism was a very short time of Russian history," she says.</TE>

<HD>On a Clear Day, La Brea Offers Views of a Diversified City</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you ascend La Brea Avenue through Baldwin Hills on a clear day,
you can see, for a few moments, much of what Los Angeles is. Just
north of Stocker Street, hills rise on either side of the road, green
in the winter and spring, brown the rest, and for a mile or so there
are no cross streets, no parallel boulevards, no noise but the steady
hiss of a street struck suddenly dumb.</LD>
<LD>   Through a break in the hills to the right, downtown stands tall
and solid like the keep of a castle, surrounded by a grid of rooftops
and treetops, of white and terra cotta checkered with green. Directly
ahead is the Hollywood sign, small yet unmistakable against the
rucked-up bedclothes of the Hollywood Hills, its clean white echoed
by the Griffith Observatory perched a bit down the slope from the
"D." Behind you on the left are the flat grays and mauves, the grit
and rust of the Chevron oil field and the planes that hang like
hummingbirds in final approach to LAX. Beyond them stretches the
endless seam between ocean, land and sky.</LD>
<LD>   Cresting the hill, La Brea runs on ahead, a river of glittering
gray rushing through the heart of West Los Angeles--Hancock Park to
West Hollywood to Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   It is a mildly famous street, La Brea, owing many name-recognition
points to the tar pits of the same name. La Brea is Spanish for "the
tar," and the name early settlers gave the asphalt seepage dotting
the land around what is now Hancock Park, 4,000 odd acres that in
1822  were deeded to Antonio Rocha as Rancho La Brea. The avenue of
the same name, which is several blocks east of the  pits, runs
through what is roughly the middle of that original land grant.</TE>
<TE>   At its southern end, La Brea begins oddly and abruptly at
Inglewood where Hawthorne Boulevard, named for the city that is named
for Nathaniel, enters the intersection with Century Boulevard and
comes out as La Brea Avenue. Chilly eastern Puritanism meets bubbling
hot Spanish tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Within shouting distance of Hollywood Park, La Brea makes its way
through Inglewood, built from the barley empire of Daniel Freeman and
once touted as the "Chinchilla Capital of the World" because so many
residents raised the little critters. Now it is a small,
megalopolis-adjacent city like many others--slightly dingy
storefronts, a glassy-eyed hospital, a rather impressively modern
City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Heading north, La Brea passes through the grassy silent gap of
Baldwin Hills before spilling into a basin lined with auto repair
establishments and fast-food joints. After ducking under the Santa
Monica Freeway, there is a mile or so of neat, if rundown, apartment
buildings and bungalows interspersed with motels that lure customers
with promises of color TV and air-conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   Crossing Olympic Boulevard and heading toward Wilshire Boulevard,
La Brea shakes loose its residential roots and gets hip with hot-spot
eateries such as  Campanile, Ca' Brea and, for the less
linen-inclined, Pink's, and trendy shops hawking groovy secondhand
clothing and furniture--all cheek and jowl with car lots,
film-processing labs, synagogues and yeshivas.</TE>
<TE>   On the Sabbath, dark, formal figures of the Orthodox move
purposefully down the sidewalk: men in fedoras and fur hats, girls in
dresses long at hem and sleeve. Along this corridor, Pig, a barbecue
restaurant and a Honey Baked Ham franchise seem just a bit
discordant.</TE>
<TE>   North of Beverly Boulevard the street devolves into an endless
series of strip malls, their stacks of multiethnic, multilingual
signs the signatory totem poles of L.A. Nail salons atop Uzbekistan
cuisine beside Arabic liquor stores atop Thai groceries, all tacky
and tiny and absolutely urban gorgeous. Mashti Malone's Ice Cream
Parlor is worth the trip alone.</TE>
<TE>   Rising again, now toward the Hollywood Hills, La Brea passes prop
houses and other satellite industries of nearby studios; the
fairy-tale-cottage complex at Romaine Street that once held the
Chaplin Studios is now topped with a tuxedo-clad Kermit the Frog,
home to Jim Henson Studios.</TE>
<TE>   Past Sunset and Hollywood, La Brea again goes residential, winding
its way past Franklin Avenue, now as La Brea Terrace, before coming
to an abrupt halt at a dead-end flanked by the gates of two private
hillside homes warning against parking, loitering or otherwise
hanging around.</TE>
<TE>   Below, the city smokes and windshields glitter, the avenues swoop
south, latticed by boulevards running to or from the sea, and palm
trees wag their shaggy heads like tribal elders. Below, Angelenos
conduct their business, navigating streets like children on a jungle
gym. Up and over, down and under, through the tunnel and onto the
bridge, we move through our city as we do our lives, eyes on the next
thing to be done, on the next light gone green.</TE>
<TE>   But once in a while, we crest, like a river, like a street, and we
can see the tapestry unrolled around us. Just for a minute.</TE>

<LD>Dinosaur Day</LD>
<LD>   Seventy million years ago, in the late Cretaceous period, a great
dinosaur lumbered across the western lands of North America. It could
be found in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and parts of Canada. This
dinosaur was triceratops. The name means "three-horned face." This
dinosaur had a horn on its nose and a horn above each eye. It had a
huge head, sometimes measuring 6 feet long but a medium-sized brain.
On its neck was a bony collar called a neck frill. With its three
horns, armored frill and huge size, triceratops managed to scare away
many of its enemies, including Tyrannosaurus rex. Here are some more
facts about this "terrible lizard."</LD>
<LD>   * Triceratops was about 30 feet long, 10 feet tall and weighed
between 12,000 to 24,000 pounds. It had a fat, short body, a pointed
tail, a beak like a bird and teeth on the sides of its mouth.</LD>
<TE>   * Triceratops was an herbivore, or plant eater. Its sharp teeth
were useful in tearing apart plants and roots. It traveled through
forests possibly pushing over trees with its horns to get to the top
branches.</TE>
<TE>   * Triceratops stayed in groups and may have eaten all the plants
in one area before moving on to a new section of forest to find more
food.</TE>
<TE>   * Triceratops' eggs could measure 12 inches long. The dinosaur
would lay its eggs in sand or mud where they could be covered up and
protected from predators.</TE>
<TE>   If you like dinosaurs and want to learn more, don't miss Dinosaur
Day from noon to 4 Saturday at the Richard J. Riordan Central
Library. Listen to scientists talk about the world of the dinosaur.
Dig for fossils, and touch a skull and hadrosaur leg bone. You can
also see a life-size sculpture of a triceratops and a skull from a T.
rex. This free event also includes arts and crafts, songs and stories
about dinosaurs. For more information, call (213) 228-7000 or visit

<LD>"In the Dinosaur's Paw"</LD>
<LD>   by Patricia Reilly Giff</LD>
<LD>   One day a boy named Richard needed a ruler in science to measure a
Tyrannosaurus rex. He found one on his desk with the initials "D.T."
on it. He thought it meant "Dinosaur Tyrannosaurus," so he drew a
picture of a dinosaur holding a small ruler in its paw. Then he
wished for stuff, and his wishes came true, so he thought the ruler
was magic. Richard started to brag to his friends about having a
magic ruler. Was it really? Read the book to find out.</LD>

<HD>One Faith, Two Minds</HD>
<DH>Feeling snubbed by Muslim immigrants who are defining the
faith for the U.S. public, African American Muslims are calling
attention to the way they, too, practice their beliefs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At noon on a recent Friday at the Bilal Islamic Center on South
Central Avenue, African American Muslims turned their attention to
the call to prayer. A leader in a brightly colored skullcap faced
east and began an Arabic chant--not in the high-pitched, nasal tone
of a Middle Eastern imam but with the soulful sound of a black jazz
musician.</LD>
<LD>   Worshipers' head coverings tended toward baseball caps for the men
and floral scarves for the women, not the turbans and veils typical
of the more ethnically diverse mosques whose worshipers are
immigrants from the Middle East, Asia and Africa. The setting also
blended traditions of Islam with American roots. The Bilal center's
mosque is a converted house with a dirt parking lot set in an empty
field; it has a rural feel, very different from the elaborate stone
structures common among Islamic American mosques.</LD>
<TE>   Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, such differences have
taken on new significance. Ironically, the increasing attention on
Muslims in America has left many African American Muslims feeling
marginalized. "We share the faith with immigrant Muslims, but not
much else," says Abdul Karim Hasan, Bilal's director. "For African
American Muslims, the priorities are economic justice, education and
service to humanity at the street level in our country. We don't make
decisions based on what is good for Pakistan, Afghanistan or the
Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, after the service, there was a call for volunteers to help
at a Skid Row shelter and for recruits to teach Islam to women in
prison. There was also an update on legendary boxer Muhammad Ali, who
has not yet announced whether he will accept an invitation to
represent American Muslims in a public service video to be
distributed in the Middle East as part of Hollywood's response to
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in the early '50s, the Bilal Center offers a clear example
of ways that African American Muslims blend their religious
convictions with their mission to the community around them. Hasan,
who was honored by the Los Angeles City Council last fall for his
years of service to the community, says African Americans proved
themselves long ago to be good Muslims and good Americans. They are
accepted around the world as members of the faith, he says, but since
the terrorist attacks on the U.S., Islam in America has become
synonymous with Arab Muslims, and he believes people curious about
the faith are getting the wrong impression.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who are making the most noise right now aren't speaking for
all Muslims," says Hasan, a trim man in his 60s. "When it comes to
how Islam is actually practiced here, we African American Muslims
know more about it than anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Scholars of religion and history say the American Muslim community
is in a state of flux. Bringing some 50 ethnic groups together under
one united front will take time.</TE>
<TE>   "Until now, Islam in America has been an example of what the Koran
describes as streams that flow together but don't mix," says Zahid
Bukhari, Pakistani-born research director of Muslim Americans in the
Public Square. His group is researching demographics, participation
in the political process and the role and functions of mosques for
American Muslims in a study sponsored by Pew Charitable Trusts.</TE>
<TE>   "My personal observation is that all American Muslim leaders are
aware that they need to work together," says Bukhari, a fellow at
Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Yet since Sept. 11, while a small number of African Americans have
been present at high-profile news conferences, interfaith prayer
services and meetings between President Bush and American Muslim
leaders, the focus has been Middle Eastern politics and the
protection of Muslim immigrants. Some African Americans say black
Muslims included in these high-level gatherings are being relegated
to the background when they could be explaining Islam in ways
American audiences can understand.</TE>
<TE>   "The complaint is fair," says Dr. Maher Hathout, senior advisor
for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, a Los Angeles-based Muslim
leader who was present at those public events. "However, it's
explainable. The events of Sept. 11 by their nature focused on Arabs;
those of us who were accused were naturally the ones who were
interviewed."</TE>
<TE>   He says that his group has reached out to African Americans, but
says more could be done to breach the gaps within the American Muslim
community. "Immigrants and indigenous American Muslims see America
differently," he said, adding that greater dialogue would benefit
both groups.</TE>
<TE>   African American Muslims have been active in the U.S. since at
least the 1920s. Some claim the history goes back to the slave era,
when African Muslims were brought to this country. Most of the
earliest converts learned the faith from immigrants born in Muslim
countries. In 1930, a salesman named Wallace D. Fard founded the
Nation of Islam in Detroit as a black separatist movement with a
doctrine that bears little resemblance to the Muslim faith.</TE>
<TE>   "African American Islam has two strains," says Sulayman Nyang,
professor of African Studies at Howard University in Washington, D.C.
"The early families embraced orthodox Islam; the Nation of Islam has
been known as an anti-white, anti-American, racist movement."</TE>
<TE>   American Islam made broader impressions in the '60s when social
activist Malcolm X, once a prominent member of the Nation of Islam,
embraced orthodox Islam, and Cassius Clay changed his name to
Muhammad Ali in 1964. He was also part of a breakup within the black
Muslim community that took place after 1975, when Imam Warith Deen
Mohammed succeeded his father, Elijah, as leader of the Nation of
Islam. Mohammed rejected the Nation's racist strains and founded the
Muslim American Society.</TE>
<TE>   "W.D. Mohammed turned the movement around by 180 degrees," says
Nyang. Yet most Americans are still not aware of the different groups
within the African American Muslim community.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 30% to 40% of all U.S. Muslims are African American,
and the vast majority, about 1.5 million, follow Imam W.D. Mohammed.
(The total number of American Muslims is said to be anywhere from 2
million to 7 million, depending on which of widely differing surveys
is used.) While the Nation of Islam keeps membership numbers private,
the highest estimates are about 100,000.</TE>
<TE>   If the urban poor are a priority for all African American Muslims,
it's because they are the primary constituents. These roots also help
to explain why many African American Muslims feel disenfranchised
from others in the faith.</TE>
<TE>   "Immigrant Muslims don't come to us for advice," Hasan says. "They
think we don't know as much about the religion as they do."</TE>
<TE>   Ethnic tensions are not new for American Muslims. Thirty years
ago, an influx of Asian Muslim immigrants, many of them
professionals, discovered American Islam and were not impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "For the immigrant Muslims, authority was based on knowing Arabic
and Islamic law," says Sherman Jackson, professor of Islamic Studies
at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. "Most African American
Muslims didn't know very much about either."</TE>
<TE>   What they did know, and immigrants from Muslim countries did not,
was grass-roots politics and coalition-building outside their own
religious group, Jackson says.</TE>
<TE>   The Bilal Center's Hasan and other African American leaders are
stressing those skills now. "African Americans prove that Islam is
not antithetical to democracy or to America," says Imam Faheem
Shuaibe, director of the predominantly African American Masjidul
Waritheen in Oakland, which has about 300 members.</TE>
<TE>   Shuaibe has openly challenged immigrant Muslims to show more
respect for African Americans. Last fall at a national conference of
the American Muslim Alliance in San Jose that was made up primarily
of Middle Eastern and Arab Muslims, Shuaibe made the point that W.D.
Mohammed should be referred to by his title, imam.</TE>
<TE>   He says Sept. 11 "put the conversation on the table" for all
American Muslims. His side of the conversation comes down to this:
"When you're presenting a message about Islam in America, don't
exclude me. African American Muslims have led the way at integrating
Muslims into American society."</TE>
<TE>   At the conference, Shuaibe says, he was still smarting from an
earlier situation that had upset a number of African American
Muslims. During the country's last presidential election, a coalition
of American Muslims endorsed George W. Bush for president and
encouraged all Muslims to vote in a bloc. Leaders from the Muslim
American Society felt left out of the process.</TE>
<TE>   "When those voices claimed to speak for all Muslims in America, I
resented it," says Shuaibe. "And when they claimed this was the
moment for American Muslims, it irritated me. The American Muslim
identity they claimed was already in place."</TE>
<TE>   After the election, coalition members claimed the bloc vote
resulted in nearly three-fourths of American Muslims voting
Republican, based on the group's own surveys. General exit polls,
however, showed that the vast majority of African Americans, at least
90%, voted for democratic candidate Al Gore. That rift has been
smoothed out, Shuaibe says, but he wants more open communication. "We
need to talk about the sensitivities. It's important because we're a
family."</TE>
<TE>   At a recent gathering at Georgetown University, leaders from
Islamic ethnic groups, including African Americans, talked about
having an all-inclusive Muslim American conference once every four
years, starting in 2004. "It is something like the Olympics or the
World Cup," Bukhari says of the challenges of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   He compares American Muslims' struggle toward unity to the
transition American Christians and Jews went through in the 19th
century, during the migrations from Europe. "Among American Muslims
now, only 36% were born in the U.S. The rest are from elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Nyang believes time will make a difference for American Muslims,
as it has for every new religious group in this country. "We have to
be patient. Islam in America is very young."</TE>
<TE>   On a Saturday afternoon at the Downtown Women's Center, a homeless
shelter on Los Angeles Street, Najee Ali, director of Project Islamic
HOPE, helped boil hot dogs in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Along with providing homeless services, his group lobbies for
social and legal reforms. Two years ago Ali, 37, helped push the
Sherrice Iverson Good Samaritan bill into law. It says that a witness
to a sexual assault against a minor must notify police.</TE>
<TE>   At least 30 homeless women attended the Saturday lunch, served on
tables covered with crisp blue plastic cloths. Ali introduced himself
to the group in personal terms.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to live here on Skid Row," he said. "I lost my mother at
an early age, but God has blessed me, and I made a commitment to give
back and help others." His fiancee, Ngina Muhammad, 36, daughter of
Imam W.D. Mohammed, worked with him that day.</TE>
<TE>   Ali has been outspoken about tensions between Arab and African
American Muslims, but on this day he seemed more optimistic. "We're
in the growing-pains stage," he said. "Unity has to happen. It's the
only way for American Islam to survive."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Lescroart's new legal thriller, "The Oath" (Dutton, 480 pages,
$25.95), begins with the head of Parnassus, San Francisco's largest
and least humane HMO, getting hit by a speeding car and winding up a
patient in his own inhospitable hospital. The incident seems like an
example of karmic justice, until the gent is turned into an ex-HMO
CEO, thanks to a fatal double dose of potassium.</LD>
<LD>   Was it a mistake? Nobody buys that, least of all gruff homicide
cop Abe Glitsky. He's convinced he's found the culprit in the dead
man's hapless attending physician, Eric Kensing. The doctor not only
despised the former chief executive's business practices, he also
hated the man for stealing his wife.</LD>
<LD>   Enter the series protagonist, defense attorney Dismas Hardy, to
whom the suspect turns. To the dismay of his best friend Glitsky, the
lawyer immediately begins wheeling and dealing for his client. But
even with an unusually open-minded district attorney, Hardy's lot is
not an easy one. Especially with a client who isn't willing to take
his advice.</LD>
<TE>   Lescroart, a former law clerk, seems to have kept current on the
ins and outs of the profession, and he's  developed an impressive
knowledge of the tricks some HMOs play to keep profits high. But the
reading enjoyment his novels provide continues to come mainly from
the chemistry between his winning odd couple--the freewheeling Hardy
and the irascible, by-the-book Glitsky.</TE>
<TE>   Les Farrell, the hero of another of the author's legal series, has
a minor role here, too. These characters and a particularly strong
plot combine to make "The Oath" one of the better entries in the
best-selling series.</TE>
<TE>   Mary-Ann Tirone Smith's "Love Her Madly" (Holt, 507 pages, $25) is
an odd tale of Lone Star justice and FBI hubris with a title that's
more than a bit perplexing. Who precisely does the author mean to be
the recipient of our mad love? Could it be Poppy Rice, the FBI
investigator described by the book's press sheet as "a fox with
attitude," who, on little more than a whim, travels way out of her
Quantico jurisdiction to try to stop "the first execution of a woman
in Texas since the Civil War?"</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it's the confessed murderess, Rona Leigh Glueck, whose
death-row religious conversion has been so well-publicized that
fundamentalist activists are wondering if she might be the new
redeemer.</TE>
<TE>   In either case, love might be asking a bit too much of the reading
public. Neither character is all that lovable. Rona Leigh is either a
formerly homicidal druggie-turned-Christian-bliss ninny or a
still-homicidal, druggie-turned-sly sociopath. Poppy, the book's
narrator, is an arrogant I'm-right-and-you're-an-idiot kind of fun
gal whose vaunted irreverence and hardball feminism lead to such
charming asides as her speculation that, since Jesus stopped "a gang
of fellows from stoning an adulteress to death," the adulteress must
have been "pretty."</TE>
<TE>   Why is Poppy  so bitter, so angry at organized religion, at Dan
Rather, Texans in general and anyone who doesn't agree with her?
Maybe it's because she's stuck with a name that sounds like a 1940s
cereal. Maybe it's her zipless love life, though she seems quite
proud of her proficiency at one-night stands.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Poppy is so full of herself and her ability to do
what she wants when she wants to do it that, by novel's end, she
hasn't the time or the sensitivity to express one word of regret that
her reckless behavior has caused at least one murder and made
possible untold future homicides. Love her madly? Mmmmm, maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   "The Masks of Auntie Laveau," by Robert J. Randisi and Christine
Matthews (St. Martins/Thomas Dunne, $23.95, 247 pages) is the second
adventure of St. Louis-based amateur sleuths Claire and Gil Hunt
(she's a shopping network show hostess; he owns a bookstore). This
installment finds the St. Louis-based couple in New Orleans on the
trail of a Mardi Gras mask maker named Auntie Laveau, who may or may
not be a descendant of notorious voodoo queen Marie Laveau.</TE>
<TE>   When Auntie joins her ancestor in death, the Hunts are drawn into
a bizarre murder case that places Gil at the mercy of a
machete-wielding madman. Randisi and Matthews, who also pursue
separate writing careers (she's an author-poet-playwright; he's the
prolific author of more than 100 crime and western novels and the
founder of the Private Eye Writers of America), know how to whip up a
tasty plot, especially when presented with a rich array of
ingredients including voodoo, jazz, beignets, murder, white slavery
and the Faulkner House bookstore.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many of the authors who write about New Orleans from an
insider's perspective, taking too much of the city for granted,
Randisi-Matthews present the gaudy old bawd as observed by curious
tourists, eager not only to sample the town's many obvious
attractions but to risk its darker, more decadent alleyways.</TE>
<TE>   The Hunts are good company who, unlike some other crime couples,
are able to converse without cringing cuteness. The book's pacing is
another sign of professionalism, especially  in the final chapters
that shift between Gil in jeopardy (a welcome genre reversal) to the
frustrated efforts of a rescue party consisting of Claire, her son
and a local cop. In all, "Masks" could be a textbook on how to create
a lively, accessible, smartly paced, entertaining suspense novel.</TE>

<HD>Similar Blunders, Different Retraction Attitudes</HD>
<DH>After inaccurate columns on World Trade Center tragedies,
one writer offers an angry explanation, another a contrite one.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN SANDLER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of all the heart-rending stories to come out of New York on Sept. 11,
two were certainly among the most devastating.</LD>
<LD>   Waldo Fernandez in Miami lost the adult son he had never met and
that son's mother--his former paramour--in "one of those fateful
stories that have become daily lore, human stories of love and
transformation rising from the enormity of ground zero," Pulitzer
Prize-winning columnist Liz Balmaseda wrote in the Miami Herald. Four
days later, psychiatric nurse Eileen Stanley literally worked herself
to death at ground zero. After her day job caring for drug addicts,
she worked nights in the rescue effort and then died of exhaustion.
"If ever there were a metaphor for these difficult times, Eileen
Stanley is it," columnist Kathleen Parker wrote in the Orlando
Sentinel.</LD>
<LD>   The tragic heft of these two stories was felt across Florida when
the columns were published. But there was a problem with these tales:
Neither is true. Though Fernandez exists, and Stanley did die in New
York on Sept. 15, Fernandez never had a son who was killed in the
towers, and Stanley never volunteered at ground zero.</LD>
<TE>   When the institution of fact allows fiction in through the cracks,
it raises some questions--especially when it happens twice in the
same emotional quagmire--in this case the need to find meaning and
metaphor in the ashes of the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, these are relatively minor transgressions compared to the
whoppers told by other columnists in recent years. In the highly
publicized cases of ex-Boston Globe columnists Mike Barnicle and
Patricia Smith, the transgressions were straightforward: The writers
made up people and passed them off as real. Seeking to restore its
credibility with readers, the Globe fired them. Sometimes,
journalists who make up sources attest they are in search of a higher
truth, one that transcends fact.</TE>
<TE>   But neither Florida columnist invoked that excuse. Instead, each
devoted a column to retracting what she had written, explaining how
she had been duped.</TE>
<TE>   Balmaseda, who wrote the false story of losing the unknown son and
one-time love, was furious in her follow-up column as she retraced in
extraordinary detail how she attempted to verify Fernandez's tale,
only to establish that instead of a heartbroken father she discovered
he was a "cruel pathetic liar," one with a criminal record and a
dodgy reputation in the Cuban community. "He has delivered false
names, a false phone number, and too many versions of his story to
quiet the anger I am feeling," she wrote in her retraction.</TE>
<TE>   Balmaseda was indignant when she found out that her source was a
shady character with a criminal past. "What Balmaseda failed to
include," Jacob Bernstein wrote in a critical piece in the Miami New
Times alternative weekly, "was any indication that she herself had
been careless by publishing this dubious account." Bernstein
chastised Balmaseda for showing "no signs of contrition or apology to
Herald readers." (Balmaseda did not return a phone call for this
story.)</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Balmaseda, the Sentinel's Parker was deeply apologetic in
her retraction. She explained that she'd heard the Stanley story
while she was Christmas shopping from a man who turned out to be a
relative of Stanley's. As a result of miscommunication and adoration
for their loved one, the woman's family had created an instant, and
incorrect, myth about how she died. "I was snookered by a good story.
I accept all the blame for this misunderstanding," Parker wrote,
recounting the details of the misunderstanding and how they resulted
in "the worst day of my career."</TE>
<TE>   What Parker has discovered is that her retraction seems to have
elevated rather than tainted her reputation among her readership.
Since her explanatory column ran earlier this month, she's received
more than a thousand e-mails from readers, many of whom said her
apologetic retraction has given them greater faith in her writing. "I
applaud you for your honesty and owning up to a mistake made. This
action more than many others will keep me reading your columns
whenever I see them," wrote one reader. "You have shown yourself to
be a person of character who can be trusted." Wrote another: "If only
other reporters were equally as honest we might have a little more
truth told."</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly, my credibility has never been higher," said a slightly
amused Parker on the phone from her home in South Carolina. She says
her usual journalistic scrutiny was relaxed by what she calls the
national impulse toward trust and goodwill since the attacks. "I
wanted to tell an uplifting story, and I absolutely wanted to believe
it. It didn't occur to me not to believe it. And it didn't occur to
me that someone would lie about something so important, such an
emotional issue for all of us," she says.</TE>
<TE>   That powerful mood and the need to use individual tales to make
meaning of incomprehensible tragedy make Parker's lapse
understandable, says Columbia University journalism professor James
Carey. "These stories are so good that you come upon them and want
them to be true--so much that they should be true!" This, he says, is
because journalists are trying to organize their grief in the face of
tragedy, as represented by Parker's quest for a "metaphor for these
difficult times," and Balmaseda's desire for "human stories of love
and transformation," as they wrote in their initial columns.</TE>
<TE>   "They feel a need to find representative anecdotes to show us how
to feel our way through these events, and these are exactly the times
when journalists should be skeptical and they're often not." Carey's
suggestion to journalists is certainly an offbeat one: "They all
should be in psychotherapy," he said, chortling. "A little more
self-awareness can go a long way in figuring out when your emotions
are leading you away from the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Elaine Englehardt, co-author of "Media and Ethics: Principles for
Moral Decisions," isn't quite as forgiving. She is unpersuaded by
Balmaseda's explanation that, as she wrote in her second column, "On
a human level, I had no reason to doubt Fernandez's pain." Englehardt
says the columnist's feelings got in the way of necessary restraint.
"When journalists take advantage of the luxury to be emotional, then
they're not looking out for the overall interest of the constituents
they represent," she says. "They have to stay in a place where
they're finding out as much information as possible rather than
lifting spirits and feeling sad or patriotic--even columnists must do
that."</TE>
<TE>   But Roy Peter Clark, who teaches journalism ethics at the Poynter
Institute, says columnists often have to emphasize different aspects
of what they do under deadline every day. That means sometimes
rejecting meaningful stories because they're difficult to verify, or
else opening the door to them because they answer an emotional need.
This constantly shifting balance, he says, is important because
columnists play a special role with readers--they deliver meaning
beyond the facts.</TE>
<TE>   "There are times when we need to be powerfully neutral in our
judgments, and there are other times when we need to be tuned in to
the collective suffering of a people," he says. "I don't see any
justification for diverting emotion. Emotion is part of the human
experience journalists should chronicle."</TE>
<TE>   And Clark believes--as Parker's readers attest--that good can come
of mistakes such as these. "There's always some collateral damage,
but some collateral benefits can be if those mistakes are recognized
and their correction offers some public education," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The main lesson is one of journalism's cornerstones, a tenet
Parker repeated for readers in her apology: "In journalism, the rule
is this: If your mother says she loves you, check it out.'"</TE>

<HD>A Toast to Scotland's Enduring Rapscallion</HD>
<DH>Poet Robert Burns' birthday provides an opportunity to laud
haggis, anesthetic and all other things Scottish.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN MORGAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Robert Burns was sort of the Kurt Cobain of 18th century Scotland,"
said historian Arthur Herman. The author of the recent "How the Scots
Invented the Modern World: The True Story of How Western Europe's
Poorest Nation Created Our World &amp; Everything In It" spoke for a few
minutes from his home in Washington, D.C., about Scotland's national
poet on the eve of Burns Night, the annual celebration commemorating
Burns' birth in 1759.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles, as it was throughout the world, Burns' birthday
was celebrated over the weekend with the piping of the haggis, a
parade of bagpipe players leading in bearers of the Scottish sausage.
At the downtown Omni Hotel, Nicholson Pipes and Drums, a local
bagpipe band, was fitted out top to toe in full Highland regalia,
providing a rousing welcome to the 180 guests at the United Scottish
Society's 30th annual Burns Night.</LD>
<TE>   The eternal spirit of "Robbie" Burns continues to exhilarate the
atmosphere of Burns nights everywhere. "Burns was a radical, a
religious skeptic and a supporter of the French Revolution," Herman
said of the writer best known in America for providing the lyrics of
"Auld Lang Syne" to a traditional Scottish tune. The poet's
"irregular lifestyle," Herman said, most likely contributed to Burns'
early death at 37; he was a heavy drinker, an itinerant writer and
womanizer (known for his "amatory fecklessness"), who enjoyed both
great talent and cult status.</TE>
<TE>   At the Omni, raucous conversation soared over the strains of a
musical medley that segued spiritedly from "Scotland the Brave" to
"Swannee."</TE>
<TE>   "I always told my children that the Scottish invented the modern
world," said Tom Reoch, responding to a question about the premise of
Herman's book. "The roads we drive on are MacAdam; the tires of our
cars were created by Dunlop. And when you have an accident, your life
is going to be saved by Joseph Lister, who invented antiseptic [in
Scotland], and James Simpson, who invented anesthetics."</TE>
<TE>   For Scots-born Janet Ewing, who immigrated to Santa Monica in the
1970s and worked in the Bobby Burns chain of restaurants, being
Scottish has always meant being knowledgeable. "When I was a wee
girl," she remembered, "my father used to say, 'Oh, you've been here
before!' He meant that we were born just knowing everything."</TE>
<TE>   The band rounded its way through Scottish favorites and American
military anthems. Jennifer Bedard, the group's tenor drummer,
flourished her drumsticks into extraordinary airborne pirouettes,
keeping time with diligent grace. "I'm half French and half Polish,"
she said later when asked her name. "No one in the band is Scottish,"
said Robert Hackney, the group's pipe major. "I'm from South
Scotland--England."</TE>
<TE>   Central to any traditional Burns supper is the ceremonial parade
of kilted gentlemen and single piper, presenting Scotland's national
dish. A Celtic cousin of the Cajun boudin, the haggis is a mighty
sausage made of sheep innards, onions and great dashes of pepper. At
the Omni, the haggis was prepared by the resident chef, Scottish-born
Peter Dean. On Burns night, the poet's ode to the haggis, "chieftain
of the pudding race," is recited and followed with a round of whisky
toasts.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best haggis we've had at any of the dinners,"
declared Ben Ramage, who emigrated in 1968 from Leith, the port city
of Edinburgh. "In California, they're always trying to dress up the
haggis with palm trees and tropical fruit," he complained, admiring
the resolute plainness of the dish.</TE>
<TE>   Ramage, who is about to retire from the aerospace industry, seems
an ideal person to comment on author Herman's portrait of Scottish
inventiveness. "I knew that we invented the modern world. I've been
trying to tell people that for years."</TE>
<TE>   He's even clipped a review of the book from the London Times. "It
appeared on a 'must read' list, so I passed it on to my daughter to
post on the bulletin board of her school, St. Margaret's in San Juan
Capistrano. Their team is the Tartans."</TE>
<TE>   On an evening afloat with high-spirited entertainment ranging from
performances of sword dancing to roast-style toast-making, an
interlude of Burns airs sung by bass-baritone Harry Kawai brought an
Edwardian drawing room atmosphere to the hotel banquet hall.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I went to Edinburgh, I looked up at the castle and
felt, 'I have been here before,'" recalled Kawai, a native of Hawaii.
Drawn to all things Scottish, Kawai returned to California, joined
the United Scottish Society and began to transpose Burns'
melodies--usually performed by a tenor--into his own range.
"Otherwise, I'd have to stand on a chair to reach those notes," he
joked, relishing his Caledonian repertoire and an expanded wardrobe
that now includes 10 kilts. "I have [Scottish kilt maker] Hector
Russell on my speed dial."</TE>
<TE>   Scotland and the United States seem to be inextricably, albeit
quietly, linked. During the five years Herman was researching his
book, he traveled often to Scotland. "One morning at an Edinburgh
bed-and-breakfast, the host said, 'You're American, aren't you?' I
said, 'Yes.' And he said, 'Did you know that there would never have
been an American Revolution without the Scottish?'" Herman, of all
people, did know this.</TE>
<TE>   In his book, he points out that it was the Scots-Irish philosopher
Francis Hutcheson who first pronounced the phrase "the greatest
happiness for the greatest number," the idea Thomas Jefferson
developed in the Declaration of Independence as an inalienable
right--"the pursuit of happiness."</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's an almost perverse national pride [among the
Scots] in keeping things under wraps," observed Herman, the American
academic born in Wisconsin, who has no claim to Scottish heritage.
"It's the 'gotcha card': The Scots like to surprise you. And they
always do."</TE>

<HD>Bridgett's Adventure on the Digital Highway</HD>
<DH>Part 3 The story so far: Bridgett is inside her computer
with a friend named Bookmark.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bookmark pulled Bridgett away and said, "If Hard Drive senses a
program or foreign object it has not saved, click--it will suck you
up and spread you like peanut butter all over the cylinder. Be
careful!"</LD>
<LD>   "Peanut butter?" Bridgett gulped. "Thanks for saving me," she
exclaimed. "I'll work fast. Will I be able to finish my report before
something happens?"</LD>
<LD>   "Must go fast. Click," Bookmark said. He knew Bridgett was in real
danger.</LD>
<TE>   Bridgett noticed the disk smoking. She pressed "save" on the
keyboard and quickly started taking written notes so she could finish
her report. Suddenly hundreds of zeros and ones came whirling
overhead. Bookmark hovered over Bridgett's head. The wings on his
feet moved as fast as a hummingbird's wings as he flew up and down.
He could see the Digital Highway blinking and flashing. Some of the
highway had gone dark. Bridgett smelled burnt rubber.</TE>
<TE>   "What is that horrible smell?" Bridgett asked as she turned to see
that Bookmark was going crazy whirling--spinning like a top.</TE>
<TE>   "Error! Something has gone wrong in the far quadrant of the
machine! Click! Trouble! Must get out! Go quickly!" Bookmark yelled.</TE>
<TE>   Bridgett dropped her pencil into the darkness.</TE>
<TE>   "No time. You must get out!" Bookmark cried.</TE>
<TE>   Something lurked in the distance. The smell was stronger now.
Bridgett's head throbbed. The shadow moved rapidly over the
motherboard, weaving in and out of the chips, memory and circuitry,
destroying everything in its path.</TE>
<TE>   "What is that? What is making everything go dark?" Bridgett asked.</TE>
<TE>   "A virus has come to find you. We get one every day. You are a
foreign body in the digital world, and it loves to attack anything
different. Click. Everything needs to be put in folders or it will
get destroyed or corrupted. You will need to leave soon!" Bookmark
insisted.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't leave until I get my information," Bridgett shouted. "I
need to stay here and finish my research."</TE>
<TE>   Bridgett caught her breath. She could smell the stench of burning
plastic. She held her nose with her index finger and thumb!</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: Will Bridgett make it out in time?</TE>

<HD>Tough One to Tackle: Picking Super Bowl Beer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From The Times Food Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's no longer any question that Super Bowl Sunday has become one
of America's most important secular holidays. The only thing that
remains to be seen is what will turn out to be the traditional menu
for a day spent eating and drinking in front of the television. There
is a strong traditional lobby for delivery pizza. But a rapidly
coalescing opposition is building around chips.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever food dominates the serving platters and TV trays of
America, one thing is certain: Beer will be poured. Let's face it,
it's tough to picture armchair fans screaming at refs over a bottle
of wine--even a Beaujolais.</LD>
<LD>   That beer is the beverage for the big bowl is obvious. But which
beer? We called some of Southern California's leading merchants for
recommendations.</LD>
<TE>   Kenny Hollingshead, Hollingshead's Delicatessen: Spaten Pilsner,
$9.99 (half-liter six-pack)</TE>
<TE>   "The Spaten brewery in Munich is one of the biggest in Germany.
This is a lager-style beer so it's light in taste and light in color,
but because it's a Pilsener, it has a little bit of a bite on the
finish. Not enough to make it bitter, just enough to make it
refreshing. We've sold this brand for about 25 years and this has
been the single best-selling line of beer we've ever had. The quality
is always top-drawer; we've never gotten a bad  beer from them."</TE>
<TE>   368 S. Main St., Orange; (714) 978-9467.</TE>
<TE>   Duane Riddell, Beverages &amp; More: Samuel Smith's Old Brewery Pale
Ale, $3.49 (18.8-ounce bottle)</TE>
<TE>   "It has a lot of flavor and character, it's very malty. It's a
wonderful beer. It's English. I like to take it on vacation with me.
When I drive up to San Francisco, I like to have it when I get to my
hotel room. It's my reward. Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale is my second
choice. It has a very nutty flavor to it--it's a little sweeter--and
the nut is like hazelnut, not peanut. It has a very sweet finish to
the beer." (Nut Brown Ale, $8.99 for a four-pack.)</TE>
<TE>   875 E. Birch St., Brea, (714) 990-2060; also locations in Irvine,
Orange, Encinitas and the San Diego area.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Johnson, Brewer's Rendezvous: Bavik Pils, $4.99 (six-pack)</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great beer and new to America; we just started getting
shipments right after Christmas, and it's one of our bestsellers.
It's a Pilsener-style beer made in Belgium, but it's very un-Belgian.
It's absolutely crisp, clean and very refreshing. It's light-bodied.
I hate to make the comparison, but it's along the same line as
Budweiser, but with more substance."</TE>
<TE>   11116 Downey Ave., Downey; (562) 923-6292.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Cristillo, Bristol Farms: Stone Indian Pale Ale, $3.49
(22-ounce bottle)</TE>
<TE>   "I like Stone Brewing Co. out of San Diego. They've put together
ales and lagers. Some are done in a Belgian style, some in an Indian
Pale Ale. I think they're some of the best beers made in the United
States. They're very unique, have great flavors and just terrific
consistency. They're not that well-known and a bit unique."</TE>
<TE>   Various locations.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Hooper, Hi-Time Wine Cellars: Kona Brewing Co. Lager and Pale
Ale, $6.99 (six-pack)</TE>
<TE>   "These beers from a Hawaiian brewery are really easy drinking.
They've got a lot of good flavor, but they're not too heavy--just
what you want for sitting around and watching the Super Bowl. The
lager has a little fruitiness, but not heavy sweet fruit. It's not
too bitter; it's not heavily hopped. The ale is also lightly hopped,
unlike most California pales. Both of these beers are really smooth
and go down really easy."</TE>
<TE>   250 Ogle St., Costa Mesa; (800) 331-3005.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Breitstein, Duke of Bourbon: Hopf Helle Weisse Bier, $2.25
(17-ounce bottle)</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the tastier beers I've had, though it's not
necessarily the cheapest. It's a great, classic wheat beer. It's got
a really bright, vibrant fruit character. It's very refreshing."</TE>
<TE>   20908 Roscoe Blvd., Canoga Park; (818) 341-1234.</TE>
<TE>   John Hanssen, Morry's of Naples: Blanche de Chambly, $9.95
(750-milliliter bottle)</TE>
<TE>   "It's a Belgian beer. It's a real light style, very creamy. It's a
really easy-drinking, smooth beer. It's one of my favorites--I'm
turning all my friends on to it right now. It also comes in a 5-liter
keg, which is kind of fun for a party." (Keg, $19.95)</TE>
<TE>   5764 E. 2nd St., Long Beach; (562) 433-0405.</TE>
<TE>   Regan Ditta, Red Carpet Wine: Victory Brewing Co. Hop Devil Ale,
$10.99 (six-pack)</TE>
<TE>   "Victory Brewing is a company out of Pennsylvania. Hop Devil is an
India Pale Ale--it's a big old, high-alcohol beer with lots of
flavor, seven different kinds of hops. They also recently put out a
barley wine-style beer called Old Horizontal."</TE>
<TE>   400 E. Glendale Blvd., Glendale; (818) 247-5544.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Samaniego, The Stuffed Sandwich: Hog Heaven Barley Wine, $4.95
(22-ounce bottle)</TE>
<TE>   "They make this one a little different from most barley wines, but
they make it tasty. It's got a lot of flavor, lots of hops and herbs.
And because barley wines are so high in alcohol, it's also very
sneaky. For a barley wine that's not a pure barley wine, it's a
superior product."</TE>
<TE>   413 W. Las Tunas Drive, San Gabriel; (626) 576-9554.</TE>
<TE>   David Henry, Trader Joe's: Rio Claro, $2.99 (six-pack).</TE>
<TE>   "This is a beer from El Salvador that's made in a very light
Pilsener style. It's close to Pacifico and other beers in that vein.
If had a bucket of salsa and chips, that would be a great beer for
the game."</TE>
<TE>   Various locations.</TE>
<TE>   Chip Hammack, The Wine House: Czechvar, $7.99 (six-pack)</TE>
<TE>   "I go with Czechvar. It's from the Czech Republic. It's a
Pilsener-style lager, it has a lot of hoppy fruit to it with a nice,
clean, fresh finish. It's not a thick, heavy beer like an ale. It's
definitely in the league with a really good Pilsner Urquell. This
would be good with pretzels, popcorn, all kinds of snacks because
it's real clean and fresh but has some body."</TE>
<TE>   2311 Cotner Ave., West Los Angeles; (800) 626-9463.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Friedman, Woodland Hills Wine Co.: Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Ale,
$10 (six-pack)</TE>
<TE>   "This beer is so huge it's almost a barley wine. It's got the
highest alcohol content in the store (9.6%). You can almost age it,
that's how huge it is. The flavor is very berry-like, very complex.
It's a wonderful beer, but not something you'd drink to quench your
thirst."</TE>
<TE>   22622 Ventura Blvd., Woodland Hills; (818) 222-1111.</TE>

<HD>Yakking About Nepal's High-Country Cheese</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a frequent traveler to the high reaches of Nepal, having eaten
more yak cheese than I care to recall and having developed a great
respect for the distance necessary between the hairy beasts and
trekkers, I loved Jonathan White's article about his version of the
product ("Developing a Knack for Yak," Jan. 23). I'll bet the Flower
of Rajya is quite different than the strong-smelling version sold in
the mountains and in Katmandu. I know this cheese too well because a
huge container of the stuff got slipped into one of my duffle bags to
go on a plane with me. That bag had to be replaced, but the cheese I
was served was delicious.</LD>

<LD>Today's Food section (Jan. 23) was the best we have had in years.
There were recipes the average homemaker could relate too. Nothing
like short ribs and a good old-fashioned pot roast. The past several
years it has been foreign recipes that required going to Koreatown or
Chinatown to get items. I had just about given up on recipes that the
average American cook could make. My bunco and pinochle group have
all remarked on this.</LD>

<LD>I enjoy reading your section every week, but I've never felt
compelled to respond to you before reading "Spilling the Beans on
Removing Wine Stains" (Jan. 23). As the former wife of a winemaker, I
became expert at getting red wine stains out of clothing and
tablecloths.</LD>
<LD>   My grandmother taught me one that is almost infallible, and since
it was used before the day of fancy new chemicals, it is available
anywhere. Her advice was to always use boiling water on fruit-based
stains and cold water on protein-based stains (meat juice, gravy,
blood). Obviously the boiling water can only be used on a fabric that
can withstand the heat.</LD>
<LD>   The other system that works very well is to throw the wine-stained
T-shirts (there are always a lot of those at "crush" time) in the
washing machine with a lot of chlorine bleach and wash them using the
hot water setting. In this case you can use detergent as well. I even
used this method on a pink cotton dress that had had a glass of red
wine dumped all over it. It brightened the pink color slightly but
left not a sign of the wine stain.</LD>
<TE>   SARAH CHAMBERLIN</TE>
<TE>   Via e-mail</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have found the best way to remove wine (or fruit juice) stains
is to spread the stained fabric over the sink and pour boiling water
over the stain from a height of about 2 feet. This should immediately
remove all traces of the wine. Rinse the stain in cold water and then
launder as usual.</TE>

<LD>I laughed and nodded in recognition over Emily Green's hilarious and
true essay about digging out simplicity from beneath clutter and dog
hairs ("Making the Perfect Kitchen," Jan. 16). I too long for a clean
and clear kitchen, but I have two dogs (one a black Lab nicknamed
Rolling Blackout for his shedding capabilities) plus a large
cockatoo, all firmly entrenched in the heart of the house (a.k.a. the
kitchen).</LD>

<HD>One for the Fans: Chicken Chili</HD>

<BD>TEST KITCHEN DIRECTOR</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A hungry Super Bowl crowd usually likes chili. But given all the
other stuff you'll eat that day, why not make a lighter version of
the old standby? This one pairs lean chicken breast (instead of beef)
with white beans for a white chili. Spooned over baked potatoes, it
makes for a filling entree--just what football fans need.</LD>
<LD>   To thicken the chili, use cornstarch and instant masa flour (sold
under brand names such as Masa Harina). The instant masa adds a
distinct corn flavor.</LD>
<LD>   Let the fans shoulder their way to the table for an array of
garnishes, a crispy salad and crunchy veggie sticks. No tackling in
the house, though.</LD>
<TE>   You can double or triple this recipe.</TE>

<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 50 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons oil</TE>
<TE>   2 cups diced onions</TE>

<TE>   2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/4 pounds) cut into
1 1/2-inch cubes</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon dried oregano</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</TE>
<TE>   3 (14 1/2-ounce) cans low-sodium chicken broth</TE>
<TE>   2 (15-ounce) cans white kidney beans, drained</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons cornstarch</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons water, divided</TE>

<HD>How Martha Got Down at Guelaguetza</HD>
<DH>The queen of style shoots a segment at a Westside Oaxacan
restaurant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMELIA SALTSMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Flaming tortillas and 3-foot-tall immersion blenders are nothing new
to Soledad Lopez. At Guelaguetza, her Westside Oaxacan restaurant,
she deals with those every day. But a visit from Martha Stewart and
her film crew--that was something else.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday the empress of entertaining and her minions sailed into
the unassuming Palms eatery to master tamal Oaxaqueno con mole negro
and other specialties for her television show.</LD>
<LD>   Who knew Guelaguetza, located in a strip mall next to a
laundromat, would be Martha Stewart's kind of place?</LD>
<TE>   It turns out she loves "to discover a cook committed to her
cuisine, who makes everything from scratch," she said, especially one
"who has a love of her own pottery." Lopez may not have heard of
Stewart until 10 days ago, but with her collection of green-glazed
Oaxacan ware and satiny black San Bartolo Coyotepec pottery, she
definitely speaks Stewart's language.</TE>
<TE>   Working together, the women prepared Zapotec-style mole negro with
three kinds of dried chiles: small, maroon cascabels; long, red-brown
guajillos; and wrinkled, blackish, heart-shaped anchos. The
restaurant was perfumed with the scent of toasting chiles as Stewart
and Lopez browned and toasted ingredients one by one to add to the
cazuela: plantains, raw peanuts, almonds, pecans, onions, garlic,
sesame seeds, whole cloves, cumin seeds, canela (cinnamon), thyme,
Mexican oregano, raisins and French bread, and stirred in tomatoes,
tomatillos and chicken stock.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the blackened Oaxacan tortilla--clayuda--to add
depth and color. Trying this at home? Place a thin, leathery clayuda
over a burner turned on high. Soon, the whole thing will be aflame
and break into pieces that you'll need to pick up with tongs and
remove to a counter, being careful not to set afire any dish towels,
as Stewart did. When the inferno subsided, Stewart gamely stepped
forward and announced to the camera, "It's important not to char
anything but the tortilla."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez pulverized the mole mixture with her Brobdignagian blender,
splattering sauce around, which Stewart neatly wiped up between
takes. After the grainy, sugared Oaxacan chocolate was melted in, the
sauce was left to cook for another couple of hours. Then, a TV news
crew arrived to film the filming.</TE>
<TE>   To make the tamal, Lopez spread a thin layer of soft masa on a
large banana leaf, mounded shredded chicken breast drizzled with mole
in the center and neatly folded it all together.</TE>
<TE>   After steaming the tamal, Lopez cut into it, exposing the fragrant
chicken, then poured more mole over it and sprinkled the dish with
sesame seeds. Stewart swooned, on-camera and off, admiring "the
careful addition of many ingredients to make what seems a simple
sauce."</TE>
<TE>   It took three hours to get this on tape, but there wasn't a dull
moment. In their spare time, Lopez and Stewart ran through several
other Guelaguetza favorites, keeping the crew on its toes: chips with
red mole and fresh cheese; memelas--thick, fresh Oaxacan tortillas
(Martha loved the mesquite wood press, "the right tool for the right
job") topped with epazote-seasoned black beans, cheese and tomatillo
salsa; lime-and-garlic-marinated fried tilapia; and Oaxacan pizza--a
clayuda topped with beans, cheese, tasajo (aged salted beef); and
Lopez's "adorable" golf-ball-size chorizos.</TE>
<TE>   As she departed for her next shoot (at Ginza Sushiko in Beverly
Hills), a charming basket packed with several moles-to-go over her
arm, Stewart said she might incorporate tamales Oaxaquenos into her
own entertaining. "I can see making this for guests for a summer
lunch," she said. No doubt using turn-of-the-20th-century Oaxacan
pottery found at a Connecticut tag sale.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see making the tamales smaller," she added. "That would be
beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   The Guelaguetza segment is scheduled to air on "Martha Stewart
Living" during the week of Feb. 18. Weekdays 9 a.m., KCBS.</TE>

<LD>It's easy to make a thick, creamy soup by adding lots of cream or
starting with a roux. But it's just as easy to give a soup more body
by pureeing part of it and returning it to the saucepan.</LD>
<LD>   In this soup, everything but the crab simmers for a short time,
then half the soup heads for the blender. Once back in the pan, the
soup and added crab are reheated for a few minutes.</LD>
<LD>   With this technique, you'll satisfy anyone who can't have dairy
products. And, you'll have a thicker, richer soup without the added
fat or calories of cream.</LD>
<TE>   Round out the soup with a watercress salad.</TE>

<LD>"The '99 Bonaccorsi Pinot Noir from Santa Barbara County. Mike
Bonaccorsi has made a great start with this Pinot. Making good Pinot
is difficult. Making a good one on your first attempt is like reading
about aeronautical engineering and then building your own airplane.
They rarely fly. The wine has good structure and fruit, is a little
tight at first, but then opens up aromatically and on the palate."</LD>

<LD>Don't call yesterday's roast leftovers--not when you add onions,
mushrooms and sour cream to make beef stroganoff.</LD>
<LD>   Here, strips of roast are gently heated, which keeps the meat as
tender as the day it was roasted. Freshly grated nutmeg adds a nice
flavor, though in a pinch, ground nutmeg from the spice rack is OK.</LD>
<LD>   Serve the stroganoff over buttered egg noodles tossed with minced
Italian parsley, and serve steamed green beans and crusty rolls
alongside. Leftovers have never tasted better.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Beef Stroganoff</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Replace 1/4 cup of the hot beef broth with white wine for a more
elegant dish.</TE>
<TE>   1 pound leftover beef roast, tenderloin or steak</TE>
<TE>   1 cup beef broth</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter</TE>
<TE>   1 small onion, diced</TE>
<TE>   2 cups sliced mushrooms</TE>
<TE>   Freshly grated nutmeg</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons flour, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 pint sour cream</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   White pepper</TE>
<TE>   Buttered egg noodles, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Cut the meat in slices about 1/3 inch thick, then the slices into
strips 2 1/4 inches long. You should have about 4 cups. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the broth in a small saucepan until hot.</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion
and cook until softened but not brown, stirring frequently, about 3
minutes. Increase the heat to medium-high and add the mushrooms. Cook
until the mushrooms become tender and start to release their juices,
stirring frequently, 5 minutes. Add 6 to 8 grinds of nutmeg and stir.
Sprinkle in 1 tablespoon of the flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring
occasionally. Do not brown. Add the hot broth and stir until smooth.</TE>
<TE>   Add the beef to the pan, stir well, and warm just to a simmer,
about 3 minutes. Stir the remaining 1 tablespoon of flour into the
sour cream, add to the pan and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Warm gently over low heat until hot, about 7 minutes. The sauce will
thin a little; do not boil or the sour cream will break up. Add more
nutmeg, if desired. Spoon over the noodles.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: There was a popular Hollywood restaurant named Scandia that
served a wonderful dish called Veal Oscar. Is it possible to get its
recipe or one close to it?</LD>
<LD>   BARBARA SCHULTZ</LD>
<LD>   Santa Clarita</LD>
<TE>   DEAR BARBARA: Is this close? While not from Scandia, this
version--which ran in the Food section in 1990--is typical of the
dish often served in restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Veal Oscar</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, divided</TE>
<TE>   4 (1/4-pound) veal cutlets, cut 1/2-inch thick</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup dry white wine</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound fresh crab meat</TE>
<TE>   12 asparagus spears, cooked tender-crisp</TE>
<TE>   Sauce Bearnaise</TE>
<TE>   Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large, heavy skillet over
medium-high heat. Season both sides of the cutlets with salt and
pepper and add them to the skillet. Cook, turning to brown both
sides, about 30 seconds a side. Add the wine, reduce the heat to
medium-low, cover and simmer until tender, turning the cutlets over
halfway, 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Cook the crab meat in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a
small skillet, 3 to 4 minutes, until heated through. Arrange the veal
cutlets on serving dishes. Place equal portions of crab over the top.</TE>
<TE>   Pour the veal cooking liquid into the crab skillet and boil
rapidly until reduced to 1/4 cup, about 3 minutes. Spoon over the
crab meat. Add 3 asparagus spears to each serving. Drizzle with Sauce
Bearnaise and serve the remaining sauce on the side.</TE>
<TE>   SAUCE BEARNAISE</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons white wine</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon tarragon vinegar</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons minced shallots or onion</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) butter</TE>
<TE>   3 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Dash white pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon prepared mustard</TE>
<TE>   Place the wine, vinegar, tarragon, shallots, pepper and sugar in a
small saucepan. Bring to a boil. Cook rapidly over high heat until
almost all the liquid has evaporated, about 3 to 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the butter in another small saucepan until bubbly, but not
browned.</TE>
<TE>   Place the egg yolks, lemon juice, salt, white pepper and mustard
in a blender container. Blend on low speed about 5 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   With the blender running, add half the butter in a slow, steady
stream until the blender blades are covered. Then increase the speed
to high and slowly add the remaining butter and cooked wine mixture.</TE>
<TE>   4 servings. Each serving: 608 calories; 1,266 mg sodium; 364 mg
cholesterol; 48 grams fat; 26 grams saturated fat; 6 grams
carbohydrates; 37 grams protein; 1.56 grams fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Note: Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of
food-borne illness and recommends that infants, the elderly and
immuno-compromised people avoid raw eggs.</TE>

<LD>Isole e Olena, located in Barberino Val d'Elsa, is one of the few
Chianti Classico producers whose normale (as opposed to riserva)
bottling is fairly priced. This one floods your palate with fresh,
juicy fruit flavors of plums and cherries. Its bright acidity and
earthy, dry finish make it an ideal food wine, particularly with
roasted or grilled meats. You couldn't ask more from a Chianti at
this price. It's hard to stop drinking it, in fact.</LD>

<HD>Making Sense of American Slang, Idioms</HD>
<DH>UCLA Extension class helps foreign speakers understand the
more subtle points of the language--and culture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES EDUCATION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a bright, airy classroom above the busy streets of Westwood, a
group of advanced English students is puzzling over one of its
toughest challenges to date:</LD>
<LD>   What is the distinction between "bum" and "bummer"?</LD>
<LD>   Teresa Masear, a dynamic 42-year-old who teaches this class on
American slang and idioms to foreign speakers, asks a middle-aged man
to define "bummer."</LD>
<TE>   "A guy who doesn't work?" offers Mauricio, who often peruses the
Wall Street Journal before class. "Good," Masear says
enthusiastically, "but that's a 'bum.'" "Bummer," she explains, once
was mostly a surfer term but is now used extensively, especially by
young people in California, to mean almost anything unpleasant.</TE>
<TE>   "So you can say a person is a bummer, or a situation, or a class.
It's pretty useful. And you can say either just 'bummer' by itself or
'It's a bummer,'" Masear says, printing the word on the board.</TE>
<TE>   As she speaks, 28 heads bend low over notebooks, their owners
carefully jotting down the proper spelling and usage of yet another
mysterious but possibly important American English term. Several
quietly say it aloud.</TE>
<TE>   For eight years, Masear, a UCLA graduate student in education, has
taught the UCLA Extension class, offering insights into American--and
California--culture alongside her lessons in the language. Her
twice-weekly classes are almost always overbooked and many students
sign up again and again.</TE>
<TE>   "She's so popular, there's almost a cult of Teresa," says Julie
Jaskol, a spokeswoman for UCLA Extension, which offers 4,500 classes
a year in everything from home decoration to taxation.</TE>
<TE>   Catering to groups that often include students from more than a
dozen countries, Masear, a slender woman with a relaxed manner, says
she tries to vary the material both to keep it current and to enable
returning students to continue to improve their English.</TE>
<TE>   But the students these days are so sophisticated and have such
advanced English skills that it's much more difficult to prepare for
them than it once was, Masear says. Nearly all her students have
college degrees and many took English classes in their own countries
for years before arriving in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The majority are professionals, sent here on temporary work or
educational assignments. Several of those in the current class, for
example, are employees of South Korea's second-largest television
network, MBC, who were sent to the United States on three-month
working holidays; nearly 100 of their colleagues have taken Masear's
class in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Others have been here many years but want to become more at ease
with English.</TE>
<TE>   "What they want is to learn the more subtle points about the
culture and language," Masear says. "You can't teach them boring
stuff--they won't put up with it."</TE>
<TE>   Lourdes Marvan, a native of Mexico who has lived in Southern
California for four years, has taken Masear's class five times and
says it has helped her feel more at ease in American society.</TE>
<TE>   "Half the words Americans use are idioms, and even if you speak
some English, you can't understand anything at first," Marvan says.
"It's so horrible; you don't feel in the culture at all."</TE>
<TE>   This particular morning, Masear's students are focusing on
confusing traffic phrases, from "jaywalking" to "jammed up" to the
shouted police command "Pull over!" "You really don't want to be
wondering what they're saying when they're trying to get you to
stop," Masear says.</TE>
<TE>   One man says he got a ticket for "tailgating" but didn't know what
it was and was too embarrassed to ask the officer who stopped him.
Two women share similar tales with their sympathetic classmates,
saying they got tickets for jaywalking only days after arriving in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so common in my country, I didn't even think you could get a
ticket for it," says Laura Radchik, 44, who moved to Southern
California from her native Mexico 16 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   A Spanish language teacher at UCLA Extension, Radchik says she is
taking Masear's class to improve her nonacademic English.</TE>
<TE>   Yumiko Tsukamoto of Japan says a word she learned in
class--"whiplash"--recently came in handy after a traffic accident,
when she was able to use it to explain to a doctor how her neck
ached.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very practical," she says of the class.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most popular features of each class is a short film
clip, typically packed with at least a dozen idioms or slang
expressions. Movies are one of the most difficult aspects of American
society for newcomers to grasp, Masear says, because they employ
cultural and linguistic shorthand at a pace that can be dizzying to a
foreign viewer.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Masear screens part of "Clueless," the 1995 film about a
pampered teenager played by Alicia Silverstone. The class chuckles
appreciatively as Silverstone's character fails a driving class and
then tries to persuade the instructor to pass her anyway.</TE>
<TE>   The class drifts into a discussion of other phrases that trip up
foreign speakers of English, laughingly exploring the meaning of
everything from "spaced out" to "big hair" and "going postal."</TE>
<TE>   Danielle Bloch, 40, of France says the conversations have helped
push her to a higher, more comfortable level of English.</TE>
<TE>   Now, after taking the class three times, "I realize I can
understand American people," Bloch says with an air of triumph. "It's
wonderful."</TE>

<LD>Me: Yack yack, yadda yadda....</LD>
<LD>   She: Oh? Hmmm....</LD>
<LD>   Me: Yes and more, thus and so....</LD>
<TE>   She: Hmmm....</TE>
<TE>   I had dinner recently with a listener. A superb listener. A
listener who thinks listening is so important that she is writing a
book on this old and--as I came to learn--increasingly rusty social
skill.</TE>
<TE>   Ahhhh....</TE>
<TE>   We were outside on a restaurant patio, California midwinter. Our
mealtime topic of conversation: listening, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "It is so precious to be listened to. It's surely a gift. I'm so
astonished what listening can do for people," says my guest, Irene
Borger. "It's very primal. It's very visceral. It's very intimate."</TE>
<TE>   To be honest, I cannot remember the last time I gave thought to
the subject of listening. I don't recall whether I regarded it even
as a subject, instead of just something one takes for granted. I
started listening in the crib, maybe sooner. And it's how I've made
my living for 31 years. What is there to it?</TE>
<TE>   Then I had a chance introduction to Borger, who is director of an
8-year-old program to recognize excellence in the visual and
performing arts, the CalArts/Alpert Award in the Arts, and former
artist in residence at AIDS Project Los Angeles. She is the editor of
the book, "The Force of Curiosity." She is also the best listener
I've ever listened to.</TE>
<TE>   She is the unusual kind of person who will say this: "I'd be happy
to use my 15 minutes of fame listening."</TE>
<TE>   For days now, I've been dwelling on her ideas. I think it's no
overstatement to confess that by heightening my appreciation of the
obvious, she altered my self-awareness by a few degrees. I haven't
been such a good listener after all. It has cost me, I see, both in
the pleasure of listening and the respect that listeners command.</TE>
<TE>   If I can generalize for effect, I might say the same about you. I
haven't been around many good listeners lately.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a difference between listening and hearing," Borger
observes. "Listening is volition. It's active. It's engaged.
Listening is a transaction."</TE>
<TE>   I've been thinking about those everyday conversations people have
in which everyone seems to be talking or winding up. I've been
observing encounters between couples, between adults and children,
between public officials and the public, between managers and
employees. I see afresh the many cues that signal, "I'm hearing you
but I'm not listening."</TE>
<TE>   Borger and I came up with a theory. I say "we" because that is the
secret of being around a good listener. Somehow, you feel part of the
action. The theory is this: Listening is about being in the present.
Those of us in busy urban environments spend too much time looking
over our shoulders. Our thoughts leap ahead to tomorrow's
obligations. It is the habit of our work, and it slops over to our
conversation. As we lose our grasp on the present, our busy brains
forget to listen.</TE>
<TE>   I think back on our dinner. Listening is a form of concentration.
But it's unlike the concentration required in talking. Because I was
attentive to the moment, I have a keener memory of my surroundings,
the richness of the risotto, the thinness of the wine, the background
city sounds.</TE>
<TE>   "You see, listening is witnessing," says Borger.</TE>
<TE>   As we listened, Borger and I came up with a dozen ideas. The point
was that just listening about listening opens up discoveries as
unexpected as if you suddenly found that you were double-jointed and
could scratch your nose with a toe.</TE>
<TE>   "We usually think of a person who is speaking as the one who is in
control," says Borger. "But that's false."</TE>
<TE>   She surprises me, but she's correct. We all have highly developed
filters against the irritation of the bore and the steady assaults of
the wheedlers. Ultimately, the power belongs to the listener, by the
choice of what passes through. Great listeners, like the late
socialite and ambassador Pamela Harriman, have the gift of making
important people feel worthy and thus became powerful themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner is ending. Borger has one more story. How did she learn to
listen? Her father's parents were deaf and spoke with sign language.
Their knowledge was passed along to her. It takes more than ears to
listen. It requires your eyes, hands, face, the nod of the head, the
bite of a lip--many elements to the transaction. Borger's fascination
for listening goes back to conversations of silence.</TE>

<HD>Bush Opened Door to Enron, but Not to a State in Crisis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANNE FEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>Dianne Feinstein, a U.S. senator from California, is a
member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although prices for energy in California and the West have mostly
returned to normal, the Enron bankruptcy continues to raise questions
about the level of influence that energy companies had over the Bush
administration during the California energy crisis and the
formulation of President Bush's energy policy.</LD>
<LD>   At this time last year, I wrote the first of three letters to the
president requesting a meeting to discuss California's dire energy
situation. These requests were denied. During this period, however,
energy executives had access to senior administration officials,
including Vice President Dick Cheney.</LD>
<LD>   On the day I sent my first letter, Jan. 20, 2001, California was
experiencing its sixth straight day of Stage 3 energy emergencies,
meaning that energy reserves were less than 1.5% above demand. The
streak would last 34 days and would involve several economically
crippling and life-threatening blackouts.</LD>
<TE>   During this month, the average price for electricity was about 10
times higher than the typical price for energy in January. Natural
gas prices in Southern California were six times higher than they
were at the same time in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, energy companies--including ones that would help to
craft the administration's energy policy--were reporting earnings for
the year. Enron and its affiliates' earnings grew 97% in 2000 from
1999; Duke and its affiliates' earnings were up 226%; Reliant and its
affiliates' earnings increased by 166%; and Williams and its
affiliates' earnings grew 127%.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these year-end profits were amassed in California, and
first-quarter earnings for 2001 would prove to be even more
impressive.</TE>
<TE>   I sent a second letter to the White House on March 26 asking to
speak with the president directly. Again, the request was denied.</TE>
<TE>   With the onset of spring and reduced natural gas demand, gas
prices in California had dropped from the beginning of the month but
were still almost 2 1/2 times higher than the rest of the West.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of electricity for the month was as much as 20
times higher than usual.</TE>
<TE>   By this time the energy crisis had enveloped the West--from the
Canadian border to Nevada and from the Pacific Ocean to Montana. In
fact, prices for electricity in Oregon and Washington exceeded
California's prices on a number of days.</TE>
<TE>   I sent a third letter to Bush on April 19 requesting a meeting.
This too was denied.</TE>
<TE>   This was two weeks after Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, California's
largest utility, filed the then-largest bankruptcy in U.S. history,
and California's second-largest utility, Southern California Edison,
was on the verge of insolvency.</TE>
<TE>   It was also two days after Duke announced that its first-quarter
income had increased 465% from the year before and three days after
Reliant reported that its income grew 202% in the same period from
the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   On April 19, natural gas prices still were exorbitantly high. What
was striking about this was that prices in April for natural gas and
electricity typically reach their lowest levels of the season. In
fact, it was not until June 2001 that prices returned to near normal
in the natural gas and electricity markets.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the crisis, I was not allowed a private interview with
the president or vice president--even though such a talk may have
helped California.</TE>
<TE>   Now we learn that Kenneth Lay, then the chief executive of Enron,
had several meetings with Cheney over that same span. He was not the
only energy company executive who met with the vice president.</TE>
<TE>   Something is wrong when a senator representing 35 million
Californians is not able to talk personally to the president or vice
president in the midst of a crisis, but executives from a company
that contributed millions of campaign dollars have complete access
and significant influence.</TE>
<TE>   We need to enact safeguards to ensure that companies cannot use
undue influence to reap extraordinary benefits during a crisis.</TE>

<HD>Watching Her Go From a Doll to a Rock to a Bomb</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KAY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kay is editorials editor at the National Post
in Toronto, Canada. E-mail: jkay@nationalpost.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Neither Islamic Jihad nor Hamas has taken responsibility for the
deadly bombing of a Jerusalem shopping district on Sunday. That is
not surprising: The bomber was a woman. Both terror groups have
fundamentalist Islamic agendas, and neither believes a woman is
deserving of a martyr's glory.</LD>
<LD>   But Sunday's attack did not mark the first time that Israel has
been victimized by a female terrorist. In 1978, a woman named Dalal
al Mughrabi led a group of terrorists who took over a civilian bus on
the road between Haifa and Tel Aviv. Thirty-seven Israeli civilians
were killed, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in Israeli
history.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, I met with Itamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media
Watch, a group dedicated to monitoring the Palestinian Authority's
state-controlled media. In a prescient presentation, Marcus showed me
Palestinian television programming that glorified Al Mughrabi. On a
show called "Panorama," a commentator described Al Mughrabi as "a
symbol for the Palestinian nation" who demonstrated "the Palestinian
woman's role as a fighter." The speaker exhorted viewers to "cling to
Dalal as an individual who belongs to the Palestinian consciousness."</LD>
<TE>   Following this, viewers were shown a dramatization in which
Israeli Jews threaten a Palestinian with a pistol in the cemetery in
which Al Mughrabi is buried. As the action unfolds, Al Mughrabi
appears above her grave as a protective spirit.</TE>
<TE>   In the Muslim and non-Muslim worlds alike, female suicide bombers
are a rarity. The only exceptions are cult-like groups led by
charismatic leaders, such as Sri Lanka's guerrilla group the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which has launched more suicide
attacks than any terror group in the world. How do the Tigers recruit
female terrorists? The strategy is simple: Get them while they're
young. Velupillai Prabhakaran, the Tigers' leader, personally
brainwashes preadolescent boys and girls, many of them war orphans.
By the time they're teenagers, they have become human time bombs.
Girls and women participate in 30% to 40% of the Tigers' suicide
attacks, including the 1991 killing of former Indian Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi and an unsuccessful 1999 attempt on Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Kumaratunga that cost her an eye.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has copied the Tigers' strategy
of using the mass media. Marcus showed me recordings of programs from
Palestinian state-controlled television. In one of the most
disgusting vignettes, a boy is shown clutching a toy car. He gazes at
the camera, drops the toy and picks up a rock to throw at Israelis.
Then the same shot is shown, this time with a girl holding a doll.
She, too, rejects her toy in favor of a rock. In another vignette, a
boy is being interviewed by a reporter. The interviewer asks the boy
if he wants to become a martyr. He says yes. She asks if he is afraid
to die. He pauses and stares at her, not knowing what to say. She
shakes her head from side to side slightly, signaling the expected
response. "No," he then says, defiantly.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Durra, the 12-year-old killed as he was held by his
father during an October 2000 firefight between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian gunmen, has been turned into a recruiting tool for child
martyrs. In one Palestinian television clip, the boy is shown in what
is depicted as a "children's paradise."</TE>
<TE>   The television station of the radical Lebanese Islamic movement
Hezbollah identified Sunday's bomber as a female student from An
Najah University in the West Bank city of Nablus. If the report of
her age is correct, then she probably was exposed to this brand of
vile propaganda since she was an adolescent. It is no accident that
she turned to violence once she outgrew her dolls.</TE>

<HD>Sometimes, a Laundry List Is the Ticket</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton, who writes a column for Newsday in
New York, worked in the White House of President George H.W. Bush.
E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George W. Bush no doubt wanted to give a State of the Union address
much different from--and better than--anything Bill Clinton gave. So
Bush would be incisive and thematic, in sharp contrast to the
promiscuously prolix Clinton. And yet on Tuesday night, 48
minutes--and 77 applause lines--after he started speaking, he was
finally done. The 43rd president found himself in similar
laundry-list mode, reading aloud a string of agenda items from
education to welfare to farm policy to "broader home ownership,
especially for minorities" to his new U.S.A. Freedom Corps.</LD>
<LD>   But Bush's speech reflects reality--the reality that presidents
must update up to the moment when the text is fed into the
TelePrompTer. After all, in his first speech to Congress in February,
the words "Afghanistan" and "homeland security" were not heard at
all, and "terror" was used just once. And yet last night, there was
Hamid Karzai, the interim new leader of Afghanistan, and a gallery of
heroes from the war against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Other issues, too, have erupted suddenly. Most likely, Bush had no
plans to mention corporate responsibility before a few weeks ago,
when Enron erupted. But last night Bush sternly pronounced that
"corporate America must be made more accountable to employees and
shareholders."</LD>
<TE>   Such ad hoc topic creep--once one new speech subject got in, it
was impossible to say no to old speech topics--surely violated Bush's
tidy turn of mind, but over the course of more than two dozen drafts,
the exhaustive list of bases to touch upon became more and more
reminiscent of Clinton's touchy-feely approach.</TE>
<TE>   So does that mean the speech was a failure? Not really.</TE>
<TE>   Only pundits and poets care about broad themes. Clinton and his
reelection guru, Dick Morris, seemed to understand that voters and
groups were much less interested in thematic purity and far more
eager to see themselves and their causes get a plug.</TE>
<TE>   And yet even so, Bush left out such hot issues as abortion,
biotech and global warming. But just as Clinton had a
strategy--remember "triangulation"?--so Bush seemed to be outlining a
triple strategy.</TE>
<TE>   The first item is the war on terror, which really has two
dimensions, international and domestic. Here Bush has a lot of good
news to report, but the bad news is that Osama bin Laden is still on
the loose, and the latest issue of Foreign Affairs features six
articles under the overall headline, "Long War in the Making."</TE>
<TE>   Pundits aren't always right, of course. But it seems reasonable
that the two objectives Bush set forth for himself--capturing Bin
Laden "dead or alive" and smoking out "evildoers" everywhere--have
not been met. Bush wisely said as much in his speech. He declared,
"Our war against terror is only beginning," reminding his audience
that "tens of thousands of trained terrorists are still at large."</TE>
<TE>   The second element is the economy. The polls show that Americans
still regard this as the top issue, and here Bush is on strong
ground, if he can simultaneously keep his tax cuts intact, control
spending and still enact a stimulus package. As Bush said, "My
economic security plan can be summed up in one word: jobs."</TE>
<TE>   The third issue is Enron. The true arc of the story is that a
company that "invested" heavily in the Bush administration got no
help; it's a no-win bankruptcy. But the media, far more than the
Democrats--many of whom got dubious campaign cash from corporate
sources--are carrying the story.</TE>
<TE>   Some pressies have lost all perspective. For example, New York
Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote Tuesday: "I predict that in the
years ahead Enron, not Sept. 11, will come to be seen as the greater
turning point in U.S. society."</TE>
<TE>   Most Americans probably don't agree with that assessment, of
course. But in the battle of the media, Bush seems to understand the
challenge he faces.</TE>
<TE>   So Bush, like every president before him, finds himself fighting
different battles but with similar tools. Every president in the
television age figures out that the State of the Union speech is an
unmatched opportunity to get his message across. So, most likely,
Bush's somewhat formless speech will give him a bump in the polls.</TE>
<TE>   Defined themes may be good in theory, but fuzzy prolongation plays
well in politics.</TE>

<LD>Put yourself in the shoes of Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf as
he glances back and forth at his troubled nation's borders. To the
west, at the urging of the United States, his troops struggle to head
off Taliban warriors and Al Qaeda terrorists fleeing Afghanistan. To
the east, Indian troops rattle sabers. Between borders, home-grown
fundamentalists plot.</LD>
<LD>   So how is he supposed to react when India ominously sends a
missile capable of carrying a nuclear weapon arcing across the blue
sky from an island in the Bay of Bengal?</LD>
<LD>   India and Pakistan already have fought three wars in half a
century and came close to another in 1999. In the last seven weeks
they have massed nearly 1 million troops on their borders, poised
again for combat. Both nations have nuclear weapons. The last thing
anyone needed was India's test-firing a missile with a range of 400
miles.</LD>
<TE>   India had every right to be outraged at the Dec. 13 attack on its
Parliament building that killed 14 people including the five
terrorist raiders. But not at Pakistan's president. When New Delhi
blamed two Pakistan-based organizations, Musharraf banned those
groups and three others and arrested hundreds of members. He also
delivered a courageous speech meant for the ears of Indians and
Americans as well as his own countrymen, declaring that Pakistan
"will not allow its territory to be used for any terrorist activity
anywhere in the world." The arrests and the speech were a good match
of deeds and words.</TE>
<TE>   India said it welcomed the developments, but it did not
reciprocate as it should have. Pulling back even a few thousand
troops would have shown that New Delhi recognized Musharraf's
boldness in trying to reverse nearly a quarter-century of increasing
Islamic extremism in Pakistan, much of it encouraged by previous
governments.</TE>
<TE>   India does have a concern that Pakistan does not: elections.
Musharraf is an army general who seized power in a coup two years
ago. India is a democracy, balancing constituencies that include
hard-line anti-Pakistan groups and moderate organizations. Coming
elections in several Indian states may induce the government to keep
the pressure on Pakistan in a bid to pick up votes. But national
security and regional security should dictate India's response, not
politics.</TE>
<TE>   The one key area where Musharraf may merit India's wrath is his
dealings with the disputed territory of Kashmir. For years Pakistan
has helped guerrillas cross from the part it controls into the part
controlled by India. Tens of thousands of insurgents and Indian
troops as well as Kashmiri militants fighting for independence have
died. India is right to want a far firmer commitment from Musharraf
that he will stop the flow of Pakistani guerrillas into the region.</TE>
<TE>   First, though, it's India's turn. No more blustery missile tests.
And a pullback of Indian troops from the border to reduce the
possibility of war. If Musharraf's recent actions are any indication,
he is the sort of mature pragmatist who will reciprocate. Then,
someday, the two nations can discuss Kashmir.</TE>

<LD>Nothing better underscores the extraordinary times in which the
United States finds itself than the guests that President Bush
invited to his State of the Union speech Tuesday night. This year the
sight of Afghanistan's interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai, Shannon
Spann, the widow of the CIA agent slain in Afghanistan, and two
flight attendants who foiled Richard C. Reid's alleged attempt to
blow up an airplane was moving testimony that America is no longer
isolated. As Bush suggested in his speech, the nation is not only a
beacon of universal values; it has also become an international
target.</LD>
<LD>   The president correctly reminded Americans that the hard battle
against terrorism has only just begun. Tens of thousands of fighters,
he said, remain ticking "time bombs" ready to explode anywhere and
everywhere, whether it is in the U.S. or abroad. The big question he
left unresolved: whether the U.S. will attack Iraq or other
countries. But he named names--Iraq, Iran, North Korea--and prudently
left his options open. How far Bush will go in combating an "axis of
evil" remains unclear. But Americans have received the message. The
last Axis was not defeated overnight, nor will this one be.</LD>
<TE>   Six Al Qaeda fighters were killed Monday in a Kandahar hospital
after refusing to surrender for nearly two months. In Singapore, a
jailed man is considered a possible link between extremist Islamic
groups operating in that island nation, the Philippines, Indonesia
and Malaysia. Dozens of suspected terrorists have been arrested in
those countries in recent weeks, and U.S. Special Forces units are in
the Philippines for what the Pentagon says is a mission to train
Filipino soldiers fighting Muslim insurgents. The global effort
becomes more urgent with Bush's alarming announcement that U.S.
forces have found terrorist diagrams for nuclear plants and water
treatment facilities. And while it is easy to say, as he did, that
the nation will pay "whatever it costs to defend our country," his
defense experts will have to decide, soon, which weapons systems can
safely be left behind so newer, expensive high-tech systems can be
developed.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's call for a new "culture of responsibility," expanding
national volunteer service and doubling the ranks of the Peace Corps
was as welcome to hear from him as it was to hear from previous
presidents. Bush promised economic renewal, but his vagueness on
corporate reform could come back to haunt him.</TE>
<TE>   Already Wall Street, as Tuesday's stock tumble indicated, is
exceedingly nervous that more Enrons might be in the pipeline. Bush
devoted only a few short sentences to protection of pension funds and
reform of the accounting practices that led to Enron's spectacular
crash. In fact, he never mentioned Enron by name.</TE>
<TE>   This debacle, now apparently spreading to other companies with
shadowy or hidden debts, has generated deeper fears on financial
markets and in the American psyche than Bush seems to understand. It
makes sense that he played to his anti-terrorism credentials in the
State of the Union. It has proven much harder for him to acknowledge
that the part of government he campaigned so hard against, regulators
and overseers, may be as necessary as the Special Forces.</TE>

<LD>California taxpayers with retirement accounts may be in for a nasty
surprise unless the Legislature steps lively to conform state tax law
with recent changes in federal law. If the state fails to act, it may
penalize those who take advantage of the new liberal limits set by
the federal government for contributions to individual retirement
accounts, 401(k) accounts and similar plans.</LD>
<LD>   There is some foot-dragging in the Legislature because of the cost
of making the change while the state faces a $12.4-billion deficit.
But the cost is only an estimated $44 million--an amount that could
easily be offset by closing one or more of the many loopholes in
California's Swiss-cheese tax law.</LD>
<LD>   Federal law was changed last year to boost the limits on
tax-deferred contributions to 401(k) retirement savings plans,
individual retirement accounts, education IRAs and other programs.
Despite the problems with 401(k)s that were brought to light in the
Enron bankruptcy, they are popular with workers and here to stay.
Though reforms are needed, government should do what it can to
encourage and increase their use.</LD>
<TE>   The federal change also allowed people 50 years old or older to
make "catch-up" contributions to their retirement plans. But state
law is stuck on the old federal limits. Without conformity, those who
take advantage of the higher federal limits could face a bigger state
income tax bill or penalties for exceeding the state limits.</TE>
<TE>   There are bills in the Legislature that would adopt some but not
all of the federal limits. Government should be making it as easy as
possible to save, especially since fewer and fewer employers offer
old-style pension benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Even beyond retirement accounts, the state should make its tax
laws as similar as possible to the federal system to simplify the job
facing tax filers. State forms now are far more complicated than
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   By closing odd loopholes such as the business deduction the state
offers for club memberships, Sacramento could pick up enough revenue
to cover the loss from conforming retirement plan rules.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Cheney Defends Refusal to Detail Energy Meetings," Jan. 28:</LD>
<LD>   Vice President Dick Cheney feels previous administrations have
"traded away" authority and that the demand for more information
regarding the White House/Enron dealings is a partisan "fishing
expedition." Funny, this administration seems to have exactly the
opposite view regarding the treatment of the general public in its
so-called war on terrorism, curtailing our civil liberties and
casting a wide net to catch "evildoers."</LD>
<LD>   Regardless of what may or may not have happened in those energy
meetings, there appears to be a stink bomb in the administration's
Enron baggage, and we the public want to know: Did they pack it
themselves? Were they asked to carry anything for anyone? Has it been
in their possession at all times?</LD>
<TE>   Ged Kenslea</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cheney regarding Enron: "There is no evidence to indicate anybody
did anything wrong in the administration." And, of course, he doesn't
think that we can be trusted to make that determination after hearing
all the details, so he won't give them to us. Oh, why didn't I invest
in the paper-shredding industry instead of Enron?</TE>
<TE>   Bob Stroh</TE>
<TE>   Fillmore</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Congressional hearings have been convened to investigate the Enron
tragedy in what seems to be record-breaking time. When issues
directly affect its members, Congress can move with uncharacteristic
speed. The far more urgent concern of extending unemployment and
health benefits for the growing jobless ranks, however, has been
shunted aside for the umpteenth time. Could this be because the Enron
debacle provides greater political finger-pointing opportunities than
the survival struggle of those less fortunate?</TE>
<TE>   Jane Garcia</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Enron Vision Proved Costly to Firm, State" (Jan. 28) portrays
Enron as the root of all electric-industry evil. It fails to portray
what happened. Deregulation is working in other states. California's
Legislature dropped the ball. AB 1890 was not a deregulation bill. It
was called "industry restructuring" because the legislators would not
let go and create a true market, as you allege Enron wanted. The joke
of 1996 was that AB 1890 was "re-regulation."</TE>
<TE>   You imply that Enron was the most influential lobbyist. In fact,
California utilities like Southern California Edison contributed
large sums of money, personnel and influence during that period, not
to create the "perfect market" but to create legislation that would
allow them to recapture 100% of their stranded assets. Many lobbyists
were heavily involved in that legislative process, trying to secure
legislated benefits for other narrow constituents. For state Sen.
Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) to now say, in effect, "Enron made me do it"
leads me to believe that he is not the brightest bulb in the
Legislature.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The American public should say thank you to Enron. The dramatic
implosion of Enron reveals a fatal flaw of privatization and
deregulation. The California energy crisis is a good example of
failed deregulation, where the state opened the energy system to
manipulation and price gouging. It drained the state's resources from
the three publicly traded utilities--as well as the state's
surplus--to the bone.</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully, the Enron bankruptcy will slow down the bullet train of
privatization and deregulation being pushed by the Republican Party.
Imagine the suffering the public will face if the privatization of
Social Security is successfully rammed through Congress on the
coattails of the president's popularity. Enron's workers and retirees
who are educated (attorneys, traders and various professionals) still
lost their pensions. Average American workers don't stand a chance to
protect their private Social Security accounts.</TE>

<LD>I think Selig Harrison has summed up "America's India Problem" very
well (Opinion, Jan. 27). To my mind, the root cause was America's
Cold War policy directed at containing the Soviets during the last 50
years. It is more than 10 years since there has been a Soviet threat,
but America still continues its outdated policy, supporting military
dictatorships, even against another democracy, purely for political
expediency.</LD>
<LD>   If America is serious about exporting democracy to the rest of the
world, it should, in principle, support a democracy (no matter how
bad) against any feudal regime or dictatorship, and thereby let
dictators know that they cannot take U.S. support for granted. A
foreign policy that will always support democracy elsewhere would be
consistent with America's position as the most powerful democracy in
the world.</LD>
<LD>   Such a fundamental change in foreign policy will save the U.S.
from having to destroy the dictatorships it once supported, as one
can see from the past 50 years of such a lopsided policy. Let us hope
U.S. support of Pakistan becomes a turning point in U.S. foreign
policy.</LD>

<TE>   Harrison clearly spells out the dangers of blindly supporting
President Pervez Musharraf's regime without putting adequate pressure
on him to rein in terrorists who attack India. The military buildup
at the India-Pakistan border is the result of years of terrorist
attacks on Indian soil, and there can be no peace in the region until
Pakistan stops arming and aiding in the infiltration of terrorists
into India.</TE>

Second, it is the arrogance of people who put out statements like

gates at this very moment. Loath as I am to paint the following
dreadful scenario, I foresee that what will crush this country is not
a Bin Laden or a galactic force or a flawed emperor, but the
availability of too many choices. In the not-too-distant future the
entire populace of this country will be absolutely immobilized by
indecision.</TE>
<TE>   This will occur with a startling suddenness as our collective
brains collapse while attempting to process all the choices presented
to us on the shelves of our stores. For those of you who may be prone
to scoff at this notion I invite you to visit the household cleaner
section of your market or the cosmetics counters of department stores
or the Internet. Undoubtedly a few will be spared this horrific event
and survive to found a simpler America.</TE>

<HD>Patrons Raise the Roof Over LACMA Redesign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I applaud Marc Haefele's "LACMA's $300-Million Roof" (Opinion, Jan.
27). When we moved to Los Angeles in 1967 the museum was very new. It
was a grand structure, and it still is. The concept of spending all
those millions of dollars for a new roof to house the old art
collections is ludicrous and wasteful. His idea of using the money
for cultural programs for our schools is outstanding. As an art
teacher, I have seen the lack of art education as a sad situation.
What a worthwhile and exciting use of funds it would be to bring the
arts--and new schools as well--back to our young people.</LD>
<LD>   Doris Spivack</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Haefele's criticism of the proposed building for LACMA is
unjustified. Over 30,000 schoolchildren, grades one through 12, tour
LACMA's art collection each year. The new building will not only
display more of LACMA's vast collection of art to these students but
will radically change the way the art is displayed. The innovative
LACMA galleries will allow students to easily see exciting
cross-cultural comparisons of art from around the world and over
time. Haefele's proposed alternative expenditure of funds on
"same-old" art education will have far less impact on the children of
L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Sheldon Welles</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Palisades</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bravo to Haefele for speaking out against LACMA's plans to
redesign its Wilshire Boulevard campus. Those in the elite who have
decided to destroy the 16-year-old Robert O. Anderson Building, along
with other museum structures, and replace them with a circus tent
have lost all sight of their place in the scheme of local government.
The museum is called the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It is on
county-owned land and run with county taxpayer money. To destroy
relatively new buildings, while other county facilities such as the
hospital, health facilities and courts decay, is a disgrace.</TE>
<TE>   Haefele's points on arts education are well taken. Who will visit
the great tent if there is no future generation that has an
appreciation for art? It appears the donors wish to create this
cultural icon for their own enjoyment. And, to the rest of us: Let
them eat cake.</TE>

<LD>If ever there was a poster image of the age of travel innocence, the
photo of Jerry Hulse is it ("Jerry Hulse, 77; Times Travel Editor,"
obituary, Jan. 26). Was it just American travel innocence? I think
so. We could buy a ticket, get on an airplane and just go someplace.
The principal complaint was the food, as if airlines, no matter what
the advertisements said, could ever be three-star restaurants. Our
travel was limited by income, not fear of terrorists. The innocence
was lost after the first hijacking and the advent of metal detectors.</LD>
<LD>   I've never flown on any aircraft--private or commercial or
glider--that at the moment the craft is airborne I have not
considered a miracle, no matter what the engineers and physicists can
prove. It's part of the travel package that Mr. Hulse conveyed. That
we would arrive safely at our destination was practically a given.
His obituary reminds me of the passing from carefree travel to the

<LD>Re ''Prisoner Received Heart Transplant,'' Jan. 26: Perhaps a word to
the wise is in order before the inevitable political backlash occurs
in Sacramento. First, to the conservatives: Laws to prohibit organ
transplants for prisoners will be found unconstitutional, so don't
waste the taxpayers' money in an effort to gain a nonexistent
political advantage. To the left: The status quo is not acceptable.
Law-abiding, free people should have priority for organs before those
persons who, by their very actions, have demonstrated their desire to
weaken the fabric of society.</LD>
<LD>   We should alter the laws to clarify that prisoners are indeed
eligible for organ transplants and that prisoners' priority to
receive those transplants will be after that of all the other
residents of California who labor to support them.</LD>

<HD>Cendant Down 10% as Worries Spread</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: The company's stock tumbles after two analysts
warn clients of a potentially critical newspaper report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Analysts at two brokerages helped push Cendant Corp. shares lower
Tuesday by telling clients that the Wall Street Journal may be
preparing an article critical of the company's accounting.</LD>
<LD>   But Cendant, which franchises Days Inn hotels and Coldwell Banker
residential brokerages and owns the Avis rental car business, said it
is "not aware of any impending negative news media story."</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, the stock slid $1.83, or 10%, to $16.52 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   "This is typical of the times," said Thomas McIntyre, a portfolio
manager with Dessauer &amp; McIntyre Asset Management, which owned 1.4
million Cendant shares as of the end of September. "Investors are
shooting first and asking questions later."</TE>
<TE>   Brokerage Credit Suisse First Boston told clients Monday night
that the Journal was working on a story related to Cendant's
accounting, analysts and investors said. A Lehman Bros. analyst
followed Tuesday with a note to clients saying he had talked to the
paper about an article, said McIntyre.</TE>
<TE>   The Credit Suisse analyst who follows Cendant, Scott Barry, and
the Lehman analyst, Jeff Kessler, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Journal said the paper does not discuss
stories the paper may or may not be working on.</TE>
<TE>   Enron Corp.'s collapse in December was fueled in part by
revelations that it hid losses in off-balance-sheet partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant has stakes in seven ventures that can be considered off
the balance sheet, said Jay Leupp, an analyst at brokerage Robertson
Stephens. These ventures contain $1 billion to $1.5 billion of debt,
he estimated. But "Cendant hasn't used these off-balance-sheet
ventures to hide debt," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Cendant may be especially vulnerable to accounting concerns
because of its history. The company's former chairman, Walter A.
Forbes, was accused of overstating earnings at CUC International,
which merged with HFS Inc. in 1997 to create Cendant. Cendant later
restated three years of earnings and agreed to pay $2.83 billion to
settle a suit accusing the company of defrauding shareholders.</TE>

<HD>Enron Puts Stock in Turnaround Specialist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS and LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Eight weeks after going broke, Enron Corp. selected management
consultant Stephen Cooper as interim chief executive to steer the
fallen energy giant through Bankruptcy Court, a battery of
shareholder lawsuits and a criminal probe.</LD>
<LD>   Board members tapped Cooper, a principal of New York-based
turnaround firm Zolfo Cooper, less than a week after the resignation
of Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay. The board has not
named a new chairman.</LD>
<LD>   Cooper, 55, said Tuesday that "Enron has real businesses with real
value." But whether he can restructure the firm and handle the
complex legal issues to allow it to keep operating remained an open
question, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   Enron already has sold a majority stake in its commodities trading
business, which generated about 90% of the $100 billion in revenue it
reported for 2000. The company also has handed control of its largest
pipeline to Houston-based rival Dynegy Inc., and expects to sell its
Portland General Electric division for an estimated $3 billion to
Northwest Natural Gas Co. Enron's remaining assets, including smaller
pipelines and utilities outside the U.S., accounted for just a
fraction of its revenue.</TE>
<TE>   But Cooper, in a voicemail disseminated to Enron's employees,
offered an optimistic take on the company's current divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "The physical assets look to me to be of an enormous advantage
here," Cooper said. "The regulated assets--the pipelines and
generating plants-- provide reliable, steady cash flow and returns.
And they provide a very sound, fundamental base to restructure
around."</TE>
<TE>   Many experts, however, expressed doubt Cooper will be able to do
anything more than sell off Enron in pieces.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it hard to envision a workable entity coming out of
bankruptcy here," said Andre Meade, a utilities analyst for
Commerzbank Securities. "The only business that really makes sense is
a smaller version of what Enron was in the first place--a small
gas-pipeline company, but the demands of the industry over the last
couple of years have basically eliminated all small-pipeline
companies."</TE>
<TE>   Enron is still seeking a chairman, who must deal with the firm's
interests in Washington, where it is under attack on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Panagos, a partner at Zolfo Cooper, said the firm believes
Enron has enough cash to continue operations and emerge from
bankruptcy. ''It has a good customer base, it has a good supplier
base and most importantly it has plenty of liquidity,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper's biggest asset, analysts said, is whatever goodwill he can
generate from the creditors' committee. Cooper comes to the company
as an outsider--an attribute sought by committee members who pushed
for Lay's exit.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper began studying company reorganizations while working as an
accountant at Touche Ross, now known as Deloitte &amp; Touche. In 1986,
he joined a former colleague, Frank Zolfo, to form Zolfo Cooper.
Cooper, a graduate of Occidental College in Los Angeles and the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, declined interview
requests Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the management shuffling announced Tuesday, Enron
President and Chief Operating Officer Lawrence G. Whalley resigned to
take a post at UBS Warburg, the Swiss bank that acquired Enron's
trading division this month. Enron also elevated Chief Financial
Officer Jeff McMahon to succeed Whalley and named treasurer Ray Bowen
as CFO.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon Burchett, president of Dallas-based energy firm specialist
Risk Limited Corp., noted that the promoted executives have not been
implicated in the scandal, but "if I were a creditor, what I'd like
to see is a whole new cast."</TE>
<TE>   When Cooper was hired to help rescue troubled Canadian
transportation firm Laidlaw Inc. in mid-2000, he clearly identified
the problem areas, Laidlaw Chairman Peter Widdrington said.</TE>
<TE>   "He can get deadlines established which initially look
unrealistic, but the more he sells the deadline to all involved, the
more realistic they become," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts noted that Cooper, a veteran of the bankruptcies of
Federated Department Stores and other firms, has little experience in
the energy field.</TE>
<TE>   But Widdrington, who has discussed the Enron debacle with Cooper,
said, "Steve himself is not awed by the task. He thinks essentially
the operational aspects of the company are still in decent shape."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper plans to continue as Laidlaw's vice chairman and chief
restructuring officer.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper's firm also has been consulting for Polaroid Corp. since
last summer and assisted the firm as it prepared to file for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection in October. Polaroid spokesman Skip Colcord
said the company could not comment on Zolfo Cooper's performance
because Polaroid has not yet emerged from bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA bankruptcy law professor Lynn LoPucki said Enron probably can
emerge from Chapter 11, but it probably will do so as a shadow of its
former self. "There will be a lot of pieces of things that survive
from Enron, but they aren't in any real sense Enron," he said. "One
might carry the Enron name, one might be the same legal entity, but
they won't be anything like the pre-bankruptcy Enron."</TE>
<TE>   Michael J. Miller, a former Enron employee and a member of the
organization that sued Enron officials Monday for severance and other
losses, said he remains hopeful that Cooper can squeeze cash flow
from Enron's shell.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly we'll wish this guy well on his endeavors, but we're
also going to be watching what's going on," Miller said. "We have
very high stakes."</TE>

<HD>Consumer Confidence Jumps in January</HD>
<DH>Economy: Upturn reflects hopes that spending will remain
resilient. Durable goods orders also rose.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. consumer confidence jumped for a second straight month in
January, a research group said Tuesday, supporting expectations that
resilient consumer spending will bolster an economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   A separate Commerce Department report showing orders for
big-ticket manufactured goods rose by 2.0% to $176.4 billion in
December, offering hope that the nation's factories will recover soon
and help lift the economy from recession.</LD>
<LD>   The Conference Board, a New York-based research group, said its
closely watched index of consumer confidence rose to 97.3 in January,
beating Wall Street expectations and up from a revised 94.6 in
December.</LD>
<TE>   Consumers' expectations for the next six months reached the
highest point in more than a year, helping to reinforce hopes that
spending, which represents about two-thirds of economic activity,
will remain resilient in months ahead.</TE>
<TE>   That optimism was reflected by a Los Angeles Times poll of 1,845
Californians conducted Wednesday through Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-three percent of those surveyed said they expected
California's economy to be in better shape in six months than it is
now, compared with 11% who thought it would be worse. Meanwhile, 73%
said they felt secure about their personal finances.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence is mounting that the Federal Reserve, which is expected
to announce its latest decision on interest rates today, may have
lowered borrowing costs enough to usher in an economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board's expectations index surged in January to its
highest level in more than a year, up to 96.9 from 92.4 in December,
led by building confidence about the business outlook and prospects
for employment, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   That subcomponent, which gauges consumers' views about the six
months ahead, is now up more than 25 points since a sharp plunge
after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The present situation index, which measures Americans' views of
the economy right now, remained unchanged at 97.8, signaling the
economy is laying the foundations for a shift from recession back to
growth.</TE>
<TE>   The present situation index read 170.5 in January 2001, two months
before the economy slipped into recession.</TE>
<TE>   Americans still have a pessimistic view of the current job
situation, with 22.7% saying jobs are "hard to get," up from 21.9% in
December. December's gain in orders for durable goods--big-ticket
items intended to last three years or more, ranging from washing
machines to airplanes--was stronger than the 1.3% gain forecast by
economists. It was the second increase in orders in the last three
months.</TE>
<TE>   But orders for the entire calendar 2001 year fell by 13.2%--the
weakest showing since 1992, the earliest year for which comparable
data are available.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding transportation, orders rose by 1.4% after a 0.7% rise in
November. Excluding defense items, orders rose 1.7% in December,
compared with 1.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Inventories fell for an 11th consecutive month, down 0.4% to
$284.7 billion. Notable among declines for the month was a 2.6% dip
in orders for computers and related products.</TE>

<HD>4 Studios to Offer Protected Videotapes in HD Format</HD>
<DH>Digital: Titles will use a copy-protection technology to
guard against piracy of high-definition tapes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four Hollywood studios plan to release their first high-definition
videotapes this year--the first time major films will be available in
such a richly detailed, high-quality format.</LD>
<LD>   To overcome their piracy fears, however, the studios back a
copy-protection scheme with little support from consumer-electronics
manufacturers. Meanwhile, several competing Hollywood studios said
they don't plan to release any high-definition videotapes, setting
the stage for a new battle over incompatible forms of prerecorded
video.</LD>
<LD>   Artisan Entertainment, DreamWorks SKG, Twentieth Century Fox and
Universal Studios are expected to announce today their support for
D-VHS, a digital videotape technology developed by Japanese
consumer-electronics giant JVC. To guard against piracy, their tapes
will use D-Theater, a D-VHS feature also developed by JVC.</LD>
<TE>   The companies don't plan a major push into D-VHS, in part because
so few D-VHS players are available. Only two manufacturers sell D-VHS
machines in the United States, and only the JVC units support
D-Theater.</TE>
<TE>   The four studios' embrace of D-Theater also has ominous overtones
for consumers who've already purchased expensive high-definition TV
sets. Several executives said Hollywood is pressuring
consumer-electronics companies to equip D-VHS machines only with
copy-protected digital connections that won't work with most HDTV
sets on the market today.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at three other major film studios and several
consumer-electronics companies said they had no plans for D-VHS
movies or players. Instead, many companies are holding off until a
high-definition version of DVD is perfected in a few years.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we think this [D-VHS] format is obsolete before it
even gets to market," said Marsha King, a business-development
executive at Warner Home Video.</TE>
<TE>   Added Ben Feingold, president of the digital studios division
within Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment, "It's a really dumb
idea."</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of D-VHS say that the picture quality is three to four
times better than today's DVDs. The home-theater enthusiasts who've
invested in high-definition televisions want high-definition movies,
and D-VHS makes that possible today.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always been a supporter of any new technology that moves
the industry forward," said Steve Beeks, president of Artisan Family
Home Entertainment. "We're talking about seeding the industry with a
decent but relatively small base of software to give the hardware a
chance to gain a foothold in the marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   Kelley Avery, head of worldwide home entertainment for DreamWorks,
noted that D-VHS is the only technology available to consumers for
high-definition videos. "Our hope is that, as the number of
high-definition television households increase, people will be
looking for pre-recorded high-definition content and will be looking
for these machines."</TE>
<TE>   The lack of pre-recorded programs has been a stumbling block for
HDTV, which can offer richly detailed pictures and cinematic sound.
But with only 2 million homes with HDTV sets, the audience for
high-definition programming is too small to justify much of an
investment by the studios.</TE>
<TE>   Artisan, DreamWorks, Fox and Universal offered no specific product
plans, prices or release dates for their D-VHS tapes.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, executives said they'd be reserving the D-VHS format for
effects-laden films that appeal to consumers with high-end home
theaters.</TE>
<TE>   "The ideal pictures for them," said Craig Kornblau, president of
Universal Studios Home Video, "would be those of significant size and
scope.... Pictures that show what the home theater, and D-VHS, can
do."</TE>
<TE>   "There is absolutely a consumer need for this. Consumers want this
badly," Kornblau said. But the studios wouldn't have agreed to the
D-VHS format, he said, without D-Theater, which offers "the highest
level of protection we've seen."</TE>

<HD>Hilton 4th-Quarter Profit Falls 94%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hilton Hotels Corp., the third-largest U.S. hotel company, said its
fourth-quarter profit fell 94% as fewer travelers stayed in its
hotels after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell to $4 million, or 1 cent a share, from $64
million, or 17 cents a year earlier, Chief Executive Steven
Bollenbach said on a conference call.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue declined 24% to $662 million at the Beverly Hills-based
company, whose properties include Honolulu's Hilton Hawaiian Village.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue per room, a measure of occupancy and room rate, at hotels
Hilton owns and operates, fell 23% from a year earlier. The company's
average daily rate fell 12% in the quarter, while occupancy fell to
59.7% from 67.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Bollenbach has said he was "managing for recovery" and avoiding
layoffs, while rivals such as Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide
Inc. and Marriott International Inc. cut staff.</TE>
<TE>   "The last 14 weeks of 2001 represented perhaps the most trying and
difficult period in the history of the hotel business," Bollenbach
said. "We're not nearly all the way back, but business travel and
consumer confidence are returning."</TE>
<TE>   The company was expected to break even on a per-share basis,
according to the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson
Financial/First Call. Results for the latest quarter include a
$46-million tax credit.</TE>
<TE>   Hilton shares fell 30 cents to $11.30 on the New York Stock
Exchange, and have gained 70% since Sept. 20, rising along with other
hotel companies' shares as investors anticipate a rebound in hotel
room demand.</TE>
<TE>   Another California company reporting earnings, excluding one-time
gains or charges unless noted:</TE>
<TE>   Idec Pharmaceuticals Corp. said net income rose 41% to $28.7
million, or 16 cents a share from $20.4million, or 12 cents, because
of higher sales of its cancer drug Rituxan. Revenue at the San Diego
company rose 78% to $81.7 million from $45.8 million.</TE>

<HD>IBM CEO to Step Down; He Led Big Blue's Turnaround</HD>
<DH>Executives: Gerstner's departure continues trend of old
guard at top companies making room for boomers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN and STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IBM Corp. leader Louis V. Gerstner Jr., who became an icon of
American business by transforming the once-battered computer maker
into a steadily profitable technology behemoth, said Tuesday that he
would step down as chief executive March 1, his 60th birthday.</LD>
<LD>   The first outsider to lead IBM in eight decades, Gerstner joined
Big Blue in 1993, when it was mired in a bloated bureaucracy that
spoke its own language. Obsessed with selling big computers, the
company was losing billions and facing investor demands that it split
into pieces.</LD>
<LD>   Gerstner casually remarked once while he was an executive at
American Express Co. that he was sure he could find a profit
somewhere at IBM. After assuming the helm at the Armonk, N.Y.-based
firm, Gerstner cut tens of thousands of jobs, demanded that staffers
pay more attention to customers and drove employees toward more
profitable consulting contracts.</LD>
<TE>   "He changed the corporate culture," said Doug Garr, who wrote a
book on the Gerstner turnaround. "He said if we want to survive,
we're going to have to compete against other companies that want to
eat our lunch."</TE>
<TE>   Gerstner's departure is part of a trend at the top of American
businesses as baby boom leaders replace the old guard, such as
Gerstner and General Electric Co.'s Jack Welch, another financially
conservative, results-oriented leader.</TE>
<TE>   In a farewell e-mail to employees Tuesday, Gerstner said that when
he became CEO, he wasn't sure he could turn around the company, let
alone do it in just two or three years.</TE>
<TE>   "All our hard work has brought IBM back," wrote Gerstner, who will
remain as chairman through the year. "Today, our strategies are
correct. Our capacity to innovate is unmatched. Our culture is moving
in the right direction. And we have restored the pride all of us feel
in this company."</TE>
<TE>   Like most everything else he did, Gerstner picked his successor in
a methodical way. He will be replaced by Chief Operating Officer Sam
Palmisano, 50, who has run most of IBM's top-performing divisions
during his 29 years at the firm.</TE>
<TE>   IBM didn't say who would succeed Gerstner as chairman next year.
It said Vice Chairman John M. Thompson would retire Sept. 1.
Thompson, 59, built IBM's software business and managed the
acquisitions of Lotus Development Corp. and Tivoli Systems.</TE>
<TE>   Investors would rather have more of Gerstner, who increased IBM's
stock value from less than $25 billion to nearly $180 billion. IBM
shares fell $5.15 on Tuesday to close at $103 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Gerstner was a controversial choice for IBM when he took over in
1993, an outsider to the high-tech industry who knew little about its
dynamics.</TE>
<TE>   "There were real questions raised about whether someone not deep
in technology could lead the turnaround," said David A. Nadler,
chairman of Mercer Delta Consulting, a management advisory firm.</TE>
<TE>   The challenges facing Gerstner were enormous. From 1991 through
1993, the company lost $16 billion, one of the worst setbacks in U.S.
business history. A bankruptcy filing was debated.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a company that had undergone a precipitous fall from
grace," Nadler said. "This was the most admired company and perceived
as the most successful company in the U.S., and then it found itself
facing tremendous problems."</TE>
<TE>   Gerstner created another stir just months after becoming CEO when
he engineered an $8.9-billion write-off and brushed off questions
about his long-term strategy. "The last thing IBM needs right now is
a vision," he was quoted as saying.</TE>
<TE>   He also surprised industry observers by refusing to break up the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Robert D. Austin, an assistant professor at Harvard Business
School who co-wrote a 2000 case study titled "IBM Turnaround," said
Gerstner bucked the conventional wisdom that dividing up the
organization was the only way to save it.</TE>
<TE>   Gerstner instead decided that one of IBM's remaining advantages
was that it could offer customers a broad package of services and
hardware, a path that has been belatedly taken by other computer
firms.</TE>
<TE>   Austin said Gerstner also zeroed in on instilling a customer focus
at a company that had lost touch with its market. Gerstner set the
tone while still fresh in his job, when executives asked whether he
could make a brief visit to a gathering of IBM customers.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of putting in the requested one-hour appearance, Gerstner
stayed for the entire two days of the convention and urged other
company executives to do the same. "They were suddenly all erasing
their calendars and saying, 'Yes, I'm planning to be there both
days,'" Austin said.</TE>
<TE>   Gerstner's aloof manner and job cuts also triggered resentment,
because the company had long resisted layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   But IBM was soon making money again, earning $3 billion in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Gerstner's accomplishments as an executive, Nadler said, put him
among the top five figures in corporate America. "He's the poster
child for the value of general management skills and leadership," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Nadler and Garr called Gerstner's work even more impressive than
Welch's, the much-celebrated former CEO of GE.</TE>
<TE>   While Welch was a GE insider called upon to revitalize a
fundamentally sound company, Gerstner was the rare example of an
outsider who succeeded in transforming a company. "There are many
more failures in that category than successes," Nadler said.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the profitability that was Gerstner's obsession, he
loosened the tie in IBM's stodgy uniform and revived the IBM brand,
even using humor in commercials.</TE>
<TE>   That helped attract offbeat but technically talented workers who
otherwise would have considered only hip companies such as Microsoft
Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. "He sent the message that if you were
a guy with earrings or long hair, you could still work there," said
Garr, a former IBM speech writer.</TE>
<TE>   Gerstner later showed admirable restraint during the Internet
stock bubble. He steered the company to capitalize on the trend by
providing the infrastructure and integration services to firms
expanding on the Web, but didn't invest heavily in dot-coms that went
under or grow to depend on them for sales.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors fault Gerstner for being too conservative in the
last few years, using company money to buy back tens of billions of
dollars in IBM stock and settling for slow sales growth.</TE>
<TE>   "He might have been on cruise control a little bit," Garr said.</TE>
<TE>   But he will be remembered as the man who brought one of America's
biggest companies back from the brink.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Mineola, N.Y., Gerstner was known for his versatility even
before IBM. A Dartmouth College graduate and Harvard MBA, Gerstner
launched his business career in 1965 with the McKinsey &amp; Co.
consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   He left McKinsey for an 11-year stint as a top executive at
American Express and then spent four years as chairman and chief
executive of RJR Nabisco Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Gerstner's turnaround at IBM drew worldwide attention. In June, he
was awarded the title of honorary knight of the British empire by
Queen Elizabeth II.</TE>
<TE>   His major outside interest is education. Gerstner was co-author of
a 1994 book on entrepreneurship in public schools, and he is co-chair
of Achieve, a group of political and business leaders pushing for
education reform.</TE>

<HD>Accounting Woes Pummel Stock Market</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: New controversies shake investors, who begin
to look askance at firms' financial statements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON and JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Growing worries over U.S. companies' accounting practices triggered a
sharp decline on Wall Street on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The plunge of almost 248 points in the Dow Jones industrial
average--the biggest one-day drop since October--pointed up a loss of
faith by investors in both the credibility of company managements and
in the checks and balances of the U.S. financial system that should
be preventing fraud, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Fearing another Enron-like stock collapse, many professional
investors say they have spent the last several weeks scouring
financial statements of companies they own for hints of impropriety.</LD>
<TE>   Their fears bubbled over Tuesday amid new disclosures of
accounting controversies at some companies and rumors of potential
troubles at others.</TE>
<TE>   "People are petrified," said Robert Willens, an accounting expert
at brokerage firm Lehman Bros. in New York. "This is a major, major
crisis in confidence."</TE>
<TE>   The Dow tumbled 247.51 points, or 2.5%, to 9,618.24, its biggest
one-day loss since Oct. 29.</TE>
<TE>   The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index sank 2.9%, its largest
loss since it fell 3.1% on Sept. 20 in the market sell-off that
followed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of just how preoccupied investors are by accounting
issues, the market appeared to ignore the day's upbeat economic news:
Consumer confidence continued its recent steady rise, orders for
durable goods improved and the Treasury Department said the economy
is likely to grow this quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, investors focused on the disclosure of potential problems
at several large companies:</TE>
<TE>   * Energy trader Williams Cos. plummeted 22% after announcing that
it would delay its fourth-quarter earnings report while it reviews
its financial ties to a telecommunications spinoff. The news sparked
concern that the company could face the kind of meltdown that pushed
Enron Corp. into bankruptcy protection in December.</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of Tyco International Ltd. slid 20% after the company
revealed that it had paid one of its board members $20 million for
help in arranging a merger. Interlocking relationships between
companies and their directors have received heavy scrutiny amid
criticism that Enron's board was handcuffed by various conflicts of
interest.</TE>
<TE>   * Cendant Corp. shares dropped 10% on rumors about a potentially
negative newspaper article about its accounting.</TE>
<TE>   * PNC Financial Services Group, a Pittsburgh-based banking
company, saw its stock slump 9% after the firm revised its 2001
profit lower after the Federal Reserve questioned the company's
accounting.</TE>
<TE>   "The magnitude of the Enron situation took so many people by
surprise and has had such far-reaching implications that people are
looking at any company whose accounting is not totally
understandable," said Sally Anderson, a money manager at Kopp
Investment Advisors in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The scrutiny marks a sharp reversal from the attitude that
prevailed throughout the 1990s bull market, Anderson said. In that
period, investors often lauded companies for "managing" their
earnings--Wall Street's euphemism for the ability to tweak financial
figures to satisfy quarterly profit expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that whole issue has taken on a nasty taint," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts believe that any company whose earnings of recent
years can be questioned will take steps in coming weeks to be upfront
about their numbers and accounting procedures. In some cases,
companies may voluntarily reveal accounting irregularities before an
outside investor does so, some experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mea culpa [environment]," said Robert Olstein, who manages
the Olstein Financial Alert fund and is a longtime critic of
corporate accounting practices. "Everybody is going to come out now
and admit their earnings were a little aggressive, [saying] 'maybe we
didn't earn as much as we said we did in the last five years.'"</TE>
<TE>   But if doubts about corporate accounting mushroom, they could
become a major weight on the market, some analysts warn. The basic
issue is whether investors can trust corporate managers.</TE>
<TE>   "The real issue is a lack of trust in the management of large U.S.
corporations. Whatever management says, people just don't buy it
anymore," said Steve Colton, manager of the Phoenix-Oakhurst Growth &amp;
Income Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "We own Tyco, and I think it's a tremendously cheap stock if these
earnings estimates are to be believed," he said. "But the attitude
among investors seems to be: 'If the company is so cheap, why don't
you just take it private?'"</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of Enron, some other big-name Chapter 11 bankruptcy
filings--ranging from low-tech Kmart Corp. to high-tech Global
Crossing Ltd.--also are rattling investors' nerves, he said.</TE>
<TE>   And with once-acquisitive companies such as Williams taking huge
write-offs against past earnings, it raises doubts about the
strategic mergers and other ambitious plans many managements have
undertaken in recent years, analysts say. For example, drug giant
Merck &amp; Co.'s plan to spin off its Medco pharmacy business, a move
announced Tuesday, calls into question the success of that 1993
acquisition, Colton said.</TE>
<TE>   "Short sellers" may have contributed to Tuesday's sell-off, Colton
said. He said some short sellers--who borrow stock and sell it,
betting on a price decline--were spreading rumors that telecom giant
WorldCom Group Inc. faces a debt-rating downgrade.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding the market's troubles is that the post-attacks rally
lifted prices so far so fast, with the S&amp;P gaining about 20% and the
Nasdaq composite index surging about 40% in 2 1/2 months. That left
many stocks selling for steep valuations relative to earnings, and
many investors wary about what upside might be left.</TE>

<HD>Judge Bars Media From Microsoft Case Depositions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. won a court order Tuesday barring reporters when
Chief Executive Steve Ballmer and others are questioned about
proposals for tougher antitrust remedies by nine states opposing a
proposed settlement.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled that, because the
Justice Department had reached a tentative settlement of its case
against Microsoft and was no longer a plaintiff, a 1913 law allowing
news media at the depositions no longer applies.</LD>
<LD>   The law mandates public depositions only in Sherman Antitrust Act
cases brought by the Justice Department, she said.</LD>
<TE>   Microsoft asked the judge to lift a 1998 court order won by news
organizations that allowed reporters and the public to attend
questioning of witnesses before the 78-day trial of the government's
lawsuit that ended in June 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "The court can think of no rational basis for the application" of
the Publicity in Taking Evidence Act "to the depositions to be taken
by the non-settling states," Kollar-Kotelly wrote in an opinion made
public Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Ballmer is likely to be questioned by the dissenting states
because the company listed him as a possible witness in court
hearings set to begin March 11 on the proposed restrictions on
Microsoft's business practices.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Levine, a lawyer representing the news organizations, said he
hasn't seen the order and declined to say whether there will be an
appeal. The nine states didn't oppose Microsoft's request to hold the
questioning in private.</TE>
<TE>   The depositions were set to begin Tuesday as Microsoft and the
states began preparing for the hearings. Lawyers in the case conduct
the depositions outside the presence of the judge. Witnesses are
questioned under oath in preparation for their appearance in court
before the judge.</TE>
<TE>   Nine other states have joined the Justice Department in supporting
the settlement, requiring that Microsoft give computer makers more
freedom to promote programs that compete with products offered by the
No. 1 software company.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares fell $1.50 to $62.32 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Coca-Cola Matches Estimates</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Results meet reduced figures for 2001. Declining
currencies are likely to hurt '02 profit.</DH>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coca-Cola Co., the largest soft-drink maker, said that 2001 volume
sales matched the low end of its reduced forecast and that profit
this year would be hurt by falling currencies, including the
devaluation of the Argentine peso.</LD>
<LD>   Net income in the fourth quarter rose to $914 million, or 37 cents
a share, from $242 million, or 10 cents, a year earlier, when
one-time charges depressed results, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   Fourth-quarter profit matched the average estimate of analysts
polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<TE>   Coca-Cola is struggling to revive soft-drink demand in North
America amid stiff competition from PepsiCo Inc. PepsiCo has moved
more quickly than Coke to gain a footing in the fast-growing market
for non-carbonated beverages. The company met the low end of Chief
Executive Doug Daft's 2001 sales growth forecast of 4% to 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Coca-Cola, which gets about three-fourths of its earnings from
outside the U.S., said profit this year will be reduced by as much as
10 cents a share from declining currencies against the dollar.
Excluding the currency impact, Coca-Cola said per-share earnings will
rise within its "long-term expectations" of 11% to 12%.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue in the fourth quarter rose 4% to $4.92 billion. Sales of
non-carbonated beverages, which generate more than 13% of Coke's
business, rose 22% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Coke shares fell $1.21 to $44 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other company earnings, excluding one-time gains and charges
unless noted:</TE>
<TE>   * AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. had a fourth-quarter loss on higher
operating expenses and investment losses. The loss from continuing
operations was $355 million, or 14 cents a share, contrasted with a
profit of $488 million, or 18 cents, in the year-earlier quarter.
Analysts expected a smaller loss of 6 cents. Sales rose 19% to $3.53
billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Barr Laboratories Inc. said its fiscal second-quarter profit
more than doubled on sales of its generic version of the
antidepressant Prozac and products acquired in its purchase of
Duramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. Net income for the quarter ended Dec. 31
rose to $42.1million, or 91 cents a share, from $16.8million, or 38
cents, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 146% to $366.1million.</TE>
<TE>   * CNet Networks Inc. reported an operating loss of $13.4 million,
or 10 cents, for its fiscal fourth quarter, compared with profit of
$13.2 million, or 9 cents, a year ago, as sales fell 37% to $70.2
million. Analysts expected a loss of 12 cents. CNet also lowered
expectations for revenue for the first quarter and full year 2002.</TE>
<TE>   * Exelon Corp., the largest U.S. nuclear generator, reported
fourth-quarter earnings of $338 million, or $1.05 a share, down from
$46 million, or 16 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue
rose to $3.38 billion from $3.13 billion a year earlier. The company
said it will cut 3,400 jobs, or 15% of its work force, by the end of
2002. The cuts are related to the company's formation last year when
the parent of Philadelphia Electric Co. acquired Chicago's
Commonwealth Edison in October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   * FleetBoston Financial Corp. posted a fourth-quarter loss of
$507million, or 49 cents per share, largely due to a $1.19-billion,
or $1.14 per share, Argentina-related write-down. In the year-ago
period, Fleet had profit of $894million, or 81 cents per share.</TE>
<TE>   * Honeywell International Inc. said fourth-quarter profit fell 54%
to $118 million, or 14 cents a share because of costs to settle a
patent-infringement lawsuit with Northrop Grumman Corp. and lower
sales. Sales fell 9.3% to $5.85 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Kellogg Co. said fourth-quarter profit rose 34% to $124.6
million, or 31 cents a share, as its 2001 purchase of Keebler Foods
Co. led to greater-than-expected savings and it sold more cereal in
the U.S. Sales rose 42% to $2.21 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Newport Corp., the Irvine technology equipment maker, said net
income fell 99% to $103,000, or nil cents a share, for the fourth
quarter, from $15.7 million, or 41 cents a share, a year ago. Sales
fell 48% to $50.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Pulte Homes Inc., the largest U.S. homebuilder, said
fourth-quarter net income rose 39% to $119.4million, or $1.98 a
share. Pulte said revenue rose 44% to $2billion. The company
predicted relatively flat first-quarter earnings.</TE>
<TE>   * Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. had its first loss as a public
company in the fourth quarter as it slashed prices to attract
vacationers. Royal, which is being acquired by P&amp;O Princess Cruises
for $7.4 billion, had a loss of $39 million, or 20 cents a share,
contrasted with net income of $30 million, or 16 cents, a year
earlier. Revenue rose 2.2% to $656 million.</TE>
<TE>   * United Parcel Service Inc. said its fourth-quarter earnings fell
11% to $645 million, or 57 cents a share, as the largest
package-delivery company moved fewer goods in a recession. Sales rose
2.4% to $8.09 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * U.S. Steel Corp. said its fourth-quarter loss widened as steel
prices fell. The company said its net loss widened to $174 million,
or $1.95 a share, from $139 million, or $1.57, a year earlier. Sales
rose slightly to $1.41 billion.</TE>

<HD>3 Oil Companies Record Losses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ChevronTexaco Corp., Marathon Oil Corp. and Unocal Corp. had
fourth-quarter losses because the prices of oil and natural gas
tumbled. ChevronTexaco also had merger costs and wrote down assets.</LD>
<LD>   ChevronTexaco, the No. 2 U.S. oil company created by Chevron
Corp.'s $45.8-billion purchase of Texaco Inc., posted a loss of
$2.52billion, or $2.36 a share, contrasted with net income of
$2.04billion, or $1.92, in the year-earlier period.</LD>
<LD>   Marathon said its loss almost tripled to $898 million, or $2.90 a
share.</LD>
<TE>   Unocal posted a loss of $29million, or 12 cents a share,
contrasted with net income of $173million, or 70 cents, a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. oil prices fell 36% in the period from a year earlier and gas
prices dropped 59% as the country endured its third quarter of
recession. Exxon Mobil Corp., the No.1 publicly traded oil company,
and Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co., whose merger will
displace Marathon as the No.3 oil company in the U.S., last week
posted a drop in fourth-quarter earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just pricing," said Alan Meyers, who manages $800 million,
including oil stocks, in the Fifth Third Large Cap Value Fund. "Oil
is the commodity and until you get the demand back up, you're not
going to see stable pricing. It may well take economic recovery to do
that."</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo-based Unocal reduced its forecast for first-quarter and
full-year earnings because of lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco dropped $3.70 to close
at $85.17 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Marathon, based
in Houston, fell 60 cents to close at $27.40, and Unocal shares
dipped 7cents to $34 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   ChevronTexaco said revenue fell by a third to $21.5 billion from
$32.3 billion. The year-earlier figures are based on the combined
results of the separate companies.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it wrote down the value of oil- and gas-producing
properties by $1.4 billion because prices fell. It also had
write-offs of $452 million for assets in its chemical unit and
properties that it considers unprofitable to develop.</TE>
<TE>   Merger expenses of $1.17 billion included $700 million for job
cuts and $300 million for office closings and relocations.</TE>
<TE>   Without those items, ChevronTexaco said, earnings would have been
$498 million, or 47 cents a share. On that basis, the company was
forecast to earn 90 cents a share, the average estimate of analysts
polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   "We made some difficult decisions on investment priorities for the
combined asset portfolio following the merger," said Chief Executive
David O'Reilly. "Many of these investment and operating decisions had
unfavorable impacts on fourth-quarter earnings."</TE>
<TE>   Profit from producing oil and natural gas plunged 73% to
$544million in the quarter from $2.05billion, the company said.
Income from refining, marketing and transportation fell 57% to
$215million from $498 million. The company said the amount it made on
each barrel of oil it refined fell 45% to $24.25 a barrel.</TE>

<HD>Palmisano May Modify Style, Not Strategy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN and JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Sam Palmisano succeeds Louis Gerstner as chief executive of IBM
Corp. on March 1, the substance of the company's strategy isn't
expected to change much. But Big Blue's style is likely to get a
make-over.</LD>
<LD>   A baby boomer who joined IBM's sales team after earning a history
degree at Johns Hopkins University in 1973, Palmisano has risen
steadily through the ranks without embracing the button-down
formality that once characterized the company.</LD>
<LD>   Widely described as personable and down to earth, Palmisano
declined when the company offered him an executive assistant,
according to "IBM Redux," a book by former IBM speech writer Doug
Garr.</LD>
<TE>   "He didn't need someone to pack his underwear for a business
trip," Garr wrote. "He was a quintessential regular guy."</TE>
<TE>   He snaps pencils when meetings drone on. He shuns posh retreats
meant to serve as corporate pep rallies, believing them to be a waste
of money.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the 6-foot-2 Palmisano prefers to approach sales meetings
the way he did when he served as captain of the Johns Hopkins
football team.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech urging IBM storage sales executives to outsell former
colleagues who were now at rival EMC Corp., Palmisano barked: "I'm
tired of seeing us get sand kicked in our face by ex-IBMers."</TE>
<TE>   The son of an auto repairman in Baltimore, Palmisano, 50, has a
history of bringing fresh ideas to the company at which he has worked
for 29 years.</TE>
<TE>   When he ran IBM's PC division, he spearheaded the move to sell
computers over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   He is one of the company's strongest advocates of Linux, the free
computer operating system that is making inroads against proprietary
systems such as Microsoft Corp.'s Windows.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Palmisano is a consummate insider. He has run many of IBM's
most important divisions, including the personal computer group and
the server group.</TE>
<TE>   Palmisano jump-started the company's highly profitable services
arm, boosting an outsourcing subsidiary called Integrated Systems
Solutions and turning its money-losing consulting and systems
integration business into a profitable venture.</TE>
<TE>   The two divisions later became IBM's Global Services group, which
is now a $32.2-billion-a-year business.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an exceptional leader, passionate about our business,
committed to our principles and values and steeped in the disciplines
that are critical to our success," Gerstner wrote to employees
Tuesday. "Beyond those critical qualities, Sam bleeds Blue."</TE>
<TE>   "He has been involved for at least the last nine to 12 months in
most of the major business decisions, and he's been involved in every
major business unit with the exception of software," said analyst
John Jones of Salomon Smith Barney.</TE>
<TE>   If Gerstner was the jolt from outside that IBM badly needed in the
early 1990s, associates say Palmisano is a steady, experienced hand
more appropriate for Big Blue today.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest task facing Palmisano is revving IBM's slowing sales
growth.</TE>
<TE>   Needing more work are IBM's big hardware divisions, which make
servers for running computer networks and gear for storing data. But
he will have to do so without trying to fix what isn't broken.</TE>
<TE>   "He has to make sure that he doesn't overly influence the healthy
segments and spends his energy on where the real challenges are,"
Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   "Services are in good shape, software is in good shape, and
semiconductors are in good shape."</TE>
<TE>   Some people who have worked with Palmisano say he might have been
better suited for the chief executive position if he had spent some
time running another company.</TE>
<TE>   But he has other strengths that Gerstner lacks, including an
easier style with people.</TE>
<TE>   "People actually like Sam. He's a great salesman, and he's got a
great Rolodex," Garr, the former IBM speech writer, said.</TE>
<TE>   "He can walk into any CEO's office and say, 'I want you to revisit
your [information technology] budget,' and it will happen."</TE>

<LD>Conseco Inc. will sell assets and take other steps to raise as much
as $800 million and meet payments on $1.25 billion of debt maturing
this year.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Gary Wendt said in a memo to shareholders that the
finance and insurance company will sell its variable annuities unit,
some of its loan holdings and other assets to raise cash, and will
seek a partner for its manufactured housing floor-plan business.</LD>
<LD>   Conseco also will buy back bonds at a discount, tap a credit line
at its finance unit and free capital that can be used for debt
payments by reinsuring parts of its supplemental health and life
insurance lines.</LD>

<LD>A privacy group asked state law enforcement authorities to examine
Microsoft Corp.'s Passport online identity service, saying it exposes
consumers to fraud, junk electronic mail and identity theft.</LD>
<LD>   The Electronic Privacy Information Center sent a letter to all 50
state attorneys general, asking them to protect consumers against
what it called Microsoft's unfair and deceptive trade practices.</LD>
<LD>   Launched in 1999, Passport aims to simplify Internet transactions
by allowing consumers to store passwords, credit card numbers and
other personal information in one location.</LD>
<TE>   The Electronic Privacy Information Center and other privacy groups
say the service allows Microsoft to track and profile Internet users,
encourages junk e-mail and exposes consumers to identity theft by
inadequately protecting their credit card numbers.</TE>
<TE>   A Microsoft spokesman denied the allegations.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fox News Channel marked a milestone in its five-year history, topping
rival CNN in viewership during a one-month period for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   Fox, which went on the air Oct. 7, 1996, beat a network that had a
virtual monopoly in cable news for 15 years, despite the fact that
Fox is available in fewer homes. Cable news viewership in general is
up over last year at this time. CNN, Fox and MSNBC have held on to
some of the audience that tuned in after the Sept. 11 attacks. During
January, Fox averaged 656,000 viewers while CNN had 596,000 viewers,
according to Nielsen Media Research. MSNBC had 296,000 viewers. In
Nielsen's cable measurements, a month ends on its last Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   In prime time, Fox averaged 1.1 million viewers, CNN was at
921,000 and MSNBC had 358,000. Fox beat CNN during two months last
year in prime time, but by smaller margins. And it has never won in
Nielsen's 24-hour average.</LD>

<HD>Merck to Sell Part of Medco Unit to Public</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Merck &amp; Co. plans to sell part of its Medco pharmacy business to the
public as the second-biggest U.S. pharmaceutical company concentrates
on higher-margin prescription drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts estimate all of Medco could sell for $6 billion to
$15billion. Merck paid $6 billion in 1993 for the pharmacy business,
which acts as a middleman between drug makers and health-care
insurance plans.</LD>
<LD>   Merck yielded to shareholder pressure to sell Medco years after
Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and GlaxoSmithKline sold similar units, analysts
said. Merck said last month it didn't expect profit to grow in 2002
because of competition from generic drugs and lower-than-expected
sales of its Vioxx painkiller. The share offering may help Merck fund
acquisitions to restart that growth.</LD>
<TE>   Merck shares rose 52 cents to close at $57.52 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Toshiba, Fujitsu Widen Loss Forecasts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toshiba Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. widened their full-year loss forecasts
and slashed targets for sales of personal computers, prompting calls
for them to carry out thousands of job cuts earlier than planned.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Hitachi Ltd. said it expects a loss of about
$2.25billion for the year ending March 31, worse than the
$1.73-billion loss previously forecast, and said it plans to cut
4,000 more jobs. Hitachi, Japan's third-largest chip maker, already
had announced plans to cut 16,000 jobs.</LD>
<LD>   Toshiba said it may have a loss in the year ending March 31 of $2
billion, compared with the $1.5-billion loss expected earlier.
Fujitsu, the third-biggest maker of mobile-phone memory chips and
Japan's largest computer maker, changed its forecast to a loss of
$2.8 billion, from the $2.3billion projected earlier.</LD>
<TE>   The companies have been squeezed by lower chip prices and weaker
sales of personal computers, cell phones and other electronic gear.
Investors say Japanese chip makers, which once dominated the
memory-chip market, were slow to shed workers, farm out production
and reorganize.</TE>
<TE>   Toshiba reiterated it will cut 18,800 jobs, or 10% of its work
force, by March 2004. Fujitsu has promised to cut 21,900 jobs, or 12%
of its total staff, this fiscal year, and scale back its unprofitable
semiconductor business.</TE>
<TE>   In over-the-counter trading, shares of Toshiba fell 17 cents to
$3.15 and Fujitsu rose 15 cents to $32.65. On the NYSE, shares of
Hitachi fell $2.71 to $63.40.</TE>

<LD>PNC Financial Services Group reduced 2001 net income by about $155
million after the Federal Reserve forced it to restate its earnings.</LD>
<LD>   The bank, which for a year has been reducing the bad loans on its
books by selling them to investors, set up firms with an insurer last
year designed to buy its loans and sell them over time. The Federal
Reserve told PNC in recent weeks that the companies weren't accounted
for properly.</LD>
<LD>   PNC shares fell $5.79, or 9.4%, to $56.08 on the NYSE.</LD>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve told PNC to consolidate the accounting for
three subsidiaries to comply with generally accepted accounting
principles, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   That differed from the advice of PNC's auditors, Ernst &amp; Young,
the company said. The bank said it is cooperating with inquiries by
the Fed, which regulates banks, and the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Los Angeles firms and individuals raised at least $170 million
from 1,000 investors through the fraudulent sale of promissory notes
promising a 20% return every three months, regulators charged.</LD>
<LD>   J.T. Wallenbrock &amp; Associates, Larry Toshio Osaki, Van. Y.
Ichinotsubo and Citadel Capital Management Group Inc., had their
assets frozen Monday by a federal judge, who ordered them to make a
full accounting of what they did with investors' dollars, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said.</LD>
<LD>   The defendants neither admitted nor denied the charges leveled by
the SEC, which also won a temporary restraining order and is seeking
preliminary and permanent injunctions, the agency said.</LD>
<TE>   "The company reached an agreement yesterday with the SEC in its
efforts to address the concerns raised by the agency," said
Wallenbrock attorney Stephen Mansfield, with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer
&amp; Feld in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A promissory note is a written pledge to pay or repay a specified
sum of money at a stated time with interest added. When done
legitimately, it's essentially a loan, said Robert Burson, senior
associate director of the SEC's Midwest regional office.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, the defendants told investors that the proceeds of
the notes would be used by Wallenbrock to purchase receivables of
Malaysian latex glove manufacturers for 70% to 80% of the balance due
on the receivables, the SEC said. When the accounts receivable are
collected, investors receive a 20% return on their investment, the
firms claim, according to the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The federal court in Los Angeles will hear the SEC's motion April
1.</TE>

<LD>A prominent Chicago insurance executive who launched one of
Hollywood's main companies providing bonds that protect film
financers when movies go seriously over budget or are late, has been
charged with mail fraud and insurance fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Segal, president of Near North Insurance, was accused
Monday in federal court in Chicago of embezzling millions of dollars
in insurance premiums from a trust fund Illinois requires brokers to
maintain, according to the Chicago Tribune. Segal's lawyer, Harvey
Silets, called the charges specious.</LD>
<LD>   Segal founded International Film Guarantors in 1991 as a joint
venture with insurance giant Fireman's Fund.</LD>
<TE>   Completion bond companies provide a safety net for lenders and
financiers by guaranteeing that they will step in if a movie goes
seriously over budget, is late or isn't delivered in the shape that
was agreed to.</TE>

<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc., Sony Corp. and three other film studios
appointed Jim Ramo, a former Hughes Electronics Corp. official, chief
executive of their joint service to deliver movies over the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles-based venture, which includes Viacom Inc., Vivendi
Universal and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., also changed the name of its
service to Movielink from Moviefly, the companies said. Announced
Aug. 16, the planned service will offer Web users access to recent
movie releases as well as film libraries.</LD>
<LD>   Movielink will compete with a similar venture formed by Walt
Disney Co. and News Corp. called Movies.com.</LD>
<TE>   The film studios are trying to tap into a market for video on
demand that's expected to rise to almost $2 billion by 2005 from
$65million last year, according to research firm Yankee Group.</TE>
<TE>   "DirecTV wasn't born overnight, and this business won't be
something that jumps overnight," Ramo said in an interview, referring
to the Hughes satellite-television unit at which he was executive
vice president from 1990 to 1997. "It's very much of a long-term
development, a long-term business plan."</TE>
<TE>   Ramo said he expects the service to start sometime in the second
half of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Ramo was most recently at Shelter Ventures, consulting for
communications companies and investing in new media for the
$200-million fund, the statement said. After leaving DirecTV in 1997,
he was chief operating officer of TVN Entertainment and CEO of
Geocast Network Systems until 2000.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, AOL Time Warner shares fell $1.20,
or 4.3%, to $26.70; MGM slipped 50 cents to $19.62, and Viacom's
Class B shares fell 40 cents to $39.25. Also on the NYSE, Sony's
American depositary receipts dropped $1.50 to close at $43.70, and
Vivendi's ADRs fell 74 cents to $45.57.</TE>

<HD>Financial Stocks Fall, Pull Down Markets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Financial services stocks were among the biggest losers Tuesday, as a
rising tide of concern over accounting practices drove Wall Street to
one of its worst days since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   A Standard &amp; Poor's index of 17 major financial services stocks
fell 4.9% as Citigroup lost $2.60 to $46.71, J.P. Morgan Chase fell
$2.26 to $32.05 and Merrill Lynch lost $3.96 to $49.</LD>
<LD>   The financial sector contributed most of the drop in the S&amp;P 500
index, which fell 32.42 points, or 2.9%, to 1,100.64--its biggest
one-day loss since the first week of trading after the terrorist
attacks. The S&amp;P now is at its lowest level since Nov. 2.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow industrials fell 247.51 points, or 2.5%, to 9,618.24, the
biggest decline since late October. The Nasdaq composite index lost
50.92 points, or 2.6%, to 1,892.99.</TE>
<TE>   More than two stocks fell for every one that rose on Nasdaq and
the New York Stock Exchange. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, yields on long-term Treasury bonds dropped sharply as
investors fled the stock market for the security of government debt,
and as traders bet that the Federal Reserve will keep short-term
interest rates low for the time being. The yield on the benchmark
10-year Treasury note fell to 4.94% from Monday's close of 5.07%.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed, which began a policy meeting in Washington Tuesday, is
expected today to announce it is leaving its benchmark rate unchanged
at 1.75%, a 40-year low.</TE>
<TE>   But the Fed meeting took a backseat Tuesday to worries over the
way corporations report their earnings--fears that have been growing
since Enron's bankruptcy filing. Tyco International, PNC Financial
Services, Cendant and Williams all fell on worries the companies face
accounting controversies.</TE>
<TE>   "Today is a day when the market is greatly driven by fear--fear of
exposure to bankruptcy or to accounting irregularities," David Katz,
fund manager at Matrix Asset Advisors, told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of financial services firms--which include banks and
brokerages--fell on worries that investors will trade less if the
market continues to fall, analysts said. An ongoing decline also
would make it less attractive for companies to sell new securities, a
big source of revenue for investment banks.</TE>
<TE>   Among banks, Bank of America lost $4.44 to $59.20 and Wells Fargo
slid $1.43 to $45.72.</TE>
<TE>   The dive by stocks overshadowed reports showing that consumer
confidence rose for the second straight month and orders for durable
goods rebounded in December, providing hope that a rise in capital
spending will spur economic growth in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's sell-off also brought the S&amp;P 500's year-to-date loss to
4.1%. With only two trading days left in January, it is becoming more
likely that the benchmark index will show a loss for the month. That
would be considered significant by adherents to the so-called January
barometer, which decrees that the market's performance in January is
usually an indicator of how it will fare for the full year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * IBM was a drag on the Dow, falling $5.15 to $103 after it said
Louis V. Gerstner Jr. will step down as chief executive March 1.</TE>
<TE>   * Oil stocks sank as crude oil fell for the first time in seven
sessions. Exxon Mobil fell $1.01 to $37.95. ChevronTexaco slid $3.70
to $85.17 after reporting a fourth-quarter loss.</TE>
<TE>   * American International Group dropped $3.83 to $72.84. Chairman
Maurice ''Hank'' Greenberg said the company would face fourth-quarter
write-offs related to Enron securities, but he said they are "nothing
significant."</TE>

<HD>TrizecHahn Reduces Value of Hollywood &amp; Highland Project</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Firm's $217-million write-down on complex is
one of the largest in memory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hit with substantial cost overruns and a sluggish economy, TrizecHahn
Corp. on Tuesday reduced the value of its recently opened Hollywood &amp;
Highland retail and hotel project by $217 million in one of Southern
California's costliest real estate drubbings.</LD>
<LD>   The write-down reflects a 40% reduction in the value of the giant
complex in the heart of Hollywood. The Canadian real estate firm also
said it would reduce the value of its poorly performing Las Vegas
shopping center, Desert Passage, and several of its European retail
properties for a total write-down of $287million, which would be
reflected in its 2002 year-end earnings statement.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the size of the write-downs, Wall Street analysts
applauded the move as part of the company's efforts to sell its
retail properties, including Hollywood &amp; Highland, and focus on its
more stable office portfolio. On the New York Stock Exchange,
TrizecHahn shares fell 1 cent to close at $16.70.</LD>
<TE>   Local real estate observers said the $217-million write-down
TrizecHahn took on Hollywood &amp; Highland ranks as one of the largest
losses on a single piece of commercial property in recent memory.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think it is a great idea, but it's one of those projects
that just got out of control," said real estate developer Timothy
Walker at Los Angeles-based MaguirePartners.</TE>
<TE>   Some real estate investors suffered huge losses during the real
estate bust of the early 1990s, said USC real estate professor David
Dale Johnson, "but I don't recollect any of them on that order."</TE>
<TE>   The 500,000-square-foot project at the northwest corner of
Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue has been hailed by civic and
business leaders for generating development and boosting the momentum
of Hollywood's revival.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did Hollywood &amp; Highland project suffer cost overruns and
delays, but the project also opened last fall amid a recession and a
steep drop in tourism after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the things that could have gone wrong did," said Steve
Sakwa, a real estate industry analyst for Merrill Lynch Global
Securities.</TE>
<TE>   On its books, TrizecHahn had valued Hollywood &amp; Highland, which
includes a 637-room hotel and a 3,500-seat theater, at $540million,
but an independent appraisal firm trimmed that amount to $323
million.</TE>
<TE>   Company spokesman Rick Matthews said most of the reduction
reflected cost overruns related to construction of the parking
garage, the Kodak Theatre, which is the permanent home of the Academy
Awards ceremony beginning this year, and other construction-related
delays. Matthews declined to provide additional details about cost
overruns.</TE>
<TE>   Matthews said Hollywood &amp; Highland's financial performance had
"been very promising" and that conditions were expected to continue
to improve after the opening of more restaurants and the Academy
Awards telecast in March.</TE>
<TE>   He said the firm planned to sell the project by 2004. "We
absolutely have no intention of [holding] a fire sale," he said.</TE>

<HD>Tyco Stock Drops on Payment News</HD>
<DH>Conglomerates: Already-jittery investors see
conflict-of-interest questions in a large fee paid to a director for
help with an acquisition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>EXETER, N.H.</DL>
<LD>Shares of Tyco International Ltd., battered for weeks on recurring
rumors that the company has used aggressive accounting, Tuesday
suffered a new blow with revelations that a director received $20
million for helping the conglomerate make a major acquisition last
year.</LD>
<LD>   The stock dived $8.35, or 20%, to $33.65 on the New York Stock
Exchange, adding to steep losses in recent weeks. The price is at its
lowest since 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco paid director Frank E. Walsh Jr. $10 million and contributed
$10 million to the Community Foundation of New Jersey, a charity of
which Walsh is trustee, in exchange for his help in purchasing CIT
Group Inc. last year, according to a filing Monday with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<TE>   Some analysts said the payment raises questions about conflicts of
interest on Tyco's board as Chief Executive Dennis Kozlowski prepares
to break up the company.</TE>
<TE>   The company last week surprised Wall Street with the breakup
announcement.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said part of Kozlowski's motivation in splitting the firm
into four independent business units was to do away with talk that
the company had used aggressive accounting to boost its earnings in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The news about the director's fee "is just one more thing that
increasingly has people saying, 'The heck with this, I'm going to
move on,'" said John Waterman, a money manager at Rittenhouse
Financial, which owns about 13 million Tyco shares. He said he isn't
selling his shares, however.</TE>
<TE>   "The fee was paid to Mr. Walsh because he was instrumental in
bringing about Tyco's $9.2 billion acquisition last year of CIT,"
Kozlowski said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "The board felt that fee was appropriate in light of Mr. Walsh's
efforts."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the board unanimously approved the purchase, the
payment still raises conflict-of-interest questions, corporate
governance experts said.</TE>

<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USA Networks Inc., Barry Diller's media and electronic-retailing
company, Tuesday reported a wider fourth-quarter loss as advertising
sales declined at the company's cable television networks.</LD>
<LD>   The company lost $49.4 million, or 13 cents a share, compared with
a $32.9-million loss, or 9 cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Based largely on the success of USA's online retailing operations,
revenue at the New York-based company was $1.35 billion.</LD>
<TE>   "The ad market is exactly the way it was before, which is not
good," said Diller, chairman of USA Networks.</TE>
<TE>   In late December, USA Networks agreed to sell its entertainment
assets--USA Network and the Sci-Fi Channel, as well as the company's
television and film-production units--to Vivendi Universal for about
$10.3 billion. Diller will be chief executive of Vivendi Universal
Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   After the Vivendi Universal deal closes, USA Networks will be
renamed USA Interactive and will include USA's online businesses,
such as Ticketmaster Inc., Match .com and Citysearch Web sites. USA
Networks also has agreed to buy travel service Expedia Inc.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest quarter, USA's entertainment unit, with TV shows
such as "Law &amp; Order," films such as "Gosford Park" and USA Network
TV channel, suffered a 15% drop in revenue to $357 million.</TE>
<TE>   Cash flow from the interactive division was $120.3 million, up 33%
from the year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   "The fourth-quarter numbers were strong," said SG Cowen analyst
Peter Mirsky. "Perhaps more importantly [the results] went a long way
[toward] validating his travel strategy, for which they got slammed
earlier."</TE>
<TE>   USA Networks shares gained $1.56 to close at $29.20 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Viacom's Top Execs to Face Off Before Board</HD>
<DH>Media: Sources say meeting was called to resolve the
Redstone- Karmazin clash at the entertainment giant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The well-publicized clash of egos at the top of Viacom Inc. could
come to a head today at a meeting of the board of directors in New
York and set the stage for the departure of company's No. 2 executive
Mel Karmazin, according to several sources close to the situation.</LD>
<LD>   The board hopes to resolve a standoff between Viacom Chairman and
Chief Executive Sumner Redstone and his chief operating officer,
Karmazin. In recent months numerous news reports have detailed
clashes in management style of the two celebrated executives. The
disputes have created anxiety within top management and on Wall
Street, helping drive down the stock of the world's second-largest
entertainment company by 11% this year.</LD>
<LD>   Some executives and investors were bracing Tuesday for a boardroom
showdown, predicting that Redstone would force out Karmazin, the
former chief executive of CBS Corp. who joined Viacom after the
companies merged in May 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Although Karmazin, 58, is a favorite on Wall Street because of his
focus on profit and his tough-minded style, Redstone owns 68% of
Viacom's voting stock, relishes the limelight and is eager to resume
the controls he ceded after the merger, said sources close to the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Redstone, 78, built Viacom over the last 15 years from a small
theater chain into a sprawling media company with holdings that
include CBS and UPN television networks, Showtime and MTV cable
channels, Paramount Pictures and Blockbuster video.</TE>
<TE>   But Redstone has bristled under a management arrangement that
gives Karmazin operating control of Viacom, including the ability to
hire and fire executives, until his employment contract expires at
the end of 2003. Redstone can reconfigure Viacom's board and reduce
Karmazin's power in May of next year, on the third anniversary of the
Viacom/CBS merger.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear Tuesday whether the board would vote on Karmazin's
fate. The board may demand that the two executives work out their
differences.</TE>
<TE>   Under the company's bylaws, Redstone cannot fire Karmazin without
the approval of 14 of the board's 18 members. Such a vote could be
difficult to orchestrate because eight of the 18 board members are
CBS appointees.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, money managers have pressured Redstone to patch
relations with Karmazin, worried that Viacom's stock price would drop
dramatically if the former CBS executive left the company.</TE>
<TE>   Other money managers, however, said privately Tuesday that the
management conflict had escalated beyond control, causing Viacom
executives to choose sides, and that the two leaders needed to split
up.</TE>
<TE>   Some Wall Street analysts say it is time to resolve the management
crisis. "It's better if this comes to a head," said Jessica Reif
Cohen, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. "Investors need some certainty."</TE>
<TE>   Viacom spokesman Carl Folta on Tuesday would not comment on the
Redstone-Karmazin feud, but confirmed the board meeting, which he
said was a regularly scheduled one.</TE>
<TE>   However, several sources said this was a special meeting called by
Viacom's board in the aftermath of a front-page article in the Wall
Street Journal last week that focused on the tensions between
Karmazin and Redstone.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall in an interview with The Times, Redstone said he would
not give up his title as CEO to Karmazin, and that there were other
Viacom executives who contributed just as much to the company's
success and were worthy of the job.</TE>
<TE>   In the same interview, Redstone said the company's money-losing
television network, UPN, would not be merged with CBS because the
executives in charge of the fledgling network, Kerry McCluggage and
Jonathan Dolgen, were doing a good job.</TE>
<TE>   But Karmazin was irate at Redstone's comments, sources said, and
within weeks he retaliated by restructuring TV network operations. He
merged UPN with CBS, which prompted McCluggage, one of Redstone's
favorite executives, to leave the company.</TE>

<HD>Williams Shares Hit by the 'Enron Effect'</HD>
<DH>Energy: Wall Street responds negatively to company
statement that its financial obligations are under review.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Williams Cos., a major natural gas production and pipeline company
that has often been compared to Enron Corp., suffered from the "Enron
effect" Tuesday as its stock fell 22% after it announced a delay in
the release of fourth-quarter and year-end earnings.</LD>
<LD>   The delay will allow Williams executives to assess financial
obligations related to the spinoff of its Williams Communications
Group fiber-optic network operation in April. Williams said it might
have more than $2 billion in liability relating to the spinoff.</LD>
<LD>   Investors reacted severely to the Tulsa, Okla.-based company's
disclosure, analysts said, because in the wake of Enron's collapse
they fear hidden problems at firms disclosing contingent liabilities
or complex accounting.</LD>
<TE>   Also, Williams' troubles came a day after Global Crossing Ltd.
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection amid investor anxiety over
the telecommunications business, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   But one analyst, Carl Kirst of Merrill Lynch, put out a research
report Tuesday that said "the current pressure [on Williams] is an
overreaction."</TE>
<TE>   Williams operates a sizable energy-trading business and is an
operator of electric power plants in California. It was seen as
another Enron in better times because of its growth in energy trading
and innovations in communications.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in the 1980s, Williams built a 33,000-mile fiber-optic
network that sold telephone and data transmission services to other
companies.</TE>
<TE>   But in April, the gas pipeline firm spun off Williams
Communications as a separate company, guaranteeing some of the new
firm's debts in order to complete the spinoff.</TE>
<TE>   Until Tuesday, the gas pipeline firm had stated the liability
relating to Williams Communications at zero, saying theoretically
that it wasn't much of a liability. But the communications company
suffered a decline in business last year and now faces possible
downgrade of its credit rating.</TE>
<TE>   That possibility triggers very specific liabilities for Williams
Cos., its chief executive, Steven Malcolm, said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   If Williams Communications' debt rating is downgraded, Malcolm
said, the gas pipeline firm might have to pay almost $1.4 billion in
the communications firm's debt. It also could owe $750 million in the
communications company's leases and $250 million for other expenses.</TE>
<TE>   His firm was delaying report of its quarterly and annual earnings
because of the review of the communications firm's debts and the
uncertainty of Williams Cos.' liability, Malcolm said. The sudden
disclosure of contingent liability, the delay of an earnings report
and the imagined echo of Enron combined to hit Williams shares hard.</TE>
<TE>   Williams stock declined $5.36 to $18.78 on the New York Stock
Exchange. "With the collapse of the telecom sector and panic
enveloping anything remotely connected with Enron, Williams has been
brought into the maelstrom," said Fredric Russell, president of
Fredric E. Russell Investment Management, which owns 95,000 shares of
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously the market is wondering what the ultimate financial
impact will be," Malcolm said. "The worst case is $2.4 billion,
though I don't think that is at all likely to be the case."</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Kirst of Merrill Lynch, however, said in his analysis that
the gas pipeline firm is well-financed and able to meet any of the
contingencies now before it.</TE>
<TE>   "A worst-case funding need would call on $2.15 billion," Kirst
wrote. Williams Cos. could fund that "immediately if [Williams
Communications] went bankrupt tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   If Williams has to issue new shares to finance liabilities, the
"maximum earnings dilution would be limited to 10%," Kirst wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of other energy traders also declined sharply Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Shares, Bonds Fall on Debt Speculation</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The firm is hurt by rumors of write-offs and talk
of a downgrade of its credit rating. S&amp;P denies it's planning action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Group Inc. shares and bonds fell sharply Tuesday on
speculation that the No.2 U.S. long-distance carrier will have to
write off assets when it reports quarterly earnings next week.</LD>
<LD>   Rumors also were rife that major credit rating agencies are poised
to downgrade the company's debt. But Standard &amp; Poor's denied it is
planning such a move.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom's common stock tumbled $1.60, or 13%, to $10.40 on
Nasdaq, the lowest closing price since 1995.</LD>
<TE>   In part, WorldCom suffered as telecom shares in general were lower
in the wake of fiber-optic-network operator Global Crossing Ltd.'s
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts raised questions about potential write-offs of
WorldCom assets.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Egan, managing director of Egan-Jones Ratings Co., predicted
that WorldCom faces "a fair amount of house cleaning" given questions
about asset values at other telecom firms.</TE>
<TE>   He estimated that WorldCom will have to write off part of last
year's $3.7-billion acquisition of Intermedia Communications. The
company's earnings also will suffer because long-distance rates have
continued to fall, Egan said.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on poor fourth-quarter results, they're going to have to
lower their '02 guidance," said Adrian Davies, a portfolio manager at
Federated Investors Management, which owns about $14 million of
WorldCom preferred shares.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom spokesman Brad Burns declined to comment on possible
write-offs.</TE>
<TE>   A month ago, WorldCom said in private meetings with investors that
fourth-quarter and first-quarter results would be weak, without
providing more detail, said Davies, who attended some of those
meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Also weighing on WorldCom on Tuesday was rival Qwest
Communications International's report of a fourth-quarter loss that
was wider than in the year-earlier period. Qwest shares fell 59 cents
to $11.76 on the New York Stock Exchange, nearing the multi-year low
of $11.51 set on Nov. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Worries about WorldCom's health pushed the value of its bonds
lower and their yields higher. The company's bonds maturing in 2031
fell about $26.50 per $1,000 face value, pushing the yield to 8.14%
from 7.91% on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P said the rumor it may downgrade WorldCom debt to junk status
wasn't true. "The rumors are unsubstantiated," said Rosemarie
Kalinowski, an S&amp;P director in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The company's debt currently is rated BBB-plus by S&amp;P and A3 by
Moody's Investors Service, both with a stable outlook.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Klugman, an analyst with Jefferies &amp; Co., said there were
concerns that WorldCom Chief Executive Bernie Ebbers might face a
"margin call" if the company's stock falls below $10, which it did
briefly Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   A margin call requires a brokerage customer who has purchased
stock on credit to deposit money or securities to boost the
collateral in the account. Asked whether Ebbers might face a margin
call, a WorldCom spokesman said: "That's Bernie's personal finances.
We can't speak to that."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of WorldCom MCI, a tracking stock for WorldCom Group's
consumer, small-business and Internet access services unit, fell 89
cents, or 6.1%, to $13.81 on Nasdaq. But the WorldCom MCI shares have
the benefit of being supported by a large dividend: The company's
annualized dividend rate is $2.40 a share, giving the stock a current
yield of 17.4%.</TE>
<TE>   There is no dividend paid on WorldCom Group stock.</TE>

<HD>Fire Kills Dad, 3 Young Sons</HD>
<DH>Blaze: Placentia man tries to save his children, only to be
trapped with them. Woken by her husband, wife survives.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Donald Ybarra raced into the inferno to save his three sons from
their burning home. Outside, his neighbors tried furiously to tame
fast-moving flames with a garden hose. Intense heat beat them all.</LD>
<LD>   In the span of four minutes Monday night, Ybarra and the boys were
dead, his wife was badly burned, and a close-knit Placentia
neighborhood was left to grieve.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, fire investigators used a dog trained to sniff out
accelerants but were unable to determine the origin and cause of the
blaze, which broke out about 9:30 p.m. on a cold night on Joan Way.</LD>
<TE>   The fire killed Ybarra, 39, and sons Brandon, 7, Connor, 4, and
Jacob, 2. The boys' mother, Melodie Ybarra, 36, was treated for
second-degree burns over most of her back.</TE>
<TE>   Melodie Ybarra told neighbors that she and her husband tried to
climb the stairs to their boys' second-floor bedrooms. She was chased
back by flames and ran to a neighbor's home for help.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Ybarra kept going, and never made it out.</TE>
<TE>   "Don laid down his life. He laid down his life to get to his
children," said Father Tim Ramaekers, pastor of St. Joseph's Catholic
Church in Placentia, where the family worshiped. "He is an example of
heroism and love."</TE>
<TE>   Ybarra's body was found in an upstairs bedroom with two of his
children, fire officials said. The third child was found in another
bedroom. The family's golden retriever, Summer Rain, also died. The
deaths rocked the neighborhood where the Ybarras had lived for years,
taking part in Friday night summertime block parties and the annual
Fourth of July celebration, in which children decorated their
bicycles with streamers and rode in a parade.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Ki Tipton said Ybarra, who installed and serviced
electric security gates, was the neighborhood soccer coach.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a big old kid," she said. "He played hockey, soccer with
the kids all the time. He taught my little girl how to play
basketball. They were all about their kids."</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Vista Elementary School, behind the cul-de-sac, is the
community's focal point. Melodie Ybarra was in charge of the school's
yearbook.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a real close street," Scott McMillan said. "There are
kids all up and down the street, all under the age of 10 playing
together all the time. My two kids were always down at their house
playing roller hockey."</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Ybarra was a second-grader at Sierra Vista. His teachers
said he was well-liked and loved to give hugs. Math and science were
his favorite subjects. He adored dinosaurs.</TE>
<TE>   Principal Donna Libutti began calling teachers at 6 a.m., telling
them what had happened. Every parent in Brandon's class was called.
Counselors were made available.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon's teachers talked to his classmates and said to think
about the good things they remembered about him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's OK if your heart is sad," Libutti told them. "It's OK to
cry."</TE>
<TE>   Tipton's husband, Ted, said the pounding on his door came late
Monday evening as he was settling in for the night. Melodie Ybarra
was standing there in her underwear, screaming. Her face was smeared
with soot. Her hair was singed.</TE>
<TE>   "She was completely hysterical," Tipton said. "She said the kids
were still in the house. Don had gone after them but she couldn't get
back in."</TE>
<TE>   Ki Tipton put a robe on Ybarra as Ted Tipton looked at his
neighbor's home. It was engulfed in flames.</TE>
<TE>   But Melodie Ybarra darted back across the street and met a
neighbor who had hopped over a cement wall behind the Ybarra house.
The two pulled out a ladder and hoisted it to the side of the home.
The man tried to climb to the second floor but was turned back by the
heat.</TE>
<TE>   Another neighbor came racing down the street in a car. He used a
towel to sling bricks at the upstairs windows, hoping to provide
Ybarra a way out.</TE>
<TE>   Other neighbors ran around the house shouting Don's name. Still
others pulled out a garden hose and began spraying.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't doing any good," neighbor Scott McMillan said. McMillan
grabbed the ladder, moved it to another part of the house and began
climbing.</TE>
<TE>   "We were shouting to see if anyone could hear us," he said. "The
windows were blowing out of their frames."</TE>
<TE>   McMillan's wife, Marcia, watched from the street. She shouted to
her husband to get away.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought he was a goner," Ted Tipton said of McMillan. "He
really tried, but there was no chance."</TE>
<TE>   By now, Melodie Ybarra was standing in the street, praying with
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "We watched her in horror as she realized what was happening,"
Coley Fisher said. "The fire department was not here long when it was
evident they would not be able to get into the house."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, firefighters got only 15 feet in the house before they too
were driven back by the heat, officials said. Shortly thereafter, the
roof collapsed. It took two hours to extinguish the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   As the fire raged, neighbors watched the windows for signs that
someone was trying to escape.</TE>
<TE>   There were none.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday afternoon, amid the roar of chain saws wielded by cleanup
crews, Ramaekers arrived at what was left of the home to bless the
dead. Outside, family members and friends knelt, their heads bowed in
prayer.</TE>
<TE>   "She's in an absolute state of shock," Ramaekers said of Melodie
Ybarra, a customer service agent for Continental Airlines at John
Wayne Airport.</TE>
<TE>   She was treated and released from Kaiser Permanente Anaheim
Medical Center but will need further care for her burns.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators declined to discuss whether there were functioning
smoke detectors in the house, which was built in 1972. The Ybarras,
who had rented the home for several years, bought the home from her
brother, Michael Marek, last February.</TE>
<TE>   Marek, 44, received a call Monday night telling him of the fire.
As he sped from his Yorba Linda home to Joan Way, he saw a plume of
smoke rising in the moonlit sky.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Please let none of them be hurt,'" Marek said Tuesday
through tears. "When none of the firemen would look me in the eye, I
knew it would be bad."</TE>
<TE>   Marek found his sister at a neighbor's home, burned, her foot
broken.</TE>
<TE>   In her anguish, she wondered whether there was something,
anything, she could have done.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I could have stopped it," she cried to her brother.</TE>
<TE>   "She's lost everything. It's horrible," Marek said. "There were no
better parents. There was no more loving couple. They had the best
life. The best marriage. They had a great family."</TE>

<HD>Flag Policy Voided</HD>
<DH>Freeways: Caltrans must either allow all signs or remove
everything posted, judge rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in San Jose ordered Caltrans on Tuesday to adopt a
consistent policy for removing signs and banners from freeway
property, even if it means taking down the hundreds of American flags
hung in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The preliminary injunction stems from a lawsuit filed by two
Scotts Valley women who charge that the state Department of
Transportation has a policy of removing banners with politically
unpopular messages while allowing flags to fly on overpasses and
bridges.</LD>
<LD>   "Government cannot pick and choose among the viewpoints that can
be expressed," said Nathan Benjamin, an attorney for Cassandra Brown
and Amy Courtney.</LD>
<TE>   In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Ronald M. Whyte said Caltrans
cannot allow the public to hang flags alongside freeways while
barring all other displays on bridges and overpasses.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Caltrans must either remove all banners, flags and
signs from freeway property or draft a policy that permits all such
displays, without regard to the content.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans spokesman Dennis Trujillo said Caltrans will abide by the
ruling and remove all banners and flags. He said it is still
undecided whether the state will continue to fight the lawsuit or
simply adopt new rules.</TE>
<TE>   A court date for the suit has not been set.</TE>
<TE>   The case began in November when Brown and Courtney hung a banner
on a freeway overpass in the Northern California community of Scotts
Valley. The freeway overpass was already adorned with a large
American flag and a banner that read "SCNY" (Santa Cruz Loves New
York) when the women decided to add their 7-by-5-foot banner, which
read: "At What Cost?"</TE>
<TE>   Courtney and Brown have since told reporters they hoped the sign
would spur public debate over the American bombing missions in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after they hung the banner, a Scotts Valley police officer,
responding to a complaint, removed the banner but left the flag and
the "SCNY" sign.</TE>
<TE>   The women hung two more banners on nearby freeway overpasses.
Again, both banners were removed, although no one admitted to taking
them down.</TE>
<TE>   In challenging the removal of the signs, the women learned that
Caltrans prohibits all banners from freeway overpasses and bridges
but allows securely fastened flags.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials defended the policy, saying banners and signs
are banned because they can come loose and create a safety hazard for
speeding traffic. The signs can also be a distraction, causing
drivers to slow or veer to view them, they said.</TE>
<TE>   In court, Caltrans officials argued that state law allows properly
secured American flags to be hung on those same bridges and
overpasses.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge ruled that the law cited by Caltrans attorneys did
not apply to freeway overpasses and bridges. State law says if
properly secured,  the "flag of the United States of America and the
flag of the state of California may be displayed on a sidewalk
located in or abutting on a state highway."</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials reject charges that the policy is intended to
quash dissenting voices. "It was never about content," said Trujillo.
"This was about safety."</TE>
<TE>   Benjamin said Courtney, a sales associate for a local organic farm
and a UC Santa Cruz graduate, and Brown, a Spanish teacher and writer
who participated in the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle,
are not rabble-rousers.</TE>
<TE>   He said the women decided to pursue the lawsuit because the
Caltrans policy was a violation of their constitutional rights of
free speech. "The bottom line is that the judge ruled that the policy
was not neutral and reasonable," he said.</TE>

<HD>Half Measures Won't Stop Molesting by Priests</HD>

<LD>A seminary housekeeper walks in on a priest in bed with a boy.</LD>
<LD>   An altar boy, his father dying of cancer, is repeatedly molested
by a priest entrusted with his care.</LD>
<LD>   It's another web of perversion, blackmail and cover-up, this time
stretching from Southern California to Tucson. And once more, Los
Angeles Cardinal Roger M. Mahony is asked to tell what he knew and
when he knew it.</LD>
<TE>   The bulk of the latest allegations were lodged against the Diocese
of Tucson, which announced a settlement Tuesday and issued a public
apology to 11 victims. Mahony's attorney, John McNicholas, told me
that the Archdiocese of Los Angeles will not have to contribute a
dollar to the multimillion-dollar settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Whether that's true or not, it leaves many questions unanswered.
The cardinal's attorney was no help. "That's for me to know," he
said, "and none of your concern."</TE>
<TE>   Will these guys ever learn that keeping dark secrets is what gets
them into these messes in the first place?</TE>
<TE>   Mahony was sued earlier this month by one of the 10 victims, who
alleged that the archdiocese knew of "several instances" of
molestation at St. John's Seminary in the 1980s and failed to call
the police or help the victims.</TE>
<TE>   I couldn't make up anything this sick or ironic on my best day,
but according to court records, some victims were recruits in the
seminary's "Come and See Program." The program, designed to give
youngsters a sense of the priestly lifestyle, apparently succeeded in
ways not advertised.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, as it turns out, will not have to take the stand in this
case. Like the $5.2-million Orange County molestation case that was
suddenly settled in August on the eve of Mahony's scheduled
deposition, this case was settled within days of Mahony's summons,
sparing him any discomfort his testimony might present.</TE>
<TE>   For those who are scoring at home, Mahony has now been either
directly or indirectly tied to three mega cases in 31/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   There's this one, which was settled for an amount one source put
at eight figures; the Orange County case, which involved multiple
victims and the typical pattern of a known molester being put back in
circulation to molest again; and a 1998 settlement out of Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   In the latter, the Diocese of Stockton was ordered to pay $30
million--the largest amount ever per victim--to two brothers who were
repeatedly molested by a priest in the 1980s. The lawsuit alleged
that the diocese, headed by Mahony for part of the time in question,
did little to end the abuse or assist the victims.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, who later this year will preside over the opening of a
$200-million cathedral that's been called the Taj Mahony, is going to
become the Ken Lay of the Catholic Church if he doesn't watch out.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, even Pope John Paul II acknowledged that
there's trouble in paradise. On the subject of molestation, his
solution was for priests to police each other.</TE>
<TE>   With all due respect, this does not appear to have worked at any
time since the Dark Ages, as far as I know, and there is little
reason to suspect that anything will change. Anything short of honest
reform in the church is an insult to the vast majority of priests,
brothers and nuns who devote their lives to good works.</TE>
<TE>   What the pope needs to say, first of all, is that every single
allegation of molestation must be reported to the police immediately,
not to a panel of preachers. He'd also be wise to acknowledge that
the unnatural vow of celibacy is at the root of most scandals, and
turns seminaries and rectories into breeding grounds for abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Not that I'm holding my breath on any of this.</TE>
<TE>   But for good measure, since the pope seems in the mood to at least
acknowledge the church's dark secrets, this would be a good time to
point out that one of the most homophobic institutions in the world
actually has thousands of gay priests.</TE>
<TE>   There. Out of the closet, just like that.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of silence on all these matters is mammoth and
unconscionable, if not un-Christian, and we need only look at this
latest scandal for an example of what I'm talking about.</TE>
<TE>   Many files in this case are sealed, but a priest familiar with it
tells me the alleged molestation at St. John's, committed by a
visiting priest from Arizona, did not go unnoticed. Boys were brought
to a room in what's known as the Tower, he said, and molested.</TE>
<TE>   Did church officials call the police, as any responsible citizen
should have? Of course not.</TE>
<TE>   "He was declared persona non grata," says my source, and St.
John's notified church officials in Arizona that he was someone to
keep an eye on.</TE>
<TE>   Keep an eye on? He belonged in jail, or at the very least, he
should have been defrocked. Instead, he went back to Arizona,
molested again, and allegedly blackmailed a superior. If they came
after him, he warned, he'd spill the beans on an Arizona bishop who
shared some of the same fetishes.</TE>
<TE>   Monday night, I spoke to one of the seminarian's victims. The
former altar boy says he was molested over several years in Arizona
and San Diego. His father was dying of cancer, his mother was broke,
and she often left him with the priest when she went to care for her
dying husband.</TE>
<TE>   "After he molested me, he would bless me," says the former altar
boy, who was an adolescent at the time and now lives in Southern
California, having struggled for years with alcohol, drugs, anger and
shame. "It's very confusing. I was in the center of my mother's life,
the church, and she thought I was doing constructive things by being
with the priest. After we did these things, he'd put his hand on my
head and make the sign of the cross."</TE>
<TE>   The former altar boy said he'd like to write a book, and I asked
what exactly it would be about.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," he said. "About a happy go-lucky kid that met a
priest and learned how to hate himself."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Brandon, the oldest boy, was sensitive, studious and into sports.
Connor, the second son, was outgoing and had a smile that filled his
whole face. Jacob, the youngest, was already a bit of a ham.</LD>
<LD>   And their "Papa," Donald Ybarra, was their hero right to the end,
dying as he tried to save his children from the family's burning
Placentia home late Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   They were all Melodie Ybarra's boys, her best friends, her whole
world. On Tuesday, with the tragic events of the previous night still
surreal, a choked-up Ybarra spoke of the loved ones she lost in the
fire.</LD>
<TE>   "I had a great family," she said. "I want everyone to remember
them."</TE>
<TE>   Ybarra, who suffered burns on her back before escaping from the
three-bedroom house on Joan Way, was recovering in her old bedroom at
her mom's home in Fullerton. Still dressed in hospital scrubs and
surrounded by friends and family, she wept as she spoke but remained
composed, determined to share the good times rather than dwell on the
pain.</TE>
<TE>   Ybarra began dating Don nearly 20 years earlier. The two met on a
Cal State Fullerton softball field, brought there by a mutual friend
for a pickup game that never materialized because no one else showed
up.</TE>
<TE>   "He was special right from the start," she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, their friendship turned romantic. And after five
years of dating, they got engaged, driving that same night to see the
friend who introduced them, asking him to be their best man.</TE>
<TE>   "We went to his house and threw rocks up at his window to get him
to wake up so we could tell him," Ybarra said with a smile as she
recalled getting ready for her April 1991 wedding.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon arrived three years later. But if the doctors had had
their way, he might have never been born. After Ybarra contracted
chicken pox, they wanted to terminate the pregnancy. She refused.</TE>
<TE>   "I said 'Wait a second, we're not getting rid of anyone.' They
told me all the bad things that could have happened to him, like
brain damage," she said. "We had a very scary pregnancy."</TE>
<TE>   Ybarra said she named him Brandon because it included her
husband's name.</TE>
<TE>   "He not only turned out all right, he turned out perfect,"
Melodie's mother, Peggy Marek, said.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon, 7, played soccer, baseball and basketball, with his dad
coaching some of his teams. When he didn't have a game, he would
spend Friday nights with his grandmother. They would rent Pokemon and
Disney cartoons, then snuggle up and watch TV, munching on Cheese
Nips, his favorite snack.</TE>
<TE>   "I just got him this VCR so he could tape his cartoons," Marek
said, tears welling up in her eyes. "He didn't get to use it."</TE>
<TE>   Connor, 4, was nicknamed the "Town Crier" because of the way he
would stand on the stoop of his home and call out to neighbors as
they passed. In the last few weeks, he taught himself how to ride his
bike without training wheels.</TE>
<TE>   Jacob, 2, was Connor's best buddy. He recently had passed a couple
of milestones: He stopped sleeping in his crib and was potty trained.
He used to mimic the family dog, Summer Rain, to get attention.</TE>
<TE>   "He would walk around on all fours, with his tongue wagging, and
come up and lick you," Ybarra recalled. "He wouldn't say he was a
doggy; he would just keep playing the part."</TE>
<TE>   The boys idolized their father, the biggest kid of all. When
neighbor children knocked on the door to ask if the Ybarra boys could
play, Don would joke, "No, but I can."</TE>
<TE>   After the Ybarras moved to Joan Way about four years ago, the
cul-de-sac where they lived soon became a popular destination for the
boys and girls who lived on the block and others surrounding it.</TE>
<TE>   Don would teach the neighborhood kids how to play baseball and
other sports. On New Year's Day, he and some other fathers rigged
lights along the street, using Christmas tree stands, to illuminate
an all-night roller-hockey game.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to bed at 11:30, and they were still going," his wife
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The two celebrated their 10-year anniversary with a trip to
Ireland last April, trekking to the same church where her
great-grandparents were married. At Christmas, Don tied a box on
their Christmas tree as if it were an ornament and told her to open
it. She thought it was a joke, but he surprised her with a silver
bracelet with three charms. The first one read "I love you." The
second was an airplane, to symbolize her work as a customer-service
representative for Continental Airlines. The third said "No. 1 Mama."
In between the charms were three silver hearts, with pictures of the
kids inside.</TE>
<TE>   She last saw her husband in the confusion of Monday night. He went
upstairs and never came back down.</TE>
<TE>   "He tried to save our kids. There's nothing that would have
stopped him," she said, breaking down. "He was their idol. He was my
hero. He was the best."</TE>

<HD>Catholic Church to Pay Settlement to Close Abuse Cases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine former altar boys will receive an undisclosed sum and an apology
from the Roman Catholic Church to settle accusations of priest sexual
misconduct in an Arizona-based case that stretched as far west as
Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for both sides announced the settlement in Tucson on
Tuesday, resolving the latest in a string of priest molestation cases
that have badly bruised the Catholic Church's reputation.</LD>
<LD>   A 10th victim--a former juvenile delinquent who sought help from
the church but was allegedly molested--will receive the same
settlement.</LD>
<TE>   The alleged sexual assaults, which began in 1967 and spanned two
decades, involved four Arizona priests and in one case occurred at
St. John's Seminary in Camarillo. The seminary's graduates fill the
priest rosters at many California churches and include Cardinal Roger
M. Mahony, archbishop of Los Angeles, and Orange Bishop Tod D. Brown.</TE>
<TE>   It was at the seminary that one Tucson priest--Msgr. Robert C.
Trupia--hosted "Come and See" weekends at the college for teenagers
contemplating the priesthood. Plaintiffs' attorneys contend numerous
molestations by Trupia took place.</TE>
<TE>   "Priests were bringing young boys in and using St. John's as a
hotel," said Lynne Cadigan, a Tucson-based attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The Archdiocese of Los Angeles was a defendant in one lawsuit, but
"as far as I know, we didn't have to pay" any of the settlement, said
Tod Tamberg, a spokesman for the archdiocese. Officials at St. John's
couldn't be reached for comment late Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Diocese of Tucson issued a one-page apology, admitting "there
have been failings in the past by some within our Diocese to respond
appropriately to reports of abuse and failings to recognize the harm
that child abuse can cause."</TE>
<TE>   The bishop also issued a detailed special report to his
parishioners on the settlement, conceding that the secret financial
payout will have "very painful consequences to our Diocese and its
finances, including the need to increase the indebtedness of the
Diocese."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the settlement, in which payment will also be made to
six parents, Bishop Manuel D. Moreno will personally apologize to
each of the victims, who are now in their 30s and 40s.</TE>
<TE>   Of the four accused priests, Father William T. Byrne and Father
Lucien Meunier de la Pierre  have died. (Authorities said de la
Pierre was convicted of child abuse charges in the 1970s and died
while serving a prison sentence.) Trupia and Father Michael Teta have
been suspended from priestly activities since the early 1990s and the
diocese is trying to get them removed from the priesthood--something
only the Vatican can order.</TE>
<TE>   Court documents contain a letter from the parent of one victim,
who writes about "an especially painful memory" her son had after
visiting St. John's Seminary with Trupia. Her son spent two nights at
the college and each morning awoke "to find Trupia sitting on [his]
bed and smiling at him. The bedcovers were pulled down but [he]
doesn't know or remember if Trupia touched him while he slept.... He
does know that the door to his room was locked.... The door wasn't
locked when he went to bed."</TE>
<TE>   Police officers, responding to similar allegations, arrested
Trupia on suspicion of child molestation in late 2000. But last year
Yuma County authorities declined to prosecute, citing the statute of
limitations.</TE>
<TE>   Other high-profile priest molestation cases include one in Boston,
where John Geoghan, who was defrocked as a priest in 1998, has been
accused of molesting 130 youngsters in 84 lawsuits. A jury convicted
him earlier this month of fondling a 10-year-old boy, and he faces
two other criminal trials.</TE>
<TE>   Last year the Los Angeles and Orange dioceses paid $5.2 million to
settle sexual molestation allegations made against a high-profile
priest. In 1997, a Dallas jury ordered the church to pay $119 million
to 11 men who were allegedly molested as altar boys. An out-of-court
settlement was later reached for $23 million.</TE>
<TE>   The national director of Survivors Network of Those Abused by
Priests said that through the civil courts, victims of priest sexual
abuse "now at least have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the pattern is that the church doesn't learn," David
Clohessy said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the church didn't change after each million-dollar verdict or
settlement, it's hard to say what will make a fundamental change in
the church."</TE>

<HD>Call for a Regional Tax Pool Criticized</HD>
<DH>Sacramento: A proposal to share sales levies among counties
and cities pits civic haves against have-nots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Drive by the Galleria at Roseville, a glittering new shoppers' mecca
in that affluent suburb of the state capital, and you can practically
hear the cash registers clanging from beyond the parking lots full of
sport utility vehicles and luxury sedans.</LD>
<LD>   Drive along Florin Road, just minutes away in Sacramento County,
and see how the other half lives, as aging car dealerships and new
immigrant-owned businesses battle long odds to enliven a fading
commercial corridor.</LD>
<LD>   It is a scene repeated throughout California--a handful of new
suburbs become beacons of commerce, luring big-box retailers and auto
malls that shower the city coffers with millions in sales taxes,
while graying urban communities and less fortunate suburbs housing
most of the population fight a losing battle to protect their tax
base.</LD>
<TE>   But here, for the 1.8 million people living in the six-county
Sacramento metropolitan region, the lopsided, often cutthroat
competition between municipal haves and have-nots could soon give way
to a grand social experiment.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) is pushing
legislation that would force the entire region to share future
increases in sales tax receipts. One-third of future sales tax gains
would be divided strictly on a per-capita basis, another third would
stay as is, and cities that build housing for the poor or protect
pristine land from development would receive a bigger share of the
remaining funds.</TE>
<TE>   The aggressive campaign has angered half the cities in California
and is being closely monitored by urban planning experts throughout
the nation, who believe the approach could spread to other parts of
the state and the country. It has also raised tensions in the
Sacramento area, with some accusing Steinberg, a former Sacramento
city councilman, of using his clout to benefit his hometown.</TE>
<TE>   "We spend so much time and energy trying to one-up each other for
the new retail development,'' Steinberg said. "The challenges in this
region are so great--we have the fifth-worst air pollution in the
country, some of the worst traffic congestion--we need to work
together.''</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say the sharing plan would foster regional cooperation
and put a stop to competition among neighbors for the tax dollars
that come from new Wal-Marts and outlet malls. The struggles can
contribute to sprawl as money-starved cities expand their borders to
make room for yet more mini-malls. And they sometimes even cost
taxpayers, as government officials give retailers generous subsidies
to lure them away from neighboring towns.</TE>
<TE>   The Rich Get Richer</TE>
<TE>   For example, more than $30 million in sales taxes generated by the
Galleria at Roseville over the next two decades will go to the
developers of the mall instead of the city under an agreement reached
by the city's leaders. Also, Wal-Mart is relocating one of its stores
to Roseville from Rocklin, the city next door.</TE>
<TE>   ''Everybody competes for these taxes, but only a few people win.
That creates a growing disparity,'' said Myron Orfield, a Minnesota
state senator and regional planning advocate who believes the
California battle has national implications. "Places like Roseville
keep winning bigger and bigger every year. And the losers have a
harder and harder time providing government services.''</TE>
<TE>   Opponents call the legislation pure socialism, a power play by the
city of Sacramento to bend the rules of the sales tax game in its
favor. What is being billed as a feel-good solution for warring
municipalities has instead turned deeply contentious, they note, with
cities up and down the state hiring high-priced lobbyists and lining
up on opposing sides of the legislative debate.</TE>
<TE>   ''This bill benefits no one but Sacramento. That's not regional
planning, if you ask me,'' said Martie Dote, a city councilwoman in
Woodland, one of the suburban communities that would lose money under
Steinberg's bill. "This is very divisive."</TE>
<TE>   The political debate over the measure, AB 680, has split sharply
along party lines, with GOP legislators calling it an attack on the
suburbs. Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks), who
represents some of the suburbs affected by the sharing plan, has
slammed it as a "redistribution of wealth," and made killing the bill
a party priority. Nonetheless, Steinberg believes he has enough
Democratic votes to get his bill through the Assembly this week,
which he must do to keep it from dying. Democrats hold 50 of the
Assembly's 80 seats, so no GOP support is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg's chances improved last week when Assemblywoman Helen
Thomson (D-Davis), who represents some of the region, indicated she
would support an amended version of the bill. A vote could come as
soon as today.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the city officials opposing the sharing plan concede that
there is a problem with the way cities' thirst for sales taxes has
distorted their decisions on developments--a phenomenon known as the
"fiscalization of land use.'' But they say Steinberg's bill does
nothing to address the root of the problem: Cities do not receive
enough money from the state to finance basic services, and have
turned to sales taxes as a desperate last resort.</TE>
<TE>   "The state caused this problem, if there is a problem at all,''
said Assemblyman Tim Leslie (R-Tahoe City). "So for the Legislature
to come in and reorder the financial underpinning of communities that
have relied on the only thing available to them is an outrageous
situation.''</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 13, the revolutionary 1978 ballot measure that capped
property taxes in the state, sharply diminished the money sources
that cities had to provide services. Then during the deep recession
of the early 1990s, state legislators and Gov. Pete Wilson raided
local funds to help pay for education. The shift was intended to be
temporary but it has never been undone.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, California cities have come to rely on sales taxes as
one of the few sources of money they can control and spend as they
see fit. Most state-controlled revenue comes with strings attached.</TE>
<TE>   In Roseville, a city of 88,000, sales taxes make up 45% of the
general fund--$30 million a year--and help pay for libraries and
parks, among other popular programs.</TE>
<TE>   Though the city rakes in sales taxes, planners note that only 11%
of its land available for development is zoned retail, compared with
about 50% for residential uses, a model mix.</TE>
<TE>   ''We rely on that [sales tax]. If you start messing with our
single largest source of discretionary income, there are very few
things we can do,'' said Craig Robinson, Roseville's assistant city
manager. ''We would not have the library system we have, we would not
operate an Olympic-size aquatic complex.''</TE>
<TE>   Along Florin Road, Larry Carr heads the Florin Road Partnership, a
coalition of businesses working to restore the area's former status
as a major shopping destination. The efforts of business leaders and
state and local government officials has begun to turn the area
around--a vacancy rate that peaked at 26% four years ago is down to
10%.</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time, Florin Road has lost car dealerships to a
new auto mall in nearby Elk Grove, and more may still leave. Carr
believes some regional remedy for the sales tax wars is essential if
older areas are to have a chance of survival.</TE>
<TE>   "It helps us wage the battle we have been waging here on Florin
Road, and that people have been waging all over the country, about
the deterioration of commercial areas and how that leads to a
deterioration of the quality of life for a whole lot of people,'' he
said of Steinberg's bill.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg and others concede that forcing a dialogue among warring
cities is what his measure is ultimately about--the bill states that
if the region comes up with a better solution, that should take
precedence--but critics say it has actually led to a deterioration of
goodwill.</TE>
<TE>   Tilting the Playing Field</TE>
<TE>   When the area's regional government body recently weighed whether
to support the bill, and appeared to be leaning toward opposition,
Sacramento invoked a seldom-used rule that gave its votes greater
weight based on the city's population. Some of the region's smaller
cities and counties were floored.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the divisiveness that the proposal has spurred, Orfield,
the Minnesota legislator, said Steinberg should stay the course. When
Minnesota legislators passed a then-revolutionary plan to share
property taxes in the Twin Cities area more than two decades ago,
Charles Weaver Sr., the Republican legislator carrying the measure,
was called a communist and was all but tarred and feathered, Orfield
said.</TE>
<TE>   ''Now they have named parks after him. He is a huge figure,''
Orfield said. "It's probably the best thing we've ever done.''</TE>

<HD>In Uphill Fight, Simon Focuses on Agriculture</HD>
<DH>Election: Steadily creeping up in the polls, the
little-known Republican makes campaign stops in the Central Valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAKERSFIELD</DL>
<LD>The scene on a rural two-lane road early one morning this week looked
more like the aftermath of a fender-bender than an announcement by
the man who wants to be governor.</LD>
<LD>   A small group of dark-suited men huddled on the muddy shoulder
across from their rental cars, staring at the vast, gray sky and row
after row of barren almond trees. The only hint of the gathering's
true nature was a small yellow-and-blue placard taped to the back of
the stop sign. It featured a rendering of California and the words
"Simon for Governor."</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles businessman Bill Simon Jr. had come to this Central
Valley city to talk about water policy to two supporters, three
newspaper writers and about a half-dozen of his aides. Sarah Takii,
one of the two local Simon fans, told a reporter: "Mr. Simon has been
very well-received in Kern County."</LD>
<TE>   Therein lies the paradox of the campaign of Simon, a
multimillionaire and political neophyte who does not talk in his
television ads, attracts virtually no supporters to his events and is
repeatedly questioned about whether he is really running for governor
or positioning himself for a future race. Yet he is steadily creeping
up in the polls.</TE>
<TE>   In a Times poll this week, Simon trailed the Republican
front-runner, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, 26% to 21%,
in a low-turnout primary, the type Simon's handlers are expecting.
With higher turnout, Riordan's lead grows to 34% over 20%. Other
polls show similar, if less dramatic, movement for a candidate who
little more than a month ago pulled about 5% support.</TE>
<TE>   To win the Republican nomination in the March 5 primary, he still
has a steep, uphill battle against Riordan, who has far outpaced him
in fund-raising and is better known in the state. Simon's aides say
he will increase his spending on advertisements in coming weeks, and
Simon said he would air spots critical of Riordan, a friend whom he
has been slow to criticize on the trail.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's campaign strategists, who had predicted he would become
more competitive by mid-February, say they are surprised at how fast
he has moved up.</TE>
<TE>   "That's far beyond where I thought he'd be," said Simon consultant
Sal Russo, who attributes much of the increase to the endorsement of
former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who was Simon's boss in
the New York U.S. attorney's office in the 1980s and does most of the
talking in the candidate's TV spots.</TE>
<TE>   Allan Hoffenblum, a veteran GOP analyst who is supporting Riordan,
said Simon's improved position is also due to his aggressive courting
of conservative voters, who rely less on ads and appearances to make
up their minds. Simon, the son and namesake of Richard Nixon's
Treasury secretary, has touted himself as "a true conservative
Republican," vowed to never raise taxes and won endorsements from the
Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. and the California Pro-Life Council.</TE>
<TE>   "The hard-core conservatives reach out to find out who are the
candidates who are closer to them," Hoffenblum said. "Unlike most
voters who sit in their house and wait for people to reach out to
them, if you're a gun-toting conservative who's worried about people
killing babies, you're going to go out and find out who's close to
you."</TE>
<TE>   Simon will tape another commercial today and is preparing to
release ads in which he speaks directly about his stances. His
strategists have said they introduced him via Giuliani to capture
voters' attention, and now will let Simon explain why Republicans
should make him their choice.</TE>
<TE>   "If you start off saying, 'I'm someone you've never heard of and
here's what I think,' people aren't very attentive," Russo said.</TE>
<TE>   He Lets Others Do the Talking</TE>
<TE>   That is clear whenever Simon hits the trail.</TE>
<TE>   When he appears with other political leaders, Simon lets them do
the talking. At a Giuliani news conference in Century City earlier
this month, aides requested that reporters ask the former mayor only
about his support for Simon.</TE>
<TE>   After he heartily praised Simon and fielded questions on him, the
inquiries shifted to Giuliani's own future rather than that of the
candidate he was there to endorse.</TE>
<TE>   At a Sacramento news conference last week announcing the support
of conservative state Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside), Simon barely
spoke. A reporter asked him about the hottest budget issue in
town--whether Davis should take up a Bush administration offer and
spend $160.5 million to extend the Healthy Families program to
provide coverage to parents of uninsured children.</TE>
<TE>   There was a pause. "I can answer that," Haynes volunteered.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters insisted that Simon respond, and the candidate admitted
he needed to study the issue more.</TE>
<TE>   Simon usually limits himself to one appearance a day.</TE>
<TE>   On some key dates, like the day following last week's debate when
the public's attention was briefly focused on the contest, Simon does
not have any public appearances at all.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Simon's lone public event was a late afternoon stop at
the Vintners Inn, a winery and inn just north of Santa Rosa, where he
proposed pesticide spraying if needed against what he called "that
terrible beast, the glassy-winged sharpshooter"--an insect that
spoils wine grapes.</TE>
<TE>   Simon was greeted by a half-dozen supporters as he trudged along
the lawn to reach a backdrop of chardonnay and sauvignon blanc vines.
Karen Simmons, a local woman who came out of curiosity, decided
against sprinting to her car for a camera.</TE>
<TE>   "I can show people pictures of me and Paul--I mean Bill--Simon,"
she mused, "and no one will know who he is."</TE>
<TE>   The candidate said he was there because "agriculture is not only
the most important industry here, it is the most important industry
in the state of California." But when one of the two local reporters
asked him whether he had spoken to local vineyard owners about their
concerns, Simon said he had not yet--though he was scheduled to meet
with some immediately afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture Is a Recurring Theme</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture was also the theme of Simon's grueling Central Valley
tour Monday. It began in Bakersfield and included a stop in Fresno
before ending in Stockton, and was his most extensive set of public
appearances this month. Shucking his traditional suit and tie for an
open-collared shirt and slacks, the Pacific Palisades investment
banker stressed the importance of agriculture. Simon, who bills
himself as "the candidate of ideas," doggedly stuck to water issues
at every stop, proposing to expand reservoirs and explore
desalinization.</TE>
<TE>   But there was limited interest in what Simon had to say. After the
sparse Bakersfield turnout, Simon drew a dozen supporters and two
television cameras to his stop at a Fresno farm. Only one
supporter--whose tractor shop Simon used--turned out in Stockton. And
the local reporters wanted to hear about Simon's stance on a Davis ad
attacking Riordan rather than Simon's water plans. "Are you being
snubbed by Davis?" queried one.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a reporter picked up on Simon's daily message and asked
what agricultural groups had endorsed him. The candidate froze. Then,
he said, "We're working on that."</TE>

<HD>9 O.C. Wells Closed</HD>
<DH>Environment: Water district says it mistakenly added a
possible carcinogen to drinking supply. Levels were far below the
point at which the state closes facilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine Orange County drinking-water wells, including all of those
supplying Newport Beach, were closed this week after the Orange
County Water District found that it had been inadvertently adding a
probable carcinogen to the water.</LD>
<LD>   Even though the levels of dioxane, an industrial solvent, are far
below the point at which the state recommends closing wells,
officials with the three affected local water agencies decided to
shut the wells while researching the matter.</LD>
<LD>   Four were shut Tuesday, three Monday and the remaining two were
closed last week.</LD>
<TE>   Newport Beach, which normally relies on local wells for all of its
drinking water at this time of year, now will have to purchase costly
imported water.</TE>
<TE>   One-third of Fountain Valley's and Costa Mesa's local water supply
also was shut off after the discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Dioxane also has been found in ground water in the Silicon Valley
and the San Gabriel Valley, but water officials believe Orange County
is the first place along the coast where it has been discovered. In
the other regions, industrial waste has contaminated water with the
substance, but this is the first known instance in which authorities
unknowingly added it to the water.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Water District is among the first in the state
to test for dioxane. Officials with the district said they first
became aware of the chemical while they were investigating a plume of
contaminated water in northern Orange County. Although that
contamination did not threaten drinking water, it led to the creation
of tests to find dioxane and the decision to look for it in other
places.</TE>
<TE>   The water district manages the large ground-water basin beneath
central and northern Orange County. It notified the three affected
water agencies--the cities of Newport Beach and Fountain Valley, and
the Mesa Consolidated Water District--which made the decisions to
close their wells.</TE>
<TE>   State health officials urged the public not to worry, saying local
authorities acted aggressively by testing early for the chemical,
closing the wells despite relatively low levels of contamination, and
making immediate cleanup plans.</TE>
<TE>   "The district is taking appropriate steps and the levels that were
found were low," said Robert H. Hultquist, chief of the drinking
water technical operations section at the state Department of Health
Services. "I don't think [the public] should be concerned."</TE>
<TE>   There are no federal or state testing requirements or limits for
dioxane, but the state recommends notifying the public if levels
exceed three parts per billion. That's the amount expected to cause
one extra case of cancer per million people who drank two liters of
contaminated water every day for 70 years. State health officials
recommend closing wells if levels reach 300 parts per billion.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Water District officials tested 19 wells, and found
that nine exceeded the three parts per billion guideline, said
Michael Wehner, associate general manager of the district. The
amounts ranged from four to 20 parts per billion. But local water
officials said they closed the wells now to avoid frightening the
public and to learn more about the issue from health officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Public confidence is very important to us," said Diana Leach,
general manager of Mesa Consolidated Water District, which serves
Costa Mesa and closed three of its nine wells Monday. "We don't ever
want customers to have a doubt about the safety of our water."</TE>
<TE>   Little is known about the long-term health effects of exposure to
dioxane, but federal environmental officials have classified it a
probable human carcinogen and the state recently deemed it a
"contaminant of concern." It is one of about 50 compounds that the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has listed as new potential
drinking water contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Kiff, assistant city manager of Newport Beach, said that
while the city did not have to close its wells, "We think it's a good
thing to do right now as we learn a little about this and talk more
with state health officials."</TE>
<TE>   All four of the city's wells were closed Tuesday, meaning the city
must turn entirely to more expensive imported water, which is costing
an extra $7,500 a day, said Pete Antista, the city's water
superintendent. He said residential customers would not see increased
bills for now.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time, we don't have any plans to increase our costs," he
said. "We'll absorb the costs until we really find out what we need
to do and how best to handle the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Fountain Valley closed two of its six wells Thursday, but has not
had to increase the amount of imported water it buys, said Robert
Kellison, field services manager for the city. Costa Mesa, which
typically does not import any water during the winter rainy months,
now must import half, which will double its costs. Leach does not
expect residential water bills to increase.</TE>
<TE>   The likely source of the chemical is highly treated sewage water
that the district injects into the ground to keep seawater from
contaminating the vast underground aquifer beneath northern and
central Orange County, Wehner said. While this "seawater intrusion
barrier" has kept salt water out, it was adding the dioxane.</TE>
<TE>   The district still needs to test the rest of its 230 wells in
northern and central Orange County, a task expected to take three
months, Wehner said. But officials expect to see less of a dioxane
problem there because those wells are farther away from where the
treated sewage was injected into the groundwater.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the water district created the problem by injecting
sewage into the aquifer, Wehner said the original source of the
dioxane is industrial facilities that discharge it into the sewer
system. Water officials will work with the Orange County Sanitation
District on reducing that discharge, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the state released its list of new "contaminants of
concern," the district has been working on tests to detect their
presence in Orange County water. In 2000, two wells were closed after
the discovery of another possible carcinogen--n-nitrosodimethylamine,
which also was in the sewage water being injected to keep out
seawater. That discovery also prompted the water district to build an
ultraviolet light/hydrogen peroxide treatment facility at its plant
in Fountain Valley. The water district expects to use the same
treatment--but with a higher concentration of peroxide--to take care
of the dioxane and possible other, yet undiscovered contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 50 potential contaminants newly listed by the EPA, the
water district has tested for 37, and found two--dioxane and
n-nitrosodimethylamine. They are working on developing testing
methods for the remaining 13, Wehner said.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge for all of us is to do a better job of protecting
our ground water, and all of our water, from the kinds of chemicals
we put into the waste stream," Kiff said. "Eventually, we're going to
drink some of that water."</TE>
<TE>   The issue is expected to become a bigger concern as more
communities start turning sewage into drinking water to reduce
reliance on expensive imported water. Orange County is embarking on
one of the nation's largest water reclamation projects, a
$600-million plan to turn sewage into drinkable water. A new
generation of filters will help keep such chemicals out of the water
supply, Wehner said. And the district and two other agencies are
spending $150,000 to create a computer model to reduce or eliminate
chemicals that haven't been invented yet.</TE>
<TE>   Still, state health official Hultquist said, "Recycling programs
such as this--we'll look more closely into those."</TE>

<HD>Relatives Gather to Mark Jet Crash</HD>
<DH>Anniversary: Victims of the Alaska Airlines tragedy will be
remembered at events in the county. A site for a memorial monument
will be dedicated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years after Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crashed off the Ventura
County coast, several dozen relatives and friends of those who
perished will reunite Thursday for low-key memorial events planned
throughout the area.</LD>
<LD>   The second anniversary will start with a service at St. Maximilian
Kolbe Church in Westlake Village, followed by a picnic at Oak Canyon
Park in Oak Park.</LD>
<LD>   After lunch, the group will visit Pierce Bros. Valley Oaks
Memorial Park in Westlake Village, where there is a memorial to the
unidentified remains recovered from the crash.</LD>
<TE>   Eighty-three passengers and five crew members died Jan. 31, 2000,
when the jetliner from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, plunged into the
Pacific Ocean. There were no survivors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something you really ever get over. It's something you
deal with that is always there," said Stephen Campbell, a project
manager hired by the airline to work with the families.</TE>
<TE>   Later Thursday afternoon, there will be a ceremony at Port Hueneme
Beach Park to dedicate the site for a $350,000 bronze sundial
memorial to be installed later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Some May Visit Site of Jet's Plunge</TE>
<TE>   The day's events will end at 4:22 p.m., the time federal officials
say the San Francisco-bound plane went down. Some people also may
visit the crash site near Anacapa Island on Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "We will always have this in our memory bank," said Larry Michael,
general manager of Pierce Bros. Valley Oaks Mortuary, who spent more
than a year counseling grieving families.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the approximately 60 family members and friends are
expected to arrive today. Some will have traveled from as far away as
Alaska, Florida and Washington state.</TE>
<TE>   For Jay Ryan of Covina, who lost his brother, sister-in-law and
two nephews in the jetliner crash, the reunion will allow him to
comfort others with a handshake or a hug, and receive some comfort
back.</TE>
<TE>   "Each year we still have memories and each year we like returning
to this spot because it feels like we are able to be closer to the
ones we loved," Ryan said.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan and members of several other families have spent the last two
years organizing plans for the Port Hueneme memorial. On Tuesday, he
visited a North Hollywood foundry that has been hired to cast the
sundial.</TE>
<TE>   Names to Be Placed on Monument</TE>
<TE>   The monument, which will contain the names of every crash victim,
was designed by Santa Barbara artist James "Bud" Bottoms, whose
sculptures are displayed throughout the world.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping for completion in October or November and would like
to dedicate during a third anniversary next year," Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Gilbert of Clinton, Wash., plans to attend that event. The
math teacher, who lost her sister, Janice Stokes, came to the much
larger, first anniversary but can't make it this year.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had the time and the money I'd be there in a heartbeat,"
Gilbert said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a beautiful place to be by the water and being around the
other people really helps."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan and Gilbert have spent the last two years attending support
meetings held each month in Seattle for grieving relatives and
friends.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan has a daughter who is a flight attendant for another airline
and helps him and his wife arrange discounted tickets.</TE>
<TE>   The meetings, hosted by family members, will continue for as long
as necessary, Gilbert said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people have remained stuck in a space they can't move on
from and others have slowly moved on," Gilbert said.</TE>

<HD>48,000 Get Incomplete Voter Info</HD>
<DH>Election: Printing snafu leaves fiscal analysis of Measure
W out of South County pamphlets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A printer's error caused the fiscal analysis for Measure W, the March
initiative that would change the zoning of the closed El Toro Marine
base from an airport to a large urban park, to be omitted from about
48,000 voter pamphlets mailed to South County residents, county
officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Registrar of Voters Rosalyn Lever said most of the ballot
pamphlets sent were good. But missing in some of the Republican
sample ballots was information on two countywide measures--Measure V,
the county charter initiative, and Measure W.</LD>
<LD>   Also missing was information on some judicial and school races on
the March ballot.</LD>
<TE>   The incomplete pamphlets, printed by a Visalia company, were
mailed to voters in Rancho Santa Margarita and Mission Viejo, Lever
said.</TE>
<TE>   "These kinds of printing errors happen all over the state," Lever
said. "This vendor is no different than the rest."</TE>
<TE>   Lever has ordered the pamphlets to be reprinted with the missing
information and mailed to the affected voters.</TE>

<HD>Standoff Ends Bank Robbery</HD>
<DH>Crime: A man, surrounded by 100 law officers for hours,
gives up after seven of his hostages escape.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and LIZ R. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His hostages gone and the Alhambra bank where he was holed up
surrounded by more than 100 police, sheriff's deputies and FBI
agents, a lone robbery suspect ended a seven-hour standoff Tuesday by
surrendering.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Danny Kai Chao, 27, had walked into the Cathay Bank at
Atlantic Boulevard and Alhambra Road about 9:30 a.m., claimed he had
a gun and demanded $50,000.</LD>
<LD>   But a teller tripped a silent alarm and officers surrounded the
place. Detectives said the suspect took nine hostages, all bank
employees.</LD>
<TE>   But he released two, and six others escaped through a back room
window while he was talking to police negotiators by telephone. The
ninth hostage ran out the front door.</TE>
<TE>   "He was on the phone, and he looked around and realized there were
no hostages," said Sgt. David Nater, a spokesman for the Alhambra
Police Department. "He didn't come well prepared, and he's not very
well versed in bank robbery methods of business."</TE>
<TE>   Officers said that after entering the bank, Chao, of Los Angeles,
walked up to a teller and demanded the money. Although he claimed to
have a gun, no one ever saw it.</TE>
<TE>   Nater said the teller told the suspect there wasn't enough cash on
hand, at the same time activating the silent alarm.</TE>
<TE>   Officers called the bank, confirmed the robbery attempt and
quickly surrounded the building. The Alhambra police were soon joined
by flak-vested sheriff's deputies, FBI agents and police from San
Marino, South Pasadena and Covina. Squad cars choked nearby streets
and a helicopter hovered overhead.</TE>
<TE>   The robber then took the nine employees hostage, police said.
Nater said there apparently were no customers in the bank, or if
there were, they escaped during the robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Police reached the suspect by phone, and a deal was struck: At
12:30 p.m., he released two women, and police pulled back about half
a block. Using cell phones, several hostages contacted employees at
other bank branches, reporting what was going on and saying everyone
inside was fine. The workers stayed calm, said Irwin Wong, a Cathay
Bank vice president.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the employees said he fell asleep," Wong said.</TE>
<TE>   The telephone negotiations continued into the afternoon, with the
suspect using the remaining hostages as a bargaining chip.</TE>
<TE>   But while he was preoccupied, trying to arrange some sort of
trade, sheriff's deputies held up signs telling the hostages to flee
through a window the officers had opened in a back room. Six of them
did just that, and the ninth hostage simply dashed out the front
door.</TE>
<TE>   About 4:45 p.m., the suspect walked outside and surrendered to a
Sheriff's Department SWAT team. Detectives said Chao took $6,000 from
tellers and the bank vault, but he left it behind when he walked out
of the bank.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Chao was carrying a pellet gun that remembled a
pistol. They said he never drew the weapon in the bank.</TE>
<TE>   Chao was booked on suspicion of kidnapping for ransom and robbery.</TE>

<LD>Police searched Tuesday for a man who hijacked a Budweiser delivery
truck in Orange and drove through two counties before releasing the
truck and its driver, unharmed, in San Bernardino.</LD>
<LD>   The man forced his way into the truck's cab shortly after 9:15
a.m., while the driver was at a stop sign on Grove Avenue at Main
Street, about two blocks from Straub Distributing Co., said Orange
Police Sgt. Dave Hill.</LD>
<LD>   At least two people saw the hijacking and called 911.</LD>
<TE>   The incident triggered a four-hour search involving police
helicopters and patrol units from several law enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   None were able to locate the truck--one of 80 that left the
distribution company that morning loaded with beer.</TE>
<TE>   The driver contacted his employer shortly after 1 p.m., saying he
was in San Bernardino with the truck.</TE>
<TE>   Police say the driver was tied and left on the floorboard of the
truck.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Sweeney, vice president of Straub, said this was the first
truck hijacking in the company's 54-year history.</TE>

<HD>Louis Benezet, 86; College Innovator</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Louis T. Benezet, an educator who championed small colleges and
challenged rating systems that failed to analyze schools' overall
impact on students, has died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Benezet, who was the innovative fifth president of Claremont
Graduate School in the 1960s, died Jan. 23 in Mill Valley, Calif., of
undisclosed causes.</LD>
<LD>   During his years in California, Benezet served on the Governor's
Commission on Tax Reform and was elected chairman of the American
Council on Education, at the time the principal coordinating agency
for higher education institutions across the United States.</LD>
<TE>   A prolific writer, the outspoken educator expressed many of his
views in articles and books, including "General Education in the
Progressive College" in 1943, "Private Higher Education and Public
Funding" in 1976, "Style and Substance: Leadership in the College
Presidency" in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   He continued writing well into retirement, publishing "People
Versus Pyramids" in 1999 and "Restoring America's Failed Democracy"
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Benezet moved to Claremont in 1963 to become what he described as
"chief housekeeper" of its cluster of colleges.</TE>
<TE>   During his seven-year stay at Claremont, he ran the Graduate
School and coordinated operations with the presidents of five other
colleges: Pomona, Scripps, Pitzer, Harvey Mudd and Claremont Men's.</TE>
<TE>   Early in his tenure, he spearheaded efforts to win once-rejected
Ford Foundation grants totaling $5 million for the colleges, and led
a drive for matching funds that ballooned to $86 million.</TE>
<TE>   Responsible for planning for all the colleges, Benezet established
a constitution, eliminated an unwieldy council of presidents,
trustees and deans in favor of a committee of six presidents and
launched plans for an additional college.</TE>
<TE>   Significantly, he also helped conceive and establish the Human
Resources Institute, which made Claremont a pioneer in ethnic and
urban studies.</TE>
<TE>   Considered efficient and businesslike by his friends and aloof and
cold by his critics, Benezet was credited with persuading the
separate colleges to develop several joint programs and better
coordinate fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   He also became a major spokesman for education throughout Southern
California, working particularly to change how the public viewed
specific schools.</TE>
<TE>   Benezet criticized the concept that a college should be valued
because of its age or lucrative endowments or by the number of
students that it sends on to graduate school.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he said, one should examine what a school accomplishes
for the bottom half of its students.</TE>
<TE>   "A college is as good as the permanent improvements it brings
about in the largest majority of its students," he told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Benezet proposed his own 14-point plan for evaluating colleges and
universities and proposed publishing an annual list. Included among
his criteria were the number of entering freshmen who graduate, the
percentage of graduates from low-income families, the number of
graduates holding public office or volunteering in their communities,
student attendance at noncompulsory evening concerts and plays and
library circulation figures for unassigned books.</TE>
<TE>   "What I have done," he told The Times nearly four decades ago, "is
to propose some analyses of a college's inner makeup and performance,
which have to do with quality in the total campus experience....
Inside that college, what is happening to young people, all its young
people, that becomes important and lasting?"</TE>
<TE>   Despite his advocacy for small colleges and the then-unique
Claremont cluster college concept, Benezet left on July 1, 1970, to
become president of State University of New York at Albany, eight
years after it became SUNY's fourth center.</TE>
<TE>   Born in La Crosse, Wis., the son of a Dartmouth professor, Benezet
earned his bachelor's degree at Dartmouth, a master's in psychology
at Reed College and a doctorate in college administration at Columbia
University.</TE>
<TE>   He taught briefly in high school in Pennsylvania, then taught
psychology at Reed and at Knox College in Illinois. He worked in
administration at Syracuse University and then was named president of
Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   He was president of Colorado College from 1955 until moving to
Claremont in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   Benezet was president of State University of New York at Albany
for five years before moving to SUNY Stony Brook as a research
professor and consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Twice widowed, Benezet was preceded in death by his son. He is
survived by daughters Laura, Julia, Barbara and Martha; and four
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services are planned for 3 p.m. Sunday at St. Andrew Presbyterian
Church in Sausalito, Calif.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Lancaster man was convicted Tuesday of raping a teenager in
Inglewood seven years ago in the first "cold hit" case filed in the
county with new state grant money.</LD>
<LD>   A jury found Michael Dwight Hill guilty of two counts of rape, one
count of penetration by a foreign object and one count of assault.
The 1995 crime had sat dormant until last year, when Inglewood police
sent DNA evidence to be tested in the state's $50-million program
designed to solve old sexual assault cases.</LD>
<LD>   The lab found a match, and Hill, 36, was arrested in August.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Hill, a registered sex offender, lured the
14-year-old girl to a garage, where he sexually assaulted her and hit
her when she tried to flee. He could get multiple life terms when
sentenced Feb. 19.</TE>

<HD>Saudi's Aquifer Role Criticized</HD>
<DH>Resources: Activists question the bid by a member of the
Mideast nation's royal family to partner with Santa Monica firm Cadiz
in a Mojave Desert storage project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Environmentalists opposed to a massive water storage and retrieval
project in the Mojave Desert criticized Tuesday a proposed
partnership between a California company involved in the project and
a member of the royal family of Saudi Arabia.</LD>
<LD>   The California office of Public Citizen, a group founded by Ralph
Nader, said the proposed deal between Santa Monica-based Cadiz Inc.
and a firm controlled by Prince Al Waleed bin Talal bin Abdul Aziz
Alsaud shows that Cadiz is on shaky financial ground.</LD>
<LD>   Under the partnership deal, the Saudis would buy a share of
Cadiz's agricultural business, which would provide an influx of
capital.</LD>
<TE>   Cadiz hopes to sign a multi-decade agreement with the Metropolitan
Water District of Southern California to sell water from an aquifer
in in eastern San Bernardino County for use in the six counties
served by the district. The aquifer, beneath federal land leased by
Cadiz, would also store excess water from the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   Among the environmentalists' concerns are fears that Cadiz could
go bankrupt, shifting the financial burden to taxpayers and possibly
leaving environmental damage unrepaired. Cadiz officials have denied
that the company is in financial trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Now being reviewed by various regulatory agencies, the proposed
Cadiz-MWD deal has not yet been approved by the water district board
of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Adan Ortega, executive assistant to water district General Manager
Ronald Gastelum, declined to speculate on whether Saudi involvement
would influence the board's decision on the aquifer deal.</TE>
<TE>   Al Waleed, a nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, is a major
investor in U.S. corporations and is listed by Forbes magazine as the
world's sixth-richest person, with $20 billion in assets.</TE>
<TE>   But in October, he was snared in controversy after New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani returned $10 million the prince had donated for the
families of victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.
Giuliani was angered by Al Waleed's suggestion that the United States
"adopt a more balanced stance toward the Palestinian cause."</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Picks Fire Chief From the Ranks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long Beach announced the appointment Tuesday of a new fire chief, who
will have the daunting task of overseeing fire protection and most
emergency responses at the Port of Long Beach in the nation's busiest
harbor.</LD>
<LD>   Terry L. Harbour, a career Long Beach fireman who rose through the
ranks of the third-largest fire department in Los Angeles County,
said preparing for potential terrorism now looms largest on his
agenda.</LD>
<LD>   "It's No. 1. We feel the port is the No. 1 target--the whole
basin," said Harbour, referring to the ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach, which share one shipping harbor.</LD>
<TE>   The Long Beach department does not have a hazardous materials
team, relying on Los Angeles County fire teams. But a disaster
probably would occupy the county's three teams. So Harbour will seek
to staff a team at the Port of Long Beach with some of the $3.5
billion in homeland security funding President Bush announced earlier
this week.</TE>
<TE>   Harbour, 56, nicknamed Sawdust because he loves woodworking, was
born in Long Beach, attended local schools and graduated from Long
Beach City College and Cal State Long Beach, where he earned a degree
in business administration.</TE>
<TE>   "I majored in accounting," he said, "but found I didn't like it. A
friend suggested I apply to Long Beach Fire."</TE>
<TE>   In 31 years, Harbour has worked as a paramedic, engineer, captain,
battalion chief and assistant fire chief, and has run training and
operations.</TE>
<TE>   When Chief Skip Beck and his three top deputies announced their
retirements last summer, Harbour and two others were named acting
deputy chiefs. A national search led back to home-grown Harbour, City
Manager Henry Taboada said.</TE>

<HD>Council Calls Rocketdyne Cleanup Plan a Health Risk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing public health concerns, the Los Angeles City Council asked the
U.S. Department of Energy on Tuesday to block a controversial cleanup
plan for low-level radioactive waste at the former Rocketdyne
research facility in the Simi Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Council members said they were concerned that the proposed plan
would leave 98%, or about 30,000 truckloads, of contaminated soil in
place at the 270-acre site between Chatsworth and Simi Valley.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a lot of nuclear waste ... which involves the health of
millions of people in the area," Councilman Hal Bernson said. "The
Energy Department has not required the type of cleanup that is
necessary to cure the problem."</LD>
<TE>   Councilman Nate Holden, who sponsored the motion, said the plan
could be "catastrophic" for people, increasing the cancer risk,
especially if homes are built in the area after the cleanup.</TE>
<TE>   The council also objected that the city was not given proper
notice of the plan.</TE>

<HD>Gunman Killed, Officer Wounded in Shootout</HD>
<DH>Violence: San Fernando policeman is badly hurt in Mission
Hills incident that began with pursuit of suspected auto thieves. One
person is arrested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN  and NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A shootout between police and a group of suspected auto thieves in
Mission Hills early Tuesday left one man dead and a police officer
seriously wounded.</LD>
<LD>   The San Fernando officer, whose name was withheld, is 25 years old
and has been on the force three years. He was shot in the shoulder
and leg and was in serious but stable condition at Providence Holy
Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, Los Angeles Police Department
Lt. Horace Frank said.</LD>
<LD>   Frank said police returned fire at the 22-year-old man who wounded
the officer. The man collapsed as he tried to run, and died in the
driveway of a Halbrent Avenue home, police said. His name was
withheld.</LD>
<TE>   A second suspect was arrested about a block away.</TE>
<TE>   Police searched into the afternoon for one and possibly two other
suspects.</TE>
<TE>   The shootout followed a pursuit near Sepulveda Boulevard and
Chatsworth Street that began at 4:15 a.m. when a tip was called in
about a stolen Ford pickup.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects drove off in the truck after police saw them in the
600 block of O'Melveny Avenue in San Fernando.</TE>
<TE>   The chase continued for about 11/2 miles, until the truck crashed
into a concrete median on Sepulveda Boulevard and the suspects fled
on foot through residential streets, police said. A number of San
Fernando officers gave chase.</TE>
<TE>   One suspect hid behind cars in a driveway in the 10600 block of
Halbrent Avenue and fired several shots at the officers with a
semiautomatic handgun, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police exchanged fire with the suspects when the officers tried to
rescue the wounded officer, Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   All the suspects are believed to be gang members, robbery-homicide
detectives said.</TE>
<TE>   Stacy Lip, 29, awoke to shouting on Halbrent Avenue and a volley
of 12 to 18 shots, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I could hear [the police] screaming, 'Get down, get down,'"said
Lip, a singer in a rock band. "It was like a war. There was blood on
my driveway and a bullet in my car."</TE>
<TE>   Lip said she walked outside and saw the dead man on the driveway
alongside two guns and a trail of blood. The lawn and much of the
cul-de-sac were roped off with yellow police tape.</TE>
<TE>   In their search for the other suspects, police blocked traffic for
hours in a broad area bounded by Haskell Avenue to the west, San
Fernando Mission Boulevard to the north, Devonshire Street to the
south and Memory Park Avenue to the east.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also closed exits to the San Diego Freeway from the
Ronald Reagan Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Helicopters, SWAT teams and dogs took part in the nine-hour
search, which also involved Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of residents were asked to stay in their homes. Some
watched the action from their front lawns, chatting over the din of
helicopters. A few businesses in the search area also closed.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of seems like a waste of time," said Chatsworth Street
resident Frank Salazar, who was wakened by the gunshots.</TE>
<TE>   "I bet [the suspect] is just kicking it in someone's apartment,
wearing pajamas and watching this all go down on the news."</TE>
<TE>   Karen Van Antwerp, 31, shut herself in her Sepulveda Boulevard
house with her 14-month-old daughter, Elena.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a scary situation," said Van Antwerp, a first-grade
teacher who took a sick day from her Sylmar school.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the best neighborhood, but we're not used to things like
this."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Claire Luna contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Coastal Panel to Help Fund Crystal Cove Restoration</HD>

<LD>Restoration of the historic cottages at Crystal Cove State Park has
received a big boost with a $2.8-million contribution expected from
the California Coastal Commission, money that originally was set
aside for a youth hostel.</LD>
<LD>   The funds represent about a quarter of what the state Department
of Parks and Recreation says it will need to restore the historic
district, considered the last intact example of a 1920s Southern
California beach colony.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a substantial commitment, and it lends credibility to the
state's assertion that it intends to fund the restoration of this
historic district," said Susan Jordan of the California Coastal
Protection Network, which works on conservation and protection
projects. "We have waited 22 years, and I feel that everything is now
pointed in the right direction."</LD>
<TE>   The Coastal Commission money started as a $1.4-million fee
developers of what is now the St. Regis Hotel in Dana Point were
required to pay in the late 1980s so low-cost, overnight
accommodations could be built.</TE>
<TE>   The money was going to be used to build a youth hostel across
Pacific Coast Highway.</TE>
<TE>   The money, which was deposited in an interest-bearing account, has
doubled, said Sarah Christie, legislative coordinator of the Coastal
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of the hostel, the parks department plans to convert "a
few cottages into low-cost, family-style or dorm-style living
accommodations," said Roy Stearns, spokesman for the department.</TE>
<TE>   The funds could be released within a few weeks, said Christie,
after the expected approval by the commission. The money, the largest
single amount set aside for the district's restoration, comes after
the parks department rejected a proposal by Assemblyman John Campbell
(R-Irvine) to increase rents at the nearby El Morro Village, extend
tenants' leases for another 10 years and use that money to pay for
the restoration.</TE>
<TE>   The 300 tenants at El Morro, part of Crystal Cove State Park, are
expected to be evicted in 2004. The Crystal Cove tenants were evicted
in July after two decades of battling with the state.</TE>

<LD>Restoration of the historic cottages at Crystal Cove State Park has
received a big boost with a $2.8-million contribution expected from
the California Coastal Commission, money that originally was set
aside for a youth hostel.</LD>
<LD>   The funds represent about a quarter of what the state Department
of Parks and Recreation says it will need to restore the historic
district, considered the last intact example of a 1920s Southern
California beach colony.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a substantial commitment, and it lends credibility to the

<TE>   The Coastal Commission money started as a $1.4-million fee
developers of what is now the St. Regis Hotel in Dana Point were
required to pay in the late 1980s so low-cost, overnight
accommodations could be built. The money was going to be used to

<TE>   The money, which was deposited in an interest-bearing account, has

<TE>   Instead of the hostel, the parks department plans to convert "a
few cottages into low-cost, family-style or dorm-style living
accommodations," said Roy Stearns, spokesman for the department.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Douglas, executive director of the commission, said he has
asked the parks department to use Steep Ravine, a coastal park north
of San Francisco, as a model for low-cost, overnight stays. The
half-dozen cabins there rent for $20 to $30 a night, although they do
not have running water or phones, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The funds could be released within a few weeks, said Christie,
after the expected approval by the commission. The money, the largest

the parks department rejected a proposal by Assemblyman John Campbell
(R-Irvine) to increase rents at the nearby El Morro Village, extend
tenants' leases for another 10 years and use that money to pay for
the restoration.</TE>
<TE>   The 300 tenants at El Morro, part of Crystal Cove State Park, are
expected to be evicted in 2004. The Crystal Cove tenants were evicted
in July after two decades of battling with the state. Some families
had rented inexpensive cottages for several generations, affording
them a coveted lifestyle in one of California's most picturesque
locales. Critics of the evictions said the state had acted before it
had secured funds for the restoration.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell's proposal was in response to those concerns and the
state's $12-billion budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   With the $2.8 million, however, state officials say they are
confident that Crystal Cove will not go wanting for funds.</TE>
<TE>   Stearns said the California Coastal Conservancy "is looking at
funding us for several million" and if Proposition 40, , the state
parks bond initiative, passes in March, "you could guarantee that
Crystal Cove would get total funding very quickly."</TE>

<HD>Campus Housing Taking Shape at New University</HD>
<DH>Education: Workers race to complete the first phase before
the August opening of Cal State Channel Islands. Homes will be priced
below county averages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's beginning to look like a community around Cal State Channel
Islands.</LD>
<LD>   Construction crews are building the first phase of a housing
project at the soon-to-open university. The mix of apartments,
townhouses and single-family homes will serve as the cornerstone of a
mini-city on the eastern edge of the Camarillo campus.</LD>
<LD>   Workers have installed curbs, gutters and lighted walkways along
sycamore-lined streets slicing through the development in a canyon in
the shadow of the Santa Monica Mountains.</LD>
<TE>   They have graded the earth and set the forms to pour the
foundations for 207 units, which are being built on a slope that
rises above the campus and provides spectacular views of the Channel
Islands.</TE>
<TE>   The first of those units is scheduled to be completed by the
university's Aug. 26 opening.</TE>
<TE>   Four more phases will follow over the next five years, eventually
providing 900 housing units as part of a self-contained community
designed to sustain the college campus and the people who will work
and go to school there. "They're moving pretty fast," said George
Dutra, a university vice president in charge of development, as he
stood at the center of what will be Elephant Seal Cove Drive.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of a prettier place, quite frankly," he said. "Two
years ago, you would have never known all this was possible."</TE>
<TE>   In June 2000, the CSU Channel Islands Site Authority approved a
master plan to guide creation of a range of income-generating
ventures designed to help expand the campus over the next 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of those efforts was a community of 900 houses, with
a town square, bike and pedestrian paths, a child-care center and an
elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   The projects are designed to generate the millions of dollars
needed to create academic space for as many as 15,000 students
eventually expected to attend Cal State Channel Islands.</TE>
<TE>   And the housing component, where units will be offered at
below-market rates to faculty and staff, was seen as especially
critical in the university's efforts to lure top employees to the
budding campus.</TE>
<TE>   In the first phase of the University Glen housing project, the
college plans to offer 36 single-family homes, which will range from
1,689 square feet to 2,282 square feet, for $224,000 to $299,000. The
sales price of a typical Ventura County home is $304,000.</TE>
<TE>   The university also is building 100 apartments in the first phase
and 71 townhouses, which will be for sale and for rent. The
townhouses will range from 1,300 square feet to 1,800 square feet and
will sell for $166,000 to $231,000.</TE>
<TE>   Several financing packages--including low-interest loans and 100%
mortgages--are being put together to help faculty and staff buy into
the project.</TE>
<TE>   Channel Islands economics professor Dennis Muraoka, who is
chairman of the Academic Senate, said there is much interest in the
housing among the university's 13 founding faculty members.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he hopes the housing project also gives the university
an edge in recruitment, noting that founding faculty members are
scrambling to fill 25 teaching positions.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is something we are definitely going to talk about in
our recruitment," Muraoka said. "It's going to make [working at
Channel Islands] very attractive."</TE>
<TE>   The first phase isn't done yet, and Dutra already is looking
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Bumping along in a four-wheel drive on the muddy, half-formed
roads where future phases will unfold, he talked of plans for
creation of a Chumash demonstration village and a public elementary
school that will serve as a training ground for college students
pursuing education careers.</TE>
<TE>   And he talked of creating a commercial center complete with
restaurants, bookstores and other businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a unique project," he said. "And I feel good about it. It's
part of the overall success of this university."</TE>

<HD>Davis Defends His Ads</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN and MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis on Tuesday defended his statewide television ads
attacking his leading Republican challenger's position on abortion
rights, saying he is simply correcting statements by former Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.</LD>
<LD>   Riordan and his campaign staff have contended that the former
mayor favors abortion rights, as Davis does, despite Riordan's past
donations to antiabortion causes.</LD>
<LD>   Davis, who faces no opposition in the March primary, expects to be
challenged by Riordan in the November general election, and he is
signaling early that he intends to call attention to the former
mayor's position.</LD>
<TE>   "We've corrected the record on Mr. Riordan's issues on abortion,"
Davis said. "He says he's pro-choice, but he's spent an awful lot of
money funding the opposition. If I was pro-choice, I wouldn't spend a
nickel funding the opposition."</TE>
<TE>   Davis was at Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay to announce the
start of a $2.6-billion reconstruction of the San Francisco-Oakland
Bay Bridge, which was damaged by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
Davis said the new 10-lane span, which will take five years to
complete, will be "the strongest bridge in America," able to
withstand an 8.5 earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   After the event, the governor said his decision to begin airing
attack ads more than nine months before the general election "is not
risky at all."</TE>
<TE>   "[Riordan] concedes [that] everything in the ad is accurate,"
Davis said. "You do a favor to the public, who then can decide who to
believe and who not to believe."</TE>
<TE>   Later, the governor introduced former President Clinton, who spoke
at UC Berkeley. Clinton was planning to appear at a Davis fund-raiser
this week at the Beverly Hills home of Ron Burkle.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said Davis' ads were a sign of "desperation," adding:
"It's in some ways flattering to me that he's running scared."</TE>
<TE>   When asked about Davis' charge that Los Angeles gouged the rest of
the state on electricity sales last year when he was mayor, Riordan
invoked Enron. He said he had returned a $500 donation from an Enron
subsidiary to his 1997 mayoral campaign, but that Davis had received
more than $100,000 from the energy giant. "To my knowledge, he still
has that money," Riordan said.</TE>

<HD>Death Row Inmate Was Calm, Alone to End</HD>
<DH>Execution: Stephen Wayne Anderson showed no anxiety, sought
no comfort, officials say. He said his extensive prison writings
would speak for him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN QUENTIN</DL>
<LD>In the hours before his 1993 execution, quadruple killer David Edwin
Mason wanted to talk football. Manuel Babbitt, rapist and murderer,
decided to read his mail before walking to the death chamber in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Inmates executed at San Quentin State Prison portray a certain
stoicism as the end grows near. But in their final hours, said Capt.
K.J. Williams, who oversees the 594 men housed on death row, they
betray their true feelings, rambling incoherently and choosing
subject matter--such as the talent of former NFL quarterback John
Elway--that seems desperately removed from the matter at hand.</LD>
<LD>   Not Stephen Wayne Anderson.</LD>
<TE>   In his final days, corrections officials and prison guards said
Monday and Tuesday, Anderson was disarmingly calm. He refused to go
outside. He had given his few possessions to fellow inmates at San
Quentin State Prison. Five days ago, he told guards to stop sending
spiritual advisors to chat. Then he stopped accepting visitors
altogether. He stopped taking phone calls, too.</TE>
<TE>   And then, in the end, the loneliest life ended in the loneliest
way.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty years in here, I think it caught up with him," said
Williams. "This was a part of his destiny. He accepted it."</TE>
<TE>   A drifter who shot and killed an 81-year-old grandmother in 1980
while trying to burglarize her San Bernardino County home, Anderson
became early Tuesday the 10th man executed in California since voters
reinstated the death penalty in 1978. He was 48.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all of them, taking advantage of relaxed restrictions on
visitation in their final days, were surrounded by friends, relatives
and counselors. But Anderson--resigned to his fate, sleeping soundly
and maintaining a robust appetite that kept him close to 300
pounds--was more alone at the end than any inmate prison officials
could remember. He had two sons, but he barely knew them--one, in his
late 20s, still doesn't know his father was executed--and they did
not visit. No friends visited.</TE>
<TE>   "Periodically, he was asked if he wanted anything or anyone," said
California Department of Corrections spokesman Bob Martinez. "The
answer was: 'Negative.'"</TE>
<TE>   He had grown close to his attorneys, but in the end lost interest
in their campaign to get his sentence commuted to life in prison. He
felt seeing them would be a waste of their time and his, Williams
said before Tuesday's execution.</TE>
<TE>   "He just completely withdrew," Williams said. "They all play
tough. But after a while, you can tell it's getting to them. Not this
guy. This was an unusual man. These people have done some terrible
things, but they are still people. In a sense, this is the last
dignity they have--to die with dignity. And he will do that."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson was expressionless as he entered the chamber at 12:05
a.m. and was helped onto the gurney. He did not resist or speak as
guards strapped down his ankles, then removed heavy chains that bound
his arms to his waist.</TE>
<TE>   The guards unclenched his fists and taped down his fingers.
Setting a box of new syringes on his legs, as if he were a workbench,
they hooked intravenous lines to his tattooed arms, then left and
locked the door behind them. He was alone, blinking at the ceiling of
the 7-foot-wide, hospital green capsule.</TE>
<TE>   A prison guard took a rolled-up script passed to him through a
death chamber keyhole and announced in a jarring voice, in case there
was any confusion: "The execution shall now proceed."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson strained his head several times to look toward the 40
witnesses. One of his attorneys, Margo Rocconi, mouthed the words "I
love you" to him several times. His eyes blinking, his right foot
twitching, he mouthed the words "thank you."</TE>
<TE>   His breathing became strained and heavy, his chest heaving every
five or six seconds. The blood drained from his face, his head rolled
to the right and he was motionless by 12:23 a.m. After seven minutes,
during which the only sound was the clunking of boiler pipes and the
periodic beeps of medical equipment, he was pronounced dead.</TE>
<TE>   Though Anderson had been allowed to designate seven witnesses, he
chose just three, all believed to be members of his defense team.
Relatives of his victim had made it clear that they did not want him
to die for his crimes, and they declined to witness the execution.
Inside were attorneys, law enforcement officers and journalists.</TE>
<TE>   There were no tears--there was little emotion at all, which only
seemed to bolster the defense's contention that no one cared whether
Anderson died besides San Bernardino County prosecutors. Prosecutors
say that when it came to Anderson, their "client" was the public
because murder is a crime against society.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson told prison officials he did not want to make a final
statement, saying his vast collection of prison poetry and essays
would speak for itself. Prosecutors could not be reached for comment
Tuesday. Anderson's seven-member defense team issued a statement
Tuesday morning saying, in part:</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Anderson was ... executed despite the fact that his life had
redeeming value and that, as the poet laureate of the condemned, he
still had so much more to contribute to the world. It has been a
privilege to represent him. We will miss him greatly."</TE>
<TE>   Williams and other officials said Anderson was a loner to the end.</TE>
<TE>   "Those," Williams said, shaking his head toward the cellblocks,
"were his only friends."</TE>
<TE>   But even they seemed to want it over with--because they don't
think much of murderers either. On Monday, inmate Rich Geddis, an
Oakland dockworker who recently violated his probation when he got in
a verbal altercation with his parole officer, was asked to sweep the
prison steps. Though San Quentin is known for death row, the majority
of its 6,000 inmates--like Geddis, originally imprisoned for grand
theft--are not killers.</TE>
<TE>   The prison is locked down on execution days, which alters the
routine of other inmates, prohibiting them, for example, from going
to the exercise yard.</TE>
<TE>   "The system makes it look like we care. It makes us look like we
support these people, like we are going to stand behind them," Geddis
said. "But we consider them a different class of people. Most of us
are normal people, with families and everything. Most of them have
done some pretty awful things. They are on death row for a reason. I
think they should do it."</TE>

<HD>Placentia Fire Kills Father, 3 Sons</HD>
<DH>Blaze: Donald Ybarra tries to save his young boys, only to
be trapped upstairs with them. Awakened by her husband, wife
survives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER, JESSICA GARRISON and JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Donald Ybarra raced into the inferno to save his three sons from
their burning home. Outside, his neighbors tried furiously to tame
fast-moving flames with a garden hose. Intense heat beat them all.</LD>
<LD>   In the span of four minutes Monday night, Ybarra and the boys were
dead, his wife was badly burned, and a close-knit Placentia
neighborhood was left to grieve.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, fire investigators used a dog trained to sniff out
accelerants but were unable to determine the origin and cause of the
blaze, which broke out about 9:30 p.m. on a cold night on Joan Way.</LD>
<TE>   The fire killed Ybarra, 39, and sons Brandon, 7, Connor, 4, and
Jacob, 2. The boys' mother, Melodie Ybarra, 36, was treated for
second-degree burns over most of her back.</TE>
<TE>   Melodie Ybarra told neighbors that she and her husband tried to
climb the stairs to their boys' second-floor bedrooms. She was chased
back by flames and ran to a neighbor's home for help.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Ybarra kept going, and never made it out.</TE>
<TE>   "Don laid down his life. He laid down his life to get to his
children," said Father Tim Ramaekers, pastor of St. Joseph's Catholic
Church in Placentia, where the family worshiped. "He is an example of
heroism and love."</TE>
<TE>   Ybarra's body was found in an upstairs bedroom with two of his
children, fire officials said. The third child was found in another
bedroom. The family's golden retriever, Summer Rain, also died. The
deaths rocked the neighborhood where the Ybarras had lived for years,
taking part in Friday night summertime block parties and the annual
Fourth of July celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Ki Tipton said Ybarra, who installed and serviced
electric security gates, was the neighborhood soccer coach.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a big old kid," she said. "He played hockey, soccer with
the kids all the time. He taught my little girl how to play
basketball. They were all about their kids."</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Vista Elementary School, behind the cul-de-sac, is the
community's focal point. Melodie Ybarra was in charge of the school's
yearbook.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a real close street," Scott McMillan said. "There are
kids all up and down the street, all under the age of 10 playing
together all the time. My two kids were always down at their house
playing roller hockey."</TE>
<TE>   Tipton's husband Ted said the pounding on his door came late
Monday evening as he was settling in for the night. Melodie Ybarra
was standing there in her underwear, screaming. Her face was smeared
with soot. Her hair was singed.</TE>
<TE>   "She was completely hysterical," Tipton said. "She said the kids
were still in the house. Don had gone after them but she couldn't get
back in."</TE>
<TE>   Ki Tipton put a robe on Ybarra as Ted Tipton looked at his
neighbor's home. It was engulfed in flames.</TE>
<TE>   "We watched her in horror as she realized what was happening,"
Coley Fisher said. "The fire department was not here long when it was
evident they would not be able to get into the house."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, firefighters got only 15 feet into the house before they
were driven back by the heat, officials said. Shortly thereafter, the
roof collapsed. It took two hours to extinguish the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   As the fire raged, neighbors watched the windows for signs that
someone was trying to escape.</TE>
<TE>   There were none.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday afternoon, amid the roar of chain saws wielded by cleanup
crews, Ramaekers arrived at what was left of the home to bless the
dead. Outside, family members and friends knelt, their heads bowed in
prayer.</TE>
<TE>   "She's in an absolute state of shock," Ramaekers said of Melodie
Ybarra, a customer service agent for Continental Airlines at John
Wayne Airport. She was treated and released from Kaiser Permanente
Anaheim Medical Center, but will need further care for her burns.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators declined to discuss whether there were functioning
smoke detectors in the house, which was built in 1972. The Ybarras,
who had rented the home for several years, bought the home from her
brother, Michael Marek, last February.</TE>
<TE>   Marek, 44, received a call Monday night telling him of the fire.
As he sped from his Yorba Linda home to Joan Way, he saw a plume of
smoke rising.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Please let none of them be hurt,'" Marek said Tuesday
through tears. "When none of the firemen would look me in the eye, I
knew it would be bad."</TE>
<TE>   Marek found his sister at a neighbor's home, burned, with a broken
foot.</TE>
<TE>   In her anguish, she wondered whether there was something,
anything, she could have done.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I could have stopped it," she cried to her brother.</TE>
<TE>   "She's lost everything. It's horrible," Marek said. "There were no
better parents. There was no more loving couple. They had the best
life. The best marriage. They had a great family."</TE>

<HD>Michael Hammond, 69; New Chief of NEA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael P. Hammond, just one week into his new job as chairman of the
National Endowment for the Arts, was found dead Tuesday at his
temporary residence in Washington, D.C. He was 69.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of death remained undetermined at press time, but NEA
spokesman Mark Weinberg said it was apparently natural causes.</LD>
<LD>   Weinberg, who called Hammond's sudden death a "tragic loss," said
the White House is expected to name an acting chairman for the
federal arts agency shortly.</LD>
<TE>   After that, President Bush will nominate a new candidate, who must
then be confirmed by the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's grant-making and programs are not expected to be
disrupted as the Bush administration seeks a new NEA chief.</TE>
<TE>   Bush praised Hammond in a statement released Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael Hammond was an accomplished conductor, composer and
advocate of the arts," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "His commitment to excellence and his extraordinary talents will
be greatly missed.''</TE>
<TE>   Hammond, former dean of Rice University's Shepherd School of
Music, was confirmed as chairman of the federal arts agency just over
a month ago. He began work on Jan. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Hammond succeeded Bill Ivey, a Clinton appointee who stepped down
from the post Sept. 1, eight months before the end of his four-year
term, saying he wanted to make way for the new administration. Robert
Martin, Bush's newly appointed director of the Federal Institute for
Museum and Library Sciences, served as acting chairman in the
interim.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Hammond stayed home from the office because of flu-like
symptoms--but despite his illness attended a gala dinner and opening
night performance of "The Duchess of Malfi" at Washington's
Shakespeare Theatre. The arts endowment was co-sponsor of the
production.</TE>
<TE>   Hammond, who attended the evening's events with the endowment's
director of theater programs, Gigi Bolt, ate dinner at a
pre-performance party at the U.S. Navy Memorial and Naval Heritage
Center a few blocks from the theater, then walked to the theater with
Nicholas Goldsborough, the Shakespeare Theatre's new managing
director.</TE>
<TE>   Goldsborough is also a newcomer to Washington: Formerly a vice
president at the Los Angeles Music Center, Goldsborough took over his
new post one day before Hammond arrived at the NEA. Goldsborough said
theater personnel were excited by the attendance of the new arts
agency chief, among a celebrity-studded crowd that included Supreme
Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Jordan's Queen Noor.</TE>
<TE>   By the play's intermission, however, Hammond was feeling so ill
that he left in a taxicab to return to the house where he had been
staying since arriving in Washington. His wife, Anne Lilley Hammond,
was in Houston, dealing with furniture movers at the couple's house
there, so Hammond was alone. When he failed to arrive at his office
in the morning--Hammond usually came in very early, Weinberg
said--concerned co-workers made repeated calls to the house. When
there was no answer, police were called. Officers broke into the
house to find Hammond's body.</TE>
<TE>   "On our way from the dinner to the theater, I spent a little time
with him, a nice getting-to-know-you kind of chat," Goldsborough said
Tuesday. "We agreed that we would get together very soon; I guess
that's not going to happen. I'm shocked."</TE>
<TE>   The NEA's Weinberg said of Hammond: "He had a great passion for
the arts, and for the role of the National Endowment in creating a
lively appreciation for the arts in this country. He believed very
strongly in the importance of early education in the arts for young
people. He was a very accomplished composer, conductor and educator.
But despite his brilliance, he was very easy to talk to and had a
very open mind. He didn't always presume to know best, and he was
just a lovely, lovely man."</TE>
<TE>   Before taking a position at Rice University, Hammond was the
founding dean of music for the new arts campus of the State
University of New York at Purchase, where he later served as
president of the college. He founded Pepsico Summerfare, an
international festival of the arts at Purchase, and was director of
the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music in Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Hammond, a native of Kenosha, Wis., was a Rhodes scholar, educated
at Lawrence University and Delhi University, where he studied Indian
philosophy. A composer and conductor, he served on the board of the
Houston Symphony and was a founder of the Prague Mozart Academy, now
the European Mozart Academy, in the Czech Republic. His interests
included music from Southeast Asia, the Renaissance and the Middle
Ages.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of his nomination, Hammond said: "I am deeply honored
by President Bush's confidence in me. The National Endowment for the
Arts is an increasingly important agency. The arts can help heal our
country and be a source of pride and comfort."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Hammond is survived by a son, actor
Thomas M. Hammond, who is in the cast of a current production of
Shakespeare's "Cymbeline" at the Lucille Lortel Theater in New York
City.</TE>

<HD>Supervisors OK Limited Health Services Cuts</HD>
<DH>Spending: Plan to address a looming funding shortfall
leaves toughest decisions for new agency director.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A much-awaited plan by the Los Angeles County health department to
address a looming funding shortfall identified a few possible cuts
Tuesday but left the agency's most difficult questions for a new
director, who takes over next week.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, approved by the Board of Supervisors, calls for
administrative consolidations and some internal restructuring that
shave a mere $8.5 million from the department's $2.5-billion bud-
get--a continuation of the agency's 10-year trend of nipping and
tucking.</LD>
<LD>   Also among the recommendations accepted by the board are the
closures of five "underutilized" county health clinics: Northeast,
Compton, Sepulveda, Paramount and Burbank--one in each of the
supervisors' districts. Department officials acknowledge that this
will save at most an additional $5 million.</LD>
<TE>   The Department of Health Services faces a $688-million funding
shortfall in three years, when the federal government's bailout of
the agency runs out.</TE>
<TE>   "These clinical consolidations will not result in significant
changes, but will set the tone," said Fred Leaf, interim health
director.</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors approved the plan and credited the department
for heading in the right direction, but criticized it as not going
deep enough, quick enough.</TE>
<TE>   "This is nothing," Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said. "The big bucks
are not in health clinics or in public health, they're in the
hospitals.... The tough decisions are the ones you're postponing," he
told Leaf.</TE>
<TE>   A new director, Dr. Thomas L. Garthwaite, former undersecretary of
health for the Department of Veterans Affairs, will take over next
week.</TE>
<TE>   "When I look at these numbers," agreed Supervisor Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke, "I'm not convinced we can cut" enough to make up
for the deficit when the federal bailout begun in 1995 begins to
phase out next year.</TE>
<TE>   The department has enough cash in reserves to cover next year's
losses, but estimates it will rack up a $364-million deficit the
following year.</TE>
<TE>   "At that time, the health department goes bankrupt," Supervisor
Gloria Molina said. "People are under the impression that we can
solve this, but it's not true. In '03-'04, we go off the cliff--in a
big way."</TE>
<TE>   The bailout took the form of a waiver of Medicaid rules, thus
allowing the county to charge a higher rate for outpatient visits. In
exchange, the county agreed to move the system away from expensive
hospital treatment to less-expensive outpatient care.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's report shows that increased primary care was not cutting
costs as hoped.</TE>
<TE>   Burke suggested that those statistics may help the county's case
in appealing to the federal government for further help.</TE>
<TE>   That is the only way the county can provide health care for its
2.5 million residents with no health insurance, 90% of whom are
employed, said one health advocate.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't cut your way out of a $600-million deficit," said Beth
Osthimer of San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services. "It's a
closure of the system."</TE>
<TE>   But Molina cautioned that the Bush administration is unlikely to
offer any more help and called for more concrete plans to meet the
looming funding shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   And that shortfall may be even bleaker than yet known because it
does not account for reduced federal funding for Medi-Cal, increased
state fees and a state proposal to limit the number of patients
assigned to nurses at hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   The plan revealed Tuesday seeks to improve management of the
department and its hospitals and to take a hard look at which
services are necessary at every facility and which can be
consolidated into just a few.</TE>
<TE>   Leaf said such measures ultimately could save the department $100
million a year or more without cutting into funding streams. But that
is only a fraction of what's needed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way to solve the problem through cost reductions and
reforms," Leaf said.</TE>
<TE>   But he added that demonstrating to the federal government that the
county is "moving into the 21st century" in an effort to solicit
additional help is the only way to stave off severe service cuts.</TE>

<HD>JDL Leaders Accused in Bomb Plot Denied Bail</HD>
<DH>Courts: Federal judge finds that the pair could pose a
danger if released. He says Irv Rubin, the group's national director,
also represents a flight risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge denied bail Tuesday for two Jewish Defense League
leaders accused of plotting to bomb the Muslim Public Affairs Council
in Los Angeles, the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City and the San
Clemente office of Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), an Arab American.</LD>
<LD>   In back-to-back hearings, U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew
ruled that Irv Rubin, the JDL's national director, and Earl Krugel,
the group's West Coast coordinator, could pose a danger to the
community if released.</LD>
<LD>   Lew also found that Rubin is a flight risk, although he said
Krugel was unlikely to flee.</LD>
<TE>   They have been held without bail since their arrest Dec. 11. If
convicted, they could receive more than two life terms each.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, Assistant U.S. Atty. Gregory Jessner argued that
both defendants might try to flee because of the severity of the
sentence that awaits them if they are convicted.</TE>
<TE>   He said Rubin and Krugel are not only dangers to the community at
large, but they also pose a threat to the key witness against them, a
JDL member who says he was recruited to carry out the bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Jessner said the defense identified the informant, Danny Gillis,
at a news conference last week and that a defense investigator called
Gillis on his private cell phone seeking to interview him before the
trial.</TE>
<TE>   "It is hardly a stretch to suppose," wrote Jessner, that Rubin, if
released, "would orchestrate a campaign to intimidate, or even to
harm, the confidential informant."</TE>
<TE>   Rubin's attorney, Bryan Altman, dismissed the prosecution's claims
as absurd and sensational. "I hope there won't be a capitulation to
the hysteria of the moment," he told the judge.</TE>
<TE>   Altman defended the attempt to interview Gillis, saying "witnesses
are not the government's chattel."</TE>
<TE>   The defense has claimed that Gillis, a former Navy enlisted man,
concocted the bomb plot and sought to entrap Rubin and Krugel in the
scheme, hoping to oust them as leaders of the JDL.</TE>
<TE>   Krugel's defense lawyer, Mark Werksman, called Gillis "an evil
puppet manipulated by the FBI." He argued that Krugel needs to be
freed on bail to help prepare for his trial.</TE>
<TE>   Altman complained about Rubin's treatment. He said his client has
lost about 40 pounds and "is in very poor shape."</TE>
<TE>   He said Rubin has not been given warm clothes and "is cold all the
time."</TE>
<TE>   The trial of the two Jewish Defense League leaders is scheduled to
begin sometime in March, but Werksman told the judge Tuesday that the
defense probably will seek a postponement.</TE>

<HD>Martin Magner, 101; Versatile Theater, TV Director for 70
Years</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To celebrate his 99th birthday, he did what he liked to do every
birthday. He directed and produced a challenging play. That year it
was "The Envoy," tackling the prickly subject of just how neutral
Switzerland was during World War II.</LD>
<LD>   When the millennial census was tallied, the busy theater maestro
was listed among about 51,000 centenarians nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   "I came in with the century. I don't expect to go out with it," he
told The Times in 1989, not long after undergoing surgery for a blood
clot near his brain.</LD>
<TE>   And he in fact outlived it.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Magner, who directed innovative television such as "Studio
One" when the medium was young, and opera and drama on stages from
Nuremburg, Germany, to North Hollywood from 1929 to 1999, has died as
he predicted in the 21st and not the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   Magner died Friday in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of cancer, said
his caretaker Loretta Morgenstern. He would have been 102 on March 5.</TE>
<TE>   Respected around the world for what one Times critic called his
"formidable and remarkably durable talent," Magner was given a
lifetime achievement award in 1989 by the Los Angeles Drama Critics
Circle.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in Stettin, Germany, to a Jewish mother and Lutheran
father, and began his career as an actor in the Hamburg Chamber
Theater at the age of 18.</TE>
<TE>   "I played a lot of ghosts," he once told The Times, "did many
plays by Strindberg, Dr. Rank in 'A Doll's House,' Mephisto. I think
I was quite a good devil--a little devil."</TE>
<TE>   But when the company's Jewish director fled under the burgeoning
threat of Nazism, Magner suddenly found himself named general
director. He protested that he was also Jewish, but a 1904 death
certificate was produced, showing that his father, Maximilian, was
Lutheran.</TE>
<TE>   The director handled his uneasy role for about four years--until
the night of March 21, 1933, when he was ordered to fire the seven
Jewish actors in the company. He packed a suit and a tuxedo, grabbed
his hat, coat and briefcase, and took the night train to Vienna.</TE>
<TE>   He worked there and in Breslau, Poland, and staged opera in
Prague, Czechoslovakia, for three years.</TE>
<TE>   Among his memories of the European directing years were a visit
from George Bernard Shaw when Magner was rehearsing his "Too Good to
Be True," eliciting the grudging compliment from Shaw: "Sometimes
youth is not wasted on the young." Another admirer was Sigmund Freud,
who liked a show about a psychiatrist Magner directed so much that he
offered to train Magner as a lay psychoanalyst.</TE>
<TE>   But with Nazi threats and the approach of war in Europe, Magner
fled to America in 1936.</TE>
<TE>   Moving to Chicago, he taught at Northwestern University, directed
opera and soon settled into a quarter-century as a producer and
director in television. He worked for NBC in the 1940s and from 1950
until his retirement in 1965 for CBS in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "'Studio One,' 'Montgomery Presents.' It was a medium that was not
yet developed. We had to do that," he said in 1989. "And we could
experiment to our heart's content. Nobody was looking over our
shoulder saying, 'Don't do that'--because nobody knows anything.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the most exciting direction because it was in your hands,"
he added. "In theater, you're backstage biting your nails. But in
live television, you are in control. You edit while you're on the
air."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, when mandatory retirement rules forced him out at
the age of 65 in 1965, Magner returned to theater. He moved to Los
Angeles and became artistic director first for the Inglewood
Playhouse and later his own New Theatre Inc., which worked closely
with Goethe-Institut of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Magner produced and directed classics--ancient, modern, popular
and seldom-done plays that enhanced Los Angeles theater educationally
and artistically. Among them were the 1836 Georg Buchner play
"Woyzeck," the Ben Jonson comedy "Volpone," Jean Paul Sartre's "The
Condemned of Altona," Somerset Maugham's "The Sacred Flame" and Athol
Fugard's "The Blood Knot."</TE>
<TE>   A widower, Magner left no immediate survivors. Morgenstern said a
celebration of his life will be planned, and asked that memorial
contributions be sent to a charity of the donor's choice.</TE>
<TE>   Although Magner willed himself to live long, he was philosophical
about death, telling The Times in 1995: "I like to think that
something remains [after we die]--call it the soul, the spirit. If
not, what are we all here for?</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I've been asked a hundred times if I believe in God. I
always say I believe in a God that believes in me."</TE>

<HD>Inmates' Health Pact OKd</HD>
<DH>Jails: Supervisors renew medical care contract with
Monterey-based group that has received praise and criticism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County renewed its contract Tuesday with the company that
provides health care for local jail inmates, despite lawsuits and
criticism in recent years over inmate care.</LD>
<LD>   Acting unanimously and without discussion, the Board of
Supervisors awarded a five-year contract worth about $26 million to
Monterey-based California Forensic Medical Group.</LD>
<LD>   That contract covers basic medical care to 1,500 inmates and
adults on work furlough as well as 220 juveniles in the county's
custody.</LD>
<TE>   "We're delighted to have the opportunity to continue," company
Vice President Elaine Hustedt said. "Anyone operating in this
environment is always open for criticism, and that's a good thing. It
keeps everybody on their toes. But we have done a good job. Providing
good health care to our inmates is our No. 1 priority."</TE>
<TE>   The company has treated local inmates since 1987 and provides care
for inmates in 21 California counties. It has received praise from
local law enforcement and medical officials and a state organization
that rates jail medical care.</TE>
<TE>   But it has drawn criticism for its handling of two cases in the
1990s in which inmates died from what began as minor infections. The
families of both inmates sued for wrongful death, and the medical
group's insurer settled the cases for a combined $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a Times analysis found Ventura County's inmate death
rate from 1987 to 2000 was the fourth highest among the state's 20
largest jail systems, with 1.68 deaths per 1,000 inmates. That rate
was exceeded by Los Angeles and San Francisco counties, which do not
contract with California Forensic Medical Group, and Stanislaus
County, which does contract with the group.</TE>
<TE>   Local Superior Court Judge Art Gutierrez has said the company
seems "to dodge the issue as far as medical care." And last year a
former female inmate sued, alleging the company's policies prevented
her from obtaining an abortion. That case is pending, but both
California Forensic and the county have said the action is without
merit.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors said they were pleased with the company's overall
track record and relied on Sheriff Bob Brooks and his staff members'
recommendation. Law enforcement officials recommended renewing the
contract rather than going with a Nashville-based competitor that is
the nation's largest provider of jail health care.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern is that inmates are provided with good, sound medical
care and I've been assured that that's true," Supervisor Judy Mikels
said.</TE>

<LD>Orange County officials issued a health advisory Tuesday,
recommending that swimmers and surfers stay out of the water at local
beaches for 72 hours following the latest winter storm.</LD>
<LD>   Environmental Health Division spokeswoman Monica Mazur said the
warning was prompted by high bacteria levels in waters along the
coast caused by urban runoff. Bacteria levels exceed acceptable
standards up and down the coast, she said.</LD>
<LD>   Also on Tuesday, officials closed a beach area in San Clemente
following the spill of 25 gallons of sewage from a public restroom at
North Beach.</LD>

<LD>Steven Daetweiler, 39, owner of S&amp;D Tires in Anaheim, was sentenced
to 10 months in prison Monday after pleading guilty to evading
federal income taxes on money he fraudulently obtained from Orange
residents.</LD>
<LD>   According to the U.S. attorney's office, Daetweiler conspired with
Jeffrey Hambarian, former head of Orange Refuse Service, to fabricate
the sale of tires to Orange Refuse, which then submitted the
transaction to the city for reimbursement.</LD>
<LD>   Hambarian is awaiting trial in Superior Court on state charges of
defrauding Orange of more than $4 million. He pleaded not guilty.</LD>

<LD>His category--"stupid driving tricks": Barry Rothman of San Diego was
driving to an audition for a TV game show when he stopped for a red
light behind a Jaguar. The Jaguar was signaling for a right turn but
didn't move, though it had a clear path. The light turned green, and
still the Jaguar sat. A red light came and went. Another green. No
movement.</LD>
<LD>   "I was really honking by then," Rothman said.</LD>
<LD>   Finally the Jaguar turned. When Rothman drove up alongside it, the
well-dressed driver rolled down her window and said, "Show a little
consideration. I was on the phone."</LD>
<TE>   Forget about Valley secession: This is bigger. Larry Scott of
Newbury Park noticed in a cruise line brochure that California has
seceded from the United States--and has acquired a former Mexican
city (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   From Harvey's Hall of Curiosities: Diane Kelly of Rancho Cucamonga
read about a dog that could be booked for the lecture circuit--or a
gardening show (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Second lives (cont).: On the subject of sign editing, Gene Lew of
Woodland Hills wrote: "While driving through Bishop a few years ago,
I stopped to get gas at the station with the familiar orange ball and
the words Union 76.</TE>
<TE>   "After filling up, I handed my Union 76 credit card to the
operator, but he said he could not accept the card because this was
not a Union 76 station.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave him a quizzical look and he pointed to the sign. Looking
at it closely, I saw it had been changed to 'Onion 76.'"</TE>
<TE>   A second life? The Onion 76 story reminds me that Brian Bloch of
Valley Village snapped a shot of a building whose sign seemed
familiar. Was it for a bank that was a no-go? Maybe it's the name of
a cruise line.</TE>

<TE>   * Feb. 25, 1997: A police diver, responding to a report of a body

doll."</TE>
<TE>   * Feb. 10, 2001: An XFL football game at the Coliseum is

Jesse Ventura to growl: "Where else but L.A. would you lose your

<TE>   A few months later, the XFL suffered a permanent power failure

<LD>Every time a call comes into a firehouse, you have the chance to do
something great.</LD>
<LD>   It's a part of the job that drives you, knowing that by the time
you go home at night, you might save someone's life. With that,
however, comes a flip side: By day's end, you might see something you
don't want to see--and may not ever forget.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Greg Boothe, a 25-year veteran,
knew he was facing one of those moments Monday night when the call
came into the Placentia station: house fire on Joan Way. A flurry of
reports made it clear during the two-mile trip to the scene that this
wasn't food burning on a stove or a bogus report of someone seeing
smoke.</LD>
<TE>   This would be the real thing for Boothe and his two-man crew out
of Station 35. Such was the size of the huge spreading column of fire
that it didn't take long for them to get within sight of the flames.</TE>
<TE>   Boothe could scarcely believe it. How could the thing be burning
so badly out of control this quickly?</TE>
<TE>   There would be no heroics on this night.</TE>
<TE>   A father and his three sons died when they couldn't get out of the
second-floor bedrooms and no one could get to them. Boothe and his
crew, which joined about 20 other firefighters, were told upon
arrival that it wasn't safe to go in. That runs against a
firefighter's instinct and training, which is to make the effort to
save someone. But there was no reason to challenge the battalion
chief's decision.</TE>
<TE>   No one, Boothe realized, could survive that inferno.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday afternoon, some 15 hours after he first got to the fire
scene, Boothe, 48, was back at work--this time in a Buena Park
station. He was in the middle of a two-day shift, a shift he'll
forever remember as the one where four people died and no firefighter
had a chance to make it otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   He sounded beat, not having slept since Sunday. His Monday shift
began at 7 a.m. and he'd been getting ready for bed that night when
the call came in. Moments later, he was in the midst of the
"controlled chaos" that a firefighter's job can become.</TE>
<TE>   "The boss says to stay out [of the house]," he says, "but you're
still trying to work your way in, looking through windows, doors,
seeing if there's some angle to try to save somebody."</TE>
<TE>   No one found any. Firefighters aren't supposed to be reckless.
"You can't have 42 John Waynes out there," Boothe says. "If you do,
you wind up with firefighters saving firefighters."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he says he's taken his share of chances. "If a mother says,
'My baby is in there,' all bets are off," Boothe says. Unless, that
is, it was a fire like Monday's.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just so ferocious," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Like most firefighters I've met, Boothe isn't given to
histrionics. He thinks of the job as just that, a proud way to earn a
living. When he talks about it, it's without any hint either of
bravado for the good times or paralyzing anguish over the bad times.</TE>
<TE>   He has a thing he tells surviving victims when he gets to a scene.
"We tell them the bad is stopping now. We tell them things are now
going to start getting better. When you're so in tune to making
things better, and then get to one like last night, you say, 'I can't
fix that.'"</TE>
<TE>   Helpless as he felt, the worst was yet to come. An hour or so
after his crew arrived--when the fire had been knocked down--he and
two other captains went in. They made it to the rooms where the
father and the boys died.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew they were upstairs," Boothe says, softly. "I've seen some
people burn in fires. Old people, people in wheelchairs.... To see
what I saw last night was pretty horrific. To see children like that,
it just rips your heart out. You just think of what the scenario they
would have had to go through to get to what I looked at."</TE>
<TE>   He isn't of a mind to elaborate, partly because the scene is part
of the investigation and partly because there's no real point now.
"I'll say this," he says, "tell me the intensity of a fire when
you're awake but you can't move more than three feet. It tells you
how intense it was, that they couldn't get out."</TE>
<TE>   A Fire Authority chaplain is available, but Boothe thinks he'll be
all right. Over the years, he thinks he's learned how to handle the
terrible things he sometimes sees.</TE>
<TE>   He's seen a close friend suffer a heart attack on the job. He's
held a dying 17-year-old boy who had shot himself in the head,
fighting off tears as the boy asked him to squeeze his hand tighter
because things were getting dark and he was getting cold.</TE>
<TE>   And then a night like Monday comes along. Perhaps on another
night, he agrees, the news will be joyous. Perhaps lives will be
saved.</TE>
<TE>   "Had anything gone positive for us, all that would have been
possible," he says. "But we got kicked in the teeth right off the
bat. We didn't have any opportunity to give it a shot."</TE>

<LD>Edwin C. Steinbrecher, 71, guru of a meditation technique combining
astrology, tarot and Jungian psychology, which he described in half a
dozen editions of his book, "The Inner Guide to Meditation: A
Spiritual Technology for the 21st Century," died Sunday in Los
Angeles of emphysema.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Chicago, Steinbrecher served in the Navy in the late
1950s and later earned a bachelor of fine arts degree at UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   After mastering astrology and similar fields, he founded an
organization called the D.O.M.E. Inner Guide Meditation Center in
Santa Fe, N.M., on April 5, 1973. The initials of the center, which
moved to Los Angeles in 1984, stand for a Latin phrase about gods
bringing forth, and at the same time devouring, the world.</LD>
<TE>   Espousing healthful living--including vegetarianism, meditation
and abstinence from smoking--Steinbrecher wrote his book in 1975. He
recently completed work on what he called "the seventh and last
edition." The book has had steady sales at such specialty bookstores
as the Bodhi Tree in West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbrecher was also co-author of "Gay Soul" and "Exploring
Consciousness in the Horoscope." Until his health began to fail, he
had lectured and taught meditation classes at D.O.M.E.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ralph C. Stover, 90, who protected five presidents during his 27
years in the Secret Service's uniformed White House Police Force,
died Thursday of cancer at his home in Cocoa Beach, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   He joined the force in 1940 and served as chief of the group for
nine years, witnessing the public and private lives of Presidents
Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy gave Stover the nickname "Smokey." The Secret Service
agent was not in Dallas when Kennedy was assassinated but planned
many of the details of the president's funeral procession.</LD>
<TE>   Stover retired from the White House force, then known as the U.S.
Secret Service Uniformed Division, in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Elkhart, Ind., Stover attended North Central College in
Naperville, Ill., and the University of Minnesota. He served in the
Army Air Corps before joining the Washington, D.C., Police Department
in 1936. He served in the Navy for two years during World War II.</TE>

<CX>   Stover obituary--An obituary of Ralph Stover in the California
section on Jan. 30 incorrectly referred to him as a Secret Service agent.
In fact, Stover was a police officer, as are all members of the force
that protects the White House. The obituary also stated that Stover
retired from the U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division in 1968, but it
was then known as the White House Police. The force is now known as the
U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division.</CX>

<DL></DL>
<LD>James T. Usry, 79, the first black mayor of Atlantic City, N.J., died
Friday at a nursing home in Galloway Township, N.J.. He had suffered
from diabetes and cancer for some time.</LD>
<LD>   A longtime educator, principal and school official, Usry was
elected mayor in 1984 and served until 1990, when he was defeated by
James Whelan.</LD>
<LD>   Usry's career was marred by his 1989 arrest amid a corruption
investigation. He pleaded guilty to a campaign finance law violation
and was spared a jail term.</LD>
<TE>   A native of Athens, Ga., he moved to Atlantic City with his family
as a toddler. During World War II, Usry served in Africa and Italy
with the 92nd Infantry Division. After the war, he earned a
bachelor's degree in social education at Lincoln University in
Pennsylvania and a master's degree from New Jersey's Glassboro State
College, now called Rowan University.</TE>
<TE>   From 1946 to 1951, Usry played professional basketball with the
New York Renaissance and the Harlem Globetrotters.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving political office, he served as a substitute teacher
in Atlantic City's public schools.</TE>

<LD>When you've been in the news reporting racket a while, you can lay
money on what people are bound to say about certain big stories.</LD>
<LD>   After an explosion, someone, without fail, will tell a reporter,
"It sounded like an atomic bomb went off," never mind that the number
of living humans who have actually heard an atomic bomb go off is
probably in the low three figures.</LD>
<LD>   And after some out-of-the-blue crime, always there's someone to
say how much of a shock it was, how nice a neighborhood this is, how
quiet a man he was.</LD>
<TE>   Now, to his own surprise, Richard Murphy is one of those people
too, one who finds himself saying, "I can't believe it. She seemed so
nice."</TE>
<TE>   It is not his neighbor down the street of whom he speaks, but his
neighbor across the office, across a distance of a dozen years.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy is a project documentation writer. The nice woman he knew
was Emily Montague. You've read about her lately as Emily Harris. To
her associates in the Symbionese Liberation Army, who had renamed
themselves Cinque and Tania and Mizmoon, she was Yolanda.</TE>
<TE>   But it was as Emily Harris that she appeared on the FBI's "wanted"
posters 28 years ago. It was as Emily Harris that she was arrested
this month in the shotgun murder of a woman in a holdup at a
Sacramento bank on a Monday morning in April 27 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   This old stew of long-ago murder and long-forgotten radicals has
been freshly stirred with the arrest of Harris, her ex-husband and
three others, and newly spiced with talk-show topic A, America's
latest radical sheik: John Walker Lindh: Spank him or shoot him?</TE>
<TE>   As Murphy found out for himself, it's one thing when you read
about it in the paper, and another thing entirely when it's personal.</TE>
<TE>   The sixth floor of the Disney Channel building was a high-pressure
place when Murphy joined in 1987. Emily Montague had been there since
1985, two years after she was paroled from prison for kidnapping and
other crimes. (Disney is mum on personnel matters. Harris attorney
Stuart Hanlon says she worked there as a systems analyst and left in
1994 to start her own company.)</TE>
<TE>   The woman at extension 2323, the woman who had made revolution
against bourgeois culture, was earning a paycheck from Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Emily Montague was about 10 years Murphy's senior, "one of the
best-liked people on that floor" and a computer whiz who went way out
of her way to help him. "She saved my bacon, at a time when she was
probably the only one who would have bothered to do it."</TE>
<TE>   On his very first assignment, "I did a bunch of boneheaded
things," and Harris caught them, marking them in red like an English
teacher "as kindly as possible." Without her, "I probably would not
have been able to hold onto that job."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy danced with her once at the office Christmas party. He has
a vague memory of a photo of a pet pinned to her desk, but that's
all.</TE>
<TE>   If anyone had had an inkling about her past, it would have spread
through Disney's gossip mill "like wildfire."</TE>
<TE>   A dozen years later, he scooped up The Times from his door and
felt a "brain gasp" of recognition--Emily Montague was Emily Harris.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to Harris' computer competence, the SLA had been inept
radicals, more Harpo Marx than Karl Marx.</TE>
<TE>   Their last stand took place because a parking ticket on the
Harrises' van led the police to the house where most of the SLA died
in a live-TV shootout.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy was in high school when he saw it all on TV. He could never
understand what it was about.</TE>
<TE>   "The Black Panthers, I could figure out . . . but this one I
couldn't figure out. It all just seemed a bunch of gobbledygook," a
waste, and it still does. The rest of us can turn the page. For
Murphy, it can't just end here.</TE>
<TE>   So what happens now?</TE>
<TE>   He is a Christian, and he has an example right across the
breakfast table. In high school, his wife knew Leslie Van Houten, one
of Charlie Manson's three girls sent to prison for murder, for life.
Murphy's wife visited her in jail as a gesture of comfort.</TE>
<TE>   And if Murphy were to do the same for Harris, what would he say?</TE>
<TE>   "I would say my faith tells me that everyone can be redeemed, but
part of embracing that redemption is owning up to what you have
done."</TE>
<TE>   She should take a "moral inventory, and then for the things you
know you're responsible for, be prepared to come forward and take the
rap for them."</TE>
<TE>   From what he's read, Murphy thinks the evidence against her is
"fairly solid."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, there's that person he knew, who helped the new
guy save his job.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing would make me happier than for some piece of evidence to
come up to show it's all a big mistake. But I'm not naive about
that."</TE>

<HD>Pedestrian Deaths in City Surge 51% in 2001 After 4-Year
Decline</HD>
<DH>Safety: Officials say jaywalking remains a stubborn problem
despite efforts to improve sidewalk and street crossings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a steady four-year decline, pedestrian deaths shot up 51% in
Los Angeles last year despite new efforts to improve sidewalk and
street crossings around schools, senior centers and in low-income
neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   In a city notoriously unfriendly to people who walk, the number of
pedestrians killed in traffic accidents dropped from 104 fatalities
in 1996 to a low of 71 in 2000--an indication to some city officials
that the city's efforts were saving lives.</LD>
<LD>   But that positive trend came to a halt last year, when 107
pedestrians were killed, according to statistics released this week
by the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials, transportation experts and pedestrian
advocates said they can't pinpoint a cause for the increase, although
police say jaywalking continues to be a stubborn problem on many busy
commercial streets.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that, despite the recent upturn in the city of
Los Angeles, pedestrian deaths have continued to drop in Los Angeles
County and statewide.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, pedestrian deaths dropped from 336 in 1996
to 230 in 2001--a 32% decline, according to the Los Angeles County
coroner's office.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials attribute the drop to a regionwide upgrade of
sidewalks, street crossings and bike paths. Increased police
enforcement and new education programs for children also received
credit.</TE>
<TE>   In California, pedestrian fatalities dropped from 795 in 1996 to
689 in 2000, according to the California Highway Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   The number of pedestrian fatalities has not changed significantly
in Orange County, where pedestrian deaths dropped from 41 in 1996 to
39 in 2000, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration. In Ventura, pedestrian deaths rose from six in 1996
to nine in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates Say Walking Is Still Dangerous in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   While pleased with the declines, pedestrian advocates said they
are hesitant to celebrate decreases that they say remain unexplained.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm nervous about everyone patting themselves on the back because
we still have a long way to go," said James Corless, California
director of the Surface Transportation Policy Project, a nationwide
group that promotes safe and clean transportation alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   He added: "Walking is still one of the most dangerous things to do
in L.A. and California."</TE>
<TE>   Pedestrian accidents account for less than 7% of all traffic
mishaps in the city, but because pedestrians are more vulnerable to
serious injuries, they account for more than 40% of traffic
fatalities.</TE>
<TE>   Police say pedestrians share some responsibility in the problem.
In Los Angeles, some jaywalkers have become so brazen they will shoot
across a busy street in plain sight of a uniformed police officer.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Jack Richter said he was issuing jaywalking tickets on
Broadway near 6th Street in downtown a few months ago when he noticed
a woman step off the curb.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to myself, 'She is not going to jaywalk in front of me,'
and boom, she got hit," he said. The woman was badly injured but
survived.</TE>
<TE>   Many pedestrians are not so lucky.</TE>
<TE>   "Those 107 people who died last year--that was needless," Richter
said.</TE>
<TE>   But many pedestrians on Los Angeles streets say it is the drivers
who are usually at fault.</TE>
<TE>   "I was almost hit the other day when I was taking my grandson to
get ice cream," said Jesus Rodriguez, a retired Highland Park
resident, who was waiting to walk the youth home from school in
northeast Los Angeles. "The drivers have to be more careful."</TE>
<TE>   For Los Angeles, the latest increase only bolsters the city's
reputation as a metropolis designed for the benefit of motorists--at
the expense of walkers.</TE>
<TE>   John Fisher, assistant general manager for the city Department of
Transportation, said that reputation is undeserved. He cited dozens
of projects the city has launched in the last few years to improve
pedestrian safety. The latest increase in fatalities could be due
more to chance than to the actions of drivers or pedestrians, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher noted that, despite the rise in deaths, the number of
pedestrian accidents has remained about the same--about 4,800 each
year--for the last several years.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether a pedestrian is killed or seriously injured is often by
the grace of God," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But pedestrian advocates say the higher death toll signals a need
for the city to redouble its efforts to improve pedestrian safety.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Murphy, founder of the advocacy group Los Angeles Walks
and head of the city's Pedestrian Advisory Committee, charged that
the city's Department of Transportation is more interested in moving
cars than improving conditions for pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   "The city feels pedestrians are a minor participant in the
operation of the streets," said Murphy, who worked in the department
for 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   City Made Efforts to Improve Sidewalks</TE>
<TE>   To combat such charges, Los Angeles city officials adopted a
23-point pedestrian safety program in 1999. The effort included
widening sidewalks, improving crosswalk markings and adjusting
traffic signals to give pedestrians around schools and senior centers
more time to cross streets.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD has launched several sting operations to ticket motorists
who fail to yield to pedestrians. Transportation workers have also
used video cameras at 21 schools throughout Los Angeles to record
parents who double-park and drop their children to run across the
street to school. The parents are issued citations by mail.</TE>
<TE>   The city is also in the midst of street and sidewalk improvement
projects on Vermont Avenue in South Los Angeles and Santa Monica
Boulevard in the Westside. Both projects are expected to create a
safer pedestrian environment.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we get a bad rap and a misrepresentation," Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials throughout Los Angeles County believe similar
projects in their communities have contributed to the overall decline
in pedestrian deaths.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the cities of Glendale, Santa Monica, Santa Clarita
and Thousand Oaks, as well as Orange County, recently installed
flashing lights in the pavement at dangerous street crossings. The
lights, developed by a Santa Rosa company, flash when a pedestrian
pushes a button or enters the crosswalk.</TE>
<TE>   "We are taking a very proactive approach," said Jano Baghdanian,
transportation and traffic administrator for Glendale. His city
installed the flashing lights at two intersections and plans to add
them at four more this year.</TE>

<HD>State to Spend Millions on Better Inmate Care</HD>
<DH>Corrections: The action is part of a settlement of a
class-action lawsuit filed after deaths of eight female prisoners.
The plan still requires a judge's approval.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Davis administration officials confirmed Tuesday that they have
agreed to spend millions upgrading the medical care provided in state
prisons, settling a lawsuit filed on behalf of the 157,000
Californians behind bars.</LD>
<LD>   The class-action suit claimed that the state's 33 prisons provide
substandard care by ill-trained staff, inflicting cruel and unusual
punishment in violation of inmates' constitutional rights. It
followed the deaths of eight female prisoners and persistent
complaints dating back 15 years.</LD>
<LD>   Department of Corrections officials said that in settling the
case, they will save taxpayers money by sparing the state a lengthy
court battle. They also acknowledged that despite their best efforts,
deficiencies in care are a reality in the prison system.</LD>
<TE>   "We recognize that there are some areas that need to be improved,"
said corrections spokeswoman Terry Thornton. "This agreement will
give us the opportunity to fix these problems ourselves, using our
own staff."</TE>
<TE>   The improvements will cost the state an extra $21 million next
year. When fully phased in over seven years, the additional costs are
projected at $122 million a year. The bulk of the new money will pay
for nurses to evaluate ill inmates and determine which should
promptly see a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of prisoners expressed hope that the agreement would
make it easier for the incarcerated to get the treatment they
need--when they need it.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope this settlement will help prisoners so that no other
mother has to suffer what I've been through--watching my son die from
a curable illness," said Mary Kelly, a high school teacher in Simi
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly's son, James, who was serving a two-year drug sentence, died
after medical staff at two prisons allegedly waited three months
before treating him for an aggressive form of tongue cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement requires the state to follow a new model in treating
sick inmates, one employing strict protocols and consistent
follow-up. Thornton said each inmate would be assigned a primary care
physician, rather than seeing a different doctor at every visit.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for inmates said the new approach should address one of
the biggest complaints--the state's failure to monitor prisoners with
chronic illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   They said another important victory would change the way the state
handles the transfer of sick inmates. In the past, ailing prisoners
have been sent to new institutions without their charts, causing
sometimes dangerous interruptions in their care.</TE>
<TE>   "Often, these transferred prisoners would get lost in the shuffle,
and their medical problems would escalate before anybody noticed,"
said Donald Specter of the Prison Law Office, a nonprofit advocacy
group that filed the class-action suit. "We hope that won't happen
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   To ensure the new policies are working, the settlement mandates
the creation of a team of internal auditors and a panel of outside
medical experts who will be given access to the prisons, their
medical records and staff.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of checks and balances built in, to make sure the
state is making progress," Specter said.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement comes a week after the Department of Corrections
was forced to defend its funding of an inmate's heart transplant, a
procedure that could cost taxpayers as much as $1 million. Officials
said they were legally obligated to perform the operation, but it has
sparked debate over how far the state should go in caring for sick
prisoners--and whether a convict should receive a heart when many
civilians are awaiting organs.</TE>
<TE>   Specter said the transplant case is an isolated example with no
bearing on the day-to-day care inmates receive.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is the medical care in our prisons is for the most part
intolerable," he said. "We are simply asking that prisoners have a
reasonable chance of getting treatment that meets the minimum
acceptable standards."</TE>
<TE>   The improvements will be phased in beginning in July, right about
the time Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature will be wrestling over
how to cope with a projected $12.5-billion budget shortfall. The new
costs mandated by the settlement will be tacked on to the roughly
$600 million the state already spends annually on inmate medical
care.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) said any new budget
item will be difficult for the state to bear this year, but added
that "fighting it out in court until the end like [the
administration] usually does is worse.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were in the wrong, and it sure looks like we were, then the
thing you do is spend the money and fix the problem," Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement was filed Tuesday with U.S. District Judge Thelton
Henderson, who must approve its terms before it can be made final.
The lawsuit was filed last April.</TE>

<HD>Dozens of Aftershocks to 1994 Quake Shake Region</HD>
<DH>Seismology: Swarm hits over past two days. Scientists think
they are among the last related to the Northridge temblor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A vigorous swarm of aftershocks of the Northridge earthquake
continued to shake the Los Angeles area Tuesday, but scientists held
to their view that, after eight years, the sequence is nearing its
end.</LD>
<LD>   The flurry of more than 45 quakes began Monday night and extended
into the next day. As of Tuesday evening, there had been 15,714
aftershocks of the 6.7-magnitude Northridge quake of Jan. 17, 1994,
according to a compilation by Matt Gerstenberger of the U.S.
Geological Survey.</LD>
<LD>   Of these, 11 have been magnitude 5.0 or greater, 57 have been 4.0
to 4.9, and 438 have been 3.0 to 3.9, Gerstenberger said.</LD>
<TE>   The strongest quake in the present spate of aftershocks was a
moderate 4.2 at 9:53 p.m. Monday, which was not enough to cause any
appreciable damage or any injuries. Later, there were quakes of 3.9,
3.8 and 3.6, among others.</TE>
<TE>   All of Monday's and Tuesday's quakes were centered in the Santa
Susana Mountains between the Simi and Santa Clarita valleys, about
six miles northeast of Simi Valley and six miles west of Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   Striking the same area was a swarm of 139 quakes, the strongest a
magnitude 5.1, that occurred on April 26 and 27, 1997. Those quakes,
which were a little deeper than the more recent ones, caused some
minor damage.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's and Tuesday's quakes were felt from Santa Barbara to
downtown Los Angeles, east to Arcadia and north to Mojave.</TE>
<TE>   Lucy Jones, the scientist in charge of the Geological Survey's
Pasadena office, said Tuesday that quakes in the same geographic zone
as a quake like the deadly Northridge temblor are considered
aftershocks as long as their rate of occurrence is greater than the
rate of quakes occurring before the main event.</TE>
<TE>   That remains true of the Northridge sequence, although the
frequency has slowly declined in the last eight years and is now only
two to three times the normal rate.</TE>
<TE>   "Still, we're not out of that window yet," Jones said. "People are
surprised at how long aftershocks last. The aftershocks of the 7.7
Tehachapi quake of 1952 lasted 40 years, and aftershocks from the 7.3
Landers quake of 1992 are still continuing."</TE>
<TE>   Could it be that a bigger event than the Northridge quake could
yet occur out of this sequence?</TE>
<TE>   It is not likely, Jones said. But, she added, "It's always
conceivable anywhere in California that you could have a larger quake
than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen so little of the seismic history of this region," she
said, explaining that the intervals between big quakes on some faults
can be hundreds of thousands of years.</TE>
<TE>   Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson, in a written analysis
Tuesday, said the 4.2 quake Monday night was preceded by a 3.1
foreshock 20 seconds earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The latest aftershocks may be on the Santa Susana fault and
reflect increasing seismic stress in a region--known as the Ventura
Basin--straddling the Ventura-Los Angeles county line that could
eventually lead to a large quake, Hauksson said.</TE>

<HD>3 Counties Sued by Gay Advocacy Group</HD>
<DH>Rights: Members claim they were unlawfully barred from
attending a speech by Dr. Laura.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A gay and lesbian advocacy group whose members were denied access to
a speech by talk show host Laura Schlessinger in September filed a
lawsuit Tuesday against the three Southern California counties that
sponsored the address.</LD>
<LD>   Seven members of Gay and Lesbian Adolescent Social Services, a
private group that works with gay and lesbian foster children, said
police were called to escort them from the Palm Springs banquet hall
where Schlesinger was to appear because they were wearing T-shirts
reading "StopDrLaura.com."</LD>
<LD>   Represented by the ACLU of Southern California, the advocates
contend their 1st Amendment rights were violated.</LD>
<TE>   Schlessinger, a conservative talk show host who has been at odds
with the gay and lesbian community because of her view that
homosexuality is wrong, was invited to be the keynote speaker at the
Southern Counties Placement Conference in Palm Springs. The annual
conference, sponsored by Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino county
social service agencies, focuses on issues concerning foster care and
adoption.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Gay and Lesbian Adolescent Social Services said they
have joined other private and public adoption and foster agencies at
the conference for 17 years. This, however, was the first time they
have been barred from attending any portion of the two-day, $200
event, held Sept. 20 and 21.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Ferrera, the group's director of public policy, said
members knew that Schlessinger would be speaking and asked the
conference committee to choose another speaker. The group noted
Schlessinger's stance on homosexuality, which they say she has
characterized on her talk show as a "biological defect."</TE>
<TE>   When event organizers decided to go forward with Schlessinger,
representatives of Gay and Lesbian Adolescent Social Services said
they planned to attend and listen peacefully while wearing black
shirts with red letters reading "StopDrLaura.com," referring to an
anti-Schlessinger Web site run by an unrelated gay and lesbian
watchdog group.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those attending also tried to distribute pamphlets titled
"Words Can Hurt," focusing on how negative speech can harm children.
The pamphlets did not specifically mention Schlessinger.</TE>
<TE>   "The government can choose anyone they want to speak," said Martha
Matthews, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union. "But
they can't then suppress the critics of those they choose as keynote
speakers. They wanted to express their disagreement and they
couldn't, and that's a violation of their rights."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Orange and Riverside county governments
declined to comment on the suit, saying they had not had time to
review the allegations. San Bernardino County officials could not be
reached.</TE>

<LD>The city is seeking $48,775 from a San Francisco woman to cover the
cost of capturing, caring for and, in most cases, disposing of 200
cats found in filthy conditions in her Petaluma home.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council voted 6 to 0 to place a nuisance-abatement lien
on Marilyn Barletta's house. Barletta, 62, faces charges of animal
cruelty after authorities found the cats living closely together in
their own excrement.</LD>
<LD>   The costs being sought include $4,925 for disposal of the bodies
of about 160 cats that were too wild or sick to be adopted.</LD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Two former members of the Symbionese Liberation Army charged with a
deadly 1975 bank robbery are not a danger to society and should be
freed on bail, attorneys argued in court papers.</LD>
<LD>   William and Emily Harris face a hearing Friday after their arrest
Jan. 16 on murder charges in the slaying of 42-year-old Myrna Opsahl
at a bank in Carmichael.</LD>
<LD>   Their attorneys say both knew the charges were coming and had
ample time to flee, but did not.</LD>
<TE>   Also charged are former SLA members Sara Jane Olson--now in
prison--and Michael Bortin, who was extradited from his home in
Portland, Ore. James Kilgore, also accused in the case, has been a
fugitive since the 1970s.</TE>

<LD>A young man who killed four people last year when he ran a stop sign
will spend 15 years to life in state prison.</LD>
<LD>   Jamil Howard, 19, stole a late-model truck in Livermore on Feb. 20
and, with no previous driving experience, took a joy ride around
town.</LD>
<LD>   Later that afternoon, while avoiding authorities, he hit a vehicle
and killed Bernice Martinez, 43, Ashley Martinez, 14, Christian
Martinez, 16, and Desiree Guzman, 14.</LD>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge William Murray sentenced Howard to 15 years
to life for each victim's death and ordered the terms be served
concurrently. That means Howard will probably be incarcerated for 17
to 22 years.</TE>

<LD>The California State University system announced Tuesday that it took
in a record $916.4 million from private sources last year, up 4% from
the previous year.</LD>
<LD>   The figure includes more than $248 million in gifts from alumni,
parents, foundations and corporations, with the rest from sources
such as research grants, contract work and endowment income. Cal Poly
San Luis Obispo raised the most of any Cal State campus, receiving
$43.2 million in private support, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Fund-raising has become a priority for public universities in
recent years, as many institutions try to supplement often-shrinking
levels of state support.</LD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Fear of the spread of a little-understood pathogen that is killing
many of California's prized oak trees has led authorities to consider
quarantines, including federal restrictions on nursery shipments.</LD>
<LD>   The restrictions could adversely affect growers, and it might not
even stop the spread of "sudden oak death," although it could slow
it, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The state already has regulations in place, and they restrict the
movement of plant materials from infected areas in 10 counties.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed federal restrictions would regulate movement of plant
material from those counties, including areas within them that aren't
affected.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A multimillion-dollar fire at a University of California laboratory
has been deemed an accident even though investigators concede that
they may never know how it started.</LD>
<LD>   The Jan. 11 fire destroyed a fourth-floor laboratory at UC Santa
Cruz where genetic research was performed. Damage was estimated at $4
million to $5 million.</LD>
<LD>   Natural sciences Dean Dave Kliger said the entire building was
damaged, either by fire, smoke or the 5,000 gallons of water used to
extinguish the flames. Campus engineer Frank Zwart said it could take
five weeks to reopen some of the labs.</LD>

<LD>Scripps College announced Tuesday that it has received $7 million
from an anonymous donor that will allow the school to create a
performing arts center on campus.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a lot of joy among the music and dance faculty," said
college President Nancy Bekavac. "This is a huge gift that will
benefit the entire community."</LD>
<LD>   The gift, the largest in the school's history, will help
reconstruct the Garrison Theater and will be used to build a
25,000-square-foot addition for rehearsals and recitals.</LD>
<TE>   The center also will have teaching studios, seminar and practice
rooms, offices, a recording studio and music library.</TE>
<TE>   The music and performance facilities also will be used by the
students and faculty of Harvey Mudd, Claremont McKenna and Pitzer
colleges, as well as some local high schools, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The new center will be named MaryLou and George Boone Hall in
honor of the donors who gave a "lead gift" to the school last year.
It will be designed by Boora Architects of Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   The total cost of the project is $11.5 million. The remainder of
the money already has been raised through fund-raising efforts.
Construction is scheduled to start this spring and be completed by
November 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Scripps College, 30 miles east of Los Angeles, has an enrollment
of fewer than 1,000 students.</TE>

<LD>Light snow dusted the foothills above Glendora, San Dimas, Moreno
Valley and Redlands on Tuesday evening as an Arctic storm system left
a frosty calling card before departing for Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   "There even were a few flurries down here in town, but as soon as
it hit the ground, it melted," said Lt. Tim Dech of the Glendora
Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   "It was just a teeny, tiny little bit," said a police dispatcher
in Redlands. "But it was snow."</LD>
<TE>   The storm brought a lot less rain and snow than forecast. But the
National Weather Service was right about the cool temperatures, with
overnight readings below or near freezing at the coldest locations in
Orange County and the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys.</TE>
<TE>   Readings before dawn Tuesday included 27 degrees in Yorba Linda,
30 in Chatsworth, 32 in Northridge, 33 in Glendale and 34 in
Pasadena, and forecasters said it could be even colder this morning.</TE>
<TE>   The low Tuesday morning at Big Bear Lake was 14 degrees, and the
high was 23 degrees, the coldest maximum for a Jan. 29 ever recorded
there.</TE>
<TE>   Clear skies and cool temperatures are forecast for the rest of the
week.</TE>

<HD>Couple Lose Bid for Tax Refund Tied to Tuition</HD>
<DH>Courts: They had claimed that part of their payments to
Jewish day schools constituted charitable contributions and cited an
IRS break given to Church of Scientology members.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court Tuesday unanimously denied the claim of a
North Hollywood couple that they were entitled to a partial tax
refund for tuition payments they made to two Orthodox Jewish day
schools.</LD>
<LD>   The couple had contended that 55% of the tuition payments--the
portion of the school day devoted to religious education--represented
charitable contributions to a tax-exempt religious organization.</LD>
<LD>   Michael and Marla Sklar also maintained that they were entitled to
the refund because the Internal Revenue Service since 1993 has
permitted members of the Church of Scientology to obtain deductions
for "auditing," the process Scientology adherents use for spiritual
self-examination.</LD>
<TE>   In essence, three judges of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled that two wrongs don't make a right, upholding a ruling of a
U.S. Tax Court judge denying the refund.</TE>
<TE>   The judges said the Sklars were not entitled to a refund under
either IRS regulations or applicable Supreme Court precedents.</TE>
<TE>   The leading precedent, the judges said, is a 1989 high court
decision holding that payments Scientologists made for "auditing" did
not constitute charitable contributions.</TE>
<TE>   That decision, Hernandez vs. Commissioner, was based on a section
of the Internal Revenue Code that states that quid pro quo donations,
for which a taxpayer receives something in return--such as
education--are not deductible. The Hernandez decision held that the
section applies to religious quid pro donations.</TE>
<TE>   In Tuesday's decision, the appellate court criticized the IRS for
refusing to disclose the terms of a 1993 settlement with the Church
of Scientology. That agreement, among other things, permits
Scientologists to get deductions in conflict with the 1989 Supreme
Court decision, according to the 9th Circuit.</TE>
<TE>   In support of their claim, the Sklars presented a 1997 Wall Street
Journal article that provided details of the settlement. The 9th
Circuit said that since the IRS failed to present any contradictory
evidence on the nature of the settlement, the court was obliged to
accept the Sklar's representations.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement ended years of litigation that began in 1967 when
the agency said the church should lose its tax-exempt status because
it was, in reality, a for-profit enterprise that enriched its
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Although it was not directly at issue in the case, the 9th Circuit
panel said that "it appears to be true that the IRS" had given
Scientology a "preference in the interest of settling a long and
litigious tax dispute."</TE>
<TE>   In his majority opinion, Judge Stephen Reinhardt suggested that
the preference represented unconstitutional favoritism toward a
religious organization. Judges Harry Pregerson and Barry G. Silverman
joined in the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate concurring opinion, Silverman made an allusion to
the Passover Holiday when he asked:</TE>
<TE>   "Why is Scientology training different from all other religious
training? We should decline the invitation to answer that question.
The sole issue before us is whether the Sklars' claimed deduction is
valid, not whether members of the Church of Scientology have become
the IRS's chosen people."</TE>
<TE>   In a highly unusual move, Silverman invited people who are
troubled by the IRS settlement with Scientology to file a lawsuit to
unravel the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "If the IRS does, in fact, give preferential treatment to members
of the Church of Scientology--allowing them a special right to claim
deductions that are contrary to law and disallowed to everybody
else--then the proper course of action is a lawsuit to put a stop to
that policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The remedy is not to require the IRS to let others claim the
improper deduction, too," Silverman wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Choper, a constitutional law professor at UC Berkeley's
Boalt Hall School of Law, said Tuesday's ruling appeared to be
correct, based on the Internal Revenue Code and the prior cases
interpreting it.</TE>
<TE>   Choper also said that he believed taxpayers would have standing to
bring a suit challenging the IRS settlement with Scientology under a
1968 Supreme Court decision, Flast vs. Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, the high court upheld a taxpayer's standing to
challenge federal subsidies to parochial schools as violating the 1st
Amendment's prohibition against government establishment of religion.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Sklar said he was disappointed that the decision "didn't
address the serious inequities on the part of the
government--basically subsidizing one religion to the exclusion of
all others."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "The problem with Judge Silverman's remedy is there is
no way to undo the past. Scientology already has gotten the benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Sklar's attorney Jeffrey I. Zuckerman said he was considering
asking for a rehearing before a larger panel of 9th Circuit judges or
asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision.</TE>
<TE>   No one was available at the IRS for immediate comment.</TE>

<HD>Kmart's Troubles Raise City's Hopes of Razing Vacant Store</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After waiting nearly a decade for Kmart to reopen a vacant
storefront, Lake Forest city officials are finding a silver lining to
the giant retailer's bankruptcy: Maybe the boarded-up building and
its crumbling parking lots can finally be plowed under.</LD>
<LD>   The closed store sits in the heart of the town's urban core and
has long been seen as a key to slow-moving redevelopment efforts
along El Toro Road. The retail district near the San Diego Freeway is
now dotted with closed businesses and clogged with commuter traffic.</LD>
<LD>   While industry experts say there soon may be hundreds of vacant
Kmart buildings scattered across the country, possibly flooding the
retail market in some areas, the long-vacant location in Lake Forest
could be snapped up quickly.</LD>
<TE>   "We do have people who are very interested in buying that site for
development," Lake Forest Mayor Richard Dixon said last week. "The
only thing standing in the way has been Kmart and what they want to
do. But my gut feeling now is that Kmart would be happy to unload
that property."</TE>
<TE>   Kmart has been negotiating with the city to reopen the store but
has never submitted final plans. A Kmart spokeswoman said it's "too
early" to say what the company might do with the property.</TE>
<TE>   The corporation has said it is seeking court approval to terminate
leases on stores--perhaps more than 300--that have already been
closed. But the Lake Forest property is unique because Kmart owns the
land.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be reviewing whether or not we'll be moving forward with
that project," said Julie Fracker, a spokeswoman at Kmart's corporate
offices in Troy, Mich. "But we're on a fast-track plan, so we would
probably be making decisions on properties like that very soon."</TE>
<TE>   City officials want to revive the beleaguered stretch of El Toro
Road between the San Diego Freeway and Jeronimo Road by creating a
pedestrian-friendly commercial district with upscale shops and
restaurants. The city has a $9-million state grant to cover street
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Progress has been made with other landowners and leaseholders
along El Toro. The Westrust Corp., which holds the lease where the
largely vacant Saddleback Valley Plaza sits, hopes to demolish the
270,000-square-foot mall and replace it with a new shopping plaza
called the Orchard.</TE>
<TE>   Like other shopping centers in the area, the plaza has been
battling high vacancy rates and business turnover for years. Westrust
hopes to break ground by the end of the year, company President
Charles Smith said. Construction would take about 18 months, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon said he hopes Kmart officials make a quick decision so that
construction in the area can coincide</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of those odd situations where it's obviously
extremely unfortunate that Kmart has filed bankruptcy because it's
going to have a big impact on employees and investors," Dixon said.
"But in our case, it's a vacant building. In a way, that's kind of
good news because now maybe something will finally happen there."</TE>

<HD>9 O.C. Drinking Wells Closed</HD>
<DH>Environment: Water district discovers it was inadvertently
adding possible carcinogen to supply. Levels were far below the point
that the state closes facilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine Orange County drinking-water wells, including all of those
supplying Newport Beach, were closed this week after the Orange
County Water District found that it had been inadvertently adding a
probable carcinogen to the water.</LD>
<LD>   Even though the levels of dioxane, an industrial solvent, are far
below the point at which the state recommends closing wells,
officials with the three affected local water agencies decided to
shut the wells while researching the matter.</LD>
<LD>   Four were shut Tuesday, three Monday and the remaining two were
closed last week.</LD>
<TE>   Newport Beach, which normally relies on local wells for all of its
drinking water at this time of year, now will have to purchase costly
imported water.</TE>
<TE>   One-third of Fountain Valley's and Costa Mesa's local water supply
also was shut off after the discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Dioxane also has been found in ground water in the Silicon Valley
and the San Gabriel Valley, but water officials believe Orange County
is the first place along the coast where it has been discovered. In
the other regions, industrial waste has contaminated water with the
substance, but this is the first known instance in which authorities
unknowingly added it to the water.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Water District is among the first in the state
to test for dioxane. Officials with the district said they first
became aware of the chemical while they were investigating a plume of
contaminated water in northern Orange County. Although that
contamination did not threaten drinking water, it led to the creation
of tests to find dioxane and the decision to look for it in other
places.</TE>
<TE>   The water district manages the large ground-water basin beneath
central and northern Orange County. It notified the three affected
water agencies--the cities of Newport Beach and Fountain Valley, and
the Mesa Consolidated Water District--which made the decisions to
close their wells.</TE>
<TE>   State health officials urged the public not to worry, saying local
authorities acted aggressively by testing early for the chemical,
closing the wells despite relatively low levels of contamination, and
making immediate cleanup plans.</TE>
<TE>   "The district is taking appropriate steps and the levels that were
found were low," said Robert H. Hultquist, chief of the drinking
water technical operations section at the state Department of Health
Services. "I don't think [the public] should be concerned."</TE>
<TE>   There are no federal or state testing requirements or limits for
dioxane, but the state recommends notifying the public if levels
exceed three parts per billion. That's the amount expected to cause
one extra case of cancer per million people who drank two liters of
contaminated water every day for 70 years. State health officials
recommend closing wells if levels reach 300 parts per billion.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Water District officials tested 19 wells, and found
that nine exceeded the three parts per billion guideline, said
Michael Wehner, associate general manager of the district. The
amounts ranged from four to 20 parts per billion. But local water
officials said they closed the wells now to avoid frightening the
public and to learn more about the issue from health officials.</TE>
<TE>   Little is known about the long-term health effects of exposure to
dioxane, but federal environmental officials have classified it a
probable human carcinogen and the state recently deemed it a
"contaminant of concern." It is one of about 50 compounds that the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has listed as new potential
drinking water contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   The likely source of the chemical is highly treated sewage water
that the district injects into the ground to keep seawater from
contaminating the vast underground aquifer beneath northern and
central Orange County, Wehner said. While this "seawater intrusion
barrier" has kept salt water out, it was adding the dioxane.</TE>

<HD>J. Young, 85; Texas Legislator in Sex Scandal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John A. Young, a Texas Democrat whose 22 years in the House of
Representatives was marred by a sex scandal in the 1970s, has died.
He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Young died Jan. 22 of congestive heart failure at a hospital in
Arlington, Va.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Corpus Christi, Texas, Young was elected to the House
in 1956, serving as the representative of the 14th Congressional
District until 1979.</LD>
<TE>   As a congressman, Young served on numerous committees, including
the House Rules Committee, where he often cast key votes for
legislation during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.</TE>
<TE>   Young also worked hard for his home district. In the 1960s, he
pushed for an international airport in Corpus Christi and was a
strong supporter of its port. He also fought to get funding approved
in 1978 to continue operations at the Naval Air Station in Corpus
Christi.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, Young's former secretary, Colleen Gardner, accused him of
demanding sexual favors in exchange for higher pay. A Justice
Department investigation, however, concluded there was no evidence to
support criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Young denied the charges to reporters, while acknowledging that he
had held clandestine meetings in area motels. He said he was meeting
with military officials who passed confidential information to him.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, a federal judge dismissed Young's $6-million libel suit
against the New York Times and Sol Rosen, the lawyer who encouraged
Gardner to go public with her charges.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner's allegations against Young came after two high-profile
Washington sex scandals that ultimately ended the careers of two
other leading House Democrats, Reps. Wilbur Mills of Arkansas and
Wayne Hays of Ohio. The Young scandal reportedly took a heavy toll on
his wife, Jane, who stood beside her husband of 26 years. "I don't
think the people of his district are going to buy these stories.... I
think they believe in John," she told a Corpus Christi newspaper in
1976. Neighbors told the Washington Post that although Jane Young
never discussed the scandal with them, she had changed after the
allegations were made public. She committed suicide in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   After Young was defeated in the 1978 Democratic primary, he
practiced law in Washington and in Corpus Christi and served as a
lobbyist.</TE>
<TE>   He graduated from St. Edwards University in Austin and from the
University of Texas Law School.</TE>
<TE>   After serving in the Navy during World War II, rising to the rank
of lieutenant commander, he served in Texas as an assistant district
attorney for Nueces County, as county attorney and county judge.</TE>
<TE>   Young's son Robert died in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by four children, Nancy R. Young and Mary Patricia
Young, both of McLean, Va.; John Andrew Young Jr. of Fairfax, Va.,
and Gaffney Phillips of Livingston, Texas; and a grandson.</TE>

<DH>Mideast: At Newport synagogue, Ex-Israeli leader says
victory requires 'unflinching political will.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Surrounded by tight security, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak visited a Newport Beach synagogue Tuesday evening and told a
large crowd of local supporters that America and its allies "have to
win the first world war of the 21st century and we will." But he
cautioned that it would require "an unflinching political will" and
could take "half a generation" before victory could be declared.</LD>
<LD>   Barak's speech was interrupted many times by applause, and he was
given a standing ovation by the well-heeled crowd when he concluded
his remarks.</LD>
<LD>   "These are [terrorists] who don't hesitate to kill 3,000 innocent
people and won't hesitate to kill 30,000 or 130,000," he said. This
leaves the U.S. and its allies two choices: "to destroy world
terrorism or be destroyed."</LD>
<TE>   "American leadership at this time is doing an impressive job," he
said, expressing optimism that the anti-terrorist coalition assembled
by President Bush would prevail.</TE>
<TE>   As for Israel, Barak said he remains optimistic that the country
will eventually find peace, but it may have to surrender some
territory to achieve it. He also said he thinks peace will not come
to the Middle East until another Palestinian leader, who is trusted
by his own people and Israelis alike, assumes the position held by
Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   He said Arafat has chosen to align himself with the terrorists and
can no longer be trusted.</TE>
<TE>   The event at Temple Bat Yahm had a post-Sept. 11 tenseness to it,
with security--including Barak's bodyguards, State Department
personnel and Newport Beach police officers--highly visible all over
the synagogue's grounds. Each guest was searched with a metal
detector before entering the temple's sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   Barak served as Israel's top elected official from May 1999 to
February 2000. He led ambitious efforts to negotiate peace
agreements, first with Syria and later with the Palestinian
Authority, helped by President Clinton and his administration.</TE>
<TE>   Before entering politics, Barak served 36 years in the Israeli
military and was the most decorated soldier in the nation's history.
He also served as Israel's minister of the interior, minister of
foreign affairs and defense minister.</TE>
<TE>   Barak's appearance extended Rabbi Mark Miller's tradition of
attracting top Israeli politicians to the Newport Beach temple.
Yitzchak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Benjamin Netanyahu have traveled to
the synagogue, along with Henry Kissinger, who spoke on Middle East
affairs.</TE>

<KH>COUNTDOWN TO THE OLYMPICS : 9 Days Until the Games</KH>
<HD>He Is Better Than the Average McKay</HD>
<DH>Television: Respected broadcaster will once again weave his
magical stories at the Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONKTON, Md.</DL>
<LD>Everyone has his own story, Jim McKay is saying, and that's what
makes the Olympics so great, so different from every other sporting
enterprise.</LD>
<LD>   There is, for instance, the tale of Billy Fiske, the first
American killed in World War II, who was a star rider in the 1930s at
the Cresta Run in St. Moritz, Switzerland, where the sport of
skeleton--a sort of head-first luge--was developed. And there is
Eddie the Eagle, the low-flying Brit at the 1988 Calgary Winter
Olympics. Not to mention the Jamaican bobsled team.</LD>
<LD>   And the unthinkable victory of wrestler Rulon Gardner, who won
gold in Sydney, defeating the seeming man-monster from Siberia,
Alexander Karelin. There is a smile and a sigh at the memory of
Gardner's triumph--as much a triumph of will as it was athletic
skill.</LD>
<TE>   "When you predict what kind of Olympics it's going to be, that
almost never comes true. There's something that's different about the
Olympics. Here's a Greco-Roman wrestler, a farm kid from Wyoming,
beating the greatest Greco-Roman wrestler of all time, and Americans
cared about it!</TE>
<TE>   "That's because," and here McKay lets you in on a secret you
already know, the secret that's nonetheless worth discovering time
and again, "it's the old expression: It's all about people. It's all
about human beings."</TE>
<TE>   Is there anyone in the history of sports television who tells a
story better than McKay? For a generation, his voice came to define
the Olympics on TV--from the Rome Summer Olympics in 1960, where he
worked for CBS, and then through a run of 10 Games for ABC, through
the Calgary Winter Olympics in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   At the Munich Games in 1972, his reporting on the kidnapping and
massacre of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches forever defined him even
as it elevated the television medium and the notion of sports
broadcasting. Even now, 30 years later, he says, "People say, 'You
did such a great job in Munich.' They still do. They stop me at the
supermarket and so on. I say, 'Thank you.' It's all I can say."</TE>
<TE>   Now McKay is poised for one final Olympics run on TV. But not on
ABC--this time, from Salt Lake City for NBC. ABC's senior executives
willingly agreed to share McKay with rival NBC, and he can be
expected from Salt Lake to do what he does best, engage in the art of
a story well told.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, about halfway through the Games, according to the
NBC plan, McKay will be featured doing the narration to a piece about
the 1980 U.S.-Soviet Union hockey game, the "Miracle on Ice" at the
Lake Placid Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "The upset is always the great story to me," McKay says, and of
the Americans' semifinal round victory over the Soviets in 1980, he
adds, "I really think it's the greatest upset in the history of
sports, anywhere, anytime."</TE>
<TE>   During the Salt Lake Games, McKay can also be expected to narrate
a few other features. He says he already has done one on the icons of
American figure skating, Dorothy Hamill and Peggy Fleming.</TE>
<TE>   Most nights during the Games, however, the NBC plan is for McKay
to appear in studio with Bob Costas, to share observations about the
day's events. "An Olympic essayist," Costas said in a telephone
interview, adding, "The idea is for people to walk away saying, 'Only
Jim McKay could have brought us that, or at least in quite that
way.'"</TE>
<TE>   Don Ohlmeyer, who over the years served as a producer and senior
executive at ABC and NBC, said, "So much of sports television is
populated by people who think it's about statistics. It's not about
statistics. It's about story telling." Costas also observed, "They
say the camera is a truth detector. People say if they were at the
Olympics, they'd like to sit next to him and watch it."</TE>
<TE>   For instance, a few days ago, relaxing in a comfortable chair in
the farmhouse he and his wife of 53 years, Margaret, share in
Maryland's horse country, McKay observed: "Tonya Harding, you saw
this week, she's going to be evicted. That's certainly the ultimate
of something. And: "The biggest change since we started covering [the
Olympics] is admitting professionals. I think it been a double-edged
sword. To a great extent, it has eliminated shamateurism," the word
that in the 1970s and 1980s was often used to describe professionals
masquerading as amateurs to retain Olympic eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   "On the other hand, there will never ever be another [1980] Team
USA in hockey." Now, he said, "We've got an all-star team of guys who
will practice for thee days and come out and play. That's a great
loss."</TE>
<TE>   And this: "At first I thought they were bringing in hotdog skiing
purely for the ratings." But, he said, he and Margaret were watching
TV one night and aerial skiing came on, and 1998 Olympic gold
medalist Eric Bergoust seemed to be "a very appealing young guy. I
had always thought of them as juvenile delinquents in that sport. But
they look like sincere kids having a good time. So I've really
changed my mind."</TE>
<TE>   McKay, 80, will not be asked during these Winter Olympics to do
live remotes from, for instance, a snowy and wind-blown downhill
course. But all involved are emphatic that his turn in Salt Lake is
no nostalgia tour.</TE>
<TE>   NBC Sports Chairman Dick Ebersol said, "This is in no way, shape
or form a trip down memory lane."</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Roberts, who joined NBC two years ago after several years at
ABC and ESPN, said, "This game is too high stakes for Dick [Ebersol]
to drop somebody out who can't pitch. I still believe that the way
Jim tells a story--well, nobody tells a story the way Jim tells a
story."</TE>
<TE>   At one NBC production meeting, McKay recalls telling those
assembled, " 'I really don't want to be the old guy going down memory
lane.' Though there will be some of that," he says now, "as it
relates to something happening [in Salt Lake].</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be a part of these Olympics from a slightly different
point of view. I can't describe it any more than that. I want to be
part of the Olympic Games in Salt Lake."</TE>
<TE>   The best evidence that this is so is that McKay does not, under
any circumstances, need to be part of the Olympic Games in Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   He and Margaret--in her full-time working days, she was a
newspaper reporter--live a content and quiet life. If she sleeps in
while he's downstairs in the morning with some orange juice and the
paper, he gets twitchy without her after about half an hour and goes
to wake her up. He says he simply loves her company.</TE>
<TE>   He says they sometimes don't do a whole lot. They watch some TV
(sports, the news, "The West Wing" on NBC and sometimes "The
Sopranos" on HBO, though "sometimes it's too violent for Margaret.")
They dote on their three grandchildren. He said, "Someone once said
that the reason grandparents and grandchildren get along so well is
because they're united against a common enemy."</TE>
<TE>   For four decades, McKay traveled the world--millions of miles for
ABC and, especially, "Wide World of Sports." McKay was the first U.S.
network sports commentator to visit mainland China; in 1991, he
interviewed Fidel Castro in Cuba. In recent years, he has hosted
ABC's coverage of the British Open golf tournament and thoroughbred
racing's Triple Crown.</TE>
<TE>   McKay has long admired many golfers and jockeys. "For one thing,"
he said, "they're almost always in beautiful surroundings." For
another, "The athletes--by which I mean the golfers and the
jockeys--have no yearly salary. They earn what they get."</TE>
<TE>   From all the miles and through all the years, the most indelible
memory, of course, is Munich.</TE>
<TE>   For 16 agonizing hours, as Sept. 5, 1972, crept into the next
morning, McKay anchored ABC's ongoing coverage of the kidnapping and
murders.</TE>
<TE>   A little-known fact is that McKay was stuck wearing a pair of wet
bathing trunks under his pants. He'd gone swimming on the morning of
Sept. 5 and dashed to the studio when he got word of what
happened--not even taking time to change.</TE>
<TE>   Never was McKay's dedication to his craft more evident than during
that long day and night.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing was, you were concentrating on doing your job," he
recalls. "Yes, I felt the emotion. I felt it very much. But my job
was to report on the facts and not report anything not true."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was also motivated by the knowledge that one of the 11
hostages was American-born--David Berger, a weightlifter, whose
parents were in the Cleveland suburb of Shaker Heights. They had to
be watching ABC, McKay said, desperately seeking news of any sort
about their son's fate.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going to be the guy who tells his family whether he's alive
or dead," McKay said. "That was on my mind all day."</TE>
<TE>   At one point, a report flashed over the news-service wires that
the hostages had been freed. ABC could not secure confirmation and
never ran that report.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the opposite turned out to be true--after a firefight at
a military airport near Munich, all the hostages were dead. This is
how McKay reported it:</TE>
<TE>   "We've just gotten the final word. When I was a kid, my father
used to say our greatest hopes and worst fears are seldom realized.
Our worst fears have been realized tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "They have now said that there were 11 hostages. Two were killed
in their rooms this morning--excuse me, yesterday morning. Nine were
killed at the airport tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "They're all gone."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Lampley, who began his broadcasting career in 1974 with ABC
and in Salt Lake will work his 11th Olympics, said McKay's reporting
from Munich marked nothing less than a "major communications
advance."</TE>
<TE>   "What Jim accomplished in Munich was the triumph of the realist
amid the worst possible story and circumstances--to be able in a
compassionate, sympathetic way to tell the kind of story that
American sports fans didn't want to hear or connect to, and do it in
a way that we all understood it and felt it as deeply as he did."</TE>
<TE>   McKay said, "The only thing, thinking back, that embarrassed me
and still does, it shouldn't, but it does--the biggest forward push
my career ever got was the tragedy in Munich. It doesn't feel good
that the thing that helped you the most was one of the worst
disasters, still is, that ever happened in sport."</TE>
<TE>   McKay's work in Munich won him two Emmy awards--one for sports,
one for news. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Academy
Hall of Fame. Last year, he was given the Paul White Award by the
Radio and TV News Directors Associates; previous winners include
Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite.</TE>
<TE>   It's normal for McKay to downplay his achievements. Lampley and
others said McKay is personally quite shy.</TE>
<TE>   "Jim is an introvert, naturally shy, largely embarrassed by
tribute or credit," Lampley said. "But he is intensely proud of what
he's done and intensely proud of the journalistic disciplines he
learned as he began his career ... that produce objectivity,
detachment, something on the order of real truth.</TE>
<TE>   "He believes very strongly he's followed that road with faithful
self-discipline and that's something in which he takes great pride."</TE>
<TE>   McKay said he hates cocktail parties--is no good at small talk.
Margaret, he said, once gave him advice about how to get through
them: "Jim, when you can't think of something to say about somebody,
interview them."</TE>
<TE>   As much as he hates the small talk, however, he loves the
encounter, the connection with other people. And the thrill of
discovery. Which, he said, reminded him of a story.</TE>
<TE>   One time, years ago, he had been dispatched to Switzerland to
cover a skiing event. When it ended, he and a young production
assistant went to Zurich to stay the night. The next morning, they
took a taxi to the airport, and as they headed down a main boulevard,
the young assistant asked McKay, why do you keep doing turning your
head?</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'I'm just looking down the side streets.' And then I
thought, that's what we do. We don't just look down the main
boulevards."</TE>
<TE>   McKay paused in the telling of the tale, drew a breath and made it
plain he still thinks of himself as the cub reporter he was long ago
at the Baltimore Evening Sun, long before he got into TV, making $35
a week, $28.50 after taxes, just a humble guy searching for the
truth: "We look down the side streets. And we see."</TE>

<DH>The Miracle Now Is Trying to Find Mark Pavelich, Who Has
Passed Up Previous Reunions</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Small lakes dot the northern woods of Minnesota, blue specks on the
map, too many to count, and beside one of them Mark Pavelich lives
happily ever after. Far from the sport of hockey that brought him
acclaim. Far from the world and its commotion.</LD>
<LD>   "Just the wild and his wife and his dog," a friend says. "He moved
out there for a reason."</LD>
<LD>   Once in a while, he visits the nearby town of Lutsen for groceries
or someone spots him driving his truck on a back road, headed for a
fishing spot perhaps. Few know the exact whereabouts of his cabin.</LD>
<TE>   So when a reporter calls--after getting the unlisted
number--Pavelich is polite but guarded. Mostly "ums" and "ahs"
followed by silence. The conversation quickly moves to that night in
Lake Placid, N.Y., against the Soviet Union, more than 20 years ago,
when he collected the puck along the boards and slid it in front of
the net.</TE>
<TE>   "The past is the past," he says.</TE>
<TE>   That puck ended up on the stick of teammate Mike Eruzione, who
scored to give the U.S. squad an upset over the USSR on the way to a
gold medal at the 1980 Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The "Miracle on Ice" still ranks among the nation's greatest
sporting moments and, in many ways, Pavelich was symbolic of the
American team. An underdog because of his small frame. Selfless and
hard working. Quietly fierce. In the years since, he has become
something else: A mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Some of his teammates have basked in the enduring spotlight,
playing in celebrity golf tournaments, getting paid as motivational
speakers. Others have kept in touch by phone, gathering in small
groups for dinners or golf vacations, bonded by their experience.
Pavelich has kept to himself.</TE>
<TE>   The players now hope he will come to their biggest reunion yet.
With the Winter Games back on American soil--and patriotism in
vogue--they have been invited to play an exhibition Friday at Staples
Center, the day before the NHL All-Star game. It will mark the first
time in two decades all of them have gathered. All, perhaps, but one.</TE>
<TE>   "We may have to send one of those drone planes or Global
Positioning Satellites to find him," former defenseman Ken Morrow
says of Pavelich.</TE>
<TE>   They might have to kidnap him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not being aloof," says Bill Baker, another former teammate.
"You've just got to know Pav."</TE>
<TE>   Lutsen sits snug against Lake Superior, two hours north of Duluth,
almost to the Canadian border. Even in this town, remote as it is,
the man and his ways are noteworthy.</TE>
<TE>   "People are always talking about him," a local named Doc Rose
says. "How's he doing and what's he doing."</TE>
<TE>   Rose is among the few who have been shown the way to Pavelich's
cabin a dozen miles off the highway. He is a retired trainer for the
Minnesota North Stars--the NHL team that moved to Dallas--and has
known Pavelich for years. He recalls when the player moved to Lutsen
in the late 1980s after playing professionally in New York, of all
places.</TE>
<TE>   Pavelich bought a townhouse by the shore, but, as Rose explains,
"he went into the bush as soon as he got a chance," trading his home
for a parcel of forest land, moving into a garage with only a couch
to sleep on. From there, he set about building a cabin.</TE>
<TE>   "One board at a time," Rose says. "Nothing extravagant but
well-built. And you'd have a heck of a time finding it."</TE>
<TE>   There is fishing in the lake outside his door and small game to
hunt in the woods. Asked about his home, Pavelich says only that
"there's a lot of stuff to do other than hockey."</TE>
<TE>   Not that he's a recluse. Several houses stand nearby. Friends who
know the way are met with a friendly welcome and perhaps a fish
dinner cooked on the outdoor grill. Still, the place is secluded
enough that whenever Rose stops by, he feels as if he is intruding.
And visitors, especially acquaintances from New York, come away
wondering how Pavelich survives out there.</TE>
<TE>   The question should be: How did he survive in the bright lights
and big cities?</TE>
<TE>   He was born in nearby Eveleth, in rugged country known as the Iron
Range, where boys learn to hunt and fish from an early age. The town
claims to have the world's largest hockey stick at 107 feet long, so
they also learn to play.</TE>
<TE>   Pavelich was small for the game, never growing taller than 5 feet
8, but all those childhood days on outdoor rinks molded him into a
clever skater and stickhandler. "A throwback player who could control
the puck like he had it on a string," says Baker, who grew up nearby
in Grand Rapids.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1970s, those skills made Pavelich one of the greatest
players in the history of the University of Minnesota Duluth. They
subsequently earned him a spot on the Olympic team.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of the American players and their coach, Herb
Brooks, came from Minnesota. The others were from Wisconsin, Michigan
and Massachusetts, sworn rivals on the ice. Yet from this group
emerged a close-knit bunch, Pavelich playing the quiet one.</TE>
<TE>   "I've known him since high school and he was always a man of few
words," Baker says. "You never know what he's thinking."</TE>
<TE>   He earned respect with his work ethic and a knack for passing the
puck. Former goaltender Jim Craig recalls him as "an honest man, just
a wonderful guy to be around."</TE>
<TE>   Little was expected of the Americans that winter, their coach
reportedly telling them before the Olympics it would take some luck
to win a bronze. But after an opening tie against Sweden, they rolled
to four consecutive victories against the likes of Norway and Romania
to reach the medal round against the powerhouse Soviets.</TE>
<TE>   Pavelich played an essential, supporting role that night,
assisting on two of the four goals. Two days later, the U.S. defeated
Finland to win the gold medal, and Pavelich wound up with six assists
in the seven Lake Placid games.</TE>
<TE>   The players became overnight heroes, appearing on television,
visiting the White House, attending promotional events across the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of commotion," Pavelich says. "I tried to avoid it as much
as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Then he signed with the New York Rangers and moved to Manhattan.
The team photo shows a young man with shaggy hair and heavy features,
his lips pressed together in only the faintest semblance of a smile.
He claims to have enjoyed his time in New York, taking in the sights
of the city, but teammates recall he wasn't much for the nightlife.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd rather do his job and be gone," says Baker, who joined his
pal in New York for a season. "He'd rather go to the corner bar, have
a few beers and talk to the old-timers than go to Studio 54."</TE>
<TE>   On the ice, Pavelich scored 76 points as a rookie--still a team
record--and led the Rangers the following season with 37 goals, five
of them in a memorable game against the Hartford Whalers. Though such
numbers surely established him in the league, he retired after only
five seasons because of differences with a new coach.</TE>
<TE>   There would be flickers of comebacks, a dozen or so games with the
North Stars and San Jose Sharks, but his career was basically over.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty easy," he says. "I just stepped away from it."</TE>
<TE>   The players who reunite at Staples Center this weekend like to
joke that Eruzione made a career of his historic goal. That includes
two decades of working as a broadcaster, speaking at corporate
meetings and playing in celebrity golf tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Olympics ended, Mike and I ... thought we could have
some fun with this for a year, maybe two," his agent, Bob Murray,
says. "In our wildest dreams we never thought he'd still be doing
this."</TE>
<TE>   Craig, too, gets hired as a motivational speaker.</TE>
<TE>   "It was more than a hockey game," he says. "I've learned over the
years how much this meant to people."</TE>
<TE>   But for Pavelich, those two weeks in Lake Placid seem distant. He
describes himself as "kind of retired" and says a couple of years
have passed since he last wore a pair of skates. Rose guesses he
saved enough money from his playing days to live simply and
comfortably, often fishing for his dinner. There is little need for
nostalgia.</TE>
<TE>   So he has skipped every reunion, large and small, save for the
wedding of former teammate Steve Christoff. Even those players who
live within a few hours' drive of Lutsen say they have not seen him
in years.</TE>
<TE>   "I call him to see how he's doing," says Phil Verchota, now a bank
executive in Willmar, Minn. "He's just private. He doesn't like
social functions."</TE>
<TE>   His teammates hoped he would make an exception for a golf vacation
they arranged in South Carolina two years ago. They left a plane
ticket for him, and Baker, now an oral surgeon in Brainerd, Minn.,
arrived early at the airport, eager to talk about old times.</TE>
<TE>   "I waited and waited but he never showed," he says. "I had an
empty seat beside me on the plane."</TE>
<TE>   This time, with an insurance company paying to bring the team to
Los Angeles, Pavelich is noncommittal when asked if he will come.
"Well, um ... we'll see," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Verchota, who spoke to him recently, was doubtful.</TE>
<TE>   The players say they will be disappointed if he does not attend,
but also admit to getting a certain amount of enjoyment from his
reticence. They joke about him being a hermit. They speculate about
him chasing Bigfoot.</TE>
<TE>   And, in more serious moments, they suspect he isn't so mysterious
after all.</TE>
<TE>   "He could care less about the limelight," Craig says. "He just
lives his life and is happy ... all of us should be that courageous."</TE>

<HD>Open-Space Measure Clears Assembly</HD>
<DH>Legislation: The bill, if approved by the state Senate and
governor, would allow a Ventura County vote on a tax to buy
undeveloped land.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A measure that would allow Ventura County voters to create an
open-space district cleared the state Assembly on Tuesday on a 66-8
vote.</LD>
<LD>   If approved by the state Senate and Gov. Gray Davis, the bill by
Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) would give county
residents the option of taxing themselves to buy undeveloped land for
permanent preservation.</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Supervisors would write the ballot initiative, which
probably would appear on the March 2004 ballot.</LD>
<TE>   County interest in creating an open-space district has been high
since 1998, when 68% of voters indicated they supported the concept.</TE>
<TE>   Less clear is whether a majority of voters are willing to pay for
it through a sales tax increase or property tax assessment.</TE>
<TE>   Such a program is meant as a long-term successor to the county's
SOAR anti-sprawl policies, which begin to expire in 2020.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, the Legislature must sign off on county ballot
measures that would impose a tax. Jackson last year agreed to carry
the enabling legislation, then withdrew it after Supervisor Judy
Mikels surprised her by lodging opposition at the state level.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Mikels, who is facing a challenge in the March 5 primary
election, reversed course. Three weeks ago, she joined her colleagues
in voting to back the measure.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Board of Supervisors came on board unanimously, that
sure helped us," Jackson said. "Ultimately, I think everybody came
together to do what's best for the community."</TE>

<HD>Smith's Future a Hot Topic</HD>

<AU>Sam Farmer and Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Some people are suggesting St. Louis Ram defensive coordinator Lovie
Smith would be a good fit to fill the Tampa Bay vacancy.</LD>
<LD>   Ram defensive end Chidi Ahanotu isn't one of those people.</LD>
<LD>   "I said, 'Hey, Tampa's going to be knocking on your door,' and he
just laughed," said Ahanotu, who played for the Buccaneers when Smith
coached linebackers there. "But I don't think Lovie's going to take
that job. I know Lovie, and I don't think that's the right fit for
him. He's wanted this for a long time, but I don't think he wants to
follow that mess that happened down there."</LD>
<TE>   Tony Dungy, the most successful coach in Tampa Bay history, was
fired two weeks ago after losing to Philadelphia in a wild-card game.</TE>
<TE>   He compiled a 54-42 record in six seasons, and made the playoffs
four of the last five seasons. He was recently hired as coach in
Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "Lovie's very loyal," Ahanotu said. "He has love for Tony Dungy.
He has love for all the assistant coaches out there. And I don't
think he's going to side with the owners, per se, and bail them out
of this."</TE>
<TE>   Ahanotu said he was "sick and angry" about the firing of Dungy by
the Buccaneers, who most recently interviewed Baltimore defensive
coordinator Marvin Lewis to replace him.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very low class," Ahanotu said. "I'm at a loss for words,
because I was there when things were really bad. The new owners [the
Glazer family] brought so much promise. They looked like stand-up
guys. Tony's a class act, through and through. He just didn't deserve
that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the fourth time since 1991, there is only a week between the
conference title games and the Super Bowl. Normally, there's a
two-week gap.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little different this year," said Ram safety Kim Herring,
who played for the champion Ravens last season. "We had two weeks
last year. It took a lot of the pressure off. This year we had one
day. It was like, 'OK, guys, we're going to the Super Bowl, and we're
leaving tomorrow.' You just have to make all your arrangements in a
matter of two days.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little different, but a lot of these guys played on the
'99 team [which got one week]. They understand what's going on, so
it's just a matter of getting everyone else up to speed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New England kicker Adam Vinatieri on his game-winning field goal
against Oakland in a blizzard in the Patriots' divisional playoff
game:</TE>
<TE>   "I've dreamed a lot of times about kicking game winners in playoff
games and in Super Bowls, but in all of my dreams I'm sure there
wasn't three or four inches of snow on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ram quarterback Kurt Warner, who has had to overcome bruised vocal
cords, lower-back soreness and an aching ribcage, said he's on the
mend.</TE>
<TE>   "Compared to the last three weeks, it's better than it has been,"
he said. "Really, I'm over everything. The ribs are still a bit sore,
having just played two days ago. But they feel better than at any
time last week."</TE>
<TE>   Sam Farmer</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not that this is going to be a bow-wow Super Bowl or anything, but
... the first carnival parade to hit New Orleans streets Sunday night
after the conference championship games was the Barkus parade
featuring hundreds of costumed dogs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Knee-Slapping Bill Belichick Quote Of The Day:</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether he thought the Patriots' good special teams
could decide the game, Belichick elicited a demeaning little laugh
and said, "Yeah, if we can ever get them to punt."</TE>

<LD>Bob Ryan of the Boston Globe writes that the "Rams have the greatest
offense the game ever has known." He was referring to today's St.
Louis Rams.</LD>
<LD>   However, another Ram team, the L.A. edition of 1950, might have
been even better. That Ram team averaged 38.8 points during the
regular season compared to 31.4 for the St. Louis Rams.</LD>
<LD>   The modern Rams have such celebrated offensive stars as
quarterback Kurt Warner and running back Marshall Faulk and are deep
at wide receiver. The 1950 Rams had four Hall of Famers, quarterbacks
Bob Waterfield and Norm Van Brocklin and ends Elroy Hirsch and Tom
Fears, along with such notable running backs as Tank Younger and
Deacon Dan Towler.</LD>
<TE>   Which would you choose?</TE>

<TE>   Trivia time: Which NFL team has the best Super Bowl record?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rose Red redux: Tom FitzGerald in the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Mike Tyson's Connecticut mansion is off the market, according to the
Wall Street Journal. It was originally priced at $22 million in 1998,
then $12.9 million in 1999 and $5 million in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe potential buyers were turned off by the sign out front:
'Come on in--I won't bite you.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Revising history: Syndicated columnist Norman Chad: "I am firmly
convinced that, had instant replay existed in 1776, the American
Revolution would have been overturned and we'd all be eating kidney
pies at this moment."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Chad: On the replay call that wrecked the Raiders: "Geez, the
next time I'm charged with tax fraud by the IRS, my defense will be
the Tuck Rule."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's coming: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle on the
same subject: "The ground can't cause a fumble.</TE>
<TE>   "Now a tuck can't cause a fumble. Pretty soon quarterbacks will be
able to recover fumbles through the Acts-of-God clause on their
homeowners insurance."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sounds fishy: Mike Bianchi in the Orlando Sentinel: "My operatives
tell me that that the reason 'the Tuna,' Bill Parcells, turned down
Tampa Bay is because the Buccaneers' contract stipulated he do three
shows a day at Sea World."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tired whine: Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "I'll take
537: What is the over/under on how many times between now and Super
Bowl Sunday we hear New England players say, 'We don't get any
respect.'?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Potential problem: From comedy writer Jerry Perisho: "The New
England Patriots have a strong safety named Lawyer Milloy. You know
there's going to be trouble when you've got a guy named Lawyer on the
team.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Rams are called for illegal use of hands, they may not
only get a 15-yard penalty, they may get a subpoena and a court
date."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1983, the Washington Redskins
defeated the Miami Dolphins, 27-17, in Super Bowl XVII before a
record crowd of 103,667 at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The San Francisco 49ers, 5-0.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bernie Lincicome in the Rocky Mountain News: "The
basic difference between a sportswriter and a sports-talker is that
one wishes he could write the Great American novel and the other
wishes he could read it."</TE>

<DH>Girls' basketball: Cougars' 61-38 win gives Bulldogs their
first three-game losing streak.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Three-point baskets are nothing unusual for the Ventura girls'
basketball team, which has made 195 this season.</LD>
<LD>   But the Cougars hung a different kind of three on Ventura Buena on
Tuesday night in a 61-38 Channel League victory at Buena.</LD>
<LD>   No. 10 Ventura (20-2, 5-0 in league) handed No. 15 Buena (13-8,
3-3) its third consecutive loss for the first time in Buena's
31-year, 780-game history.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just awesome," Ventura's Jenni Dooley said of the victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars, who defeated Buena, 63-43, on Jan. 8, swept their
crosstown rival for the first time in 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars, on pace to break the Ventura County record of 234
three-pointers they set last season, made 10 of 17 attempts from
behind the arc Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Caitlin O'Neill, averaging seven points a game, made four
three-pointers and finished with 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   "She picked a nice time to kind of come out of her shell," Coach
Ann Larson said.</TE>
<TE>   Dooley and Katy O'Brien each scored 13 points and combined for
five three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney LaVere, who has committed to Notre Dame, had 29 points,
11 rebounds and five blocked shots for Buena.</TE>
<TE>   She scored her team's first 17 points and scored all of the
Bulldogs' points in the first, third and fourth quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura must win two of its final three league games to clinch its
first outright Channel League championship since 1976. Buena, which
began the season with a 311-11 all-time league record, must win its
last two league games and hope for three Ventura losses to extend its
streak of 13 consecutive league titles.</TE>

<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Elton Brand sounded more disappointed than upset at not being
selected Tuesday as a reserve on the Western Conference All-Star
team.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't complain," said Brand, who has averaged close to 19
points and more than 10 rebounds in his career and failed to be
selected as an all-star in his three seasons. "It's like a ref making
a call. It's over. You move on."</LD>
<LD>   Brand said he felt no extra motivation to make a statement Tuesday
against the Dallas Mavericks.</LD>
<TE>   Still, he had 23 points and 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't prove anything by going out there and scoring 28
points with 15 rebounds because I've already done that," he said
before helping the Clippers to a 117-100 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Brand figures he'll use the time off to "be with my wife and
kids."</TE>
<TE>   Then he paused and laughed, "Oh yeah, I don't have a wife and
kids."</TE>
<TE>   Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry was every bit as disappointed as Brand.</TE>
<TE>   "A guy misses 20 games and they put him on there," Gentry said,
referring to Chris Webber of the Sacramento Kings, who was sidelined
by an injury earlier this season. "Chris Webber is a great player,
but I just don't see it. If that's the way they're voting, then why
isn't Michael Finley [of Dallas, who returned Tuesday from a
hamstring injury] on the team?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Corey Maggette suffered a strained left knee and is not expected
to play Thursday against the San Antonio Spurs, the third stop on the
Clippers' seven-game trip. He is scheduled to undergo an MRI exam
today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Facing a choice of signing Eldridge Recasner for the rest of the
season or letting him go, the Clippers decided to part company.
Recasner's second 10-day contract ran out Tuesday. Keyon Dooling is
not yet fit to play, having been out since suffering a sprained left
ankle Nov. 14, and Gentry said the team is exploring other options
until he's ready.</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: After losing to Dallas by 21 points on
Saturday at Staples Center, L.A. goes on the road and hands the
Mavericks a 117-100 loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Back at you, Mavericks.</LD>
<LD>   Considering what the Dallas Mavericks did Saturday to the Clippers
at Staples Center and what the Clippers did to themselves Monday
against the Grizzlies at Memphis, a comprehensive victory over the
NBA's hottest team didn't figure Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   As they have shown again and again this season, the Clippers are
anything but predictable.</LD>
<TE>   Fun, exciting, young, sure, but predictable?</TE>
<TE>   Not just yet.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people in Vegas lost money tonight," Coach Alvin Gentry
said after the Clippers ended the Mavericks' seven-game winning
streak with a 117-100 victory before a sellout crowd of 19,948 at the
American Airlines Center.</TE>
<TE>   That the Clippers won on the road, in their second game in as many
nights, was one thing. That they won after being routed in the fourth
quarter of a 133-112 loss to the Mavericks in L.A. and after
bickering among themselves on the court during a 119-115 overtime
loss against the Grizzlies was quite another.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, it was only the Clippers' fourth road victory in 19 games.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what Tuesday's performance says about his team, Gentry said,
"That we're a young and inconsistent team. We're trying to get to the
point where we can be consistent.</TE>
<TE>   "When we stay together, we're pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Standing together, through good times and bad, was a topic of
discussion Tuesday afternoon for Gentry and point guard Jeff McInnis.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry benched McInnis for the final 3:50 of regulation and all of
overtime Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Neither would divulge many details about what was said other than
that they spoke for an hour and cleared the air. The meeting did
wonders for McInnis' confidence and he scored a season-best 31
points, making 12 of 21 shots, including five of six three-point
baskets.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis also outplayed Steve Nash, his Dallas counterpart, and
lifted the Clippers when they needed him most. McInnis had 13 points
in the fourth quarter; Nash had 22 by game's end, but did not score
in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis made a three-point basket to give the Clippers a 107-100
lead with 2:28 remaining. Dirk Nowitzki missed an 18-foot jump shot
at the other end. McInnis then finished the Mavericks with a
three-pointer and two free throws, igniting a 13-0 closing run for
the Clippers (23-23).</TE>
<TE>   "I was much more relaxed," said McInnis, who earned a spot in
Gentry's doghouse by yelling at the referees while Memphis point
guard Brevin Knight raced down court to score an easy basket in the
third quarter Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been a lot of things going on and I got a chance to
air things out. I came out with a clear head. You and the coach can't
be at odds. [Monday] night, I just wanted to be in the game. I play
fiery. Everybody knows that about me.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people might look at that in a negative way."</TE>
<TE>   Publicly, Gentry has been one of McInnis' biggest supporters.
However, Gentry was critical of his point guard after Monday's game,
when McInnis had only two points in the second half and the Clippers
squandered a 12-point halftime lead en route to their fifth
consecutive overtime loss.</TE>
<TE>   Said Gentry: "There's a lot more to being a part of a team than
just having ability on the court.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to have the people out there that I think will give us
the best chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry did not hesitate in starting McInnis against the Mavericks,
however.</TE>
<TE>   "As I said to him, 'I'm going to play you 40 minutes a game.
Obviously, I've got confidence in you,'" Gentry said. "We spent some
time together. He said some things. I thought he had some valid
points."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, all the Clippers played better Tuesday than Saturday
against Dallas or Monday against Memphis. They defended better,
handled the basketball better and maintained their poise better.</TE>
<TE>   Although they trailed, 52-49, at the half, the Clippers grew
stronger in the third and fourth quarters. Unlike Saturday's game,
when Dallas pulled away with a 20-0 run late, the Clippers never let
the Mavericks get rolling. Dallas shot 45.6% as opposed to 57.6%
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're growing as a team," Gentry said. "We're getting better and
I'm proud of the way the guys played. To come back here and win by 17
and to hold them to 33 points less than the other night, it's a great
win for our guys."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Lost Treasures of NFL Films--Vol. 17: Super Bowls
VIII-XIII"</LD>
<LD>   Where: ESPN Classic, tonight, 7</LD>
<TE>   NFL Films digs into its vast film archive--the world's largest
sports film library--and puts together a show that looks back at
Super Bowls VIII-XIII, the latest in a series produced from hundreds
of hours of retrieved footage that was never aired.</TE>
<TE>   "As we looked at the footage, it reminded us just how much the
Super Bowl grew from 1974 and 1979," says series host Steve Sabol,
the president of NFL Films.</TE>
<TE>   The 1974 game was played at Rice Stadium in Houston, and the Miami
Dolphins defeated the Minnesota Vikings, 24-7. NFL Films caught up
with one of the stars of the game, Dolphin defensive tackle Manny
Fernandez.</TE>
<TE>   The next Super Bowl was played in New Orleans, but because the
Superdome was under construction, the game was played at Tulane
Stadium. This time, the Vikings were beaten by Pittsburgh. Featured
is Steeler defensive end Dwight White, who spent Super Bowl week in
the hospital with viral pneumonia, played in the game, then went home
and spent another week in a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The next year the Steelers won again, defeating the Dallas
Cowboys, and the Steelers' Lynn Swann was the MVP. But NFL Films
chose to feature Cowboy receiver Golden Richards, who was tracked
down in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   The 1977 Super Bowl was the last one played entirely in daylight.
It was held at the Rose Bowl, where the Oakland Raiders defeated the
Vikings. An interesting tidbit came when NFL Films tried to shoot
Raider coach John Madden, who was camera-shy and shooed the cameraman
away.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't do those things," Madden says.</TE>
<TE>   Featured is Raider defensive tackle Dave Rowe, but not for reasons
you might think. Rowe is brought back to NFL Films' headquarters in
Mt. Laurel, N.J., and shown there is a conference room named after
him. That's because four employees named Dave have their offices all
in a row. Well, actually, one of the four is Suzanne Morgan, but she
has changed her name to Suzanne "Dave" Morgan in order to fit in.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers a Bit Closer to Deal With Ishii</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lengthy negotiating session between the Dodgers and the agent for
pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii failed to produce any significant results
Tuesday, but the Japanese left-hander's representative seemed far
more encouraged than he did last Tuesday, when he feared Ishii would
not play in Los Angeles this season.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm just a little more optimistic today than I was last week,"
said Joe Urbon, Ishii's agent. "Though there was very little
movement, I felt [Tuesday] was a positive because of the tone of the
conversation and their effort to understand where we are. At least
they're willing to be creative and think of ways to close the gap."</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers' latest offer is believed to be in the three-year,
$8-million range, up from the team's first two offers of $6 million
and $7 million for three years. Urbon is believed to be seeking a
deal in the three-year, $14-million range.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers bid $11.26 million for the rights to negotiate with
Ishii, an amount that will go to the Yakult Swallows, Ishii's
Japanese team, if Ishii signs with the Dodgers by the Feb. 8
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Urbon said Ishii would like the situation resolved by early next
week so the pitcher can finalize plans to  join the Dodgers in Vero
Beach, Fla., by Feb. 14 or to begin spring training with the Swallows
on Feb. 10.</TE>

<LD>The Mighty Ducks have a season-high four-game win streak. There are
lasting smiles around the dressing room for the first time this
season.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, even winning brings problems, even if they are nice ones to
have.</LD>
<LD>   Defenseman Niclas Havelid and forward Kevin Sawyer spend their
days working in practice and watching during games. Havelid had
played well, but was taken out of the lineup when the pain in Jason
York's right shoulder subsided enough to allow him to play.</LD>
<TE>   That was seven games ago. Coach Bryan Murray would like to get
Havelid a game, but he also doesn't want to tinker with four games'
worth of success.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel bad because he played well when he was in," Murray said.
"Unfortunately he got taken out of the lineup, when Jason was ready
to come back.</TE>
<TE>   "Kevin Sawyer is the same way. But with those two we have a couple
guys that if something happens, we can put them in and they're
players."</TE>
<TE>   Nor, Murray said, is there anything wrong with other players
knowing that they can be replaced.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the guys understand that if you don't play hard, you
might not be in the next night," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Among goalies who have played at least 20 games, the Ducks'
Jean-Sebastien Giguere is second to Colorado's Patrick Roy in
goals-against average (2.07) and ranks fourth in save percentage
(.921).</TE>

<LD>Santa Ana Mater Dei and Fullerton Rosary have been favored to win the
Serra League girls' basketball title the last two seasons, but for
the second year in a row, Santa Margarita is the team that will hang
a banner.</LD>
<LD>   The Eagles, ranked No. 22 by The Times, used hot shooting and took
advantage of cold shooting by its opponent to clinch the title with a
52-25 victory over No. 23 Mater Dei on Tuesday night at Santa
Margarita.</LD>
<LD>   Going into the fourth quarter, when the reserves cleaned up, Santa
Margarita (19-3, 5-0) held a 48-11 lead.</LD>
<TE>   Mater Dei (19-5, 2-3) did not reach double-figure scoring until 3
minutes 20 seconds remained in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Monarchs made five of 46 shots though three quarters--a little
less than 11%.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our defense deserves a little credit for that," said
Santa Margarita's Garland Cooper, who scored 14 points and had seven
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei shot 41% as a team going into the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything like that in 10 years," Mater Dei Coach
Geri Campeau said. "That's really not our team."</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei's top scorers, Amy Sanders and Ashley Voisinet, scored
only two points apiece. Jen Rogers scored a team-high eight points,
all in the fourth quarter.</TE>

<HD>At Pebble Beach, It's Always Weather or Not</HD>
<DH>Golf: Frigid conditions greet early arrivals, but it's
expected to improve a little for the weekend as Love defends title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK,</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PEBBLE BEACH</DL>
<LD>It was 40 years ago at this tournament, when it was called the Bing
Crosby National, that snow, hail, rain and sleet stopped play on the
last day.</LD>
<LD>   So there were something like gusts of nostalgia blowing stiffly
through the Del Monte Forest on Monday when it snowed and hailed,
thus signaling the official start of tournament week at the AT&amp;T
Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.</LD>
<LD>   Defending champion Davis Love III can easily recall the worst
weather he has experienced around here.</LD>
<TE>   "Yesterday," Love said Tuesday, wrapped up snugly in a blue
windbreaker. "It hailed on us twice."</TE>
<TE>   Chances are, it's going to be good weather for the rest of the
week, but tell that to Tiger Woods, who defrosted his clubs so he
could play nine practice holes early at Spyglass Hill and then quit
because of flu-like symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   The weather forecast actually looks surprisingly encouraging
through the weekend, which would be nice for everyone concerned,
including Peter Jacobsen.</TE>
<TE>   The 1995 champion, Jacobsen managed to hold the title for two
years, basically because there was no tournament in 1996 because rain
allowed only two rounds to be played. It would have been the same in
1998, but Phil Mickelson triumphed when the rain-delayed final round
was played in late August.</TE>
<TE>   For his lunch Tuesday, Jacobsen took refuge at a covered picnic
table outside the front door of a deli near the Lodge at Pebble
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Said Jacobsen: "Not only do I know what to eat, more importantly,
I know where to eat."</TE>
<TE>   Love recalled the 1990 tournament when gusts of 40 mph kept
blowing the flagsticks out of the holes at Cypress Point and play was
suspended with eight pros still on the course. Presumably, they all
made it back in alive.</TE>
<TE>   Love says he's used to it all by now, thanks to experience and
filling his bag with foul weather gear. "We've played wet and sloppy
and rainy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Now we're going to see if they can play it differently. The huge
pine tree in the middle of the 18th fairway is no longer around. It
was recently cut down.</TE>
<TE>   The tree's gone, but Love's back on the one-year anniversary of
what can only be called an unexpected championship.</TE>
<TE>   Love started the last round seven shots behind Mickelson and Olin
Browne, tied with five others for 14th place. But Love got it going,
and in a hurry. He needed only 20 shots to play the first seven
holes, including holing a wedge from 108 yards for an eagle on the
second hole at Pebble. Love shot a 28 on the front nine and was eight
under par through seven holes, tying the best birdie-eagle streak in
PGA Tour history.</TE>
<TE>   Love finished one under on the back, signed for a nine-under 63,
then waited 45 minutes to see if anybody could catch him. Mickelson
came close. He birdied the 16th and 17th and needed to birdie the
closing hole to force a playoff, but when he gambled on reaching the
green at 18 with two drivers, his second one went into the water.</TE>
<TE>   Vijay Singh was gone when he hit his tee shot into the ocean at
the 17th. Love wound up with a one-shot victory over Singh, with
Mickelson two shots back.</TE>
<TE>   Before the round began, Love said he saw no reason to count
himself out, especially because Woods had come back from seven shots
down with seven holes to go and won the year before.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know what one day or one round or one shot is going to
mean to you," said Love, who turns 38 in April. "So I always try to
turn it into a positive and I was trying to convince myself that I
had a chance to win. ... I just got off to a great start, obviously a
great start, and just kept it going."</TE>
<TE>   The next week at Torrey Pines, Love tied for second, losing with
Frank Lickliter in a playoff with Mickelson. And two weeks later at
the Nissan Open, Love led by three shots after 54 holes only to
falter with a 75 on Sunday and fall to a tie for eighth.</TE>
<TE>   That was still enough for Love to pick up the $500,000 bonus for
being the best player on the West Coast Swing. He finished the year
No. 5 on the money list with $3.169 million--the best of his 16-year
career.</TE>
<TE>   Last week at the Phoenix Open, Love went eagle-birdie to make the
cut, then shot six under on the weekend and wound up earning $24,933.
As he says, you never know what that one round is going to mean to
you.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe this week, there will be some more clues ... weather
permitting, of course.</TE>

<LD>Owners Bob and Beverly Lewis have won the Kentucky Derby twice in the
last five years, winning a thriller with Silver Charm in 1997, then
winning two years later with longshot Charismatic.</LD>
<LD>   Prince Ahmed bin Salman, the man behind The Thoroughbred
Corporation, missed out on a Derby victory last year when Point Given
inexplicably ran his worst race of the year. But the talented colt
redeemed himself in the Preakness and Belmont Stakes.</LD>
<LD>   Today's fifth race at Santa Anita could help determine whether the
Lewises and Salman have more Triple Crown prospects.</LD>
<TE>   True Monarch, a $325,000 yearling purchase by the Lewises in
September 2000, and Puerto Banus, a $345,000 buy last year by Salman,
will try two turns for the first time in the mile race against five
other 3-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Bob Baffert, True Monarch faded to 11th of 12 in his
debut on Santa Anita's opening day on Dec. 26 after pressing the
early pace from an inside post.</TE>
<TE>   Brought back less than three weeks later, the son of Maria's Mon
was reserved a couple of lengths off the pace by jockey Gary Stevens,
was carried a little wide into the stretch by eventual runner-up Fall
For Me, but went on to win impressively by three lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Now, we'll see if True Monarch is up to handling more distance. He
certainly has continued to train well, turning in 1:12 and 582/5
drills in the last nine days.</TE>
<TE>   Also trained by Baffert, Puerto Banus didn't figure to win
sprinting first time out. A son of Supremo and a half-brother to the
multiple-stakes winning mare Spain, he rallied strongly in the
stretch to win by a head at 15-1 after breaking slowly and racing
wide. Like True Monarch, Puerto Banus has trained well since the
victory. He again will be ridden by Victor Espinoza.</TE>
<TE>   The field for the race, which carries a $54,000 purse, is
completed by Raven Power, a son of Known Fact who beat maidens by two
lengths in a promising debut; Azillion, a new face from England who
won one of three overseas; Gold Dollar, a Wayne Lukas-trained son of
Seattle Slew who has won one of nine; longshot Cable Ready, and
Pelirrojo, a late-running gray who also should improve around two
turns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The seventh is a sprint scheduled for the turf
that drew a sharp F J's Pace, European import Munjiz, Islander, who
has four grass victories, and the comebacking Skip To The Stone, who
will be making his first start for Baffert.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Jeff Mullins. The trainer, who won at a 25% rate last
year, is keeping up that pace at Santa Anita. He has won with seven
of his first 28 starters and will try for another win with Joe
Holiday in today's sixth race.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  Corey Nakatani. The rider, who led the standings at
this meet during the 1999-2000 season, is three for 61 through the
first 25 days.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  An exacta box in the fourth using Fin
Entertainment, Hezacatseye and Cintegrity.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous Day/Meet Total: 3/73. Money: Previous Day/Meet
Total: $19/$473.60. Total money bet: $428.</TE>

<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Craig Johnson and the Kings breathed a sigh of relief when the winger
did not suffer a more serious eye injury after taking a high stick
from Vitaly Vishnevski of the Mighty Ducks in a 4-2 King victory Jan.
15.</LD>
<LD>   As if to celebrate, Johnson returned to the lineup Monday after a
two-game absence and scored two goals in a 6-4 victory over the
Colorado Avalanche.</LD>
<LD>   "I was real lucky," said Johnson, who suffered a corneal abrasion
and bleeding behind his right eye. "I was looking to the left and his
stick got me more to the outside of the eye, but it got me right in
the eye....</LD>
<TE>   "It could have been a lot worse. I was lucky enough that the
bleeding stopped [after a few days] and they didn't have to do laser
surgery."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's two-goal effort against the Avalanche was the third of
his career, his second this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess my legs were a little fresher than normal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While the Kings have turned their season around over the last
eight weeks, defenseman Jere Karalahti has mostly served as a
cheerleader, having sat out all but four of the last 28 games despite
being injury-free.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now Jere's suffering from the fact our team has played
pretty good hockey for about 25 games in a row," Coach Andy Murray
said. "You don't shift things around too much when that happens."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An MRI taken Tuesday on Mathieu Schneider's left shoulder revealed
a strain, the original diagnosis after he left Monday's game in the
first period, and the defenseman's status was listed as week to
week.... Eric Belanger underwent successful surgery on his left wrist
and is expected to be sidelined for eight weeks.</TE>

<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Mark Madsen went most of his life believing he could dance, believing
he looked a lot like the person across from him at his school events.</LD>
<LD>   Then came the championship parade, and the footage of that, and
Madsen couldn't miss it on the news, and that's when he knew.</LD>
<LD>   "It helps to get a visual of something," Madsen said in all
seriousness, "so you can understand where people are coming from."</LD>
<TE>   Before that, he said, "People would laugh a lot. But I figured I
was a little off beat."</TE>
<TE>   It swelled finally to Monday, when the leader of the free world
dissed Madsen's moves.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush asked him to dance, and Madsen nearly did.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what's funny?" he said before Tuesday night's game
against the Atlanta Hawks. "I tried to dance and nothing came out. I
thought, 'Oh-oh, nothing's coming. I better step back.'"</TE>
<TE>   Madsen has kept his sense of humor for these seven months.</TE>
<TE>   He has not danced a lot in public, but he gets a lot of requests,
and he always laughs.</TE>
<TE>   And, from the moment on stage after the parade, the Forrest Gump
moments have kept coming.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea what was going to happen with that," he said. I was
doing what I always do at dances, which is normal."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson voted for Vlade Divac over Karl Malone for the
Western Conference All-Star team. Without Divac, West Coach Don
Nelson's team has one center: Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   All-Star Dirk Nowitzki is tall enough to be a center, but doesn't
play there much, and certainly not against the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, Dallas did a whole PR bit on that, but that's BS," Jackson
said.</TE>

<TE>   Update--Lindsey Hunter played only 18 minutes against Atlanta
because of a stiff lower back that developed late last week. Coming
out after halftime, Hunter said, "I was so tight I couldn't even
move." ... Derek Fisher came out of a mild shooting slump by making
eight of 13 shots, including four of seven three-points attempts. He
scored 20 points, 14 in the second half. ... The Lakers are 3-5 in
the second of back-to-back games.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Stay at Proper Level</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: For once, they don't play down to their
opponent, as lowly Hawks are routed, 127-93.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The Lakers played through the least of their midseason issues Tuesday
night.</LD>
<LD>   That is, that they sometimes lose to lousy basketball teams. It is
what it is, a competitive tic that has become more of an annoyance
than anything contrary to their three-peat wishes. They typically
shook their heads, took one final look at some last-place team or
another dancing away, and moved on, pretty sure that was the last of
it.</LD>
<LD>   It kept happening though, five times in all, which led them here,
to a last-place team in spirit, if not yet in reality.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers defeated the dreadful Atlanta Hawks, 127-93, at a dead
Philips Arena, and they are 1-1 on a five-game trip with many miles
ahead. They beat the Hawks the way they should beat a poor team,
convincingly, as though the game interested them, as though their
defense was worth the effort.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant scored 32 points, 20 in the first quarter, in 27
minutes. Shaquille O'Neal scored 23 in 26 minutes, despite a toe
malady that continues to concern club officials. They are considering
plans that would keep his minutes very short at the All-Star game, or
that would keep him away from the game altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, huge leads--12 points in the first quarter, 28 in the
second and 40 in the fourth--kept O'Neal off his feet for the final
15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't speak to reporters after the game, a practice to which
he has pretty much clung for more than two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson said O'Neal looked OK to him, and,
indeed, O'Neal made 10 of 13 shots, though he barely was challenged
by Nazr Mohammed and a Hawk frontcourt that lacks injured center Theo
Ratliff. Again, as the Lakers did to the Hawks, O'Neal performed as
he should have against the NBA's overmatched.</TE>
<TE>   When Jackson spoke before the game about a Laker slump that had
become six defeats in nine games, due largely to holes in their
shooting, defense and rebounding, he pointed in part to O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "All of it revolves around Shaquille's mobility," Jackson had
said. "His activity level right now is limited.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't all fall on his shoulders, [but] there are some things
I'd like to see us do that we're not able to do right now. With Shaq
in the lineup we're not able to run, we aren't able to chase balls
down as quickly. Those are things we'd like to do. And I'm going to
watch him tonight, because he was tender after the game on Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps due to O'Neal's limitations, and definitely due to the
Hawks', Bryant went out dynamically on offense. He made 10 of 12
field-goal attempts in the first quarter, then made his first two
shots in the second quarter. The Hawks tried Jacque Vaughn, Jason
Terry and Ira Newble, without effect, and Bryant reached halftime
with 26 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going at them a little bit," Bryant said. "They had a
little guard [Terry] playing me, so I made it a point to post up and
be a little more assertive to start the game."</TE>
<TE>   He was, at times, sensational, as he was two weeks ago, when he
scored 56 points against Memphis.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost amazing," Laker forward Samaki Walker said, "for the
simple fact guys can't figure a way to stop him. It's amazing. I'm
searching for one way to describe it. I can't.</TE>
<TE>   "You do get caught up in watching it. It's a show."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had 68 points at halftime, a season high, then 102
after three quarters, also a season high. Bryant did not play the
first 7:36 of the second quarter, and the Lakers ripped off an 18-0
run, from a 32-24 lead to 50-24. They made 16 of 24 shots in the
first quarter and 12 of 21 in the second, and coasted from there,
with Bryant highlights sprinkled in.</TE>
<TE>   "We had Kobe going tonight. I had to sit him down to stop him,
really," Jackson said, smiling a little. "He was going like crazy.
And we took advantage of their small guard corps and it set a tone
for the game."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers carry their few issues like car keys. Used to be, they
lugged them like anvils. Like last season, when they lost here to
another abysmal Hawk team, the Lakers have had their moments of
distraction. It does not appear to bother them, as they perhaps are
warmed by last season's playoff run.</TE>
<TE>   Still, this business of losing to unworthy teams ...</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't really an emphasis," Walker said. "As men, we knew what
we had to do tonight. There were no excuses for not winning this
game. Not only that, there was no excuses for not beating them the
way we did."</TE>

<HD>Chargers Hand the Reins to Schottenheimer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In hopes that a disciplinarian can rescue a floundering franchise
that has not been to the playoffs in six seasons, the San Diego
Chargers on Tuesday hired veteran NFL coach Marty Schottenheimer to
replace the low-key Mike Riley.</LD>
<LD>   And in remarks bristling with intensity, Schottenheimer made clear
that he expects the Chargers, who have won only six games in the last
two seasons, to become immediate contenders.</LD>
<LD>   "I've never been inclined to talk about rebuilding programs,"
Schottenheimer said. "I'll tell you one thing: we have one goal. That
goal is to win a world championship and we're not afraid to talk
about it."</LD>
<TE>   For openers, Schottenheimer said he plans for veteran Doug Flutie
and second-year player Drew Brees to compete for the quarterback job.
In one of his more controversial moves, Riley stuck with Flutie when
the team suffered through a nine-game losing streak after starting
the season 5-2.</TE>
<TE>   Schottenheimer was fired Jan. 14 as coach of the Washington
Redskins. He was replaced by former University of Florida coach Steve
Spurrier.</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins opened at 0-5 but closed at 8-8 in Schottenheimer's
only season.</TE>
<TE>   In 10 seasons at Kansas City and four at Cleveland,
Schottenheimer's teams won six division titles but never appeared in
a Super Bowl. That goal, Schottenheimer said, is what attracted him
to the San Diego opening.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ask me to describe what I do in one word it's this:
teach," he said. "I live vicariously through those players on the
field. They do things I could not do as a player myself [in six
seasons with the Baltimore Colts, Buffalo Bills and Boston Patriots]
because I didn't have the stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Although terms of the contract were not released, Schottenheimer,
58, will reportedly receive $4.5 million to $5 million in the first
three years of his contract and $2.5 million in the fourth year.</TE>
<TE>   Although known to prefer the running game, Schottenheimer joked
that, "One time in my career I'd like to have the chance to throw 50
passes a game for an entire season, but I'm not sure how many games
we'd win."</TE>
<TE>   In Schottenheimer, owner Alex Spanos has hired a coach with more
NFL experience than his four predecessors combined: Bobby Ross, Kevin
Gilbride, June Jones and Riley.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning is everything in our business," said Spanos. "Today we're
hiring a winner."</TE>
<TE>   Dean Spanos, team president and son of the owner, said the
Chargers had talked to Schottenheimer in past years but never made an
offer.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Perry</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jay Hayes was fired as the Pittsburgh Steelers' special-teams
coach after a season-long series of breakdowns capped by two
touchdown-producing misplays in the AFC championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes was the only assistant let go, though coach Bill Cowher gave
offensive coordinator Mike Mularkey and quarterbacks coach Tom
Clements permission to talk to other teams.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, Troy Edwards, once considered the Steelers' star
receiver of the future, was one of five players left unprotected for
the Feb. 18 expansion draft.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the Steelers' list were fullback Jon Witman, long snapper
Mike Schneck, offensive lineman Roger Duffy and wide receiver Will
Blackwell.</TE>
<TE>   Steeler running back Jerome Bettis will skip the Pro Bowl because
of the groin injury that sidelined him for all but one of the final
seven games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Houston Texans hired former Florida defensive coordinator Jon
Hoke as their defensive backs coach.</TE>

<HD>Change Is Good for Devils</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Constantine's reputation as a strict disciplinarian jolted the
New Jersey Devils to play scared--and win.</LD>
<LD>   Constantine, behind an NHL bench for the first time since Dec. 9,
1999, did little more than furrow his brow, chew gum and cross his
arms in his coaching debut with New Jersey, yet the Devils showed
renewed zip Tuesday night in a 3-1 victory against the New York
Islanders at Uniondale, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe his reputation made us more worried about what's going to
happen to us, or what's going to happen to the team if we don't do
what he says," said Bobby Holik, who scored New Jersey's third goal.
"But it's still just the first game. We have a long way to go to be
where we want to be."</LD>
<TE>   The Devils responded well to Constantine, hired to replace
nice-guy Larry Robinson, who was fired Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Constantine, 43, said he would simply observe the Devils for a few
games before instituting his coaching schemes, but he did stress
defense before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys were blocking shots who had never blocked a shot before in
their life," captain Scott Stevens said.</TE>
<TE>   Constantine also asked the team to play hard, but that was it.</TE>
<TE>   "If you give too much out on the first night, you can paralyze
people," Constantine said.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey moved into a tie with Montreal for the eighth and final
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Kip Miller scored for the Islanders, who retain the sixth spot,
one point ahead of the idle New York Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   "When you make a coaching change sometimes the players want to
impress their new coach," Islander defenseman Adrian Aucoin said.
"Sometimes the players are fighting for their jobs. ... It's natural
for them to give a little extra."</TE>
<TE>   The Devils were still stunned from the firing of Robinson and
assistants Slava Fetisov, the Russian Olympic coach, and Jay Leach.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still going through the change," Holik said. "Larry and
Slava, you will not find two better guys in all of hockey, as human
beings.</TE>
<TE>   "It was traumatic. I still feel responsible, as every player
should."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, Pittsburgh 2--Keith Primeau scored a tying goal
with 17.5 seconds to play in regulation and Marty Murray won it early
in overtime at Philadelphia. The Penguins had their six-game winning
streak snapped.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 2, Buffalo 2--Bates Battaglia scored his 18th goal with
9:48 left and Carolina rallied twice at Raleigh, N.C. It was a
league-high 20th overtime game for Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Barrasso, one of three U.S. Olympic goaltenders, started for
Carolina but left less than nine minutes in because of a strained
groin.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 4, San Jose 3--Bryan McCabe had two goals and an assist
for the Maple Leafs at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Jonas Hoglund and Travis Green scored for the Maple Leafs. Todd
Harvey scored two goals for the Sharks.</TE>

<LD>Pete Sampras is back on the U.S. Davis Cup team, a year after saying
he doubted he would play in the event again.</LD>
<LD>   Sampras was selected Tuesday for the team that will play a
first-round match next week against Slovakia. He is joined by Andy
Roddick, Todd Martin, Mardy Fish and James Blake.</LD>
<LD>   Team captain Patrick McEnroe said he didn't have to do any
arm-twisting to get Sampras, who will play in his 15th Davis Cup
series but his first since April 2000.</LD>
<TE>   "I actually had a lot of discussions with Pete last year and I
felt he wanted to play Davis Cup at different points last year,"
McEnroe said.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras, 30, and Roddick, 19, are expected to play singles, with
the doubles team probably coming from among the other three players.</TE>

<HD>NBC Gets Close to a Sellout</HD>
<DH>Television: Network nears its goal in advertising revenue
and expects to dominate ratings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Randy Falco, the president of NBC and the chief operating officer for
the network's Olympic coverage, said Tuesday that the network is very
close to its goal of $720 million in advertising revenue for the
Winter Olympics that begin Feb. 8.</LD>
<LD>   "We are 98% sold out and should hit our goal in the next several
days," Falco said from Salt Lake City in a televised conference call.</LD>
<LD>   Falco said the $720 million is 40% higher than the advertising
revenue generated by the last Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, in
1998, televised by CBS. He also said it's higher than what NBC's
Summer Games at Atlanta in 1996 brought in.</LD>
<TE>   "And we had a third more prime-time hours in Atlanta," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There will be 31/2 hours of prime-time coverage nightly from Salt
Lake City, rather than the five hours NBC offered from Atlanta and
Sydney, Australia, in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's Salt Lake City coverage will be live in most of the country
but delayed in the West.</TE>
<TE>   NBC will spend about $645 million on production.</TE>
<TE>   Figuring other costs, the network should realize a profit of
$60-65 million, which, according to Falco, is close to the profit for
Sydney and Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "To provide a perspective of what the Olympic Games mean to NBC,
we will have the top 10 most-watched TV events during the 17 days [of
the Games]," Falco said .</TE>
<TE>   "There will be 180 million unique viewers during the Games, with
two-thirds of all Americans tuning in to some portion.</TE>
<TE>   "We will dominate in prime time, winning every day and winning
every hour, which is pretty extraordinary.</TE>
<TE>   "To give you a sense of the weight of the Olympic Games, it's akin
to having seven Super Bowls during that time."</TE>
<TE>   The Super Bowl, which will be televised by Fox on Sunday, is
expected to generate $200-225 million in advertising revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Although this Super Bowl has been a tough sell and Fox has had to
give some advertisers a discounted rate, John Nesvig, the head of
sales for Fox, said the game is expected to sell out before the end
of the week.</TE>
<TE>   Falco said NBC took two surveys, asking viewers about their intent
to watch the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "One survey was taken shortly after Sept. 11 and the other was
taken only a few days ago," he said. "What both showed is that 80-90%
of all Americans intend to watch the Olympics, and those are the kind
of numbers we were getting leading up to Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "The best part is that the numbers for the 18-34 age group were
the same as those for older groups, and that is a terrific story for
us."</TE>
<TE>   Falco said that with the Olympics as a lead-in, NBC-owned stations
and network affiliates will get a 40% boost in viewership for their
local newscasts.</TE>

<HD>Bledsoe's at Head of the Class</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>His coach had lied to him. His resume had abandoned him. His body had
betrayed him.</LD>
<LD>   It was the end of the worst week of his worst year, and surely
Drew Bledsoe was going to blow.</LD>
<LD>   Walking off the Foxboro Stadium field after a New England victory
over the New Orleans Saints in late November, the demoted quarterback
passed a horde of fans.</LD>
<TE>   One of them, a 7-year-old boy named Alex Greenberg, strained his
little body over the concrete wall for a handshake.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe inexplicably stopped. Would this be it? Would this pesky
kid give the Pro Bowler the final push? Would there be a scene?</TE>
<TE>   The boy stretched out his hand.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe refused to slap it.</TE>
<TE>   He stuck a football in it instead.</TE>
<TE>   Later, that ball sitting proudly on his bedroom dresser, the boy
penned a thank-you letter complete with a portrayal of his favorite
quarterback in stick figures.</TE>
<TE>   "Bledsoe," the boy wrote, "you rule."</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe, you do indeed.</TE>
<TE>   When Bill Belichick announces his starting quarterback today for
Sunday's Super Bowl against the St. Louis Rams, I don't want him to
pick the guy who is 13-3 as a starter.</TE>
<TE>   I want him to pick the backup.</TE>
<TE>   I don't want him to pick the guy who threw 18 touchdown passes.</TE>
<TE>   I want him to pick the guy who threw three.</TE>
<TE>   I don't want him to pick that new fashion named Tom Brady.</TE>
<TE>   I want him to pick that old shoe named Bledsoe.</TE>
<TE>   "Me, too," said Bledsoe with a grin. "Of course I want to start.
Are you kidding me?"</TE>
<TE>   But he won't. No way. Belichick would sooner smile.</TE>
<TE>   The starter will be Brady, sore ankle and all. It will be the
coach's favorite player, not the coach's biggest threat.</TE>
<TE>   And you know something? It won't matter.</TE>
<TE>   Because Bledsoe is already one of the MVPs of this Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve months after the nation's biggest sports event was plagued
with trash talk and thuggery, Bledsoe has given it a renewed sense of
dignity.</TE>
<TE>   To a silly week filled with empty growls, Bledsoe has brought back
grace.</TE>
<TE>   During Super Bowl media day last year, reporters cringed at the
lack of remorse from Ray Lewis, a rising star who had sped from the
scene of a murder.</TE>
<TE>   This year, they swooned at a fallen star who has run from nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "You face choices all the time," Bledsoe said. "You have to decide
whether to do the right thing, or the wrong thing."</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, in an occurrence as rare as a touchdown not
followed by a spike, Bledsoe chose honor.</TE>
<TE>   You know the story. It is still one worth sharing.</TE>
<TE>   Two games into this, his ninth season, Bledsoe was speared by the
New York Jets' Mo Lewis and suffered a sheared artery near his heart.</TE>
<TE>   He lost more than half of his body's blood. Without the proper
transfusion equipment, he might have died.</TE>
<TE>   His recovery required two months. During that time, backup Tom
Brady took an 0-2 team and won five of eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Also during that time, Belichick told Bledsoe that when he was
sound, he would have a chance to win his job back.</TE>
<TE>   On the Monday before the Patriots' Nov. 25 game against the New
Orleans Saints, Bledsoe was officially sound.</TE>
<TE>   Just in time for Belichick to announce that Brady would be the
starter for the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "That move could have torn the team apart," recalled receiver
David Patten on Tuesday. "Are you kidding me? Something like that, we
could be sitting home out of the playoffs, and they could still be
talking about it."</TE>
<TE>   But only if Bledsoe talked about it first.</TE>
<TE>   Only if Bledsoe, like many other modern athletes, griped and
complained and undermined the team that had seemingly turned its back
on him.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, with a $100-million contract, you would think it would be
easy for him to shut up. But it's never easy for any professional
athlete to throw away an ego that has helped him succeed.</TE>
<TE>   A demoted quarterback crying? It has happened before. In the dance
of starters and backups, it happens every week..</TE>
<TE>   Did you know the last San Francisco memories of Joe Montana
involved his petty sideline undermining of new starter Steve Young?</TE>
<TE>   Because Bledsoe will surely be traded this spring, it could have
been the same thing here.</TE>
<TE>   But the quarterback talked to his wife, and father, and friends.
Then he made the most difficult call of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided to step back, because it was the right thing for the
team,'' he said. "It wasn't easy. It wasn't my first inclination. I'm
not good at this. But I felt I had to think of the team."</TE>
<TE>   His first day in front of the media after the demotion, he said he
was looking forward to winning "my job back."</TE>
<TE>   Then he said no more.</TE>
<TE>   For the rest of the regular season and the first round of the
playoffs, as Brady took advantage of Belichick's safe offense and led
the Patriots to seven consecutive victories, Bledsoe said nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters tried to corner him. Television folks tried to catch
him. All of Boston strained to hear him.</TE>
<TE>   Still, nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "He stayed so classy, it was unbelievable," said third-string
quarterback Damon Huard. "Nine years as a starter, and yet he didn't
show any bitterness."</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe's locker is next to Brady's. When the media horde showed
up at the youngster's feet after games, crowding Bledsoe as he tried
to dress, the quarterback quietly disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't like the decision, I didn't agree with it, but I
couldn't be selfish," Bledsoe said. "At some point, I felt I had to
subjugate myself to the team."</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe acknowledged Tuesday that his relationship with Brady has
changed. But Brady said the former starter has been as helpful as
ever.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he wants to play and he knows I want to play," Brady said.
"The fact of the matter is we both have to be ready to play."</TE>
<TE>   You know what usually happens when an athlete is unselfish. You
know where this is going, right?</TE>
<TE>   "Like they say," Patten said. "Those who humble themselves shall
be exalted."</TE>
<TE>   And so it came to pass last week in Pittsburgh, late in the second
quarter of the AFC championship game, Brady sprained his ankle.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in four months, Belichick looked at Bledsoe
with something other than a scowl.</TE>
<TE>   For the umpteenth time during that span, Bledsoe simply shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "I grabbed the ball, asked for the play, and ran on to the field,"
he said. "That's what I do. That's who I am."</TE>
<TE>   His first play was a 15-yard completion. His third play was a
10-yard completion.</TE>
<TE>   His fourth play was an 11-yard touchdown pass to Patten that
eventually gave the Patriots a 14-3 lead and insurmountable momentum.</TE>
<TE>   He ended the afternoon, and perhaps his season, by leading the
team to a 24-17 upset victory.</TE>
<TE>   After which he grabbed the same kind of football he once handed to
a 7-year-old kid, dropped to his knees, and wept.</TE>
<TE>   "To finally get an opportunity to come back on the field, then to
come out on top, it was a very emotional thing," Bledsoe said.</TE>
<TE>   As a reward, today he will probably be sent back to the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   A benchwarmer. A scrub. A star.</TE>

<LD>Milner Resigns Position With El Toro Football</LD>
<LD>   Mike Milner, football coach at El Toro the past 11 years, has
resigned his position but will continue to teach physical education
at the Lake Forest school, he said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Milner said he wants to spend more time with his family.</LD>
<TE>   "I have a 12-year-old son," Milner said. "I missed his first home
run and his second home run in winter ball because I was coaching. I
don't want to miss his third and fourth home runs."</TE>
<TE>   Milner served as Fountain Valley's coach for 12 seasons before
taking over at El Toro. In 23 seasons, his teams have made four
appearances in Southern Section finals, winning twice. He has also
won six league championships in the Sunset and Sea View leagues.</TE>

<LD>Good thing for Rialto Eisenhower that the Southern Section boys'
basketball playoffs don't start for another two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   It may take the Eagles that long to figure out how to move the
ball past midcourt late in a tight game after they nearly collapsed
in the fourth quarter of a 73-65 Citrus Belt League victory Tuesday
over visiting Fontana Miller.</LD>
<LD>   With the win, Eisenhower, No. 4 in The Times' rankings, clinched
at least a tie for its third consecutive league title. But the Eagles
(20-2, 7-0 in conference) shouldn't count on advancing deep in the
playoffs unless they correct the ragged ball handling that plagued
them Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   After building a 15-point lead midway through the fourth quarter,
Eisenhower committed six consecutive turnovers against Miller's
full-court press as the Rebels (18-6, 4-3) went on an 11-0 run to
pull within 64-60.</TE>
<TE>   Eagle forward Sean Marshall made two free throws to end the run,
but Miller guard Victor Michel made a three-point basket to make it
66-63 with about a minute left.</TE>
<TE>   That was as close as the Rebels would get as Marshall, who
finished with a game-high 30 points, converted five of six free
throws in the final 47 seconds to secure the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to cut [turnovers] down if we want to keep winning
because the good teams later on could capitalize," Marshall said.
"All we have to do is concentrate."</TE>
<TE>   Cory McJimson added 16 points for Eisenhower.</TE>
<TE>   Miller guard Jeremiah Ward scored 13 of his team-high 26 points in
the first quarter as the Rebels took an early nine-point lead. The
Eagles chipped away at the deficit and went ahead for good when John
Shields made a lay-in just before the buzzer ended the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower Coach Steve Johnson said his team's ball-handling
problems were a result of too many recent blowout victories.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned more tonight than with the 30-, 40-point victories
we've been putting on teams," Johnson said.</TE>

<HD>Ram Defense Makes Its Case</HD>
<DH>A Year After Being One of League's Worst,   the St. Louis
Unit Is a Major Part of Success</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>The cries of no respect don't work anymore. They ring hollow. After
the St. Louis Ram defense put together two fabulous performances--a
rout of the Green Bay Packers and a stifling of the Philadelphia
Eagles--its players are afforded rock-star status.</LD>
<LD>   Reporters crowded around defensive end Grant Wistrom's interview
kiosk Tuesday, whispered about the chances of first-year defensive
coordinator Lovie Smith getting a head-coaching job, and didn't even
mispronounce the last name of defensive tackle Jeff Zgonina
(ska-NEE-na, if you've gone without football the past two Sundays).</LD>
<LD>   So what was middle linebacker London Fletcher griping about?
Cornerback Aeneas Williams was the team's only defensive player to
make the Pro Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   "We took that as a slap in the face for our defense," said
Fletcher, who led the Rams in tackles the past three seasons. "It was
an insult."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so, but the Rams are running short on inspirational
kindling. The football world now understands they are very deserving
of their third-place ranking, especially after forcing eight
turnovers--including three interceptions returned for touchdowns--in
a 45-17 victory over the Packers.</TE>
<TE>   The New England Patriots certainly took note.</TE>
<TE>   "We know they've got a lot of team speed," said Patriot
quarterback Tom Brady, who will find out today [at least publicly] if
he's starting Sunday. "Now we're playing them on AstroTurf, and
they're going to be even faster."</TE>
<TE>   Only a year ago, the Ram defense was as gushy as the Superdome
turf. St. Louis gave up 471 points, the seventh-most in NFL history,
and sank to 23rd in the rankings. The unit looked thoroughly
apathetic in a 31-28 playoff loss to the New Orleans Saints, who
scored a field goal and four consecutive touchdowns before Kurt
Warner &amp; Co. scored three to make the final score respectable.</TE>
<TE>   For some Rams, it was downright nauseating.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember looking up at the Jumbotron and actually feeling sick
to my stomach," Zgonina said. "We had a chance, and we blew it again.
To watch the effort--not running to the ball, not making plays, just
shutting it down--it makes you sick."</TE>
<TE>   That was before Coach Mike Martz hired Smith from Tampa Bay,
promoting him from linebackers coach to defensive coordinator, and
Smith brought the Buccaneer scheme with him. Among the changes, he
appointed eight new starters and built the defense around lighter,
quicker players.</TE>
<TE>   In Smith's system, the Rams do very little "two-gapping," which
requires defensive linemen and linebackers to control offensive
linemen and come off either side of the block to make a tackle.
That's better suited for bigger players. Instead, he asks his front
seven to push upfield right away. That requires more instinct than
intellect.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle D'Marco Farr, who spent seven seasons with the
Rams and was at media day as a Fox reporter, said quick players love
that philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   "See ball. Get ball," Farr said. "It's that simple."</TE>
<TE>   Simple, maybe. But not many opponents have figured it out. The
Rams gave up 273 points during the regular season--198 fewer than a
year before. They also had nine more takeaways and forced 15 more
three-and-outs.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Patriots start Brady or Drew Bledsoe,  the quarterback
is sure to feel the intense pressure Brett Favre and Donovan McNabb
felt in the first two playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   "It won't make much of a difference with either one [Brady or
Bledsoe] starting," Fletcher said. "We've gone into games before when
we didn't know who the starting quarterback was going to be. We
played Atlanta earlier in the season and didn't know if Chris
Chandler or Michael Vick would be starting."</TE>
<TE>   The much-quicker Vick started that game and the Rams sacked him
seven times on their way to a 31-13 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Improving the defense was the No. 1 priority. Not only did St.
Louis use its first five draft picks on defensive players--three
chosen in the first round--it brought in respected veterans such as
Williams from Arizona, safety Kim Herring from Baltimore, linebacker
Mark Fields from New Orleans and defensive end Chidi Ahanotu from
Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   One of the things that Smith does to keep his players on their
toes is count "loafs," the number of times they give
less-than-maximum effort. He can spot those by studying game video
and searching for players who change speeds depending on close they
are to the ball. If they can shift gears like that, they aren't going
full speed all the time.</TE>
<TE>   "We just think that's something you can control," Smith said. "We
may get there at a different pace, but we can all do it 100%. Yes,
that's the first thing we look at. Sometimes, we don't look at
technique but we always grade pursuit. We just won't put up with
anything but that."</TE>
<TE>   Smith would love a loaf-free game, of course, but he has yet to
witness one. He said one per player is an acceptable per-game
average. Still, each loaf requires offenders to practice longer.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, there are no more practices after the Super Bowl.
Players on both teams know well that loafing now could cost them a
ring.</TE>
<TE>   Wistrom's inspiration is simple. He needs only to think back a
year to the plane ride after the playoff loss to the Saints. He
stared out the window the whole way home and thought about what might
have been.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, the only reason we weren't in the Super Bowl was
because of our defense," he said. "This year, we wanted to be part of
the solution and not the cause of the problem."</TE>

<HD>Security Efforts Make This Game One of a Kind</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Outside the Superdome Tuesday afternoon, city workers sawed off the
tops of trees.</LD>
<LD>   They weren't cutting off dead limbs. They were clearing space for
FBI sharpshooters.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday's Super Bowl XXXVI is the first sporting event in U.S.
history to be designated a National Special Security Event. There
have only been 11 other National Special Security Events--things like
presidential inaugurations and United Nations gatherings.</LD>
<TE>   But in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, the Super
Bowl, and, starting next week, the Olympics, have become the focus of
the most massive security efforts ever undertaken in conjunction with
sporting events in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Superdome resembles an onion, with layers of fences and
barriers protecting the arena and the surrounding streets. No cars
will be allowed within three blocks of the dome. The Superdome
parking garage and its 5,000 spaces will be closed as of Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   It's just as well, because starting today, the five main roads
nearest the stadium will be either partially or totally closed. The
Superdome exits and entrances from Interstate 10 will also be closed.</TE>
<TE>   Banned from the dome will be: umbrellas, coolers, backpacks,
strollers, any bag bigger than a purse, binocular and camera cases,
camcorders, cameras with lenses longer than six inches and diaper
bags (unless you can also produce the baby.)</TE>
<TE>   Also on the taboo list are Frisbees, banners, noisemakers, bottles
and cans, and that favorite accoutrements of the well-dressed
football fan--the big, foam No. 1 finger. There were many sighs of
relief when the Green Bay Packers were eliminated because no federal,
state or city agency wanted to tell Packer fans that foam Cheeseheads
would not be allowed. Californians will be distressed to know that
beach balls are also banned.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,000 security people will be in place in and around the
Superdome for the game Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Security forces have conducted mock drills imitating every
imaginable disaster that might happen, even trying to simulate the
sudden onset of a mysterious illness striking thousands of people
inside the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The teams were warned that any player with an outstanding arrest
warrant would not be allowed into the dome, and any player or owner
who is used to being accompanied by a bodyguard carrying a weapon
would need to become unused to having a weapon-wearing bodyguard.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to protecting the Superdome, a total of 48
agencies--including the Secret Service, FBI, Louisiana National Guard
and local police--must protect the hotels housing the St. Louis Rams,
the New England Patriots, NFL officials and more than 3,000 media
representatives. They must also protect the streets of the French
Quarter where hundreds of thousands of fans celebrating  the Super
Bowl and Mardi Gras will walk day and night for the next five days.</TE>
<TE>   "Compared to previous Super Bowls," said Milt Ahlerich, NFL vice
president of security, "the measures we've taken to protect the
players and the fans have not increased a little bit. They have
increased by huge degrees of magnitude."</TE>
<TE>   When the Super Bowl was designated a National Special Security
Event, the responsibility for coordinating security measures was
taken out of the hands of local law enforcement and given to the
Secret Service. And Mike James, U.S. Secret Service special agent, is
the man in charge.</TE>
<TE>   Superdome gates will be opened five hours before the game Sunday.
James urged fans to arrive when those gates open. There will be three
security points where people will be searched.</TE>
<TE>   "The best scenario," James said, "is if a person arrives carrying
only his ticket."</TE>
<TE>   There will be hand searches and the same sort of magnetic security
wands travelers find at airports. Anyone carrying electronic items
such as cell phones or pagers will be subject to longer, more intense
checks. "Please," Ahlerich said, "on this one day, leave your cell
phone at home."</TE>
<TE>   There will be a no-fly zone over the Superdome on Super Sunday.
Only fighter jets will be seen in the sky above the game.</TE>
<TE>   There will be SWAT teams, FBI agents and state troopers, both in
uniform and out, walking through every hall, catwalk and corridor
inside and outside the arena. There will be sharpshooters with
trained eyes encircling the outside of the Superdome.</TE>
<TE>   One security official at the dome Tuesday said, "My best advice?
Come early, come naked."</TE>
<TE>   He was kidding, but not by much.</TE>
<TE>   It is not only the arena that is going to watched. The U.S. Coast
Guard and U.S. Customs Service as well as the New Orleans Harbor
Police are charged with securing dozens of miles of Mississippi
riverfront filled with cargo ships.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to send a strong message," New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial
said, "that New Orleans is the safest place in America."</TE>
<TE>   Morial strongly disputed the results of a CNN study publicized
last week that categorized the readiness of 30 big U.S. cities in the
event of a terrorist attack. New Orleans was listed as one of the six
cities considered least prepared for such an event.</TE>
<TE>   "The methods that were used in the study," Morial said, "were
misleading. New Orleans is one of the most prepared places."</TE>
<TE>   Ahlerich said there was "nothing" that would cause the Super Bowl
to be canceled: "We've been planning this, literally, since Sept.
12."</TE>
<TE>   There have been fears that the homeland defense security forces
will be stretched too thin with the Salt Lake City Olympics so close
to the Super Bowl. The Secret Service and FBI must also coordinate
the Olympic security measures.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, after touring Utah Olympic
venues last week, expressed  concern about security outside the
Olympic venues and approved the addition of another 50 federal
security agents.</TE>
<TE>   James declined to comment on whether the homeland defense forces
are overburdened.  "I can't comment on the Olympics," James said. "I
am comfortable with the plans made for the security of the Super
Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   The security message--stay alert--is being repeated over and over,
whether it's for cab drivers and limo drivers or armed state troopers
who are patrolling the team hotels for the first time in history.</TE>
<TE>   Ahlerich, the NFL vice president for security, gave the teams a
safety briefing Monday evening.</TE>
<TE>   "The players listened attentively," he said. "That hasn't always
been the case."</TE>

<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>My Super Bowl Diary: Day 2</LD>
<LD>   NEW ORLEANS--So I'm standing by Adam Timmerman on Media Day at
Super Bowl 36, and there's a mob, of course, because as you can
imagine, everyone wants to know what Adam Timmerman has to say.</LD>
<LD>   It's finally my turn to pitch a question, and this little kid cuts
in front of me, sticks a Nickelodeon microphone in Timmerman's face
and demands a stare-down.</LD>
<TE>   Now if she had been taller, I'd have seen her coming and tripped
the little Katie Couric-wannabe and treated her like any other member
of the media trying to beat me to the story. But Emily Pollock, age
11, who hails from Los Angeles of all places, was short enough to
avoid early detection--taller than Doug Flutie mind you, but really
tiny and quick.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think I was wrong to say, "Scram, kid," but I was probably
lucky no one heard me because Timmerman thought the pushy kid was
cute. So now with more than 1,000 reporters groveling for a quote,
Timmerman and the little kid from L.A. were just staring at each
other--Timmerman finally announcing, "I got you," and even though I
know the media is supposed to be impartial, I cheered.</TE>
<TE>   I started to tell the guy next to me that Nickelodeon needs to get
some tougher reporters if they're gonna try something as stupid as a
stare-down when I realized it was the kid's father, Danny.</TE>
<TE>   He explained his kid had auditioned for the part of "gascaster"
back in L.A., and I nodded my head like I really cared, while writing
in my notebook a reminder to call the truancy officers and get this
kid back in school.</TE>
<TE>   This is no place for kids, especially when you have Fox's Jay Mohr
asking Marshall Faulk, "Have you ever watched Oz naked?" With no kids
around maybe he would have answered the question, and now we'll never
know.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIS YEAR'S Media Day began in the Superdome with a one-hour visit
with the Patriots, and this little Las Vegas betting line tidbit for
you. The first player to come out was quarterback Tom Brady, and not
only was he not limping, but they set it up so he had to walk to the
furthest podium at the opposite end of the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't it be something to learn later that Brady was the first
player in Super Bowl history to take a Novocain shot in his sprained
ankle to fool everyone on Media Day?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I NOTICED ESPN's Stuart Scott interviewing Damon Huard, and I knew
it was Damon Huard because he had his last name on his back and Scott
called him, "Damon." I had no idea why anyone would want to talk to
Huard, so I listened in when Scott put a mike in his face and said,
"Nobody gives you any love." I left, wishing Huard the best, because
I imagine that's what Eugene Robinson was feeling a few years ago the
night before the Super Bowl, and we know how that turned out.</TE>
<TE>   I saw Roman Phifer, who played for the Rams when I covered them in
Anaheim, and I thought it was nice of him not to run away. He's
playing for the Patriots now, but that's not what he wanted to talk
about. "You know, I had to put my UCLA jersey in the closest after
the USC game," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Me too," I said.</TE>
<TE>   I also ran into Willie McGinest, and when he grabbed my arm and
said, "Write this down: We beat UCLA in basketball and football this
year," I said, "Fight on."</TE>
<TE>   The key to Media Day is to keep moving in search of something
interesting. Running back Antowain Smith, for example, was talking
about how much his grandparents meant to him, tattooing their names
on his arm and how he knows "She's up there with me every day," so I
went looking for Plaschke so he could have something to write from
here this week.</TE>
<TE>   There was a crowd around Bryan Cox, who doesn't play much after
being hurt, but he's still liable to say anything--making him MVP
with the media.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than the day I got divorced, the saddest day of my life had
to be when the Cardinals picked up and left St. Louis," said Cox, and
I would have asked him if he grew up there, but the truant showed up
and demanded a stare-down with Cox.</TE>
<TE>   I was kind of hoping the kid would still be staring down Cox when
Wanda Sykes from HBO's "Inside the NFL" showed up, and yelled to Cox,
"You go out there and break someone's neck Sunday, honey," but the
kid had lost and was gone by then.</TE>
<TE>   After the Patriots left, the media was given two hours to eat free
food, and the Rams arrived for an hour of intensive
questions--beginning with Mohr, who asked receiver Isaac Bruce, "Are
you worried about rain being a factor in this game?"</TE>
<TE>   I have to admit, I was concerned when Bruce wasn't quick to answer
and had to look up at the roof in the Superdome for assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Mohr also got tough with Kurt Warner, holding up a Ram media guide
and pointing out that Warner had refused to divulge his middle name.
Warner came clean. "Eugene," he said, and I looked it up--Mohr's
middle name is Ferguson.</TE>
<TE>   Although I'm not allowed to write about Xxxxxxx Xxxxxxxxx, a Ram
spokesman said she wouldn't be making an appearance at Media Day, and
would be arriving in town Thursday. I don't know why the Rams think
I'd be interested.</TE>
<TE>   At that point the NFL announced Media Day was over, although I
noticed a pair of bald guys dressed in Ram jerseys, and representing
"The Rosie O'Donnell Show," still competing with the truant for one
last question. I have to say I admired the kid's moxie, and if it
wasn't past her bedtime, I don't think we'd see Barry LeBrock as host
of "The SIMERS Show" anymore.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Opponent Finds Itself in Fine Mess</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Canadians, furious after loss to Ecuador, play
Americans tonight in Gold Cup semifinal at Rose Bowl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking a page out of the 1998 U.S. Olympic hockey team's rather
besmirched playbook, Canada's national soccer team last week
allegedly trashed its locker room at the Orange Bowl in Miami.</LD>
<LD>   The players were angered by a 2-0 loss to Ecuador in which the
South Americans scored twice in the final two minutes, the second
goal on a penalty kick. The Canadians--and especially their German
coach, Holger Osieck--were furious at U.S. referee Brian Hall and
other game officials.</LD>
<LD>   Osieck's comments to officials landed him a $5,000 fine from
CONCACAF, soccer's governing body in North and Central America and
the Caribbean. The players' actions--they claimed all they had done
was knock over a chalkboard--earned the Canadian Soccer Assn. a
similar fine. Both are being appealed.</LD>
<TE>   At 8:30 tonight, Canada, the defending Gold Cup champion, plays
the United States in the semifinals of the biennial tournament at the
Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   In the other semifinal, at 6 p.m., South Korea plays Costa Rica.
Whether or not the Canadians have been further angered by the fines
imposed on them, they still present a challenge for the Americans,
U.S. Coach Bruce Arena said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know generally how they play and what they're like," he said.
"Obviously, they're very difficult to play against and they've been
very successful here.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has been able to eliminate them in this tournament in two
tries [2000 and 2002]. We're going to have quite a task on our hands.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a real physical presence. They're outstanding on
attacking restarts [free kicks and corner kicks], and that's an area
where they get their goals."</TE>
<TE>   Canada reached this point--the lone outsider among three World
Cup-bound teams--by surviving a blind draw after its first-round
group ended in a three-way tie.</TE>
<TE>   En route to the semifinals Canada defeated Haiti, 2-0, lost to
Ecuador, 2-0, and defeated upstart Martinique on penalty kicks after
a 1-1 tie in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Osieck does not accept the fact that this is largely a
second-string U.S. squad.</TE>
<TE>   "The only one who is really missing is [Claudio] Reyna in
midfield, and [Earnie] Stewart, but the rest are here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S., seeking its first Gold Cup title since 1991, got here by
defeating South Korea, 2-1; Cuba, 1-0, and El Salvador, 4-0. The
Americans hold a 9-8-7 edge against the Canadians in the all-time
series, but the teams have not met since qualifying play for the 1998
World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Arena will make one change to his roster, but did not announce it
Tuesday. Before Sunday's quarterfinal against El Salvador, he
replaced forward Jeff Cunningham and midfielder Manny Lagos with
forward Clint Mathis and midfielder Brian Maisonneuve, respectively.
Since then, forward Ante Razov has been lost to injury, and either
Bobby Convey or Brian West will be his likely replacement.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea, meanwhile, has been weakened by the return of several
players who have rejoined their club teams in Japan's J-League.</TE>
<TE>   Even without them, the Koreans were able to overcome Mexico in the
quarterfinals, albeit on penalty kicks, when goalkeeper Lee Woon-Jae
made two tremendous saves.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't complain about that [the loss of players]," said Coach
Guus Hiddink, the Dutchman who is guiding South Korea's World Cup
preparations.</TE>
<TE>   Hiddink said it gave him the opportunity "to bring into the
tournament [reserve] players who normally wouldn't get this
experience. It's good for their development."</TE>
<TE>   Costa Rica will provide the World Cup co-hosts with a serious and
useful test, in advance of their World Cup matches against Poland,
the U.S. and Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's very good to meet different styles [of play],"
Hiddink said. "Now we play a mid-American team. That's good."</TE>
<TE>   Costa Rica is seeking to become the first Central American team to
win the Gold Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The five previous tournaments have all been won by North American
countries: the U.S., Mexico and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Alexandre Guimaraes' Costa Rica team is unbeaten in the
tournament. It shut out Martinique, 2-0, and tied Trinidad and
Tobago, 1-1, before defeating Haiti, 2-1, in overtime in the
quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "It [tonight's match] will be a much different game than those we
played in Miami," Guimaraes said. "I think South Korea will be a good
opponent for us [in preparing to meet Brazil, China and Turkey in the
World Cup]."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Pasadena on Tuesday, U.S. Soccer named its four
Chevrolet athletes-of-the year for 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, the U.S. team's top goal scorer during World Cup
qualifying, was the men's winner. Women's World Cup winner and
Olympic gold medalist Tiffeny Milbrett earned the women's award for
the second year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Young athlete of the year honors went to Aleisha Cramer and
DaMarcus Beasley.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chile's soccer federation and the players' labor union set a
Friday deadline for clubs to pay off their debts, putting this
season's championship in doubt less than three weeks before the
start.</TE>
<TE>   Colo Colo, the country's biggest and most popular club, was
formally declared bankrupt by a judge Monday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Congo (Zaire) secured a place in the quarterfinals of the African
Cup of Nations by beating Ivory Coast, 3-1, and titleholder Cameroon,
which had already qualified, thrashed Togo, 3-0, in Bamako, Mali.</TE>
<TE>   After Tuesday's final Group C games, Cameroon won the group with a
maximum nine points from three matches while Congo took second with
four points.</TE>
<TE>   Togo finished third with two points and was eliminated from the
competition with Ivory Coast, which had one point.</TE>

<HD>Tyson Knocked Out of Nevada</HD>
<DH>Boxing: After athletic commission denies him in request for
license, his title fight with Lewis is up in the air.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>Las Vegas</DL>
<LD>LAS VEGAS--Refusing to give in to the economic pressure generated by
a fight worth perhaps as much as $12 million to this city, the Nevada
State Athletic Commission on Tuesday rejected Mike Tyson's depiction
of himself as a victim and voted 4-1 to deny his request for a boxing
license.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than citing Tyson's role in a brawl at a news conference
last week with heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis as a factor in the
denial, commission members focused on a lack of evidence that Tyson
has changed much since he bit Evander Holyfield's ears in a 1997 Las
Vegas fight.</LD>
<LD>   "We are all losers here," said commissioner Flip Homansky, a
former ringside physician, after casting one of the negative votes.
"There are no winners. This is not the way this chapter in boxing was
supposed to be written. What is unfortunate is that people are going
to try to pick over the remains. The issue for us is Mike Tyson's
health and welfare. This commission will not walk away from trying to
help [Tyson]."</LD>
<TE>   The former heavyweight champion wanted the license to fight Lewis
April 6 at the MGM Grand. He said he regretted his actions last week,
but quickly tried to blame others.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just an average guy," Tyson told the commission. "I'm not
Mother Teresa, but I'm not Charles Manson either. I just want you to
treat me equally."</TE>
<TE>   The lone vote in support of the former two-time heavyweight
champion was cast by Luther Mack, a businessman who serves as
chairman of the commission. The other nay votes came from John
Bailey, an attorney, Tony Alamo, a physician, and Amy Ayoub, a
political consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis-Tyson could be worth as much as $100 million with each
fighter guaranteed $17.5 million and earning perhaps as much as $10
million more off the pay-per-view revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The fight would have brought sorely needed revenue into this city,
which is still struggling to recover from the economic downturn
exacerbated by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Although Shelly Finkel, Tyson's manager, wouldn't address other
options after Tuesday's hearing at the Sawyer Building, there are
alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Staples Center had expressed an interest in the fight before the
MGM bid was accepted.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not our decision," Staples Center President Tim Leiweke said
through a spokesman when asked if the arena would still want the
match. "If the California commission were to license Mike Tyson, we
would certainly explore it."</TE>
<TE>   New York's Madison Square Garden was also involved in the bidding.
Representatives of Denmark, where Tyson's last fight was held, and
Detroit have indicated a willingness to host the match as well.</TE>
<TE>   Before any negotiations can proceed, however, Lewis must decide if
he still wants to defend his title against Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson issued a statement, saying he was "very disappointed" with
the commission's decision. "The state of Nevada is entitled to their
opinion and they have voiced it today. It is time for me to weigh all
of my options and I will act when I have reached a decision."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's hearing had been scheduled before Jan. 22 and, until
that day, it had been assumed Tyson would get his license.</TE>
<TE>   But that was a disastrous day for Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   He initiated the brawl by taking a swing at a Lewis bodyguard as
the two fighters stood on a stage in the Millennium Hotel's Hudson
Theater in midtown Manhattan. Lewis responded by throwing a punch at
Tyson and, in the ensuing melee, Lewis claimed Tyson bit him on the
thigh.</TE>
<TE>   On the same day, a Las Vegas police lieutenant, concluding an
investigation into charges Tyson sexually assaulted a woman in his
Las Vegas home in September, said, "There is probable cause to
believe a crime has occurred."</TE>
<TE>   According to one source, after the events of Jan. 22, MGM Grand
officials quietly put out the word to the commission that, while they
would continue to publicly support the fight, they wouldn't be
opposed to the denial of a license for Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   "The MGM Grand respects and supports the Nevada State Athletic
Commission decision," spokesman Scott Ghertner said after the
hearing. "We appreciate the professionalism and processes the
commission took to reach their decision. We absolutely believe this
would have been the greatest fight in sports history."</TE>
<TE>   No charges have been filed in the assault case, and Tyson was
prevented by his attorneys from commenting on that case.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson defended his behavior in the brawl by saying he was told he
and Lewis were merely going to stand nose to nose for photographers
and the situation got out of control because of the bodyguard.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a miscommunication problem," Tyson said. "I wasn't
intending to inflict pain on the champion or anybody affiliated with
him. It was just a horrible situation that I wish had never happened.
It was a bad day, one that I will have to deal with the rest of my
life, whether I get a license or not."</TE>
<TE>   After Tyson bit Holyfield, he lost his Nevada license for 18
months. He got a new one only after promising to pursue psychological
counseling for emotional problems, remain on medication for
depression and get his finances in order.</TE>
<TE>   Magic Johnson, a friend of Tyson's, testified before the
commission in 1998 that he would help Tyson get his life in order.
Mack is the only commissioner remaining from the group that gave
Tyson a new license in 1998, but several of those voting Tuesday said
a lack of evidence of Tyson's sincerity in following up on his 1998
promises figured in their decision.</TE>
<TE>   Claiming he couldn't remember dates, Tyson wasn't clear on when he
stopped the psychological counseling. He said he went off his
medication "about five or six months ago."</TE>
<TE>   And, when asked whatever happened to his plan to seek Johnson's
help, Tyson said, "Me and Earvin have been close friends since the
early '80s, but he has played no particular role. He's my friend and
that's how I would like to leave our relationship."</TE>
<TE>   Yet later in the proceedings, when asked whom he has leaned on for
support, Tyson told the commissioners, "I have not had one friend in
my entire life."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how the commissioners could be sure he wouldn't lose control
in the future, Tyson said, "I'm crazy, but not crazy like that. I
don't want to kill or rape anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Alamo said his greatest concern in casting his vote is Tyson's
future.</TE>
<TE>   "Boxing will do fine after Mike Tyson leaves it," Alamo said. "The
question is, will Mike Tyson be fine when boxing leaves him?"</TE>

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis questioned whether he would go
through with a fight against Mike Tyson in a statement issued after
the Nevada State Athletic Commission denied Tyson a license.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis also accused Tyson of lying in the hearing when Tyson said
he didn't bite Lewis in their brawl Jan. 22 at a New York news
conference.</LD>
<LD>   "The fact is," Lewis said in the statement, "Mike Tyson bit
through my trousers and took a significant piece of flesh out of my
thigh. I was particularly disturbed by the fact that he went before
the commission today and did not tell the truth by denying what he
knows occurred.</LD>
<TE>   "I have made no decision yet about the possibility of fighting
Mike Tyson in another jurisdiction that may license him, because I
want to consider carefully the reasons expressed by the commission in
denying the license.</TE>
<TE>   "In addition, I am still consulting with my attorneys as to the
legal consequences should I declare that I will not go forward with
the bout."</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, Tyson called out Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Lennox is a coward," Tyson said. "I'm going to fight him
any time I see him in the streets."</TE>

<LD>Lately, Dijon Thompson gets playing time and does little with it.
Andre Patterson doesn't even get the time.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, two of the three Bruin true freshmen have hit a wall. While
point guard Cedric Bozeman plays more than 30 minutes and is allowed
to play through his mistakes, Thompson and Patterson are on a short
leash.</LD>
<LD>   Against Stanford and California last weekend, Thompson had three
points, five rebounds, two assists and five turnovers in 24 minutes.
He made one of six shots. Patterson only wishes he had the chance to
take that many--he missed his only shot in five minutes against
Stanford and did not play against Cal.</LD>
<TE>   Thompson is handling it by taking a history lesson--reading
articles and looking at box scores from two and three years ago when
current seniors Matt Barnes and Billy Knight endured similar growing
pains.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm reading up on what they went through," Thompson said. "I
don't need anybody to tell me about it. The Internet, studying old
tapes, everything I can get my hands on. Athletes go through this all
the time, especially young athletes. I'm not the first one and I
won't be the last."</TE>
<TE>   Barnes and Knight became so depressed as benchwarmers they nearly
transferred.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Steve Lavin said communication is the key to avoiding a
similar episode with Thompson, who averages nearly 17 minutes a game,
or Patterson, who averages 10.2.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing is hearing it from other players," Lavin

<LD>It wasn't the fact that he had been snubbed in the latest Pacific 10
Conference player of the week announcement that got to Sam Clancy.</LD>
<LD>   It was the fact that the USC senior power forward lost out in
making a little sibling rivalry history that rubbed him the wrong
way.</LD>
<LD>   Clancy's younger brother Samario, a junior at St. Edward High in
Lakewood, Ohio, was honored Monday as his league's player of the
week.</LD>
<TE>   "We could have been player of the week together," Clancy said with
a smile. "But it didn't happen so there's always next week.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been nice to have been Pac-10 player of the week,
but it's not something I look too much forward to. It's not like they
give you a trophy or anything."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy did enough in the Trojans' home split against California
and Stanford  to garner serious consideration for the Pac-10 honor.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Golden Bears and Cardinal, two teams that came in with
a combined record of 24-7, Clancy averaged 25 points, 12 rebounds,
1.5 assists and 2.5 steals while making 74.1% (20 of 27) of his free
throws and shooting 48.4% (15 of 31) from the field.</TE>
<TE>   But Oregon State junior forward Philip Ricci was feted after
averaging 18.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 2.5 steals
against Washington and Washington State, the league's two last-place
teams, which were a combined 12-22.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy will get an up-close-and-personal look at Ricci Thursday
when the 23rd-ranked Trojans play at Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen him play and I heard he was a good player,"
Clancy said. "That's the only thing I'm taking into the game."</TE>

<LD>The Pepperdine Waves are limping through the season.</LD>
<LD>   Forwards Kelli Spencer and Anna Lembke tore anterior cruciate
ligaments and are lost for the season. Guard Jennifer Lakin's career
ended in October because of concussions. Center Shannon Mayberry may
have a stress fracture in her right leg.</LD>
<LD>   Shandrika Lee, the starting point guard, is playing despite a
sprained left wrist.</LD>
<TE>   But that hasn't stopped Pepperdine from being the hottest college
women's team in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves (15-4) take a school-record 12-game winning streak into
their home game tonight against Loyola Marymount. Predicted to finish
somewhere in the middle of the West Coast Conference, they are the
WCC's only unbeaten team.</TE>
<TE>   After guiding the Waves to four consecutive 20-win seasons, Coach
Mark Trakh wasn't sure how good this team could be. So far, it's
exceeding expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew we had talent," Trakh said. "We've got some kids who were
highly recruited: Mayberry was [recruited] at Stanford, Colorado,
Texas and Arkansas. Tamara McDonald came down to between us and UCLA.
Damaris Hinojosa came down to us and UCLA. Jennifer Lacy was
recruited by half the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   "It was getting everybody together, getting the chemistry, getting
the young kids into the flow of the offense and defense, and giving
them experience. I thought it could have been a .500 year and rebuild
or we'd start to jell."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a 6-0 conference record, the Waves won three
holiday tournaments, have notable nonconference victories against
Alabama and George Washington, and are tied with Louisiana Tech for
the fourth-longest active winning streak in Division I play.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine's losses--to Arizona, Syracuse, Stanford and
Illinois--were respectable. The overtime defeat to Illinois on Dec. 8
is the Waves' last loss.</TE>
<TE>   It would be even better for Pepperdine if more people were
watching.</TE>
<TE>   Few universities can match the kind of location Pepperdine
enjoys--830 acres stretched atop the Santa Monica Mountains with an
endless view of the Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   There are enough property owners in the film and music businesses
to put the Lakers' Hollywood following to shame.</TE>
<TE>   But forget Spagos. It's hard enough for Pepperdine, which averages
505 a home game, to get the McDonald's crowd into Firestone
Fieldhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "My assistant Jody [Wynn] recently pointed out, 'You have Loyola
Marymount, UCLA, USC and us. [In the past four years] we've won more
games, more conference titles, went to more postseasons, and we get
the least exposure,'" Trakh said. "People don't hear about us a lot.
But if we keep taking care of business we'll get people interested."</TE>
<TE>   Somehow the Waves keep rolling. They are winning without a
dominant scorer--Hinojosa averages 13.4 points a game to lead the
team. They've won with buzzer beaters, and by 30. Each game, they
seem to find a different way to victory.</TE>
<TE>   Now in his ninth season, Trakh, who had 356 victories and four
state titles at Brea Olinda High before coming to Pepperdine, has
become the Waves' all-time leader in coaching victories with 152.</TE>
<TE>   But victories in March are what his team needs most. Since Trakh
has been coach, the Waves have reached the WCC tournament
championship game twice without winning it. They've also been to the
NCAA and National Invitation Tournament once, but have never advanced
past the first round.</TE>
<TE>   This might be the year for a breakthrough.</TE>

<HD>Accounting Worried Global Crossing Exec</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The fiber-optic network company denies accusations that it
inflated its numbers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A finance executive at ailing Global Crossing Ltd. warned the
firm's top attorney in August that the company's financial condition was
being enhanced with misleading accounting techniques, according to a
letter obtained by the Los Angeles Times.</LD>
<LD>   The five-page letter, written by Roy Olofson, former vice president of
finance, contains a detailed analysis of what he called deceptive
accounting practices involving Global Crossing, its sister firm Asia
Global Crossing and its auditor, Andersen. These included inflated
revenue and cash-flow figures, numbers that may have helped convince
investors and analysts that Global Crossing was healthier than it
actually was, Olofson wrote.</LD>
<LD>   The contents of the letter came to light one day after Global
Crossing, a Beverly Hills telecommunications company, filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection, listing debts of $12.3 billion and assets of
$22.4 billion. It is the fifth-largest bankruptcy case in U.S. history.</LD>
<TE>   The company vehemently denied Olofson's accusations.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a situation we are very familiar with, has thoroughly been
investigated both internally and externally, and is without merit," the
company said in a statement. "Mr. Olofson is a former employee who is
trying to draw parallels to the Enron situation for his own personal
gain. The company believes that Mr. Olofson's threat to take this issue
public through the filing of a lawsuit unless he was paid a substantial
amount of money speaks for itself." A spokesman would not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen spokesman David Tabolt said the accounting firm doesn't yet
have enough information to comment on the letter. "We just found out
about this [late Tuesday], and we are looking into it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Olofson couldn't be reached, but his attorney, Brian C. Lysaght of
O'Neill Lysaght &amp; Sun in Santa Monica, confirmed the existence of the
letter obtained by The Times. However, he declined to comment on its
contents.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing general counsel Jim Gorton left the company within
days of receiving Olofson's letter. He could not be reached Tuesday, but
Casey Cogut, another attorney working for Global Crossing, said Gorton's
departure "had nothing to do with the letter." Olofson was laid off three
months later.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, Olofson asked Gorton to investigate the company's
accounting practices and urged him not to involve Global Chief Financial
Officer Dan Cohrs or Joe Perrone, Olofson's boss and a recent recruit
from the now-beleaguered Andersen accounting firm. Perrone had supervised
Global Crossing's initial public stock offering and then served as the
company's lead auditor at Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Olofson's letter outlines issues similar to those at the heart
of the current scandal at Enron, the Texas energy firm that collapsed
amid allegations that company executives used, and Andersen auditors
blessed, misleading accounting to hide the firm's mounting losses.
Andersen is accused of overlooking the accounting sleight of hand to
maintain good relations with Enron, which was a major customer of
Andersen's consulting business.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Enron executives allegedly sold millions of dollars in
company shares before the accounting troubles were uncovered.</TE>
<TE>   In Global Crossing's case, some industry analysts were already wary of
the company's accounting methods--which are standard in the
telecommunications industry--but most ordinary investors were not.</TE>
<TE>   Olofson, of La Canada Flintridge, is one of the many lesser-known
executives who have flowed through Global Crossing in recent years. In
1996 and 1997, he was the chief financial officer at PIA Merchandising
Services Inc., an Irvine company that specialized in tracking the
distribution and marketing of branded goods sold in grocery stores.
Before that, he spent more than 13 years at Santa Fe Springs-based Fedco,
where he eventually became chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Previous jobs included stints as treasurer at retailing conglomerate
Carter Hawley Hale Stores, and the accounting firm Price Waterhouse.</TE>
<TE>   His Global Crossing letter takes aim at a little-known accounting
policy embraced by Global Crossing and other major communications network
operators known as "indefeasible rights of use," or IRUs. These
instruments are used to sell bandwidth on Global Crossing's fiber-optic
network typically for 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing and its competitors frequently bought space on one
another's networks in areas not covered by their own systems to offer
corporate customers a more complete data system.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts have grown wary of the excessive use of IRUs and the way
Global Crossing and others were registering their sales on financial
reports. In some cases, Global Crossing would buy an IRU and book the
price as a capital expense, which would spread the expense over a number
of future years. It would then resell that capacity and book the proceeds
as revenue, leaving some investors to see the increase in revenue, but
not the expense, said Susan Kalla, a telecommunications analyst at
Friedman, Billings Ramsey.</TE>
<TE>   "That's perfectly legal to do, but a better way to do it so that
investors could better understand what was going on, would have been to
book the IRU as an expense and then register the revenue against the
expense," said Kalla, who has been so bearish on the industry that she
gained the nickname "Dr. Doom."</TE>
<TE>   The way Global Crossing, Qwest Communications International,
360networks and others handled the IRUs "might have made it look like the
revenue was being generated from the capacity that the [respective
companies] put in, but it was capacity that they bought and then resold
to another carrier," Kalla said. "They were selling stuff to each other.
. . . I would sell you an IRU, and then you would sell it back to me."</TE>
<TE>   Most industry analysts ultimately became somewhat familiar with the
IRU accounting technique, but ordinary investors--to their
detriment--were focusing on the income and revenue figures, and probably
didn't notice the IRU purchase expenses listed elsewhere in the financial
statements, Kalla said.</TE>
<TE>   Olofson's letter contends that the IRU accounting practice was a sly
way for Global Crossing and other young telecommunications companies to
report better results.</TE>
<TE>   The letter, dated Aug. 6, 2001, makes no mention of any criminal
behavior, such as document shredding or insider trading.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulatory filings show that Gary Winnick, the influential
chairman and founder of Global Crossing, sold no shares after May 23 of
that year, 2 1/2 months before Olofson submitted his letter.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear whether Winnick knew about Olofson's letter or its
accusations, but two outside attorneys working for the company said they
had reviewed the letter several months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick and most other Global Crossing executives sold large amounts
of shares over time, but only a few did so after Olofson wrote his
letter.</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>In a filthy room thick with the soot from a wood stove, the money
men have just finished counting and sorting a merchant's gift to the
government of about 1 billion afghanis. The cash arrived stuffed in the
trunk and back seats of two passenger cars.</LD>
<LD>   The task has taken 18 men three days. The total street value in Kabul:
about $35,000. On a note, Afghanistan's interim prime minister, Hamid
Karzai, has scrawled that the money should be allocated to the Health
Ministry.</LD>
<LD>   Now the stacks of money--the largest bill in circulation is worth
about 35 cents--are carried across a lobby getting its first fresh coat
of paint in decades, to Afghanistan's national treasury.</LD>
<TE>   The treasury itself consists of about a dozen 60-year-old man-sized
vaults that open with long silver latchkeys. Sayed Del Aqayee, deputy
treasury chief, marks with a pen in a big red ledger the cash received
and the cash withdrawn. The most sophisticated device around is a
calculator.</TE>
<TE>   This is Afghanistan's central bank, the would-be heart of a chaotic
monetary system based entirely on cash. Much of the $4.5 billion the
world has pledged to help rebuild the country should, in theory, go
through here. How the bank will cope is anyone's guess, but teams from
the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have arrived in Kabul, the
capital, to help.</TE>
<TE>   There are no computers in any of the main offices, no desks, no
money-counting machines.</TE>
<TE>   "My banking system is still in the 1940s," says Abdul Q. Fitrat, the
interim central bank governor--in effect, the Alan Greenspan of
Afghanistan. He is an optimist: The 19th century might be more accurate.</TE>
<TE>   There are no commercial banks in the country. Money is exchanged in
the bazaar, where hundreds of men in turbans and caps stand with huge
stacks of cash, ready to change afghanis for Pakistani rupees or U.S.
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban outlawed the paying of interest when it took control of
Kabul in 1996, ending any incentive to put money in a savings account.
When the Taliban fled the city in November, it looted millions of dollars
in U.S., Pakistani and Afghan currency, said Aqayee.</TE>
<TE>   For now, there's little connection between the central bank and the
regional banks in the provinces.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent day, Dor Mohammed, manager of the main bank in Khowst near
the Pakistani border, and his accountant, Mohammed Isehaq, waited outside
Fitrat's office after having driven north for a day on terrible roads.</TE>
<TE>   They described to a visitor how each province had been
self-sufficient, receiving money from checkpoints and taxes, which it
used to pay provincial civil servants' salaries and other expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "I know she wants to know how aid money comes here," said Isehaq. "A
journalist will scratch where it does not itch."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know how it will come, how it will go, how it will be
spent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't take much scratching to determine how chaotic Afghanistan's
financial system is. People hide cash in their houses. Credit cards,
debit cards and checking accounts don't exist. The equivalent of $100 in
afghanis is at minimum a brick-size wad of cash, and that's if it's
changed into the biggest bills, 10,000-afghani notes.</TE>
<TE>   Afghans can count money faster than any American, holding the wad in
one hand and rapidly shuffling the index finger of the other through the
stack.</TE>
<TE>   Different parts of the country don't even use the same currency. Gen.
Abdul Rashid Dostum, the governor of Mazar-i-Sharif in the north, has
produced a close replica of the national currency, but it is accepted
only in the region and has only half the value of the regular afghani.</TE>
<TE>   Even after the Taliban ousted the opposition Northern Alliance from
Kabul and hemmed it into the northeastern corner of the country, the
alliance continued having afghanis printed in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, controlling the money supply is a challenge, and Fitrat
said Karzai has declared that no more money should be printed.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.N. will supply some money and the IMF will help us until we
build an adequate revenue and budgetary system," Fitrat said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the value of the afghani has soared lately.</TE>
<TE>   Dollars are accepted in most places, and Fitrat said the country may
do away with the afghani and start using greenbacks or euros.</TE>
<TE>   "In every corner of this country, people know the dollar," he said.
IMF and World Bank experts recommended Tuesday that the dollar be used as
an interim currency until a new afghani can be introduced.</TE>
<TE>   Fitrat is returning to his post after five years in the Washington
area, where he had been attending a World Bank meeting in 1996 when the
Taliban seized control of Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   As Fitrat chatted recently with a reporter in English, Deputy Finance
Minister Abdul Sami Wali and Deputy Foreign Minister Rahim Sherzoy
dropped by for tea. They slipped into the Dari language, but by and by
the English words "deficit financing" popped up.</TE>
<TE>   "How can we pay this much to the minister of planning?" Wali said.
"Karzai is giving every ministry more than they've been allocated and
more than we have in the bank."</TE>
<TE>   Though the international community has promised billions of dollars in
aid, little of it has arrived yet.</TE>
<TE>   For now, much of the money that is coming into the country is being
delivered through men such as Mohammed Musa, who was on a house call to
deliver $80,000 in greenbacks to the finance director of the U.N. refugee
agency here.</TE>
<TE>   Musa is a sarif, or money changer, and it is he who produces cash for
several other U.N. agencies and aid groups. He charges those large
customers a commission of about 1%.</TE>
<TE>   Musa's office is the size of a one-car garage. A single lightbulb
hangs from the ceiling, and a kerosene lamp stands on the counter to
serve during the nearly continual power failures. It is located in the
shahzadah, a warren at the heart of the central bazaar.</TE>
<TE>   Just outside his door is a throng of private money changers, whose
deals determine the exchange rate.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the commercial bank," said Pierre Njouyep, the refugee
agency's finance director, gesturing toward Musa, who wore a wool shawl
draped around his shoulders and a small cap on his head as he made his
delivery. "There's no other way."</TE>

<HD>Andersen's Reputation in Shreds</HD>
<DH>The accounting firm was once considered the industry's conscience.
But the Enron scandal has revealed the dark side of the profession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH FRAMMOLINO</AU>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Think straight, talk straight.</LD>
<LD>   That motto was coined by Arthur Edward Andersen, a Northwestern
University accounting professor who made standing up for what's right the
bedrock principle of the company he founded 88 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   What John Wayne was to westerns, Andersen was to accounting--demanding
absolute honesty and probity from employees and clients alike. Andersen's
fastidiousness even extended to an employee dress code, which for years
required all auditors to wear fedoras on appointments, no matter the
weather.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen's company grew into the world's fifth-largest accounting
firm, with more than 100,000 corporate clients, $9 billion a year in
revenue and 85,000 employees around the world. More than that, it helped
set ethical standards for the entire profession.</TE>
<TE>   "Arthur Andersen wouldn't put up with anything that wasn't complete,
100% integrity," said George R. Catlett, 84, a retired Andersen partner
from Evanston, Ill. "If anybody did anything otherwise, he'd fire them.
And if clients wanted him to do something he didn't agree with, he'd
either try to change them or quit."</TE>
<TE>   Today the Chicago-based firm, known simply as Andersen, is an emblem
of accounting misdeeds, the focus of congressional investigations and the
butt of presidential jokes.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen vouched for financial statements that overstated Enron
Corp.'s earnings by $586 million over nearly five years. It has admitted
shredding documents even after the Securities and Exchange Commission
began examining Enron's collapse, the largest corporate bankruptcy in
U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal threatens the survival of Andersen. And because of the
company's prominence, the disclosures are reverberating widely, shaking
investors' confidence in the profits and losses reported by corporate
America. Members of Congress and federal regulators are examining the
accounting industry's practices and standards.</TE>
<TE>   "The conscience of the industry, essentially, appeared to sell out,"
said Bill Cummings, an accounting professor at Northern Illinois
University and a past president of the American Accounting Assn.'s
Midwest region. "I think it's pure and simple. It's greed and the allure
of the big-money clients."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's role in the Enron collapse has revealed the "dark side" of
a profession whose independence has been compromised by the chase for
multimillion-dollar fees, Cummings said.</TE>
<TE>   Like many accounting firms these days, Andersen wore two hats at
Enron. It was the company's independent auditor, responsible for ensuring
that its financial statements were accurate. It was also a financial
consultant, helping Enron executives devise ways of running the business
more profitably and reducing its tax bill.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen auditors and consultants occupied a floor of their own in the
energy company's gleaming Houston headquarters. They carried Enron-issued
electronic ID cards, mingled at office picnics--and even wore Enron golf
shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are looking at Andersen's alleged role in setting up
complex transactions that inflated Enron's earnings by keeping massive
debts off the company's books. Andersen has claimed that its accountants
were misled by Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Andersen himself wouldn't have gotten so cozy with a client, to
judge from accounts of his career. The son of Norwegian immigrants,
Andersen is described as crotchety, opinionated and stubborn.</TE>
<TE>   Company lore has it that he lost the prized E.I. du Pont account in
the 1930s over an interpretation of operating income. Du Pont executives
insisted on using a more liberal definition that would lump in the value
of the company's large investment in General Motors. Andersen's auditors
said no, and Andersen backed them up. Du Pont found another auditor.</TE>
<TE>   The episode sealed the reputation of Andersen and his firm. The
company still guards that legacy jealously, said Andersen spokesman Dave
Tabolt. "It's an issue that people are concerned about every day," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, Andersen employees can be fired for fudging a meal on an
expense form or lying about their college grade-point averages, say
former partners.</TE>
<TE>   Before accepting a client, Andersen performs background checks on its
top executives. Andersen auditors are told to summarily "leave the
field"--walk away from the job--if they meet unreasonable resistance.</TE>
<TE>   The firm also has shaped reforms within the accounting profession.</TE>
<TE>Firm Insisted on Tight Central Controls</TE>
<TE>   Auditors perform a vital role in the nation's financial system by
certifying the accuracy of profits, losses, debts and other financial
data reported by companies. They are hired by a company's shareholders
and its board of directors to ensure that financial statements meet
federal disclosure standards.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1950s and 1960s, Leonard Spacek, Andersen's successor,
openly criticized the profession for tolerating what he considered a
sloppy patchwork of accounting standards that left the investing public
no way to compare the financial performance of different companies.</TE>
<TE>   Spacek's evangelism led to the creation of the Accounting Principles
Board, an industry group that established uniform financial accounting
and reporting standards. In 1973, the board was replaced by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, an independent body recognized by the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted what they considered to be substandard accounting
principles . . . to be improved," said Stephen Zeff, an accounting
professor and historian at Rice University. "The accounting establishment
back East . . . didn't want the cage rattled. Arthur Andersen rattled the
cage."</TE>
<TE>   The firm also has set itself apart over the years by cultivating a
corporate cohesiveness that borders on clannishness, say experts and
former employees.</TE>
<TE>   The firm has always insisted on tight central controls and uniformity.
Before computers, Andersen partners around the world worked off a
cross-indexed central filing system that listed every client, audit and
supporting memos.</TE>
<TE>   At the firm's campus in rural St. Charles, Ill., about 40 miles west
of Chicago, uniformity is stressed to new recruits during an intensive
two-week training course.</TE>
<TE>   "They always talked about the one-firm philosophy. . . . No matter
where you are, there was one firm, one philosophy," said Vadim Fridman,
31, a former Andersen auditor who is now chief financial officer for St.
Maartens Spirits, a distributor of premium liqueurs in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the practice of accounting changed in ways that
Andersen's original credo didn't anticipate.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting firms now offer lucrative consulting services. Their
clients include complex businesses with dozens of different divisions.
And when companies go bad, shareholders often target the auditors as well
as the management.</TE>
<TE>   Worries over shareholder lawsuits rippled throughout the firm and
shaped how audits were conducted during the 1990s, former employees say.</TE>
<TE>   Auditors use two files to keep records of their work. One is for
working papers that offer supporting documentation for the auditor's
findings about a company's finances. The other file is for personal
notes, memos and other documents. At the end of an audit, papers in the
second file are destroyed while those in the first are preserved.</TE>
<TE>   "The emphasis when I was at Andersen was to take more and more out of
the work file. They wanted fewer and fewer source documents to be in the
source file, across the board with any client," said a former employee in
Houston, who left the firm about a year ago. "The less of that you keep
in the file, the less likely there is of someone coming back in and
finding a smoking gun."</TE>
<TE>   Equally troublesome, say regulators and critics, was Andersen's habit,
common in the industry, of encouraging its auditors to seek employment
with the companies they were auditing. This gave Andersen a network of
allies in big corporations and with it leverage to preserve its auditing
and consulting contracts and prospect for new ones.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen alumni hold top positions in industries where Andersen has a
large share of the auditing business. Andersen is the dominant accounting
company for Texas energy companies. Former Andersen executives hold top
corporate slots at such companies as Dynegy, Petroleum Geoservices and
Comstock Resources. All buy auditing services from Andersen, whose
contracts are reviewed annually.</TE>
<TE>   "We call it practice development," said one Andersen alumnus. "The
biggest reason to do it is, if there's other [non-audit] work to be done,
you want to be the first one they call."</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: Vadim Fridman. He worked in Andersen's Woodland Hills
office, auditing mid-size businesses. When he left the company, he wasn't
forgotten. "They've always maintained contact," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two jobs later, an Andersen executive called him and asked whether he
had any interest in becoming chief financial officer of St. Maartens
Spirits, the Santa Barbara company.</TE>
<TE>   "They did some [consulting] work for the company and came up with the
fact they needed a CFO and got me the interview," said Fridman, who ended
up getting the job. If St. Maartens ever needs the services of a major
accounting firm, he added, "obviously I'd lean toward Andersen. I know
how they work."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Enron hired away dozens of current and former Andersen
employees--including Sherron S. Watkins, the Enron vice president who
eventually warned of the company's collapse. In 1993, Enron shifted 40
employees to Andersen's payroll when it hired the firm, already its
outside auditor, to take over internal auditing as well.</TE>
<TE>   Outside auditors examine transaction records to verify the accuracy of
a company's financial statements. Internal auditors monitor the
effectiveness of the company's internal financial controls.</TE>
<TE>   The arrangement meant that Andersen would be essentially policing its
own work, said one former Andersen energy expert.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of another Andersen client, Waste Management Inc., the SEC
cited such interlocking ties when it levied a $7-million fine against
Andersen last year, the largest ever imposed by the agency on an
accounting firm.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, Andersen issued "materially false or misleading audits"
that overstated Waste Management's net income between 1993 and 1997 by
more than $1 billion, the SEC said. The agency also fined four Andersen
partners and barred them for varying periods from working on audits of
publicly traded companies.</TE>
<TE>   "Arthur Andersen and its partners failed to stand up to company
management and thereby betrayed their ultimate allegiance to Waste
Management's shareholders and the investing public," said Richard Walker,
the SEC's chief of enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   The agency disclosed that every chief financial officer and chief
accounting officer at Waste Management from 1971 until 1997 was a former
Andersen auditor. Altogether, 14 former Andersen employees worked for
Waste Management during the 1990s in key financial and accounting
positions. Andersen and Waste Management paid $220 million to settle
several lawsuits over accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   The case was one of the latest in a string of lawsuits and sanctions
against Andersen or its partners for alleged shoddy or misleading work.
In April, the SEC sued an Andersen partner for allegedly covering up a
massive management fraud at appliance maker Sunbeam Inc. Andersen agreed
to pay $110 million to settle a related shareholder lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the accounting giant paid $90 million to investors and $2.5
million to Connecticut authorities to settle allegations that it
knowingly approved overly optimistic projections for real estate ventures
launched by Colonial Realty, a commercial real estate company.</TE>
<TE>   Those settlements have come as Andersen has fought tighter
restrictions on the accounting industry.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Andersen led the lobbying campaign that ultimately defeated
a proposed SEC rule to force accounting firms to separate their business
consulting practice from auditing. Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt and
others argued that the twin functions posed a temptation for firms to
coddle high-paying clients or bury their accounting sins.</TE>
<TE>   At Enron, Andersen collected $52 million for its auditing and
consulting services for 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The firm that once defied du Pont is accused of wilting in the face of
a dubious client that paid it a million dollars a week in fees. "Nobody's
going to walk away from that," said Cummings, the Northern Illinois
University professor.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino rose to the defense of his
firm this week, saying the Enron debacle does not represent the true
character of the company and its 85,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   "They want you to know that this is not their Andersen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Berardino conceded the company was losing business. One recent
defector is Keystone Automotive Industries, a Pomona-based distributor of
auto parts. In November, the firm's board voted to hire Andersen after
using Ernst &amp; Young as its auditor for 20 years. The board dropped
Andersen when the Enron revelations began to roll.</TE>
<TE>   "We just felt that there was so much noise surrounding this situation
that maybe for us the best thing to do was not be second-guessed" by
stockholders, said John Palumbo, Keystone's chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   Among the clients sticking by Andersen for now is Houston-based Swift
Energy, an oil and gas exploration firm. Yet Bruce Vincent, Swift's
executive vice president, said he could understand why others might
desert the company.</TE>
<TE>   "The risk to Andersen is almost like that of a bank," said Vincent.
"If you have a loss of credibility, you have a run on the bank. If you
have enough clients that start switching, they're out of business."</TE>

failed to charge customers the prices posted on shelves, the Board of
Supervisors voted Tuesday to punish wayward sellers with the county's
version of a scarlet letter.</LD>
<LD>   Written in the spirit of the county's restaurant letter grade rule,
which requires eateries to post their Health Department grade, the new
measure will require retailers to post notices of convictions for
overcharging customers. It also will boost the number of county
inspectors from one to 19.</LD>
<LD>   The action comes after undercover investigators were overcharged on
one in 10 items bought during visits to 108 retail stores in Los Angeles
County. In fewer instances, customers were charged a lower price. The
inspections were conducted over three weeks, ending Jan. 14.</LD>
<TE>   Inspectors did not test grocery stores, which have a history of
overcharging in California and will be required to comply with the new
county rules.</TE>
<TE>   Undercover agents were overcharged at 80% of Kmart, Macy's and
Wal-Mart stores, Cato R. Fiksdal, the county's agricultural commissioner
and director of weights and measures, said in his report to the board.</TE>
<TE>   When investigators returned to 10 Kmart stores, four Macy's and three
Wal-Marts, Fiksdal said, they were again overcharged--this time for
nearly one out of every three items purchased.</TE>
<TE>   Overcharges are mostly a result of failing to change a sale price
posted on store shelves after a higher price has been entered into the
store's computer. Many customers don't notice at the cash register and
pay the higher price.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's biggest retail trade group said it has not heard of any
government agency drafting a similar a measure and warned that consumers
could suffer under the rules.</TE>
<TE>   "The surest way not to get a bad letter grade is not to reduce
prices," said Mallory Duncan, general counsel for the National Retail
Federation in Washington, D.C. "Just keep prices where they are and never
have specials and you'll score an A, if that's what the [county] wants to
accomplish."</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Kmart Corp. and Macy's, a division of Federated
Department Stores Inc., each issued statements saying they were committed
to charging customers fairly and accurately, and were dismayed by
findings of errors.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Gloria Molina, who spearheaded both the report and the new
county regulations, said she hopes the notices will "shame" retailers
into accurately programming their scanners to reflect prices listed on
store shelves.</TE>
<TE>   After being overcharged last year at a Macy's and a Kmart, Molina
ordered a report from the county Department of Weights and Measures,
whose agents found price discrepancies among 60% of retailers. They also
discovered that stores overcharging on sale items tend to do so
repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   "I was deceived as a consumer," Molina said. "Every single time I have
raised this issue with a store they are not at all sorry about it."</TE>
<TE>   Molina's staff said about 100 businesses each year are convicted of
misdemeanor charges of deceptive advertising for overcharging customers,
infractions found with a single county inspector.</TE>
<TE>   That, combined with the stores' readiness to accept misdemeanor
convictions and fines, she said, makes her believe that retailers
intentionally boost profits by overcharging. Molina wants the ordinance
to be effective immediately after adoption, which requires a second vote
by the board.</TE>
<TE>   In the county survey, Wal-Mart--the world's biggest retailer and
widely recognized as the industry's technology leader--fared better than
Kmart and Macy's in terms of pricing accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart, which last week became the largest retailer in history to file
for bankruptcy, was the worst, overcharging at every one of its stores,
with an error ratio of four overcharges for every undercharge.</TE>
<TE>   Although the 60% of discrepancies found by investigators include both
overcharges, which penalize consumers, and undercharges, which work in
consumers' favor, both are significant because they point out the stores'
problems in making the shelf price match the actual charge at the
register.</TE>
<TE>   Scanning accuracy, the industry's term for the problem of incorrect
charges at the checkout counter, is a misnomer since scanners are almost
foolproof in their ability to correctly read bar codes and charge the
price the merchant entered into the main computer system.</TE>
<TE>   The problem lies in the tedious human work of making sure the signs on
the shelves match the price in the computer. Most discrepancies happen as
a result of frequently changing prices. Duncan, of the National Retail
Federation, said no checkout method is foolproof. The retail group found
that the old-fashioned method of putting prices on each item and then
having them read by a cashier resulted in an error rate of 10% to 15%,
mostly as a result of cashiers punching in the wrong price.</TE>
<TE>   During Tuesday's hearing, grocery store representatives complained
that they had not been consulted about the measure.</TE>
<TE>   "Accidents will happen," said Nick Verdugo of Ralphs Grocery Co. "But
we put a lot of safeguards in place to try to minimize that human error."</TE>
<TE>   The California Grocers Assn. argued that its statistics show that
scanner errors just as frequently favor consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Rifling through a list of convictions, Molina interrupted several of
the speakers, pointing out that each of their chains had been convicted
of overcharging customers.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know how many times in L.A. County your members have been
convicted?" she asked the grocers association representative. "You're
convicted three to five times a month--those are the ones we catch. . . .
It's public information, by the way. I want to put it on the front door."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the new county measure, the board also voted to increase to
19 the number of undercover inspectors who check store scanner
accuracy--a motion by Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky. The $2-million cost
would come from fees on businesses. A final vote by the board is
scheduled in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In a nearly two-hour debate, Supervisor Don Knabe said he worried that
the costs of increased fees would cripple small businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have to be careful . . . how it will affect the corner
Hallmark," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates, however, voiced their support.</TE>
<TE>   "The ones most affected by this are consumers who are on a fixed
budget, stretching their dollars by buying sale items and instead are
charged full price," said Guadalupe Aguilar of Consumer Action, a
nonprofit consumer protection group.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors ordered its lawyers to draw up an ordinance
requiring businesses to post convictions, which board members will have
to approve.</TE>
<TE>   The county counsel and Fiksdal's agency were told to meet with
retailers to discuss details and a fee schedule. Supervisors said,
however, that they are committed to increasing the number of inspectors
and requiring stores to post their violation notices.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's anything we're supposed to do, it's protect the interest
of the consumers," Yaroslavsky said. "If we had given the restaurant
industry the option of whether to have a posting [of letter grades] or
not, there wouldn't be a posting."</TE>

<HD>Bush Vows to Take War on Terror to Hostile Nations, Calls for Unity</HD>
<DH>Address: President singles out Iraq, Iran and N. Korea for possible
military intervention. He also calls for expanded national volunteer
service.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush, calling on the nation to embrace a wartime spirit
of resolve and responsibility, vowed Tuesday to extend the campaign
against terrorism to Iraq, Iran and North Korea and proposed to enlist
hundreds of thousands of Americans in programs of voluntary national
service.</LD>
<LD>   "Our war against terror is only beginning," Bush told both houses of
Congress in his State of the Union address, the first of his year-old
presidency and his first speech in the Capitol since he addressed the
nation after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. "We will win this war, we
will protect our homeland and we will revive our economy."</LD>
<LD>   Seeking to use his success in war to bolster his policy agenda at
home, Bush called on Congress and the nation to remain "steadfast and
patient and persistent" in the struggle against terrorism--and also to
support Republican proposals on taxes, health insurance, education and
energy.</LD>
<TE>   Leaders of the Democratic opposition responded by declaring full
support for the president in the war effort while criticizing his
domestic plans as ill-designed and insufficient.</TE>
<TE>   But the prevailing theme was wartime unity, and members of both
parties gave long standing ovations to Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney,
Afghan leader Hamid Karzai and Shannon Spann, the widow of a CIA officer
killed in combat in northern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In his 48-minute speech, Bush laid out an ambitious agenda, from the
battle against global terrorism to plans for more volunteer teachers and
medical workers at home.</TE>
<TE>   He said U.S. intelligence agents searching terrorist bases in
Afghanistan found maps of U.S. cities, diagrams of nuclear power plants
and water facilities, and instructions for making chemical weapons--as
well as new evidence that "thousands of dangerous killers" are still at
large.</TE>
<TE>   He warned that hostile countries--specifying Iraq, Iran and North
Korea--"pose a grave and growing danger" by building chemical, biological
or nuclear weapons, and made an implicit threat of military intervention
if they do not dismantle their arsenals. "I will not wait on events while
dangers gather. . . . The United States of America will not permit the
world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most
destructive weapons."</TE>
<TE>   The statement clarified Bush's position on an issue that has been
hotly debated both inside and outside his administration. While Iraq,
Iran and North Korea may not harbor terrorists like those who carried out
the attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Bush said,
he nevertheless considers them equally dangerous--and equally deserving
of military pressure--as long as they build weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   But the president did not explicitly threaten war against the three
countries. Instead, he said he will "do what is necessary" to prevent
them from threatening the United States or its allies.</TE>
<TE>   Bush reaffirmed his plans to nearly double federal funding for
homeland security measures, from $20 billion to $38 billion, and to
increase military spending by 14%, or $48 billion, the largest boost in
the defense budget since the presidency of Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>Extended Jobless Benefits Proposed</TE>
<TE>   In domestic affairs, Bush proposed several measures that already enjoy
broad bipartisan support: extended unemployment benefits for workers who
have lost their jobs in the recession, expanded programs in early
childhood education and a continuation of welfare reform.</TE>
<TE>   But he confirmed his intention to fight hard for Republican proposals
on issues that have divided Congress on party lines, like additional tax
cuts for corporations and upper-income families, plans for Medicare
reform and increased domestic production of oil and nuclear energy.</TE>
<TE>   In response to issues raised by the financial collapse of Enron Corp.,
the giant energy company whose executives were among his largest campaign
contributors, Bush called for new measures to protect employees from
losing retirement funds when a company fails. "Corporate America must be
made more accountable to employees and shareholders and held to the
highest standards of conduct," he said. He did not mention Enron by name.</TE>
<TE>   He also proposed a significant expansion of federal programs for
voluntary service, including the existing Peace Corps, AmeriCorps and
Senior Corps in a new umbrella organization called the "USA Freedom
Corps."</TE>
<TE>   "My call tonight is for every American to commit at least two
years--4,000 hours--over the rest of your lifetime to the service of your
neighbors and your nation," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Freedom Corps would include a focus on homeland security,
organizing citizens to serve as auxiliary police and fire units and
mobilizing retired physicians and nurses for help in biological weapon
attacks or other medical emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he wants to double the size of the Peace Corps, which
currently sends about 7,000 volunteers overseas. And he said he wants to
expand AmeriCorps, which puts more than 50,000 young Americans each year
into domestic community service, and Senior Corps, which recruits elderly
volunteers for such work.</TE>
<TE>   He said his goal is that overall, these programs will gain more than
200,000 new volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   The Peace Corps and AmeriCorps were creations of Democratic
presidents--John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton, respectively--and were
criticized at their inception by conservative Republicans as unwarranted
expansions of the federal government.</TE>
<TE>'A New Culture of Responsibility'</TE>
<TE>   But Bush said the federal volunteer programs could serve as a
cornerstone of "a new culture of responsibility," a theme he proclaimed
long before the terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "For too long our culture has said, 'If it feels good, do it.' Now
America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed: 'Let's roll,' " he
said, quoting one of the passengers who battled terrorists aboard a
United Airlines flight that crashed in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   "In the sacrifice of soldiers, the fierce brotherhood of firefighters,
and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizens, we have glimpsed
what a new culture of responsibility could look like. . . . We have been
offered a unique opportunity, and we must not let this moment pass."</TE>
<TE>   Bush acknowledged that his proposals--large increases in spending on
defense and homeland security, more modest increases in domestic
programs, and continued tax cuts--will create a deficit in a federal
budget that ran a surplus only last year.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the deficit "will be small and short term so long as
Congress restrains spending and acts in a fiscally responsible way."</TE>
<TE>   Inside the House chamber, Bush's address was received as two different
speeches: His words on the war and national service won warm, bipartisan
approval, but his arguments on domestic policy provoked traditional
partisan responses. At one point, he chided the Democratic-run Senate for
failing to pass trade and energy measures approved by the Republican-led
House, and the GOP benches erupted in cheerful hoots of "Work! Work!
Work!"</TE>
<TE>   Bush began his speech with a blunt assessment. "As we gather tonight,
our nation is at war, our economy is in recession and the civilized world
faces unprecedented dangers." Yet, he said, "the state of our nation has
never been stronger."</TE>
<TE>   In the official opposition response, House Democratic Leader Richard
A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) praised Bush's leadership in the war on terrorism and
noted: "There has been no daylight between us."</TE>
<TE>   But Gephardt sought to turn the focus back to the domestic agenda and
to portray Bush's policies as biased in favor of the wealthy and
powerful.</TE>
<TE>   "Our values call for protecting Social Security and not gambling it
away on the stock market. Our values call for helping patients and older
Americans, not just big HMOs [health maintenance organizations] and
pharmaceutical companies, ensuring that seniors don't have to choose
between food and medicine," Gephardt said. "Our values call for helping
the unemployed, not just large corporations and the most fortunate."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Bush nor Gephardt mentioned it, but both leaders' remarks
reflected the underlying political realities of the year: The president
is riding a wave of national popularity because of his largely successful
leadership in the war, but Democrats still hope to seize control of the
House in November's elections because of public misgivings about GOP
economic and social policies.</TE>
<TE>   At least one Democrat questioned his party's prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) worried aloud that Bush had
seized the political high ground on domestic as well as international
issues.</TE>
<TE>   "People aren't concerned about the deficit," Matsui said. "It's an
issueless situation. . . . The president is going to be talking about
prescription drugs for the very poor. None of these things are going to
happen, but he's going to get credit for trying. He's going in very
popular, and he's going to come out very popular."</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said he was pleased that
Bush's speech included a touch of partisanship on domestic issues.</TE>
<TE>   Armey recalled Bush's last speech to Congress--in the immediate
aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks--when he symbolized bipartisan unity by
embracing the Democratic leader of the Senate, Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), in a
bear hug.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than hugging Daschle . . . he will be trying to give him a
little boost in the hindquarters," Armey said.</TE>
<TE>   Another change from the September speech was the presence of Cheney,
who has spent much of the last four months in different locations from
Bush--a precaution in case a terrorist attack should claim the
president's life.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the vice president was in his customary seat behind the
president, next to the speaker of the House.</TE>
<TE>   Still, security around the Capitol was tightened to a wartime level.</TE>
<TE>   The Capitol Police, National Guard troops and Marines patrolled the
building, grounds and surrounding blocks. Security experts and
bomb-sniffing dogs checked the building for explosives and other hazards.
Access to the Capitol complex was tightly restricted for hours.</TE>
<TE>   As during the September speech, House Republican leaders chose one of
their ranks to be absent from the speech to ensure the "continuity of
government" in the event of a calamity. Chosen to be removed to a secure
location Tuesday night: House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   One member of Bush's Cabinet stayed away from the speech for the same
reason: Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In his State of the Union speech Tuesday night, President Bush
declared that he wants to boost expenditures on defense, homeland
security, health care and education. . .and cut taxes again to boot.</LD>
<LD>   How does he plan to pay for these and other proposals?</LD>
<LD>   The answer in a nutshell is he doesn't. Not in the next few years.
And, according to a variety of analysts, likely not in the next decade.</LD>
<TE>   "It's beginning to look like the 1960s when we tried to have both guns
and butter," said Robert E. Litan, economic studies director with the
centrist Brookings Institution in Washington. "The administration says,
'We're going to cut elsewhere in the budget,' but I don't see any strong
evidence that's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's position represents a substantial about-face for the president
on the subjects of balanced budgets and surpluses, one that analysts say
is only partly explained by the recession and the September terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Only a year ago, Bush and many other politicians relied heavily on a
projected 10-year, $5.6-trillion budget surplus to convince the nation it
could afford big tax cuts and expensive new programs such as a
prescription drug benefit for the elderly, and still eliminate the
federal debt.</TE>
<TE>   But with the latest estimates showing a $4-trillion drop in the
surplus, senior administration officials have taken to ridiculing the
very notion of making 10-year estimates and have suggested there is
little need for Washington to run big surpluses.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is these numbers oscillate wildly and are of very, very
little use," Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., director of Bush's Office of
Management and Budget, told reporters last week.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the precipitous drop in the 10-year surplus estimate
indicated that part of last year's tax cut should be delayed or repealed,
Daniels wryly suggested that that would be necessary only "if large
surpluses are the very center of your universe; if they come ahead of
fighting wars, defending the homeland or putting people to work."</TE>
<TE>Social Security Could Be Tapped</TE>
<TE>   In essence, analysts say Bush has made a two-pronged judgment about
the budget.</TE>
<TE>   The first is that the attacks and voters' support for the war on
terrorism give him ample political cover for changing his stand on key
budget matters.</TE>
<TE>   Only 12 months ago, for example, he was promising he would never touch
the portion of the surplus being amassed by Social Security in
anticipation of the baby boomers' retirement. Now the White House's own
deficit estimates show that the president is ready to spend that and more
for at least a few years.</TE>
<TE>   Second, Bush appears to have concluded that only with deficits can he
pull off the political trick of winning both short-term support from key
congressional Democrats and the long-term backing of conservative
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the president's proposals Tuesday, especially those
involving expanded education spending and extended jobless benefits,
appeared specifically crafted to attract liberal lions such as Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.).</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as expanded national service, reminded listeners of the
kind of politically appealing but low-cost measure once favored by former
President Clinton--what budget veteran Robert D. Reischauer described as
"a big box with a small present inside where everybody admires the
wrapping."</TE>
<TE>   But the presence of both kinds of proposals elicited barely a peep
from conservative analysts, such as Heritage Foundation economist Daniel
J.B. Mitchell.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is not launching a big fight about the size of
government," Mitchell said. "I wish he would, but I understand why he's
not."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell and other conservatives appear convinced that the return to
deficits will serve the cause of small government by eventually forcing
the kind of spending cuts that even their idol, Ronald Reagan, was unable
to make.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials from the president on down argue that the
administration's new budget plan will include serious spending cuts,
including a $9-billion reduction in federal aid to state highway programs
that would be especially painful for California.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said that what little is already known about the
president's plan demonstrates that these cuts will be overwhelmed by such
increases as boosting defense spending by $48 billion, doubling homeland
security expenditures and cutting taxes by an additional $90 billion this
fiscal year and $54 billion next in order to rev up the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be budget cuts, but in the scheme of things they won't be
the right scale to pay for the new costs," said Richard Kogan, a veteran
analyst at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.</TE>
<TE>   The administration is scheduled to release on Monday its budget plan
for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. But it has already said that it
will run deficits for several years and has estimated their size.</TE>
<TE>   Kogan said it appears that Bush expects to spend an extra $85 billion
over the current budget this fiscal year and that his proposals for next
fiscal year would cost an extra $66 billion. "If they were cutting
programs to offset the new costs, you wouldn't be getting these kinds of
increases," Kogan said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and White House officials such as Daniels have sought to portray
the administration's dip into deficits as a passing phase that will
correct itself as the economy recovers and the nation absorbs the new
costs of securing itself against terrorists.</TE>
<TE>Red Ink Indefinite With Tax Cut</TE>
<TE>   The budget director predicted that Washington will be back in the
black by fiscal 2005. Daniel Crippen, director of the Congressional
Budget Office, said last week that the return of surpluses could come a
year earlier, in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said there are reasons to believe the end of deficits
will be more fiction than fact.</TE>
<TE>   In congressional testimony, Crippen said the budget will be able to be
considered in the black in 2004 only if the Social Security surplus,
which Bush vowed last year not to touch, is included in the count. If the
Social Security money is not counted, the budget won't achieve a surplus
until the end of the decade, and then just barely.</TE>
<TE>   The surplus will not return to the size that it has run in recent
years until 2011 and 2012, according to the CBO estimates. And even then,
that's only because the budget office assumes the 10-year, $1.35-trillion
tax cut Bush advocated and Congress approved last year "sunsets" and goes
out of existence. Bush last night called for making the tax cut
permanent, which could extend the red ink indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>

<HD>Troops Uncovered Diagrams for Major U.S. Targets, Bush Says</HD>
<DH>Speech: Papers analyzed nuclear plants, water systems and
landmarks.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>American forces searching Al Qaeda hide-outs in Afghanistan have
discovered diagrams of American nuclear facilities, water treatment
plants and landmarks, President Bush said Tuesday, shedding new light on
the types of terrorist threats facing the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosures, made during Bush's first State of the Union address,
provided the most detailed glimpse to date of the intelligence gathered
in Afghanistan since the collapse of the Taliban regime.</LD>
<LD>   Bush also said "tens of thousands" of Al Qaeda terrorists had been
trained at the Afghanistan camps and remain deployed throughout the
world--a far higher figure than his administration had previously
provided.</LD>
<TE>   "Our discoveries in Afghanistan confirmed our worst fears, and show us
the true scope of the task ahead," Bush said. "We have found diagrams of
American nuclear power plants and public water facilities, detailed
instructions for making chemical weapons, surveillance maps of American
cities and thorough descriptions of landmarks in America and throughout
the world."</TE>
<TE>   A senior Bush administration official described the evidence as
previously classified and significant, and said it has alarmed the
president's inner circle since it was found during the military campaign
in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   By making the information public, the official said, the president was
attempting to brace the American people for a continued state of high
alert and the potential for more attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not been made public before," said the administration official,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "We had circumstantial evidence
in the past of this, that they were directly targeting America: monuments
and things like that. But now we know that it was all true.</TE>
<TE>   "We know from fragmentary intelligence that they were interested in
this kind of thing. But the fact that the president has mentioned it in a
State of the Union indicates the quality of the evidence," the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   Like other counter-terrorism experts in and out of government, the
official said Bush's remarks served to underscore the continuing threat
of Al Qaeda and its global network of semi-autonomous terrorist cells,
and to bolster his calls for additional military and homeland security
funding.</TE>
<TE>   "The lead-up time to an Al Qaeda attack is measured in months if not
years, so it is likely that additional attacks are already in the
operational stages," the official added. "This is a war that did not end
with the elimination of the Taliban, and we will all have to prepare
ourselves for that. There will be additional losses."</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Scott McClellan declined to elaborate on Bush's
remarks except to say that authorities around the nation have been kept
abreast of any terrorist threats gleaned from the evidence found in the
rubble of Afghanistan, as well as from interrogations of battlefield
detainees and other sources of information.</TE>
<TE>   "The law enforcement community throughout America has been made aware
of these threats," McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   In his 48-minute speech, Bush portrayed Al Qaeda as bent on the mass
killings of Americans through attacks on the nation's vulnerable points.</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear plants, water treatment facilities and landmarks have long
been described as potentially rich targets for terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony last summer, Ahmed Ressam, who was later convicted in a
plot to bomb Los Angeles International Airport, said he had been trained
in Al Qaeda camps to gauge the vulnerability of American power plants,
utilities and landmarks with the intention of bombing them to cause the
most casualties. Ultimately, he settled on LAX, but the plot was thwarted
when Ressam was arrested in December 1999 at the U.S.-Canadian border
with explosives in his rental car.</TE>
<TE>   Bush alluded repeatedly to the ongoing dangers posed by terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have found in Afghanistan confirms that, far from ending
there, our war against terror is only beginning," said Bush, who used the
speech to disclose other previously classified findings gleaned from the
four-month battle against the Taliban and Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the 19 men who hijacked planes on Sept. 11 were trained in
Afghanistan's camps, and so were tens of thousands of others," Bush said.
"Thousands of dangerous killers, schooled in the methods of murder, often
supported by outlaw regimes, are now spread throughout the world like
ticking time bombs, set to go off without warning."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Bush nor his senior aides disclosed specifics of the
intelligence findings gained in Afghanistan, such as which American
cities may have been targeted or at what time.</TE>
<TE>   But he did say tens of thousands of "trained terrorists" are plotting
attacks in at least a dozen countries.</TE>
<TE>   "A terrorist underworld--including groups like Hamas, Hezbollah,
Islamic Jihad and Jaish-e-Mohammed--operates in remote jungles and
deserts and hides in the centers of large cities," Bush said, adding that
a priority for the United States is to stop them from using chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   One senior administration official said 100,000 terrorists had been
trained in Afghan camps and that 10,000 to 15,000 of them have become Al
Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, a former Army intelligence officer, said Bush's
disclosures indicated credible threats.</TE>
<TE>   "There was enough of it to make it clear that these people absolutely
had the intention of attacking these facilities if they could," Peters
said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and other Pentagon officials have
previously said that information gleaned from Al Qaeda caves and homes
has included address books, computer disks, drawings and documents that
allude to potential attacks.</TE>
<TE>   One Al Qaeda haven in Kabul was found to have references to chemical
weapons and U.S. military manuals, among other things. Nevertheless,
defense officials have said they have not yet found any direct evidence
of weapons of mass destruction in more than four dozen laboratories and
other facilities that drew their attention.</TE>
<TE>   At the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, spokesman William Beecher said
he was unaware of any "specific, credible" threat against any nuclear
power plant.</TE>
<TE>   But Beecher said that until recently, information about plant design
and vulnerability was available from the industry and the commission
itself. Some nuclear power companies might have posted plant diagrams on
their Web sites before Sept. 11, "so to acquire a diagram might not have
been all that difficult," Beecher said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, reports on plant vulnerabilities were available in the
commission's public reading room and at other libraries, Beecher said.
Those reports were removed after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   At the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's trade group, spokesman
Steve Kerekes said the nation's 103 nuclear reactors, located in 31
states, are protected by 5,000 armed private security guards. About a
dozen states deployed National Guard troops outside of plants after Sept.
11, but some of them later withdrew the troops.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in a dangerous world. But we are extremely confident that we
have a very strong deterrent in place, in terms of the physical design of
our facilities, and very well-trained and highly competent security
forces on the ground," Kerekes said.</TE>

<HD>Japan Foreign Minister Fired Amid Feuding</HD>
<DH>Asia: Premier says controversies swirling around Makiko Tanaka
threatened to undermine his reform efforts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi sacked his flamboyant
foreign minister Tuesday amid concern that her latest feud with
bureaucrats and lawmakers was undermining his ability to reverse the
nation's deep economic slide.</LD>
<LD>   "The prime minister himself told me he was replacing me," Makiko
Tanaka told a legion of reporters after meeting with Koizumi. "I
responded by thanking him for all he has done for me."</LD>
<LD>   Koizumi said he decided to remove the 58-year-old Tanaka so that the
bickering wouldn't undercut passage of next year's budget. "I feel the
problems in the Foreign Ministry started to affect the entire government,
and parliamentary debate is my responsibility," he said. "That's why I
made this decision."</LD>
<TE>   Tanaka's departure could signal a turning point for Koizumi's
pro-reform administration, which is coming under increasing pressure from
the old guard.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a glorious day for the conservatives," said Shigenori
Okazaki, a political analyst with UBS Warburg. "They've been waiting for
this."</TE>
<TE>   The hugely popular Tanaka had been a prominent headline-grabber since
becoming Japan's first female foreign minister in April. She called for a
thorough housecleaning of her own ministry, which was reeling from a
multimillion-dollar slush fund scandal, and labeled her underlings "a
nest of devils" along the way.</TE>
<TE>   Even her supporters, however, acknowledge that she leaves a mixed
legacy. She quickly became mired in a series of petty disputes that
increasingly called into question her vision and her ability to manage a
large organization and wield power effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Ministry bureaucrats, meanwhile, backed by powerful
politicians, engaged in a death-by-1,000-leaks war against her that paid
off. Her every move became grist for Japan's gossipy weekly magazines as
they reported on her tantrums over not being invited to a garden party,
her accusations that staff members were stealing her jewelry and her
tardiness for or failure to show at appointments, including the apparent
snubbing of U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage on the
grounds she was "too busy."</TE>
<TE>   Her early support played an instrumental role in Koizumi's election,
and her popularity rating remains about 70%, rivaling the prime
minister's. She also brought many middle-aged female supporters into
Koizumi's camp. If they side with her in this political divorce, Koizumi
could suffer, a point even he has acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   "Makiko has represented the interests of common people," said Masako
Noda, a 42-year-old Tokyo homemaker. "I think confidence in Koizumi and
the government will weaken."</TE>
<TE>   Independent political analyst Minoru Morita said conservatives now
smell blood. Koizumi's popularity has been one of his few shields against
conservatives, and while he remains popular, the support is based more on
a lack of alternatives than the excitement the prime minister once
enjoyed, Morita said.</TE>
<TE>   The grass-roots political base that elected Koizumi also shows signs
of wavering, analysts add. Those in favor of substantive reform have been
disappointed by how little he has accomplished despite repeated promises
and catchy slogans. Others, meanwhile, are heaping blame on the
administration for record joblessness, the faltering economy and lower
public works budgets.</TE>
<TE>   The soap opera antics of the Cabinet also have distracted from Japan's
many tough issues, others say. "They're all like a bunch of kids
squabbling," said 71-year-old janitor Tae Kumagai. "It's out of control."</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi's handling of the most recent ruckus may also hurt him. The
squabble flared when the Foreign Ministry denied two nongovernmental
organizations access to an Afghan reconstruction conference in Tokyo last
week after they criticized the government.</TE>
<TE>   Media reports suggest that Tanaka's archrival, Muneo Suzuki, a
powerful member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, pressured Deputy
Foreign Minister Yoshiji Nogami to bar the groups' entry. Koizumi also
fired Nogami, and Suzuki has resigned from an influential foreign affairs
committee in parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Tanaka acted correctly this time by fighting publicly for
the groups' reinstatement.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi will try to avoid a complete Cabinet reshuffle, which would
probably lead to more anti-reform ministers joining his government. Early
rumblings are that he will assume the Foreign Ministry portfolio himself,
at least until President Bush arrives for a summit in mid-February. One
name being floated to replace Tanaka eventually is Sadako Ogata, a woman
and a former head of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.</TE>
<TE>   While Ogata may be highly respected, however, her experience in
domestic politics is minimal. That could make it relatively easy for
bureaucrats and politicians to manipulate her in the no-holds-barred
world of Japanese politics, some say.</TE>
<TE>   If her recent profile is any indication, Tanaka may remain a thorn in
Koizumi and the LDP's side. She refused Tuesday night to sign her
resignation letter, which could force Koizumi to fire her outright. And
she still commands significant support, which could make her effective
from the sidelines.</TE>

<HD>Big Bag Battle Opens S. Africa's War on Litter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>They're dubbed "roadside daisies" and South Africa's "national
flower." They flap from fences, hang in bushes and float on rivers.
They're thin plastic grocery bags, and they've become a national eyesore.</LD>
<LD>   The Environment Ministry wants to phase them out and introduce
thicker, reusable bags that officials believe would help alleviate the
country's mammoth litter problem. But manufacturers of plastic are
adamant that the government's proposed legislation would cripple the
industry and lead to job losses.</LD>
<LD>   The controversy over thin versus thick has galvanized South Africans
across the social spectrum. The issue has sparked debates over how best
to handle waste management and improve attitudes toward cleanliness and
recycling in a society that environmentalists say could win a prize for
its uninhibited ability to litter.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a largely undeveloped Third World community buying products
that are packaged for a First World environment," said Peter Ryan, a
senior lecturer at the University of Cape Town's Percy FitzPatrick
Institute of African Ornithology, who has studied the plastic bag issue.</TE>
<TE>   In a nation short on both garbage-collection sites and public
education about the consequences of littering, people often throw trash
in the street. The thin plastic bags, given out by supermarkets and
shops, are easily dispersed by wind and water, clogging drains, choking
livestock and spoiling landscapes.</TE>
<TE>   In a move to cut down on the number of such bags, the government
introduced the legislation last year to replace 18-micron sacks with
thicker 30-micron plastic bags. Within six months of that move,
manufacturers would be required to increase the thickness to 80 microns.
A micron is one thousandth of a millimeter.</TE>
<TE>   Specifics of the regulation are being ironed out and might be
finalized as soon as next month, environmental officials said. If
Parliament passes the law, it would take a year to fully go into effect.
Manufacturers and retailers who defy the ban on thin bags would face
fines up to $10,000, jail terms not exceeding 10 years, or both.</TE>
<TE>   The aim is to encourage shoppers to both reuse and recycle the
higher-quality bags and lessen litter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a waste management issue," said Phindile Makwakwa, spokeswoman
for the Environment Ministry. "When you have thicker bags, they are
easier to recycle and are good quality when recycled. Government is out
to launch an all-out war against litter."</TE>
<TE>   But manufacturers, unions and shop managers oppose the legislation,
saying it would shut down production here and force many retailers to
import plastic bags.</TE>
<TE>   "The equipment for making thin bags cannot simply be converted and
changed around to make the thick bags," said Bill Naude, executive
director of the Plastics Federation of South Africa. "Thick bags require
a different type of process and equipment. It is unlikely that any of the
companies currently making bags would be willing to reinvest."</TE>
<TE>   The federation has suggested increasing the thickness of bags to 25
microns so its members can keep their current machines.</TE>
<TE>   The thin plastic bags are made primarily from high-density
polyethylene, a crystalline substance. Thicker bags require low-density
polyethylene.</TE>
<TE>   Dow Chemical is South Africa's only manufacturer of the high-density
polyethylene from which thin bags are made. The multi-national company
produces about 165,000 tons of plastic a year in South Africa, of which
about a quarter is used for supermarket bags and other thin-gauge sacks.
The company does not produce the type of polyethylene needed for thicker
bags.</TE>
<TE>   A report compiled last year by the National Economic Development and
Labor Council, a government-funded legal advisory group that reviewed the
proposed law, concluded that if thin bags were outlawed, Dow Plastics
could lose up to $7 million a year in profits and the government up to
$2.1 million annually in taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "So for us, [the ban] will have a significant impact," said Toni
Whittal, the Johannesburg-based communications manager at Dow Plastics.
"If the legislation goes through on these bags, what's to say the
government will not then start with plastic bottles? Where does it end?"</TE>
<TE>   The advisory group also found that more than 70,000 jobs could be lost
if South Africa's plastic-bag makers go into decline. Renay Koopman, 24,
an employee of Nampak Polyfoil at its Cape Town plastics manufacturing
plant, dreads the thought of such a downturn. "How will we get new jobs?
There are no jobs in this country," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials say production of thicker bags and increased
recycling would create jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of thin bags argue that the change would hurt consumers, as
manufacturers and stores pass on higher costs. The proposed measure goes
against efforts to do more with less material, they say, and would outlaw
a free item widely reused by consumers. They predict that stores will
have to start charging consumers for the thick bags.</TE>
<TE>   However, Ray Lombard, chairman of South Africa's National Recycling
Forum, said consumers should not be deceived by the notion that thin bags
are free.</TE>
<TE>   "None of these shopping companies are philanthropic organizations," he
said. "You're paying for [the bags] somewhere along the line."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of thin bags insist that the product is being unfairly
blamed for the nation's litter problem. Surveys commissioned by Shoprite
Checkers Group, Africa's largest supermarket chain, show that plastic
bags constitute 5% to 10% of roadside litter and 21% of beach litter,
according to Whitey Basson, chief executive of the 800-store company. The
remaining trash is mostly paper, glass, tin and non-biodegradable
products.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is [general] litter, but they're hammering the thin
plastic bag," said Whittal of Dow Plastics.</TE>
<TE>   That's because they are the most conspicuous trash offender,
government officials and environmentalists say. They are hopeful that the
higher quality of thicker bags will increase both reuse and recycling.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan, the university lecturer, said numerous studies show that the
best way to persuade shoppers to preserve bags is to make them pay for
them.</TE>
<TE>   "It would get them to appreciate the bags and encourage them to bring
their own," Ryan said. "People will only change their behavior if it
affects them in their pocket."</TE>
<TE>   Already, 13% of the total plastic used each year is recycled,
according to industry officials, but this has not prevented an
overwhelming buildup of trash.</TE>
<TE>   The Environment Ministry's Makwakwa said the government plans to
launch an education and awareness campaign, with municipalities competing
for the title of Cleanest Town.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the government remains adamant that thinner bags must go.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to roll up our sleeves and clean up our country,"
Environmental Affairs Minister Mohammed Valli Moosa recently told a local
newspaper. "These regulations on plastic bags are a start of a broader
look at waste management. Simply put, we as a nation have to start to
recover a higher percentage of our waste, lest we drown in our own
garbage."</TE>

<HD>Anger Mounts Over Deadly Blast</HD>
<DH>Nigeria: Residents blame the military for explosion at weapons
depot. More than 600 bodies have been recovered from canals.</DH>

<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya
</DL>
<LD>Angry residents of Nigeria's largest city called Tuesday for the
country's military to be held accountable for the deaths of hundreds of
people who tried to flee a huge explosion at an army munitions depot over
the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Late Tuesday, rescue workers were still retrieving bodies from
drainage canals that people had jumped or driven their vehicles into in a
panicked attempt to escape a series of blasts. People who plunged into
the canals, which were partly covered with water hyacinths, apparently
thought the water was shallow, witnesses said. Unable to swim, many
drowned within minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities confirmed that more than 600 bodies had been recovered.
Most of the victims were the wives and children of soldiers stationed at
the Ikeja base, one of several military facilities crammed into densely
populated Lagos.</LD>
<TE>   Some Nigerian news agencies reported that the death toll could reach
2,000 because hundreds of people were still missing. Dozens of children
who fled their homes were being sheltered in mosques, churches and police
stations as authorities searched for their parents.</TE>
<TE>   Lagos residents said they were still traumatized by the three hours of
explosions that set off rockets, rained down shrapnel and lighted the
Sunday night sky with huge fireballs.</TE>
<TE>   They told reporters that they first thought the artillery blasts were
another coup. Nigeria has suffered several successful coups and 30 years
of military rule since gaining independence from Britain in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   The country has been on edge for the last several months amid a wave
of ethnic and religious violence that has left hundreds of people dead.
Nigeria's much-admired attorney general and justice minister, Bola Ige,
was among several prominent politicians who have been assassinated
recently.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday evening, President Olusegun Obasanjo visited the explosion
site and declared a national day of mourning. Drowning out angry hecklers
who accused his government of negligence, Obasanjo promised help for the
survivors and said a military panel would investigate the explosion, the
cause of which remained unknown.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened in Lagos was a monumental tragedy," Obasanjo, who was
elected nearly three years ago, said in a televised address to the
nation. "Over 600 people, mostly children and youths, died. . . . It was
a national disaster."</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1970s, when he was the country's military ruler, Obasanjo
ordered the renovation of the Ikeja munitions depot. Since then, the
base, along with other military facilities in Lagos, has fallen into
disrepair.</TE>
<TE>   Blame for the explosion fell mainly on military leaders. Members of
the Army Wives Assn. said that a smaller blast had erupted at the
barracks' weapons dump last year and that the base's top officers had
been warned that the area was unsafe for soldiers, their families and the
thousands of people who live in a surrounding neighborhood of
middle-class homes.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most vocal critics of the military was Lagos state Gov. Bola
Tinubu, a former political prisoner. He charged that the explosion "was
not caused by any government but by the military."</TE>
<TE>   Leading human rights activists called on Obasanjo to appoint an
independent commission of inquiry--not a military panel--to investigate
the blast.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot trust the army to find the right answers," Ayo Obe, the
president of the Civil Liberties Organization, Nigeria's oldest human
rights group, told The Times. "The army is not going to tell us why all
these heavy bombs were stashed in the center of this neighborhood, or why
there was no disaster preparedness to help the people."</TE>
<TE>   Tinubu, the state governor, urged the military to remove all its heavy
artillery from the bases in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "They could put their weapons and bombs a safer distance from the
people," he said.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WOOMERA, Australia
</DL>
<LD>A two-week hunger strike by mainly Afghan asylum seekers at a
detention center in the Australian desert ended today after government
negotiators struck a deal with protesters, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "We've had a real breakthrough," said Ray Funnell, a member of a
government-appointed committee that met the protesters today. "The
Afghanis are no longer on hunger strike."</LD>
<LD>   About 175 Afghan and Middle Eastern detainees at Woomera had not eaten
for nearly two weeks. They had grown increasingly weak as dehydration and
temperatures as high as 104 degrees took their toll.</LD>
<TE>   Some detainees had also tried to hang themselves, had drunk
disinfectant or had sewn up their lips to protest the length of time it
takes--months, and sometimes years--to process asylum claims.</TE>
<TE>   They also demanded to be moved to a less isolated detention center
than Woomera.</TE>
<TE>   A suicide threat by 11 Afghan teenagers at the camp also appeared to
be fading after they extended a 5 p.m. Tuesday deadline for a week,
signaling an end to two weeks of pressure on the government over its hard
stance against illegal immigrants.</TE>

<HD>No Survivors in Jet Crash in Colombia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>CUMBAL, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>Searchers found the wreckage of an Ecuadorean jetliner in
Colombia's Andes mountains Tuesday and said all 92 people on board had
been killed in Monday's crash.</LD>
<LD>   Colombian troops discovered the wreckage of TAME airlines Flight 120
strewn on the slopes of the Cumbal volcano near the Ecuadorean border,
but they found no survivors.</LD>
<LD>   "The plane is destroyed. There are no survivors," said Alvaro Bucheli,
the mayor of Cumbal.</LD>
<TE>   Colombian air force Gen. Hector Velasco said the plane exploded on
impact.</TE>
<TE>   A large chunk of rock broke loose from the volcano and fell on the
plane, which hit the mountain about 1,000 feet below the summit, Velasco
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Boeing 727-100 lost radio contact Monday as it circled over
Ipiales, Colombia, to maneuver around the snowcapped mountains while on
its way to the Ecuadorean border town of Tulcan.</TE>
<TE>   The airline said there were 83 passengers, seven of them children, and
nine crew members aboard.</TE>
<TE>   At least 43 passengers were believed to be Colombians flying to Cali,
Colombia, the final stop on the plane's itinerary, said Martin Gonzales,
a spokesman for Colombia's civil aviation authority.</TE>
<TE>   The passengers also included two Spaniards, two Italians, one French
citizen, one German, one Mexican and one Cuban, said a TAME spokeswoman
in Ecuador.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Cesar Naranjo, head of the Directorate of Civil Aviation in
Ecuador, said searchers were looking for the flight data recorder, which
might offer clues to the cause of the crash.</TE>
<TE>   In Cali, relatives of passengers waited desperately for news.</TE>
<TE>   "We assume that because of the bad weather, [the pilot] momentarily
lost visibility, tried to find the airport, but ran into the mountain,"
Velasco said.</TE>
<TE>   The crash was the deadliest airline accident in Colombia since an
American Airlines jet slammed into the mountains near Cali in December
1995, killing 159 people. Four people survived that crash.</TE>

<HD>Israel Considers Making a Fortress of Jerusalem</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Plan to use fences, roadblocks and foot patrols would
ostensibly deter suicide bombers. Critics say it would add to problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israeli security chiefs presented plans to the government Tuesday
to surround Jerusalem with fences, roadblocks, ditches and foot patrols
to prevent more of the Palestinian suicide bombings that have wreaked
havoc in the city in recent weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The National Security Council's plan, known as "Enveloping Jerusalem,"
also calls for checkpoints and electronic surveillance between West and
East Jerusalem that critics say would in effect repartition the contested
city without ensuring Israeli security.</LD>
<LD>   The government denies that there would be any physical or de facto
division of Jerusalem between Jewish and Palestinian neighborhoods, but
it acknowledges that movement into, out of and around the city would be
more difficult under the plan.</LD>
<TE>   "The concept is to put an obstacle on the road of those who are trying
to penetrate the city for terrorist activities. But a wall inside the
city, that's nonsense," said Raanan Gissin, a spokesman for Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon. "It will not be easy for the Palestinian residents
of East Jerusalem, nor for the Jewish population. Everyone will have to
contend with the new measures."</TE>
<TE>   Police and security officials reportedly had proposed fences or walls
to divide parts of Jerusalem. But for Sharon and right-wing members of
his government, a wall would signal a willingness by Israel to cede part
of the city to the Palestinians and would symbolize a return to pre-1967
borders, before Israel captured East Jerusalem and the West Bank from
Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Most Israelis insist that Jerusalem is the "eternal, undivided
capital" of Israel and reject Palestinian claims to East Jerusalem as the
capital of a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Israel Radio reported that Sharon altered the proposal to put
some suburbs of Jerusalem now ruled by the Palestinian Authority under
the Israeli security net, in effect cutting them off from the rest of the
West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials denounced the Jerusalem plan, saying that the
city's security problems cannot be solved with more checkpoints and
border patrols.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a long, open border, and the ones who do these operations
inside Israel know all the ways and means to get in," said Ziad abu Ziad,
the Palestinian Authority minister responsible for Jerusalem affairs.
"This will not help. What will help everybody is to find a solution to
the conflict."</TE>
<TE>   The Jerusalem security plan was drafted months ago but shelved as
impractical and expensive until a bombing Sunday on downtown Jaffa Street
that left two people dead and 14 hospitalized from their wounds. It was
the second attack on Jaffa Street in six days and the seventh in central
Jerusalem in less than 15 months.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since the Palestinian uprising began in September
2000, the attacker was a woman. On Tuesday, police were still trying to
determine her identity and whether she blew herself up intentionally or
accidentally, perhaps with the bomb detonating prematurely.</TE>
<TE>   No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the bomber has
not been celebrated as a shahid, or martyr, as normally happens with male
assailants. The woman reportedly carried a bag, whereas suicide bombers
typically wear explosives strapped to their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   A female suicide bomber would signal a change in tactics by the
extremist Palestinian organizations and present a new challenge to
Israeli security forces.</TE>
<TE>   The Jerusalem security plan would cost about $35 million and see
hundreds of additional troops patrolling the 33-mile municipal boundary
that Israel has drawn around Jerusalem, Gissin said. After he was briefed
on the plan, Sharon sent it to his Security Cabinet for closer
examination.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's office declined to confirm details of the plan and berated
government officials for having leaked some elements to the Israeli
press.</TE>
<TE>   According to Israeli media, the plan calls for separating Jerusalem
from the West Bank by means of roadblocks, ditches and other barriers.
Palestinian suburbs of East Jerusalem such as Anata and Abu Dis--under
Palestinian political control but Israeli security control--would be
inside the Israeli security enclosure.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is also said to call for a seven-mile fence separating the
southern Jewish neighborhoods of Jerusalem from the West Bank, but Sharon
reportedly opposes such a lengthy barrier.</TE>
<TE>   "In some places, there will be a fence," Gissin said. "A fence is
necessary, but not sufficient. A fence is not control. You get control by
the deployment of troops . . . and intelligence."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli media reported that roadblocks would be set up along a "seam
line" between Jewish West Jerusalem and Palestinian areas of East
Jerusalem and reinforced by a "soft wall" of video cameras, thermal
sensors and patrols with night surveillance equipment. By Tuesday night,
Israeli radio was calling the proposal "the separation plan."</TE>
<TE>   Some critics oppose the plan on political grounds as a concession to
Palestinian control of East Jerusalem. Others say it would create more
problems than it would solve in a city built on seven hills, with a
patchwork of Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   "Once again, Jerusalem will be a walled city. It won't work," said
Menachem Klein, a political scientist at Tel Aviv's Bar Ilan University.</TE>
<TE>   To most Israelis, he said, realizing the plan would amount to "a
unilateral withdrawal. It says that what is outside the wall is not our
interest." Meanwhile, he added, Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem
would be squeezed between "two fences"--one separating Jerusalem from the
West Bank and another series of checkpoints around West Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   "You will motivate East Jerusalemites to be active in the intifada,"
Klein said.</TE>
<TE>   Israel Kimhi, an urban planner with the Jerusalem Institute for Israel
Studies, added, "A Berlin Wall from any point of view is problematic." He
said that internal checkpoints would make life miserable for Jewish and
Arab residents and that a security ring around Jerusalem would cut off
the city from its suburbs and surrounding areas.</TE>
<TE>   "Jerusalem will become a kind of dead end," Kimhi said.</TE>
<TE>   Gissin countered that the government has no intention of either boxing
in Palestinians or creating walls through the city. He said the
checkpoints between East and West Jerusalem would be movable, not
permanent.</TE>
<TE>   "It is supposed to be a flexible system," Gissin said.</TE>

<LD>Russian troops attacked a Chechen rebel base and killed 19 fighters
blamed for an assault on a military helicopter, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The Mi-8 helicopter made an emergency landing Monday in the Vedeno
area, injuring two of the 16 troops aboard, after it was fired on by a
large-caliber submachine gun, an official with Chechnya's pro-Moscow
government said on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   The clash followed Sunday's crash in Chechnya of another Mi-8
helicopter that killed all 14 people aboard. The crash was initially
blamed on rebels, but Russian officials have raised the possibility of an
accidental explosion.</LD>

<HD>Afghans Say U.S. Erred, Seized Police</HD>

<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. military mistakenly seized a district police chief and
other local leaders loyal to the new government in a deadly raid and has
now promised to free them, Afghan authorities said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests came last week in a raid by U.S. Special Forces soldiers
that Afghan officials portrayed as a mission gone awry. At least 15
Afghans were killed and 27 taken prisoner in the incident north of
Kandahar. Afghan authorities say the police were collecting weapons from
local militiamen.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon has insisted that the Special Forces troops attacked a
legitimate military target in the raid last Wednesday on an ammunition
dump, which U.S. intelligence analysts believed Al Qaeda or Taliban
forces were using. One U.S. soldier was wounded in the ankle during the
raid.</LD>
<TE>   However, the spokesman for Kandahar Gov. Gul Agha Shirzai said those
captured included the district police chief, his deputy and members of
the district council--all loyal to the interim government led by Prime
Minister Hamid Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Yusuf Pushtoon, the spokesman, said the Kandahar
administration has asked the Americans for clarification of the
detainees' status and the reasons they are being held.</TE>
<TE>   Pushtoon said the Americans have promised to begin releasing some of
the detainees in the next few days. A spokesman for the U.S. military,
Capt. Tony Rivers, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Local Afghans say that Taliban fighters were handing over weapons at
the site and that some of the pro-government figures collecting the arms
were killed in the U.S. raid.</TE>

<HD>Boost in Olympic Security Sought</HD>
<DH>Sports: Organizers request as many as 60 more officers to
supplement the 10,000 already planned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>In a bid to further shore up security at next month's Winter
Olympics, organizers have asked federal officials for as many as 60 added
law enforcement personnel, authorities said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The additional officers, who would supplement a force of 10,000 police
and military personnel already committed to the Games, would be placed at
transit hubs and open-air spaces--for instance, at a pedestrian mall on
Main Street in Park City.</LD>
<LD>   Crowds are expected to gather nightly on the mall to take in Olympic
action on big-screen televisions that will be set up at either end of
Main Street. The upscale mountain resort will play host to the snowboard
and alpine giant slalom events during the Games, which begin Feb. 8.</LD>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, who toured the Olympic facilities two weeks
ago to get an overview of the $310-million security plan, was concerned
about the vulnerability of open-air parks and gathering spots that are
separate from the venues used for Olympic competitions, according to a
law enforcement official in Washington who asked to not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   It was at such a site at the Summer Games in 1996--Centennial Park in
downtown Atlanta--that a bomb exploded, killing one person and injuring
more than 100. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, fears about terrorism during
the Games in Salt Lake City have increased.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing on lessons learned from the Atlanta Games, officials at the
2002 Olympics have fenced off a central plaza in downtown Salt Lake City,
where Olympic medals will be awarded and big-name entertainers will
perform each night. To get in, fans will have to pass through an
airport-style metal detector.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything we had identified as Olympic-related we put denial systems
up and protective systems up," said Robert Flowers, the top Olympic
security officer.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, that had left "areas such as transportation hubs and
areas where . . . people are going to walk and enjoy."</TE>
<TE>   Flowers, commander of the Utah Olympic Public Safety Command, added:
"We've got 10,000 law enforcement people here. We're asking for 30 to 60
more. You're talking about putting them in areas we're light on."</TE>
<TE>   Harking back to Atlanta six years ago, Flowers also reiterated that
planners have long been concerned about domestic as well as international
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Survivalist Eric Robert Rudolph is wanted in connection with the
Atlanta Olympics attack. Well before Sept. 11, "it has always caused us
great concern," Flowers said, speaking of a domestic terrorist attack.
"It's the environment we live in in today's world."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, he said, organizers have sought to strike a balance
so that fans and athletes will not feel suffocated by tight security.</TE>
<TE>   Flowers observed: "It's like I've always said: How much fence do we
put up? You can't fence off the state of Utah."</TE>
<TE>   Security at certain Olympic venues is already unmistakably tight.
During a video conference call with reporters Tuesday, Dick Ebersol,
chairman of NBC Sports, described it as "tight but polite."</TE>
<TE>   He added that certain sights were unusual but, in the aftermath of
Sept. 11, weirdly welcome: "I find it kind of strange to go out to the
men's room and find myself bookended on either side by Army men with M-16
rifles hanging at their side."</TE>
<TE>   In measure because of the 10,000 security personnel, Homeland Security
Director Thomas J. Ridge declared during a visit to Salt Lake City
earlier this month that the Games will be "one of the safest places on
the globe." President Bush is expected to attend the Games' opening
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have also ratcheted up security at the Salt Lake City
International Airport to guard against terrorist threats. Last month,
following efforts to boost requirements for airport workers, officials
indicted 69 people on charges of falsifying documents.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft came away from his visit to Salt Lake City "very pleased with
the security, but he had some very specific suggestions for improvement.
He saw a few gaps that he wanted to plug," the law enforcement official
said. "But when you're talking about adding a few dozen people to a staff
of thousands, it's hard to characterize that as major."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokeswoman Barbara Comstock said that Ashcroft was
"tremendously impressed with the unprecedented and seamless cooperation
of over 60 agencies involved in the Olympics and the cooperative
leadership in place to provide security."</TE>

<HD>Jeb Bush's Daughter Held in Prescription Fraud</HD>
<DH>Arrest: Noelle Bush is jailed after she allegedly tried to buy an
anti-anxiety drug by posing as a doctor. She was released on bail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI
</DL>
<LD>Noelle Bush, daughter of Florida's governor and niece of President
Bush, was arrested early Tuesday as she allegedly tried to buy an
anti-anxiety drug with a fake prescription.</LD>
<LD>   After being detained at the drive-up window of a pharmacy in
Tallahassee, Florida's capital, the 24-year-old woman, who appeared "very
shaky" to police, was taken to jail for booking on a third-degree felony
charge of prescription fraud. She was released on $1,000 bond,
Tallahassee police spokesman Scott Hunt said.</LD>
<LD>   In a terse statement later in the day, Gov. Jeb Bush and his wife
tacitly admitted that the second-oldest of their three children had
developed a drug problem and asked for public understanding.</LD>
<TE>   "Columba and I are deeply saddened over an incident that occurred last
night involving our daughter, Noelle," the couple said. "This is a very
serious problem. Unfortunately, substance abuse is an issue confronting
many families across our nation. We ask the public and the media to
respect our family's privacy during this difficult time so that we can
help our daughter."</TE>
<TE>   Despite that plea, media attention was instant and enormous, with
cable channels like CNN playing the arrest as one of the top news items
of the day. It was the latest brush with the law for the nation's
extended first family. President Bush's twin daughters, Jenna and
Barbara, have both been charged with underage drinking.</TE>
<TE>   After his first failed race for Florida's governorship in 1994, Bush
said one of his children had developed what he described at the time as a
short-term drug problem. He never specified whether it was Noelle or one
of her brothers, George, 25, or Jebby, 18.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Columba Bush, who admitted she is very uncomfortable in the
public spotlight, began visiting the state's schools at least twice a
month after Bush's successful 1998 campaign to preach the dangers of drug
and alcohol abuse. The only other cause she has associated herself with
is promoting art appreciation among the young.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's Republican governor, who is running for reelection this
year, has tried to keep his family life off-limits to the media, but he
has let drop at least one hint that his daughter has been beset by
difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   On April 28, 2000, Bush was the commencement speaker when Noelle, an
art student, graduated from Tallahassee Community College with more than
200 classmates. He loved community colleges, the governor announced,
because they are "citadels of second chances."</TE>
<TE>   Noelle Bush, who lives alone in Tallahassee, attended Florida State
University during the 2000-01 academic year but did not return last
autumn. When questioned Tuesday by police, she said she was supposed to
start a new job later that morning as an administrative assistant at a
software company.</TE>
<TE>   Noelle Bush was arrested outside a Walgreen's when the druggist became
suspicious over a phoned-in prescription left on the answering machine.
Police sources said the order had been for Xanax, which is used to treat
anxiety disorders and panic attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Zimmerman, the pharmacist on duty, became suspicious after a
female, identifying herself as Dr. Noel Scidmore, called in the
prescription for Noelle Bush. When the druggist phoned the doctor's
answering service for confirmation, a colleague informed him that Dr.
Scidmore was no longer practicing in Tallahassee. When the governor's
daughter showed up at the drive-up window around 1:15 a.m. in her white
Volkswagen Beetle to pick up the pills, the druggist called police.</TE>
<TE>   According to one of the police officers sent to investigate, Noelle
Bush denied posing as Dr. Scidmore but acknowledged the number left by
the purported doctor in fact belonged to her. Another policeman on the
scene listened to the taped order for Xanax and concluded the voice
appeared "identical" to Noelle Bush's.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's daughter was read her rights, handcuffed, searched and
taken to the Leon County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush appeared very shaky during interview but calmed considerably
after being placed under arrest," the arresting officer wrote in his
report.</TE>
<TE>   According to Wade White, a prosecutor in the Leon County state
attorney's office, the third-degree felony of prescription fraud carries
a maximum prison term of five years and a fine of $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   However, said White, "it's very unlikely anyone who was a first-time
offender . . . would receive a sentence like that." Officials in the
state attorney's office said they doubted the case would even come to
trial.</TE>
<TE>   The governor and Columba Bush, in their statement, said they would
make no further comment. Officials in the governor's press office also
said they could provide no information to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Florida motor vehicle records show that since 1995, Noelle Bush has
received seven speeding tickets, been cited for five other traffic
violations and been involved in three automobile crashes, according to
Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Last May, Jenna Bush, one of the president's daughters, was charged
with using someone else's identification to try to buy a margarita at a
Texas restaurant, and her sister, Barbara, was charged with underage
drinking.</TE>
<TE>   The charges were dropped after the twins performed community service,
attended alcohol awareness classes and paid $100 fines. A separate
underage drinking charge in April against Jenna Bush went on her record
as a conviction because of the restaurant violation. A judge fined her
$500 and suspended her driver's license.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1999, Columba Bush, Noelle's mother, was caught trying to
bring in $19,000 worth of clothes and jewelry from a Paris shopping spree
without paying duty. Florida's first lady was fined $4,100 and became the
butt of jokes on late-night television.</TE>

<HD>Indian Presence at Games Falls Short</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Despite efforts to showcase tribes from across the
country, only five from Utah will participate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>Larry Blackhair has spent three years encouraging more than 250
Indian tribes across the country to showcase their culture and commerce
at the 2002 Winter Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   But when the world tunes into the Games next week, only the five
tribes of Utah will be participating.</LD>
<LD>   Blackhair said no other tribes expressed interest in the Olympics.
Some tribal leaders, however, said they were interested but never
received effective guidance on how to participate.</LD>
<TE>   Others said they felt no compelling reason to show a Native American
presence at the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm excited for the tribes that are involved, because this will be
the world's largest billboard," said Blackhair, a member of a local Ute
Indian tribe, for which this state is named. "I don't want to give this a
negative spin. It hasn't worked out as we thought it would, but I'm still
excited."</TE>
<TE>   The Native American communities' fractured efforts to better
capitalize on a global television audience reflect historical
difficulties coordinating the nation's tribes. As sovereign nations, the
tribes seldom work together--and frequently compete--except on matters of
overriding importance involving federal policies, such as Indian casinos,
reservation trusts and social services.</TE>
<TE>   Expectations for Native American involvement were high, given the
emotional impact when aboriginal runner Cathy Freeman lighted the Olympic
caldron at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney. (In these Winter Games, one
U.S. athlete is a Native American: Naomi Lang, a four-time U.S. champion
ice dancer and a member of the Karuk tribe near Sacramento.)</TE>
<TE>   Olympic organizing officials say no other U.S.-hosted Games have
sought the tribes' involvement to such a degree. Despite intentions,
however, their presence will be minimal.</TE>
<TE>   It will start Monday, when the Olympic torch crosses into Utah and
into the hands of five Native Americans, including Blackhair. The tribes
also will be represented during the opening ceremony's cast of thousands.</TE>
<TE>   The most prominent Native American display during the 17-day Olympic
run will come from the Navajo Nation, the largest tribe in the U.S. with
250,000 members and whose reservation spreads into Utah. Though the
Navajo Nation contributed financially to the joint Indian effort, it
plans to showcase its art, culture and economic opportunities inside its
own $1.5-million pavilion, constructed alongside a new outdoor shopping
mall downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to generate new dollars on our reservation, and this is a
tourism-related event in our backyard," said Roberta John, spokesperson
for the tribe. "We want the world--and corporate America--to see us."</TE>
<TE>   Utah's other four tribes, meanwhile, will share a 55-foot-tall tepee
that is being constructed near Olympic skiing events outside Park City.
On Tuesday, large steel girders leaned skyward against one another,
awaiting their canvas draping.</TE>
<TE>   Of about $70,000 that Blackhair raised, $25,000 was spent on the
tepee. It's unclear how much money will be left over to fill its interior
with displays and entertainment, said Blackhair, who will retain about
10% of the total funds as his fund-raising fee.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to coordinate Indian involvement in the Games stumbled despite
an early start in 1998, when Blackhair began his work at the request of
Utah Tribal Leaders, which represents the state's tribal councils.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest Cuch, executive director of the Utah Division of Indian
Affairs, contacted Olympic organizers on behalf of the tribes. "We had to
knock on the door a few times, just to call their attention to the need
to involve us, but once we got through, they were quick to open up to
us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Eynon, senior vice president for international relations for the
Salt Lake Organizing Committee, said the Indians' participation would add
a "Western flavor" to the Games and help the tribes counter stereotypes.</TE>
<TE>   "Their culture is part of the tapestry of the area," said Don Mischer,
producer of the Games' opening ceremonies. "It's important they be
represented in the ceremonies, as an element of the American West."</TE>
<TE>   While Olympic organizers were happy to highlight the Indian culture,
Blackhair was left to organize the effort. He established the Native
American 2002 Foundation and said he sent out letters and e-mails to the
nation's tribes to seek participation. But the one-man effort quickly
fell apart because of disorganization or lack of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Among his single largest contributions was $15,000 from the
Shoshone-Bannock Indians in Idaho. Tribal leaders said they were told by
Blackhair that the donation would buy them the designation of "host
tribe" for the Olympics. When informed that they instead would simply be
the host tribe for the foundation, they withdrew their participation.</TE>
<TE>   California tribes are absent too, even though Blackhair said he
specifically sought their involvement because of their wealth accrued
from casinos.</TE>
<TE>   "We had two meetings with someone from the Olympics," said David
Barron, spokesman for the Barona tribe northeast of San Diego, "but we
never received any specific information."</TE>
<TE>   The tribal government manager for the Viejas Indians, east of San
Diego, said she recalled receiving information from the Shoshone-Bannock
Indians about participating, before that tribe quit its short-lived role.
But the Viejas tribe never had contact with Blackhair, said Penny
Culbreth-Graft.</TE>
<TE>   "The more we can share and showcase our story, especially at such a
positive event as the Olympics if it's done right, we would want to do
that," she said. "But we wouldn't participate without the proper
invitation from the local tribes."</TE>
<TE>   Despite local intentions and the interest of some individual tribes,
participation in the Olympics paled compared to other tribal issues, said
Jacqueline Johnson, executive director of the National Congress of
American Indians, the primary lobbying arm for the country's nearly 600
federally recognized tribes.</TE>
<TE>   "Tribes today are dealing with issues that are literally
life-and-death ones for our communities," she said. "To be completely
honest, when native people are going without adequate housing, health and
other basic human needs, planning for the Olympics really isn't high on
the priority list for tribes."</TE>

<HD>Mineta to Have Surgery to Replace His Left Hip</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta, who is overseeing the
creation of an aviation security system, will undergo surgery to replace
his left hip later this week, a department spokesman said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "He has a painful condition that has had an impact on his mobility,
and he was finally convinced to get it taken care of," spokesman Chet
Lunner said.</LD>
<LD>   Convalescence from hip replacement surgery usually takes several
months, but Lunner said that Mineta intends to remain engaged in leading
the department.</LD>
<TE>   Mineta, 70, a former longtime congressman from San Jose, is the only
Democrat in President Bush's Cabinet. On Sept. 11, he rushed to the White
House after hijacked jets struck the World Trade Center. Working from an
underground bunker with Vice President Dick Cheney and key staff, he
ordered the Federal Aviation Administration to ground more than 4,500
planes that were airborne at the time.</TE>
<TE>   His aides say Mineta has been putting in 14 hours or more a day since
then, first negotiating with Congress over a bill that placed the
government directly in charge of airport security, and more recently
guiding the establishment of the new transportation security agency.</TE>
<TE>   Hip replacement is a common surgical procedure, usually prescribed for
chronic problems, such as severe arthritis. Lunner said he did not know
the underlying condition prompting Mineta's surgery. The operation is
scheduled for early Thursday at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.</TE>

<HD>Gephardt Issues Call for Compromise</HD>
<DH>Politics: Democrat, in party's response to Bush's speech, urges
rivals to cooperate on economic policy and campaign reform.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) challenged
President Bush on Tuesday to compromise on economic policy and embrace
campaign finance reform, as Democrats continued to probe for
election-year vulnerabilities in an administration with commanding public
approval ratings.</LD>
<LD>   Delivering the televised Democratic response to Bush's State of the
Union address, Gephardt reiterated what has become his party's mantra
since Sept. 11: that it backs the White House completely on the war on
terrorism. But Gephardt said Bush and his fellow Republicans should
respond with greater cooperation on bread-and-butter domestic issues.</LD>
<LD>   "I refuse to accept that while we stand shoulder-to-shoulder on the
war, we should stand toe-to-toe on the economy," Gephardt said. "We need
to find a way to respect each other, and trust each other, and work
together to solve the long-term challenges America faces. I'm ready to
roll up my sleeves and go to work."</LD>
<TE>   To that end, Gephardt called on the White House to convene a
bipartisan summit to address the nation's economic recession, a proposal
the administration has already dismissed as a political stunt.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Gephardt called for the two parties to work more closely on
the domestic agenda, he sought to depict Democrats as more attuned to the
public on those issues. For instance, he said that Democrats are
committed to "helping the unemployed--not just large corporations and the
most fortunate."</TE>
<TE>   And he invoked the Enron Corp. scandal, saying the company's ties to
the administration and Capitol Hill through millions of dollars in
political donations spotlight the need for campaign finance reform.</TE>
<TE>   "If the nation's largest bankruptcy coupled with a clear example of
paid political influence isn't a prime case for reform, I don't know what
is," Gephardt said. "I hope the president will stand with us to clean up
the political system and get big money out of politics."</TE>
<TE>   The president favors a more limited reform bill than the one leading
Democrats and a handful of renegade Republicans are pushing.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), who has been the favorite
target of White House and Republican attacks in recent weeks, responded
to Bush's speech by focusing on "common ground" between the
administration and Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "The president has put forward an aggressive agenda this evening, but
with a renewed commitment to compromise from both sides, I believe that
we can put our economy back on track, win the war against terror and meet
our nation's great unmet goals," Daschle said. He emphasized the need to
help the jobless and give the elderly affordable prescription drug
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Acclaim for Bush's war effort was nearly universal. "He's done a good
job," said Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.). "He speaks plainly, he tells the
world where we're coming from."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles)--a leading administration critic
on several domestic issues, most recently the Enron case--said he found
Bush's call for a comprehensive, sustained fight against terrorism "quite
inspiring."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) expressed hope that the speech would spawn a
new dealmaking spirit on Capitol Hill. "I hope I'm not being naive, but I
think we can get something done," Bayh said.</TE>
<TE>   But other Democrats predicted that on domestic issues, bipartisanship
would be in scarce supply this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult because of the most natural of causes," said Sen.
Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.). The two parties have "very different
priorities for the country." While Bush "may seem to be supportive" of
increasing Medicare services and education spending, he said, "he does
not seem willing to make a substantive commitment of resources."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), whom Bush praised for his work on
education reform, said he anticipates "a tough year" unless Bush relents
on his call to make permanent last year's tax cut law. "He said after
Sept. 11 that everything changed. Yeah, everything changed except the tax
cut. That's going to make it tough to have bipartisan support."</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats themselves are divided on how to respond to the 10-year,
$1.35-trillion tax cut now that federal deficits have reemerged. Some
rank-and-file Democrats fret that their leaders have not yet found a
theme to unite the party. "We look like a party divided, but the rule of
thumb for the minority party is, stay together," said Rep. Robert T.
Matsui (D-Sacramento).</TE>
<TE>   And while the ongoing nature of the counter-terrorism campaign put
Democrats in the position of defining their differences with Bush in a
deferential tone, congressional Republicans had the luxury of cheering on
a popular wartime president.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) summed up his party's
mood: "President Bush continued to show strong leadership for our
country, and I, like all Americans, am very proud of his leadership since
the Sept. 11 attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Centrist Republicans hoped that Bush's speech would set the table for
at least some bipartisan achievements this year to match the sweeping
school reform bill that the president signed into law earlier this month.
"Hope springs eternal," said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). "We have a
model in the education bill."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Michael N. Castle (R-Del.), another centrist, said Bush's
speech--at 48 minutes--had the virtue of relative brevity and achievable
goals. "At least he didn't give one of those speeches where he promised
40 things and you know darned well he wouldn't be able to deliver 10 of
them," Castle said.</TE>
<TE>   One group of lawmakers came away especially pleased: House Republican
leaders. "At least in the House, the president's policy agenda will match
our own," said Rep. Christopher Cox of Newport Beach, a GOP leader. "As
you could see by the speed with which [many Republicans] leaped to their
feet, one of my colleagues was complaining about repetitive stress
syndrome."</TE>

<HD>Bush Seeks to Capitalize on Wartime Spirit</HD>
<DH>Policy: He sets a tone of unity in fighting terror and hopes it
carries along his economic and other domestic initiatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES POLITICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush sought Tuesday to use the surge of national unity
surrounding the war against terrorism as both sword and shield in the
divisive battles with Congress over the rest of his agenda.</LD>
<LD>   In a forceful State of the Union address, Bush not only portrayed the
struggle with terrorism as his administration's defining mission but also
tried to broadly extend the mantle of the war over his other goals. Even
as he pointed toward potential new targets in the war--by heightening
criticism of Iraq, Iran and North Korea as threats to American
security--Bush also displayed a determination to apply his soaring
wartime popularity to maximum advantage at home.</LD>
<LD>   At times, Bush directly defined some of his other priorities--like
building a national missile defense system--as part of the war effort. At
another point, he moved to blunt mounting Democratic attacks on his tax
cut by blaming the return of federal budget deficits instead on the cost
of fighting the war. The war also inspired the boldest two new ideas in
the speech: a call for greater human rights in the Islamic world and a
summons to greater community involvement in the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   More fundamentally, Bush repeatedly called on Congress to apply the
"same spirit of cooperation" evident in the war to domestic issues, on
which the administration and Senate Democrats have fought to stalemate.</TE>
<TE>   The paradox is that Bush made the call for conciliation without
signaling any substantive concessions on the key issues that have divided
the two sides.</TE>
<TE>   Bush reached out to Democrats with new initiatives in education and an
expansion of the national service program launched under former President
Clinton. But on the budget, economic stimulus, energy, Medicare reform,
prescription drugs, missile defense and providing health care to the
uninsured, Bush on Tuesday night indicated no shift in long-held
positions that most Democrats reject.</TE>
<TE>   The White House may be betting that Bush's popularity will pressure
Senate Democrats to bend in his direction on the largest issues dividing
them. But most Democrats insist that, despite the public's enthusiastic
embrace of Bush's wartime leadership, they see little political danger in
resisting his domestic agenda, even if the post-Sept. 11 environment
demands that they pursue those conflicts less acrimoniously.</TE>
<TE>   Tellingly, in the Democratic response Tuesday night, House Minority
Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) offered a mirror of Bush's speech.
Gephardt pledged cooperation with the president at home and abroad, then
immediately listed domestic priorities that clashed sharply with Bush's.</TE>
<TE>   These contrasting impulses could produce a year in Washington of
sustained schizophrenia: cooperation on the war and conflict at home.
"Because the government is divided," predicts Bruce Reed, president of
the Democratic Leadership Council, "there is only going to be progress
where Bush and Democratic leaders can agree."</TE>
<TE>   The evening was a measure of how much American life has changed since
Sept. 11. The threat of terrorism dominated Bush's remarks and provoked
stringent security precautions.</TE>
<TE>   Bush himself was transformed as well: A year ago, he stood before
Congress as the disputed winner of a razor-thin election. Tuesday night
he returned with approval ratings topping 80% in most surveys and with
praise for his war leadership from even some of his sternest critics.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes blustery, sometimes grave, he exuded resolve as he declared
victory in Afghanistan and promised relentless pressure against
terrorists and the nations that support them. Still, the speech lacked
the drama and poetry of his address to the joint congressional session
nine days after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond insights into Bush's political strategy, the speech also
provided an unusually revealing look at his conception of the presidency.
Though Bush discussed his share of specific programs, the speech was
predominantly organized around three large goals: pursuing the war
against terrorists abroad, defending the homeland and invigorating the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   That focus was more than a rhetorical strategy; it also reflected the
way Bush is allocating his own time and energy. "He always wants to talk
in terms of a few fundamental priorities for the country that he is going
to focus on and make happen," said one senior White House official
familiar with the process of drafting the speech. "That's the way he
organizes, that's the way he speaks and that's the way he leads."</TE>
<TE>   The contrast with his predecessor, Bill Clinton, is instructive. It
was revealing that Bush's speech last night clocked in at a brisk 48
minutes, compared with the 89-minute marathon Clinton uncorked for his
finale in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Long before Sept. 11, Bush preferred to paint with fewer but broader
strokes than Clinton, always emphasizing a few central goals--such as
cutting taxes or reforming federal education laws. The challenge of
terrorism has demanded that Bush further sharpen the narrow focus he
prefers anyway; it has made a necessity of what he already considered a
virtue.</TE>
<TE>   In the speech, Bush left no doubt that he believes the war will remain
his priority for some time. He even opened a new front by loudly rattling
sabers at Iraq, Iran and North Korea as potential suppliers of weapons of
mass destruction to terrorists, though he stopped short of explicitly
threatening military action.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Bush also indicated his intention not to ignore other public
concerns and contain other potential political vulnerabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Though he never mentioned by name the collapsed Enron Corp., Bush
continued his administration's effort to focus the Enron debate on
policy, rather than ethics, questions. By proposing new protections for
employee 401(k) plans and new restrictions on the accounting industry at
a time when congressional proposals are proliferating in those arenas,
Bush increased the possibility that reform legislation may actually
become law.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also took no chance that voters might perceive him as
insufficiently focused on the economy at home while he prosecutes war
abroad. That perception helped doom the 1992 reelection bid of his
father, former President George Bush. Keenly aware of that precedent,
this Bush spoke with urgency about his desire to complete work on a plan
to stimulate the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Yet aides say he remains committed to the same stimulus
package--centered largely on additional tax cuts--that has failed to
reach the 60 votes needed for passage in the Senate. Despite a call for
the two sides to resolve their differences, Bush signaled Tuesday no
further give.</TE>
<TE>   On several fronts, Bush did offer new initiatives that may have
significant bipartisan appeal: more money for early childhood education
and teacher training; a big expansion of the Peace Corps and Clinton's
national service program. His ringing call for the U.S. to stand more
firmly for freedom in the Islamic world is likely to draw enthusiastic
applause from human rights advocates in both parties.</TE>
<TE>   But on existing issues where the two parties are locked in dispute,
Bush mostly reinforced the lines he has already drawn in the sand.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Democrats escalate their charges that Bush's tax cut has
vaporized the projected federal budget surplus, the president called for
making the tax reductions permanent--and argued that the greatest threat
to the federal balance sheet is excessive congressional spending.
Likewise, Bush called for helping those without health insurance by
providing a tax credit, an idea that sharply divides the parties.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all of the heat these disputes generate, it was clear Tuesday
night that Bush believes he will be judged most on his success in
combating what he called the "unprecedented dangers" confronting the
civilized world. About the struggle against terrorism, Bush spoke with a
singular sense of mission, in phrases that suggested he was addressing
future generations as much as today's voters.</TE>
<TE>   "History," Bush declared, "has called America and our allies to
action, and it is both our responsibility and our privilege to fight
freedom's fight."</TE>

<HD>Bush Vows to Expand Once-Threatened 'Domestic Peace Corps'</HD>
<DH>Volunteerism: Fivefold increase in AmeriCorps membership would
counter past GOP tries to kill the program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) once tried to kill it. President Bush
was once lukewarm toward it. Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) denounced it as a
program for "kids to stand around a campfire to hold hands and sing
'Kumbaya' at taxpayers' expense."</LD>
<LD>   But AmeriCorps, the national service program often called a "domestic
Peace Corps," won a big vote of support Tuesday night from President
Bush, who proposed its expansion.</LD>
<LD>   And some former skeptics cheered him on.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm very glad he's doing this," said McCain, who is proposing his own
measure to expand national service. "I was skeptical at first of whether
it would work or not, but it's worked extremely well."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a boost for AmeriCorps, which now has 50,000
volunteers, Bush proposed beefing up the existing Senior Corps of
retirees and asking them to help police, fire and neighborhood watch
associations. Together, the Senior Corps and AmeriCorps would aim to
recruit 200,000 new volunteers, Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The president also proposed doubling the number of Peace Corps
volunteers over five years and giving it new missions to Islamic nations.
Aides said that would return the agency to its 1966 peak of 15,000
volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   "My call tonight is for every American to commit at least two
years--4,000 hours over the rest of your lifetime--to the service of your
neighbors and your nation," Bush said. The volunteer efforts would fall
under a new USA Freedom Corps, an umbrella agency to be run by an
assistant to the president.</TE>
<TE>   In what officials said was a coincidence of timing, the California
state volunteerism office on Tuesday unveiled a new Web site that aims to
match Californians with volunteer opportunities in their own communities.
The site can be reached through the "Volunteer Here" icon at
http://http://www.goserv.ca.gov.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, AmeriCorps workers spend a year building affordable homes,
teaching children to read or serving communities in other ways, in return
for a living allowance and $4,725, which must be used for tuition or
education loans. The program now costs about $400 million annually.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have not always been fans.</TE>
<TE>   A pet project of President Clinton, AmeriCorps was created in 1993
over the objection of many Republican lawmakers, who later made several
attempts to kill it.</TE>
<TE>   Asked in 2000 whether he supported the program, Bush, then a
presidential candidate, said he wanted to evaluate its effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   But the Sept. 11 attacks led to an outpouring of civic-mindedness, and
politicians of both parties said the nation should take advantage of the
new interest in volunteerism.</TE>
<TE>   At AmeriCorps, inquiries from potential participants jumped by 30%
after Sept. 11, though they have since fallen. In California, inquiries
rose 48% after Sept. 11, said Chuck Supple, director of Gov. Gray Davis'
Office on Service and Volunteerism.</TE>
<TE>   Now both parties are trying to claim AmeriCorps, or at least its
spirit, as their own.</TE>
<TE>   "We always saw it as a defining 'New Democrat' issue, an antidote to
the left's attitude that you can get something for nothing from the
government and the right's politics . . . that basically said 'every man
for himself,' " said Will Marshall, an early champion of AmeriCorps and
president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic
think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "The Republicans hated it," Marshall added. "They derided it as paid
volunteerism and a feel-good jobs program."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Lenkowsky, chief executive of AmeriCorps' parent agency, the
Corporation for National and Community Service, said the roots of the
program run to the administration of the first President Bush, who
created a commission to explore ideas such as AmeriCorps. But because
Clinton made the program a significant part of his 1992 presidential
campaign, Republicans in Congress initially resisted the idea.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, 49 of the 50 governors--the one abstainer was a
Republican--signed a letter urging continued support for AmeriCorps,
Marshall said. They included Bush, then governor of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   McCain and other Republican lawmakers had reversed their initial
opposition to AmeriCorps well before the Sept. 11 attacks. "The idea of
national service and causes greater than yourself was a whole theme of my
presidential campaign," said McCain, who ran for the GOP nomination in
2000. "So I'm pleased the president is proposing this in his State of the
Union address."</TE>
<TE>   Legislation proposed by McCain and Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) would boost
the number of AmeriCorps workers fivefold, to 250,000, by 2010. Half of
the new workers would take positions related to homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the bill would require colleges to devote 25% of their
federal student aid dollars to community service jobs, up from 7% today.</TE>
<TE>   And it would create a shorter-term enlistment option for the armed
forces--18 months of active duty plus 18 months of reserve duty in return
for an $18,000 bonus above military pay. McCain said the minimum
enlistment today is three years, four for most jobs. The cost of the bill
would be $2.6 billion in the first year, a Bayh aide said.</TE>
<TE>   Santorum, who once derided AmeriCorps, has proposed a bill that, his
aides say, would allow AmeriCorps workers to serve in a wider variety of
communities.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Cook, a political analyst, said expanding national service
programs makes good political sense in addition to having the practical
effect of taking advantage of the current interest in volunteerism.</TE>
<TE>   He said the idea would remind voters that Bush ran as a "compassionate
conservative" and would allow him to reach beyond the "laundry list of
issues" in his State of the Union address to push Americans to a higher
calling.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Following is the transcript of President Bush's State of the Union
address Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Congress, distinguished guests, fellow citizens: As we gather tonight,
our nation is at war, our economy is in recession and the civilized world
faces unprecedented dangers. Yet the state of our union has never been
stronger.</LD>
<TE>   We last met in an hour of shock and suffering. In four short months,
our nation has comforted the victims; begun to rebuild New York and the
Pentagon; rallied a great coalition; captured, arrested and rid the world
of thousands of terrorists; destroyed Afghanistan's terrorist training
camps; saved a people from starvation; and freed a country from brutal
oppression.</TE>
<TE>   The American flag flies again over our embassy in Kabul. Terrorists
who once occupied Afghanistan now occupy cells at Guantanamo Bay. And
terrorist leaders who urged followers to sacrifice their lives are
running for their own.</TE>
<TE>   America and Afghanistan are now allies against terror. We will be
partners in rebuilding that country. And this evening we welcome the
distinguished interim leader of a liberated Afghanistan: Chairman Hamid
Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   The last time we met in this chamber, the mothers and daughters of
Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or
going to school.</TE>
<TE>   Today women are free and are part of Afghanistan's new government. And
we welcome the new minister of women's affairs, Dr. Sima Samar.</TE>
<TE>   Our progress is a tribute to the spirit of the Afghan people, to the
resolve of our coalition and to the might of the United States military.</TE>
<TE>   When I called our troops into action, I did so with complete
confidence in their courage and skill. And tonight, thanks to them, we
are winning the war on terror.</TE>
<TE>   The men and women of our armed forces have delivered a message now
clear to every enemy of the United States: Even 7,000 miles away, across
oceans and continents, on mountaintops and in caves, you will not escape
the justice of this nation.</TE>
<TE>   For many Americans, these four months have brought sorrow and pain
that will never completely go away. Every day a retired firefighter
returns to ground zero to feel closer to his two sons who died there.</TE>
<TE>   At a memorial in New York, a little boy left his football with a note
for his lost father: "Dear Daddy, please take this to heaven. I don't
want to play football until I can play with you again someday."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, at the grave of her husband, Michael, a CIA officer and
Marine who died in Mazar-i-Sharif, Shannon Spann said these words of
farewell: "Semper fi, my love." Shannon is with us tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon, I assure you and all who have lost a loved one that our cause
is just and our country will never forget the debt we owe Michael and all
who gave their lives for freedom.</TE>
<TE>'Our Cause Is Just, and It Continues'</TE>
<TE>   Our cause is just, and it continues. Our discoveries in Afghanistan
confirmed our worst fears and showed us the true scope of the task ahead.
We have seen the depth of our enemies' hatred in videos where they laugh
about the loss of innocent life.</TE>
<TE>   And the depth of their hatred is equaled by the madness of the
destruction they design. We have found diagrams of American nuclear power
plants and public water facilities, detailed instructions for making
chemical weapons, surveillance maps of American cities, and thorough
descriptions of landmarks in America and throughout the world.</TE>
<TE>   What we have found in Afghanistan confirms that, far from ending
there, our war against terror is only beginning. Most of the 19 men who
hijacked planes on September the 11th were trained in Afghanistan's
camps. And so were tens of thousands of others. Thousands of dangerous
killers, schooled in the methods of murder, often supported by outlaw
regimes, are now spread throughout the world like ticking time bombs, set
to go off without warning.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the work of our law enforcement officials and coalition
partners, hundreds of terrorists have been arrested, yet tens of
thousands of trained terrorists are still at large. These enemies view
the entire world as a battlefield, and we must pursue them wherever they
are.</TE>
<TE>   So long as training camps operate, so long as nations harbor
terrorists, freedom is at risk, and America and our allies must not, and
will not, allow it.</TE>
<TE>Call to Eliminate 'Terrorist Parasites'</TE>
<TE>   Our nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and persistent in
the pursuit of two great objectives. First, we will shut down terrorist
camps, disrupt terrorist plans and bring terrorists to justice.</TE>
<TE>   And second, we must prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons from threatening the United
States and the world.</TE>
<TE>   Our military has put the terror training camps of Afghanistan out of
business, yet camps still exist in at least a dozen countries. A
terrorist underworld . . . including groups like Hamas, Hezbollah,
Islamic Jihad and Jaish-i-Mohammed--operates in remote jungles and
deserts and hides in the centers of large cities.</TE>
<TE>   While the most visible military action is in Afghanistan, America is
acting elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   We now have troops in the Philippines helping to train that country's
armed forces to go after terrorist cells that have executed an American
and still hold hostages.</TE>
<TE>   Our soldiers, working with the Bosnian government, seized terrorists
who were plotting to bomb our embassy. Our Navy is patrolling the coast
of Africa to block the shipment of weapons and the establishment of
terrorist camps in Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   My hope is that all nations will heed our call and eliminate the
terrorist parasites who threaten their countries and our own.</TE>
<TE>   Many nations are acting forcefully. Pakistan is now cracking down on
terror, and I admire the strong leadership of President Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   But some governments will be timid in the face of terror. And make no
mistake about it: If they do not act, America will.</TE>
<TE>   Our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from
threatening America or our friends and allies with weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since Sept. 11, but we
know their true nature. North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and
weapons of mass destruction while starving its citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an
unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support
terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and
nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used
poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens, leaving the bodies of
mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to
international inspections then kicked out the inspectors. This is a
regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.</TE>
<TE>   States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of
evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of
mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They
could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match
their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the
United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be
catastrophic.</TE>
<TE>Homeland Security Is Budget Priority</TE>
<TE>   We will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their
state sponsors the materials, technology and expertise to make and
deliver weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   We will develop and deploy effective missile defenses to protect
America and our allies from sudden attack.</TE>
<TE>   And all nations should know: America will do what is necessary to
ensure our nation's security.</TE>
<TE>   We'll be deliberate, yet time is not on our side. I will not wait on
events while dangers gather. I will not stand by as peril draws closer
and closer. The United States of America will not permit the world's most
dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Our war on terror is well begun, but it is only begun. This campaign
may not be finished on our watch, yet it must be and it will be waged on
our watch.</TE>
<TE>   We can't stop short. If we stopped now, leaving terror camps intact
and terror states unchecked, our sense of security would be false and
temporary. History has called America and our allies to action, and it is
both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom's fight.</TE>
<TE>   Our first priority must always be the security of our nation, and that
will be reflected in the budget I send to Congress. My budget supports
three great goals for America: We will win this war, we will protect our
homeland, and we will revive our economy.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 brought out the best in America and the best in this
Congress, and I join the American people in applauding your unity and
resolve.</TE>
<TE>   Now Americans deserve to have this same spirit directed toward
addressing problems here at home.</TE>
<TE>   I am a proud member of my party. Yet as we act to win the war, protect
our people and create jobs in America, we must act first and foremost not
as Republicans, not as Democrats, but as Americans.</TE>
<TE>A Pay Raise for Members of Military</TE>
<TE>   It costs a lot to fight this war. We have spent more than a billion
dollars a month--over $30 million a day--and we must be prepared for
future operations. Afghanistan proved that expensive precision weapons
defeat the enemy and spare innocent lives, and we need more of them. We
need to replace aging aircraft and make our military more agile to put
our troops anywhere in the world quickly and safely.</TE>
<TE>   Our men and women in uniform deserve the best weapons, the best
equipment and the best training and they also deserve another pay raise.</TE>
<TE>   My budget includes the largest increase in defense spending in two
decades, because while the price of freedom and security is high, it is
never too high. Whatever it costs to defend our country, we will pay.</TE>
<TE>   The next priority of my budget is to do everything possible to protect
our citizens and strengthen our nation against the ongoing threat of
another attack.</TE>
<TE>   Time and distance from the events of Sept. 11 will not make us safer
unless we act on its lessons. America is no longer protected by vast
oceans. We are protected from attack only by vigorous action abroad and
increased vigilance at home.</TE>
<TE>   My budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland
security, focused on four key areas: bioterrorism, emergency response,
airport and border security, and improved intelligence.</TE>
<TE>Added Benefits of Improved Security</TE>
<TE>   We will develop vaccines to fight anthrax and other deadly diseases.
We'll increase funding to help states and communities train and equip our
heroic police and firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   We will improve intelligence collection and sharing, expand patrols at
our borders, strengthen the security of air travel, and use technology to
track the arrivals and departures of visitors to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Homeland security will make America not only stronger but in many ways
better. Knowledge gained from bioterrorism research will improve public
health. Stronger police and fire departments will mean safer
neighborhoods. Stricter border enforcement will help combat illegal
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   And as government works to better secure our homeland, America will
continue to depend on the eyes and ears of alert citizens. A few days
before Christmas, an airline flight attendant spotted a passenger
lighting a match. The crew and passengers quickly subdued the man, who
had been trained by Al Qaeda and was armed with explosives. The people on
that airplane were alert, and as a result likely saved nearly 200 lives.
And tonight we welcome and thank flight attendants Hermis Moutardier and
Christina Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Once we have funded our national security and our homeland security,
the final great priority of my budget is economic security for the
American people.</TE>
<TE>Budget Will Run at a 'Short-Term' Deficit</TE>
<TE>   To achieve these great national objectives--to win the war, protect
the homeland and revitalize our economy--our budget will run a deficit
that will be small and short term so long as Congress restrains spending
and acts in a fiscally responsible way.</TE>
<TE>   We have clear priorities and we must act at home with the same purpose
and resolve we have shown overseas. We will prevail in the war, and we
will defeat this recession.</TE>
<TE>   Americans who have lost their jobs need our help, and I support
extending unemployment benefits and direct assistance for health care
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Yet American workers want more than unemployment checks. They want a
steady paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   When America works, America prospers, so my economic security plan can
be summed up in one word: jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Good jobs begin with good schools, and here we've made a fine start.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic
education reform so that no child is left behind.</TE>
<TE>   I was proud to work with members of both parties, Chairman John
Boehner and Congressman George Miller, Sen. Judd Gregg. And I was so
proud of our work I even had nice things to say about my friend Ted
Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   I know the folks at the Crawford coffee shop couldn't believe I'd say
such a thing. But our work on this bill shows what is possible if we set
aside posturing and focus on results.</TE>
<TE>   There's more to do. We need to prepare our children to read and
succeed in school with improved Head Start and early childhood
development programs.</TE>
<TE>   We must upgrade our teacher colleges and teacher training, and launch
a major recruiting drive with a great goal for America: a quality teacher
in every classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy. This Congress
must act to encourage conservation, promote technology, build
infrastructure, and it must act to increase energy production at home so
America is less dependent on foreign oil.</TE>
<TE>   Good jobs depend on expanded trade. Selling into new markets creates
new jobs, so I ask Congress to finally approve trade promotion authority</TE>
<TE>   On these two key issues, trade and energy, the House of
Representatives has acted to create jobs, and I urge the Senate to pass
this legislation.</TE>
<TE>'Let's Make These Tax Cuts Permanent'</TE>
<TE>   Good jobs depend on sound tax policy. Last year, some in this hall
thought my tax relief plan was too small; some thought it was too big.</TE>
<TE>   But when those checks arrived in the mail, most Americans thought tax
relief was just about right.</TE>
<TE>   Congress listened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates,
doubling the child credit and ending the death tax. For the sake of
long-term growth and to help Americans plan for the future, let's make
these tax cuts permanent.</TE>
<TE>   The way out of this recession, the way to create jobs, is to grow the
economy by encouraging investment in factories and equipment, and by
speeding up tax relief so people have more money to spend.</TE>
<TE>   For the sake of American workers, let's pass a stimulus package.</TE>
<TE>   Good jobs must be the aim of welfare reform. As we reauthorize these
important reforms, we must always remember: The goal is to reduce
dependency on government and offer every American the dignity of a job.</TE>
<TE>   Americans know economic security can vanish in an instant without
health security. I ask Congress to join me this year to enact a patients'
bill of rights, to give uninsured workers credits to help buy health
coverage, to approve an historic increase in spending for veterans'
health, and to give seniors a sound and modern Medicare system that
includes coverage for prescription drugs.</TE>
<TE>   A good jobs--a good job should lead to security in retirement. I ask
Congress to enact new safeguards for 401(k) and pension plans.</TE>
<TE>   Employees who have worked hard and saved all their lives should not
have to risk losing everything if their company fails.</TE>
<TE>Making Corporations More Accountable</TE>
<TE>   Through stricter accounting standards and tougher disclosure
requirements, corporate America must be made more accountable to
employees and shareholders and held to the highest standards of conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Retirement security also depends upon keeping the commitments of
Social Security, and we will. We must make Social Security financially
stable and allow personal retirement accounts for younger workers who
choose them.</TE>
<TE>   Members, you and I will work together in the months ahead on other
issues: productive farm policy, a cleaner environment, broader home
ownership, especially among minorities, and ways to encourage the good
work of charities and faith-based groups.</TE>
<TE>   I ask you to join me on these important domestic issues in the same
spirit of cooperation we have applied to our war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   During these last few months, I've been humbled and privileged to see
the true character of this country in a time of testing. Our enemies
believed America was weak and materialistic, that we would splinter in
fear and selfishness.</TE>
<TE>   They were as wrong as they are evil.</TE>
<TE>   The American people have responded magnificently, with courage and
compassion, strength and resolve. As I have met the heroes, hugged the
families and looked into the tired faces of rescuers, I have stood in awe
of the American people.</TE>
<TE>Call for Volunteers for 'USA Freedom Corps'</TE>
<TE>   And I hope you will join me in expressing thanks to one American for
the strength and calm and comfort she brings to our nation in crisis: our
first lady, Laura Bush.</TE>
<TE>   None of us would ever wish the evil that was done on Sept. 11, yet,
after America was attacked, it was as if our entire country looked into a
mirror and saw our better selves. We were reminded that we are citizens
with obligations to each other, to our country and to history. We began
to think less of the goods we can accumulate and more about the good we
can do.</TE>
<TE>   For too long our culture has said, "If it feels good, do it." Now
America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed: "Let's roll."</TE>
<TE>   In the sacrifice of soldiers, the fierce brotherhood of firefighters,
and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizens, we have glimpsed
what a new culture of responsibility could look like. We want to be a
nation that serves goals larger than self. We have been offered a unique
opportunity, and we must not let this moment pass.</TE>
<TE>   My call tonight is for every American to commit at least two
years--4,000 hours over the rest of your lifetime--to the service of your
neighbors and your nation.</TE>
<TE>   Many are already serving, and I thank you. If you aren't sure how to
help, I've got a good place to start. To sustain and extend the best that
has emerged in America, I invite you to join the new USA Freedom Corps.
The Freedom Corps will focus on three areas of need: responding in case
of crisis at home, rebuilding our communities and extending American
compassion throughout the world.</TE>
<TE>   One purpose of the USA Freedom Corps will be homeland security.
America needs retired doctors and nurses who can be mobilized in major
emergencies, volunteers to help police and fire departments,
transportation and utility workers well trained in spotting danger.</TE>
<TE>   Our country also needs citizens working to rebuild our communities. We
need mentors to love children, especially children whose parents are in
prison. And we need more talented teachers in troubled schools.</TE>
<TE>'We Can Overcome Evil With Greater Good'</TE>
<TE>   USA Freedom Corps will expand and improve the good efforts of
AmeriCorps and Senior Corps to recruit more than 200,000 new volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   And America needs citizens to extend the compassion of our country to
every part of the world, so we will renew the promise of the Peace Corps,
double its volunteers over the next five years and ask it to join a new
effort to encourage development and education and opportunity in the
Islamic world.</TE>
<TE>   This time of adversity offers a unique moment of opportunity, a moment
we must seize to change our culture. Through the gathering momentum of
millions of acts of service and decency and kindness, I know we can
overcome evil with greater good.</TE>
<TE>   And we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the
world toward the values that will bring lasting peace. All fathers and
mothers, in all societies, want their children to be educated and live
free from poverty and violence.</TE>
<TE>   No people on Earth yearn to be oppressed or aspire to servitude or
eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police.</TE>
<TE>   If anyone doubts this, let them look to Afghanistan, where the Islamic
street greeted the fall of tyranny with song and celebration. Let the
skeptics look to Islam's own rich history, with its centuries of learning
and tolerance and progress.</TE>
<TE>   America will lead by defending liberty and justice because they are
right and true and unchanging for all people everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   No nation owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them.
We have no intention of imposing our culture, but America will always
stand firm for the non-negotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of
law, limits on the power of the state, respect for women, private
property, free speech, equal justice and religious tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   America will take the side of brave men and women who advocate these
values around the world, including the Islamic world, because we have a
greater objective than eliminating threats and containing resentment.</TE>
<TE>   We seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror.</TE>
<TE>   In this moment of opportunity, a common danger is erasing old
rivalries. America is working with Russia, and China and India in ways we
never have before to achieve peace and prosperity. In every region, free
markets and free trade and free societies are proving their power to lift
lives. Together with friends and allies from Europe to Asia, and Africa
to Latin America, we will demonstrate that the forces of terror cannot
stop the momentum of freedom.</TE>
<TE>'This Will Be a Decisive Decade'</TE>
<TE>   The last time I spoke here, I expressed the hope that life would
return to normal. In some ways it has. In others it never will. Those of
us who have lived through these challenging times have been changed by
them. We've come to know truths that we will never question: Evil is
real, and it must be opposed. Beyond all differences of race or creed, we
are one country, mourning together and facing danger together.</TE>
<TE>   Deep in the American character there is honor, and it is stronger than
cynicism. And many have discovered again that even in tragedy--especially
in tragedy--God is near.</TE>
<TE>   In a single instant, we realized that this will be a decisive decade
in the history of liberty; that we have been called to a unique role in
human events. Rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or
consequential.</TE>
<TE>   Our enemies send other people's children on missions of suicide and
murder. They embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed. We stand
for a different choice, made long ago, on the day of our founding. We
affirm it again today. We choose freedom and the dignity of every life.</TE>
<TE>   Steadfast in our purpose, we now press on. We have known freedom's
price. We have shown freedom's power. And in this great conflict, my
fellow Americans, we will see freedom's victory.</TE>
<TE>   Thank you all, and may God bless.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the first outline of a new political strategy to complement the
war on terrorism, President Bush promised Tuesday that the United States
will take advantage of a "great opportunity" to promote freedom, justice
and equality among Islamic nations to counter the forces of terror.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration will actively support individuals and groups
that advocate freedom in the Islamic world because the United States has
a "greater objective than eliminating threats and containing resentment,"
Bush said in his first State of the Union address.</LD>
<LD>   His remarks reflect how much the administration's thinking has changed
since Sept. 11 on the issue of nation-building, a practice Bush
criticized during his presidential campaign. It also indicates a
conviction that the United States is badly misunderstood in the Islamic
world.</LD>
<TE>   The only specific initiative mentioned in the speech was a doubling of
the size of the Peace Corps to promote "development, education and
opportunity in the Islamic world." More broadly, the president said
Americans should seize the opportunity to aid Muslim societies. Through
acts of "service and decency and kindness," Bush said the United States
can "overcome evil."</TE>
<TE>   The president's remarks underscored a growing focus within the
administration on the need to address major grievances among people in
Islamic nations, the last bloc of countries to hold out against the
democratic tide that has swept much of the rest of the world over the
last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and senior National Security
Council officials have begun talking in recent weeks about more actively
prodding governments in the Islamic world, stretching from Algeria on the
Mediterranean Sea to Indonesia on the Pacific Ocean, to accept political
and economic openings.</TE>
<TE>   The president's words mark a "stunning turnabout" after long rejecting
the idea of U.S. political intervention in the Islamic world, said
Augustus Richard Norton, a former U.N. officer in Lebanon and now a
Boston University political scientist.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a president who chastised and ridiculed those who talked
about nation-building, by which he meant the attempt by liberals to
spread values like human rights and democracy around the world. But he
has now basically embraced a liberal agenda in the Muslim world in
talking about education, development and women's rights," Norton said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the United States will not try to impose its own culture on
Muslim nations, it will back five "nonnegotiable" demands of human
dignity, the president said: the rule of law; restricting the powers of
the state; respecting the rights of women and free speech, equal justice;
and religious tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   "America will lead by defending liberty and justice because they are
right and true and unchanging for all people everywhere," he said as
Afghan interim leader Hamid Karzai looked on from the gallery of the
House of Representatives.</TE>
<TE>   "No people on earth yearn to be oppressed, or aspire to servitude, or
eagerly await the midnight knock of secret police," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The transformation of Afghanistan, where Muslims celebrated the fall
of the Taliban's rule, offered proof that public sentiment in the Islamic
bloc is no different from the rest of the world, Bush said. Islam's "rich
history, with its centuries of learning and tolerance and progress," also
indicates that these basic values are compatible with the political
culture in Muslim countries, he added.</TE>

<HD>Effort to Cut Off Terrorist Money Shows Progress</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Intelligence indicates Al Qaeda is suffering greatly from
the global crackdown, a Treasury official says in a status report.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Four months into the United States' financial war on terrorism,
federal authorities have helped freeze $80 million in terrorist money
worldwide, arrested at least 11 people, secured three indictments and
seized more than $12.5 million, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Their efforts have also resulted in more than 200 ongoing criminal
investigations into groups and individuals suspected of financing
terrorist activities since the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon. Some of those probes focus on Al Qaeda, Osama bin
Laden's terrorist network, while others target apparently unrelated
terrorist organizations operating in the United States and abroad.</LD>
<LD>   Of the $80 million, about $34 million has been frozen in the United
States and the remaining $46 million has been frozen by allies overseas.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said it was hard to quantify how much of an effect they
have had on the terrorists' financial lifelines. But they said there are
indications that Al Qaeda is suffering greatly as a result of the
crackdown.</TE>
<TE>   "We have intelligence information that Al Qaeda is starving for money
and feeling the squeeze," said Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary Rob
Nichols. "And while that is encouraging, we don't know if the $80 million
is 90% of the money that's out there or 10%. We are in a race where the
finish line is uncertain."</TE>
<TE>   That status report on the multi-agency effort to staunch the flow of
terrorist financing was provided at a lengthy Senate hearing by top
officials of the U.S. Treasury and Justice departments and in interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have analyzed about 61,000 transactions involving more
than 90 foreign banks, and the vast amount of information culled in the
last four months has been very valuable in understanding how the Sept. 11
operation worked, said Michael Chertoff, a top Justice Department
official.</TE>
<TE>   "Through financial information, we have established how the hijackers
received their money, how and where they were trained to fly, where they
lived and, perhaps most significantly, the names and whereabouts of
persons with whom they worked and came into conflict," he said.</TE>
<TE>Broadest Financial Probe in U.S. History</TE>
<TE>   The officials testified that federal agents are cooperating with
authorities in dozens of nations to freeze the assets of people and
organizations accused of terrorism, and to choke off the financial
pipeline that terrorist networks use to pay for weapons, explosives,
plane tickets and the day-to-day sustenance of shadowy operatives.</TE>
<TE>   "The work of these financial experts is just starting, but they have
already opened well over 200 terrorist financing investigations and are
following new leads on a daily basis," Deputy Treasury Secretary Kenneth
W. Dam said at a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Dam and other officials told the Senate panel that much of the
burgeoning crackdown cannot be discussed in public because it involves
the secret tracking of terrorists' financial assets and other classified
means of intelligence gathering. Treasury officials are working closely
with the FBI, the CIA, the departments of Justice, State and Defense, and
other government agencies in what Dam called the most extensive financial
investigation in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   "We remain focused on finishing off Al Qaeda," Dam said. "We are
targeting not only Al Qaeda operatives but their financial intermediaries
and others that support them. Increasingly, we are also focusing on other
terrorist groups of global reach."</TE>
<TE>   But, Dam added, "although we have made much progress, we still have
much work to do."</TE>
<TE>   Dam and Chertoff told the Senate panel that they need significantly
more law enforcement tools and personnel to continue the financial
assault on terrorism and to plug holes created by the passage of the
Patriot Act, the sweeping anti-terrorism legislation created in the wake
of the skyjackings.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the committee said they too had concerns about how
terrorists may be abusing banking loopholes to finance their global
jihad, or holy war.</TE>
<TE>   Chertoff, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's
criminal division, told the Senate panel that the Patriot Act granted law
enforcement officials an array of powerful new tools to block the money
flowing to terrorists. But he called on Congress to plug a loophole that
makes it illegal to conceal large amounts of criminally "tainted" cash
funneled across international borders but not within U.S. borders.</TE>
<TE>   Chertoff said Congress needs to ban the concealed transport of more
than $10,000 in cash within the United States as well, if it can be shown
that the offender knew the money was linked to criminal activities.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration proposed such a measure during last fall's
debate on the Patriot Act. But it was thrown out of the final version
because some lawmakers felt its wording was "too Draconian" in assuming
that anyone carrying so much cash must be tied to crime, according to a
Democratic Senate aide who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   If that concern can be addressed in this latest version, the measure
may well pass, the aide said.</TE>
<TE>Details of Inquiry Being Kept Classified</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Chertoff said, with evidence mounting that terrorist
groups have used informal money-changers known as "hawalas" to finance
their attacks, "we need to change the way we think about money
laundering."</TE>
<TE>   Dam and Chertoff said investigators are continuing to probe the
financial underpinnings of the Sept. 11 attacks, but they were unwilling
to answer publicly some of the key questions surrounding the funding of
the operation.</TE>
<TE>   These questions include just how much money was made available to the
hijackers in the United States--estimates have varied widely from several
hundred thousand dollars to more than $1 million--and whether Bin Laden
and Al Qaeda leaders were able to manipulate stock transactions to profit
from the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Chertoff said bank accounts "used by, or related to, the Sept. 11
terrorists" have been seized by federal authorities in New Jersey and New
York. And federal authorities have made arrests, executed warrants and
frozen funds in Massachusetts, Virginia, Ohio, Georgia, Minnesota, New
Jersey, Florida, Washington state and elsewhere against financial outfits
and charities with suspected terrorist ties, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "These actions demonstrate that our fight against terrorist financing
is a broad-based effort extending well beyond the Al Qaeda network,"
Chertoff said.</TE>
<TE>   One expanded tool that authorities are employing is the sharing of tax
information with foreign nations. Dam told lawmakers that the United
States has recently signed several such information-sharing agreements in
the Cayman Islands--renowned as a haven for offshore accounts--and he
said "there are more in the pipeline."</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), chairman of the hearing, said he
was concerned that some nations were being given a grace period of
several years to execute the agreements. "A lot of mischief can happen
during that period of time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) suggested that law enforcement officials must
also do more to get U.S. financial institutions to report suspicious
activity and root out possible money laundering.</TE>
<TE>   "I would suspect our strongest leverage is on American financial
institutions," he said. "And one of their responsibilities is to know
their customers much better."</TE>
<TE>   Dam hailed foreign governments for cooperating in the crackdown on
terrorist assets, saying they have blocked more than $46 million of the
overall $80 million in assets frozen. He did not provide details of which
accounts were blocked or who has been arrested and indicted.</TE>
<TE>   The White House also disclosed Tuesday that Dam will travel this
weekend to India and Pakistan to discuss the financial war on terrorism,
economic issues and Indo-Pakistan tensions.</TE>

<HD>Enron Role in Pricing Scrutinized</HD>
<DH>Probe: Analyst's findings lead to speculation the energy-trading
firm may have inflated long-term electricity rates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Federal energy regulators said Tuesday that they would investigate
whether Enron Corp. used its market clout last year to artificially
inflate long-term electricity prices on the West Coast by as much as 30%.</LD>
<LD>   An analysis by Portland, Ore., energy analyst Robert McCullough found
a 30% drop in the so-called forward price of electricity Dec. 3, the day
after Enron filed for bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   Enron was a heavy trader in electricity forward price contracts, which
are contracts for the purchase of a certain amount of power to be
delivered in a few months or a few years, depending on the contract.
Utilities, traders and large energy users buy such contracts to hedge
against future changes in the price of electricity.</LD>
<TE>   The unusual drop suggested that Enron had been using its dominance in
the thinly traded, unregulated market to prop up prices, McCullough told
the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, one of several
congressional committees investigating Enron's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Other energy experts agreed that Enron appears to have wielded
considerable clout in the forward market, where the company is believed
to have handled a large percentage of the trades. But they said too
little is known about the market to conclude that Enron acted improperly
and noted that prices already were falling by the time Enron filed for
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, McCullough's assertions immediately caught the attention of
three West Coast senators, including Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who
long has accused Enron of unjustly profiting from California's energy
crunch. They ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to
investigate the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "That certainly raises questions about whether Enron was manipulating
the West Coast market," said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).</TE>
<TE>   An Enron spokesman denied the allegations Tuesday, saying numerous
investigations by the FERC and the California Independent System
Operator--spurred by last year's energy crisis--already have concluded
that Enron did not use its market power to engage in price manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   "A number of factors influence the price of electricity," said Karen
Denne. "To place price fluctuation on Enron is misdirected."</TE>
<TE>   FERC Chairman Patrick H. Wood III vowed to look into the matter to
determine whether the price swing was caused by Enron or a shortage of
supply.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's a result of scarcity, then you probably would be more
uninclined to reform those contracts," Wood said.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough is managing partner of McCullough Research, whose clients
include a number of utilities in the Northwest, corporations with high
electricity usage and the California attorney general's office.</TE>
<TE>   If the assertions of price inflation are true, California and other
West Coast purchasers of long-term electricity contracts may have
overpaid substantially last year, McCullough said. He noted that at the
height of California's crisis last summer, Gov. Gray Davis spent about
$40 billion on such contracts, whose value was based largely on forward
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein and Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) suggested that the FERC or
Congress might move to renegotiate or negate those contracts if
wrongdoing is proven.</TE>
<TE>   "If, in fact, Enron transactions have distorted that market, and Gov.
Davis signed those contracts, there's a good argument that those
generators should be forced to renegotiate those contracts," Feinstein
said.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough said a 30% drop in one-day prices for forward contracts was
highly unusual. Other than the Enron Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, there
were no factors that would explain the swing, such as changes in energy
operations, hydroelectric supply or fossil-fuel prices, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The clear implication is that Enron may have been using its market
dominance to set forward prices," said McCullough, whose consulting firm
specializes in business and public policy issues.</TE>
<TE>   Because the market for forward contracts is unregulated and firms such
as Enron are not required to disclose the terms of their trades, only a
government investigation will be able to learn whether Enron manipulated
the market, McCullough said. He said he based his price information on
anecdotal evidence and surveys of energy traders.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Energy Committee is debating whether to push for tougher
disclosure and oversight rules for energy-trading markets, particularly
online activity and over-the-counter derivatives.</TE>
<TE>   "Market transparency is essential to efficient and competitive energy
markets," said Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) who chairs the committee.</TE>
<TE>   The drop in long-term prices for forward contracts contrasts sharply
with other energy-trading activities, which were largely unaffected by
Enron's bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   For example, there were no spikes in the spot market for wholesale
electricity prices.</TE>
<TE>   "An examination of daily spot market prices over the past year shows
no discernible impacts on electric energy prices on critical dates
surrounding the Enron collapse, including around Dec. 2," when Enron
filed for bankruptcy protection, said Lawrence J. Makovich, senior
director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates.</TE>
<TE>   But others said energy markets have been aided by mild weather and the
recession, which have helped keep prices low. Had Enron collapsed in an
environment of rising prices, consumers in New England might have seen
costs rise by $1 billion, said William M. Nugent, a Maine utility
regulator and president of the National Assn. of Regulatory and Utility
Commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   "We were simply and profoundly lucky," Nugent said.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional investigators, meanwhile, sought additional information
that might shed more light on the shredding of Enron documents and on the
shadowy partnerships used by the energy company to keep debt off its
books. Those partnerships and the questionable accounting practices
surrounding them were at the center of Enron's earnings restatement Nov.
8, when the company revealed $586 million in previously unreported losses
over nearly five years. The bankruptcy filing came less than a month
later.</TE>
<TE>   Reps. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, and James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the
subcommittee on oversight and investigations, asked Enron to turn over a
review reportedly conducted by an outside law firm last year on the
legality of the partnerships set up by Enron Chief Financial Officer
Andrew S. Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   The review, by New York law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp;
Jacobson, reportedly recommended that Enron "halt this practice,"
according to the congressmen's letter to Enron general counsel James
Derrick Jr. According to the letter, an Enron attorney, Jordan Mintz,
then wrote a memo to company executives "to the same effect."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are seeking the report by the law firm, which formerly
employed Securities and Exchange Commissioner Harvey L. Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Rauch, co-managing partner at Fried Frank, declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   In another development, ABC News reported that Enron has continued
shredding documents despite the federal investigations. The firm said the
documents were routine papers such as payroll material not covered by
subpoenas, but Greenwood said the continued shredding was unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, GOP congressional leaders backed Vice President Dick
Cheney's refusal to make public details of private meetings he and his
energy task force held with outside interests, including Enron
representatives, while drafting the administration's energy policy last
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the GAO is being pressured here on a partisan political
basis," said House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas).</TE>

<HD>Enron Lobbying Costs in Question</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From A Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron underreported its lobbying expenditures by more than 50% for
the first half of 2001, according to a report released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The company reported spending $825,000 on lobbying in the first six
months of 2001. But 13 outside lobbying firms reported nearly $1.8
million in income from Enron, and that amount should have been included
in the company's report, according to the Center for Responsive Politics,
a campaign finance research organization in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   An Enron official said that one of its lobbyists misstated its fees in
its filing and that the company was reviewing the statements filed by the
other lobbyists.</LD>
<TE>   Larry Noble, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics,
said it was critical for the public to have "the full picture of Enron's
lobbying activities."</TE>
<TE>   Noble said the lower lobbying figure appears only on the report filed
by Enron Corp., not on reports filed by Enron's subsidiaries.</TE>
<TE>   When those units are included, Enron's lobbying totals--as reported by
outside lobbying firms--exceeded $2 million for the first half of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In comparison, Enron and its subsidiaries spent $2.1 million on
lobbying in all of 2000 and $1.9 million in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter sent Tuesday to Secretary of the Senate Jeri Thomson and
Clerk of the House Jeff Trandahl, the center complained of Enron's
apparent violation of lobbyist reporting requirements under the Lobbying
Disclosure Act. The act requires firms to file semiannual lobbying
reports with the secretary of the Senate and the clerk of the House that
reveal the amount of income they receive from their clients.</TE>
<TE>   Companies must identify their overall lobbying expenditures, including
payments to outside lobbying firms. It is unclear whether the $825,000
reported by Enron Corp. reflects in-house lobbying efforts, payments to
outside lobbying firms, or both, the center said.</TE>
