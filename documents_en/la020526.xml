<HD>Heirs of German Retailer Fighting for Restitution</HD>
<DH>History: The Wertheim family lost its chain-store shares to
the Nazis. Now an ancestor wants the conglomerate that controls the
assets to compensate her.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CURRAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEWFIELD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Barbara Principe has this memory: She is 5 or 6 years old, playing
catch across a fence with Nazi soldiers who had seized her
grandparents' home, near Berlin.</LD>
<LD>   Dim and distant, it keeps coming back to her now as she discusses
her battle with a German retailing conglomerate that controls most of
the assets of the former Wertheim Corp. department store chain
founded by her ancestors.</LD>
<LD>   When the Nazis came to power in the 1930s, Principe's father and
other Wertheim family members were forced to surrender their shares
in the prosperous retail empire for little or no compensation.</LD>
<TE>   Her father, Gunther Wertheim, fled Germany and settled in America,
where he was forced to eke out a new life as a chicken farmer in
rural southern New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me angry. There's no other way to put it," said
Principe, a 69-year-old great-grandmother. "My family built this up
and it was torn down and taken away. One minute my father was on top
of the world, a millionaire. The next he was on a chicken farm,
trying to figure out what to do with a chicken besides cook it."</TE>
<TE>   What happened in between forms the basis for what is believed to
be the largest outstanding war-related restitution claim in German
history.</TE>
<TE>   The case pits Principe and her nephew Martin Wortham Jr. of
Chicago--his family name was Americanized--against the Wertheim
company's corporate successor, KarstadtQuelle, and the estate of
Arthur Lindgens, a former Wertheim executive.</TE>
<TE>   The Wertheim family once held a chain of six department
stores--including one near Berlin's recently restored Potsdamer
Platz--and owned other valuable downtown Berlin real estate.</TE>
<TE>   It lost the business under anti-Semitic "Aryanization" regulations
introduced by Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, which banned Jews from
owning or operating businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Georg Wertheim, then chairman of the company, and others
transferred their ownership stakes to his Gentile wife, Ursula.</TE>
<TE>   But two years after Georg's death in 1939, Ursula married
Lindgens, who had been the Wertheim company's chief lawyer. He
operated Wertheim through World War II and into the late 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Principe's father, Gunther Wertheim, and his brother
Fritz--who had fled Germany and ended up in America--began seeking
the shares they had lost through Aryanization.</TE>
<TE>   They filed petitions in a West German court in 1950 seeking
reparation.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Lindgens asserted that the shares were worthless because of
damage incurred during the war and the Communist takeover of East
Germany, where some of the Wertheim properties were.</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore: One of the disputed Berlin parcels formerly owned by
Wertheim was sold two years ago by KarstadtQuelle for $150 million. A
Ritz Hotel is being built on the site.</TE>
<TE>   Lindgens traveled to New York in 1951 and paid the brothers $9,200
each to drop their claims. They accepted the money, believing their
shares were worthless. That, apparently, was the end of it.</TE>
<TE>   For more than 40 years, the Wertheim heirs believed their fortune
to have been a victim of history. Principe grew up knowing nothing
about the deals. Her father never talked about the past, she said.</TE>
<TE>   One of two children of Gunther Wertheim, she remembers growing up
in a household centered on farming, with little time for levity.</TE>
<TE>   Bitter over what he had lost, Wertheim battled colitis until his
death in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of work but not a lot of laughter. Mostly we
worked--my father, my mother, my brother and me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Principe eventually married, reared seven children and now lives
with two dogs in a modest one-story home cluttered with family photos
and country knickknacks.</TE>
<TE>   Her restitution case was borne out of the fall of the Berlin Wall
in 1989 and the reunification of Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Former Wertheim retailing rival Hertie Warenhaus und Kaufhaus
petitioned the Berlin Restitution Authority for permission to take
control of former Wertheim property--including some in East
Germany--that it said it owned.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based Jewish Claims Conference intervened on behalf
of Wertheim heirs, even though it had made no contact with them.
Eventually, the Restitution Authority rejected Hertie's claim.</TE>
<TE>   The Wertheim heirs' case, meanwhile, picked up more steam last
year when lawyer Gary Osen found what he calls "the smoking gun" in
the files of the Restitution Authority.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 12, 1951, in New York, Hertie's chief operating officer,
Georg Karg, entered into a "secret sales agreement" with Arthur
Lindgens and Ursula Lindgens to buy outstanding Wertheim Corp. shares
controlled by the Lindgens.</TE>
<TE>   The handwritten document of the sale outlines the details of the
proposed merger of Hertie and Wertheim but omits key information
about Wertheim's ownership. It says Arthur Lindgens' group, with
50.1% of the stock, would head the new company and that Hertie would
acquire the other 49.9%.</TE>
<TE>   It does not mention the names of the shareholders who were selling
or the price they were to receive, and it contained none of their
signatures, according to Osen.</TE>
<TE>   Equally telling, the document spells out the compensation that
shareholders who weren't selling to Hertie would receive, which was
more than four times what Gunther and Fritz received for their
shares.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a semi-clandestine agreement to transfer hot
merchandise--shares they knew to be subject to legal impediment,"
Osen said.</TE>
<TE>   "So my clients' father and grandfather went to his grave believing
the company was in ruins and that he had received a proper
settlement, not knowing any of these other details, which were
impossible to know at the time."</TE>
<TE>   Principe and her 43-year-old nephew filed a civil suit in federal
court in New York last year asserting that the 1951 deal was a fraud
from which Hertie, and later KarstadtQuelle, which acquired it in
1993, continued to benefit.</TE>
<TE>   KarstadtQuelle officials have called the suit groundless.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer defending the company said the Wertheim heirs should
pursue their claims through the Foundation for Remembrance,
Responsibility and Future, which was set up by Germany to repay
people forced into slave labor by the Third Reich.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as Karstadt's position in court, we'd rather say it in
court and have you report it then," said attorney Roger Witten.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to their financial worth, some of Wertheim's former
holdings have historical significance.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is the site of the Reich Chancellery, the Nazi
equivalent of the White House, with its underground bunkers and Nazi
party headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Osen, Principe and her daughter Terri traveled to Berlin last year
to see the remaining Wertheim stores and visit the sites now at
issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw department stores the size of Macy's, with our name on
them!" Principe said. "I was flabbergasted. I had no knowledge of
these things."</TE>
<TE>   Wortham says the case is simple.</TE>
<TE>   "It boils down to right versus wrong," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about accountability and the recognition of responsibility
of the past. My grandfather's stores were part of history.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that the wrongs be righted, that the individuals
and corporations that still profit from the deception that was
perpetrated be corrected.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been going on for a long time and it's going on today.
That's not right."</TE>

<HD>Pair Blazed a Trail to Roof of World</HD>
<DH>Nepal: Sir Edmund Hillary, who with Tenzing Norgay became
the first to reach the top of Mt. Everest, bemoans the
commercialization of the climb today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAY LILLEY</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AUCKLAND, New Zealand</DL>
<LD>When climbers scramble to the summit of the world's highest peak,
their last obstacle is a 40-foot rock face covered in ice--the
Hillary Step.</LD>
<LD>   Before May 29, 1953, it had no name. Nobody had ever seen it up
close, let alone scaled it.</LD>
<LD>   But on that day, a 33-year-old New Zealand beekeeper and his
Nepalese Sherpa guide cut a line of footholds into the icy wall and
dragged their exhausted, oxygen-starved bodies the final feet to
glory.</LD>
<TE>   Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay had become the first
climbers to reach the 29,035-foot summit of Mt. Everest.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, more than 1,000 people have climbed to the peak and
the path blazed by Hillary and Tenzing is well worn.</TE>
<TE>   On May 16, 54 people made it there--a record number for a single
day. Among them was Tenzing Norgay's grandson, Tashi Wangchuk
Tenzing--who first climbed it in 1997. Hillary's son, Peter, who
scaled Everest in 1990, also is climbing the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-nine years after his triumph, Hillary, now 82 and
semiretired, recalls that the endeavor was shrouded in doubt almost
to the very end.</TE>
<TE>   "It had really all been supposition. I didn't know whether we were
going to be successful or not," Hillary said in an interview. "I knew
we were going to give it everything we had. But it wasn't until we
climbed up the Hillary Step that I knew we were going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   They stood together on the summit's rounded dome. "There was
plenty of room for Tenzing and me," Hillary said. "I had a very
strong feeling of satisfaction that Tenzing and I had finally reached
the summit when many had tried before unsuccessfully. And here we
were."</TE>
<TE>   He talked in an office at his home in Auckland. A wall holds the
wooden-handled, steel-headed ice ax he used--a tangible reminder not
only of the feat itself, but of the difference in the equipment
Hillary and Tenzing used and the high-tech gear carried by today's
mountaineers.</TE>
<TE>   Everest climbers now have ultralight weatherproof clothes and
boots and specially developed axes and ropes. Hillary and Tenzing had
heavy woolen underclothes and trousers stuffed with feather down.
They had soft leather boots and three pairs of gloves.</TE>
<TE>   Hillary says he was the first to set foot on the summit, climbing
ahead of Tenzing, who died in 1986. It doesn't seem to matter to him.
Neither could have done it without the other, he says.</TE>
<TE>   After picking their way up the Himalayan peak, a stoic Hillary
stood in the clear, cold air at the top of the world and solemnly
shook Tenzing's hand.</TE>
<TE>   "But that wasn't enough [for Tenzing]," Hillary said. "He threw
his arms around my shoulders. So I threw my arms around his
shoulders, and we gave each other a hug."</TE>
<TE>   After the initial euphoria, Hillary began snapping
photographs--mostly of Tenzing waving Nepalese and British flags--as
proof they had reached their goal. There is no image of Hillary at
the top.</TE>
<TE>   "There are of course no photographs of me on the summit; however,
I can assure you I was there," he said with a smile. "Tenzing didn't
have a camera ... and the thought of getting him to take a photograph
of me never really entered my mind."</TE>
<TE>   Hillary said he vividly remembers "many occasions" when he doubted
the pair would reach the top. Deep ravines and crevasses, avalanches,
extreme ice faces and rock walls stood in the way as they struggled
upward.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what it's all about really, overcoming those problems even
though you may have a sense of fear. I think fear can be a
stimulating factor and can help make you drive yourself really to
overcome dangerous problems," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hillary has prospered on his achievement ever since. But each time
he stands up as an after-dinner speaker, the impoverished Sherpa
people of Nepal benefit.</TE>
<TE>   For 40 years he has dedicated himself to raising money for them,
providing schools, hospitals, airstrips, bridges and roads, even
Buddhist monasteries. He's funneled about $500,000 a year for the
100,000 Sherpas.</TE>
<TE>   Tenzing and Hillary agreed long ago they had no desire to climb
Everest again.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become a bit commercially orientated. I think we were the
lucky ones way back in 1953," Hillary said.</TE>
<TE>   He bemoans the arrival of tourist mountaineers who now crowd the
peak during the climbing season every May.</TE>
<TE>   "They pay $65,000 to be shuttled up the mountain," he said. "We
weren't doing it for any financial reason at all. These commercial
expeditions nowadays are motivated by financial matters. I'm not
happy with them and have never been, really."</TE>
<TE>   Too many people with too little experience have to be led up the
mountain by their guides and watched carefully at all times, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them succeed and some of them don't. Some of them live
and some of them die," Hillary said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say 180 people have perished on Everest over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the changes in Everest endeavors, Hillary looks fondly on
the peak.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have pleasure in looking on the mountain and seeing a
stream of cold ice flowing from the summit.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I still have a feeling of satisfaction that Tenzing and I
were the first to the top."</TE>

<HD>Saudi Women Now Bare Their Faces -- on IDs</HD>
<DH>Rights: The cards, vehemently opposed by fundamentalists,
underscore the strides made by women in the Muslim kingdom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DONNA ABU-NASR</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>JIDDA, Saudi Arabia</DL>
<LD>When this country began issuing ID cards to women in November, the
hard-liners were quick to object.</LD>
<LD>   Women with picture IDs showing their faces unveiled? And what if
someone superimposed copies of the photos on nude bodies and
circulated them as pornography?</LD>
<LD>   "Whoever gets a card for his women will be acting like a pimp,"
said a leaflet issued by the fundamentalists.</LD>
<TE>   Still, less than six months later thousands of Saudi women are
carrying their own IDs, rather than be listed by name on a husband's
or father's card. It's an achievement that underlines the strides
women in the devoutly Muslim kingdom have made, as well as the
distance they still have to go.</TE>
<TE>   In its 2001 annual report, Amnesty International said that despite
Saudi Arabia's accession to the U.N. Women's Convention,
discrimination persists.</TE>
<TE>   It cited "limitations of freedom of movement, allowing for
effective imprisonment within the home and preventing recourse to
protection or redress from human rights abuses."</TE>
<TE>   The restrictions are defended by many Saudis as necessary to
prevent women from slipping into permissive Western ways. And in this
complex society, such attitudes aren't a function of age, wealth or
education.</TE>
<TE>   Even among some affluent, educated Saudi women, reports such as
Amnesty's arouse anger. They say the West pronounces judgment with
total disregard for local traditions and values and promotes reforms
that conflict with the women's Islamic upbringing and conservative
environment.</TE>
<TE>   They point out that education was allowed for women only 40 years
ago, and since then they have gone from almost zero literacy to equal
enrollment in schools and universities.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has given credit to Saudi Arabia for that," said Princess
Fahda, daughter of the late King Saud and head of a women's welfare
charity. "They tell us you're backward, but they don't see what's
behind the abaya"--the shapeless black cloak women must wear in
public.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want the Americans to come and make demands on our
behalf," she added. "Leave us alone to solve our own problems."</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, agree with Amnesty's assessment, saying they feel
discriminated against, especially in job opportunities and the almost
exclusively male business world.</TE>
<TE>   Those women who dare to expose their eyes or face in public risk
being harassed by the powerful religious police.</TE>
<TE>   Women cannot travel, get an education or a job or check into a
hotel alone without written approval from a male guardian. Women
cannot drive.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi women who work--less than 10% do--are encouraged to enter
fields such as teaching at girls schools to avoid mixing with male
employees or customers. In college they cannot major in engineering,
archeology or law, jobs that would get them out in the field or in
contact with men, although recently many have begun specializing in
finance, public relations and management.</TE>
<TE>   There are women-only clubs where females can shed the abaya. The
clubs offer restaurants, boutiques, health clubs, computer and
language classes, Internet cafes and beauty salons.</TE>
<TE>   They usually have a swimming pool, but women must wear a one-piece
swimsuit plus knee-length shorts.</TE>
<TE>   But outside home or the clubs, much of a Saudi woman's
surroundings are filtered through the monochromatic black gauze of
the veil.</TE>
<TE>   One element holding back bigger reforms is the religious
establishment.</TE>
<TE>   The government bases its legitimacy on a rigorously conservative
form of Islam and is careful not to upset this establishment.</TE>
<TE>   When the Interior Ministry announced in November 1999 that
preparations were underway to issue ID cards to women who asked for
them, delegations of conservatives visited Crown Prince Abdullah to
protest.</TE>
<TE>   It took two years for the ministry to issue the cards, and a woman
still needs her male guardian's approval to get one.</TE>
<TE>   Women need the ID cards chiefly for banking transactions, to prove
property ownership and to protect themselves against fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The ID card revolution was preceded by other advances that have
allowed women to venture slowly into male domains.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, on her first day as a part-time consultant at
Jidda's Chamber of Commerce, Nadia Baeshen was shocked when an
elevator full of men emptied the moment she stepped in.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd never seen a woman in the building before," recalled
Baeshen, a graduate of the University of Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   But less than a year later, the men not only were getting in the
elevator with her, they would shout to her to hold the door.</TE>
<TE>   Today, dozens of Saudi women are learning accounting and
management skills at the women's training center Baeshen helped set
up in the chamber.</TE>
<TE>   Samar Fatany, a radio journalist, insists that Saudi women are not
oppressed.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, we want reforms and there are a lot of shortcomings," she
said. "But if a woman is qualified enough, she will open doors."</TE>
<TE>   Women now find the state-controlled press more open to airing
their grievances.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, in an open letter to Abdullah published March 29,
respected writer Nourah Abdul Aziz Khreiji spoke about the trouble
she had getting a new electronic chip to widen the reach of her
mobile phone.</TE>
<TE>   The staff at Saudi Telecom Co. insisted she produce a male
guardian as guarantor, fearing that if she didn't pay her bills, its
male staff would have difficulty confronting her.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are Saudi women treated so unfairly ... ?" Khreiji wrote in
the English-language Arab News daily. "I hope that you will find it
possible to direct those who suppress women in the name of the law to
establish procedures which deal with both sexes on an equal basis."</TE>
<TE>   Women also want a say in decision-making. There are no female
government ministers and no women on the appointed consultative Shura
Council, although women have been invited by council committees to
discuss women's issues.</TE>
<TE>   More private companies are seeking female employees, but it's
costly.</TE>
<TE>   They must furnish segregated work spaces as well as special
equipment for the women to communicate with male colleagues from a
distance.</TE>
<TE>   Women who own their own store or company must deputize a male
"agent" to take care of government transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Some women, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of
reprisal, said the biggest humiliation is not the abaya or the
driving ban but the muttawa, or religious police, who enforce the
rules.</TE>
<TE>   They say the police make them feel like objects incapable of
taking care of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   They say a married woman and her husband both risk public
scoldings for the slightest infraction, such as sitting apart at a
dinner party.</TE>
<TE>   The muttawa, government-paid agents of the Committee to Prevent
Vice and Promote Virtue, were recently accused in the local press of
preventing girls from fleeing a school fire in the holy city of Mecca
because the girls were not wearing abayas.</TE>
<TE>   The committee as well as the Interior Ministry said the claims
were false.</TE>
<TE>   Although the muttawa presence on the streets has decreased over
the last two years, it is still a force to contend with.</TE>
<TE>   Still, despite all the restrictions, most Saudi women return home
after getting an overseas education.</TE>
<TE>   "I chose to come back," said Baeshen. "This is not a static
society. Change will come, but according to my pace. American women
took their sweet time. Let me take mine."</TE>

<HD>A Novel Idea to Tame Numbers of Wild Horses</HD>
<DH>West: Government plans to use birth control to reduce
population and improve health of herds. Some are skeptical.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>LOVELL, Wyo.--For Linda Coates-Markle, watching the young mares in
the herd of wild horses that roam this region's Pryor Mountain Range
can be depressing.</LD>
<LD>   Many are skinny and weak. Their foals, if they survive, are often
sickly, perpetuating the unhealthy condition of their mothers.</LD>
<LD>   It is why Coates-Markle and other federal land managers believe
birth control for some wild horses in the West has become necessary.</LD>
<TE>   "It seems to be a pretty humane alternative," said Coates-Markle,
who oversees the Bureau of Land Management's wild horse and burro
program in the area along the Wyoming-Montana border. "We want to
give these mares a chance to grow up."</TE>
<TE>   For years, the BLM relied largely on roundups to remove wild
horses from their Western range. Horses and burros were put up for
adoption as a way to help control the population, estimated at 40,000
scattered throughout 10 Western states.</TE>
<TE>   But the agency now believes birth control may provide another
option--one that not only can help stabilize the population but also
improve the health and genetic viability of the herds freely roaming
some 34 million acres of public land.</TE>
<TE>   Birth control has long been used to regulate animal populations in
zoos and sometimes in the wild. But its expected use at the Pryor
Mountain horse range and possibly other BLM-managed areas this year
has made some animal rights activists nervous.</TE>
<TE>   They've cited past problems with the BLM's oversight of the horse
adoption program, accusing the agency of turning a blind eye while
some adopted horses were sent to slaughter.</TE>
<TE>   They also criticize the agency's announced goal of reducing the
size of herds to achieve a better balance with environmental
conditions, based on available forage and water.</TE>
<TE>   "Their track record is not dramatically good," said Alan Berger,
executive director of the Animal Protection Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Some also say birth control meddles with nature, while others
worry about potential long-term effects on the behavior and size of
wild horse herds.</TE>
<TE>   "If the objective is to make sure the populations don't continue
to grow, that in and of itself is problematic in our eyes," said
Andrea Lococo of the Fund for Animals. The organization does not
consider the wild horse population to be too large, and would prefer
that the government leave the herds alone.</TE>
<TE>   Officials hope to use the contraceptive vaccine as part of the
agency's population control effort for the first time this year. The
contraceptive shots, meant to prevent pregnancy for a year, have been
used previously on wild horses on federal land, but only in small
tests, said Tom Pogacnik, senior wild horse and burro specialist for
the BLM in Reno.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the BLM is helping to fund development of another birth
control vaccine that would last for two years. Trials of that drug
are planned for this year.</TE>
<TE>   The birth control vaccine causes the immune system to produce
antibodies that block fertilization. Researchers say it is about 90%
effective in delaying conception in treated mares, and they have seen
no ill effects on the horses or environment.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking to slow up reproduction, not stop it," Pogacnik
said. "It will slow down the rate of reproduction, meaning fewer
roundups. All the way around, it's a better thing for the horses."</TE>
<TE>   One of the sites where the vaccine has been used is Assateague
Island National Seashore on the East Coast, where National Park
Service managers had concerns with the health of wild horses and
their range.</TE>
<TE>   Using birth control, the island's horse population stabilized over
eight years and the age of the oldest horse also rose substantially.</TE>
<TE>   "Their body condition improves. Their quality of life is better,"
said Jay Kirkpatrick, part of the research team working with the
contraceptive and overseeing its production at ZooMontana's Science
and Conservation Center, a research facility in Billings, Mont.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an immense frustration that we can't get this applied in
a broader way. Previous decisions by the BLM have nothing to do with
this," Kirkpatrick said. "There is no big plot to wipe out the West's
wild horse herds."</TE>
<TE>   Computer models have helped land managers predict effects on horse
herds with or without administering birth control. They also have
helped alleviate concerns that the population might crash, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Coates-Markle hopes to administer the vaccine to 22 mares among a
160-horse herd at the Pryor Mountain Range this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "The public has expressed a great deal of concern over seeing
these mares in poor shape and their babies in poor shape, and there
really is no need for it," Coates-Markle said.</TE>
<TE>   In the last six years, about 20% of 2-year-old mares and 27% of
3-year-olds lost their foals, often because the animals were breeding
too young, she said. In three cases, both the mare and foal died.
Mares conceiving as yearlings or 2-year-olds may need a year or more
to recuperate after giving birth, she said.</TE>

<HD>Fewer Doctors Specialize in Elder Care</HD>
<DH>Health: Medicare's low pay for geriatricians is cited as a
reason for the decline. And the number of elderly is rising.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANELLE CARTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When Marie Brown's 97-year-old mother fell and broke her hip two
years ago, it started the family on an often frustrating quest for
appropriate medical care.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors unfamiliar with the health issues of the elderly initially
put Mary Holmes, then 94, on bed rest. That weakened her muscles so
that her knees no longer could bend. The Washington, D.C., woman
became permanently bedridden.</LD>
<LD>   "I think she became pretty down," said Brown, 65. Before the
accident, she said, her mother loved to dote on her family and often
would have her four children and a host of grandchildren over for
dinner. "She just got depressed. She was just laying there."</LD>
<TE>   Frustrated with the care her mother was receiving, Brown began
searching for medical professionals trained to deal with the elderly.
For the last year, her mother has been working with a geriatric team
from the Washington Hospital Center that provides medical care and
therapy.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately when you go to a non-geriatric doctor, they
give you a pill and send you home," Brown said. "The people who are
trained really pay attention to what's happening to you."</TE>
<TE>   Geriatricians are doctors with expertise in caring for older
people. Most are trained in family practice or internal medicine but
have completed one additional year of fellowship training in
geriatrics.</TE>
<TE>   "Training in geriatric medicine can help save or improve the lives
of people who still have much to give," said Dr. Charles Cefalu,
director of geriatric program development at Louisiana State
University.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials are sounding the alarm that, in a country where
the number of elderly is on the rise, there are too few health
providers knowledgeable about aging issues. They want Congress to
address the shortage this year as lawmakers write far-reaching
Medicare reform legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "The shortage of geriatric-trained health-care professionals is
reaching crisis levels," said Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.), chairman
of the Senate's Special Committee on Aging.</TE>
<TE>   The United States should have 20,000 geriatric-trained physicians
to adequately care for the 35 million older people in this country,
says the Alliance for Aging Research, an advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   But fewer than 9,000 of the nation's 650,000 licensed physicians
have met the qualifying criteria in geriatrics, and that number is
expected to drop to as few as 6,100 by 2004, the alliance said in a
recent report.</TE>
<TE>   Reasons for the shortage vary and include a lack of geriatric
curriculum at medical schools. But officials say topping the list is
Medicare's paltry payments for doctors who care for the elderly. Just
this year, doctors treating Medicare patients learned there would be
a 5.4% cut in Medicare payments.</TE>
<TE>   The cut would cost a geriatrician $30,630 a year, according to the
American College of Physicians. A four-physician geriatrics practice
would lose $122,520 a year, the group estimated.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors are lobbying Congress to restore the money.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real disincentive," said Daniel Perry, executive director
of the Alliance for Aging Research.</TE>
<TE>   A geriatrician often does a complete assessment of a patient,
bringing in nutritionists, pharmacists and social workers--a process
that takes a considerable amount of time.</TE>
<TE>   "When time comes to be recertified ... they have to ask
themselves, 'Why am I seeing all of these old people on Medicare
because Medicare every year is paying me less and less,'" Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is coming just as the number of older Americans--those
65 and older--is expected to more than double, to 70 million by the
year 2030.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance wants Congress to set goals for increasing the number
of geriatric providers in all fields. It also is calling for
financial incentives, such as loan forgiveness and continuing
education funds, to entice professionals into the field.</TE>

<HD>Vigorous Exercise Cuts Cancer Death Risk, Study Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRA DREYFUSS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Physically fit people are less likely to die of cancer, including
cancers related to smoking, even if they smoke, a study finds.</LD>
<LD>   But other studies indicate the benefit may come only with vigorous
exercise; less-intense activities, such as brisk walks, won't be
enough.</LD>
<LD>   "Fitness may provide protection against cancer mortality," said
the study in the May issue of the journal Medicine and Science in
Sports and Exercise.</LD>
<TE>   The researchers followed 25,892 men ages 30 to 87 who took
treadmill tests to determine the most exercise they could do. The men
were followed for an average of 10 years. In this time, there were
133 deaths from cancers related to smoking and 202 deaths from other
cancers.</TE>
<TE>   The fittest men had a 55% lower risk of all-cause cancer death
than did the least-fit men, and moderately fit men had a 38% lower
risk, said researchers Chong Do Lee of West Texas A&amp;M University and
Steven N. Blair of the Cooper Institute of Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   To be moderately fit, a person would have to run 20 to 40 minutes,
three to five times a week. To be most fit, a person would have to be
at the recreationally competitive level.</TE>
<TE>   The most-fit men had a 46% lower risk, and moderately fit men had
a 34% lower risk of cancers unrelated to smoking. These diseases
include cancers of the colon and prostate, and leukemia, which
affects white blood cells.</TE>
<TE>   The most-fit men had a 66% lower risk and the moderately fit men a
43% lower risk of cancers related to smoking, such as cancers of the
lung and mouth. If the least-fit smokers had become fit, they would
have reduced their death risk by 13%, a statistical analysis in the
study concluded.</TE>
<TE>   The most-fit men were least likely to smoke, but almost 10% of
them did, as did 20% of moderately fit men and 33% of sedentary men.
The most-fit and moderately fit smokers were still less likely to die
than were the sedentary smokers, Lee said. "If you are a high-fit
smoker, then you should have a lower risk," Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   Just the same, Lee and other experts say exercise is no substitute
for giving up smoking. The study found that nonsmokers who were the
most physically fit had the lowest risk of dying of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers theorized that the heavy breathing that comes with
vigorous activity clears the lungs of some cancer-causing chemicals
associated with smoking. And fitness may help the body in other ways,
such as improving defensive systems that may keep tumors from
forming, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a seminal study," said Scott Leischow, chief of the
tobacco control research branch of the National Cancer Institute. He
was not involved in the study.</TE>
<TE>   The study should encourage smokers who can't--or won't--quit to be
at least good exercisers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Smokers should check with a doctor before starting an exercise
program, because smoking can cause otherwise hidden problems such as
heart disease, which the stress of exercise may trigger, Leischow
said.</TE>
<TE>   The study could not rule out the possibility that cancer death may
simply have come after the average of 10 years that the researchers
examined. And the researchers did not tally new diagnoses, so they
could not tell if exercise prevented cancer or simply helped the
exercisers survive it.</TE>
<TE>   It's possible that the physically fit men simply were better able
to benefit from cancer treatment, which itself can be arduous, said
Dr. George Selby of the University of Oklahoma, who was not connected
with the study.</TE>
<TE>   Another possibility is that the fit men also were more careful
about their own health and saw doctors more often, so their cancers
were diagnosed earlier when the chance of successful treatment was
greater, Selby said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Selby counsels people to exercise for other health
benefits, he said he could not yet tell them that exercise would
reduce their risk of dying of cancer.</TE>

<HD>Uncovering a Mystery at Fortress</HD>
<DH>History: Ft. Frederick was important during the
Revolutionary War. But specific architectural details remain elusive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID DISHNEAU</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BIG POOL, Md.</DL>
<LD>Ft. Frederick, the cornerstone of Maryland's frontier defense during
the French and Indian War, is an awesome, unfinished puzzle.</LD>
<LD>   During the American Revolution, Ft. Frederick was a prison for
Hessian and British soldiers. The state sold it in 1791 and it passed
through a number of owners, including one who tended livestock and
fruit trees inside the enclosure.</LD>
<LD>   By the time the state repurchased the fortress in 1922, its walls
were crumbling and there was nothing inside to indicate soldiers once
were housed there.</LD>
<TE>   Ross Kimmel was a graduate student in his late 20s when he started
researching the roots of the fort. Nearly 30 years later, he's still
stumped--baffled by missing details of the gun decks that protected
the massive stone structure, puzzled by the design of its officers'
quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Kimmel, chief historian for the state parks, is appealing to the
public for help in locating drawings or documents that would help the
state accurately reconstruct those features by 2006, the fort's 250th
anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had some wild goose chases--people who say they have sets
of plans or have seen sets of plans--but we never seem to be able to
chase them down," Kimmel said during a visit to Ft. Frederick State
Park along the Potomac River.</TE>
<TE>   Located near Interstate 70, about 90 miles west of Baltimore, the
fort has grayish brown sandstone walls 17 feet high and 3 feet to 4
feet thick that dwarf nearby park buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the one-third-mile perimeter are 1.5 acres of grass where
Colonial soldiers drilled and prepared for attacks that never came.
Kimmel says the only enemy shot reportedly fired at the fort--from
its construction in 1756 until the war ended in 1763--missed a sentry
posted outside the gate and bounced off an exterior wall.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the enlisted men's barracks are back in place--two long,
white, two-story wood-frame structures that were reconstructed in the
1970s to Kimmel's specifications.</TE>
<TE>   Missing is the officers' quarters, or Governor's House, a smaller
building that stood on a foundation excavated in the 1930s by the
Civilian Conservation Corps.</TE>
<TE>   Also missing are whatever structures the soldiers would have stood
atop while aiming muskets and cannons over the high walls. Kimmel
said nothing supports a theory that a wooden catwalk once ringed the
interior walls, and there is no archeological evidence of earthen
mounds in the fort's four corners, or bastions.</TE>
<TE>   It's not for want of looking. In what became a career-long
frustration, Kimmel has been combing records for clues to Ft.
Frederick's design since 1973, when he signed on with the state for a
summer job. He has checked the so-called King's Maps, a collection of
British documents that include references to Colonial North American
forts. He has read the correspondence of Gov. Horatio Sharpe, who
secured funding for Ft. Frederick in 1756 and wrote to Virginia Lt.
Gov. Robert Dinwiddie about some plans he had drawn up. "It turned up
precious little," Kimmel grumbles.</TE>
<TE>   Most tantalizing is the mysterious man who walked into the
Maryland State Archives in the late 1990s with what appeared to be
18th century architectural drawings--technically called military
elevations--of the fort.</TE>
<TE>   "As I recall, they were trying to market it," said R.J.
Rockefeller, director of reference services at the archive, who saw
the material. "It was shown to us and removed and we heard not again
from the patron."</TE>
<TE>   Park Manager Ralph Young figures the man was from Maryland or
nearby but he left no name or other identifying information.</TE>
<TE>   Kimmel aims to track him down. "At this point, that's our best
hope," he said.</TE>

<HD>A Secrete Weapon in War on Lampreys</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: The key to controlling the parasites may lie in a
foul bile acid that males give off to attract mates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN FLESHER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Disrupting the sea lamprey's mating call may be the key to limiting
its numbers in the Great Lakes, where the eel-like parasite sucks the
life out of sport fish, scientists say.</LD>
<LD>   Male lampreys secrete a smelly bile acid during spawning season
that draws ovulating females to nests, where they lay eggs for males
to fertilize, Michigan State University researchers said.</LD>
<LD>   The find might lead to better trapping and sterilization programs
in the Great Lakes, where the lamprey is a pariah. But it also could
help produce more lampreys in places where they are considered a
delicacy--and it suggests that sex lures might be used to raise or
reduce other fish populations.</LD>
<TE>   "This research will help us produce new and more effective
techniques for sea lamprey control," said Chris Goddard, executive
secretary of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, a U.S.-Canadian
agency that helped fund the study.</TE>
<TE>   The sea lamprey, native to the Atlantic Ocean, is believed to have
invaded the Great Lakes through shipping channels in the early 20th
century.</TE>
<TE>   The jawless critter clamps its powerful disc-like mouth onto the
sides of fish, digs in and sucks their body fluids. When satisfied,
the lamprey releases its hapless host, which usually dies from the
wound or a later infection.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1950s, lampreys had decimated lake trout and wreaked havoc
with other popular species such as whitefish and sturgeon, Goddard
said. Control programs have cut their numbers sharply in most of the
Great Lakes, but they still do significant damage.</TE>
<TE>   The study, published April 5 in the journal Science, labels the
lamprey invasion "arguably the worst ecological disaster ever to
befall a large watershed."</TE>
<TE>   After three to five years in the larval stage, the lamprey spends
only a year to 18 months in its parasitic form before moving into
streams to spawn and die. But the typical adult lives long enough to
kill about 40 pounds of fish.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists long suspected that males emitted a pheromone, or
chemical "message" that guided females to nests, said fish
physiologist Weiming Li, who led the research team. The Michigan
State study confirmed the fact and helped explain how it happens.</TE>
<TE>   Li's team captured sexually mature males and put them in
containers where they could secrete the chemical, manufactured in
their livers. Then, over two years, the scientists condensed the
water until they had a pure sample of the compound.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers used behavioral tests, including placing females
in a maze, to show that the chemical is a sexual lure. They found it
is potent enough, and produced in sufficient quantity, to attract
females over long distances.</TE>
<TE>   By analyzing its molecular structure, the researchers learned how
to make synthetic versions of the chemical but still need to find
ways to do so less expensively, Li said.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, scientists control lamprey populations by
sterilization, placing barriers in streams to prevent spawning, and
putting low concentrations of a pesticide into streams to kill
larvae.</TE>
<TE>   The newly discovered chemical could make it easier to capture
lampreys for sterilization, Li said. Also, spawning grounds could be
"flooded" with the chemical to confuse females, preventing them from
finding nests built by males.</TE>
<TE>   "You could manipulate their movements into streams where you want
them and keep them out of streams where you don't want them," said
Dennis Lavis, supervisor of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
biological station at Ludington, which does lamprey control work.</TE>
<TE>   "Any good pest control program needs a number of alternative
methods, and this research offers some very exciting possibilities."</TE>
<TE>   It's just as promising for people who like lampreys. The critter
is a culinary delight in some countries, such as Finland and France.</TE>
<TE>   "That's actually what got us started," Li said. "French fishermen
used to bait traps with males to increase their catch. We figured
that perhaps this meant the males were releasing a pheromone."</TE>
<TE>   Li is working with a couple of American Indian tribes trying to
restore lampreys in the Columbia River and its tributaries. Once
scientists refine the use of the bile acid, it might improve the
efficiency of hatcheries--or at least act as a lamprey matchmaker.</TE>

<HD>Marlboro Man, Without the Marlboros</HD>
<DH>Marketing: He was pictured on billboards around the world,
helping to make the cigarettes famous. He tells of his own celebrity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VINCE DEVLIN</AU>
<BD>MISSOULIAN</BD>
<DL>MISSOULA, Mont.</DL>
<LD>It was his brother who got him started, back in the 1930s. They lived
in the Helena area. Bought papers, got hold of tobacco and rolled
their own. W.Z. "Herf" Ingersoll was 10 years old when he took up
smoking.</LD>
<LD>   He fired up his final cigarette in 1998, ending a 60-year
pack-a-day habit. A bout with pneumonia that landed him in a hospital
convinced Ingersoll it was time to give it up. No nicotine patches or
nicotine gum for Ingersoll--"That just prolongs it," he says. The
longtime Montana rancher quit cold turkey.</LD>
<LD>   "I haven't taken a puff off one of the stupid things since," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   But he's still a Marlboro Man. That'll happen when you spend seven
years with pictures of you smoking Marlboros plastered on billboards
around the world, and inside Time, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and
dozens of other magazines.</TE>
<TE>   This is the tale of a real-life Marlboro Man.</TE>
<TE>   What you need to know first is that the biggest-selling cigarettes
of all time, Marlboros, once were a minor brand, marketed toward
women. Marlboro's motto actually was "Mild as May." Their filters
were red, to not show lipstick stains.</TE>
<TE>   Camels were king. But changes were happening that would make
America Marlboro Country.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1950s, when the first reports linking smoking to lung
cancer came out, some smokers felt betrayed by the established
brands. Unable to quit altogether, some retaliated by switching
brands. The Philip Morris Co. saw an opportunity to improve
Marlboro's pathetic market share.</TE>
<TE>   The company turned to the Leo Burnett Agency of Chicago, and it
handed the account to an ad exec named Don Tennant. It didn't take
Tennant long to figure out that Marlboro's previous ad campaigns
ignored at least half the potential market.</TE>
<TE>   And what would make this woman's cigarette more manly? Well, in a
word: men.</TE>
<TE>   William Thourlby is 6 feet, 4 inches, with deep-set eyes and a
battered nose--more rugged-looking than pretty--whose modeling career
consisted mainly of posing as the tough guy grabbing women on the
cover of True Confessions-type magazines.</TE>
<TE>   Discovered at a casting call, soon a bare-chested Thourlby, who
now lives in New York City (it was a couple of later Marlboro models
who would die of cancer), was pictured on billboards across America,
smoking a cigarette with a vaguely familiar name.</TE>
<TE>   In the beginning, Marlboro Men were not necessarily cowboys. They
were lean, rugged outdoorsmen, Navy officers, pilots and, yes, cattle
ranchers. But their effect was immediate: Within eight months of the
introduction of the Marlboro Man, sales increased a staggering
5,000%.</TE>
<TE>   The Ingersoll spread, nearly 5,000 acres, is several miles east of
Lincoln, Mont. Wolf Creek is their mailing address; Augusta is where
their children Ron and Janet went to school. It was in Augusta, in
1974, where Herf was "discovered."</TE>
<TE>   Ingersoll was taking tickets at the town's annual rodeo. A
photographer, Jim Braddy, who worked for the Leo Burnett Agency,
didn't have a ticket and was trying to get in. Ingersoll pointed
Braddy, who was in town to scout for fresh Marlboro Men, in the
direction of someone who could help.</TE>
<TE>   Later that night, cutting into a steak at Bowman's Corner, "I got
that feeling you get, you know, where people are staring at you? I
didn't know if I'd done something wrong or what," Ingersoll says.</TE>
<TE>   It was Braddy's table. The photographer was studying what he saw
under Ingersoll's cowboy hat. He approached the table, explained who
he was and what he wanted. The next day Ingersoll led Braddy to a
barn, Braddy snapped several frames of Ingersoll and left.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later Ingersoll got a phone call, and the cattle rancher
had a new career: modeling.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the experience of a lifetime for me," Ingersoll says.</TE>
<TE>   He was whisked off to Colorado for a weeklong shoot outside a
small town called Fairplay, south of Denver toward the Rocky
Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like that," Ingersoll says. "One time I got a phone call
at 7 a.m., by 7 that night I was in Albuquerque."</TE>
<TE>   The hours were long. Photo shoots began at daybreak, which meant
getting up at 3 or 4 in the morning, getting breakfast and getting to
the often remote site while it was still dark.</TE>
<TE>   The photographers and models would go to work at sunup. They'd
knock off about noon, then resume later in the afternoon when the
light got better, and work until dusk.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times we never even had time for supper," Ingersoll
says.</TE>
<TE>   The typical shoot lasted seven to 10 days, with no days off. All
of Ingersoll's expenses were covered. The pay was $150 a day when he
started and was up to $300 a day when he quit doing it seven years
later.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, Marlboros were provided.</TE>
<TE>   "We always had a coffee can with some water in it," Ingersoll
says. "They didn't wait long after you lit one before they'd stop.
They only wanted a little ash in the picture. Then you'd drop it in
the coffee can and light another one. A lot of the pictures were just
of you lighting a cigarette.''</TE>
<TE>   He says he'd typically use up half a carton of Marlboros--five
packs--on a day's shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Ingersoll wasn't a Marlboro Man when he started modeling--his
smokes were unfiltered. "But from my first day [modeling], Marlboro
was my brand," he says. During the first few years, Philip Morris
sent all the cigarettes he wanted to his home too.</TE>
<TE>   "But then they quit," Ingersoll says. "They said it was unlawful
to send them through the mail. I don't think that's true, but anyway,
after that, I had to buy my own."</TE>
<TE>   What did Jim Braddy see that day at the Augusta Rodeo?</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you had to be a smoker--if you're not, you just don't hold
the cigarette right," Ingersoll says. "They wanted crow's feet around
your eyes, a Dick Tracy chin.</TE>
<TE>   "And you had to know how to ride a horse."</TE>

<HD>Dreaming of Bus Shuttles, With Mars as Destination</HD>
<DH>Space: Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin is involved in a
project to send people to the Red Planet, maybe by 2018.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REX W. HUPPKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP)</DL>
<LD>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.--Though it will likely be decades before a human
sets foot on the surface of Mars, former astronaut Buzz Aldrin and
scientists at Purdue University already are working on a shuttle they
hope will one day take people from Earth to the Red Planet and back.</LD>
<LD>   The interstellar bus line would involve two massive spacecraft
that could house up to 50 people on their six-month shuttles between
the two planets. The craft would continuously cycle between Earth and
Mars using gravity as their primary power source, with an occasional
shot from a booster rocket.</LD>
<LD>   "If we're going to go to Mars with human beings, we need to do it
in an evolutionary way, so that we can continue doing it," said
Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon.</LD>
<TE>   James Longuski, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at
Purdue, agrees that it doesn't make sense to land the first people on
Mars without knowing how to land more.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to know what the transportation setup would look like
before we've even set foot on Mars," Longuski said.</TE>
<TE>   While it may sound like putting the wagon a few light-years ahead
of the horse, Jim Garvin, NASA's lead scientist for Mars exploration,
said these ideas must be considered now, even though human travel to
Mars is a distant goal. In fact, it's not on the current
administration's radar.</TE>
<TE>   NASA's Mars program has been set back in recent years,
particularly in 1999 when two spacecraft failed upon reaching Mars,
one burning up in the planet's atmosphere and the other disappearing
after a software failure.</TE>
<TE>   The program got back on track earlier this year when the Mars
Odyssey spacecraft entered an orbit around the Red Planet and began
mapping the mineral and chemical makeup of the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Garvin said NASA would spend about $500 million a year over the
next 10 years on Mars exploration.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a decade of discovery for Mars," Garvin said. "It will
fill in the homework we need, so come 2010, maybe sooner, we'll know
enough to start asking the question, 'Now what do we do if we want to
insert humans as the explorers?'"</TE>
<TE>   Aldrin first came up with the idea of an Earth-to-Mars cycler in
the mid-1990s, and he's been working on it ever since. Along with
Longuski at Purdue, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and the University of Texas are involved in the project.</TE>
<TE>   All the research so far is theoretical, and Longuski said the
earliest he could imagine cyclers being used is 2018.</TE>
<TE>   The craft would never actually stop at either planet. A smaller
"taxi" vehicle would dock with the cycler on its sweep past,
unloading passengers and transporting them to the surface.</TE>
<TE>   "These cyclers, they just whiz on by," Longuski said. "It's like a
bus that never stops. Passengers just have to jump on as it's going
past."</TE>
<TE>   Once a cycler is launched on a specific trajectory, gravity would
keep it circling the planet. This is what's known as a gravitational
"slingshot" effect.</TE>
<TE>   As a spacecraft travels near a planet, the gravity of that planet
pulls the craft toward it, then whips it around the other side,
boosting its speed.</TE>
<TE>   This is the same phenomenon that in 1970 helped NASA safely bring
home the crippled Apollo 13, using the moon's gravity to slingshot
the craft and crew back to Earth.</TE>
<TE>   The trick is finding the right path for these cyclers to follow.
The orbits of Earth and Mars are out of sync--Earth moves around the
sun in an almost circular path, while Mars' orbit is more of an oval.</TE>
<TE>   That makes finding the right trajectory a devilishly complicated
mix of celestial mechanics and mathematical theory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a game of celestial billiards," Longuski said. "Tell me
which shot will knock all the balls into the pockets."</TE>
<TE>   Students at Purdue are using complex computer simulations to
calculate the right paths. Researchers at Texas and MIT are
considering other details, like how to get the cycler positioned just
right in space to begin its journey, and how to design the taxi craft
that will ferry people to land.</TE>
<TE>   Garvin, of NASA, said other innovators across the country are
brainstorming about Mars colonization, considering everything from
how colonies will be constructed to how life will be sustained.</TE>
<TE>   "We need those ideas, we need to support them," Garvin said.
"You've got to build the foundation first before you build the
cathedral."</TE>
<TE>   But why, besides the inherent mysteries of a far-off place, should
so much effort go toward colonizing Mars?</TE>
<TE>   The nation's enthusiasm about the space program has waned since
the Apollo missions, and a recent Brookings Institution survey on
government priorities puts space exploration near the bottom of the
list.</TE>
<TE>   Aldrin said the push toward Mars is inevitable, both for economic
and scientific reasons, and it's imperative for America to lead the
way. Russia already has started capitalizing on space tourism,
something Aldrin believes could become a major industry and a primary
source of funding for Mars exploration.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the leadership will come to the nation that develops a
strong space transportation system," Aldrin said. "The nation that
develops that will have an absolute clear advantage over others,
economically and in many other ways."</TE>
<TE>   Longuski sees the colonization of Mars more as a necessity for
survival--10,000 or 100,000 years down the road--given the Earth's
limits in room and natural resources.</TE>
<TE>   Longuski and Aldrin also remain hopeful that the public's
enthusiasm about space, about charting unexplored worlds, will
continue to grow as more is learned about Mars.</TE>
<TE>   Demonstrating his continuing dreams of space, Aldrin in 1996
co-authored a book called "Encounter With Tiber," a fictional tale of
space exploration and the colonization of Mars.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives people great ideas to ponder," Longuski said. "Great
dreams."</TE>

<HD>Iressa Buying Time for a Few Cancer Patients</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Latest drugs are new strategy in fight, with good
results, but uncertainties prevail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL Q. HANEY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first clue that Gloria Caruso's medical long shot might pay off,
two years into her losing encounter with cancer, was the look she saw
one day on her doctors' faces. Usually they were so grim, waiting for
her with news that ranged from the bad to the very, very bad.</LD>
<LD>   She had stopped in to hear the results of her latest CT scan,
taken to chronicle her tumor's inexorable spread. But this time the
medical people were, unbelievably, smiling.</LD>
<LD>   "They were jumping up and down," she remembers. "This is not the
reaction you expect to see at an oncologist's office."</LD>
<TE>   Not for someone with lung cancer. Especially not for someone who
had already endured so much. Doctors had cut out part of Caruso's
right lung. They had put her through four horrific rounds of
chemotherapy. And her cancer kept spreading.</TE>
<TE>   In the months before that appointment last year, the future could
hardly have looked worse. At 62, an airline reservation agent who
never smoked, she was out of good options. More chemo was probably
pointless. So was radiation.</TE>
<TE>   But rather than give up, she worked the Internet, hoping to find
an experimental medicine to try. There she ran across a pill called
Iressa. Though not sold yet, it was available in some desperate cases
like hers.</TE>
<TE>   Iressa is one of a new class of medicines called epidermal growth
factor receptor inhibitors, and it is as good an example as any of
how strategy is changing in the war against cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Iressa is nothing like ordinary chemo, which essentially blasts
all fast-growing cells, good or bad. Instead, this drug is designed
from scratch to jam only the signals that fuel the rampant growth of
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Its maker, AstraZeneca, hopes to have it on the market later this
year, and rival versions are likely to follow. At least 10 others are
in human testing.</TE>
<TE>   Iressa and its competitors are just one of the many new ideas that
so excite cancer doctors these days. All are built on 30 years of
research into the basic biology of tumors, into understanding
precisely how a cancer cell varies from a normal one. Because these
drugs zero in on these differences, they are called targeted
therapies.</TE>
<TE>   When all goes as planned, they stifle cancer but ignore the
healthy parts. This means patients should avoid the hair loss and
vomiting and other routine rigors of standard cancer medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Because of Caruso's advanced disease, any new treatment was
unlikely to do much good. Still, with few side effects, Iressa seemed
worth a try. She started on the pills in February 2001 and a month
later went in for the scan.</TE>
<TE>   "The tumors had disappeared," Caruso said. "They were gone." And
they've stayed gone, as best doctors can tell.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd call her in near complete remission," says Dr. John
Rucksdeschel, director of the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center &amp; Research
Institute in Tampa, Fla., where Caruso lives. "There's some stuff I
can't tell whether it is scar or active tumor. But I don't care. It
is as if she didn't have widespread lung cancer. She is full of life
and living it to the hilt."</TE>
<TE>   No one can say how long her good fortune will last. Almost
certainly the cancer is still there, even if it cannot be seen.</TE>
<TE>   In the world of experimental drug therapy, Caruso is one of the
rare winners. In testing so far, about 10% to 15% of end-of-the-line
lung cancer patients on Iressa and rival drugs have had significant
responses, although most eventually relapse and die. Doctors hope the
drugs will work better if given to people in earlier stages of
disease. But no one really expects these drugs to be an
across-the-board cancer remedy, especially when used alone.</TE>
<TE>   Still, doctors can't explain their enthusiasm for drugs that
perhaps have cured no one yet. Largely, it seems, they are excited
because they believe Iressa and other targeted therapies in
development are just the start of an entirely new and better way of
dealing with cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "We are really at the beginning of a new era in treatment,"
predicts Dr. Boris Pasche, an oncologist at Northwestern Memorial
Hospital in Chicago. "What we do now with chemotherapy will be seen
as barbaric in 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   The National Cancer Institute is sponsoring more than 60 studies
with Iressa and a similar drug called Tarceva that is being developed
by OSI Pharmaceuticals, Genentech and Roche. Its goal is to try them
on less common forms of cancer as well as search for tests to help
predict who will respond best to them.</TE>
<TE>   "Will they make a dramatic difference in outcome?" asks Dr. Janet
Dancey, senior clinical investigator at the institute. "Well,
hopefully. What's more likely is there will be a spectrum of effects.
They will be highly effective in some people, mostly those with early
stage disease. They will have some effect on others, and
unfortunately there will be a group in which they simply won't work,
because that's the nature of cancer."</TE>
<TE>   The nature of cancer, of course, is its frustrating ability, seen
over and over, to elude the best-planned treatments. While most tumor
cells may be killed, a few often have built-in backup systems that
allow them to survive. Just one of these cells in time can grow to
take over the body and kill it.</TE>
<TE>   Because of cancer's resiliency, most doubt any single new drug
will be broadly effective. Combinations that strike at cancer at
multiple points in its life cycle will probably be necessary to
predictably cure it, and these are probably still years away.</TE>
<TE>   But even Iressa's modest benefits are remarkable for one reason,
says Dr. Roman Perez-Soler, oncology chief at Montefiore Medical
Center in New York City. "The key point is accomplishing this without
causing side effects, without poisoning patients. That is the
breakthrough."</TE>
<TE>   The main ill effect of Iressa, taken as a once-a-day pill, is a
rash that looks like teenage acne, and usually this is not much of a
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Iressa works--when it works--by blocking one of the main signals
cancer uses to propel its out-of-control growth, stimulation of the
chemical docking posts called the epidermal growth factor receptors.
Cancer cells may carry four closely related versions of this signal
receiver, and they can be turned on by at least a dozen different
body chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   Iressa gets inside cancer cells and blocks the signal that is
fired off when one of these receptors, called HER-1, is stimulated.
That signal is one of the driving forces that makes cancer do things
it should not, including growing quickly, spreading through the body
and becoming resistant to chemotherapy drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "In a real way, we are attacking the control panels that provide
the cancer cell with its unique properties to grow and metastasize,"
says Dr. Louis Weiner, chairman of medical oncology at the Fox Chase
Cancer Center in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   The first drug to do this was Herceptin, which blocks HER-2,
another of the epidermal growth factor receptors. It is useful in
about a third of breast cancer patients. Last year the drug Gleevec,
which blocks a different set of signals, became available for two
rare forms of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors are trying HER-1 and HER-2 blockers together, but they
believe it may be necessary to jam three to five of these signaling
pathways to completely stop a cancer. Many combinations may be
necessary to cover all the possible signals at play in different
cancers.</TE>
<TE>   Even without these dream combinations, doctors hope Iressa and
other HER-1 blockers will be useful for some of the most common
cancers, including breast, prostate and colon.</TE>
<TE>   At the top of the list, though, is lung cancer. This is the
leading cancer killer, responsible for 155,000 deaths annually, and a
truly awful diagnosis. Fewer than 15% of patients with it live for
five years. Twenty years of clinical trials have increased the
average survival by just two months.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors say symptoms often ease after just a couple of weeks on
the growth-factor blockers. And many physicians see an occasional
dramatic response. Dr. Linda Garland of the Arizona Cancer Center
remembers her first--a young woman dying of lung cancer after failing
three courses of chemo and radiation. The disease had spread to her
abdominal organs by the time she started on Iressa.</TE>
<TE>   "The next time I saw her in the clinic, it was like seeing a
different person," Garland said. "She looked and felt well. The CT
scan showed dramatic shrinkage of the cancer."</TE>
<TE>   That woman died in March, but on Iressa she gained seven
unexpected good months, time to look after her child, take a vacation
with her husband and enjoy life.</TE>
<TE>   When human testing of these drugs began, many doctors were
skeptical. At best, they hoped the medicines would stop cancer's
spread. Shrinking tumors seemed a lot to ask.</TE>
<TE>   "The drugs have pleasantly surprised us," says Dr. Vincent Miller,
a lung cancer specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in
New York City. "We approach things well-founded in science with
trepidation and skepticism, having been down the road before with
promising treatments."</TE>
<TE>   The next step will be to prove the drugs actually improve
survival. Four large studies are testing Iressa and Tarceva on
patients with the most common form of lung cancer, known as non-small
cell. The first results could be available in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   For a few like Caruso, though, these drugs already seem to have
paid off. "I work full time," she says. "I travel. I enjoy life to
the fullest. I can't say enough about this medicine. If it stops
working, I'll be back on my computer looking for the next newest
thing."</TE>

<HD>Why Reading Matters</HD>
<DH>NOTHING REMAINS THE SAME:  Rereading and Remembering, By
Wendy Lesser,  Houghton Mifflin: 234 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SVEN BIRKERTS</AU>
<BD>Sven Birkerts is the author of five books of essays,
including "Readings," and the forthcoming memoir, "My Sky Blue
Trades."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has become one of the cliches of fashionably inverted thought to
say that we don't read books so much as books read us. Or, to strike
a slight variation, that in reading books we read ourselves. Or,
varying further--and now applying the basic concept to Wendy Lesser's
delightful new collection of essays, "Nothing Remains the Same:
Rereading and Remembering"--returning to books that shaped us in our
youth, we discern in the encounter the vivid figments of our emerging
selves.</LD>
<LD>   Lesser, author of six previous books, including, most recently,
"The Amateur" (a title that gives a clue about her basic
self-presentation), is one of the shrewdest and most free-spoken of
our literary essayists. Fascinated by the broad permeation zone
between books and the interior life, convinced that literature
matters as much for what it does to us as for what it unprovably
simply is, she is the perfect broker between the claims of page and
person. As she herself writes, happy to tilt against the academic
sequestration of the "text": "... to the extent that reading is life
... to the extent that what we read is an aspect of the life we have
lived, and shapes our subsequent life, and becomes part of our memory
of the past--to that extent we should be willing to allow our
personal and historical responses to flood in and out of the books we
read."</LD>
<TE>   "Nothing Remains the Same" comprises 15 diverse reflections
on--encounters with, really--once personally influential works and
authors (and one film, Hitchcock's "Vertigo"). It is a less bounded
and more idiosyncratic version of what David Denby did for the key
books of his old college syllabus in his "Great Books."</TE>
<TE>   Lesser ranges from the canonical (Cervantes, Milton, Shakespeare)
to the more personally formative (Dodie Smith's "I Capture the
Castle" and Kingsley Amis' "Lucky Jim"), taking in Henry Adams,
George Orwell, D.H. Lawrence, Ian McEwan and a good half-dozen others
along the way. Her choices are canny, nicely balanced, allowing her
to cover a broad spectrum of ideas about the self-in-formation as
greeted by a self-(mostly)-formed. We get a gratifyingly
high-altitude sense of this writer's moral, political and sentimental
education.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is this more compellingly set out than in "A Young Woman's
Mistakes," the determinedly candid interrogation of her radically
changed responses to Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina" and George Eliot's
"Middlemarch," novels she had once inhaled as the most profound
depictions of the female heart, which now (Lesser is brave in coming
clean thus) seem seriously flawed in aspects of their presentation.
Wading in where most critics would fear to tread, she asserts: "I
don't blame Tolstoy for Anna's choices, but I do blame George Eliot
for Dorothea's; he stands, somehow, safely distant from his
characters, whereas she seems willfully, personally involved with
hers." That "willfully" is especially pointed.</TE>
<TE>   Agree or disagree, however, the reader cannot but feel that
something real is at stake here, and both masterpieces are unsettled
for a moment from the deep inertia of received opinion.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible that Lesser's disappointing re-encounters elicit
the more interesting responses, if only because they underscore more
dramatically the realities of growth and change. Of her return to
Amis' "Lucky Jim," Lesser writes: "When I was younger, all these
experiences of shame had tremendous power for me. They were linked
with, and in fact gave rise to, the uncontrollable laughter I still
associate with this book. Humiliation punctured by humor: that was
the mechanism by which 'Lucky Jim' gave me so much pleasure. But the
puncture alone survives, so the novel seems to me now like a deflated
balloon, something that was once tense with its own pressure but now
lies in a soft, wrinkled, inert heap." How much about
self-realization and retrospection--not to mention detumescence--is
condensed in those few sentences.</TE>
<TE>   If these essays have any flaw, it is that they sometimes lose that
dynamic tension between the work and the reader's life, becoming, for
pages at a stretch, merely very good literary criticism. But the
lapses into the dutiful are few and far between. There is, in almost
every case, enough personal occasion, enough sense of real reader in
real time, to pull the essays--and us--back into that zone of special
mattering that Lesser has staked out for herself.</TE>

<KH>Hershel Parker has practically reconstructed Melville's DNA

<HD>A Stoic of the Underground</HD>
<DH>HERMAN MELVILLE: A Biography, Vol. 2, 1851-1891, By Hershel
Parker, Johns Hopkins University Press: 998 pp., $45</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUGLAS BRINKLEY</AU>
<BD>Douglas Brinkley is professor of history and director
of the Eisenhower Center for American Studies at the University of
New Orleans.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's hard to know where to pin the blame. Although Herman Melville
had proudly titled his new novel "Moby-Dick," the British publishers,
for marketing reasons and without his knowledge, changed it in
November 1851 to "The Whale."</LD>
<LD>   Worse, when Melville shipped the manuscript across the Atlantic
Ocean, the last page got so smushed that it was never printed. It was
instantly an author's deepest nightmare, leading the way for
reviewers to denounce the book, calling its conclusion "hastily,
weakly and obscurely managed." In fact, it was a number of years
before British readers learned that Ishmael had survived the attack
of the white whale.</LD>
<LD>   Critical respect was impossible for Melville to achieve in his
lifetime. Because his first novels, "Typee" (1846) and "Omoo" (1847),
were deemed risque and ribald, he was pigeonholed as an adventure
writer of seafaring potboilers. The mere mention of his name in
London and New York literary circles in the 1840s conjured images of
breezy palm trees, deadly typhoons, cannibals stirring pots and naked
Polynesian women.</LD>
<TE>   The notion that he could write a novel that might equal the
stature of Charles Dickens' "Bleak House," for instance, was deemed
ludicrous, and many American newspapers, taking their intellectual
cues from London, joined the denunciation. It wasn't the story of the
white whale they objected to: It was the pages upon pages of
Melville's biblical exegesis, philosophical musings and allegorical
tricks. Even Melville's friends gossiped about his unredeemable
"failings," instead of celebrating what we now consider the soaring
triumph of "Moby-Dick."</TE>
<TE>   There was, however, one instant admirer of "Moby-Dick": Nathaniel
Hawthorne, to whom Melville had dedicated his masterpiece. "A sense
of unspeakable security is in me this moment, on account of your
having understood the book," Melville wrote to the well-respected
author of "The Scarlet Letter," upon receiving a letter of
appreciation, now lost, from Hawthorne. "You were archangel enough to
despise the imperfect body, and embrace the soul."</TE>
<TE>   The two men, who both lived near Lenox, Mass., had formed a mutual
respect society. Using the comical pseudonym "By a Virginian Spending
July in Vermont," Melville had penned a rave two-part review of
Hawthorne's "Mosses From an Old Manse" in 1846, his second collection
of stories, for the New York Literary World. Hawthorne's wife,
Sophia, catered to the often-rumpled Melville when he stopped by for
tea or supper, understanding that his wastrel demeanor was simply an
outward manifestation of his poetic inner spirit. They were, in
essence, their own Berkshires salon of three.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, as Hawthorne sat in his secluded cottage where he had
written "The House of the Seven Gables," sleet lashing against his
windowpane, inhaling every page of "Moby-Dick," he knew after only a
few chapters that it represented a revolutionary new departure from
Melville's previous books. With pen in hand, he offered to put his
considerable reputation on the line and review "Moby-Dick," bugling
to the world that Melville was a native genius.</TE>
<TE>   But Melville asked him not to. He wanted to bask in the "miserly
delight" of Hawthorne's letter; a review would only cheapen the
euphoria. "By understanding 'Moby-Dick' as a great truth-telling
allegory," one biographer wrote, "Hawthorne had proved himself the
ideal audience of one."</TE>
<TE>   That biographer, of course, is the one scholar who has
painstakingly toiled to enhance Melville's legacy: Hershel Parker,
author of "Reading 'Billy Budd,'" co-editor of the landmark 1967
Norton Critical Edition of "Moby-Dick" and author of a monumental
biography of the great 19th century writer.</TE>
<TE>   The first volume--a finalist for the 1997 Pulitzer Prize--opened
with Melville's birth in New York City in 1819 and closed in the
dining room of the Little Red Inn in Lenox in November 1851 with
Melville presenting Hawthorne with an inscribed copy of "Moby-Dick."
Now, in "Herman Melville: A Biography: Vol. 2, 1851-1891," Parker
picks up with Hawthorne reading the novel and ends with Melville's
death in New York City on Sept. 28, 1891, a neglected prophet
conscientiously revising the manuscript of "Billy Budd" with
arthritic hands while struggling to pay off debts that he had kept
hidden from his family.</TE>
<TE>   Parker is a practitioner of biography by exhaustion, for every
fact excavated about the life and times of Melville is magnified
under his microscope: the death of insignificant cousins, analysis of
reviews in uninfluential journals, the various colors of crayon
smudges on manuscripts, the family trees of fly-by-night servants.
The incessant detail of the narrative is numbing, and Melville,
unfortunately, often gets lost in this sea of thoroughness, thrown
overboard like his fictional character, Benito Cereno, and drowned in
a tidal wave of excessive trivia. But for the reader with
patience--and extra time--Parker's impressive scholarship and a
vigorous analysis are cause for celebration. Too often reviewers
misuse the word "definitive"; not so in this case. The meticulous
Parker has practically reconstructed Melville's DNA and in doing so
has rendered American literature a signal service.</TE>
<TE>   Parker recounts Melville's chronic bad luck, epic writing binges,
failed lectures, surreal visions and troubled marriage. It's a saga
of genius refusing to be derailed. But Parker unearths a plethora of
new material, including previously unknown family correspondence and
even the title and plot of Melville's long-lost novel, "The Isle of
the Cross."</TE>
<TE>   Astonishingly, we are presented for the first time with an
accurate chronology of when and where Melville wrote his books, poems
and stories. Parker also mines recently discovered volumes from
Melville's personal library, many ornamented with handwritten
commentary along the margins, and offers fresh insights about the
extraordinary breadth of his reading habits. Melville was not only an
encyclopedic reader but also an aggressive one, with fine taste in
higher literature.</TE>
<TE>   Volume 2 makes important headway in establishing two
underappreciated post-"Moby-Dick" novels as classics: "Pierre; or The
Ambiguities" (1852), an autobiographical, psychological remembrance
of growing up in New York, and "The Confidence-Man: His Masquerade"
(1857), a biting satire of American corruption set on the Mississippi
River aboard the fictional steamboat Fidele.</TE>
<TE>   Both novels have had profound effects on American culture.
"Pierre," the story of a young romantic incapacitated by
self-delusion, became a bible to Jack Kerouac and the Beat
Generation. Its hero, Pierre Glendinning, became a prototype for the
tortured mystic, "just the youth," as Parker writes, "to mistake an
intense expansion of consciousness for the attainment of true wisdom,
just the youth, suffused with acknowledged idealism and ambiguously
unacknowledged sexual desires, to dare to apply Jesus' words to
actual earthly life."</TE>
<TE>   And in "The Confidence Man," Melville conjures up a gallery of
charlatans, rogues and tricksters who transform the Father of Waters
into the Father of Lies. Their journey from St. Louis to New Orleans
is a mockery of frontier mythmaking of the Mike Fink variety. An
annoyed Mark Twain wrote "Life on the Mississippi," in part, to set
Melville straight about the virtues of steam-boating.</TE>
<TE>   When the Civil War broke out, Melville abandoned the novel in
favor of poetry. Destitution became a way of life. Struggle was all
he knew. Desperately trying to support his wife and two daughters
(one struggling with mental illness) and cope with the grief of
losing a son who died young, he searched for employment only to be
rebuffed for both a consular post and a U.S. Navy billet. Broke, he
still managed to master the great world poets, particularly
Shakespeare and Wordsworth.</TE>
<TE>   "Melville was not reading in order to acquire knowledge for its
own sake," Parker writes, "his evident purpose in reading epics of
Western Civilization was to learn how to write great poetry in his
own time." Amazingly enough, Melville succeeded: His first volume of
verse, "Battle-Pieces and Aspects of War" (1866), represents, along
with the work of Walt Whitman and James Russell Lowell, the finest
poetry written during the Civil War. (The longest poem in the first
section of "Battle-Pieces," titled "Donelson," is a lyrical gem
worthy of Robert Burns).</TE>
<TE>   But again the critics hammered away at him, including William Dean
Howells, editor of the prestigious Atlantic Monthly. "Mr. Melville's
work possesses the negative virtues of originality in such degree
that it not only reminds you of no poetry you have read, but of no
life you have known," Howells sniped. "Is it possible--you ask
yourself, after running over all these celebrative, inscriptive, and
memorial verses--that there has really been a great war, with battles
fought by men or bewailed by women? Or is it only that Mr. Melville's
inner consciousness has been perturbed, and filled with the phantasms
of enlistments, marches, fights in the air, parenthetic
bulletin-boards, and tortured humanity shedding, not words and blood,
but words alone?"</TE>
<TE>   Yet Melville persisted, publishing the extraordinary "Clarel: A
Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land" (1876), a theological
meditation reflecting his Manichean view of God and conceived during
a tour of the Middle East. Other less exemplary volumes followed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Melville evolved into a stoic of the underground,
shunning friends and shopping in the secondhand stores of Manhattan
for provisions. "Melville was living a hidden life," Parker
concludes, "what journalists a decade or so later would begin calling
a buried life, away from his old literary associates, almost lost to
fame." When he died at 72, only one newspaper wrote a meaningful
obituary.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he had reached 30, an ethereal muse had consumed
Melville, and he remained strangely untouched by the literary
conventions of his time. Abandoning the commercial success of his
early works, Melville had become a dedicated sufferer for art. As a
craftsman of what he called the "inside narrative," he surpassed
Hawthorne and went on to challenge Shakespeare, falling just short.
Carl Jung, in "The Spirit in Man, Art and Literature" (1967),
rightfully deemed "Moby-Dick" the "greatest American novel" and
explained why Melville's entire literary oeuvre offered "the richest
opportunities for psychological elucidation." There was something
ghostly or otherworldly about Melville's prose and poetry, which upon
reading often conjured a hallucinogenic effect.</TE>
<TE>   Fittingly, Parker informs us that Melville's family motto was
Denique coelum--Heaven at Last. Religious immortality, Melville
believed, could be had if he stayed truthful to his God-ordained task
of honest composition. Reading Parker's biography made me realize
that the time has come to amend Ernest Hemingway's overused dictum
that all American literature emanated from one book: "The Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn." We all know that, in truth, it came from Herman
Melville's holy and heavenly hand.</TE>

<KH>Flaubert was a perfectionist. Books were not to be written
spontaneously. Like the pyramids, they were built with a plan, stone
by stone, and that work, Flaubert insisted, was backbreaking.</KH>
<HD>A Master of the Quill</HD>
<DH>FLAUBERT: A Life, By Geoffrey Wall, Farrar, Straus &amp;
Giroux: 414 pp., $27</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTOR BROMBERT</AU>
<BD>Victor Brombert has written extensively on 19th and
20th century European literature. His memoir "Trains of Thought:
Memories of a Stateless Youth" will be published in June.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gustave Flaubert's precepts are not exactly encouraging to a
biographer. Convinced that the writer should never sing about himself
or be the subject of his works, he maintained that it was the
artist's duty to pretend that he did not exist. Only words and the
beauty of form mattered. Flaubert quipped that he was an homme-plume,
a creature of the quill, and that the only adventures in his life
were the sentences he wrote. Even his 11/2-year voyage to Egypt and
around the Middle East in the company of his friend Maxime Du Camp
was less meaningful to him than his daydreams of travel while on his
divan before and after the journey and the exotic verbal imagery into
which he translated those dreams.</LD>
<TE>   In his biography "Flaubert: A Life," Geoffrey Wall skillfully
shows what efforts went into taming these wildest yearnings and
transmuting them into worlds as different as the drab provincial
setting of "Madame Bovary" and the mystic African landscape of
"Salammbo." The truth is that Flaubert execrated "reality," even
though he became the high priest of realism. It is no doubt this
abhorrence of quotidian mediocrity that made him so sympathetic to
Emma Bovary's frustrations and aspirations. Flaubert's own quest,
however, was not for carnal entanglements but for ideal forms. His
passionate cult of Art (the word "art" is always capitalized)
required quasi-monastic dedication and sacerdotal fervor. Sustained
anger against philistine values kept him going. He claimed to love
his work the way an ascetic loves the hair shirt that scrapes his
belly.</TE>
<TE>   Flaubert claimed his ultimate ambition was to write a book "about
nothing," un livre sur rien, held together not by its subject matter
(the story of a flea could be as beautiful as the story of Alexander
the Great) but by the artificer's skill, by the coherence of its
structure and texture, by the poet's mastery of the incantatory
secrets of language. For the novelist is a poet, and a line of prose,
according to Flaubert, is as immutable as a line of poetry.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Flaubert's life was mired in distressing reality, notably in
illness--epilepsy, beginning in his early 20s, syphilis later,
painful and unsightly boils at various stages. He came to welcome the
nervous disorder that declared itself while he was a law student,
since his epileptic seizures protected him against the pressures of
his career-oriented father, who became concerned primarily about his
son's health. Wall provides a lively account of Flaubert's family
background and the setting of his childhood in the residential wing
of the Hotel-Dieu of Rouen, the hospital where his father was chief
surgeon and where the boy grew up close to the dissecting room, which
exacerbated his morbid imagination. Flaubert liked to recall that the
flies hovering around the flowers and his own face were attracted by
the smell of decay. Wall's portrait of the father is a refreshing
corrective to Jean-Paul Sartre's "The Family Idiot," which
insistently presents the father as repressive and oppressive. Dr.
Achille-Cleophas Flaubert, a venerated figure in Rouen, combined
energy, skepticism and generosity. Medicine was for him the new
religion of humanity.</TE>
<TE>   Equally satisfying is Wall's depiction of the young Flaubert's
appearance and moods as his friends might have observed them.
Unusually tall, increasingly corpulent, endowed with a stentorian
voice, a walrus mustache and an exceedingly loud laugh, he was fond
of lounging in a loose-fitting white burnoose--a hooded garment
which, in addition to allowing for comfort and a display of
"Oriental" eccentricity, corresponded to his fantasy of himself as a
monk or a hermit. Flaubert derived much pleasure from masculine
company and conversation. His friends--his mentor Alfred Le
Poittevin, his travel companion and first "editor" Du Camp, his alter
ego Louis Bouilhet and Russian novelist Ivan Turgenev--were all
subjected to his preposterous jokes, his declamatory statements, his
prolonged readings of his own manuscripts bellowed to the point of
hoarseness.</TE>
<TE>   Flaubert also displayed--especially in his writings--an
androgynous sensitivity. In an early article on "Madame Bovary,"
Baudelaire held the view that Flaubert had infused his virile blood
into Emma's veins. Sartre contended that in writing about Emma,
Flaubert disguised himself as a woman and that the result is a masked
confession. Wall judiciously links this feminine sensitivity to
Flaubert's epilepsy. His seizures were a stigma, yet they provided
the freedom to devote himself exclusively to writing, since it was
understood by his parents that he should not pursue a career.
According to Wall, the seizures also enabled him to feel an affinity
for extreme forms of psychic expressions and for the ecstatic visions
of saints and sinners he so liked to describe. Wall hypothesizes that
epilepsy allowed Flaubert to acquire a "sixth sense."</TE>
<TE>   Flaubert's writings blend surprising contradictions. His
disciplined prose and realistic settings may seem incompatible with
his quixotic enthusiasms, his taste for freaks and monsters, his
fascination with violence and mystic experiences. His hostile
attentiveness to the social and political realities of his day (the
period of Louis-Philippe, the revolution of 1848, the materialistic
and prudish regime of the Second Empire that put him on trial for the
so-called immorality of "Madame Bovary") is at first glance hard to
reconcile with his addiction to the poetry of ancient history that
led to true debauches of the imagination. He claimed to carry the
love of antiquity in his very guts.</TE>
<TE>   But these contradictions are interdependent. His erotic fantasies
are intertwined with hatred of the flesh, an awareness of the
instantaneous decay of all things, crises of abstinence and even
dreams of castration that further inflamed his senses. Masturbation,
more than a habit, became for him a metaphor for writing. Much like
Baudelaire, his contemporary, Flaubert conceived of ennui not as
ordinary boredom but as a devastating taedium vitae, a metaphysical
yawn ready to swallow the world yet betraying insatiable desires and
a longing for the inaccessible.</TE>
<TE>   Wall's biography of Flaubert, even when it deals with complex
issues, remains unpretentious. At times the tone is almost
conversational but heightened by sharp formulations. Wall writes of
Flaubert's "physiology of the imagination," pointing out that the
famous impersonality meant not self-effacement but a bewildering
self-multiplication. Flaubert was not only able to turn himself into
a frustrated, rapturous woman but also conceived of numerous
incarnations throughout his life, seeing himself in turn as a bandit,
a mule driver, an acrobat, an oriental potentate, a pirate. To George
Sand, with whom he shared (mostly by letter) an autumnal intimacy, he
confided that he dreamed of having been a monk, a soldier in the
Punic Wars, a boatman on the Nile. With all his talk of living like a
monk, Flaubert spent stretches of time in Paris, frequenting literary
friends as well as members of the Imperial family.</TE>
<TE>   The major figures in Flaubert's life, in addition to his father,
stand out clearly: the protective and possessive widowed mother
sentimentally blackmailing her son into remaining under her watch;
the ambitious, hyperactive Du Camp, with whom relations became
increasingly acrimonious; and of course Louise Colet, the invasive
mistress, haunting him with her endless grievances, whom he learned
to keep at bay by all conceivable forms of coitus interruptus  and by
sending her disquisitions on the art of writing instead of the love
letters she expected.</TE>
<TE>   At many a point, but always with taste, Wall comes up with an
especially witty turn, as when he refers to Colet's "incurably minor
poetry"; to Flaubert's life in Croisset under the wing of his
hypochondriac mother as "perpetually filial, infantile, and asexual";
to "The Temptation of Saint Anthony" as a "stubbornly amphibious
oddity" or--quite brilliantly--to the novelist's vision as focusing
"with equal acuity, at six inches, at six feet, and at infinity."</TE>
<TE>   In order not to burden the text with footnotes and elaborate
references, Wall regrettably adopts a system of endnotes that leaves
unclear at times under what circumstances and by whom certain
statements were made. Some facile psychologizing might also have been
avoided. It is not very helpful to learn that a given passage from a
letter seems to jump "straight out of the unconscious," that there is
an "unconscious meaning" to the father accidentally burning Gustave's
writing hand with boiling water or that "looking for the Mother" was
the novelist's great erotic theme. Fortunately, Wall indulges only
sporadically in similar affirmations.</TE>
<TE>   More debatable is the underplaying of Flaubert's juvenilia. It is
true that Sartre read too much into those early exercises. Yet they
are revealing. "November" and "Sentimental Education" are now studied
in the classroom. As for "The Temptation of Saint Anthony," it surely
will not do to dismiss it as an "extravagant impasse" when Flaubert,
between 1848 and 1874, reworked three versions and was clearly
obsessed with its images and themes. Baudelaire, upon reading some
fragments published in 1856, immediately recognized that this
dazzling, disquieting text was the secret chamber of Flaubert's mind.
It is in fact a compendium of motifs projecting the central feature
of bovarysm, a craving for the impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Flaubert was a perfectionist. His intransigent refusal to publish
anything that did not satisfy him is summed up in a reply to Du Camp
that Wall does well to quote: "May I die like a dog rather than try
to rush through even one sentence before it is perfectly ripe." Books
were not to be written spontaneously. Like the pyramids, they were
built with a plan, stone by stone, and that work, Flaubert insisted,
was backbreaking. Ultimately, however, it was not so much the pangs
of Art that filled him with awe. It was the tragic sense of being
trapped between the difficulty of using words and the ineffable
experience that can never be rendered by language. This struggle with
language and the nature of the unsayable is at the core of Flaubert's
modernity.</TE>

<KH>'The Black Veil' is less bloodletting than blood sport, with
Moody playing hunter and prey.</KH>
<HD>Night and Fog</HD>
<DH>THE BLACK VEIL: A Memoir With Digressions, By Rick Moody,
Little, Brown: 326 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS CURWEN</AU>
<BD>Thomas Curwen is deputy editor of Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The world is awash in blood, not the blood of war or civil strife but
the blood of writers eager to tell the story of their lives. Incest,
poverty, discrimination, death, disease, depression and addiction are
worthy subjects, but confession comes too easy nowadays, and memoir
too often an excuse to open the floodgates of the artistic life.</LD>
<LD>   No wonder then that a writer as talented as Rick Moody would try a
different route when chronicling his journey in "The Black Veil," a
journey that is less bloodletting than blood sport, with Moody
playing hunter and prey. While the unrepressed word-slinging and slow
evisceration of suburban lifestyles that he showed in "The Ice Storm"
and "Purple America" are in full glory here, his personal story of
despair, self-loathing, bourbon and pills takes center stage.</LD>
<TE>   Moody's road to confession begins with a small family story: When
Nathaniel Hawthorne penned "The Minister's Black Veil" in 1835, he
drew upon an anecdote from the life of a clergyman from York, Maine,
who one day greeted his congregation with a veil covering his face.
This poor soul was Joseph Moody, rumored to be a distant relation,
and was for Rick as a teen a certain claim to coolness. Yet when he
entered the make-it-or-break-it years of young adulthood, the
connection proved more ominous. Was Joseph really kin? Why did he
wear the veil? Could the family be afflicted with some
intergenerational disorder of disgrace and shame that he, somehow,
contracted?</TE>
<TE>   The answers, laid out in this "memoir with digressions," come in
the form of a postmodern mix, spiriting Thomas Browne and Hawthorne,
Dave Eggers and David Foster Wallace together with Moody's own brand
of humor and irony. If the result--part psychological and
genealogical inquisition, part literary criticism, pop cultural
exploration and historical exegesis--is a little ungainly, and
assuredly it is, Moody gives fair warning.</TE>
<TE>   "Readers in search of a tidy well-organized life in these pages, a
life of kisses bestowed or of novels written, may be surprised," he
writes early on. "My book and my life are written in fits, more like
epilepsy than like a narrative; or: the process of this work is
obsessive and like all obsessions is protean, beginning with the
burden of conscience ...."</TE>
<TE>   Protean epileptic obsessions aside, when a writer thrusts a pen
beneath the skin, certain expectations must be met. There ought to be
some pain. Not to say there can't be humor, but pain--either real or
revelatory--must be evident. And local color, or the whole venture
slips into a slough of solipsistic narcissism. And coherence:
Meaning--or the struggle for meaning--should come clear in the
structure of the story. In the case of "The Black Veil," two out of
three isn't quite enough.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's pain began with his parents' divorce in 1970, an event
which we are led to believe precipitated his depression and a steady
haze of soddenness that culminated on Christmas 1986, the nadir of
his young life.</TE>
<TE>   "Of dinner, I remember only the moment in which I boasted that I
would not be alive on New Year's Day, 2000," he writes, a blithe
claim that hides the very real knot of paranoia, morbid thinking and
tunnel vision in which he found himself inextricably entangled.</TE>
<TE>   " ... I slumped further into the cave dwelling part of my back
brain. The lonely villain in a monster movie, a suzerain of
reclusion, drinking, loathing myself, going out and feeling afraid,
cynical, contemptuous, literally disgusted by my own shadow, by
everything that had to do with me.... "</TE>
<TE>   After checking himself in and out of a rehabilitation center in
Queens, he goes on a driving trip with his father to "the ragged,
fierce, melancholy coast of Maine," where he hopes to seek out
whatever connection exists between who he is and his 18th century
doppelganger, Joseph Moody. It rains the entire week, but along the
way he learns a thing or two about his family history.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Moody, it turns out, led an impossibly difficult life in
the shadow of his father, a fire-and-brimstone preacher, and suffered
a string of tragedies. As a child, he was charged with the accidental
shooting death of a childhood friend and, later, after enduring a
bout of unrequited love and a settling of sorts in marriage, he ended
up burying his wife and child, both of whom died in childbirth: the
culmination of which led--or so we are meant to believe--to the
famous veiling.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's journey--and his book--begins promisingly but ends in a
swirl of tangential references and biographical facts of interest
only if you happen to be a Moody and are interested in the etymology
of the family name or in a relative's contribution to the
construction of Boston's South Station (taking in the finer points of
New England marble quarrying) or in a contemporary's lurching
Goth-like into a Wal-Mart in order to purchase a bolt of fabric to
stitch a veil for himself.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Moody exhumes the work of such disparate critics as
F.O. Matthiessen and Roland Barthes, weaves in accounts of 18th and
19th century village life and incorporates modern studies of
impulsivity, courtesy of Kip Kinkel, the high-school shooter from
Springfield, Ore., and William Burroughs, who shot his wife one
afternoon in a drunken game of William Tell.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most discouraging, he reveals that the thread
connecting him to Joseph is more imaginary than real, a revelation
that turns the promise of this story into nothing more than a ruse
which no amount of spin can redeem.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, "The Black Veil" only marginally delivers on the terms
Moody establishes. Although his writing, wit and knowledge remain
wonderfully intact, his larger ambition--an attempt, it seems, to
draw parallels between life in colonial America and life in the
Republic today--becomes a mere projection of his own self-loathing, a
Jonathan Edwards-like rant against demons of his own design.</TE>
<TE>   The fog finally lifts in Moody's life when he sells his second
novel, "The Ice Storm," a conclusion which, as honest as it may be,
diminishes the scope of his story and the deeper implications of his
travail. Occasionally wonderful and intriguing, more often unruly and
maddening, "The Black Veil" disappointingly collapses under its own
undisciplined scheme.</TE>

<LD>THE LITTLE FIELD OF THE SELF</LD>
<LD>   By Doreen Gildroy</LD>
<LD>   University of Chicago Press:</LD>
<TE>   72 pp., $28</TE>
<TE>   Doreen Gildroy's first book, "The Little Field of the Self," has
the feel of a very private miracle. The sense of self-containment in
these poems is steady and enlightened. Each poem seems to quietly
dare itself to go on: then goes on, shifting out of intention into a
confident unornamented eloquence. "A condition of unmoved calm" is a
phrase she borrows from the ancient philosopher Plotinus, as her own
"calm" deepens into unswerving emotion by listening to itself, to its
own rapt language.</TE>
<TE>   In the garden the cut stalks</TE>
<TE>   feel the wind and</TE>
<TE>   have no resistance to it, moving</TE>
<TE>   and being moved again.</TE>
<TE>   These poems (coalescing into one long poem) are set in Brittany,
France, in a castle with a moat guarded by quacking ducks and geese
as well as a fairy tale forest, yet they never seem "staged." The
serene gravity of this debut collection is attended by a sense of
enchantment so convincing that the poems, like a tapestry, come alive
as both the subject and object of desire.</TE>
<TE>   We are privileged to behold the Land and the Unicorn here in one
hypnotic raveling and unraveling skein, a word whose double meaning
(either a bundle of thread or a flock of geese in flight) suggests
the kind of delicately spun spell Gildroy casts. Beneath the mirror
surface of her ruminations, archetypal shapes gather power, and the
reader gazes, rapt, at the luminous and riveting field of the poet's
self.</TE>

<TE>   NECESSITY</TE>
<TE>   By Peter Sacks</TE>
<TE>   W.W. Norton: 96 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   Peter Sacks, in his fifth collection of poems, "Necessity," also
meditates on Plotinus: "... one must oneself become Spirit, and
oneself become vision." According to Plotinus, the Soul can apprehend
the world only successively and severally, thus creating time and
space. Sacks' attenuated, beautifully hesitant style consciously
re-creates this limitation of Soul, through a profoundly mimetic
sense of the illusions of time and space.</TE>
<TE>   The poems in "Necessity" spare themselves little. Sacks begins his
"apprehension" of the so-called knowable world in his native South
Africa, tracking its fierce beauty and conflict; moving on to
contemporary America and its moral chaos--letting all of damaged
reality think and rethink its own Mind:</TE>
<TE>   Wind, work, mockery--</TE>
<TE>   a ribbon of stiff dirt laid to one side where hardpan broke.</TE>
<TE>   The racket clatters on. The god terms change. The images of mind.</TE>
<TE>   And farther on, with startling lyrical precision:</TE>
<TE>   Who'll toss the boy a coin? This far</TE>
<TE>   from where we should have given up--</TE>
<TE>   thunder &amp; a hundred miles</TE>
<TE>   of uncut grasses swaying in the memory of rain.</TE>
<TE>   Those "uncut grasses swaying" are as real and as illusory as the
sense of justice toward which these poems gravitate in their torn
beauty. "Necessity," as the ancient texts tell us, "knows no law" and
is blind into the bargain. It is no accident that the last lines of
this masterful book cry out to an eyeless, unheeding god.</TE>

<TE>   HIP LOGIC</TE>
<TE>   By Terrance Hayes</TE>
<TE>   Penguin: 96 pp., $16 paper</TE>
<TE>   Terrance Hayes is a difficult poet to describe, and "Hip Logic" is
a book like no other. Hayes' attentiveness to the material world is
as arresting and acute as his liftoffs into abstraction. The solemn
open mouth of an infant is as exact and as exacting an image for the
poet as his more fanciful and phenomenological task: "like trying/to
slow light down to a trot."</TE>
<TE>   "Hip Logic," Hayes' second book, is congratulated, in a press
release, for confronting "racism, sexism, religion, family structure
and stereotypes," and it does all that. But it also documents such a
visceral and brainy delight in language that the human political
issues represented here are even more dramatically compelling to the
reader:</TE>
<TE>   Some cruise with detachable faces</TE>
<TE>   on their radios. The grief latent</TE>
<TE>   in speed limits and zip codes.</TE>
<TE>   The evening between evenings.</TE>
<TE>   Stalls with locked doors.</TE>
<TE>   Some leave their car windows</TE>
<TE>   cracked &amp; a boomboomboom</TE>
<TE>   rustles the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes uses the classic villanelle form ("Broken Dangerfield Newby
Villanelle") to write movingly of Dangerfield Newby, one of the five
black men involved in John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry. He also
plays linguistic games, words inside words, in a most clever series
of poem-puzzles.</TE>
<TE>   His range, like his original music, is that of a bold virtuoso and
a fearless chronicler of character: Big Bird, Paul Robeson and
Balthus all sound off in these revelatory poems. Whether hip or
Horatian, the imaginative logic in these poems is irrefutable.</TE>

<DH>EYE OF THE ALBATROSS: Visions of Hope and Survival, By Carl
Safina, John Macrae / Henry Holt: 380 pp., $27.50</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD ELLIS</AU>
<BD>Richard Ellis is the author, most recently, of
"Aquagenesis: The Origin and Evolution of Life in the Sea."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine you are a wandering albatross. You are the largest of all
flying birds, with wings that span more than 12 feet. You can walk on
land; you can swim and dive, and you can fly, so you are numbered
among the few creatures that are at home in all the elements that
wild animals inhabit.</LD>
<LD>   But it is your flying ability that sets you apart. You are the
uncontested master of the air, able to fly and navigate for thousands
of miles at a time and return unerringly to the island where you were
born. You do not power your way through the air but glide on unseen
air currents that no other creature on Earth understands and uses as
well as you do. You are not migratory like the terns and shearwaters
that fly from high northern to high southern latitudes every year,
but you and your mate regularly travel halfway around the world in
search of food for yourself and your chick.</LD>
<LD>   In "Eye of the Albatross," Carl Safina saves you the trouble of
this imagining, tracking--as he does--Amelia, a female Laysan
albatross who leaves her chick on Tern Island, a lonely outpost in
the northwest Hawaiian chain, and flies purposefully across the North
Pacific to find food for her nestling:</LD>
<TE>   "An hour after Amelia leaves, the last visual trace of French
Frigate Shoals falls away behind her. She makes no note of it--as you
make no note of leaving sight of your house when you run an errand.
She sees herself neither as heroic nor hard-working. Nor does she
have any other abstract concept. She has only purpose to hunt and she
is keenly aware of that. And like any animal, like us when we travel,
she knows where she is relative to home. But she has no visual
markers on the ever-shifting ocean. Her mental map is not like yours.
Her brain contains a compass--yours doesn't--and a clock as accurate
as your internal clock, which she pays more attention to. And of
course, she has those wings. Albatrosses usually spend 80 to 90
percent of their time at sea flying, day and night."</TE>
<TE>   Writers choose their subjects for myriad reasons; but in this
case, the reason is obvious: Safina is in love with albatrosses. To
him, they not only represent the magnificence of nature but are also,
as the book's subtitle tells us, "visions of hope and survival."</TE>
<TE>   The mythology of the albatross precedes Safina's book. The poet
Samuel Taylor Coleridge in "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" pins the
drama of this epic poem--the curse of the mariner--on the shooting of
an albatross. Killing this bird was long rumored to result in a loss
of wind and has become a symbol of inevitable misfortune. As penance
for his crime, the mariner is condemned to wear the albatross tied
from his neck, which would be most inconvenient, considering the
bird's enormous wingspan and a body that weighs 25 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   But not all albatrosses are this large, nor is "Eye of the
Albatross" about every species of the bird (and there are many
species, most of which live in the Southern Hemisphere). Albatrosses
in flight are heart-stoppingly beautiful, and they often follow ships
in graceful swoops and soaring arcs, but to study them, researchers
have to visit their remote islands. Safina pays closest attention to
birds like Amelia and other Laysan and Black-footed albatrosses that
nest in the mid-Pacific at breeding grounds like Tern Island.</TE>
<TE>   All is not well, he reports, with albatrosses. Like many of the
magnificent creatures of this planet, they have paid the price of
mankind's rapaciousness and environmental negligence. One species,
known as the short-tailed albatross, is one of the rarest birds in
the world, having been killed in astonishing numbers during the last
century by Japanese plume hunters. (One of the greatest thrills I
ever had was watching a short-tail circle our ship when we were
sailing in the Kurile Islands, north of Japan, last year.)</TE>
<TE>   Through Safina (and Amelia), we get a sense of the profound
importance and interrelatedness of the world's life forms. Naturalist
Henry Beston was not writing of albatrosses, but he might as well
have been when he wrote in "The Outermost House":</TE>
<TE>   "For the animal shall not be measured by man. In a world older and
more complete than ours, they move more finished and complete, gifted
with the extension of the senses we have lost or never attained,
living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren, they are
not underlings; they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the
net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendor and travail of
the earth."</TE>
<TE>   Safina's writing is equal to the subject, and the subject is the
most magnificent of all flying creatures, soaring, gliding, diving
and hunting over the wide ocean, as sure of its destination as Safina
is sure of the mot juste. About Amelia he writes, "When the wind
returns, she sets her wings and, without anything perceivable as a
bodily movement, continues for another hundred miles, flying in long
undulations on the propellant energy of the breeze."</TE>
<TE>   Safina has become the poet laureate of things oceanic. In his
previous book, "Song for the Blue Ocean," he brought to our
attention--painfully but beautifully--the plight of some of the
world's endangered fish. From the oceans' depths, he now takes wing.
In the albatross triumphant, Safina sees nothing less than the
salvation of the planet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `Eye of the Albatross'</TE>
<TE>   An albatross is a great symphony of flesh, perception, bone, and
feathers, composed of long movements and set to ever-changing rhythms
of light, wind, water. The almost overwhelming musicality of an
albatross in air derives not just from the bird itself but from the
contrapuntal suite of action and inaction from which this creature
composes flight. It drifts in the atmosphere at high speed, but
itself remains immobile--an immense bird holding stock-still yet
shooting through the wind. Just as individual notes become music by
relationship to other notes, the bird's stillness becomes movement by
context. Following your traveling ship with ease, watching you,
circling stern to prow and back at will, it flies with scarcely a
flinch, skimming wave upon wave, mile after mile. Watching it, you
invariably wonder, How can it do that?</TE>

<KH>Joseph Frank makes it possible to appreciate the

<HD>The Agony and the Ecstasy</HD>
<DH>DOSTOEVSKY: The Mantle of the Prophet, 1871-1881, By Joseph
Frank, Princeton University Press: 784 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DONALD FANGER</AU>
<BD>Donald Fanger is the author of "The Creation of Nikolai
Gogol" and "Dostoevsky and Romantic Realism" and is at work on a book
about Maxim Gorky and on a novel. He is Harry Levin Research
Professor of Literature at Harvard University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Monumental" and "magisterial" are words that have surfaced
repeatedly in response to Joseph Frank's Dostoevsky project, the
first four volumes of which appeared in 1976, 1983, 1986 and 1995.
Now the largest volume, "The Mantle of the Prophet, 1871-1881,"
covering the last decade of the writer's life, completes the series.
Frank's work is, as reviewers (myself among them) have consistently
testified, unrivaled in what it sets out to do and in the remarkable
degree to which it succeeds in doing it.</LD>
<LD>   It is unquestionably the fullest, most nuanced and evenhanded--not
to mention the most informative--account of its subject in any
language, and it has significantly changed our understanding of both
the man and his work.</LD>
<LD>   Frank's originality lies in the way he manages to chart, at the
same time, the evolution of Dostoevsky the man, of Dostoevsky the
writer, of the writings themselves and--perhaps most original--of the
changing times that did so much to shape all three. Frank writes as a
biographer, literary historian, critic and historian of 19th century
Russian culture in the belief that only such a multi-pronged approach
can yield a proper appreciation of the art that is Dostoevsky's first
and ultimate claim on our attention.</LD>
<TE>   What is unprecedented in these volumes, apart from the wealth of
detail, is Frank's perception, as he puts it in his preface, that
Dostoevsky's great novels bring into focus all the problems of
mid-19th century Russian culture--"not, to be sure, on the level on
which they ordinarily appeared to his contemporaries, but
transforming them in terms of his own eschatological and messianic
vision." The creative process may be fated to remain a mystery on its
intimate side, but Frank shows just how much illumination can come
from studying the kinds of transformation he speaks of here.</TE>
<TE>   The Dostoevsky who emerges from the pages of Frank's earlier
volumes is a man strikingly less eccentric and extreme than he has
usually been taken to be. By toning him down, Frank was clearly
trying to combat some crude cliches about his unbalanced genius. But
one result was to make Dostoevsky's circumstances more vivid than his
personality or temperament.</TE>
<TE>   Now, perhaps in tacit acknowledgment that this may have introduced
another kind of imbalance, Frank shows a constant readiness to
"acknowledge the intemperance that so often overcame him when his
nerves were frayed," his "prickliness of character" ("well known and
ill-famed"), his "sudden explosions of uncontrollable rage," the fact
that he was not "an easy person to live with under any
circumstances." More than that, Frank now volunteers judgments:
"Dostoevsky could be unpardonably rude"; a "vicious" remark about his
rival Turgenev is "slanderous and totally unjustified," showing
"Dostoevsky at his worst"; while a reference to expatriate liberals
contains "what can only be considered an unworthy taunt."</TE>
<TE>   But there is worse. In the period covered by this book, Dostoevsky
became a public figure, making speeches, pouring out a stream of
highly personal journalism in his "Diary of a Writer," setting forth
an ecstatic vision of Russia as the only bulwark against godless
modernity and the Russian people as the only repository of authentic
Christianity, destined to bring a new order of love and brotherhood
to the inferior peoples of the world (by force of arms, if
necessary).</TE>
<TE>   The problem for Frank (and for any admirer of Dostoevsky) is that
this passionate utopianism carried with it a no less passionate
xenophobia, a hatred that, as Frank notes, "extended to every people
not of Great Russian origin and is most obvious"--that is,
virulent--"in relation to the Jews."</TE>
<TE>   Frank devotes a lot of uneasy attention to this problem.
Anti-Semitic references, he finds, appear occasionally in the earlier
novels, but Frank calls them "not particularly abusive if judged by
the standards of his time and place." He even tries hard to come up
with excuses for the casually contemptuous treatment of the Jewish
fireman who witnesses Svidrigailov's suicide in "Crime and
Punishment."</TE>
<TE>   But the personal loathing for the Jews that erupted in the 1870s
is something else. Dostoevsky now took every opportunity to rant
against "Yids" and "Yiddism" and to excoriate "the crowd of
triumphant Jews and kikes that has thrown itself on Russia."</TE>
<TE>   Quoted at length in Frank's pages, this anti-Semitic frenzy makes
hard and repulsive reading, and Frank can offer no explanation beyond
conjecturing that Dostoevsky may have needed to find a scapegoat "for
the disappointments, frustrations and social-economic upheavals that
had plunged Russian life into turmoil since the liberation of the
serfs." Repeatedly he brands it as shocking and inexcusable, but he
adamantly avoids treating it as integral to Dostoevsky's character or
temperament (he does the same with what he calls Dostoevsky's
"gambling mania"), concluding only that it leaves "a permanent stain
on his reputation."</TE>
<TE>   What is most interesting, and newest, in this volume is the
picture Frank gives of other changes in the writer and in the Russian
society that he depicted and hoped so much to influence. Central here
were changing beliefs in the new cohort of young radicals, changes
that made it possible for Dostoevsky to assume the mantle of the
prophet. Although, only a decade before, radical young people had
rejected moral and ethical considerations in the name of
"science"--think of Turgenev's Bazarov in "Fathers and Children"--now
they were being swept up into the Populist movement and "going to the
people" to bring enlightenment.</TE>
<TE>   This amounted to a reinstatement of moral and ethical
considerations; it meant, as Frank puts it, that Socialism was once
again--as in the days of Dostoevsky's own youthful radicalism--being
regarded as the realization of the ideals of Christ on Earth. Here
was a position with which the writer could once again sympathize, as
was the Populist reverence for the Russian peasantry.</TE>
<TE>   It was on the strength of these shared beliefs that he was able to
find an audience among the younger generation and to gain (despite
the reactionary nature of many of his political beliefs) a unique
position in the life of his country. That he was a bundle of the most
startling contradictions only served to underline his independence.
It was, Frank contends, a broad public that read the monthly
installments of his "Diary of a Writer" (despite the fact that its
circulation seems to have stayed under 1,000).</TE>
<TE>   In it they found provocative treatments of the questions of the
day interspersed with literary reminiscences and short fictions.
Everybody could find something to sympathize with as well as to
reject in him. After all, this was the man who had suffered eight
years of prison and exile for his earlier radicalism. Besides,
whatever else one might say, he was a great novelist and passionately
concerned with the fate of Russia and Russians.</TE>
<TE>   Frank is very good on the "Diary," citing both its appealing and
appalling aspects and noting how many of the themes Dostoevsky first
broached in it would go into "The Brothers Karamazov," where their
being incarnated by the vivid characters rendered them more
problematic, more agonistic and thus less stark and unpalatable.
(Dostoevsky seems to have realized this at least partially. In a
self-justifying letter, he appeals not to the nature of art but to
the shortcomings of readers, claiming that any bald statement of
anyone's basic beliefs would be taken as ludicrous: "Generally
speaking, man doesn't like the ultimate word"--full, explicit
candor--"in anything.")</TE>
<TE>   Frank is, if anything, even better on Dostoevsky's art in this
period. He explains the relative failure of "A Raw Youth" as a
consequence of the writer's self-censorship once he had agreed to
publish it in the leading Populist journal, whose readership he
wished to court. And he gives discerning readings of a handful of
shorter works. But the centerpiece is what he does not hesitate to
call Dostoevsky's greatest novel, "The Brothers Karamazov."</TE>
<TE>   Devoting some 200 pages to this novel, Frank details its evolution
in masterly fashion, citing letters and notes to clarify the writer's
intentions and showing how the book refracts all his major
preoccupations--the conflict between reason and Christian faith, the
weakening of the family, the untenability (as he saw it) of moral
standards once divorced from religious belief.</TE>
<TE>   In his patient analysis of the text, book by book, Frank
demonstrates repeatedly how it embodies the novelist's conviction
that conveying his sense of reality required not just "realistic"
detail and not just social and psychological accuracy but the
irradiation of all by some transcendent ideal. Frank is acute in
pointing out what I would call Dostoevsky's use of concentricities,
the way he refracts "a thematic motif through a succession of
characters, each of whom expresses a different aspect or level of its
meaning."</TE>
<TE>   And he dispels, once and for all, the common misunderstanding of
what makes suffering a positive moral value for Dostoevsky: It was a
value for him if and only if it came from "an inner wrestling with
the self."</TE>
<TE>   Three months after completing this novel, Dostoevsky, who had long
suffered from emphysema, died peacefully in his sleep. His funeral
was like nothing Russia had ever seen. Fifteen choirs and some 30,000
mourners from the most disparate levels of society made up the
cortege. Frank's story concludes on a note of triumph, stressing how,
after a decade of being constantly in the public eye, Dostoevsky had
finally become "a revered, symbolic figure who seemed to stand above
the merciless battle of ideologies."</TE>
<TE>   That Frank does not indicate how briefly that moment was to last
is a reminder of the exclusions that are the price of his
achievement. He makes it possible to appreciate, as never before, the
accomplishments of Dostoevsky in his time and place, but there is
scarcely a word about his posthumous life in Russia or outside it.
Frank gives a vivid sense of the odds Dostoevsky overcame, what he
struggled with, the unique cultural phenomenon he became (and not
only as a writer of fiction), but he pays virtually no attention to
what we don't know (and want to know) about Dostoevsky (and his
characters).</TE>
<TE>   When dealing with matters of this kind, common sense gets you only
so far. There is too little darkness in Frank's picture. He seems
determined to deny intractable mystery in the books or in their
author, just as he shows scant interest in the ways that art
regularly transcends specifiable intention.</TE>
<TE>   The magisterial tone turns Olympian at times, dismissing unnamed
critics whose arguments are deplored but not considered. Russian
words are flaunted unnecessarily (and not always correctly) in the
text. The author of this imposing work, in short, is human: Small
wonder that he has left parts of the Dostoevsky puzzle intact.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Mantle of the Prophet'</TE>
<TE>   The last ten years of Dostoevsky's life ... mark the end of an
extraordinary literary career and of a life that touched both the
heights and depths of Russian society. It became customary during
these years, even among people who disagreed (and sometimes quite
violently) with Dostoevsky on social-political issues, to regard him
with a certain reverence, and to feel that his words incarnated a
prophetic vision illuminating Russia and its destiny. ... The
unprecedented stature he attained astonished even his friends and
admirers, and transcended all personal and political boundaries. In
the eyes of the vast majority of the literate public, he became a
living symbol of all the suffering that history had imposed on the
Russian people, as well as of all their longing for an ideal world of
(Christian) brotherly love and harmony.</TE>

<DH>FIRE LOVER: A True Story,  By Joseph Wambaugh, William
Morrow: 338 pp., $25.95</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Capt. John Orr of the Glendale Fire Department was one of the most
respected arson investigators in Southern California. He wrote
articles and organized seminars to train others in his specialty. If
a fire broke out in any neighboring city, odds were that Orr would
arrive to videotape it. Colleagues were amazed at his ability to
"drive up, gaze at the area, stroke his mustache, and, like a water
seeker with a divining rod, say, 'I believe the point of origin is
... there.' "</LD>
<LD>   As Joseph Wambaugh describes in his true-crime account, "Fire
Lover," Orr "would go to where he'd pointed and find the remnants of
an incendiary device under a rock." His fellow investigators "felt
like applauding."</LD>
<LD>   The applause faltered when Orr came under suspicion of setting the
fires himself--indeed, for being, in the words of an FBI profiler,
"probably the most prolific American arsonist of the 20th century."</LD>
<TE>   Year after year, Orr set brush fires in the hills around Glendale,
including the College Hills blaze in 1990 that damaged or destroyed
67 homes. He attended arson conferences in Fresno and San Luis
Obispo, setting strings of fires in towns en route, driving so fast
that investigators who later tailed him to see if he would repeat
such crimes were comically unable to keep pace.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 10, 1984, at what was then Ole's Home Center in South
Pasadena, Orr's fiery touch turned deadly. He left one of his
trademark 15-minute delay devices--a cigarette, a rubber band, three
paper matches and a sheet of notebook paper--in a display of
petroleum-based foam plastic products, knowing they were as flammable
as gasoline. Orr would do the same at other stores, but this time,
when the cigarette burned down and ignited the matches, the explosive
flames outraced fleeing clerks and customers. Four people died,
including a 2-year-old boy.</TE>
<TE>   Wambaugh, famed for his police novels, including "The Blue Knight"
and "The Choirboys," and nonfiction crime books, including "The Onion
Field," follows the case all the way from the Ole's fire to January
of this year, when Orr, serving a life sentence for murder, lost his
final appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "Fire Lover" tackles several questions: What kind of man is Orr?
How could he betray his fellow firefighters? How could an arsonist as
clever as he was be caught? How could an arsonist as flagrant and
compulsive as he was not be caught for so long? Finally, how did
prosecutors convict him for the Ole's fire, which had been declared
accidental by Los Angeles County investigators?</TE>
<TE>   The weakness of the true-crime genre is that, no matter how
spectacular the crime may be, the criminal is usually a sociopath,
lacking basic human equipment (such as a conscience) and therefore
less, not more, interesting than the rest of us. This is partly true
of Orr. A risk junkie, he was married four times and was a serial
womanizer. He'd wanted to be a police officer but was rejected by the
LAPD and later by the county fire department. Embittered, he loved
setting fires under those agencies' noses.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for Wambaugh and the reader, Orr also proved to be
quirky. As the College Hills fire raged out of control, he returned
to warn the very people he'd endangered, as if he had a split
personality. He even wrote a novel, "Points of Origin," in which a
good firefighter unmasks an arsonist colleague. It described a fire
much like the one at Ole's and gave the prosecution many of its
leads.</TE>
<TE>   Wambaugh's theme throughout is the "Balkanization ... of American
law enforcement"--the inability or unwillingness of federal and state
prosecutors, or of firefighters and cops, to communicate. A
Bakersfield arson investigator, Marv Casey--ironically a former
student of Orr's--broke the case by finding Orr's fingerprint on a
half-burned incendiary device, but nothing was done about it for
years. Cops didn't take police work by firefighters seriously. Many
firefighters refused to believe that Orr could be guilty.</TE>
<TE>   The federal arson case and the state murder case against Orr
dragged on through the 1990s. Wambaugh does his best to cut through
the legalese and enliven the courtroom proceedings with sardonic
humor, but the second half of "Fire Lover" remains less compelling
than the first, when Orr is still at large, setting more fires on the
Ole's pattern for no reason other than to make a "statement to the
entire arson investigating community--that they had got it wrong the
first time."</TE>

<LD>To the editor:</LD>
<LD>   In his review of Kevin Phillips' "Wealth and Democracy" (Book
Review, May 19), Paul Kennedy repeats a quotation included in the
book, allegedly by Abraham Lincoln: "[A]s a result of the war,
corporations have been enthroned, and an era of corruption in high
places will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor
to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the
people...."</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy finds it "stunning" to hear Lincoln sounding "eerily like
George McGovern or Ralph Nader." He might be less stunned if he knew
that the quotation is false.</LD>
<TE>   Though widely repeated under the rubric "Lincoln Prophecy," the
quotation was in fact invented during the 1896 presidential election
to bolster the socialist agenda of William Jennings Bryan. Lincoln's
private secretary, John G. Nicolay, declared the quotation a "bold,
unblushing forgery."</TE>
<TE>   Like Bryan before him, Mr. Phillips wants to invoke the moral
authority of the Great Emancipator for his liberal economic agenda
and, like Bryan, seems none too fussy about the truth. The real
Lincoln, however, stood for "free soil, free labor, and free men"
and, one might add, free markets. He would be appalled at Phillips'
crude anti-capitalism and politics of envy.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kennedy replies:</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Phillips invokes the Lincoln quote in his foreword, so there
was no footnote reference to check. Phillips builds a lot of his
argument upon the fact that present-day Republicans are deviating
from a glorious past. I happen to believe that the present gaps
between the super-rich and the average American are pretty
disgusting, but one doesn't need a faulty quotation to say that.</TE>

<HD>History 101 Lite</HD>
<DH>A SHORT HISTORY OF THE WORLD, By Geoffrey Blainey, Ivan R.
Dee: 466 pp., $27.50</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM H. McNEILL</AU>
<BD>William H. McNeill is the author of several books,
including "Plagues and Peoples" and "A History of the Human
Community: 1500 to the Present."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"In human history, almost nothing is preordained."</LD>
<LD>   These closing words of Geoffrey Blainey's "A Short History of the
World" seem to have guided him in compiling its 31 chapters. Each
chapter is an essay in itself, often slenderly connected to its
fellows, and many chapters mingle familiar and unfamiliar information
about different peoples in different parts of the world. The result
is a sometimes interesting, sometimes disappointing miscellany about
the human past.</LD>
<LD>   Any attempt at writing world history obviously must somehow select
from overabundant data. Blainey explains his approach, as follows: "I
was conscious from an early stage of the danger of making the book
too compressed, of trying to pack in too much. I began to realize
that I was leading the readers on a long journey, parts of which had
to be made with speed--otherwise the destination would never be
reached. On the other hand the journey occasionally had to be slowed
down so that readers could look about them and savor a scene or
milestone in the history of the human race.</LD>
<TE>   "By design," he continues, "the book therefore is a mixture of
fast movement and short periods of rest and meditation. Some of these
pauses I wrote in advance.... Among such episodes are the European
man who died about 5,000 years ago and was recently found in Alpine
ice, still clothed and remarkably preserved; the way of life of the
early Maoris of New Zealand; the influence of the Indian indigo plant
on the color blue; the brides sacrificed in the rushing waters of the
Yellow River in ancient China; Abraham Lincoln preparing to give his
famous speech at Gettysburg; the strange death of the composer
Tchaikovsky in tsarist Russia; the signing of the peace on the deck
of an American battleship in Tokyo harbor in 1945."</TE>
<TE>   This list illustrates the range of Blainey's interests and
sensibilities and suggests the cabinet of curiosities with which he
decorates his chapters. I for one did not know, for example, that
Cardinal John Henry Newman wrote "Lead, kindly Light" after surviving
a nasty Mediterranean storm; that Isaac Newton died at a ripe old age
with all but one of his teeth and without needing to use spectacles;
or that the Burmese drew petroleum for household lighting from
shallow wells decades before 1859, when drilling in Pennsylvania
inaugurated the modern oil industry.</TE>
<TE>   Blainey is an Australian and, in an earlier book, "The Tyranny of
Distance" (1966), he analyzed the influence of geographical isolation
on Australian history. He remains acutely aware of geography in "A
Short History of the World," and he pays special attention to the
diffusion of domesticated plants and animals, as well as diseases,
together with human migration: All are factors of key importance for
Australia's history.</TE>
<TE>   Blainey's Down Under viewpoint also induces him to treat the
history of Southeast Asia, Australasia and the Pacific Islands more
fully than others usually do. Even so, he betrays occasional
carelessness, giving two dates for the introduction of rice into
Japan; claiming that maize "originated independently both in South
America and in Mexico"; and saying that cotton found its way to India
from Mexico, where it was cultivated as early as 6000 BC in one
passage and later declaring that it was probably first cultivated
(some 3,000 years subsequently) in India.</TE>
<TE>   An attractive feature of Blainey's book is his sensitivity to the
sensory experience of pre-industrial, pre-urban populations. He
devotes two persuasive chapters to this theme. In Chapter 4, "The
Dome of Night," he samples the portentous meanings attached to
lightning, shooting stars, meteorites, stars, dreams and calendrical
calculations by a miscellany of diverse peoples; and in Chapter 31,
"No Fruits, No Birds," he explains how artificial light and modern
transport have conspired to diminish the sovereignty of the seasons,
to blur night and day. They've caused the moon and stars to fade from
everyday urban consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   But when treating standard themes of ancient and medieval history,
Blainey sometimes wobbles. Aegina was not the first place to mint
coins; Pericles was not elected sole general of Athens for 15 years
in a row; Hinduism did not arrive in India "with Indo-European
migrants"; ancient Rome was not governed by "representative
assemblies"; neither canal locks nor windmills were first invented in
medieval Europe; and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Such perhaps trivial errors of fact are enhanced by occasional
observations that seem silly. Confucius, for example, "was a scholar
of a kind more likely to be found in Athens than perhaps in any other
state along the Mediterranean." Or Blainey writes: "In 1206, however,
Genghis Khan, the chieftain of the Mongols, miraculously united these
riders of the steppes." Or again: "The tragedy was that Western
civilization, when at last it ceased to believe in witches, was also
ceasing to believe in humankind's immense capacity for evil as well
as good."</TE>
<TE>   More generally, Blainey preserves strong traces of the Christian
and British viewpoints that shape his mind. He devotes four pages to
Jesus' life and death, for example, while Buddha gets one page and
Confucius is dismissed in a paragraph. Three chapters deal with
Christianity; Islam gets one; and other world religions receive only
casual mention. Similarly, Britishers and Americans play a
preponderant role in his history of the last two or three centuries.</TE>
<TE>   This is perhaps attractive for the Australian and, now, American
readers he addresses in "A Short History of the World." But it is not
a good way to prepare for navigating the 21st century, as it tends to
reinforce religious and national self-centeredness while relegating
the overwhelming majority of humankind to marginality that they are
sure to resent and may be about to alter.</TE>

<DH>DRAKE'S FORTUNE: The Fabulous True Story of the World's
Greatest Confidence Artist, By Richard Rayner, Doubleday: 224 pp.,
$22.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANICE P. NIMURA</AU>
<BD>Janice P. Nimura is a freelance writer and reviewer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every writer is part confidence artist--"come, sit down, read what I
have to say"--but Richard Rayner's credentials as a manipulator of
the truth are more impressive than most. Readers of Rayner's artful
memoir "The Blue Suit" will remember his father, a larger-than-life
embezzler who faked his death only to reappear years later, swagger
intact despite time in jail.</LD>
<LD>   The facts about his father's life forced Rayner at an early age to
repackage his family history for public consumption, and later, at
Cambridge, he expanded his trade into book stealing, check forging
and burglary. The appeal of "The Blue Suit" lay in Rayner's ability
to tell his own sordid tale of deceit in a voice you couldn't help
trusting.</LD>
<LD>   So it isn't surprising that the story of Oscar Hartzell would
appeal to him. Even without the Barnum-esque superlatives of Rayner's
subtitle, Hartzell was a piece of work. Born in 1876 to a farm family
in western Illinois, he thought big from the start, achieving success
in livestock but always impatient for "real money." By his early 30s,
he was bankrupt.</LD>
<TE>   Enter Sir Francis Drake--yes, the Elizabethan pirate who
circumnavigated the globe, returned to his queen with plundered
treasure and died without a son. Three hundred years later, the
fantasies of fortune hunters had coalesced into the Drake estate
swindle. Its operators promised investors a piece of Drake's fortune
in exchange for a donation to the fund that would help to restore
Drake's rightful heirs. It wasn't a new scam, but it was a good one,
never better than when Hartzell was at the helm.</TE>
<TE>   Hartzell learned of the putative Drake estate when his mother
invested $6,500 in the scheme in 1914. Here was the promise of real
money, he thought, and signed on as an employee, traveling to England
with the couple in charge of the scheme at that time. At this point
he was himself a victim of the swindle, though proximity to the
perpetrators quickly enlightened him as to their wickedness and their
weaknesses: Before long, he had betrayed them and taken over the
scam. Safely ensconced in London, he informed the swelling ranks of
middle-class Midwestern investors that not only had he located
Drake's true heir but that the man in question had signed over all
his rights--to Hartzell, who was engaged to his niece.</TE>
<TE>   Three hundred years of compound interest added up to enough cash,
Hartzell wrote, to "buy the three states of Missouri, Kansas and Iowa
... and put a fence around the whole lot and then have more gold left
over than all of you ever dreamed of." Twenty billion dollars, he
said, was "a stake worth fighting for and working for and waiting
for."</TE>
<TE>   The dupes back home seemed to agree. From June 1931 to December
1932, with banks and businesses failing, they showered him with more
than $250,000. Hartzell set himself up like a lord--he had a regular
table at the Savoy--but in his correspondence he reverted to "cattle
pasture language," careful never to sound like anything but an honest
farmer.</TE>
<TE>   He was a brilliant match for the historical moment. The Crash
confirmed people's worst suspicions about Wall Street, making the
Drake Estate seem comparatively safe, and it could also be used to
explain the payoff's endless delay. "Our deal is the cause of the
depression, having tied up the finances of the whole world," one of
Hartzell's donors testified at his trial.</TE>
<TE>   Hartzell's victims adored him despite evidence that he had spent
their meager savings on Savile Row suits. To them, he was the
"conqueror," the "benign patriarch," the "economic redeemer" whose
charm reminds Rayner of his father. Even after Hartzell's
deportation, trial, conviction and incarceration at Leavenworth, he
was like "Napoleon on Elba," a hero in exile. Supporters continued to
send money, refusing to believe he was in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Hartzell eventually came full circle, living his lie so thoroughly
that he became its victim, ending his life in a hospital for the
criminally insane. Rayner traces Hartzell's madness to the moment he
returned to America and was confronted by the thousands of investors
expecting him to be the man he'd said he was. Whatever the cause, the
result was a spectacularly deluded man whose doctor wrote: "He
believes himself to be worth 53 billion pounds sterling and to be
possessed of a power approaching omnipotence."</TE>
<TE>   Rayner sees in Hartzell "an emblem of romantic individualism, and
capitalism, gone astray." It's quite a story, but to remain
enthralled by Hartzell at book length, perhaps you need a personal
history like Rayner's. The addictive joy of the grift for Rayner is
in the sleight of hand, the nimble dance a step ahead of the law, but
the exhaustively researched "Drake's Fortune" has a tendency toward
the flat-footed.</TE>
<TE>   The energy and deft irony of "The Blue Suit" are replaced by
earnest exposition on the history of the confidence game or the
psychology of the sucker. Rayner's own voice breaks through too
seldom. In telling Hartzell's story, Rayner confesses, "I've
sometimes had the feeling that I've been writing both a warning to
myself and an incitement to riot." Unfortunately, it's a feeling he
doesn't quite manage to convey.</TE>

<LD>Speaking of sunsets,</LD>
<LD>   last night's was shocking.</LD>
<LD>   I mean, sunsets aren't supposed to frighten you, are they?</LD>
<TE>   Well, this one was terrifying.</TE>
<TE>   People were screaming in the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, it was beautiful, but far too beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't natural.</TE>
<TE>   One climax followed another and then another</TE>
<TE>   until your knees went weak</TE>
<TE>   and you couldn't breathe.</TE>
<TE>   The colors were definitely not of this world,</TE>
<TE>   peaches dripping opium,</TE>
<TE>   pandemonium of tangerines,</TE>
<TE>   inferno of irises,</TE>
<TE>   Plutonian emeralds,</TE>
<TE>   all swirling and churning, swabbing,</TE>
<TE>   like it was playing with us,</TE>
<TE>   like we were nothing,</TE>
<TE>   as if our whole lives were a preparation for this,</TE>
<TE>   this for which nothing could have prepared us</TE>
<TE>   and for which we could not have been less prepared.</TE>
<TE>   The mockery of it all stung us bitterly.</TE>
<TE>   And when it was finally over</TE>

<TE>   And then the streetlights came on as always</TE>

<LD>SUMMERHOUSE, LATER</LD>
<LD>   Stories</LD>
<LD>   By Judith Hermann</LD>
<TE>   Translated from the German</TE>
<TE>   by Margot Bettauer Dembo</TE>
<TE>   Ecco: 224 pp., $22.95</TE>
<TE>   Linked stories can be a powerful form. Done well, they are filled
with echoes: gestures that appear story to story, smells and words,
not to mention names and connections between the characters. They can
reflect the tendrils of memory that grow into the present, facts and
items of earlier moments that reappear throughout a lifetime. They
have, by their very haunting nature, like the stories in Judith
Hermann's eerie collection, a sense of existing underwater, which
sometimes comes up to the surface, where the light is too bright and
everything is practical.</TE>
<TE>   "Does winter sometimes remind you of something, you don't know
what?" the narrator asks in the end of one story. This is a typical
Hermann line. As if that weren't mysterious enough, the stories in
"Summerhouse, Later" are set in Germany, many in Berlin where the
contemporary characters are faded members of the aristocracy left to
their tea and toast in heavily draped apartments, cabdrivers, artists
and beautiful women from Bali. Hermann can write a club scene in
which the narrator becomes drunker and drunker with more conviction
and precision than just about anyone I've ever read. She has a keen
grasp (if such a thing is possible) of the unreal.</TE>

<TE>   A CUP OF LIGHT</TE>
<TE>   By Nicole Mones</TE>
<TE>   Delacorte Press: 296 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Back on the surface again, "A Cup of Light" is a delightful novel
written in a far more traditional style than Hermann's. Nicole Mones
uses the style I always associate with the novels of Tom Wolfe,
particularly "Bonfire of the Vanities," in which characters' lives
are told in threads that gradually become entwined as the story
develops. It begins with Gao Yideng, an art collector and
entrepreneur in Beijing remembering his childhood, a time of famine
and poverty. He has a hunger that cannot be filled. For what? He
doesn't know. Enter Lia Frank, a specialist in Chinese porcelain who
is called to Beijing to study a gold mine of pots from the Ming
(1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1912) dynasties. Frank has a fascinating
talent for memory, a palace she creates in her mind with many rooms,
each of which holds data about a particular pot. In Beijing, she has
the task of determining which of the pots are real and which are fake
before the collection is sold to a wealthy Chinese American living in
Seattle. Ancient art, as novelist Robertson Davies knew and other
fiction writers know, makes a fine heart for a novel. Arteries wind
from its creation, sending each of the characters on his or her own
separate quest, usually a journey back into their own pasts.</TE>
<TE>   The interweaving of characters' lives, one chapter Gao, one
chapter Frank, one chapter wealthy collector, for example, is good
for a popular novel, but prevents any serious depth or insight into
the characters' lives. In the end, it has more the feel of a cocktail
party than a story; a buffet as opposed to a sit-down dinner.</TE>

<TE>   HOW NANCY JACKSON MARRIED KATE WILSON</TE>
<TE>   And Other Tales of Rebellious Girls  &amp; Daring Young Women</TE>
<TE>   By Mark Twain</TE>
<TE>   Edited by John Cooley</TE>
<TE>   Bison Books / University of Nevada</TE>
<TE>   Press: 254 pp., $21.95</TE>
<TE>   Samuel Clemens lived in a house of women. He had three daughters.
By 1906, the youngest of these had left the roost, and Clemens began
seeking out the company of young schoolgirls (once they turned 16, he
felt uncomfortable about the friendships). They were his
"Angel-Fish," and he called his home the "Aquarium Club." Around this
time, he began writing more and more about adventurous daring women,
as well as satires on sentimental romance. Characters like Lucretia
Borgia Smith, Hellfire Hotchkiss and Wrapping Alice were vehicles for
his fascination with role-playing in relationships, cross-dressing
and vigilante women. The hard-driving, horse-riding, gun-toting
cowgirls are fun, but the stories in which he makes fun of sappy
romance are the side-splitters.</TE>
<TE>   "Aurelia's Unfortunate Young Man" is a story written in the form
of a plaintive letter from a young woman engaged to a man who, during
the course of their engagement, got the small pox, lost limbs and an
eye to various accidents and was scalped by an Indian (he lives,
scalpless). Aurelia wonders if it would be wrong to break off the
engagement. "Little Bessie" is written in a series of questions from
an extremely precocious 3-year-old. "St. Joan of Arc" reveals Twain's
true respect for women and in many ways his visionary insight into a
future in which women get out in the world and take control of their
own destinies.</TE>

<LD>THREE JUNES</LD>
<LD>   By Julia Glass</LD>
<LD>   Pantheon: 368 pp., $25</LD>
<TE>   Two-thirds through "Three Junes," Julia Glass' gorgeous if
occasionally faltering debut, Fenno McLeod--handsome, gay,
Scottish--muses about his friend Mal, an acid-tongued music critic
who has died of AIDS. Recalling how he used to peer into Mal's window
across the Greenwich Village street that separated their apartments,
Fenno realizes how he had enjoyed a "glimpse of an entire life I
might have shared, a love I managed to lose without knowing it was
mine." Missed connections abound in this well-traveled triptych,
which focuses on three summers in the lives of Fenno and his family
in Scotland, Greece, New York, Paris and Long Island.</TE>
<TE>   In "Collies," the first--and best--of the ambitious novel's three
parts, we find Fenno's father, Paul, on holiday in Greece in 1989,
six months after the death of his wife, Maureen, a breeder of border
collies. As intimations arise about Maureen's possible infidelities,
Paul lapses into an infatuation with Fern, a recent college graduate
who, naturally, ends up sleeping with a roguish tour guide.</TE>
<TE>   In "Upright," we catch up with Fenno in 1995, home from New York
and attending his father's funeral. Amid all the household clamor,
Fenno ruminates over his poignant, unconsummated relationship with
the late Mal. If the prolix "Upright" causes "Three Junes" to sag,
the concluding "Boys" provides a lift, finding Fenno, in a cosmic
twist, hanging out with Fern in the Hamptons in 1999. (Fern and
Fenno, of course, never realize their connection.)</TE>
<TE>   Preoccupied with death and fixated on near-misses, "Three Junes"
goes after the big issues without a trace of fustiness and gives us a
memorable hero--the reflective yet oddly detached Fenno--who's
forever "waking to look again at the life I am learning, just
learning to live."</TE>

<TE>   THE SHAPE OF WATER</TE>
<TE>   By Andrea Camilleri</TE>
<TE>   Translated from the Italian</TE>
<TE>   by Stephen Sartarelli</TE>
<TE>   Viking: 202 pp., $20.95</TE>
<TE>   "Poor Mr. Luparello felt like having a good lay in the Pasture,
maybe with some exotic foreign slut, and he had it, all right, and
left his carcass behind." This is the grim tableau, as poetically
described by Coroner Pasquano, facing Inspector Salvo Montalbano, the
cool-as-a-cucumber Sicilian sleuth who stars in this sun-drenched
mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Signor Montalbano has the kind of washed-out, cynical panache
you'd expect from any self-respecting middle-aged detective but with
a decidedly Euro twist. Hailing from the land of Umberto Eco and La
Cosa Nostra, Montalbano can discuss a pointy-headed book like
"Western Attitudes Toward Death" as unflinchingly as he can pore over
crime-scene snuff photos. He throws together an extemporaneous lunch
of shrimp with lemon and oil as gracefully as he dodges advances from
attractive women. And he's clear-eyed enough to realize that the
current Luparello affair isn't just another ho-hum case of flagrante
delicto. After all, as one of Montalbano's colleagues jokes, death by
natural causes is rare on this beautiful but dangerous island.</TE>
<TE>   Montalbano's co-star, Sicily itself--with its rugged terrain,
ancient vistas and daily outbreaks of gunfire--nearly steals the
show. It's a place that Andrea Camilleri evokes splendidly (even in
this sometimes unsteady translation), and it's one that Montalbano,
even when he's off enjoying a romantic tryst in Genoa, can never
fully escape: "It wasn't the smell and speech of his island that
sucked him back there but the stupidity, the ferocity, the horror."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SIMPLE RECIPES</TE>
<TE>   By Madeleine Thien</TE>
<TE>   Little, Brown: 230 pp., $22.95</TE>
<TE>   The stoic Canadian women who narrate Madeleine Thien's graceful
stories of working-class families gone awry have a way of quietly
bringing the reader face to face with astonishing moments of parental
cruelty, neglect or, worst of all, indifference. It's as if these
women have no reason not to be heartbreakingly low-key about
childhoods spent in foster care, dealing with flaky moms or warding
off sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for instance, Miriam, who narrates "A Map of the City."
After affectionately outlining her parents' lives as Indonesian
immigrants, she drops a bombshell: "[M]y father would often say that
I ruined his life." Similarly, in the title story, a nameless young
girl revels in her Malaysian father's wizardry in the kitchen--and
his scorn at the cornball antics of TV's Chef Yan--only to eventually
reveal that he handles her bratty brother with the same no-nonsense
brutality he employs in preparing a whole fish for the dinner table.
And, in "House," two abandoned sisters return to spy on their old
home, waiting in vain for their mother to reappear and recalling how
their father--the responsible one--dumped them with a social worker
because "he wasn't up to raising a family." Thien avoids giving us an
Oprah sob-fest: Her delicate prose turns out to be surprisingly
resilient, holding these weighty familial betrayals aloft as if it
were a luminous safety net.</TE>

<HD>The Postwar Fate of American Fiction</HD>
<DH>LEOPARDS IN THE TEMPLE: The Transformation of American
Fiction, 1945-1970, By Morris Dickstein, Harvard University Press:
144 pp., $15.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE SIEGEL</AU>
<BD>Lee Siegel is a contributing writer to Book Review and
the recipient of the 2002 National Magazine Award for reviews and
criticism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Palefaces" on one side, and "redskins" on the other was how the
critic Philip Rahv divided up American writers in 1938, during bygone
days of political incorrectness. In the former category, Rahv located
figures such as Henry James and Edith Wharton, "palefaces" partly
because of their high-society subject matter and partly because of
the ironic, introspective, heavily psychological way they treated it.
"Redskins" such as Mark Twain and Herman Melville, on the other hand,
portrayed runaways and cannibals in rough dialects and raw settings.</LD>
<LD>   As Morris Dickstein intelligently illustrates, postwar American
fiction married Rahv's segregated poles. "Paleface" and "redskin"
sensibilities coupled (Philip Roth, thinking of Rahv, once referred
to himself as a "Redface") and populated the period with teeming
hybrids of subtlety and savagery. There were the ambitiously
realistic war-novels "The Naked and the Dead" by Norman Mailer and
"From Here to Eternity" by James Jones; satirical, marmoreal fiction
by Gore Vidal and Truman Capote that explored gay identity; Jack
Kerouac's sunny, ebullient assaults on the status quo and Mailer's
gloomy, ebullient assaults on the status quo; postmodernist puzzles
by John Barth; cool aesthetic edifices by Vladimir Nabokov.</LD>
<TE>   "Leopards in the Temple" is the only lucid and enjoyably written
study of postwar American fiction to have come along in years. It
first appeared in "The Cambridge History of American Literature,"
which means that Dickstein's commentary will stand for a long time as
the reference work that high school and college students turn to for
clarity on the subject. And so it's important to get a good take on
Dickstein's own. Dickstein wants to revise the conventional view of
the 1950s as a time of social conformity and political consensus, in
which both types of complacency were nourished by tremendous economic
growth and a sense of almost majestic power following the victories
over Germany and Japan. Underneath the seemingly passive acceptance
of mainstream values, Dickstein finds the "thread of anxiety,
paranoia, and inner conflict," but he also discovers a "wild
emotional vitality ... that fed paradoxically off the economic
expansions and the new social mobility."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, pinning labels on all the multitudinous episodes and
events that we call history is a tricky enterprise. Dickstein adduces
films noir to show the darkness lurking behind the light, and the
novels of Kerouac, Vidal and Mailer to show the openness waiting
behind the conformity. In other words, to demonstrate the 1950s' wild
side, he presents what everyone already accepts as proof of the
1950s' wild side. This literary scholar only becomes interesting when
his conceptual framework starts to lose its moorings in the rising
flood of its contradictions, when his paleface rationalizing finds
itself floating downriver through the ineffable terrain of American
experience.</TE>
<TE>   Dickstein later concedes that it was, in fact, economic expansion
that unparadoxically afforded writers the confidence and serenity to
explore the shifting inner tides of anxiety and paranoia. This leads
him to identify Kerouac's exuberant "On the Road" with American
triumphalism and, with bracing originality, to associate John
Updike's Rabbit trilogy with Kerouac's beat picaresque novel.
Dickstein insightfully shows that Vidal and Capote, possessing
polished styles and plumbing subterranean subjects, are smoothly
assimilable, unsettlingly subversive, deeply introspective and
penetratingly social. You simply cannot get a fix on these figures.</TE>
<TE>   James Baldwin, the socially enraged novelist who also railed
against novels of social protest, is a typical case: As many
contradictions exist in a single writer during those 25 years as
among writers. Thus Dickstein's idea of fiction's withdrawal into the
self after the war falters when he takes up astronauts of identity
such as Saul Bellow and Roth, who twinned their self-investigations
with precise renderings of their milieus. If Mailer returned again
and again to his own ego, he also showed an uncanny receptiveness to
the nature of other people. "Outsiders," such as Vidal the alienated
satirist, could operate simultaneously alongside "insiders," such as
Vidal the rueful icy patrician. Ralph Ellison, who celebrated
moderation and rationality in his essays, depicted a dark, absurdist
world in his masterpiece, "Invisible Man."</TE>
<TE>   Ellison emerges as the hero of this book, and that is because
Dickstein cherishes what he characterizes as Ellison's "pragmatism."
Pragmatism has become a buzz word among professors alienated by the
academic left's forbidding obscurities; they like the philosophy's
amiable blend of liberal tolerance and common sense. But it's a
strange concept to apply to this novelist, whose work's power lies in
its furious irrationality.</TE>
<TE>   Dickstein's treatment of Ellison is where his attempt to explode
the standard view of the closed, conformist 1950s becomes nearly as
narrow and tame as that view itself. Dickstein describes Ellison as
"stak[ing] the greatest claims--not for a separate black culture or
literary tradition, but for an inestimably great role within American
culture." This is indeed how Ellison envisioned the black experience
in his essays and speeches, but it has nothing to do with his vision
of black experience in "Invisible Man," whose hero Dickstein rightly
characterizes as "breaking with received messages, socially ascribed
roles, conventional restraints, and respectable ambitions." There is
nothing liberally tolerant, common-sensical or pragmatic about
Ellison's Dostoevskyan hero, who rejects social life altogether at
the end of the novel and goes to live in a basement, literally
"underground."</TE>
<TE>   Rational, liberal, humane, pragmatic, Dickstein is uncomfortable
with the very adversarial qualities he tries to affirm as proving his
counter-vision of the '50s. He keenly dislikes Bellow's satirical
"rancor," the "highly sexualized hatred" of some of Baldwin's
characters, Roth's "apocalyptic fury." Some readers, however, find in
such honest intensities a soaring, life-affirming exuberance and the
source of the artist's power and integrity.</TE>
<TE>   Dickstein's paleface temperament produces luminous sections on
Updike and John Cheever that alone are worth the price of the book,
but it makes his reading of postwar fiction both standard and
insubstantial. We get the usual lineup, though in an oddly censorious
way, of Bellow-Mailer-Roth-Bernard Malamud et al., but no discussion
of wild, offbeat Donald Barthelme, for example, or of Thomas Pynchon,
whose proto-postmodernly ironic picaros have had more influence--for
better and for worse--than any of the figures in Dickstein's
pantheon.</TE>
<TE>   Dickstein takes the title of his book from Kafka: "Leopards break
into the temple and drink to the dregs what is in the sacrificial
precincts, this is repeated over and over again ... and it becomes
part of the ceremony." The author wants to imply that the fiction
writers of the postwar period, for all their feral energies, became
nicely assimilated into mainstream culture. It is a sort of
wish-fulfillment on the part of this nice, moderate critic. But art
can no more be assimilated by society than history can be reduced to
an equation.</TE>

<DH>THREE STRIDES BEFORE THE WIRE: The Dark and Beautiful World
of Horse Racing,  By Elizabeth Mitchell, Hyperion: 404 pp., $24.95
STUD: Adventures in Breeding, By Kevin Conley, Bloomsbury: 214 pp.,
$24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE SMILEY</AU>
<BD>Jane Smiley is the author of, most recently, "Charles
Dickens" and the novel "Horse Heaven."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Horse racing is a writer's game rather than a broadcaster's game
because, as wonderful as a great race is to see, it is even more
wonderful to visualize. Everything horses do is arcane; most things
they do are subtle. In the course of a two-minute race, the eye can't
pick up any but the grossest details; retrospective interpretation is
always illuminating.</LD>
<LD>   In this year's Kentucky Derby, it looked on the tape as though the
winner, War Emblem, had cut in front of the third horse, Perfect
Drift. When asked after the race why he didn't register a foul, Eddie
Delahoussaye, Perfect Drift's jockey, said simply that he might have
if he had lost by a neck, but it was clear to him that Victor
Espinoza, War Emblem's jockey, had so much horse left that it wasn't
worth the protest. The fact is, horses require elegant interpretation
in the same way all unpredictable quantities do--metaphors like "came
from the clouds" and "nipped at the wire" try to give the feel of
something ineffable, something that feels like it has meaning but may
not.</LD>
<TE>   Kevin Conley and Elizabeth Mitchell are writers first and horse
lovers second. Conley wrote a piece for the New Yorker about Storm
Cat, the most expensive thoroughbred sire in the world, and then
decided a book about horse breeding might be fun. Mitchell, who used
to work for George magazine and has written a book about George W.
Bush and his family, happened to go to the 1999 Kentucky Derby and,
as a result of a dream, won a bundle on longshot Charismatic. Their
books, though quite different, attempt to bridge normal life and life
with horses; both succeed, one comically and one tragically.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell's story is a strange one and almost bursts the bounds of
her form. She found herself at the Derby as a celebration and maybe
as a ritual exorcism. Her new boyfriend, Chuck Fulgham, was
recovering from the effects of chemotherapy to treat leukemia.
Neither he nor Mitchell was a longtime horse-racing fan, but they
resonated strongly with Charismatic and his jockey, Chris Antley.</TE>
<TE>   After the Derby, Charismatic went on to win the Preakness and
would probably have won the Belmont Stakes and the Triple Crown if he
hadn't snapped his sesamoids on the long Belmont homestretch. As soon
as he could stop the horse, Antley leaped from the saddle and stood
beside the animal, holding the horse's injured foot up, tears
streaming down his face.</TE>
<TE>   Synchronicity is at the core of every horse racing story. Somehow,
the ever-changing pattern of RNA, intention, accident and luck
produces one dramatic story after another, and a horse race is its
own best emblem of such happenstance--18 brightly colored silks
making a randomly beautiful pattern on a brown track between two
white rails until the finish line determines the winner and installs
a narrative in the history books. This synchronicity seems to have
inspired Mitchell to write this book.</TE>
<TE>   The good times didn't last long for either Antley or Fulgham. In
spite of two more bouts of increasingly arduous treatment, Fulgham
died at the end of 1999. Antley died, possibly was slain, at the end
of 2000. Fulgham was 31; Antley was 34. One of the few nice things
Fulgham experienced toward the end of his life was a visit by Antley
to his hospital room, where Antley was kind and encouraging, though
it was obvious to everyone that the end for Fulgham was near.</TE>
<TE>   In form, Mitchell takes Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling
"Seabiscuit: An American Legend" as her model. She profiles the
owners (Bob and Beverly Lewis), the jockey, the horse, the breeders
and the trainer (though judging from the notes, she didn't actually
get to talk to D. Wayne Lukas, Charismatic's trainer, which is fine
because Lukas has said plenty on the record over the years and
doesn't like reporters). As with "Seabiscuit," the jock's story is
the most interesting and dramatic, though Mitchell does what she can
with the much-loved Lewises and the not-so-loved but always
interesting Lukas. She also fills in, gracefully I think, her own
heartbreak.</TE>
<TE>   Often the story is sordid or fearsome. Upon investigation,
Mitchell discovered that Antley had been one of racing's lost souls:
a man of unusual talent, accomplishment and charm who destroyed his
life and his career with drugs, alcohol and bad companions. His is
also one of racing's lost stories: The Pasadena police--Antley lived
and died in Pasadena--have closed the book on his demise, even though
the coroner's explanation--an overdose of methamphetamine and a
weight-loss drug--seems unlikely on its face. Mitchell suggests that
drugs are an easy answer to what might be a hard question. Antley
often told friends that someone was going to get him. Mitchell hints
that that someone was not necessarily a drug dealer but possibly
someone closer to racing and race fixing.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Mitchell's years writing about politics prepared her to
see the dark side of horse racing, and certainly there is a dark
side. But because racing is a world of secrets and rumor, it is
impossible to know what we may not be seeing, and every writer sees
what he or she is prepared to see. No one knows how many trainers or
jockeys cheat, how many horses run sore or injured, how many
accidents are the result of pure danger and chance, how many the
result of chicanery.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell is a practiced and assiduous delver. "Three Strides
Before the Wire" is the result of hard work, but Mitchell, though
always full of feeling, manages to avoid Hillenbrand's overheated
style. She also has a less glamorous and more immediate story to
tell. My only objection, and it is a small one, is that perhaps her
stories were told too soon. Antley's story is unfinished and no
longer news, and Mitchell's own story, too, is almost too fresh to
assimilate.</TE>
<TE>   For the scenic tour, we have "Stud" by Conley. He looks at the
real heart of the horse business, which is breeding. Horse farms in
Kentucky are where the big money is made: A successful stallion's
breeding income dwarfs anything he might earn on the racetrack.</TE>
<TE>   Thoroughbreds breed by what is called "live cover," rather than
artificial insemination, and the act is loud, imposing and
repetitive. Lots of writers, myself included, have wrung whatever
bits of pawky salaciousness there are to be had from it but, unlike
horse racing, it is better seen than reported.</TE>
<TE>   Conley is a stylish and witty writer. He is observant and takes
good notes, but he is a tourist in this world, and what he sees is
what the farms, big and little, are willing to show him.</TE>
<TE>   Books about horse racing, and horses in general, always have an
audience problem. The books must be pitched to a general audience and
must not only explain finer points for the average reader but also
put everything in context. Thus a newcomer gets a good sense of what
outsiders need to know. But such a book may not appeal to insiders,
who are quick to pick up on any incorrect detail and toss the book
aside. For example, Conley refers to a common equine sedative as
"demosedan," rather than "dormosedan." More humorous, Mitchell refers
to the Derby contender, Worldly Manner, as winning his first four
starts in Holland and Denmark rather than at Hollywood Park and Del
Mar tracks.</TE>
<TE>   But errors aside, the truth is that for all the hoopla surrounding
the races, the money and the sex, what really occupies the minds of
horsemen and -women are the horses themselves: how to read a horse's
idiosyncrasies, how to mitigate their effects, how to get horses to
run and win in spite of them, how to understand horses' ills and
navigate the tricky road to exceptional performance.</TE>
<TE>   Trainers like Lukas and jockeys like Antley and Delahoussaye do
much of this work automatically. At the start of this year's Derby,
Lukas' horse, Proud Citizen, was restive in the saddling stall. Lukas
stood with him, jiggling his lead rope and settling him with an
expertise and force of personality that was evident even on TV.</TE>
<TE>   When authors can't communicate the characters and the
idiosyncrasies of the horses, they are forced to leave out the most
interesting and important figures in the picture.</TE>
<TE>   For most of "Stud," Conley seems to be a stranger at the wedding.
He sees what he can and pays attention to what he's told, but the
real story, which is in the rumors and suspicions, the secrets and
clues, is hardly hinted at, so Conley's book just skims the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell is more investigative and managed to get her informants
to talk more openly. She went to Antley's funeral, made friends with
some members of his family, got to talk with fellow jockeys and
associates who had real opinions. She is not shy about relating
unpleasantness: for example, that Lukas criticized Antley after his
death for rushing from New York to California to ride in another race
the day after the Belmont, even though the horse Antley rode (and won
with) was one of Lukas' own.</TE>
<TE>   Most telling: Toward the end of his book, Conley visits a herd of
feral ponies in Pennsylvania and for several days observes them on
his own without intermediaries. He begins to detect their ways of
doing things and of being with one another. He begins to be
fascinated with the equines themselves, which goes a long way to
giving his book a certain charm.</TE>
<TE>   Writing about horse racing is like writing about church: Something
mysterious--often wonderful and sometimes terrifying--takes place
within the ritualized and repetitive structure of these worlds.
Participants are often hard put to communicate what they get out of
the experience, but they keep going back for more.</TE>
<TE>   With "Three Strides Before the Wire" and "Stud," Mitchell and
Conley have detailed their conversions. With luck they'll stick
around long enough to learn, and impart, the knowledge that comes
later.</TE>

<HD>Three Questions for Hershel Parker</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SALTER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: What was your introduction to Melville?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Through Shakespeare. I left high school after the 11th
grade and for seven years was a railroad telegrapher in Louisiana and
Texas. I caught tuberculosis and took only one book to a sanitarium,
a one-volume Shakespeare. By the time I read "Moby-Dick" and
"Pierre," I was astounded that an American writer had absorbed
Shakespeare so profoundly.</LD>
<LD>   In 1962 at Northwestern University, I wrote a paper for the
Melville scholar Harrison Hayford on "The Metaphysics of
Indian-Hating" in "The Confidence-Man." I am a quarter Indian
(Cherokee and Choctaw), but this was not an exercise in victimology.
With my Baptist background and knowing the analysis of the
practicability of Christianity in "Pierre," I saw that in his
allegorical depiction of Indian-hating, Melville was contrasting
absolute and nominal Christianity. Hayford demanded publishable
articles, so I sent that paper to a literary journal published at
UCLA and in 1963 found myself with a new career, that easy.</LD>
<TE>   Q: What was the most exciting discovery for you in this volume?</TE>
<TE>   A: Finding that Melville had completed a book called "The Isle of
the Cross" around May 22, 1853. I had the privilege of telephoning
two old masters, Hayford and Merton M. Sealts, to tell them Melville
had finished the story about the abandoned wife he had tried to
persuade Hawthorne to write. Then it was even more exciting to try to
imagine what Melville had learned while writing "The Isle of the
Cross," next after "Pierre," and had then brought to his writing of
"Bartleby."</TE>
<TE>   Truth is, I wrote the two volumes in shifting states of high
excitement. I loved using unlikely evidence, as for 1862, when the
author of the forgotten "Moby-Dick" humbly consulted many authorities
to see what they said about achieving greatness in literature. From
his marginalia, I was able to make a dramatic narrative about his
quest for an aesthetic credo.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Could Melville have written in our times?</TE>
<TE>   A: Not as he did. Melville plundered travel books, encyclopedias,
all kinds of books, as any good writer could do now. But he was an
autodidact who read all of Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth,
Byron and other poets on his own, at his own pace, absorbing
literature into his lifeblood in a way that would be very hard to
equal today. He was steeped in masterpieces. That's rare in our age
of sound bites and pervasive electronic racket. Do you know anyone
who has read all of "The Faerie Queene" this year?</TE>
<TE>   The bright side is that any enterprising young person with
literary ambitions now has instant access to splendid performances of
many of Shakespeare's plays. Melville heard Fanny Kemble read from
"Macbeth" one night, and then from "Othello" another night. Just
think how rhapsodic he would have been at seeing and hearing Baz
Luhrmann's "William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet" as often as he
wanted to. When will the great Shakespearean Patrick Stewart record
all of "Paradise Lost" for commuting Angelenos? When will Laurie
Anderson perform all of Wordsworth's "The Excursion"?</TE>

<HD>Skipping to the Head of the Cast</HD>
<DH>After an unlikely big break, rising actor Colin Firth is
getting lead roles in films such as a new Oscar Wilde adaptation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLEN BASKIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a journeyman actor in
possession of leading-man good looks must be in want of a breakout
role--or so Jane Austen might have said, were she writing about
Hollywood rather than Hampshire. Colin Firth had no idea he'd landed
such a role in 1995, when he was cast as Mr. Darcy in a BBC
miniseries production of "Pride and Prejudice."</LD>
<LD>   The English actor was by then a veteran of more than a dozen film
and television appearances, including the title role in the 1989 film
"Valmont," and considered himself far more "a jobbing actor" than a
dishy screen star. But attention was paid, especially by the female
population of the English-speaking world. Firth's smoldering presence
and intense gazes in the direction of Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth
Bennet so dominated the dramatic goings-on that the program could
well have been retitled "Pride and Prejudice: The Darcy Chronicles."</LD>
<TE>   It didn't end there. In Helen Fielding's 1998 novel, "Bridget
Jones's Diary," a comic modernization of Austen's classic, Firth
showed up as both himself and via his interpretation of the fictional
hero. What's more, Fielding dubbed her novel's male lead Darcy as
well. As if all that wasn't confusing enough, the irony ante was
upped yet again when Firth was cast as Darcy in last year's hit film,
which starred Renee Zellweger as Bridget and Hugh Grant as Firth's
rival for her affections.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd appeared as a character in the novel," Firth explains with
deadpan wit. "And now the actor that appeared in the novel was
playing the guy called Darcy from the novel, who is based on the guy
I played on television." By the end, even Firth had trouble keeping
track of which version of himself he was supposed to be at any given
moment.</TE>
<TE>   A more literal game of who's who is played out in Firth's latest
film. He co-stars with Rupert Everett in "The Importance of Being
Earnest," a new film treatment of Oscar Wilde's classic comedy of
manners, mores and mistaken identity among the British upper crust.
It opened Wednesday in Los Angeles."Earnest" premiered on stage in
London on Valentine's Day 1895 and has remained a theatrical staple.
But this production, directed by Oliver Parker, is only the second
major film adaptation. Anthony Asquith directed that 1952 version,
with Michael Redgrave in the role Firth has. ("Earnest" has been done
several times for television, and an independent production with an
African American cast was filmed in 1992.)</TE>
<TE>   "You jump at something like this," Firth says of the opportunity
to play Jack Worthing, a reserved suburban gent who often must
journey to London to deal with the exploits of his troublesome
brother Ernest--who, by the way, is a fictional creation whose
made-up predicaments allow Jack to escape the genteel confines of the
countryside. As Ernest, Jack woos the lovely Gwendolen (Frances
O'Connor)--that is, when he's not teaming up with suave ne'er-do-well
Algernon Moncrieff (Everett) and going out on the town.</TE>
<TE>   The plot, such as it is, thickens when Algernon takes on the
Ernest title and takes off for the country to court Jack's naive
ward, Cecily (Reese Witherspoon). In the midst of all this, Jack must
also contend with Gwendolen's mother, the imperious Lady Bracknell
(Judi Dench). Much witty havoc ensues.</TE>
<TE>   "My job is entirely language-dependent, and it doesn't get much
better than this," Firth says of Wilde's sparkling dialogue. "But it
throws down the gauntlet, because it has been tried and tested and
proven to work. You can't blame the author if it doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   Wilde's works have never strayed too far from the cultural
consciousness, but in recent years, particularly, he has been in
vogue.</TE>
<TE>   Parker first directed Everett in 1999 in "An Ideal Husband." Wilde
himself has emerged as a character in a number of film and stage
works, including Tom Stoppard's 1997 play "The Invention of Love,"
the film biography "Wilde" (1997), starring Stephen Fry, and Moises
Kaufman's acclaimed play "Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar
Wilde" (1998), which focused on the libel trial that ultimately
resulted in the writer's personal and professional downfall.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an avant-garde figure in his day, and I think if you are
avant-garde and also have substance to your work, you remain
relevant," Parker says of Wilde's continued audience appeal. "The
conventional image of Wilde is of someone who's brittle and rather
too clever. But, in fact, his work is continually probing and also
pleading for a tolerant worldview. Beneath the surface of a lot of
these apparently simple, glib comments is a great humanity. And I
think he's at his most powerful and insightful when his touch is at
its lightest."</TE>
<TE>   Firth shares his director's observation that Wilde is not
exclusively about clever wordplay and sharp wit.</TE>
<TE>   "You can also talk about 'The Ballad of Reading Gaol' or tell the
stories of his other plays and make them sound like heart-tugging
dramas," he says. "There is enormous dimension to him, and I think
he's relentlessly applicable."</TE>
<TE>   But the wit is formidable, and it can be as laugh-out-loud funny
today as on opening night at London's St. James Theatre. "If you can
laugh at comedy a hundred years after it was written, I'm pretty sure
you'll be laughing 500 years later," Firth declares. "Comedy usually
dies with the era. It doesn't cross over very easily. But this has.
Anybody who speaks English can find these lines funny."</TE>
<TE>   Firth, 41, made his film debut in 1984 in "Another Country," in
which he also co-starred with Everett. The two played sparring
schoolmates in that film, their on-screen antagonism mirrored
somewhat when the cameras stopped rolling. "We didn't get on
particularly well the first time around," Firth admits. "I was far
too--if you'll pardon the pun--earnest for him at that time, and he
was far too sophisticated and worldly for me."</TE>
<TE>   Both actors also appeared in 1998's "Shakespeare in Love" (Firth
was the villainous Lord Wessex, Everett the writer Christopher
Marlowe), but they shared no screen time. So when they met in
preparation for "Earnest," it was the first time they'd seen each
other in nearly 20 years. "They got on like a house on fire,"
director Parker reports. "Their banter on the screen was often
eclipsed by what went on off-screen."</TE>
<TE>   "There is something that works between Rupert and myself," Firth
acknowledges of their rapport. "People have even said it should be a
franchise now, like Lemmon and Matthau."</TE>
<TE>   Born in England, Firth spent several years of his early childhood
in Nigeria. His parents are teachers, and the family moved around a
lot, with Firth even spending one year of junior high in St. Louis,
Mo. He lives now in London with his wife, Italian film producer Livia
Giuggioli, and year-old son, Luca. Firth has an older son, William,
11, who lives in Los Angeles with his mother, actress Meg Tilly
(Firth's "Valmont" co-star).</TE>
<TE>   In person, the indeed handsome and charming Firth is self-effacing
and almost apologetic about his sex-symbol status. "I will take it on
as my achievement," he allows of the "Pride and Prejudice" phenomenon
that redefined his career. "But it is completely and utterly an
achievement of my having done that job properly."</TE>
<TE>   By the time the miniseries aired and the media storm hit, Firth
was out of town, on to his second post-"Pride" assignment. When
confronted with the unexpected attention, he was "a bit dazed. I
simply did not know how to react."</TE>
<TE>   Next up for Firth is "Hope Springs," based on the novel "New
Cardiff" by Charles Webb, author of "The Graduate." Firth co-stars
with Heather Graham and Minnie Driver in the story of an Englishman
who travels to a randomly selected small town in the States to get
over an unhappy love affair. Written and directed by Mark Herman
("Little Voice," "Brassed Off"), the film is due this autumn.</TE>
<TE>   Before "Bridget Jones," Firth had mostly played dramatic roles,
often sporting the ruffles and flourishes of period costume. "I'd
been wanting to do comedy for many years, then it finally came, and
when it rains it pours," he says. "Since 'Bridget Jones,' I have been
doing, and I think I will be doing, English guys in romantic comedies
for a while."</TE>
<TE>   As for what it's like to have become a cultural reference point,
"it actually felt rather good," Firth confesses. "There is something
about being immortalized in a novel that's rather different than
having done a film or being written about in a magazine."</TE>

<DH>With his new finale for Puccini's 'Turandot,' leading
Italian composer Luciano Berio is reaching into the musical past to
reshape Los Angeles Opera's aesthetic</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN BRESLAUER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>It's spring in the Eternal City, and the Piazza di Spagna teems with
gawkers and idlers. A cascade of pink azaleas adorns the Spanish
Steps, the famous gathering spot of English Romantics from Keats to
Byron. The late afternoon sun burnishes the horse carriages and the
Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Missoni stores. Languor and renewal are in the
air.</LD>
<LD>   Just a couple of blocks away, Luciano Berio, arguably Italy's most
important living composer, sits in his second-floor office at the
Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia. Behind his massive wooden desk
is a centuries-old painting of a lutenist. Strains of a Bach concerto
waft into the room, and motorbikes whiz over the cobblestones of the
Via Vittoria below. Subordinates pop in and out, cuckoo-like, with a
"Maestro?" this and a "Maestro?" that. It's a dignified cacophony,
and the feeling of expectation is as palpable as a rest between
notes.</LD>
<LD>   Founded in 1585 and famed for its chorus and orchestra (now under
the direction of Myung-Whun Chung), Santa Cecilia, Rome's oldest
musical institution, has never had a home to call its own. But on
this weekend in late April, that's about to change.</LD>
<TE>   During the next two days, Berio, Santa Cecilia's president for the
past two years, will unveil the academy's first permanent base,
designed by architect Renzo Piano.</TE>
<TE>   "He built what we call the city of music: three immense, beautiful
music halls, interconnected, and the opening of two of them happens
Sunday," says Berio, his voice tinged with pride and anticipation.
"The conception of this is so beautiful, so new."</TE>
<TE>   The opening is a red-letter day for Berio, but it's not the only
important item on the composer's agenda. Although he achieved fame as
an iconoclastic figure in the United States in the 1960s, he is best
known in Europe. Now, Berio may be on the brink of gaining wider
recognition in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   He has three projects with Los Angeles Opera. First up is a new
ending for Puccini's "Turandot," left unfinished at the composer's
death in 1924. Led by principal conductor Kent Nagano, the opera was
scheduled to open, with Berio's finale getting its first staging
ever, Saturday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   The completion of "Turandot" that we've been hearing over the
years has long been considered unsatisfactory. "The opera is full of
contradictions," Berio says. Before he created his "quiet" version,
he says, he "was very interested in reading everything about this,
even [hearing] from people who knew Puccini and what he said. Once I
met this man and he says to me, 'Listen, "Turandot" is ending
pianissimo.' So I think [my] result is closer to what Puccini
wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Berio is also working on a new orchestration of Monteverdi's "The
Coronation of Poppea" for the 2002-03 season, and he is writing a new
opera to star Los Angeles Opera artistic director Placido Domingo for
2006. In addition, this Saturday, pianist Marino Formenti will play
the West Coast premiere of Berio's "Sonata 2001" at the Ojai Music
Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Berio's L.A. Opera commissions represent the institution's largest
public commitment to a single composer since Domingo took over. "We
started thinking about the 'Turandot,' and then the idea was extended
onto the 'Poppea' because Berio has been greatly recognized for his
work in that area," says Domingo, speaking recently in New York at 2
a.m., after conducting a performance of "Rigoletto" at the Met. "And
the third thing is, since we have this internationally well-known
composer, why not have him write a new opera?"</TE>
<TE>   It's hoped that the Berio projects will help shape a new aesthetic
identity for Los Angeles Opera--one in which successful premieres
figure prominently. "I believe in the talent of Berio," Domingo
continues, "and I believe it will bring a lot of attention and
reactions. You take risks with everything, even in the most
traditional works. So the risks are bigger in these occasions, but
there is a certain kind of insurance when you have a great artist
involved."</TE>
<TE>   When he's not at his country home in Radicondoli, near Siena, the
77-year-old Berio and his much younger third wife, Israeli
musicologist Talia Pecker, spend much of their time in Rome. It is a
city of layers, where the strata of 2,000 years of human
civilization--ancient, Renaissance, Baroque, modern--are as clear as
the sign on the next gelato cart. Across the plaza from the subway,
there's an archeological dig. Next to a movie house, a medieval
turret has been turned into a bistro.</TE>
<TE>   The tenses of time coexist in a similar way in Berio's music. He
has incorporated earlier compositions by other composers into his own
pieces and written adaptations of other composers' scores. In
"Rendering," for example, Berio took Schubert's unfinished 10th
Symphony and filled in the composer's sketches with his distinct
sound. "Sinfonia," written for orchestra and the Swingle Singers,
"samples" a movement from a Mahler symphony, only to reinterpret it
with an array of quotations from other sources.</TE>
<TE>   Part of an international cadre of avant-garde composers who came
to the fore after World War II, Berio is a creative coeval of Pierre
Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Gyorgy Ligeti and Luigi Nono. Yet
unlike these other formidable Modernists, Berio has been known for a
sense of harmony and lyricism--an Italianate quality--that makes him
more accessible to the untrained ear.</TE>
<TE>   His tendency to provoke and charm is as evident in his persona as
his music. A short man dwarfed by his big wooden desk, Berio plays
the role of commander with ease, even as he hints at resenting its
obligations. His look is stylishly rumpled, a fleshy but still
appealing face framed by a collarless gray shirt and plaid jacket.</TE>
<TE>   At moments, the maestro is almost puckish. More often, he's
imperious and a bit cranky, not bothering to hide his impatience.
When he feels he's said enough on one topic, even if it's only a few
words, he orders, "Let's move." Then he flashes a big compensatory
smile--the tactics of a man who's long gotten away with using
charisma to balance impudence.</TE>
<TE>   That was the case in the 1960s, when he was teaching at Mills
College in Oakland, and later at Harvard and Juilliard. When he first
came to the U.S., he was married to Cathy Berberian, an American
soprano for whom he wrote some of his best-known compositions,
including "Sequenza III" and "Folk Songs." Berio quickly established
himself as an iconoclast and provocateur, challenging conventional
notions of genre, orchestration and narrative.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1970s, he returned to Europe and became director of
Paris' electronic music hothouse IRCAM, the Institut de Recherche et
Coordination Acoustique Musique. Indeed, he's known for pushing
classical music into the realm of computers, tape recorders and other
nontraditional tools long before they were commonplace. At the same
time, Berio has long held an interest in traditional folk music. In
both cases, he's been driven by his desire to extend the use of the
human voice.</TE>
<TE>   Berio's works for the musical stage also rethink the relationship
between sound and text. They include "Opera," created with New York's
Living Theater, and "Un Re in Ascolta" (A King Listening), a
meta-theatrical reconsideration of a Prospero-like figure, with a
libretto by Italo Calvino. A recent opera, "Outis," uses fragments of
various texts in a meditation on the character of Ulysses.</TE>
<TE>   Reviewing the 1996 La Scala premiere of "Outis," Times music
critic Mark Swed wrote that "it breaks no new ground for Berio--one
immediately recognizes the composer's sound, a kind of ocean of
voices and instruments with ever-changing focus in which one
regularly gets lost and then finds oneself again. But it is the work
of a master, and it can hold the listener easily enthralled for its
two hours."</TE>
<TE>   Berio's latest project bridging past and present is the new
completion of "Turandot," which he tackled at the behest of conductor
Riccardo Chailly. The piece premiered in concert form in January,
with Chailly and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, at the Music
Festival of the Canary Islands. After L.A. Opera, it will be staged
at the Muziektheater in Amsterdam in June and the Salzburg Festival
in Austria in August.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a tendency to a fetishistic attitude to Puccini, so you
don't touch," Berio says. "Instead, if you go into the fabric of
'Turandot,' you realize how much Puccini suffered. Is that true that
he couldn't finish because he died, poor man, or because he had
problems to finish that opera with that libretto, which is really
offensive, the quality of the libretto? The opera is full of
contradictions, and so Puccini was tormented about it."</TE>
<TE>   In "Turandot," which is based on a play by 18th century Italian
playwright Carlo Gozzi, a steely Peking princess sets about avenging
a ravaged female ancestor by sending a gaggle of suitors to the
gallows for failing to answer her three riddles. A prince named Calaf
arrives with his father and their loyal slave Liu, who is secretly in
love with Calaf. He correctly answers Turandot's riddles, but she
still refuses him. Calaf then poses his own challenge, giving the
princess a single day to learn his name; if she succeeds, he will go
to his death. Liu is pressed to reveal Calaf's name but kills herself
instead, and Calaf conquers Turandot with a kiss. Finally assenting
to marriage, Turandot announces that the stranger's name is love.</TE>
<TE>   When Puccini died, the third act was still a sketch, in terms of
plot as well as music. He had already deviated from Gozzi's
story--the sympathetic character of the slave girl and her romantic
death were his additions. But then what? His notes left it a
cliffhanger: What would the future hold for Calaf and Turandot?</TE>
<TE>   Puccini's publisher, Riccordi, was not about to let a potential
cash cow languish. So with conductor Arturo Toscanini, Riccordi
commissioned composer Franco Alfano to write a finale. Unfortunately,
nobody was particularly pleased with the grandiose,
happily-ever-after results. Toscanini cut some 109 measures out of
Alfano's score before he would even premiere it. Still, that's the
version that's been playing opera houses since.</TE>
<TE>   The major contradiction comes from the addition of the character
Liu. "He needed to have a feminine presence that he could love,"
Berio says. "Musically it's beautiful, but dramaturgically, it
doesn't make any sense. She's killed, and just 30 seconds after that,
Calaf and Turandot are 'interacting,' so to speak.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't know what to do with Liu," Berio continues. "But if
you take Liu out, 'Turandot' is a very hard work, intense and very
often aggressive. And then at the end, you see Liu dies and nobody
cares about it. The story goes on, ignoring it completely. So you
cannot present such a musically warm, intense character and then,
pfffft!"</TE>
<TE>   Puccini left some 30 pages of sketches laying out possible
approaches to the third act, most of which Alfano ignored. It was in
these pages, however, that Berio found inspiration for his version.</TE>
<TE>   Berio also relied on germinal ideas in the score itself, including
a reference to Wagner's "Tristan and Isolde" in the first act.
"Wagner is always present," Berio says. "The first two measures
contain the Wagnerian chords, the elements that he develops later."</TE>
<TE>   Berio has created an ambiguous ending. "What Alfano did was
heavy-handed," Berio says. "I think it was Toscanini's fault too,
that he was convinced it should have a glorious rhetorical ending.
I'm convinced that Puccini wanted it to end quietly. All the premises
of 'Turandot,' they don't go to a resolution, an ending, happy or
unhappy. The sketches say a suspended ending, like a question mark."</TE>
<TE>   According to Nagano, "Berio's ending concludes as the final and
ultimate enigma ... this being in stark contrast to Mr. Alfano's
ending. The Berio finale is more organic. When asked recently whether
the ending sounds more like Berio or more like Puccini, the most
accurate answer I could think of was that the ending sounds more like
'Turandot.'"</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of the challenge of the new ending, L.A. Opera enlisted a
seasoned team, headed by veteran director Gian-Carlo del Monaco, with
Audrey Stottler in the title role and Franco Farina as Calaf. The
production is based on one Del Monaco did in 1991 for Leipzig Opera.</TE>
<TE>   "The big challenge in any 'Turandot' production is for a director
to work sensitively with the chorus, and Del Monaco is known as a
master with that kind of direction," says Edgar Baitzel, L.A. Opera
director of artistic operations. "His father [Mario del Monaco] was
one of the most famous Calafs of the last century. With his
background and tremendous experience directing Puccini operas, we are
confident that he was the right choice to bring the new ending to the
U.S."</TE>
<TE>   An added bonus is that L.A. Opera got the world premiere staging
of the ending. "The world premiere was supposed to be at La Scala,"
Baitzel says. "But Berio did not deliver on time. We were second or
third in line, in the lucky position of getting the premiere without
paying one dime."</TE>
<TE>   Berio's second commission from L.A. Opera, "The Coronation of
Poppea," also calls upon the composer to supply what's missing from
the original. Written in 1643, Monteverdi's final opera tells the
story of the emperor Nero, caught between his desire for the
power-hungry Poppea and his wife, Ottavia, who is driven to lethal
scheming by his infidelity.</TE>
<TE>   In the usual manner of Baroque composition, Monteverdi gave the
opera primarily a vocal line and a bass line. Contemporary
interpreters have supplied orchestrations that run the gamut from the
inappropriately lush to stripped-down "period practice." Berio is
expected to create something that will give a nod to Baroque
tradition but will also be contemporary.</TE>
<TE>   "Monteverdi was looking ahead at the same time he was very close
to his own past and close to his own present, and because of that
closeness, he could look into the future in a very new way," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "The libretto could have been given to Fellini to make a film. It
touches very heated subjects and at the same time with a great
elegance."</TE>
<TE>   Berio's plans are in keeping with that spirit. "I want to have a
very multifaceted presentation," he says. "The orchestra is very
strange--four saxophones. Sometimes the singers will be characterized
by a different way of singing, almost pop. There is going to be, I
don't say 'commercial' music, but mannerisms that today's audience
will recognize in the vocal technique."</TE>
<TE>   As Nagano sees it, that makes perfect sense. "It would only seem
normal that he contemplate respecting the provocative nature of
Monteverdi's score ... by incorporating the musical semantics of our
time."</TE>
<TE>   Even the final Berio-L.A. Opera project looks backward and
forward. It's brand new but based on a particular biography. "I was
very surprised when he came to me with the idea," Domingo says. "It
will be about all my musical career. So I could be remembering
certain moments, or having dialogues with composers and conductors
that I've worked with, and from history. There could be many
characters, but it might be a monologue--me having a conversation
with Wagner, Verdi, Mozart, Callas and different people across my
career. It could be the characters are real or you just hear them.
Something based on me, that's where we stand."</TE>
<TE>   Ask Berio to talk about the new opera, however, and he refuses.
"I'm going to do something, but it's too early to say, mostly because
I have massive respect for Placido," he says. Asked if there's a
librettist, he retorts with an only half-sarcastic, "No, I hate
librettists." All he will say is that "there will be a text, words,
fragments of a story maybe."</TE>
<TE>   Berio, having clearly spent what little patience he had for
questions, decides that the interview is over. He stands, gestures
across the room and offers another compensatory tidbit.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know who was the owner of this piano there?" he asks with
insistent bonhomie. "Franz Liszt."</TE>
<TE>   As if on cue, another visitor pops her head in the door. "In bocca
al lupo," she gushes, invoking the opera world equivalent of "break a
leg" to wish the maestro well for the opening of the new facility.
Berio then turns from the Liszt piano to his young colleague, from
the past to the future, and smiles.</TE>

<TE>   Sinfonia Varsovia</TE>
<TE>   Virgin Classics</TE>
<TE>   The young Polish pianist Piotr Anderszewski first came to wide
attention seven years ago as the fine accompanist for violinist
Viktoria Mullova on a Philips recording, followed by an excellent
solo Bach disc on Harmonia Mundi and an increasingly active concert
career. But none of that was preparation for Bruno Monsaingeon's
extraordinary film of Anderszewski (pronounced On-der-SHEV-ski)
brilliantly discussing and playing Beethoven's "Diabelli" Variations
that was released on video last year. Last month, Anderszewski was
named 2002 Gilmore Artist, a $300,000 award given every four years in
Michigan to a pianist judged not just an exceptional player, but also
an exceptionally interesting one.</TE>
<TE>   Here, in Anderszewski's latest recording, is an excellent example
of what all the excitement is about. I wouldn't have thought we
needed another recording of these two popular Mozart concertos. But
the stimulatingly alert performances, with Anderszewski conducting
the Sinfonia Varsovia, a Warsaw chamber orchestra, reminds us that
each generation discovers something new and marvelous in Mozart. For
any Mozart lover--or anyone who would like to become one--this CD is
a must.</TE>

<TE>   ELGAR</TE>
<TE>   "Enigma" Variations, "In the South,"</TE>
<TE>   Introduction and Allegro, "Sospiri"</TE>
<TE>   Vienna Philharmonic,</TE>
<TE>   John Eliot Gardiner, conductor</TE>
<TE>   Deutsche Grammophon</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   ELGAR</TE>
<TE>   "Nursery Suite," Serenade,</TE>
<TE>   "Dream Children," "In Moonlight,"</TE>
<TE>   Romance, "Sospiri," Elegy</TE>
<TE>   English Chamber Orchestra,</TE>
<TE>   Paul Goodwin, conductor</TE>
<TE>   Harmonia Mundi</TE>
<TE>   The Vienna Philharmonic has been recorded in some unlikely
matchups in recent years--Boulez conducting Bruckner, Stravinsky
under Maazel--and here comes another, as the increasingly
cosmopolitan John Eliot Gardiner tries his hand at Elgar. Alas, the
Introduction and Allegro often lacks thrust, and despite the
polished, translucent textures, you miss the depth of feeling and
nobility that many British orchestras pour into the "Enigma"
Variations. Yet it's a fascinating idea to turn the Viennese loose
upon "In the South," which blatantly takes its cues from Richard
Strauss. Listen to the unique way in which the Viennese play the
quiet "Canto popolare" in the center of the work, shimmering with
premonitions of "Der Rosenkavalier."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Goodwin's beautifully played selection of Elgar standards and
rarities opens with "Nursery Suite," a delightful, now-bustling,
now-melancholy series of vignettes based on material from the
73-year-old composer's childhood notebooks. The wistful, lyrical mood
persists throughout the program, anchored near the close with a
relaxed, curvaceously phrased performance of the Serenade.</TE>
<TE>   The two discs intersect in "Sospiri"--in which Gardiner/Vienna
find an anguished kinship with Mahler while Goodwin/English Chamber
let the sentiment speak for itself--and "In Moonlight," a
transcription of "Canto popolare" on Goodwin's disc.</TE>

<TE>   TOBY TWINING</TE>
<TE>   "Chrysalid Requiem"</TE>
<TE>   Toby Twining Music</TE>
<TE>   Cantaloupe</TE>
<TE>   Fresh ideas and practices are all too rare in the field of choral
writing, which lends composer Toby Twining a decided edge. As heard
on this satisfying and lucid new recording, his a cappella ensemble
freely blends the old with the new and with roads less traveled--in
this case, the traditional liturgical form of the requiem with the
ear-tweaking use of an ancient unorthodox tuning system, hocketing
(the practice of splitting one melodic line among many voices), the
ethereal timbral hum of throat singing, and sudden swarms of
polyphony. Along the hourlong path of the "Chrysalid Requiem,"
composed in 1999, there are references to Penderecki, Georgian vocal
tradition, medieval music and even a hint of Minimalism. Such an
eclectic approach could have yielded a disjointed postmodern
casserole, but this requiem is instead a thing of disarming beauty,
and a wholly personal statement.</TE>

<TE>   LIEBERSON</TE>
<TE>   "Raising the Gaze,"</TE>
<TE>   "Drala" and other works</TE>
<TE>   Asko Ensemble, Cleveland Orchestra,</TE>
<TE>   London Sinfonietta,</TE>
<TE>   Oliver Knussen, conductor</TE>
<TE>   Deutsche Grammophon</TE>
<TE>   "Raising the Gaze" is a six-minute, spiky, rhythmically uplifting
piece for seven instruments written in 1988 and inspired by medieval
dance music Peter Lieberson heard on the radio one day. The title
comes from Tibetan Buddhism; in meditation, it is sometimes OK to
relax a little and raise one's downcast gaze, the composer writes in
his notes on this 25-year survey of his music. Lieberson calls those
years a journey, and essentially what that journey has led him to is
a large-scale raising of his musical gaze, from late
Stravinsky-derived chamber scores to sumptuous big-orchestra pieces
full of color and Buddhist imagery. The highlight of the disc is
"Drala," a symphony from 1986. The word means "above war" in Tibetan
and the work represents in music a state of wakefulness said to be
brave but gentle, powerful but without aggression. Lieberson's
shifting, gentle, inspired harmonies, gorgeous stillnesses and
crackling dance rhythms are the musical equivalent of that elevated
state in which quiet and exhilaration are one and the same. The
Cleveland Orchestra plays wonderfully for Knussen, as do the
contemporary music groups from London and Amsterdam.</TE>

<TE>   RACHMANINOFF</TE>
<TE>   Piano Concerto No. 3</TE>
<TE>   SCRIABIN</TE>
<TE>   Selected Etudes</TE>
<TE>   Lang Lang, piano;</TE>
<TE>   St. Petersburg Philharmonic,</TE>
<TE>   Yuri Temirkanov, conductor</TE>
<TE>   Telarc</TE>
<TE>   Lang has all the virtuosity required for the monumental Rach 3
challenge, but prefers stressing its poetry and lyricism instead.
When the big guns need to be brought in, he can draw on them, but his
approach is gentle and inward, with many echoes of Chopin and Ravel.
Temirkanov must approve. The conductor also avoids the cannons and
the schmaltz.</TE>
<TE>   Lang takes the same moonlit approach in 10 selected Scriabin
Etudes, preferring delicacy, color and control over sheer virtuosity,
although no one can play these pieces who's lacking in that area. In
this live recording, made at a Proms concert last year in the Royal
Albert Hall, London, you can hear Lang announcing a Chinese folk song
as his single encore. Unfortunately, the folk element gets drowned in
a rather syrupy arrangement. The Etudes were recorded at Oberlin
College.</TE>

<TE>   RICHARD STRAUSS</TE>
<TE>   11 Lieder, and Four Last Songs</TE>
<TE>   Soile Isokoski, soprano;</TE>
<TE>   Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester</TE>
<TE>   Berlin, Marek Janowski, conductor</TE>
<TE>   Ondine</TE>
<TE>   Finnish soprano Isokoski lives up to her burgeoning
reputation--she made her Metropolitan Opera debut early this year and
has sung in major houses in Europe. This album is composed of
glorious music, gloriously performed by the soprano and the sometimes
overplaying Berlin Radio Orchestra. Isokoski's silvery voice is
perfectly suited to this repertory, and she sings it with variety and
command. Her quirky German is sometimes bothersome, along with a
quick vibrato and some ignoring of words. But these are quibbles; the
songs are musical gold, and the singing is, most often, golden.
Janowski supports the singer fully. (Incidentally, "Morgen" and
"Zueignung" still sound better in the original, unorchestrated, piano
versions.)</TE>

<TE>   "Der Muller und der Bach"</TE>
<TE>   (arranged by Liszt)</TE>
<TE>   Arcadi Volodos, piano</TE>
<TE>   Sony Classical</TE>
<TE>   Even Volodos' previous recordings, with all their astounding
technical brilliance and clarity, could not predict the authority and
seriousness of his Schubert. The Russian virtuoso shines in this
style, reveling in its simple directness and unadorned sentiment. And
he does not merely conquer the many difficulties in the writing; he
has fun with them. The early Sonata in E is bucolic, tuneful,
deceptively unsophisticated; Volodos lets its charms resonate. The
late Sonata in G breathes an atmosphere of repose and resignation,
yet keeps yearning, actively, through its considerable length; the
pianist reflects all moods specifically and compellingly. The world's
fastest fingers have a heart, and a soul, and the ability to share.</TE>

<DH>A dormant 1955 building in downtown L.A. is transformed
into a hotel that Austin Powers would love</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGH HART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The view of downtown Los Angeles from the vibrating waterbed perched
on the roof of Andre Balazs' new hotel is stunning. Arco Plaza, the
Citicorp Building, the Los Angeles Central Library's ceramic tile
roof and Flower Street pedways all jostle for attention, as does the
twisted tower atop the phone company building that looks like
something straight out of a 1950s sci-fi B movie.</LD>
<LD>   "The whole thing is so Jetsons," says Balazs, marveling at the
vista from the Astro Turfed outdoor bar area. "When you're up here,
you see a helicopter fly past, it's just all ... it's so much more
optimistic than the way New York feels right now, you know? This
perspective is just remarkable."</LD>
<LD>   But will people show up to enjoy the view? Balazs will find out
soon enough. Working with the Santa Monica firm Koning Eizenberg
Architecture, Balazs has spent the past 26 months renovating a 1955
office building at Flower and 6th streets. The 207-room Standard
Downtown opens this month. Balazs is gambling that downtown Los
Angeles is ready for a medium-priced hotel (rooms start at $95)
geared to hip young business travelers.</LD>
<TE>   From the moment Balazs laid eyes on the 12-story building, he knew
there was a hotel in the making. "I was on my way to the airport one
day going back to New York, and someone told me I had to stop here,
so I swung by and immediately thought it was the most stunning work,"
Balazs says. "What I think is so unusual about it is there's a pride
of authorship, a distinguished character that you find in a lot of
owner-developed buildings. It has details that I've only seen in
places like Rockefeller Center."</TE>
<TE>   The proud owner, Balazs soon learned, had been California oil
baron and philanthropist W.M. Keck, who commissioned Claud
Beelman--designer of the nearby Art Deco Garfield Building--to create
the Modernist headquarters for his Superior Oil Co. The building was
occupied by a bank, then lay dormant for nine years.</TE>
<TE>   "Walking through the building was kind of fascinating" Balazs
recalls. "Some of the offices still had desks and paper. It was like
a ghost building." By the time he bought the property early in 2000,
Balazs, 45, had successfully transformed several other old buildings
into chic, celebrity-friendly lodgings. In 1990, he took over the
legendary but decrepit Chateau Marmont on Sunset Boulevard, gradually
restoring it to pristine condition.</TE>
<TE>   He spent eight years overhauling a 19th century SoHo warehouse
before wowing New York fashionistas with the sleek Mercer Hotel in
1998. A year later, Miami-based Architectonica gave a playfully
minimalist make-over to a nondescript 1964 building Balazs had
purchased on the Sunset Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Rechristened the Standard, the hotel--with its upside-down sign,
Andy Warhol-patterned curtains, orange bathroom fixtures and
shag-carpeted lobby ceiling--has become destination lodging for
fashion-forward, budget-conscious travelers.</TE>
<TE>   For his new venture, Balazs wanted to apply the Standard's sly
aesthetic to the new setting by dressing the building's essentially
conservative bones in blasts of color, cheeky pop culture references
and irreverent riffs on corporate culture. Strolling across the
lobby's dark-green marble floor, preserved from the original
structure, Balazs says, "I always approach the starting point of a
hotel as this sort of archaeology, where you start digging around to
figure out: Where are we?</TE>
<TE>   "What is 'downtown'? Who are the denizens, and what's going on in
the area? Then, coupled with the building itself, you develop a kind
of vocabulary for what you want to do," he says. "I always approach a
hotel first and foremost with where it's located. And if it's a rehab
like this, you take a look at what you have to work with, and where
do you take it? So we asked ourselves: What is fun about this?"</TE>
<TE>   Among the inspirational details, which Balazs left intact: a row
of glass-tubed clocks that provide times in London, Tehran, Calcutta
and other cities. "What a picture of optimism about worldwide
enterprise that is, right?" Balazs says. "So this then starts to
inform the spirit of the lobby." Around the corner near the check-in
desk, Balazs points toward a semi-abstract stainless steel map of the
world. It's dotted with pulsing pink lights supposedly representing
the vast global reach of his company, Standard Holdings.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a fantasy," Balazs says with a laugh, "But this is what
corporations really do. [By creating this] world map of far-flung
holdings sort of inspired by [Italian Modernist designer] Gio Ponti,
we asked ourselves, 'If you're really going to play in this corporate
world, how do you stylize it?' You can do it a little bit tongue in
cheek."</TE>
<TE>   To crank up the impact of the new hotel's lobby, furniture
designer Vladimir Kagan was commissioned to create an extremely pink
150-foot-long sofa punctuated by segments 4 feet off the ground to
facilitate exhibitionists interested, as Balazs says, in "striking a
pose." The building's original load-bearing columns have been
sheathed in glass to enhance the sense of spectacle Balazs likes to
create. "It's for the people watching, the views, the angles, the
voyeuristic aspect, which is part of why people enjoy hotel lobbies:
You live there, but at the same time it is public space."</TE>
<TE>   Suspended from the ceiling, in homage to the era of
corporate-sponsored abstract art, hangs a mobile that Balazs says is
"obviously in the spirit of Calder." Other nontraditional lobby
amenities include a pool table, a photo booth, a 1970s-era funky
white organ intended to be a kitschy riff on the standard piano bar,
and a barbershop named Flint--as in the campy, 1966 James Coburn spy
flick, "Our Man Flint."</TE>
<TE>   Balazs called on interior designer Shawn Hausman, a onetime movie
set designer whose credits include "The People Vs. Larry Flynt," to
inject jolts of color throughout, beginning with the ground-floor
restaurant practically aflame in egg-yolk yellow. Hausman, who has
collaborated with Balazs on his other Los Angeles hotels, also
tracked down the bright red '70s-era fiberglass pods that house the
rooftop water beds and urged Kagan to upholster his hyper-sofa in hot
pink. "I really fought for that pink," Hausman says. "It's important
that everything isn't too masculine."</TE>
<TE>   Hausman collaborated with Balazs on the original Standard and says
that bold color choice is one unifying element of the two hotels.</TE>
<TE>   But there's no pat formula, Hausman says. "Andre's always open to
experimentation, always trying to come up with different approaches
that combine humor and sophistication. It's not specifically about a
period but is really more about doing something in the spirit of what
a place feels like. And I think there's a consistency about having an
element of sophisticated fun without being too over the top."</TE>
<TE>   For architect Hank Koning, finding fresh possibilities in a
relatively rigid framework required resourceful thinking. He created
a new entrance set off from the street, since city regulations
prohibit parked cars on Flower or 6th streets; transformed the cube
structure that once housed the building's cooling and heating
machinery into the rooftop bar; and took advantage of the building's
off-center elevator core by crafting NBA rooms, so-called because the
proportions are unusually long.</TE>
<TE>   "The big challenge was working within the constraints of an
existing building," says Koning, whose clients have included the
Avalon Hotel in Beverly Hills and the Standard's Sunset Boulevard
rival the Mondrian Hotel. "It's been designated a cultural-historic
landmark by the city of Los Angeles, so there were things you really
couldn't touch."</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, Koning says, the building had exceptionally
strong infrastructure: "It was designated an essential-services
building, so it was extremely sturdy, built on solid rock."</TE>
<TE>   Balazs and his team continued the corporate-but-sexy theme
established in the public spaces into the rooms themselves. He
explains, "If the role model for the lobby might be John DeLorean,
the rogue CEO who's got a lot of style, long hair, good-looking
girls, then in the rooms, we're sort of playing with that notion of
bachelor chic." The desk has no drawers. The closets have no door,
utilizing instead a curtain made of the same kind of mesh material
used for sports jerseys. And in place of chairs, Balazs says, the
platform framing the bed serves as an informal sitting area.</TE>
<TE>   "Playboy in the '60s did an interesting article about the perfect
bachelor pad," Balazs says. "The idea was that it would be ultimately
this hugely sensual and efficient space where the bed was a living
platform; you'd have your controls and your stereo. Everything was
right there, so we started to play with that."</TE>
<TE>   Showers have a "modesty curtain" and a see-through glass window
facing the sleeping quarters. Bathrooms are something Balazs spends a
lot of time thinking about. "I obsess about stuff like this all the
time," he says. "Business travelers--they've done studies--70% of
their waking hours in the room are spent in the bath area, so you
want to make it comfortable as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Those glass shower stalls also are aimed at providing some
romantic sizzle for couples that Balazs hopes to attract on weekends,
when business travel is light. In corner rooms, the showers face
straight through the glass window onto the street. "The trick is to
maximize, build upon what you can," Balazs says. "In this case,
you've got a corner room, and we decided it would be really
interesting to play with the light...." Balazs suddenly pulls up the
blinds, revealing the building on the other side of 6th Street.
"That's one hell of a sexy shower!" He smiles.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," Balazs continues, "the Standard is a business hotel. It's
meant to be a place to do business, albeit for a new generation of
businessperson. But once we make sure the room has a generous working
area, and a view, and it's well lit, then we can start to play with
the thing."</TE>
<TE>   Balazs, dressed for two days running in black pants, black shoes
and white shirt, comes off as remarkably even-keeled given the
pressures of preparing a major new hotel. Then again, Balazs says
that creating new projects is what he likes to do best. The son of
Hungarian emigres who taught at Harvard University, Balazs studied
architecture briefly at Cornell University before switching to
Columbia University, where he earned an MBA in journalism and
business. He sculpted for a while and nearly enrolled at Rhode Island
School of Design, but instead started a biotech company in 1980, made
a fortune and began investing in Manhattan nightclubs. In 1985, he
married Katie Ford, president of Ford Models Inc. They have two
daughters and live in a SoHo loft near the Mercer.</TE>
<TE>   Balazs' gift for anticipating the Next Big Thing is not
infallible--the short-lived Los Angeles nightclub BC comes to
mind--but he hits the mark far more often than not. So will downtown
L.A. be the next SoHo?</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of boosterism going on," Balazs says, "and I
endorse all of that. But the idea of doing this was not predicated on
some expectation that there would be a booming revival of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think there's more than a glimmer of a changing culture,
between loft renovations, fashion, the art scene. So I think it's a
very dynamic time, but who knows? It happened in SoHo, on Prince
Street where we're on, it didn't have a single store--shortly after
the Mercer Hotel opened, even while it was under construction, these
little boutiques started springing up, to the point where, now to the
chagrin of those of us who live there, the galleries have gone and
the shops are everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this area is truly spectacular, an undiscovered sort of
niche in Los Angeles that I think people ought to come down and take
a look at."</TE>
<TE>   With Walt Disney Concert Hall under construction just down the
street, and the nearby Los Angeles Convention Center, and of course
Staples Center, the Standard Downtown may well prove to be the right
inn at the right time.</TE>
<TE>   But hit or miss, Balazs' latest operation will at the very least
turn on its head the travel industry truism about no surprise being
the best surprise of all. Says Koning about his client: "I travel a
lot, and at most business hotels, it's the same old-same old. Working
with Andre, the one thing you're not going to end up doing is
something boring. If it's boring, you can check that right off the
list."</TE>

<DH>With 'Pentecost,' playwright David Edgar packs his big
ideas about world politics into a 99-seat theater</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA ISENBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>British playwright David Edgar is a storyteller who thinks big--big
ideas, big stories, big casts. Sometimes his dramatic tales are
traditional, like his Tony-winning adaptation of Charles Dickens'
"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby." And sometimes they're
unsettling, like "Pentecost," his contemporary hostage drama packed
with art history, terrorism and global politics.</LD>
<LD>   It took the resources of the Ahmanson Theatre to bring "Nickleby"
to Los Angeles in 1986, but the 28-character, 11-language "Pentecost"
opens this weekend at the 99-seat Evidence Room, just west of
downtown Los Angeles. "I knew somebody was going to do it here, and I
wanted it to be us," says the theater company's artistic director,
Bart DeLorenzo. "He happened to write a play so interesting that
every theater in the country would want to do it, but so complicated
that most can't."</LD>
<TE>   Winner of London's Evening Standard Award as best play of 1995,
"Pentecost" is the second of three Edgar plays set in central Europe
after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The play starts with art
historians and others debating whether a fresco unearthed in an
abandoned church could predate Giotto's early 14th century
"Lamentation," which would challenge the artwork's pivotal position
in the history of Western art. But their discussion changes
considerably when a multicultural band of terrorists and refugees
takes over the church and holds the art historians--and the
fresco--hostage.</TE>
<TE>   "'Pentecost' is a whodunit, or more accurately, a whodidit,"
explains Edgar, 54, reached at his home in Birmingham, England.
"Events of the last year have demonstrated that life can be like a
thriller. We see the world through genres--thrillers, whodunits,
siege stories, crime stories, romances--which is why those genres
came to be in the first place. It's a way of making sense of real
experience."</TE>
<TE>   He notes that "Pentecost" offers "guns, explosions, suspense and
other delights," but those delights are just the top layer. "Most of
my plays are about dealing with disillusionment of one sort or
another," says Edgar, one of the most prominent left-wing playwrights
who emerged in the late '60s and early '70s. "I think we have to deal
with a world in which those great ideals have been found very
wanting."</TE>
<TE>   The Evidence Room's barn of a space has been turned into
"Pentecost's" abandoned church, where actors are moving into place at
a recent rehearsal. One terrorist is up on a ladder, looking out
church windows for police helicopters or maybe a television van.
Another idly flicks a cigarette lighter on and off. Their female
colleague, a stateless Palestinian, talks at the bound hostages, her
conversation laced with disparaging words for Western culture.</TE>
<TE>   "He fleshes us out as real people, not just arguments," says Leo
Marks, who plays one of the hostages, an American art historian. "I
don't know who else is writing plays with so many voices where the
audience can understand the wildly diverging viewpoints and find
sympathy for just about all of them."</TE>
<TE>   The playwright once said he wanted to be "a secretary for the
times through which I'm living," and he has long done just that on
stage and, to a lesser degree, for TV ("The Eagle Has Landed" in 1973
and 1982's "Nicholas Nickleby"), radio and film (1986's "Lady Jane").
Aside from a brief post-college stint as a journalist, he's been
writing plays full time since the '70s. His subject matter has
frequently been political extremism--on the left as well as the
right--and its consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar came from a theatrical family--his parents met while working
at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in the '30s--but his study of
drama at Manchester University often took a back seat to the
political turmoil around him. "I was in my second year in 1968," he
recalls, "and I think I paid much more time to what was going on in
politics than in drama.</TE>
<TE>   "I was caught up in one of the last moments of radical idealism in
the 20th century," he continues. "Having seen both the successes and
the failures, the achievements and the limitations, I have constantly
been trying to look at the way people deal with having been involved
in these great movements for the rest of their lives."</TE>
<TE>   One of those great movements changed with the fall of the Berlin
Wall in 1989. Edgar had made many trips to Eastern Europe in the
'80s, and when the wall came down in 1989, he took the new world
order as his theatrical subject matter. "The ideals that I understood
were dying," he says. "I felt it important to write about that."</TE>
<TE>   The result was "The Shape of the Table," his 1990 play about the
shifting of power for a former government in the Eastern Bloc. He
wrote it "fairly instantly," he says, and it premiered just "one day
less than a year" after the wall came down.</TE>
<TE>   It was, he says, a time "when people were very confident that
national boundaries were a thing of the past. But pretty soon, it
seemed almost the reverse of that was happening. Eastern European
countries were splitting up into ever smaller units, each with its
own currency, flag and national anthem. Perhaps even worse, many of
those countries started discriminating against their own minorities.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, it seemed that communism wasn't giving way to some great
new, liberal super-national United States of Europe, but giving way
to old fashioned ancient nationalisms," he says. "Having demolished
one wall in the middle of Europe, all kinds of walls were being built
a little farther to the east. And those walls weren't to keep people
in, but to keep people out."</TE>
<TE>   Passionate about world politics--he regularly writes political
commentary for British newspapers--Edgar is passionate, too, about
his craft. In 1989, he founded and ran Britain's first postgraduate
playwriting course, at the University of Birmingham, where he
remained until 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar praises such contemporary American plays as David Mamet's
"Oleanna" and Tony Kushner's "Angels in America," saying, for
instance, that when "Angels in America" was done in Britain, "people
were thinking, 'Isn't this brilliant, deft combination of the
personal and political what we're supposed to be so good at?'"</TE>
<TE>   The playwright has visited the U.S. many times in the last 25
years, created several American characters, and even written a
musical about Watergate (1974's "Dick Deterred"). It was probably
only a matter of time until he wrote an epic about American politics,
something he is working on. That project, "The Continental Divide,"
follows a six-week research trip across California that Edgar made
last fall.</TE>
<TE>   The two plays that make up "Continental Divide" are set in the
"imminent present" and revolve around a gubernatorial election. His
Democratic candidate is female, and the Republican, he hints, isn't
unlike the Republican candidates in  California's recent primary
election. Its locale, he adds, is "pretty obviously a large West
Coast state with very different northern and southern bits. But I
never use the word California."</TE>
<TE>   The plays will be jointly produced by Berkeley Repertory Theatre
and the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, and will be directed
in both places by Tony Taccone, Berkeley Rep's artistic director.
"David really is a student of international politics," says Taccone,
who earlier directed productions of "Pentecost" in both theaters.
"And any student of international politics is going to look to the
United States as the fulcrum of the world's power struggles."</TE>
<TE>   "Daughters of the Revolution" and "Mothers Against" will open
Ashland's 2003 season in February, then launch Berkeley Rep's new
season in September 2003. Each theater, says Edgar, "was kind enough
to ask me to write a new play. But the idea of writing two plays for
two theaters 6,000 miles from where I live--I thought it would never
get done. I thought a grand project would."</TE>
<TE>   Director Michael Attenborough, who oversaw London productions of
"Shape of the Table," "Pentecost" and last year's "The Prisoner's
Dilemma," the third play in Edgar's trilogy, says he's not surprised
that Edgar is taking on American politics. "He's an enormously sharp
observer, and his eye should be roving everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   It was, after all, Edgar's observational skills that led to the
Evidence Room production of "Pentecost." "The company was thinking
about a play that dealt with internationalism and what's the beef in
the world these days," DeLorenzo says. "When I read it, I couldn't
imagine a better piece to explore these issues and basically put on
stage the conversation happening at every dining table in America."</TE>
<TE>   For DeLorenzo, "Nicholas Nickleby" and "Pentecost" actually have
something in common beyond their shared playwright. "Edgar's strength
is being able to create a play of ideas that is immensely
entertaining," he says. "You don't notice the ideas so much until you
get home and want to talk about them."</TE>

<LD>Betty Garrett feels a lot of good karma surrounding Theatre West's
production of "Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology," which
opened on Garrett's 83rd birthday Thursday. Garrett, who appeared in
the original production of "Spoon River" four decades ago, is
directing the revival, which features longtime Theatre West members
Lee Meriwether and Bridget Hanley. Musical director and supervisor
Naomi Caryl, also an original cast member, wrote the music.</LD>
<LD>   "We have some wonderful coincidences in this whole production,"
Garrett says during a recent interview with Hanley, Caryl and
Meriwether in her woodsy Studio City home. "Lee is doing the part she
understudied. Drew Katzman, who is playing Actor No. 1, is married to
Jane George, the actress who plays the Girl Singer. And my son,
Andrew Parks, is understudying Abbott Alexander." Alexander, she
explains, just happens to be the son of Philip Abbott, who starred in
the 10th anniversary production of "Spoon River."</LD>
<TE>   "Spoon River" was first produced at Theatre West in 1962, before
moving to UCLA. It then went to Broadway in late 1963. The show,
which put the fledgling Theatre West on the map, was conceived,
adapted and arranged by the late Charles Aidman, a Theatre West
co-founder. Based on the poems of Edgar Lee Masters, the musical
drama revolves around the dead in an Illinois graveyard who talk
about their lives. Most of the characters and experiences were based
on people Masters knew growing up in Lewiston and Petersburg, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   "What Chuck did with the poems was so wonderful," Garrett says.
"If you see the book of poems, it is just one poem after the other.
What Chuck did was gather the poems together in such a way you saw
the connections between the people and you begin to get a vision of
this whole town of people and their interrelations with each other."</TE>
<TE>   Theatre West began its life with a meeting of six people including
Aidman, Curt Conway and Joyce Van Patten. "As a matter of fact, I was
asked to be at the first meeting, which was at a place over in
Hollywood," recalls Garrett, who starred in such classic MGM musicals
as "On the Town" and "Take Me Out to the Ballgame." "It was a
pouring, rainy night, and I couldn't find the apartment. I always
regret I wasn't at the very first meeting. But I was at the next
one."</TE>
<TE>   After doing workshops of various shows and scenes at locales
around town, they found their first real home in a tiny theater on
Robertson Boulevard. "That's where we started working on 'Spoon
River,'" Garrett said. Theatre West moved to its current location on
Cahuenga Boulevard West in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Meriwether joined the group about seven months after its
inception. "I got in by going to a bar," says the former Miss America
who later became known as Catwoman in the 1966 film "Batman." "I was
doing a play or something, and after the show we ended up going to a
bar. And there I saw Curt Conway. I had studied with Curt in New
York. He said to me, 'We've got this great workshop.'"</TE>
<TE>   Hanley became a member of the troupe in 1973. "I was lucky enough
to get three people to write me a letter of recommendation, and I
joined," she says. "The night I came in, it was just packed. I was
just in awe. It has been the most incredibly creative home anyone who
could ask for."</TE>
<TE>   "She's used the workshop better than anyone," says Garrett,
glancing over at Hanley. "She's done so many creative things that
originated with her. I did my one-woman show there. I first got up
just trying to get something out of my system. I wanted to do a few
songs, and everybody encouraged me to go further. The next thing, I
had a two-hour, one-woman show I have taken all over the United
States and London."</TE>
<TE>   Garrett believes there is no place other than Theatre West in Los
Angeles that's conducive to experiment and work on various pieces.</TE>
<TE>   The actress teaches a musical comedy workshop there on Wednesday
nights, and Meriwether says she occasionally attends. Over the years,
Meriwether has worked on such musicals as "Mame," "Hello, Dolly! and
"Follies" under Garrett's guidance at the workshop.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of "Spoon River," Caryl relates that Aidman, who died
in 1993, had loved Masters' poetry since his college days and would
perform poems at workshops</TE>
<TE>   Garrett became involved with "Spoon River" because of another
play, "Anne of the Thousand Days." She had been bugging Aidman to do
some scenes with her from the play, but Aidman, she says, was always
too busy to play Henry VIII to her Anne.</TE>
<TE>   "One day I walked into theater and said, 'Are you ready to do
"Anne of the Thousand Days"?' He said, 'I'll tell you what--I'll do
that if you do this for me.' It was the 'Spoon River' poems. We never
did 'Anne of the Thousand Days.'"</TE>
<TE>   Caryl, who served as stage manager for the workshops before
becoming a cast member, recalls the first performance of poems, which
lasted about 25 minutes. "It was just stunning," she says. A few days
later, she got a call from Aidman. "He said, 'I hear you sing.' He
wanted to have a folk song at the beginning. I said it had to be on
tape because I don't perform live anymore. The only folk song I
really knew was 'He's Gone Away,' which is a traditional song. It was
the perfect piece. That's the way the show still opens."</TE>
<TE>   Director Lamont Johnson, who was involved with the theater group
at UCLA that later became Center Theatre Group, caught some of the
early "Spoon River" performances. "He got very excited about it,"
Caryl says. "He encouraged Chuck to expand it and have more music."</TE>
<TE>   Caryl recalls going home, playing music on the piano and thinking,
'This is very 'Spoon River-y.' I brought a piece in one day, and
Chuck got all excited and wanted to write words to it. A lot of the
original songs came that way. The other songs came from
research--looking for things that fit the time period or fit some of
the poems. It was one of the most exciting and creative experiences I
ever had."</TE>
<TE>   Because the show has only four actors, each cast member plays up
to 18 citizens of "Spoon River." To differentiate among characters,
the actors make subtle changes with props, like adding a bandanna or
a pair of glasses. The transformation, says Garrett, "is all visible
to the audience. Except for the lights, which focus on the person
actually reciting, the person is right there changing in front of
you. There is a whole technique to that which I have impressed on all
the cast members--when you do it, you become invisible; you do
everything very slowly so it doesn't distract."</TE>
<TE>   "Spoon River" ran for more than 100 performances on Broadway in
late 1963 and early '64. "We were supposed to go for a four-week
concert tour, but we got such rave reviews," Garrett says. "What's
unusual is that we got good reviews because the New York critics for
some reason or another seem to be down on anything that comes from
this coast."</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times called the show "a brooding and loving American
folk poem brought to life on stage ... [that] has been transmuted
into a glowing theater experience." The New York World-Telegram and
Sun proclaimed that the actors had "done right and more than right by
Masters, by his volume of discerning, biographical verse....The small
town folk he wrote about have never seemed more alive, more
explicitly present, or more warmly welcome."</TE>
<TE>   "It really is a genuine masterpiece," Meriwether says. "Each
person who sees it will find at least 50% of the show they can relate
to, in one way or another. It touches on all different levels--your
heart and your brain and your soul."</TE>
<TE>   "Spoon River" has even more relevance since the events of Sept.
11. "I think people are sort of seeing some sort of balance and some
kind of getting down to humanity instead of technical things,"
Garrett says.</TE>
<TE>   "In 'Spoon River,' these are people who are all dead, but what
they are doing is revealing themselves as they never could in life,"
the actress says. "I think that's so meaningful when someone comes
out and says, 'I was wrong and I did this and I did that.' It is the
outpouring of their feelings, I think, that makes people relate to
it."</TE>

<DH>The rise in captioned movies is a boon to hearing-impaired
fans. But advocates are pushing for more.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN SMITH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outgoing and friendly, Doug Muir, a 44-year-old government employee
from Anaheim, used to go to the movies by himself. Born with what
would become progressive hearing loss, he understood only bits and
pieces of the dialogue. He didn't want to depend on companions to
translate for him. One solution was to go to foreign films, where he
could follow the subtitles; or else he might wait, up to a year in
some cases, for a movie to be captioned and released in video.</LD>
<LD>   But that's starting to change. Recently Muir joined dozens of deaf
and hard of hearing people at an open-captioned screening of "The
Scorpion King," the popular action movie, at the AMC 30 in Orange.
Unlike closed captions for TV, which display translations triggered
by an electronic signal, every word of dialogue appeared as subtitles
under the character speaking. Even background noises significant to
the plot--whistle, grunt--were subtitled.</LD>
<LD>   In the lobby afterward, fingers flew as new and old acquaintances
greeted one another in sign language. Even those who didn't care for
action films were happy to have seen a recent hit movie, be able to
understand it, and know they could come back any day of the year and
watch an open-captioned film with hearing friends or family if they
felt like it. "It feels great to have choices," Muir said.</LD>
<TE>   The increase of first-run open-captioned movies over the past
several years has meant more than just entertainment to the estimated
28 million hearing-impaired Americans. Patrons and advocates say it
has helped chip away at the isolation many endure. In the AMC lobby,
Kathy Ivankay, a retired bookkeeper and independent living instructor
for the deaf, said she and her husband of 36 years used to stay home
watching TV or videos because of their hearing problems. Now, she
said, "we're dating again."</TE>
<TE>   Widespread distribution of first-run open-captioned films is
credited largely to Burbank-based Tripod Captioned Films, a nonprofit
organization with Hollywood connections.</TE>
<TE>   In association with 10 studios and 35 theater chains, Tripod
distributes open-captioned versions of new releases to deaf and hard
of hearing audiences in the U.S., Canada and Australia. The studios
provide the captioned prints, the result of an estimated two-week,
$7,500-per-print process, and ship them.</TE>
<TE>   Tripod--an offshoot of the Tripod School, which provides
communication programs for deaf children--markets the films by
identifying audiences, arranging special screenings in some cases,
and training studios and theaters how to advertise to ensure the
seats are filled.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike television, neither movie studios nor theaters are required
by law to provide captioning for patrons.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the natural leaders who had entry to both the film
industry and the deaf and hard of hearing communities," Tripod
executive director Nanci Linke-Ellis said. "It was a rather organic
moment of serendipity."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1993, the voluntary partnership of advocates, studios and
theaters has increased the public showings of first-run films like "A
Beautiful Mind" and "Mission: Impossible 2" from zero to more than 50
films shown in 500 cities last year. Persuading studios and theaters
to recognize the untapped audience has been an "uphill battle," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Most theaters still screen the open-captioned films sporadically
and at odd times. Only five, including the AMC theater in Orange,
show them every day on screens dedicated solely to captioned films.
Advocates say there are not enough captioned prints and not enough
theaters showing them at convenient times to meet the demand.</TE>
<TE>   "The growth in the number of cities sounds phenomenal until you
consider that today not a single city in the U.S. is showing an
open-captioned version of the new blockbuster 'Spider-Man,'" said
Cheryl Heppner, chairwoman of the Coalition for Movie Captioning,
which draws representatives from the nation's top advocacy groups for
the deaf and hard of hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "A colleague visiting New York City went looking for an
open-captioned movie and could find only one--playing at 10 a.m. on a
Sunday," said Tim Creagan, vice chairman of the coalition. "It shows
you the distribution leaves a little bit to be desired."</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, Tripod distributes films to theaters in 16
cities (see box on page 24).</TE>
<TE>   Vans Stevenson, senior vice president of the Motion Picture Assn.
of America, said the studios are sensitive to the captioning issue.
"Can it get better? Yes. Are studios moving in that direction?
There's progress.... It's an evolutionary process."</TE>
<TE>   Some theaters are experimenting with other techniques, such as
Rear Window Captioning. That system, developed by WGBH Educational
Foundation in Boston, displays reversed captions on a light-emitting
diode, or LED, text display mounted in the rear of a theater. Patrons
use panels attached to their seats to reflect the captions so that
they appear superimposed on or beneath the movie screen. The
reflective panels are portable, and used only by the caption user;
hearing patrons do not see the captions, so the caption user can sit
anywhere in the theater.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Watkins, a WGBH media access specialist, said the public
broadcasting station has pioneered technology in rear window and open
captioning as well as a combined system that describes action,
costumes and settings for the blind.</TE>
<TE>   The combined systems are now available at 32 locations in Canada
and the U.S., including the Bridge theater in Los Angeles, and the
AMC theater in Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   The benefits, tangible and intangible, of an ordinary outing to
the movies are huge to the deaf and hard of hearing. Popular culture
is rife with references to movies, and those without access
experience the pain of a child who is always picked last for the
team, said the coalition's Creagan, a lawyer who has been hard of
hearing since birth.</TE>
<TE>   "Through captioning, you feel like part of the audience. You laugh
with everybody else. You cry with everybody else. You're included,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brandie Aguado, a young mother and lifelong movie fan whose
hearing was damaged by spinal meningitis when she was 1, said she is
no longer frustrated by having to ask her mother and sisters what's
going on during a film.</TE>
<TE>   Enthralled by "Scorpion King" star the Rock, she was seeing the
movie for the second time. During the show, she and a girlfriend
nudged each other and laughed when scantily clad women in a bazaar
called out to the brawny character, "Hey, soldier, those big muscles
look cramped. We can help you."</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, captions add information that isn't in the original
product, Creagan said.</TE>
<TE>   One advertisement, for instance, explained in the captions that
the background music had been composed by Aaron Copland. A "Star
Trek" caption revealed a character's first name, giving a hard of
hearing person the edge in a trivia contest.</TE>
<TE>   Captioned films allow deaf parents to monitor the movies their
hearing children watch; they also let families with hearing and deaf
members go out together to a show.</TE>
<TE>   "The best experience I had was when my son was 9 and saw 'Raiders
of the Lost Ark,'" said Megan Williams, a documentary filmmaker from
Los Angeles. "He had seen it without subtitles, then a special
screening with captions. When he came out of that theater, he was
radiant. His hands were flying a mile a minute. 'Did you know his
dog's name was Indiana?' 'Did you know they were looking for the Holy
Grail?' It was so exciting for him to be able to comprehend it," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Tripod Captioned Films evolved from the advocacy of Williams and
film producer Michael Shamberg, parents of a deaf son, Jacob. They
had started several programs at Tripod School, which is now part of
the Burbank Unified School District. To raise funds for their
projects, they held a premiere in 1983 at the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences with captioned and non-captioned versions
of Shamberg's film "The Big Chill."</TE>
<TE>   The showing generated so much excitement that they took the
captioned print, and others following subsequent annual benefits, on
a nationwide tour.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Barbara Montan, wife of a Disney executive, and
Linke-Ellis, a hearing-impaired administrator, joined forces to
obtain more prints and more showings.</TE>
<TE>   "We were really lucky," Williams said. "Studios were very generous
in helping us get films captioned and shipping them, especially in
the early days when we didn't have a structure for it. It was just an
idea."</TE>
<TE>   Now, coalition chief Heppner said, studios and theaters are under
new economic pressures, and are resisting expansion to year-round
dedicated screens or regular screenings of captioned films. "The
movie studios and theater owners understandably want to maximize
their profits. They claim that open captioning has a negative effect
on box office sales because people find the captions distracting. Our
coalition contends that no formal or independent studies or testing
support this claim," Heppner said.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, advocates for the hearing impaired lost a bid to
force Oregon theaters to provide captioning. Now the coalition is
encouraging states to require captioning in theaters. So far, only
Connecticut has addressed the issue. As a result of public hearings,
Creagan said a statewide trial program, in which theaters with more
than 10 screens voluntarily show captioned movies regularly, is still
in effect.</TE>
<TE>   In Creagan's view, captions are like wheelchair ramps--an
accommodation that able-bodied people eventually accepted. People are
already getting used to captioning on television sets at home and in
restaurants, health clubs, bars and other noisy public places, he
said. Museums and opera houses also provide captions and subtitles.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over captioning may change with the advent of digital
technology, expected within five years.</TE>
<TE>   As with DVDs, digital movies could have separate tracks with
captions in a variety of languages, accessible with the flick of a
switch. Linke-Ellis is working to ensure that captioning capabilities
are included in hardware and software digital programs.</TE>
<TE>   "This audience is not going away," she said, because the huge baby
boom generation is quickly losing its hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "The incidence of hearing loss is one in 10 until age 65," Creagan
said. "Then it's one in three."</TE>

<HD>A Composers' Guide to Life</HD>
<DH>By meshing radically different music, Henry Brant and Lou
Harrison each sketch a vision of a world where we can all get along</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It would be a ridiculously tall order to expect composers to solve
the overcrowded world's most pressing problems. But world leaders let
us down when it comes to finding ways for different people with
different ideas and means to get along. They clearly cannot or will
not manage the planet's territory and resources to the benefit of
all.</LD>
<LD>   Better, I say, to turn to the most thoughtful scholars,
scientists, religious leaders and, especially, artists. We need look
no further than our backyard for musical sages, two of America's
greatest composers who have spent their lives writing music that
deals directly with the all-important issues of space and community.
Let the actions of musical tones serve as an example to people, and
we have a model of how to live together, or at least a start.</LD>
<LD>   The 88-year-old Henry Brant, who lives in Santa Barbara and who
won the Pulitzer Prize for music last month, has discovered that
radically different kinds of music can get along marvelously well if
their sources are accorded their proper place in physical space. Lou
Harrison, the Bay Area composer who celebrated his 85th birthday two
weeks ago, has taken the approach that the entire world of music is
an immense playground.</LD>
<TE>   "I spread my toys out on a large acreage" is one of his mottoes
for music that blends Eastern and Western cultures, yesterday and
today, with exquisite, loving and inspiring ease. Brant insists that
no single style can hope to evoke the "stresses, layered insanities
and multidirectional assaults of contemporary life on the spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Crusty old outsiders though they are, Brant and Harrison aren't
exactly unknown, unhonored or even altogether anti-establishment. But
their work seldom reaches the most prominent musical institutions
with their attendant large audiences (except for the
maverick-friendly San Francisco Symphony). So fragile is Harrison's
standing that all it took for the Lincoln Center Festival to cancel a
planned birthday tribute this summer was the failure of Bill T. Jones
to come to terms with Harrison's opera "Young Caesar." The festival
asked the choreographer to direct the premiere of a
festival-commissioned revision of the work. But when Jones, who has a
very different artistic sensibility from Harrison's, turned down the
project, Lincoln Center decided to save money and drop Harrison
altogether, rather than find a more suitable director.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the Los Angeles Philharmonic put up roadblocks for a
Brant evening that the CalArts New Century Players had hoped to
present at their annual appearance on the orchestra's Green Umbrella
series this spring. The Philharmonic required a program that could be
linked to its Schoenberg Prism series, and so a single Brant piece,
"Glossary," was conducted by the diminutive composer, wearing his
trademark color-coordinated sweatsuit and baseball cap, at the end of
long mixed program. (A spokesman says that the orchestra remains
open, however, to a more extensive future Brant collaboration.)</TE>
<TE>   Still, there has been just enough Brant and Harrison in the
Southland lately to remind us not only of the importance of what the
two composers represent, but also of their music's sheer
persuasiveness and utter likability. Earlier this month, the annual
New Music Festival at UC Santa Barbara was host to Brant as
composer-in-residence and also celebrated Harrison's 85th birthday.
Southwest Chamber Music noted the Harrison milestone, as did
MicroFest 2002, where the composer was scheduled to make an
appearance Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   What is ironic about this semi-neglect of Brant and Harrison is
that they are about the friendliest, most appealing visionaries you
could hope to encounter. Watching the plucky Brant, dressed like a
high school football coach, walk up to the podium and then expertly
command the quirky outpourings of individual CalArts players spread
around Zipper Hall, as he did for "Glossary," had practically the
whole audience smiling.</TE>
<TE>   For "Horizontals Extending," a kind of battle of the bands at
UCSB, Brant separated a wind and percussion ensemble into two
groups--one on stage and one in the pit of the Lotte Lehmann Concert
Hall--while a jazz drummer was stationed behind the audience. The two
bands began by trying to outdo each other with their different sorts
of quirky music but worked it out in an attack on a common enemy, the
insistent drummer. What proved most remarkable about this work was
not the outcome but the process. The fact that each music group had
its own acoustical homeland gave it equality and, most important of
all, intelligibility. In the end, it proved that three different
kinds of music could co-exist perfectly well, as long as they have
enough room.</TE>
<TE>   Brant's Pulitzer Prize-winning score, "Ice Break," was given its
premiere by the San Francisco Symphony in December. I recently caught
up with it via tape. Obviously this is music that needs to be
experienced in the theater, but even heard on a recording (which is
the way the Pulitzer jury heard it), there is a thrilling sense of
music accomplishing something valuable.</TE>
<TE>   In "Ice Break," Brant placed groups of musicians around San
Francisco's Davies Hall. The strings remained on stage; oboes and
bassoons were seated in the organ loft, where they joined the
composer, who manned the keyboard; other winds and brass and metallic
percussion, along with another jazz drummer, mingled among the
audience in the side boxes and on the two upper tiers.</TE>
<TE>   The piece asks each group of instruments to play in a distinctive
style--brash and jazzy or dark and melancholic. Some groups are on
their own; some are controlled by one of two conductors the piece
requires. At one end of the second tier, three piccolos and three
clarinets make chaotic background noise that doesn't connect with
anything--Brant said it represents everyday life.</TE>
<TE>   Again, every group goes its own way. Brant emphasizes the
startling individuality of the different sorts of music by making
each stand alone, not permitting the lower winds, say, to double the
lower strings, as often happens in an orchestra. Brant's contribution
to the performance was the most distinctive of all. He set loose the
organ's tallest pipe, creating near earthquake-strength vibrations.</TE>
<TE>   The result is an antidote to concert-hall claustrophobia, a
feeling that space can expand to include whatever we need to fit in
it. Spend 20 minutes with this piece and you feel not that you have
been given a respite from fractious modern society (which is what
some listeners have come to expect from classical music), but that
you are now better prepared to deal with it.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison accomplishes much the same thing by different means. He
has a marvelous gift for lyric melody, which he refers to as "the
audience's take-home pay." But he also has overcome the limitations
typical of great melodists.</TE>
<TE>   Tchaikovsky, for instance, never did much that was interesting
with his inspired melodies. Beethoven, on the other hand, stunned
listeners with the rabbits he pulled out of the most banal melodic
hats. With his ravenous musical appetite, Harrison can do both. He
enlivens already grand tunes, within stunning contexts, by
incorporating esoteric tunings or including something from Java or
Korea or Renaissance Italy, or a technique he might have picked up
during the year he spent in Los Angeles studying with Schoenberg.</TE>
<TE>   The recent local Harrison performances were mostly of small
pieces, and the only one I heard was Southwest Chamber Music's Suite
for Cello and Piano, which was also performed at the UCSB festival.
It is a minor eight-minute score written seven years ago. But even at
that, and despite Southwest's dutiful performance, there was no
mistaking that the composer could fashion half-century-old melodic
sketches from his workbooks into a small jewel of a piece that mixed
Western melody with subtle harmonic devices plucked from the wide
world.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison's more ambitious pieces--there are many, both he and
Brant have been prolific--leave us with the vision of the world as a
big happy family, not a group of warring tribes. Round, ponytailed,
bushy-bearded, and with a penchant for wearing oversized red shirts,
he has been dubbed new music's Santa Claus. It suits him, as he flits
around the globe in his music, delivering gifts from the West to the
East and from the East to the West.</TE>
<TE>   In Harrison's world, a Javanese gamelan seamlessly fits with
modern fiddles or horns; Renaissance dance forms, arcane systems of
tuning and modern techniques can all be tied together into melodies
worthy of Schubert and textures as sensual as any music has known.</TE>
<TE>   The music of Brant and Harrison won't cure AIDS, lessen the
resolve of suicide bombers, ease the tensions in the Middle East,
feed the hungry, halt global warming or balance the budget. But in
offering a believable glimpse of a happy world, these two inspiring
mavericks remind us of what is possible. A beacon in dark times is no
small or meaningless thing.</TE>

<DH>Three decades after the first blaxploitation wave, new
movies and roles are refreshing the genre</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE VALDESPINO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bring in da noise! Bring in da funk! Bring in Bootsy and Superfly
too. Blaxploitation characters, themes and fashions are alive again
in American pop culture.</LD>
<LD>   Images and sounds of the '70s urban scene are now flashing across
big and small screens: velour caps shaped like toadstools;
long-forgotten fashion colors such as burnt orange and neon green;
sexy female characters named Foxy in clingy, hip-hugging
bell-bottoms; and kung fu street-fighting guys who karate kick in
platform shoes.</LD>
<LD>   These low-budget films sold sex, violence, and a "black power by
any means necessary" attitude, and starred characters that prominent
members of the black community derided at that time as the lowest of
the low: pimps, hookers, drug dealers, even vampires ("Blacula,"
1972).</LD>
<TE>   But a new generation of filmmakers finds inspiration in these
stylized flicks. "Undercover Brother," which opens Friday, is John
Ridley's action comedy featuring a hero who's a spoof of
blaxploitation characters. "Austin Powers in Goldmember," which opens
in July, pays homage to blaxploitation with a character called Foxxy
Cleopatra, played by Beyonce Knowles of Destiny's Child.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley admires the original blaxploitation films because "even in
the B- or C-level campy movies like 'Three the Hard Way' and 'Black
Belt Jones,' you get to see virile black heroes and regular guys," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Burns, executive producer of the upcoming documentary "Hell
Up in Hollywood: Soul Cinema and the 1970s," treasures them. "These
movies were the forbidden fruit of my childhood," Burns said. "If you
were a black kid or a white kid in the '70s and wanted to be hip,
these were the movies you wanted to see."</TE>
<TE>   "Austin Powers" star and co-writer Mike Myers saw the films in the
many revival houses in Toronto. The Foxxy Cleopatra character is
meant as a loving tribute to the genre, he says. "It's such a yummy
flavor--the language, the music, the cinematography--and the clothes
are so cool," Myers said.</TE>
<TE>   The admiration society also includes Keenen Ivory Wayans ("I'm
Gonna Git You Sucka," 1988), Quentin Tarantino ("Jackie Brown," 1997)
and John Singleton, ("Shaft," 2000). And the trend extends beyond
movies.</TE>
<TE>   Besides "Undercover Brother," which stars Eddie Griffin, and Foxxy
Cleopatra, who wears a big puffy Afro in "Austin Powers in
Goldmember," dig the most recent flashbacks to the era of Soul
Cinema:</TE>
<TE>   * A Nike ad showcasing Bootsy Collins mixes vintage footage of ABA
players and new clips of NBA players such as Vince Carter (Dr. Funk).</TE>
<TE>   * A Burger King commercial starring Shaquille O'Neal, features
Isaac Hayes' "Theme From 'Shaft'" in the background, with the chorus
shouting "Shaq!" in all the right places.</TE>
<TE>   * Two documentaries slated for cable include "BaadAsssss Cinema,"
scheduled for August on the Independent Film Channel. No date is set
yet for "Hell Up in Hollywood: Soul Cinema and the 1970s," which will
be broadcast on American Movie Classics.</TE>
<TE>   * A remake of "Foxy Brown" will star its executive producer, Halle
Berry, in the title role.</TE>
<TE>   Not even fans agree on the definition of blaxploitation. But for
most, the term refers to films marketed to black audiences and
released between 1970 and 1979. Most were shot on budgets of less
than $1 million--usually about $200,000 to $750,000. About 200 to 250
were made then, depending on who is doing the counting.</TE>
<TE>   The core of the genre consists of fast-paced movies packed with
action, comedy and sex, and bearing shout-'em-out titles: "Cotton
Comes to Harlem" (1970), "Superfly" (1972), "Black Mama White Mama"
(1972), "The Mack" (1973). The films made B-movie stars of Pam Grier
("Coffy," 1973), Fred Williamson ("Black Caesar," 1973), Jim Brown
("Slaughter," 1972) and even Antonio "Huggy Bear" Fargas ("Foxy
Brown," 1974).</TE>
<TE>   Blaxploitation characters ranged wildly from Richard Roundtree as
the slick private eye in the original "Shaft" (1971), to Rudy Ray
Moore in the "Dolemite" series. Moore's character was described by
one fan as a "spy/cop/private eye with the slowest kung fu ever."</TE>
<TE>   Ridley turns the term "blaxploitation" on its head. The days of
segregated Hollywood, in which blacks played subservient roles unless
they were starring in so-called race movies, definitely ended with
'70s black cinema. "It's called exploitation because all these white
execs were making money off of it, but the fact of the matter is a
lot of black actors and writers were getting a lot of work," Ridley
said.</TE>
<TE>   For Ridley and others, these edgy films hark back to an era when
blacks were beginning to find a foothold in mainstream media; they
gave black talent a voice in Hollywood. Black power and "black is
beautiful" themes provide a backbeat to many of them.</TE>
<TE>   "The one word that nails it is 'empowerment,'" Ridley said. "My
parents had been through the civil rights movement, and they felt we
are a tough strong people and we do have a voice. Some of these films
started out with revenge themes but they evolved into themes of
inclusiveness."</TE>
<TE>   At first, blaxploitation movies were meant exclusively for black
urban audiences, but breakout films such as "Shaft" began to cross
over.</TE>
<TE>   "Hell Up" producer Burns believes these films have captured the
imagination of young filmmakers because "they were liberating. They
were so surrealistic, so violent and so 'out there.'"</TE>
<TE>   They were also made at a time when smaller films had a bigger
chance to grab box office bucks, before the advent of multiplexes and
franchise films such as "Star Wars."</TE>
<TE>   At the turn of the decade, Hollywood reeled from a one-two punch:
the studio system's collapse and the Vietnam War. Big films such as
"Hello, Dolly!" (1969) were flopping and little movies like "Five
Easy Pieces" (1970) were doing well, Burns said.</TE>
<TE>   Filmmakers today love the blaxploitation movies, Burns said,
because "they were empowering in a strange way. There was something
about them that was bold."</TE>
<TE>   Consider the bold fashion statements.</TE>
<TE>   In "Foxy Brown," Pam Grier whips off a Caltrans-orange, filmy,
feather-trimmed negligee, revealing knock-out bosoms--in the days
before silicon. Ron O'Neal as "Superfly" slinks and slouches through
the role, bare-chested or in form-fitting leisure suits, fur coats
and yards of leather.</TE>
<TE>   The look is eternally hip, and reverberates today in hip-hop
videos and the world of professional sports stars. Watch Shaq in a
postgame interview in green plaid cap and pants. He seems to echo
Roundtree's "Shaft" look: a tan plaid suit, its preppiness negated by
a full-length coat of buttery, "touch me, ladies" leather.</TE>
<TE>   Nike is onto the trend. In its latest series of commercials,
cheerleaders in afros dance to funk music by '70s throwback Bootsy
Collins, and basketball players wear fur coats and fedoras.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was to appeal to two generations of basketball fans, and
it has, Nike spokesman Scott Reames said. Nike has been inundated
with calls about the uniforms that the fictional team, the Roswell
Rayguns, wears.</TE>
<TE>   How did blaxploitation take hold of viewers who weren't even born
in the '70s? Through video and the culture of hip-hop, says Marcus
Morton, a producer of the upcoming remake of "Foxy Brown."</TE>
<TE>   "The original 'Foxy' has been woven into the fabric of hip-hop.
There's Foxy Brown, the solo music artist, whose persona, if it
wasn't taken from the movie, has its similarities," Morton said. "The
young kids have all seen the videos of the original films."</TE>
<TE>   Morton sees the blaxploitation films as part of a larger genre. He
widens the net chronologically to include art-house movies such as
"Soul Food" (1997) and hip-hop films such as "How High" (2001). He
foresees a day when the biggest movie studios will start their own
"urban" divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a massive desire by the consumer--white and black--to get
this music and these films," Morton said.</TE>
<TE>   The new blaxploitation wave presents some interesting challenges
to writers and direcors: Should the setting and characters be updated
or should they remain in the '70s?</TE>
<TE>   Rather than remaking "Foxy Brown" or "Cleopatra Jones" (1973),
Tarantino brought to life a contemporary character from Elmore
Leonard's novel "Jackie Brown." In the film, a tip of the hat to
roles played by Pam Grier, the title character plots an intricate
scam to outwit bad guys and cops, and a few men develop crushes on
her along the way. In the end she remains independent, making off
with the money but not a man.</TE>
<TE>   John Singleton updated "Shaft," with Roundtree reprising the
original character in a cameo while Samuel L. Jackson played the new
hero as Shaft's nephew. The remake was less successful, said David
Walker, the Portland, Ore.-based editor-publisher of the
blaxploitation magazine BadAzz MoFo who will appear in the
documentary "Hell Up in Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   "When Singleton made 'Shaft,' he never got the character right.
Maybe it was the producer or somebody else--but in 'Jackie Brown,' it
wasn't a question of 'what was the character?' She was beautiful, she
had brains, she was tough and it came through," Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley said there is no need to update the character of
"Undercover Brother," a retro guy living in contemporary times.
Tricked out in a purple vinyl jacket and snakeskin bell-bottoms, and
wearing his hair in a sky-high afro with pork-chop sideburns, he is
fed black power ideals as a child. He grows up and joins a do-gooder
organization called "the Brotherhood" to fight a network of
evil-doers known as "the Man."</TE>
<TE>   "He's stuck in the '70s," Ridley said. "It's like Lenny Kravitz.
He's got this funky kind of style and it's infectious to everyone
around him."</TE>
<TE>   Ridley's film has a silly set-up. But it's still a commentary on
race relations. Keeping the tone light is key to dealing with issues
that the original blaxploitation films faced head-on, he said. "When
you make people laugh, they listen better. White people don't want to
have a finger pointed at them, and that's why you have to find new
ways to tell a story."</TE>
<TE>   In "Austin Powers in Goldmember," directory Jay Roach says the
British spy travels back in time to 1975 and gets reacquainted with
Foxxy. "She's performing in a roller disco club in the '70s."</TE>
<TE>   She sees Austin, and the fun begins. "In 1967 they dated, he was
frozen and he never called her," Myers explained. "From her point of
view, we haven't seen each other in eight years. You don't do that to
Foxxy Cleopatra. She decks him right outta the gate. She says, 'Mama
only got a taste of honey but she wanted the whole beehive!' and I
say 'Behave!'"</TE>
<TE>   As for the new version of "Foxy Brown," producer Morton calls it a
"serious" remake. The original Foxy was caught between her
drug-dealer brother and her undercover cop lover, who is murdered.
She infiltrates the drug-dealing network by posing as a prostitute.
But her cover is blown. She's beaten, raped, forced to take heroin.
She gets revenge by castrating one of the leaders of the crime ring.</TE>
<TE>   In the '70s, Jack Hill, director of the original "Foxy Brown,"
said he fought the racist attitudes of some studio types, "so I had
to do trade-offs. 'I'll do this, if you let me do that.' Halle Berry
won't have to fight for those things. She'll just demand them."</TE>
<TE>   Walker predicts the film won't have much of a political backdrop.
"They'll want to make a movie that's PG-13 and go the 'Charlie's
Angels' route," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Hill, who lives in West Hollywood and still shops screenplays,
defends Foxy as an everywoman: "She triumphs by her wits and
wiles.... She's not a superheroine. She's believable, and black women
can watch her and say 'I could do that if I had to.'"</TE>
<TE>   Blaxploitation has been one of the most influential cultural
movements in America over the last 30 years, says Todd Boyd,
professor of critical studies at the USC School of Cinema-Television.
"Quentin Tarantino has made a career based on that he was a white man
embracing films from the blaxploitation era. It hasn't come and
disappeared, it has come over and over and over again," Boyd said.</TE>
<TE>   Walker believes the films could have an even bigger reach if
racial politics are set aside. "'The Legend of Nigger Charley' [1972]
was one of the highest-grossing movies that Paramount put out that
year," Walker said. "But who wants to talk about it?"</TE>

<DH>Warnings won't suffice. We need to prepare for the worst.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seems a lifetime ago, I was crawling under barbed wire while
machine gun bullets whistled just a few feet overhead. I recall that
it was a miserable experience, belly to the cold dirt, incessant
racket and a gunnery sergeant screaming that I wasn't moving fast
enough or paying enough attention or something or the other.</LD>
<LD>   Live-fire exercises as a U.S. Marine were the riveting kind of
experiences that stayed with me in a way that college philosophy
classes never did.</LD>
<LD>   I cannot say that they fully prepared me for the war I would see
later in Vietnam, or the other wars I was drawn into as a journalist.
But I did learn that an important part of facing danger was getting
ready for it mentally. Visualizing it. Anticipating it. Listening to
old salts talk about coping. Promising yourself courage, or at least
reminding yourself to hold on to your wits.</LD>
<TE>   This valuable lesson comes to mind now as I contemplate the war
that besets our country.</TE>
<TE>   "Inevitable." That's FBI Director Robert Mueller's assessment of
whether we're going to be attacked again by suicide bombers, or car
bombers, apartment building bombers or some other kind of bombers.</TE>
<TE>   "Inevitably." That's Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld speaking on
the likelihood of terrorists getting their hands on nuclear, chemical
or germ weapons.</TE>
<TE>   You want warnings? Well, we've got them.</TE>
<TE>   So now what?</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, they're absorbed with looking back at the
mishandled clues that led up to the Sept. 11 attack. This kind of
hindsight hullabaloo has a long tradition behind it. The exercise
supposedly serves to keep our officials on their toes. At the very
least, it allows politicians to blow off some partisan steam.
Personally, though, I think we ought to spend more energy getting us
unwilling conscriptees ready for this future none of us wanted. If
the expert odds are as certain as inevitable, then it's a safe bet to
say that we'll be looking back next time and demanding to know why
didn't someone think about the public's role in attacks on the
public.</TE>
<TE>   How much Cipro does a family need to stockpile? Do those briefcase
parachutes really work if you need to bail out of a high-rise? Do we
put the gas mask beneath or on top of the peanut-butter sandwich in
the kid's lunch pail? If you live downstream from a dam, should you
wear water wings to bed just to be safe? What to do if your fortune
cookie tells you something big is about to happen in your life?</TE>
<TE>   Actually, there are plenty of sober matters that warrant
discussion, thought, visualization and personal planning--and not in
the aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   But the only sign of civic preparation brought to my attention is
notice that President Bush, in cooperation with the National
Sheriffs' Assn., "has announced that the Neighborhood Watch Program
will be taking on a new significance." That and the disturbing
disclosures as to how government officials have made sure there are
secure hiding places for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, the guidance from Washington seems to be: Some of you
are going to die, poor dears. But you cannot say you weren't warned.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, Americans were mobilized, at least those on
the West Coast, where an attack was thought probable. When I listen
to people reflect about those days, I realize that one result of
civil defense was to ready people mentally, to harden them against
panic, while daily life went on. If war was to engulf civilians, then
someone back then had the good sense to engage civilians in
preparations. Cold War air raid drills across the nation probably did
the same.</TE>
<TE>   We all know that the first aim of terrorists is to spread terror.
We're making it easier for them by adhering to the agenda of politics
instead of readiness.</TE>
<TE>   Warnings by themselves serve only to inflame anxieties, and then
leave us numb. The lesson I learned long ago is that you cannot
overcome the stunning shock of attack, but you can control it. We
don't need something as radical as live-fire drills. But with some
straight talk and premeditation, we can set expectations for
ourselves and for each other. We can make ourselves smarter about the
nature of the threats and sensible reactions. We might save some
lives; we'll surely save ourselves a measure of terror.</TE>
<TE>   If you want, you can quarrel about whether the Bush administration
should have given more attention to the evidence of trouble in
advance of Sept. 11. But now, in the face of the "inevitable," it's
hard to argue that the wisest thing the country can do is relegate
its citizens to nothing more than the hapless role of sheep waiting
for the wolves.</TE>

<HD>Secession Means Nada</HD>
<DH>One city, two cities: Either way, Latinos are politically
confident.</DH>

<LD>Latino activists take a relaxed, even smug, view of the San Fernando
Valley's effort to secede from Los Angeles, and with good reason.
They know the demographic future of the urban sprawl on both sides of
the Santa Monica Mountains is Latino.</LD>
<LD>   Despite its outdated image as a largely white suburb, 42% of the
Valley's population in the 2000 census was Latino. That makes Latinos
the largest ethnic group in the proposed new city--something they've
been in Los Angeles as a whole for years.</LD>
<LD>   In a deliciously ironic twist, the easygoing Latino view of
secession has turned a detestable old stereotype on its head, making
it a sign of growing political clout. Most Latinos don't worry about
secession that much because--whatever happens--there's always manana.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, we got an uninspiring preview of the overblown rhetoric
likely to be heard in coming months when the Local Agency Formation
Commission voted to put Valley secession on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO is the agency charged with researching the viability of
proposed new government entities. Not surprisingly, it concluded that
a Valley city with a population of more than 1.3million people has
the potential to be economically viable.</TE>
<TE>   The agency still must vote on similar proposals from residents of
Hollywood and the harbor area. But the political battle was in full
fury at Wednesday's LAFCO hearing, and neither side came off very
well.</TE>
<TE>   That is why it is reassuring to note how the city's Latino
political leadership has been admirably restrained in pondering the
ramifications of secession. Activist groups that have been criticized
in the past for using harsh rhetoric or dire predictions of calamity
to push for political change used a refreshingly different tack.</TE>
<TE>   The Latino Redistricting Coalition and the Mexican American
Political Assn. came forward with well-researched suggestions for
making LAFCO's secession plan fairer to the fast-growing Latino
population in the East Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than two City Council districts with a significant number
of Latino voters, as originally proposed, MAPA and the redistricting
coalition persuaded LAFCO to draw a new map with four of the Valley's
proposed 14 City Council districts made up of at least 40% Latino
voters. And a fifth will probably pass that milestone in a few years.</TE>
<TE>   Combine that Latino-friendly map with the likelihood that popular
elected officials from the Valley, such as state Sen. Richard Alarcon
(D-Van Nuys) and Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Mission Hills), may run
for office in a new Valley city and it is easy to see why Latino
activists are sanguine about the future of Latino political
empowerment, no matter what L.A.'s future is.</TE>
<TE>   Even on the city's Eastside, where one might expect Latino
activists to be concerned about the citywide impact of losing new
Latino voters in places like Sylmar and North Hollywood, the prospect
of Valley secession is seen more as an opportunity than a threat.</TE>
<TE>   If the Valley leaves L.A., longtime activists on the Eastside say
they may revive long-dormant plans to annex unincorporated East Los
Angeles, adding 130,000 more Latino residents to a suddenly smaller
City of Angels.</TE>
<TE>   As with Valley secession, annexing East L.A. is a complex proposal
that would require research and serious discussion. But it shows how
Latino activists are focused on the future--a change I first noted
when so many of them easily shrugged off Mayor James K. Hahn's defeat
of Antonio Villaraigosa in last year's mayoral election. ''Wait 'til
next time'' was the prevailing attitude.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Latinos who once saw themselves as the political
defenders of an oppressed minority now see themselves as the
forefront of an emerging majority. And they're looking ahead not just
with confidence but with creativity.</TE>
<TE>   I kind of like the new manana attitude.</TE>

<HD>Lionesses of the Left Eat Judicial Nominees Alive</HD>
<DH>Feinstein and Boxer are exploiting a system to block
conservatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAWN STEEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bush administration officials are furious and frustrated with Senate
Democrats for holding hostage dozens of qualified conservative
judicial candidates by refusing to allow floor votes on their
nominations. Meanwhile, back in California, Sens. Dianne Feinstein
and Barbara Boxer, both Democrats, are squeezing the administration
by threatening to blue-slip all the nominees who don't meet their
political agenda. Even worse, they've been allowed to do this through
a deal brokered by Republicans that was supposed to smooth the way
for President Bush's judicial choices.</LD>
<LD>   This untenable situation can partly be blamed on someone close to
Bush: attorney Gerald L. Parsky, Bush's top political operative in
California.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after Bush's inauguration, Parsky, who advises Bush on
presidential appointments, convinced the newly installed White House
counsel's office to gamble on a system of so-called bipartisan
committees to screen judicial nominations.</LD>
<TE>   The idea was to come up with federal district court candidates who
were acceptable to both parties and thus ensure speedy confirmation
by the nearly evenly divided Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, in a state like California where both U.S. senators
are from the opposition party, the judicial selection process falls
to senior Republican members of the House delegation.</TE>
<TE>   Parsky's plan usurped that precious prerogative in favor of a
bizarre system of committees--half of whose members are appointed by
Feinstein and Boxer. Four committees, each made up of six members,
evaluate candidates for the federal bench in sessions that are closed
to public scrutiny. No judicial candidate is forwarded to the White
House unless four of the six members agree, but this gives Feinstein
and Boxer de facto veto power over anyone the White House wants to
place on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, speedy confirmations remain theoretical. The
bipartisan panels have proved to be an abysmal failure.</TE>
<TE>   For example, shortly after announcing formation of the panels last
year, Bush nominated Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) and
Superior Court Judge Carolyn Kuhl to the 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals. Boxer, unrestrained by any sense of fairness you would think
she might have--given her participation in the bipartisan
panels--launched one of her trademark verbal tirades against Cox's
nomination, which was withdrawn. Neither Boxer nor Feinstein has
assisted Kuhl, whose nomination drifts in limbo as the wait for a
hearing drags into its second year.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein has shown her true colors in two big votes involving
judicial candidates from other states who didn't pass her ideological
muster.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of months ago, Feinstein, a member of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, voted against allowing the full Senate to vote
on Bush's nominee, Judge Charles Pickering. Last week, she did the
same against Judge D. Brooks Smith. This is the same Feinstein who
recently stated that Bush should not be free to choose his own
nominees because of the narrowness of his election.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no mandate, in my view, to skew the courts to the
right," she was quoted as saying. "And so I think you're going to see
a Judiciary Committee that's really going to be looking for
mainstream judges."</TE>
<TE>   "Mainstream judges" is a Democratic code phrase for traditional,
big-government, anti-individual-freedom and anti-property-rights
jurists. Let's face it, it is virtually guaranteed that no
conservative scholars--no matter how highly qualified--can survive
the Boxer-Feinstein gantlet.</TE>
<TE>   The bipartisan committee process has been conducted like a
modern-day Star Chamber, shrouded in secrecy. The lack of open and
recorded hearings makes for great mischief. More than one judicial
district judge candidate has told me of being asked to state a
position on Roe vs. Wade. One told me he was asked about his
involvement in the Catholic Church. These kinds of questions are
clearly improper.</TE>
<TE>   The rumblings over judicial selection are getting louder. Even
Alberto Gonzalez, a close Bush advisor and White House counsel,
expressed somber dissatisfaction last week with the Parsky-designed
district committees.</TE>
<TE>   The bipartisan committees are a half-baked idea that has served as
a weapon for Boxer and Feinstein to prevent Bush from placing
conservative judges on the federal bench. These two lionesses of the
left have taken Parsky's naive creation and are using it to eat
him--and the president's judicial appointment power--alive.</TE>
<TE>   The only solution is to return to the time-honored tradition of
entrusting the selection of federal judge candidates to senior
federal elected members of the president's party. It is a proven
system that works.</TE>

<HD>Oregon Sanctuary of 'Incomparable Beauty' Turns 100</HD>
<DH>Nature: Crater Lake National Park, once considered too
remote to attract crowds, is celebrating a proud centennial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF BARNARD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CRATER LAKE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>The birth of Crater Lake National Park 100 years ago was a long and
difficult one, mostly because Congress in the 19th century thought
its remote location made it a loser with tourists.</LD>
<LD>   But a Kansas schoolboy's fascination with the idea of a lake
inside a volcano became an adult obsession, until the stars finally
aligned and, on May 22, 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt signed the
proclamation creating the nation's fifth national park.</LD>
<LD>   Crater Lake remains Oregon's only national park, and the people
who love it are celebrating. There is a one-man play about William
Steel's quest to save the lake from being overrun by herds of sheep,
an art show depicting the lake in photos, sculpture, painting and
pastels, books and a commemorative license plate.</LD>
<TE>   "Crater Lake, in the Park Service family, is considered one of the
crown jewels," said George Buckingham, its retired chief ranger and a
member of the board of Friends of Crater Lake, which is putting on
some of the festivities.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the park's location at the crest of the snowy Cascade
Range, the rededication ceremonies will wait until Aug. 24-25, when
roads and trails are clear of snow. But an art show, lectures and
performances of "Resolutions: William Gladstone Steel and Crater Lake
National Park," will be held at lower elevations.</TE>
<TE>   Crater Lake lies atop an ancient volcano known as Mount Mazama,
one of the huge cones that extend along the crest of the Cascades.
Dormant now, Mazama erupted 7,000 years ago with a blast estimated at
42 times greater than that of Mount St. Helens.</TE>
<TE>   As the underlying support for the mountain was lost, the walls of
the volcano collapsed inward, forming a caldera. Over the course of
several hundred years, rain and snow filled the basin to a depth of
1,943 feet, making it the nation's deepest lake.</TE>
<TE>   Crater Lake was a place of power for the Klamath tribe for
thousands of years. They witnessed the eruption, immortalizing it in
a story of a battle between the powerful monster who lived in the
mountain, Lao, and Skell, a mythical hero. Young men who wanted to be
shamans ran down the steep caldera wall and dove into the cold water
at night to see the spirits that lived at the bottom of the lake.</TE>
<TE>   It was not discovered by white men until June 12, 1853, when a
party of prospectors stumbled upon it while looking for gold. They
called it Blue Lake, in homage to its incredibly blue color, the
result of the water's purity and depth.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew when I gazed upon Crater Lake that even though the West
was filled with undiscovered wonders, Crater Lake would hold its
own," John Wesley Hillman would say later.</TE>
<TE>   But it was largely forgotten until 1885, when an Army expedition
went to the lake to study the geology.</TE>
<TE>   Steel told people he learned of Crater Lake in a newspaper used to
wrap a sandwich for school. When he moved from Kansas to Portland as
a young man, he could find few people who had even heard of the
place. He joined the 1885 Army expedition, and went back to Portland
determined to make Crater Lake a national park.</TE>
<TE>   President Grover Cleveland ordered a portion of what is now the
park withdrawn from development in 1886, but Steel would stalk the
halls of Washington for 16 more years before seeing his dream come
true.</TE>
<TE>   A scandal over Yellowstone, the nation's first national park, made
Congress skittish, and Crater Lake's remote location, with no
railroad or roads, left lawmakers skeptical that it would be anything
but a drain on the treasury, said park historian Steve Mark.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Club founder John Muir was indifferent, preferring his
beloved Yosemite Valley in California. Even after Crater Lake was
made a park and Steel stocked the lake with trout to attract
tourists, Western writer Zane Gray found them puny from lack of food.</TE>
<TE>   But "Call of the Wild" author Jack London called Crater Lake
"incomparable in beauty" after his 1911 visit. And Charles Lindbergh
flew over the lake in 1927.</TE>
<TE>   The greatest threats in Steel's time were logging and herds of
grazing sheep, but now the threats can come from far away. Toxic dust
from Chinese industrial pollution can be carried across the ocean by
the wind, for example, fouling the park's pristine air.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the difficult things about being in what we call
the forever business," said Mac Brock, the park's natural resources
officer. "It's very difficult to see what is going to rear its head."</TE>
<TE>   The park spent $625,000 in recent years to eradicate Eastern brook
trout from Sun Creek so they would not wipe out the native bull
trout, a threatened species and the only native fish in the park.</TE>
<TE>   Now Brock is worried about alien plants, such as spotted knapweed
and Klamath weed, which are gradually marching up from the valley
floor, pushing out the native wildflowers.</TE>
<TE>   Looking into the 21st century, park Supt. Chuck Lundy sees the
park taking on a new role as a center of scientific research and
education, from elementary school to postgraduate study.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes to see what had been the superintendent's residence,
unused for 25 years, converted into the headquarters of the Crater
Lake Science and Learning Center. The old naturalist's residence
would be living space for visiting scientists.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, the Sinnott Memorial overlook is reopening with
$500,000 in new exhibits on geology and history. The nearby Kaiser
Photography Studio has been renovated, as has the Community House,
where rangers will hold evening campfire talks.</TE>
<TE>   Plans anticipate $8 million in changes, including moving the Rim
Village parking back so that cars no longer dominate the view,
renovating the cafeteria and gift shop in their original 1928
edifice, and building a two-story visitor center tall enough to see
over the snowbanks to the lake beyond in winter.</TE>
<TE>   Because of a winter that lasts from September to June, Crater Lake
has been a hardship post. But by the time Buckingham retired after 11
years here, it had become his favorite park.</TE>
<TE>   "As chief ranger, I spent an awful lot of time in the office, with
meetings, budgeting, counseling," he said. "And every now and then
I'd go up on the rim and say, 'This is why I put up with all of
this.' I took care of something really important for a time."</TE>

<HD>Fledgling Scientists Earn Wings With DNA Study</HD>
<DH>Education: Students seek to determine whether sage grouse
on the Nevada-California border are genetically distinct from those
in 11 Western states.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA CHEREB</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>YERINGTON, Nev.</DL>
<LD>Bundled against the High Desert's nighttime chill, the students
huddled around the back of a pickup truck for a quick lesson on how
to catch a sage grouse.</LD>
<LD>   Armed with nets, floodlights, binoculars and boomboxes, their
mission was to capture some of the game birds that inhabit the dry
sagebrush plains. Before releasing the birds, the students would
collect blood samples for DNA analysis at their lab at Yerington High
School.</LD>
<LD>   Spurred by curiosity and a persistent teacher, they are working
with experts throughout the West, trying to determine whether a small
population of sage grouse found along the Nevada-California border is
genetically distinct from other sage grouse found in 11 Western
states. Their findings could influence the decision on whether the
grouse should be protected under the Endangered Species Act.</LD>
<TE>   In the process, they are getting a head start on college, finding
new enthusiasm for science and taking pride in their role in the
ongoing debate over a very real environmental issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Truthfully, science never really interested me that much," said
Rachel Loucks. "But I can't imagine a class that you'd enjoy more.</TE>
<TE>   "It's right there at the edge."</TE>
<TE>   With a population of about 3,000, this small ranching and farming
community 90 miles southeast of Reno is hardly a hub for
technological innovation.</TE>
<TE>   But the high school class became an incubator for high-tech
learning three years ago when a few students asked science teacher
Steve Pellegrini to teach them about DNA.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew nothing about it and decided I needed to learn it,"
Pellegrini said. "We worked on the Internet, just bugging anyone we
could think of to help us learn the DNA protocol."</TE>
<TE>   They set up a crude lab and began experimenting after school and
on weekends with horsehair. At the urging of state wildlife
officials, the students later took up sage grouse research.</TE>
<TE>   Pellegrini also began hunting for money. So far he has received
nearly $50,000 in grants to purchase the sophisticated instruments
demanded in DNA research. With a well-equipped lab, the program was
first offered as a regular class last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "A high school is never going to be a definitive voice in
something this large," Pellegrini said. But experts have taken notice
of the youngsters' work and welcome their assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll certainly be able to use some of their preliminary data,"
said Tom Quinn, who heads a research laboratory at the University of
Denver. "The other thing they're doing is sending us samples from the
birds that they're working with, and that is definitely important to
us."</TE>
<TE>   A study by the Denver researchers suggests this particular
population of sage grouse is genetically distinct. Earlier this year,
an environmental group used that study as a basis to petition the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for emergency protection of the birds.</TE>
<TE>   Sage grouse--large game birds weighing up to 7 pounds--have seen
their numbers decline by as much as 80% over the last 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   The federal agency rejected the emergency action sought by the
Institute for Wildlife Protection in Eugene, Ore., saying the groups
in California's Mono Basin and Lyon County in Nevada are part of a
larger population more widely dispersed than the environmental
organization claims.</TE>
<TE>   That's the question the Yerington class is trying to answer.</TE>
<TE>   The students' work is also important because they are targeting
some of the more remote populations, said Sonja Taylor, a Quinn
associate.</TE>
<TE>   "They're increasing the area from which we have genetic samples,"
Taylor said. "We're also interested to know what they're doing
because they're testing different genes that we haven't surveyed."</TE>
<TE>   The students are sensitive to the implications of their work,
particularly in this ranching region. An emergency listing of sage
grouse under the Endangered Species Act could restrict grazing and
other uses of public lands.</TE>
<TE>   A disclaimer on the class Web site reads: "We are in no way siding
with either the farmers or the environmentalists; we are simply
listing some of the possibilities for the disappearing numbers of
sage grouse in this region of Nevada and California.</TE>
<TE>   "We are involved in this for the science we are learning about and
for the opportunities it presents us, not for any political
motivation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Back in the lab, the 16 young scientists explain the protocols and
equipment used to extract DNA from grouse samples.</TE>
<TE>   The "little white floaties" in the bottom of a small test tube are
DNA, student Julie Sanford said.</TE>
<TE>   The goal, said her lab partner, Desiree Hernandez, an aspiring
geneticist, is to break the DNA down into "bands," which when
compared to other birds, "basically shows how closely they're
related."</TE>
<TE>   Terms like "PCRs" (polymerase chain reaction), "genecyclers",
"spectrophonometors," "electrophoresis chambers, and "TBE buffer"
roll off the tongues of these teenagers as effortlessly as slang.</TE>
<TE>   And they know what they're talking about.</TE>
<TE>   Their achievements, said Principal Keith Savage, are the end
result of a simple equation: "Take great kids, a great teacher, put
them together and give them an opportunity to do what they do best."</TE>
<TE>   Their accomplishments are even more noteworthy given the
community's humble background, Savage said. More than half of all
students in the elementary and intermediate schools qualify for
subsidized lunches. More than a third of Yerington High's 468
students are minorities--21% are Latino and 16% are American Indian.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Nevada at Reno is providing technical expertise
and advice to the students, who can earn independent study credits,
said Lee Weber, chairman of the university's biology department.</TE>
<TE>   The university has made DNA analysis software available to the
class, Weber said, and hopes to set up video conferencing with the
Nevada Genomics Center, the core DNA analysis facility for university
researchers.</TE>
<TE>   The Yerington class is being used as a model to try to establish
similar programs at other Nevada high schools, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although some students hope to pursue a career in science, others
have different goals. Joe Halsted wants to become a pastor. Charity
Triplett dreams of being a veterinarian. Loucks hopes to become a
lawyer, but she's considering an degree in microbiology first.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I figure, if I study science, then I can use my
background to better represent or protect my client," she said. "I'll
know what I'm talking about."</TE>

<LD>For decades, books of rock 'n' roll quotes have depended on the same
old provocateurs, from Pete Townshend and Frank Zappa to Elvis
Costello and Johnny Rotten, to entertain us with memorable comments
about the pop lifestyle. So John D. Luerssen, author of "Mouthing
Off: A Book of Rock &amp; Roll Quotes" (Telegraph Co., $14.95), thought
it was time to point out that today's rockers are keeping the
tradition alive. Most of the nearly 500 quotes in the paperback
collection are from the past 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   Here are some of our favorites:</LD>
<LD>   "The expectations on a woman drive you crazy. If Jennifer Lopez
could write songs like Fiona Apple's, she wouldn't have to spend so
many hours at the gym." --Shirley Manson of Garbage (2001).</LD>
<TE>   "Your shoes have got to match what color guitar you're playing. I
had this black guitar and I was going, 'I can't seem to dress with
this guitar.'" --Noel Gallagher, right, of Oasis (2000).</TE>
<TE>   "A record company is like a giant ATM machine." --Beck (1994).</TE>
<TE>   "We're actually releasing the next album on EBay, 'cause we think
we can get a better royalty rate." --Pat Wilson of Weezer (2001).</TE>
<TE>   "MTV is like, 'Make us a video, make sure it's hot, spend a lot of
money on it and maybe we'll play it. And then we'll take the credit
for it and play it as much as we want, whenever we want.'" --Stephen
Malkmus of Pavement (1994).</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see how a dysfunctional band could release 80 songs in
five years." --Billy Corgan, rejecting a frequent depiction of his
band the Smashing Pumpkins (1997).</TE>
<TE>   "I'm resigning for medical reasons: Billy Corgan makes me sick."
--Sharon Osbourne, on leaving her job as manager of the Smashing
Pumpkins (2000).</TE>
<TE>   "You gotta be really careful what you bite off. Don't bite off
more than you can chew." --Ozzy Osbourne (1998).</TE>
<TE>   "I can do things with a guitar that Eric Clapton probably hasn't
even had a nightmare about. Our instincts are worth more than a
thousand years of guitar lessons." --Jim Reid of the Jesus and Mary
Chain (1992).</TE>
<TE>   "We were supposed to be the alt-country Nirvana. I guess I was
supposed to hang myself with a banjo string." --Ryan Adams, on his
old band Whiskeytown (2000).</TE>
<TE>   "I'm driven, I am. I'm driven for some reason. But I don't know
where I'm going." --Courtney Love (1992).</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard work, saving rock." --the Edge of U2 (2000).</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--One of the art world's renowned figures lives in the Bowery
district of lower Manhattan in a grafittied building flanked by
restaurant supply shops that park their industrial-strength
refrigerators on the sidewalk. A buzzer springs open the front door,
revealing John Coplans, a curator and director at the Pasadena Art
Museum in the 1960s, a founding editor of Artforum magazine in the
'60s and 1970s, and, since the mid-'80s, a photographer recently
awarded the French Order of Arts and Letters, along with such
luminaries as Meryl Streep and Beverly Sills.</LD>
<LD>   Coplans, who is 81, stands with a slight stoop; his white hair and
beard are closely cropped, and bright red suspenders hold up his
khaki trousers. He comes close and tilts his head, brown eyes
enlarged by thick glasses. "Let me take a look at you," he says,
explaining that macular degeneration is slowly eroding his vision.
"I'm half-blind and can't see you unless I'm very close."</LD>
<LD>   After the inspection, he explains, "It's like a permanent night.
The moon is out and you can see everything, but you can't see
details. You can see a face but can't recognize the person."</LD>
<TE>   In his crisp English accent, he offers a cup of coffee, a
cigarette and a seat at a long table stacked with books and
photographs. He proceeds to put in his hearing aid. His wife of five
years, Amanda Means, is out for the day. On the wall of his studio
are two of his latest photographs: his own naked legs splayed at
anatomically impossible angles. The effect is disorienting and
bizarre, which is his intention.</TE>
<TE>   "I did them after the bombing of the World Trade Center. The
inside of my studio smelled like a funeral pyre from all the smoke
and bodies. It depressed me intensely, so I started making this work.
Then my eyesight started to go. I tried to go on making them, and to
my surprise, I was able to. Which just goes to show you--seeing is
not about the eyes, seeing is about the mind."</TE>
<TE>   A collection of Coplans' photographs with his rollicking,
autobiographical introduction has been published by powerHouse Books
in an oversized volume called "A Body." In conjunction with the
book's release, a selection of his large black-and-white photographs
of hands and fingers are on view at ACE Gallery in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Year after year, Coplans has photographed his aging body parts
with a startling absence of sentimentality. His hairy back, his
wrinkled legs, his gnarled toes and hands. At ACE, giant prints of
his hands, cupped inward, show the stubs of the fingers. While these
self-portraits never include his face, the photos expose Coplans with
an intimacy that is not for the timid.</TE>
<TE>   Coplans didn't begin his photographic career until age 60. He had
started his artistic life as a painter, but then put it aside and
gained a reputation as a critic, editor and curator. In fact, Coplans
has managed to have a life in three distinct acts, each as full of
incident as a John Le Carre novel.</TE>
<TE>   Coplans was born into a middle-class Jewish family in London, the
son of a doctor who was also an amateur sculptor. His father's
wanderlust bounced the family between London, Johannesburg and Cape
Town until, at 16, Coplans dropped out of school and two years later
joined the Royal Air Force. A rugby accident grounded him, but in
1938 he joined the King's African Rifles, taking part in the capture
of Italian-occupied Somaliland and Ethiopia. Progressing to the rank
of captain, he also served in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), India and Burma
(now Myanmar).</TE>
<TE>   After eight years in the army, in 1947, Coplans returned to a
bombed-out London. After reading a government pamphlet listing grants
for further education, he decided there was nothing he was qualified
for "except to become an artist, a job for which there are no real
qualifications." After a semester of study, however, Coplans dropped
out. "I was 26 and had seen a lot of the world and was virtually
unteachable."</TE>
<TE>   Coplans supported himself for years with odd jobs, teaching and
occasionally selling one of his geometric paintings. He became a
contractor and his standard of living improved, but he felt his
painting was going nowhere. At the Tate Gallery In 1959, he saw "New
American Painting," featuring work by Jackson Pollock and other
Abstract Expressionists. It so impressed him that he sold his
belongings and moved to the U.S. in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   He checked out the Museum of Modern Art in New York ("an amazing
experience"), spent time in San Francisco and, after hearing Walter
Hopps (who would later be Coplans' boss at the Pasadena museum)
deliver a lecture on the rambunctious art being produced in Southern
California, moved to Los Angeles in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   It was providential timing, as L.A. was fast becoming the most
active center for contemporary art outside of New York. "There were
all kinds of opportunities because of what was going on and the need
to pursue them out into the bigger art world," Coplans recalls.</TE>
<TE>   By 1963, he had traded his painting, which he decided was
"ordinary," for writing (he co-founded Artforum in 1962) and
curating.</TE>
<TE>   How good was his eye? In 1962, he saw Andy Warhol's 32 paintings
of Campbell's soup cans at Ferus Gallery and talked the owner, Irving
Blum, into canceling the sale of three of them. "They have to stay
together," he told Blum. "They are a terribly important body of
work."</TE>
<TE>   It was Coplans' first critical coup. Blum slowly made payments
over the years to Warhol to pay for the entire group; in 1996, he
sold the suite to the Museum of Modern Art for $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   There would be many other Coplans discoveries. He was, for
example, among the first to spot the significance of the clay
sculpture made by Californians Peter Voulkos and Ken Price. After
becoming director of the UC Irvine art gallery in 1965, Coplans
organized a groundbreaking exhibition that linked their work with
Abstract Expressionism.</TE>
<TE>   Hired as senior curator of the Pasadena Art Museum in 1967, he
organized the first solo museum exhibitions of soon-to-be
international stars Robert Irwin, James Turrell and Richard Serra
and, in 1970, the first Warhol retrospective in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, as that museum was being subsumed into what is now the
Norton Simon Museum of Art, Coplans moved to New York to take over as
editor in chief of Artforum, which had moved from L.A. to the East
Coast in the late 1960s. Evenings were spent doing "research" at the
nightclub Max's Kansas City, but the magazine remained at the
forefront of its field. Seven years later, however, Coplans was out
of a job. The publisher, he says, asked him either to buy the
magazine or leave.</TE>
<TE>   At 60, he took a post as director of the Akron Art Museum in Ohio
and, away from New York's nightlife, found himself with time on his
hands. He began experimenting with creating art again, taking nude
self-portraits using an automatic timer. Eventually, he decided to
sell his collection of Carleton Watkins photographs to fund a
full-time return to the life of an artist.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an act of desperation," he says of the opening of Act 3.
"I certainly wasn't going to stay in Akron for the rest of my life. I
was enthralled by the photographic process and decided to spend what
time I had left doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Coplans moved back to New York, and within a few years, despite
the challenging nature of the work, the prestigious Daniel Wolfe
Gallery was showing and selling his prints.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, he was given a show at the Art Institute of Chicago and
received a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, the first of
four.</TE>
<TE>   The grant money enabled him to hire an assistant, someone to
actually click the Polaroid camera, so that he could concentrate on
what he calls "autobiographical" poses. "My mind, my memory wandered
up and down my life, and would provoke the images that I would make,"
he says of the process. "They all have to do with something that
happened to me and often with humor."</TE>
<TE>   In the Village Voice, art critic Peter Schjeldahl praised his 1997
retrospective at New York's P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, noting,
"He has inserted into art history a type of work that was there to be
done... : a mighty synthesis of photographic factuality and
paintinglike qualities, conjoined in the metaphor of skin."</TE>
<TE>   These days, Coplans is happy to let others analyze his work.
"When I make photographs," he says, rummaging through a nearly empty
pack of cigarettes, "I make them about seeing.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a painter, I was intellectual. Now I've reversed the
procedure away from the intellectual and found a way of being
completely intuitive and a new freedom to create."</TE>
<TE>   Then he expands on that explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "As a critic, I know that what artists talk about most of the time
in trying to explain their work is nonsense," he says. "If they could
say it, they wouldn't need to paint it or sculpt it. It's beyond
language."</TE>

<LD>I awoke at 3:45 a.m. one recent Saturday to an intense bright light
shining in our bedroom. We live on the fourth floor of one of the
historic buildings on Spring Street in downtown L.A. I lay in bed and
tried to ignore the unusually bright, white-hot street lights that
were glaring through our horizontal blinds. I thought, "Man, these
street lights are bright tonight."</LD>
<LD>   Then I heard the hollering of film crews to accompany the
intermittent noise of what sounded like diesel engines and airlifts.
At about 4:30 a.m. I got up and peered through the blinds to see the
source of the blinding light. I felt invaded and violated when I saw
a man standing in the box of a cherry picker no more than 15 feet
away from my bedroom window, shining a high-powered spotlight
directly at my bedroom window. They were shining this light directly
at our bedroom window for over an hour. I later learned the
production was "The Singing Detective."</LD>
<TE>   I understand the parking lots on each side of our building charge
somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 a day for rental. How much
should I charge them for using my bedroom window as a reflector and
greatly violating and disturbing my wife and me during our sleep?
Maybe I should find out where the executive producer lives and shine
a giant light in his bedroom while yelling and running various types
of loud machinery in the yard, while he or she and spouse try to
sleep after a long week.</TE>

<LD>One wonders what certain dead bluesmen would think of finally having
their voices heard by millions of people, only to discover that the
artist listed on the record is some guy named Moby ("What Do You See,
Moby?" by Robert Hilburn, May 12). Let's hope that Senor Moby's
much-flaunted version of Christianity doesn't include a heaven where
he meets these bluesmen, or there may be mucho trouble in paradise.</LD>

chords was by a member of the band Spinal Tap. Hmmm.</LD>

<LD>I have been a longtime fan of Yes and other progressive rock bands
mostly because of the creative force that guides them. Not the
31/2-minute commercial hit that the record companies demand. How many
bands have had the intestinal fortitude or creative prowess to
release a double album with just four tracks?</LD>
<LD>   You can say what you want about Yes, the good and the bad, but I
thank them for honoring their art, not the lowest common denominator.
There is too much of that.</LD>

<TE>   Enough already with the ridiculous debate about the questionable
credibility and talent (or lack thereof) regarding Yes (Letters,
April 28, May 5, May 12, May 19).</TE>
<TE>   Do we really care that much about a bunch of aging rockers who
experienced their heyday more than 20 years ago? Come on. Let's get
on to more important and pressing matters. Like, can anyone find me a
reasonably priced ticket to the Rolling Stones' Wiltern Theatre show
in November?</TE>

<LD>About a quarter-century ago, I was a student of Max Hendler at Cal
State Northridge ("So Simple, Yet So Difficult to Arrive At," by
Hunter Drohojowska-Philp, May 19). It was a good time. Hans Burkhardt
was also teaching there.</LD>
<LD>   I remember Hendler's super-realistic still-life that he would
spend a couple of years painting. He was an inspirational teacher and
continues to be a great artist. His encouragement has brought me
great satisfaction, success and happiness as an artist.</LD>

<HD>Bargain Matinees Aren't</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What happened to the bargain matinee? As an actor living in Westwood,
I am blessed with many movie choices each day. Today I was shocked to
pay $7 for a bargain matinee. There was a total of 3 people in the
house for the 3:45 show. If the price was $5, there would have been
at least 15 people and the theater would have made five times as
much. But what do I know, after reading more than $3-billion worth of
market research every month while working at some of the biggest ad
agencies in the world? While working in Japan on Coca-Cola, I found
they use a 100-year plan for their marketing strategy. Perhaps that's
one reason why Detroit was humbled. The short-term thinking and
incompetence we suffer every day could bring this country to its
knees.</LD>
<LD>   The headlines and long lines at the banks are obvious. The bargain
matinee with three people in a room that seats 300 is more subtle.
Wake up, Hollywood, and brew some fresh coffee for America while
you're at it.</LD>

<HD>Out to Change Minds</HD>
<DH>Mixing rap and other genres, a radical duo plays
blasphemous songs that upend gender stereotypes and preach
acceptance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bitch and Animal. It sounds like some dangerous, pro-wrestling chick
tag team, but it's actually the name of two musically inclined young
women whose stance is much more radical.</LD>
<LD>   The Brooklyn-based underground duo mixes rap, funk, pop, folk and
spoken word into frank, sometimes crude and often hilarious songs
that zing gender stereotypes, glorify the female body and celebrate
pot-smoking.</LD>
<LD>   Despite their unconventional views, the hard-touring pals say they
have won over some unlikely listeners, such as the patrons at a
Virginia Navy bar and an after-work crowd of bankers in an upscale
New England watering hole.</LD>
<TE>   "People are more open than the media makes them out to be," says
Animal, 26. "That's one of the biggest things I've learned. The
majority of people [at our shows] are younger women, and in the
beginning it was a surprise to me when [other] people would show up
and like it. But now I'm just excited when I see mixed crowds."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, given the wide-ranging material on their second album,
"Eternally Hard," it would take the uninitiated awhile just to figure
out where the pair is coming from. The blithely blasphemous, pro-pot
"Ganja" is scarcely more than a lark. But they do seek to change
minds with a percussive, spoken-word piece aimed at freeing a popular
slang word for "vagina" from its association with the pejorative. And
Animal's clever rap about the travails of a well-equipped lesbian
playa brilliantly mocks hip-hop's sexual braggadocio.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, such broken-relationship songs as "Scrap Metal"
and "Six States Away" reflect the raw human vulnerability at the core
of B&amp;A's work. It's the thing that helps make the sex-positive
feminism of "Sparkly Queen Areola" or the gender-bent lament of "Boy
Girl Wonder" into universal statements of wanting to be accepted for
who you are.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in their kitsch-festooned RV outside the Silver Lake
nightclub Spaceland before a recent performance, the exuberant
pair--who worship Joni Mitchell and refuse to divulge their real
names--look disarmingly like punk rock Muppets for grown-ups.</TE>
<TE>   They're as strikingly complementary as Bert and Ernie, but much
more colorful. Bitch, 29, is tall and curvy, and tends to wear her
hair in multiple braids or wild ponytails. A classically trained
violinist, she also sings and plays bass. Tiny, boyish, spiky-haired
Animal is the rapper and human beat box who plays percussion
instruments and ukulele. Like a lot of drummers, Animal often
unconsciously taps rhythms on the RV kitchenette's tiny tabletop.</TE>
<TE>   They released their debut album, "What's That Smell?," in 1999,
but they gained wider recognition from like-minded audiences after
going on the road with feminist singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco, who
co-produced "Eternally Hard" and released it last fall on her
Righteous Babe Records label.</TE>
<TE>   "Touring with Ani definitely put the fire under the pan for us,"
Bitch says. "It just opened us up to all these people."</TE>
<TE>   Before assuming their noms de rock, Bitch and Animal met at a
Chicago acting school in 1994, and their stream-of-consciousness
jamming became an antidote to the pressures of school and work.</TE>
<TE>   "We had fun, and it was like communicating in this [different]
language, because we didn't have" lyrics, Animal says.</TE>
<TE>   After going their separate ways when done with school, the pair
reunited in 1997 to perform at a women's film festival in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Just as something had clicked when they first met, so the
lightbulb went on for them after that first gig.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd walked into this cafe, and it was filled with these hip
girls," Bitch explains. "People were giving us shade. We felt
slighted. Then, after we played, people were being nice to us. We
[just decided] that our goal in the world was to get people to
realize they have to [respect] people instantly and not just wait to
be proven to. So we were like, 'Let's go, honey! We're gonna take
over the world.'"</TE>
<TE>   So far they've only been able to quit their day jobs, but they do
have some grand plans, from recording a new album later this year to
making a movie to writing a "top secret" musical. Every step they
make is progress to Bitch and Animal, who looked to DiFranco's
self-starting, bit-by-bit example long before they met or worked with
her.</TE>
<TE>   "She was driving around the country and playing shows," Bitch says
of DiFranco's early days. "She wasn't hanging out in New York waiting
for her big break. And we were like, 'Oh. We could do that.'"</TE>
<TE>   DiFranco, who first heard about the duo after a Righteous Babe
staffer saw B&amp;A at one of their free weekly gigs in Provincetown,
Mass., was struck by the duo's "energy, their humor, their rawness.
They're just straight-up, real, fearless performers," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "I had kind of a kinship there with them as just, you know, girls
who get away with saying stuff. You can really say anything [if you
have] a devious smile on your face."</TE>
<TE>   Still, DiFranco emphasizes, B&amp;A is not a novelty act.</TE>
<TE>   "Because they have these crazy tunes, there's a tendency for
people to reduce them to that, there's much more to it. Their songs
follow them through all of their emotions and moods, so it's
definitely very human and broader."</TE>
<TE>   Being exposed to DiFranco's audience has been particularly
valuable to B&amp;A, as their opportunities to be heard are limited.
Regarding radio airplay, Animal says wryly, "I think our whole CD is
banned."</TE>
<TE>   The duo frequently employs humor in its lyrics and stage banter to
help compensate for the pain of being viewed as different. Although,
truthfully, they're pretty well-adjusted.</TE>
<TE>   Animal says Bitch taught her to be less apprehensive about what
other people will think of her. "I used to be so tense, because I got
harassed a lot in Chicago," Animal says. Down in the South, where
people thought she was a man, "I'd get yelled at for going in the
wrong restroom."</TE>
<TE>   But eventually she took to heart Bitch's philosophy of gaining
respect simply by assuming people will give it. "I look just as
freaky as I always have," Animal says. "But I don't feel like I get
harassed as much."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, that I'm-OK-you're-OK attitude is a major part of Bitch
and Animal's appeal. As angry as they can get about the injustices
they address, they never let their frustration get in the way of the
fun or the message. Which helps keep people's attention, even while
putting across some pretty outrageous-to-the-mainstream ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "We're people," Bitch says simply. "Love and heartbreak, it's all
the same no matter who the players are."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," agrees Animal with a mischievous snicker. "It doesn't
matter if you're not a lesbian; you can still like us."</TE>

<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever since puny CDs supplanted foot-square LPs in the marketplace,
many fans and label art directors have lamented that the world of
album art just isn't as much fun as it used to be, with creative
cover design diminishing in proportion to the size of the product.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Ochs is doing something about it.</LD>
<LD>   The Venice archivist, whose vast collection of music-related art
and artifacts is the preeminent pop-music resource for books, movies,
TV shows and album reissue packaging, is recruiting renowned visual
artists to design what they call "The Greatest Album Covers That
Never Were." Ochs and project partner Craig Butler have put together
a roster of nearly 100 artists for the project.</LD>
<TE>   "We're asking them to pick their favorite recording artist and do
the definitive cover for that artist at any point in their career,"
Ochs says. "We're not asking for alternate covers to real
albums--there's no way to redo [the Beatles'] 'Revolver' or 'Sgt.
Pepper's.' But they could do the Beatles during the 'Revolver'
period, for example."</TE>
<TE>   The results will be assembled in an exhibition that will debut
with a five-month run at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland
in September 2003, and then travel around the country. A coffee table
book will also be published. Artists will retain ownership of their
pieces, but Ochs hopes most will be donated and sold for charity. He
will give updates about the project through his Web site,
www.michaelochs.com.</TE>
<TE>   Artists range from John Van Hamersveld (designer of the Beatles'
"Magical Mystery Tour" and the Rolling Stones' "Exile on Main Street"
covers) to political poster artist Robbie Conal. Their list of
musical acts is just as broad.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I'd have to channel [the selection of artists] more to
cover the complete gamut of music," says Ochs. "But it goes from
Robert Johnson to the Blue Man Group."</TE>
<TE>   Van Hamersveld, who hasn't done an album cover since Public
Image's "This Is What You Want" in 1984, has chosen Ray Charles as
his subject and is excited to have another go with a free hand. There
isn't even input from the musician, let alone label executives.</TE>
<TE>   "The demise of the album cover via CDs and the emphasis on MTV
images ruined it for me," says L.A.-based Van Hamersveld. "I haven't
done one in so long that I'm taking pleasure in doing one in the
larger format, which gives that dynamic of how people lived through
that kind of singular image."</TE>
<TE>   Public Image's John Lydon "found me and confessed that the 'Exile
on Main Street' cover was used as an example of ways of conveying and
communicating their punk movement in 1976. When people talk about
that kind of stuff, it's very powerful."</TE>
<TE>   John Dismukes, who moved from doing album art for such rock bands
as Y&amp;T in the '80s to designing everything from the "Jurassic Park:
The Lost World" logo to a Britney Spears marketing campaign, also
jumped at the chance to do a fantasy cover. He picked Ozzy Osbourne.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be fun," he says. "A lot of times when you're
working on projects there are restrictions. If you're selling in
Kmart, you can't put bloody skulls or something. This has no
restrictions. The concept I'm doing is the history of Ozzy, from when
he was a little kid to today, trying to put that all into one
canvas."</TE>
<TE>   NONSECULAR: P.O.D. is known as a Christian presence in the largely
heathen hard-rock world. Now the San Diego band is starting its own
record label. But don't expect it to insist that its acts hold prayer
sessions before shows or anything. There will be no litmus test of
belief for the label, says P.O.D. manager Tim Cook.</TE>
<TE>   "I suppose on a personal level, they wouldn't sign anything
directly against their faith," Cook says. "But that hasn't been said
to me." In fact, the yet-unnamed label's first signing, Swedish band
Blindside, stemmed from the rock evangelism of P.O.D.'s fans.</TE>
<TE>   "P.O.D. has this huge network of fans around the world called the
Warriors," Cook says. "Blindside's been a band for seven years, and
P.O.D. has been following them for five years. [The interest] was
driven by the kids, and P.O.D. wanted to be part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Blindside's U.S. debut album, "Silence," is set for release Aug.
20 in a partnership between P.O.D.'s label and Elektra Records. The
band can already be seen in a cameo in P.O.D.'s current video,
"Boom," cast as the Swedish pingpong team.</TE>
<TE>   LAW AND ORDER: Microchips are being put in pets to help identify
them in case of loss or theft, and there's talk of doing the same for
children.</TE>
<TE>   What about guitars? That's the aim of a new venture called Snagg.</TE>
<TE>   With Music Trade magazine reporting that more than a million
musical instruments are stolen annually, the program offers an easy
way for law enforcement to identify and recover such goods.</TE>
<TE>   Under Snagg, the brainchild of musician Don Baskin (singer of the
'60s band Syndicate of Sound) and music publicist Jeff Albright,
small chips encoded with ID numbers are embedded in instruments, and
owners pay a registration fee. The chip can be read by a hand-held
scanner and the number then matched via the registry.</TE>
<TE>   Albright says that Fender Musical Instruments began implanting the
chips in new guitars late last year, with 30,000 already done.
Distribution of scanners to police departments around the nation will
begin shortly, as will a program through which music stores can
install chips in older instruments.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Tom Waits put together a band featuring Primus' Les
Claypool on bass, Bad Religion's Brett Gurewitz on guitar and Casey
Waits (his 16-year-old son) on drums to record "The Return of Jackie
and Judy" for the Ramones tribute album being overseen by Rob Zombie.
"We're a Happy Family," which also features U2, the Red Hot Chili
Peppers, Metallica and the Pretenders, among others, is due this
summer from Columbia Records.... A new Brian Wilson recording of a
previously unreleased Beach Boys song, "California Feelin'," will be
featured on "Classics ... Selected by Brian Wilson," an album of the
group's hits hand-picked by the primary composer and designer of the
music. Choices range from the obvious ("California Girls," "Good
Vibrations") to the obscure ("Time to Get Alone," "We're Together
Again"), with Wilson's liner notes explaining his picks. The Capitol
release is due July 2.... With the Black Crowes on indefinite hiatus,
guitarist Rich Robinson has produced a live album using recordings of
the group's final two shows in Boston last October. The set is due in
August from V2 Records. His brother, singer Chris Robinson, is
working on a new project using the name New Earth Mud.... Josh Homme
of the Queens of the Stone Age has written and performed a new song,
"All the Same," for the movie "The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys." It
was directed by his friend Peter Care and is scheduled to open June
14 in L.A. and New York before going national. Soundtrack release
plans are not finalized yet.</TE>

<LD>   TOM VARNER</LD>
<LD>   "Second Communion"</LD>
<TE>   OmniTone</TE>
<TE>   For nearly two decades, Varner has argued passionately--through
his recordings and performances--for the role of the French horn in
jazz. With "Second Communion," he achieves a breakthrough, moving
well beyond the novelty facets of the instrument and into the realm
of original, deeply substantive improvisation and composition.
Moreover, he does so by picking a daunting task for himself: a homage
to Don Cherry, the iconoclastic trumpeter-bandleader who was at the
forefront of the "free jazz" movement of the late 1950s and
thereafter. Specifically, Varner has fashioned his response to
Cherry's landmark "Complete Communion" suite, with Varner's French
horn taking the role of Cherry's cornet and trumpet. Considering that
Cherry's recording is nearly 40 years old, one is struck by the
urgency and freshness of Varner's reappraisal. Like the original,
Varner's "Second Communion" features exquisitely well-crafted,
gloriously unfettered dialogue among all the players, with searing
work from tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby, bassist Cameron Brown and
percussionist Matt Wilson, plus guests Peter McCann on guitar and
Dave Ballou on cornet. As if this weren't enough, Varner has
bookended the "Communion" music with first-rate compositions of his
own, each evoking the revolutionary spirit of post-'50s
experimentation while subtly incorporating more contemporary sounds.
By any measure, a tour de force.</TE>

<TE>   DR. MICHAEL WHITE</TE>
<TE>   "Jazz From the Soul</TE>
<TE>   of New Orleans"</TE>
<TE>   Basin Street</TE>
<TE>   Great jazz clarinetists are not easy to come by these days,
despite a slight resurgence of interest in the instrument during the
'90s. Yet, among those who have championed the clarinet in recent
years, none has proved more persuasive in classic New Orleans style
than White, whose latest release reaffirms his stature among elite
jazz reedists. The luster of his tone, the expressive power of his
vibrato and--above all--the melodic ingenuity of his improvisations
have become his signatures. Consider the two extended solos White
plays in George Gershwin's "Summertime," which he transforms into a
stunning blues reverie. Recalling techniques associated with earlier
generations of New Orleans clarinetists, including cunning
syncopations and ferociously bent pitches, White underscores the
timelessness of vintage New Orleans style. Yet this disc, recorded
with considerable clarity and warmth, never sounds old-fashioned, in
part because of the sheer exuberance of tracks such as "Hindustan"
and "Fidgety Feet," smartly dispatched by White and his traditional
jazz band.</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2</TE>
<TE>   SIDNEY BECHET SOCIETY</TE>
<TE>   "Jam Session Concert"</TE>
<TE>   Nagel-Heyer</TE>
<TE>   Though all the world reveres the great Louis Armstrong, the
general listening public barely remembers his equally gifted
contemporary, New Orleans reedist Sidney Bechet. This ebullient live
session should go a long way toward stoking appreciation of Bechet,
thanks both to Evan Christopher's soaring, steeped-in-blue clarinet
solos and the sheer optimism and freedom of the ensemble
improvisation. With Christopher's vocal-like arabesques answered by
the plunger-muted exhortations of trombonist Wycliffe Gordon (best
known for his work with Wynton Marsalis' septet and Lincoln Center
Jazz Orchestra), "Jam Session Concert" conveys the unpretentious,
high-flying swing playing of an earlier, less complicated era.</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   TWO FOR BRAZIL</TE>
<TE>   "Plays the Standards"</TE>
<TE>   Jazzmin</TE>
<TE>   Ever since the bossa nova craze of the '60s, Americans have been
smitten with Brazilian jazz, and exquisitely seductive recordings by
groups such as Two for Brazil help explain why. The
duo--guitarist-vocalist Paulinho Garcia and saxophonist Greg
Fishman--plays a music that's as soft and gentle as a tropical
breeze. To hear Garcia's whispering vocals accompanied by Fishman's
insinuating phrases on tenor saxophone and flute is to savor one of
the most effective duos working in this idiom today. Although they
take on standards such as "We'll Be Together Again" and "'Round
Midnight," Garcia and Fishman make them sound as if they had been
composed on a beach in Sao Paulo. Imagine, in other words, the vocals
of Joao Gilberto accompanied by Stan Getz on winds, and you have a
rough idea of the lush, sweetly lyric appeal of Two for Brazil.</TE>

<LD>One familiar element of news reports involving a fatality is the
comment by friends or relatives that they were unaware of major
aspects of the departed's life. Or what they thought they knew was
wrong. Friends of Sgt. Gene Vance Jr., who was recently killed in
Afghanistan, knew he was strong and vigorous and loved challenges but
were surprised to learn he was in the Special Forces, for instance.</LD>
<LD>   Everybody has secrets. But few of us pause to ponder the real
message of those puzzled people quoted in the newspaper: We often
misjudge others, even some close to us, on incomplete information. At
no time is that more apparent than during this annual season of
reunions--the school kind, these days, and later in the summer, the
family kind.</LD>
<LD>   Reunions aren't for everyone. Many dodge them as useless attempts
to recapture youth and stale memories or as unwelcome reminders of
unhappy times. Others approach the get-togethers cautiously but
curiously, like returning to a childhood home to see how the familiar
place and that frontyard sapling have weathered the years.</LD>
<TE>   The fifth, 10th and 15th school reunions can be forced affairs
with classmates more eager to impress than to learn about others.
Later--say, the 30th or 40th--reunions seem more personally revealing
about character, the welcome wisdom that comes accidentally with
passing time and the inevitable vagaries of accumulating years.
Everyone is much older by then--and can't hide it. There's more
comfort with who we are and what we have or have not done. The tales
of yesteryear are perhaps taller, and fonder. But it's not what
you're recounting that matters so much as that you're sharing the
story. Alums who once spent four formative years together now share
two formulaic days and an unspoken celebration of simply surviving.</TE>
<TE>   These reunions contain several categories of attendees--those who
live vividly in our memory, those who hover vaguely in the shadows of
time and strangers who look like aging newcomers. Attending spouses
deserve medals for patience. Typically, the class leaders of yore
remain the leaders today, but are quieter. The wilder, louder pals
from before remain, well, the same, only less so. But the nerds, who
weren't called that then, turn out to be awfully good people; in
fact, they can be a whole lot more interesting now than the ones who
seemed so captivating so long ago. A few classmates are gone; others
struggle with health. Silently, class members share duties pushing
the wheelchair, making space at the table and wordlessly delaying the
class photo till their newly stubborn old friend arranges the blanket
over his malfunctioning legs.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing there worthy of Page 1. But not insignificant lessons to
acquire on a May weekend, even this long and this far out of the
classrooms of youth.</TE>

<HD>Tailor Teaching to the Child</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Providing public education is among the most important duties of
government. However, as demands on public schools increase and public
budgets ebb and flow, private-sector help is all the more valued.</LD>
<LD>   A promising new program at Cal State Northridge, funded by $7
million from the family foundation of Michael Eisner, will train
teachers to work with children who have different learning styles.
The aim is to teach them how to unlock students' ability to learn
rather than write off some children as learning-disabled or
disciplinary problems.</LD>
<LD>   The Northridge program will focus on research by Dr. Mel Levine, a
professor of pediatrics at the University of North Carolina Medical
School who has analyzed how the brain works and used the information
to help children sometimes improperly classified as having learning
or behavioral problems.</LD>
<TE>   In his book "A Mind at a Time," the doctor asserts that children
can learn even if they can't sit still in a classroom, can't memorize
quickly or can't follow directions that require the completion of
tasks in sequential order. He challenges the frequent diagnoses of
attention deficit disorder--which can stick children with an onerous
label--and prescribes multiple approaches.</TE>
<TE>   Dyslexic children, particularly boys, were once humiliated by
teachers who considered them "reading retarded"; in many cases, IQ
tests later indicated a high aptitude out of sync with a poor
performance. Many developed outstanding memories to compensate for
their inability to read.</TE>
<TE>   Consider a dyslexic L.A. businessman, Roger Cormi, who made his
fortune leasing and maintaining greenery in commercial buildings but
did not learn to read until he was in his 60s. In his late 70s, Cormi
was back in school, in the learning disabilities program at Santa Ana
College. Upon his death last year, Cormi left nearly $500,000 to the
program.</TE>
<TE>   Dyslexic children are more readily diagnosed today if classroom
teachers refer them for a battery of tests, which should lead to an
individual education program. Yet many poor readers are not assessed
early or competently. Their reading difficulties worsen, and they may
be erroneously placed in special education. Children should not be
diverted into costly special-ed classes if they don't belong there.
That's even more important when school budgets shrink.</TE>
<TE>   Programs that help teachers tailor their approaches may not only
turn potential problem children into eager students but also help
public education through fiscal tough times.</TE>

<LD>The campaign to keep Los Angeles united got off to a low-key but
noteworthy start Thursday, one day after a government commission
moved to put San Fernando Valley secession to a November citywide
vote. Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and former Mayor Richard
Riordan told a gaggle of reporters at City Hall that they would work
together to keep the city that both love from breaking apart. Their
joint appearance struck the right tone--positive--and the right
symbolism: two erstwhile adversaries working together, not walking
away from their differences.</LD>
<LD>   There's been a lot of speculation, at least among political
junkies, about how Hahn is going to run this unprecedented campaign.
Secession advocates are old pros already, having spent years stoking
discontent to get their measure on the ballot. They turned Hahn's
description of secession as a "disaster of biblical proportions" to
their advantage by branding it a scare tactic. It was no more an
exaggeration than their own sales pitch for a utopian Camelot, but a
smart campaign needn't give the other side ammunition.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, Hahn and other supporters of a united city need to challenge
secessionists to explain how, exactly, smashing Los Angeles to pieces
would significantly improve things. The burden should be on those
promoting a breakup to prove that different is automatically better.
The mayor and those who want to keep Los Angeles as one dynamic city
need to speak out when the secessionists' assertions are
unsubstantiated. But the mayor and other advocates also need to make
the case for keeping Los Angeles whole. This city, after all, has
attributes any campaign manager would love--money, looks, great name
recognition, a can-do attitude and a generosity of spirit when times
get tough.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan was everywhere after the Northridge earthquake, rallying
federal and private resources, guiding the city to a remarkable
recovery. He was there to lead reform of the city's 75-year-old
charter, largely in response to Valley residents' complaints that
City Hall was distant and inattentive. The result is 30-and-counting
new neighborhood councils, regional planning commissions that give
neighborhoods a say in land-use decisions and an independent
redistricting commission that, come July 1, will yield a fifth City
Council district fully contained in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Riordan, Hahn also hopes to enlist runoff rival and former
Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa and former mayoral opponents
Steve Soboroff and Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles). The more--and
the more varied--voices he can recruit, the better, from
basketball-star-turned-entrepreneur Earvin "Magic" Johnson to
schoolteachers, shopkeepers and neighborhood activists. Remember,
it's not Hahn's city to lose--it's all of ours. Don't wait to be
asked to speak up.</TE>

<HD>State's Physicians Pained by Loss of Medical Groups</HD>
<DH>Closings and consolidations are symptomatic of financial

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Nina Leslie took over as chief executive of troubled Pacific
Health Care Medical Group in Pleasanton, Calif., in December 2000,
she looked over the finances to assess its chances for staying in
business. What she found wasn't encouraging.</LD>
<LD>   The group's office lease was up and it didn't have enough money
for moving expenses, much less for the sky-high rents in the Bay
Area. The chief financial officer, on the job for only two weeks,
quit four days after Leslie came on board.</LD>
<LD>   Pacific Health was far behind on paying claims and in implementing
a new computer system. The company had no cash reserves to speak of,
largely due to a practice of distributing excess cash at the end of
the year to the group's doctors. Leslie, with 32 years of management
experience, told the doctors that the excess money would be needed to
build reserves.</LD>
<TE>   When the doctors refused, she said, she saw little future for the
group. "I knew this was going to be a sad story and I had to be the
bearer of bad news," said Leslie, who now works as a part-time
consultant for Arcadian Management Services in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The 36,400-patient Pacific Health Care Medical Group, which
completed its shutdown Jan. 31, is one of seven California medical
groups that had ceased to operate through March 31--and three more
are in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, according to data from
Cattaneo &amp; Stroud Inc., a Burlingame, Calif., consulting firm that
tracks the financial indicators of medical groups. That's roughly on
par with the pace in 2001, when 26 California medical groups shut
down. Thirty-four closed in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Closings and consolidations among California's medical groups
continue as the economic forces roiling the health-care industry push
doctors into ever-larger groups in the search for cost savings and
bargaining power with insurers.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates of the number of remaining medical groups in California
vary from a low of about 250 to 380.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a statistic that is closely tracked, but the state
Department of Managed Health Care has some context for the changing
landscape, noting that the number of medical groups with HMO
contracts dropped 25% to 300 in the last year, from about 400 in
2000. The change includes failures and mergers as well as medical
groups that were dumped by HMOs.</TE>
<TE>   Several experts say the trend of medical-group failures will
continue unless smaller medical groups can gain some
contract-negotiating clout through mergers and acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   "The business reality we see is that it will be very hard for a
medical group with 20,000 members or even 50,000 members to operate
in California as a separate entity," said Gregger Viggen, a spokesman
for Mercer Human Resource Consulting.</TE>
<TE>   Others say the situation was inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "There are simply too many medical groups in the state," said
Albert Lowey-Ball, president of a Sacramento management consulting
firm. "They will need much better financial management and an
increasingly strong reserve requirement to survive."</TE>
<TE>   Making matters worse for medical groups, say other experts, are
rising costs driven by new medical devices and technology and reduced
funding from Medicare and Medi-Cal.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, the medical groups have been self-defeating,
building up administrative bureaucracies that cut into the money for
doctors, Leslie said. The doctors demand more and leave the group
when they can't get it.</TE>
<TE>   "The HMOs take 10% to 20% off the top and give a low payment to
the medical group. But the medical group or IPA gets another 10% to
14%, leaving less for the doctors." Leslie said. (IPAs are
physician-directed networks in which participating doctors enjoy the
benefits of a larger organization while controlling their own
practices.)</TE>
<TE>   Many more medical groups are in deep trouble, such as the
University Affiliates Medical Group IPA in Alhambra and the Emergency
Physician Medical Group at the St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing terribly. We're in a major crisis," said Dr. Daniel
Higgins, medical director for emergency services for the St. Francis
group. The group lost millions in unpaid bills when the medical
groups for which it performed emergency services went bankrupt,
Higgins said. Only 7% or 8% of its bill payers are current, said the
group's billing service. The rest are in arrears and 40% of those are
120 days or more overdue.</TE>
<TE>   University Affiliates was locked in a struggle to obtain higher
payments for its doctors from Blue Cross of California, which is part
of powerful WellPoint Health Networks Inc., one of the nation's
largest insurers. It was a mismatch. Blue Cross said no, and
University Affiliates will have to survive without Blue Cross, which
accounts for 45% of its business, if its next negotiating session
fails.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Sam J.W. Romeo, University Affiliates president and chief
executive, said health plans are putting medical groups out of
business with low payments so they can "continue funneling premium
dollars into the pockets of their well-heeled executives and
shareholders."</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross of California said Romeo's charges are "a desperate
last-ditch effort from a medical group suffering from systemic
financial losses and years of operating difficulties."</TE>
<TE>   Sudden health-plan bankruptcy filings, most notably by Tower
Health and Maxicare in 2001, also were fatal for some medical groups
that had too much, if not all, of their business with one insurer.</TE>
<TE>   That was true of Bay West IPA and Bloodless Options Medical Group,
both formerly of Woodland Hills. Bloodless Options closed in August
2001; its sole contract was with Maxicare, said Kimberly Carey, who
worked as an administrator for both groups under a contract with her
employer, Medpoint Management Inc. Bay West had much of its business
with Tower Health, Carey said.</TE>
<TE>   "They had no chance," she said. "In the old days, a medical group
could have a relationship with just one HMO. Not anymore."</TE>
<TE>   For their part, HMOs are expanding their use of direct contracts
with individual doctors instead of or in addition to reaching
agreements with medical groups. That would allow higher payments to
doctors, say the health plans, because they won't have to pay for the
high administrative costs of the groups. The health plans also say
it's a better move for patients, because it ensures that they will be
able to remain with their doctor if the medical group fails.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say managed care is responsible for some of the
administrative overhead it decries, and that patients will not be
helped when their doctors leave an organized medical group.</TE>
<TE>   "Managed care has meant that the medical groups have had to hire
more clerks to deal with more paperwork to get approvals. Doctors and
nurses spend their time on the telephone to finally nail down
referrals, tests, medication," said Peter Boland, a health-care
industry expert.</TE>
<TE>   Having doctors working on their own isn't necessarily good, some
say.</TE>
<TE>   "Going back to a cottage industry of individual doctors' practices
would be a detriment to patients," said Viggen of Mercer Human
Resource Consulting. "There won't be a well-thought-out asthma
treatment that a medical group would have, and access [will be
reduced] to the kind of technology that can monitor whether your
patient bought the inhaler you prescribed. Individual doctors lose
touch with the rest of the medical system."</TE>
<TE>   Most doctors have multiple affiliations and can move their
patients to another medical group without disruption in care or
costs. But there are times, medical experts say, when a patient
arrives at the doctor's new office only to find that the new medical
group isn't affiliated with the patient's health plan. The patient
then must choose between switching doctors or paying a greater
out-of-pocket expense for seeing an out-of-network physician.</TE>
<TE>   That's another reason some physicians, such as Romeo and Dr. Jack
Lewin, chief executive of the California Medical Assn., say medical
group failures must be prevented and that the state's Department of
Managed Health Care should intervene.</TE>
<TE>   But Daniel Zingale, director of the health-care department, said
his office's goal is preserving the ability of patients to continue
to see their doctors, not "intervening in a dispute to see that one
side or the other gets a bigger share of profits."</TE>
<TE>   The California Medical Assn. is sponsoring a bill in the
Legislature, AB 1600, that it says would require Zingale to step into
such disputes to ensure that contracts and reimbursement packages
between medical groups and health plans are fair.</TE>
<TE>   But the sad part, Boland said, is that "most medical groups
haven't the foggiest notion of whether they will be well off or not.
The doctors' offices are no longer profitable. For most, the best is
break even.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not clear how this is going to work out."</TE>

<HD>Putin, Bush Seek Economic Payoff From Summit in Russia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES FLANIGAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not to minimize the significance of agreements on nuclear arms and
cooperation in the fight against terrorism, but business was the most
important topic at the summit meeting in Russia of Presidents Bush
and Vladimir Putin this weekend in Russia.</LD>
<LD>   The summit set the stage for greater U.S. investment and
collaboration with Russia on energy, trade, technology and economic
development. Washington is slated shortly to elevate Russia's status
as a trading partner and to support Russia's entry to the World Trade
Organization.</LD>
<LD>   The moves are important for U.S. strategic interests. But they are
critical for Russia, which needs U.S. investment and business ties.
And indeed, American companies and investment managers are eager to
work with Russia.</LD>
<TE>   But there are obstacles in Russia's legal and financial structure.
Reports of corruption are legion, and in some cases in the last
decade, U.S. companies' properties in Russia have been seized by
local officials on spurious grounds. Putin, however, is credited with
quelling some of the gangster behavior that character- ized Russian
business in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   And there is momentum for change. In a key ceremony at the weekend
summit, U.S. and Russian business people handed Putin and Bush
recommendations for improving commercial relations. The suggestions
include judicial reform and protection of property rights in Russia
and for Congress to repeal laws and regulations that limit doing
business with Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Enthusiasm is running high for opportunities in Russia, a country
of 144 million and a technologically proficient work force, a
reemerging middle class and enormous natural resources.</TE>
<TE>   Two conferences among Russian and U.S. aerospace and infor- mation
technology companies accompanied the summit meeting. Russian
programmers increasingly provide software development services to
U.S. companies; Russian aerospace firms are discussing joint
development and production of regional jets with Boeing Co.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. business has been beating a path to Russia. A week ago, 120
U.S. pension fund investment managers came to a conference in Moscow
to discuss ways to overhaul Russia's pension system to free $1
billion for investment in the economy. The investment managers also
scouted opportunities for U.S. funds to invest in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   A month ago, 17 U.S. entre- preneurs and 20 Russian business
owners met in Moscow to hold the first U.S.-Russia Women's Business
Leaders Summit. The business environment is vibrant, says Patricia
Cloherty, chairwoman of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund, a
government- sponsored venture dating to the early 1990s that has
invested more than $200 million in small Russian companies. The fund
has raised $100 million more to invest in companies such as
Lomonosov, a 300-year-old St. Petersburg porcelain maker, and Saint
Springs, a bottled water company partly owned by the Russian Orthodox
Church.</TE>
<TE>   Vibrancy notwithstanding, the Russian economy faces severe
challenges. That's why Putin has reached out to the West and
particularly to the Bush administration since Sept. 11, offering the
oil and gas resources of Russia and the former Soviet republics in
exchange for increased investment and trade.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Russian Economy Is Growing Again</TE>
<TE>   Russia needs more than $600 billion of foreign investment in its
economy in the next 20 years but is taking in less than $4 billion a
year, says economist Keith Bush of the U.S.-Russia Business Council,
a Washington-based group that includes the largest U.S. companies.</TE>
<TE>   Russia needs to invest in health care. Life expectancy for men and
women has declined in the last 10 years and is now 10% to 20% below
that of the U.S. and other developed countries. Russia's birthrate
also is declining.</TE>
<TE>   Why then should U.S. business be enthusiastic about investing in
Russia? Because after a decade of decline, including the collapse of
Russia's currency and default on the country's debts in 1998, the
Russian economy has stabilized and is growing again.</TE>
<TE>   "Putin brought political stability and that more than anything has
helped the economy," says Charles Keefe, managing partner of the
Moscow office of Coudert Bros., an international law firm.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government wants to help Russia develop its oil and gas
resources because the vast country and its neighboring republics hold
enough oil reserves to offset the unstable Middle East. Bush and
Putin agreed Friday to "cooperate on investment" to develop oil and
gas in Siberia and the Far East.</TE>
<TE>   Exxon Mobil Corp. is leading a $15-billion project to develop oil
and gas off Sakhalin Island that should be completed by 2005. BP and
ChevronTexaco Corp. are investing in other parts of Russia and
neighboring republics. And U.S. oil service firms, including
Halliburton Co., Schlumberger Ltd. and Parker Drilling Co., are
working to improve flow of oil and gas in Russia's traditional fields
in western Siberia.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Russia is strategic in a world at war. Its armed forces
number about 1.5 million, although there are plans to end the draft
and reduce the military forces by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An Emphasis on Science and Technology</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. business is enthusiastic simply because Russia has an
abundance of scientists and technologists, including a lively
information technology sector centered in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
There are about 8,000 Russian programmers but a "population of more
than 1 million scientists and technologists," says Esther Dyson,
chairman of Edventure Holdings, a New York-based high-tech company
that invests in Russian Internet firms.</TE>
<TE>   The information industry is in an early stage in Russia, but even
so, Russian programmers--em- ployed by the Moscow-based company
Luxoft--are rivaling those of India as sources of software and
problem-solving for U.S. companies, including Intel Corp., Sun
Microsystems Inc. and Boeing, which use their expertise for
sophisticated problem solving.</TE>
<TE>   The reach of information technology business is impressive.
Typhoon Software, a small Santa Barbara firm, employs 40 programmers
in St. Petersburg who provide software for start-up companies backed
by Anacapa Ventures, a small venture capital firm specializing in
California's Central Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Russian programmers work cheap, averaging $500 to $1,000 a month.
But that is partly because Russian industry has not yet adopted
information systems and so doesn't use software programmers. That may
change as a result of the summit, because Russian and U.S. business
people recommended that Russian companies learn directly from major
U.S. firms how to increase productivity by using Internet systems.</TE>
<TE>   A Russian middle-class has been reemerging as the economy has
grown since 2000. Los Angeles- based impresario Larry Namer and his
wife, Nataly Sherbakova, a niece of late Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev, have been sponsoring concerts and sporting events in Moscow
and St. Petersburg for more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we are drawing an audience that can pay $20 a ticket to see
Stars of the NBA ... playing against a Russian team," Namer says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Collaboration and Investment</TE>
<TE>   Still, Russia's economy needs fundamental improvements.</TE>
<TE>   "The growth of small to medium-sized enterprises is strikingly
low," says Harry Broadman, lead World Bank economist for Europe and
Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Russia needs to develop financial and legal infrastructure to
support entrepreneurial business, especially in the regional areas
away from Moscow and St. Petersburg.</TE>
<TE>   And Russia needs help now, says economist Marshall Goldman of
Harvard University. "Inflation is rising in Russia," Goldman notes,
and that could make Russia's small enterprises in food processing and
consumer goods vulnerable to competition from European companies.</TE>
<TE>   Investment and collaboration with U.S. business could give a big
boost to Russia's economy and thus support many of the foreign and
domestic policies of Putin and Bush.</TE>
<TE>   That's why they held a summit this weekend in Moscow and St.
Petersburg and why you can watch for increasing U.S.-Russia economic
cooperation in the years ahead.</TE>

<LD>Apart from the apparent conflict of interest with Cadiz Inc. CEO

Brackpool's previous "greywater" dealings, haven't we learned
anything [Critics Raising Concerns About Cadiz Water Project,"

<LD>   Just take everything written about the privatization of
electricity in California and substitute the word "water." Cadiz
seeks "a foothold in the boom market for water in California."</LD>

<TE>   Plunging a straw into the big gulp of an aquifer that supplies and
spreads widely under mostly public land, including the Mojave
National Preserve, via a well on a small private parcel in its midst
also seems odd. This is not a permanent solution.</TE>
<TE>   It would be wiser to seek a real long-term solution, given our
projected population growth.</TE>
<TE>   California has more than 800 miles of coastline, much of which is
state land. Why not spend the money on developing desalination
plants?</TE>

<HD>Mexican Auto Industry Braces for Competition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Mexican car production is back in full swing, consumers are snapping
up new models as never before and Toyota Motor Co. is about to break
ground on its first Mexican auto factory, a $100-million show of
confidence.</LD>
<LD>   So why is the Mexican car industry nervous?</LD>
<LD>   Declining worker productivity, the strong peso and the failure of
President Vicente Fox to push through tax, energy and labor reforms
certainly are causes for worry. So is a law set to take effect in
2004 that will end an import quota system that has protected the
Mexican retail market.</LD>
<TE>   But the biggest worry is globalization. The world market is
changing at warp speed, forcing car makers to cut manufacturing costs
to the bone to give consumers more for their money.</TE>
<TE>   Can Mexico maintain its status as an export hub amid competition
from other developing countries?</TE>
<TE>   "It will be very challenging. Everyone is using the best available
marketing and technology to try to stay ahead of the changes that
globalization is causing," said Hiroshi Yoshioka, president of Nissan
Motor Co.'s Nissan Mexicana unit, operator of a sprawling auto plant
in this arid city in south-central Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   No one is saying that Mexico will cease being an important auto
manufacturing center. Although showing no growth last year, total
Mexican car production still topped 1.8 million vehicles in 2001, up
50% since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the number of vehicles rolling off U.S. and Canadian
assembly lines remained flat over the same five-year period.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent industry figures indicate that Mexican auto plants
are regaining the ground they lost last year to the recession in the
United States, where three-fourths of all cars and trucks built in
Mexico are sold: April output jumped 12.5% from March.</TE>
<TE>   But because of intensifying competition from other low-cost
manufacturing centers, from Brazil to Thailand, export-directed
production in Mexico could slow from the explosive growth rate of the
last five years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Models Ignite Domestic Market</TE>
<TE>   The biggest driver of the Mexican auto industry over the next
decade may be the domestic market, which seems poised for a period of
dynamic growth, although it represents a much smaller base than
exports to the United States and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's domestic car sales through April were up 11.2% from the
same four months last year and are on a track to top 1 million units
for the year. Igniting the market are new offerings of affordable
compact and subcompact cars--such as Nissan's Platina introduced last
month--that sell for less than $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Mexico is lowering its import barriers to let in
more cars made in Europe and elsewhere in Latin America, including
Peugeots from Chile, GM Corsas and other Nissan models from Europe
and Volkswagens from Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico is expected to sign trade deals with European Union and
Mercosur trading bloc countries that will lower import duties and
make it tougher for local factories to compete on a cost basis for
the right to supply Mexican showrooms with inventory.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican manufacturers also worry about the flood of used U.S. cars
that enter the country illegally, robbing Mexican dealers of sales.
That flood may become a torrent after import rules are liberalized in
2004</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, Mexico has been a prime beneficiary of free
hemispheric trade and the U.S. auto industry's obsessive drive to cut
costs. Billions of dollars have been poured into new auto parts and
vehicle assembly operations by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co.
and DaimlerChrysler.</TE>
<TE>   With Toyota breaking ground in mid-June on a Baja California
factory to make light truck components, all major Japanese auto
manufacturers have or soon will have a manufacturing presence in
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   But despite the excitement caused by Toyota's announcement, there
is uneasiness about whether the Mexican automotive industry can
continue to expand and provide the job growth the nation has come to
count on. The automotive industry is by far the largest private
employer, with 770,000 workers, or about 6% of all formal employees
in Mexico.</TE>

<TE>   Mexico Losing Some of Its Attraction</TE>
<TE>   There are signs that auto parts manufacturers, which accounted for
11% of foreign direct investment in Mexico in the late 1990s, are
less enchanted with Mexico these days, according to a survey by auto
consultant A.T. Kearney in Mexico City that found new parts
investment and sales leveling off.</TE>
<TE>   Several top auto executives warned Fox in March that Mexico was
losing some of its attraction.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is that Mexican productivity has slowed in relation
to other countries and Mexican labor costs are higher than in other
developing countries," said Kearney's Carlos Niezen.</TE>
<TE>   Latin American market analyst Kim Kennedy of J.D. Power &amp;
Associates in Troy, Mich., said the manufacturing landscape is
rapidly changing. Countries such as Brazil, whose currency has been
devalued by 60% since 1999, are more attractive to global auto
makers.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan, which started assembling cars in Aguascalientes in 1992,
has instituted sweeping changes in its sprawling factory since its
1999 alliance with Renault. Many of those changes were sparked by
alliance Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn's mandate that Nissan's
factories worldwide achieve 20% cost reductions over a three-year
period.</TE>
<TE>   The Nissan factory and its 3,100 workers offer a glimpse of what
globalization is doing to the car industry.</TE>
<TE>   Workers fit engines made at Renault's Brazil factory onto the
"platform"--chassis and drive train--used to make both the Renault
Clio and the Nissan Platina subcompacts. Parts now come from the
lowest global bidder and not from wholly or partly owned Nissan
affiliates, another Ghosn mandate. The Nissan models have Renault
styling touches, and Renaults have Nissan engineering.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance of the auto industry's odd couple appears to be
working, and this factory played an important role, doubling its unit
output since 1999, when production of all Nissan Sentras for the U.S.
market was moved here.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance's factories here and in Cuernavaca have played
crucial roles in Nissan's dramatic recovery from near bankruptcy in
1999. Profit for the fiscal year ended March 31 was a record $2.96
billion on sales of $47.7 billion, and the company hit its 20%
cost-reduction goal a year early.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan's unit sales in the U.S. through May 12 were up 23% from
the same period last year, according to A.T. Kearney's John Hoffecker
in Southfield, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Yoshioka was named Nissan's Mexico director, he
named Armando Avila Moreno, 44, the factory's first Mexican manager,
a dramatic break with the Nissan tradition of putting Japanese
managers in charge of plants.</TE>
<TE>   "The rules have changed for the entire industry, all over the
world," said Avila, a 19-year Nissan employee. "Profit margins are
lower. The point is to increase volume and reduce the cost of
inventory, to synchronize production as closely as possible to
delivery to customers."</TE>
<TE>   The cost-reduction mantra is being uttered by all car makers these
days. Globalization means increasing competition at the retail level,
as well as in manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   With countries such as Mexico generally lowering trade barriers
and tariffs, consumers are seeing more brands competing on price. The
competition has been fueled in Mexico by low-cost car financing
offered by several manufacturers and by declining prices, especially
for low-end compacts and subcompacts, which in Mexico account for 92%
of new-car sales.</TE>
<TE>   Lower production costs mean manufacturers can offer more safety
features and more powerful engines for the same money, said Nissan's
Yoshioka. Cost savings also are imperative so the companies can
research new technologies, such as fuel cells.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that other car companies are following our example, they
are doing it from the necessity of the global car market," Yoshioka
said.</TE>

<HD>Tricky Medicaid Rules Can Add to Caregiver's Worries</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I live with my 86-year-old mother, who has been diagnosed
with Alzheimer's disease and is in failing health. I am her main
caregiver, although I also work 40 hours a week. She has bequeathed
the house to me in her will, but the deed is in her name.</LD>
<LD>   I'm worried about what happens when I no longer will be able to
take care of her and she has to go into a nursing facility. She has
no insurance for this. If she goes on government assistance, can they
take her house?</LD>
<LD>   I've been thinking of selling the house now, getting into a
smaller home and paying off her debts before this happens. The upkeep
on the house is tremendous and I don't have the resources to keep up
with it.</LD>
<TE>   Answer: First of all, hats off to you. It can't be easy working
full time and dealing with your mother's declining health and
dementia.</TE>
<TE>   Your role as caregiver, though, has a bright side. You probably
qualify for special rules that will allow you to keep your mother's
home without having to worry about future claims from the government.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, when someone goes on Medicaid, the government medical
program that pays for nursing home care for the indigent, the
government can put a claim on his or her house after death. This
claim is designed to reimburse the government for the costs of the
care that was provided.</TE>
<TE>   Some people try to protect their homes from Medicaid claims by
transferring the property to family members before they apply.
Medicaid has caught on to this, however, and any transfer that's made
within 36 months of applying for Medicaid is deemed invalid. That
doesn't necessarily prevent people from eventually qualifying for
Medicaid, but it does delay eligibility for months, if not years.</TE>
<TE>   One of the exceptions to this invalid transfer rule is when the
person going on Medicaid is unmarried, and he or she transfers the
home to a child of any age who has lived in the house for at least
two years. The child must be the parent's caregiver, with the care
allowing the parent to remain at home rather than enter a nursing
facility.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, you'll need to decide whether you're OK with your
mother going on Medicaid, or whether you would prefer to give her
higher quality care for as long as you can.</TE>
<TE>   If you want, you could sell the house, buy the smaller place and
use the leftover money to pay for help or a private nursing home for
as long as you can.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Medicaid rules can be tricky, and the home transfer
also could have financial and tax repercussions for you, especially
if you sell the house after it's transferred.</TE>
<TE>   You would be smart to consult an attorney with experience in elder
law, and a tax professional as well, before deciding on your next
steps. You also might pick up the book, "Beat the Nursing Home Trap:
A Consumer's Guide to Assisted Living and Long-Term Care," by Joseph
L. Matthews (Nolo Press, 2001).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clarifying Capital Gains, Estate Taxes</TE>
<TE>   Q: I read your recent article about the family with the
84-year-old mother who was considering placing all of her kids' names
on the deed to her house.</TE>
<TE>   My parents added my sister and me to their house deed many years
ago, before our father died, and I am wondering what we are facing
when my mother dies. She is also 84 years old and in a nursing home.</TE>
<TE>   I had assumed we would owe no taxes on the house until after she
dies and the house is sold. Your article seemed to imply we would owe
taxes upon her death regardless of whether the house was sold. Could
you please clarify that point?</TE>
<TE>   A: Your original assumption is probably correct. You personally
won't owe taxes at her death, although her estate might.</TE>
<TE>   There are two tax systems that come into play here: capital gains
taxes and estate taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Estate taxes are assessed when someone dies with more than a
certain amount of assets. The amount of money and property that can
be passed free of estate taxes to heirs is $1 million this year and
is scheduled to rise to $3.5 million by 2009. The estate tax is
supposed to be repealed entirely in 2010, although whether that will
happen is anybody's guess.</TE>
<TE>   You probably don't have to worry much about capital gains taxes,
in any case. If you and your sister didn't purchase a share of the
house, or contribute money in exchange for being put on the deed,
then the house will receive a new, updated value for tax purposes
when your mother dies.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, none of the appreciation that happened while she was
alive will be taxed.</TE>
<TE>   You might owe capital gains taxes if the house appreciates more
between the time your mother dies and the time you sell the house. If
you sell shortly after she dies, of course, this won't be an issue.</TE>
<TE>   The big disadvantage to placing children on a house deed is that
it exposes the parents' home to the children's creditors.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, if one of you is sued or files for bankruptcy,
your creditors could go after the family home. But if your parents
are comfortable taking that risk, then the current arrangement should
work for all of you.</TE>

<HD>With Professional Estate Planning, There's Less Chance of
Splitting Heirs</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Estate taxes are becoming less of a threat to the average American
family, but that doesn't eliminate the need for estate planning,
experts say.</LD>
<LD>   To drive home the point, financial planners cite horror stories,
such as this one about a Beverly Hills woman who died without a will.
Under California law, her three daughters were entitled to share her
estate equally.</LD>
<LD>   A probate judge put them equally in charge of making decisions.
Had they agreed about the disposition of some real estate and
personal assets, they would have walked away as millionaires within
months.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, they bickered for 13 years while their mother's
assets--small business interests and real estate--languished and
their value declined. Millions were spent on legal fees. The family
home burned to rubble.</TE>
<TE>   Federal tax laws were changed last year to gradually raise the
estate tax exclusion until estate taxes are eliminated. In 2002,
Americans can leave as much as $1 million to their heirs tax-free.</TE>
<TE>   But even if tax avoidance no longer is an issue, a good estate
plan is worth doing to save heirs the agony and litigation expense of
battling over an inheritance, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that tax issues are becoming less important puts more of
a magnifying glass on the other side of estate planning, which is
keeping families out of the courtroom when they get their
inheritance," said Jeffrey L. Condon, a Santa Monica attorney and
author of an estate planning book, "Beyond the Grave."</TE>
<TE>   Estate planning is not cheap. Even a relatively simple will could
cost $500 or more. But depending on the circumstances, it may be
worth the cost.</TE>
<TE>   In traditional family situations in which everything is left to
the children and grandchildren, legal contests are rare, said Avram
Salkin, an estate planning attorney with Hochman, Salkin, Rettig,
Toscher &amp; Perez in Beverly Hills. But throw in a second marriage,
unequal bequests to children or long-standing rivalries between
siblings, and battles become common and costly.</TE>
<TE>   "Any of these cases where there is a dispute and witnesses called,
it costs easily $50,000 per party," said Myer J. Sankary, a Sherman
Oaks attorney who mediates probate disputes.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to explain [to heirs] that they're dividing up a pie, but
it's an ice cream pie. The more they fight, the more time it takes,
the more the estate melts away."</TE>
<TE>   How can you ensure your estate plan addresses your wishes and
doesn't cause fights among heirs?</TE>
<TE>   Communicate</TE>
<TE>   Condon encourages parents to have a meeting with their heirs and
their estate attorneys before, or immediately after, the estate plan
is drafted. That gives them the opportunity to explain their
intentions, including who will get what and who will be named
executor.</TE>
<TE>   This serves two important purposes. It gives parents the ability
to explain apparent inequalities, and gives family members a chance
to discuss the plan and possibly sway some of the decisions.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, these meetings establish the competence of the
individuals making the bequests, which makes it much more difficult
for disgruntled heirs to dispute the will later.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Heirs May Not Share</TE>
<TE>   Often, a family member has a problem that makes parents reluctant
to leave that person a lot of cash. Perhaps there's a greedy spouse,
or drug, alcohol or debt problems that make such bequests unwise.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents try to address this by leaving all their assets to
another sibling with the expectation that the siblings will share,
said Les Kotzer, an estate planning attorney who was co-author of
"The Family Fight: Planning to Avoid It."</TE>
<TE>   But the sibling who gets the cash probably will feel entitled to
it and may not be inclined to share.</TE>
<TE>   Kotzer said parents should use trusts, not siblings, to preserve
an inheritance for those who can't safeguard assets themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Inadvertent Inequalities</TE>
<TE>   There are two ways inadvertent inequalities arise: One is when a
parent wants to leave valuable possessions to one child and leave an
equalizing payment to another. Too often, the value of the
possession--a baseball card collection, for example--rises or falls
over the years, while the equalizing payment is set in stone, Kotzer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Those leaving equalizing gifts should update estate documents
every few years or consider stipulating that the personal asset be
appraised at the time of death and that the equalizing payment be
made to match.</TE>
<TE>   The other way inadvertent inequalities arise is when parents
bequeath everything equally but fail to recognize that one child may
have gotten more from the parents than the others over the years. In
those cases, Condon suggests unequal bequests be considered and
explained as a way to equalize what happened while the parents were
alive. Conversely, a child who gave up a career to care for ailing
parents may deserve more than siblings who didn't.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Don't Disinherit</TE>
<TE>   Even when a child is a miserable, rotten ingrate, it may not make
sense to cut him or her completely out of the will, Condon said. It's
wiser to leave that child a token amount and place a no-contest
clause in the will. The no-contest clause says that anyone who
disputes the will gets cut out of it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Consider Tie-Breakers</TE>
<TE>   Parents who want to leave their children equally in charge of the
inheritance and bequest everything equally among them may need to
consider what happens if the kids disagree.</TE>
<TE>   If both daughters want mom's pearls, for example, how should the
dispute be decided? Leah Bishop, attorney with O'Melveny &amp; Myers in
Los Angeles, suggests that parents include a formula for breaking
ties, whether it's allowing the children to bid on disputed items and
pay the value to the estate so no one walks away with a bigger share,
or appointing a third party to review disputes and cast the
tie-breaking vote.</TE>

<HD>Wall St.'s Penalty Phase Yet to Come</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a civilized justice system, the punishment is supposed to fit the
crime.</LD>
<LD>   But on Wall Street, it's often difficult to judge the
appropriateness of punishment meted out by regulatory authorities,
because so little in the way of seemingly harmful corporate practices
ever rises to the level of an actual "crime."</LD>
<LD>   That was demonstrated again last week when Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
settled with state securities regulators the now infamous case of the
brokerage's allegedly tainted stock research.</LD>
<TE>   Merrill apologized to investors, agreed to pay a $100-million
fine, and said it will revamp oversight of its research, to reduce
the chances of analysts' opinions of stocks being swayed by the
firm's investment banking relationships with the subject companies.</TE>
<TE>   But the brokerage didn't admit that it had done anything wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The Merrill settlement is, of course, typical of how such matters
are handled in the financial industry: Pay a fine, agree to change
the way you do business, maybe even say you're sorry--but don't admit
guilt.</TE>
<TE>   New York State Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, who brought the case
against Merrill after a 10-month probe that turned up private analyst
e-mails disparaging stocks the brokerage was urging the public to
buy, initially had vowed to force a guilt admission.</TE>
<TE>   But Merrill evidently wouldn't budge on that point. And Spitzer,
at a news conference Tuesday outlining the settlement, explained the
brokerage's obstinacy: It would be a "death warrant" for Merrill to
admit guilt, the attorney general said.</TE>
<TE>   That's because such an admission could have made it far easier for
plaintiffs' lawyers to successfully sue Merrill for damages,
potentially devastating the firm's capital and pushing it into
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Investors still may take Merrill to arbitration or join
class-action suits, alleging that they lost money following bogus
advice on stocks.</TE>
<TE>   But their chances of winning aren't nearly as high as they might
have been if the brokerage had said, "Guilty, your honor."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his early blustering about a guilt admission, it wasn't in
Spitzer's interest--or the interest of the nation's financial
system--to trigger the demise of one of the world's largest
brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   That may be even more true in the context of Sept. 11, which was a
major blow to Wall Street in every respect.</TE>
<TE>   In the same vein, Merrill rival Credit Suisse First Boston in
January settled Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges that
it rigged initial public stock offerings in the late 1990s. Like
Merrill, CSFB did not admit wrongdoing, even though it agreed to pay
a total of $100 million to end the case.</TE>
<TE>   Two months earlier the U.S attorney's office in New York dropped a
criminal case it had been pursuing against CSFB.</TE>
<TE>   In part, the desire to penalize companies for abusive practices,
without risking destruction of the businesses, is rooted in
regulators' desire to avoid further harm to the firms'
shareholders--who often pay for managements' missteps in the form of
lost stock value.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill's shares, for example, have fallen 20% since Spitzer
announced his case on April 8. That's a drop of $9.2 billion in
shareholder wealth.</TE>
<TE>   Another argument against substantial regulatory penalties or guilt
admissions in these cases is that the marketplace may deal out the
most significant justice: If Merrill's customers don't believe it to
be a trustworthy firm, they can be expected to take their business
elsewhere--or so the argument goes.</TE>
<TE>   But that idea may not hold much water. Virtually every major Wall
Street brokerage is under investigation by state and federal
authorities for the same stock-tout abuses that Merrill is alleged to
have committed.</TE>
<TE>   As a practical matter, then, an angry Merrill investor seeking to
take his or her account elsewhere might find few appealing ports in
this storm.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill, through a spokesman in New York, said Friday that it has
seen "no evidence of an impact [on client accounts] from the
investigation. Client retention this year is consistent with other
years."</TE>
<TE>   It may be early in the process, however. Conceivably, some upset
Merrill customers have been waiting to see how the firm handled a
settlement with Spitzer.</TE>
<TE>   At least one of Merrill's biggest rivals is making a play for
clients who may be on the fence. Charles Schwab Corp., the leading
online brokerage that in recent years has increasingly been adding
services for higher-end investors, has launched an ad campaign that
claims "there's never been a better time" to switch to Schwab.</TE>
<TE>   "Now more than ever, individual investors deserve a level playing
field," the ad begins.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's not clear why individuals deserve a level playing
field more today than, say, a year ago, the ad takes direct aim at
the conflicts of interest that have long dogged major
brokerages--which, unlike Schwab, try to cater both to companies
(with investment banking services) and to individual investors (with
supposedly objective stock research about the other clients, the
companies).</TE>
<TE>   "We're not focused on investment banking. We represent you, the
individual investor," Schwab says.</TE>
<TE>   Will that play well with Merrill customers in Peoria and
elsewhere?</TE>
<TE>   A Schwab spokesman says the company so far can't measure whether
there has been a noticeable shift in accounts. The ad campaign is
just a week old.</TE>
<TE>   "But we know anecdotally from the field that [Schwab
representatives] are having interesting conversations with people,"
the spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   That could mean nothing, of course. Yanking an account from a
broker often isn't easy. Many investors who've been with a particular
firm for any length of time often find that, for better or worse, the
ties are difficult to break.</TE>
<TE>   The logistical issues of moving an account can prove daunting,
depending on the assets involved.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, many investors' view of the brokerage industry
probably is the same as their view of the federal government: "I hate
Congress, but I love my congressman."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some Merrill investors may have good reason to feel
better, rather than worse, about their broker in the wake of the
analyst scandal--if their broker ignored the firm's official research
hype about technology stocks in 2000 and 2001 even as the shares
collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   But don't brokers always toe the official company line on stock
recommendations? Younger brokers may. Veteran brokers, however, often
survive and prosper in the business precisely because they offer
their clients more than just some novice analyst's opinion of a
stock.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a standard joke in the business has long been that no
smart broker followed his in-house analysts' tips. If anything, the
savvy bet was to do the opposite of whatever the research department
was saying.</TE>
<TE>   In the April issue of Registered Rep, a magazine for brokers,
senior editor David A. Gaffen interviewed several brokers on the
question of their analysts' credibility.</TE>
<TE>   For obvious reasons, brokers don't allow their names to be printed
when they're talking openly about their companies.</TE>
<TE>   But a typical comment, Gaffen wrote, was from a Morgan Stanley
broker who said about his firm's analysts: "I know where my bread is
buttered, and it's not here. They proved they were just watching
their butts" on stock picks.</TE>
<TE>   It may yet prove to be that the marketplace, rather than
securities regulators, will exact the greatest punishment and force
the most significant change in the brokerage business.</TE>
<TE>   Individual investors now will be more skeptical than ever about
Wall Street stock touts. Likewise brokers and other financial
advisors, if they hope to retain any credibility with the clients who
pay their salaries.</TE>
<TE>   If a brokerage can't provide objective advice, what, exactly, does
it have to offer?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Merrill Lynch Fined Over Stock Advice</LD>
<LD>   Brokerage giant Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. agreed to pay $100 million in
fines to settle charges of tainted advice by its stock analysts and
said it would adopt reforms aimed at restoring the credibility of
Wall Street's investment guidance.</LD>
<LD>   The deal with New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, reached after
weeks of negotiations, should be a template for industrywide change,
Spitzer said.</LD>
<TE>   But the agreement doesn't require Merrill to admit wrongdoing and
provides no restitution for investors who believe they lost money
when they followed allegedly misleading stock advice. Investors will
have to sue Merrill on their own, Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts said the Merrill case is a landmark in exposing for
average investors the inherent conflicts of interest at major
brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   Critics long have contended that research analysts face pressure
to skew opinions of stocks to better the chances that the subject
companies would grant fee-rich investment banking work to their
brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rigas Family Gives Up Adelphia Control</TE>
<TE>   The Rigas family buckled to mounting pressure from bankers,
investors and outside directors and agreed to relinquish control of
Adelphia Communications Corp. and contribute $1 billion worth of
assets to cover mounting liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   The move improves the cable company's chances--at least
slightly--of averting a bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Founder John Rigas, who resigned as chairman, chief executive and
president earlier this month, stepped down from the nine-member
Adelphia board.</TE>
<TE>   His three sons, Michael, James and Timothy, also resigned as
directors. Michael and James Rigas gave up top management roles,
after the resignation the previous week of Timothy Rigas as chief
financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Short Seller,' FBI Agents Charged with Fraud</TE>
<TE>   Federal agents broke up an alleged securities scheme that included
two FBI agents.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities indicted Internet-based stock trader Amr I. Elgindy,
known as an outspoken "short seller," and four others, charging them
with a fraud that involved driving share prices lower.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy, 34, who operates from Encinitas, was ordered held without
bail. The alleged fraud involved using confidential government
information to target companies for "short selling."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Drexler to Step Down as Gap Chief Executive</TE>
<TE>   Millard "Mickey" Drexler, the legendary merchant who built Gap
Inc. from a single shop into the nation's largest chain of specialty
clothing stores, said he is stepping down as chief executive of the
struggling company.</TE>
<TE>   Drexler, 57, was hired by the Fisher family to run Gap in 1983,
helping to build the company into an empire of more than 4,200 stores
operating as Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Once an icon of the casual crowd, Gap had been struggling after
what analysts say was too much expansion and an attempt to woo a
younger, trendier shopper. More than two years of declining sales
have led to the stock losing more than half its value.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Electricity Firms Deny Enron-Style Strategies</TE>
<TE>   Some of California's biggest electricity players denied to federal
regulators that they committed Enron-style manipulation of
California's electricity market. A few admitted that they engaged in
some types of trading that critics contend may have worsened the
state's energy woes, but only in small amounts and for reasons other
than manipulation, the companies said in sworn filings with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</TE>
<TE>   All of the companies defended their behavior as legal and within
the rules of the state's electricity markets run by the California
Power Exchange and the California Independent System Operator.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, FERC widened its investigation of questionable trading
strategies to include sellers of natural gas in California and other
Western states. The investigation of "wash" trading--prearranged
deals in which a company sells a given volume of a commodity to
another firm and them buys it back at the same price--had been
focused on electricity marketers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup to Buy Golden State Bancorp</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup Inc. agreed to buy the parent of San Francisco-based
savings and loan California Federal Bank for $5.8 billion, giving it
1.5 million new customers and ownership of a major California
branch-banking network.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup's $40.10-a-share cash and stock deal to acquire Cal Fed
parent Golden State Bancorp Inc. would give it 352 additional
branches, mostly in California, and $54 billion in assets.</TE>
<TE>   The deal would almost double the number of New York-based
Citigroup's U.S. branches and combine the nation's largest financial
institution with the nation's third-largest thrift.</TE>
<TE>   If the deal closes, Citigroup's deposit market share in California
will jump from 1.6%--10th in the state among banks and thrifts--to
about 6%.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross Backs Off 'Tiered Hospital' Plan</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross of California has backed off selling "tiered hospital"
policies, which group hospitals by cost and increase co-payments for
consumers who use costlier facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Senior executives at Blue Cross, the state's largest health
insurer, said the company changed course after encountering vigorous
opposition from hospitals. Blue Cross has had a contentious
relationship with hospitals and recently the insurance company has
tried to take a more conciliatory approach.</TE>
<TE>   Tiered hospital plans have come under fire since PacifiCare Health
Systems Inc. and Blue Shield of California introduced them this year
as a way to reduce premiums and contend with escalating costs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Music Industry to Call for Radio Payola Probe</TE>
<TE>   Several members of Congress called for the federal government to
investigate whether Clear Channel Communications Inc. and other radio
broadcast giants are violating payola laws.</TE>
<TE>   Their comments followed a report in The Times that said a
coalition of record companies and artist unions was preparing to ask
the Federal Communications Commission to investigate questionable
promotion practices in the music industry in which middlemen pay
radio stations for the exclusive right to pitch songs on behalf of
record labels.</TE>
<TE>   The music industry says a few promoters attempt to sidestep
federal anti-payola laws by paying broadcasters annual fees they say
are not tied to airplay of specific songs and then charging record
labels when a song is added to a radio station's playlist.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Albertson's to Add, Remodel Stores</TE>
<TE>   Supermarket giant Albertson's Inc. plans to spend $1 billion in
the next three years to remodel and add expanded food and drug stores
in Southern California to better compete with rivals Ralphs and Vons.</TE>
<TE>   Boise, Idaho-based Albertson's has been struggling to gain a
bigger share in this highly competitive market after acquiring the
Lucky chain when it bought American Stores Co.</TE>
<TE>   Although Ralphs and Vons have added pharmacies to many of their
supermarkets over the last several years, many of the new Albertson's
stores will put a full supermarket and drugstore under one roof.</TE>

<TE>   Army's New Message: Uncle 'Sim' Wants You</TE>
<TE>   Eager to prove it's not your grandfather's military, the Army is
developing video games to recruit and build awareness among
Generation Y.</TE>
<TE>   At the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, the Army
unveiled two games designed to appeal to a media-saturated,
tech-bombarded generation.</TE>
<TE>   One is a sanitized version of "Unreal Tournament," a classic
first-person shooting game known for its graphic, nonstop killing.
The other is a take on "The Sims," a popular game that mimics life.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of dismembering mutants or pursuing romance, players
can work on their organizational skills, free hostages and rise to
the rank of first sergeant.</TE>
<TE>   The games are part of the Army of One marketing campaign, which
stresses professionalism and the importance of the individual--themes
marketers say resonate with youths.</TE>
<TE>   The Army joined other video game producers in showcasing the
latest technology at the annual trade show.</TE>

<HD>Church Scandal Turns Attention to Gay Priests</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Gay Priests Say It's Harder Now to Tell the Truth," May 22: The
term "gay priest" is an oxymoron. Having taken the vow of celibacy,
the sexual orientation of an individual in this vocation is
irrelevant. Followers of Christ are expected to lead chaste lives in
whatever state of life they choose.</LD>
<LD>   The statement that men sometimes enter the priesthood to avoid
explaining their single life is nonsense. "Cradle Catholics" were
taught that there were three vocations to choose: the religious,
married and "single blessedness in the world." Should the vow of
celibacy become optional, engaging in homosexuality would still be
immoral.</LD>
<LD>   The confusion has been caused in our culture by the insistence of
the entertainment and advertising industries on portraying sexual
activity as a recreational pastime that everyone has a "right" and
"need" to engage in. As Christians we do not, and we should not, buy
into this destructive thinking.</LD>
<TE>   Florence E. James</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Conservative Catholics who propose as a solution to the church's
pedophilia crisis the outright dismissal of all priests with a
homosexual orientation are actually playing with a loaded gun pointed
at the church. Were such a policy to go into effect and were there a
wholesale exodus of such priests, there would be widespread
discontent among Catholics: "Father so-and-so was forced to leave the
priesthood; he was such a great priest."</TE>
<TE>   Then these Catholics would themselves be motivated to express
their disgust at this policy by leaving the church en masse, and
Roman Catholicism in America would continue its slow withering away
to irrelevancy.</TE>

<HD>Time to Declare Valley Independence</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that Valley secession is on the ballot (May 23), let's make Nov.
5 Independence Day for the Valley--independence from the colonial
rule of the Basin. For almost a century we Valleyites paid our taxes
to the Lords of the Basin, who built the edifices of the empire in
the Basin, leaving us with the shaft. Let's remember that the
colonialists of past centuries came as traders and finally took over
and subjugated the natives. Don't we see a parallel here? Let's
redeem ourselves Nov. 5.</LD>
<LD>   As for alimony to the empire, let's say the lords pay us
reparations for decades of poor service and misappropriation of our
taxes. Also, the city of San Fernando Valley should have an equitable
stake in all the independent departments of Los Angeles, like the
DWP, the Harbor Department and LAX. These departments were nurtured
partly with Valley money.</LD>

<TE>   Re Steve Lopez's May 22 column: How about asking an opinion of a
true representative of the Valley? I'm a 26-year-old male Hispanic
property owner who works hard for his money. Now ask me, how are
L.A.'s services? They're atrocious. Try calling the police sometime,
and see if you get a busy signal. Try timing them, and see how long
it takes for them to arrive to help you; you're lucky if they ever
do.</TE>
<TE>   Does my trash get picked up? Do I have running water? Is this
really how to measure a city's service? I think not. Measure a city
by its property values, crime and economy. Try walking the streets of
Panorama City, then tell me we're getting our fair share of services.
We can only go in a positive direction if we secede from L.A.</TE>

<HD>Juror Finds Court Negligent in Shooting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "County Not Liable for Death at Courthouse," May 21: I was in the
very crowded jury assembly room at the civil courthouse on Sept. 1,
1995, when the shots that killed Eileen Zelig rang out and screaming
women ran into the room. Not knowing whether the shooter was among
them, and with no instruction about what to do in the ensuing
commotion, jurors relied on finely honed urban instincts and hit the
rug.</LD>
<LD>   What I witnessed were clerks disappearing into their workstation
while the rest of us, there to fulfill our jury obligation, waited
and wondered in fear. (Ironically, the O.J. Simpson trial blared from
the television as the room quieted instantly.) I'm glad to hear that
metal detectors are now in place; however, the California Supreme
Court is gravely in error: On Sept. 1, 1995, there was a defect in
the courthouse--a deadly lack of regard for county employees and the
public, one now compounded by this ruling.</LD>

<LD>Re "Nation's Energy Needs Collide With a Way of Life," May 19: To
increase energy supplies, the Bush administration wants to destroy
the land and pump aquifers dry to produce natural gas in Wyoming and
corn-fed gasohol in the Midwest. Like Congress, the media once worked
for the country's good, but hush money killed that.</LD>
<LD>   Clean water may disappear before the world's oil, which will be
gone in about 50 years. I do not want to leave the planet in this
mess for my granddaughter. Unfortunately, I do not have a big voice,
and the media, which could do honest investigative reporting in the
interest of future generations, no longer talk. Funny what money
can't do.</LD>

<TE>   Each week I read a new article regarding the Bush administration's
blatant assault on the environment--all in the name of providing
energy for the American people. Recently the Bush administration was
slapped by a judge for pushing for cheaper coal-producing practices
that were ruining the waterways of West Virginia (which the people of
that state have been fighting). Now it is supporting the rape of
parts of Montana and Wyoming for natural-gas extraction.</TE>
<TE>   While I know we need natural gas, it is possible to obtain it in a
more environmentally sensitive way. Some of these ranchers have made
money from the extraction while others have had their water supply
and land ruined. The people who have suffered under heavy-handed
natural-gas extraction are spending thousands of dollars fighting the
government to protect their land. What happened to the government
being for the people, not against? Where is the governor of Wyoming
when his people need him? How long can the ground sustain that kind
of water loss?</TE>
<TE>   These ranchers in Wyoming are probably the ones who voted for
President Bush because he was viewed as a good ol' boy. What they did
not realize was that they are not a part of this club. Only the
wealthy energy people who paid to put Bush and Vice President Cheney
in the White House are part of that club. I can't wait for the
General Accounting Office investigation of Energy Secretary Spencer
Abraham's energy-plan meetings (along with Cheney) and the Enron
investigation to be completed, to see who has been sleeping with
Kenneth Lay.</TE>

<LD>State Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Garden Grove) is getting very close to the
real villains in the past power crisis ("State Inflated Power Needs,
Lawmaker Says," May 22). Dunn did not mention the critical role of
Terry Winter, chief executive of the California Independent System
Operator. On Dec. 8, 2000, Winter petitioned federal regulators to
lift a price cap as a way to encourage more sellers to offer
electricity to California.</LD>
<LD>   On Nov. 6, 2001, Gov. Gray Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio,
described Winter's action as "throwing gasoline on fire," saying it
led to the higher power prices that pushed the state's utilities
toward bankruptcy ("Electricity Grid Chief Defends His Secretive
Action," Nov. 7). Cal-ISO is a California state agency. It is the
responsibility of the governor.</LD>

<LD>When you read about the L.A. County plan to lay off 5,000 health
workers, you can't help but wonder what is left of the argument to
continue engaging illegal immigrants in this country because of the
so-called shortage of workers (May 18). It's a crime to have to lose
jobs and money because of this relaxed attitude toward illegal
immigration.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services would not
have to face a state and federal cutback if illegal immigration were
restricted. This would allow more money in the federal budget for the
Americans who have a legitimate right to be here.</LD>

<LD>Re "Davis Budget Proposal Sets Stage for Fight Over Taxes," May 19:
With all of the "temporary" tax increases that Gov. Gray Davis and
his socialist ilk want to unfairly lay on smokers, drivers and the
poor, the motto of the Democratic Party should be changed to: "There
ain't no end to doin' good when yer spendin' somebody else's money."</LD>
<LD>   Michael A. Pacer</LD>
<LD>   Glendora</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In response to your readers who cry foul regarding "punishing"
smokers with taxes, it should be pointed out that it is the rest of
us who pick up the tab for smoking-related illnesses ("Paying More
Taxes for Little in Return," letters, May 17). As a former smoker who
cost my insurance company a great deal of money, I am ashamed to
admit I didn't think of this while "legally" smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance rates go up. Medicare and other federal and state
programs spend a fortune on smokers. Ask any hospital administrator
how many patients at any given time are hospitalized for
smoking-related illnesses--the numbers are huge.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy S. Burgess</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Re "Tax Gas Guzzlers to Balance the Budget," letters, May 21: I
thought that I could never vote for a Democrat, much less Davis. But
the governor's courageous decision to raise automobile registration
fees changed my mind. I would like to encourage Davis to increase
these fees and gas taxes much higher. A $1,000 annual fee for a
typical SUV or pickup would just be a start.</TE>
<TE>   My reason: The freeways would be cleared of working stiffs, young
people, retirees on fixed incomes and families struggling to make
ends meet, leaving plenty of room for successful Republicans like me.</TE>
<TE>   William John Mikus</TE>

<TE>   If Davis considers his strong-arm fund-raising, his Oracle
contract fiasco, his bungling of energy contracts, his $23-billion
state deficit, his flip-flop on taxes and countless other debacles as
"political experience" then, yes, Bill Simon is a rank amateur.</TE>

exasperated, scolding uncle whenever Americans express anger, doubt,
frustration and concern about the political antics of his boss,
President Bush. The effect is a smoke screen.</LD>

<LD>CANNES, France--It was going to be a tough call. In a post-Sept. 11
world, how was this year's Cannes Film Festival--with a reduced
Hollywood studio presence and more serious art-house fare--going to
top last year's colorful fanfare and fantasy of "The Lord of the
Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" and "Moulin Rouge," spiced by the
frisson of Nicole Kidman's divorce?</LD>
<LD>   Woody Allen's opening film, "Hollywood Ending," certainly wasn't
going to do the job--nor nor was the director. Despite his social
coming-out at the Oscars, described by the affable New Yorker (here
the antithesis of his acerbic screen persona), "as a gesture of
reciprocity, not a religious conversion," it's evident the adjustment
was only partial. Just before his Palais red-carpet ascent, Allen
confessed a "desperate attempt to suppress panic."</LD>
<LD>   Dressed in a rented tux, accompanied by his wife, Soon-Yi Previn,
and his trio of starlets, Allen survived the ordeal amid cries of
adulation from French fans outside. A more daunting challenge
awaited: the post-screening, opening-night party for 650 VIP guests,
including French cultural minister Jacques Aillagon.</LD>
<TE>   The festival, despite a toned-down atmosphere, had the usual round
of parties and parade of fashion.</TE>
<TE>   On the first day, Cannes favorite and jury member Sharon Stone,
returning to film after a two-year sabbatical (during which she had a
baby and recovered from illness) declared her comeback was as a
"film-student, delighted to be part of a team exploring film in a
profound way, content to play a supporting role."</TE>
<TE>   She didn't mention her serious commitment to fashion. In the
absence of other major A-list contenders, relishing the captive
audience and her return to the spotlight, Stone--possibly as a
reaction to being cooped up with so many directors--has treated the
Palais red carpet as her private catwalk.</TE>
<TE>   By night in Versace and Valentino, by day or on fun, offbeat
evenings in Fendi (which opened its first Riviera store on the
Croissette during the festival), Stone has run the gamut of fabrics,
colors and styles from high glamour to offbeat hip.</TE>
<TE>   In austere black or sensual leopard prints for the screenings on
the first two nights, she was barefoot (quite a turn for the stuffy
ritual here), in white trousers and matching furs for the early
evening world premiere of Rosanna Arquette's documentary, "Searching
for Debra Winger."</TE>
<TE>   She almost managed to upstage the week's most anticipated event,
the 20-minute preview of "Gangs of New York," when the late arrival
of director Martin Scorsese, Miramax honcho Harvey Weinstein and
stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz (in a knockout black lace)
provided an opportunity for a gyrating parade in clinging pale blue
Herve Leger.</TE>
<TE>   In a year when somber political films have dominated the
competition, Stone and fellow celebrities have set the general trend
of mostly sleek, simple elegance.</TE>
<TE>   Juliette Binoche popped in briefly to promote her new romantic
comedy "Jet Lag," voraciously eating chocolates (a legacy of her
previous film "Chocolat"?) and pastries, a rare sight in the
body-obsessed star climate. Dressed in her favorite simple black
Alessandro Dell'Acqua dress by day, resplendent in Dior for the
"Gangs of New York" evening preview, she switched to
champagne-colored beaded Ungaro for one of the other premieres.</TE>
<TE>   Amid this year's understated elegance, by far the most spectacular
party was MTV/MGM/UA 40th birthday celebration for James Bond, set in
the futuristic bubble villa of octogenarian Pierre Cardin. It was
attended by current 007 Pierce Brosnan, and hip crowd of 1,200
revelers.</TE>
<TE>   Bond's Astin Martin Vanquish, Jaguar XKR and Range Rover were
flown here especially for the party from the upcoming 20th Bond film
"Die Another Day," currently in production at London's Pinewood
Studios. The cars were displayed under the vigilant eye of a security
team.</TE>
<TE>   Forty TV screens, built into the sloping bubble landscape, played
key scenes from the superspy films, launched by Sean Connery in 1962.</TE>
<TE>   No special effects were spared for the extravaganza.</TE>
<TE>   Special shuttles transported guests half an hour away to Cardin's
villa, named Palais Bulles in Theole-Sur-Mer. Green lasers and gusts
of artificial snow greeted the guests on arrival.</TE>
<TE>   In the gastronomic paradise that is the Riviera, organizers wanted
to provide a fresh touch flying in teams of British and Australian
chefs from London to provide a spectacular menu of oyster bloody mary
shots, an array of fresh seafood and barbecued delicacies, canapes
and a 3 a.m. breakfast of croissants, sausages and an assortment of
gateaux. After breakfast, guests had the opportunity to gamble at
roulette, blackjack and other games.</TE>
<TE>   On the same night, half an hour on the other side of Cannes, at
the stylist Hotel Du Cap-Eden Rock, the Vanity Fair folk partied to a
more moderate tempo. Farrah Fawcett, Rosanna Arquette, Sting and wife
Trudie Styler and Mick Jagger joined other A-list revelers.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood power elite turned out a couple of nights later to
support legendary producer Robert Evans, the subject of the
bio-documentary, "The Kid Stays in the Picture," who basked in the
limelight of his party event at Martinez Beach restaurant. The "kid"
nearly didn't make it (he reportedly didn't feel well) but at the
last minute hopped on Jack Nicholson's private jet to make it in time
for the screening and celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly one of the most elegant cocktail parties was the
launch of a new player on the film festival's circuit, the Spirit of
Fire, which will be held in Siberia next January.</TE>
<TE>   Held at atop the magnificently located Sofitel hotel with
360-degree views of the Old Harbor and coastline, the party attracted
a smartly dressed crowd, reiterating the message imbued in many of
this year's films. Despite geographic and cultural differences, it's
a small world after all.</TE>

<DH>When an author goes on a book tour, a media escort is
firmly at the wheel</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIMI AVINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Novelists, political activists, celebrity tattletales, diet doctors,
romantic gurus and tenured geniuses have all nestled into the brown
velour seats of Diana Faust's 1993 Acura Legend. They have whined
about how hard it is to get the public to pay attention, to give a
darn, to buy the book they have labored over for so long.</LD>
<LD>   Faust understands. She is a media escort, the unsung hero of the
book publicity tour, still the best grass-roots strategy the
publishing industry has devised to stimulate sales.</LD>
<LD>   Some 45,000 new books hit the American market annually. To rise
above the clutter, an author has to get out and meet the people, to
lurch from bookstore signing in Pasadena to speaking engagement
downtown, from radio interview in Santa Monica to Hollywood cocktail
party. From five to 20 itinerant scribes crisscross Los Angeles
almost every week. Behind each one is a media escort, an efficient,
unflappable professional who is adept at navigating, hand-holding,
ego stroking and mind reading.</LD>
<TE>   What do these handlers get for their trouble? From $225 to $250
per eight-hour day, plus expenses, and $35 an hour for overtime. And
they collect anecdotes to dine out on till they die. "When I think of
the lights of 20th century literature who have sat in my Honda
Accord," says Kathi Kamen Goldmark, for 16 years considered the most
popular escort in San Francisco. "Norman Mailer, Amy Tan, E.L.
Doctorow, Maya Angelou."</TE>
<TE>   Waiting to meet an author at John Wayne Airport in Orange County
on a Thursday morning in May, Faust makes the best of a little down
time. She checks her messages, returns calls to public relations
directors at publishing houses--the people who hire her--and consults
a Thomas Guide to plan the route to a series of nearby bookstores to
be visited before noon.</TE>
<TE>   It is just before 9, and the 38-year-old former Random House
publicist has been working for more than five hours. The insistent
beeps of two alarm clocks in her Silver Lake home roused her at 3:30.
The streets were empty as she drove through the dawn to Beverly Hills
to pick up Ilyasah Shabazz, whose memoir, "Growing Up X" (One World
Books) describes her life as the daughter of Malcolm X. Faust
accompanied Shabazz to a 4:30 a.m. live radio show, brought her back
to the hotel two hours later, then headed for the airport. She would
have finished a muffin for breakfast if the plane carrying her next
client, Terrence Cheng, a first-time novelist, hadn't landed 10
minutes early.</TE>
<TE>   A 30-year-old New Yorker whose "Sons of Heaven" (William Morrow)
is a fictionalized account of the events surrounding the Tiananmen
Square massacre, Cheng rants about being subjected to repeated
security searches at every airport on his 10-city tour.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, you were singled out because you have one-way tickets," Faust
tells him, in a voice that combines sweetness and sincerity.</TE>
<TE>   In the initial 10 minutes of a relationship that will last three
days and cover 11 bookstores and 373 miles, one of the key rules of
escort-author communication is in play: Writers complain, the escort
explains, making sense of what seems to be an irrational and hostile
world. The words vary, but the messages the escort delivers are,
essentially, "Poor baby"; "You were great"; "Everything's going
smoothly"; "I'm on your side."</TE>
<TE>   At first, Cheng didn't see why he couldn't take cabs wherever he
needed to go. But one thrill-packed day in San Francisco taught him
what veterans of book tours know. "Having an escort worry about where
I needed to be next and how to get there de-stressed me," he says. "I
could concentrate on promoting my book."</TE>
<TE>   The Toyotas, Hondas, Buicks, Mercurys and Volvos of more than 200
escorts throughout the country become mobile offices for traveling
authors. Escorts provide the Advil a writer forgot to pack, offer a
Handi-Wipe to clean a stained shirt. Esther Levine, Atlanta's
reigning escort, circled the block while Texas humorist Molly Ivins
shopped for cosmetics and something to wear to a television
appearance when she'd flown in sweatpants and her suitcase didn't
arrive.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be a little like being a baby-sitter for grown-ups,"
Goldmark says. "It would be the perfect job for anyone with
codependency issues." Faust compares her role to that of an attentive
mother. "I'm constantly saying to adults, 'You're going to be in the
car for a while. Do you need to go to the bathroom before we go? Are
you hungry? Are you thirsty?' It's absurd, but the day is about
anticipating and meeting their needs."</TE>
<TE>   A resourceful escort can get an author into a gym on short notice,
hunt down a coat button to match one that's gone missing or have a
broken heel repaired in the time it takes to autograph a stack of
books. It's the foolish author who confuses escorts with chauffeurs
and climbs in the back seat. Chances are their "driver" knows more
about promoting a book in their territory than the visitor. For
example, Goldmark's husband is a professional card player. "I knew
when the No. 1 radio host's poker night was," she says, "so I could
warn my authors that he might be in a bad mood the morning after he'd
lost."</TE>
<TE>   Ken Wilson, arguably the dean of L.A.'s escort corps, has been on
the road for 20 years and handles about 200 authors a year. "On the
way to a TV or radio taping, I'll tell my client who the host is,
whether there will be calls from listeners, how long they'll be on
the air," he says. "I'll let them know there's one interviewer who
doesn't ask actual questions, so they'll know when he pauses it's the
writer's turn to say something."</TE>
<TE>   Every experienced escort has horror stories about midnight phone
calls from hotel rooms that "just won't do," or the reclusive writer
whose social skills have disappeared because he's spent too much time
in the company of his computer. "Just because someone is famous
doesn't mean he won't pass gas in your car," says Deborah
Morrison-Littell, Faust's partner at D2 Media Services.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't fun being trapped in a car with an author who's
conducting a cell phone fight with a soon-to-be ex-spouse. The
memoirs of a manic-depressive might make compelling reading, but
spending the day with one can be challenging.</TE>
<TE>   Who would think that the former network news anchor who has become
a national father figure would be cranky and cold? Or that the
kittenish chanteuse whose slurred words distinguished her singing
style would show up at a book signing too drunk to stand? An escort,
male or female, who can't gracefully deflect an amorous overture
might as well hang up the car keys.</TE>
<TE>   Abuse can't be taken any more personally than lechery. Media
escorts maintain an informal network, and if an author has
misbehaved, his next caretaker will often get a call from the
previous city. At BookExpo America, the annual convention of
booksellers and publishing executives, escorts from around the
country throw themselves a party. Ten years ago, Goldmark arrived
carrying a dartboard covered with authors' pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "The Golden Dartboard award was born, and every year, the most
obnoxious person who toured would win," recalls Emily Laisy, a
Maryland-based escort who publishes a newsletter for her colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Archer, Martha Stewart, Faye Dunaway, Betty Friedan,
Shirley MacLaine and the late Lewis Grizzard were recipients, but the
Golden Dartboard was meant to be an inside joke. It was disbanded
when the press began reporting on it and publishers expressed their
displeasure.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety-five percent of the people you drive are fantastic," says
L.A-based Karen Hebert. "But everyone has survived a terror. After
five hours of being screamed at by Faye Dunaway, I was in tears."</TE>
<TE>   Even among escorts, who have a charming flight attendant's
facility to talk to anyone about anything, Levine of Atlanta has a
reputation for taming beastly charges. Gail Sheehy has been known to
have a condescending manner. Levine took her shopping for kilim rugs
and pine furniture between appearances, and a good time was had by
all.</TE>
<TE>   Most escorts who run their own businesses have a stable of
part-time workers who, for $15 an hour, can fill in when the boss
isn't available. Except in New York and L.A., one or two companies
dominate a city's market. Here, half a dozen respectful and often
cooperative competitors stay busy.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a stand-up comedian we call on, a caterer, a retired
parole officer who worked with white-collar criminals," Faust says.
"The crime writers love to pick her brain. You never want the author
to worry about anything, so it's important to act like everything's
OK. I'm glad we have some actresses who drive for us."</TE>
<TE>   Literary wannabes who think becoming friends with successful
writers is an inevitable job perk make lousy escorts. Motor mouths
and mentor seekers need not apply. "They don't get it," L.A.'s Wilson
says. "In this business, you're responsive and professional."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Young's story is an exception. His company, Midwest Media,
handles 800 author tours a year in the Chicago area. A divorced
51-year-old high school dropout with an abiding love of books, he met
novelist Elizabeth Berg on a tour. They have lived together for six
years.</TE>
<TE>   "You fall a little bit in love with a lot of people you meet in
this job, but I never looked at it as a great way to get dates," he
says. "If you do like somebody, they're gone the next day. And if you
have someone in your life, they have to put up with the ridiculous
hours you keep."</TE>
<TE>   Rotten hours, too much coffee and awful food. Faust's lunch
consists of greasy chicken and chips at the UC Irvine Cross-Cultural
Center. It's only 12:30 p.m., but she almost falls asleep during
Cheng's talk. She manages to stay conscious, so on the way to her car
when he asks, "Was I rambling too much?" she can honestly say, "No.
You were very focused."</TE>
<TE>   The carpool lane on the 5 Freeway lives up to its promise and
Faust drops Cheng at his Century City hotel at 3 p.m. She steals an
hour and a half nap at home before picking up Elizabeth Drew, New
Yorker magazine's Washington correspondent, in Beverly Hills and
driving her to the downtown library in time for an early-evening
speaking engagement.</TE>
<TE>   "Citizen McCain" (Simon and Schuster) is Drew's 12th book on
politics. In her elegant touring suit, she couldn't be more
temperamentally and stylistically different from Cheng, who promised
his publisher he wouldn't wear jeans, smoke in public or swear on the
road.</TE>
<TE>   It's unusual for an escort to drive two authors in one day, much
less three, but Faust likes the fact that she wouldn't know how to
describe a typical day. This long one ends around 10 p.m., when she
is much too tired to eat dinner or to pick up one of the signed first
editions that are the tangible spoils of a literary road warrior.</TE>

<TE>   Yoko packs her lunch. She puts steamed rice on a bamboo mat and
then goes on the school bus and gives her mom a hug. After the lunch
bell, the children eat. Everybody laughs at Yoko's lunch because
there is seaweed in it. "Don't tell me that's raw fish," says one of
the Franks brothers. I like this book because it makes me feel
worried for Yoko and then proud of her.</TE>

<LD>I imagine young Brian Njau is having second thoughts now about his
supposed plan to hold up a teacher for her SUV so he could drive to
the prom last weekend. The Pennsylvania youth has had plenty of time
to think about it since, sitting behind bars at Berks County Prison
after being booked on charges of robbery and aggravated assault.</LD>
<LD>   Njau had planned to ride to the prom with friends, but they backed
out when they couldn't get dates, he told a wire service reporter. He
hoped to use his mother's car, but she couldn't take the night off
from work. So he wound up without wheels and the prom just hours
away, and his date warning him on the phone not to be late.</LD>
<LD>   As a mother in the midst of prom preparations, I understand it
must have seemed to Njau like a crisis calling for desperate
measures. But the plan police say he settled on involved a series of
bad moves: He spotted Stacey Stoudt getting into her 2001 Suzuki
Grand Vitara at a nearby elementary school, allegedly pulled an
unloaded BB gun from his sleeve and ordered the teacher to hand him
the keys.</LD>
<TE>   Police found the vehicle the next morning, in the parking lot of a
hotel where Njau and his date had gathered with friends post-prom.
Inside the car, police say, were his rented tux vest, his date's
dress shoes and a camera with film of Njau at the prom.</TE>
<TE>   Njau is an honors student who before this had never been in
serious trouble. But then, prom fever can infect even the most mature
of teenagers. And when desperation triumphs over good sense, not even
prom night can promise a Cinderella ending.</TE>
<TE>   It's supposed to be the most perfect night of a high schooler's
life, filled with magic, promise and romance. But our kids' rising
expectations and the pressure on them to keep up with one another are
conspiring to make the prom just one more source of stress.</TE>
<TE>   The buzz these days when prom rolls around is not so much about
dance themes and dates, but dresses and limos and after-parties ...
and the toll on a bankroll that the big night takes.</TE>
<TE>   "In our day, you didn't go to the prom if you didn't have a date,"
recalls Venice High teacher Nancy Zubiri. "Today, that's not so much
of an issue; kids go in groups or with friends. Today, cost is more
of a factor. Prom's still the event of the year. But a lot of kids
don't go because they can't afford it."</TE>
<TE>   And they can't afford it because it's not enough anymore to rent a
tux or buy a dress and borrow the old man's car for the night. The
prom can easily set a student back $400 or $500, what with tickets at
about $140 a couple and a rented tux or formal dress costing upward
of $100. Add in flowers, shoes, professional hairstyle and makeup, a
luxury rental car or limousine, and that one night costs as much as
my honeymoon did 25 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We have kids who start planning a year ahead, who get jobs and
start saving their money so they have enough to get the dress, the
shoes, the limo," said Minnie Mahone, activities director at Hamilton
High in Los Angeles. Zubiri said her students "practically died" when
she told them that at her prom "the kids who had a car to drive were
lucky.... A lot of times our parents had to drive us." And when she
asked how many would be going to the prom in limos, every hand in the
class shot up.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really surprised by that," she said. "I thought limos were
an extravagant thing that only a few kids did. This is not a wealthy
school ... but every kid finds a way to ride in a limo."</TE>
<TE>   Even when schools try to provide alternatives, many students still
opt for chauffeur-driven glamour.</TE>
<TE>   San Marino High tried to charter a bus last year to ferry kids
across town to their prom at the Long Beach Aquarium but got no
takers.</TE>
<TE>   In West Hills, Chaminade Catholic school has solved the problem by
requiring students to ride school-sponsored buses to the prom from
their San Fernando Valley campus.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some griping and complaining four years ago when we
first started," said Debbie Berko, the school's activities director.
"Some kids threatened not to go if they had to ride a bus to the
prom."</TE>
<TE>   Now, students may have gotten used to the practice, but they
haven't lost their obsession for limos. "We've got two other dances
at school during the year, and the kids always show up in
limousines," said Berko. "They get a limo for the 10-minute ride to
campus."</TE>
<TE>   I guess the thirst for luxury is a powerful motivator. But
sometimes good sense has to trump the urge to live large. Prom's only
one night, after all. Better to match your mode to your means.</TE>
<TE>   The magic fades quickly when you're in debt--or behind bars.</TE>

<LD>Not looking the least bit out of place, emcee Roseanne floated on
stage in a checked taffeta dress and rhinestone-trimmed cowboy hat to
introduce last weekend's 49th annual Boomtown party. The event, one
of Hollywood's most durable charity benefits, raised $1.3 million for
SHARE (Share Happily and Reap Endlessly) programs supporting the
developmentally disabled. More than 500 Tinseltown types--duded up
like a dress-extra call for "Destry Rides Again"--packed the floor of
Santa Monica Civic Auditorium for "Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance,"
featuring Ron Masak, Ray Charles, Olivia Newton-John, Garry
Shandling, James Gandolfini and, of course, the high-kicking SHARE
ladies, from 26 (Jordan Ladd) to 82 (Miriam Nelson).</LD>
<LD>   Many members of SHARE have performed in the annual revue for
decades, and any reference to getting "long in the tooth" is
verboten. "It's amazing. This is the only place you can go and see
older women in this town," said Roseanne.</LD>
<LD>   SHARE, started in 1953 by seven entertainment-industry women to
support programs for the developmentally disabled, has raised $38
million over the years and now funds 16 diverse Southland agencies
ranging from Ahead with Horses Inc. to Villa Esperanza.</LD>
<TE>   The event was dedicated to the memory of longtime supporters
Milton Berle and Jay Livingston, and honored HBO programming head
Chris Albrecht, who was given SHARE's Shining Spirit Award by
Gandolfini.</TE>
<TE>   Maxine Smith chaired the show, produced by her husband, Gary
Smith, for the 14th year, with help from SHARE President Joni Berry
and others, including founding member Gloria Franks, who was honored
as member of the year, presented by SHARE's board chairman, Marilyn
Katleman.</TE>
<TE>   Spotted in the crowd were Laraine Day, Dana Grilikhes, Roni Sue
Malin, Sandra Siegel, Lara Lizer Word, Mandie Rush and a host of
stars, from Joe Pesci to Dick Van Dyke to Red Buttons. And Boomtown
party chairman Jan Sarnoff was there with her husband, Tom, sporting
the Hoss Cartwright-style hat he's worn to this party for 43 years.</TE>

<TE>   CHOC Follies</TE>
<TE>   Proving they could dance and belt out a song with the best of
them, dozens of community leaders showcased their talents in the CHOC
Follies, which netted $400,000 for Children's Hospital of Orange
County's Kids Care Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Staged in a tent across from the Orange County Performing Arts
Center in Costa Mesa, the four showings of "The Slipper and the
Surfer"--a musical comedy presented last weekend--drew more than
3,000 spectators.</TE>
<TE>   The Cinderella-inspired story line featured Serena (Susan Crouse)
meeting with surfer bum Richie Bucks (Ryan Hall) at a gala barbecue
despite the antics of her wicked stepsisters (played in drag by Terry
Jones and Rick Reiff).</TE>
<TE>   "The magic of being in the Follies is that you have the chance to
do something wonderful for children and also make a personal
stretch," said Jones, the center's vice president of development.</TE>
<TE>   The production, sponsored by the CHOC Foundation and John and
Donna Crean, was co-chaired by Leslie Cancellieri, Sandy Segerstrom
Daniels and Dale Skiles. Players also included Pat Poss, Martin
Hubbard, Michelle Reinglass, John Gates, John Igarashi, Mary Pham,
Linda Dixon and Heidi Miller.</TE>

<TE>   Erasing Stigma</TE>
<TE>   Carrie Fisher, Rod Steiger and Maurice Benard were honored by the
Didi Hirsch Community Mental Health Center for their roles in helping
change perceptions of mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago the center, which provides mental health programs
at a dozen locations in the Los Angeles area, launched an aggressive
drive to eliminate the shame and ignorance that prevents individuals
from pursuing treatment. Fisher and Steiger were the first
personalities from the entertainment world to offer support, and have
served as honorary co-chairs since, sharing their personal battles
with mental illness to encourage others to seek help.</TE>
<TE>   For their efforts, Fisher, Steiger and soap star Benard, who is
spokesman for the National Depressive and Manic Depressive Assn.,
were recognized at the sixth annual Erasing the Stigma Leadership
Awards luncheon  at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, which raised
more than $140,000.</TE>
<TE>   In presenting Benard's award, Annette Bening lauded him for
breaking stereotypes. "Maurice plays a 'macho guy' on 'General
Hospital,' and macho guys--especially Latinos--don't go for help,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tracey Ullman, who presented the award to Fisher, said "Carrie is
not Princess Leia, a damsel in distress. She's a hero, who gets back
on her horse after a fall and rides back into battle." In accepting
the award, Fisher said, "I'm proud I'm surviving my breakdown. Bring
it on! I don't see it as a weakness. Bipolar disorder is 'glow in the
dark.' It's easier to find. What doesn't kill you makes you
stronger!"</TE>
<TE>   Steiger, narrator of the radio-documentary series "Voices of an
Illness," made a plea for openness and understanding. "Cease the
silence; apathy is our enemy. I've had a continuous battle with
mental illness and I don't want my offspring to face the same
battle," he said. "The prejudice is as bad as racial prejudice."</TE>
<TE>   George Segal, who emceed the May 17 event, brought his banjo along
to sing a duet with his wife (and former high school sweetheart),
Sonia. Beatrice Stern chaired the event committee.</TE>

<TE>   Wining and Dining</TE>
<TE>   A fire-swallowing Maid Marian, wandering minstrels and a platoon
of serfs toting trays of roasted quail and dragon tail, sozzled
striped bass with rose hips, smoked venison, lamb pie and enough
prime beef to stoke the entire Pac-10. Not your usual little Sunday
frolic in Pasadena, let alone in the hallowed halls of the city's
venerable Masonic Temple.</TE>
<TE>   No one went home hungry--or thirsty--after the bacchanal, the
"Pageant of the Chefs: A Nouvelle Medieval Feast," to benefit the
American Institute of Wine &amp; Food. Jim Dodge, Natasha MacAller and
Marilyn Stambler chaired the May 19 event with Dalia Miller and Teri
Solomon.</TE>
<TE>   This was the first medieval-themed fund-raising venture for the
300-member L.A. chapter, which raised more than $65,000, due in part
to proceeds from a lively silent auction of premium wines.
Participating chefs included Lee Hefter of Spago, Raphael Lunetta of
JiRaffe, Terri Buzzard of Getty Museum Restaurant; Michael Cimarusti
of Water Grill; Suzanne Goin of Lucques; and Nancy Silverton of
Campanile.</TE>
<TE>   Dale Kristien headlined the entertainment, which included the
Beverly Hills High School Madrigals and a parade of confection art
created by chefs Peggy Alter, Thomas Henzi, Stanton Ho and Donald
Wressel. Among the revelers were Kristien's former "Phantom" co-star
Michael Crawford and musical conductor Ron Abel.</TE>

<TE>   Schneiders Saluted</TE>
<TE>   Major donors to the Orange County Philharmonic Society gathered to
honor Eva and Fred Schneider for their longtime support and
leadership at a formal dinner May 19 at the Pacific Club in Newport
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Thirty years of association with a nonprofit is rare," board
President Donald P. Evarts told about 100 guests, as he presented the
couple with the society's Golden Baton Award. "Eva has been in charge
of every philharmonic committee, and Fred's contacts in Austria have
helped us bring the Vienna Philharmonic to Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   The couple's dedication to the philharmonic society was sparked by
a newspaper article years ago that called Orange County "a cultural
wasteland," Eva Schneider said. "That got us going."</TE>
<TE>   Past Golden Baton winners have included Zubin Mehta, Donald Bren
and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn.</TE>

<TE>   Fashion Plates</TE>
<TE>   The 50 models were volunteers, but guests welcomed them like pros
at the annual Gentlemen's Haberdashery fashion show and luncheon to

<TE>   The benefit, held at the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel &amp; Tennis
Club, raised $250,000 for the nonprofit center that is the site of
day-long retreats for thousands of Orange County schoolchildren each
year. Rancho Mission Viejo President Tony Moiso and his wife,
Melinda, were co-chairs of the May 15 event.</TE>

<LD>Fisher had a new bed. He liked to hide under the bed. His mother
could not find him.</LD>
<LD>   "Now, where could Fisher be?" she would ask.</LD>
<LD>   Then Fisher would peek out from under the bed and say, "Here I am!
I found me!"</LD>
<TE>   One day at the breakfast table, Fisher's dad asked: "Has anyone
seen my comb?"</TE>
<TE>   Fisher jumped down from his chair. He ran into his bedroom. When
he came back, he was holding a comb. "Here it is! I found it!" he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you," his dad said. "Where was it?"</TE>
<TE>   Fisher just smiled.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, his mom was looking for something. "Have you
seen my thimble?" she asked Fisher.</TE>
<TE>   "What's a thimble?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little silver thing I put on my finger when I'm sewing.
Then I won't stick myself with the needle."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, that!" Fisher said. He ran to his room. When he came back, he
held up the little silver thing. "Here it is! I found it!" he said.</TE>
<TE>   His mom was surprised. "You certainly know where to find
everything," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher just smiled.</TE>
<TE>   This went on for several days. Things disappeared, and Fisher
always found them.</TE>
<TE>   Then, one day when his mom was cleaning, she moved Fisher's bed.
And there, tucked neatly underneath, were pencils, books, scissors,
tape, tools and more.</TE>
<TE>   "Fisher!" she hollered.</TE>
<TE>   And that was the end of Fisher's secret!</TE>

<TE>   One of Nancy Robison's sons kept all his "treasures" under his bed
just like Fisher. This story will be on The Times' Web site at

<HD>A Policy In From the Cold</HD>
<DH>The Bush administration has returned to Cold War-style
secrecy and an end-justifies-means attitude</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the overheated atmosphere of the capital, who said what, when, to
whom about which terrorist threats now fills the air and the
airwaves. So when the Bush administration suddenly begins to seize
upon and publicize every snippet of intelligence and every worry
about possible new terrorist strikes, one might suspect it is just
covering its flanks.</LD>
<LD>   That would be a mistake. Seeing the administration's latest burst
of warnings and fearful rhetoric as nothing but defensive politics
would miss a larger point.</LD>
<LD>   In the shock and carnage of Sept. 11, the president's men found
their reason for being. They heard a call.</LD>
<TE>   During the early months of George W. Bush's presidency, his
national security team floundered, employing what some here called
"an ABC foreign policy"--anything but Clinton. Now, in the war on
terrorism, they not only have found their calling, they have returned
to familiar territory.</TE>
<TE>   In their command posts, ever vigilant, fingers on a new button,
they wait for "the big one"--much the way many of these same
officials did during previous government service during the Cold War
of bygone days.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the new crusade feel so natural to the Bush team is
that it looks so much like the old one: It is not conventional
terrorism, but the possibility of terror with weapons of mass
destruction, or WMD, that has galvanized the administration.</TE>
<TE>   With that possibility comes a renewed appetite for covert action
and human agents, a need to root out internal security risks, a rise
in Cold War-style government secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere, the national security establishment is humming with
new missions, new funds, new offices with esoteric names and no
publicly stated duties--the Defense Department's C4ISR for HLS
Operations, for instance. But scratch the surface and it is nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons that give this new war its drive, in
much the way Russian and Chinese warheads did the old.</TE>
<TE>   In that, the familiar could blind the new Cold Warriors to the
obvious: Horrific as weapons of mass destruction are, it is
conventional explosives that have carried terrorism to new heights.
And with this new Cold War mentality has come a reversion to the old
notion that when it comes to national security, more and bigger is
always better.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration has unlocked the federal Treasury to
combat global terrorism and completed an intellectual back-flip by
agreeing to substantive growth in the size and reach of the federal
bureaucracy," says one retired military officer who works on homeland
security in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, despite the administration's view that the previous
administration wasn't serious about anything in foreign policy, Bush
is largely following Bill Clinton's road map.</TE>
<TE>   On June 21, 1995, President Clinton signed a secret document
called Presidential Decision Directive 39, declaring: "The United
States shall give the highest priority to developing effective
capabilities to detect, prevent, defeat and manage the consequences
of nuclear, biological or chemical materials or weapons used by
terrorists." Before Sept. 11, the Bush administration paid little
attention to the directive. Since then, it has embraced the Clinton
priorities with a passion.</TE>
<TE>   No one can dispute the dangers of international terrorism or the
need for an effective response. Nonetheless, there are two problems
with the Bush administration's response:</TE>
<TE>   First, by focusing so much attention and so much of the new money
on weapons of mass destruction, the government may neglect the more
likely dangers of simpler attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Second, by embracing the mind-set of the Cold War--with its
implicit fear for national survival--the Bush administration has
started down a road of secrecy and end-justifies-the-means thinking.
In the past, that fear became a license to commit abuses ranging from
violations of individual rights to foreign adventures that damaged
the national interest without greatly enhancing security.</TE>
<TE>   It seems symptomatic of this mind-set that high-level officials I
have talked to bristle at the slightest questioning of their strategy
or methods. But the questions need asking. Has Operation Enduring
Freedom failed because the United States did not get Osama bin Laden
or Mullah Mohammed Omar? Have civil liberties been threatened in the
treatment of terror suspects? Is all the secrecy necessary?</TE>
<TE>   The answers from senior administration officials are uniform:
Thwarting terrorists overrides all other priorities. Any intelligence
gained is worth what is sacrificed. The American people understand
such "inconveniences."</TE>
<TE>   Such certainty harks back to the earliest days of the old Cold
War, but it is worth remembering that the Bush administration's claim
to authority is newly found. Despite repeated terrorist incidents and
warnings of future attacks in the months and years leading up to
Sept. 11, terrorism did not receive "the highest priority" from the
new administration before the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the almost obsessive focus on weapons of mass destruction
poses another problem as well. In 1994, Congress broadened the legal
definition of such weapons to include any large destructive device,
such as the Oklahoma City truck bomb. Thus, while the public may be
worrying about nuclear devices hidden on cargo ships or deadly toxins
at the mall, the expanded legal definition--like the old Cold War
threat--can be stretched to justify almost anything.</TE>
<TE>   And that definition is fully embraced in secret plans and
directives approved by the president. The Joint Chiefs of Staff even
invented a new acronym for the expanded threat: CBRNE (pronounced
"see-burn"), for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and
High-Yield Explosives.</TE>
<TE>   "CBRNE includes any event, industrial accident, act of nature, act
of war, or terrorism," a document from the Joint Chiefs of Staff
notes. "WMD refers to a CBRNE device specifically designed to produce
casualties."</TE>
<TE>   The federal response, to put it mildly, has been overkill. Clinton
and Bush administration directives have now brought to life an entire
government infrastructure for dealing with terrorism and weapons of
mass destruction, much of it hidden from public view.</TE>
<TE>   The Army's "Operation Garden Plot," a plan formulated in the 1960s
for dealing with large civil disturbances, has been dusted off and
updated to focus mostly on military intervention in response to a
domestic event involving weapons of mass destruction. Special
Operations Command, and more specifically the super-secret Delta
Force, now have a role in thwarting and responding to domestic
terrorist incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Loads of new organizations have been created and existing agencies
refocused, including National Guard WMD-Civil Support Teams in dozens
of states, a Marine Corps Chemical and Biological Incident Response
Force, a Chemical and Biological Rapid Response Team and others.</TE>
<TE>   Secret organizations with obscure names like the Joint Technical
Operations Team and the enhanced command, control, communications,
computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) for
Homeland Security Operations have been moved to center stage. Their
stated purpose is to deal with America's worst nightmares, but at
least some of their actual duties remain secret.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, an organizing headquarters called the Joint Task Force
Civil Support was established to focus on "consequence management" by
the Defense Department in the event of a domestic CBRNE incident.</TE>
<TE>   "The key word is 'civil' support," President Clinton's secretary
of Defense, William S. Cohen, said on Oct. 7, 1999, at the task
force's activation ceremony. "Under this joint task force it is very
clear that [the military] is subordinate to civilian control. It is
not in any way meant to undermine the doctrine of posse comitatus."</TE>
<TE>   The reason Cohen stressed civil support was the sensitivity of
using military forces in law enforcement. The Posse Comitatus Act
bars federal military forces from executing or enforcing the laws,
except as "authorized by the Constitution or act of Congress."</TE>
<TE>   In practice, no one seems too concerned today about civilian
control and the legal prohibition on using the military for civilian
law enforcement. "We don't see any problem with posse comitatus,"
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said on May 7. "We're not
proposing, nor is the president proposing, that the military suddenly
involve itself in roles that historically we've not been involved in
and which, by statute, we've been prohibited from being involved in
absent waivers."</TE>
<TE>   The key word in Rumsfeld's statement is "suddenly." None of what's
been done has been sudden. Much of this infrastructure was already
building before Sept. 11; it was just on autopilot. Since Sept. 11,
though, the Bush team has embraced more radical organizational change
to fight a new war. This year, it activated yet another provisional
task force--Joint Force Headquarters for Homeland Security. A new
Department of Homeland Security will likely join the Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks of Sept. 11 "placed our nation ... on wartime
footing," Gen. William F. Kernan, commander of U.S. domestic response
forces, told Congress last month. "All elements of [the military],
active, reserve, National Guard, civil service and contract employees
are involved in this two-front war at home and abroad."</TE>
<TE>   But is Al Qaeda or the international terrorist community the
equivalent of the old Soviet Union? And does a Cold War approach
offer our best hope of safety and security? Or does it just offer
beleaguered government officials the reassurance of something
familiar?</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney, in his statements last week, seemed to
display a veteran's own skepticism, predicting a new terrorist
incident with certainty. Absent the frightening rhetoric, the need
for unlimited government action might actually be questioned.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, there is fear--fear that seems to have affected
the government even more than the public.</TE>

<KH>DOWNTOWN</KH>
<HD>Sack the Stadium</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM FULTON</AU>
<BD>William Fulton, president of Solimar Research Group and
publisher of California Planning &amp; Development Report, is the author
of "The Reluctant Metropolis: The Politics of Urban Growth in Los
Angeles."</BD>
<DL>VENTURA</DL>
<LD>So, Mayor James K. Hahn and other L.A. politicians have signed on to
the idea of another Death Star in downtown Los Angeles. The
powers-that-be want to build a football stadium across the street
from Staples Center. Although the stadium won't be subsidized by
public funds, the plan was announced one day after the city created a
redevelopment area for the neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Death Star Row is getting pretty long in L.A. There are the
cathedral, the Music Center, Disney Hall, the vacant office buildings
around Pershing Square, Staples Center, the Convention Center and now
the possible football stadium. The theory seems to be that if you
stick enough of these edifices downtown, people will think downtown
is the center of something.</LD>
<TE>   All these institutions operate more or less the same way: People
from other parts of the city or county drive into parking garages,
travel through walkways and in elevators to the event they're
attending, then depart--leaving behind little trace they were ever
there. In other words, these edifices operate like the Death Star in
the "Star Wars" movies. But as we've learned over and over again in
the last 40 years, a successful U.S. downtown has to be something
more than a location for big institutions. It also has to be a
place--a central location that includes a variety of subtle and
varied activities (businesses, institutions, street life) that enable
people to view it as a part of their own identity. Because of the
city's decentralized nature, L.A. has always had an uphill battle to
create this kind of identity. But other Western cities have managed
to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Take, of all places, Phoenix. In the last 10 years, Phoenix has
pumped more than $1billion into downtown cultural and entertainment
venues. The result: Downtown Phoenix has become a place that people
from all over town go out of their way to visit and identify with.</TE>
<TE>   To truly appreciate this accomplishment, you have to understand
just how scruffy downtown Phoenix used to be. Phoenix is often
regarded as a mini-Los Angeles--sprawling, low-rise,
automobile-oriented, fast-growing. Its downtown also resembled
L.A.'s. It had some civic and cultural buildings, a few hotels and
leftover retail establishments.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown Phoenix was way too big to be cohesive, and people had
long ago left to live their lives elsewhere. The office towers moved
north to "Midtown" (the equivalent of the Wilshire Corridor), and the
people amused themselves in shopping malls and small, close-in
suburban downtowns like Scottsdale and Tempe (respectively the
equivalent of Old Town Pasadena and Santa Monica's Third Street
Promenade).</TE>
<TE>   To remake itself, Phoenix scrunched virtually all cultural and
entertainment edifices into a small area. The list of edifices is
familiar: A baseball stadium. An arena. An opera house. A museum. A
convention center. And the standard menu of hotels, shopping centers
and parking garages, all built with public subsidies that were hotly
debated at the time. There is something going on in Phoenix every
night of the year. Except that, unlike in Los Angeles, all this stuff
is within about a three-block radius, connected with beautifully
landscaped pedestrian walkways. In a metro area with little
variation, the cultural and entertainment district in downtown
Phoenix is not just small but compelling.</TE>
<TE>   And there's no football stadium. There are a lot of reasons for
this, not the least of which is that Arizona State University's Sun
Devils Stadium--where the National Football League's Arizona
Cardinals also play--is less than 15 minutes away, adjacent to
downtown Tempe (kind of like the Coliseum). But another reason is
that a football stadium is the one kind of edifice that doesn't fit
comfortably into the context of a downtown as a place. Arenas can be
used almost every night. Baseball stadiums are used 80 times a year,
and the best ones provide an intimate experience that whets people's
appetite for walking and hanging around in local establishments.</TE>
<TE>   Even under the best of circumstances, football stadiums are used a
couple of days a week in the fall--and an equivalent number in the
spring and summer for soccer or some other complementary sport.
They're cavernous, and the experience they provide is far from
intimate. In short, football stadiums don't stimulate urban life.</TE>
<TE>   That's why big, confident, prosperous cities don't care much about
football stadiums and focus, instead, on other types of venues more
conducive to city living. Why do you think the San Francisco Giants
get to play in beautiful PacBell Park in downtown San Francisco,
while the San Francisco 49ers are still relegated to a blustery venue
seven miles away, now referred to as "San Francisco Stadium at
Candlestick Point"?</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the cities that shell out big bucks for football
teams are not the big guys, but the smaller cities desperate to
create or reignite a sense of identity. That's why the Rams moved
from Los Angeles (No.2 metro area in the country) to Anaheim (No.56)
to St. Louis (No.49), and the Oilers, now the Tennessee Titans, from
Houston (No.4) to Memphis (No.18) to Nashville (No.22).</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles should forget about a football stadium across from
Staples. Downtown needs housing, liveliness, culture--people who want
to live an urban life. It may never be Paris, but that doesn't mean
it has to be Hackensack.</TE>
<TE>   If a football stadium gets built in some other city in Southern
California more desperate to have a National Football League team, so
what? Indeed, given recent trends, why should the NFL try so hard to
make a deal with the second-largest city in the country when the
potentially sixth-largest city is waiting in the wings? If the
football owners are willing to wait until after Nov. 5, they can
surely make a sweet deal for the Van Nuys Chargers.</TE>

<HD>Our Bookshelves, Our Selves</HD>
<DH>My two boys showed the librarians how each book had their
great-aunt's name in it, explaining that she would live on in their
library.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN GIESBERG</AU>
<BD>Susan Giesberg works in consumer protection for the
state of California.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I called one afternoon after my aunt died. Would the library accept
books from a longtime patron and avid reader? The woman softly asked
who the patron was.</LD>
<LD>   Who was she? Such a humanizing question to an anonymous call.</LD>
<LD>   My mother and I had been sorting through my aunt's life
possessions for weeks by then, making difficult decisions as we
neared the end of the month when her apartment would have to be
cleared. Her clothes would be split between charities here, in Israel
and in Guatemala. The food would go to a food bank. Her art and
papers--childhood report cards, letters, newspaper clippings--would
be packed up to be explored with my sons on chilly evenings in front
of the fireplace, a way of keeping alive the memories of their Aunt
Thelma, or Tanta Tibe as we called her.</LD>
<TE>   But it was her books that sprang to mind when the librarian asked
about my aunt. Her simple white bookcase held a prominent place in
her apartment. She had no need to own a lot of books. She had the
public library, and she used it endlessly to feed her thirst. The
books she did own--often purchased at library sales--were stuffed
with newspaper clippings about the author, book reviews or, in some,
the author's obituary.</TE>
<TE>   Going through the books was the hardest, as my mother and I sat
across from each other reading aloud the clippings, opening up
book-marked pages, reading underlinings. There were short
inscriptions from authors and longer personal notes from friends who
had given her books. We felt we were in her presence. We made five
piles--books for my parents, for me, for my brother, for a Jewish
library and for my aunt's beloved Fairfax branch of the Los Angeles
Public Library.</TE>
<TE>   Which is how I happened to find myself on the phone with a woman
at the library asking about the patron. Her name was Thelma Cohen, I
said, wondering why the woman asked. Could they possibly know her at
a busy library in a city the size of Los Angeles? We knew Thelma, the
woman said after a brief silence. She was one of our frequent and
long-time patrons. In fact, the staff had recently talked about her
and wondered if she was all right. She had not been at the library
recently. The woman offered condolences I could tell were heartfelt
and asked me to hold for her supervisor, who would want to talk to
me.</TE>
<TE>   My aunt came by her love of libraries honestly. Her mother--my
grandmother--was a constant patron as well. I once asked my Bubbie
how she remembered which books she had already checked out, and she
said she put a large check mark on the back page of each book she
finished. After she told me this, I went out of curiosity to the old
Beverly Hills Library and discovered that every Yiddish book there
had a large check mark.</TE>
<TE>   On the day we took Tanta Tibe's books to the library, several
staff approached and asked if we were Ms. Cohen's family. They told
us of the Tibe they knew, a kind yet private woman. And they asked
about her work, our family and her illness. My mother and I glowed.
My two boys showed the librarians how each book had their
great-aunt's name in it, explaining that she would live on in their
library. We stayed to talk and check out books, noticing how the
library staff greeted many patrons by name, eagerly discussing books
they were seeking.</TE>
<TE>   Libraries are a touchstone in many people's lives, places not just
of shared knowledge but of community. And this was a gem of a
library.</TE>
<TE>   The books my aunt read enriched her life. They took her to places
she would never visit; they brought her joy; they gave her courage
and comfort. One of the last books my mother and I came upon was
"Peace of Mind" by Joshua Loth Liebman, written in 1947 and inscribed
to her from her "loving brother Morris." Torn pieces of paper marked
several pages. On page 134, she had underlined a passage that gave us
a window into her thoughts: "Nature herself gives us courage....
Death is not to be feared. It is a friend.... Depart then without
fear out of this world even as you came into it.... Yield your torch
to others as in a race.... I often feel that death is not the enemy
of life, but its friend, for it is the knowledge that our years are
limited which makes them so precious.... The day that we are
privileged to spend in the great park of life is not the same for all
human beings, but there is enough beauty and joy and gaiety in the
hours if we will but treasure them. Then for each one of us the
moment comes when the great nurse, death, takes man, the child, by
the hand and quietly says, 'It is time to go home. Night is coming.
It is your bedtime, child of earth.'"</TE>
<TE>   At the checkout desk I gave the clerk Tanta Tibe's library card to
cancel. The woman said it was too soon; they would let her live a
little longer in this wonderful sanctuary of books. She was blessed
to have found this haven.</TE>

<HD>Perhaps They Don't Hate Our Values</HD>
<DH>In Cairo, it's easy to find a McFalafel and fries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL KOSS</AU>
<BD>Mitchell Koss is a producer for Channel One News. His
work has appeared on public television's "Nova" and "The News--Hour
with Jim Lehrer" and on ABC and MTV.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 11 on a Tuesday night a few weeks back, my colleagues and I were
in a crowded barbershop in central Cairo. A television set in the
corner of the shop was tuned to "Men Se Va Al Million," the most
popular television program in Egypt. Reputedly it's the most popular
show ever broadcast across the Arab world, which is not surprising,
perhaps, given the success here in the United States of the show's
English--language version, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" In a kind
of affirmation of globalization, the men watching in the shop
included us in the game, holding up their fingers after each question
to show us the correct answer.</LD>
<LD>   The pleasant camaraderie of the moment stood in stark contrast to
our situation of a few days earlier, when we had been covering the
fighting in the West Bank. We had come to Egypt to report on the
effect that the Israeli incursion into Palestinian territory was
having on Egyptians' attitudes toward the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   We certainly found in Egypt those rising levels of hostility
toward the U.S. everyone's been writing about. Every day, the
newspapers were full of headlines about alleged Israeli atrocities in
the West Bank--atrocities that were implicitly our fault. But
standing there in the Cairo barbershop, it seemed that before we
resignedly accept that a fresh round of anger from the Islamic world
is cause for alarm, we should think about what happened during the
last round. In terms of current public attitudes, maybe we're winning
that one.</TE>
<TE>   Let's back up. After Sept. 11, the mainstream view seemed to
accept that globalization had shrunk the world to a point where we
were constantly bumping elbows with a billion people--the world's
Muslims--who were irreconcilably hostile to our values. There was a
great deal written and broadcast about the natural animosity of the
Islamic world toward the U.S.--even to the point of attempting to
revive Samuel Huntington's largely discredited 1993 Foreign Affairs
article "The Clash of Civilizations," which predicted inevitable
conflict between traditionalist Islamic peoples and the West.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in Egypt, even at militant places like Cairo University where
the students expressed considerable anger at the U.S. for its backing
of Israel, what really struck me was what the Egyptians no longer
seem to be angry about.</TE>
<TE>   What I didn't hear, even from the angriest students, was that the
United States is the enemy of Islam. Nor did I hear the slogan most
prevalent in Egypt during my previous visit in 1993, "Islam is the
solution." Back then, Islamic militants were battling the Egyptian
government--and denouncing everything American or Western that
globalization was bringing to their country.</TE>
<TE>   After a lot of sneaking around behind the backs of our government
escorts that trip, I was eventually put in touch with two young
Islamic militants. They were middle-class kids, earnest medical
students. At a time when Western human rights groups estimated that
the Egyptian government was holding at least 10,000 political
prisoners, it was a big risk for them to talk to our cameras, even
with their faces obscured. But they firmly believed, as they told us,
it was "Islam or disaster."</TE>
<TE>   The fear then among Western foreign policy experts was that a tide
of Islamic militancy could create more anti-Western nations in the
mold of the Islamic Republic of Iran. They pointed to Algeria and its
even more violent Islamic insurgency, with militants murdering
representatives of globalization like pop singers and women wearing
makeup.</TE>
<TE>   But another force was also coming into play. In 1994, the year
after my visit, Cairo got its first McDonald's, and thousands of
Egyptians showed up on opening day. Now there are many outlets around
the city where you can get a McFalafel and fries. Global culture,
anathema to Islamic militants, doesn't seem to be an issue. Even the
supposedly militant sheik we visited was uncritical of the U.S.,
except about its support of Israel. "We know that America is a fair
country," he told us. "We need the American people to push their
government toward fairness." And when the topic of "Men Se Va Al
Million," came up, he beamed. "If I were to go on that show, I would
win not 1 but 2 million."</TE>
<TE>   Violent incidents by Islamic militants have declined in recent
years, but according to U.S. officials there is no good measure of
the relative level of militancy there. On the surface, however, it
would certainly appear to have declined. In Cairo's poor
neighborhoods people routinely told us, "There used to be militants
here, but no more." Now the slogan is "Islam can't fix your car." The
widespread interest in winning a million seems logical.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, Egypt has indeed become like Iran--but not in the way
we feared. The last time I visited Iran, in the summer of 2000, a
growing disenchantment with Islamic rule was apparent everywhere,
along with appreciation of what globalization brings. Even in
Algeria, I found during my last visit, a majority of people seem to
reject Islamic militancy--although the killing there continues.</TE>
<TE>   Cairo today seems to be an argument for the proposition that just
maybe, contrary to all the post-Sept. 11 coverage, we all do share
some of the same values--many of them carried by globalization. But
that could also be where the problem lies. Maybe we aren't sharing
them evenly enough. Maybe we aren't hated for our values but for who
gets left behind.</TE>
<TE>   If so, there can be no comfort in looking to the day when Arab
rage over the plight of the Palestinians will subside in Egypt, just
as Islamic militancy seems to have today. Because it's easy to
imagine that even if the Palestinians get everything they want,
Egypt's real problems will still be there. And so will the real
reasons for its anger.</TE>
<TE>   Get off the freeway that connects downtown Cairo with the tourist
attractions of Giza and you'll see vast neighborhoods of three- to
six-story brick buildings in various stages of completion. Many seem
to have simply popped up without any coordination, oversized shanties
in an immense shantytown. The zigzagging, unpaved streets are
garbage--strewn. The home we visited there was far shabbier then the
one we had visited the week before in southern Bethlehem's notorious
Dahaishe refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, in my hotel room, I watched CNN's coverage of the
Zimbabwe elections. Irregularities in the voting drew worldwide
condemnation. Yet, Egypt is arguably less democratic than
Zimbabwe--President Hosni Mubarak likes to run for reelection
unopposed--and not only does the U.S. not protest, we give him $2
billion a year in aid. Perhaps the Egyptian people have noticed this
discrepancy between our expectations for the Islamic world and those
for the rest of the world. If so, perhaps their lurking anger toward
us has an element of disappointment to it.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, globalization might be bringing us a problem that
transcends Egypt. The strongest backlash to globalization might not
come from those rejecting its values--as Al Qaeda and the Taliban
tried to do. The greater problem might be with those who crave its
benefits but despair of ever getting them. And that comes back to the
question of who our enemy really is in our ongoing war on terror. If
we were fighting Islamic fundamentalism, then it seems as if we've
won decisively--at least in terms of public opinion in places like
Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   But if we were fighting popular anger and resentment over the fact
that the Islamic world is one of the least-developed and
least-democratic parts of the world, and that the U.S. backs the
status quo in three of the main Islamic countries--Pakistan, Saudi
Arabia and Egypt, not coincidentally the three countries that
supplied the bulk of Al Qaeda members--then possibly we have a longer
haul ahead. As the Egyptians' anger over Israel shows, there are
plenty of causes to rally around other than the belief in the need to
violently impose strict Islamic government.</TE>
<TE>   Because, finally, now that the whole Arab world is eager to watch
"Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?" globalization won't succeed unless
more than a few people win.</TE>

<AU>PAULA R. NEWBERG</AU>
<BD>Paula R. Newberg is the author of "Double Betrayal:
Human Rights and Insurgency in Kashmir."</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The assassination last week of Kashmiri leader Abdul Ghani Lone ended
a political generation in South Asia. Among the last old-fashioned
nationalists who believed that Kashmiris should decide their
political fate without instruction from India or Pakistan, Lone
risked his life for an idea of tolerance that has nearly disappeared
from the subcontinent's political life. As New Delhi and Islamabad
prepare for war, Lone's death, an inevitable consequence of
sectarianism and militancy gone mad, has dealt a body blow to
political civility.</LD>
<LD>   It is easy to wax romantic about Kashmir. "In the lake the arms of
temples and mosques are locked in each other's reflections," wrote
Kashmiri poet Agha Shahid Ali, and, until the 1980s, this was how
most Kashmiris understood their home. But war overcame Kashmir long
ago, scarring its valleys, displacing its people and poisoning its
politics. Battles among local insurgents, foreign-backed militant
groups and hundred of thousands of Indian security forces have
punctuated the stillness of the countryside since insurgency began in
1989--and Kashmiris have gained nothing.</LD>
<TE>   Some things have changed during these 13 years, however. No one
paid attention to the early insurgency. Kashmir was just another,
occasionally explosive addendum to South Asia's poverty-stricken,
hyperbolic politics. India claimed that the fate of its union rested
on Kashmir's shoulders, Pakistan that its political identity was tied
to Kashmir's, and both demanded that their mutual hostility be solved
in, or by, Kashmir. Insurgents insisted that only armed struggle
would rescue Kashmir from New Delhi's political corruption, and
Islamic militants demanded that Kashmir should become Asia's
advertisement for ideological purity.</TE>
<TE>   Perched among these competing visions are Kashmir's political
rebels. They are mostly old men and the sons of their dead
compatriots, men, like Lone, who passionately seek a way for Kashmir
to survive. They have lived for decades at the edge of failure: Since
India and Pakistan became independent in 1947, Kashmiris have pressed
their case for special constitutional rules for their special place,
convinced that only special care will save them from fragmentation
and their neighbors from war. Lone and his colleagues were optimists
and democrats of a sort, certain that conflicts about Kashmir could
be settled in Kashmir, among Kashmir's diverse communities.</TE>
<TE>   Three wars and one long insurgency have tested their ideas,
commitments and durability. With Lone's death, hardly anyone is left
to uphold the mantle of ordinary politics. Violence has marred the
crossroads culture of the Srinagar Valley, endangered border areas
where Kashmiris, Pakistanis and Indians used to meet and marry, and
disfigured the political landscape almost beyond recognition.
Ironically, low-intensity war in Kashmir has given Indian security
forces and militants common cause: With no leaders left who value
moderation, outright war begins to sound like a solution to South
Asia's violence.</TE>
<TE>   Kashmir's travails, like Afghanistan's, have now merged into the
terrain of terrorism that plagues all its neighbors. Some Kashmiris
thought the global anti-terrorism campaign in Afghanistan and
Pakistan might solve their problems--after all, strategic bargains
among militants boosted the insurgency at critical moments. But
Kashmir seems lost once again lost to deal-making and deal-breaking
among bigger, stronger powers.</TE>
<TE>   India claims the time is ripe to settle the problem of
cross-border terrorism by force. Pakistan may appear tethered to the
goals of the global anti-terrorism campaign, but it is unlikely to
countenance Indian aggression, whether on its soil or Kashmir's.
Kashmir may not be the cause for war between the two countries, but
it is an available excuse and, certainly, an easy venue in which to
wage it.</TE>
<TE>   Worse still, militancy may increase, at least in the short term.
Two years ago, Kashmiri leader Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, at whose father's
grave Lone was killed, said that "militancy is taking a new shape
which will be beyond any control." He was correct. Both India and
Pakistan remain captive to right-wing extremists. In recent weeks,
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has watched from the
sidelines as communal riots have torn apart India's Gujarat state,
while Pakistan's Gen. Pervez Musharraf is busy arresting protesters
who object to repressive Islamic laws. Neither seems to recognize the
contradictions in policies that join their states to those who want
to destroy them.</TE>
<TE>   The day Lone was killed, Vajpayee visited Kashmir, India and
Pakistan massed troops along their shared border, the British defense
chief traveled to India and the U.S. deputy secretary of State
announced plans to visit, too. The world now worries about South
Asia. With war on the horizon, however, entreaties to act peaceably
are no substitute for clear policies based on principled politics.</TE>
<TE>   Lone will be missed. Indignant and persistent, he spoke his
version of truth to all power-holders. He consistently rejected the
incursions of Pakistan-based militants and objected strenuously to
Pakistan's policy supporting them. Keen to keep Kashmir alive as a
unique opportunity for regional resolution, he bristled at any
attempts to equate its problem with Afghanistan's. Lone was willing
to treat both Vajpayee and Musharraf not only as obstacles but also
as instruments for future political reconciliation, and lately, he
was contemplating participating in Jammu and Kashmir state assembly
elections, due in September. He was not always right, but he was
always there.</TE>

<HD>Sharon's Opponents Jockey for Position</HD>

<AU>HILLEL SCHENKER</AU>
<BD>Hillel Schenker is a Tel Aviv journalist.</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>After a bloody crescendo of suicide bombings, "Operation Defensive
Shield," the Saudi initiative and the American plan to convene a
Middle East peace conference this summer or fall, things are
beginning to move around here.</LD>
<LD>   In the past few weeks, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon managed
to convert two ringing defeats into victories. When his own Likud
Party tried to bind him to a total rejection of the Palestinian state
option, he declared that, as a national leader, he was above party
politics and assured U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell that he
still favored a Palestinian state at the end of the process. When his
emergency economic austerity plan suffered a surprise defeat in the
Israeli Knesset last week, Sharon kicked the culprits--ultra-Orthodox
ministers from the Shas and United Torah parties--out of his
coalition government, declaring that he wouldn't budge until the
economic package was passed. Both moves earned him genuine kudos from
a large majority of the Israeli public.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the public continues to send mixed messages to the pollsters.
While 70% support the firing of the ultra-Orthodox ministers, only
37% support the emergency economic package, while 49% are opposed. An
overwhelming 90% are worried about Israel's economic situation.</LD>
<TE>   The public is also sending mixed messages about peace and
security. While 70% support military action in response to the
suicide bombers, more than 60% also back a return to the diplomatic
process, the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state and the
removal of settlements in exchange for peace.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon came to power in February 2001 after the failure of the
Camp David talks and the outbreak of the second intifada. He promised
both personal security and peace, but so far has failed to deliver on
either. He has presided over a sharply declining economy. Still,
Sharon pulled 50% support in the latest polls, but potential
challengers are jockeying for position on both the right and the
left.</TE>
<TE>   His only serious challenger on the right, former Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, is considered the king of the Likud Central
Committee, the body that nominates the party's candidates for
national leadership. Since his loss to Ehud Barak in June 1999,
Netanyahu has roamed the world making public speeches (at $50,000 a
pop) and has studiously cultivated the image of a "new Netanyahu,"
who is less argumentative and more cooperative and inclusive in his
approach. Of course, it may be hard to convince anyone he's really
changed given his recent performance. With one rash political
move--challenging a popular sitting prime minister from his own
party--all of Netanyahu's old negative skeletons came tumbling out of
the closet. The new Netanyahu gave way to "the old Bibi," and his
rivals and the media had a field day.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Netanyahu is a master communicator. His strategy is to
outflank Sharon from the right, declaring not simply that there will
never be a Palestinian state but going beyond that to call for the
destruction of the Palestinian Authority and the expulsion of Yasser
Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Two candidates are competing for the opportunity to challenge
Sharon from the left--Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, who also
doubles as chairman of the Labor Party, and Labor Knesset member Haim
Ramon.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Eliezer's advantages are that he has a military background and
is well entrenched in the party. An Iraqi Jew from a working-class
background, he can play the "man-of-the-people" card. No one ever
called him articulate, however, and no amount of prompting and
preparation will make him telegenic.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon, a former minister of health who got his start in student
politics, is a self-made man from a working-class family south of Tel
Aviv. An effective populist speaker, Ramon proved his ability to win
elections when he broke with his party in 1994 and ran as a reformer
for secretary-general of Histadrut, Israel's huge trade union
federation. On the down side, he has no military background at a time
when national security is on every voter's mind. Moreover, his party
has never quite forgiven him for winning the Histadrut election--and,
some say, destroying the Labor Federation in the process.</TE>
<TE>   All the candidates realize the uphill battle they must wage to
defeat a popular incumbent, and so they look for every weakness.
While Sharon has refused to publicly commit himself to any political
program beyond the "readiness to make painful compromises when the
time comes," both Ben-Eliezer and Ramon are trying to sharpen their
images with specifics.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Eliezer wants to renew negotiations from the point that was
reached at Camp David, pushing for an eventual agreement that would
include Clinton's December 2000 plan for a Palestinian state
encompassing all of Gaza and 95% of the West Bank, including the Arab
sections of East Jerusalem. Ramon is riding a popular wave of support
for a unilateral withdrawal to defensible borders (he calls it
unilateral separation) and the establishment of physical barriers
between Israel proper and a future Palestinian state. Both say that
Arafat has proved that he cannot be a partner for future
negotiations, yet if either is elected it can be assumed that
negotiations will resume immediately with the leadership of the
Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu hopes that the voters will have forgotten the sorry
ending of his previous term in office and that his self-promulgated
reputation as a tough-talking anti-terrorism expert will stand him in
good stead at a time when Israelis are extremely anxious about
suicide bombers. Two key dates are coming up that could shape the
coming elections--the peace conference, which Powell has declared
will be convened soon, and the Labor Party convention this July,
which will draft a new platform. Ben-Eliezer has declared that the
Labor Party will leave the National Unity government soon afterward
in order to establish a clear-cut alternative to the Likud.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line of Israeli politics today: It's personal security
and economics, stupid. If the elections were held tomorrow, Sharon
would win. But if the suicide bombings continue and the economy
deteriorates further, he will become vulnerable to either Netanyahu
on his right or to a left-wing candidate who can clearly articulate
an alternative and convincing political vision.</TE>

<HD>Public, Leaders a Poll Apart</HD>
<DH>Americans' opinions are more nuanced than those of
Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVEN KULL and SHIBLEY TELHAMI</AU>
<BD>Steven Kull is director of the Program on
International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland. Shibley
Telhami is Anwar Sadat professor for peace and development at the
university and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.</BD>
<DL>COLLEGE PARK, Md.</DL>
<LD>When Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon recently visited Washington,
he repeatedly equated Israel's military actions in the West Bank with
the U.S. war on Al Qaeda, the terrorist organization that carried out
the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The U.S.
Congress agrees with him. It overwhelmingly passed a resolution
expressing unequivocal support for Israel's military moves and
stating that "the United States and Israel are now engaged in a
common struggle against terrorism."</LD>
<LD>   But a national public opinion survey conducted mostly after the
congressional resolution was passed (May 1-5) by the University of
Maryland's Program on International Policy Attitudes suggests that
the American public's perspective on the Middle East conflict is more
nuanced than that of Congress. The poll of 801 randomly selected
Americans was funded by the Schooner Foundation and has a margin of
error of 3.5% to 4%. Its results have important implications for the
U.S. role in the Palestinian--Israeli conflict because public opinion
gives the president more leeway than conventionally assumed in
developing policy options.</LD>
<TE>   Only 17% of the survey's respondents said that Israel's struggle
with the Palestinians was best understood as a Mideast version of the
war on terrorism. Yes, 76% of the respondents said the Palestinian
suicide attacks on Israeli civilians were unjustifiable. But the vast
majority thought the conflict was best described as a struggle
between two national groups over the same piece of land.</TE>
<TE>   The survey revealed other differences between how Congress and the
U.S. public viewed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Most
significant, a majority of the respondents blamed both sides equally
for the failure to reach peace and expressed equal levels of
frustration with each side. Of the remainder, less than one-third
favorably viewed the Israelis; significantly fewer had a favorable
view of Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Such even-handedness suggests a policy course quite different from
one infused with the certain convictions of Congress: Two-thirds of
the survey's respondents said the U.S. should not take sides in the
conflict. Perhaps more significant, only one in four thought that the
U.S. was not now backing a party in the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   These findings don't mean that Americans want to see the U.S. get
out of the Middle East. Quite the contrary. Americans want the U.S.
government to put more pressure on both sides to declare a cease-fire
and return to the negotiating table. If the two sides still refused
to end their fighting, 61% of the respondents said they would
threaten to withhold aid to Israel and 64% said they would withhold
some spare parts from Israel's military. As for the Palestinians, 63%
of those polled would threaten to stop some aid to them and 50% said
they would consider not dealing with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat. If the Palestinians ended the suicide bombings and used only
nonviolent forms of protest, the number of Americans who favored
putting more pressure on Israel would rise to 84%.</TE>
<TE>   How does one explain the difference between this poll and other
recent ones whose findings seemed more solidly pro-Israel? As in the
other polls, the respondents in the University of Maryland survey
were more inclined to view Israel favorably. But their more
pronounced even-handedness was the result of being presented with
more options when answering.</TE>
<TE>   Giving more options is especially important when large numbers of
respondents refuse to answer a question. For example, an April 16 Fox
News poll asked respondents which side they blamed more for the
failure to reach peace in the Middle East. More named the
Palestinians (33%) than the Israelis (12%), but a remarkable 55% did
not answer. The University of Maryland survey offered the option of
blaming both sides equally, and 58% of its respondents chose that
response; less than one-third blamed the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   When polls have surveyed sympathy for each side, a larger
percentage has felt comfortable choosing a side. In a May 13-14 CBS
News poll, 47% of the respondents said they were more sympathetic
toward Israel. But 36% had no opinion. In the University of Maryland
poll, respondents were asked to rate how much sympathy they had for
each side in separate questions on a scale of 0 to 10. Half gave
ratings no more than a point apart; only one in three gave Israel a
significantly higher rating.</TE>
<TE>   The surveyed Americans strongly supported (70%) President Bush's
renewed commitment to finding a peaceful solution in the Middle East.
They also seemed to like the administration's increased engagement in
the region.</TE>
<TE>   Two-thirds approved the president's call for Israel to withdraw
its military forces from Palestinian cities, 75% supported Secretary
of State Colin L. Powell's recent meeting with Arafat, and a similar
number backed Bush's endorsement of a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   The source of this support is not only Bush's post-Sept. 11
popularity. It is also Americans' nuanced perspective on Israel and
the Palestinians. While they overwhelmingly reject suicide bombings
and don't much like Arafat, most Americans have reservations about
Israel's behavior too. More than half the respondents in the
University of Maryland's poll thought that Israel's operations in the
West Bank were not only designed to root out terrorists but also to
punish the population.</TE>
<TE>   The poll's respondents also wanted the U.S. government to place a
greater emphasis on multilateralism. Eighty-two percent liked the
idea of an international conference, and when asked who should take
the lead in resolving the Middle East conflict, only 13% named the
United States. Instead, a strong majority said either the United
Nations or a group of leading nations, including the U.S., should
lead.</TE>
<TE>   The poll's respondents wanted to see the U.N. take an even bigger
role. If the Israelis and Palestinians cannot resolve Jerusalem's
status, which was the key stumbling block at Camp David and the
January 2001 talks at Taba, a clear majority supported the idea of
the U.N. taking control of the disputed areas. Solid majorities also
favored the idea of the U.N. Security Council deciding where the
border should be between Israel and a new Palestinian state or of the
U.N. governing the territories as a trustee.</TE>
<TE>   It is clear from the University of Maryland survey that Americans
are paying close attention to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and
how the U.S. is handling it. It also showed that their views of the
combatants are more complex and less partisan than those of
Congress--an opening the White House can well exploit in charting its
course of action in the Middle East.</TE>

<BD>David Wise is the author of the forthcoming book "Spy:
The Inside Story of How the FBI's Robert Hanssen Betrayed America,"
to be published by Random House.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the past week, the public has had to interpret a puzzling new
language emanating from Washington. Official pronouncements about
terrorism are peppered with obscure and mysterious words. There is
"chatter" in the system, "spikes" and "increased volume of noise."</LD>
<LD>   For example, last Tuesday, the president's press secretary, Ari
Fleischer, talking about a string of new warnings of attacks,
declared that "there has been a recent increase in the chatter that
we've heard in the system." On the Sunday talk shows two days
earlier, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice revealed that
"the volume of information has gone up ... you get from time to time
spikes in activity." Not to be outdone, Vice President Dick Cheney
cited "the increased level of noise in the system." (He had been
asked by NBC's Tim Russert about "the chatter out there.") Cheney,
Rice, Fleischer and Russert have not lapsed into the latest Valley
talk; they have simply adopted as their own the euphemisms that
shroud some of the nation's most sensitive forms of
intelligence-gathering.</LD>
<TE>   The jargon describes what spies call signals intelligence, or
SIGINT. Every day, from satellites in outer space, ground stations in
Pine Gap, Australia, Alaska, England, Germany and other points around
the globe, from aircraft, specially equipped submarines and surface
ships, the nation's electronic ears intercept tens of thousands of
communications and conversations and beam them to Washington. A
terrorist using a cell phone in Hamburg, an e-mail from Afghanistan
to Iran, a walkie-talkie conversation in the Hindu Kush mountains of
Pakistan--all may be scooped up and relayed to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Most of this activity is conducted by the National Security Agency
in Ft. Meade, Md., north of the capital. The NSA, with a secret
budget believed to be about $5billion and 35,000 employees, is the
nation's principal eavesdropping agency. But the lesser-known
National Reconnaissance Office, or NRO, has an even bigger budget and
operates more than a dozen spy satellites, with exotic code names
such as Vortex, Jumpseat, Trumpet, Crystal and Tennis.</TE>
<TE>   So, "chatter" or "noise" or "volume" usually refers to the
communications intercepts captured by this global intelligence
system. A "spike" just means that there is more of it, as there was
in the summer leading up to Sept. 11 and, if officials are to be
believed, more recently.</TE>
<TE>   Although the new language generally refers to electronic
intercepts, it can, more broadly, also mean intelligence gathered
from human sources, or HUMINT. For example, the recent vague warnings
that terrorists might blow up the Statue of Liberty emanated from the
interrogation of Abu Zubeida, the Al Qaeda leader captured in
Pakistan in March. Recent warnings that terrorists might target U.S.
banks and other financial institutions also came from him.</TE>
<TE>   But much of the chatter cited by officials refers to
communications intercepts, which are rarely made public. One notable
exception occurred in 1986, when President Reagan went on television
and described intercepts of messages between Libya and East Berlin
that he said proved the Libyan regime was responsible for the bombing
of La Belle discotheque in West Berlin, an attack that killed two
U.S. servicemen and injured more than 200 people. Reagan ordered the
bombing of Libya in response. Lt. Gen. William E. Odom, then head of
the NSA, was livid over the leak but could not complain much publicly
because it was the president doing the leaking.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, a joint CIA-NSA eavesdropping operation picked up
radio-telephone conversations from the limousines of top Soviet
officials in Moscow, including Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev. The
operation, code-named Gamma Gupy, leaked to the news media.</TE>
<TE>   And during the Cold War, the NSA, in a top-secret project called
"Operation Ivy Bells," succeeded in tapping into an underwater
communications cable that the Soviet military used in the Sea of
Okhotsk. But the Russians learned of the operation from a spy, Ronald
Pelton, who had worked for the NSA. He was arrested in 1985,
convicted and sentenced to three consecutive life terms.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, the NSA and the military relied on communications
intercepts to try to pinpoint the location of Osama bin Laden at the
height of the war in Afghanistan. That effort did not succeed, but
U.S. intelligence is still listening, hoping to pick up some hint of
his whereabouts or that of his subordinates.</TE>
<TE>   Because the level of chatter is something that only the
administration knows at any given time, however, it can lead to
suspicions, as were widely aired last week, that the White House was
orchestrating a series of warnings to deflect criticism of its
handling of intelligence information prior to Sept 11.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the chatter from officialdom was extraordinary. On
Sunday, Cheney agreed that the prospect of another terrorist attack
against the U.S. was "not a matter of if, but when." The next day,
Robert S. Mueller III, the FBI director, warned that suicide bombings
on U.S. soil were "inevitable." A day later, Defense Secretary Donald
H. Rumsfeld predicted that terrorists would "inevitably" acquire
chemical, biological, and even nuclear weapons, and the FBI passed on
its warning to New York authorities about Lady Liberty and other
landmarks in the city.</TE>
<TE>   The administration seemed to be saying: "You want warnings? We'll
give you warnings.''</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer appeared to concede as much when he told reporters that
the new alarm bells set off in Washington were "a result of all the
controversy that took place last week."</TE>
<TE>   But viewers and readers attempting to make sense of all this must
be careful to read the fine print. For example, in her appearance on
CBS' "Face the Nation" last Sunday, Rice said: "Well, this--this is
not a new set of warnings. What we have is a flow of information that
has been continuing over a period of time. Sometimes the level or the
volume of information will spike."</TE>
<TE>   In an election year, and with a joint committee of Congress
planning to hold hearings on the terrorist attacks last September and
the shaky role of the intelligence agencies, in Washington the
chatter about chatter is not likely to subside soon.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Until the sale of my home, I lived in a Laguna Niguel
planned community for more than two decades. When I sold, I
encountered activities among my homeowners association board, the
management company and my Realtor that have cost me dearly.</LD>
<LD>   I thought I was a good guy for choosing a "community" person to
sell my house. But I made a mistake in judgment by choosing a Realtor
who was a former board member of my association and a friend of the
management.</LD>
<LD>   During the sale, the Realtor was embroiled in petty politics with
the buyer, board and management, who all manipulated the Realtor's
capacity to make unbiased decisions regarding the sale of my home. I
was the casualty of what I now believe was my board's vengeance.</LD>
<TE>   While living here, I never received a fine or violation notice,
and I had never been late paying my monthly dues. But during the sale
of my home, board members harassed and targeted me by issuing
violation and fine letters without justification or proper procedure.
All were clearly discriminatory and were issued when I had no
recourse but to pay them or jeopardize the sale.</TE>
<TE>   Every time the association or management wanted more money from
me, they would send a violation notice saying that if I did not pay,
they "would put a lien on my property," thus jeopardizing my sale.
Suddenly my association account showed I owed back monthly dues and
late fees.</TE>
<TE>   My Realtor worsened the situation by divulging my personal
information to management and the new buyers without my consent.
During the final days of escrow, the board and management
orchestrated a collection effort consisting of frivolous and
erroneous recommendations that they insisted I adhere to or I would
not be able to close escrow. I was essentially a hostage.</TE>
<TE>   It would have taken weeks to obtain necessary documentation to
prove I did not owe the association dues as claimed.</TE>
<TE>   Compelled to pay fines and penalties I didn't owe, I paid "double"
what they claimed with additional interest charges just so I could
sell my house. This forced me to sell well below my asking price to
complete the sale before the escrow close date.</TE>
<TE>   I tried repeatedly to speak with the board and management, but
their game of avoiding phone calls and refusing to discuss the matter
wore me down. There must be some rein over association boards other
than failed attempts to recall the members or bring a lawsuit. Is
there anything I can do about the way the board, management and my
real estate agent interfered with the sale of my home, and what about
the erroneous fines?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: The impropriety and inequity of fining homeowners
continues to be a serious problem associated with ownership of
deed-restricted property, especially in planned developments.</TE>
<TE>   Before a fine can be levied, the procedures set forth in the
Davis-Stirling Act for the creation of fines must be followed. But
there is no guarantee boards will follow those procedures or the law
and, worse, there is no penalty for the board's noncompliance.</TE>
<TE>   If procedures for fining were not followed, and you paid the fines
to avoid having the sale fall through, you may have a cause of action
against the board to recover those fines, plus interest. Double
billing, erroneous late charges, fees and other assessments made in
error by a board or management company, when they knew or should have
known the fees were in error, may subject the board to more serious
liability.</TE>
<TE>   If you double paid and have documents showing you did not owe the
money, and your overpayments have not been returned to you, you may
have additional causes of action. For amounts less than $5,000, you
may be able to recover that money in Small Claims Court.</TE>
<TE>   Using the "resident" real estate agent and involving management in
the sale of your property was a mistake. Sellers should know that
they do not require the assistance of the homeowner association to
sell their property or transfer their titles, and are advised to seek
"independent" agents or lawyers without loyalties to the association.
If you can show you were damaged by the disclosure of your
confidential information by the real estate agent to others without
authority or permission of that disclosure, you might recover damages
from the agent, his broker or both.</TE>
<TE>   Showing some type of collusion between the Realtor and the board
may entitle you to recover damages based on breach of the fiduciary
duty owed to you by these individuals. Those damages might be the
difference between what your house would have sold for and the actual
selling price. It is important to see an attorney who specializes in
homeowners rights rather than one who represents homeowners
associations.</TE>

<LD>An imposing home on the westerly tip of Harbor Island has come on the
market in Newport Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The 18,000-square-foot house sits on slightly more than half an
acre but has more than 300 feet on the bay front and a dock where
several large yachts could be parked.</LD>
<LD>   It was built in 1990 of concrete and steel and has an eight-car
subterranean garage.</LD>
<TE>   The house is one of the highest-priced homes for sale in Orange
County. The estate's sale price was the highest for the area in 1991,
when Hong Kong hotelier George Yao bought it for $13.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   During the recession, the property went into foreclosure, and
William G. Simon, former head of the FBI in Los Angeles, bought it
for about $8 million.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, dot-com entrepreneur Robert McNulty bought the house for
about $14 million. He sold it in 2001 for more--estimates ranged from
$14.8 million to more than $18 million.</TE>
<TE>   About this house: The current East Coast owner bought an L.A.
business about three years ago. He is selling the estate because he
sold the business and is moving back to New York, Realtors said.</TE>
<TE>   The property was once part of the estate of L.A. banker and arts
patron Howard Ahmanson. The house was built by local developer Leroy
Carver III, whose father founded a nearby Rolls-Royce dealership.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $22.5 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: 10 bedrooms and 14.5 bathrooms, including a
3,000-square-foot master suite</TE>
<TE>   Features: The gated home, clad in limestone, has six fireplaces,
an elevator, a walk-in wine cooler, staff quarters, a butler's
pantry, a waterfront pool and main channel views.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Samuel L. Jackson, who plays Jedi Knight Mace Windu in "Star Wars:
Episode II Attack of the Clones," and his actress wife, LaTanya
Richardson, have sold their Encino home for just under $2 million.</LD>
<LD>   The buyers are Christopher Knight, who owns L.A. Recording
Workshop, and his wife, Rosanne. L.A. Recording Workshop is a
vocational school in North Hollywood that teaches audio engineering.
The buyers moved from a smaller home in Sherman Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson and Richardson sold their Encino home because they bought
a larger home in the Beverly Hills area nearly two years ago. They
purchased that home from actress and former talk-show host Roseanne
for about $8.9 million.</LD>
<TE>   The home that Jackson and Richardson sold was built in 1981 and
has a four-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot main house and a
3,000-square-foot guest house with a full kitchen. The English
Tudor-style home is on about an acre, behind gates, and has a tennis
court, pool and five-car garage. The property had a small putting
green, which the buyers removed.</TE>
<TE>   The actors' new home has nine bedrooms in 11,000 square feet, and
it is on two acres with a pool, spa, tennis court and rose garden.</TE>
<TE>   The property also has a 2,300-square-foot synthetic putting green,
which has three chipping areas and a sand trap. Scott Griggs, founder
of Encinitas-based Southwest Greens of Southern California, completed
the project for Jackson in March 2001. Jackson, 53, is an ardent
golfer and hosts the annual Samuel L. Jackson Celebrity Golf Classic.</TE>
<TE>   The Oscar nominee (for "Pulp Fiction," 1994) also co-starred with
Ben Affleck in "Changing Lanes," which opened in April. He starred in
the 2000 remake of "Shaft" and played Mace Windu in "Star Wars:
Episode I The Phantom Menace" (1999).</TE>
<TE>   Richardson co-starred in A&amp;E's recently canceled series "100
Centre Street," and she has guest starred in a number of TV series
during the last few years, including "Judging Amy," "Once and Again"
and "Ally McBeal." She appeared with her husband in the movie "Losing
Isaiah" (1995) and was in such other films as "U.S. Marshals" (1998),
"Sleepless in Seattle" (1993) and "Malcolm X" (1992).</TE>
<TE>   Alfie and Myrna Shanfeld at Coldwell Banker Previews, Encino, had
the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley Berman, whose stand-up style influenced comedians such as
Bob Newhart and Woody Allen, and his wife, Sarah, have put their Bell
Canyon estate on the market at $1.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   They bought the home 19 years ago because they wanted a property
where they could keep a horse. The couple now want a smaller place
closer to the actor-comedian's work. He is in his 17th year of
teaching humor writing in the masters of professional writing program
at USC, and he is appearing more often on TV.</TE>
<TE>   The Bermans' ranch-style home is on 1.2 acres in a gated community
with a tennis court and an equestrian center. The one-story,
6,000-square-foot house has six bedrooms and 61/2 bathrooms, soaring
ceilings, a family room with a fireplace and a wet bar, and a large
bonus room.</TE>
<TE>   The property also has a grassy yard in a park-like setting, a
circular driveway and a three-car garage.</TE>
<TE>   The Grammy-winning comic, who was a regular on "The Ed Sullivan
Show," has played various characters on TV series, including
"Friends" and "Providence." He is still doing stand-up comedy and was
a headliner at the Improv Comedy Club in Las Vegas in January. He is
due to play Larry David's father this summer in the TV series "Curb
Your Enthusiasm."</TE>
<TE>   Berman, 76, starred on Broadway during the 1960s in the musical "A
Family Affair" and his one-man show "Insideoutsideandallaround
Shelley Berman." He also has written three books, two plays and a
number of TV pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Doris and Hal Lazner of DBL, Beverly Hills, have the listing.</TE>
<TE>   A 4.2-acre home site in Bel-Air has been sold for its
$13.9-million asking price to two estate developers: Michael J.
Fitzgerald and his brother, C. Elliott. They plan to build a major
estate on the land, which was once a botanical garden for an adjacent
home.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, the garden was sold, and a 7,600-square-foot house was
built there for the late Al Hart, one of a group of businessmen who
founded City National Bank. The house was razed after the property
was sold to an international businessman in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The Fitzgeralds, already working on two major estate sites in the
area, plan to build a 30,000-plus-square-foot home on the former Hart
property. The asking price for the completed home could be as much as
$35 million.</TE>
<TE>   The land is choice because it is large, flat and in an exclusive
part of Bel-Air. More than 50 specimen trees, 60 to 80 feet tall,
remain on the site from its botanical-garden days.</TE>
<TE>   Loren Judd of Westside Estate Agency, Beverly Hills, represented
both sides in the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Alison Arngrim, best known for playing the part of Nellie for
seven seasons in the '70s TV series "Little House on the Prairie,"
and her musician husband, Bob Schoonover of the rock band Catahoula,
have listed their Hollywood Hills home at $545,000.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1945, the house has three bedrooms and 11/2 bathrooms in
1,200 square feet. The home also has a fireplace and canyon and
greenbelt views.</TE>
<TE>   The house has been in Arngrim's show-biz family for more than 50
years. Her aunt, a concert soprano, and uncle, a classical violinist
who appeared in several films, bought the house in 1946. Then
Arngrim's parents owned it.</TE>
<TE>   Her father was a personal manager whose clients included Liberace,
and her mother was the voice of Gumby and Casper the Friendly Ghost.</TE>
<TE>   Arngrim, who is taking her stand-up comedy act to New York at the
end of the month, and her husband, whose band will play at CityWalk
on June 29, have lived in the house for about seven years.</TE>
<TE>   They're selling it, they said, because they are both doing more
work out of town.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Frankel of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills, has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   J. Michael Dolan, publisher of Music Connection Magazine, and his
wife, Nancy, have sold their Encino home of 10 years to film composer
James L. Venable and his wife, Sophia, for $760,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolans bought an ocean-view house in Ventura for $795,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Cape Cod-style Encino home has four bedrooms and three
bathrooms in 3,000 square feet. The house also has a solarium and a
pool.</TE>
<TE>   The property was once part of the Clark Gable estate.</TE>
<TE>   The modern Mediterranean-style home in the Mandalay Shores area of
Ventura has four bedrooms and five bathrooms in 3,800 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Venable just completed scoring "The Powerpuff Girls Movie," which
opens July 3. He also wrote the scores for "Iron Monkey" (1993) and
"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" (2001).</TE>
<TE>   Music Connection Magazine is celebrating its 25th anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Goodman, formerly of Goodman Music and now with Re/Max on the
Boulevard's Estate Division, had the Encino listing. Ben DiBenidetto
and Susan Blau of Re/Max on the Boulevard represented the Venables in
buying. Deborah Tyhurst of Troop Real Estate, Channel Island Harbor,
represented the Dolans in buying.</TE>

<HD>Housing Proposal Includes Tax Credit, Wiring for Internet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--Low-income home buyers would get a new tax credit and
public housing would be wired for the Internet under a plan released
Wednesday by the nation's mayors.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, the beginnings of a blueprint for Congress and the Bush
administration, comes at a time when housing prices are outpacing
incomes, according to the U.S. Conference of Mayors.</LD>
<LD>   "Housing is a very serious problem. It has for many years been on
the back burner," said San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.</LD>
<TE>   Housing Secretary Mel Martinez told the mayors that the White
House would put the issue back atop the domestic agenda. "With all of
the work ahead of us, and all the families who are depending on us,
there is no room in the housing debate for partisan politics," he
said, but added that local governments bear the most responsibility
for handling the problem through such things as zoning policies.</TE>

<HD>Southland Sales Numbers Set an April Record</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of homes sold in Southern California last month was the
highest for any April on record, the result of strong demand and
reasonable mortgage interest rates.</LD>
<LD>   Prices reached a new peak, a real estate information service
reported.</LD>
<LD>   A total of 30,823 new and resale houses and condos were sold in
Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, Ventura, San Bernardino and Orange
counties last month.</LD>
<TE>   That was up 2.2% from 30,146 for the month before, and up 27.8%
from 24,120 for April last year, according to DataQuick Information
Systems.</TE>
<TE>   Last month's sales count was the second-highest for any month
since the late 1980s, behind 32,386 sold last August.</TE>
<TE>   It was the strongest April in DataQuick's statistics, which go
back to 1988.</TE>
<TE>   The median price paid for a Southland home was $258,000 last
month, a new record. That was up 0.4% from $257,000 for March, and up
15.7% from $223,000 for April last year.</TE>
<TE>   The year-over-year increase was the strongest since June 1989,
when prices reached $174,000, up 16% from $150,000 a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The typical monthly mortgage payment that Southland buyers
committed themselves to paying was $1,313 in April. A year ago it was
$1,159. The all-time peak was at $1,360, in April 1989, when interest
rates were higher, DataQuick reported.</TE>

<HD>Modest Kitchen Remodel: It's Top-Drawer</HD>
<DH>For a North Hollywood couple, the time and cost of their
renovation project added up to more than they expected, but so did
the results</DH>
<SE>Last of three parts</SE>
<AU>KATHY PRICE-ROBINSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A little more than halfway through Val and Bernie Van De Yacht's
remodel, the realization of the cozy '50s farmhouse kitchen the
couple had planned for months seemed very far off. Still to come were
the ceiling, the floor and the paint.</LD>
<LD>   Work on the North Hollywood English Tudor seemed to move quickly
during the action-packed demolition and construction phases but then
took on a slow-motion quality during the drawn-out finishing stage.
This is often the time in a remodel when homeowners get tired of
having the contractor around, and the contractor gets tired of being
there.</LD>
<LD>   With Val and Bernie acting as the contractor, they were not upset
at anyone in particular (in fact they were happy with all their
subcontractors, all of whom are licensed) but with the situation
itself.</LD>
<TE>   Val was tense and "sick of having people in my house, especially
in the morning."</TE>
<TE>   Bernie had started with a clear idea of the look he was after but
now wasn't sure if the assorted materials, products, textures and
colors he and Val selected would all blend together.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, the nightly takeout meals, which Val loved two weeks ago,
now seemed "gross." She and Bernie hauled their new microwave out of
its box in the garage with the hope of preparing dinner at home.</TE>
<TE>   Originally the Van De Yachts figured the make-over would cost
$13,900 and take two weeks to complete. The time frame ultimately
doubled, and the final cost rose to $15,730.</TE>
<TE>   From demolition day to this point, the old cabinets and counters
had been hauled away and custom-built cabinets put in their place.
One bank of existing cabinets was fitted with new front frames and
doors. The electrical and plumbing fixtures were upgraded, a
granite-type counter was glued down, and a new sink, faucet, garbage
disposal and dishwasher were installed.</TE>
<TE>   On Day 18 of the remodel, carpenter Chris Trauger installed a
tongue-and-groove wood ceiling, a $610 expense that arose when part
of the ceiling unexpectedly came down during demolition of the old
cabinets. While Val and Bernie had briefly consider just having the
ceiling replastered and painted, this solution to the problem was
more beautiful than they had expected. "Look at the ceiling," Bernie
said. "It's unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Renee Albert, a friend, came over on Day 21 to dab sand mixed with
paint onto the brick behind the stove to give it the distressed look
the couple wanted. For inspiration, they had visited a brick wall at
Sunset and Cahuenga boulevards that Bernie said had the appearance he
wanted.</TE>
<TE>   On the same day, Bernie started painting the kitchen and life grew
more complicated. Not only was he painting from morning to late
afternoon for four days straight, but in the evenings he was
rehearsing a new play he wrote, "There's Something About Meryl," with
his theater group. "I'm exhausted," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He had sought painting advice from Raymond Sjolseth, who had
refinished Val and Bernie's floors when they first bought the house,
and who would be installing the kitchen's pine floor when the
painting was done.</TE>
<TE>   Although a small kitchen, at 10 square feet, it required a lot of
painting, including a creamy white for the cabinets, doors and wood
ceiling (Val had first bleached dark spots and filled the nail holes
with putty), and a pale pink for the walls. It took a coat of primer
and two finish coats to produce the color they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   A flawless paint job was crucial for Val, who has a sensitive eye
for dents, scratches and blemishes. Bernie, on the other hand,
considers himself an "overall person."</TE>
<TE>   "If I look in a room and it feels good, I know it's right," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   When the painting was finally done, Bernie said: "I'll be happy if
I never pick up another paintbrush again." In retrospect, he would
hire someone to do it.</TE>
<TE>   The last major task for the remodel was installing the wood floor,
which was done by Sjolseth and his stepfather, Dan Hemmingway, owner
of Square Deal Floor Co. The team started at 9 a.m. on a Saturday,
Day 26 of the remodel, and finished at 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   To give the finger-joint pine floor a rustic look, the strips were
variously cut into 4-, 6-, 8- and 10-inch widths. Then, the top edges
were beveled so that it had a hand-grooved look when installed. Over
the next three days, the floor was sealed and stained with a natural
teak color and given two coats of non-yellowing polyurethane. "The
floor changes everything," Bernie said. "We can't stop looking at
it."</TE>
<TE>   While some homeowners--harried by the rigors of living with a
noisy, dusty and sometimes fume-filled construction site for weeks or
months--begin to harbor ill feelings toward their contractors and
subcontractors, for Val and Bernie it was just the opposite. While
the floor was going in, they became friends with Sjolseth, 27, who
lives less than a block away. He brought over his CDs to share his
favorite music with the couple, and they invited him to their annual
Academy Award-watching party.</TE>
<TE>   Installing the refrigerator, which the couple had worried would
not fit through the doorway, was anti-climatic after someone
suggested bringing it in with the fridge door wide open. The couple
chose a '50s-style 18-cubic-foot, frost-free Northstar with the lines
of a '55 Chevy that ate up $3,000 of the budget. "It looks like a car
came through the kitchen," Bernie said.</TE>
<TE>   By Day 29, Bernie declared the kitchen "done, done, done," then
added: "Well, sort of." Putting away dishes and pans, the couple
fretted that there wouldn't be enough space. But when they were down
to the last box, they had space to spare.</TE>
<TE>   Even their knickknacks worked well in the remodeled room. An old
iron painted by Val's grandmother became a doorstop. Bernie's
mother's teapot rests on the shelf above the stove. A tulip on the
refrigerator pays homage to their Dutch ancestry.</TE>
<TE>   As a final touch, Val and Bernie asked the carpenter to cut a
cat-shaped opening in the door of the utility cabinet to allow their
two indoor cats access to the litter box. The couple voted it their
favorite thing in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   The kitchen done, the couple sat on a braided rug in the middle of
the room, sipped wine and basked in their creation.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything turned out much better than we expected," Bernie said.
"There's not one thing we don't like."</TE>

<HD>War Emblem Still Has Plenty to Prove</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>RICHARD ROSENBLATT</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Bob Baffert has already proclaimed War Emblem a "superhorse," and
stopped just short of guaranteeing that his colt will become the
first Triple Crown champion in nearly a quarter-century.</LD>
<LD>   The trainer made his remarks the morning after War Emblem added
the Preakness Stakes to his Kentucky Derby victory.</LD>
<LD>   Should he conquer the one mile in the Belmont Stakes on June 8,
War Emblem would give racing its 12th Triple Crown winner and first
since Affirmed in 1978.</LD>
<TE>   But even if War Emblem completes his remarkable rise to stardom,
does the speedy black colt deserve to be in the same company as such
Triple Crown greats as Citation (1948), Secretariat (1973) and
Seattle Slew (1977)?</TE>
<TE>   "To this point, you'd have to consider him a substandard Triple
Crown winner compared to Affirmed, Seattle Slew, Citation," said
Steve Cauthen, "The Kid" who rode Affirmed. "But if he goes on and
continues to prove himself to be a true champion, he'll be remembered
with them."</TE>
<TE>   Penny Chenery, who owned Secretariat, said War Emblem certainly
has a chance to earn his place among racing's greats.</TE>
<TE>   "He's either the best horse in 25 years--or the luckiest," said
Chenery. "But I don't think the end of the Triple Crown is
definitive. He'll have to go on and beat horses that weren't ready in
the spring. And then he'd have to prove he can keep going."</TE>
<TE>   The last four Triple Crown winners--Citation, Secretariat, Seattle
Slew and Affirmed--were all considered exceptional racehorses from
the start, as were Whirlaway (1941), Count Fleet (1943) and War
Admiral (1937). Indeed, Secretariat was Horse of the Year at age 2.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Sir Barton did not win a race before the 1919
Kentucky Derby, and Gallant Fox (1930) and his son Omaha (1935)
showed only flashes of promise as 2-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   But after sweeping the Triple Crown, they all continued winning
and proving themselves worthy champions.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Cordero Jr., a Hall of Fame jockey who has won the Kentucky
Derby three times, said War Emblem still has some running to do
before he's recognized as "exceptional."</TE>
<TE>   "Winning the Triple Crown is a very big step, but he'll have to do
more," Cordero said. "Just beating 3-year-olds doesn't mean great.
He's got to beat older horses, too."</TE>
<TE>   While War Emblem has rolled to four straight victories, his past
could play a part in determining his legacy. He won but two modest
races as a 2-year-old, and finished a distant sixth to Repent in his
first stakes race, the Risen Star, a Grade 3 race at the Fair
Grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Even after he won the Illinois Derby on April 6, his 84-year-old
owner Russell Reineman thought he had no shot in the Kentucky Derby,
and was happy to sell 90 percent of him to Saudi Prince Ahmed bin
Salman for $900,000 three weeks before the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   None of this should be held against War Emblem, but it might.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a lot of criticism but it's not the horse's fault,"
Chenery said.</TE>
<TE>   Added trainer Shug McGaughey, whose Easy Goer spoiled Sunday
Silence's Triple Crown bid in 1989: "Because of the way it came
about, I just don't know if it would mean as much in the annals of
racing as it would normally. It certainly would be a great
accomplishment, though."</TE>
<TE>   Completing the Derby-Preakness-Belmont grind--five weeks, three
race tracks, three distances--is an enormous achievement in itself.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of respect for those Triple Crown winners," Baffert
said. "They were really tough, good horses. It can be done, but it's
got to be done by a tough, fast horse."</TE>
<TE>   And that's exactly what Baffert has. War Emblem went wire to wire
in winning the Derby by four lengths over Proud Citizen, then took
the Preakness by three-quarters of a length over 45-1 shot Magic
Weisner.</TE>
<TE>   After the Preakness, some trainers said the opposition may be
subpar.</TE>
<TE>   "This year's crop isn't really super," said Nancy Alberts, the
owner-breeder-trainer of Magic Weisner. "That's why my mediocre horse
looked so good."</TE>
<TE>   So good, in fact, Magic Weisner will try again in the Belmont. So
will Proud Citizen and as many as 13 others in what could be the
largest Belmont field with a Triple Crown on the line.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer John Ward won't be sending Booklet to New York. Ward, who
trained 2001 Derby winner Monarchos, said last year he believed the
next Triple Crown winner would come from a mediocre group of
3-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to say it, but my prophecy of last year may come true,"
Ward said after Booklet ran 12th in the Preakness.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert will arrive in New York for his third Triple try in six
years. He says it's his strongest.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nobody faster than him. He just goes," said Baffert. "As
long as he stays like he is, it shouldn't be a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Baffert nearly won with Silver Charm in 1997 and Real Quiet in
1998. Both won the Derby and Preakness, but Silver Charm was beaten
three-quarters of a length by Touch Gold and Real Quiet lost by a
nose to Victory Gallop in their Belmonts.</TE>
<TE>   This will be the eighth time since 1978 that a Triple Crown is on
the line in the Belmont, and Chenery feels a breakthrough is
imminent.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be the moment," she said.</TE>

<DH>Motor racing: Sport's showcase afternoon and evening
features the Indy 500, Coca-Cola 600 and Grand Prix of Monaco.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ED HINTON</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE MOTOR SPORTS WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Down at the corner of 16th Street and Georgetown Road, just outside
the most massive grandstands on earth, the revelers are completing
their annual ritual of repaving the intersection with tens of
thousands of flattened beer cans.</LD>
<LD>   Across the Atlantic, on the Riviera, the little Heliport de Monaco
is bedlam; packed helicopters arrive by the minute, raising a
relentless spray off the surface of the Mediterranean, ferrying in
high rollers from Nice Airport across the bay. The harbor is full of
yachts. Inbound traffic is gridlocked on the mountain roads, backed
up along the French coast in one direction and to the Italian border
in the other.</LD>
<LD>   Down near the town of Concord, N.C., just north of Charlotte,
motor homes and campfires for miles in every direction are
reminiscent of enormous armies encamped on the eve of some great
battle.</LD>
<TE>   The world's biggest motor racing weekend is at hand.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the world's best drivers will be divided into three
fields--for the 86th Indianapolis 500, the 60th Grand Prix of Monaco
and the 43rd Coca-Cola 600.</TE>
<TE>   The traditions are tied to Memorial Day weekend in the United
States and Ascension Day in Europe. The race here is oldest, dating
to 1911, when the first 500-mile race on Earth was run.</TE>
<TE>   Speedway founder Carl Fisher wanted a longer race than the
100-milers he had been staging at his new track. But he had to limit
the race to seven hours so spectators could travel in daylight from
their homes to the track and back, in their carriages and primitive
automobiles.</TE>
<TE>   He reckoned the race cars of the time would average about 70 mph.
Seven hours times 70 mph equaled 490 miles, and Fisher's promotional
sense in rounding up to 500 because it sounded better is why there
are so many 500-mile races in the U.S. today.</TE>
<TE>   In that first 500, winner Ray Harroun more than made up for
Fisher's extra 10 miles, blistering the track at a race average of
more than 74 mph. (The field for today's race averaged more than 228
mph in qualifying.)</TE>
<TE>   All different, all the same</TE>
<TE>   Few folks here or at Charlotte have a clue what "banco"--the most
ice-nerved utterance in the Casino de Monte Carlo--means, let alone
the inclination to place a 100,000-franc plaque on the longshot "tie"
area of the baccarat table.</TE>
<TE>   Nor would the women in Hermes scarves, sipping Dom Perignon on
terraces overlooking the street course, care at all for a taste of
North Carolina barbecue or an Indiana corndog.</TE>
<TE>   The engine in Michael Schumacher's Ferrari alone cost more--about
$5 million--than any 10 cars in the Indy 500, or indeed, the total
value of the entire 43-car field at Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   But high technology be damned in NASCAR's realm. "All our fans
want inside a race car is a hero," Lowe's Motor Speedway President
Humpy Wheeler says.</TE>
<TE>   What they all share, from the first-turn grandstands here to
Charlotte's infield to the balconies in Monaco, is a love of motor
racing--and not necessarily pure speed.</TE>
<TE>   The Indy cars will run at more than 220 mph, the stock cars in the
180s, but the exotic Formula One cars at only about 95--but this
through narrow streets and around corners where you'd be hard-pressed
to do 15 mph in a passenger car.</TE>
<TE>   More than half a million people will attend the three. But the
best seats, by far, will be occupied by millions of TV viewers. With
one click of the channel-changer, American fans can catch all three.
ABC will telecast the 500 live, followed by Monaco on tape. Then
comes Fox, with the 600 live this afternoon, and one of racing's
great illusions comes into play--"The darker it gets, the faster they
go," is how Wheeler describes the sensation.</TE>
<TE>   Which scenario raises more goose bumps, tightens more throats,
mists more eyes?</TE>
<TE>   Is it during the final strains--"How I long ... for my
Innn-dee-ah-nah home"--when more than 300,000 voices roar in unison?</TE>
<TE>   Or is it the Carolina air trembling with the thunder of 43 huge
engines awakening, preparing for the longest journey in NASCAR,
starting in daylight, roaring through the dusk and into darkness, as
the speedway's massive lighting system intensifies?</TE>
<TE>   Or is it the grid at Monaco, sitting still, engines revving to a
siren-scream 18,000 rpm in the final seconds before the light turns
green, then shrieking away, diving into the semi-dark mile of the
tunnel, popping back out into daylight, through the little chicane,
then dashing up the incline along the sea wall, in full view of the
yachts?</TE>
<TE>   To have stood amid all three, at one time or another, is to know
that each in its way is just as magnificent as the others on this,
the grandest racing weekend of the year.</TE>

<LD>It may be easier than you think to book an affordable vacation this
year. Air fares are still lower than last year, there's a glut of
cruise ships, European travel is slightly off and Caribbean prices
are at their lowest in years.</LD>
<LD>   Among recent developments: World Explorer Cruises will cut nearly
$1,000 off its rates for selected inside cabins on an upcoming 14-day
Alaskan cruise. For the June 11 departure, the line will charge
$997.50 per person, double occupancy, for inside cabins that
regularly go for $1,995. Add required gratuities of $10 per day and a
government tax of $30.22, and you'll pay $1,168.</LD>
<LD>   The cruise will focus on Alaska's birds. On board will be Robert
Armstrong, author of "Birds of Alaska," and Steve Zimmerman,
president of Juneau's Audubon Society. A May 28 sailing will take a
more inclusive approach, with a geologist, an anthropologist, a
biologist and a historian aboard to talk about the 49th state from
their varied perspectives. Call (800) 854-3835, www.wecruise.com.</LD>
<TE>   If you're interested in relaxing on a beach, a new company called
America's Shuttle might have the answer. It has bought and
reconditioned a B727-200 plane and offers air-and-land packages to
the Caribbean and Latin America from Fort Lauderdale, Fla. (It says
it can arrange connecting flights from the West Coast.) Visitors stay
at an Allegro Resort, an all-inclusive chain that operates more than
25 hotels worldwide. Each hotel offers a number of dining options yet
never charges more for "specialty" restaurants (an invidious new
practice at some all-inclusives).</TE>
<TE>   Allegro's "Caribbean Village" hotels focus on sports vacations;
its Grand Village Playacar (near Playa del Carmen, Mexico) is in the
middle of a golf course. Prices are lowest here, $419 per week,
perhaps because it's a couple of minutes from the beach. The price
includes air fare from Fort Lauderdale, meals, drinks, activities,
airport transfers and room.</TE>
<TE>   For a resort directly on the sand, look into the Allegro Cozumel
($629 from Fort Lauderdale), a Polynesian-themed place with
grass-thatched, oversized huts. It's known for its diving
opportunities, and it has two swimming pools, three bars and a kiddie
pool. Call America's Shuttle at (800) 338-6871,
www.americasshuttle.co. These rates are in effect through June 30 and
from Sept. 6 through Dec. 19.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, travel to the Emerald Isle remains among the best
prospects today, thanks to companies like Sceptre Tours. This Ireland
specialist offers six-night fly-drive-and-stay packages throughout
the summer for $1,179 per person, including air fare from California,
six days' manual-transmission car rental and vouchers for stays at
farmhouse B&amp;Bs around Ireland. Vacationers can make up their
itineraries as they go. Call (800) 221-0924, www.sceptretours.com.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can become a member of the upper class this summer, albeit only
for the length of a flight from LAX to London. There's a summer sale
on Virgin Atlantic's "upper class" service, so you can see how the
other half lives for about half of what the other half usually pays.
Round-trip tickets usually cost about $9,000. If you purchase by Aug.
15 this year, the fare is $3,999 (excluding taxes and other fees).
For this, you get a knit sleep suit you can keep, a seat that
reclines nearly horizontal, the services of a "beauty therapist"
(massage and manicure) and a menu with a wide variety of choices.
Travel must be completed by Sept. 15. Various restrictions, including
a Saturday night stay, apply. (800) 862-8621.</LD>

<HD>Capitalizing on the Memory of Jackie Kennedy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Washington, D.C., this summer is offering a citywide celebration of
former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy.</LD>
<LD>   Through September, scores of exhibits, tours, lectures, concerts
and other events will celebrate the style and substance of the
trend-setting Kennedy.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the links are tenuous, such as the blurb for classic
Indian manuscripts at the Smithsonian's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery
("Jacqueline Kennedy found India fascinating") or whimsical (the
Topaz Bar says it's featuring "Jackie's fav champagne cocktail, with
strawberries, French champagne and Cointreau, $13"). But they add up
to a festival of big proportions.</LD>
<TE>   The main exhibit, through Sept. 30 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art,
is "Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years." It offers more than
70 original and replica costumes and accessories from the John F.
Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston, including those worn during
Kennedy's presidential inauguration.</TE>
<TE>   There are also documents on the first lady's campaign to restore
and preserve White House treasures. Museum hours are 10 a.m. to 5
p.m. daily except Tuesday. Adult tickets are $10 weekdays, $14
weekends. Advance purchase is recommended. (202) 639-1700,
www.corcoran.org.</TE>
<TE>   The Black Fashion Museum focuses on Ann Lowe, who designed
Jacqueline's wedding gown, in a show June 1 to Aug. 31. The museum is
open by appointment only; (202) 667-0744. The National Gallery of
Art, the Woodrow Wilson House, the Capital Children's Museum and the
Library of Congress are among other museums with related exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   Concerts include "Music at the White House During the Kennedy
Years" (June 30 and July 28, Pope John Paul II Cultural Center).
Tours include "Jackie Kennedy's Georgetown" (Tour DC, June 1, 22 and
23) and "Touring the Kennedy Family's Catholic Heritage" (Betsy Ross
Tours, June 19, July 17 and Aug. 21).</TE>

<TE>   Another recent addition in Washington is a tour aimed at children
and families called "The White House Un-Tour," by Washington Walks.
Although school group tours have been allowed in the White House, it
has remained mostly off-limits to the public since Sept. 11. The
hourlong "un-tour," offered Tuesday through Saturday, is billed as "a
fascinating investigation of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue from the
outside." (202) 484-1565, www.washingtonwalks.com.</TE>

<HD>Air France Adds Nonstops Between LAX and Paris</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Air France last week expanded its nonstop flights between LAX and
Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport from 10 to 17 a week. It now offers
service at least twice a day (three times a day on Tuesday, Thursday
and Saturday).</LD>
<LD>   The change is especially significant because Air France is one of
only two airlines that offer regular nonstops on the route. The other
is Air Tahiti Nui, which this month began flying the route twice a
week and will go to three times a week June 28.</LD>
<LD>   American and United used to fly nonstop L.A. to Paris. American,
which began the service in 1999, pulled it Sept. 30 after the
terrorist attacks. United, which began the service in 2000, pulled it
in early September, before the attacks, "because we didn't get the
business we wanted," a spokesman said. Both airlines fly between LAX
and Paris via other cities.</LD>

<HD>QE2 to Make Last Round of Crossings in 2003</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The venerable Queen Elizabeth 2, the world's best-known cruise ship,
will make its farewell round of transatlantic crossings next year
before Cunard's giant new Queen Mary 2, under construction in France,
takes over the route. Passage on the QE2 in 2003, starting at $1,499
per person, double occupancy, with early booking discounts, can be
reserved now.</LD>
<LD>   The QE2, launched in 1969, will make 16 six-day crossings between
New York and Southampton, England, between April 17 and Dec. 15,
2003, Cunard announced earlier this month. On Dec. 21, 2003, it will
head for the Caribbean for a 15-day Christmas sail, then embark on a
world cruise in January 2004. In April 2004 it will join the Queen
Mary 2 in a special transatlantic crossing from New York to
Southampton--its final service.</LD>
<LD>   The QE2 is expected thereafter to be in regular service on world
cruises and to the Mediterranean and other destinations, said Deborah
Natansohn, Cunard senior vice president of worldwide sales and
marketing.</LD>
<TE>   Booking for the 2004 season of the $800-million Queen Mary 2,
expected to be the biggest cruise ship afloat, will begin Aug. 1,
Natansohn said; the April 2004 crossing of the QE2, expected to be
popular with liner buffs, cannot yet be booked, she added.</TE>

<HD>River Rafters, Anglers Go With Colorado Flow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Colorado's driest winter in a century is reducing flows for river
rafters but giving anglers an early start. The snowpack this year
averaged only 27% of normal statewide, although some areas are doing
better, said Dawn Taylor, spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of
Natural Resources in Denver.</LD>
<LD>   "We won't see big water" on the Arkansas River in south-central
Colorado, one of the busiest whitewater rivers in the world,
typically drawing about 750,000 rafters a year, said Steven Hall,
Denver-based spokesman for Colorado State Parks. Although lower than
usual, flows should be good through June, he said last week. After
that, the outlook depends on whether state officials release extra
water as usual in late summer; the issue is pending.</LD>
<LD>   Outfitters such as Hank Bevington, general manager for American
Adventure Expeditions in Salida, Colo., are putting the best face on
the situation. Lower flow is better for trips by families and
novices, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Calmer water also enables anglers to wade in earlier in the
season. "It should be one of the best fly-fishing seasons we've had,"
Hall says.</TE>

<KH>Weekend Escape</KH>
<HD>Cambria's Seaside Stage</HD>
<DH>A new boardwalk provides a prime place to see the town's
natural appeal</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSEMARY McCLURE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Foot traffic on the boardwalk began to build as late afternoon
slipped into early evening. With shadows deepening and the sun
sliding quickly toward the horizon, tourists and townsfolk alike
crowded onto the bluff-top walkway, jockeying for a front-row spot
overlooking the Pacific.</LD>
<LD>   I was there with the rest of them, eagerly anticipating the Big
Show. No one was disappointed. It turned out to be a flaming crimson
number that stained the sky and the ocean blood red.</LD>
<LD>   "Well, you know, we don't have a movie theater," Chamber of
Commerce Manager Mary Ann Carson said later when I asked her why so
many people appear nightly to watch the sunset.</LD>
<TE>   Such is life in Cambria, a town of 6,500 midway between San
Francisco and Los Angeles on Highway 1. If you're looking for night
life and shopping malls, Cambria isn't your kind of place.</TE>
<TE>   Before my March visit, I wasn't sure it was my kind of place
either. It always seemed a bit precious. Too many faux Tudor
storefronts. Too many shops advertising country collectibles.</TE>
<TE>   But when an old friend from the Bay Area suggested it for a
get-together, I agreed without hesitation. Regardless of its
commercial trappings, I knew Cambria to be a place of stunning
scenery and abundant marine life. I could stay away from the shops.</TE>
<TE>   Our plan was simple. We would leave our respective homes at 9 on
Friday morning and meet for a late lunch in Cambria. Both of us would
drive about 240 miles and arrive at roughly the same time. It seemed
like a solid strategy.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't. Because I live on the far side of Los Angeles, I had to
wade through rush-hour traffic. Then I caught two Caltrans projects
on U.S. 101. The topper was an overturned van that closed the highway
near Carpinteria. My friend Marty had no such problems. She called my
cell phone from Cambria just as I was getting into Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   So we went to Plan B, agreeing to meet at our inn and then have
lunch. Marty called again with an update on Cambria. Our hotel faced
the ocean, and a boardwalk stretched for nearly a mile along the
bluffs. Spring flowers lined the walk, and there were tide pools
below. Offshore, she could hear a chatty group of sea lions barking.</TE>
<TE>   Marty would go for walk. I would keep driving and try not to be
too jealous.</TE>
<TE>   We finally sat down at the Moonstone Beach Bar and Grill in
Cambria at 4 p.m. We were ravenous. Both of us ordered Moonstone
chowder, a rich, hearty stew served in a crusty sourdough bread bowl
($9.95). The restaurant was a nice surprise. It had an eclectic menu
and an open, heated patio facing the ocean. We could smell the salt
on the air and see brown pelicans and Western gulls sailing on the
currents overhead. A crisp glass of Chardonnay helped erase the
frustration of the long drive.</TE>
<TE>   Our outdoor perch gave us a good look at our weekend home. Other
than a few gnarled Monterey cypresses, there was nothing to block the
panoramic view of the sea. We could hear the surf crashing against
the rocks.</TE>
<TE>   This stretch of coast is the southernmost part of the Monterey Bay
National Marine Sanctuary, a protected area that extends north to
Marin. People strolling along the beach or bluffs generally can count
on seeing furry-faced otters cracking shells for dinner, plump harbor
seals lolling on the rocks and giant egrets waiting patiently for
unsuspecting fish to swim into view.</TE>
<TE>   Most visitors stay at Moonstone Beach, one of three Cambria
commercial areas. East and West villages are inland and are made up
of shops, restaurants and myriad real estate offices. Moonstone Beach
Drive is a two-mile strip of inns, motels and restaurants, all on the
inland side of the highway. The motels, many built in the late '80s,
have names like FogCatcher Inn, Pelican Suites and Blue Dolphin Inn.
All received a boost during the past year when the California
Conservation Corps laid down the Douglas fir boardwalk on nearby
bluffs.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors find it so easy to watch the changing moods of the sea
that they walk the trail day and night. But the biggest gathering
occurs daily at sunset. And tourists aren't the only ones who
partake. Cambria residents turn out in force to amble along the
beach, run with their dogs or just stand in silent communion.</TE>
<TE>   We were staying at the Fireside Inn, a Best Western motel where
our large room ($149 a night, including tax) had two queen beds and a
gas fireplace and was cheerily decorated with chintz prints. Like
many of the 20 motels along Moonstone Beach, it has a pool and spa
and offers continental breakfast. I gazed longingly at Rooms 126, 127
and 128, which face the sea. Next time, I thought.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner that night took us down Moonstone Beach Drive to the Sea
Chest Oyster Bar and Seafood Restaurant. (It doesn't take
reservations or credit cards, but you can write a check.) The
restaurant, once a cottage, is decorated in what one might call
nautical funk, with odds and ends of marine hardware and knickknacks.
Thousands of yellowed business cards are attached to the ceiling. At
the oyster bar, diners can watch cooks work in an open kitchen.
Although it was convenient, I would try another place next time.
Flavor was absent from my Scallops a la Sea Chest ($19.50), described
in the menu as being sauteed with garlic and capers in wine and
butter. Marty wasn't happy with the broiled halibut ($20).</TE>
<TE>   Outside the restaurant we caught the faint smell of kelp and heard
the waves breaking. Above, the moonless sky was filled with stars.
Despite the late hour, I could see couples walking arm in arm along
the boardwalk. Not a bad way to end a day.</TE>
<TE>   Although many Cambria visitors tour Hearst Castle, six miles north
on California 1, Marty and I had been there on previous trips. So
that wasn't on the agenda Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   We weren't interested in visiting Central Coast wineries either,
although more than 30 wineries and 100 vineyards are within about an
hour's drive. We decided to take advantage of our proximity to the
sea and head north along California 1. To the left of us stretched
miles of wind-swept coastline, pocket beaches and tide pools; for the
most part, the shore was deserted. To the right were the Santa Lucia
Mountains, dotted with coast live oaks and black oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Seven miles north of Cambria we spotted a "Wildlife Viewing" sign.
Cars were lined up in a parking lot, and people were pointing and
aiming cameras. Curious, we stopped. On the sand below stretched
dozens of elephant seal pups sleeping in the midday sun. A volunteer
docent from Friends of the Elephant Seal explained that about 1,900
pups were born last winter along a four-mile length of beach here.
During breeding season in winter, bulls and females can be seen too.
The bulls weigh upward of 4,500 pounds, and the females up to 1,500
pounds. Bloody battles for dominance take place as bulls fight for
control of harems of dozens of females.</TE>
<TE>   The next stop on our tour took us to Ragged Point, 22 miles north
of Cambria. The Ragged Point Inn, a 22-room hotel, restaurant, gift
shop and garden, is perched on top of a cliff 350 feet above the
water. We poked through the gift shop, wandered around the garden and
followed a trail to the edge of the point. The view was spectacular.
All rooms are on the cliff's edge, and although we didn't peek inside
any of them, we were told the west side is solid glass.</TE>
<TE>   We worked our way north again, then returned to Cambria for a late
lunch at Robin's in East Village. Set in a converted home, Robin's is
surrounded by a well-tended garden and has a patio covered with lush
trumpet vine. Urns of flowers and vines are painted on the walls in
the house. Salads are a specialty, so I chose a sampler ($9.95) that
included spicy Sichuan chicken with angel hair pasta, and snap peas
with fresh mozzarella and Kalamata olives. Both were delicious.</TE>
<TE>   Robin's is on Burton Drive, a two-block strip that changed my view
about Cambria's shops. Next door to the restaurant was a shop and
garden, complete with theme areas: kids' garden, butterfly garden,
culinary garden. Called Heart's Ease Herb Shop and Gardens, it was in
a converted home too. Bouquets of dried flowers--larkspurs, lamb's
ears, strawflowers--hung from the ceiling. One room was devoted to
garden books, and another was dominated by 19th century New England
crocks filled with potpourris.</TE>
<TE>   We found other interesting stores along Burton: a wine specialty
shop called Fermentations, and two gift shops, Burton Forge and the
Shop Next Door at the Squibb House B&amp;B. Brambles Dinner House,
Cambria's best-known restaurant (where entrees run $17.50 to $26.50),
is also here.</TE>
<TE>   With the sun fading, we hurried back to Moonstone Beach. We
stopped at Leffingwell Landing, a viewpoint near the end of Moonstone
Beach Drive. This time no clouds were in the sky, so the rich colors
didn't appear. But there were otters and seals, and gulls circling
overhead. And a ruddy color in the sky and water. It wasn't the best
sunset I've seen. But as the chamber manager had hinted, it was
better than a movie.</TE>

<LD>If history repeats, most U.S. vacationers will visit a beach this
summer. "About 80% of U.S. summer travelers plan to go to a beach at
least once during their trip," says Cathy Keefe, a spokesperson for
the Travel Industry Assn. of America, a trade group. She bases the
figure on last year's annual survey, for which the association polled
more than 1,000 respondents.</LD>
<LD>   As some of the travelers will discover, not all beaches are
created equal. But it might soon get easier to find the beach of your
dreams, thanks to a "beach certification" program just launched by
the Laboratory for Coastal Research at Florida International
University in Miami. Seventeen beaches--all in Hawaii or
Florida--meet the certification standards and are listed at
www.drbeach.org.</LD>
<LD>   The program, an outgrowth of the annual Top 10 Beaches program
begun by Stephen Leatherman, the laboratory's director, requires
beaches to pass an annual 50-point evaluation of their health and
environmental quality, says Carolyn Walker, the laboratory's
coordinator for research programs. Leatherman visits each beach and
grades it on sand and water quality, sand color, amount of debris and
other factors; data from the EPA and other organizations, such as the
Surfrider Foundation (www.surfrider.org), are also used to evaluate
water quality. There are about 650 public recreational beaches in the
U.S., Walker says.</LD>
<TE>   Beaches that pass pay an annual $500 fee to cover testing costs,
and they agree to notify the lab if they are closed for any reason.
They must also comply with the program's standards. "Say a week
[after certification] a dump truck overturns on the beach," Walker
says. Beach officials must agree to clean up the debris promptly.</TE>
<TE>   The Web site also lists the top 10 beaches for 2001. So far, no
California beaches are certified, and none made last year's top10.</TE>
<TE>   Seizures in the Sky</TE>
<TE>   Heart attacks aloft get all the press. But neurological problems,
including dizziness and seizures, are actually the most common
medical complaints that require air-to-ground medical support, in
which airline officials call for medical help, according to a Mayo
Clinic researcher who presented his findings last month at the
American Academy of Neurology meeting in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Joseph Sirven, an assistant professor of neurology at Mayo
Medical School in Rochester, Minn., and a staff neurologist at the
Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz., and his colleagues analyzed the
medical air-to-ground consultations of a major airline that flies 10%
of all U.S. passengers. From 1995 to 2000, 2,042 medical incidents
occurred, and 592--nearly one-fifth--were for neurological symptoms.
During the five-year period there were 83 diversions for neurological
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Dizziness and seizures were the most common reasons for
diversions, Sirven says. The annual cost of emergency landings for
neurological complaints, not including ground ambulance and hospital
costs, is $9 million. The study results will be published in an
upcoming issue of the journal Neurology.</TE>
<TE>   Sirven, who became interested in the topic after assisting a
passenger who suffered a seizure on a flight from Phoenix to
Minneapolis, says the study results were sent to the Federal Aviation
Administration, along with a recommendation for major airlines to
stock anti-epileptic drugs on board.</TE>
<TE>   To minimize the chance of neurological problems aloft, Sirven says
passengers should avoid alcohol during the flight, be well rested on
departure and reduce stress as much as possible. Those who have been
diagnosed with epilepsy should always carry their anti-seizure
medications on board, he says. But he notes that some of the
passengers in the study were not aware of their epilepsy; their first
seizure occurred aloft.</TE>
<TE>   Adventure Trip? Ask About Medical Care Before You Embark</TE>
<TE>   If you're planning an adventure trip, especially one that involves
climbing to high altitudes, ask about the medical risks and what
provisions have been made to handle medical emergencies, says a
British emergency medical specialist.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter published recently in the British Medical Journal,
Fiona Bellis reports that she was called on twice in the past year to
treat other members of a group adventure tour who had moderate to
severe mountain sickness, associated with altitude. In both cases,
she says, the tour leader had exceeded the recommended rate of
ascent. She writes that "some companies provide their own medically
trained staff, but they may rely on doctors on holiday with the group
to provide help."</TE>
<TE>   Still Wary of Flying? You're Not Alone</TE>
<TE>   Many Americans are still concerned about airplane safety in the
wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, according to a survey released earlier
this month by the University of Michigan Institute for Social
Research. When 613 adults were surveyed in March, 69% said they were
more concerned about their safety than they previously were when
flying. By comparison, 37% said they were more concerned than before
about going to a sporting event, and 22% were now warier about
shopping malls.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Yosemite National Park's magnificent back country is quite
accessible, at least by Sierra standards, with well-marked trails
leading to wildflower-festooned alpine meadows and lovely lakes.</LD>
<LD>   Were Lukens Lake not surrounded by Yosemite's other spectacular
landmarks, it would surely be appreciated more. At first glance, it
seems to be only a lake bordered by a red fir forest and a lovely
meadow. But did I mention the opportunities for picnicking, swimming
and trout fishing?</LD>
<LD>   Nearby May Lake, at the geographical center of the park, is also
picturesque. The walk to the water is short in distance but long on
views: 10,940-foot Cathedral Peak, 9,926-foot Clouds Rest, Half Dome
and Mt. Hoffmann, which appears to thrust right out of the lake.</LD>
<TE>   Lukens Lake</TE>
<TE>   Two family-friendly trails lead to Lukens. Keep in mind that the
lake gets its fair share of snow, which can linger into late spring
and early summer.</TE>
<TE>   If you hike here early in the season, don't be surprised if you
see snow patches along the trail and find the meadow underwater.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the shorter trail: From the Big Oak Flat Entrance on
the west side of the park, follow Big Oak Flat Road to Tioga Road
(California 120). Drive 17 miles northeast on Tioga Road to a turnout
on the right and park.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: Carefully cross Tioga Road and pick up the signed trail
to Lukens Lake. After a mellow half-mile ascent over a pine-forested
ridge, the path makes a one-third-mile descent to a meadow on the
lake's south end. The trail bends east and north around the lake.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the longer trail: Follow the directions above, but
after 15 miles on Tioga Road, take the turnoff for White Wolf
Campground. The hike starts across from White Wolf Lodge.</TE>
<TE>   Join the signed trail and meander three-quarters of a mile through
a lodgepole pine forest. Shortly after crossing the Middle Fork of
the Tuolumne River on logs, you will intersect a trail that leads
left, to the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne River.</TE>
<TE>   Your route is southeast, through mellow, sometimes soggy and
mosquito-filled meadows to a junction with Ten Lakes Trail.</TE>
<TE>   Here you fork right, cross the Tuolumne River and climb a quarter
of a mile to the lake.</TE>
<TE>   May Lake</TE>
<TE>   The path to May Lake, just east of Lukens, is easy. Experienced
hikers can continue farther, making the difficult climb to the top of
10,850-foot Mt. Hoffmann on a sketchy trail that rises 1,500 feet in
two miles.</TE>
<TE>   May Lake entices anglers in search of rainbow and brook trout. By
the lake is one of Yosemite's High Sierra Camps, which offer tent
cabins and meals. These camps are spaced a day's hike apart on a loop
of about 50 miles around Tuolumne Meadows and are usually reserved
well in advance. (A traditional campsite is on the lake's south
shore.)</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head:  From the Lukens Lake area, follow
Tioga Road a few miles east to the turnoff for May Lake. Drive north
13/4 miles to the parking area at the end of the road.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: The trail passes through a forest of lodgepole pine and
red fir that soon thins as the route climbs into rockier terrain.
Half a mile out, enjoy the views of Half Dome and Cathedral Peak.</TE>
<TE>   The trail divides at May Lake: High Sierra Camp to the right, the
backpacker camp to the left. Walk all the way around the lake if you
like.</TE>

<HD>Outlying Airports' Fates Tell a Tale of Two Cities</HD>
<DH>Ontario is trying to woo more airlines, while Long Beach is
turning them away. But both are worthy alternatives to LAX.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you build it, they won't come. If they come, you had better build
it.</LD>
<LD>   Such are the paradoxes in a tale of two airports, the first a
vast, vaulting monument to modern aviation east of Los Angeles, the
second a humble, World War II-vintage terminal to the south. While
the first, Ontario International Airport, hopes for new airline
suitors, the second, Long Beach Airport, has more than it can
entertain.</LD>
<LD>   Their contrasting fates reveal much about Southern Californians
desperate to dodge crowded, increasingly costly LAX in the post- 9/11
world. Yes, we want shorter security lines, cheaper parking and fewer
hassles getting from car to gate. But we are willing to go only so
far and pay only so much for these advantages.</LD>
<TE>   In that equation, Long Beach is beating Ontario, but both are
worthy alternatives to LAX, in addition to the better-known
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport and Orange County's John Wayne
International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Let's start with the benefits of both.</TE>
<TE>   I thought my cell phone was malfunctioning when I pulled up to
Ontario airport earlier this month, dialed spokesman Dennis Watson
and was told to park in Lot F, where "the first three hours are
free."</TE>
<TE>   Free?</TE>
<TE>   After three hours, rates at the outdoor lot, a 10-minute shuttle
ride from the terminals, start at 50 cents a half-hour, to a maximum
of $6 per day. Parking within walking distance of the terminals is $9
to $24 a day--still less than LAX, where rates are $30 a day for
central terminal parking and $8 to $10 at remote lots (where the
first two hours are free).</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach does Ontario one better: You can't pay more than $6 a
day for parking, even at the garage across the street from the
terminal. The "remote" lot, two blocks away, is $3 a day (or $35 less
a week than LAX's cheapest lot).</TE>
<TE>   Smaller crowds and fewer cars are other benefits of both airports.
Ontario served 6.7 million passengers last year, about 10% of what
LAX served, and Long Beach served just 587,473. Ontario has two
terminals and Long Beach one, compared with LAX's eight.</TE>
<TE>   As for security hassles, "we never had the two-hour, three-hour
lines for screening" reported at larger airports, says Sharon
Diggs-Jackson, a spokeswoman for Long Beach Airport. The Ontario
airport evacuated terminals fewer than five times for security
problems between Sept. 11 and mid-May, says chief of airport police
John W. Bangs III, compared with more than 40 evacuations reported at
LAX.</TE>
<TE>   But there the similarities between the Ontario and Long Beach
airports end.</TE>
<TE>   At Long Beach, facilities are expanding at a madcap rate while
JetBlue, American Airlines and Alaska Airlines squabble over who gets
the 41 slots (daily departures) the airport is limited to under
noise-abatement agreements. Meanwhile, Ontario's gleaming twin
terminals, erected in 1998, were designed to serve up to 12 million
passengers a year. Many of the 17 shops and restaurants were closed
at midday, I noticed during a recent weekday tour.</TE>
<TE>   The difference in growth of business at the two airports has to do
with wealth, distance and fares, I'm told.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines value affluent travelers and corporate frequent fliers
who pay top dollar for their first- and business-class seats--and
those customers are found closer to the coast, or so the airlines
believe, says Watson, the Ontario airport spokesman. "We're not the
same demographic as Newport Beach, Westwood or Costa Mesa," he says
of the Inland Empire, from which the airport draws much of its
business. By contrast, Long Beach sits strategically near the coast
between Los Angeles and wealthier Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Although it took me 45 minutes to drive to each of the airports
from downtown Los Angeles in light freeway traffic, I logged 271/2
miles to Long Beach versus 41 miles to Ontario. Even Bangs, the
Ontario airport police chief, says "after 3 p.m., forget it" if you
need to drive from L.A. to Ontario on a weekday.</TE>
<TE>   Fares out of Ontario are usually higher, sometimes a lot higher,
than out of LAX or other airports in the region, say spokesman Watson
and Ontario travel agent Debbie Graham, who heads a 39-year-old
nonprofit group of supporters called Friends of Ontario International
Airport. It's a sore point with airport boosters. Watson says some
airlines seem to regard Ontario as a "premium" airport--that is, the
airlines charge extra for the convenience of catching flights near
home.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Ontario, with passenger traffic down about 7% through March
compared with the same period last year, has weathered the post-9/11
slump in air travel better than LAX, down 16.3%. The airport wins
kudos for its easy layout and airy design.</TE>
<TE>   Passenger traffic at Long Beach soared 42% through March versus
last year, lifted by the addition of JetBlue in August. Now flying
five daily flights, to JFK and Dulles airport in suburban Washington,
the popular low-fare carrier plans to add 22 more daily flights by
the end of October. The airport recently rejected requests for
additional slots by American Airlines for nonstops to Chicago and JFK
beginning June 15 and new slots by Alaska Airlines for nonstops to
Seattle beginning Sept. 9. Claiming those slots were promised to
JetBlue, the airport granted the two airlines temporary slots. The
issue was under appeal as of last week.</TE>
<TE>   To keep up with the pace, Long Beach last month hastily added a
rental car facility and 8,640 square feet of terminal space in
modular units next to the main building. In July it plans to break
ground on a 12,000-square-foot addition with three new baggage-claim
carousels, expanded security screening and concessions.</TE>
<TE>   As for prices, JetBlue has a reputation for undercutting the
competition on its coast-to-coast routes. For other destinations,
such as Phoenix, via America West, and Dallas-Fort Worth, on
American, spokeswoman Diggs-Jackson thinks her airport's fares are
"very competitive" with LAX or maybe $20 to $30 more, depending on
the flow of specials and promotions.</TE>
<TE>   Business traveler Terry Hirsch, who flies into Southern California
every four to six weeks from Dallas-Fort Worth, tells me she finds
better fares to Long Beach than to LAX or John Wayne.</TE>
<TE>   I asked Hirsch what it would take to make her put up with the
frustrations of LAX. She laughed and said, "The flight would have to
be almost free."</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't go that far. LAX still offers the most flight choices
and, for Los Angeles residents, close-in convenience.</TE>
<TE>   But after touring the charmingly retro Long Beach terminal and the
bright, elegant Ontario airport--the most spotless I have ever
seen--I would be willing to give either a try.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Your article on the beach inns of Santa Barbara ("Steps From the
Sand," May 5) reminded us of how much we miss the Miramar, the
old-fashioned family resort where we took our children for half a
dozen vacations.</LD>
<LD>   We bought club sandwiches in the train car diner and took them to
the beach for picnic lunches, bodysurfed, passed endless afternoons
reading or building sandcastles and leaped to our feet when dolphins
appeared offshore.</LD>
<LD>   We sensed it was the beginning of the end of an era when we
returned one year and found the floating dock gone. Some years later,
Jacques, the perennially sunbaked and craggy-faced Frenchman who sat
next to a handwritten sign renting out mismatched chairs and old
umbrellas, died.</LD>
<TE>   When we called the following year, the Miramar was closed. The
hotel we knew is gone forever, but our children still have the
pennies flattened by the rail cars that roared through the property
throughout the day. The sound of a late-night train whistle always
brought a smile: It meant we were back at the Miramar.</TE>

<LD>Regarding the article on cruise ships' new systems of food service
("Cruise Dining Options," May 12), we found one annoying issue. As
stated in the article, some ships automatically add gratuities to the
passengers' bill for the waiters, cabin stewards etc.</LD>
<LD>   But on the last night of our Princess cruise, the purser still put
out envelopes, and we felt the crew was looking for their envelopes.
There should be envelopes or no envelopes but not this unclear
situation.</LD>

<HD>Beating Travel Insomnia</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I have never had a sleepless night while traveling, and I have been
traveling for more than 35 years ("Are You an Itinerant Insomniac?
Take Comfort: Many Share Your Pain," Her World, May 19). Decades ago
I developed a foolproof method for avoiding jet lag:</LD>
<LD>   * Minimize the alcohol and caffeine you consume on the plane.</LD>
<LD>   * When you arrive, set your watch to local time and forget what
time it is at home. Act as if you have always been on the local time.</LD>
<TE>   * When you get to your hotel, darken the room if you have arrived
during daylight hours, and get just enough sleep to function for the
rest of the day--never more than three hours. (If you have arrived at
night, skip this step.) Take no caffeine, and take it easy the rest
of the day.</TE>
<TE>   * Go to bed at whatever hour your regular bedtime will be for the
rest of your trip. Set your alarm to get up in time for breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   * Eat three meals a day. If you want to eat a spicy or rich meal,
make it your midday meal. Eating a heavy and/or spicy meal at night
will guarantee insomnia. Make your evening meal light.</TE>
<TE>   * Keep active during the day, and do as much walking as you can.
You want to be exhausted by the end of the day.</TE>
<TE>   * Maintain this routine throughout your trip.</TE>

<LD>I grew up in Hot Springs and live there now. In her story ("Southern
Comforts," March 31), author Shermakaye Bass said she giggled as she
passed the Howard Johnson's motel with the mural of Jesus. That's
exactly what I thought as I was growing up. But in fact, the Jesus
mural is attached to the church next door to the motel. I didn't
realize that, though, until college.</LD>

<HD>Southern Sanctuary</HD>
<DH>Off the Georgia coast, tiny Sapelo Island is an isolated
refuge of marine life, wild tidal marshes and a unique culture that
is struggling to keep its African traditions alive</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL CLARK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAPELO ISLAND, Ga.</DL>
<LD>From the front porch of the Wallow Lodge we looked out on a manicured
lawn edged by wild tidal marsh. Turkey vultures wheeled in the summer
twilight, and an owl hooted softly. The only other sounds were the
high-pitched drone of mosquitoes and the occasional thump-thump-thump
of a dog's tail on the wood-plank porch.</LD>
<LD>   Whiffs of salt and decay blended with the fragrance of fresh-mowed
grass as the shadows deepened around us. It was our first evening in
Hog Hammock. The sleepy community of tin-roofed bungalows on the
south end of Sapelo Island is one of the last enclaves of the
Gullah-Geechee people--slave descendants who have kept African
traditions alive. This unique black culture is found in tiny
tidewater communities scattered among the Sea Islands, a chain of
barrier islands hugging the coast from South Carolina to northern
Florida. The best known of the Sea Islands may be the resort
destination of Hilton Head, S.C. But the chain includes other
undeveloped and more difficult-to-reach hideaways visited by people
willing to leave the beaten track to glimpse an endangered wood stork
or to fish from a deserted beach.</LD>
<LD>   Sapelo Island, eight miles off the Atlantic Coast, is one of the
least accessible of these islands, which made it even more alluring
to me.</LD>
<TE>   I first heard about it from fellow travelers while I was exploring
the wild beauty of nearby Cumberland Island, which entered the
national spotlight when John F. Kennedy Jr. chose it as the setting
for his wedding to Carolyn Bessette.</TE>
<TE>   My curiosity was aroused by the descriptions of a disappearing way
of life on Sapelo, a place steeped in African lore as well as
American history. Known as Gullah in South Carolina but called
Geechee in Georgia, these people are descendants of slaves who were
brought to the Sea Islands by plantation owners during the 18th and
19th centuries. They have preserved so many of their African
traditions that they may be the nation's most "authentic" African
American community.</TE>
<TE>   Access to the island is tightly controlled. Visitors must join a
state-sponsored half-day tour or have a reservation at one of the
family-run lodgings in Hog Hammock in order to visit. My boyfriend,
Don, and I booked two nights at the Wallow Lodge last August.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as we sat on the porch, we could hear the rumble of an aging
Chevy Blazer on the sand road, signaling that our hosts were coming
home. Julius Bailey had left the island earlier in the day, taking
the 30-minute passenger-ferry ride to the landing at Meridian, Ga.,
then getting in the second vehicle he keeps on the mainland and
traveling 60 miles north to the airport in Savannah to fetch his
wife, Cornelia, the unofficial ambassador and storyteller of Sapelo
Island. She had gone to Martha's Vineyard, Mass., to lecture on
Gullah-Geechee culture.</TE>
<TE>   The thump of the dog's tail picked up its pace as the couple got
out of the Chevy.</TE>
<TE>   "Ooman! Get off that porch and leave those people alone!" Julian
scolded the scruffy black Labrador. I told Julius that the dog, whose
name comes from the Gullah word for woman, was not bothering us--we
enjoyed her laid-back company.</TE>
<TE>   We exchanged introductions with Cornelia. A substantial woman who
carries herself with confidence, she looked formidable despite a hint
of road weariness. "Are ya'll comfortable?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   We assured her we were and complimented her on the six-room lodge.
We occupied the "Seven Sisters" room, named for the daughters of
Bilali, a West African Muslim brought to Sapelo Island around 1802 to
toil in the sugar cane, rice and cotton fields and the earliest of
Cornelia Bailey's ancestors whom she can name. Rose-printed wallpaper
and a wardrobe topped with the kind of hats my grandmother used to
wear to church gave the room a homey feel.</TE>
<TE>   "Everywhere I went, people were always asking me if there was a
place they could stay in Hog Hammock, so I got the idea for this
lodge," Cornelia said. "But I tell everyone, 'If you don't enjoy
nature and history, please don't come.' People hear 'island' and they
conjure up a resort atmosphere, with bikini-clad people on beaches
and shops, restaurants and so forth. Sapelo is different."</TE>
<TE>   That was an understatement. Most of Sapelo Island, outside of
approximately 400 acres that make up Hog Hammock, is owned by the
state of Georgia, which maintains it as a wildlife refuge and a
center for marine research. The island's deserted beaches, maritime
forests and salt marshes are sprinkled with historic relics. Guale
Indians, Spanish missionaries, English pirates and French noblemen
fleeing the revolution all occupied Sapelo before it became one of
the South's most productive antebellum plantations.</TE>
<TE>   The island has no restaurants and only one small store, B.J.
Confectionary, which keeps irregular hours. Hog Hammock resident Lulu
Walker will prepare the regional seafood specialty--a spicy stew
known as a low-country boil--for visitors. Unfortunately, Lulu wasn't
available. Nancy Banks also prepares home-cooked meals, but her table
was full that evening with a fishing party.</TE>
<TE>   Don and I wound up in the communal kitchen of the Wallow Lodge
with the other guests--two schoolteachers from Atlanta--sharing the
spaghetti and wine we had brought and trading local gossip.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest news was that a coffin had come over on the ferry that
day. A 95-year-old Sapelo native had died in a hospital on the
mainland and was returning for burial, the latest loss to the
shrinking Gullah-Geechee population.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, their isolation on the Sea Islands afforded the
Gullah-Geechee the luxury of retaining many of the crafts, beliefs
and social customs of West Africa, the origin of most of their
ancestors. They also retained a lilting way of speech peppered with
West African words, the same dialect spoken by Uncle Remus in Joel
Chandler Harris' Bre'r Rabbit tales. In his 1972 autobiographical
book "The Water Is Wide," author Pat Conroy recounted his yearlong
experience teaching Gullah-Geechee children in South Carolina. The
book was made into the 1974 movie "Conrack" with Jon Voight.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the development of resorts and gated communities
on the Sea Islands has squeezed out much of the Gullah-Geechee
population.</TE>
<TE>   Congress mandated the National Park Service in 1999 to study the
Gullah-Geechee and determine whether the Park Service should play a
role in preserving their culture. The study results are due by
December.</TE>
<TE>   While Sapelo Island does not have resorts to contend with, its
Gullah-Geechee population has not escaped the march of time. The
island had about 400 African American residents in 1950, spread over
several settlements. But many have left in search of jobs, and today
only 63 remain, all living in Hog Hammock. They are the only
residents of Sapelo, aside from a handful of state workers and
researchers.</TE>
<TE>   The few children left in Hog Hammock are increasingly influenced
by the outside world. They grow up watching television and must take
the ferry to the mainland to attend school. Meanwhile, the oldest
practitioners of Gullah-Geechee crafts, such as weaving West
African-style baskets from sweetwater grass, are dying off.</TE>
<TE>   The bookshelf in the lodge's common room held a dogeared copy of
"God, Dr. Buzzard and the Bolito Man," Cornelia Bailey's memoir about
growing up on Sapelo. She describes a childhood devoid of material
goods but rich with the bounty of the marsh and ocean and infused
with the power of "root" magic brought from Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "Our customs and traditions started fading in the mid-1950s when
the outside world began crashing in," writes Bailey, who was born in
1945.</TE>
<TE>   Late that evening we followed the faint sound of rhythm and blues
to a small shed on the grounds of the Wallow Lodge. A sign told us
that we were entering the Trough, "Sapelo's Only Bar: Cold Beer,
Music, Good Times." Inside, Al Green music blared on a stereo in a
tiny room with dim fluorescent lighting and plywood walls. Julius
stood behind a counter where a handful of locals, all men, sat
drinking beer. Julius plunked a couple of Heinekens down in front of
us, and one of the locals drew a chair up to our table. It was
Stanley Walker, Cornelia Bailey's oldest son and something of a
storyteller himself. He told us how he had left the island briefly
for the excitement of Chicago, before returning with his wife and
children to Hog Hammock, where he earns money giving tours.</TE>
<TE>   I asked him what his boyhood was like on the steamy, bug-infested
island, where electricity was not available to everyone until the
late 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "The heat and the bugs don't bother me," Stanley said. "My
grandfather used to tell me, when I'd be working outside and
mosquitoes were biting me, 'Just brush 'em off and get on with
things. Don't let 'em run your life.'"</TE>
<TE>   The conversation turned to President Jimmy Carter's visit to
Sapelo Island in 1979. The locals feted him with an oyster roast.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a normal day around here," Stanley said. "He's a
regular guy. He has calluses on his hands like any other peanut
farmer."</TE>
<TE>   Stanley attempted to teach us a bit of the Gullah-Geechee dialect.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you guess what a landu is?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   I asked him to use it in a sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "The landu lay in the sun all day."</TE>
<TE>   "Is it a tourist?" I asked. He shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "What does it wear?"</TE>
<TE>   "Leather, a very expensive type of leather."</TE>
<TE>   "What does it eat?"</TE>
<TE>   "Just about anything."</TE>
<TE>   "What does it do when it rains?"</TE>
<TE>   "It goes underwater to keep from getting wet."</TE>
<TE>   Finally I got it--an alligator. I found the word later in a
dictionary of terms from West Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The following morning we woke to the soft blue of a cloudless sky.</TE>
<TE>   People were already milling around St. Luke's Baptist Church. All
of Hog Hammock was wrapped up in preparations for the funeral.</TE>
<TE>   Ooman, however, was available. The dog happily accompanied us as
we hopped on a couple of the Wallow's bicycles.</TE>
<TE>   Sapelo--about 10 miles long and four miles across at its widest
point--has only one main paved road. This deserted strip of blacktop,
given the lofty moniker of Autobahn after the German superhighway,
cuts straight through the dense woodland of cypress, live oak and saw
palmetto. White ibis swooped through the treetops, and deer moved
gracefully through the shadowy thicket below as we pedaled down the
asphalt. Ooman was content to cavort with the occasional marsh hare
or armadillo until she spotted a wild boar, which quickly crashed
into the underbrush with the dog in hot pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   We followed the Autobahn to the island's south end, where Thomas
Spalding, who established a plantation on Sapelo in the early 1800s,
built a mansion of tabby--the local word for the mixture of oyster
shells, sand and lime that was a primary building material for many
of the island's early structures. The house fell into ruin after the
Civil War, but Hudson Motors executive Howard Coffin, who bought
Sapelo in 1912, built another mansion atop the original foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The mansion and most of the rest of the island passed into the
hands of tobacco heir R.J. Reynolds in 1934. He turned over the
estate's outbuildings to researchers. The renovated sugar mill and
dairy barn now are headquarters for the University of Georgia Marine
Institute and the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Today the state of Georgia rents the 13-room Reynolds Mansion to
groups of up to 29 people. A uniformed staff serves meals to the
guests in the formal dining room, where presidents Calvin Coolidge,
Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter once dined.</TE>
<TE>   We pedaled north to Cabretta Beach, a wild and desolate stretch of
sand backed by wind-sculpted dunes bristling with sea oats. After a
lazy afternoon of gathering shells and watching the locals fish in
the surf, we left the beach and headed for the uninhabited north end.
The muddy track led us alongside drainage canals dug by slaves 200
years ago. We rode in silence past bogs where the eyes and snouts of
small alligators floated just above the water line.</TE>
<TE>   In Raccoon Bluff, an abandoned Gullah-Geechee settlement at the
northernmost tip of the island, just one building remains: the First
African Baptist Church. Although the area surrounding the church is
now deserted, Hog Hammock residents view the tin-roofed, Gothic
Revival building as an important symbol of their history, and they
recently helped restore it for use on special occasions.</TE>
<TE>   We entered the empty sanctuary and sat on a carved wooden pew. The
original church was established in 1866--a year after the Civil War
ended--but a hurricane destroyed it in 1898. The congregation rebuilt
it in 1900. The church services incorporated remnants of the Muslim
faith of some of the West African slaves, along with African, Native
American and Southern Baptist traditions, according to a pamphlet we
found. "As with other Gullah-Geechee communities," the pamphlet went
on, "one form of worship was the 'shout,' combining rhythmic music,
vocalization and movement."</TE>
<TE>   We left the church and headed back toward the south end. The sun
was melting into the horizon as we pedaled past the island's
airfield, where Charles Lindbergh landed his plane for a 1929 visit.</TE>
<TE>   Our last stop was Behavior Cemetery. The scattered headstones
stuck out at odd angles. The cemetery dates to slave times, but is
still used. We did not pass through the iron gate. According to local
tradition, the spirits must grant permission to anyone who wants to
enter. Instead, we biked down the sandy trail leading back to Hog
Hammock. Invisible spider webs brushed our faces. Branches clawed our
sides. We pedaled faster and faster, eager to get back to the world
of electricity and front-porch chatter as the night closed in.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: "It was an incredible journey at a time when few
Americans were willing to travel, and we felt like we had these vast
parks to ourselves," says Los Angeles reader Brett J. Love, who took
this photo of Kenya's wide-open Masai Mara reserve three months after
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He and his wife, Laura, spent their
honeymoon touring seven African parks.  They spied big cats in the
Serengeti of Tanzania, toured nearby Ngorongoro Crater and fell in
love with the image of the acacia tree, above, which dominates the
landscape. In many places they also encountered tourist-dependent
locals pleading with them, "Tell your American friends to come. It is
safe here."</CP>

<HD>Ah, Those Travel-Writer Perks--Let's Start With Paranoia
and Secretiveness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>See the world for free. That's what many people think travel writing
is about. Flash a business card with "travel writer" printed on it
and the candy shop opens, miraculous upgrades occur, champagne
appears at your door, guides show you places and things other
tourists don't get to see.</LD>
<LD>   But as a matter of ethics, many magazines and newspapers,
including this one, don't allow writers to accept freebies. The
company pays expenses for staff writers like me so they are beholden
to no one. That makes my position enviable because I need not rely on
the largess of people in the travel industry.</LD>
<LD>   The "no comps, no discounts" rule has an even less understood
corollary: the necessity of traveling anonymously. After all, what
good does it do to reject freebies or discounts if you tell those in
charge you're writing for a newspaper or magazine?</LD>
<TE>   When I'm on the road, I want to find out how the average tourist
is treated and greeted at hotels, restaurants, tour desks and airline
ticket counters. So I do my best to keep my name and agenda secret,
which, over the years, has yielded significant discoveries, put me in
touchy situations, given me reasons to laugh (mostly at myself) and
made me wonder whether I'm paranoid.</TE>
<TE>   I get nervous when people are too nice to me in my travels. Could
they know what I'm up to? I suspected as much from the minute I
arrived earlier this spring at the Lodge at Torrey Pines in La Jolla
to report on the lavish new hotel. The welcoming smiles of the
bellboys were too broad. The doorman told me my black convertible
suited me. And when I got to my room, I discovered I had received an
upgrade. Later, the owner of the lodge told me I'd been mistaken for
a local mover and shaker with a name similar to mine. It was a good
story, but I'm still not sure I believe it.</TE>
<TE>   Going through immigration at an airport in Morocco several years
ago, I dropped my passport. The woman behind me picked it up,
recognized my name and started questioning me about my job as a
travel writer. I cut the conversation short, however, because I
didn't want the official at the immigration desk to find out I was a
travel writer. You never know when or whether it might matter.</TE>
<TE>   At museums and tourist sites in foreign countries, attendants have
stopped me from taking notes (and don't even get me started on how
people can be when I take pictures). After writing about my travels
in China some years ago, I got a letter from a Chinese tourism
official telling me the next time I visited his country, I should let
him know. Maybe it's my imagination, but it sounded more like
chastisement than an invitation to tea in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps I'm hypersensitive, but I've been burned. About five years
ago I went to northern England's lovely Lake District to research a
story about a walking tour that offered accommodations in farmers'
barns. I will never forget that trip, the roll of the hills, the
smell of heather and the incredible helpfulness of a Lake District
National Park Authority staff member in the town of Keswick. He
plotted my three-day walk, stowed my extra baggage behind his desk
and took me for a tot of scotch at a pub.</TE>
<TE>   Only later did I learn that a photographer for the newspaper that
employed me at the time had gone there before me and made it clear
the writer was on her way.</TE>
<TE>   With far more amusement, I remember times I've been treated
shabbily at hotels and on tours and cruises. I want to tell sour
clerks and guides to get a grip because their behavior will be noted.</TE>
<TE>   At a little Hudson River hotel in New York I once asked about
getting a AAA discount. The clerk told me snippily that few small
hotels participate in the AAA discount program. Having logged
thousands of miles that year and having stayed in dozens of hotels, I
had to bite my tongue to keep from putting him in his place.</TE>
<TE>   On a Baltic cruise several years ago, I did everything I could to
keep my identity secret, though I stood out like a water buffalo
among the well-heeled couples on board. Crew members kept asking what
I was doing there; I responded by making jokes and obfuscating. On
the last night, I was invited to dinner with the captain and his top
officers. I felt so bad about my deception that I finally just told
them the truth, since I had already experienced all the ship had to
offer.</TE>
<TE>   I don't mind being sneaky with people in the travel industry, but
I haven't perfectly sorted out how to deal with my fellow travelers,
who often figure prominently in my stories. On an Earthwatch
Institute trip to Costa Rica, yoga retreats in Montana and Utah, a
small-ship cruise through Alaska's Glacier Bay National Park and a
Grand Canyon Institute backpacking trip, I didn't say I was a travel
writer on assignment. But people are friendly and curious, so by the
end of these trips it came out, which thrilled some but made others
distinctly standoffish.</TE>
<TE>   When I need more information than I've been able to ferret out on
my own, I sometimes willingly reveal myself at the end of a stay at,
say, a hotel. By that time it's too late for the management to make
me change my mind, even if I suddenly start getting turn-down service
and slightly tardy welcome fruit baskets. And making it known I'm a
travel writer rarely affects the way I'm treated at national parks
and not-for-profit museums.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, I'm utterly charmed when the people to whom I eventually
reveal myself don't care. On the Greek island of Rhodes about 10
years ago, I wanted to see rooms at a hotel where I couldn't stay. So
I told the clerk I was a travel columnist for the New York Times,
which I was at the time. But he wasn't impressed. He'd never heard of
it.</TE>
<TE>   To me, that's pure entertainment, a free perk of anonymous travel
writing that I never expected.</TE>

<LD>Even those who wish for an uneventful summer may eventually succumb
to boredom. In every one of these United States, planners have been
working on things to do in warm weather. We list just a few because
they struck our fancy or because a planner or two claimed there would
be national disappointment if they were left out.</LD>
<LD>   Keep in mind that sometimes it rains on parades--and food fests
and tractor pulls. Dates and times change; events get canceled.
That's what the phone numbers and Web sites are for. Call ahead.</LD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Everything is different since 9/11," says James Moll, the
writer-director of "Price for Peace," an NBC documentary about the
men who served in the Pacific during World War II. Which may be why
there seems to be so much Memorial Day-related programming this year.</LD>
<LD>   Moll, an Oscar- and Emmy Award-winning filmmaker ("The Last
Days"), says that this Memorial Day, Americans will be reminded of
the bravery of our armed forces "in a way they haven't for many, many
years."</LD>
<LD>   "Price for Peace," which can be seen Monday at 8 p.m. and was
executive produced by Steven Spielberg and Stephen E. Ambrose, was in
the works prior to last year's terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "We had finished a rough cut of the film just before 9/11," Moll
says. "I had a scene in there about the fact the United States has
this great military force that was taken for granted. No one ever
realized that we have the Army, Marines and Navy at the ready and
constantly training. I did a lot of interviews with veterans at Camp
Pendleton during a reunion and shot a lot of film of the Marines in
training. It was eye-opening to me. We were living at a time when we
took our military for granted. We don't anymore."</TE>
<TE>   "Price for Peace," which is narrated by Tom Brokaw, features color
footage shot by the Marines during World War II, along with
interviews with veterans. "They were chosen for the types of
experience they had during the war," Moll explains, "so we could
cover the breadth of experiences during the war." The program also
examines the Japanese perspective of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not simply a patriotic, flag-waving salute to America," he
says. "It examines the grim realities of war."</TE>
<TE>   Here's an overview of other Memorial Day programming for the
holiday weekend:</TE>
<TE>   "In Memoriam: 9/11/01, New York City": A documentary on the
terrorist attacks in New York City, utilizing personal collections of

guides of that fateful day, from their first realization of what had
happened through the rescue and recovery efforts. Sunday at 9 p.m.,
HBO.</TE>
<TE>   "The 2002 National Memorial Day Concert": Actor and World War II
veteran Ossie Davis is the host of this annual concert from the west
lawn of the U.S. Capitol. This year, the 90-minute special honors the
soldiers who endured the Bataan Death March during World War II, as
well as the victims and heroes of Sept. 11. Tony Danza, Heather
Headley, Charlotte Church and Charles Durning join the National

<TE>   "American Experience: Battle of the Bulge": Repeat of a

<HD>Isolation, Poverty for Vietnamese</HD>
<DH>Culture: Many elderly immigrants may be estranged from
their children and do not speak enough English to connect with
American neighbors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN and SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bach Van Nguyen, 92, has reconciled himself to his loneliness. His
wife is dead and the mistress who once came between them is gone. He
doesn't get along with his adult children in Florida and rarely
speaks to them.</LD>
<LD>   His most constant companion is a plastic yellow bird, bought for
$8, that chirps at the sound of his voice in a nearly empty Garden
Grove studio apartment.</LD>
<LD>   "The bird likes to talk to me," Nguyen says gleefully. "When I
cough, switch on the light, cook or clean the dishes, it likes to
sing along. ... I really enjoy this bird. We've become friends."</LD>
<TE>   This is not the existence Nguyen and other elderly Vietnamese
envisioned for themselves when they left their homeland for the
United States. Although many fled the Communist regime after U.S.
troops pulled out in 1975, others came later, hoping to live out
their years in the embrace of their expatriate families following the
Vietnamese tradition of extended "roof" families.</TE>
<TE>   Many have since stumbled into isolation and poverty, unable to
work or speak enough English to connect with American life around
them, especially when compared with their Spanish or English-speaking
peers, according to a recent "Condition of Older Adults 2002" study
by the Orange County Interagency Committee on Aging.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is pronounced in Orange County, home to the largest
Vietnamese population in the nation--about 135,500--but likely is
repeated in San Jose, which also has a significant concentration of
Vietnamese immigrants. Another 78,000 Vietnamese live in Los Angeles
County.</TE>
<TE>   For many older Vietnamese, the isolation becomes self-propelling.
Cloistered by language, many aren't aware of social programs--from
meals to transportation--that can connect them with others, said
Pamela M. Mokler, director of the Orange County Office on Aging.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, the agency has stepped up outreach efforts
through Vietnamese-language pamphlets, a special (800) 510-2020 help
line with translators, an information van that appears at Vietnamese
gatherings such as the annual Tet Festival, and by drawing together
community leaders for suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   Agency officials intend to turn to Vietnamese-language radio to
reach Vietnamese seniors, who overwhelmingly rely on radio for
information.</TE>
<TE>   The isolation is born of more than language barriers. There are
cultural walls to scale, as well. Many Vietnamese seniors are
satisfied with their living conditions--despite the poverty--because
life here is easier for them than in Vietnam, Mokler said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of them came here as political refugees who have a hard
time communicating what their needs are because they are so grateful
for what they have," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the figures reveal deep poverty. Nearly two-thirds of
Vietnamese-speaking seniors--62%--were living in poverty, compared to
37% for Spanish speakers and 4.5% for English speakers. The study,
conducted by researchers at Cal State Fullerton and Chapman
University, surveyed 1,035 seniors.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that only 16.7% of Vietnamese-speaking seniors
owned their own homes, compared with 23.8% for Spanish speakers and
80.6% for English speakers.</TE>
<TE>   While 37% of the wealthier English speakers tended to live alone,
13.6% of the mostly poor Vietnamese speakers did too. Only 10% of the
Spanish speakers lived alone.</TE>
<TE>   But even Vietnamese seniors living with their children and other
family members encounter problems of isolation as traditions fragment
under the transition to American lifestyles.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of them have to live with their family, but they feel a loss
of pride and respect because the youths don't follow traditions and
they speak mostly English," said Kathy T. Diep, founder of the
Asian-American Senior Citizen Assn. in Westminster. "Some of the
elderly are pushed away and placed in nursing homes. So they see
their situations as shameful."</TE>
<TE>   The result is a loose community of isolated seniors, many of whom
gather daily at markets and coffee shops along the strip malls of
Little Saigon to shop and seek human connections.</TE>
<TE>   "The seniors who are here often get depressed and they can't
express it." Diep said, adding that linguistic isolation is the
biggest contributor to loneliness. "It's the sense that each time
they step out of their doorstep, they don't know the roads, they
can't easily get anywhere because everything is spread out and they
can't drive, so they're completely dependent on others for simple
activities each day."</TE>
<TE>   For Duc Thi Nguyen, there's no family around to turn to. Nguyen,
75, who is not related to Bach Nguyen, arises each morning and prays
before a small Buddhist altar she has erected in her Santa Ana
kitchen, then leaves about 9 a.m. to catch a bus to Little Saigon,
where she shops and has lunch. Some days she goes to a gym to
exercise, or to the Chua Dieu Quang temple in Santa Ana to pray and
decorate altars.</TE>
<TE>   What she really seeks is a human touch, a connection to the world
outside of herself.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen immigrated in 1989 at age 62--a dozen years after her
husband died--to be closer to her three grown children. She moved
into a Mission Viejo home with her children, but the reunion only
lasted six months before the children moved on to jobs in San Jose
and Chicago. Nguyen decided to stay in Southern California, moving to
a Santa Ana neighborhood at the edge of Little Saigon.</TE>
<TE>   "I love my children and I know they love me, but they are busy
with their work far away and their families. That's how it is here in
America," Nguyen said. "I want to live here [in Little Saigon] where
there are many older people like me, and it eases the loneliness."</TE>
<TE>   Home is a one-bedroom apartment in a low-income housing project.
Nguyen lives on $750 a month in Social Security, paying $200 for
rent, about $200 for food and another $100 for utility, trash and
phone bills.</TE>
<TE>   "Half of the bills I pay go to my high electricity bill, because I
turn on the television, radio and all my lights to keep the apartment
from seeming dark and lonely when I get home, especially in the
evenings," Nguyen said.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen plans out her days the way she planned her immigration.
When she left Vietnam, she brought sacred soil and water from the
National Ancestral Temple in the northern Vinh Phu province. She
hopes to be buried with them , a little bit of Vietnam to join her in
American soil.</TE>
<TE>   "I have my visa and passport and now I'm just on the waiting list
for my turn to go to heaven," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bach Nguyen also is philosophical over the final years of his
life. At 92, he doesn't expect to live much longer, but is grateful
he's healthy enough to live on his own.</TE>
<TE>   "Living by yourself, there are chores you have to do like
vacuuming, ironing your clothes, and laundry that can get to be
cumbersome," Nguyen said, adding that he has become set in his ways
and enjoys his isolation despite waves of loneliness. Nguyen seldom
has visitors and doesn't know his neighbors' names.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to live by myself because I feel so much more at peace,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen receives $829 a month in Social Security. He says his needs
are few and he's able to get by. Rent is $186 a month, and he budgets
$100 each for the telephone bill and food, plus expenses such as car
insurance. There's a cot by the front window where he naps, a plastic
table and toy stools where he takes his meals; the table itself is
covered with papers and files.</TE>
<TE>   A blue tarp covers part of the floor where he parks the electric
wheelchair that is his primary mode of transportation. When he needs
groceries--about once a week--he drives his 1986 Toyota Corolla to a
store about a mile away.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen has family, but they are estranged. When Saigon fell,
Nguyen's wife and their three children escaped. He stayed behind to
be with his mistress. Nguyen reunited with his family in Florida in
1986, and cared for his diabetic wife until her death a year later,
then chose to live out his own life alone.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't live an entirely upstanding life," he said. "There is
pain in my heart from all the events that happened in my life, my
family estranged, and now that I'm far from my village and country."</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen doesn't like to think of his homeland, where nostalgia
overrides memories of even more dire poverty. "Living here, I have
everything I need," he said. "But when I remember my village, my
country, that's when I start to cry."</TE>

<LD>Newly released census figures confirm the ethnic diversity that
Orange County residents see on the sidelines during youth soccer
games, in classrooms and workplaces, and in the variety of churches,
synagogues and temples being erected.</LD>
<LD>   The snapshot culled from long-form census questionnaires also
shows a county in danger of splitting along economic and education
fault lines. It underscores the need for political leaders who are
capable of identifying and implementing solutions to the potentially
dangerous divides.</LD>
<LD>   The census figures provide solid evidence that the ethnic and
socioeconomic divisions that once separated Orange County from Los
Angeles County disappeared during the 1990s. The two counties that
once reveled in their differences now share many of the same problems
and promise. There's even some rumbling that South County might one
day catch the secessionist fever now rolling through the San Fernando
Valley.</LD>
<TE>   The stereotype of a county that served as a bastion of white
flight clearly is dead. More than a million of the county's 2.8
million residents--41.4%--speak a language other than English at
home. That's not far behind Los Angeles County's 54%.</TE>
<TE>   Increased diversity creates isolated problems, of course. Recent
headlines tell of one Irvine family that drew police scrutiny for
allegedly turning a 12-year-old Egyptian girl into a servant.</TE>
<TE>   Radio talk show callers were buzzing about an immigrant father who
caught his son stealing candy and meted out the same punishment his
mother did years ago in Guatemala--burning his hand over a stove.</TE>
<TE>   Both cases underscore the need for government, schools, churches
and other institutions to actively provide social services that help
immigrants to understand the role of citizenship in a democracy and
learn what's best left behind in the old country.</TE>
<TE>   Diversity can't be measured solely by ethnic backgrounds. The
census also describes a county dangerously close to being split into
haves and have-nots on education and income. The census numbers also
confirm that a new "Orange Curtain" threatens to divide the county's
older, northern cities, where many of the less-affluent immigrants
live, from the newer suburban areas to the south that house many
upper-middle-class and wealthy residents.</TE>
<TE>   Sociologists describe the dramatic differences in household income
in the county as the result of a "barbell" economy. One end of the
county's economy is heavy with poor, ill-educated immigrants
scrambling to make a living; the other is populated by wealthy,
educated citizens. The county's high cost of living continues to push
more residents below the poverty line.</TE>
<TE>   The county must embrace and welcome ethnic diversity and ensure
that educational opportunities are in place for poorer immigrants and
their children. Institutions ranging from the grand jury to the local
PTA must continue to lobby newcomers to join in community and
political processes or risk fracturing into divisive factions.</TE>
<TE>   Political leaders can dig in their heels and try to cling to the
image of a county that once served as a bastion for an insular brand
of politics. Or, they can find ways to harness the power of the
county's diverse population to improve the local economy, improve
overall quality of life and ensure that the county has the muscle
needed to advance its political interests in Sacramento and
Washington. These challenges will test the imagination and commitment
of residents, but they also provide an opportunity to make the county
an even better place to live and work.</TE>

<HD>Windows to Babies' World Are Closing at Hospitals</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nurseries where maternity ward visitors can gaze upon newborns dozing
peacefully in their bassinets are disappearing as hospitals shift
their focus to strengthening the mother-child bond in the first days
of life, officials say.</LD>
<LD>   In Ventura County, where six out of seven hospitals have
obstetrics units, only two nurseries remain open on a regular basis.
Responding to demands by managed care, evolving technology and
changing attitudes toward children and families, hospitals across
Southern California and the nation have adjusted their services to
allow mothers to keep their babies by their bedside around the clock.</LD>
<LD>   But with the change has come the loss of the popular viewing
areas, where hospital visitors burdened by some of life's darkest
moments could brighten their day a little simply by peering through
the nursery window.</LD>
<TE>   "I was so disappointed," said Susan Delaney of Agoura Hills, who
walked to the maternity ward at St. John's Regional Medical Center in
Oxnard during a recent break from visiting her ailing 92-year-old
grandmother. "When I got there, they said there was no nursery--all
the babies were in the rooms with their moms."</TE>
<TE>   Although the result was not intended to deprive people of the joy
of gazing upon the fresh and innocent, that is the consequence of the
"rooming-in" model of maternal care that has swept the hospital
industry over the last 20 years, said Amy Lee, a spokeswoman for the
American Hospital Assn., an advocacy group that represents 5,000
hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "The old days of large, impersonal settings where families don't
have any privacy, those days are history," said Bonnie Connors
Jellen, director of maternal and child health for the association.
"There's been a huge change going on where family-centered maternity
care has been the goal of most hospitals."</TE>
<TE>   Hospital associations could not cite figures but said changes in
health care and hospital management bear out the trend. New hospitals
are being designed without nurseries, but fear of kidnappings and
other security concerns are not the driving forces, Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   Many hospitals use nurseries only at a parent's request or for
newborns awaiting adoption, hospital officials said. Neonatal and
intensive care nurseries are maintained for premature or ill babies.</TE>
<TE>   For Myranda Braziel of Camarillo, who was about to give birth at
Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura last week, the nursery
provided some much-needed inspiration. In labor with her first child,
she walked the corridors of the maternity ward, pausing to look
through the window each time she passed.</TE>
<TE>   Braziel's mother and birthing coach, Lorelei Braziel, was
surprised to learn that many hospitals do not have these rooms with a
view.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be terrible to go to a hospital and not have a nursery,
where the grandparents and the rest of the family can look at the
baby after it's born," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The [private] room gets too crowded," said Jackie McDaniel of
Ojai at the suggestion she could enjoy the company of her 12th
grandchild, Riley Suzette, in the mother's private room.</TE>
<TE>   St. John's closed its nursery in 1992 in response to requests by
families becoming increasingly aware that the early days of life
outside the womb are crucial for mother and child, said hospital
spokeswoman Rita O'Connor.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the 1970s, there's been a real movement toward
family-centered care," said Jan Ayala, director of maternal child
health and nursing education at St. John's, where 2,800 babies are
born each year. "There's no reason to separate mom and baby."</TE>
<TE>   Maternity experts cite the benefits of rooming in: It makes
breast-feeding easier, it allows more time for mother and child to
become attached and it offers families a chance to bond with their
newest members.</TE>
<TE>   But Community Memorial and Los Robles Regional Medical Center in
Thousand Oaks said they plan to keep their nurseries open full time.
Los Robles does not have private rooms for expectant mothers, said
spokeswoman Rebecca Bishoff. Community Memorial does, but moms can
choose to keep their babies with them all the time or take a break
once in awhile, said spokesman John Masterson.</TE>
<TE>   "For large families where everyone's coming in from out of town,
they all want to be able to see the baby, so we keep them in the
nursery," said Michael Bakst, executive director of Community
Memorial. "And for people where things are not going well, we
recognize they would be attracted by the beauty of birth. Sometimes
people need to go from the sad, depressing side of the hospital to
the happy side. Babies put things in perspective."</TE>
<TE>   For Diana Etchells of Santa Paula, who was accompanied by her
daughter and two grandsons, the nursery at Community Memorial
provided a respite from watching her 72-year-old father suffer from a
heart condition in the cardiopulmonary unit.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see the finished product and it's a little easier. It's
pain with a purpose," Etchells said. "We don't know any of these
babies, but they're making us smile."</TE>

<HD>Alan Bell, 70; Studied Homosexuality</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alan P. Bell, a research psychologist who led a groundbreaking Kinsey
Institute study two decades ago suggesting that homosexuality has a
biological basis, has died. He was 70.</LD>
<LD>   Bell died of a stroke May 13 at a hospital in Bloomington, Ind.</LD>
<LD>   A retired professor of counseling and educational psychology at
Indiana University in that city, Bell was a senior research
psychologist for 14 years at the Alfred C. Kinsey Institute for Sex
Research, which is affiliated with the university.</LD>
<TE>   Bell led the Kinsey Institute study, published in 1981, that
suggested that homosexuals are born with that predisposition and not
influenced by traumatic experiences during childhood development.</TE>
<TE>   "We found homosexuality is deep-seated and not something that one
chooses to be or not to be," Bell said at the time. "We looked at the
biological underpinnings of sexuality."</TE>
<TE>   The study, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, was
based on five-hour interviews with about 1,500 homosexual and
heterosexual men and women in the San Francisco area.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, however, questioned the study's controversial finding
that there is almost no correlation between early family experience
and adult sexual orientation, and the researchers' method of relying
on participants' memories in answering researchers' questions.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect to be condemned from both sides--by the radicals for
even looking into the subject and by the analysts who may say we're
trying to paint a glowing picture of homosexuality," Bell said. "But
we are reporting what people say, and it's all very consistent."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Robinson, writing in Psychology Today, said Bell and his
co-authors answered the question of why some people become
homosexuals while others become heterosexuals "more satisfactorily
than any previous study."</TE>
<TE>   "One finishes [the study] with the firm sense that much of the
confusion about sexual identity has now been set aright," Robinson
wrote. "Parents can safely rid themselves of the fear that their
actions will somehow determine the sexual preference of their
children, and psychotherapists can relax their fierce campaign to
change adult sexual behavior by probing into early familial
experiences."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Newark, N.J., in 1932, Bell earned a bachelor's degree in
philosophy from the University of the South in Sewanee, Tenn., in
1952. He received a master's from General Theological Seminary in New
York in 1955, and as an Episcopal minister helped found a parish in
Denville, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Bell obtained a doctoral degree in counseling from Columbia
University in New York in 1964. During his doctoral internship at the
Veterans Administration hospital in Northport, N.Y., he became
interested in the dreams of a sex offender with whom he did extensive
work. The result was the book "The Personality of a Child Molester,"
co-written with Calvin Hall.</TE>
<TE>   In 1967, Bell became an assistant professor at Indiana University
and senior research psychologist at the Kinsey Institute. He also
served as a vice president of the institute for 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   While at Kinsey, he was senior author of "Sexual Preference: Its
Development in Men and Women" and another landmark publication,
"Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women."</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, Bell co-founded the university's Center for Human Growth,
which is a departmental training site for graduate students in
counseling and offers therapy for campus and community clients.</TE>
<TE>   A charter member of the International Academy of Sex Research,
Bell was the author of several books, including "Human Sexuality:
Studies From the Kinsey Institute" and "The Mind and Heart in Human
Sexual Behavior."</TE>
<TE>   After retiring from Indiana University in 1997, Bell continued his
private practice in psychotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his second wife, Shirley; a son, the noted
violinist Joshua Bell of New York City; three daughters, Terry
Milazzo of Bow, N.H., Toby Gill of Indianapolis and Rachel Bell of
Chicago; a sister, Patricia Kirkwood of Montclair, N.J.; and four
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>In Tiny Ojai, 23 Condos Make for Big Battle</HD>
<DH>Growth: Environmental groups file suit and push a ballot
initiative. But city sees economic benefits in the project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Surrounded by towering mountains and rows of sweet-smelling orange
trees, the Ojai Valley has long been a hideaway for reclusive movie
stars and spa-seeking tourists, an enclave for New Age hippies and
families looking for good schools and safe streets.</LD>
<LD>   But trouble is stirring in Shangri-La.</LD>
<LD>   Bulldozers recently began moving dirt for a new housing project
that environmentalists fear will destroy the rural charm of the
picturesque community.</LD>
<TE>   The project: 23 luxury condominiums squeezed into three acres
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   By sprawling Southern California standards, the development isn't
much of one. But in tiny Ojai, where growth creeps at a sluggish 0.3%
annually and Earth-loving residents protest the removal of even a
single oak tree, it is enough to spark a war over the city's future.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is about the biggest [housing project] we have ever
seen," said Stan Greene of Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, which has
sued to stop the development.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we think it is too massive and too intense," Greene
said. "The way it was expressed by one of our members to the Planning
Commission is that it is a very nice project, but not here. Meaning,
not in Ojai."</TE>
<TE>   The environmental group has placed an initiative on the November
ballot that would give voters authority to reject any future
developments that would increase traffic.</TE>
<TE>   City leaders contend the initiative is an attempt to halt growth
in what is already the smallest and slowest-growing city in one of
the most growth-restricted counties in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   They have sued to remove the measure from the ballot. A hearing is
set for Friday in Ventura County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want any growth," said City Councilman Joe DeVito, a
retired school administrator and Ojai resident for 37 years. "It is
kind of like, 'I've arrived and I want to close the door.'"</TE>
<TE>   Arguably, the door has been closing for some time.</TE>
<TE>   Only three new housing projects, totaling 68 units, have been
approved by the city since 1993, and the stock of available housing
remains tight--and expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Census data show the city of Ojai, population 7,862, grew by only
3% between 1990 and 2000, while nearby communities with cheaper real
estate grew by 13% to 16%.</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, the median price of a home jumped to $372,000,
compared with $285,000 at the same time last year, according to
DataQuick Information Systems. The spike placed Ojai among the top
three cities in the state with the greatest increase in median home
prices, according to the California Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   Skyrocketing housing costs and stagnant growth are now being
blamed for a sharp decline in school enrollment as working families
are priced out of the area.</TE>
<TE>   Ojai Unified School District, a small district serving about 3,900
students, expects to lose 190 student next year--nearly double last
year's enrollment dip of 100 students.</TE>
<TE>   Balancing the housing shortage with Ojai's geographical
limitations and self-imposed mantra to stay small is no easy task,
and it has forced developers and city planners to look inward for
growth opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Los Arboles Townhomes seemed to fit the niche.</TE>
<TE>   The mission-style condominiums would cover two vacant lots on
South Montgomery Street near Libbey Park, turning a blighted area
into a property tax-generating housing complex within the city's
downtown redevelopment district.</TE>
<TE>   The project, which went through several revisions before it was
approved earlier this year, would replace 29 rundown cottages and
single-family homes with stylish two-story townhouses. Two artists'
lofts would sit above street-level storefronts, and residents would
live within walking distance of downtown shops and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents say the mixed-use project concentrates growth in the
downtown core, encourages pedestrian traffic and is consistent with
anti-sprawl mandates.</TE>
<TE>   "It does hit all the buzzwords of modern planning," said developer
Lance Smigel, an Ojai Valley resident. "It is truly an in-fill
project with fewer units than were originally there."</TE>
<TE>   But opponents contend Los Arboles would cram too many people into
too small a space and worsen traffic on already congested roads
winding into and out of the Ojai Valley.</TE>
<TE>   They point to the city's own studies that show the project poses
"significant" adverse effects to traffic by adding 137 daily car
trips on those highways.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just keep using the road resources and the natural
resources and expect that you are not going to destroy the life
quality of people who live here," said Greene, a resident for 23
years.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't doubt that this can be an economic benefit," he said.
"But that doesn't mean that you destroy the vision of your community
just because of it."</TE>
<TE>   City leaders, however, felt the benefits, economic and otherwise,
outweighed the project's potential negative effects. They approved
Los Arboles in January 2001. Citizens to Preserve the Ojai and the
Environmental Coalition of Ventura County sued a month later.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, the groups say the city failed to conduct an
adequate environmental impact report, failed to consider project
alternatives and violated planning guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   The city denied the claims, but ultimately ordered up a
supplemental environmental study, and the lawsuit was settled in
October.</TE>
<TE>   Three months later, the council considered the new environmental
report and approved the project for a second time. In February,
opponents filed a second lawsuit, alleging that the supplemental
analysis was flawed.</TE>
<TE>   Their attorney, Richard Francis, wrote in court papers that the
revised analysis was based on an initial environmental report that
was "decertified, null, void and ineffective for any purpose. In
other words, it's supplemental to nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Although the lawsuit--which seeks an injunction to halt the
project--is pending, Smigel is confident the environmental review
will hold up in court and he is moving forward. Grading is underway.
And he hopes to obtain building permits this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by the city's stance on Los Arboles, environmentalists
placed on the ballot an initiative that would give voters, instead of
elected officials, the right to reject traffic-generating projects.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a wounded thing here, and we need to stop the bleeding,"
Greene said. "This is not going to stop all the traffic problems, but
we have to stop adding to the problem until we find a way of reducing
congestion."</TE>
<TE>   Similar measures were floated, unsuccessfully, in Newport Beach
and Walnut Creek in the mid-1980s. The Ojai initiative is believed to
be the most restrictive to go before voters.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the city has sued to take it off the ballot,
arguing the measure runs counter to state law and improperly takes
decision-making away from the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we would not be able to approve any new projects
because they would all have implications on traffic," City Atty.
Monte Widders said. "So it amounts to a de facto moratorium."</TE>
<TE>   Widders said the measure would have substantial economic
consequences and prohibit the city from providing affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to Los Arboles, the only housing developments approved in
Ojai during the past decade were two low-income projects, one of
which is scheduled to break ground June 6.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for that 24-unit housing complex on Fulton Street was
evident when about 500 people signed up to receive information.
Nonprofit homebuilder Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. took
applications from 120 prospective residents. The subsidized houses
are expected to sell for between $168,000 and $178,000.</TE>
<TE>   "There is just such an incredible need," said Karen Flock, housing
development director for Cabrillo, which is the county's leading
builder of low-income housing.</TE>
<TE>   "Ojai has the range of incomes as anywhere else," she said.
"People who work at the schools, the tourist industry and local
retail establishments need affordable housing."</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman DeVito knows that traffic is a problem in his
community, but he does not believe the proposed initiative is the
answer.</TE>
<TE>   And after fighting gridlock on the Orange County Freeway recently,
he cautioned that Ojai residents should keep things in perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "Go to the 55 and I-5," he said. "We have become very spoiled in
our comfort zone."</TE>

<HD>Big Battle Brews in Tiny Ojai Over Plan for New Housing</HD>
<DH>Growth: Environmental groups file suit and push a ballot
initiative in response to condo project. But city leaders see
economic benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Surrounded by towering mountains and rows of sweet-smelling orange
trees, the Ojai Valley has long been a hideaway for reclusive movie
stars and spa-seeking tourists, an enclave for New Age hippies and
families looking for good schools and safe streets.</LD>
<LD>   But trouble is stirring in Shangri-La.</LD>
<LD>   Bulldozers recently began moving dirt for a new housing project
that environmentalists fear will destroy the rural charm of the
picturesque community.</LD>
<TE>   The project: 23 luxury condominiums squeezed into three acres
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   By sprawling Southern California standards, the development isn't
much of one. But in tiny Ojai, where growth creeps at a sluggish 0.3%
annually and Earth-loving residents protest the removal of even a
single oak tree, it is enough to spark a war over the city's future.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is about the biggest [housing project] we have ever
seen," said Stan Greene of Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, which has
sued to stop the development.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we think it is too massive and too intense," Greene
said. "The way it was expressed by one of our members to the Planning
Commission is that it is a very nice project, but not here. Meaning,
not in Ojai."</TE>
<TE>   The environmental group has placed an initiative on the November
ballot that would give voters authority to reject any future
developments that would increase traffic.</TE>
<TE>   City leaders contend the initiative is an attempt to halt growth
in what is already the smallest and slowest-growing city in one of
the most growth-restricted counties in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   They have sued to remove the measure from the ballot. A hearing is
set for Friday in Ventura County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want any growth," said City Councilman Joe DeVito, a
retired school administrator and Ojai resident for 37 years. "It is
kind of like, 'I've arrived and I want to close the door.'"</TE>
<TE>   Arguably, the door has been closing for some time.</TE>
<TE>   Only three new housing projects, totaling 68 units, have been
approved by the city since 1993 and the stock of available housing
remains tight--and expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Census data show the city of Ojai, population 7,862, grew by only
3% between 1990 and 2000, while nearby communities with cheaper real
estate grew by 13% to 16%.</TE>

<HD>Owners of Jewelry Store Killed</HD>
<DH>Crime: Husband and wife are found shot in their North

<DL></DL>
<LD>A husband and wife who owned a jewelry store were fatally shot inside
their North Hollywood shop Saturday during what appeared to be a
robbery, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The couple, whose names were not released, were found dead about
5:15 p.m. at Elegant Creations, 4219 Lankershim Blvd.</LD>
<LD>   No arrests have been made and police were still trying to make a
final determination on the motive for the shooting.</LD>
<TE>   Nobody reported hearing shots, Los Angeles police said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no suspects and no witnesses," said LAPD Det. Mike
Coffey.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears to be a robbery situation," said Officer Don Cox.</TE>
<TE>   The jewelry store was burglarized in February, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police discovered the bodies lying just inside the shop's front
door after responding to a call from two men who were walking along
the busy San Fernando Valley street.</TE>
<TE>   The men stopped when they noticed broken glass and two bullet
holes in the front door, Cox said. They looked inside and saw what
they initially believed were mannequins, police said.</TE>
<TE>   When officers arrived, they saw the man and woman lying nearly
feet to feet, face up.</TE>
<TE>   They were shot multiple times, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Kristie Romero, who arrived at the shop at 5:30 p.m., said she
did not know what time the man and woman were killed.</TE>
<TE>   The couple had owned the shop for five years, said Ben Beckler,
who rented the building space to them.</TE>
<TE>   The shop is next to a car rental agency in the Toluca Lake
business district.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Bush, a regular customer, was eating at a restaurant across
the street when she heard about the shootings and came to see what
had happened.</TE>
<TE>   "They were from the heart," she said through tears.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said she and her husband, Jim, had their wedding rings done
by the couple and that she planned to bring in her engagement ring to
be resized soon.</TE>
<TE>   Lilia Kashirets, who owns the Better Image copy shop behind the
store, said she saw the couple earlier Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "They were so nice," she said. "Whenever I needed to fix my ring,
they would do it for me."</TE>

<HD>After Energy Jolt, Cities Think Small</HD>
<DH>Electricity: Irvine and other communities look to create
own utilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During last summer's drenching heat, residents in the desert towns of
the Coachella Valley were paying more than ever to keep their air
conditioners humming at 85 degrees--the result of California's
collapsing power industry.</LD>
<LD>   Homeowners in San Marcos in San Diego County watched their bills
triple. And few cities in the state were immune to threats of rolling
blackouts.</LD>
<LD>   But in La Quinta, a desert town powered by the Imperial Irrigation
District, the rates and power supply remained steady during the
crisis, even as residents in neighboring Indian Wells paid three
times as much for their electricity from Southern California Edison
Co. And in Los Angeles, where residents saw no price increase, the
city-owned Department of Water and Power was able to sell excess
electricity at a profit.</LD>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the power crisis, more than a dozen
communities around California have considered abandoning large
investor-owned utilities such as Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric.
Of those, Irvine in south Orange County may be best poised to make
the break.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine hopes to create a utility to serve what is now a large,
undeveloped area along its northern boundary. The city plans to annex
the land, on which the Irvine Co. plans to build 12,350 homes along
with a mix of businesses and industrial uses.</TE>
<TE>   By creating what is termed a "spot utility" to serve a specific
area, leaders in the master-planned community are hoping to avoid
some of the hurdles that have tripped up other cities dreaming of
freeing themselves from soaring energy costs and the tangle of the
state's power grid.</TE>
<TE>   Because the area under consideration is raw land and bean fields,
Irvine can avoid the difficulty of luring away Edison customers and
negotiating to use--or even buy--distribution systems. And its
size--roughly 3,600 acres that border the closed El Toro Marine
base--is large enough to support its own power plant, meaning the
area would be immune to outages that might flare up on the larger
distribution grid.</TE>
<TE>   Nor would the city be at the mercy of Edison or any other utility
to help bring in the electricity from suppliers, which might be out
of state.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Stands to Benefit From Better Technology</TE>
<TE>   Irvine also could take advantage of the latest technology in the
power industry.</TE>
<TE>   There are noiseless neighborhood generators that service about a
dozen homes or one small business, and larger plants that could
service the entire area. Some modern plants also harness the heat
that's created during electricity production to cool or heat homes
and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "In Irvine, it's a recipe that's worth looking at," said Ted
Flanigan, managing director of the California Energy Coalition, a
nonprofit group that promotes energy conservation</TE>
<TE>   The biggest problem city officials might face would be trying to
explain to residents elsewhere in Irvine why their new neighbors to
the north are paying less for electricity.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be an interesting and, quite frankly, a welcome
occurrence," said Larry Agran, the city's mayor.</TE>
<TE>   The area also has the right mix of uses--homes account for only
about 15% of the development. The rest is commercial, office and
industrial--big energy users.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an attractive load to serve," said Len Viejo, president of
Astrum Utility Services, which is conducting feasibility studies for
six California cities, including Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Few cities have such ingredients, however.</TE>
<TE>   The Coachella Valley, for instance, would have to bargain for as
many as 120,000 existing Edison customers.</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale is eyeing 93,000 Edison customers as it considers letting
the area's water district provide the city's power.</TE>
<TE>   "If you take away thousands of customers, it puts pressure on the
rest of the system to increase costs," said Charles Wilson, an Edison
project specialist.</TE>
<TE>   Experts agree that managing a utility is no easy trick--operations
are around the clock, maintenance costs can be enormous, and there's
no guarantee a new municipal district would be able to buy power from
suppliers any cheaper than Edison or other investor-owned utilities.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the municipal districts don't have to pay
income taxes or dividends to investors.</TE>
<TE>   "In the long run, municipal utilities have done a better job for
their customers, and that can happen even in today's market," said
Jerry Jordan, executive director of the California Municipal
Utilities Assn.</TE>
<TE>   San Marcos, Chino and Chino Hills have all considered spot
utilities in their undeveloped areas.</TE>
<TE>   San Marcos joined several other cities two years ago in proposing
to build a 250-megawatt plant in Burbank they hoped could supply some
of the town's power and hold off another energy crunch.</TE>
<TE>   But San Diego Gas &amp; Electric was unwilling to help San Marcos
bring in the power and the city gave up its efforts last month,
though it is holding onto its stake in the project.</TE>
<TE>   Chino and Chino Hills also dropped their efforts after concluding
that the risks outweighed the benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The areas were to be predominantly residential, and the customer
base would have amounted to just a few thousand households, lacking
the heavy energy users that would make the effort financially sound.</TE>
<TE>   Coachella Valley Cities Want More Control</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Indian Wells, however, believe there is power in
numbers. A councilman there is leading a movement among six Coachella
Valley cities to form their own power utility district.</TE>
<TE>   "When the rate goes from 13 cents to 26 cents per kilowatt hour,
there's motivation," said Indian Wells Councilman Percy Byrd, who
says his electricity bill averaged $700 a month last summer, almost
triple from the year before. "My concern is forming a municipal
utility district so we can begin to get a handle on our own destiny."</TE>
<TE>   So far, four cities--Indian Wells, Cathedral City, Palm Desert and
Desert Hot Springs--support the plan. If Palm Springs and Rancho
Mirage buy into the plan, the matter will be brought before voters in
November.</TE>
<TE>   But even then, the effort could face a tough road.</TE>
<TE>   The Coachella Valley communities aren't interested in generating
their own power, so the district would have to secure supply
contracts, figure out how to transmit the electricity to the desert,
and negotiate the purchase of the infrastructure from Edison, which
would probably be an unwilling seller.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever there's talk about a community wanting to take over an
existing system, as with Palmdale and Coachella Valley, you're
talking about a government takeover," Edison's Wilson said. "We're
part of the fabric of California, and we want to remain so."</TE>

<HD>Tenant Says He Ignited Blast</HD>
<DH>Encino: Badly burned man admits disconnecting stove's gas
pipe, then lighting a cigarette. Complex is badly damaged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU and JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A tenant who was working on his stove told authorities that he
disconnected the gas pipe, went to the bathroom and then lighted a
cigarette when he returned, igniting the explosion and fire that
engulfed an Encino apartment building Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The tenant, Dennis Cohen, 57, was burned over 55% of his body and
remained in critical but stable condition Saturday at Grossman Burn
Center in Sherman Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   "At this point there is no reason to doubt his story," said Los
Angeles Fire Chief William Bamattre, explaining that investigators
interviewed Cohen in the hospital Friday and Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "Nothing our detectives have found suggest that there is any
criminal activities involved in this at all," added Los Angeles
Police Department Cmdr. Gary Brennan during a briefing Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Accelerant-sniffing dogs brought to the scene Friday night did not
detect anything unusual. And neither the LAPD bomb squad nor the
criminal conspiracy units found anything suspicious, Brennan said.</TE>
<TE>   But investigators said they intend to further interview Cohen, who
was in extreme pain, heavily sedated and scheduled for surgery
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "What we really want to find out is why this happened," said Fire
Capt. Joe Castro. "Are we dealing with an accident? Are we dealing
with a potential suicide? We don't really know at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said that no one has been reported missing and estimate
that about 300 people live in the 130-unit complex. One woman, Mary
Jacobson, 76, who had been hospitalized with breathing problems, was
released.</TE>
<TE>   Ten units in one wing of the multi-building complex were destroyed
and dozens of others were damaged. None of the tenants will be
allowed to occupy their apartments for at least a week. The city's
Building and Safety Department will determine what buildings are safe
to be inhabited.</TE>
<TE>   Teams of investigators continued the delicate work Saturday of
hand-picking through layers of debris in the three-story wing of the
complex that exploded.</TE>
<TE>   By midafternoon, they had reached Cohen's second-story,
one-bedroom apartment and found a stove with its gas pipe
disconnected.</TE>
<TE>   "The physical evidence is consistent with witness reports," said
Castro. "The flex tubing is disconnected from the stove."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators still do not know how long the gas pipe was left
disconnected. Castro said the magnitude of a gas explosion is
predicated not only on the amount of gas released, but also on the
mixture of fuel and air.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes a small amount of gas, mixed with a lot of air, can
create a big explosion," Castro said.</TE>
<TE>   Although some residents had complained last week about smelling
gas, a spokeswoman for Southern California Gas Co., which serves the
building, had not received any complaints. Building manager Gayle
Rymer also said that no one had reported any gas odors to her.</TE>
<TE>   While investigators work, electricity and gas have been turned
off. The force of the explosion damaged dozens of units, bursting
many sliding glass balcony doors, blowing doors from their hinges,
and throwing chunks of concrete and roofing material around the
grounds. The stench of acrid smoke lingered in the corridor hallways
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 tenants spent Friday night on cots set up in the
gymnasium at Portola Middle School.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of others showed up at the complex at 5324 Newcastle Ave.
Saturday morning, waiting for police escorts into their units to
retrieve whatever belongings they could carry away--clothing, pets, a
bird cage, photo albums.</TE>
<TE>   A few, like Michael Pollack, a 41-year-old fabric salesman who was
at work at the time of the explosion, stood on the sidewalk, staring
into the ruins that used to be his apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything I own is gone--pictures of my kids, stuff from my
grandmother," he said. "The only thing I have is the clothes on my
back."</TE>
<TE>   Pollack had lived next door to Cohen on the second floor, but
didn't know the man, who the apartment manager said had lived there
for only a few months.</TE>
<TE>   A man who identified himself at the hospital as Cohen's best
friend said Cohen was born in New York and moved to Los Angeles in
the early 1970s. The man, who declined to give his name, said Cohen
was home on disability leave and had few family members in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Two police officers who were on patrol when they heard the
explosion rushed to the building and saw Cohen stagger out in flames.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked like he was melting," said Officer Raymond Diaz. "He
was in shock, trembling when paramedics took him away."</TE>
<TE>   The two officers then ran to help a woman on the second floor,
screaming for them to rescue her wheelchair-bound mother.</TE>
<TE>   As still-jittery tenants waited Saturday to enter their units,
they recalled the scene and how they initially feared that they had
been bombed, mindful of recent government-issued warnings that
terrorists might strike American apartment buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm afraid to go and live there. I'm very nervous," said Jehan
Gasser, 68, who had lived in her unit for 21/2 years with her
5-year-old granddaughter. "My apartment is intact, but my concern is
safety."</TE>
<TE>   Janie Poole, 24, was more worried about the immediate future. She
had just moved to Los Angeles from Alabama to pursue a writing career
while working as an assistant director at a private tutoring center.
She had not even had time to buy a cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any money to put down for an apartment and I haven't
gotten my first paycheck yet," Poole said. She spent the night on the
floor of a friend of the building maintenance man. She showed up at
the Red Cross shelter Saturday morning, where she was given a $25
voucher for groceries at Ralphs and a package with a toothbrush,
shampoo and washcloth.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom keeps saying, 'Come home, come home,'" Poole said.</TE>

<LD>First, his relatives placed a white cross and a U.S. flag in front of
Navy veteran George J. Harmer's grave. But Kayla Rojas, 6, felt
something more was needed for her great uncle.</LD>
<LD>   The grave marker needed flowers. So Kayla drew some on the back of
a note that her father, Steven, placed there.</LD>
<LD>   The note read: "Of course we honor and remember you."</LD>
<TE>   The Rojas family was among nearly 350 people who decorated
Fullerton's Loma Vista Memorial Park with nearly 3,000 crosses and
flags Saturday in preparation for a Memorial Day service Monday
morning.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers, including Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, went by a map
showing veterans' plots. Jewish veterans were honored with the Star
of David.</TE>
<TE>   The cemetery has been paying tribute to U.S. veterans for more
than 60 years. The mausoleums hold relics of Orange County's military
history, with several tombs of Civil War veterans. The annual
ceremony is sponsored by the American Veterans Memorial Assn.</TE>
<TE>   This year's ceremony will be dedicated to nurses who risked their
lives in the armed forces, said cemetery Vice President Sharon Adams.
William T. Bester, assistant surgeon general and chief of the Army
Nurse Corps, will be a guest.</TE>
<TE>   More volunteers than usual came out Saturday, which organizers
attribute to the wave of patriotism sparked by the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. Likewise, they anticipate a bigger turnout for Monday's
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   The Rojas family, of Fullerton, knew little about Harmer's role in
World War II but wanted to honor him.</TE>
<TE>   "He was proud of having served his country," Steven Rojas said,
holding a video camera to record his family's visit.</TE>

<HD>Gas Prices Are Expected to Remain Steady</HD>
<DH>Petroleum: After earlier spikes, fuel costs drop in weeks
before Memorial Day. In good news for summer travelers, prices are
well below last year's record highs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN and RAY HERNDON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defying a trend that has aggravated California commuters and
vacationers for years, gasoline prices have dropped in the weeks
leading up to this Memorial Day, the traditional start of the summer
driving season.</LD>
<LD>   Signaling even more good news, prices are expected to remain
steady, barring a refining mishap or supply shortage triggered by a
national or world event such as the continuing conflict in the Middle
East.</LD>
<LD>   Prices are well below last year's record highs: The state average
for regular unleaded hit $1.95 a gallon the week of May 14, 2001,
although remote towns like Eureka exceeded $2 a gallon.</LD>
<TE>   "Unless there should be an important glitch in supply of finished
gasoline, then relative price stability is the most likely scenario,"
said Trilby Lundberg, editor of the Lundberg survey of 8,000 gas
stations.</TE>
<TE>   Such stability has not been the norm in California gas prices,
especially this time of year. Since 1995, prices have spiked an
average of 19 cents a gallon from February to May, according to the
California Energy Commission.</TE>
<TE>   This year, prices rose sharply in February and March because of
increased crude oil costs sparked by international events. They have
dropped gradually since early April. On average, a gallon of gasoline
costs $1.55 in California, down 40 cents from the same time last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Several Southern California motorists interviewed last week said
they just roll with the price spikes.</TE>
<TE>   "That's part of the price you pay for living here; everybody
drives a car, and you have to have gas," said Mary Lorge, a Cal State
Fullerton student.</TE>
<TE>   Filling her car at a Fountain Valley Chevron station, where gas
cost 8 cents a gallon more than at a nearby Arco station, she said
she no longer price-shops. "I found that if I went for the cheaper
gas, my car made funny noises and didn't run as well."</TE>
<TE>   As Roger Meyer filled up his sky-blue 1969 Dodge Dart in Ventura,
the theater director from Moorpark said, "I do comparison shopping in
every other area of life. But I rarely shop around [for gas].... In
the general scheme of my life, gas prices are a pretty low priority."</TE>
<TE>   Finding a good price, however, is important to April Cathaway, a
nurse and single mother of four from Newbury Park. She frequently
drives 13 miles to Simi Valley in search of savings.</TE>
<TE>   "If I know I can get a good deal, I'll drive out of town," she
said as she filled up her Buick sedan.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall Goldman, 65, a salesman who lives in Irvine and drives
about 20,000 miles a year in his work, traveled 10 miles farther up
the San Diego Freeway on his way to Simi Valley before pulling off to
fill up at an Arco station on Brookhurst Street. He pays close
attention, he said, to gas prices as he makes his calls, and finds
that the Arco stations in Fountain Valley and Garden Grove have some
of the lowest prices.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman said the price of gas affects the way he lives and works.
"I cut back on driving if it gets too nuts, and do as much as I can
by telephone. And I make my calls in person only when there's the
chance of a big sale."</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Nichols, 40, pulled into the same Arco station to fill up
the family Suburban for a weekend getaway with his wife and two
children. Nichols said he has to pay attention to gas prices because
his SUV gets only about 15 miles per gallon. "I actually drove down
here because the gas was 2 cents cheaper" than at another Arco
station closer to his Fountain Valley home.</TE>
<TE>   One reason prices go up in spring is that refineries in California
must switch from a winter-grade to summer-grade gasoline, which is
less polluting but more expensive to produce. Any delay in the
conversion can disrupt supplies and further increase prices at the
pump, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is kind of a witches' brew of problems that can happen at
this time," said Jay McKeeman, executive vice president of the
California Independent Oil Marketers Assn., which represents
wholesale fuel sellers.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline prices in California are generally more volatile than in
other states because motorists here must consume a low-emissions
blend produced almost exclusively by California refineries. When
supplies for the unique blend are low, refineries in nearby states
can't come to the rescue.</TE>
<TE>   Prices can also vary from city to city--in some cases, from
neighborhood to neighborhood--by as much as 10 cents per gallon under
a controversial oil industry practice known as "zone pricing."
Industry officials defend the practice as a marketing tactic that
allows dealers to be competitive. They argue that prices are
sensitive to land costs, taxes, labor, competition and other factors.</TE>
<TE>   "It is more or less what the market will bear," McKeeman said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, he noted that gasoline prices are typically higher in
San Francisco than in Los Angeles because of tighter zoning
restrictions, higher land costs and other expenses.</TE>
<TE>   But some activists and independent station owners charge that
"zone pricing" is one of several tactics used by major oil companies
to increase profits and drive small "mom and pop" stations out of
business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the major reason why consumers can't get the cheapest
price," said Will Woods, executive director of the Automotive Trade
Organizations of California, a trade group for independent service
station owners.</TE>
<TE>   Most industry experts said the supply and cost of crude oil is the
biggest factor in gasoline prices. About a third of the oil used in
California refineries comes from abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Prices rose sharply this spring, when Iraq and Venezuela briefly
cut crude oil supplies. Iraq suspended its supply to protest the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict; a labor dispute and protests in
Venezuela disrupted supplies there.</TE>
<TE>   "The international oil scene is an important factor--and not
predictable, as you know--in the price of crude," Lundberg said.</TE>
<TE>   John Felmy, chief economist for the American Petroleum Institute,
agreed, pointing out that crude oil represents about 41% of the price
of gasoline. "The fundamental reason for the volatility of gasoline
is the price of crude," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, psychological factors can play a role in prices.
Shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, gasoline prices spiked
because of fears of an ensuing war and of oil supply shortages.</TE>
<TE>   But oil industry experts said a sharp drop in airline travel since
then has decreased demand for jet fuel, helping keep petroleum
inventories high. That has helped keep prices stable.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the short-term volatility in gasoline prices, oil industry
officials said the long-term trend in gasoline prices--when adjusted
for inflation--has been decidedly downward.</TE>
<TE>   "Real gas costs, when adjusted for inflation, are lower than they
were in 1981," said Daniel Cummings, a spokesman for British
Petroleum, the largest supplier of gasoline in California through
Arco stations.</TE>
<TE>   Although Californians now pay much more for gasoline than
motorists in almost every other state, that disparity did not exist a
decade ago, when the state had surplus refining capacity and was even
able to export gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   But as the number of California-registered vehicles grew in the
1990s from 25 million to 30 million, boosting demand, the relative
refining capacity declined to the point where the slightest
disruption in supply creates instant and widely felt shortages, and
soaring prices as well.</TE>
<TE>   Even when supplies are bountiful, California prices on average
range 10 cents to 20 cents a gallon higher than the average U.S.
price, after adjusting for local taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Investigations conducted by the California attorney general's
office and the U.S. Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations
concluded that was due in part to the lack of real industry
competition in the state, where four petroleum refiners control
roughly 80% of the gasoline production, and there are practically no
independent gasoline outlets.</TE>
<TE>   California prices have driven some motorists to consider making
dramatic changes in their driving habits.</TE>
<TE>   Ollin Martinez, a television cameraman from Pasadena, said he
routinely shops around for the lowest price but now he is considering
trading in his BMW M3 for a hybrid electric car. "It's killing me,"
he said as he filled his sports car with gas in Pasadena. "I'm
pumping $30 a week, and I don't even drive my car on weekends."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Cara Mia DiMassa, Anica Butler and Gariot
Louima contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>4 Factors in Fuel Pricing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gasoline prices in California are primarily influenced by four
factors, according to oil industry experts.</LD>
<LD>   Crude oil: The cost of crude--unrefined oil pumped from the
ground--accounts for 41% of the price of a typical gallon of gas.
Nearly half the crude supplied to California refineries comes from
within the state, but in recent years more and more foreign oil has
been used. Overseas supplies can be volatile, depending on
international events, wars and labor disputes. Crude is traded as a
commodity, and as the price of a standard 42-gallon barrel goes up
and down, so does the price of gas.</LD>
<LD>   Taxes: Taxes represent about 30% of the cost motorists pay at the
gas pump. In California, federal and state excise taxes add about 36
cents to each gallon. In addition, municipalities charge a sales tax:
Los Angeles County adds 8.25 cents a gallon; Orange, Riverside and
San Diego counties add 7.75 cents; and Ventura County adds 7.25
cents.</LD>
<TE>   Refining: The industrial process that turns crude into gasoline
makes up about 16% of the cost of a gallon of gas. In California,
refining costs include an additional 5 cents to 8 cents per gallon to
produce the nation's cleanest-burning gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   Distribution and marketing: This element, which represents about
13% of the cost of a gallon of gas, includes oil company
transportation, fees, wages, supplies, insurance, advertising and
profits.</TE>

<HD>High Concept of This Group: Helping Kids</HD>
<DH>For 75 years people in show business have raised money for
the needy through low-key charity.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It makes sense to Maureen Arthur-Ruben that most people in Los
Angeles know nothing about Variety International--The Children's
Charity.</LD>
<LD>   A pet charity of the film distribution and exhibition industry,
Variety has, for the most part, remained what Arthur-Ruben calls
"Hollywood's best kept secret." That's because the group's board of
directors prefers to spend money on the children rather than on
expensive ad campaigns, she said.</LD>
<LD>   Still, as Variety celebrates its 75th anniversary, Arthur-Ruben,
who is a onetime president of Variety--The Children's Charity of
Southern California, thinks it is sad that more people aren't aware
of the role Variety plays in supporting some of Southern California's
best-known nonprofit groups.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a big glitzy arena that we live in," said Arthur-Ruben,
an actress who played Peg in the brief 1984 sitcom "Empire" and
appeared in numerous films, including 1967's "How to Succeed in
Business Without Really Trying." "We get used to seeing the premieres
and stars and reports of the amount of money 'Spider-Man' is making.</TE>
<TE>   "The other part is: There are many children in our community that
are living under the poverty level, kids that need things like coats
and shoes and supplies for school."</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, Variety supports many long-established
organizations, but also gives smaller grants to various causes.</TE>
<TE>   Last year it awarded 15 grants, provided funding for 20 individual
scholarships and donated several vehicles to various groups. Total
value: about $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Boys &amp; Girls Club in Boyle Heights received the largest grant
last year. Variety, which founded the club 53 years ago, contributed
$103,000 to support the club's operating budget and scholarship
program.</TE>
<TE>   Brave Kids, a San Francisco-based organization that provides
support to families with children suffering from chronic and
life-threatening illnesses, is set to open two resource centers in
Los Angeles. Variety gave the group $100,000 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Wonder of Reading, a Westside nonprofit organization that
refurbishes and restocks public school libraries, received $85,000.</TE>
<TE>   And Variety used $115,000 to supply several organizations,
including A Place Called Home, with "Sunshine Coaches," 12- to
15-passenger vans used to transport children from South-Central Los
Angeles to various events.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people out there that need help, and we try to
give it to them," said Clark Woods, chairman of the board of
directors of Variety of Southern California. "We can't help everyone,
but we don't give a lot of no's."</TE>
<TE>   Arthur-Ruben said her experience with Variety reminds her that
there will always be someone in need.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning, when you start this work, you think you'll help
the children and that would be it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The larger reality is: There are always children everywhere that
need some kind of help."</TE>
<TE>   Variety Club, not affiliated with the trade journal, was founded
in Pittsburgh in 1927 as a social club for entertainment executives.
The men would get together to smoke, drink and play cards.</TE>
<TE>   Their focus changed from social to philanthropic in 1928, said Jay
Cooper, executive director of Variety--The Children's Charity of the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   As the story goes, a mother abandoned her baby at the Sheridan
Square Theatre on Christmas Eve. She pinned a note to the baby's
clothing, asking that the show business people take care of her
child, because she and her husband could barely afford to care for
their eight other children.</TE>
<TE>   The police couldn't find the child's mother, so club members,
including the theater's owner, decided to underwrite the girl's care
and education, Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   "The members sent in so much stuff that it was just too much for
this one little girl," Cooper said, "Instead of just giving it back,
they said, 'Look, there are other kids out there that need help,' and
Variety was started."</TE>
<TE>   Last year the international group--with 51 chapters in 13
countries from England to South Africa--doled out $57 million. The
Southern California group raised about $1.3 million. It operates on a
$140,000 annual budget, and employs one full-time staffer and two
part-timers.</TE>
<TE>   From 85% to 90% of the money raised goes directly to the slew of
nonprofit groups that Variety supports, Executive Director Maria
Schmidt said.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the 51 chapters is responsible for raising its own budget
to support local projects.</TE>
<TE>   While Variety has grown significantly over the years, it has kept
close to its entertainment industry roots. Chapters are called tents,
like a circus big-top. (The Southern California group is Tent 25.)
And tent presidents are called chief barkers.</TE>
<TE>   The Southland tent faded into obscurity in the 1980s. Many of the
group's board members had retired from their entertainment industry
jobs, and Tent 25 no longer had its Hollywood "in."</TE>
<TE>   Organization members say Arthur-Ruben revived the group 10 years
ago when she and Monty Hall (of "Let's Make a Deal" fame) wrote
letters to major film distribution companies, asking them to
recommend representatives to sit on the club's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   One of those appointed was Woods, who initiated the sale and
distribution of golden heart pins in movie theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1991, pin sales have been Variety's chief revenue source,
said Woods, vice president of general sales at Paramount Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "We always called ourselves 'the heart of show business,' and I
felt we had to get back closely aligned with the industry that bore
us," Arthur-Ruben said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much to do here that ... you kind of think it will
never get done, but you have to keep going on," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't do everything, but some of it does get done."</TE>

<HD>Veterans Home in West L.A. Gains</HD>
<DH>Legislature: Assembly speaker wins support for project in
his district by assuring colleagues that needs of ill, old vets in
their areas will be met.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson says he has persuaded
rural legislators that his proposal to build a new state veterans
home in West Los Angeles will not block their demands to shelter
aging and ill vets in the San Joaquin Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Assembly Democrats Sarah Reyes of Fresno and Dennis Cardoza of
Merced had voiced fears that a long-proposed veterans home in the
valley would be further delayed or forgotten as the powerful Wesson
sped ahead with his plan.</LD>
<LD>   Following a Thursday ceremony in Capitol Park, attended by former
members of the armed forces, the Culver City Democrat voiced
confidence that Reyes and Cardoza now agree with his plan for
building additional homes and "support it enthusiastically."</LD>
<TE>   Cardoza later said his concerns had been eliminated and he
expected legislation for all the homes to now pass easily.</TE>
<TE>   The West Los Angeles facility would be built in Wesson's district
amid the federal Veterans Affairs Medical Center complex. The UCLA
medical school is nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson staged the ceremony to assure California veterans that they
will receive proper shelter and medical attention at the West Los
Angeles facility. The same was true, he said, for homes proposed for
Lancaster and Saticoy, in Shasta County in the north, and at an
undetermined site near Fresno in the San Joaquin Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson said he believed that Reyes and Cardoza had not been fully
informed of his plans when they first expressed their concerns last
month. "There were discussions since then, and they have recognized
that this makes sense," Wesson told a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   As an indication that harmony had been restored, Cardoza and
Reyes, members of the newly reconstituted Assembly Veterans
Committee, flanked Wesson on the stage during the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   California operates veterans homes at Barstow, Chula Vista and
Yountville in Northern California. Political infighting in the
Legislature has stalled progress over where to build additional
homes.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech at a war memorial in Capitol Park, Wesson promised
that "those disputes are over today.... We are going to take care of
California's veterans."</TE>
<TE>   The three dozen or so aging vets at the ceremony, some in
wheelchairs or pushing walkers and most wearing their veterans
organization caps, applauded the promise. But some said they had
heard similar words before without results.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson's plan stirred controversy from the outset because he
introduced his plan for a facility in West Los Angeles well after the
other projects had been proposed. The 500-bed facility would be
financed, in part, from savings that would result from scaling back
the Lancaster and Saticoy proposals from about 400 beds each to 100
each.</TE>
<TE>   It is uncertain how much these residences would cost, but two
years ago, voters approved a $50-million bond issue for veterans
homes. In addition, California officials believe the federal
government will provide as much as $55 million toward the
construction cost.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson, who did not serve in the military, was also applauded when
he told the veterans that the West Los Angeles home would provide
state-of-the-art care and treatment for vets with Alzheimer's disease
and various dementia ailments.</TE>
<TE>   He also noted that Los Angeles and Orange counties contain the
state's largest population of veterans, but they have no easily
accessible state-run facility to house and care for them when they
need it.</TE>
<TE>   Under interlocking bills carried by Wesson, Sen. K. Maurice
Johannessen (R-Redding) and Sen. Wes Chesbro (D-Arcata), the West Los
Angeles, Lancaster and Saticoy homes would be financed with funds
from the 2000 bond issue and federal money.</TE>
<TE>   Construction of the homes proposed for the San Joaquin Valley and
Shasta County would be financed by lease-revenue bonds at some
unspecified time in the future.</TE>

<HD>Panel Shows Many Sides of Secession</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A diverse panel of speakers who gathered in Sylmar on Saturday to
discuss the Valley's proposed breakaway from the city were able to
agree on this much: Secession is a complicated thing.</LD>
<LD>   The symposium at Mission College offered a glimpse at what
secession might, or might not, mean from the perspective of
academics, politicians and religious leaders, as well as secession
supporters and opponents.</LD>
<LD>   The Local Agency Formation Commission voted last week to place the
secession issue on the November ballot. The secession drive was born
out of complaints by Valley residents about lack of services and
political underrepresentation.</LD>
<TE>   If the Valley breaks away, it will become a city of 1.35 million,
represented by 14 council members and an elected mayor.</TE>
<TE>   The symposium, which drew about 70 people, featured six panelists,
each given eight minutes to explain his or her studies and years of
research.</TE>
<TE>   Xandra Kayden, a spokeswoman for the League of Women Voters,
opened the symposium by saying the San Fernando Valley was annexed by
the city in 1915 to gain access to water, and "there's been talk of
secession ever since."</TE>
<TE>   Relying on a league report, she said the viability of secession is
unclear because of a fluctuating economy, the unprecedented size of
the proposed breakaway city and uncertainty about its ability to
raise money.</TE>
<TE>   "No one's ever done this before," she said. "It's not clear that a
smaller city will be any better at providing services than a bigger
one."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Felipe Fuentes, a Van Nuys resident, said the
greatest concern of Los Angeles is "revenue neutrality," a
requirement under state law that the city not be financially harmed
by secession.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think [secession supporters] have really taken the time
to look at what happens to the rest of the city," Fuentes said. "When
you lop off one-third of a city, you don't necessarily lose one-third
of the workload."</TE>
<TE>   Political science professor Tom Hogen-Esch, who has studied
secession, said that of the "many complex issues" surrounding the
concept, one of the most intriguing is the makeup of secession
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an interesting and odd coalition of pro-growth business
interests and slow-growth homeowners' groups," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They share a similar vision of what the Valley should look like,
and they want to protect it from undesirable forms of development,"
he added.</TE>
<TE>   From a religious perspective, the question of secession should be
answered by asking how it would affect the "poor, weak and
marginalized," said Tim Johnston, a representative of the Council of
Religious Leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "Morally and theologically, secession supporters haven't
demonstrated that the cure will be better than the problem," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Leafing through a thick stack of newspaper clippings about gang
violence, Oscar Mendoza, an executive board member of the
pro-secession group Valley VOTE, said Valley residents "have waited
87 years" in vain for the city to provide adequate services.</TE>
<TE>   "Do we want our children to continue to be killed by gang
violence?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Community activist Irene Tovar said there are no guarantees
secession would not worsen city services and advised voters to focus
on how they might be directly affected.</TE>
<TE>   "If your family member needs CPR, are [secession supporters] going
to give it to them? They want you to hope that we will have jobs,
firefighters and street cleaners," she said. "Camelot never existed.
Let's get real."</TE>
<TE>   Audience members, mostly residents of the northeast Valley, said
the discussion was helpful.</TE>
<TE>   "They should have more of these; it was very informative," said
Ben Espinoza, who said he has lived in the Valley for more than 70
years and opposes secession.</TE>
<TE>   Gustavo Villa, 21, a political science student at Mission College,
also approved of the idea of more discussion but recommended
bilingual sessions.</TE>

<HD>Lighthouse Gets a New Beacon</HD>
<DH>Landmark: The Victorian-era structure's signal again
reaches 20 miles to sea. A restoration is next.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY ANN CONNELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>POINT PIEDRAS BLANCAS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Winds howl, elephant seals bark and researchers scurry over tide
pools here, but the abundant signs of life have long failed to
benefit the lighthouse. The 127-year-old landmark fell into disrepair
in the last half of the 20th century.</LD>
<LD>   But in a famine-to-feast turn of events for history buffs, the
Central Coast structure, not far from Hearst Castle, seems finally to
be coming under a brighter light.</LD>
<LD>   Not only is a new beacon being installed, but the Victorian-era
lighthouse is due for a restoration and management change that is
expected to improve its appearance and, probably, open it to the
public for the first time.</LD>
<TE>   In a colorful ceremony under overcast skies Saturday, a crowd of
240 invited guests witnessed the U.S. Bureau of Land Management take
control of the site from the U.S. Coast Guard.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just tickled to death," said Kathe Tanner, a member of the
local historical society and a writer for the area weekly newspaper.
"The lighthouse is really too big for a group as small as ours to
manage. But with the BLM in charge, I think we are considered a
junior partner, maybe a real helpful munchkin partner."</TE>
<TE>   The bureau plans to work with lighthouse buffs and area residents
to raise private funds for a new lantern room and authentic
historical reconstruction of the Piedras Blancas Lighthouse costing
$2.5 million to $3.5 million. Aficionados have long dreamed of a
renaissance for the lighthouse, which was built on a point that
Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo named for its white rocks in
1542.</TE>
<TE>   The current plans are a far cry from expectations just three years
ago, when the bright beacon that blinked into the night for 25 miles
burned out. The Coast Guard replaced it with a relatively dim bulb,
which reached just 10 miles.</TE>
<TE>   After howls of protest from area residents, Rep. Lois Capps
(D-Santa Barbara) put pressure on the Coast Guard to turn the
lighthouse over to another agency, with the goal of eventually making
it accessible to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "We were asked, 'Can't we get a bigger light in there?' And it
certainly sounded like a reasonable request to us," Capps said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bureau of Land Management took control of the 19-acre site in
October. The Coast Guard had not staffed the site since 1975, though
it continued to maintain the light as an aide to navigation.</TE>
<TE>   That changed as the bureau took over everything, including the
light, in a ceremony Saturday. The plans called for Coast Guard
officials to switch off the dim, older beacon Saturday night, and for
the bureau to turn on the brighter light, again making the beacon
visible from 20 miles out to sea.</TE>
<TE>   "The Coast Guard has such a different mission than we do," said
John Bogacki, the bureau's lighthouse station manager at Piedras
Blancas. "They provide aids to navigation and, increasingly,
security, and they are really tapped out. We manage land."</TE>
<TE>   But even the bureau--which traditionally has managed range land,
mines and open spaces--is taking on a new role with the
administration of monuments, parks and historic properties like the
lighthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Bureau officials said Piedras Blancas is a natural stop for those
visiting the newly established Bureau of Land Management California
Coastal National Monument, which includes parts of the shoreline and
publicly owned offshore rocks from Mexico to Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   The three guano-covered rocks that give this site its name are
owned by Hearst Corp., as is the surrounding land and the access road
to the lighthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Bureau officials are negotiating with Hearst to gain access so
that appointment-only public tours can begin.</TE>
<TE>   Bogacki is working on forming a nonprofit group called Friends of
Piedras Blancas to handle fund-raising. The timeline for
reconstruction depends on how much money can be raised.</TE>
<TE>   "People are drawn to lighthouses, because of the serenity and safe
feeling you get from them," Bogacki said as he stood atop the 74-foot
lighthouse recently, watching tourists stop along California 1 to
shoot pictures of the structure. "Between the 800,000-plus visitors
to Hearst Castle a year and all the people who drive Highway 1, we
won't have any trouble finding visitors."</TE>
<TE>   But Bogacki said that opening the lighthouse must not interfere
with any of the extensive federal research at Piedras Blancas into
everything from the California gray whale migration to sea otter
health.</TE>
<TE>   When the lighthouse was installed in 1875, it was the only light
that mariners saw between Santa Barbara and Monterey.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no other design quite like Piedras Blancas in the
country," said Wayne Wheeler, president of the U.S. Lighthouse
Society.</TE>
<TE>   "We're riding a historic preservation wave, and lighthouses are
very hot right now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Preservation has been possible because many lighthouses are
isolated on public land, he said. "They were safer than many spots in
our pave-over and tear-down world."</TE>

<HD>Hapless Chinese Immigrants Can't Escape the Party Line</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A year ago, when friends asked why I took this job, I often told them
I didn't know of a place where the cultures of three continents come
together as they do in Southern California. Imagine the column
possibilities, I said.</LD>
<LD>   I must admit, however, that I did not foresee 10 naked refugees
from China wading ashore at a teenage beach party in Orange County.
It was easily the most spectacular landing since professional
goofball Dennis Rodman arrived by helicopter on a nearby beach.</LD>
<LD>   If you missed the story last week, the men, in their 20s and 30s,
apparently jumped ship at about 2 a.m. and desperately paddled, in
chilly surf, toward new beginnings. Unfortunately, their 7,000-mile,
one-month journey landed them in America at precisely the time Katie
Gottron, 19, had stepped outside the party to call her boyfriend,
Pat, in Arizona.</LD>
<TE>   Oh, these quirks of timing, these unchartable crossroads that
decide our fate. Ten Chinese nationals had just leaped from a
modern-day slave ship, and four American college teens were about to
foil their dash to freedom just as they reached the finish line. What
were the chances?</TE>
<TE>   Bridgett Saeman, 18, went out on the deck of her trailer at El
Morro Beach Mobile Home Park to see Katie, who was still yakking with
her boyfriend, and noticed something in the water. Maryann Siragusa,
18, recalls Katie running inside to alert her and Amelya D'Alba, 19.</TE>
<TE>   "Katie came back in and says, 'Hey, guys, there's naked boys in
the water," said Maryann. "We go, 'Oh,' so we all ran outside, and
that's when we saw them."</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear whether boyfriend Pat, helpless in Arizona,
overheard this chatter about the naked strangers. But for those of
you who are parents, rest assured that John Siragusa would later ask
his daughter Maryann why on earth she did such a thing.</TE>
<TE>   "We told them thank God they're safe. They shouldn't have gone
down there," said Mr. Siragusa, who speaks for parents the world
over.</TE>
<TE>   But curiosity got the best of the girls. They say skinny-dipping
isn't uncommon on the beach where Bridgett has lived for years,
hosting sleepovers with these same gal pals. Besides, they were in a
party mood. The girls went to elementary school together in the
Newport Beach area and were having a reunion after their first year
of college.</TE>
<TE>   So off they go down the beach, wearing their pajamas, according to
Maryann. The men were still in varying states of undress as the girls
approached, pulling makeshift rafts onto dry sand and removing dry
clothes from sacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Katie goes, 'What are you guys doing? It's cold and you're
naked,'" said Maryann. "They just looked at us and ignored us,
totally nonchalant."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a language barrier, they were probably speechless.
Imagine living in a culture of unchecked repression, finally escaping
by sea and landing nude in America, only to have college girls run
out to greet you. They must have thought they were in a beer
commercial.</TE>
<TE>   This curious hands-across- the-Pacific moment ended with the men
retreating to one of the trailer home decks to enjoy a cigarette
while overlooking these freedom shores. Little did they know it would
be their last puff, and that, having spent thousands of dollars on
this chance, having survived high seas and international smugglers,
if not pirates, they would not get past four Orange County beach
girls.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we saw they were not Americans, not from around here and not
talking to us, we thought, 'OK, something's going on,'" said
Bridgett. She went back home with her friends and rousted her father,
who called police.</TE>
<TE>   "At first we hesitated," said Maryann. "But our country's on
alert."</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, police and federal immigration officers scoured
the exclusive coastline all the way to Laguna Beach. Within four
hours, they'd caught all 10 of these guys, who now face deportation.</TE>
<TE>   We barely stop one in 10 who enter the country illegally from
Mexico, and in fact, we wink and look the other way because we like
cheap labor. But with these 10 Chinese guys, the posse was out in
force, and more efficient than ever.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure why that is. But beginning with their pinpoint
landing in the middle of El Morro Beach sorority night, these poor
refugees just couldn't seem to catch a break.</TE>
<TE>   Even the girls who ratted them out were feeling sorry for them
after hearing details of their risky journey to make a better life.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all of us feel a little guilty," said Maryann, who found
herself contemplating the relative riches of this country, and their
allure, as she never had.</TE>
<TE>   "Had they been doing something like drug trafficking, or if they'd
killed someone, I'd feel better," said Bridgett. "They tried so hard
to get over here, I feel horrible for them."</TE>
<TE>   It is a long way to travel for one cigarette on the beach, but
maybe they'll win political asylum. If not, others will follow, by
land, by sea, legally, illegally, bringing great gifts and great
burdens to Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Homeland of so few, destination of so many.</TE>

<HD>Creighton Miller, 79; Halfback for Notre Dame</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Creighton Miller, a former Notre Dame halfback and member of the
College Football Hall of Fame, has died. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Miller was found Friday morning by relatives at his apartment in
Shaker Heights, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb. The cause of death was not
immediately known. The Cuyahoga County coroner was to perform an
autopsy.</LD>
<LD>   Miller played at Notre Dame from 1941 to 1943. He was fourth in
Heisman Trophy balloting in 1943, leading the nation with 911 yards
rushing and scoring 13 touchdowns as the Fighting Irish won the
national championship.</LD>
<TE>   "Without question, he's one of the all-time greatest running backs
at Notre Dame," said John Heisler, the university's associate
athletic director. "In fact, Frank Leahy called him the best running
back he had ever coached."</TE>
<TE>   Miller's father, Harry "Red" Miller, was the Irish's 1908 team
captain. Four of his uncles also played at Notre Dame, including Don
Miller, one of the fabled Four Horsemen, and Ray T. Miller, who later
became mayor of Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Miller was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in
1976. He also was a member of the first Cleveland Browns' coaching
staff in 1946 before going to law school at Yale.</TE>
<TE>   In 1956, he agreed to help National Football League players form a
players association. A graduate of Yale Law School, he also practiced
law in Cleveland for years.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by a brother, Thomas of Atlanta; and a sister,
Maureen Weigant of Chicago.</TE>

<HD>Probe Finds Molina Broke Law Building Pool</HD>
<DH>Codes: The county supervisor and her husband had no permit
for the work, but are working to meet safety standards, officials
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles city investigation has established that county
Supervisor Gloria Molina and her husband broke the law by building a
swimming pool at their house in the Mount Washington district without
a permit.</LD>
<LD>   The couple are now working with authorities to ensure that the
pool meets city safety standards, city building officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation, triggered by a Times story, found that Molina
and her husband, Ronald L. Martinez, built their pool in 2000 without
obtaining required permits or paying city fees, said city Building
and Safety Department spokesman Robert Steinbach.</LD>
<TE>   The pool also lacked an adequate fence to protect children from
drowning, according to public documents.</TE>
<TE>   Molina and Martinez obtained the permits for the pool this month,
after being ordered to do so by the Building and Safety Department.
City records show the couple paid $567.98 in permit fees. No
penalties were levied.</TE>
<TE>   The department acted after The Times reported in April on the pool
and other illegal construction work at the hillside house.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbach said the department now considers Molina and Martinez to
be complying with the law, since they obtained permits and are
installing required safety equipment.</TE>
<TE>   No fines or penalties were charged because the couple "have been
very cooperative," Steinbach said. "We only assess penalties when we
need them as a tool to gain compliance."</TE>
<TE>   "Many people in L.A. do work and are unaware they need permits,"
he added.</TE>
<TE>   Molina, a county supervisor since 1991, also served for five years
on the Los Angeles City Council and for four years in the state
Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbach said the department expects Molina and Martinez to
finish modifying their pool area to meet safety requirements "within
a week."</TE>
<TE>   City laws require new pools to be enclosed by a fence or wall with
a self-closing gate to keep children from wandering into the pool.</TE>
<TE>   Molina's pool had been open on one side leading to a driveway
gate. A driveway gate is not a legal enclosure.</TE>
<TE>   The couple have installed a new gate to the pool to correct that
problem, and Steinbach said they are putting in a required alarm that
will sound if a door is opened.</TE>
<TE>   Molina and Martinez did not respond to interview requests.</TE>
<TE>   In an April interview, Martinez said he did not apply for building
and mechanical permits for the pool because his contractor told him
they were not required.</TE>
<TE>   He also said city inspectors who had visited his house to check
other remodeling work saw the pool and never mentioned that it might
be illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbach said permits are required if a pool is larger than 250
square feet and more than 2 feet deep. Molina's pool is 14 feet by 24
feet, or 336 square feet, and 4 feet deep, according to the permit
obtained this month.</TE>
<TE>   The value of the pool and deck is $7,376, according to the
permits.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbach said in April that the Building and Safety Department
learned of the pool only after being questioned by a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Department records, however, show that the agency received a
complaint about the pool in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbach said a department inspector examining a retaining wall
at the house performed "a cursory inspection" of the pool after the
complaint was made and thought it was small enough not to require a

<DH>Afghanistan: Former military, police officers tell
congressman they want to return to their nation to train others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dozens of former military and police officers who served under former
Afghan king Mohammad Zaher Shah gathered Saturday in Irvine to
discuss a possible return to their war-torn homeland to help rebuild
the nation's national security forces.</LD>
<LD>   The former officers, who traveled to Southern California from
throughout the United States, made their pitch to Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), saying they are the best-qualified
to train the next generation of soldiers and police.</LD>
<LD>   "We have the experience," said Col. Mohammad Naim Gardizi, 66, of
Plano, Texas, who served in the Afghan National Army for 25 years.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to go back to teach this army, organize the army and help
the American Army."</TE>
<TE>   About 50 officers attended Saturday's meeting and said they have
begun compiling a list of former soldiers who are ready to return.
That list includes about 360 in the United States, 200 in Pakistan
and about 200 in Australia, France and Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Before they can return, organizers of Saturday's meeting said, the
U.S. government should help guarantee their safety, and the
transitional government in Afghanistan should cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrabacher said he has discussed their proposal with members of
the National Security Council and will continue to lobby and make
phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to make sure we start drawing [the] attention of the
decision-makers to this very positive alternative," he said. "There
is great potential for good."</TE>
<TE>   Rohrabacher, considered a friend to Afghan Americans since his
days as a speechwriter for President Reagan, urged those at
Saturday's meeting to press for an end to the internal conflicts that
keep the country unstable.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a big question in the world's mind right now whether
[Afghans] can be as courageous at peace as they were at war," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The focus now is on the upcoming loya jirga, or grand assembly,
and the process of choosing the new leaders to replace the interim,
six-month government created with international backing as the
Taliban regime collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the officers in attendance Saturday support Zaher Shah,
87, who ruled the country for 40 years during its last peaceful
period.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the only one left that can put the country and different
tribes together," said organizer Ashraf Abasy of Laguna Niguel, a
former captain in the king's army.</TE>
<TE>   Abasy recalled the day he was sworn into the army.</TE>
<TE>   He placed his hand on the Koran and pledged that he would defend
the independence of Afghanistan, the constitution, the people and the
king.</TE>
<TE>   "That responsibility is still with me," Abasy said. "I swore under
oath and I stood loyal....We are officers. We have the responsibility
to help."</TE>

<HD>State's Deficit May Hurt Poor, Sick, Troubled</HD>
<DH>Budget: O.C. officials say foster care, drug
rehabilitation, adoption services face biggest cuts. Youth jobs
program was approved, then halted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County officials paint a grim portrait for what's in store if
they have to cope with their share of the state's estimated
$23.6-billion deficit and its effects on county programs and
services.</LD>
<LD>   After assessing budget numbers, executives from three
departments--social services, probation, and health care--said they
anticipate having to cut programs and halt new ones because of a
projected $64-million shortfall in state funding for the three
agencies.</LD>
<LD>   The departments account for nearly 45% of the county's
$4.2-billion budget.</LD>
<TE>   But Orange County's financial troubles pale next to those of Los
Angeles County, whose Department of Health Services is recommending
cutting more than 5,000 employees to cope with a health-care funding
deficit expected to total $688 million over three years.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the disparity is that Los Angeles County operates
six public hospitals. Orange County relies on a health-care system
that contracts with hospitals, physicians, and a network of community
clinics to serve people without health insurance who don't qualify
for other public programs.</TE>
<TE>   Details of Orange County's budget still are being worked out, but
some of the hardest-hit programs are expected to include foster care,
adoptions, summer-youth jobs, juvenile drug rehabilitation and
homeless services.</TE>
<TE>   County officials interviewed last week would not discuss the
potential for staff layoffs. The five-member Board of Supervisors has
wide discretion to downsize or eliminate programs, which they'll
consider doing when they hold budget talks next month.</TE>
<TE>   County Executive Officer Michael Schumacher has told some top
department officials he hopes to prevent job losses by handling
cutbacks through attrition.</TE>
<TE>   Larry M. Leaman, director of the county's Social Services Agency,
said the state's deficit means his department faces a $39-million
shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Balancing his department's budget and still providing services
will be one of the toughest challenges he has faced in more than two
decades in county government, Leaman said.</TE>
<TE>   Though Social Services has a $404-million budget, half of the
funding comes from federal and state governments for foster care and
welfare. Some funding is contingent on the state paying matching
funds, which Leaman doesn't anticipate receiving in the coming budget
cycle.</TE>
<TE>   The fallout already has begun. A summer youth jobs program in
Anaheim and Santa Ana was just approved. Because of the anticipated
shortfall, Leaman had to call a supervisor and order the program
halted.</TE>
<TE>   Other potential cuts in social services include:</TE>
<TE>   * Up to a 20% reduction of staff handling welfare-to-work
programs, food stamps, Medi-Cal and foster care.</TE>
<TE>   * A 10% reduction in Adult Protective Services.</TE>
<TE>   * A 30% reduction in adoption and family services.</TE>
<TE>   * Elimination of funding for home repairs and other services for
seniors and disabled persons.</TE>
<TE>   * Halting of cost-of-living increases to families receiving cash
benefits, including the aged, blind and disabled on Supplemental
Security Income.</TE>
<TE>   Probation Department officials anticipate an $11-million
shortfall. In some cases, that could mean fewer youths are kept in
custody, said Colleene Preciado, chief deputy probation officer.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the county has a 56-bed drug-treatment program at
Theo Lacy Branch Jail in Orange for 18-year-old males. They are wards
of the court who may have to be moved to Juvenile Hall in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   "In turn, that will mean returning others at Juvenile Hall back to
their homes because the wards have priority," Preciado said.</TE>
<TE>   Medi-Cal funding for mentally disturbed children may be reduced,
said Juliette A. Poulson, director of the county's Health Care
Agency. She said she expects to have to cut as much as $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the sad things here is that these cuts will affect the
most vulnerable people," said Gary Burton, the county's chief
financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not overreacting at this time," Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   CalOptima, which provides health-care funds for low-income
children, the elderly and disabled, will be tapping into $11 million
of its reserves to help cover an anticipated $20.8-million deficit.</TE>
<TE>   The remainder of the deficit will be covered by reducing payments
to service providers, such as hospitals and physicians, as well as
through administrative cutbacks.</TE>

<HD>Punishment for Killing Pumpkin Thief Is Tough Choice</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's always been obvious to me that Pete Solomona was guilty of
something. I never really understood the confusion over that; if
someone takes a loaded gun into the street to settle a score, puts it
near another person's head and it goes off, the resulting death
demands retribution.</LD>
<LD>   But while sure about the crime, I'm not at all about the
punishment.</LD>
<LD>   We can debate abstract concepts all we want about what Solomona
did the night of Oct. 18, 1999, when he shot and killed 17-year-old
Brandon Ketsdever. But now comes the concrete part.</LD>
<TE>   Solomona is probably going to prison.</TE>
<TE>   This previously law-abiding citizen who lost it in the span of
just a few minutes suddenly finds himself in a position he probably
never would have imagined. Freedom is going to become a memory, not a
given.</TE>
<TE>   Talks with his family will be scheduled, not spontaneous. His new
circle of acquaintances will be inmates.</TE>
<TE>   The world Solomona knew is staying behind. It's just him that's
going away.</TE>
<TE>   I don't say that with the slightest satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   At his third trial last week, Solomona was convicted of voluntary
manslaughter, which may be as close to the truth as a jury of
non-psychics could get.</TE>
<TE>   It was impossible to know exactly what was in Solomona's mind when
he took his .357 magnum into the street to confront Ketsdever and two
friends as they sat in their car, fatefully blocked by another car
outside Solomona's house.</TE>
<TE>   Not long before, the boys had swiped a plastic pumpkin decoration
from Solomona's front porch, a theft that angered him and, if he is
to be believed, made him feel threatened. In his ensuing
confrontation with Ketsdever, who was behind the wheel, Solomona's
gun went off and a bullet struck Ketsdever in the head and injured a
passenger.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the story broke, it became a public Rorschach test.
Some condemned Solomona; others just as angrily said the boys created
the situation by stealing the pumpkin and that Solomona wasn't guilty
of anything.</TE>
<TE>   The jury that convicted him last week agreed with the previous
two--it didn't think Solomona intended to kill Ketsdever. The first
guilty verdict was thrown out on a technicality, and the second jury
couldn't reach a unanimous decision.</TE>
<TE>   So, up to now, the public interest in the case has centered on
whether he was guilty of anything.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes the real ball game. This summer, Superior Court Judge
Richard F. Toohey will decide how much of the 11-year maximum
sentence he should give Solomona, 50.</TE>
<TE>   Good luck, judge.</TE>
<TE>   At times like this, I'm glad I went into the news business instead
of the judicial business. If the judge has some magic formula to
figure this one out, I'd love to hear what it is.</TE>
<TE>   Most likely, it'll come down to a feeling in his gut.</TE>
<TE>   He'll replay what he thinks Solomona was thinking, just as he
weighs what society should demand for the death of a 17-year-old high
school student shot over a petty theft.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution wanted too much--a second-degree murder conviction
with a possible life sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, I'm clueless. No strong gut feeling here.</TE>
<TE>   We toss out numbers--one year, five years, six, eight--as if it's
some kind of scintillating "Wheel of Fortune" game.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine yourself in prison. The difference between two years and
seven, for example, is no small thing. This ain't a game show.</TE>
<TE>   The Ketsdever family wanted the book thrown at Solomona.
Understandable--Brandon is gone forever. Understandable--but it
doesn't feel right in this case.</TE>
<TE>   My job entitles me to offer up an opinion on the sentence, if only
to provoke conversation. But I'm not going to con you--I don't have a
number.</TE>
<TE>   The easy part was deciding Solomona committed a crime.</TE>
<TE>   The next part is way too tough for me.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A murder trial for accused killer and serial rapist Vincent Sanchez
has been delayed at the request of defense lawyers, who intend to
challenge the manner in which the case has been filed.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez, a 31-year-old Simi Valley handyman, is accused of fatally
shooting a Moorpark College student last year during a rape attempt.
He is charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping and attempted
rape. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez is also charged with crimes related to assaults on several
other women. He has not entered pleas.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, Deputy Public Defender Neil Quinn argued that his
client should not have to answer the charges because prosecutors
improperly specified the degree of murder in the felony complaint.
But Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley found nothing wrong
with the document.</TE>

$2,700 Saturday, police reported.</LD>
<LD>   The robber, wearing a black leather baseball cap and a black
leather jacket, walked into the Newport Avenue branch of Union Bank
shortly after 9 a.m., according to Tustin police.</LD>
<LD>   The man instructed a teller to remain calm and to take the money
from her cash drawer and put it in an envelope, which she did. He
took the note and the envelope and apparently made his getaway on
foot in an unknown direction, police said. No weapon was seen.</LD>

<HD>Sanchez to Ask for Dismissal</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A murder trial for accused killer and serial rapist Vincent Sanchez
has been delayed at the request of defense lawyers, who intend to
challenge the manner in which the case has been filed.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez, a Simi Valley handyman, is accused of fatally shooting
Moorpark College student Megan Barroso last year. He is charged with
first-degree murder, kidnapping and attempted rape. Prosecutors are
seeking the death penalty.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez, 31, is also charged with crimes related to assaults on
several other women. He has not entered pleas.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, Deputy Public Defender Neil Quinn argued that his
client should not have to answer the charges because prosecutors
improperly specified the degree of murder in the felony complaint.
But Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley found nothing wrong
with the document.</TE>
<TE>   Riley then asked if Sanchez was ready to enter pleas, but Quinn
said the defense plans to file a motion to dismiss the charges on
separate grounds. Quinn contends that prosecutors erred when filing
the charges after an earlier indictment in the case was vacated.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez agreed to waive his right to a jury trial through
mid-September.</TE>

<HD>Earl V. Shaffer, 83; First to Walk Entire Length of the
Appalachian Trail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Appalachian Trail was completed in 1937, its creators never
envisioned that anyone would ever have the audacity, desire or
toughness to hike all 2,100 miles at one time.</LD>
<LD>   The trail was intended for day outings or maybe a weeklong trip.
It was inconceivable that anyone--even the most enthusiastic
hiker--would want to spend that much time in the woods.</LD>
<LD>   And, for a long time, trail organizers were right. That is, until
1948, when a dispirited World War II veteran and aspiring poet
stepped on the path in northern Georgia in April and didn't stop
walking until he reached the imposing summit of Mt. Katahdin in Maine
four months later.</LD>
<TE>   Earl V. Shaffer, the first person to walk the entire length of the
Appalachian Trail, died May 5 in Lebanon, Pa., of cancer. He was 83.</TE>
<TE>   Shaffer through-hiked the AT, as hikers call it, three times. In
addition to his pioneering effort, he went the distance in 1965--when
he traveled north-to-south, the unconventional way of doing it--and
again in 1998, at the age of 79.</TE>
<TE>   In doing so, Shaffer helped usher in the era of long-distance
hiking and proved it's still possible to disappear for extended
stretches into what remains of the American wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   "What I find most amazing about Earl's three hikes is that he
never took a day off," said Dave Donaldson, a Washington, D.C.,
teacher and hiker who is working on a biography of Shaffer.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're talking about being on a trail for months at a time,
[this] is analogous to what Cal Ripken did in baseball. It's just
stunning."</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1918, Shaffer was raised with his three brothers and a
sister on the small family farm outside York, Pa. He spent most of
his time outside, working the neighbor's spread in summer and
trapping in the winter.</TE>
<TE>   "We were living pretty much a pioneer life back in the 1930s,"
said John Shaffer, Earl's younger brother, who lives in York. "It was
the Depression. We didn't have a lot, and we got by with what we
had."</TE>
<TE>   In 1941, on the day after the family home was wired for
electricity, Shaffer joined the Army. He spent the next 31/2 years
with the Signal Corps in the South Pacific, building radar towers as
U.S. forces island-hopped toward Japan. It was unnerving, tiring
work--with the unarmed corps sometimes coming under enemy fire.</TE>
<TE>   Shaffer kicked around after the war, haunted by the loss of his
longtime best friend, who was killed at Iwo Jima. One night in 1947,
he was flipping through Outdoor Life magazine when he read a blurb
about the Appalachian Trail to his brother. "It said no one had ever
hiked the entire trail in one season," John Shaffer said. "And that's
how it started."</TE>
<TE>   The hike in 1948 was no cakewalk. The trail was poorly marked and
maintained, and Shaffer, without adequate trail maps, often veered
miles off course. While Shaffer was on his hike, the Appalachian
Trailway News--unaware of his attempt--published an article listing
10 reasons why no one would ever do the entire trail.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as now, the trail wound through the hollows and atop the
ridges of the thickly forested Smokies, Shenandoahs and Whites. The
AT also crossed or followed hundreds of roads, where Shaffer could
resupply at homesteads or tiny villages--many of which would quietly
vanish in the subsequent decades.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Shaffer completed the trail in 123 days, beginning in
April and finishing in August. He averaged 17 miles a day.</TE>
<TE>   And, when he returned home, few believed he did it.</TE>
<TE>   "When Earl sent his report in it was met with disbelief and
skepticism and everything else," said Brian King of the Appalachian
Trail Conference, the group that oversees trail issues. "The editor
of our magazine at the time literally cross-examined him for 31/2
hours in her office. But he had all the records, notes and
photographs."</TE>
<TE>   He spent years writing and rewriting a memoir of his 1948 hike
titled "Walking With Spring," which he finally self-published three
decades later. He also wrote thousands of poems, most of which have
never been published.</TE>
<TE>   Shaffer eventually settled on a six-acre spread in the late 1980s
in tiny Idaville, Pa., living in a cabin that was once a chicken
coop. He sold and refurbished antiques and occasionally clerked at
auctions. His barn was full of odds and ends, including three
Volkswagen buses and 13 VW engines. He never had a steady job--he
never needed one--nor did he marry.</TE>
<TE>   Many considered him a recluse, and the longer he was gone, the
more his legend grew. Occasionally, Shaffer would pop onto the trail
for a day or two, bending the ear of through-hikers willing to listen
to his tales. Then, in 1998, on the 50th anniversary of his first
through-hike, Shaffer decided to do it again. Over the years the
trail had been rerouted, having been pushed deeper into the woods
with many more ups and downs. The modern Appalachian Trail resembled
a 2,000-mile tunnel of trees.</TE>
<TE>   "They call it a scenic trail, but you don't see a lot of scenery,"
said a rueful Shaffer, who was extremely critical of the changes.</TE>
<TE>   Even at 79, his methods didn't change. He carried a military
rucksack from the '30s, a tarp and sleeping bag. No tent or camping
stove. To avoid blisters, he never wore socks.</TE>
<TE>   The hike became a media event, with reporters often joining
Shaffer for stretches. The publicity, in turn, helped fuel a boom in
through-hiking on the trail and its equally difficult western
counterpart, the 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail, which extends from
the Mexican border through the mountains of California, Oregon and
Washington to Canada.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, for example, about 2,375 tried to complete the
Appalachian Trail. About 10% quit before finishing the first 30
miles. But 545 or so made it--a few of whom turned around and started
walking the other way, unable to stop their momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Precisely what motivated Shaffer remains something of a mystery.
Those who knew him say he deeply loved nature and relished a
challenge. He was also introverted and shy.</TE>
<TE>   "When you stop and think about it, there had to be a first
through-hiker, and in a lot of ways he shaped the people who would
literally come in his footsteps," said Bill O'Brien, a Connecticut
newspaper editor and fellow hiker.</TE>
<TE>   "These are individuals to the core who are able to accomplish a
great deal with very little. Earl basically lived a through-hiker's
life his entire life. Very solitary, very spartan, but by the same
token very fulfilling."</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of his 1998 hike, Shaffer, 79, woke up one autumn
morning after spending the night in a shelter on Spaulding Mountain
in Maine. The temperature had plummeted below freezing. Snow was
flying, the wind howling.</TE>
<TE>   Shaffer peered outside from his sleeping bag. He turned to Dave
Donaldson, his hiking partner, and said "I can't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, perhaps out of habit, he began packing up his
belongings. With little hesitation, Shaffer stepped into the harsh
elements of New England and began the long trudge north.</TE>
<TE>   Again.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his brother John, Shaffer is survived by two other
brothers, Daniel of York, Pa., and Evan of Greenfield, S.C.; and a
sister, Anna Shaffer Miller, also of York.</TE>
<TE>   Donations in Earl Shaffer's name can be made to the Salvation
Army.</TE>

<HD>In Sierra Nevada, Snow Wonder</HD>
<DH>Weather: Late-season dump of 4 to 16 inches surprises
campers. But all roads are open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Early in the morning one day last week, a few sleepy campers poked
their heads out of their tents in the Big Pine Creek campground and
got the Sierra Nevada's equivalent of a pie in the face.</LD>
<LD>   Snow. Although the sun was shining and the temperature was a
pleasant 35 degrees, flakes were coming down hard. A mile farther up
Big Pine Creek Canyon, the jagged peaks of the Sierra were completely
shrouded in clouds.</LD>
<LD>   The storm packed more of a punch than forecasters anticipated.
Four to 16 inches fell on much of the high country, making it one of
the latest and largest spring dumps to hit the region in the last few
years.</LD>
<TE>   With the holiday weekend approaching, the weather left many of the
locals puzzling over which way the season would go--back to winter or
forward to summer.</TE>
<TE>   "All the campgrounds that are supposed to be open for the weekend
are open, and it has warmed up enough in most places to melt most of
it," said Nancy Upham, spokeswoman for the Inyo National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   In Yosemite National Park, California 140 is open again, after a
12-foot boulder rolled across and forced its closure. Glacier Point
Road is open. Tioga Pass Road was cleared by Friday, much to the
relief of tourists and merchants who use it to cross the mountain
range.</TE>
<TE>   According to the California Department of Transportation, all of
the trans-Sierra highways are now open, including the hair-raisingly
steep California 108 through Sonora Pass.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasts by the National Weather Service called for partly cloudy
skies and daytime temperatures in the 60s and 70s in the Sierra this
weekend, with a chance of rain in the north today and Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Sierra snowpack is still below average in most
places, the storm had a few beneficiaries. Mammoth Mountain had
planned to end its skiing season Monday, but with a foot of new
powder the resort will remain open until June 2. It's a far cry from
1995, when Mammoth didn't close until Aug. 13--it received a foot of
snow in a June storm that year--but it still means Mammoth will be
the last California ski resort to close this season.</TE>
<TE>   Also benefiting are the waterfalls in the Yosemite Valley. Scott
Gediman, park spokesman, said all the falls were "just incredible"
and were reaching peak flows just in time for the gaggles of park
visitors who descend on the valley for the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Gediman and forest service officials also intoned their usual
warning for this time of year. All visitors to the Sierra,
particularly those heading into the back country, should be wary of
high stream crossings and slippery rocks surrounding creeks and
rivers.</TE>
<TE>   Park officials also said the snow did not drive black bears back
into hibernation in Yosemite or Sequoia and Kings Canyon national
parks. Au contraire, the always-hungry bears are keenly aware of
thousands of weenie-filled coolers being wheeled into the hills. Park
rules require that food be properly stored at all times.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the storm's luckiest victims were at Lake Edison, located
at the end of steep, single-lane Kaiser Pass Road, which was closed
for 21/2 days after the snow. That meant visitors to Vermilion Valley
Resort were, for lack of a better phrase, stuck there.</TE>
<TE>   "It was gorgeous. I was loving every minute of it," said Sarah
Muzquiz, the resort's general manager. "A few of us just sat inside
by the fire, had coffee and watched it snow."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a pair of anglers stayed outside, not minding the
17-degree temperature while reeling in one big trout after another.
On the cusp of another busy summer in the Sierra, they had the place
entirely to themselves.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At the site of the Hall of Justice, life and death have been meted
out for more than a century to a who's who of Los Angeles' famous and
felonious.</LD>
<LD>   The imposing edifice, bounded by Broadway, Spring and Temple
streets, has been the scene of sensational trials and the temporary
address of depraved criminals. Murderer Charles Manson pronounced the
accommodations "Stone Age." But an earlier guest, mobster Benjamin
"Bugsy" Siegel, rated better service: He was permitted to leave on
chauffeured excursions to lunch and to visit his barber.</LD>
<LD>   In 1944, a crowd of Latinos cried and cheered as a dozen
"zoot-suiters" walked out free men, after their tainted convictions
in the "Sleepy Lagoon" murder trial were overturned.</LD>
<TE>   Robert Mitchum was jailed here in 1947 for marijuana possession.
The press photographed the obliging actor in a variety of poses, such
as mopping his cellblock floor.</TE>
<TE>   And it was here, in the basement morgue, that Marilyn Monroe's
body was autopsied in 1962, after she committed suicide at 36.</TE>
<TE>   The site was known for law, order and disorder long before the
$6.5-million Hall of Justice opened in 1926.</TE>
<TE>   In 1870, a midday shootout left half of the city's eight-man
police force dead or wounded, among them William Crossman Warren, the
city's only police chief to die in the line of duty. The killer went
free--in part because he was one of the department's own, angry over
an unpaid bounty fee.</TE>
<TE>   One of the darkest episodes involving the site came Oct. 24, 1871,
after a white man was killed and another wounded in cross-fire
between two rival Chinese tongs.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours, a white and Latino mob besieged and looted the
Chinese quarter, killing 18 people. Some of them were hanged at the
hall's site, which was then a lumberyard and corral where Angelenos
often did their lynchings.</TE>
<TE>   Eight men were found guilty, but their convictions were overturned
because of a flaw in the indictments. They were never retried.</TE>
<TE>   At those gallows, 35 lynchings took place over two
decades--including that of L.A.'s most notorious outlaw, Juan Flores.</TE>
<TE>   But eventually, the gallows gave way to one of the most lavish,
lucrative and genteel prostitution businesses in Los Angeles: Pearl
Morton's bordello.</TE>
<TE>   Charity for All and Malice Toward None</TE>
<TE>   She ran it around the turn of the century with the full knowledge
and even the patronage of the law: Her landlord was Deputy Sheriff
Juan Murrieta (for whom Murrieta Hot Springs in Riverside County is
named). Her charity for all and malice toward none made her L.A.'s
most beloved and respected madam--at least by men.</TE>
<TE>   By 1891, a new red sandstone courthouse anchored the growing Civic
Center, built on what was colloquially known as Pound Cake Hill by
Americans and Loma de las Mariposas--Hill of Butterflies--by Latinos.
The courthouse was conveniently located across the street from
Morton's brothel, where judges and attorneys were known to take long
coffee breaks.</TE>
<TE>   The Hall of Justice was built in 1925 and opened for business in
1926. But before construction could begin, six horses and some
muscle-bound men had to drag the 11,000-ton Alhambra Hotel 130 feet
to the north to make room.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the Italian Renaissance facade of white granite, the hall's
14 floors housed courtrooms, 520 double cells, and offices for the
district attorney, public defender, sheriff and coroner. Sensational
trials filled those courtrooms: actors Errol Flynn and Charlie
Chaplin in sex and paternity cases; a perjuring district attorney
named Buron Fitts; the controversial death penalty trial of "Red
Light Bandit" Caryl Chessman; and Sirhan Sirhan, convicted of
assassinating Robert F. Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, desperate inmates tried to escape. Many succeeded,
though most were quickly recaptured. A few even fell to their deaths
by trying to rappel down the granite walls with ropes fashioned from
blankets.</TE>
<TE>   Manson dangled a wire from his cell window and tried to smuggle in
marijuana and a hacksaw.</TE>
<TE>   In 1931, Clara Phillips, the "Tiger Woman" convicted of killing
her husband's lover, had better luck with a hacksaw smuggled in by a
love-struck courtroom admirer. She was recaptured and spent 12 years
in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Judges escaped the building's confines by crossing Broadway and
ascending Bunker Hill via Court Flight. Twin 14-passenger wooden
cable cars climbed a 200-foot grade to the judges' private club, a
50-room Victorian mansion that once was home to mining tycoon Lewis
Leonard Bradbury.</TE>
<TE>   Even a Role in Harold Lloyd Comedies</TE>
<TE>   Filmmaker Hal Roach rented it for one-reel Harold Lloyd comedies,
including "Just Nuts" (1915) and "Haunted Spooks" (1920). Its big,
drafty spaces led Lloyd to call it "pneumonia hall." The mansion was
torn down for parking, and Court Flight was dismantled in 1944.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the 1950s, sheriff's officials faced a persistent
problem in the basement crime vault: Mice were eating the marijuana
seized as evidence. Cats were imported, to no avail. "Those mice are
addicts," one official said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, rodents, inmates and Saturday workers all shook when a
time bomb exploded on the sixth floor next to Los Angeles County
Dist. Atty. Evelle Younger's office. No one was injured, but a
bathroom and a flight of stairs were destroyed. Younger stepped up
security, calling the incident "not a very friendly act." In either
an impulse of civic duty or a creative escape attempt, an inmate told
officials that his Black Panther cellmate was involved in the
bombing. Today, a framed memorandum identifying the suspect hangs on
a wall in the Sheriff's Department explosives unit, but no one was
ever prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the mayhem outside the hall overshadowed the drama
within.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, Manson's female followers held a daily vigil during
his trial. They shaved their heads and carved Xs into their
foreheads.</TE>
<TE>   Passersby paused in awe as daredevil Evel Knievel--who had been
sentenced to spend six months in the county lockup for attacking a
television executive with a baseball bat--was picked up in a
chauffeured Stutz. After working all day, he would return to his cell
in the evening. When he was released--the same day as 20 other
inmates--he ordered individual limos that lined Spring Street.</TE>
<TE>   The gradual departure from the Hall of Justice began in 1971, when
the district attorney and public defender's office and municipal and
superior courts relocated across the street to the Criminal Courts
Building (recently renamed the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal
Justice Building).</TE>
<TE>   The coroner's office followed the next year, moving to its present
location on Mission Road. In 1993, the Sheriff's Department left for
a modern compound in the San Gabriel Valley.</TE>
<TE>   And in 1994, after the Northridge earthquake, the Hall of Justice
was red-tagged as unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   Today, darkened and empty, the hall is like a ghost waiting to be
brought back to life. Chandeliers hang above tarnished bronze
staircases. Graffiti scars the walls and paint flakes from the
ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors recently chose a
private entity, Hall of Justice Associates, to design and restore the
building for about $127 million. In exchange, the county is pursuing
a complicated long-term lease arrangement that would eventually cover
the cost.</TE>
<TE>   After the restoration is complete--expected in 2005--Sheriff Lee
Baca hopes to relocate his office and staff from a quiet hillside
compound in Monterey Park to Los Angeles' political hub.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the Hall of Justice is vacant of everything but
its vivid past.</TE>

<HD>Wealthy Enclave Billed $54,000 to Clear Brush</HD>
<DH>Fire safety: Thousand Oaks homeowners contend the developer
was responsible for cleaning up hillsides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the June 1 deadline for clearing weeds near homes approaches, the
Ventura County tax collector has levied a special $49,000 assessment
against a Thousand Oaks homeowners' association in a neighborhood of
million-dollar estates abutting a volatile fire zone.</LD>
<LD>   The homeowners' group failed to clear weeds and brush around the
38-home luxury Westlake subdivision last June, so the Fire Department
brought in its own clearance crew at a cost of $48,601.50.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a very high-hazard area, and they simply didn't do the
clearing," said county Fire Marshal Diane Morgan. "There's a dispute
between the homeowners' association and the developer as to who is
responsible. But my contention is that's a civil issue between the
two of them."</LD>
<TE>   At issue is who should have cleared the slopes and hillsides on
the rugged 16-acre perimeter of Bridgehaven Estates, a tract of
custom homes tucked in a canyon behind a security gate off Potrero
Road near Lake Sherwood.</TE>
<TE>   An anti-fire law, enforced mostly on city edges, requires property
owners to clear high grass, weeds and brush within 100 feet of
structures.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks officials extended that buffer to 200 feet at
Bridgehaven Estates because surrounding ridges are so combustible,
and because the cloistered subdivision has only one street in and out
of it.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, one of the worst fires in county history--the 38,000-acre
Green Meadow blaze--charred hills nearby in 1993, destroying dozens
of homes in an arson blaze that roared from Thousand Oaks to the
Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Owners of about 17,000 parcels were notified of weed problems last
year in Ventura County, with many in the fast-growing hilly areas of
the east county. All but 104 either took care of the abatement within
a 30-day period or filed appeals to the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Bridgehaven Estates did neither. And it stands out because its
steep levy represents 30% of the $164,000 the county tax assessor
charged 104 owners in special taxes last month.</TE>
<TE>   The $49,000 Bridgehaven assessment increased to $54,000 after
homeowners failed to pay the assessment by the April 10 deadline and
were hit with a 10% penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "[The assessment is] the largest in my tenure," veteran Fire
Marshal Morgan said. "Usually it's in the hundreds of dollars or
$2,000 or $3,000."</TE>
<TE>   Hallie Blau, vice president of the Bridgehaven board, said
homeowners did not clear the brush last year because they thought it
was the responsibility of builder Pacific Heritage Development of
Irvine, owned by Gary R. Emsiek.</TE>
<TE>   Emsiek's attorney did not return telephone calls last week.</TE>
<TE>   Although the subdivision sold out about two years ago, Blau said
the builder never met several conditions in its development agreement
with the city of Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   The principal problem, she said, was that common areas were left
in disrepair.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, Pacific Heritage had not completed the 100-foot
irrigated vegetation break that was a required part of the buffer
zone. And when a dispute erupted about ownership of the water meters
and sprinkling system that was about 90% complete two years ago, the
water was shut off and vegetation died.</TE>
<TE>   It was not until after the Fire Department cleared the brush last
summer, that homeowners became aware that the developer had
transferred title of the buffer zone to the homeowners association in
June 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Blau said the board was not notified of the transfer, and
homeowners challenge the validity of the transfer.</TE>
<TE>   "We never knew we owned that common area," she said. "We were
waiting for the city of Thousand to sign off on the tract conditions.
Now the city is trying to act on our behalf to solve these issues
with the developer. We're in the process of possibly mediating some
of these issues."</TE>
<TE>   The homeowners are also looking for city help in dealing with the
$54,000 the association owes the tax collector.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge assessment," Blau said, "and if we're asked to pay
that, I'd hope the city would help resolve that with the developer.
We've been looking to the city to get these issues resolved for over
a year."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Metrovitsch, a city planning manager, said the city has had
problems getting Pacific Heritage to complete improvements in the
project, and that bonds posted to guarantee completion have also been
a problem.</TE>
<TE>   But as homeowners await the result of mediation, they have hired a
crew to clear the grass and weeds that have accumulated over the last
year to meet a June 1 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   The bill this time: $6,500.</TE>

<HD>Vietnamese Seniors' Hopes Lost in Isolation, Poverty</HD>
<DH>Culture: Many elderly immigrants may be estranged from
their children and do not speak enough English to connect with
American neighbors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN and SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bach Van Nguyen, 92, has reconciled himself to his loneliness. His
wife is dead and the mistress who once came between them is gone. He
doesn't get along with his adult children in Florida and rarely
speaks to them.</LD>
<LD>   His most constant companion is a plastic yellow bird, bought for
$8, that chirps at the sound of his voice in a nearly empty Garden
Grove studio apartment.</LD>
<LD>   "The bird likes to talk to me," Nguyen says gleefully. "When I
cough, switch on the light, cook or clean the dishes, it likes to
sing along. ... I really enjoy this bird. We've become friends."</LD>
<TE>   This is not the existence Nguyen and other elderly Vietnamese
envisioned when they left their homeland for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Although many fled the communist regime after U.S. troops pulled
out in 1975, others came later, hoping to live out their years in the
embrace of their expatriate families following the Vietnamese
tradition of extended "roof" families.</TE>
<TE>   Many have since stumbled into isolation and poverty, unable to
work or speak enough English to connect with American life around
them, especially when compared with their Spanish or English-speaking
peers, according to a recent "Condition of Older Adults 2002" study
by the Orange County Interagency Committee on Aging.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is pronounced in Orange County, home to the largest
Vietnamese population in the nation--about 135,500--but likely is
repeated in San Jose, which also has a significant concentration of
Vietnamese immigrants. About 78,000 Vietnamese live in Los Angeles
County.</TE>
<TE>   Many older Vietnamese who don't speak English aren't aware of
social programs--from meals to transportation--that can connect them
with others, said Pamela M. Mokler, director of the Orange County
Office on Aging.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, the agency has stepped up outreach efforts
through Vietnamese-language pamphlets, an (800) 510-2020 help line
with translators, an information van that appears at Vietnamese
gatherings such as the annual Tet Festival, and by drawing together
community leaders for suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   Agency officials intend to turn to Vietnamese-language radio to
reach Vietnamese seniors, who overwhelmingly rely on radio for
information.</TE>
<TE>   The isolation is born of more than language barriers. There are
cultural walls to scale, as well. Many Vietnamese seniors are
satisfied with their living conditions--despite the poverty--because
life here is easier for them than in Vietnam, Mokler said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of them came here as political refugees who have a hard
time communicating what their needs are because they are so grateful
for what they have," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the figures reveal deep poverty. Nearly two-thirds of
Vietnamese-speaking seniors--62%--were living in poverty, compared to
37% for Spanish speakers and 4.5% for English speakers. The study,
conducted by researchers at Cal State Fullerton and Chapman
University, surveyed 1,035 seniors.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that only 16.8% of Vietnamese-speaking seniors
owned their own homes, compared with 28.3% for Spanish speakers and
80.6% for English speakers.</TE>
<TE>   While 37% of the English speakers tended to live alone, 13.6% of
the Vietnamese speakers did. Only 10% of Spanish speakers lived
alone.</TE>
<TE>   But even Vietnamese seniors living with their children and other
family members encounter isolation as traditions fragment under the
transition to American lifestyles.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of them have to live with their family, but they feel a loss
of pride and respect because the youths don't follow traditions and
they speak mostly English," said Kathy T. Diep, founder of the
Asian-American Senior Citizen Assn. in Westminster.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the elderly are pushed away and placed in nursing homes.
So they see their situations as shameful."</TE>
<TE>   The result is a loose community of isolated seniors, many of whom
gather daily at markets and coffee shops along the strip malls of
Little Saigon to shop and seek human connections.</TE>
<TE>   "The seniors who are here often get depressed and they can't
express it," Diep said, adding that linguistic isolation is the
biggest contributor to loneliness.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the sense that each time they step out of their doorstep,
they don't know the roads, they can't easily get anywhere because
everything is spread out and they can't drive, so they're completely
dependent on others for simple activities each day."</TE>
<TE>   For Duc Thi Nguyen, there's no family around. Nguyen, 75, who is
not related to Bach Nguyen, rises each morning and prays before a
small Buddhist altar she has erected in her Santa Ana kitchen, then
leaves about 9 a.m. to catch a bus to Little Saigon, where she shops
and has lunch. Some days she goes to a gym to exercise, or to the
Chua Dieu Quang temple in Santa Ana to pray and decorate altars.</TE>
<TE>   What she really seeks is a human touch, a connection to the world
outside herself.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen immigrated in 1989 at age 62--a dozen years after her
husband died--to be closer to her three grown children. She moved
into a Mission Viejo home with her children, but the reunion only
lasted six months before the children moved on to jobs in San Jose
and Chicago. Nguyen decided to stay in Southern California, moving to
a Santa Ana neighborhood at the edge of Little Saigon.</TE>
<TE>   "I love my children and I know they love me, but they are busy
with their work far away and their families. That's how it is here in
America," Nguyen said. "I want to live here [in Little Saigon] where
there are many older people like me, and it eases the loneliness."</TE>
<TE>   Home is a one-bedroom apartment in a low-income housing project.
Nguyen lives on $750 a month in Social Security, paying $200 for
rent, about $200 for food and another $100 for utility, trash and
phone bills.</TE>
<TE>   "Half of the bills I pay go to my high electricity bill, because I
turn on the television, radio and all my lights to keep the apartment
from seeming dark and lonely when I get home, especially in the
evenings," Nguyen said.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen plans out her days the way she planned her immigration.
When she left Vietnam, she brought sacred soil and water from the
National Ancestral Temple in the northern Vinh Phu province. She
hopes to be buried with them, a little bit of Vietnam to join her in
American soil.</TE>
<TE>   "I have my visa and passport and now I'm just on the waiting list
for my turn to go to heaven," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bach Nguyen also is philosophical about the final years of his
life. At 92, he doesn't expect to live much longer, but is grateful
he's healthy enough to live on his own.</TE>
<TE>   "Living by yourself, there are chores you have to do like
vacuuming, ironing your clothes and laundry that can get to be
cumbersome," Nguyen said, adding that he has become set in his ways
and enjoys his isolation despite waves of loneliness. Nguyen seldom
has visitors and doesn't know his neighbors' names.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to live by myself because I feel so much more at peace,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen receives $829 a month in Social Security. He says his needs
are few and he's able to get by. Rent is $186 a month, and he budgets
$100 each for the telephone bill and food, plus expenses such as car
insurance. There's a cot by the front window where he naps, a plastic
table and toy stools where he takes his meals; the table is covered
with papers and files.</TE>
<TE>   A blue tarp covers part of the floor where he parks the electric
wheelchair that is his primary mode of transportation. When he needs
groceries--about once a week--he drives his 1986 Toyota Corolla to a
store about a mile away.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen has family, but they are estranged. When Saigon fell,
Nguyen's wife and their three children escaped. He stayed behind to
be with his mistress. Nguyen reunited with his family in Florida in
1986, and cared for his diabetic wife until her death a year later,
then chose to live out his life alone.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't live an entirely upstanding life," he said. "There is
pain in my heart from all the events that happened in my life, my
family estranged, and now that I'm far from my village and country."</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen doesn't like to think of his homeland, where nostalgia
overrides memories of even more dire poverty. "Living here, I have
everything I need," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But when I remember my village, my country, that's when I start
to cry."</TE>

<TE>   Many have since stumbled into isolation and poverty, unable to
work or speak enough English to connect with American life around
them, especially when compared with their Spanish- or
English-speaking peers, according to a recent "Condition of Older
Adults 2002" study by the Orange County Interagency Committee on
Aging.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is pronounced in Orange County, home to the largest
Vietnamese population in the nation--about 135,500--but likely is
repeated in San Jose, which also has a significant concentration of
Vietnamese immigrants. About 78,000 Vietnamese live in Los Angeles
County.</TE>
<TE>   Many older Vietnamese who don't speak English aren't aware of
social programs--from meals to transportation--that can connect them
with others, said Pamela M. Mokler, director of the Orange County
Office on Aging.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, the agency has stepped up outreach efforts
through Vietnamese-language pamphlets, an (800) 510-2020 help line
with translators, an information van that appears at Vietnamese
gatherings such as the annual Tet Festival, and by drawing together
community leaders for suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   Agency officials intend to turn to Vietnamese-language radio to
reach Vietnamese seniors, who overwhelmingly rely on radio for
information.</TE>
<TE>   The isolation is born of more than language barriers. There are
cultural walls to scale, as well. Many Vietnamese seniors are
satisfied with their living conditions--despite the poverty--because
life here is easier for them than in Vietnam, Mokler said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of them came here as political refugees who have a hard
time communicating what their needs are because they are so grateful
for what they have," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the figures reveal deep poverty. Nearly two-thirds of
Vietnamese-speaking seniors--62%--were living in poverty, compared
with 37% for Spanish speakers and 4.5% for English speakers. The
study, conducted by researchers at Cal State Fullerton and Chapman
University, surveyed 1,035 seniors.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that only 16.8% of Vietnamese-speaking seniors
owned their own homes, compared with 28.3% for Spanish speakers and
80.6% for English speakers.</TE>
<TE>   While 37% of the English speakers tended to live alone, 13.6% of
the Vietnamese speakers did. Only 10% of Spanish speakers lived
alone.</TE>
<TE>   But even Vietnamese seniors living with their children and other
family members encounter isolation as traditions fragment under the
transition to American lifestyles.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of them have to live with their family, but they feel a loss
of pride and respect because the youths don't follow traditions and
they speak mostly English," said Kathy T. Diep, founder of the
Asian-American Senior Citizen Assn. in Westminster.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the elderly are pushed away and placed in nursing homes.
So they see their situations as shameful."</TE>
<TE>   The result is a loose community of isolated seniors, many of whom
gather daily at markets and coffee shops along the strip malls of
Little Saigon to shop and seek human connections.</TE>
<TE>   "The seniors who are here often get depressed and they can't
express it," Diep said, adding that linguistic isolation is the
biggest contributor to loneliness.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the sense that each time they step out of their doorstep,
they don't know the roads, they can't easily get anywhere because
everything is spread out and they can't drive, so they're completely
dependent on others for simple activities each day."</TE>
<TE>   For Duc Thi Nguyen, there's no family around. Nguyen, 75, who is
not related to Bach Nguyen, rises each morning and prays before a
small Buddhist altar she has erected in her Santa Ana kitchen, then
leaves about 9 a.m. to catch a bus to Little Saigon, where she shops
and has lunch. Some days she goes to a gym or to the Chua Dieu Quang
temple in Santa Ana to pray and decorate altars.</TE>
<TE>   What she really seeks is a human touch.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen immigrated in 1989 at age 62--a dozen years after her
husband died--to be closer to her three grown children. She moved
into a Mission Viejo home with her children, but the reunion only
lasted six months before the children moved on to jobs in San Jose
and Chicago. Nguyen decided to stay in Southern California, moving to
a Santa Ana neighborhood at the edge of Little Saigon.</TE>
<TE>   "I love my children and I know they love me, but they are busy
with their work far away and their families. That's how it is here in
America," Nguyen said. "I want to live here [in Little Saigon] where
there are many older people like me, and it eases the loneliness."</TE>
<TE>   Home is a one-bedroom apartment in a low-income housing project.
Nguyen lives on $750 a month in Social Security, paying $200 for
rent, about $200 for food and another $100 for utility, trash and
phone bills.</TE>
<TE>   "Half of the bills I pay go to my high electricity bill, because I
turn on the television, radio and all my lights to keep the apartment
from seeming dark and lonely when I get home, especially in the
evenings," Nguyen said.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen plans out her days the way she planned her immigration.
When she left Vietnam, she brought sacred soil and water from the
National Ancestral Temple in the northern Vinh Phu province. She
hopes to be buried with them, a little bit of Vietnam to join her in
American soil.</TE>
<TE>   "I have my visa and passport and now I'm just on the waiting list
for my turn to go to heaven," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bach Nguyen also is philosophical about the final years of his
life. At 92, he doesn't expect to live much longer, but is grateful
he's healthy enough to live on his own.</TE>
<TE>   "Living by yourself, there are chores you have to do like
vacuuming, ironing your clothes, and laundry that can get to be
cumbersome," Nguyen said, adding that he has become set in his ways
and enjoys his isolation despite waves of loneliness. Nguyen seldom
has visitors and doesn't know his neighbors' names.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to live by myself because I feel so much more at peace,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen receives $829 a month in Social Security. He says his needs
are few and he's able to get by. Rent is $186 a month, and he budgets
$100 each for the telephone bill and food, plus expenses such as car
insurance. There's a cot by the front window where he naps, a plastic
table and toy stools where he takes his meals; the table is covered
with papers and files.</TE>
<TE>   A blue tarp covers part of the floor where he parks the electric
wheelchair that is his primary mode of transportation. When he needs
groceries--about once a week--he drives his 1986 Toyota Corolla to a
store about a mile away.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen has family, but they are estranged. When Saigon fell,
Nguyen's wife and their three children escaped. He stayed behind to
be with his mistress. Nguyen reunited with his family in Florida in
1986, and cared for his diabetic wife until her death a year later,
then chose to live out his life alone.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't live an entirely upstanding life," he said. "There is
pain in my heart from all the events that happened in my life, my
family estranged, and now that I'm far from my village and country."</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen doesn't like to think of his homeland, where nostalgia
overrides memories of even more dire poverty. "Living here, I have
everything I need," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But when I remember my village, my country, that's when I start
to cry."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Thousand Oaks man has been sentenced to 120 days of work furlough
for fatally shooting a neighbor's dog with a pellet gun because he
was annoyed by its barking.</LD>
<LD>   Gerald Thieman, 37, was arrested in February after a 2-year-old
beagle belonging to a family across the street died from a pellet
round. X-rays showed the dog had been shot at least three other times
with lead pellets.</LD>
<LD>   Thieman admitted to the shooting and pleaded guilty to one count
of felony animal cruelty. Westlake Village attorney Philip Dunn said
his client feels remorseful and has enrolled in anger-management
classes.</LD>
<TE>   Dunn said Thieman didn't intend to kill the dog. In a letter to
the judge, Thieman said he had previously called police to complain
about the noisy animal, but the barking continued.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of his sentence, Thieman will be allowed to work at
his construction job during the day but must spend his nights in
jail. He was ordered to begin serving the sentence June 5.</TE>

<HD>Warhol Exhibit Draws a Throng</HD>
<DH>Culture: Thousands attend retrospective of the artist's
work at MOCA, the biggest such turnout since the museum's opening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the red-vested valets who greeted patrons in front of the Museum
of Contemporary Art to the tented patio where museumgoers waited for
their turn inside the gallery, it was clear that the Andy Warhol
retrospective that opened Saturday was something special.</LD>
<LD>   About 4,000 people attended the opening day of the exhibition, the
largest such day for a MOCA show since the museum opened in 1986.
Many attendees had received tickets ahead of time as part of their
MOCA membership, but others bought $17 tickets at the door.</LD>
<LD>   Visitors to the museum were almost unanimous in their praise for
the exhibit, which spans Warhol's career from his earliest
pen-and-ink drawings to the "Last Supper" renderings created shortly
before his death from a heart attack after routine surgery in 1987.
Many said they had known little about Warhol beyond his iconic
portraits of Mao, Elvis and Marilyn.</LD>
<TE>   "Mostly, we are really getting a better understanding of his
work," said Erika Rosemark, 80, a retired teacher from Sherman Oaks
who brought along friend Sylvia Weishaus to see the show. "We've seen
the soup can, the Jackie Kennedy--but the early works give you a real
clear vision of the seeds of what he did later. We're trying to go
through it chronologically."</TE>
<TE>   Warhol's brightly colored, silk-screened canvases drew praise from
even the youngest attendees, and the exhibition afforded parents an
opportunity to teach their children a little bit about American pop
culture.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's pretty neat," said Hadley Hendon, 7, of West
Hollywood, standing in front of a collection of Brillo soap,
Campbell's soup, Del Monte tomato and Heinz ketchup boxes rendered in
silk-screen on plywood. "I like all of the self-portraits; I just
think they're amazing. He looks like Freddy in 'Scooby-Doo.'"</TE>
<TE>   Debbie Haber of Encino, pushing a double stroller containing
daughters Tess, 3, and Sophie, 15 months, said most of the images are
ones that even the youngest of children can understand.</TE>
<TE>   "Although Tess asked what an electric chair was," she added, "and
we said it was just a chair."</TE>
<TE>   Other guests praised the breadth of the collection, which occupies
every room of the museum and includes more than 240 works.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in Los Angeles, and I've been exposed to Andy Warhol
since my earliest memories," said Al Underwood, 38, as he stood with
friend Jacey Erwin, 29, in a room that contained, among others,
Warhol paintings of green Coke bottles and Campbell's soup cans. "I
was exposed to Warhol, but I didn't know Warhol. Here, my whole life
experience with this particular artist can be distilled down,
compared and contrasted. I can get a sense of what it all means."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is the only American city to host the Warhol
retrospective, which debuted at the New National Gallery in Berlin in
October. The city of Los Angeles contributed $250,000 to bring the
exhibition here.</TE>
<TE>   Tricia Cary, 24, drove from Ventura County to MOCA early Saturday
with her mother-in-law, Eileen Hamilton. By noon, the women had seen
the entire show and were waiting for a valet to bring them their car.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the Warhol fan," said Cary. "And I loved it."</TE>
<TE>   Cary said that she felt drawn to Warhol's "disaster" images, a
series of canvases depicting, among other things, car crashes, atomic
bombs and race riots. "You don't like to look at the atomic bomb or
scenes of destruction, but you are drawn to them."</TE>
<TE>   "With Warhol," Hamilton added, "even the disturbing is appealing."</TE>

<LD>Fire is a fact of life in Orange County, especially in newer
communities that extend suburbia to the borders of wild lands. The
perilous conditions ought to prompt all in fire-prone areas to higher
levels of awareness and precaution. The early arrival of smoke
billowing in the skies is an ominous reminder of the need to take
steps to brace for an extended season.</LD>
<LD>   Residents of Rancho Santa Margarita and Coto de Caza had alarming
first-hand experience with this year's early fire season on a Monday
afternoon earlier this month. High temperatures and breezy conditions
on May 13 produced a number of fires throughout the region and led to
the evacuation of dozens of homes in Orange County. Some 200 houses
in the Wagon Wheel section near Coto were briefly threatened.</LD>
<LD>   There is nothing like the real thing to lend urgency to the
periodic warnings from fire authorities to homeowners in subdivisions
near fire areas about clearing vegetation and installing
fire-retardant roofing.</LD>
<TE>   The fire season, which customarily starts in June, has begun in
earnest early this year. One of the driest winters on record has left
the region parched. Some fire experts are saying that last year's
fire season never really concluded.</TE>
<TE>   If that's true, then the county simply has been lucky that
conditions between the regular end of the previous season and the
start of a new one have been sufficiently quiet to avoid even more
damaging fires.</TE>
<TE>   The fires of May 13 made it clear that the lucky streak cannot
continue indefinitely in a place where fire is part of the cycle of
nature. Even the rainy times produce overgrowth that at some future
date will become tinder dry, renewing the fire hazard.</TE>
<TE>   During the fire earlier this month, lessons from previous blazes
in Orange County apparently were well learned. This is a tribute to
the efforts of fire authorities in prior years to educate homeowners,
and to the seriousness with which the homeowners took those
suggestions. In the aftermath of the Laguna Beach fires nearly a
decade ago, much was said about the need for fire-retardant roofs,
and in the newer suburbs, for creating sufficient clear areas near
homes.</TE>
<TE>   After the early May fires, fire officials praised the homeowners
in Coto for creating clearance to 100 feet from structures, as had
been recommended. The fire came perilously close to houses, and so it
is easy to see that 100 feet can be the difference between losing a
home and keeping one.</TE>
<TE>   Credit the Orange County Fire Authority with its resolve to
continue its good public education work. It plans a major campaign in
coming weeks to get homeowners to create these clear zones. That
applies not just to removing vegetation, but also to clearing any
kind of combustible, such as firewood, from around houses.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Californians often are said to take warnings too lightly,
or to expect that somehow the fire department will come to the
rescue. But for those who live close to the suburban edge, the fires
of May show that there is no substitute for readiness on the part of
the homeowner.</TE>

<LD>The number of newborns who die when abandoned by their mothers is
believed to be small in Orange County. Experts recall a handful of
confirmed deaths in the last three decades, but as a recent Orange
County Grand Jury report noted, "these deaths were particularly
disturbing."</LD>
<LD>   One mother abandoned a child on a roof. Another left her baby in a
filing cabinet before going on a vacation. The grand jury also
reported that at least 10 babies were abandoned but safely recovered
during the last 20 years--including newborns who were left behind
when their mothers left the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   The Safe Arms for Newborns Law, which took effect in California on
Jan. 1, 2001, allows the parent or guardian of a child up to 72 hours
to surrender the newborn anonymously to a public or private hospital
emergency room without the fear of being prosecuted. California is
one of more than 30 states with safe haven laws on the books.</LD>
<TE>   There is evidence that young mothers who abandon babies aren't
thinking much beyond their own confused and frightening situations.
Preventing unwanted pregnancies in the first place and helping those
who do become pregnant to make good choices remains an important
challenge. But for those in desperation who have fallen through the
cracks, the law provides one last lifeline. The grand jury reports
that many young women in the county haven't heard about the law.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury recommends that brochures, including one titled,
"Don't Throw Away Your Baby," be distributed in drugstores, school
offices and other places where teens congregate. It also suggests
that the county urge radio stations to run public service
advertisements.</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult for social agencies to track the success of safe
haven laws, but the minimal expense of distributing brochures that
spotlight the law is worthwhile. If the county determines that state
funding isn't getting the job done, supervisors should set aside
money for advertising. The minimal costs are definitely in line with
ensuring that newborn babies find their way into safe arms.</TE>

<LD>Re "Catholic Female Priest Says Vows," May 19:</LD>
<LD>   Your article on the ordination of a woman priest in Orange County
was deceptive and insulting to Roman Catholics. This minuscule sect
of 300 is not in any way connected to the Roman Catholic Church, and
its activities have no bearing on the church.</LD>
<LD>   To suggest in your article that there is some connection to the
Catholic Church is like reporting on a group of expatriate Americans
who move to an uninhabited South Pacific island, declare it to be the
"New United States of America" and claim that its officials have
legal standing in the United States. That would be ludicrous, and you
would not give them significant coverage in your paper.</LD>
<TE>   This group has no authority to ordain anyone as a Catholic priest.
They are more than welcome to ordain married men, women or kangaroos,
for that matter.</TE>
<TE>   This has about as much relevance to the Catholic Church as me
declaring myself to be an editor of your newspaper.</TE>

<HD>Let's Talk Facts on Accounting Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A couple of weeks ago The Times published my column calling for
reforms of the accounting profession in light of the Enron and Arthur
Andersen debacle. Since then, I have received a number of positive
responses from California accountants concerned about the image of
their profession.</LD>
<LD>   But a few days ago, The Times printed two letters to the editor
that blasted my column as containing "false and misleading
information" and "serious inaccuracies," and I was accused of
"political posturing."</LD>
<LD>   Rather than respond with similar rhetorical nastiness, let's talk
facts. First, we need to be clear about the real source of the two
letters. One letter is from the current chair of the California
Society of Certified Public Accountants (CalCPA), the state's largest
trade association for accountants. The second letter is from the
incoming chair of CalCPA. So there really is only a single letter,
produced by CalCPA and neatly divided between the trade association's
two top leaders.</LD>
<TE>   The main attack on my facts relates to my criticism of a recent
state law that allows non-CPAs to have an ownership interest in an
accounting firm. Although this is an arcane subject, the bottom line
is that the law creates the potential for serious conflicts of
interest.</TE>
<TE>   To clarify the situation, I used the example of a stockbroker who
can have an interest in an accounting firm and receive referrals from
accountants. The two CalCPA letters pounced on my stockbroker example
as being utterly false. They said that such an "obvious conflict of
interest" is not possible under the law.</TE>
<TE>   The two top leaders of CalCPA should know better, especially in
light of another fact--CalCPA sponsored and successfully lobbied for
this law. The reality is that both of their letters are dead wrong.</TE>
<TE>   My facts and example are correct, according to the California
Board of Accountancy, which interprets the law. This reminds me of
the adage about glass houses and throwing stones--if you want to
attack someone's character based on facts, you should be careful
about your own "facts."</TE>

<LD>Re "AES Pushes for Friendlier Surf City," May 18:</LD>
<LD>   It seems the corporate citizens at AES and their lawyer, Scott
Baugh, are even sore if they win. They got the "fast track" approval
for their generators in spite of the pollution and noise concerns
expressed by the city. They defeated the ballot measure that would
have required them to pay the same utility tax that applies to the
rest of the businesses and residents in the town. Baugh even got to
go to the state Assembly in spite of his dubious election practices.</LD>
<LD>   Now they are spending $7,500 for a ballot measure to remove two
council seats and partition the city into five districts. One wonders
how many thousands of dollars they plan to spend on the election
itself.</LD>
<TE>   A majority of five council members should be much cheaper to
influence than a majority of seven. So maybe they just see it as a
way to reduce expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Smith</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I would like to thank The Times for exposing AES as the driving
force behind the move to reduce the Huntington Beach City Council
from seven members to five and establish new districts.</TE>
<TE>   A resident with a concern can now approach seven council members.
If new districts are established, that same resident would only have
one council person to appeal to for assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Reducing the City Council in no way provides for better
representation for residents.</TE>
<TE>   These proposed districts would make it easier for large entities,
including AES, which owns the power plant, to control the City
Council. As long as they know it's happening, the people of
Huntington Beach are intelligent enough to see through this attempt
by a giant, powerful corporation to control city politics.</TE>
<TE>   Your article has helped to alert the people of Huntington Beach
about the attempt by AES to manipulate our city government.</TE>

<TE>   Ex-Assemblyman Scott Baugh is doing the bidding of the ethically
challenged power industry to fix something that isn't broken.</TE>
<TE>   The last Huntington Beach City Council election had no shortage of
candidates, including some aligned with environmentalists and others
aligned with developers. The pro-environment candidates received more
votes than the developer candidates, so Huntington Beach has a
pro-environment council. Sounds like democracy in action to me!</TE>
<TE>   Rather than implementing a district-based council scheme, people
unhappy with the current council should actually bother to register
to vote, educate themselves on the issues, and then show up at the
polls on election day.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Bixby</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article only scratches the surface in exposing what
ex-Assemblyman Scott Baugh and his cronies are attempting to do. For
example, the most vocal homeowners' group opposed to AES is the
Southeast Huntington Beach Neighborhood Assn. This group represents
the interests of more than 1,600 residences near the power plant.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Baugh plan, this area is lumped into District 1, which
includes the downtown area. If a "downtown" candidate (a pro-business
AES supporter) were elected to this gerrymandered district, it would
result in "negative representation" for the thousands of residents
most concerned about the AES power plant.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, there are other little surprises in the way the
districts are drawn that benefit Baugh's benefactors. Regardless of
the merits of districting in Surf City, the Baugh plan is a sham that
should be rejected by the voters.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Wisdom of Officials in Newport Questioned," letters, May 19:</LD>
<LD>   Jeffrey C. Metzger describes himself as the "official proponent of
Measure F" on the March 2000 ballot. Measure F, a covert attempt to
block plans for an airport at El Toro, was labeled a masquerade by
the Orange County League of Women Voters and found unconstitutional
by the courts. Metzger was, nevertheless, correct when he cautioned
Newport officials to be careful what they wished for on the airport
planning front.</LD>
<LD>   Measure W's success signals the abdication of the county's
responsibility to carry a reasonable share of its air transportation
burden. I found it ironic that Metzger's letter appeared on the same
page as the "Building Consensus in O.C." column, in which Daniel
Yankelovich and Wallace Walrod reported that county residents share a
conviction that growth should not be left to chance.</LD>
<TE>   Measure W was anything but solid, long-term planning. It was
ballot-box planning at its worst. For more than 20 years, El Toro
appeared in long-range plans as a means of meeting Orange County's
air transportation needs. All hope is not lost because suits now
pending could overturn Measure W and save South County voters from
the consequences of what they "wished for" in the recent election.</TE>
<TE>   Norm Ewers</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   El Toro should be a dead issue. I cannot believe all the people
who are trying to tell South County residents what is best for them.
We believe that parks and nonaviation uses are the best to retain our
quality of life, and in March we voted down the proposed El Toro
airport.</TE>
<TE>   Now Los Angeles is trying to get into the act. How dare they tell
us how to live? It is bad enough that Newport Beach is still trying
to throw out Measure W in the courts, even though the majority voted
for it.</TE>
<TE>   It is time to take the restrictions off John Wayne Airport. We do
not need to spend billions of dollars on an unnecessary airport just
because Newport Beach residents don't want it in their neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   When the Newport Beach homeowners moved there, the airport was up
and running. Previously, El Toro was not an airport but a military
base--there is a big difference. The jets flew occasionally, not one
plane every four minutes, and they stopped early in the evening. It
is time to move on and smell the flowers--in our new park!</TE>

<TE>   Opponents of an expansion at Los Angeles International Airport are
pushing for Los Angeles World Airways, which operates LAX and the
airports in Ontario, Van Nuys and Palmdale, to take over El Toro. If
this scheme succeeds, Los Angeles bureaucrats would allocate air
traffic between those airports and El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo Mayor Mike Gordon and others are leading this campaign
of airport colonialism. The plan would give Los Angeles control over
future land use, traffic and pollution in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   It's repulsive that some pro-El Toro airport groups in Orange
County are allying themselves with those who would turn this county
into a colony of Los Angeles. This treacherous effort also could drag
John Wayne Airport into Los Angeles' sphere of influence.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Board of Supervisors and local legislators must
speak out in opposition to any loss of control over the former base.
A Los Angeles grab for power over Orange County is unacceptable.</TE>

<TE>   Re "El Toro Airport Advocates Lost to a United Suburbia," April
28:</TE>
<TE>   The Times is still grappling with the realization that El Toro
will not become a commercial airport. Your article dissects the
political reasons why the airport plan failed, but neglected to
mention the other things that doomed the airport proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The El Toro site is not suited for a large commercial airport. It
is hemmed in by mountainous terrain on the north and east, and
prevailing winds from the west would force flights over populated
areas to the west and south. Proposed El Toro flight paths would
conflict with flight paths serving LAX and Long Beach Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Construction of a second commercial airport in Orange County is
not financially viable. The cost of construction, which could reach
$10 billion, could not be supported by future air travel demand in
Orange County. Official estimates of population growth in Orange
County fall short of the unused capacity at John Wayne, much less
extra capacity at available and underutilized sites in the Inland
Empire.</TE>

<LD>Re "Beach Pollution Source Eludes Scientists Despite Careful Study,"
May 16:</LD>
<LD>   It is not surprising that the source of beach pollution in
Huntington Beach is still elusive. After spending $5 million on
scientific studies, the source of bacteria on the beach is still not
known. One reason is that, last summer, scientists were supposed to
be testing the AES power plant's role in drawing sewage from the
Orange County Sanitation District's outfall pipe back toward the
shore. The AES plant, though, was largely idle during the study, so
$5million went down the drain. Why did the sanitation district carry
on this study when it knew the power plant was not fully operational?
Was this a wise use of $5 million in taxpayer money?</LD>

<TE>   Re "Study Finds No Single Source of '99 Huntington Coast
Pollution," May 17:</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Sanitation District now proudly claims that its
latest study found no evidence that the daily release of about 240
million gallons of partially treated waste water has any connection
to the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Adding insult to injury, the district has amassed a considerable
cash reserve while warning residents that it will be costly to treat
effluent to standards set by the Clean Water Act. The district has
abrogated its responsibility to provide the county a solution to
ocean pollution. The district is hiding behind studies to avoid doing
today what it will have to do in the future. Every day the district
delays taking action to increase the level of water treatment, the
price of the eventual solution increases.</TE>
<TE>   I want the district to design the most effective sewage treatment
plant that will create a sustainable solution that will maintain
clean ocean water and beaches for future generations. Let them then
come to the people and ask for the funding. What matters most is that
we protect our coastline so that people and marine life will have a
clean ocean.</TE>

<TE>   Getting a grip on events at the Orange County Sanitation District
takes a lot of digging. The district maintains a staff of three to
deflect attention and cast the issues in terms that steer away from
troublesome areas.</TE>
<TE>   All of the sanitation district's ocean studies are directed toward
one purpose: protecting the district's ability to use the ocean to
dispose of sewage solids. To do this, the studies are aimed at trying
to identify onshore sources of sewage pollution.</TE>

<TE>   I read with distress Christopher Evans' suggestion that Orange
County Sanitation District funding could lead to invalidating the
recent Huntington Beach contamination study. A scientific career is a
lifetime commitment to objective and impartial research. Any
falsification or mishandling of data could ruin a scientist's career.</TE>
<TE>   The $5million provided by the district to study transport of the
outfall plume may sound like a lot of money, but a great deal of that
goes to instrumentation, paying for a ship and 24-hour water
sampling. An individual scientist receives only a few months' salary,
maybe a year at most.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists love what they do, and it would be absurd to jeopardize
a career for a single project. Scientific ethics are not for sale.</TE>

<TE>   After a three-hour report from the scientific panel that has been
studying the ocean off Huntington Beach and Newport Beach, we learned
that they could not say whether the sewage discharge affected the
beach. After spending $5 million, we still do not have a definitive
study. We do know, however, that Orange County Sanitation District is
at odds with the Clean Water Act.</TE>
<TE>   The district should have begun giving secondary treatment to
sewage 17 years ago, but the board continues to fight it. The
district sends 240 million gallons of sewage into our ocean every
day. I strongly urge the district's board members to provide at least
secondary treatment for all sewage that goes into the ocean, and not
to fall prey to district management's bullheaded policies and its
strange notion of science.</TE>

<TE>   I am writing to express my outrage over the fact that the
taxpayers paid $5 million to watch grown men float grapefruits off
the coast of Huntington Beach--and not come to a conclusion on what
is causing the pollution. The ocean in that area contains 200 billion
gallons of seawater. It doesn't take a scientist to realize that the
pollution problem isn't linked to a toilet, a trailer park full of
toilets or a storm drain. We do have a 6-foot diameter pipe that
pumps 240 million gallons of human waste a day into the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Please fix the sewage treatment plant and quit wasting my money.</TE>

<TE>   One newspaper article led with the line that the "plume is
innocent." The reporter listened to the same scientific testimony
that I did, but arrived at a different conclusion. The only people
who have ever insisted that the plume is innocent are Orange County
Sanitation District employees.</TE>
<TE>   There is a huge difference between innocent and not proven guilty,
a distinction that is being lost in the spin. The pipe has not been
indicted, but not because there was no crime. Scientists who
participated in the ill-fated study that was purportedly undertaken
to test a possible disturbance of the plume by the influx and reflux
of 300 million gallons of ocean water a day by the AES power plant
cooling system have never said the plume was innocent.</TE>
<TE>   It is tragic that more than 20 years ago, the sanitation district
could have used federal funds to preclude this discussion, and by
now, nothing would be spewing out of the pipe. We would be reclaiming
the water for use or for sale and would be making a tidy profit on
sludge being recycled into fertilizer.</TE>
<TE>   Plume movement aside, using the ocean as a toilet for economic
reasons in the arguably richest county in the world is
unconscionable. No one with even a modicum of common sense or decency
can rebut that indictment.</TE>

<TE>   It's clear that pollution at our local beaches comes from multiple
sources. Stanley Grant's research indicates that the most polluted
sites are those close to storm drains and river outflows.
Environmental scientists call this kind of pollution urban runoff. No
single "magic bullet" will solve the problem.</TE>
<TE>   The deeper problem involves all of our communities. It is
basically that our urban and suburban lifestyles are unsustainable.</TE>
<TE>   Some technical fixes, like increasing the treatment of sewage,
will help. But such action alone will not be sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   If we really want our children and grandchildren to be able to
enjoy our beaches in the same way that we have, then we will need to
make some broader changes. These will involve our transportation
systems, our chemically laden landscaping practices and our overall
misuse of water.</TE>
<TE>   Surely in a county that has been labeled "conservative," one of
the most important things we would like to conserve is the legacy of
our beaches.</TE>

<LD>Re "Wilderness Bill Proposed," May 11:</LD>
<LD>   As a California resident who is concerned about the destruction of
our remaining wild places, I am pleased about Sen. Barbara Boxer's
announcement of the California Wild Heritage Act of 2002. This act
will protect 2.5 million roadless acres on National Forest, Bureau of
Land Management and National Park lands in California as wilderness
and ensure that future generations will be able to experience the
wonder of unspoiled nature.</LD>
<LD>   As an Orange County resident, however, I was sorely disappointed
that this act includes none of the beautiful wild areas in our own
Cleveland National Forest. This is all the more disturbing because
the California Wilderness Coalition has identified southern Orange
County as one of the 10 most-threatened wild areas in the state.</LD>
<TE>   The Cleveland National Forest already belongs to the people. But
that doesn't mean it is safe from development. All of the areas
recommended for inclusion in the California Wild Heritage Act by the
Santa Ana Mountains Task Force, a group of Sierra Club volunteers
dedicated to protecting the Cleveland, are at risk. Morrell Canyon is
threatened by a hydroelectric project; Ladd Canyon is being eyed by
Riverside County officials as a possible route for a new freeway; and
a utility corridor already separates the Coldwater Canyon area from
Ladd Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   These areas are among the few remaining wild places in our
urbanized county. They, and we, deserve better.</TE>

<LD>Re "Educators Cut Out Extras in Protest," May 17:</LD>
<LD>   It is easy to understand the frustration that caused Richard Glick
and other Capistrano Unified School District teachers to drop unpaid
and unappreciated voluntary duties. The district will not pay Glick,
who donates four-hour tutoring sessions for Advanced Placement
students and often pays for their pizza out of his own pocket, yet it
finds $30,000 to pay contractors to do the same job. While 25 of 28
Orange County school districts have settled for raises of 4% or more,
Capistrano Unified will not give the teachers the requested 2.5% pay
raise because they are strapped for cash. With this kind of slap in
the face, is it any wonder the Capistrano Unified teachers are angry?</LD>

<LD>Re "Tustin Marine Base Fight Proves to Be a Learn-Learn Situation,"
Dana Parsons, May 15:</LD>
<LD>   Did Santa Ana Unified School District learn from its contentious
negotiations with Tustin? Recent activities suggest the district is
still using the same unfair and shameful techniques that prompted all
the contention with Tustin. As Dana Parsons' column points out,
Tustin officials were offended and hunkered down in the face of
allegations of discrimination orchestrated by the district.</LD>
<LD>   We are longtime residents of an ethnically diverse neighborhood of
Santa Ana, and when we first read of the Tustin debate, we ignorantly
sided with the schools. We since have witnessed district techniques
firsthand, and now empathize with Tustin officials. Along with many
of our neighbors, we recently attended a district board meeting about
the use of eminent domain to acquire property for a proposed
elementary school.</LD>
<TE>   Our neighborhood is against putting a school on this property. The
major objection is that it will cause major traffic problems in an
isolated neighborhood. We don't want the extra traffic. But we
recognize that Santa Ana needs more classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   We want to see a sensible plan. We want to know why other,
more-suitable sites are not being pursued. We want to know why the
current schools, many of which are in terrible condition, are not
being upgraded.</TE>
<TE>   If the plan shows that this school makes sense, our neighborhood
will pull together to make it happen. But the board, by its own
admission, hasn't done a good job of involving the public. Instead of
using the board meeting to inform and unite the community, the
meeting eroded into a racially intoned bully pulpit. During public
comments, speaker after speaker accused those against the school of
being racist.</TE>
<TE>   We were offended, saddened and outraged with the racist labels we
were given that evening. Half of our neighbors are of Latino descent,
and many other nationalities are represented. Our neighborhood is
unanimous against building a school, but we are not racists.</TE>

<HD>Marriage Brings Advantages to Clergy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE BECKWITH</AU>
<BD>Dave Beckwith is senior pastor of Woodbridge Community
Church in Irvine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a pastor, I have been asked, "Should celibacy be required for
priests, bishops or pastors?" The current controversy in the Catholic
Church about pedophile priests has renewed the debate on clergy
celibacy. Does celibacy contribute to pedophilia? The question is
argued both ways.</LD>
<LD>   Regardless of your view, celibacy is not for everyone, and
required celibacy for priests needs serious examination.</LD>
<LD>   While in high school, my oldest daughter, Julie, was asked by a
classmate, "Is your dad a priest or minister or something like that?"
Julie replied, "Yes, he's a minister." With a look of confusion, the
girl asked, "How did you get here?" Shocked, she did not realize that
most members of the clergy are married. My wife, Joanne, and I have
been married for 33 years.</LD>
<TE>   My first pastoral responsibility began the day we returned from
our honeymoon. With a salary of $150 a month and a church member's
garage converted into a bedroom, we poured long hours into mending
lives and connecting people with God. Our marriage deepened as we
prayed together, partnered together and sometimes wept together.</TE>
<TE>   Joanne has been my confidant, best friend and lover. Numerous
times, her advice has spared me from a foolish decision. Trained as a
psychiatric nurse, she has insight and understanding into people and
situations, which are of great value. Many seek her out for
counseling, and in particular, women often feel more comfortable
discussing issues with her.</TE>
<TE>   I shudder to think of how I would have responded to moral
temptations if I had been single. I cannot fathom surviving some of
the intense pressures of ministry without Joanne by my side.</TE>
<TE>   Is celibacy good? St. Paul said: "Yes, it is good to live a
celibate life. But because there is so much sexual immorality, each
man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own
husband." (1 Corinthians 7:1- 2).</TE>
<TE>   Being single allows complete devotion of time and energy to
serving God and others. Henrietta Mears remained single throughout
her life and distinguished ministry at the First Presbyterian Church
of Hollywood. The Sunday school grew to 4,000, and she influenced
more than 400 to enter full-time Christian service.</TE>
<TE>   St. Paul also said: "I wish everyone could get along without
marrying, just as I do. But we are not all the same. God gives some
the gift of marriage, and to others he gives the gift of singleness."
(1 Corinthians 7:7). Some believe Paul may have been married since
this was a strict requirement of being a Pharisee. Did Paul's wife
leave him or perhaps die prematurely? Of this, we cannot be certain.</TE>
<TE>   The word "priest" in Latin means "a bridge builder."
Identification with the hurt in people's lives is an important
component in the bridge. When a stressed couple is struggling over a
less-than-satisfying sexual relationship, the married pastor will
certainly be in a position to better understand and assist.</TE>
<TE>   John Walsh, a devout Catholic who started the highly successful
"America's Most Wanted," lost his son Adam when he was abducted and
later found murdered. Walsh said that, as a grieving parent, it would
have been helpful to talk with a priest who had children and
understood his loss.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, celibacy, when required as a condition of the
priesthood, has become a "bridge leading to deeply troubled waters."
God-designed sexual passion is normal, wonderful, but exceedingly
powerful. Sexual passions need appropriate expression, and mandatory
celibacy, while well-intended, may contribute to inappropriate sexual
behaviors. It is time to end the practice of mandatory celibacy.</TE>

<HD>Muslims Due Place at Table</HD>
<DH>Islamic values compel Muslims to work for justice and
mutual understanding among peoples, as well as to support charities
providing for the less fortunate and less able.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHABBIR MANSURI</AU>
<BD>Shabbir Mansuri is founding director of the Fountain
Valley-based Council on Islamic Education.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since Sept. 11, people occasionally ask me, "Do Muslims still feel
they have a place at the table?" By this, I believe they mean do we
still feel welcomed by our fellow Americans and do we still have a
voice in civic matters?</LD>
<LD>   Such questions invariably give rise to mixed emotions.</LD>
<LD>   On the one hand, I know that the U.S. Constitution guarantees such
a place for citizens who follow Islam, right along with every other
citizen who has not abrogated those rights under the law. Most people
I encounter have no issue with this.</LD>
<TE>   On the other hand, I ask myself, "Why is our government ignoring
constitutional guarantees in the pursuit of justice? And where are
the checks and balances that are supposed to restrain the breaching
of civil liberties?"</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the tragic events of last September, our law
enforcement agencies have a legitimate mission to prevent their
repetition. No one argues with this. Nevertheless, many people, both
American Muslims and others, are concerned that these agencies have
been violating civil liberties in the pursuit of that mission,
creating the impression that we are moving toward the police-state
atmosphere we have condemned in other countries.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the arrest and detention of Muslims, immigrants and
citizens alike, held without charges, without legal representation,
and without formal hearings, certainly brings current law enforcement
methods into question.</TE>
<TE>   More frightening were the raids on March 20 against the families
and organizations of prominent Muslim intellectuals in Virginia.
Scores of federal agents representing the FBI, ATF and INS descended
upon the homes and offices of law-abiding Muslims--all of whom are
ardent supporters of the United States--destroying property and
handcuffing women and children.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, actions such as these by our own government,
including our top elected and appointed officials, are nothing new.
Muslim Americans are just the latest in a history of such cases. It
is a history in which government has not lived up to American ideals
and where certain citizens have systematically, and sometimes
violently, been denied their place at our common table.</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home in Orange County, the Southern California Chapter
of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has found it
necessary to increase its efforts defending the rights of Muslims and
the image of Islam in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County residents have been barraged with negative
information about Muslims and Islam. This, along with ongoing
examples of overzealous federal law enforcement officials, likely is
responsible for the reported increase in hate crimes and acts of
discrimination against Muslims in our area--and across the
nation--since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, there also has been an unprecedented interest in
learning more about Muslims and Islam. I think this can be best
understood by looking at what Muslim Americans bring to the
table--and what an increasing number of non-Muslim Americans are
discovering.</TE>
<TE>   The first thing to understand is that Islam is an American
religion. Islam has been on this soil since before the nation was
founded, having come over with African slaves. Depending upon whose
figures you accept, there are 6 million to 9 million Muslims in the
United States. Tracing their origins to nearly 80 countries, the vast
majority claim U.S. citizenship and participate in civic affairs.
Despite the frequent portrayal of Islam as exotic or alien in the
media, the religion is an everyday part of American life.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the universal paradigm of Islam enables--indeed
requires--Muslims to contribute to American society in the broadest
manner. Islamic values compel Muslims to work for justice and mutual
understanding among peoples, as well as to support charities
providing for the less fortunate and less able.</TE>
<TE>   Islam has a proud history of scholarship and scientific
achievement based upon a deep respect for education and learning. The
faith also honors those who earn their living through the trade and
commerce that are the bedrock of the American economy.</TE>
<TE>   So, I ask myself again, "Do Muslims have a place at the table?" I
must answer, "Yes, we do." In which case, it is time we stepped up to
the table--not out of a sense of victimization but, rather, to
constructively engage the system.</TE>
<TE>   The American constitutional system is not perfect, but it has a
record of self-correction. By taking our place at the table, Muslim
Americans have an opportunity to help the system continue working not
just for ourselves but for all.</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Like the Great and Powerful Oz, former President Burhanuddin Rabbani
indulges in fiery rhetoric and delusions of grandeur as he insists
from his elegant villa that he remains head of state and the best
promise of unifying this fractured country.</LD>
<LD>   Two blocks away, Mohammad Zaher Shah makes a more subtle case for
resuming power. Each day, the 87-year-old deposed monarch holds court
in his landscaped garden for hundreds of supplicants who come to
praise his return after nearly 30 years in exile and urge him to
serve once again as father of the nation.</LD>
<LD>   And on the grounds of the nearby presidential palace, in a guest
house that miraculously survived 23 years of civil war, provisional
leader Hamid Karzai is waging his own bid to become ruler by
marshaling international aid, keeping a lid on ethnic tensions and
appeasing rival warlords.</LD>
<TE>   The three men are jockeying for position in the weeks before a
June 10-16 loya jirga, the convention of national elders that will
choose a new leader for a country that for centuries has defied all
attempts to be governed.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three would-be kings, the international community's money
and muscle are clearly on Karzai, the 44-year-old polyglot blueblood
who has rocketed to widespread respect and renown for holding
together his battered homeland through a United Nations-brokered
transition.</TE>
<TE>   But Afghans are famous for resisting outside pressures and
influences, leaving many here skeptical of what they see as a Western
plot to empower Karzai, and engendering hopes among his political,
ethnic and military opponents that the loya jirga can be manipulated
to fulfill their own ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no official campaigning, but unofficially everyone is
trying to get something in motion," said Sadaq Mudaber of the
21-member Special Independent Commission for Preparation of the Loya
Jirga. Although the commission members are obliged to be neutral,
Mudaber said a consensus was forming among the organizers that the
former king will be chosen as head of state but that most powers will
be vested in a prime minister's post to be filled by Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   Few will hazard a prediction on the likely outcome of the loya
jirga. While Afghanistan was sealed off from the civilized world for
more than five years by the fanatic Taliban, all institutions for
gauging public opinion collapsed. There are no polls measuring
political leanings among people who haven't seen a free election in
two generations, and the mostly illiterate population has little
exposure to newspapers or only recently restored television
broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   The 1,501 loya jirga delegates are being chosen by vastly
differing procedures in districts nationwide, feeding fears among
observers here that more clout is being bestowed on representatives
of the unruly hinterlands than on urban intellectuals who might be
expected to act in the country's best interests.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most difficult-to-measure elements is the potential
support for Rabbani. A 62-year-old Tajik from the backward northern
province of Badakhshan, the Cairo-educated cleric rose to national
prominence in the late 1960s by organizing armed resistance, at first
against the secular drift of Zaher Shah's regime, and then against
the godless communism imposed after the Soviets' 1979 invasion.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by moujahedeen rebels who used U.S. arms and support to
harass the Soviet occupiers, Rabbani was appointed president after
the fighters led by the late warrior legend Ahmed Shah Masoud toppled
the last Communist government in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   But vicious infighting among the rival Northern Alliance militias
inflicted such bloodshed, chaos and atrocities on the population that
many welcomed the fundamentalist Taliban when the Islamic movement
seized power four years later, sending Rabbani into exile.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Kabul, the capital, after U.S. bombing and a
Northern Alliance advance drove out the extremists in November,
imperiously occupying the presidential palace and proclaiming himself
the rightful Afghan ruler.</TE>
<TE>   Even after a power-sharing accord was reached near Bonn, Germany,
ushering in the Karzai government in December, it took U.N.
authorities two months to persuade Rabbani to leave the bombed-out
palace--and only after he was provided the plush villa in the Wazir
Akbar Khan district where the former king is now a neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbani's gunmen, however, remain outside the palace gates,
controlling access to Karzai, who is as much imprisoned at the
compound as he is protected.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview in the mammoth living room of his villa, where a
dozen overstuffed sofas line the walls and menacing-looking aides
prowl the adjacent hallways, Rabbani made clear that he still harbors
presidential ambitions and resents the West's overt support for
Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   "We shouldn't allow foreign intervention into Afghan affairs
anymore," the white-bearded cleric insisted from his throne-like
chair in the reception room's far corner. He is critical of the
U.S.-led fight against alleged Taliban and Al Qaeda forces, accusing
the American troops of being duped by warlords into settling scores
with Afghan rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Portraying himself as the power broker of the talks in Germany
that he sought repeatedly to thwart, Rabbani said that it was at his
behest that Karzai was appointed. Rabbani also insisted that he had
encouraged Zaher Shah's return; in fact, the cleric had denounced the
role of the monarch as "extinct, like the dinosaurs."</TE>
<TE>   Although Rabbani's relations with the younger generation of
Northern Alliance figures are thought to be looser than during the
early 1990s when Masoud was the guarantor of his power, he retains
considerable influence over the military and police forces through
his allies running the defense and interior ministries.</TE>
<TE>   And although he has assured U.N. and foreign officials organizing
the loya jirga that he will accept whatever decisions are made, he
also has close ties with several Tajik and Uzbek regional warlords in
the north who have little regard for Karzai or his fellow Pushtuns
from the southern regions.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Zaher Shah, also a Pushtun and a distant relative of
Karzai, presents the interim prime minister as a skilled
administrator and valued ally. The former king's ambitious relatives
and friends from three decades of Italian exile say he would seek a
power-sharing arrangement with Karzai if the long-ago monarch is
named head of state.</TE>
<TE>   "The people will decide, not me," Zaher Shah replied with
practiced humility when asked if he would be lobbying for the
leadership when the loya jirga tackles its first order of business.
"I have come home on the occasion of the loya jirga to be near the
people of Afghanistan.... I will not interfere with the process, but
I will be ready to offer advice and counsel if asked by the
participants."</TE>
<TE>   His voice reduced to a whisper and his words translated from
Pashto into English by his cousin, son-in-law and closest advisor,
Gen. Abdul Wali, the former king asserts that he could serve as a
unifying figure.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the main duties I have assigned myself in returning to my
homeland is to bring peace and security to the entire country, and in
this purpose I will spare no efforts," he said through Wali, both
settled in cream-colored brocade armchairs after a morning of
audiences with rotating delegations from Hazara and Tajik tribes.</TE>
<TE>   Stooped and shuffling, the visibly frail Zaher Shah deflected
questions about his personal ambitions with the often-repeated reply
that it is "improper" to speculate about the will of the people. But
his hovering supporters were quick to suggest that an alliance of the
former king as ceremonial head of state and Karzai as chief executive
would combine the unifying powers of the deposed monarch with the
considerable diplomatic and administrative skills of the interim
leader.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his obvious physical limitations, the former king does
infuse Afghans with a sense of purpose and self-sacrifice in pursuit
of rebuilding the shattered country.</TE>
<TE>   By way of example, he has inspired thousands of refugees and
emigres to return to their homeland. U.N. migration officials contend
that they are overwhelmed with requests to help refugees reclaim
their damaged homes and mined farmland. By the end of April, half a
million Afghans had returned from abroad--more than U.N. authorities
had expected for the year. "You have given us all new hope and pride
in our nation," Raman Nadjafe, an ethnic Tajik just returned from
Hamburg, Germany, after 40 years abroad, effused tearfully during a
recent morning audience with Zaher Shah. "We will stay with you
forever."</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats--newcomers to this shattered capital and often
influenced by wishful thinking--nevertheless predict that Karzai will
be chosen as head of state.</TE>
<TE>   "The vast majority of Afghans see the interim authority in a very
positive way. That's not to say they don't see that it's Western
supported, but they don't necessarily see that as a bad thing," one
Western diplomat insisted. "Karzai has done a much better job than
many people thought in becoming a national figure."</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't happened without the aid and intervention of Western
powers. The educated, progressive chieftain of the noble Popolzai
clan from the Kandahar region, Karzai was plucked from Pakistani
exile by U.S. Special Forces who provided him with arms, advice and
fighters to lead the battle against Taliban holdouts in Kandahar in
early December.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Karzai had to be rescued from advancing enemy forces
by a U.S. helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   Fluent in English and French, suave and dignified and able to
balance the quest for foreign assistance with Afghans' abhorrence of
being seen as beggars, Karzai has exceeded all expectations--at least
in this rapidly recovering capital.</TE>
<TE>   He has gained the respect of those in a position to enjoy the
improving security in Kabul and the thousands of jobs created by the
U.N.-supported interim government and returning foreign aid
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   He has brought a newfound dignity to a country long dismissed as
hopelessly fractious and lawless. He proudly carries out his duties
as Afghan statesman, lobbying for aid, hosting the few international
dignitaries willing to visit.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the outcome of the presidential contest, diplomats note,
some accommodation of northerners will be needed to provide ethnic
and political balance if the two Pushtuns, Zaher Shah and Karzai,
hold the main levers of power. Foreign Minister Abdullah, a Tajik
whose command of English and soft-spoken manner have won over some
Western allies, is seen as likely to be returned to his post by the
loya jirga.</TE>
<TE>   And if for no other reason than to prevent his becoming a problem,
Rabbani is expected to be assigned some prestigious role.</TE>
<TE>   Zaher Shah will open the loya jirga and address the assemblage on
the first day of the gathering, then retreat to the sidelines in the
role of advisor, said Mudaber of the special organizing commission.</TE>
<TE>   Once the head of state is chosen, the delegates will define the
structure of the next government and guide the new leader in
selecting Cabinet members, Mudaber said. The delegates are also
expected to choose a 111-member national assembly to draft laws and
empower a constitutional convention ahead of elections set for summer
2004.</TE>
<TE>   But with so much at stake and so many competing influences
converging, the future of Afghanistan remains as uncertain as it was
when the Taliban's ouster created the latest power vacuum.</TE>
<TE>   "Karzai is the only real head-of-state figure," one diplomat
insisted. "The king's 40-year reign wasn't really that distinguished,
and Rabbani's rule was a disaster. The choice seems obvious to us
outsiders, but that doesn't mean much. There are still a lot of
hurdles."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Needn't Fear Cuba, Castro Says</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: He says his nation would never attack America
and backs its war on terror.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HAVANA</DL>
<LD>Cuban President Fidel Castro told a crowd Saturday that the United
States should never fear an attack by Cuba and can always count on
the Communist country's support in the war against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   In his first public comments since President Bush's hard-line,
anti-Castro speech Monday, the Cuban leader told a large rally that
his nation does not fault Americans for their government's
restrictions on the Communist island and recognizes that many U.S.
citizens support improved relations.</LD>
<LD>   "Our struggle is not and never will be against the people of the
United States," Castro said during the morning rally in the city of
Sancti Spiritus, about 215 miles southeast of Havana.</LD>
<TE>   "Cuba will never place blame or sow hate against the people of the
United States for the aggressions that we have suffered because of
their governments," Castro told a crowd the government estimated at
300,000.</TE>
<TE>   Americans should never fear that Cuba would attack their country,
Castro said.</TE>
<TE>   The speech seemed designed to engage Americans who support changes
in U.S. policy toward Cuba. It also seemed aimed at assuaging fears
Americans may have after recent charges by the Bush administration
that Cuba sponsors terrorism and could be developing germ warfare.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said in his speech Monday that trade sanctions against Cuba
would not be lifted until Castro agrees to free all political
prisoners, allow independently monitored elections and adopt other
conditions for a "new government that is fully democratic."</TE>
<TE>   Castro said he was "hurt" to think Americans would believe that
Cuba supported terrorism or could be involved in any way with weapons
of mass destruction.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Forces Reenter Bethlehem</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Army leaves after arresting suspected militant.
Troops declare a curfew in Kalkilya.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Israeli tanks and troops moved back into Bethlehem on Saturday, about
two weeks after the army lifted a siege of Palestinian militants
inside the city's Church of the Nativity, witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli troops told residents to get off the streets because a
"closed military zone" had been declared and a curfew was in force,
military sources said. The army said it withdrew early today after
arresting a suspected militant.</LD>
<LD>   Also early today, Israeli troops entered the West Bank town of
Kalkilya and declared a curfew. Witnesses reported gunfire but no
injuries. The army said troops were searching for militants.</LD>
<TE>   The army has swept in and out of Palestinian-ruled towns since it
formally wound up a West Bank offensive against suspected terrorist
networks earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian suicide bombers have regularly targeted Israelis since
September 2000, the start of the latest uprising against Israeli
occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   At least 1,370 Palestinians and 450 Israelis have been killed
since. On Saturday, Palestinian witnesses said Israeli jeeps, tanks
and armored personnel carriers fanned out in Bethlehem after
nightfall.</TE>
<TE>   They said shooting erupted and two explosions shook the Old City
as tanks and an armored bulldozer approached. Israeli helicopter
gunships fired at least two rockets, witnesses said. No casualties
were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Israeli armored vehicles surrounded the house of Mohammed
Shada, a leader of the militant Islamic Jihad group, and demanded his
surrender, but his family emerged without him, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   The army did not immediately say why it had burst back into
Bethlehem. But on Friday, local television broadcast a video that had
been recorded by a youth from Bethlehem, who said he planned to carry
out a suicide bombing in the Israeli town of Rishon Le Zion. On
Wednesday, a suicide bomber struck in the town, killing two Israelis
and wounding 36.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere on Saturday, Israeli troops firing tank shells and
machine guns killed a Palestinian woman and her daughter, 13, working
on a farm in Gaza, Palestinian witnesses and doctors said. The army
said the two were in a prohibited area near the Israeli border.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Saturday, the army declared a curfew in the West Bank city
of Tulkarm after a two-day raid in which one soldier was killed and
11 people were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops withdrew to the fringes of Tulkarm but reentered
early this morning. Witnesses said one Palestinian was killed. The
army said 25 suspects were arrested and weapons were seized.</TE>
<TE>   Near the West Bank village of Sanur, meanwhile, Israeli troops at
a roadblock stopped a taxi and arrested a 16-year-old Palestinian boy
with explosives strapped to his waist, the army said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sure, President Bush and his Kremlin counterpart talked about
chemical weapons and terrorism during Bush's Russian trip. They
signed a promise to cut their deployed nuclear arsenals by
two-thirds, established a new bilateral strategic relationship and
issued serious declarations about half a dozen other important
matters. That was on Friday in Moscow.</LD>
<LD>   But on Saturday, they talked of love.</LD>
<LD>   What, a student at St. Petersburg State University asked Bush and
Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, are the qualities of a
successful manager?</LD>
<TE>   Two, Putin replied: "You have to have a sense of responsibility,
and you have to have a sense of love."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Putin have met five times in the last year, each time
talking about how they have broken down decades of mistrust between
Washington and Moscow by developing a personal relationship.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, they demonstrated it.</TE>
<TE>   They flew separately to St. Petersburg, Putin's native city, but
then spent most of the day together--and not in activities at which
Bush spends much time at home.</TE>
<TE>   With their wives, they passed two hours at the Hermitage museum.
Part of the time was spent at lunch, part talking with reporters.
Still, they did a power walk through a history of Western art.</TE>
<TE>   Entering the room in which Titian's "Venus With a Mirror" is being
displayed--and where reporters and photographers were stationed
nearby--Bush focused intently elsewhere. He regarded Putin. He made
small talk with reporters. But he made no eye contact with the
partially nude Venus.</TE>
<TE>   Later, in a city that is home to one of the world's most famed
ballet companies, the two couples saw a new production of "The
Nutcracker" by the company known here as the Maryinsky and in the
West as the Kirov. And, taking advantage of the dusky light late in
the northern evening as the summer solstice nears, they went for a
cruise on the Neva River after the performance.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Bush caught himself appearing too informal as he and
Putin spoke with the students at the university, which is the alma
mater of the Putins and Lenin.</TE>
<TE>   The question dealt with how to prevent Russia's best and brightest
from heading to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell Vladimir all the time--I mean, Mr. President all the
time--that Russia's most precious resource is the brainpower of the
country. And you've got a lot of it. It's going to take a lot of
brains in Russia to create a drain," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The two presidents began their visit at the Piskarevskoye Memorial
Cemetery north of the city. It is situated in a community of dreary
apartment blocks and an occasional factory.</TE>
<TE>   Buried there in 186 mass graves are the remains of 490,000 people,
all victims of the 900-day Nazi siege of Leningrad from 1941 to 1944.</TE>
<TE>   At a measured pace, Bush and Putin followed two Russian soldiers
who marched with precise, synchronized and painfully slow goose steps
past the burial mounds down a path the length of three football
fields, to jointly present in silence a single wreath at a statue of
heroic proportions representing the Russian Motherland.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There are all sorts of changes in Russia, of course, and not just
in relations with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In stores retailing to Moscow's upscale consumers, $5,000 watches
are routine. Along the heavily traveled roads to a suburb on the
city's west side, a portrait of the Sphinx in gold advertises the
latest-model Lexus. And in and around the Kremlin, security agents
demonstrate their skills at manhandling and surreptitious searches.</TE>
<TE>   Some things never change.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the moment Friday when Bush and Putin plunged into a
crowd of about 100 tourists and students at Cathedral Square, within
the Kremlin.</TE>
<TE>   Russian security agents took that as a signal of sorts to plunge
themselves into American television camera crews, jostling some,
whirling others and turning the pack into the equivalent of a rugby
scrum. The Russian crews were ignored.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Putin has made his residence at Novo-Ogarevo, a government-owned
compound west of Moscow. It is just beyond a ghetto of sprouting
McMansions, imposing two- and three-story brick structures satisfying
the dacha-needs of Moscow's successful entrepreneurs.</TE>
<TE>   To reach the dwelling on the Moscow River, a visitor passes
through two sets of large gates in a stone wall perhaps 20 feet high
and drives up a roadway that cuts through a forest of birch and pine.</TE>
<TE>   The home is a two-story structure of yellow stucco, set off by
four white columns in the front and natural wood trim around the
windows. Think rustic Camp David gone upmarket.</TE>
<TE>   Russian reporters say a sports pavilion on the property includes
an indoor swimming pool and a gym.</TE>
<TE>   The Bushes and the Putins had dinner there Friday night;
afterward, the Bushes spent the night at the compound, just as the
Putins had overnighted at the Bush ranch in Texas in November.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about our families, we talked about our passions, we
talked about matters of life that friends would talk about," Bush
said Saturday. "But the thing that impressed me the most about the
president and his wife was how much they loved their daughters."</TE>
<TE>   Again, love.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a universal value," Bush said.</TE>

<HD>Bulgaria's Orthodox Christian Monks Welcome John Paul</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SOFIA, Bulgaria</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II was given a warm welcome by Orthodox Christian
monks and Bulgaria's prime minister at this nation's greatest
monastery Saturday, as he pushed forward an effort to ease centuries
of tension between the Orthodox and Roman Catholic faiths.</LD>
<LD>   "Eastern monasticism ... constitutes a great gift for the whole
church," John Paul told Orthodox leaders at the Rila monastery, a
mountain sanctuary that played a key role in the preservation of
Bulgarian culture during centuries of Ottoman Turkish rule.</LD>
<LD>   The Orthodox Church in many countries has been cool to John Paul's
overtures for greater unity, but Bishop John, head of the Rila
monastery, welcomed him with an endorsement of the idea that the rift
can be healed.</LD>
<TE>   "The split between the Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches has
been ongoing for 10 centuries," said John, the Orthodox host. "But
what is 10 centuries when ... in God's eyes, 1,000 years is like
yesterday? The walls of separation do not reach heaven. Like any
other work of man, they are temporary. They have been built by men,
and men will be the ones to pull them down."</TE>
<TE>   John Paul's four-day visit to Bulgaria, during which he is
stressing his respect for the Orthodox faith, is seen as a possible
steppingstone to better Vatican ties with the large and influential
Russian Orthodox Church.</TE>
<TE>   One of the pontiff's greatest wishes is to visit Russia. But
within the Orthodox Church, hard-liners view Catholicism as heresy.
Orthodox leaders in Russia have blocked a papal tour partly out of
fear that the Catholic Church wishes to convert Orthodox believers.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the possibilities for John Paul, 82, to continue his
extensive travels much longer might be limited by his frailty, which
has been highly visible on this trip. The pope suffers from
Parkinson's disease that has left his hands trembling and his speech
often slurred. While here, he has delivered only small portions of
his speeches himself, turning to aides to read the remainder for him.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Orthodox leader, Metropolitan Simeon, suggested Saturday
that long trips might soon be beyond the pope's capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "His mission is his desire, but I think the people around him
should tell him to stop," Simeon said. "Who among us could do what he
is doing? No one but him. He is suffering like Christ."</TE>
<TE>   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls noted Saturday that "the
condition of the pope is visible to all."</TE>
<TE>   "He will continue to travel within these limitations," Navarro
told reporters. "The pope notes the big show of affection wherever he
goes, and this encourages him."</TE>
<TE>   John Paul is to visit Canada, Mexico and Guatemala in July and his
native Poland in August. The Vatican has also said he might visit
Croatia in September.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul met at the monastery with Prime Minister Simeon
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the former King Simeon II, who reigned as a child
and returned from exile last year to form a party that won
parliamentary elections. The pontiff paid respects at the grave of
the prime minister's father, King Boris III, which is at the
monastery.</TE>
<TE>   In his meeting with Orthodox leaders, John Paul appeared to allude
to the sex abuse scandals that have rocked the Catholic Church. Monks
wage a daily battle against "the evil suggestions that the demon
tries to plant in their hearts," and this "art" of "spiritual combat"
should be "taught anew ... to all Christians today," he said. "More
than ever in the lives of Christians today, idols are seductive and
temptations are unrelenting."</TE>
<TE>   John Paul traveled to and from the monastery by helicopter, then
met later in the day with the leader of Bulgaria's Muslim community
and with local Catholics. There are just 80,000 Catholics in this
predominantly Orthodox nation of 8 million people.</TE>
<TE>   When John Paul greeted well-wishers from his bulletproof
popemobile, Vatican security guards picked up toddlers in the crowd
and handed them up to receive a kiss from the pontiff.</TE>
<TE>   The pope also greeted and embraced an elderly priest who had spent
more than 20 years imprisoned by Bulgaria's former Communist
government.</TE>
<TE>   The chief mufti of Bulgaria's Muslims, Selim Mumun Mehmed, said in
an interview before meeting the pontiff that after nearly half a
century of Communist propagation of unbelief, John Paul's visit would
help reawaken faith in all religions in Bulgaria, including Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, the pope is carrying out a crusade for peace, forgiveness
and mutual understanding," Mehmed said. "We highly appreciate his
words about Islam. I think John Paul has found the most correct way
to people's souls. There may never again be another pope like him."</TE>

<HD>Priest's Link to Drug Lords Fuels Concern</HD>
<DH>Mexico: Father Gerardo Montano is at center of controversy
over his alleged actions on behalf of the notorious Arellano Felix
brothers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ENSENADA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Until recently, Father Gerardo Montano was just another anonymous and
overworked padre running a parish on this fast-growing town's
southern fringe.</LD>
<LD>   Now his years-ago friendship with the Arellano Felix brothers, who
once led one of the world's most powerful drug cartels, has
catapulted him into controversy and raised questions about the drug
gang's relations with the church.</LD>
<LD>   The case of Father Montano has also added fuel to a debate on the
clergy's responsibilities to the Mexican justice system, just weeks
after Mexican bishops defended the church's practice of keeping
incidents of sexual abuse by priests secret.</LD>
<TE>   A new book by a former Mexican attorney general alleges that
Montano broke the law by acting as go-between for brothers Ramon and
Benjamin Arellano Felix in their respective meetings with papal
nuncio Girolamo Prigione in Mexico City in December 1993 and January
1994, to absolve themselves of responsibility for the death of
Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo.</TE>
<TE>   Montano admits that he arranged the meetings even though he knew
the brothers were wanted men.</TE>
<TE>   The first audience with the pope's representative came seven
months after the killing of Posadas Ocampo at the Guadalajara airport
during a shootout between the Arellano Felix gang and a rival
drug-smuggling band.</TE>
<TE>   "To clarify the murder of Posadas, who was my friend, was the only
motive for my actions," Montano, who was ordained by Posadas Ocampo
in 1978, said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   Montano had known several members of the Arellano Felix family
since the late 1970s, when he was their parish priest. He was closest
to Benjamin's wife, Ruth, who had been active in his parish long
before her marriage to the cartel's "chief executive." Montano
baptized three of the couple's four children.</TE>
<TE>   Until Benjamin's March 10 arrest in Puebla and Ramon's Feb. 10
death in a police shootout in Mazatlan, U.S. law enforcement
officials viewed the brothers as among the most vicious criminals in
the world.</TE>
<TE>   Montano, 51, acknowledged his friendship with the Arellano
Felixes, who he said had a "human side" as devout Roman Catholics
concerned for their children and "as people who wanted to repent and
present their side." Montano, who grew up in Tijuana, says he didn't
know until after the cardinal was killed "what kind of business [the
Arellano Felix brothers] were managing."</TE>
<TE>   In another recent interview, former Atty. Gen. Jorge Carpizo
MacGregor, the author of the new book, scoffed at that notion.
"That's as if someone living in Chicago in the 1920s were saying they
didn't know who Al Capone was," Carpizo said.</TE>
<TE>   Carpizo alleges in his book that Montano should have turned the
pair over to police and that the priest falsified church baptism
records to give two Arellano Felix brothers alibis on the day of the
cardinal's death. He hints that Montano's motives were pecuniary,
that in exchange for cooperation he received financial support for
the "Versailles-like" Tijuana seminary of which he was treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Priest Says It Was 'Matter of Conscience'</TE>
<TE>   At his church in a windblown barrio of shacks and unpaved streets
here, Montano defended his decision to keep silent about the
brothers, saying it isn't the business of priests to denounce anyone
"in matters of conscience."</TE>
<TE>   The tall, affable priest, who likes to laugh and crack jokes, was
clearly upset by the accusations in Carpizo's book.</TE>
<TE>   He flatly rejected Carpizo's charges that he falsified church
baptismal records on May 24, 1993, a Monday, to show that Benjamin
and his brother Javier were at the Tijuana ceremony on the day the
cardinal was killed in Guadalajara. Most baptisms in Mexico take
place on Saturdays.</TE>
<TE>   Carpizo's version of the killing maintains that Javier was in
Guadalajara when the gunfight took place, as was Ramon.</TE>
<TE>   "The baptism happened, and the brothers were there," Montano
countered.</TE>
<TE>   He denied having received any financial help from the drug cartel,
and he rejected Carpizo's assertion that the Tijuana seminary is
ostentatious, saying that the former attorney general has never seen
it.</TE>
<TE>   "We of the church believe in the conscience of people, and we are
there to help them, above all those who are the most scorned. And
[the Arellano Felixes] were pursued by land, sea and sky," Montano
said.</TE>
<TE>   "At one time, if a girl got pregnant in Merida or there was a
shipwreck in Colima, they were blamed for it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Canonical Law May Justify His Silence</TE>
<TE>   Montano's decision to remain silent is based on canonical law,
said Professor Mario Medina of Mexico City's Pontifical University.</TE>
<TE>   Although Montano didn't hear either brother's confession, which
would have more strictly bound him to silence, he had the option of
remaining silent about his knowledge of alleged crimes or criminals,
facing neither a "mandate nor a prohibition," Medina said.</TE>
<TE>   Carpizo's book has reopened divisions in Mexico over the
cardinal's death. Carpizo and two other attorneys general have found
that Posadas Ocampo's killing was accidental and that the churchman
was killed by "confused" Arellano Felix gunmen who mistook him for
rival capo Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.</TE>
<TE>   But high church officials, including Guadalajara Cardinal Juan
Sandoval Iniguez, Posadas Ocampo's successor, want the case reopened,
saying the slain prelate could have been the victim of a plot.</TE>
<TE>   Various conspiracy theories have circulated over the years,
including one positing that Posadas Ocampo was killed in retribution
for alleged links to one drug gang or another or that he had
information about government negligence in a natural gas pipeline
explosion in Guadalajara that killed more than 200 people in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Three government investigations, including Carpizo's, dismissed
the conspiracy theories. On Friday, the current attorney general's
office confirmed that it opened a fourth investigation last June,
citing new information.</TE>
<TE>   It may be coincidence, but Montano's priestly trajectory has
changed radically since the slaying of the cardinal and since his
association with the Arellano Felix family surfaced publicly in 1994.
He said he never saw either Arellano Felix brother after the nuncio
meetings, although he did see Benjamin's wife at their house in Chula
Vista, south of San Diego, around 1996. "She felt tormented, that the
entire world was pursuing her," Montano said.</TE>
<TE>   After heading two prosperous Tijuana parishes, acting as seminary
treasurer and supervising fund-raising activities for Tijuana's new
cathedral, Montano has moved several times since 1994 to parishes in
Sacramento and San Ysidro in California before returning to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   He now leads a fast-growing parish in Ensenada, Our Lady of
Carmen, which serves 70,000 residents, many in substandard housing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's given me a new panorama and new experiences. I'm not hiding
from anyone. I am here in a very poor and crowded parish to help
people living under very bad conditions and scarce resources," said
Montano, adding that he is looking for a sister parish in San Diego
that might help.</TE>

<HD>Bush, Putin Oppose Pakistan's Tests</HD>
<DH>South Asia: Islamabad proceeds despite condemnation. India
says Musharraf may be flexing his muscle for internal reasons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Russia</DL>
<LD>As Pakistani missile tests sent a wave of new tension across South
Asia, President Bush and Russian President Vladimir V. Putin stood
side by side Saturday calling for Pakistan and India to avoid
escalating their conflict into open war.</LD>
<LD>   In the contested Himalayan region of Kashmir, Indian and Pakistani
troops fired mortars and used small arms along the cease-fire line,
part of a border where the two nuclear-armed countries have deployed
1 million troops.</LD>
<LD>   "The testing while there is escalating tension really aggravates
the situation, and Russia is concerned and sorry about that," Putin
said.</LD>
<TE>   But despite the concern expressed after Saturday's test, Pakistan
continued its planned tests today with a second launch.</TE>
<TE>   Putin and Bush spoke to reporters during a tour of the Hermitage
museum, part of the last full day of a visit to Russia by Bush that
began Thursday. They were spending it in this city on the Gulf of
Finland that is Putin's hometown.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said his administration was "making it clear to both parties
that there is no benefit of a war; there's no benefit of a clash that
could eventually lead to a broader war."</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, he called on Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to
adhere to a promise Musharraf made in January to halt incursions of
his troops across the border.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that the Indians know that he is going to fulfill
that promise," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Putin urged both Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee to join a regional summit early next month in
Almaty, Kazakhstan, to which both have been invited. An Indian
spokeswoman said Saturday that Vajpayee would attend; Musharraf has
not made his plans known.</TE>
<TE>   However, Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan
offered a positive response to Putin's pressure, telling the
country's state-run news agency: "Pakistan has all along been
pleading for settlement of all issues with India through dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, accompanying Bush on a
weeklong trip to Germany, Russia, France and Italy, singled out the
dispatch of Pakistani troops across the border, which he said was
"very destabilizing and is a course of tension and has contributed to
the situation we find ourselves in."</TE>
<TE>   He said he spoke with Musharraf twice Thursday and with the Indian
foreign minister Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Killings in Kashmir</TE>
<TE>   The clashes in Kashmir on Saturday killed at least three suspected
Islamic militants and two Indian soldiers, the Indian army reported.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's missile exercise, meanwhile, tested a device with a
range of 900 miles, easily enough to reach India from deep inside
Pakistani territory. Pakistan said it was the first of several
planned tests.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian government reacted coolly. "We didn't take it too
seriously," Vajpayee said.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Nirupama Rao also shrugged off the
test, suggesting that it was aimed at exhibiting Pakistan's strength
for political purposes at home.</TE>
<TE>   "One fails to understand why Pakistan has chosen this moment to
deplete one of the ready-made missiles in its stock," she said. "It
could possibly be directed at domestic audiences in Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. and Russian officials appeared alarmed--if not by the
individual test, then by the pattern of growing conflict and the
decision to perform the test now, rather than at a calmer moment.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you have two armies that close to one another and this
level of tension, there is the likelihood of an outbreak of
hostilities. And when both are nuclear armed, that should cause all
of us concern," Powell said at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   He too encouraged the Indian and Pakistani leaders to attend the
long-planned Almaty meeting, in which Putin is expected to
participate.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said that although the missile test did not necessarily
bring the two sides closer to war, "I don't think it was a terribly
useful thing to do right now."</TE>
<TE>   But after the U.S. and Russian statements, the tests continued.
Today, Pakistan successfully conducted the first test of a Hatf III
missile, also known as the Ghaznavi, which has a range of 176 miles,
Radio Pakistan said. Both missiles are capable of carrying
conventional and nuclear warheads.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Assurances Given</TE>
<TE>   At his news conference, Powell also said that U.S. officials had
spoken with Musharraf several times since he pledged to halt the
incursions and had won assurances that they would end.</TE>
<TE>   But the United States has limited pressure it can apply on
Musharraf, who has been the country's single most important ally in
the war on terrorism in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Putin and Bush signed a new treaty designed to
drastically reduce the number of nuclear weapons deployed by the U.S.
and Russia. On Saturday, in speaking jointly with no sign of
difference between them about the tensions in South Asia, they
demonstrated in one more way how the two countries have grown closer
in foreign policy. Until recently, they saw India and Pakistan as
rival spheres of influence, with Russia allied with New Delhi and the
United States allied more with the government in Islamabad.</TE>

<HD>Jet Crashes Off Taiwan With 225 People Aboard</HD>
<DH>Disaster: There are no reports of survivors on the flight
to Hong Kong. The plane was the oldest in the airline's fleet of
jumbo jets, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL and TSAI TING-I</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>TAIPEI, Taiwan</DL>
<LD>A China Airlines jet carrying 225 people on a flight from Taipei to
Hong Kong crashed into the Taiwan Strait on Saturday, Taiwanese
aviation officials said. There were no reports of survivors as night
fell over the crash site, about 170 miles southwest of this capital.</LD>
<LD>   Airline executives told reporters that Flight CI-611 disappeared
from radar screens about 3:30 p.m., about 20 minutes into the 1
1/2-hour flight from Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek airport to Hong Kong.
Most of the 206 passengers and the 19 crew members were Taiwanese.
Many families on board were heading for vacations in mainland China.</LD>
<LD>   Taiwanese Transportation Minister Lin Lin-san said there was no
hint of trouble and no warning from the crew before the crash. "The
plane abruptly disappeared from the radar," he told reporters.</LD>
<TE>   Taiwanese television stations aired footage Saturday evening
showing farmers several miles from the crash site picking up debris
from the cabin, including bits of in-flight magazines and small items
bearing the China Airlines logo. The condition of the debris
immediately led to speculation that the plane might have exploded in
midair.</TE>
<TE>   Tsai Duei, a vice minister of transportation, initially said the
plane broke apart in the sky, but later he said investigators were
uncertain what happened, Associated Press reported. Officials could
not say whether there was an explosion.</TE>
<TE>   "Because it's at sea, we can't know what happened without concrete
evidence," said Taiwanese Prime Minister Yu Shyi-kun.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, airline officials said that rough seas were hampering
recovery efforts but that 35 bodies had been retrieved and about 100
others were visible in the water.</TE>
<TE>   The crash was the latest blot on China Airlines' abysmal safety
record, one of the worst in civil aviation. The carrier suffered
three major crashes over a six-year period during the 1990s in which
470 people died. In an attempt to restore the airline's reputation,
much of the senior management was replaced two years ago. The
government brought in Christine Tsung, an executive with no
significant aviation industry experience, to shape a new corporate
culture.</TE>
<TE>   The last China Airlines disaster was in 1999 in Hong Kong, when
three of 315 people aboard an MD-11 airliner were killed during a
crash landing. Earlier, China Airlines Airbus A300 crashes in Taipei
and Nagoya, Japan, claimed 467 lives.</TE>
<TE>   Airline officials said the plane that crashed Saturday was the
oldest in its fleet of 29 jumbo jets and the only remaining 747-200
still operated by China Airlines. The 200 series is one of the
earliest versions of the 747 and began flying in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the last one," said airline spokesman Paul Wang. He said
that the plane, which was nearly 23 years old, was scheduled to be
sold to a company based in Thailand, but that the sale was held up
because of financial difficulties on the part of the potential buyer.
Wang stressed that the plane had consistently passed frequent
airworthiness inspections.</TE>
<TE>   After news of the crash was made public, China Airlines officials
in Taipei and Hong Kong called together relatives.</TE>
<TE>   In Taipei, relatives and friends of about 50 passengers met with
airline staffers at the airport hotel. A non-Taiwanese man, who
identified himself as El-Hinn Ibrahim, screamed that he wanted to
"pull down China Airlines."</TE>
<TE>   Ibrahim said his wife, two sisters and a brother-in-law were
aboard the plane en route to a vacation in northern China.</TE>
<TE>   Late Saturday, the airline flew about 90 relatives of the victims
to the tiny island town of Penghu, about 20 miles from the crash site
off Taiwan's western coast, where rescue and recovery efforts were
based.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tsai reported from Taipei and Marshall from Hong Kong. Times
researcher Tammy Wong in Hong Kong contributed to this report.</TE>

<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Russia</DL>
<LD>Did you hear about the sturgeon with stitches? How about the empress'
lover?</LD>
<LD>   Lighthearted banter with President Vladimir V. Putin marked
President Bush's second full day in Russia on Saturday--an
"unofficial" day of sightseeing and art appreciation here in the
country's cultural capital.</LD>
<LD>   The two presidents sparred playfully during a discussion with
students at St. Petersburg University. They even exchanged jokes at
each other's expense while touring Russia's most prestigious art
museum, the Hermitage.</LD>
<TE>   The verbal horseplay was not just a sign that the two leaders have
become personal friends, as they asserted repeatedly during the last
two days. It was also a sign of what appears to be a fundamental
change in U.S.-Russian relations.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the Bush administration, U.S. officials took a hard-line
approach to Russia, complaining that Bush's predecessor, President
Clinton, had been too personally involved with former Russian
President Boris N. Yeltsin and that coldblooded pragmatism should
dominate the bilateral relationship. Putin's Kremlin responded
testily with complaints about U.S. unilateralism--and hints that
Moscow might decide to re-escalate the arms race.</TE>
<TE>   A little more than a year later, the two presidents were ribbing
each other like schoolboys.</TE>
<TE>   During a photo op at the Hermitage, Putin described how he had
pulled Bush's leg at dinner the previous night. Over a course of
Russian caviar, Putin told his guests that after cutting sturgeon
open to harvest caviar--their eggs--experts stitch the fish up and
return them to the wild.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really trying to tell them that I was telling the truth,
[that] that's how we treat the environment," Putin said. "This is a
state secret: ... There was only one person who wouldn't laugh and
said, 'I do believe you, Mr. President.' And that was the president
of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Putin did not say whether Bush was gullible or just being a good
sport by playing along. Regardless, Bush held his own a few minutes
later.</TE>
<TE>   As the museum tour drew to a close, the institution's director
pointed out a portrait of Catherine the Great, the founder of the
Hermitage. Without missing a beat, Bush quipped, "By the way, where
is the portrait of Potemkin?"--a sly reference to Catherine's lover
and aide, Prince Grigory Potemkin.</TE>
<TE>   Potemkin is best remembered for deceiving the empress into
believing that the Russian countryside was prosperous by lining the
banks of the Volga River with facades of picturesque villages and
with well-dressed peasants who waved as she cruised past.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since, excessive and false efforts to impress important
guests--like visiting presidents--have been denounced as "Potemkin
villages."</TE>
<TE>   "Bush didn't lose the humor battle," said Alexei Melnikov, a
21-year-old economics student who was in the audience for the two
leaders' university appearance. "It's a little surprising that they
get along so well together."</TE>
<TE>   Less than a year ago, Bush administration officials who visited
Moscow were in the habit of lecturing Russian officials about the end
of the Cold War--remarks generally understood in Russia to be an
assertion of American unilateralism and a display of American
arrogance.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Russian officials, particularly military officers and
nationalist politicians, would express nostalgia for the days when
the Soviet Union was a superpower and insist that Russia was still a
force to be reckoned with.</TE>
<TE>   All that has changed.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, since the two presidents held their first meeting in
Slovenia last June, Russia has moved to policy positions more
consistent with those of a second-tier regional power. During this
summit, Putin stressed the need for good economic and trade
relations.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need above all for Russia is an absolutely
nondiscriminatory access to world markets and to U.S. markets," Putin
told the university students. "We don't need preferences. We don't
need subsidies. We don't need special favors. We just want normal,
simple, ordinary, fair trade relations."</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the Bush administration has stopped emphasizing that
Russia isn't a superpower and started treating it like what it is: a
regional power with an outsize nuclear arsenal. Although the
administration wanted to avoid signing a legally binding treaty, it
eventually relented.</TE>
<TE>   The arms reduction pact signed Friday appears to be tacit
acknowledgment that the one area in which Russia still ranks almost
equal to the United States is nuclear weaponry.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that this summit was the first in which the two
countries appear to have reached a level of comfort with Russia's new
status. Timing the trip between visits to Germany and France seemed
to emphasize that Russia has become similar to them: a powerful if
often cantankerous ally.</TE>
<TE>   "Mutual understanding is increased," Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell told reporters Saturday. "We have these same relationships
with our friends in Europe. You saw it with [German] Chancellor
[Gerhard] Schroeder the other day. You will see it, I'm quite sure,
with [French] President [Jacques] Chirac."</TE>
<TE>   In the final analysis, the Moscow-St. Petersburg summit was short
on substance. The arms control agreement, now dubbed the Treaty of
Moscow, not only was expected but also codified reductions that both
sides had planned to make on their own.</TE>
<TE>   The United States failed to deliver on promises to repeal the
anachronistic Jackson-Vanik Amendment of 1974, which ties trade
benefits to Jewish emigration, or to formally recognize Russia as a
market economy, which would ease other trade regulations.</TE>
<TE>   There was no breakthrough--indeed, no apparent movement--on the
long-standing dispute over Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran.</TE>
<TE>   In that light, the fact that the summit was long on friendly
banter might not be surprising. But whether it solidified a beautiful
relationship remains to be seen.</TE>

<HD>Train Wreck Kills 205</HD>
<DH>Disaster: About 400 are hurt in crash involving two trains
after one derails in Mozambique. The cause is unclear.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>MAPUTO, Mozambique</DL>
<LD>At least 205 people were killed and 400 hurt in a train crash in
Mozambique on Saturday, Health Ministry officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "We have now received 205 bodies," said Dr. Yacoob Omar, a
director at Maputo's main hospital.</LD>
<LD>   One passenger who survived the disaster said a derailment occurred
after engineers separated freight cars from passenger cars to scale a
steep hill.</LD>
<TE>   Radio Mozambique quoted police and fire department sources as
saying the train had technical problems with its brakes.</TE>
<TE>   The crash occurred Saturday morning near the town of Tenga in
Maputo province, 25 miles from the Mozambique capital, Maputo,
Transportation Minister Tomas Salomao said.</TE>
<TE>   The passenger cars were heading to Ressano Garcia on the border
with South Africa--a popular weekend trip for Mozambicans going
shopping in South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Details of the crash were still scant.</TE>
<TE>   Once the cars were split into separate trains--one hauling cement,
one carrying passengers--one of them rammed the other, causing a
derailment, one witness said.</TE>
<TE>   Reports varied as to which train hit which.</TE>
<TE>   Three passenger cars were reduced to mangled wrecks, and bodies
littered the crash site--thrown out of the train on impact or crushed
under the weight of cement and other goods, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   Rescue workers with tractors and construction equipment were
trying to free people trapped in the trains' twisted wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   President Joaquim Chissano canceled meetings in southern
Mozambique and returned to the capital. He visited the Maputo
hospital mortuary and wards.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the hospital, ward floors were covered in blood, and
workers rushed to try to clean them before the president's visit. The
task appeared to be in vain.</TE>
<TE>   The president stood in silence, watching one wailing woman who was
awaiting treatment for a gash on her head.</TE>
<TE>   Most of dead and injured were thought to be Mozambican.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a massive tragedy," Chissano said.</TE>
<TE>   The Cabinet announced a three-day mourning period starting today,
and said flags would fly at half-staff.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials issued an urgent appeal for blood.</TE>
<TE>   Omar also said the hospital had appealed to doctors and health
workers in the private sector to help treat the injured.</TE>
<TE>   Salomao blamed the crash on the national railway company and said
it would have to pay compensation.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we have to deal with funerals and the people who are being
treated in the hospitals," he told state television. "Then we will
establish the type of assistance people need."</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Libombo, an official from the national railway company,
said he did not know what caused the crash and declined to comment on
Salomao's statement.</TE>
<TE>   Small railway crashes happen with some frequency in Mozambique,
but Saturday's accident was by far the largest in recent years. Most
of the crashes have been blamed on human error, and there have been
public demands for better training of railway staff members.</TE>

<DH>Colombia: Likely new president has been targeted by
guerrillas and accused of drug ties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>This nation's violence has marked Alvaro Uribe like a firing squad
wall.</LD>
<LD>   Three of his childhood friends, all brothers, grew up to be
infamous drug traffickers. His father was killed by leftist
guerrillas. He helped create citizens defense groups that human
rights activists say evolved into vicious paramilitary gangs. He has
been the target of assassination attempts.</LD>
<LD>   Now the diminutive politician--whose center-right politics make
him a Colombian version of former New York Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani--is set to become the Latin nation's next president. Uribe,
49, holds a commanding lead going into the first round of voting
today, with polls showing him close to winning the 50% of the vote
needed to avoid a runoff.</LD>
<TE>   He insists that his personal history matters less than his desire
to set Colombia right.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not bent on vengeance," Uribe said in a telephone interview.
"I'm running because I feel a commitment to change my country, to
give a new generation a better country than the one our generation
received."</TE>
<TE>   If he wins, Uribe has promised to take on the guerrillas, who have
battled the government for nearly four decades. He wants to double
the size of the military, boost the defense budget and persuade the
United States to directly fund the anti-guerrilla war here.</TE>
<TE>   But for many in Colombia, as well as in Washington, Uribe remains
something of a mystery, a newcomer to the national stage whose past
is filled with both victory and violence.</TE>
<TE>   Colombians have embraced Uribe as a hard-liner--even a right-wing
extremist--bent on beating the guerrillas into submission. His
popularity peaked in February at nearly 60%, shortly before the
collapse of three years of peace talks that had seen the rebels grow
in power and reach.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas have taken the threat seriously. By his count,
Uribe has survived 15 assassination attempts, the most recent a bomb
attack in April that left four people dead and destroyed the armored
car in which he was riding. Uribe no longer campaigns in public for
safety reasons.</TE>
<TE>   But by U.S. political standards, Uribe is a moderate with a
conservative bent, a mix of pragmatist and populist. He is described
by friends as intense, focused, bookish.</TE>
<TE>   His most controversial proposal, taken as proof of his militant
stance, has been the creation of a million-member citizens defense
group, armed with radios, to alert the army to impending violence.
Critics charge that it will only turn civilians into targets.</TE>
<TE>   But in a 100-point agenda, Uribe has also proposed slashing the
size of Congress, creating 1.5 million educational slots for students
and lifting trade restrictions to boost job creation.</TE>
<TE>   What remains unclear is whether Uribe, running as an independent,
will have the ability to get his agenda through Congress. Even more
uncertain is whether Colombia's failing economy will allow him to
implement his ambitious goals.</TE>
<TE>   More than anything, Uribe is a man of contradictions. A politician
with a gripping life story, he comes off in person as a humorless
technocrat. An avowed proponent of law and order, he spent two
academic sabbaticals abroad studying education reform and peace
negotiation strategies.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe's closest competitor is Horacio Serpa, a traditional
politician who has failed to excite Colombians. Polls show Uribe
trouncing Serpa if there is a June runoff.</TE>
<TE>   "Uribe is more complicated and has a wider range than most people
think," said Malcolm Deas, an Oxford professor who studied with Uribe
and is a Colombia expert. "I don't think he's a single-issue
politician."</TE>
<TE>   Uribe is also a man dogged by controversies, so many that they
have spawned a hastily written unauthorized biography subtitled "Lord
of the Shadows."</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups have questioned his relationship with
Colombia's violent right-wing paramilitary groups. Journalists have
tried to link him and close associates to narco-traffickers. Other
reporters have accused Uribe of threatening them.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe dismisses the accusations, which have been neither proven
nor well documented. Most seem to rest on guilt by association.</TE>
<TE>   A close advisor, Pedro Juan Moreno, once had a shipment of
chemicals seized by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration on
suspicion that they would be used for manufacturing cocaine. Moreno,
who was never criminally charged and whose company was recognized as
being "reputable" in a later hearing, called Uribe "honest and
hard-working."</TE>
<TE>   Uribe's financial support comes mainly from Colombia's top 300
companies, according to Alberto Velazquez, his campaign treasurer.
The country's attorney general recently reviewed about 2,000 donors
and concluded that none of them had paramilitary links. Colombian law
does not require the release of donor names until after elections, so
the claim could not be further investigated.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe said his record speaks for itself.</TE>
<TE>   "On one side is my trajectory of 30 years in politics in
Colombia," he said. "On the other side, you have rumors and gossip
and attacks. You can compare yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Uribe was born July 4, 1952, in the province of Antioquia,
Colombia's heartland. The place looms in the nation's consciousness
as a land of mythic proportions--the hardest-working farmers, the
biggest families, the most violent crimes. Pablo Escobar, the late
drug lord, came from Antioquia.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe's family rose from middle-class origins to own ranches
throughout Antioquia's soaring mountains and verdant plains. Uribe's
father traveled by helicopter to visit his far-flung spreads.</TE>
<TE>   The family's love of horses frequently brought its members into
contact with the Ochoa clan, close partners with Escobar in the
freewheeling narco era of the 1980s and early 1990s. Uribe competed
in dressage shows against the three Ochoa brothers but said he now
has no contact with them.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship, however, has served to feed the rumors of his
involvement in drug dealing. As head of Colombia's equivalent of the
Federal Aviation Administration, he granted pilot licenses and
airstrip building permits to people later accused of using them to
transport drugs.</TE>
<TE>   But in interviews, Uribe has denied any knowledge of such
intentions, saying that underlings provided the licenses only after
applicants passed police background checks.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe showed an interest in politics early: From the time he was a
boy, he told his brothers and sisters that he wanted to be president,
and he participated in Liberal Party politics in college.</TE>
<TE>   After wending through Colombia's political patronage system in a
series of bureaucratic jobs, he was appointed mayor of Medellin,
Colombia's second-largest city, when he was 30.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle of his term, he experienced the most dramatic turn
of his life. His father, flying into a family ranch in June 1983 with
a brother and sister, walked into an ambush mounted by leftist rebels
from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   In the blaze of gunfire that followed, his father was killed, his
brother was wounded, and his sister was nearly kidnapped.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe insists that the experience didn't affect his outlook toward
the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he says, his pledge to increase military spending stems
from his belief that the guerrillas won't negotiate in good faith
until the army has established its presence throughout the nation,
40% of which is controlled by the rebels in mostly rural, unpopulated
areas.</TE>
<TE>   "I became quite sad because of the assassination of my father, but
... there is no link between the assassination of my father and my
running for president," Uribe said.</TE>
<TE>   After his father's death, Uribe went on to serve as a city
councilman, then senator, when he first showed a taste for
privatization.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, he took a break from politics to spend a year pursuing a
special certificate in administration at the Harvard Extension
School.</TE>
<TE>   During that time, he sat in on a weeklong course taught by Roger
Fisher, a professor whose specialty is conflict negotiation.</TE>
<TE>   When Uribe returned to Colombia, he invited Fisher down to teach.
Since then, Uribe claims, more than 82,000 Colombians have gone
through the course.</TE>
<TE>   "He was keenly interested in the way people conduct conflicts,"
Fisher said. "He wanted me to teach that there were less adversarial
ways of negotiating."</TE>
<TE>   The paradox of Uribe's interest in the peace process is that it
coincided with the most controversial part of his political career:
the so-called pacification of Uraba, a region of Antioquia. When
Uribe took over as governor of Antioquia in 1995, Uraba was in chaos,
reeling from a "dirty war" between the guerrillas and paramilitary
groups. By the time he left three years later, the dirty war was all
but over.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups suggest a reason: Uribe supported the army as
it worked with the paramilitary groups to clear the zone of suspected
rebels and sympathizers.</TE>
<TE>   Most significant, Uribe promoted the creation of a sort of
aggressive neighborhood watch program called Convivir. The Convivir
groups, some of them armed, some of them bearing only radios, worked
with the military to warn of suspicious activities.</TE>
<TE>   But these groups quickly spun out of control, becoming
paramilitary gangs, the rights groups charge. Left behind, they say,
was a trail of dead civilians and extrajudicial executions and a
massive stream of refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe emphatically denies any cooperation with the paramilitary
groups, and there is no evidence of direct links. His supporters
attribute the troubled region's turnaround to better cooperation
between locals and the army.</TE>
<TE>   Retired Gen. Rito Alejo del Rio, an Uribe supporter who was then
in charge of the region, said Uribe fully backed his efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Del Rio now faces charges of paramilitary collusion before a
civilian court and was stripped of his U.S. visa for alleged ties to
the paramilitary groups and drug dealing. He denies any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "Uribe is an honest man who will move this country forward," Del
Rio said. "He demonstrated that in order to move forward, you must
show authority."</TE>

<HD>Andersen Fights Feds' Bid on Jury Instructions</HD>
<DH>Trial: Prosecutors want jurors to know that some executives
at the accounting firm refused to testify about the collapse of
client Enron.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIANNE HART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Prosecutors and defense attorneys in the Arthur Andersen obstruction
of justice trial sparred Saturday over whether jurors should be told
that some accounting firm executives refused to testify.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon scheduled the unusual weekend
session, held outside the jury's presence, to hear arguments on the
government's request that she tell the jury that certain Andersen
employees who were asked to testify refused. In past weeks, as the
prosecution presented its case, three Andersen employees asserted
their 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen, the nation's fifth-largest accounting firm, is accused
of obstructing a federal investigation into whether fraud caused its
client Enron Corp. to collapse.</LD>
<TE>   If convicted, Andersen automatically would lose its ability to
audit public companies.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's defense lawyers argued that jurors will draw a negative
inference about why the three witnesses, including Andersen in-house
lawyer Nancy Temple, invoked the 5th Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the most breathtaking positions" the government
has taken, said Andersen attorney Denis McInerney. "It's an
unprecedented proposal, and it's totally improper."</TE>
<TE>   "We're not asking for an instruction that they invoked their 5th
Amendment rights," countered prosecutor Samuel Buell.</TE>
<TE>   "We are asking that the jury be told the fact that we called them
and they refused to testify, but that they should not speculate why
or draw a conclusion from the refusal."</TE>
<TE>   Harmon acknowledged the defense notion that "'refuse to testify'
connotes mob bosses before the House Un-American [Activities]
Committee."</TE>
<TE>   But she sought to "find some words that would tell the jury the
government tried to get the witnesses to testify" that wouldn't
trigger a negative image.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not possible to do that," McInerney shot back. "You're going
to break new ground here, which is ground that should not be gone
into.... Everybody knows exactly what is going on. It will be an
inference that will be held against Arthur Andersen because they are
Andersen employees."</TE>
<TE>   Harmon postponed a decision on final jury instructions until after
the defense rests. Prosecutors finished presenting their case Friday.
The trial resumes Monday, with the first witness for Andersen
expected to testify.</TE>

<HD>HMOs to Face Payment Pressure</HD>
<DH>Managed care: State regulations would force insurers to
disclose reimbursement rates and settle claims with providers
promptly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid growing rancor nationally over the way HMOs pay their claims,
California officials are pushing through new regulations that would
hold health insurers far more accountable for paying doctors and
hospitals on time.</LD>
<LD>   The regulations, which have not yet been publicized, are among the
toughest in the nation. They include stronger monitoring requirements
for health maintenance organizations and would force insurers to
disclose their fee rates for individual medical services and
procedures, which some insurance companies have been reluctant to do.</LD>
<LD>   The provisions also would make it harder for insurers to bounce
claims back to providers with requests for more medical
information--one of a number of tactics that regulators say has been
used to delay payments beyond the 45-day limit set by law.</LD>
<TE>   Tens of thousands of medical claims are delayed or disputed every
month in California. Health insurers blame that mostly on incomplete
claims filings. But some physicians, fed up with fighting insurers
over bills, say they have stopped doing business with some insurance
companies, potentially jeopardizing patients' access to care.</TE>
<TE>   "Too often they don't pay doctors on time, and that has an effect
on patient care," said Daniel Zingale, director of the Department of
Managed Health Care, which drafted the regulations as part of the
state's prompt-pay law that took effect last year. The department
oversees HMOs as well as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield preferred
provider organizations in California.</TE>
<TE>   The new regulations are likely to be implemented this fall after a
period for public comments.</TE>
<TE>   Health insurance executives are expected to raise strong
objections to the measures. When told of the regulations, they said
some of the rules were unnecessary, arbitrary and will ultimately
drive up costs for consumers at a time when premiums are already
soaring. The national HMO association said that insurers have very
high compliance rates with prompt-pay laws and that in many cases the
delays are the result of two major issues: eligibility requirements
and multiple filings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a solution in search of a problem," Health Net spokesman
David Olson said of the new regulations. Neither Health Net nor other
insurers would say whether they would challenge the measures in
court, but regulators seemed to be anticipating that possibility.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Billing Disputes Spilling Into Courts</TE>
<TE>   Although billing disputes between insurers and health providers
have been around for years, they have taken on more intensity lately,
spilling into the courts and government offices throughout the
nation. They are part of the ongoing backlash against managed care
and reflect the frustrations of many doctors who have become
disenchanted with an increase in administrative hassles and an
erosion of autonomy and income.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, five medical societies around the country have
filed lawsuits against insurance companies for delaying or denying
payments.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, regulators from Florida to Texas to California have
levied fines totaling tens of millions of dollars against health
insurers over their handling of claims.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators say that when insurers don't pay on time or at all,
patients are caught in the middle. Sometimes patients are held
financially responsible for the bill. Left unpaid, consumers can
later discover that their credit record has been smeared by an
unresolved medical claim.</TE>
<TE>   When physicians cancel contracts with insurers or medical groups
over payment practices, patients might have more trouble seeing their
doctors or face higher out-of-pocket costs.</TE>
<TE>   Some doctors contend that insurers drag their feet in paying
claims to maximize the float they earn on interest in premium
dollars. But Janice Frates, a health-care administration expert at
Cal State Long Beach, who has studied issues of claims processing,
said: "It's not so much deliberately delaying payments as much as
putting them mindlessly through the cycle again and kicking them
back.''</TE>
<TE>   Since last year, California regulators have collected major fines
from PacifiCare Health Systems and Health Net, and have taken over
some smaller health plans for failing to pay doctors and hospitals.
Zingale called prompt pay a top priority for his department, saying
he planned to step up enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ted Mazer, an ear, nose and throat specialist in San Diego,
says claims problems are not just about late payments. In December,
he says, he billed Blue Cross of California $3,200 for a 3-hour-long
sinus surgery. His claim included charges for several procedures,
including work outside the nose and reducing an enlarged spongy bone
inside the nose known as a turbinate.</TE>
<TE>   But Blue Cross didn't see all those procedures as separate
billable items, and the insurer combined some of them, including the
turbinate reduction. Two months later, he received a check for
$1,265.32.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not only unfair but untenable," said Mazer, noting that it
is not uncommon for insurers to "bundle" or "downcode" claims, in
which a medical procedure will be coded under a related but cheaper
rate. Mazer, a solo practitioner, has a full-time employee devoted to
tracking claims, but sometimes he gets so frustrated that he pursues
the bills himself, with certified mail and phone calls threatening to
sue.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross spokesman Michael Chee, citing privacy concerns, said
he couldn't comment about Mazer's case. But Chee said procedural
codes may be bundled if Blue Cross views them as essentially one
service. As an example, he said, some physicians will bill two codes
for a mammogram--the procedure itself and the accompanying office
visit. "You can't do it separately, you get the consultation with the
mammogram," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Millions of Claims Processed Monthly</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross processes about 3 million claims a month. The company
provided a computer record showing that 97% to 99% of the claims
received in the last 12 months were paid in 30 days or less--well
within the state's legal requirement. The insurer did not, however,
provide further details about the 1% to 3% of bills that are held
up--which translate into tens of thousands of claims every month.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross, which is owned by publicly traded WellPoint Health
Networks of Thousand Oaks, has not been fined by the Department of
Managed Health Care for late payments. But the insurance carrier has
been a frequent target of criticism, partly because of its large size
and aggressive negotiating stance. Last year Blue Cross settled a
lawsuit filed by the Catholic Healthcare West hospital chain over
payment rates and delays. Financial terms were not released.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Catholic Healthcare West, which owns 38 hospitals
in California, said that Blue Cross has made good progress since the
settlement, but that in general the hospital company was still having
trouble getting timely payments from insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   Some insurers, such as Blue Shield of California, have tried to
work out a more friendly arrangement with doctors over payment
issues. Earlier this year the San Francisco-based insurer signed an
agreement with the California Medical Assn. to disclose physician fee
schedules--the rate at which each medical procedure or service is
reimbursed--and limit changes in them to no more than once a year.
(Blue Shield said that so far this year, it has paid 98% of its
claims within 45 days.)</TE>
<TE>   The new state regulations require insurers to disclose their
policies regarding reimbursement for multiple procedures and the
bundling of claims. Insurers would also have to give providers a
30-day notice before making changes to fee schedules. Some doctors
have complained that insurers change their fee rates at will without
giving prior notice.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure requirement doesn't mean physicians will get paid
more or see less bundling, but the new regulations create a process
for resolving disputes more quickly. Doctors say disclosure of fee
schedules will allow them to compare rates among health plans, which
could help them make better business decisions about their practice.</TE>
<TE>   The new regulations also would hold HMOs directly responsible for
monitoring medical groups with whom they contract, requiring the
health plans to file quarterly reports detailing how the physicians'
organizations are complying with the state's prompt-pay laws.</TE>
<TE>   This added oversight could be significant in California, which is
unlike most other places in that HMOs pay doctors' groups monthly
capitation fees--a preset amount per HMO member. Those fees are what
medical groups must manage in paying out claims that they receive
from their affiliated doctors. But physicians say that it is
sometimes just as hard to collect payments from medical groups as it
is when they bill the insurer directly.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators said that based on their review, one out of five
medical groups in California was not paying 95% of the claims to
doctors within 45 days of receiving bills. Zingale said that while
medical groups were being held to a standard of 95%, he was seeking
100% compliance from the health insurers--a rate that the national
HMO association called unreasonable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Rules Are Labeled One-Sided</TE>
<TE>   The new regulations were prepared in accordance with AB 1455,
which was passed in 2000. The legislation was pushed by the
California Medical Assn. and gave the Department of Managed Health
Care powers to investigate and impose sanctions against health plans
for unfair payment patterns to health providers.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Zelman, president of the California Assn. of Health Plans,
which represents most of the state's medical insurers, said his group
supported the original legislation. But he said that the newly
drafted rules are one-sided in the way they treat responsibility for
the prompt payment of claims.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not always clear whose fault it is. Claims may have been
filed wrong," he said. "There could be mistakes and failings on both
sides ... but if a provider or hospital does something wrong, there
is no equivalent sanction mechanism in place."</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Purchase Effort Dies</HD>
<DH>Business: The deal's collapse leaves the firm without a
buyer as bid deadline, auction near.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two Asian firms hoping to buy Global Crossing Ltd. out of
bankruptcy halted talks with the telecommunications company's lenders
Saturday because the two sides couldn't agree on price.</LD>
<LD>   The failed negotiations with Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and Singapore
Technologies Telemedia, announced by the companies Saturday, leaves
Global Crossing without a committed buyer as it moves toward a June
20 bid deadline and a planned auction of the company in early July.</LD>
<LD>   With no purchase agreement from the Asian firms, other potential
bidders no longer have a minimum price that they must top to acquire
the company.</LD>
<TE>   Bermuda-based Global Crossing listed debts of $12.4 billion and
assets of $22.4 billion when it filed for bankruptcy Jan. 28, making
it the fourth-largest U.S. bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which spent most of its money building a worldwide
fiber-optic network, listed total assets of $15.7 billion on its most
recent financial report to the court.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing also faces ongoing investigations into its
accounting practices from the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Hutchison and ST Telemedia pledged to pay $750 million
for a 79% stake in Global Crossing, but creditors rejected the bid as
too low. Talks aimed at setting a binding offer were extended until
midnight Friday, but they collapsed when the two firms refused to
increase their bid.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought the original bid was fair and reasonable, but the
creditors have a different view," said Steven Lipin, spokesman for
Hutchison. "It was all very amicable ... we're keeping our options
open."</TE>
<TE>   John Legere, Global Crossing's chief executive, said he is
disappointed that the Hutchison-ST Telemedia deal broke down. But he
said the companies may yet make a bid at the auction.</TE>
<TE>   By not forging a deal, Hutchison and ST Telemedia forfeited rights
to a $30-million breakup fee, which would have been paid to the firms
if they had made a binding offer that was later bettered by a rival
bid.</TE>
<TE>   Under a deal approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the two companies
will be reimbursed for up to $5 million in expenses associated with
their negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Ryan, an attorney for the committee of unsecured creditors,
said the group was steadfast in its demand for a higher price.</TE>
<TE>   "They did make efforts to try to bridge the gap, but on balance,
the parties were simply not able to reach agreement," Ryan said.</TE>
<TE>   The committee, he said, is happy with Global Crossing's operating
improvements and may well end up backing a plan for the company to
come out of bankruptcy on its own, with just a cash infusion.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think we're overplaying our hand ... we're quite
optimistic about the company's future," Ryan said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're certainly not entertaining any notions of liquidation at
this point," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Legere has said 60 companies have expressed interest in buying all
or part of Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Those said to be interested include private investment firms Texas
Pacific Group, Gores Technology Group and Platinum Equity, and
telecommunications companies Verizon Communications Inc., BT Group
and Deutsche Telekom.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, are not so optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   Recent bids for other troubled telecommunications firms have not
been encouraging. In December, IDT Corp. paid a mere $42.5 million
for bankrupt WinStar Communications Inc., a company with nearly $5
billion in assets and $200 million in annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The telecommunications industry has also deteriorated further
since Global Crossing's bankruptcy. FLAG Telecom, a rival fiber
company, and KPNQwest, an international carrier, both filed for
bankruptcy protection in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Legere says he's not worried.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to know who's actually going to put a bid on the
table," Legere said. "But the banks and creditors feel they have
something that is going to do very well in an auction."</TE>

<HD>Councilman Cleared Way for Koreatown Nightspots</HD>
<DH>City Hall: Holden says clubs boost economy. Others blame
them for crime, social ills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden, a crusader against
inner-city liquor businesses after the 1992 riots, has cleared the
way for dozens of bars and nightclubs to open in Koreatown, many
backed by his campaign contributors or represented by lobbyists with
close ties to him.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, Koreatown has become one of the city's busiest bar
zones. The change illustrates how much sway Los Angeles City Council
members have over what businesses locate in their districts. Police
and many residents blame the transformation in Koreatown for growing
crime and social ills in that neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Holden has touted some of the bars and nightclubs as generators of
economic growth and desirable businesses for the community. One of
the city's largest nightclubs, Le Prive, was able to open near the
intersection of Western Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard in 2000 after
Holden assured fellow council members and city regulators that it
would be an elegant dining establishment and good for the
neighborhood. He sent an aide to testify at a public hearing that the
club would be "a family-style restaurant" he would visit with his
granddaughter.</LD>
<TE>   Today, the club opens after 9 p.m. for an exclusive set of
customers who provide the names of waiters to gain entry. Food is
served only with liquor, and the minimum order is a $200 bottle of
whiskey. Le Prive's owners and their supporters contributed $8,000 to
Holden's 1999 reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   A Times review found that:</TE>
<TE>   * Many of the liquor-related businesses that Holden has supported
were represented by one of his top fund-raisers, lobbyist and zoning
consultant King Woods, or by Bill Robinson, a former City Hall aide
to the councilman.</TE>
<TE>   * One of Holden's deputies accepted $15,000 from a Koreatown
nightclub operator. The aide described the money as two interest-free
loans, now fully repaid.</TE>
<TE>   * Another Koreatown nightclub owner, who was imprisoned in South
Korea in 2000 on unrelated bribery charges, gave Holden a Rolex watch
in October 1997. In return, Holden gave the club owner a jeweled
brooch. Holden said the swap had nothing to do with city business.</TE>
<TE>   * The same Koreatown club owner donated $10,000 to the
unsuccessful Pasadena mayoral campaign of Holden's son after the
senior Holden solicited the contribution in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Holden said he is not influenced by campaign donations or his
relationships with liquor and nightclub interests.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't compromise," he said. "If you look at my record, you'll
see people have supported me and I voted against them anyway. From
the time I was a [state] senator until now, I've treated them all the
same."</TE>
<TE>   Holden, 72, who has been on the City Council since 1987, is in his
fourth and final term. Koreatown liquor interests were among the
largest donors to Holden's last two reelection campaigns,
contributing roughly 10% of the total he raised. Holden's 1995
campaign raised $62,800 from liquor business owners and consultants
representing them, according to campaign finance records. In the 1999
elections, those interests gave Holden $47,950.</TE>
<TE>   The donations are a testament to the power City Council members
wield over zoning. Liquor businesses are not automatically allowed
under city zoning codes, and approval for them is often difficult to
achieve.</TE>
<TE>   A council member's opinion usually carries great weight with
zoning administrators. And at the City Council, members traditionally
defer to a council member on zoning issues affecting his district.</TE>
<TE>   "In the planning process, the power of a councilman ... is almost
total," said former Councilman Arthur K. Snyder, a land-use lawyer
who once chaired the council's planning committee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A New Wave of Drinking Spots in Koreatown</TE>
<TE>   Koreatown, a densely populated area west of downtown, has had its
share of bars and nightclubs for decades. But a wave of new
late-night drinking spots arrived in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   H. Cooke Sunoo, who was the city's redevelopment manager for the
Wilshire Center-Koreatown area from 1993 to 1998, said many retail
stores, restaurants and service businesses in the area faltered
during the economic slump of the early 1990s. The 1992 riots added
calamitous damage. The shuttered stores and restaurants were often
replaced by bars, karaoke clubs, pool halls, cafes and other
businesses centered on nightlife.</TE>
<TE>   In the last five years alone, more than 40 zoning permits
involving alcohol sales have been granted in the Koreatown portion of
Holden's district.</TE>
<TE>   The Western-Wilshire neighborhood around Le Prive, for instance,
has about twice as many liquor establishments relative to population
as is called for in state guidelines. That area now has the highest
crime rate in the Los Angeles Police Department's Wilshire Division,
and is among the most crime-ridden in the city, said Ron Riffel, an
LAPD crime analyst.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Lt. Thomas J. Ward said much of the crime "is jet-fueled by
alcohol." Ward said intoxicated bar patrons are often robbed when
leaving drinking spots, and that Koreatown clubs and bars exacerbate
the problem by selling hard liquor by the bottle.</TE>
<TE>   White-collar crime is also an issue, according to law enforcement
officials who have targeted Korean nightclubs in a tax-evasion and
money-laundering investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Among the array of liquor businesses that have opened in the
district are karaoke clubs with private rooms for drinking and
singing; hostess bars filled with women who accompany customers for
drinks and tips; and "booking clubs" like Le Prive, where waiters act
as paid matchmakers for young singles.</TE>
<TE>   "That's Nate Holden's legacy in Koreatown," said Charles Kim,
executive director of the Korean American Coalition, a community
education and civic affairs group. "His legacy is a lot of places
getting upgraded from beer and wine to full liquor licenses, and
extending their hours from midnight to 2 a.m."</TE>
<TE>   For years, Holden criticized liquor businesses in the inner city,
saying they contributed to the deterioration of neighborhoods,
especially in South-Central Los Angeles. Holden lobbied against an
Assembly bill in 1994 that would have made it easier to rebuild
grocery and liquor stores destroyed in the 1992 riots, arguing that
the stores--many of which were in his district--could be magnets for
crime.</TE>
<TE>   But he has remained silent as other liquor permits in his district
have come up for approval, and has sometimes vocally backed bar
owners before the City Council or city regulators. Holden said his
positions are based on what he hears from the public and police.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't do anything without community support and police support,
period," he said.</TE>

<TE>   A Boon to Consultants With Ties to Holden</TE>
<TE>   The spread of liquor businesses in Koreatown has been a boon for
consultants with close ties to Holden.</TE>
<TE>   A review of all liquor business zoning permit applications in
Holden's district since 1995 shows two consultants, King Woods and
Bill Robinson, have represented more than 40% of the approximately
five dozen applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, a longtime Holden campaign contributor, and Robinson, a
former Holden council staffer, have compiled a striking success rate
for those applicants. From 1995 to 2000, city officials approved 93%
of applications from their clients, compared with 75% for liquor
cases in Holden's district handled by other consultants.</TE>
<TE>   "I've voted against King lots of times," Holden said, though he
declined to cite an example.</TE>
<TE>   In the months leading up to the 1995 election, Woods, Robinson and
their clients donated more than $40,000 to Holden's council campaign
out of the $657,000 Holden raised, according to campaign finance
records,</TE>
<TE>   Woods, Robinson and their clients contributed $46,550 to Holden's
1999 campaign, according to public records.</TE>
<TE>   The consultants, their clients and others involved in Koreatown
projects represented by Woods and Robinson also contributed $23,750
to the unsuccessful 1999 Pasadena mayoral campaign of Holden's son,
Chris, a Pasadena city councilman.</TE>
<TE>   Woods said that there was no link between campaign contributions
and his success with Koreatown liquor permits. "Councilman Holden and
I are not really that close," Woods said.</TE>
<TE>   His clients' applications are usually approved, he said, because
he is meticulous in ensuring that they meet legal requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell them if they're going to do a project it has to be done
right," said Woods, a former city planning department staffer.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, Holden's former deputy, also said his success is due to
the quality of his applicants' projects. "I don't do bad projects. I
just do restaurants," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kee Whan Ha, a developer and president of the Korean Federation of
Los Angeles, said Koreatown businesspeople hire Woods "because most
of his jobs got finished. He has a good rate of success, probably
because he knows Holden and other council members."</TE>
<TE>   Holden insisted that projects handled by Woods or Robinson get no
special consideration from him. "I don't have any connection to
projects, whether they represent them or not," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The councilman said he does not refer clients to the consultants.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Changing Stance on Permit for Le Prive</TE>
<TE>   The importance of Holden's position on individual permits is
clearly illustrated in the Le Prive case, which took nearly three
years to wind through the city's process.</TE>
<TE>   Zoo Entertainment, Le Prive's parent company, applied for a permit
to open the club in September 1997.</TE>
<TE>   City officials and neighborhood residents were wary of another
late-night drinking spot in the area. Other nightclub owners fought
the project because they feared new competition.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Kim, owner of the now-defunct rival nightclub Flamingo,
immediately began to lobby against Le Prive's application. (In 2000,
Kim served one month of a one-year jail sentence in South Korea for
bribing Korean Defense Ministry officials. She did so to secure a
$216-million contract for an American defense contractor.)</TE>
<TE>   Kim, a longtime donor to Holden's campaigns, said she met with the
councilman, discussed Le Prive with him and was encouraged by what he
said. "I thought he was supporting us," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1997, she had given Holden an $11,900 Rolex watch.
Holden said the watch was not a gift, but rather part of an exchange
of valuables between him and Kim. In return for the watch, he said,
he gave her a diamond brooch. He refused to discuss the value of the
brooch.</TE>
<TE>   City ethics laws forbid council members from taking gifts worth
more than $100 from individuals who do business with the city, are a
party to a license or permit matter, or have lobbied on a legislative
or administrative action.</TE>
<TE>   Le Prive's operating permit was approved by a zoning administrator
in January 1998, but was immediately appealed by other nightclub
owners.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging their concerns, the city Board of Zoning Appeals in
March 1998 limited Le Prive's dance floor to 300 square feet. The
restriction was meant to ensure that the club would be a restaurant
with some room for dancing, not a full-blown nightclub.</TE>
<TE>   Holden took his first public stand on the case at that zoning
board meeting, according to city records. An aide to the councilman
testified that Holden wanted dancing to be carefully controlled,
because "the councilman did not want the restaurants of Koreatown to
turn into discos."</TE>
<TE>   Holden followed up with an April 1998 City Council motion to
prohibit dancing altogether in the proposed establishment. Le Prive's
owner agreed to dispense with dancing, and in June 1998 the council
approved a permit for the club.</TE>
<TE>   In February 1999, with the club still not open, Le Prive's backers
again applied for permission to allow dancing.</TE>
<TE>   That same month, Linda Kim said, Holden asked her to give money to
his son Chris' Pasadena mayoral campaign. "He called my house and
asked for $5,000 for his son," said Kim.</TE>
<TE>   Around that same time, Kim said, she asked Holden to oppose Le
Prive's latest permit application, and Holden said vaguely that he
would not allow another discotheque in Koreatown. "He gave us hope,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Records show that Kim donated $5,000 to Chris Holden's campaign in
February 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The nightclub owner, who lives in Saugus, 30 miles from Pasadena,
said Holden called her in March 1999 to ask for more money for his
son's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Records show a $4,900 loan to Chris Holden from Kim's sister, Kui
Ja Kim, in March 1999. Linda Kim said that is the second contribution
requested by Nate Holden, and is not a loan, despite what records
show.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Kim said that though Holden did not promise anything for the
money, she gave the contributions because she believed Holden would
oppose Le Prive.</TE>
<TE>   Kui Ja Kim, Linda Kim's sister, did not respond to messages left
at her workplace.</TE>
<TE>   Holden declined to discuss Kim's comments. "I don't want to get
into that or anything with Linda Kim." He said the campaigns were
"playing by the rules."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Holden said, "We just got the check and our understanding
was that it was a loan." He said the money has not been repaid.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign finance reports show that in 1998 and 1999 Nate Holden
also received $8,000 in campaign contributions from Le Prive's
owners, their family members, employees and consultants on the
project.</TE>
<TE>   Several parties tied to Le Prive also contributed to Chris
Holden's Pasadena campaign. Howard Kea, the club's owner, donated
$2,000. Christopher Pak, Le Prive's architect, and his firm gave
$7,000. (The donors said the contributions to both Holdens were not
linked to Le Prive's case before the Los Angeles City Council.)</TE>
<TE>   The younger Holden was defeated in the April 1999 mayoral
election, losing to Bill Bogaard.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Le Prive's owners, supporters and contractors contributed
$17,000 to the two Holdens' campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   After the Pasadena mayoral election, the elder Holden changed his
views on Le Prive. In May 1999, a zoning administrator approved the
club's second application for dancing, permitting a dance floor of
900 square feet--three times the limit earlier imposed by the city.</TE>
<TE>   Competing nightclubs appealed that decision to the Board of Zoning
Appeals. At a hearing in August of that year, a Holden aide testified
in support of Le Prive. The board denied the appeal and approved the
900-square-foot dance floor.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, while Le Prive's status was before city officials, Holden
deputy Steve Kim had received $5,000 from Johnny Koo, a nightclub
owner later convicted of money laundering in an unrelated case.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aide Takes $5,000 From Nightclub Owner</TE>
<TE>   Koo said he paid Kim to block Le Prive's zoning approval. The
council aide acknowledged taking the $5,000 in 1998, but said the
money was an interest-free loan. Kim said he could not remember why
he borrowed the money, but said it might have been for home
furniture. Kim said the loan was not related to Le Prive.</TE>
<TE>   As a council aide, Kim said, it was "very naive" of him to borrow
money from a businessman with interests in his district. He added:
"In the Korean culture it's not uncommon for people to borrow money
from each other."</TE>
<TE>   It was not their first financial deal: Both said that in 1997, the
aide received a $10,000 interest-free loan from the club owner. The
loan, they said, was intended to help Kim buy a house. Both agree
that it was repaid before the Le Prive controversy heated up.</TE>
<TE>   When Holden reversed himself in 1999 and decided to support Le
Prive, Koo said, he complained to a fellow nightclub owner, who spoke
to Holden and told the councilman about Koo's payment to Kim and his
anger at Holden's change of stance.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1999, Kim said, he met with Koo at a Koreatown sauna and
told Koo he wanted to repay the $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Koo refused. "I told him I don't need the money, I need you to
stop Le Prive," the club owner said.</TE>
<TE>   Holden said he chastised Kim for borrowing money from Koo, but
took no other action.</TE>
<TE>   In February 2000, Kim gave Koo a $5,000 cashier's check to settle
the loan.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives from the LAPD's financial crimes and fraud unit have
interviewed Kim about his relationship with Koo. Holden said, "I
called for the investigation. It's been resolved." Detectives refused
to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Le Prive's case reached the council for the last time in January
2000. Opponents had appealed the zoning board decision to approve
dancing at the club. Holden passionately sided with Le Prive.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who have come here," he said, "have to understand a person
has a right to start a business as long as he complies with the law."</TE>
<TE>   Le Prive's dance permit cleared the council by one vote.</TE>

<HD>City Would Emerge Fully Formed From Valley</HD>
<DH>Secession: A thriving business center and built-in
political class provide a head start.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a good night, a fast driver can make it from downtown Los Angeles
to the San Fernando Valley in 15 minutes, gliding across the slight
rise of the Cahuenga Pass, pink neon from Universal Studios on the
right and Ventura Boulevard--the Valley's "Main Street"--angling off
to the left.</LD>
<LD>   This is the entrance to what could become the unexpected city. If
voters approve Valley secession Nov. 5, they would create a major
American city fully formed from another municipality, starting life
with a built-in population of 1.35 million and an economy bigger than
that of some states.</LD>
<LD>   It would be the sixth-largest city in the nation, by updated
census rankings, edging past Phoenix and trailing New York, Chicago,
a newly downsized Los Angeles, Houston and Philadelphia.</LD>
<TE>   "The Brady Bunch" and Valley girls notwithstanding, the
identifying markers of a Valley city would be quite different from
the region's image as America's suburb.</TE>
<TE>   Its population would be 43% Latino, 41% white, 9% Asian/Pacific
Islander and 4% African American.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than a traditional downtown, it would have Ventura
Boulevard, whose shops, cafes and high-rises stretch the length of
the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Cooler in winter and hotter in summer than most of the rest of Los
Angeles, the arrowhead-shaped Valley city would cover 222 square
miles. It would hug two mountain ranges and include a long stretch of
the Los Angeles River, which courses through the 2,100-acre Sepulveda
Dam Recreation Area.</TE>
<TE>   The new city would have its own economic and business centers, a
polyglot population, a built-in political class and a strong
tradition of local philanthropy. It would lack major medical centers,
leading universities, museums and tourist destinations.</TE>
<TE>   Its richest person would be Michael Milken, the disgraced former
junk-bond king turned philanthropist, worth $800 million.</TE>
<TE>   Its largest private employer: defense contractor Boeing North
American Inc., with 5,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Its kingmakers include David Fleming and Bert Boeckmann, wealthy
backers of the secession movement. It would generate 600,000 jobs and
$50 billion in goods and services annually, according to the Los
Angeles Economic Development Corp. Biotechnology and medical
technology companies would have a strong presence and the Valley
would keep its thriving service sector.</TE>
<TE>   But its biggest business would be entertainment, which pays its
workers $4 billion each year and makes everything from children's
cartoons to pornographic videos.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Center, built on the site of the old Warner Bros. ranch in
Woodland Hills, is the Valley's version of Century City.</TE>
<TE>   Here, where the movie company filmed many of its westerns, several
of the region's large health insurers have offices in high-rises clad
in mirrored tiles that look blue and cool, even in the Valley sun.</TE>
<TE>   "This area? It's all city. It's all businesses here," said
bartender Medhat Mikhail, who commutes up to 21/2 hours to get from
his home in Paramount to his job at the Warner Center Marriott.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys Would Become Civic Center</TE>
<TE>   Across the belly of the Valley, running north from the Santa
Monica Mountains to the Santa Susanas, is Van Nuys Boulevard, home to
what was once its downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Smack in the middle, across the street from an adult bookstore and
a bail bondsman, sits a complex of courthouses and civic buildings
that would serve as the seat of government for a Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   North on Van Nuys, neighborhoods that once epitomized suburban
life are now among the most urbanized in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The community of Van Nuys, which includes the civic center, is
home to some of the Valley's poorest and most dangerous areas.
Graffiti dots the walls and dirty mattresses lie in front of some of
the houses on Blythe Street, where gangs have terrorized residents
for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Across Van Nuys Boulevard is a shopping center known as the Plant,
a bit of urban renewal built on the site of a General Motors plant
that drew workers to the Valley after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Apartment buildings have high fences around their parking lots and
signs saying that the buildings are not open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Life in the area "has been quiet so far," said Alvin Montano, who
operates a hot dog stand in the broad courtyard of the civic center
and lives in a nearby apartment.</TE>
<TE>   But there were 2,000 arrests in the Van Nuys Division for what the
Los Angeles Police Department calls serious crimes--including 19
homicides--in 1999, the last year for which the department has broken
down statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Crime edged up in the Valley last year, from 42 reported crimes
per 1,000 residents to 44, said Daniel R. Blake, professor of
economics and director of the San Fernando Valley Economic Research
Center at Cal State Northridge. Similar figures are not available for
the part of Los Angeles that would remain if a new Valley city is
formed, but FBI statistics show a slight rise in overall crime
throughout the city over the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   "I prefer to work here, but not live here," said Herman Tucker,
who moved his family out of Van Nuys six years ago. "It's too crowded
and crime-ridden around here in Van Nuys, and everywhere else [in the
Valley] is too expensive."</TE>
<TE>   Even though there are both rich and poor in the Valley, most
people fall somewhere in the middle. The Valley has 33,000 households
making less than $10,000 a year and 21,000 making more than $250,000.
The remaining 86% of the households fall in between.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Scott, a consultant and co-founder of the powerful Economic
Alliance of the San Fernando Valley, grew up in Panorama City, a
planned community of modest houses just north of the GM plant, where
thousands of families moved after the war.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first moved out to Panorama City, this was the community
of the future," Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was 1954; I would have been 8," he said. "And there was the
General Motors plant, which seemed like it was out in the country.
And they had this Panorama Market, and I don't think I'd ever seen a
supermarket before. It was filled with promise."</TE>
<TE>   It was years before Scott realized that Panorama City wasn't a
city at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how old I was before I realized I lived in the city
of Los Angeles," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long-Standing Feeling of Separateness</TE>
<TE>   The remoteness of the Valley in those days is key to understanding
its culture, politics, business structure, and most of all, the sense
of separateness that has fueled the secession movement.</TE>
<TE>   The region, then home to wheat fields, ranches and a few
settlements, joined Los Angeles in 1915, thirsty for water that the
big city had brought down from the Owens River in its 2-year-old Los
Angeles Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   But within the decade, Valley residents were complaining that the
marriage didn't suit them.</TE>
<TE>   "By the 1920s, the Valley was screaming about poor services and no
representation," said Steve Erie, a professor of political science at
UC San Diego. "It was true."</TE>
<TE>   When Ruth Richter, 79, moved to Winnetka in the West Valley in
1950, only one bus connected the Valley to downtown Los Angeles--and
that was miles away in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   If you did manage to get to Van Nuys to catch that bus, you had to
be finished with your business early--because the line shut down at 7
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Burglars looted several houses in Canoga Park one winter, knowing
that their occupants and the Valley's sole police officer were at a
parade.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Business Leaders Back Secession Movement</TE>
<TE>   Many of the business leaders, who form what some jokingly refer to
as the Valley's shadow government, support the pro-secession group
Valley VOTE. "The Valley VOTE movement is supported by two fairly
powerful interest groups--the homeowner associations and the chamber
of commerce folks," said Tom Hogan-Esch, who teaches political
science at Cal State Northridge and has studied the secession
movement.</TE>
<TE>   "These are going to be the organizational and interest-group
backbone of the new Valley city for some time to come. These are
going to be the powerful players in the new Valley city," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One of those is attorney David Fleming of Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   A philanthropist who gave $1 million to Valley Presbyterian
Hospital in Van Nuys, Fleming bankrolled secession activists and is a
founder of the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   He had Richard Riordan's ear while the former mayor was in office.
City Council members and county supervisors consult with Fleming when
dealing with an issue affecting the Valley or Valley business.</TE>
<TE>   Bert Boeckmann, a Fleming friend whose North Hills Ford
dealership, Galpin Motors, is the largest in the nation, is also a
heavy donor to local causes. With Fleming, he contributed funds to
start Valley VOTE, the organization that pressed to put secession on
the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Within the secession movement, they are joined by Richard Close,
president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. and chairman of Valley
VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   Close was also a key player in the movement behind Proposition 13,
which rolled back property taxes in California.</TE>
<TE>   It is less clear, however, who would hold elective office in a new
city.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   List of Possible Mayoral Candidates</TE>
<TE>   Among likely candidates for mayor are Richard Alarcon, a former
Los Angeles city councilman who is being forced out of his East
Valley Assembly seat by term limits, and Keith Richman, a Granada
Hills physician who is serving his first term in the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Former Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), who
carried the legislation that made a secession vote possible, insists
he is not interested in running.</TE>
<TE>   Former Assemblyman Richard Katz of Sylmar is also frequently
mentioned as a possible mayoral contender, but he is chairing the
pro-secession political campaign and says that he is not running.</TE>
<TE>   At play in Valley politics is a mix of demographics, past
alliances and voting trends.</TE>
<TE>   A Valley city would have more minorities than whites. Five of its
14 City Council districts have been drawn to maximize Latino voting
strength. But the overwhelming majority among registered voters, 68%,
is white. Latinos, even though they would be the largest ethnic
group, would account for just 19% of registered voters. Blacks and
Asians would each comprise about 5% of the voters.</TE>
<TE>   "At least for the next generation, you're going to have an
electorate that is dominated by the Anglo vote," said Hogan-Esch.
"It's anybody's guess after that."</TE>
<TE>   Huge as it might be, a Valley city would lack some significant
cultural institutions typically found in large municipalities.</TE>
<TE>   There is no music center, no philharmonic. There is no baseball
team.</TE>
<TE>   A list of the top 20 tourist attractions for visitors to the
Valley, compiled by the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley,
does not include a single site that's located there. Even Universal
Studios would be outside the new city's limits.</TE>
<TE>   But people find other reasons to visit the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   There's Antique Row in Canoga Park, where vintage shops reinvented
themselves after the 1994 Northridge earthquake; the Encino's Farmers
Market; the Valley Village mural; summer concerts in Warner Park; the
original mission in Mission Hills.</TE>
<TE>   And in North Hollywood, where a jumble of artsy shops and cafes
has sprouted in a redevelopment area aimed at attracting
entertainment businesses, Practical Props stocks several thousand
light fixtures for use in movies and television--and for sale to
anyone who wants a pair of perfect pink lamps from the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Last week Rosie Tupta, who lives in the Mid-Wilshire area, was in
the store, combing it for what Hollywood no longer offers her. "I
always shop in the Valley," Tupta said. "Hollywood doesn't have the
prop houses it used to have. I just hop over the hill and I'm here."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The FBI has issued a fresh warning that terrorists may be interested
in using small planes to carry out suicide attacks.</LD>
<LD>   FBI supervisory special agent Steven Berry said Saturday that the
agency had issued an "intelligence update" to law enforcement
regarding small planes, but he declined to be more specific.</LD>
<LD>   The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Assn. said on its Web site that the
alert was issued because the FBI "has received information indicating
that terrorists may still be interested in using small general
aviation aircraft for suicide attacks in the United States."</LD>
<TE>   "Pilots are strongly encouraged to remain alert for suspicious
activities any time they are flying, or at an airport just before or
after a flight," the association said.</TE>
<TE>   "Individuals observing anything suspicious should report it to the
local FBI or law enforcement officials," the organization said.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Cebula, the association's senior vice president for
government and technical affairs, said that "while the alert is not
specific, it is important that everyone in the general aviation
community serve as the eyes and ears for law enforcement, watching
suspicious activity and persons."</TE>
<TE>   Berry said the FBI notice was sent to law enforcement officials
late in the week.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of information that continues to come in from a
variety of different sources, and we inform law enforcement or update
them, in this case, of any additional information that might be
useful in their efforts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The government has issued a number of alerts about possible
threats in the last week, including warnings about possible terrorist
activity directed at rail lines, nuclear plants and New York
landmarks.</TE>

<HD>Trade Center Beams to Shore N.M. Bells</HD>
<DH>Memorial: Steel pulled from the Sept. 11 ruins will be used
to rebuild the tower at the Church of the Sacred Heart in
Albuquerque.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALBUQUERQUE</DL>
<LD>ALBUQUERQUE -- Hundreds of people gathered Saturday to bless two
steel beams from the collapsed World Trade Center that will be used
in rebuilding a church bell tower in the city's most historic
neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Archbishop Michael Sheehan sprinkled the 20-foot beams with holy
water and sacred oil while a 60- by 40-foot U.S. flag was hoisted.
The beams were donated by New York City.</LD>
<LD>   He said the new bell tower will stand as a memorial for victims of
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York.</LD>
<TE>   "Yes, evil is powerful. We know this from Sept. 11," Sheehan said.
"I believe good is even more powerful. From that destruction there
will rise up new life and new spirit here in Barelas."</TE>
<TE>   The 400-year-old Roman Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart and its
two bell towers, in the historic Barelas neighborhood, were razed in
the 1970s because of structural problems.</TE>
<TE>   The new bell tower will be built in a former gymnasium across the
street, where the sanctuary was moved after the church was razed.</TE>
<TE>   When the church was razed, officials lost track of its two bronze
bells. One of them was found recently and will be housed in the new
tower, which will include a list of the more than 2,800 people who
died in the trade center collapse.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Manny Aragon, who came up with the idea, said the beams
should be built into the bell tower to give "a feeling of the two
towers where they came from."</TE>
<TE>   Trucker Terry Stunkard, who hauled the beams across the country,
said the trip was the greatest thing he's ever done.</TE>
<TE>   "The hauling wasn't like hauling beams. You kept thinking about
the people" who died in the trade center, Stunkard said. "Everybody
I'd run into--kids--they wanted to climb on them. They wanted a speck
of dirt from them."</TE>
<TE>   Organizers have raised about half of the $100,000 needed for the
project, which is expected to be completed by June 2003.</TE>

<HD>Prelate's Exit Brings Sadness to Milwaukee</HD>
<DH>Church: Archbishop Weakland retired early after an
allegation of sexual misconduct.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>The skyline of this city is marked by two types of cloud-piercing
architecture: smokestacks and steeples. Most of the smokestacks
stopped working 20 years ago. The Gothic-style steeples, with their
heavy bronze bells, still ring out notice that this is an
old-fashioned town built by Catholic immigrants from Europe.</LD>
<LD>   The man most responsible for keeping the bells ringing and the
church here relatively healthy during a difficult 25 years for
religion in the United States is now the highest-ranking American
Roman Catholic to be accused of sexual misconduct in the ongoing
abuse scandal. And the complicated case of Archbishop Rembert G.
Weakland is already testing the will of the faithful here and
challenging the future course of Catholicism in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   As somber parishioners headed through a cold drizzle into churches
throughout the city Saturday, the man who will take Weakland's place,
at least temporarily, issued a plea for caution and patience as the
details of the former archbishop's case come out. And, in a message
posted on the archdiocese's Web site, Milwaukee Auxiliary Bishop
Richard J. Sklba noted how local Catholics had recently "celebrated
the remarkable accomplishments of the archbishop" as he neared his
planned retirement. "And we dare not forget them," Sklba wrote, "if
we are a people of genuine gratitude."</LD>
<TE>   Weakland, 75, retired Friday, when the Vatican agreed to
accelerate his resignation after his confirmation that the
archdiocese had paid $450,000 in 1997 to a man who claimed that
Weakland had assaulted him nearly two decades earlier, in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   As details trickled out about the alleged assault and Weakland's
apparent relationship with the man, Paul Marcoux, 54, the story grew
ever more complicated for Catholics here.</TE>
<TE>   First they learned of the secret settlement, $450,000. Then they
learned that Marcoux, at the time a 32-year-old student at Marquette
University, a Catholic school, claimed it was a case of date rape--a
claim Weakland denies and for which no evidence has emerged.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, Milwaukee residents learned of a letter Weakland had
written Marcoux in 1980. The letter seems likely to prove the most
difficult aspect of the case for parishioners and for the church, for
it is, in the end, a love letter, written by an archbishop to another
man.</TE>
<TE>   It speaks of "the pain of deep love," of love being "better than
valor" and of how Weakland was nervous even expressing such thoughts
in writing. His mother had warned him "that I should not put down on
paper what I would not want the whole world to read."</TE>
<TE>   It was all so much that no one found any need to analyze, or
over-analyze, the fact that Weakland began the letter with a quote
from George Eliot, the pen name of Mary Ann Evans, who wrote
considerably about religion in the 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   "Was it wrong? Yes, parts of it, at least," William Miller, 61,
said of Weakland's actions as he walked into a Saturday Mass. "But I
don't know. I just don't know...."</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee was settled by French fur traders but is known more for
the German immigrants who came later, bringing beer and bratwurst and
a decidedly staunch form of Catholicism.</TE>
<TE>   About 30% of the city is Catholic, and the archdiocese oversees
nearly 700,000 worshipers at 234 parishes in 10 counties. Masses are
carried live on a cable channel, and you can get your televised world
news in German.</TE>
<TE>   When he was appointed archbishop in 1977, Weakland began
introducing a more open Catholicism to Milwaukee and soon became one
of the American church's most influential liberals.</TE>
<TE>   He fought for gay rights, appointed women to roles of authority in
the archdiocese, gave his priests unprecedented autonomy, and during
the 1980s, led a group of American bishops in drafting a
still-influential letter that called on the U.S government to reform
its welfare system and narrow the gap between rich and poor.</TE>
<TE>   His influence was diminished and his critics emboldened to some
degree by the traditional policies of Pope John Paul II, but Weakland
retained considerable support among the faithful here, in large part,
people say, because he was such a genuine, fascinating leader.</TE>
<TE>   He has written or co-written more than a dozen books, speaks
several languages fluently and can muddle through in more than a
dozen, friends say. Even as he pursued his religious studies, and
then led hundreds of thousands of fellow Catholics, he studied music
in France, Italy, Germany and some of the best schools in the United
States, earning a doctoral degree from Columbia University in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy is something, you know," said Tom Schloemer, who usually
teaches at Creighton University in Omaha, Neb., but has been leading
one of the city's larger congregations this spring, Gesu Church, as
the parish searches for a new priest. "He has made a tremendous
contribution. He is one of the architects of the church in America.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all devastated. The predominant feeling is just sadness."</TE>
<TE>   That was the word on everyone's lips Saturday, it seemed. At
parishes across the city, priests called it a "sad day," parishioners
called the situation "sad," and a woman from Chicago said, "I'm not
even from here, I don't even know him, but the whole thing seems very
sad."</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee County Dist. Atty. E. Michael McCann, who knows Weakland
and was one of just a handful of people made aware of the
confidential settlement with Marcoux before he went public this week,
has said he's seen no evidence of sexual misconduct but plans to
investigate where the money came from and appoint a special
prosecutor if it appears laws were broken.</TE>
<TE>   Weakland, through a spokesman, has said he will offer a public
apology in the near future for the damage his failings have caused
the archdiocese and the church.</TE>
<TE>   All across the city Saturday evening, priests were preparing to
deal with the topic at today's Masses.</TE>
<TE>   The rain let up as the sun sank Saturday, but the clouds stayed
low above the tops of the steeples.</TE>
<TE>   "What a mess," said Mike Johnson outside Old St. Mary Church. "How
sad."</TE>

rededication speeches attended by representatives of Belgium, France,
Italy, Britain and by the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Air Force Gen. Richard B. Myers.</LD>
<LD>   Then, as now, "they are with us there, side by side," Myers said
to a cheering crowd of about 8,000.</LD>
<LD>   As the war receded into the history books, so did interest and
care for the 217-foot Liberty Memorial. By 1994, the massive tower
was so damaged from neglect it had to be closed. Then, two years ago,
Kansas City began a renovation.</LD>

knowledge of Sept. 11 lead reformers to consider major changes.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The controversy over who knew what in the days and weeks before Sept.
11 has vaulted the rivalry between the FBI and CIA--one of the oldest
back-fence feuds in the nation's capital--outside the bounds of
conventional controversy.</LD>
<LD>   The question of why the deadliest terror plot in U.S. history went
unstopped has exacerbated problems at the nation's already-troubled
intelligence agencies. And disclosures made in the last two weeks
indicate that, despite reform efforts at both the FBI and CIA, the
interagency sparring is only getting worse.</LD>
<LD>   ''What we've seen in the past two weeks is changing everything,''
a Bush administration official familiar with CIA and FBI operations
said Saturday. ''There will be more changes. It has made it apparent
that we need to go deeper.''</LD>
<TE>   From scandals of years past--Watergate, for example--have come
major reforms. Already, pressure has grown for a broader inquiry into
the intelligence agencies' operations and deeper reforms than most
Washington officials wanted or thought likely just a few weeks ago.
There is, for example, growing support for an independent commission
to investigate the agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Both the CIA and the FBI are well into their post-9/11
reorganization plans, which are designed to make them work better
together. FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III has brought on board
several CIA officials to work at FBI headquarters, and FBI agents
have a stronger presence at the CIA's sprawling Virginia complex.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most telling, top FBI and CIA officials--often Mueller and
CIA Director George J. Tenet--gather each morning to go over the
terrorism ''threat matrix'' so they can brief President Bush
together.</TE>
<TE>   But the recent disclosures suggest that the bickering,
foot-dragging and bureaucratic gamesmanship continue.</TE>
<TE>   The latest flare-up started with a leak that the CIA warned Bush
of possible terrorist hijackings more than a month before Sept. 11.
It continued with revelations that a Phoenix FBI agent warned of
possible terrorist infiltration of flight schools. And it was capped
by the detailed accusations of high-level Washington failures by an
FBI lawyer in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   ''Obviously it is still going on,'' another Bush administration
official said of the CIA-FBI rivalry. ''And we all hope that our
leaders ... can find a way to get their agencies to stop worrying
about protecting themselves and worry more about protecting all of
us, even if it means taking a couple of hard knocks
institutionally.''</TE>
<TE>   In the twilight struggle of the Cold War, when lives seemed secure
at home, U.S. intelligence officials could battle foreign enemies
without missing a step in their fights against political and
bureaucratic rivals.</TE>
<TE>   If CIA superiors seemed blind to a mole like Aldrich H. Ames, or
if a Robert Philip Hanssen could betray his country from the comfort
of an FBI executive office, the country at large took such setbacks
in stride.</TE>
<TE>   That may no longer be true.</TE>
<TE>   Today, when warnings of horrific new dangers pour out almost daily
and a natural gas explosion at an Encino apartment building sends
shivers down the whole country's spine, public tolerance for the old
infighting may be evaporating.</TE>
<TE>   The question now is whether Mueller's proposed changes at the FBI
go far enough--whether the government should simply shake up the
entrenched bureaucracy or reinvent the bureau in a far more dramatic
way than Mueller plans.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways, this is out of his hands now," the Bush
administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   But in the meantime, the debate is a hardball contest of leaks and
spin, fought by the agencies themselves but also by partisans on the
Hill, in news media and in the policy establishment. It is a potent
formula that is already nicking careers.</TE>
<TE>   Last week it was that of Mueller himself, who had only been on the
job a week when Sept. 11 arrived. The broadside by Minneapolis-based
agent Coleen Rowley--in a letter leaked by members of
Congress--criticized Mueller personally, saying he made misleading
public statements about how the FBI handled the terrorism
investigation before and after Sept. 11, downplaying and even leaving
out details that would make the bureau look bad.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), a fierce FBI critic, lambasted
Mueller for withholding Rowley's letter, vowing, "A cover-up is not
going to work."</TE>
<TE>   Another Republican, maverick Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, ranking
minority member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has repeatedly
demanded the head of Tenet, a holdover from Bill Clinton's
presidency. He has also discomfited a Republican White House and many
of his Senate colleagues by spreading the alleged shortcomings in the
CIA and FBI across the public record.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials shoot back that Congress itself tied the
hands of the CIA and the FBI in the 1970s by restricting the
gathering of intelligence--barriers that were lifted after Sept. 11
with the passage of the Patriot Act, which also encourages the
sharing of information among the FBI, CIA and National Security
Council.</TE>
<TE>   CIA and FBI officials have been maneuvering frantically to shift
blame for missing signs of impending domestic terrorism. Both have
resorted to orchestrated news leaks and spin-doctoring.</TE>
<TE>   In the most fundamental split, the FBI says the Sept. 11 plot was
hatched overseas--in the CIA's domain--while the agency notes that
the 19 hijackers roamed extensively through the FBI's U.S. territory.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, no one outside a small circle of government
officials knew that on Aug. 6, more than a month before the attacks,
the CIA's daily briefing for the president included a warning that Al
Qaeda might contemplate hijacking U.S. aircraft. Public disclosure of
the briefing created significant political problems for the White
House but also cast the agency in the flattering light of having
issued an unheeded warning.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, daily intelligence briefings for the president are among
the CIA's most closely guarded secrets. How did congressional
investigators learn about the Aug. 6 briefing?</TE>
<TE>   The answer, congressional sources said, is that they were tipped
off by officials in the CIA's office of congressional affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional aides described it as an atypically cooperative
gesture from a CIA office that had previously been accused by
lawmakers of hindering the probe.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like, 'Gee, you might want to look at Aug. 6,'" said one
aide. "'We hear that was pretty interesting."'</TE>
<TE>   The information was leaked to the media two days later and was
first mentioned on the CBS Evening News on May 15.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA has also aimed elbows at the FBI. The agency particularly
seemed to enjoy fallout from the recent disclosure of the so-called
Phoenix memo of July 10, in which an FBI agent in Arizona urged
bureau headquarters to investigate Middle Eastern men possibly
training for terrorist missions at U.S. flight schools.</TE>
<TE>   The leak of that memo--and the FBI's failure to act on it--began a
firestorm of criticism.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA seemed to pile on. The agency first declared that it
hadn't received the memo until recently; a CIA official then
described it as a "remarkable document" that almost certainly would
have set off a significant inquiry if the FBI had shared it before it
was too late.</TE>
<TE>   Within a day, the FBI anonymously declared that it had shared at
least portions of the memo with the CIA. So if the bureau was in the
soup, the CIA was with it.</TE>
<TE>   The feud between the CIA and the FBI goes back more than half a
century and reflects divergent cultures that all agree must change.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1940s, when the Central Intelligence Agency was created to
coordinate America's response to the emerging threat of global
communism, the new agency was barred from operating inside the United
States. But it received sole responsibility for intelligence and
counter-intelligence overseas.</TE>
<TE>   That meant the FBI had to withdraw dozens of agents from posts
abroad, which infuriated J. Edgar Hoover, who had made his "G-men"
legendary, zealously guarding their turf and his own.</TE>
<TE>   And from the beginning, the cultures of the two institutions could
not have been more different. The CIA was a self-consciously
cosmopolitan and intellectual elite, patterned after the Oxbridge
traditions of the British Secret Service and molded in the
blue-blooded Ivy League image of its first director, Allen Dulles.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI saw itself as equally elite but was made of commoner clay.
If the CIA was disdainfully aristocratic, the FBI was defiantly
middle class, with its lawyers and accountants in their stodgy but
mandatory black shoes, white shirts and felt hats.</TE>
<TE>   Even without those cultural differences, the FBI and the CIA face
each other across a chasm:</TE>
<TE>   One is devoted to espionage, operating overseas and outside the
restrictions of U.S. law. Its goal is gathering information and
subverting the enemy by any means.</TE>
<TE>   It subscribes to Winston Churchill's dictum that, "In wartime,
truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a
bodyguard of lies." And for the CIA, all time is wartime.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI, by contrast, is a law enforcement organization, dedicated
to prosecuting criminals, not just gathering information.</TE>
<TE>   And it is answerable to the strict standards of the American legal
system.</TE>
<TE>   When it has fallen short of those standards, as critics say it did
during the civil rights movement of the 1960s, its pursuit of
radicals during the 1970s and more recently with the Branch Davidians
and at Ruby Ridge, it has been harshly criticized, while the CIA has
largely escaped such scrutiny for its dirty tricks abroad.</TE>
<TE>   But the cultures share at least one important characteristic: Both
tend to feel that no outsider can judge them and both put loyalty to
the organization above all else.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the letter from the FBI's Rowley broke like a
thunderclap late last week. It was that rarest of things: criticism
from inside.</TE>
<TE>   And, sure enough, it became public through a leak.</TE>

<HD>Western Drought Is Leaving Vacationers High and Dry</HD>
<DH>Recreation: From Arizona to Wyoming, low water levels and
forest fires are disrupting plans for Memorial Day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN and JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>LAKE MEAD, Nev.</DL>
<LD>Jason and Cori Babcock towed their new boat here Saturday from
Southern California, expecting to ski carefree on one of the nation's
largest recreational lakes. Instead, they discovered what hundreds of
thousands of other vacationers are encountering throughout much of
the West this holiday weekend.</LD>
<LD>   A stubborn decade-long drought is taking its toll on the great
outdoors, upsetting boaters, campers and anglers who had grand plans
to kick off the summer season.</LD>
<LD>   No sooner had the Babcocks arrived from Granada Hills when they
were warned by a park ranger that the water level is so low that
rocky pinnacles are jutting perilously above the water's surface,
even in the middle of the lake. Cori Babcock was unsettled by the
prospect of such a water-skiing hazard.</LD>
<TE>   "That's causing me some real concerns," she said, her boat bobbing
on the water's surface that is nearly 50 feet lower than normal.
"Seeing the water this low was very surprising."</TE>
<TE>   From Arizona to Wyoming, all along the West's intermountain
region, lake levels have dropped so significantly that many boat
launching ramps lead only to blistered, sun-dried mud. Some diehard
fishermen in Arizona are heaving their trolling boats over previously
submerged boulders to get on the water. Once-vigorous fishing streams
in Colorado are puny trickles.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend vacationers also were being denied campgrounds in three
states because of drought-enhanced fires: in Arizona, Colorado and
New Mexico, where the northern part of the state was all but
off-limits to campers.</TE>
<TE>   "Northern New Mexico is closed tight as a drum," said Richard
Atkinson, manager of the state's public lands information center.
Four of the state's five national forests and three state parks were
closed because of fire danger. Among several fires burning there, one
40 miles north of Santa Fe had grown to 10,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting hundreds of calls, people saying, 'Where can we
go?' They made reservations months ago, and we're trying to send them
elsewhere," Atkinson said. "Ninety-nine percent of the people are
understanding. They don't want to risk life or limb, let alone set a
fire. And right now in New Mexico, that can happen with a warm
thought."</TE>
<TE>   Many New Mexico-bound tourists are re-routing to campgrounds in
southern Colorado, only to run smack into the nation's highest
priority wildfire raging in the Pike and San Isabel national forests.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time they get to us, they think there are fires
everywhere," said Lance Tyler, a forest recreation specialist. "It
used to be that people thought 'The West is on fire.' Now they think,
'The West is closed.'"</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the vast majority of parks and forests remain open, but
campfires are widely restricted, leaving children with the prospect
of making s'mores over a propane camp stove.</TE>
<TE>   In Rocky Mountain National Park in Estes Park, Colo., even with 6
inches of new snow at week's end, fires were allowed only in
established campgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   The news of isolated forest fires was enough to keep some campers
away from many national parks altogether this weekend, rangers
reported.</TE>
<TE>   "Out-of-state travelers sense that if there is a fire in Colorado,
the whole state must be on fire, and that influences their plans,"
said Larry Frederick, a ranger at Rocky Mountain National Park.</TE>
<TE>   The Pike and San Isabel forests were at a heightened level of fire
alert, scaring away some of the expected 10,000 tourists who cram the
101 campgrounds. Under those rules, no open fires are permitted.</TE>
<TE>   Without the promise of a campfire, it seems, many American
families don't want to camp at all.</TE>
<TE>   "It's that primeval man-against-nature thing," said Tyler. "The
fire is a comfort. It keeps the wild animals at bay. Campfires are so
attached to the tradition of camping that the two are hard to
separate. There's not a lot of romance sitting around a lantern
telling stories."</TE>
<TE>   The only travelers who are not discouraged by fire restrictions
are those in self-contained recreation vehicles, Tyler said. "They're
inside watching TV, not outside watching a fire."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's $600-million fishing economy is suffering under
miserable conditions as river and stream levels plummet dangerously
low. Wildlife experts fear fish will begin dying because of high
water temperatures and loss of oxygen, and worry that the state's
fish habitat could be irreparably damaged by the end of summer.</TE>
<TE>   The sad joke making the rounds in Colorado is that fly fishermen
are leaving their elaborate gear at home and using nets to scoop up
fish floundering in shallow water.</TE>
<TE>   Similar reports are coming out of Arizona, where state wildlife
officials have stopped stocking fish in lakes and reservoirs because
water levels are so low.</TE>
<TE>   In Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park, Jackson Lake has dropped
15 feet, forcing the closure of one of the lake's three marinas.</TE>
<TE>   The drop at Lake Mead, about 35 miles southeast of Las Vegas, is
giving rangers a rare opportunity to repair and lengthen boat
launching ramps that normally are submerged. Over the last year
alone, the lake has dropped 30 feet and is now dropping a foot a
week.</TE>
<TE>   Boaters on Saturday could make use of about half of the lake's
ramps, said Kay Rohde, a spokeswoman for the Lake Mead National
Recreation Area.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the lowest water level we've had since 1977, but back
then it really wasn't a problem because we were only getting 1 or 2
million visitors a year," she said. Last year, 8.9 million visitors
came to Lake Mead.</TE>
<TE>   About 250,000 people were expected here Saturday, a postcard
summer day with a deep blue sky and temperatures in the 90s. Families
piled into ski boats, sailboats, speedboats and slow boats--large,
flat-bottomed pontoon craft reverently called "party barges."</TE>
<TE>   But local boaters who have watched the lake drop over recent years
worried that newcomers would be oblivious to the lake's new perils.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what to look out for, but I'm not so sure about the folks
from California," said Robert Slater of Las Vegas, loading 17 people
onto his 30-foot pontoon boat for a day of scuba diving for
lake-bottom treasures.</TE>
<TE>   "You see these fast boats take out of here, and you know they're
not paying attention to what's out there--sand bars and rocks," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Lanie Giordano, piloting a blazing white, 38-foot speedboat,
"You can't be goofing around out there because every week there are
new little islands popping up."</TE>

<HD>Chandra Levy's Clothing May Provide Clue to How She Died</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Police have found a knotted piece of clothing with Chandra Levy's
remains that could have been used to restrain her.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators are trying to determine if Levy's stretch leggings
were used to tie her up, a person close to the investigation said
Saturday. "If they conclude she was bound, that would eliminate any
possibility other than that she was killed," the person said.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Police Chief Terrance W. Gainer would not confirm or deny
the report. "That shouldn't be shared publicly for two reasons: Her
parents shouldn't have to read it, and some things interrogators want
to keep to themselves."</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Jonathan Arden, Washington's medical examiner, has said
official word on how Levy died could come by Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Police are talking to nearby residents and joggers to see if they
recall anything unusual on May 1, 2001, when police believe the
24-year-old former federal intern from Modesto disappeared.</TE>

<HD>Warnings Don't Deter Crowds From Flocking to Landmarks</HD>
<DH>Holiday: In Washington and New York, tickets to view
monuments are quickly snapped up. 'We figured this is the safest
place to be,' says a woman at Fleet Week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN and PAUL LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Despite a week of warnings that the nation's monuments
and tourist destinations could be targeted by terrorists, huge crowds
flocked to such locations Saturday, with many saying the Memorial Day
visits had taken on new meaning amid America's latest war.</LD>
<LD>   In Washington, tickets to tour the Capitol were gone by 9 a.m. The
Washington Monument was sold out an hour later.</LD>
<LD>   In New York, crowds lined up for blocks under a hot sun to visit
warships docked along the Hudson River for the city's Fleet Week.
Some of the ships are recently returned from service in the Middle
East. "We figured this is the safest place to be," said Dale Clancy,
a Long Island woman who was viewing a display of gas masks and
radiation suits on the amphibious assault ship Iwo Jima after passing
through metal detectors watched over by Marines armed with M-16
assault rifles.</LD>
<TE>   The events of the last eight months, and the recent terrorism
alerts, also did not undermine the most basic Memorial Day weekend
tradition: leaving town. The American Automobile Assn. estimated that
35.2 million people would be traveling over the three-day holiday
weekend, slightly more than a year ago. One change was noted,
however: More people were wary of flying. The number of air
passengers was expected to drop to 4.1 million, from 4.4 million last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Here in the Washington area alone, nearly half a million residents
headed out of town, shedding a winter of capital city cabin fever for
the Atlantic Coast beaches, many for the first time since Sept. 11,
according to the auto club.</TE>
<TE>   And in the usual ebb and flow of holiday weekends, hundreds of
thousands of others headed into town: to tour, to learn, to mourn.
They began coming at sunrise to the grassy national Mall and soon
filled the museums and monuments that frame it.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't pay much attention to it all," Douglas Kabell, a
Lutheran minister from Accident, Md., said of the string of warnings
and advisories issued last week in New York and Washington. "My son
just wants to go up the monument," he added while standing in a long
line at the Washington Monument ticket booth. "We tried to tour
Congress, but those tickets were gone. They started lining up at 5:45
a.m. over there.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure Sept. 11 still affects a lot of people, but my attitude
is, 'Don't think about it.'"</TE>
<TE>   Others couldn't help thinking of it, including a group a few feet
behind the Kabells. Teacher Faye Brown and a crowd of 153
eighth-graders were all wearing matching T-shirts for Blacksburg
Middle School's annual trip to the capital. Fewer students from the
southern Virginia school made the Memorial Day weekend outing than in
any year before.</TE>
<TE>   The trip was shortened from two nights to one because of security
concerns--a decrease that mirrors the 50% drop in school field trips
to Washington since the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon, according to tour operators.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the Blacksburg students said they were making a statement,
as well. "If you think like that, you're letting the terrorists win,"
said Jennifer Tanko, 14. "They want us to be scared, but we've got to
be strong now."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan Ellis, 14, used the same argument to convince her wary
mother to let her come. "We can't just stop leading our lives," Ellis
said. "That's not living."</TE>
<TE>   On the far side of the obelisk, past roads growling with thousands
of bikers on Harley-Davidsons arriving for today's annual Rolling
Thunder veterans motorcycle parade, Peter Wiesner used a similar
philosophy to explain his weekend road trip.</TE>
<TE>   "If God wants me, he's going to take me. Nothing I can do about
it," said Wiesner, 56, who drove eight hours from Ontario, Canada, to
visit the Vietnam War veterans memorial. He was one of 40,000
Canadian Vietnam vets, he said, and wore his old fatigues to prove
it.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe that's what it is for me, what explains why the threats
don't worry me," he said. "I've seen horror."</TE>
<TE>   In New York, authorities canceled a birthday celebration for the
Brooklyn Bridge after intelligence reports of potential attacks on
the city and its landmarks. But 20 fighting ships, with more than
6,000 uniformed Navy personnel and Marines on board, arrived as
scheduled for the city's 15th Fleet Week since 1984, docking at
Staten Island and Manhattan's Pier 88, an easy walk from the Times
Square theater district, which was teeming with visitors Friday
night.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, sharpshooters stood watch from the ends of the
massive ships as pleasure boats sped up and down the Hudson River on
the weekend that marks the start of the boating season.</TE>
<TE>   "The threats may be real and all that, but there's no way we were
staying away," said Philip Foote, a former merchant marine whose
20-year-old son, Christopher, is stationed on the Iwo Jima, a
multi-purpose assault ship that can carry 3,200 personnel. Foote's
father--Christopher's grandfather--also was a Navy man, fighting in
the battle of Iwo Jima during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't stay away from danger," said Christopher's older brother
Justin, 21, a Maryland firefighter.</TE>
<TE>   They made it on the ship in time for an afternoon ceremony on the
flight deck honoring one of the New York firefighters killed Sept.
11. The Iwo Jima also carried the tattered U.S. flag from the
courtyard of the World Trade Center, which was flown not long ago
above Kandahar Airport in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Foote said he viewed Saturday's visit as a "last chance" to
see his younger son before the Iwo Jima is sent to duty overseas.
"They can't confirm anything, but they're probably going where the
action is," Foote said.</TE>
<TE>   For others carrying disposable cameras and tourist maps, the day
provided a chance to view close up, or even handle, military gear
they had seen only on TV, from portable mortars and antitank weapons
to the tables of protective gear that drew the attention of Clancy,
the Long Island woman, who was touring the ship with her
sister-in-law Gina.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got these for biological attack, or anthrax, even for a
radiation incident," said a young Navy officer demonstrating a mask
designed to last 30 days in a "contaminated environment."</TE>
<TE>   "Let's get one at Home Depot," Clancy whispered to her
sister-in-law.</TE>

<HD>Someone Had to Say It, So Coleen Rowley Did</HD>
<DH>FBI: The agent who called the bureau on its handling of
terrorism probe has a reputation for determination and unsurprising
candor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON and MARK FINEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>APPLE VALLEY, Minn.</DL>
<LD>For years, she was the voice of the FBI on cases ranging from the
sensational to the sublime across the northern tier of the American
heartland.</LD>
<LD>   From the hunt for Gianni Versace's murderer to an Animal
Liberation Front attack to protect lab rats, Coleen Rowley always
played it straight, according to neighbors, colleagues and the public
record.</LD>
<LD>   Part lawyer, part ethicist, part cop, part triathlete, Rowley
cultivated an image of earnest determination, of headstrong candor
and yet, always, of loyalty to her agency.</LD>
<TE>   Now, the 47-year-old mother of four and career FBI agent suddenly
has emerged as a singular, critical voice from within: a
whistle-blower who set off what one former Minnesota prosecutor
called "a steam whistle" last week in challenging FBI headquarters'
decisions in the Sept. 11 terrorism investigation.</TE>
<TE>   And Rowley is getting high marks for it, from within Minnesota's
federal law enforcement circles and in this flag-strewn suburb where
she and her husband organized the Neighborhood Watch program and
often jog together.</TE>
<TE>   "She is saying what a lot of people have been thinking and talking
about [privately] for months," said David Lillehaug, a former U.S.
attorney in Minneapolis who was appointed by President Clinton in
1994.</TE>
<TE>   Describing Rowley as "a perfectionist," retired FBI agent Larry
Brubaker added: "She would stand up for what she thought and tell the
bosses, 'This is the way I see it.'"</TE>
<TE>   Rowley did just that, delivering a scathing, 13-page letter to FBI
Director Robert S. Mueller III and key lawmakers that criticized the
agency's investigation of the only suspect directly charged in the
Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In the
days since that letter became public, Brubaker said, the personal
e-mails he has received are piling up in her favor.</TE>
<TE>   One said, "Hats off to Coleen for taking the bull by the horns."</TE>
<TE>   Across the street from the Rowleys' modest, two-story home, where
her husband, Ross, declined all comment Saturday by either himself or
his wife, neighbor Audrey Pacholski summed up her feelings about the
situation.</TE>
<TE>   "She had in her mind what was right, and she did it," Pacholski
said.</TE>
<TE>   "She got scolded for it. But that's her. You don't tell her what
to do."</TE>
<TE>   A closer look at Rowley's career, which for the last 12 years has
been spent in the Minnesota field office, makes her outspoken
critique all the more dramatic--though perhaps unsurprising.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, what Rowley questioned was the response by FBI
headquarters in Washington to the arrest of Moroccan-born Zacarias
Moussaoui at a suburban Minneapolis motel Aug. 16, three full weeks
before the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui triggered the suspicions of a flight instructor in
suburban Minneapolis after paying $8,000 in cash to take a
flight-simulator course for a Boeing 747, despite having failed to
solo even a single-engine Cessna after more than 50 hours of
instruction.</TE>
<TE>   The flight instructor called the FBI, which confronted a
belligerent and uncooperative Moussaoui. Local FBI agents turned him
over to immigration authorities for a visa violation and impounded
his possessions, which included a laptop computer, and focused all
their efforts on getting a warrant to search that computer.</TE>
<TE>   In short, Rowley asserts in excerpts of her letter that have been
leaked in recent days, that officials in FBI headquarters ignored key
evidence and intelligence that could have justified a special
national security warrant to search the laptop, which contained files
on crop-dusting and commercial flight simulations.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials acknowledge that FBI lawyers in Washington
reviewed the Minnesota field office's search warrant request for
Moussaoui's computer and determined there was insufficient probable
cause to even request it. At that point, no crime had been committed,
they said.</TE>
<TE>   Screening and handling agents' search warrant requests is a major
part of Rowley's job as the Minnesota field office's general counsel.
Until recently, she also served as media spokeswoman for the office.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did Rowley, a 1980 University of Iowa law school
graduate, know and follow the law, but her job also has been to
interpret the law.</TE>
<TE>   "She's very highly ethical," former agent Brubaker said. "She's
our ethics person. She gave classes in ethics to our agents every
year."</TE>
<TE>   Accounts of Rowley's spartan work ethic abound. She brought her
lunch from home and ate at her desk. When she was deputized to train
the police force at an Indian reservation near Bemidji, she got up at
4 a.m., drove 200 miles to the reservation, taught all day and drove
home at night.</TE>
<TE>   "'Earnest' is the adjective that comes to my mind," said
ex-prosecutor Lillehaug. "Straightforward. From what I could see, she
was completely nonpolitical."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Mark Dayton (D-Minn.), for example, said Saturday that he had
never heard of Rowley until her story broke last week.</TE>
<TE>   That's likely to change in the weeks ahead; some lawmakers now see
her as a potential star witness at congressional hearings concerning
lapses in the terrorism investigations.</TE>
<TE>   That track record of relative anonymity was one Rowley laid down
through the many years she served as the FBI's Minneapolis
spokeswoman. With few exceptions, she offered reporters only the
facts, and most often only the barest of them.</TE>
<TE>   When a white man was beaten and left for dead with a rope around
his neck on a Minnesota Indian reservation in 1999, Rowley confirmed
that the FBI was investigating but declined to weigh in on local
speculation that it was a hate crime.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley's humor emerged subtly when she parsed the law to explain
why the FBI went after the Animal Liberation Front for its lab-rat
attack but couldn't prosecute the Earth Liberation Front for a fatal
assault on genetically altered oat plants. She noted that there is a
federal Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, but "there is no Vegetable
Enterprise Terrorism Act."</TE>
<TE>   On the 1997 frenetic, nationwide search for Versace's killer,
Andrew Cunanan, who was on the FBI's most-wanted list for 42 days,
Rowley was measured, always resisting the flashy quote or headline
comment. Rowley inherited the spokeswoman role in that case because
one of Cunanan's victims was from Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   It was at the peak of that manhunt when Rowley perhaps
foreshadowed the critique that would unleash a storm of controversy
five years later.</TE>
<TE>   She acknowledged to reporters before Cunanan committed suicide in
Miami Beach in 1997 that authorities had the serial killer within
their reach several times, but never did capture him.</TE>
<TE>   "In retrospect," she said of the FBI's investigation of Cunanan
that year, "there are some missed opportunities." She added: "There
are always ... opportunities in investigations."</TE>

<HD>Vouchers to HMOs on High Court List</HD>
<DH>Law: The Supreme Court will soon settle several key rights
issues as the term comes to a close. Included are two cases that
could change death penalty rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Heading into the final month of its term, the Supreme Court has yet
to decide 31 cases, more than a third of the year's total. And, as
usual, they include many of the most significant disputes before the
justices.</LD>
<LD>   Typically, the high court hands down its final opinions during the
last week in June and then adjourns for the summer. Here are some of
the major cases that are pending:</LD>
<LD>   Vouchers--Can the state give parents vouchers that can be used to
send their children to parochial schools, or does this subsidy
violate the Constitution's ban on taxpayer aid for religion? A ruling
upholding Ohio's voucher plan would give a big boost to the "school
choice" movement nationwide. (The case is Zelman vs. Simmons-Harris,
00-1751.)</LD>
<TE>   Death penalty--Can a state impose the death penalty on a murderer
who is mentally retarded, or is that cruel and unusual punishment?
(Atkins vs. Virginia, 00-8452)</TE>
<TE>   Drug testing--Can high schools force students participating in
extracurricular activities to undergo random drug tests, or does this
amount to an unreasonable search and a violation of an individual's
privacy? A ruling in favor of an Oklahoma school district's
drug-testing policy is likely to encourage other schools to do the
same. (Board of Education vs. Earls, 01-332)</TE>
<TE>   HMOs--Can states give HMO patients a right to an independent
medical review of their claims for treatment? California and most
other states have adopted such laws recently, but the health
insurance industry that these measures violate the federal law that
regulates employee benefits. (Rush Prudential HMO vs. Moran, 00-1021)</TE>
<TE>   Judicial elections--Do elected judges and their challengers have a
free-speech right to take stands on controversial issues, or can
states forbid judicial candidates to speak out on issues that might
come before the courts? (Republican Party of Minnesota vs. Kelly,
01-521)</TE>
<TE>   Sidewalk solicitors--Can cities require door-to-door solicitors to
register and obtain a permit, or does this violate free-speech
rights? The Jehovah's Witnesses are fighting an Ohio village, but the
ruling could set new national rules for solicitors. (Watchtower vs.
Village of Stratton, 00-1737)</TE>
<TE>   Census sampling--Despite a Supreme Court ruling prohibiting most
sampling, the Census Bureau says it "imputes" a number for the
residents of households that do not respond to requests. This
practice resulted in an increase of 1.2 million in the census count,
or just 0.4%. But the extra numbers shifted the last seat in the U.S.
House from Utah to North Carolina, and Utah's lawyers are urging the
court to outlaw the use of these "imputed" numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Disabled workers--Employers may not refuse to hire a qualified but
disabled worker, except where doing so would pose "a direct threat to
the health or safety of other individuals." Chevron turned away Mario
Echazabal for a job at its oil refinery in El Segundo when company
officials learned he had liver problems. They said workplace
chemicals and solvents would pose a "direct threat" to his health,
but he sued, alleging the choice was his, not an employer's. (Chevron
vs. Echazabal, 00-1406)</TE>
<TE>   Bus search--Can police or federal agents walk down the aisles of
buses and other public vehicles and ask to search passengers' bags
for drugs, or would this amount to an "unreasonable search," banned
by the 4th Amendment? Bush administration lawyers said these searches
are needed to fight the war on drugs and the war on terrorism. (U.S.
vs. Drayton, 01-631)</TE>
<TE>   Death sentences--In Arizona and eight other states, judges rather
than juries decide which convicted killers receive a death sentence.
But that system is being challenged under a recent high court ruling
that said jurors must decide the key facts in a criminal case. If the
justices take the same view in the case of Ring vs. Arizona, they
could upset as many as 800 death sentences.</TE>

<HD>This Father Still Figures</HD>
<DH>Agassi, 32, shows he can play--with new son, and with
anyone in tennis</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>The House of Agassi had another trophy to treasure this month, this
one from the Italian Open. Like two others this year, it was provided
by Andre. Nevertheless, he knows his place in his family, if not
tennis history.</LD>
<LD>   Let's start with the family. Jaden Gil, born in October, has
parents with 29 Grand Slam singles titles, 22 for Steffi Graf, seven
for Andre Agassi. Jaden Gil's most important number is 18 pounds, and
he is thinking about his first, important move. Of course, it doesn't
involve a tennis racket just yet.</LD>
<LD>   "The little guy is awesome," Agassi said. "He's at the age where
he's sitting up on his own. You can tell he's thinking about it
[crawling]. He's got it all worked out. It looks like he's air
swimming."</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps Andre's father, Mike, would already have a racket in the
child's hand. Mike didn't quite take Andre from the stroller to the
service line, but you get the general idea.</TE>
<TE>   When Andre won the Indian Wells tournament for the first time, in
2001, his dad was there. When Andre reached a milestone, his 50th
singles championship, at Scottsdale, Ariz., in March, Mike was there.</TE>
<TE>   These are not typical appearances. Mike would rather be in front
of the television set, remote control in hand, VCR running, watching
Andre's forehand. And backhand. And footwork. This is where he will
be, far away from Paris, when the French Open starts Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "He prefers it so he can watch it on TV where he can tape it and
then watch it again during commercials," Agassi said of his father.
"He likes going back and rewinding and studying.</TE>
<TE>   "When he watches it live, he gets a little bummed. He can't watch
it again. It's not his desire [to be there]. It's his desire to watch
me and study me in the matches. He enjoys that. He enjoys it that
much."</TE>
<TE>   Father, apparently, still knows best.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh yeah. He's constantly telling me. Constantly. It's nonstop,"
Agassi said. "He's got it all figured out on what I need to do. I
love listening to it. Like I tell him to his face, I think he has
some points. We get into those discussions all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Agassi will tell his father he is dead wrong.</TE>
<TE>   It's a little more difficult for Agassi to talk about his place in
tennis history, his longevity and his amazing talent for rejuvenation
because he is firmly fixed in the present tense, involved in what he
calls "a war out there year after year."</TE>
<TE>   At 32, he moved to No. 3 in the ATP's entry system rankings,
climbing to that spot after winning the Italian Open in Rome on
Mother's Day. He was the oldest player to be in the top three since
Jimmy Connors in June 1986. (In the latest ATP rankings, Agassi is
fourth and will be seeded in that spot at the French Open behind
Lleyton Hewitt of Australia, Marat Safin of Russia and Tommy Haas of
Germany.) He has won seven singles titles since turning 30. Younes El
Aynaoui of Morocco, who turns 31 in September, is next among active
players with four.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Davis Cup captain and ESPN commentator Patrick McEnroe thinks
that Agassi is the slight favorite heading into the French Open. The
previous two years, the spring clay season was dominated by
three-time French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil and
youngster Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain. But the field has been
leveled because of Kuerten's hip surgery in February and Ferrero's
injured thigh.</TE>
<TE>   "My preparation has never been better for Paris, so it's going to
be very interesting," said Agassi, who opens against a qualifier and
could face No. 8 Roger Federer of Switzerland or No. 11 Ferrero in
the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to tell. If you win before Paris, you do have that
question: Is that peaking too soon? You want to play this way in
Paris."</TE>
<TE>   So often, many have left their best stuff behind in Monte Carlo,
Rome or Hamburg, Germany. Agassi, wisely, pulled out of Hamburg,
realizing he couldn't push himself the way he could a few years ago,
and financially able to accept a $40,000 fine and a sizable chunk of
a season-ending bonus.</TE>
<TE>   "I think his chances are great," McEnroe said. "He's in great
condition. He's confident. He's hitting the ball as well as he has.
His preparation has been absolutely perfect.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still more dangerous for him to play some tough
clay-courters and guys that can make him move a little bit. Where
he's still suspect on clay is that his defense is not great. He's
gone from being OK to being very good. If he's playing offense as
well as he did in Rome, he doesn't have to play as much defense."</TE>
<TE>   Haas, who absorbed a straight-set drubbing in the Italian Open
final, would agree.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been playing some unbelievable tennis the last couple of
years," he said. "He looks fitter than ever, more dedicated to the
game."</TE>
<TE>   This is where conventional wisdom flipped, almost magically, for
Agassi in 1999. He went from standing in the shadow of Pete Sampras
to having something Sampras doesn't have, a French Open championship.
Agassi nearly did not come to Paris that year because of a shoulder
injury and punctuated the fortnight by becoming the fifth man to win
all four Grand Slams in his career, joining Don Budge, Rod Laver,
Fred Perry and Roy Emerson.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he doesn't take refuge in names and statistics.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always believed you have to prove you're the best every day
regardless of what you're ranked and what you've won and what you
haven't," Agassi said. "The fact it's just you and that person out
there. I've always been challenged by the next challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Months ago, Agassi's career was supposedly in jeopardy--again. He
suffered a serious wrist injury and pulled out of the Australian Open
hours before the first Grand Slam of 2002 started. There was
speculation, some of it ridiculous, that he was in a final career
slide, dipping on the roller-coaster ride for the last time.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Agassi went home, consulted a prominent hand surgeon,
rehabilitated the injury, parted ways with longtime coach Brad
Gilbert and hired Darren Cahill, the former coach of Hewitt.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi lost to Hewitt in the final of his first tournament of the
year, at San Jose, and since then has won three titles--Scottsdale,
Miami and Rome.</TE>
<TE>   He is 24-3 in 2002 and leads the ATP in service games won (89%),
second-serve points won (57%) and return games won (34%).</TE>
<TE>   "What he's been able to do the last four years is defying the
odds, defying nature, really," McEnroe said. "He's also blessed with
[the fact] that he's the cleanest hitter of the ball I've ever seen,
so he's able to hit the ball big, [and] as long as he's in great
condition and mentally there, his strokes don't deteriorate in any
way.</TE>
<TE>   "He's also just gotten better. He's pushed himself to get better,
gotten his serve better, doing very little things a bit better and
that's what you have to do to stay up there as you get older. You
can't rely on your talent, you have to work on your weaknesses."</TE>

<HD>Red Sox Can't Get Past Mendoza Line</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Yankees really wanted a victory, and needed Ramiro
Mendoza to get it.</LD>
<LD>   Mendoza retired 10 of 11 batters in relief of a struggling David
Wells, and the Yankees ended a three-game losing streak by beating
the Boston Red Sox, 3-2, Saturday at Fenway Park.</LD>
<LD>   Mendoza (2-2) came in with the bases loaded and two out in the
fourth after Manager Joe Torre conferred with pitching coach Mel
Stottlemyre.</LD>
<TE>   "I said to Mel in the fourth inning, 'Where do we go here?'" Torre
said. "He said, 'Use Mendoza as far as he can go.'"</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza made it into the eighth, gave up a leadoff single to Nomar
Garciaparra and was replaced by Mike Stanton, who got the next two
out. Mariano Rivera retired the next four batters for his 15th save
in 17 chances.</TE>
<TE>   "Good teams have to handle bad times. There's no question this was
a huge game," Torre said.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Lowe, who won his previous six decisions, came in leading
the AL with a 1.90 earned-run average and holding opponents to a .158
batting average, but fell behind, 3-0, after two innings.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 6, Tampa Bay 0--Aaron Harang struck out 10 in his major
league debut, pitching three-hit ball for seven innings at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Jermaine Dye hit a two-run homer into the second deck in left
field, and Miguel Tejada hit a two-run homer to help the Athletics
win their third in four games after dropping 14 of 17.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 3, Toronto 0--C.C. Sabathia gave up three hits in seven
innings, and Travis Fryman hit a three-run homer in the eighth at
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Sabathia (4-4), making his second start since being robbed at
gunpoint of $44,102 in cash and jewelry May 17 at a Cleveland hotel,
struck out six and walked three to send the Blue Jays to their 11th
loss in the last 16 home games.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 6, Texas 3--Carlos Beltran and A.J. Hinch homered at
Kansas City, Mo., and Roberto Hernandez became the 15th player in
major league history with 300 saves.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Suppan (5-4) gave up three runs and five hits in 6 1/3
innings for his fourth victory in five decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 6, Detroit 4--Ray Durham hit his 100th career homer and
White Sox relievers combined for 4 2/3 hitless innings at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Lofton hit a two-run double and Durham hit a two-run homer
in a five-run second inning against Seth Greisinger (2-2).</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 3, Seattle 2--Travis Driskill won his first major league
start, and Jeff Conine hit a two-run homer to give the Orioles their
first victory at Safeco Field.</TE>
<TE>   The Orioles ended a streak of 15 consecutive losses at Seattle,
including 14 at Safeco Field. Baltimore's last road victory against
the Mariners came June 1, 1999, at the Kingdome.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-year-old Driskill (2-0) gave up one run and four hits in
six-plus innings, walked one and struck out four. He spent nine years
in the minors before being called up from triple-A Rochester on April
25 and making five relief appearances.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the Mariners transferred designated hitter Edgar
Martinez to the 60-day disabled list because of a slow-healing
hamstring injury.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, 39, had surgery April 13 to remove a ruptured tendon
behind his left knee and re-injured the hamstring two weeks ago while
taking batting practice.</TE>

<HD>Salmon Goes Extra Mile for Angels</HD>
<DH>Baseball: His leadoff homer in 13th beats Twins, 4-3, after
Anaheim rallies in ninth to avoid rare two-game skid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels have not lost consecutive games in more than a month, and
they went to great lengths Saturday night to avoid the feeling
against the Minnesota Twins.</LD>
<LD>   After the Angels rallied to tie the score in the ninth inning, Tim
Salmon, who entered the game in the seventh inning as a pinch-hitter,
deposited Jack Cressend's first pitch in the 13th over the left-field
fence to give them a 4-3 victory before 31,820 at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Salmon said he was thinking about taking a few pitches to give
himself and teammates a chance to get a look at Cressend, the Twins'
sixth pitcher.</LD>
<TE>   "Then, right as I got to box, my thought was, 'I really don't know
what his other pitches are. If he throws a first-pitch fastball I'm
swinging.' And he did."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon's seventh homer curled just inside the foul pole and
improved the Angels' record to 22-4 since losing four games in a row
against Oakland and Seattle April 20-23. They are 28-18 overall.</TE>
<TE>   Angel starter Jarrod Washburn pitched eight mostly outstanding
innings and Ben Weber, Troy Percival, Dennis Cook and Al Levine (2-1)
combined for five scoreless innings as the Angels ended the Twins'
three-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn's performance Saturday continued his impressive
turnaround. After three starts this season, Washburn was 0-2 with a
6.00 earned-run average. But in his last seven starts he is 4-0 with
three no decisions, lowering his ERA to 3.47.</TE>
<TE>   Last Sunday, he gave up one run and three hits in seven innings in
a 6-1 victory over the Chicago White Sox, the only run coming on a
sixth-inning home run by Royce Clayton.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Twins, Washburn did not allow a baserunner until he
walked Doug Mientkiewicz with two out in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   He did not give up a hit until Denny Hocking's two-run double with
two out in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn had a strikeout in each of the first seven innings and
gave up three runs and four hits in his longest outing of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say it was the best I've thrown--I walked a few guys
and my command really wasn't that good," Washburn said. "But we won
the game. That's all that matters."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn was gone by the time the Angels erased a 3-2 deficit in
the ninth to send the game into extra innings.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Spiezio drew a one-out walk from Twin closer Eddie Guardado.
Speedy Julio Ramirez pinch-ran, and he scored on Bengie Molina's
double to the wall in right-center. Adam Kennedy brought the crowd to
its feet when he hit a line drive toward left-center, but shortstop
Cristian Guzman leaped to make the catch and threw to second base to
double up pinch-runner Alfredo Amezaga.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins had taken a 3-2 lead in the eighth by using all fields.</TE>
<TE>   Hocking, the Twins' No. 9 hitter, led off with a double to deep
center field, moved to third base on Jacque Jones' fly ball to deep
left and scored the go-ahead run on Guzman's single to shallow right.</TE>
<TE>   Twin starter Matt Kinney gave up two runs and seven hits and
struck out five in 62/3 innings, his longest performance of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels took a 2-0 lead on a run-scoring double by Kennedy and
a squeeze bunt by Jose Nieves in the second inning, but the Twins
tied the score in the fifth with help from Washburn.</TE>
<TE>   He walked Torii Hunter to start the inning and, one out later,
walked Dustan Mohr. The runners advanced on a wild pitch before
Washburn struck out Tom Prince, setting the stage for the two-run
double to left by Hocking.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels threatened in the seventh when Kennedy and Nieves hit
consecutive two-out singles to chase Kinney and bring on left-hander
J.C. Romero.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon, who is batting .240, pinch-hit for Orlando Palmeiro and
ripped a 2-and-1 pitch toward the mound, but Romero kept his glove
elevated as he fell to the ground and snagged the ball to end the
inning.</TE>
<TE>   When Salmon faced Mike Jackson with one out in the 10th inning, he
said he was thinking about hitting a home run, a strategy that made
him too aggressive and resulted in a ground out to short.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon's change in philosophy in the 13th worked wonders.</TE>
<TE>   "Fish is back," Washburn said.</TE>

<LD>Catcher Bengie Molina entered Saturday night's game against the
Minnesota Twins ranked first in the American League in throwing out
runners attempting to steal.</LD>
<LD>   Molina, who sent the game into extra innings with a run-scoring
double in the ninth inning, has thrown out 14 of 27 potential base
stealers (52%). Last season, Molina threw out only 19 of 79 (24%).</LD>
<LD>   Molina and Manager Mike Scioscia, a former catcher, said Molina
improved his throwing mechanics and footwork during spring training.</LD>
<TE>   "My feet were too wide and I was too long with my arm," Molina
said. "The extra work helped me shorten both up. I kind of got into a
groove."</TE>
<TE>   Molina also credited the pitchers. "They've been good about
throwing over to first and keeping them close," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shortstop David Eckstein did not play for the fourth game in a
row, the longest time out of the lineup because of injury in his pro
career.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want him to get too far away from playing, but you don't
want to put him in a situation he's not ready for," Scioscia said of
Eckstein, who has a sprained left knee. "It might be that he's able
to hit and run before he's ready to go play defense."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota reliever Mike Trombley is in the Southland for the first
time since he was designated for assignment by the Dodgers on March
30.</TE>
<TE>   Trombley, who signed with the Twins on April 15 and was promoted
from triple-A Edmonton on May 15, regrets not having done better for
the Dodgers after being traded by the Baltimore Orioles July 31.</TE>
<TE>   "I just didn't do it for them," said Trombley, 0-4 with a 6.56 ERA
for L.A. "Was anything different? Did the uniform not fit? No.
Everything was terrific. It just didn't go well for me. It was
humbling."</TE>

<HD>Angels' Erstad Takes the Lead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Doing what they had to in an impressive demolition of the American
League's flotsam and jetsam (with apologies to the Chicago White
Sox), the sizzling Angels have now embarked on a more difficult phase
of the schedule.</LD>
<LD>   The current series with the Minnesota Twins, ending today, is part
of it.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels get a breather with two games in Kansas City on Tuesday
and Wednesday, a chance to beef up on ribs while roasting the Royals
again, but they then play 16 in a row against division rival Texas
and four interleague foes: Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, the Dodgers and
St. Louis.</LD>
<TE>   As he said in spring training, and which the Angels have
underscored during the hottest streak in club history, Darin Erstad
remains convinced that there is no better offense and that his team
can beat anybody at any time.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to do it over a full year and not just a few weeks," he
was saying at his locker the other day, "but do I think we can, do I
think we're capable? Absolutely.</TE>
<TE>   "If people think we've taken advantage of a soft part of the
schedule, so be it. We can't be concerned with anything but playing
good baseball no matter who we're playing. It's exciting to come to
the park now knowing everyone is focused on working toward the same
goal."</TE>
<TE>   With considerable validity, the Angels like to push the team
aspect of their emergence as a legitimate challenger to the Seattle
Mariners in the AL West, but this wouldn't be happening if Erstad and
Tim Salmon hadn't rebounded from the wasteland of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon began the weekend having hit .322 in May with four home
runs.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad began the weekend having hit .344--and the Angels were
18-3--since he returned to the lineup after sitting out seven games
with a concussion suffered when his breakneck style carried him face
first into the center-field fence at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to think it's only a coincidence," he said, referring to
how well he has hit since. "It's not like I saw the light and had a
vision."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the lights went out when Erstad hit the fence, as they
did for most of the 2001 season, when he was handicapped by an
arthritic knee and traumatized by an unexpected divorce from his high
school sweetheart. Erstad has admitted that baseball became
secondary, that he lost focus, that "for the first time I simply
wasn't there."</TE>
<TE>   The result was a .258 average, 163 hits, nine homers and 63 runs
batted in, a frustrating and disappointing follow-up to one of the
most powerful seasons in baseball history.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad had batted .355 with 240 hits, 100 RBIs and 25 homers in
2000, a career measuring stick he may never duplicate on a pure
statistical basis but which shouldn't translate to failure if he
doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad batted leadoff in 2000. He now hits second, a link between
the on-base proficiency of David Eckstein and the run producers who
follow.</TE>
<TE>   In a position that obligates Erstad to advance runners and create
opportunities, often giving himself up at the expense of his average,
Manager Mike Scioscia thinks he can be as productive as he was in
2000, driving in and scoring runs, "but possibly not hitting .355 in
the process."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad started the weekend with a .303 average, 20 RBIs and two
home runs.</TE>
<TE>   It is characteristic of his leadership, by example and expression,
that in a tight game Tuesday night, hitless in his first three
at-bats and with a 10-game hitting streak at stake, he elected to
sacrifice a runner into scoring position on his final at bat.</TE>
<TE>   As hitting instructor Mickey Hatcher recalled, it was Erstad who
stood up in a spring meeting and challenged teammates, saying "it was
time to get serious, to look in the mirror, to stop being selfish and
start doing everything it takes to win. When those words came out of
his mouth I think everyone accepted it as our philosophy and that's
what turned us around."</TE>
<TE>   Does Erstad think he has turned it around, back to the rhythm of
2000?</TE>
<TE>   There is no one answer to that, Erstad said.</TE>
<TE>   He is excited, thinks he is headed in the right direction, but has
work to do before finding a similar comfort zone at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   He gains satisfaction from the way the Angels are playing--"in
that regard this is so much better than two years ago"--and from his
situational hitting.</TE>
<TE>   But "while it would be great to have that kind of year every
year," Erstad said, he isn't trying to recreate 2000 because when
"people start telling you that you used to do this or that, or when
you go back and look at tapes trying to duplicate a swing or
re-create a feeling, the next thing you know you're up there trying
to feel for the pitch instead of letting your natural ability and
instincts take over."</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain: Erstad believes the adversity of last year,
on and off the field, has made him a stronger person.</TE>
<TE>   He is dating a girl he met at the University of Nebraska and says
he has never been happier. He still takes his football mentality to
center field, still has a dedicated work ethic, but he is no longer
what Hatcher calls the "the terminator" in that regard.</TE>
<TE>   "He's learned that he can accomplish what he needs to without
overdoing it and mentally beating himself down," Hatcher said. "He's
more relaxed, a little looser. He even throws in a joke once in
awhile."</TE>
<TE>   The White Sox weren't laughing in December when they agreed to
trade four players for Erstad--unsigned beyond September--only to
have Disney executives veto it in the belief that Erstad was one of
their few recognizable names.</TE>
<TE>   Now Erstad is trying to prove that the best trades can be those
that aren't made. He is trying to convince the Angels that it would
be a mistake to trade him at the July deadline, regardless of his
uncertain contract situation. And he is trying to reestablish his
2000 credentials to enhance his free agent eligibility in the
off-season with the hope of staying in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad is hitting .377 on the road this year but he said, "I'm
very happy here and don't want to go anywhere. There'll come a time
and place [to negotiate a new contract]. I'm confident it'll work
out, but right now I'm focused on the field."</TE>
<TE>   Focused, too, on the tougher weeks ahead.</TE>

<HD>Numbers Say Green's Day Is No. 1</HD>

<LD>First the news, then the views....</LD>
<LD>   News: Shawn Green hits four home runs, collects six hits and sets
a major league record with 19 total bases.</LD>
<LD>   Views: Plugging it into his computers at the Elias Sports Bureau,
baseball's official statistics house, president Seymour Siwoff said:
"You have to say that on the basis of production it's the greatest
day in the history of baseball. How else can you describe it? He
completed a performance that stands by itself. Nobody ever hit four
homers and had six hits in the same game, let alone 19 total bases
and six or more RBIs. On the basis of statistics, which is the only
way we can judge it, he stands alone. Absolutely."</LD>
<TE>   News: The slumping Oakland Athletics send rookie first baseman
Carlos Pena, second baseman Frank Menechino and reliever Jeff Tam to
the minors in favor of a revolving door at first and recalled rookie
Esteban German at second. They then trade Jeremy Giambi to the
Philadelphia Phillies for John Mabry.</TE>
<TE>   Views: With no more Giambis, General Manager Billy Beane denies
that the A's were still angry with Jeremy for failing to slide on the
pivotal play at the plate in the playoffs against the New York
Yankees, possibly costing the A's a World Series berth.</TE>
<TE>   Beane said that Giambi--whose salary is about twice the oft-moved
Mabry's--was simply too "one-dimensional" at a time when the A's, who
began the weekend having lost 16 of their last 21 games, need help at
more than one position. Privately, the A's also weren't happy that
Jeremy kept sniping at the club for failing to retain his brother,
Jason. How Jeremy fits in with the Phillies is a mystery, but the
prevalent belief is that they are trying to trade first baseman
Travis Lee.</TE>
<TE>   News: Phillie Manager Larry Bowa now says he is tired of biting
his lip, accuses his players of lacking the commitment to win and
instructs his coaches to challenge and correct mental mistakes on the
spot.</TE>
<TE>   Views: It was only a week or so ago that Bowa was bemoaning the
fact that he couldn't be himself and had too many "fragile egos" to
tell his players what he really thought. Did anyone really believe
the leopard could change his spots? Bowa's latest tirades included a
verbal assault on discipline czar Bob Watson, who suspended him for
three games Thursday for a recent run-in with umpire Tony Randazzo.
Bowa said Watson has a "vendetta" against him and is on a "power
trip." He angrily called his suspension a "joke," but his emotional
outbursts aren't drawing much front office laughter any more.</TE>
<TE>   News: Mike Piazza, responding to tabloid rumors, said he is
heterosexual, not homosexual.</TE>
<TE>   Views: The New York Post didn't push the journalistic envelope, it
pulverized it. At the same time, comments by Met Manager Bobby
Valentine and a wide spectrum of players that a gay player, in this
era, would not create consternation and problems for his team, while
noble, are not realistic. In the narrow and still macho confines of
the clubhouse, an openly gay player would be certain to create a
measure of anxiety among teammates. No one will admit that, but it's
the unfortunate and cold truth.</TE>
<TE>   News: Texas Ranger owner Tom Hicks says the team is going to
operate "within our means" from now on and begin a two- or three-year
rebuilding program designed to reduce a $105-million payroll to about
$70 million.</TE>
<TE>   Views: After the $252-million signing of Alex Rodriguez and last
winter's $70-million addition of Chan Ho Park, Hicks has no one to
blame but himself for the inflated payroll and now-deflated
expectations. Hicks claims the Rangers will lose $51 million this
year, and whether the standings have gotten to him or Bud Selig has,
it seems unlikely that the Rangers will re-sign either Ivan Rodriguez
or Rafael Palmeiro, both eligible for free agency when the season
ends.</TE>
<TE>   News: Selig cites the NFL's "reasoned economic system" for NFL
parity and increasing franchise values.</TE>
<TE>   Views: As the commissioner and staff ride the campaign train
through newspaper offices across the country, bemoaning baseball's
competitive disparities and knocking their product amid another
season of wonderful performances, they leave one thing out. A major
reason for NFL parity is the year-to-year schedule juggling that pits
teams with the best records against one another and teams with the
poorer records against one another.</TE>
<TE>   News: Jose Canseco says 85% of major leaguers use steroids and
will name many of them in a tell-all book.</TE>
<TE>   Views: Well, there's this from Barry Bonds, who denies using
steroids, says there's nothing an accused player can do but sue
"every newspaper for every article that comes out and that's
basically what a lot of us want to do," and, in regard to Canseco,
adds: "I think it's just sad. I don't know what Jose's frustration
is. I like the guy personally, but I don't understand where he's
going with this. I mean, players didn't do anything to Jose other
than admiring him as a player. Now that he's retired, why would he
take shots at other players? It kind of reminds me of my ex-wife. You
get [angry], you want half."</TE>
<TE>   News: Irrepressible Mike Veeck announces a cushion giveaway by his
St. Paul Saints of the independent Northern League on June 7.</TE>
<TE>   Views: Never will fans experience more delight in taking their
seats. The cushions have a picture of Selig on one side and union
head Don Fehr on the other.</TE>

<HD>Bouton Throws a Curve to Canseco</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Former big league pitcher Jim Bouton, author of the classic book
"Ball Four," warns Jose Canseco about writing a tell-all book about
major league baseball because it won't have the same impact.</LD>
<LD>   What's left to expose?</LD>
<LD>   "To top what goes on in the news, he would have to find a pro
athlete who has killed three or more people," Bouton said.</LD>
<TE>   "And on the medical side he'd have to find not just steroid use,
but somebody who is now pitching with cloned body parts.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than that, he's behind the curve."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which player holds the NBA playoff record for points
scored in an overtime period?</TE>
<TE>   End of an era: Geoff Russell of GolfWorld reports that Gary and
Michael Nicklaus failed to qualify for the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   "That means, barring a last-minute special invitation to their
father, Jack, next month's U.S. Open will be the first since 1959
without a Nicklaus in the field."</TE>
<TE>   No such luck: Alden Robinson, director of the movie "The Sum of
All Fears," about filming a stadium attack scene in Montreal: "I want
to apologize to the people of Montreal. A lot of people thought we
were going to blow up Olympic Stadium and were very disappointed when
they learned we weren't."</TE>
<TE>   Bruin on the bubble: Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times has an
update on former UCLA and Chicago Bear quarterback Cade McNown: "[He]
is already on the bubble with the Dolphins. The only spot [Coach]
Dave Wannstedt has open is third-string quarterback, and McNown,
Wannstedt told the Miami Herald, has 'just got to be more
consistent.'"</TE>
<TE>   Hooked: English actor Hugh Grant, on his latest hobby, golf: "I've
become obsessed. I'd hope to hate it--it's so unchic. I wish I'd
become a surfer."</TE>
<TE>   End of the line? Jim Armstrong in the Denver Post: "Memo to
Seattle Seahawk Coach Mike Holmgren, who picked up Ryan Leaf the
other day after he was dumped by the Cowboys: Sorry, but not even
Frasier can help this guy."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1959, Pittsburgh's Harvey Haddix had
an amazing pitching performance, working 12 perfect innings before
losing to the Milwaukee Braves, 1-0, in the 13th.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back again: On this day in 1983, the Lakers had only five
free-throw attempts against Philadelphia in the second game of their
NBA championship series. Predictably, the Lakers lost and were swept
by the 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   Announcer's nightmare: It's understandable why running back
Oyeniran Olalere Odunayo-Ojo of NFL Europe's Rhein Fire goes by the
nickname of Oje. Not only can Oye, a true prince of his clan in
Nigeria, run the ball, he speaks three different African languages,
as well as German and English.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Clyde Drexler of Portland, 13, against the Lakers
on April 29, 1992.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Italy's World Cup team got this send-off from Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who owns the AC Milan club team: "You are
traveling to the Far East to win," he said. "If you fail, better you
stay there."</TE>
<TE>   He was kidding, of course, or was he?</TE>

<HD>Green Has Home in Record Book</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Dodger slugger hits two more home runs in 10-5
victory over Arizona, giving him major league mark for homers in a
three-game stretch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Shawn Green hit two more home runs Saturday night, giving him nine
homers in five games and carving another niche for himself in
baseball's record book, and the Dodger right fielder admitted after a
10-5 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks that this whole power trip
is beginning to seem a bit surreal.</LD>
<LD>   "It feels like it's not me doing this," said Green, who dazzled a
Bank One Ballpark crowd of 47,356 with a three-run homer in the fifth
inning and a two-run shot in the ninth. "It's like it's someone else,
and I'm along for the ride."</LD>
<LD>   And who might that someone else be? Hank Aaron? Willie Mays? Babe
Ruth? Barry Bonds? Or all of the above, rolled up in one and dressed
for the past week in Dodger blue?</LD>
<TE>   Green, who was in such a horrendous slump he failed to drive a
ball out of the infield in five consecutive games on the last
home-stand, is 14 for 21 with 17 runs batted in over his last five
games, raising his average from .231 to .282.</TE>
<TE>   He became the 14th player in major league history to hit four home
runs in a game Thursday at Milwaukee. He has seven home runs in his
last three games, breaking the major league record of six, held by 11
players. He set a National League record with nine home runs in a
calendar week.</TE>
<TE>   That broke the previous mark of eight homers that was held by
Pittsburgh's Ralph Kiner (1947), Cincinnati's Ted Kluszewski (1956)
and San Diego's Nate Colbert (1972). Washington's Frank Howard (1968)
holds the major league record with 10 homers in a week.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in quite a groove; this is something I don't think a lot of
us will see again in the course of our lifetime," Dodger Manager Jim
Tracy said. "He's [14 for 21] and nine of those hits are home runs.
That would be unbelievable enough if the [14] hits were singles. It's
just an unbelievable feat."</TE>
<TE>   Even more remarkable: Green's last homer, a 387-foot screaming
line drive into the left-field seats that was his 12th of the season,
was a broken-bat hit. Green hit all nine of his homers during the
streak with the bat, a Rawlings 456 B model, 34 inches, 32 ounces,
but the wounded lumber is now headed to Baseball's Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "It died here," Green said. "I'm gonna miss that bat. I got a lot
of mileage out of it. Hopefully, it wasn't just the bat."</TE>
<TE>   Green's first homer off Arizona starter Rick Helling, which
traveled an estimated 414 feet to straight-away center field, gave
the Dodgers a 7-1 lead in the fifth. He also ripped a sacrifice fly
to right in the seventh, and his two-run shot in the ninth gave him
six RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're locked in like that," Arizona Manager Bob Brenly
said, "you might as well roll it up there."</TE>
<TE>   Green is on such a tear that he overshadowed another rare feat--a
grand slam by Dave Roberts, the diminutive Dodger leadoff batter who
had all of three home runs in 110 previous big league games before
his two-out shot in the second inning that jump-started the Dodger
offense and was the second grand slam of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts also doubled and scored an insurance run in the seventh
and reached on an infield single and scored on Green's homer in the
ninth, helping the Dodgers assure they would not be swept by the
Diamondbacks, who will send Randy Johnson to the mound for today's
series finale.</TE>
<TE>   Green's last homer provided some breathing room for the Dodgers
after Arizona tagged reliever Giovanni Carrara for three runs in the
eighth, the final coming on Junior Spivey's RBI triple, to turn an
8-2 lead to an 8-5 lead.</TE>
<TE>   But Tracy summoned closer Eric Gagne, who retired Luis Gonzalez on
a fly ball to left to end the eighth. Green's homer made it 10-5 in
the ninth, and Gagne blanked the Diamondbacks in the bottom of the
ninth for his 16th save.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Andy Ashby gave up two runs and five hits in 52/3
innings, pitching his way out of several jams and benefiting from
several Diamondback base-running gaffes to even his record at 4-4. He
struck out five, walked four and hit a batter.</TE>
<TE>   But with the way Green has been hitting, Dodger pitchers can
afford to make a few mistakes here and there.</TE>
<TE>   "You almost snicker about [Green's hot streak], but it's a snicker
of awe, like, 'Are you kidding me?'" Tracy said. "He's got nine home
runs in five games. That's a season for some guys. And a couple have
been balls that didn't look like they were going out. But when the
guy is right, with the backspin he puts on the ball, it never comes
down until it reaches the seats."</TE>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>The more players you ask about facing Arizona pitcher Randy Johnson,
who will oppose Dodger ace Kevin Brown today, the wider the range of
opinions on how to approach the hard-throwing 6-foot-10 left-hander.</LD>
<LD>   Dodger first baseman Eric Karros: "You try not to do much at all;
take nice, easy swings and let him supply the power."</LD>
<LD>   Catcher Paul Lo Duca: "You have to be aggressive. If you see
anything good, anything close to the strike zone, you better swing
because it might be the only pitch to hit you get."</LD>
<TE>   Outfielder Marquis Grissom: "You have to be patient."</TE>
<TE>   Three different approaches, three sets of results: Karros vs.
Johnson has been an all-or-nothing proposition; he has a .222 career
average, 12 strikeouts--and three home runs--in 27 at-bats against
him. Lo Duca has a .389 average with one home run against Johnson.
Grissom is batting .040 (one for 25) with 15 strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   "Your first goal is to get some base runners," Dodger Manager Jim
Tracy said. "The only way you can wear down and fatigue a premier
power pitcher is to force him to pitch out of jams. If there's no one
on base and he's constantly throwing out of a windup, it's very
difficult to do anything with him. But he's up against a formidable
foe, and they realize that too."</TE>
<TE>   After a shaky first month, when Brown suffered a setback in his
recovery from elbow surgery and struggled to find any consistency,
the right-hander seems to have found solid footing, giving up four
earned runs and 17 hits in 19 1/3 innings of his last three starts.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has a 3-1 record and 1.69 ERA in 12 starts against Arizona.
Johnson, who has a 98-mph fastball and a vicious slider, has a 4-2
record and 2.55 ERA in 10 starts against the Dodgers.</TE>

<HD>War Emblem Still Has Plenty to Prove</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD ROSENBLATT</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Bob Baffert has already proclaimed War Emblem a "superhorse," and
stopped just short of guaranteeing that his colt will become the
first Triple Crown champion in nearly a quarter-century.</LD>
<LD>   The trainer made his remarks the morning after War Emblem added
the Preakness Stakes to his Kentucky Derby victory.</LD>
<LD>   Should he conquer the one mile in the Belmont Stakes on June 8,
War Emblem would give racing its 12th Triple Crown winner and first
since Affirmed in 1978.</LD>
<TE>   But even if War Emblem completes his remarkable rise to stardom,
does the speedy black colt deserve to be in the same company as such
Triple Crown greats as Citation (1948), Secretariat (1973) and
Seattle Slew (1977)?</TE>
<TE>   "To this point, you'd have to consider him a substandard Triple
Crown winner compared to Affirmed, Seattle Slew, Citation," said
Steve Cauthen, "The Kid" who rode Affirmed. "But if he goes on and
continues to prove himself to be a true champion, he'll be remembered
with them."</TE>
<TE>   Penny Chenery, who owned Secretariat, said War Emblem certainly
has a chance to earn his place among racing's greats.</TE>
<TE>   "He's either the best horse in 25 years--or the luckiest," said
Chenery. "But I don't think the end of the Triple Crown is
definitive. He'll have to go on and beat horses that weren't ready in
the spring. And then he'd have to prove he can keep going."</TE>
<TE>   The last four Triple Crown winners--Citation, Secretariat, Seattle
Slew and Affirmed--were all considered exceptional racehorses from
the start, as were Whirlaway (1941), Count Fleet (1943) and War
Admiral (1937). Indeed, Secretariat was Horse of the Year at age 2.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Sir Barton did not win a race before the 1919
Kentucky Derby, and Gallant Fox (1930) and his son Omaha (1935)
showed only flashes of promise as 2-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   But after sweeping the Triple Crown, they all continued winning
and proving themselves worthy champions.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Cordero Jr., a Hall of Fame jockey who has won the Kentucky
Derby three times, said War Emblem still has some running to do
before he's recognized as "exceptional."</TE>
<TE>   "Winning the Triple Crown is a very big step, but he'll have to do
more," Cordero said. "Just beating 3-year-olds doesn't mean great.
He's got to beat older horses, too."</TE>
<TE>   While War Emblem has rolled to four straight victories, his past
could play a part in determining his legacy. He won but two modest
races as a 2-year-old, and finished a distant sixth to Repent in his
first stakes race, the Risen Star, a Grade 3 race at the Fair
Grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Even after he won the Illinois Derby on April 6, his 84-year-old
owner Russell Reineman thought he had no shot in the Kentucky Derby,
and was happy to sell 90 percent of him to Saudi Prince Ahmed bin
Salman for $900,000 three weeks before the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   None of this should be held against War Emblem, but it might.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a lot of criticism but it's not the horse's fault,"
Chenery said.</TE>
<TE>   Added trainer Shug McGaughey, whose Easy Goer spoiled Sunday
Silence's Triple Crown bid in 1989: "Because of the way it came
about, I just don't know if it would mean as much in the annals of
racing as it would normally. It certainly would be a great
accomplishment, though."</TE>
<TE>   Completing the Derby-Preakness-Belmont grind--five weeks, three
race tracks, three distances--is an enormous achievement in itself.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of respect for those Triple Crown winners," Baffert
said. "They were really tough, good horses. It can be done, but it's
got to be done by a tough, fast horse."</TE>
<TE>   And that's exactly what Baffert has. War Emblem went wire to wire
in winning the Derby by four lengths over Proud Citizen, then took
the Preakness by three-quarters of a length over 45-1 shot Magic
Weisner.</TE>
<TE>   After the Preakness, some trainers said the opposition may be
subpar.</TE>
<TE>   "This year's crop isn't really super," said Nancy Alberts, the
owner-breeder-trainer of Magic Weisner. "That's why my mediocre horse
looked so good."</TE>
<TE>   So good, in fact, Magic Weisner will try again in the Belmont. So
will Proud Citizen and as many as 13 others in what could be the
largest Belmont field with a Triple Crown on the line.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer John Ward won't be sending Booklet to New York. Ward, who
trained 2001 Derby winner Monarchos, said last year he believed the
next Triple Crown winner would come from a mediocre group of
3-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to say it, but my prophecy of last year may come true,"
Ward said after Booklet ran 12th in the Preakness.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert will arrive in New York for his third Triple try in six
years. He says it's his strongest.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nobody faster than him. He just goes," said Baffert. "As
long as he stays like he is, it shouldn't be a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Baffert nearly won with Silver Charm in 1997 and Real Quiet in
1998. Both won the Derby and Preakness, but Silver Charm was beaten
three-quarters of a length by Touch Gold and Real Quiet lost by a
nose to Victory Gallop in their Belmonts.</TE>
<TE>   This will be the eighth time since 1978 that a Triple Crown is on
the line in the Belmont, and Chenery feels a breakthrough is
imminent.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be the moment," she said.</TE>

<HD>Recharged Revolution Beats Galaxy</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Galaxy forward Carlos Ruiz may be Major League Soccer's leading goal
scorer, but no player is on a streak quite like New England's Taylor
Twellmen.</LD>
<LD>   Twellmen scored in his sixth consecutive game and the Revolution
also picked up key contributions from new acquisitions Diego Serna
and Daniel Hernandez in a 3-2 victory over the Galaxy in front of
15,146 at CMGI Field in Foxboro, Mass., on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Twellman, 22, became the sixth player in MLS history to score in
six games in a row. The league record is seven, held by Twellman's
teammate Wolde Harris and D.C. United's Raul Diaz Arce.</LD>
<TE>   Ruiz did score his league-leading eighth goal in the 90th minute,
volleying in a Tyrone Marshall cross, but the game had been decided
at that point.</TE>
<TE>   "The way we played tonight was not Galaxy soccer and it is not the
kind of soccer that we are capable of playing," said Galaxy Coach
Sigi Schmid, whose team was playing its fourth consecutive road game
and fell to 4-3-2.</TE>
<TE>   After Twellman's goal in the 11th minute, the Galaxy tied it at
1-1 when Winston Griffiths scored his first MLS goal in the 36th
minute. Griffiths took a midfield pass from Jesus Ochoa before
cutting in from the left wing to blast a shot that deflected into the
net off goalkeeper Juergen Sommer's hands.</TE>
<TE>   New England (3-4-1) took a 2-1 lead when Steve Ralston scored six
minutes into the second half. Ralston redirected a free kick by
Hernandez, who joined the Revolution on Friday with Serna and Brian
Kamler after a six-player trade with the New York/New Jersey
MetroStars.</TE>
<TE>   The game also was the first for interim coach Steve Nicol, who
replaced the fired Fernando Clavijo on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Serna entered the game in the 64th minute and scored his first
goal for New England 12 minutes later on a give-and-go with Jim
Rooney, chipping a shot over Galaxy goalkeeper Matt Reis.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy finishes its five-game road trip Saturday at Denver
against the Colorado Rapids. Los Angeles won the first two games
against Kansas City and Chicago before losing two in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "We have one more road trip and can still finish this five-game
stretch with an above .500 record," Schmid said. "So the final road
match against Colorado now becomes that much more important."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Barrero</TE>

<TE>   In other MLS games:</TE>
<TE>   Columbus 1, Dallas 1--Chad Deering scored in the ninth minute of
stoppage time as the Burn (3-2-4) tied the Crew (3-4-2) in front of
13,773 at Columbus, Ohio, in a game delayed by an injury and
lightning.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus opened the scoring in the 66th minute on a goal by Jeff
Cunningham, his fourth of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Burn defender Ryan Suarez went down with a back injury midway
through the second half after a collision with Edson Buddle. The
delay added 10 minutes of stoppage time. The game was then delayed
for 46 minutes after the first overtime because of lightning.</TE>
<TE>   New York/New Jersey 1, Kansas City 1--Mamadou Diallo, traded to
the MetroStars (3-5-2) on Friday in the six-player deal with New
England, scored a goal in the tie in front of 18,401 at East
Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Klein scored his third goal of the season to give the
Wizards (2-3-3) the early lead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In WUSA games:</TE>
<TE>   New York 2, San Diego 1--Emily Janss and Linda Ormen scored goals
off assists from Tiffeny Milbrett as the Power (2-4-1) defeated the
Spirit (2-3-2) in front of 4,689 at Uniondale, N.Y., to end a
five-game winless streak. Lori Lindsey scored for San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, Carolina 1--Marinette Pichon had two goals and
Kelly Smith broke a tie on a penalty kick as the Charge (5-1-0)
defeated the Courage (3-1-2) in front of 5,281 at Cary, N.C. Danielle
Slaton scored her first WUSA goal for Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 1, Boston 0--U.S. national team forward Cindy Parlow,
playing with a broken nose, scored in the 10th minute to lead the
Beat (3-3-1) over the Breakers (2-3-2) in front of 4,917 at Atlanta.
Parlow scored when she headed Nikki Serlenga's free kick</TE>

<HD>Bonds Takes Fifth Alone</HD>
<DH>Giants: Slugger hits 584th homer to move ahead of McGwire,
but gets little pleasure out of feat because San Francisco loses,
6-3.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>If Barry Bonds was excited about passing Mark McGwire on the career
home run list, the San Francisco Giant slugger sure didn't show it.</LD>
<LD>   "I have no thoughts," Bonds said. "We lost. There is no
satisfaction in losing."</LD>
<LD>   Bonds hit his 584th homer to move into sole possession of fifth
place, but Terry Shumpert's three-run home run lifted the Colorado
Rockies over the Giants, 6-3, Saturday at Coors Field.</LD>
<TE>   Bonds connected against left-hander Denny Neagle in the fourth
inning, driving the first pitch into the seats in left-center field
for his 17th homer. Bonds trails Frank Robinson by two homers for
fourth place all-time.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a bright spot," Manager Dusty Baker said. "A bright spot
on a dark afternoon."</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies have won five in a row to move above .500 (25-24) for
the first time since April 4.</TE>
<TE>   Neagle departed after four innings after being hit on the left
knee by Benito Santiago's line drive. The left-hander scrambled to
the ball and threw out Santiago to end the inning, then was helped to
the dugout by two teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Neagle has a bruised left kneecap. X-rays did not reveal a
fracture or any serious damage.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sore, but I have no doubt I will make my next start," Neagle
said. "I had the presence of mind to throw out Santiago, wanted to
continue playing, but thought better of it."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Nichting (1-1) replaced Neagle and gave up one run and two
hits in two innings. Jose Jimenez pitched the ninth for his 13th save
in as many chances. Larry Walker had a two-run single for the
Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Rueter (6-2) gave up six runs and nine hits in six innings to
lose for the first time since April 11. Rueter had won six
consecutive decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado led, 3-0, after three innings. Opposite-field doubles by
Juan Pierre and Juan Uribe produced a run in the first inning, and
Walker drove in two with a one-out single in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' homer cut the deficit to 3-1. He finished one-for-four, and
Ramon Martinez had two run-scoring doubles for the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco managed only two hits against Neagle, but had two
hits and scored a run in the fifth inning against Nichting. Reggie
Sanders reached on an infield single and, after Damon Minor walked,
Martinez doubled to right to score Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies increased their lead to 6-2 on Shumpert's two-out,
three-run homer to left in the fifth inning. Rueter retired the first
two batters, but Todd Helton singled and Todd Zeile doubled ahead of
Shumpert's home run.</TE>

<HD>Tway Emerges From Memorial Pack</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years of rain-delayed runaways by Tiger Woods are over, not to
mention his quest for a fourth consecutive victory in the Memorial
tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Attention now shifts to Bob Tway, the 43-year-old Oklahoman and
former PGA champion who walked the line between aggressive shots and
disastrous results and positioned himself for his first victory in
seven years.</LD>
<LD>   "It would be a big boost for my confidence," said Tway, who has
won only two times since winning the Memorial in 1989.</LD>
<TE>   Playing bogey-free while other contenders succumbed to mistakes on
the back nine Saturday at Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin,
Ohio, Tway had a four-under 68 to emerge from the pack and take a
one-stroke lead over Stewart Cink into today's final round.</TE>
<TE>   Five players had a share of the lead until Tway birdied No. 17
from 15 feet to finish at 12-under 204, the first time he has had at
least a share of the 54-hole lead since the Disney Classic three
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Cink could have joined him but missed a three-foot par putt on the
final hole, which he attributed to a gust of wind that hit him as he
was taking the putter back.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a lot of surface area here for the wind to hit," said
the 6-foot-4 Cink.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Leonard, the 36-hole leader, was among the leaders all
afternoon until two bogeys on the back nine dropped him back to 206
and an even-par 72.</TE>
<TE>   Vijay Singh also was tied at one point and only two strokes back
until he drove into a creek on the final hole and took double bogey.
He shot a 72 and was four strokes behind.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, trying to become the first player in 75 years to win the
same event four consecutive years, had to settle for an even-par
72--16 pars, one bogey and his only birdie coming on a tee shot at
the par-3 eighth hole that ricocheted off a tree and onto the green.</TE>
<TE>   He finished at 216, 12 strokes out of the lead in a tie for 56th.</TE>
<TE>   Another streak is in jeopardy for Woods. He has finished in the
top 30 in the last 59 stroke-play events on the PGA Tour, dating to
his tie for 56th in the Bay Hill Invitational three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   After three rounds, he is tied with Jack Nicklaus, who played a
solid round of one-under 71, finishing with a birdie on the 18th
hole.</TE>
<TE>   "The course is going to play fairly easy," Nicklaus said. "It has
to be if I shot 71."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dan O'Neill shot a five-under 67, birdieing five of the final nine
holes in rainy conditions, for a share of the second-round lead in
the Farmers Charity Classic at Ada, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Australia's Rodger Davis also shot a 67 and Jay Sigel had a 69 to
match O'Neill at eight-under 136 on the Egypt Valley course. Morris
Hatalsky (66) was a stroke back, and Bob Gilder (68), Wayne Levi
(68), Jim Thorpe (69) and Tom Wargo (69) followed at 138.</TE>
<TE>   The 51-year-old O'Neill tied for 10th in Mexico in the Audi Senior
Classic but has finished over par in the other 11 events he's played
this season. He has only two rounds in the 60s this season, both this
week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rosie Jones shot a five-under 67 to move within one shot of Laura
Diaz, who has led all three rounds of the LPGA Corning (N.Y.)
Classic.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I always have an advantage when I come to this course,"
said Jones, who has five top-five finishes at Corning and is the only
player to win the tournament twice, in 1996 and '97.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz had a 69 and led at 12-under 204. Silvia Cavalleri of Italy,
who has never finished higher than seventh in two full years on the
LPGA Tour, was alone in third at 207 after a 70.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Bartholomew, who was tied with Diaz for the lead at the start
of the day, faltered with four bogeys on the back nine and finished
with a 75 and 210 total.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's Lorena Ochoa, who won 12 of the 20 college tournaments
she entered, will forgo her final two years of eligibility to join
the LPGA Tour, the school announced.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa, 20, helped lead Arizona to a second-place finish at this
year's NCAA tournament.</TE>

<DH>Motor racing: Sport's showcase day features the Indy 500,
Coca-Cola 600 and Grand Prix of Monaco.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ED HINTON</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE MOTOR SPORTS WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Down at the corner of 16th Street and Georgetown Road, just outside
the most massive grandstands on Earth, the revelers are completing
their annual ritual of repaving the intersection with tens of
thousands of flattened beer cans.</LD>
<LD>   Across the Atlantic, on the Riviera, the little Heliport de Monaco
is bedlam. Packed helicopters arrive by the minute, raising a
relentless spray off the surface of the Mediterranean, ferrying high
rollers from Nice Airport across the bay. The harbor is full of
yachts. Inbound traffic is gridlocked on the mountain roads, backed
up along the French coast in one direction and to the Italian border
in the other.</LD>
<LD>   Down near the town of Concord, N.C., just north of Charlotte,
motor homes and campfires for miles in every direction are
reminiscent of enormous armies encamped on the eve of some great
battle.</LD>
<TE>   The world's biggest motor racing weekend is at hand.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the world's best drivers will be divided into three
fields--for the 86th Indianapolis 500, the 60th Grand Prix of Monaco
and the 43rd Coca-Cola 600.</TE>
<TE>   The traditions are tied to Memorial Day weekend in the United
States and Ascension Day in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The race here is oldest, dating to 1911, when the world's first
500-mile race was run.</TE>
<TE>   Speedway founder Carl Fisher wanted a longer race than the
100-milers he had been staging at his new track. But he had to limit
the race to seven hours so spectators could travel by carriages and
primitive automobiles in daylight from their homes to the track and
back.</TE>
<TE>   He reckoned the race cars of the time would average about 70 mph.
Seven hours times 70 mph equaled 490 miles, and Fisher's promotional
sense in rounding up to 500 because it sounded better is why there
are so many 500-mile races in the U.S. today.</TE>
<TE>   In that first 500, winner Ray Harroun more than made up for
Fisher's extra 10 miles, blistering the track at a race average of
more than 74 mph. (The field for today's race averaged more than 228
mph in qualifying.)</TE>
<TE>   All different, all the same</TE>
<TE>   Few folks here or at Charlotte have a clue what "banco"--the most
ice-nerved utterance in the Casino de Monte Carlo--means, let alone
the inclination to place a 100,000-franc plaque on the longshot "tie"
area of the baccarat table.</TE>
<TE>   Nor would the women in Hermes scarves, sipping Dom Perignon on
terraces overlooking the street course, care at all for a taste of
North Carolina barbecue or an Indiana corndog.</TE>
<TE>   The engine in Michael Schumacher's Ferrari cost more--about $5
million--than any 10 cars in the Indy 500, or the total value of the
43-car field at Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   But high technology be damned in NASCAR's realm. "All our fans
want inside a race car is a hero," says Lowe's Motor Speedway
President Humpy Wheeler.</TE>
<TE>   What they all share, from the first-turn grandstands here to
Charlotte's infield to the balconies in Monaco, is a love of motor
racing--and not necessarily pure speed.</TE>
<TE>   The Indy cars will run at more than 220 mph, the stock cars in the
180s, but the exotic Formula One cars at about 95--but this through
narrow streets and around corners where you'd be hard-pressed to do
15 mph in a passenger car.</TE>
<TE>   More than half a million people will attend the three. But the
best seats, by far, will be occupied by millions of TV viewers.</TE>
<TE>   With one click of the channel-changer, American fans can catch all
three. ABC will telecast the 500 live, followed by Monaco on tape.
Then comes Fox, with the 600 live this afternoon, and one of racing's
great illusions comes into play: "The darker it gets, the faster they
go," is how Wheeler describes the sensation.</TE>
<TE>   Which scenario raises more goose bumps, tightens more throats,
mists more eyes?</TE>
<TE>   Is it during the final strains of "How I long ... for my
Innn-dee-ah-nah home" when more than 300,000 voices roar in unison?</TE>
<TE>   Or is it the Carolina air trembling with the thunder of 43 huge
engines awakening, preparing for the longest journey in NASCAR,
starting in daylight, roaring through the dusk and into darkness, as
the speedway's massive lighting system intensifies?</TE>
<TE>   Or is it the grid at Monaco, sitting still, engines revving to a
siren-scream 18,000 rpm in the final seconds before the light turns
green, then shrieking away, diving into the semi-dark mile of the
tunnel, popping back out into daylight, through the little chicane,
then dashing up the incline along the sea wall, in full view of the
yachts?</TE>
<TE>   To have stood amid all three, at one time or another, is to know
that each in its way is just as magnificent as the others on this,
the grandest racing weekend of the year.</TE>

<HD>IRL Tries to Topple CART</HD>
<DH>Motor racing: Indy series drivers will be seeking
redemption after the embarrassing results of last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>This is the day Indy Racing League drivers have been waiting for all
year, a chance at redemption after their humiliation in last year's
Indianapolis 500, the centerpiece of the IRL season.</LD>
<LD>   Invaders from Championship Auto Racing Teams, the rival open-wheel
series, took the first five positions in the 2001 race.</LD>
<LD>   The highest IRL finisher was A.J. Foyt's ageless Chilean, Eliseo
Salazar, who was seventh. Tony Stewart, from Winston Cup, was sixth.</LD>
<TE>   When today's $9-million race, the 86th Indianapolis 500, gets
underway, it will have the fastest field in history with a 33-car
average of 228.648 mph. It may also be the most competitive.</TE>
<TE>   "More cars are capable of winning this race than ever before,"
said team owner Chip Ganassi, who won the race in 2000 with rookie
driver Juan Montoya of Colombia. "I would say there are 20 cars that
could win without it being too big a surprise."</TE>
<TE>   Despite denials from both sides that there is an IRL-CART rivalry,
that is the public perception. Some fans even insist that Roger
Penske's pair of Helio Castroneves and Gil de Ferran, who finished
one-two last year, still count as CART drivers even though they are
now in the IRL.</TE>
<TE>   CART is here with eight drivers, headed by pole-sitter Bruno
Junqueira, a 25-year-old from Belo Horizonte, Brazil, who drives a G
Force-Chevrolet for Ganassi's powerful Target team. Ganassi has
blurred the lines between IRL and CART by fielding teams in both
series, Junqueira and 1999 winner Kenny Brack in CART and motocross
legend Jeff Ward in the IRL.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the first six places in the front two rows are occupied by
Brazilians, headed by Junqueira, who qualified with a speed of
231.342 mph. They are split evenly, Raul Boesel and Felipe Giaffone
from the IRL and Junqueira and Tony Kanaan, the fastest rookie, from
CART.</TE>
<TE>   The two Penske Racing Brazilians, Castroneves and de Ferran, will
start from the fifth row. Penske Racing, winner of 11 Indy 500s, has
never had its highest-starting driver as far back as Castroneves, who
is 13th.</TE>
<TE>   He won last year from the 11th position, then celebrated by
climbing the fence along with members of his crew.</TE>
<TE>   Rookies have won the last two 500s, Montoya in 2000 and
Castroneves last year. There is a strong crop of nine Indy newcomers,
although it is hard to call Kanaan, a veteran of five CART seasons,
or Scotsman Dario Franchitti, a runner-up for the CART championship
in 1999, rookies.</TE>
<TE>   Kanaan, in fact, was Junqueira's instructor at a go-kart school in
Brazil years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I've known Bruno since 1985," Kanaan said. "I was his go-kart
instructor for three years, and I regret that a lot right now.
Yesterday I was talking with him and he said, 'Remember all the hard
times you used to give me when you were telling me what to do? So now
you're a rookie, you just shut up, and I will tell you what to do.'
He was so talented. I wish I had told him to quit so he wouldn't be
here now."</TE>
<TE>   Junqueira finished fifth last year, one of the CART drivers who so
frustrated their IRL rivals.</TE>
<TE>   What made it worse was that six of the IRL's favorites, either
because of nerves, over-anxiousness, lack of experience or that old
standby, cold tires, crashed out of the race in the first 18 laps.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Sharp, the pole-sitter and former IRL champion, didn't make
it through the first turn before spinning into the wall.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going too fast and by the time I got to the corner there
was nothing I could do," Sharp said. "I've had nightmares about that
for a year. I won't make that mistake again."</TE>
<TE>   Like dominoes falling, Sarah Fisher, Scott Goodyear, former
winners Buddy Lazier and Al Unser Jr. and 2001 champion Sam Hornish
Jr. spun out of the race before some of the late arrivals had found
their seats.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a total embarrassment," Hornish said. "It's not going to
happen again. I guarantee it."</TE>
<TE>   Hornish is pragmatic enough, however, to realize that Indy offers
more opportunities for early trouble than anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   "What's supposed to happen and what we were told to do is the guy
on your left has the line into the corner," said the 22-year-old from
Defiance, Ohio, the youngest champion in open-wheel racing history.</TE>
<TE>   "Indy is the only race where we start three wide. You'll have cold
tires and 35 gallons of fuel, and the car definitely handles
differently than it does normally for the first 15 or 20 laps of the
race. You can say and plan for what is going to happen, but whether
it does or not is another thing."</TE>
<TE>   Six former winners are spread through the field, providing some
depth to go with the nine rookies. They are Eddie Cheever Jr. (1998),
Unser Jr. (1992, 1994), Castroneves (2001), Buddy Lazier (1996),
Brack (1999) and Arie Luyendyk (1990, 1997).</TE>
<TE>   Among the rookies, George Mack of Inglewood is one of the
surprises. After failing to post qualifying speed laps during
practice, the former kart driver reached 227.150 mph on "Bump Day"
and will occupy the last row with former IRL champion Greg Ray, who
replaced the injured Salazar on Foyt's team, and Mark Dismore.</TE>
<TE>   Mack has made the most of his opportunity. He took 552 laps in his
310 Racing G Force during the month, more than any other driver at
the Speedway. And he wasn't satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have loved to have been able to run more miles, but as
everybody knows, you just can't do that with your race engine," he
said Thursday after Carburetion Day practice.</TE>
<TE>   "We got some good data, but I guess the perfectionist in me wanted
to find out more. It's been incredible this month. I'm overwhelmed,
just completely overwhelmed."</TE>
<TE>   Cheever and Robbie Buhl, a front-row starter between Junqueira and
Boesel, will attempt to bring Nissan Infiniti its first Indy 500
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Cheever won in an Olds Aurora-powered Dallara, and he scored
Infiniti's first series win in 2000 at Pikes Peak Raceway.</TE>
<TE>   Cheever, one of two driver-owners in the race, will also be
keeping an eye on his teammates, rookie Tomas Schecker from South
Africa and CART driver Max Papis.</TE>
<TE>   Buhl, in his seventh 500, has three finishes in the top 10, but
much of his time this month has been spent coaching Fisher, his
teammate in the Dryer &amp; Reinbold Racing cars.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher responded with the fastest four laps ever by a woman,
229.439 mph, bettering the 225.346 set by Lyn St. James in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing you have to keep in mind when talking about Sarah
is that she's only 21 years old and she knows an awful lot," Buhl
said. "Because she's a racer, she's not afraid to drive the car in.
We've just got to teach her to be patient and say, 'Hey, here's what
the car can do for you. Don't try and carry it, get it to work for
you.' I think those are some of the things I have helped her with."</TE>

<DH>Gil Hodges belongs in Hall of Fame for all the right
reasons</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER KAHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thirty years after a heart attack killed Gil Hodges, a powerful and
gentle man cruelly laid low at 47, a grass-roots movement urges ever
more strongly, "Put Gil in the Hall."</LD>
<LD>   On the record, I am not much of a campaign manager. The
presidential candidates I championed--Gene McCarthy and Ralph
Nader--never got into the White House without a pass. But we are not
talking trivial stuff like politics here. This is important. The
National Baseball Hall of Fame. Gil Hodges was important. He belongs.</LD>
<LD>   Controversy has invaded the village of Cooperstown, N.Y., on the
site of an old Native American settlement beside pristine Lake
Otsego, a ribbon of blue water amid green, uncluttered hills. First
came the messy Pete Rose matter. Did this arrogant churl, a
compulsive gambler and a convicted income-tax cheat, deserve
selection? A blow for character struck home when Rose was barred.</LD>
<TE>   Then Bill James, the baseball statistician, challenged the
judgment and knowledge of the newspapermen who annually vote on
eligible candidates. Like congressmen, these people make mistakes,
but most do their level best reasonably well. Finally, and this is
where Hodges comes in, charges of politics were directed against the
so-called Veterans Committee, a small, select group empowered to
choose people initially overlooked. These complaints led to the
recent creation of a mammoth body--every baseball person, every
broadcaster, every newspaper sportswriter in the Hall--to vote
periodically on such veterans as Hodges. The youngest member of the
Ubergroup, Kirby Puckett, is 41. The oldest, Al Lopez, is 93. The
multi-generationalism suggests little unanimity. As one Hall of Fame
insider, himself a veteran, told me (asking that I not use his name),
"Everyone wants to vote for people from their own time. Hodges has
good overall support so I can see him getting in before much longer.
After that we could go for 10 years without agreement on any other
veteran."</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert Ray Hodges was born in Princeton, not the college town,
but a community in southwestern Indiana's coal-mining country. Gil
remembered that his father, Big Charlie Hodges, rode down to deep
veins in order to support his family and died slowly, one body part
at a time. An accident cost an eye. Another cost some toes. At 54,
still mining, he badly injured a knee. As he lay in a hospital
recovering from surgery, an embolism stopped his heart.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you want to go down to the mines?" I asked Gil one day as we
were driving to Shea Stadium. Hodges paused. He knew how to use
silences. Then, very softly, yet very intensely, "I didn't want to go
down. I didn't want to ever work down there."</TE>
<TE>   Beating the mine shafts was his hope and baseball became his
escape. I never saw Hodges, or his great Dodger teammates, Pee Wee
Reese or Jackie Robinson, play ball with anything other than utmost
dedication. Perhaps the only good thing that can be said of the Great
Depression is that it was a powerful motivator.</TE>
<TE>   Hodges could play third and catch but when he settled in with the
Brooklyn Dodgers during 1948 a rotund recruit from the Negro Leagues,
Roy Campanella, was moving in behind the plate. Hodges switched to
first base and that is where he stayed. He made the All-Star team as
a first baseman eight times.</TE>
<TE>   Hodges, first of all, cast a sense of strength. He stood almost 6
feet 2, weighed 200 mightily muscled pounds and possessed such huge
hands that Reese used to say, "He's the only feller who could play
first base just fine without a glove."</TE>
<TE>   After playing cards one night, Hodges returned to his compartment
on a train and found Dick Williams reading in the lower berth. As a
utility player, Williams had not been assigned the lower. "How'd you
do at cards?" Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Hodges smiled briefly. Then he slipped both arms under Williams,
190 pounds himself, and without visible effort lifted him into the
upper bunk.</TE>
<TE>   The wit was dry and thoughtful. In the Brooklyn dugout once, a lot
of Dodgers had been saying a lot of things very fast, and I stepped
back into the runway to make some notes. Hodges approached me from
behind and a huge hand lightly tapped my shoulder. "Why are you
taking notes here," he asked, "instead of in the dugout?"</TE>
<TE>   "Because," I said, "when some of the fellers see my pencil, they
stop talking."</TE>
<TE>   Gil nodded. "But there are also fellers who won't start talking
until they do see your pencil."</TE>
<TE>   One night in Chicago a mechanic was working on an engine of a
chartered plane and Hodges and I stood chatting on the tarmac waiting
to board. At length the man closed his tool kit and walked away from
the aircraft saying, just audibly, "Oh, the hell with it." Hodges
reached him in a few strides, clamped a great hand on the mechanic's
shoulder and said, "The hell with what?" Before he let the mechanic
go, Gil, to general relief, had gotten a full explanation.</TE>
<TE>   He married a Brooklyn girl, Joan Lombardi, and settled in
Flatbush, a rarity, a Dodger actually raising his family year-round
in Brooklyn. Whenever he hit a home run at Ebbets Field, crossing
home plate he blew a kiss to Joan. There was nothing theatrical in
the gesture, just a brief expression by a strong man who was deeply
in love with his wife. He wasn't mercenary. Some winters he sold
Buicks in a dealership on Flatbush Avenue to help feed the family and
the checking account. "Gil," says Buzzie Bavasi, the Dodger general
manager for so many triumphant years, "was a GM's dream. Never a
problem. Always ready to play. After 1954, his best year, he came
into my office to get his next contract out of the way. He said he
was looking for $25,000. I had him down for a little more than that
but I didn't want him to think I was going soft."</TE>
<TE>   Bavasi told Hodges, "Twenty-five Gs is too much, but you're a
horse player and so am I. I'm going to put five numbers into this
hat. The odds say you'll get what you want or more." Hodges nodded.
Bavasi put the numbers into the hat. Hodges picked and came up with
$27,000.</TE>
<TE>   "He left my office thinking he'd put one over on me," Bavasi told
me. "I'm sure he's looking down right now and when he reads your
story he'll start laughing. Because I never did tell him that every
number in that hat was the same: $27,000."</TE>
<TE>   Hodges hit 370 homers, four in a single game, and batted .273
across 18 seasons, with time out of baseball during World War II to
help storm Okinawa. The numbers are almost identical with those of
Tony Perez, who already is in the Hall and was not equal to Hodges as
a defensive first baseman. Those huge, mining-town hands also were
deft.</TE>
<TE>   At 39, Hodges signed to manage a terrible Washington team. Amid a
lot of losses he learned that four players had been breaking his
midnight curfew, carousing late. "I know who you are," he said at a
team meeting. "You are each fined $100. But I also know some of you
are married and I don't want to embarrass anyone. On my desk there's
a cigar box. At the end of the day, I'm going to look into it and I
expect to see $400 there. Then the matter will be closed." At the end
of the day Hodges looked into the box. He found $700.</TE>
<TE>   He took over the Mets in 1968 and the team finished ninth. Next
season, Hodges' Mets won the pennant and the World Series. Most of
the universe agreed, this was a miracle. The Brooklyn (almost) native
had returned.</TE>
<TE>   During September 1968, Hodges suffered what he described as "pain
like a drill boring in my chest." It was not excruciating but neither
did it go away. "Did I know what it was?" he said. "I suppose so.
Yes. Did I want to know what it was? No." He had suffered a heart
attack of "mild" proportions. He missed very little work time and
when he returned, he continued to hit fungoes, jog, do calisthenics
and, unfortunately, smoke. "I'm perfect," he told me, "except for a
few mental hang-ups."</TE>
<TE>   "Such as?" I said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have one of those things, you don't forget it."</TE>
<TE>   The man was all work ethic. After the coronary, he could have
looked for a front-office sinecure but chose to go on managing a big
league team, contending with 25 bounding egos, dealing with the New
York media. That is what he was doing, and doing well, when the
second heart attack killed him.</TE>
<TE>   The rules at Cooperstown say that selection is to be based on
character, integrity, sportsmanship and one's contribution to his
team. I'm sorry about Gene McCarthy and Ralph Nader. Even knowing the
risk that my endorsement carries, I still suggest that Gill Hodges
should enter the Hall in a landslide.</TE>

<TE>   The Case for Hodges</TE>
<TE>   Gil Hodges' candidacy for Baseball's Hall of Fame would seem to be
legitimized by his status as the National League's dominant first
baseman of the 1950s, the only decade not to not have a
representative first baseman enshrined in Cooperstown.</TE>
<TE>   During a nine-year stretch from 1949-57, Hodges averaged 32 home
runs, 108 runs batted in and batted .283. He was named to the NL team
for the All-Star Game in eight of those nine seasons.</TE>
<TE>   A look how Hodges compares to other National League first basemen
who were active during his career:</TE>
<TE>*--*
Player           Years  Games  Hits   HR   RBIs   Avg
Orlando Cepeda*  17     2,124  2,351  379  1,365  297
Gil Hodges       18     2,071  1,921  370  1,274  273
Ted Kluszewski   15     1,718  1,766  279  1,078  298
Johnny Mize*     15     1,884  2,011  359  1,337  312
Willie McCovey*  22     2,588  2,211  521  1,555  270</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   *elected to Hall of Fame</TE>
<TE>   Hodges may be victim of a belief that a representative number of
his Brooklyn teammates, immortalized in Roger Kahn's book, "The Boys
of Summer," have already been voted into the Hall of Fame:</TE>
<TE>*--*
Player           Years with Dodgers  Year Elected
Jackie Robinson  1947-56             1962
Roy Campanella   1948-57             1969
Duke Snider      1947-62             1980
Pee Wee Reese    1940-58             1984</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Two other Dodgers from that era have also been elected, although
Sandy Koufax didn't hit his stride until the team had moved to Los
Angeles, and Tommy Lasorda, a pitcher on the 1954 and '55 teams,
earned his berth later as a manager.</TE>

<LD>Among the issues for the Lakers--and there are plenty through three
games of the Western Conference finals--is the disparity in play at
point guard, where Mike Bibby is getting the better of Derek Fisher
and Lindsey Hunter.</LD>
<LD>   While Bibby has averaged 21 points and six assists and has been
the competitive conscience of the Sacramento Kings, Phil Jackson is
still searching for the correct Fisher-Hunter blend.</LD>
<LD>   Fisher, who was so strong in last season's playoffs, has not shot
well and has not stayed close enough to Tony Parker of San Antonio or
Bibby.</LD>
<TE>   Though he slowly has increased Hunter's playing time, Jackson said
Fisher gets the benefit of the doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "Fish has the element of familiarity of how we play together and
how we run our offense," he said. "He's a critical player for us in
his toughness, his ability to come up with the loose ball, things
like that. And, his shooting, though he's not shooting well right
now, have all been elements that we've enjoyed as a player from him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the kind of guy, I'm going to live with the people who have
done good jobs for me in the past. I'm going to give Fish first crack
in the game [Sunday], but we'll make changes as the game goes along.
It's his job. It's his responsibility to find a way to do this. He
had a hell of a struggle against [Allen] Iverson last year in the
finals, yet he found a way to be very effective. We have great faith
that he's going to find a way to survive it."</TE>
<TE>   Asked Saturday where he thought Fisher's head was, Rick Fox
laughed and said, "Still on his shoulders. Still attached to his
body, and still confident he can have an effect on this round of the
playoffs. He's a confident basketball player. I've been around him
enough to know he's going to do a lot of positive things for us.
Right now, his disjointedness has to do with the fact that we're all
disjointed. It's not one individual that's struggled. When our
offense isn't executing the way it should be, we all look horrible."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When the Lakers won big games earlier in the playoffs--Game 3 in
Portland for one, Games 4 and 5 against San Antonio--they talked a
lot about their core players leading the fourth-quarter charges.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday night, Fox, Fisher and Robert Horry--those core
players--combined to play three minutes in the fourth quarter after
collectively shooting six for 23 from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Devean George, Brian Shaw and Hunter got those minutes instead,
and scored 18 points between them.</TE>
<TE>   "They were rolling," Horry said. "If the team is rolling, I don't
care who you have on the floor, you let them keep playing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There were two pieces of good news for Kobe Bryant on Saturday
morning. One, he claimed, his stomach was better.</TE>
<TE>   Two, he said, "I didn't play as bad as I thought I did. It didn't
look that bad on film, as far as staying in the flow of the game and
getting good looks. It's just a matter of going into the next game
and knocking those shots down."</TE>

<HD>Ill-Timed Case of the Blahs Has the Lakers at a Crossroads</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phil Jackson wore one of his favorite caps Saturday, the tan one with
"BLAH BLAH BLAH" stacked on the front, because he knew it would be
one of those days, one of those conversations.</LD>
<LD>   He sat behind a nest of microphones, knocked a few into his lap,
righted them, and then considered the crowd before him and the
playoff game behind him.</LD>
<LD>   Down two games to one against the Sacramento Kings, the Lakers
play Game 4 of the Western Conference finals today at Staples Center.
A loss would do serious damage to their desires to win a third
consecutive NBA title, with two of the last three games--assuming
they'd be required--scheduled for Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   "I think everybody wants to see us under some duress," Jackson
said. "You guys are here like sharks ... with blood in the water.
Look at you guys. So, everybody's anxious to see how we perform in
this situation. I am. I'm very anxious to see how we perform. This is
the making of the team going on and collecting its third championship
or folding its tent and not being able to sustain the pressure and
playing to its potential."</TE>
<TE>   He said "anxious," and probably meant "eager." But he did say
"anxious."</TE>
<TE>   These are unusual hours for the Lakers, who have often played to
the edge of mediocrity, even in the playoffs, during what they
considered their three-peat season. They played poorly in Friday's
Game 3, lost the home-court advantage they won with such force in
Game 1, and now face a good team gaining confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a perilous situation," said Kobe Bryant, who claimed
again to be over the drain of food poisoning. "We're totally aware of
the situation. But we also like to look at it as a challenge, to the
point where it has to excite us. And it does excite us.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not scrambling. We've been down before. We were down last
year in the [NBA] Finals, and that's more pressure than this
situation. You get to the Finals and you go down a game, the opening
game, that's pressure. This right here, it's fun."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers watched a lot of game film Saturday morning, then made
some of the jump shots they missed Friday night. They covered an acre
of strategic ground and then discussed the alternative to getting it
all right.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about what to do in the summertime when you're trying
to relax and have a good time, and how close it'll be if we don't get
this second win," Jackson said with his thin smile. "Our team has to
play a little bit. After watching the tape, we had a couple bad
spells in the ballgame. Yet, it's correctable."</TE>
<TE>   So the Lakers met for about 3 1/2 hours, not long after being
kicked around by Chris Webber and Mike Bibby and friends for a second
consecutive game. The Kings, conversely, didn't practice at all as a
group.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers viewed the game tape, and shot all of those jumpers,
and practiced their free throws, and when Jackson gathered them at
midcourt and asked them how they felt about themselves as a whole, no
one said anything for a long moment.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be all right," Bryant finally said. "We're going
to be fine."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, however, couldn't forget the hesitation.</TE>
<TE>   "That's kind of what they're waiting for," he said. "They're also
waiting for each other to step into this vacuum and play hard and
play with urgency."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings caught a little pool time at their Beverly Hills hotel,
maybe. Shopped. Recharged their cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were ordered to their practice facility at 9:30 a.m.,
perhaps the earliest reporting time of the season.</TE>
<TE>   But why not? Since the first quarter of Game 1, a 36-22 period
that was their best of the playoffs, the Lakers have been outplayed,
outrun and outperformed.</TE>
<TE>   In the 11 quarters since, the Lakers have shot 38.9% from the
field and 24.2% from three-point range. They have averaged 22.7
points a quarter. Derek Fisher has shot 18.2% and Bryant 38.7%.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have shot 45.7%, including 41.2% from the arc, and have
been outscored in only four of the last 11 quarters. In three games,
they have attempted 28 more free throws than the Lakers. Somehow,

it is about their failures.</TE>

Horry said. "We know we shot the ball poorly. We did some things on
defense poorly. These are things that can be corrected. It's not like
there's nothing we can't correct."</TE>

<LD>Jeff Green held off hard-charging Greg Biffle on a last-lap duel
Saturday to win the Carquest Auto Parts 300 on a hot day at Lowe's
Motor Speedway at Concord, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   Green, who runs sporadically in the Busch series now that he's a
full-time Winston Cup driver, inherited the lead when teammate Jay
Sauter pitted.</LD>
<LD>   After eight cautions in the first 112 laps, the race had a long
green-flag stretch that allowed Sauter to open a 15-car length lead
on the field.</LD>
<TE>   But he didn't have enough gas to make it, and gave up the lead to
Green when he pitted.</TE>
<TE>   It looked like Green was going to run away with the race until Dan
Pardus spun out to bring out a yellow flag with eight laps to go.</TE>
<TE>   Biffle, running in second at the time, elected to pit and take
four tires. He came out in seventh and began his charge when the race
resumed with four laps to go.</TE>
<TE>   He was in second place in two laps, then closed the gap on Green
until he pulled alongside him on the outside of Turn 3 on the final
lap. But Green held him off to win this race for the second
consecutive year.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Riggs finished third, Mike McLaughlin was fourth and Todd
Bodine finished fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Pole winner Ron Hornaday and Dale Earnhardt Jr. were knocked out
of contention by crashes in the first half of the race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Juan Montoya won the pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix in his
Williams BMW, beating out David Coulthard on the final lap at Monte
Carlo, Monaco. The Colombian weaved through the winding streets of
picturesque and hilly Monte Carlo in 1 minute, 16.676 seconds in
Formula One's most prestigious race.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Schumacher, trying to match Aryton Senna's record of five
wins at Monaco, will start right behind Montoya on the second row
after a third-place time of 1:17.118 in his series-leading Ferrari.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Larry Dixon earned his sixth No. 1 qualifying position of the
season and 18th of his career in the NHRA Summer Nationals at Topeka,
Kan. Dixon had a quarter-mile run of 4.588 seconds at 320.81 mph to
lead the top fuel category.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Sarver topped the funny car category with a 4.862 pass at
304.39, and Jim Yates took his second consecutive top qualifying spot
with a pass of 6.853 at 200.20 in pro stock.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach's Rip Michels won the 75-lap Jani-King Super Late Model
series feature race in front of a near-capacity crowd of 5,920 at
Irwindale Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Michels, who had the top qualifying time of 18.086, started in the
sixth position but quickly moved up and took the lead from Deyon
Young on lap eight. Nathan Wulff and Brandon Loverock were second and
third and series point leader Tony Green finished fourth after
borrowing Loverock's backup car.</TE>
<TE>   In the Vista Paints Super Stock feature race, an accident on lap
19 involving five cars shortened the race from 40 laps to 30.
Julianne Seeley was hospitalized at Los Angeles County-USC as a
precaution after she was involved in the accident. At the restart,
Will Cotrell held off Andrew Phipps and Dan Fitzgerald for the
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Landreth won his first race of the season by holding off Ricky
Wildman in the 30-lap King Taco Legends feature race.</TE>

<LD>Monica Seles defeated Chanda Rubin, 6-4, 6-2, Saturday to win the
Madrid Open and claim her 53rd career singles title.</LD>
<LD>   Seles, ranked sixth, defeated the 65th-ranked Rubin in 1 hour 7
minutes. The second set lasted only 29 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Seles denied she plans to retire after the French Open, which
starts Monday.</LD>
<TE>   "It's been said that I was thinking about retiring this season,"
she said. "It was said after the Australian Open and it will be said
again after Roland Garros. But I will keep playing as long as I enjoy
myself on the courts. Maybe I'll stop this year, maybe not."</TE>

from dropping the first set to lead, 2-6, 6-3, 3-0. The injury puts
Safin's appearance in the French Open in doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Guillermo Canas trounced Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 6-4, 6-2, in the
second singles match to seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas Arnold and Gaston Etlis finished the sweep with a 6-4, 6-1

<HD>Wood Baffles Astros, Sosa Smashes Them</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once again, Kerry Wood dominated the Houston Astros.</LD>
<LD>   Wood pitched a four-hitter and Sammy Sosa hit his major
league-leading 18th home run, and the Chicago Cubs defeated the
Astros, 5-1, Saturday at Houston for their fifth consecutive victory.</LD>
<LD>   Wood improved to 5-0 with a 1.89 earned-run average in six career
starts against the Astros, including a 20-strikeout performance as a
rookie in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   Wood (5-3), who usually puts up high pitch counts, set down the
Astros with remarkable efficiency in his fifth career complete game.</TE>
<TE>   He walked none, struck out three and threw only 101 pitches. Wood
averaged nearly 13 strikeouts in his previous four complete games.</TE>
<TE>   "I just tried to be aggressive in the strike zone and go after
them," Wood said. "I was keeping my fastball down and the ones that I
did get up they didn't get a hold of and were flyballs. My breaking
ball wasn't good so I relied on my changeup a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Wood allowed only one runner to reach second base until the ninth
inning.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 13, Philadelphia 9--Jose Vidro hit a grand slam in the
bottom of the 10th inning, capping the Expos' final rally.</TE>
<TE>   Phillie newcomer Jeremy Giambi homered in his first two NL
at-bats, but Philadelphia blew a three-run lead in the eighth and a
one-run lead in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Vidro, who earlier had extended his hitting streak to a
major-league high 19 games, homered on the first pitch he saw from
left-hander Hector Mercado (1-1) with none out.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 6, Atlanta 4--Juan Encarnacion hit a three-run homer,
and Adam Dunn and Aaron Boone each hit solo homers at Atlanta, and
the Reds ended a two-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta starter Jason Marquis (3-3) retired the first 11 batters
before giving up three consecutive two-out hits in the fourth,
including Austin Kearns' run-scoring single that cut Atlanta's lead
to 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 6, Pittsburgh 3--Eli Marrero drove in four runs, and
Albert Pujols hit a two-run homer in the first inning at Pittsburgh
to help Woody Williams (2-0) win his seventh decision in a row dating
to last season.</TE>
<TE>   After a two-out walk to J.D. Drew, Pujols sent a pitch by Jimmy
Anderson an estimated 445 feet to left field.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 6, New York 5--Eric Owens hit a two-run triple against
David Weathers (2-1) in Florida's five-run seventh inning at New
York, and the Marlins took advantage of more sloppy fielding by the
Mets.</TE>
<TE>   After stranding 11 runners in the first six innings against Pedro
Astacio, the Marlins erased a 4-1 deficit in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets committed two errors in the inning--including one by Gold
Glove second baseman Roberto Alomar that allowed the tying run to
score--drawing loud boos from the crowd of 35,724. New York leads the
NL with 47 errors.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 2, San Diego 0--Ruben Quevedo (2-5) pitched a
three-hitter at Milwaukee for his first shutout in 41 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Hammonds hit a homer in the first inning and Richie Sexson
had a run-scoring single, and the Brewers handed the Padres their
fifth consecutive defeat.</TE>

<HD>Maple Leafs Can't Be Brushed Off</HD>
<DH>Eastern Conference: Carolina tries to rally in third
period, but Toronto hangs on for 1-0 win to force Game 6.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>There's something about the brink of elimination that has brought out
the best in the Toronto Maple Leafs this postseason.</LD>
<LD>   Darcy Tucker scored in the first period and Curtis Joseph turned
away 27 shots Saturday night as the Maple Leafs beat the Carolina
Hurricanes, 1-0, to stay alive in the Eastern Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   With assistant Rick Ley filling in for ailing Coach Pat Quinn,
Toronto ended Carolina's three-game winning streak and returns
Tuesday to the Air Canada Centre for Game 6 trailing 3-2 in the
best-of-seven series.</LD>
<TE>   "We've been through a lot as a group in these playoffs and it has
made us a lot stronger and a lot harder egg to crack," Tucker said.
"I'm very proud to play on a team like this. We have a long road
ahead, but we got one."</TE>
<TE>   If necessary, Game 7 would be Thursday night in North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth elimination game that the Leafs have won this
postseason. Toronto won Game 7 against the New York Islanders in the
first round and took Games 6 and 7 against Ottawa in the second
round.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been there before so I think this is the third, fourth time
our lives have been on the line," defenseman Bryan McCabe said.</TE>
<TE>   The Prince of Wales Trophy was in the arena, but Carolina couldn't
clinch its first trip to the Stanley Cup finals despite desperate
hockey in the third period. A shot by Rod Brind'Amour with 17.3
seconds could have tied it, but the puck hit the post and spun out of
the crease.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph notched his third shutout of this postseason and 15th of
his career.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn was released from a Toronto hospital earlier in the day when
his irregular heartbeat became normal, but doctors said it was too
risky for him to travel to North Carolina.</TE>

<HD>Sharp Avalanche Gets Even</HD>
<DH>Western Conference: Drury scores game-winner and Roy stops
31 shots as Colorado defeats Detroit, 3-2, to tie series at two games
apiece.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>After squandering seven leads against Detroit, the Colorado Avalanche
were finally able to build on one.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick Roy stopped 31 shots and Chris Drury scored late in the
third period as the Avalanche beat the Red Wings, 3-2, Saturday to
even the NHL Western Conference finals at two games apiece.</LD>
<LD>   Drury scored his fifth goal of the playoffs and second game-winner
of the series by one-timing a pass from Peter Forsberg over Dominik
Hasek's glove with 3:17 left.</LD>
<TE>   It marked Colorado's first two-goal lead since Game 4 against San
Jose in the conference semifinals and only the second lead the
defending Stanley Cup champions have held against Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Drury's game-winner in overtime of Game 2 was the only other
Colorado lead to stand.</TE>
<TE>   "We have given up so many leads, but today we did a better job,"
said Forsberg, who has at least one point in 11 of his last 12
playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we're learning, hopefully we're learning. It's going to be
a long series and if we're going to win, we have to be able to keep
the lead."</TE>
<TE>   Drury's goal proved vital, as Brett Hull made it 3-2 with 2.7
seconds left on a wrister from just outside the crease. Colorado won
the ensuing faceoff and Detroit wasn't able to get off a shot.</TE>
<TE>   Game 5 is Monday night in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we pressed right to the end," Detroit Coach Scotty
Bowman said. "I was very proud of our team today. You like to get the
results, but we played well. I know that's not good enough, but it's
always worse if you lose and play poorly."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Sakic, who had only two shots in Game 3, put Colorado up, 2-1,
45 seconds into the third period, beating Hasek stickside with a
wrister from the slot. Greg de Vries set up the goal, stealing a pass
from Chris Chelios near the center line.</TE>
<TE>   It was Sakic's ninth goal of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that when Sakic scored the goal at the start of the
third, they got more of the momentum after that," Detroit's Nicklas
Lidstrom said. "We couldn't really get it going like we did in the
first and second period."</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche vowed to play better defense in front of Roy after
he faced 42 shots in Game 3, a 2-1 loss in overtime, but that wasn't
the case early.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings peppered Roy with 16 shots in the first period,
including several from close range.</TE>
<TE>   But just like in Game 3, when he stopped 40 shots, Roy kept the
Avalanche in it.</TE>
<TE>   He stopped Boyd Devereaux on a one-timer from just outside the
crease early in the first, then a hard shot from the right circle by
Hull 30 seconds later.</TE>
<TE>   Roy also made a sliding stop with his chest on a shot by Tomas
Holmstrom on a Detroit power play in the second, and had a kick save
on a shot by Hull on a power play with four minutes left in the game.</TE>
<TE>   It was the 237th career playoff game for Roy, moving him past Mark
Messier for most in NHL history.</TE>
<TE>   "We came out a little flat," Colorado's Dan Hinote said. "Thank
God for Patty once again."</TE>

<HD>CAPE FEAR</HD>
<DH>Unless Shaq starts looking more like Superman and less like
he's worried about refs and feet, the Lakers are done</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal left Saturday's practice precisely as he had played
Friday's game.</LD>
<LD>   Through a side door, away from the crowd, no emotion, no answers.</LD>
<LD>   Inside, his teammates were wading through the media masses,
handling the heat.</LD>
<TE>   Outside, O'Neal was sliding into his car after giving a television
interview that lasted 54 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest man on the planet disappeared again, and now it's time
for a search party.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody needs to find that mortal once bold enough to believe he
was able to leap tall buildings in a single rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody needs to bring back that giant once filled with enough
joyous energy to break rims and break dance.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody needs to uncover those broad shoulders once capable of
carrying an entire city down the middle of Figueroa in the middle of
June.</TE>
<TE>   And somebody needs to lose that fool from Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   You remember. He opened his mouth and the game was over.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Lakers' 103-90 loss to the Sacramento Kings in Game 3
of the Western Conference finals, O'Neal asked not to be thrown the
ball early because he wanted to get comfortable and read the
referees.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Go away'" Phil Jackson recounted after the game.</TE>
<TE>   Go away? O'Neal said that?</TE>
<TE>   Could Jackson have heard it wrong?</TE>
<TE>   The Shaquille O'Neal from the previous two springs never would
have asked his teammates to ignore him during a first quarter that
was so critical to the Lakers' championship hopes.</TE>
<TE>   That O'Neal wouldn't have said, "Go away."</TE>
<TE>   He would have said, "Come here."</TE>
<TE>   He would have said, "Climb aboard."</TE>
<TE>   That O'Neal would have taken more than four shots during a first
quarter in which his team was outscored, 32-15. He wouldn't have let
Vlade Divac and Scot Pollard push him around like a Burger King
cutout. He wouldn't have had five times as many turnovers as blocked
shots.</TE>
<TE>   It is assumed that, facing today's even more critical Game 4 at
Staples Center, the Lakers are trailing two games to one because the
former pushover Kings are a different team.</TE>
<TE>   But they are trailing because O'Neal is a different player.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in the Jackson era, Superman is no longer
guaranteed to come when called.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the playoffs, Jackson addressed the issue by having
what the coach termed a "heated discussion" with his star.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, he obviously decided to send the message in a different
manner, revealing O'Neal's request in the same fashion that he once
revealed Scottie Pippen's request to be taken out of a playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   This is obviously not the same thing. O'Neal has never quit on his
team, and will retire as the most dominant big man in history.</TE>
<TE>   But something is clearly wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be great if we could see Shaq running around again,
being Superman, pulling his antics," Rick Fox said. "It would be
great to see Shaq being Shaq."</TE>
<TE>   Injuries are part of what has made him different, but even O'Neal
says that injuries are no excuse. Eighty percent of him is better
than 100% of any other center in the league.</TE>
<TE>   It is more about attitude. The guy renowned for his productive
passion has become more like the guy renowned for taking a swing at
the back of Brad Miller's head. The guy known for his happiness is
now recognized by his anger.</TE>
<TE>   He is angry with opponents for what he perceives are increasingly
cheap shots. He is angry with the league for failing to protect him.
He is angry with the media for not writing about it.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I feel you guys insult me by not writing what you see,"
O'Neal said last week. "If the league continues in this state, I'll
be ashamed to play in the league."</TE>
<TE>   Teammates are guessing that it is this anger that has affected
O'Neal like no two-bit punk opposing center could. It is this anger,
they say, that has changed his game.</TE>
<TE>   "Because he's worried about officiating, sometimes you can see him
go for his jump hook more than his power game," Robert Horry said.
"Sometimes, you just have to forget that. Sometimes, you need to just
go do it. The referees are not going to let those flops go on all the
time."</TE>
<TE>   Teammates would like to see O'Neal get the ball lower, move
stronger, worry less.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq is concerned that by making his moves and being aggressive,
he's not going to the basket like he's gone for the last 10 years,"
Rick Fox said. "You can't play that way. We just have to do the
things we do, and let it all sort itself out."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, in the deciding first-round Game 5 here against the
Kings, everyone in the standing and screaming crowd knew that the
first pass of the game was going to O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone knew he would take it on the low left block.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone knew he would spin over Divac and score.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal did, and the Lakers never trailed while taking the first
step toward their first championship of this era.</TE>
<TE>   Another such difficult step awaits today. For all the talk about
Kobe Bryant's health, Derek Fisher's quickness and Fox and Horry's
shooting, that step can only be taken by one pair of size-22 shoes.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers can win with them. The Lakers can drown in them.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's over. It was a nice run while it lasted, and I'm sure it's going
to be painful to watch the NBA Finals without any real rooting
interest.</LD>
<LD>   But I'm sure the yokels who live in Sacramento will get over it.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   I LOOK for the Lakers to win the next three games, and maybe not
lose again before the parade.</TE>
<TE>   The trip to the local Dairy Queen will have to suffice as the
highlight of the year for those sentenced to life in Sacramento, and
the Chamber of Commerce tells me the temperature tops 90 degrees 80
days a year in the capital city, so eat quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Today, of course, the yokels are still feeling pretty good.
They've watched their team win two playoff games, they figure ringing
cowbells are good for two more, and they've read Hemingway, a.k.a.
columnist Rick Majerus, who is on the verge of calling Sacramento
"Titletown."</TE>
<TE>   On the radio Bill Walton was saying, "How about my Sacramento
Kings?" and "L.A. is stunned."</TE>
<TE>   I don't blame L.A. for being stunned; I had no idea Majerus could
write either. He's probably the second-best columnist at the paper
right now.</TE>
<TE>   But the thing is, I don't think anything has happened so far that
we haven't seen before. I'm not going to get worried until Phil
Jackson stands up. The Lakers are the same team capable of losing to
the Chicago Bulls twice in a season as the one that can seemingly
turn it on when it wants. By the way, now might be a good time to do
that.</TE>
<TE>   I have no doubt that's about to happen.</TE>
<TE>   You see, I think Kobe Bryant is one of those special athletes who
come along once in a lifetime, and every time someone sparks the
competitive fire that burns deep in his game, greatness seems to
emerge.</TE>
<TE>   When everyone else is talking in hushed tones, and Plaschke is
asking doom-and-gloom questions, Kobe is the first one to say the fun
is just beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes after the Lakers lost to San Antonio in the last round,
Kobe pointed to the next two games in Texas and said he was excited.
Then he dropped in 59 points in two wins over the Spurs. I'm
beginning to feel sorry for the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "This is when you have the most fun," he said Saturday. "There is
no anxiety whatsoever. As an athlete, this is what motivates me."</TE>
<TE>   I'd like it better if he became motivated without the Lakers
having to be clobbered first, but that's a project for another day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW AS you know, I made Babe Ruth out of Shawn Green. My periodic
"It's time to produce" chats with Eric Karros, Jason Allison and Tim
Salmon obviously brought out the best in those stiffs. Too bad Bum
Garner didn't consult with me before his TV show was canceled.</TE>
<TE>   I know now I can't wait to be asked. That's why I made the special
trip Saturday to the Lakers' practice facility, and then turned the
car toward Edison Field. So many people to help. I had to make a
decision; I skipped the Sparks' game.</TE>
<TE>   I told Angel pitcher Jarrod Washburn Saturday night if he pitched
well, I'd get him high in this story. He had a no-hitter going in the
fifth inning and was in the first paragraph. He then let the Twins
score two runs, which dropped him lower than Bum Garner. The Twins
scored again. I hope he doesn't get canceled too.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, of course, I have to get tough. A month ago I chastised
Kobe in a column for his horrendous three-point shooting (.250)
during the regular season, and noted he couldn't shoot better than my
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, when someone asked him, "What's the difference in your
game from the last two championship runs and your performance
currently in the playoffs?" he grinned and said, "My three-point
shooting."</TE>
<TE>   After 11 playoff games and being told he couldn't shoot better
than a girl, he's making .341 of his three-point attempts, and as I
reminded him Saturday, he still couldn't beat my daughter, who made
138 three-pointers as a junior in high school.</TE>
<TE>   "Put some money on it," he said, and I told him she'll shoot
against him to benefit a charity--The Grocery Store Bagger Wedding
Fund--when the season is over, "and she'll kick your butt."</TE>
<TE>   But first things first, and that's getting the best out of Kobe
for the Lakers' benefit. I reminded him he talks about having fun,
but I didn't detect any of that in his play Friday night. There was
no zest to his game.</TE>
<TE>   I saw him clowning around with Shaquille O'Neal as practice
wrapped up Saturday, and that was a good sign, but in case he wasn't
getting the message, I officially ordered him to have fun in today's
game. If Kobe is having fun, it will rub off on Shaq, and the two
best players in the game will dominate.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe nodded, and said, "Shawn Green had four homers, didn't he?"
So he knows if he listens to the pep talk, good things will happen
for the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to have fun, I promise you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If only he could shoot three-pointers better. I'm not so sure the
Grocery Store Bagger isn't a better three-point shooter than Kobe.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SCOTT SPIEZIO and his wife had a baby last week, and named him
Cody Scott. I asked Spiezio if they had given any thought to naming
the child "T.J."</TE>
<TE>   "No thought whatsoever," Spiezio said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Dave Swofford:</TE>
<TE>   "I am an editor at The WB, and I take exception to your comment
about 'Felicity.' She has all the human qualities you lack. Since you
missed the series finale, you will never know if she ended up with
Ben or Noel, and I'm not telling."</TE>
<TE>   I've seen Felicity before. I've got to believe Ben ended up with
Noel.</TE>

<LD>   The reality was a little more harsh. Instead, he became the most
derided great player of his time.</LD>
<TE>   Skepticism is almost universal, be it about his game, which is
held to be soft ("He's missing something," an assistant coach said
during a recent series), or his styling ("Don't let the game get in
the way of the show," NBC's Bill Walton noted during this series).</TE>
<TE>   Then there are his facial expressions. Or as Dallas Maverick owner
Mark Cuban said before unleashing a cowbell siege of the Kings in the
last series:</TE>
<TE>   "If you see Chris Webber with that I-look-like-I'm-going-to-cry
look on his face, you'll know it's doing its job. Either that or Tyra
is walking off with Chris Tucker or somebody."</TE>
<TE>   Oh yeah, Webber's relationship with supermodel Tyra Banks doesn't
seem to be off limits, either.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, after that, Webber proceeded to average 27 points and
10 rebounds in the next three against the Mavericks, all of which the
Kings won ... and 25 points, 12 rebounds, 5.7 assists and two blocks
in this series, which the Kings lead, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   This flawed, preening crybaby has started the last two All-Star
games, finished No. 4 and 7 in the last two MVP races and is a
regular on the all-interview team, but when things go wrong, he never
has to ask for whom the hammer is poised.</TE>
<TE>   His Kings, who'd been in the playoffs once in 12 years before
Webber arrived in 1999 and hadn't advanced since 1981, have made
giant strides, tying their franchise record with 55 wins (set in
Cincinnati with Oscar Robertson and Jerry Lucas), then breaking it
with 61.</TE>
<TE>   For Webber, it's not enough. In a typical reaction after they lost
Game 1 of the conference finals, he was blasted in this newspaper
("Tin Man"), the Washington Times ("Webber shows the referees his
medical charts and X-rays, plus the findings of the human rights
organizations monitoring the abuses being perpetrated against him.
None of it matters. It is a cold world.") and the Santa Rosa Press
Democrat ("With Webber playing like pauper, Kings done").</TE>
<TE>   Webber had scored 28 points with 14 rebounds and six assists, so
one shudders to think what would have awaited him if he had actually
played badly.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, stuff started happening to him long before he got to
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   There was the timeout at Michigan, the Don Nelson feud at Golden
State and the dream-gone-wrong in Washington before the trade that
exiled him far from the bright lights.</TE>
<TE>   Just to name a few.</TE>
<TE>   Why has all this happened to him? Even he wonders about that.</TE>
<TE>   "'Cause I was young," he said recently. "'Cause I live with my
heart....</TE>
<TE>   "This is a man's world and when you come in as a young guy, you've
got to learn the rules.... Because one thing I do, I make mistakes,
but I know I learn from them. Because I hate to repeat the same
situation. And making your mother upset, to me, is the hardest."</TE>
<TE>   Happily, Doris Webber, who taught at Detroit's Mumford High, where
students entered through metal detectors, understands there are worse
problems and seems to recover quickly. In this family, you have to be
able to endure a rough headline or two.</TE>
<TE>   Because another thing Webber does is set himself up, time after
time.</TE>
<TE>   He wants out of Sacramento (no soul food places), he drops hints
from there to New York (where, he notes, he keeps a place) ... oops,
he's staying.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about living with your heart. There's so much he wants to do,
there's all the attention he hasn't gotten yet and pines for, and
there always seems to be a maddening array of options.</TE>
<TE>   He has a perfectly reasonable explanation for whatever he's doing
at the time, even if you'd have to be a blood relative to take him at
his word all the time.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, he's still moving up. Anyone who doesn't like
the way he's doing it can take a number and get in line.</TE>
<TE>   The Master of Disaster</TE>
<TE>   In this league, even multimillionaires get the blues. In other
sports, stars aren't necessarily regarded as tainted if they don't
win championships. Ted Williams was an icon, despite appearing in one
World Series, which the Red Sox lost. Ernie Banks, Mr. Cub, never got
close to a World Series.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA is not only star-driven but celebrity-driven. Thus, Webber
has a higher profile, more endorsements and commercials than an
equivalent baseball star, say, Alex Rodriguez. However, with the
exposure comes the expectations. And, in the shorthand of the sports
section, "hasn't won" becomes "can't win," which turns into "could
never win."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the process would mean more if it wasn't torching
players one day and knighting them the next.</TE>
<TE>   Before Webber, the most sneered-at star was Shaquille O'Neal,
derided as a starstruck rapper/actor wannabe. His Laker misadventures
were met with particular scorn; when they would be eliminated from
the playoffs, his quote about having won "at every level except
college and the pros" would be cited hourly on "SportsCenter."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is it only a harsh media or disappointed fans. In 1999, after
the San Antonio Spurs won the NBA title, several GMs were asked which
player they'd pick to start a team around. All took Tim Duncan over
O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Two years and two titles later, Shaq is an NBA demigod,
acknowledged far and wide to be without a peer.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal did little to bring the heat down on himself. He came in
quiet and respectful toward his elders, until the veterans started to
show they resented the hype around him, as in his second All-Star
game, when the West squad jumped him en masse.</TE>
<TE>   He was just Shaq, a natural lightning rod. That was enough.</TE>
<TE>   Webber, on the other hand, had a genius for getting himself
noticed, in trouble or both.</TE>
<TE>   He was the marquee name on one of the most celebrated college
teams ever, Michigan's Fab Five, the star of the all-freshman lineup
that was as brash as it was precocious.</TE>
<TE>   If the Fabs didn't herald the arrival of Generation X all by
themselves, they were a watershed. When they decided to start a new
fashion of black sneakers and socks, they just put them on and went
out for the game, neglecting to inform Coach Steve Fisher. Kids
thrilled to their exploits as they lost in the NCAA final twice, the
second time when Webber called that timeout they didn't have.</TE>
<TE>   The good news was, in the context of his career, that one would
soon look like a mistake anyone could make.</TE>
<TE>   Acquired by Golden State in a draft-day trade in 1993, looking
like the centerpiece of a rising power, he forced a trade a year
later in a snit with Nelson, the Warriors' coach. Nelson was beloved
by his veterans but rough on young players and Webber didn't like
being yelled at.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for all involved, the deal--Webber to Washington for
Tom Gugliotta--laid both franchises low, along with the reputations
of both Webber and Nelson. Webber was a coach-killer. Nelson's team
fell apart and he resigned at midseason.</TE>
<TE>   Washington was a four-year disappointment for Webber, and vice
versa. The Bullets/Wizards underachieved, partied heartily and wound
up on police blotters a lot, even for young basketball players.</TE>
<TE>   Management was so exasperated, it finally traded Webber, then 25,
for Mitch Richmond, a guard who was 33.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Webber had any intention of playing in the middle of
nowhere any longer than he had to. Two seasons later, as he
approached free agency, there were few teams that didn't dream of
landing him and few scenarios he discouraged.</TE>
<TE>   There was even a Web site, the World Wide Webber watch, tracking
developments through the headlines:</TE>
<TE>   Aug. 8, 2000, Sacramento Bee: Webber: I want to play for (insert
city here).</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 3, 2000, New York Post: Webber is the missing piece.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 5, 2000, New York Daily News: [Latrell] Sprewell faces
league's ire over trying to snare Webber.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 3, 2000, New York Times: Webber favors Knicks, former agent
says.</TE>
<TE>   Jan 14, 2001 Houston Chronicle: Webber's Houston ties run deep.</TE>
<TE>   Jan 16, 2001 Fort Worth Star-Telegram: Webber to Mavericks?</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 8, 2001, Detroit News: Webber would be wise to be nice to
Pistons.</TE>
<TE>   Mar. 13, 2001 Orlando Sentinel: Webber to Orlando? It's food for
thought.</TE>
<TE>   Mar. 15, 2001, Miami Herald: Webber confirms interest in Heat.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings insisted everything was OK, even as their owners courted
Webber with a billboard plea on his way home ... and Webber said he
didn't like it ... and the owners then took it down.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, it's not surprising they fell out of the playoffs
so swiftly. It was surprising they lasted that long.</TE>
<TE>   It's Not Easy Being Purple</TE>
<TE>   It's an underdog's life.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, Webber is a King for good, or six more years,
the time remaining on his $123-million contract. (Well, let's make
that at least four more years; he has an opt-out in 2006.)</TE>
<TE>   Who'd have thunk it?</TE>
<TE>   Not him.</TE>
<TE>   When the Kings acquired him, Webber tried to force a trade to the
Lakers, who were offering Eddie Jones. King General Manager Geoff
Petrie sat tight, leaving Webber, who had two years left on his old
contract, no choice but to report.</TE>
<TE>   The next spring, when the teams met in the first round, Webber was
still acknowledging his disappointment at not being a Laker. ("I just
wanted to be there for the big fella. I try not to think about it
because it can't do anything but make me depressed.")</TE>
<TE>   A year later, he went onto the market, only to find a narrow range
of options and, like Dorothy, concluded there was no place like home,
no matter how small.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to [be a Laker] really bad," Webber says. "And Geoff
Petrie basically said, no, it's not going to happen. He said, 'I'm
going to build a team here that you can win a championship with.' I
didn't believe him, didn't want to believe him, didn't want to get to
know him the first year I was here....</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at this situation--I've played with a lot of great
players ... from Chris Mullin to Rasheed Wallace, some great guys,
and I've never been on a team this good. And it took God to bring me
to Sacramento, to the worst team in the world that nobody wanted to
play on, to be in this position.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I really hold this situation dear to my heart.
Regardless of the outcome, we're going out fighting and we're not
afraid.... Regardless of what credit people give us or what they say,
we're just going to keep playing because we came from nothing."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, he looks more comfortable 18 feet from the basket than
underneath it, but unlike his Washington days, he can make shots from
there.</TE>
<TE>   Given his playmaking ability, the Kings run their offense through
him up there and he goes inside too. Because they are first or second
in scoring every season, and are widely praised as the NBA's best
passing team, it's hard to say it doesn't work.</TE>
<TE>   Webber is wiser, although he hasn't lost his gift of gaffe, as
when he heatedly protested a Bee story about his relationship with
Banks--on camera--blowing it into a story 100 times bigger.</TE>
<TE>   Well, he's still only 29.</TE>
<TE>   "I think one reason I have been in trouble in my life is trying to
fight every fight," he says. "Even the situation with Coach Nelson, I
don't think people realize that it all started off of me standing up
for [teammate] Chris Gatling....</TE>
<TE>   "And now, maybe you would go in the back and say, 'Coach, please
don't, we need him ready and every time you get on him, he's not
ready for the game.'</TE>
<TE>   "I do believe there's a responsibility with everything I'm given.
You know, you've just got to spend your time figuring it out, growing
up and making mistakes. And unfortunately for me, I made my mistakes
in front of a lot of people....</TE>
<TE>   "You know, everybody's got to take responsibility for what they
did, but a lot of it too was ... I was 20 years old [as a rookie]. My
coach got fired. I think that was just boom, the onslaught. Along
with me keeping making mistakes. They always had something to point
back to. So it's been tough."</TE>
<TE>   Nor will it stop being tough, with his constant yearning for a
title, which is matched by the yearning of his new home. That means
getting past the Lakers with their double-superstar configuration,
which trumps the teams that only have only one.</TE>
<TE>   It's a typical spring in this no-reputation-left-standing world,
with heroes dropping left and right as their teams go on vacation.
Now Kevin Garnett is deemed too unselfish. Dirk Nowitzki has been
exposed as a black hole on offense and so bad at the other end, the
joke is his name should be "Irk," without the D. Karl Malone is over
the hill, as usual. Rasheed Wallace is still Rasheed Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   They're only warmup acts for Webber. This is his time, one way or
the other.</TE>

<LD>Preparation for a pro beach volleyball tournament used to mean
staying out until dawn the previous night, rolling out of bed a
couple hours later and arriving a few minutes before first serve.</LD>
<LD>   Not anymore.</LD>
<LD>   Stein Metzger and Kevin Wong, the top-seeded men's team at the
Huntington Beach Open, listen to success visualization tapes, consult
with a sports psychologist and, when necessary, call a "team meeting"
to tackle any differences.</LD>
<TE>   "We definitely take it more seriously than they did back in the
day," Metzger said.</TE>
<TE>   It appears to be working. Metzger and Wong won three matches
Saturday, including a 21-13, 21-12 victory over Karch Kiraly and
Brent Doble in a winners' bracket quarterfinal, in the season-opening
Assn. of Volleyball Professionals tournament at Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   It was a solid start to what had been a hectic week for Metzger
and Wong, former teammates at UCLA and Honolulu Punahou High.</TE>
<TE>   They made an appearance Thursday morning on "The Today Show" and,
after flying to L.A. that afternoon from New York, went from LAX to
practice at Hermosa Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "It was ugly," Wong said. "We were tired. We had been up since 5
a.m., 2 a.m. Los Angeles time, for the show. We went at each other a
little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Metzger called a team meeting Friday night to clear the air.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked things out," Wong said.</TE>
<TE>   Metzger and Wong will play Mike Whitmarsh and Canyon Ceman in a
winners' semifinal today.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Fonoimoana and Dax Holdren, one of several teams playing
together for the first time, looked strong in a 21-15, 21-14
quarterfinal victory over Scott Ayakatubby and Brian Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Fonoimoana struggled last year after winning a gold medal with
Dain Blanton at the Sydney Olympics, but looked at ease with Holdren.</TE>
<TE>   Fonoimoana and Holdren play Todd Rogers and Sean Scott in a
winners' semifinal today. Kiraly and Doble are still alive in the
double-elimination tournament and will play Jeff Nygaard and Albert
Hannemann in the contenders' bracket.</TE>
<TE>   The top-seeded women's team, Holly McPeak and Elaine Youngs, swept
two trouble-free matches. McPeak and Youngs had never competed
together until Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   McPeak and Youngs will play Nancy Mason and Wendy Stammer in a
winners' semifinal today. Dianne DeNecochea and Barbra Fontana will
play Carrie Busch and Leanne Schuster in the other semifinal.</TE>

<LD>Erica Beach limited UCLA to six hits and Arizona State knocked the
Bruins out of the NCAA Women's College World Series with a 2-1
victory Saturday night at Don Porter Hall of Fame Stadium in Oklahoma
City.</LD>
<LD>   It is a stunning result for the Bruins (55-9), who began the
championships as the nation's top-ranked team. UCLA had reached the
last three NCAA title games.</LD>
<LD>   Beach gave the Bruins' struggling offense fits with an assortment
of off-speed pitches. She struck out only one but consistently got
ahead of hitters and got 13 groundball outs.</LD>
<TE>   To win its ninth NCAA title, UCLA had to go through the loser's
bracket after a shocking opening-game 2-1 loss to Florida State on
Thursday. The Bruins did stave off elimination earlier Saturday as
Keira Goerl threw a one-hitter in a 2-0 victory over Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Freed started the second game and ran into trouble in the
third inning. With two out, Kristin Farber reached on an infield hit
and Kara Brun singled to left. Phelan Wright then doubled down the
right-field line to score Farber.</TE>
<TE>   After an intentional walk to Beach to load the bases, Missy Hixon
grounded a single under shortstop Natasha Watley's glove for a 2-0
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Stacey Nuveman, who homered in the Oklahoma victory, doubled in
Freed in the sixth. But the Bruins failed to score with two runners
on in the sixth and the tying run on at third in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Devils (46-19) will play California today. They must
defeat the Golden Bears twice to advance to Monday's championship
game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Peavey, Brian Barre, Joey Metropolous and Michael Moon hit
home runs, and USC (33-22, 16-7) clinched a share of the Pacific 10
Conference baseball title with a 16-10 victory over UCLA in front of
1,243 at Jackie Robinson Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's Adam Berry hit a grand slam in the fifth to tie the score,
7-7. But the Trojans broke it open with a six-run sixth inning,
powered by a three-run homer by Peavey and a two-run drive by Moon.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Coast Conference, Rock Mills hit two home runs and
tied a career high with five runs batted in, and Pepperdine (31-31)
defeated San Diego, 15-4, to even the best-of-three championship
series at Pepperdine.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Duncan of Cal State Los Angeles became the fourth person in
any division to win NCAA titles in the 100 meters, 200 meters and
long jump events at the Division II track and field championships at
San Angelo, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan won the 100 meters in 11.40 to beat Cal State Dominguez
Hills' Carmelitta Jeter. She won the 200 in 23.49 seconds and took
the long jump with a leap of 20 feet 103/4 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Bakersfield's April Burton won the women's discus with a
throw of 177-9.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gabriela Lastra and Lauren Kalvaria of Stanford defeated UCLA's
Megan Bradley and Lauren Fisher, 6-2, 6-3, to win the NCAA women's
doubles title at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nick Rainey of USC saw his run in the NCAA men's singles
championships end in a 7-5, 6-2 loss to top-seeded Matias Boeker of
Georgia in the quarterfinals at College Station, Texas.</TE>

<LD>John Ward hopes this visit to Hollywood Park is more rewarding than
his last.</LD>
<LD>   The trainer has brought Snow Dance west for the $500,000 Gamely
Breeders' Cup Handicap on Monday, only the second time he has shipped
to this part of the country.</LD>
<LD>   In 1997, Ward saw Beautiful Pleasure finish 10th at 7-1 in the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, although she went on to later
success. In 1999, Beautiful Pleasure won the Breeders' Cup Distaff en
route to the Eclipse award as the nation's top older female.</LD>
<TE>   Best known for winning the 2001 Kentucky Derby with Monarchos,
Ward, 56, has a longshot chance with Snow Dance in the 36th Gamely,
which is a Grade I race.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by John Oxley, Snow Dance, a 4-year-old gray daughter of
Forest Wildcat, is used to being on the road. A winner of seven of 13
in her career, she has finished worse than third only once and has
been especially productive on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   She has won six of nine on the grass at four different
tracks--Churchill Downs, Saratoga, Arlington Park and Gulfstream.</TE>
<TE>   If Snow Dance, who was purchased for $220,000 as a yearling in
1999, is to make her trip from Lexington to Inglewood a complete
success, she will have to defeat a quality group.</TE>
<TE>   Among those running are defending champion Astra; Starine, who
ended 2001 with a victory in the Matriarch at Hollywood Park; and
Voodoo Dancer, a multiple graded-stakes winner for trainer Christophe
Clement.</TE>
<TE>   A winner of three of four at 1 1/8 miles, the Gamely distance,
Snow Dance, who will be ridden by Craig Perret, could have a tactical
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   None of the prime contenders are front-runners, so she could find
herself on the lead setting slow fractions. After that, it's only a
question of whether she is good enough.</TE>
<TE>   One reason Ward decided on the Gamely was Snow Dance's weight
assignment. She was given 118 pounds, five less than she would have
had to carry in the $125,000 Gallorette Handicap at Pimlico eight
days ago.</TE>
<TE>   Feeling his horses fit better on the deeper tracks back east, Ward
has been reluctant to come to California in the past, but his
mind-set could be changing.</TE>
<TE>   "We could be doing more out there in the future," he said. "We're
kind of testing the waters. We'll put our toe in the water this
weekend and see how it is."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Azeri provided even more evidence she is the best older dirt filly
or mare in the country with a virtual--and easy--wire-to-wire victory
in the $211,400 Milady Breeders' Cup Handicap on Saturday at
Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   The 3-5 favorite won her third Grade I in a row and has now won
six of seven lifetime starts. Azeri--the 4-year-old Jade Hunter filly
who is owned by the family of the late Allen Paulson, trained by
Laura De Seroux and ridden by Mike Smith--won by 3 1/2 lengths and
completed the 1 1/16 miles in 1:42.</TE>
<TE>   Affluent, the 5-2 second choice, was second, the third consecutive
race in which she has finished behind Azeri, then came Collect Call,
Elaine's Angel and Ask Me No Secrets.</TE>
<TE>   The Milady was marred by the fatal breakdown of 9-1 fourth choice
Cashmina. The 4-year-old Cherokee Run filly went wrong down the
backstretch and had to be euthanized after suffering multiple
injuries to her right front leg.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said of the winner, "She just galloped. She is amazing.
Words can't describe her. She's done everything that's been asked of
her. She is just so special."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Before a three-stakes bonanza on Monday, Hollywood Park will be
relatively quiet this afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   With the California Sire Stakes having been postponed for a few
days because only four 3-year-olds were entered Friday morning, the
only stakes on the card is the $65,000 Willard L. Proctor Memorial at
five furlongs.</LD>
<LD>   The first added-money race of the local season for 2-year-old
males, the Proctor attracted eight entrants, including a three-horse
entry trained by Jerry Dutton.</LD>
<TE>   Dutton, who won the Cinderella Stakes for 2-year-old fillies
earlier in the month with Global Finance, is scheduled to run winners
Fabulous World and Goodbye Earl and maiden Skipping Stars.</TE>
<TE>   The likely favorite in the ungraded race is Expression, a
California-bred son of In Excess who won on May 8 after finishing
third in his debut on April 27. He is trained by Jean-Pierre Dupuis
for a partnership and will be ridden by Brice Blanc.</TE>
<TE>   Other top contenders include Crowned Dancer, who was second to
Expression in his debut for trainer Chris Paasch, and Royal Place,
who won at first asking for trainer Dave La Croix on May 1.</TE>
<TE>   Two races before the Proctor, Innit, the winner of the Honeymoon
Handicap last July 1 on the Hollywood Park turf course, will make her
first start since Aug. 18 against only four opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Ron McAnally for owner Richard Duchossois, Innit will
be ridden by Chris McCarron. Gabriellina Giof, who is also trained by
McAnally, Canzone, Garden in the Rain and Terna complete the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Lost At Sea, Ayzal and A B Noodle head the field
for the $55,000 Bay Meadows Oaks today at Bay Meadows. The 1
1/16-mile turf affair is the third race on the card.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Aggressive. The 5-year-old gelding will try for his
fourth consecutive victory in his first race on the turf in today's
fifth at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Futural. Like Azillion, the 6-year-old gelding clearly
has seen better days. He finished last in Friday night's seventh at
Hollywood Park. Unlike Azillion, he has actually won some races in
this country--seven, to be exact.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: Late doubles from Kappa King in the eighth to
Cee's Dude, California Lite and Wild Success.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/61. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $8.40/$350.80. Total money bet: $412.</TE>

<HD>Divac Says Balance of Power Is Key</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Six of the seven Sacramento Kings who played during their 103-90
victory Friday over the Lakers in Game 3 of the Western Conference
final scored 11 points or more. Six of the seven played 24 minutes or
more.</LD>
<LD>   Center Vlade Divac wasn't Sacramento's best player, but he did
score 11 points and had nine rebounds in 38 minutes. He also helped
the Kings thwart Shaquille O'Neal, who had 20 points and 19 rebounds,
and gave them a 2-1 series lead.</LD>
<LD>   Divac then stood atop a figurative soap box in the Kings' locker
room, speaking out on a variety of subjects, including the perception
that the Kings are unloved and unappreciated outside of the
Sacramento city limits.</LD>
<TE>   "We get no respect," Divac said. "We're going to earn the respect
tonight. Or tomorrow. We'll get there. I've played this game a long
time and you don't have that many opportunities to get here and when
you do, you better do it."</TE>
<TE>   Comparing the Kings and the Lakers, Divac said, "This team is a
team. The other team is Shaq and Kobe [Bryant]. They're the two best
players in the world, but we have better talent as a team. All I'm
saying is if they [the Lakers] don't have one of those two they're
going to be in trouble. This team lost Peja [Stojakovic to a sprained
right ankle], but somebody always steps up."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking about a third-period scuffle with Bryant that resulted in
technical fouls for each player, Divac said, "He hit me in the face."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if it was intentional, he added, "Come on, he hit me right
in the face. The ref was standing right there. When you're losing
you'll try to do anything to get back in the game, but I don't know
if I would do that."</TE>
<TE>   Of withstanding the Lakers' furious comeback in the fourth
quarter, Divac said, "Basketball happens so fast. But we just didn't
panic. We called a timeout. We wanted to get some shots. We didn't
feel comfortable [so the Kings asked for a timeout]. We wanted to see
where we were making mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about defending O'Neal, Divac said, "It's hard to say what
we did, but, obviously, it worked. We're going to watch the film and
see what we did. I didn't do it. I was behind him. He just missed
shots."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As in their conference semifinal victory over the San Antonio
Spurs, when Tony Parker ran amok, the Lakers are having difficulty
defending the Kings' smaller and faster guards.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Sacramento point guard Mike Bibby picked apart the
Lakers in Game 3, scoring 24 points on eight-for-14 shooting. He also
had five assists and four rebounds. He averaged 13.7 points during
the regular season, but is up to 21 points during three playoff games
against the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep saying this and keep repeating myself after every game the
guy plays," Sacramento Coach Rick Adelman said. "What he's done in
the playoffs is really assert himself. He makes a huge basket when
the team is down. That's Mike."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adelman gave the Kings a day off from practice Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Blindness Doesn't Slow Down Wills</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINA TELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sharlene Wills loved to run in open fields as a child. It was one
time she didn't think about being blind.</LD>
<LD>   "There are no obstacles. It's wonderful to run free with no
tether, no dog--just by yourself," Wills said. "It just lets you
suddenly forget that you can't see."</LD>
<LD>   Wills, 54, who has been blind since birth, never lost that
childhood passion, only now she competes in races ranging from 5Ks to
longer distances--she has completed 29 marathons. She competes in the
2002 Pfizer Flo-Jo Memorial Half Marathon and 5K Monday in Laguna
Hills. Her goal is to finish the half marathon in less than three
hours.</LD>
<TE>   Typically, Wills, who works for the Los Angeles District
Attorney's office, runs with her guide dog, Shyla. But at her left
side Monday will be Jonathan Geller, a sighted guide she met through
the L.A. Achilles Track Club, founded in New York in 1983 to assist
runners with disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   The two will be connected by a two-inch tether, which each holds
with one hand. That's about the only sign of Wills' disability.</TE>
<TE>   "Because she fits in so well, you don't see what she's overcoming.
She doesn't stand out," said Marie Murphy, who coaches Wills for the
L.A. Leggers Track Club. "When we do wind sprints to warm up, she's
ahead of everyone else. You see her coming down with [her guide] dog
and still bio-mechanically control herself so well. She's very much
an athlete.... She has a runner's form."</TE>
<TE>   Though Wills will also compete in the Brentwood 10K today, her
focus is on a bigger challenge--the Pikes Peak Marathon Aug. 18. The
run is a grueling race that must be completed in less than 10 hours.
She might not finish in time, but she isn't shying away from the
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharlene is a positive, energetic, fearless human being," said
Jon Ross, head coach and organizer of the Los Angeles area Achilles
Track Club. "She drives herself very hard to achieve her goals.</TE>
<TE>   "When I heard a blind person was scaling Everest, my first thought
was it might be Sharlene."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Elton Brand of the Clippers and Ben Wallace of the Detroit Pistons
were selected to fill the final two roster spots for the United
States team that will compete in the World Championships this summer.</LD>
<LD>   The choice of the power forwards reflected the concern of the
American team that it needed size to enhance its chances of winning
the tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Brand, a tenacious rebounder, will provide scoring punch from the
low post. Wallace is not known for scoring but led the NBA in
rebounding and blocked shots.</LD>
<TE>   The selections were made Thursday by the USA Basketball Selection
committee but have not been announced publicly. Two executives with
knowledge of the committee's choices, speaking on condition of
anonymity, confirmed the selections to the Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Players who have already been selected to play for the United
States in the tournament, scheduled for Aug. 29-Sept. 8 in
Indianapolis, are Jason Kidd, Ray Allen, Reggie Miller, Michael
Finley, Shawn Marion, Antonio Davis, Jermaine O'Neal, Paul Pierce,
Raef LaFrentz and Andre Miller.</TE>
<TE>   The selection committee also was expected to select a player to
fill an open spot on the roster as an alternate. Duke point guard Jay
Williams, expected to be one of the top picks in the NBA draft, has
already been named an alternate.</TE>
<TE>   George Karl of the Milwaukee Bucks will coach the team.</TE>
<TE>   Several NBA players will be competing for foreign teams in the
16-nation field.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers announced Saturday that the average price of a season
ticket will increase from $35 to $40 next season.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers, 39-43 last season, averaged a franchise-record
18,053 at Staples Center and had 25 sellouts, including 16 in a row
to end the season.</TE>
<TE>   "After maintaining such relatively low ticket prices for so long,
we are restructuring our pricing for next year as a crucial first
step in the acknowledgment of the growing challenges we face," said
Andy Roeser, Clipper executive vice president, in a prepared
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Roeser said last month he expects the team's payroll to increase
from a league-low of about $34 million, perhaps surpassing this past
season's salary cap of $42.5 million. Ticket price hikes could offset
some of that increase.</TE>
<TE>   Center Michael Olowokandi and point guard Jeff McInnis are
eligible to become free agents July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Forwards Brand and Lamar Odom and guard Corey Maggette are
eligible for contract extensions.</TE>

<LD>"I'm comfortable where I'm at. I'm 345, 14% body fat. I'm not going
to get any smaller. If it ever comes to a point to where I can't do
it anymore, then I'll just retire. Nobody plays forever. I've been in
this raggedy league for 10 years now and if it ever gets to where I
don't want to work out, where I don't feel like working out, then
I'll just have other things to fall back on."</LD>
<LD>   --Shaquille O'Neal last week</LD>
<LD>   The Big (Fill in the Blank) at the crossroads....</LD>
<TE>   It was a rough season for the local jolly giant, who wasn't as
jolly, if more gigantic. But aren't they all?</TE>
<TE>   By objective standards, he should be on top of the world. He's
rich, he's famous, he has a nice family life, he's on a powerhouse
team with a fellow superstar as his sidekick.</TE>
<TE>   It's a great life, except for when he feels put upon by opponents
pounding on him, opponents flopping, referees protecting opponents,
the league changing the rules to thwart him and the media for
everything they do, not to mention the occasional snit with Phil
Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that was most of this season.</TE>
<TE>   One of his nicknames in the dressing room--out of earshot,
anyway--is the Big Moody. This season was particularly trying for him
and, consequently, everyone around him.</TE>
<TE>   After coming in heavy last season and playing his way into shape,
he vowed to come back at 290, his rookie weight. But when he began
working out, the little toe on his left foot flared up, requiring
surgery. There went his summer.</TE>
<TE>   Then in the fall, his right big toe began hurting, meaning he
couldn't practice. So much for playing his way into shape.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody can say for sure his weight caused his injuries, but, on
the other hand, it couldn't have helped. Moreover, he just turned 30.
Injuries no longer heal overnight, nor can he eat whatever he wants
without gaining weight.</TE>
<TE>   Not that he seems to feel like making any more promises to change
at the moment.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a question of falling from grace. He has already secured
his place in this league.</TE>
<TE>   It is a question of whether he goes back to his old level, rather
than his current one ... and how much fun he has doing it ... and how
long he feels like staying around to do it. He has been telling
teammates lately it'll be two more seasons and out, but despite
myriad annoyances, this is his world now.</TE>
<TE>   Recognition, withheld for so long, has gone beyond anything he
ever hoped for. The question is no longer whether he's the NBA's most
dominating player--everyone concedes that--but whether he's the most
dominating who ever played.</TE>
<TE>   Even people who go back to Wilt Chamberlain now have O'Neal ahead
of everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think Shaquille is the
best center to ever play the game," said Jerry West, who played with
Chamberlain, coached Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, signed O'Neal and never
said anything like it before.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel kind of bad saying that because of Abdul-Jabbar and
Wilt, but I just don't see anyone else with the whole package like
him, now or ever."</TE>
<TE>   Says Pete Newell, the big man's guru: "I've never seen anyone like
Shaq. I've never seen anyone with better hands. I haven't seen a man
that big with better footwork. How many of the best centers had the
spin move? ... None of them."</TE>
<TE>   Even in a sub-par season, O'Neal was third in the MVP race--while
coaches and general managers around the league noted the voting
didn't necessarily have anything to do with real life.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk about who should be the MVP, but it should be Shaq," said
Buck General Manager Ernie Grunfeld at midseason.</TE>
<TE>   While promoting his own Tracy McGrady, Orlando Coach Doc Rivers
added, "But let's face it, you could vote for Shaq every year."</TE>
<TE>   Not that O'Neal's gig isn't harder than it looks. You may think
for $25 million a year, you could handle it, but then there's the
scrutiny, which even got to Michael Jordan, who became obsessed with
disproving anything anyone said about him.</TE>
<TE>   (Kobe Bryant is a notable exception. When they were feuding, it
was always O'Neal who got mad first. Bryant was so much into his own
trip, he barely knew Shaq was there. With Bryant, it's rarely
personal but with Shaq, it usually is.)</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Lakers' predicament, this is actually a better time
for O'Neal, whose mood lifts as the end nears. In the conference
finals--but not before--he starts going to the interview room, where
he's so engaging. He made last season's all-interview second team, a
signal honor for one who speaks so infrequently.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, he's limited and embarrassed about it. He tiptoes
through first quarters, warming up his sore feet or pacing his large
self, especially at home, which is why the Lakers are having trouble.</TE>
<TE>   He's especially keen to make sure the media understands he's
hurting, as he was in San Antonio, or being shortchanged, as when he
was called for those charging fouls in Sacramento, as opposed to
being outplayed by anyone, as if someone doubted it.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, bristling at a suggestion, which only he had divined,
that Vlade Divac had somehow gotten the better of him in Game 2, he
told writers:</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, I think you guys insult me by not writing what you
see."</TE>
<TE>   Here's what I see. These are the good times and when they're gone,
you can't imagine how much you're going to miss this raggedy league.</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   Despite widespread skepticism about Yao Ming, the Houston Rockets,
who drew the first pick, are signaling they will, indeed, select him.
Chicago is a lock to take Jay Williams, so that's two spots nailed
down.... What, us disappointed? The New York Knicks, who were acting
as if they already owned Yao's rights, are now cheerily preparing to
choose seventh. General Manager Scott Layden: "We could easily have
lost ground so you look at it positively. We didn't hurt ourselves
today. The draft has the potential to go beyond seven." Of course,
they're still interested in trading for No. 1, if the Rockets will
take that Latrell Sprewell-Marcus Camby package everyone else has
been turning down for years.</TE>
<TE>   How I spent my summer: Despite wowing everyone in the postseason,
rookie Tony Parker had to carry David Robinson's shoes, pictures and
basketballs to the car when the San Antonio Spurs cleaned out their
lockers. "Tony can't forget who he is," Robinson said. "He can't
forget his place. If I see him during the summer, he's still mine.
When next season starts, he's officially not obligated anymore." ...
Despite the heat Divac gets, the fact is everyone flops now. Referees
are falling for it, calling charges as long as the defender makes it
look good by falling backward. Says Seattle's Desmond Mason, an
artist in only his second season: "A lot of big guys see a smaller
guy on him so what they want to do is bang him. They want to take a
hard dribble, get up under and try to jump up and dunk on him. So
what I do is I hold my ground and when they make that power dribble,
I take that blow.... You can flop. I'm not going to say that it's all
a charge. The guy is hitting me hard but he isn't hitting me hard
enough where I can't stand my ground and take that shot. You got to
put a little Hollywood in it."</TE>
<TE>   The SuperSonics, in rebuilding mode, are signaling they won't
re-sign Gary Payton, 34 in July, whose agent announced he wants a
contract extension before next season. "Not once did he say anything
to me about his extension," Coach Nate McMillan said after Payton's
exit interview. "I expect him to honor his contract. I expect him to
be here next year." ... They're off to a rough summer in Denver,
which was hoping to land Larry Brown, who now looks as if he'll
actually stay in Philadelphia. No Brown probably means no Antonio
McDyess, who'll be a free agent in 2003 and already looked as though
he was halfway out the door, having told Sports Illustrated's Ian
Thomsen: "I won't say that I'm definitely leaving, but I'm not
getting younger." Nor does McDyess seem keen on the Nuggets' request
that he help them recruit free agents. "What do I tell them?" he
asked. "I can't sell them on us winning because we haven't won. I
can't sell them on the weather or the tax [breaks] because it's not
Florida or Texas." ... Memphis University Coach John Calipari, who
had signed junior college star Qyntel Woods, said teams at the bottom
of the NBA draft were inflating his prospects, hoping to entice him
to come out. "See," said Calipari, "what I did was I went public and
said that if he's not a top-five pick then he's coming with us. And
then what did he become? A top-five pick. But you're not going to
fool Vanesia [Woods' mother]. They know what's going on." ... After
that, Woods declared for the draft, along with freshman Dajuan
Wagner, Calipari's star, and junior Chris Massie, his starting power
forward.</TE>

<HD>Nets Buckle Under to Celtics</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Boston produces greatest fourth-quarter
comeback in playoff history in 94-90 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Paul Pierce was a comet, leaving a trail of flailing defenders. Kenny
Anderson was an untouchable tornado. Antoine Walker was a battering
ram, imposing his will on the court, pummeling his teammates on the
bench with words.</LD>
<LD>   The Boston Celtics completed the greatest fourth-quarter comeback
in NBA playoff history Saturday at the FleetCenter and beat the New
Jersey Nets, 94-90, in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals. The
Celtics, who have a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series that
continues here Monday, trailed the Nets, 28-13, at the end of the
first quarter, 54-34, at the end of the first half, 74-53, at the end
of the third quarter.</LD>
<LD>   What followed was a blur of inspiring desperation.</LD>
<TE>   In the fourth quarter, Boston outscored New Jersey, 41-16, and
those bloodless numbers do no justice to the wild-eyed Celtics or the
quivering Nets.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest," Walker said, "I've never been a part of something
like this in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Said Pierce: "It's hard for me to describe what I've just
witnessed. It's the greatest comeback I've ever been a part of."</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics led, 1-0, and didn't lead again until Pierce made two
free throws with 46 seconds left to put Boston ahead, 91-90. New
Jersey's Kerry Kittles slapped an Anderson layup too late and got a
goaltending call with 29.8 seconds left to put Boston ahead, 93-90,
and Pierce made one more three throw with 17.6 seconds left to end
the scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Net guard Jason Kidd missed four three-point shots in those last
17.6 seconds, but the New Jersey unraveling had finished before that.
Maybe when the ball slipped out of Keith Van Horn's hands so that he
double-clutched on a three-point shot with about 20 seconds left,
enabling Walker to block it.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe the collapse had been completed when Boston's Rodney
Rogers planted his feet in the lane, bent his knees, crossed his arms
and stood stoically when New Jersey's Lucious Harris thought he had
an easy layup. All Harris got was a charging foul with 1:16 left and
the Net lead stayed at 90-87.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the Nets' fate was sealed when they scored their last
field goal with 4:08 left, a 19-foot shot by Kittles that had given
them an 88-78 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Who even knows when a team totally loses its hold on a 26-point
lead, which was how far the Nets were ahead with 8:31 left in the
third quarter after a Van Horn jump shot put New Jersey ahead, 65-39.</TE>
<TE>   "All I wanted at that point," Walker said, "was for us to not quit
and show we were a better team than that going into Monday's game. I
can't repeat what I said to my team, but I just told them whether we
win or not, we have to show New Jersey we were a better basketball
team than that."</TE>
<TE>   Walker talked even tougher at the end of the third quarter. He
challenged Pierce to quit settling for jump shots. Pierce, who had
made three of 20 from the field in Game 2, made two of 14 in the
first three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Celtics scored the first 11 points of the fourth quarter.
Pierce, who scored 19 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter, had
three high-flying, atmosphere-piercing layups and a free throw;
Walker had another layup; and Anderson a jump shot. In 2:47 the
Celtics had sliced a 74-53 deficit into something they could handle.</TE>
<TE>   And yet it was a good thing no one had told them that until
Saturday, no team had come from further back in the fourth quarter
than the Phoenix Suns' run from 18 down--100-82--while defeating the
Houston Rockets, 124-117, in 1994. And the Suns had to go to overtime
to win. In the history of the playoffs, teams that have led by 19 or
more points at the end of the third quarter are 171-1.</TE>
<TE>   When the final buzzer sounded, Pierce threw himself on the court
and pounded his fists on the parquet. Walker jumped onto the scorer's
table and lifted his arms high. The other Celtics had gathered in a
massive hug in the center of the court while Coach Jim O'Brien ran
around dazedly pumping his fists.</TE>
<TE>   "The first three quarters were close to hell," O'Brien said, "but
that last quarter was Eden. Damn, that was great. I can't even begin
to describe what has happened."</TE>
<TE>   Said New Jersey Coach Byron Scott: "We had the game and we blew
it. We quit running our offense."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets were four of 22 from the field in the fourth quarter and
committed six turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just one game," Kidd said. One game maybe, but one big
collapse.</TE>

<LD>Sunday Break won the $200,000 Peter Pan Stakes by only a length over
11-1 shot Puzzlement, but the victory was accomplished easily by the
1-2 favorite.</LD>
<LD>   Prepping for a likely appearance in the Belmont Stakes on June 8,
the 3-year-old Forty Niner colt earned his first stakes win and was
asked for his best only briefly in the run to the wire. Ridden by
Gary Stevens, he completed the 11/8 miles in 1:48 Saturday at Belmont
Park.</LD>
<LD>   Trained by Neil Drysdale for Koji Maeda, Sunday Break won for the
fourth time in seven starts. In 13 days, he'll try to do what A.P.
Indy did for Drysdale 10 years ago. That is, win the Peter Pan and
the Belmont in succession.</LD>
<TE>   "I can tell you this didn't take much out of him," Stevens said.
"He was much stronger today than he had been in the past. The time
between races has really helped him.</TE>
<TE>   "If we make it to the Belmont, I hope I'm the spoiler. If I can't
win, I would love to see a Triple Crown."</TE>

<HD>Surapol a Surprise Winner in Singles Final</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The murmurs and whispers about a possible upset began when Cerritos
Whitney High senior Chris Surapol fought off match point in the
second-set tiebreaker.</LD>
<LD>   Then the 5-foot-7, 130-pound player did what nobody else had done
this season when he rallied to defeat senior Doug Stewart of Malibu,
3-6, 7-6 (1), 6-1, in the Southern Section boys' tennis individual
tournament singles final Saturday at SeaCliff Tennis Club in
Huntington Beach.</LD>
<LD>   "I was just trying to play well," Surapol said. "I'm not real big
and I don't have a lot of power but I can get the ball back, and I
was doing it today."</LD>
<TE>   There were plenty of contenders for the title, the top-seeded and
previously unbeaten Stewart chief among them. Surapol was the most
surprising of the semifinalists who started the day.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Stewart (63-1), the defending champion who was attempting
to become the first player to win the title two years in a row since
Richard Bohrnstedt of Redlands did it in 1967-68, second-seeded Aaron
Yovan of Irvine University and third-seeded Rylan Rizza of Palos
Verdes Peninsula also were in the competition until Surapol knocked
them out.</TE>
<TE>   Surapol displayed plenty of speed and power in upsetting Rizza,
7-6 (1), 4-6, 6-1, in the quarterfinals Friday, and then topping
Yovan, 7-6 (5), 6-4, in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   "I got all this confidence," said Surapol, a nifty shot-maker who
plans to walk on at UCLA next year. "I was placing the ball well and
hitting it well."</TE>
<TE>   The Virginia-bound Stewart took the loss hard. He had a match
point at 6-5 in the second-set tiebreaker but hit a backhand volley
into the net. Surapol aced his next serve for 7-6 and a won the
tiebreaker and set when Stewart netted a forehand return.</TE>
<TE>   "It's real disappointing, especially because I had so many
chances," Stewart said. "He just played too good. In the third set,
there was nothing I could do."</TE>
<TE>   Surapol (74-6 in sets) broke Stewart to open the third set as the
two played six deuce points. Surapol held the next game with four
aces for a 2-0 lead. After Stewart held serve, Surapol fought off
three break points to take a 3-1 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Corona del Mar's Garrett Snyder and Carsten Ball defeated Los
Alamitos' John Mano and Jason Wood, 6-3, 7-5, to win the doubles
title. Snyder also won the doubles title last year with a different
partner.</TE>

<LD>When they took the first game, they also took the momentum.</LD>
<LD>   Manhattan Beach Mira Costa (28-1) battled back from a 13-7 deficit
to take the first game and then coasted to their second consecutive
Southern Section Division II championship by defeating Bellflower St.
John Bosco, 18-16, 15-6, 15-5 on Saturday at Cypress College.</LD>
<LD>   "[St. John Bosco] played very well in the first half of the first
game, but then we steadied our play and came back," said Mira Costa
Coach Mike Cook. "Winning that first game was critical."</LD>
<TE>   Coming into Saturday's game, both Mira Costa and St. John Bosco
(39-2) had only lost to one opponent--La Costa Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   The Mustangs featured a balanced attack, with three players
finishing with double-digit kills.</TE>
<TE>   Middle blocker Pat Nihipali had 16 kills and outside hitters Tim
Schneider and Josh Schwarzapel each had 10.</TE>
<TE>   "Josh and Tim were the keys today," Cook said.</TE>
<TE>   "Tim had a huge kill at the end of game one that got us a side out
and allowed us to be in a position to win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other section finals:</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Esperanza d. Valencia, 15-10, 15-7, 15-5--Outside hitter
Jason Jablonsky had 24 kills and Mark Lovein added 12 to lead the
Aztecs (16-5) to the Division I victory over the Vikings (28-3).</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Canyon d. Santa Barbara San Marcos, 15-6, 8-15, 15-9,
15-13--Outside hitter John Parfitt dominated the Division III match
for Canyon (10-6), finishing with 52 kills.</TE>
<TE>   San Marcos (17-6) was led by senior Seamus McKiernan, who had 36
kills and nine blocks.</TE>
<TE>   Brentwood d. Calabasas Viewpoint, 15-12, 15-8, 6-15,

<LD>First came the Southern Section Division IV boys' volleyball final
Saturday afternoon for Santa Ynez, which made quick work of Irvine
Northwood, 15-12, 15-9, 15-12.</LD>
<LD>   Then the Pirates flew home Saturday evening to Santa Ynez so they
could attend to personal business--the prom.</LD>
<LD>   With their win on Saturday, the Pirates claimed their fourth
Southern Section title in a row, finishing with their first
undefeated record since 1995, when the Pirates defeated Sun Valley
Village Christian for the Division III title.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know if you understand the magnitude of what just
happened," Pirate Coach Chip Fenenga said to his players after the
match. "Going undefeated, winning the [section title] for the fourth
year in a row--it was a whole team effort. I couldn't be prouder,
especially of the seniors."</TE>
<TE>   The match ended on a bitter note for the Timberwolves (23-2) as
Santa Ynez (27-0) was awarded match point when a Northwood player
argued a call and received a red card.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always a relief to get a game over with," said Santa Ynez
senior Matt McKinney, who finished with a game-high 22 kills.
"[Northwood has] improved so much in the last year, but we have a lot
of seniors and we've been in this situation before. We know we have
to stay poised."</TE>
<TE>   Middle blocker Dan Profeta led the Timberwolves with 12 kills.</TE>

<LD>In a matter of weeks, high school athletes who play more than one
sport are going to face their annual summer challenge of trying to
avoid mental and physical exhaustion.</LD>
<LD>   Almost every day, they will have a workout or event scheduled.
Almost every day, they will have to make decisions that could
alienate one coach or empower another.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes they will have to be as elusive as Spider-Man. They'll
change uniforms in their cars or bolt in the middle of one
competition to participate in another.</LD>
<TE>   "It beat me up," said Brad Boyer, a three-sport athlete at Oxnard
Camarillo High, of his experience last summer. "It was a lot of days
of coming home and taking a nap. I'd love to be at the beach with all
the girls, but I'd sacrifice and be in the scorching heat, running
sprints."</TE>
<TE>   Multiple-sport athletes are fading away in this era of
specialization and year-round single-sport commitments, but they can
exist if coaches will compromise and athletes can set priorities
during the hectic eight-week summer season.</TE>
<TE>   Boyer is an example of an athlete who refused to listen to
skeptics. Adults and teenagers told him to cut back if he wanted to
receive a college scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   "It almost came to the point I was [hearing] from everyone," he
said. "I told myself I'm going to live my own life. High school is
once in a lifetime. I've been playing basketball my whole life and
wasn't going to give it up. Football was for the adrenaline rush."</TE>
<TE>   Boyer earned a baseball scholarship to Arizona while also starting
as a wide receiver and point guard in high school. The cooperation of
Camarillo's coaches was critical. On one summer day, Boyer had a
basketball workout in the morning, a football workout in the
afternoon and an American Legion baseball game in the evening. But he
loved it.</TE>
<TE>   "If I didn't do it, I'd be bored and lazy and probably end up more
tired," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There are basketball coaches who punish their players for playing
football. There are baseball coaches who become annoyed when players
miss Legion games because of football or basketball commitments.</TE>
<TE>   Those coaches unwilling to encourage multiple-sport athletes are
doing a disservice to their schools, programs and students.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to give and take," said Thousand Oaks High football
Coach Mike Sanders. "We're better off with the kids than without
them. I think kids gain mental toughness from competition."</TE>
<TE>   For all the talk that focusing on one sport enhances a teenager's
chances of gaining a scholarship, there's evidence that
multiple-sport athletes benefit from picking up physical and mental
skills from sports that aren't their specialty.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Ben Olson of Thousand Oaks could start at Brigham
Young this fall, and he's grateful for his basketball experiences
that taught him how to focus in pressure situations, when fans were
screaming and victory or defeat depended on whether he made a shot or
a free throw.</TE>
<TE>   This past season, Thousand Oaks won Marmonte League championships
in basketball and football because Sanders and basketball Coach Rich
Endres worked together to create a positive environment for
multiple-sport athletes. Four of the five starting basketball players
were football players.</TE>
<TE>   "What we tell the kids is as long as we know where they're at,
it's not a problem," Endres said of missing summer games. "They're
not going to be able to attend all my events or [Sanders'], and it's
worked out."</TE>
<TE>   Female athletes have a more difficult time than males
participating in multiple sports during the summer because of club
commitments. Every summer weekend is booked with club softball games.
Ditto for soccer players and volleyball players. Most club coaches
refuse to compromise when it comes to missing practices or games.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it's up to the athletes to decide whether they have
the stamina and mental toughness to spend their summers jumping from
sport to sport.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Smith of Woodland Hills Taft is one of the top two-sport
athletes in California. He's a heavily recruited receiver in football
and a two-time All-City basketball player. Starting with the L.A.
Watts Summer Games on June 15, he'll be playing both sports in the
summer.</TE>
<TE>   "You're always tired, always on the way to doing something," he
said. "You never really get a day off. Everybody wants me to go to a
camp or combine."</TE>
<TE>   Making good choices, being organized and working with his coaches
will be the key to whether Smith's summer is productive and
enjoyable.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Grady, a 6-foot-6 senior at Huntington Beach Edison High, is
considered among the top quarterbacks in California. Football is the
sport he'll play in college, but he has wisely refused to give up
basketball and baseball in high school.</TE>
<TE>   Basketball is helping him gain mobility and agility. As a pitcher,
he has the size that could still make him a professional prospect. He
has whittled his college choices in football to Miami, Florida,
Tennessee, Oklahoma and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   His summer schedule will include daily football workouts from 8 to
10 a.m., basketball from 10 to noon and baseball from 1 to 3 p.m.,
plus passing leagues in the evening.</TE>
<TE>   No one doubts the importance of summer workouts in developing
individual and team skills.</TE>
<TE>   An average player can become an all-star and a team can take the
first steps to becoming a champion. Let's hope that wise decisions
are made, and teenagers are given the chance to succeed based on
ability and commitment and not on calendar choices.</TE>

<HD>Early Optimism Runs Deep for Sparks</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: L.A. gets contributions across the board in
72-64 opening victory over New York.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saturday's WNBA opener against the New York Liberty did not show
whether the Sparks can make a realistic run at the undefeated season
Coach Michael Cooper thinks his team is capable of.</LD>
<LD>   But the 72-64 victory over New York, before 11,289 at Staples
Center, did make a case that the 2002 edition of the Sparks might be
better than the 2001 team that won the league championship.</LD>
<LD>   In other seasons, a scoreless first half from Lisa Leslie might
have put the Sparks in a perilous position or at least a high level
of anguish. But this year's team appears to have more depth.</LD>
<TE>   Eight of the 10 players in uniform (Latasha Byears was serving a
one-game suspension) scored at least one basket for the Sparks.
Leslie finished with 14 points, as did Mwadi Mabika and new addition
Sophia Witherspoon. Tamecka Dixon had 12 and rookie Nikki Teasley had
eight.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Cooper, normally one of the league's more animated
coaches, sat peacefully on the Spark bench with his head in his hand.
His expression was the same whether the Sparks trailed (31-30 at the
half) or when they took their biggest lead, 67-53, with 3:22 left to
play.</TE>
<TE>   The win stretched the Sparks' regular-season home winning streak
to 23 games, dating to July 14, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the kind of depth I imagined we could have," Cooper
said. "And once [Brazilian rookie] Ericka DeSouza understands this
game she'll add another dimension to us because we'll have three
legitimate players [6-foot-3] and up.</TE>
<TE>   "When we get rolling we're gonna be a tough team to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   They were too much for New York, which got 19 points from Vickie
Johnson, 14 points from Tamika Whitmore, 13 from Tari Phillips, but
little else.</TE>
<TE>   The Liberty struggled from the field, making 34.8% of its 69
shots. Johnson made seven of 16, Phillips five of 15 and Whitmore
four of 10. New York's other key starter, Crystal Robinson, had a
miserable game, making only one of eight.</TE>
<TE>   Said Liberty Coach Richie Adubato, "Some of the people who shoot
the ball well for us were not knocking it in tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie made it tough on the Liberty with seven blocked shots to go
along with 14 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Lisa is the ultimate professional," Cooper said. "She set the
tone with those first four blocks. She doesn't just have to score for
us anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Said Adubato: "I think she's hanging out with Shaq too much."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Sparks, who shot 47.3% (26 of 55) and had 21
assists (led by Dixon with seven), expect this sharing-the-ball
notion to catch on.</TE>
<TE>   "With this team, yes, Lisa is the focal point, but you never know
who's going to hurt you," said DeLisha Milton, who scored only two
points but concentrated on harassing Whitmore and Phillips on
defense. "If Lisa is short, someone else may have 20 or 25. That's
the luxury we have on this team."</TE>
<TE>   Despite enjoying an early eight-point lead, the Sparks saw New
York outscore them, 13-5, in the last seven minutes of the first
half.</TE>
<TE>   The Liberty wasn't making many shots, but it was getting plenty of
them. New York worked the boards for a 16-9 edge (8-1 on the
offensive end), and kept Los Angeles from turning on its fastbreak to
try to wear down its smaller, older opponent.</TE>
<TE>   But in the second half the Sparks took charge of the glass--the
rebound totals wound up 31-31--took the lead for good, 35-34, on two
Mabika free throws, and generally grew stronger as the game
progressed.</TE>
<TE>   "Rebounding was the difference in the second half--especially with
the guards," Dixon said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Cooper: "Overall I thought it was a good game against one of
the better teams in the East. New York is still trying to make some
improvements, and they're a ways away as far as their cohesiveness.
But it was a good win for us."</TE>

<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Stacy Dragila, winner of the first women's Olympic pole vault title
two years ago at Sydney, believes a female pole vaulter will some day
clear 17 feet. And Dragila, who set a world outdoor record of 15
feet, 9 1/4 inches last September, wants to be the first woman to
clear 16 feet.</LD>
<LD>   But as the outdoor track and field season heats up, she's focusing
on one foot. She has a sore left arch, which idled her four weeks
before the indoor season and remains tender.</LD>
<LD>   Hampered because of the injury and a bout with flu, Dragila lost
her world indoor record to Svetlana Feofanova of Russia, who set five
world records in 29 days and cleared 15-7 in March. But Dragila is
optimistic she can bear the pain and continue to blaze a trail in the
sport.</LD>
<TE>   "Things are going better now, but I'm still in a little bit of
pain, so I don't know what's going on," said Dragila, who attributed
the problem to unsuitable shoes she got from a new sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   "I struggled with the idea of, 'Do I take off the outdoor season?'
But there are so many women jumping well, I could be left in the
dust."</TE>
<TE>   Dragila hoped to re-establish her supremacy over Feofanova at
today's Prefontaine Classic at Hayward Field, but the Russian
withdrew because of a fever, organizers said. Nonetheless, the 28th
Prefontaine meet--named for the late and legendary distance runner
Steve Prefontaine--will have impressive fields in every event.</TE>
<TE>   The meet, the second of four on USA Track and Field's Outdoor
Golden Spike Tour and an IAAF Grand Prix event, will feature
quintuple Sydney medalist Marion Jones in the 100. Jones has never
lost a competition at the Prefontaine Classic, having won the 100,
200 and long jump twice each in four appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco, the world mile record holder and
world champion and record holder in the 1,500, will defend his mile
title against a field that includes world 1,500 runner-up Bernard
Lagat of Kenya. Competing in other events are three-time 100-meter
hurdles world champion Allen Johnson, 110-meter hurdles world
champion Anjanette Kirkland, men's world pole vault champion Jeff
Hartwig and men's Olympic pole vault gold medalist Nick Hysong.</TE>
<TE>   In the women's discus, UCLA alum and U.S. record holder Suzy
Powell will be challenged by another former Bruin, four-time U.S.
champ Seilala Sua, and Kris Kuehl.</TE>
<TE>   There's show-stealing potential in the men's 100, which has four
of the five fastest sprinters in the world this season--Tim
Montgomery (9.94), Shawn Crawford (9.94), J.J. Johnson (9.95) and
Coby Miller (9.98).</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery's car bears a license plate reading "Track 9.75," the
time he dreams of running to break Maurice Greene's world record of
9.79 seconds. Although he believes it's too early in the season for a
record, he anticipates a fast time today.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I can go 9.8-something," said Montgomery, who won last
year's U.S. title in 9.95 seconds and was second to Greene at the
World Championships, 9.85 to Greene's 9.82. "I know I can go faster
than anybody's run on American soil, which is 9.84 [by Canada's
Donovan Bailey at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics]....</TE>
<TE>   "My main thing now is to go out there and put myself in the class
Maurice has put himself. This weekend is very important for me."</TE>
<TE>   His only regret is that Greene, hampered by a pulled calf muscle,
won't run here. Montgomery outraced his rival when each anchored
400-meter relay teams at the Penn Relays last month, a moment
Montgomery called his first breakthrough because he saw fear on
Greene's face.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's not ready, I don't want to run against him," said
Montgomery, who considers Greene the best 100-meter runner in history
but admires Carl Lewis' strong finishes. "I want Maurice when he's at
his best. For him not to be racing is very, very painful."</TE>

<HD>Lakers Need Some Inspiration From the Bench</HD>

<LD>If a coach's No. 1 job is to have his team ready to play, then the
Lakers' Phil Jackson has been outcoached by Sacramento's Rick
Adelman. Since Game 1, the Kings have made the right adjustments,
while the Lakers have played in a funk. That's why Sacramento looks
to take a commanding 3-1 lead today in the best-of-seven Western
Conference series.</LD>
<LD>   Although Jackson is not on the court shooting bricks as his
players have been the last two games, he hasn't inspired his team
enough to shut down the Kings, who have exploited the Lakers' sagging
defense with passing and unselfish play.</LD>
<LD>   But don't count out the Lakers yet. The two previous times Jackson
has coached a team looking for its third consecutive NBA title, the
third playoff run was the most difficult.</LD>
<TE>   In the 1992-93 Eastern Conference finals, Chicago fell behind,
2-0, to New York before bouncing back to win its third championship
in a row. In the 1997-98 conference finals, Indiana took the Bulls to
seven games before Chicago advanced to defeat Utah in the NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   The way the Kings dominated and laughed at the Lakers in Game 3,
they definitely have the two-time NBA champion's attention now. A
breakdown of Game 4:</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS' MOVE: In Game 1, the Lakers cruised past the Kings because
they made open shots and helped on defense. However, in the last two
games, the Lakers have done more standing around, which has made it
easier for Sacramento on both ends of the court.</TE>
<TE>   Don't look for the Lakers to start off playing the same frenetic
style of basketball that sparked their fourth-quarter comeback in
Game 3. But they do need to play with that same type of energy. The
Lakers must get back to movement in the triangle offense, which means
using Shaquille O'Neal in the middle but not counting on him to do
everything.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant should have more confidence thanks to a strong
shooting finish on Friday. But both Bryant and O'Neal need Derek
Fisher, Rick Fox and the rest of the Laker role players to step up
and make quicker and better decisions. The Lakers should realize by
now that they have a better chance of beating the Kings' sagging and
clutching defense when they move the ball inside-outside and then
inside again.</TE>
<TE>   KINGS' MOVE: It's a good thing Mike Bibby is starting to get the
credit he deserves because he's dominating the Lakers. Bibby's
ability to control the tempo is something the Lakers have not truly
faced since Utah and John Stockton had their number a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings should continue to feed the Lakers' pick-and-rolls until
they're stopped. As long as Chris Webber and Vlade Divac make smart
decisions if the Lakers double-team Bibby, Sacramento will have an
edge. The one constant problem area for the Lakers throughout their
championship run has been defending pick-and-rolls. O'Neal has often
been the target of the Kings' picks and they will probably continue
to have success until the Lakers get on the same page to defend this
tactic.</TE>
<TE>   KEY POINT: If you noticed the Lakers' body language on the bench
early in the fourth quarter of Game 3, they definitely did not look
like a confident and united team. The lack of emotion on the faces of
Fisher, Fox and O'Neal was not positive. Another bad sign was how the
Lakers have been bickering. Samaki Walker, Devean George and Lindsey
Hunter have been on the receiving end of a ton of on-the-court advice
from their teammates.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings can't help but feel good when they see this from the
Lakers. It used to be Sacramento that began to point fingers when
things got tough, but the Lakers have done that lately. Give credit
to the Kings' leadership. Divac, Doug Christie, Webber, Bibby and
especially Adelman have been solid in their support of each another.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers can't afford to fall apart now. This challenge is what
establishes a dynasty. If they go down without a fight, losing to the
Kings would make them seem like the big bully on the block who got
knocked out. It's up to Sacramento to keep making things difficult
for the Lakers to regain their rhythm.</TE>

<HD>Bibby Is Kings' Iceman Cometh</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL WILBON</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>

<LD>They needed an ingredient that would cut the spice, essentially a
flavor reduction. The Sacramento Kings had all the shooters, dunkers
and fancy passers a team could ever want. What they needed was a
pragmatist, a driver who knew when to cover the break, a playmaker
whose game was based in nuance.</LD>
<LD>   So they swapped the glittering Jason Williams for the vanilla Mike
Bibby and the Kings have been transformed. For the first time, they
have playoff substance to go with their considerable style. Last
postseason they were swept by the Lakers; this year they have a 2-1
lead even without All-Star Peja Stojakovic and it's mostly because of
Bibby.</LD>
<LD>   "He makes huge difference in our team; it's so obvious," King
Coach Rick Adelman said Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   King forward Chucky Brown, who has seen it all playing for 12 NBA
teams in 13 seasons, would watch Sacramento (a team he joined only in
February) and be wowed like the rest of us.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason was a good player and a popular player for the Kings,"
Brown said, "but Sacramento was so freewheeling and dealing. They'd
throw a behind-the-back pass with three seconds left when a simple
chest pass would have been the smarter move. It's still there, just
toned down.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike Bibby's been a perfect fit here because he's so cool under
pressure. He never appears rattled, at home or on the road. I call
him the 'New Iceman' because he's that calm all the time."</TE>
<TE>   That calmness brings, more than anything, reliability. Williams
could bring you out of your seat with his Maravich-like passes and
pull-up jumpers, but reliable he never was. The Kings were never
going to beat the Lakers and probably were never going deep in the
playoffs with Williams as the lead guard because he couldn't pull
back, couldn't do the mundane, colorless things a playmaker has to do
in the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby is the son of a former NBA point guard, USC Coach Henry
Bibby, and plays like one. Getting Bibby was the perfect trade for
the Kings from the moment General Manager Geoff Petrie announced it.
(Sacramento beat the Wizards, among others, to the punch for Bibby.)</TE>
<TE>   The one thing Bibby had not done his first three years in the
NBA--he was playing for the last-place Vancouver Grizzlies,
remember--was play in the playoffs. "He is being exposed to the
playoffs for the first time," Adelman said. "And he's getting better
every game."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby's emotional makeup and his ability to get a veteran team to
trust that he knows when to push and when to pull back is what has
Sacramento and the Kings as excited as this 2-1 lead over the Lakers.
If the Kings are going to dethrone the Lakers, the challengers will
have to be steadier than they've ever been, smart, efficient and
sometimes downright bland, which goes against their every instinct.
The Kings have a lot of talented players, but this particular job
falls to Bibby, which is why Webber says with plenty of
justification, "Mike Bibby has been a godsend."</TE>

<LD>Adrienne Goodson scored 20 points, including the go-ahead basket in
overtime, as the Utah Starzz beat the Minnesota Lynx, 79-75, Saturday
night at Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   The Lynx, with WNBA All-Star Katie Smith sidelined because of an
injured right index finger, had chances to tie or take the lead after
Goodson's layup with 44.3 seconds left.</LD>
<LD>   But Svetlana Abrosimova and Betty Lennox missed three-point shots,
and Michele Van Gorp--whose two free throws with 14.5 seconds left in
regulation forced overtime--was called for an over-the-back foul.</LD>
<TE>   Jennifer Azzi's free throw made it 78-75 with 14.3 seconds left.
Lennox missed a three-point basket, and Marie Ferdinand's free throw
secured the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Margo Dydek and Azzi each had 14 points, and Ferdinand had 12 for
Utah, which overcame a poor shooting night from Natalie Williams, who
finished with nine points.</TE>
