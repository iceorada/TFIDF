<HD>Notorious French Prison Turns Into a No-Man's Land</HD>
<DH>Devil's Island is closed but remains a byword for cruelty.
Henri 'Papillon' Charriere and Capt. Alfred Dreyfus were captives
there.</DH>

<DL>OFF THE COAST OF DEVIL'S ISLAND, French Guiana</DL>
<LD>Once there was no escape from Devil's Island. Now there is no access.</LD>
<LD>   The irony may be unintended, but visitors to what used to be the
world's most infamous prison are warded off by a sign saying: "Access
to Devil's Island is strictly forbidden."</LD>
<LD>   Year after year, from the 19th century and well into the 20th,
inmates dreamed in vain of leaving the tiny island of palm trees and
jagged volcanic stone and returning home to France.</LD>
<TE>   Now the ruins of their stone houses lie crumbling, but the island
remains a byword for cruelty, immortalized in the memoirs of Henri
"Papillon" Charriere and the notorious anti- Semitism-driven
miscarriage of justice against Alfred Dreyfus, a French army captain.</TE>
<TE>   Devil's Island and its two sister islands are each separated by
about 250 yards of water and lie eight miles off the South American
mainland. Until 1946, they were the most isolated penitentiary in the
French empire.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Iles du Salut, or "Islands of Salvation," are the most
popular tourist destination in French Guiana. Each year, thousands
visit Royale, the largest, once the administrative center and first
stop for convicts.</TE>
<TE>   The tourists step off ferry boats within sight of a channel where
jailers threw dead prisoners to the sharks, not bothering to give
them a proper burial.</TE>
<TE>   Of the islands that rise from the Atlantic in a snug triangle,
only Ile du Diable -- Devil's Island -- is closed to the public.
There is no dock on the rugged shore that gave the island its name;
officials say swift currents make landings too hazardous.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's better nobody goes," tour guide Bernadette Harlepp
says as she sails past the island on a catamaran. "It has a very bad
history. It's out of respect for the past."</TE>
<TE>   During nearly a century starting in 1852, some 70,000 convicts
were sent to the "bagne," or penal colony. Diseases such as yellow
fever and dysentery killed thousands. Many died without seeing France
again.</TE>
<TE>   "Devil's Island and the bagnes will always remain a shameful,
indelible stain on France's history," said Denis Seznec, whose
grandfather, Guillaume Seznec, was imprisoned on Royale for 14 years.
"The cruelest thing about the islands was that they mixed the worst
criminals with all the rest. Savage murderers were put together with
petty thieves and those arrested for being vagabonds."</TE>
<TE>   His grandfather was convicted of murder but proclaimed his
innocence until his death in France in 1954. Seznec, 55, says the
islands' history is "a reminder that the greatest countries -- and
greatest ideas -- can produce horrible monstrosities."</TE>
<TE>   Charriere, or "Papillon" (butterfly) for the tattoo on his chest,
recalled the horrors of prison life in his 1969 autobiography, which
later became the movie "Papillon" starring Steve McQueen and Dustin
Hoffman.</TE>
<TE>   He described sharks answering a ringing bell by rushing to the
channel to devour convicts' corpses as they slid off the boat.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, tourists bathe in the waters and sharks are seldom seen.</TE>
<TE>   The French National Space Agency assumed ownership of the islands
in 1971 and launches satellite-carrying Ariane rockets from the
mainland. Infrared telescopes on Royale track rockets as they arc
toward space. As a safety measure, employees of the inn on Royale are
evacuated to the mainland during launches.</TE>
<TE>   There are no such uses for Devil's Island, which lies abandoned,
thickly covered with coconut palms. And there are no plans to open it
to tourism like famed island prison Alcatraz.</TE>
<TE>   Pierre Moskwa of the Guiana Space Center says Devil's Island
should stay off-limits to visitors and serve as a monument to the
past. "It's a sanctuary," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Across the water, on Royale, is a sanctuary of a different kind,
where tourists sleep comfortably in jailers' homes that have been
converted into holiday cottages.</TE>
<TE>   At Royale's prison compound, rust crumbles from cell bars and iron
shackle rings. In a courtyard, four blocks that used to support a
guillotine lie on earth once stained with blood.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, all of French Guiana was a penal colony, and many
prisoners never left the South American mainland, but hundreds of
serious offenders were sent to the islands.</TE>
<TE>   Devil's Island, the smallest of the three and most exposed to
waves and wind, was reserved for political prisoners. Many were free
to move about the island, a 15-minute walk from end to end.</TE>
<TE>   Incorrigible convicts were sent to St. Joseph Island for solitary
confinement in a compound that prisoners called "mangeuse d'hommes,"
or devourer of men.</TE>
<TE>   Prisoners weren't allowed to speak a word and could only see
guards pacing above them through barred ceilings. Sentences ranged
from six months to five years. Some convicts went mad. Others killed
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Papillon described two years when he paced in his cell and lay
still on his wood bunk as poisonous centipedes crawled over him.</TE>
<TE>   More than half a century later, the thick roots of ficus trees
stretch through the corridors and down uneven stone steps. The air is
eerily still inside high walls that block the breeze.</TE>
<TE>   Madeleine Calcagni, who runs the Royale inn and restaurant, stays
away from St. Joseph: "I couldn't do business over there because
people there suffered a lot, and you could feel it."</TE>
<TE>   It's an odd business turning a prison into a tourist attraction.
Visitors pose for photos gripping cell bars, close themselves in dark
solitary cells and bask in the sun next to a pool built with forced
labor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a paradise, but it's strange to know that before it was
a prison," said Audrey Bruyere, 23, a Paris student.</TE>
<TE>   The islands teem with animals introduced by humans: Macaws screech
overhead, squirrel monkeys hurtle between branches and large rodents
known as agoutis scamper in the underbrush.</TE>
<TE>   Tourists sip wine at the open-air restaurant overlooking Devil's
Island, where prisoners spent years receiving their provisions along
a cable that stretched across from Royale.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most famous of those on Devil's Island was Dreyfus, a
Jew falsely accused of spying for the Germans and imprisoned alone
from 1895 to 1899. The victim of a paroxysm of French Jew-hatred and
an army too proud to admit its mistake, he was isolated in a small
stone house, tormented by mosquitoes, hungry ants and loneliness.</TE>
<TE>   "Impossible to sleep," he wrote in his diary the night of April
14, 1895. "This cage, in front of which the watchman walks like a
phantom that appears in my dreams, the itch of all the beasts that
run across my skin, the anger that roars in my heart."</TE>
<TE>   He eventually returned to France when evidence pointed to another
officer, and he was exonerated. His tiny house of raw stone still
stands near the southern tip of Devil's Island.</TE>
<TE>   His case brought infamy to the island, and its name became
synonymous with the horrors of the penal colony. But the prison
continued to function until public opinion finally forced its
closing.</TE>
<TE>   At least five prisoners escaped from the islands, one using a
canoe in 1921 and four using a stolen steam ship in 1944, historian
Eugene Epailly said. Others died or were arrested trying to escape.
Most didn't dare brave the sea, Epailly says. "The sharks were the
best guards."</TE>

<HD>City of Light Aims to Woo the Gay Traveler</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jocelyn Gecker</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Paris tourism officials want to give new meaning to the term "Gay
Paree."</LD>
<LD>   The French capital has always wooed visitors with its reputation
for fine dining and high fashion, and Paris continually cashes in on
its mystique as the city of romance. Now it has a new strategy:
selling Paris as a destination for gay travelers.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to create a gay-friendly spirit across the whole city,"
said Laurent Queige, a city official and project organizer. "It's an
entire marketing campaign devoted to gay tourism: promotions,
brochures, media trips, Web sites, tour packages."</LD>
<TE>   And where better to start than with Americans, who have a long
love affair with Paris as well as a large gay community. The city
recently treated journalists from gay publications in the United
States to an expenses-paid trip to Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Such a campaign would hardly seem necessary in a city that prides
itself on its reputation for sexual license, but officials say that
permissiveness doesn't always extend to gays.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Bertrand Delanoe, who is gay, couldn't attend a meeting last
month to inaugurate the gay-friendly tourism campaign because he was
recuperating from a stabbing attack by a man who said he disliked
homosexuals.</TE>
<TE>   The overall challenge for officials working on the campaign is to
tweak the image of a city famous for photographs like the 1950 Robert
Doisneau snapshot of a man and woman stealing a kiss -- incidentally,
in front of City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Travel agents who cater to gay clients are planning package tours
to coincide with summer festivals like the Gay Pride parade, which
last June drew a record half-million people. Ideas also include
discount tours geared to the nightclub scene and other Paris
in-spots.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the special attention to Americans, an outdated guide
called Gay Friendly France is being revamped for circulation at
French tourism offices in the United States as of June 2003. The
Maison de la France in Los Angeles is working with American tour
operators.</TE>
<TE>   Paris is not the first European capital to target the gay tourist.
Berlin, London and Lisbon, among others, have geared marketing toward
gay and lesbian visitors, particularly in the United States, for
years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not doing it discreetly," said Natascha Kompatzki, a
spokeswoman for Berlin's tourist office, adding that gays are "an
important group" for the German capital. Berlin's mayor, Klaus
Wowereit, is openly gay and marched in Berlin's Gay Pride parade this
year.</TE>
<TE>   London and Berlin, like Paris, have prominent gay districts, which
are featured on their tourism Web sites along with listings for
gay-friendly hotels and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   But those cities have a natural advantage, said Remi Calmon, a
spokesman for France's 600-member National Union of Gay Businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "The French are not always -- how shall I say this? -- the nicest
people," said Calmon, whose group is part of Paris' gay-friendly
planning committee. "It's one thing to bring tourists here, but when
they arrive you can't take an attitude with them."</TE>
<TE>   One idea that has prompted great interest was dreamed up in the
small Loire Valley city of Le Mans, best known for its 24-hour auto
race.</TE>
<TE>   On its own mission to attract gay tourism, Le Mans City Hall has
drafted a "Lesbian and Gay Friendly Welcome Charter," which they
mailed to local merchants this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Membership is optional, and so far 37 establishments have signed
up -- including restaurants, bars, travel agencies, a body-piercing
shop and all the city's hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Signatories paste rainbow-colored stickers in their windows with
the message "Welcome to Mans" and a smiley face to let customers know
they are gay friendly. Supporters say the rainbow smiley face sends a
message of tolerance. But others questioned the tactic as being too
politically correct.</TE>
<TE>   "A welcome sign for homosexuals?" said Tony Guimier, whose
menswear shop in the city's historical center opted not to adopt the
charter. "Do they also want me to put up a sign saying, 'I accept
Arabs, blacks and Jews?' "</TE>

<HD>Ho, Ho, Ho, Santa Stay Home, Austrian Critics Sing</HD>
<DH>Traditionalists aim to keep the Jolly Old Elf out of
nation's holiday celebrations. They prefer 'St. Nikolaus' and the
'Christkind.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William J. Kole</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>Ho, ho, ho? No, no, no!</LD>
<LD>   Santa Claus is coming to town -- and many Austrians wish that he'd
just stay home. The Jolly Old Elf is getting an icy reception in this
alpine country that gave the world "Silent Night" and clings to
beloved Christmas traditions.</LD>
<LD>   A small but boisterous movement alarmed at the intrusion of the
American-style Old Saint Nick is crusading to keep the traditional
St. Nikolaus and Christ Child as the reason for the season.</LD>
<TE>   Organizers insist that they're not anti-Santa. But stickers
depicting Santa with a diagonal red bar across his beard are showing
up on the stalls of Vienna's outdoor Christmas markets, where
bundled-up shoppers browse for gifts while holding steaming cups of
hot mulled wine or spiked punch in mittened hands.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not really against Santa Claus. For some people, Santa
Claus has his qualities," said Phillip Tengg, 27, a former divinity
student who founded the Pro-Christkind (Pro-Christ Child) Society in
1998 in the western city of Innsbruck.</TE>
<TE>   "We're against the fact that Santa Claus has become an advertising
symbol of almost boundless consumption. It obscures the true meaning
of Christmas. He's displacing the traditional St. Nikolaus and the
Christ Child."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Austria's Christmas traditions can be a bit
bewildering to outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   The season begins Dec. 5 when a horned, fur-clad beast known as
Krampus mock-rampages through streets and malls, terrorizing small
children with switches and chains, and trying to scoop them into his
bucket. The next day, St. Nikolaus arrives wearing a bishop's miter
and delivers biscuits and sweets.</TE>
<TE>   On Christmas Eve, the Christkind, or Christ Child, sneaks into
homes and deposits presents under the tree. On Dec. 25, families
gather for a traditional meal of baked carp.</TE>
<TE>   Tengg's group, which claims about 100 members from Austria,
Germany and Switzerland, is alarmed at all the Santas and reindeer
popping up at Christmas markets devoted to nativity scenes and
angels.</TE>
<TE>   The backlash resonates among Austrians like Lydia Krebs, who takes
pride in the traditions observed in this overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic country where priest Joseph Mohr wrote "Silent Night" --
originally "Stille Nacht! Heilige Nacht!" -- in 1816.</TE>
<TE>   "Our Christmas traditions are so beautiful, and Santa takes
something away from them," she said from behind her stand of
glass-blown ornaments, gingerbread houses and miniature creches. "My
sister lives in Atlanta, and Christmas is so awful there -- so
hectic, and so many lights. It's just too commercial."</TE>
<TE>   On its Web site, Pro-Christkind says it wants to encourage
"critical reflection over trends like Santa Claus" and hopes that
Austrians "will understand that Christmas is a celebration of people
and God, not a consumer frenzy."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the movement is supported by the Archdiocese of
Vienna, which is struggling to woo back the 80% of Austrians who
think of themselves as Catholics but rarely, if ever, attend Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Pro-Christkind's members include Bishop Alois Kothgasser, who told
Austrian radio recently that he considers himself "pro-Christ Child
and anti-Santa."</TE>
<TE>   Kath.Net, a group of German-speaking Catholic believers, applauds
"the protest against the pervasive Santa Claus."</TE>
<TE>   Besides its sticker campaign ("We Believe in the Christ Child"),
Pro-Christkind is urging Austrians inclined to e-mail their holiday
greetings to consider its Christ Child e-cards.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is hotly debated in the group's chat room.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll say it just once: Beat it, Santa!" wrote a woman who gave
her name only as Eva.</TE>
<TE>   "Your pseudo-religious blah-blah is priceless," retorted a man
called Jeff.</TE>
<TE>   Martina Voigt, a Pro-Christkind leader, says it is signing up 20
new members every day.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have anything against Santa Claus," Voigt told the daily
Tiroler Tageszeitung. "We just don't want him to control everything."</TE>

<HD>South Africa's Working Poor Struggling to Feed Families</HD>
<DH>Prices have doubled and tripled since January. Currency
depreciation and demand for grain in neighboring drought- stricken
countries are partly to blame.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Misean Curtis</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>DIEPSLOOT, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Just last year, Tyrone Valoyi earned more than enough as an
electrician to feed his wife and seven children a hearty dinner of
chicken and gravy several times a week.</LD>
<LD>   He still has his job, but now they are lucky to get meat once a
month.</LD>
<LD>   Skyrocketing food prices over the past year have forced many South
Africans who once made a decent living to struggle to feed their
families.</LD>
<TE>   "I have to rely on handouts from people," said Valoyi, whose
family lives in a two-room tin shack in Diepsloot, a township just
outside Johannesburg.</TE>
<TE>   Although this country has been relatively unscathed by a drought
that has been partly blamed for a hunger crisis in six nearby
nations, poor South Africans are facing a crisis of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Food prices have doubled and, for some goods, tripled since
January. The increases have been particularly steep for staples such
as cornmeal that comprise a good part of the diet of the poor.</TE>
<TE>   The surge has been blamed in part on the depreciation of South
Africa's currency, the rand, and also on the huge increase in demand
for grain because of food shortages in the six neighboring countries.</TE>
<TE>   While those who've long been without jobs continue their daily
struggle to survive, it is the working poor who suddenly find
themselves confronted with bitter lives that they worked so hard to
avoid.</TE>
<TE>   Valoyi now spends more than two-thirds of his monthly pay of 2,800
rand ($280) -- well above what many poor earn -- to buy cornmeal,
milk and vegetables for his family.</TE>
<TE>   To afford even that, Valoyi, 58, has had to cut back on other
necessities. Instead of paying the equivalent of 80 cents a day to
take a minibus to work, he walks an hour each way.</TE>
<TE>   At an upscale supermarket in a wealthy northern suburb of
Johannesburg, Patricia Langa, 25, buffs a glass case containing
apricot truffles and other pricey delicacies that she could never
afford.</TE>
<TE>   The sole breadwinner for her family of six, Langa says buying food
takes 70% of the $85 she earns a month as an assistant baker.</TE>
<TE>   She struggles to stretch the $25 left over to pay for clothes,
health care, school fees and other things for two adults and four
children.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother is out of work, and I have to spend so much money on
food. It's really hurting," Langa said.</TE>
<TE>   In a country where more than 30% of the population is unemployed,
many are much worse off than Langa.</TE>
<TE>   Reacting to calls for help, South Africa's government agreed to
increase social aid, but only a slight boost in the monthly child
support grant -- from $13 to $14. It said it would look into setting
up grain reserves to offset potential price spikes in the future.</TE>
<TE>   The government also announced a plan by private companies to offer
1,000 tons of cornmeal a month at nearly half price.</TE>
<TE>   The measures have received a mixed reception. Business leaders
were relieved that the government did not institute price controls or
subsidies that might damage the market, but many poor people believe
that the government is not doing nearly enough.</TE>
<TE>   "If the government really wants to help us, it should subsidize
all basic foods, including milk and potatoes, and it should make the
child support grant a little higher," said Cleophas Khumalo, 30, a
clerical worker.</TE>
<TE>   The Congress of South African Trade Unions says the government
initiatives were a step in the right direction, but more needs to be
done.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcome any measure by the government that will help save
lives by offering food and economic aid. However, our concern is that
bureaucracy and local corruption may prevent it from reaching the
people who need it the most," said Patrick Craven, a trade union
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials say South Africans must learn to rely on
themselves and should look into starting community vegetable gardens
to help feed themselves.</TE>

<HD>Climber Puts Mountains Within Orphans' Reach</HD>

<DL>BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan</DL>
<LD>The craggy, snow-covered peaks of the Tien Shan mountains seem
tantalizingly close from the dusty soccer field at the
Voenno-Antonovksy Children's Home.</LD>
<LD>   But they were impossibly out of reach for the orphanage's children
-- until Garth Willis came to town.</LD>
<LD>   Combining his love of climbing nurtured in the Kyrgyz mountains
with a passion to help children in this former Soviet republic,
Willis started a nonprofit group that is making the country's
richness in alpine terrain accessible to poor youngsters.</LD>
<TE>   About 200 children have taken trips with the Alpine Fund since it
was founded nearly two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Willis, from St. Paul, Minn., originally hoped to train children
as mountain guides so that they could find work. But he quickly
realized that they lacked many basic skills and has expanded the
program to include English lessons and internships at the Alpine Fund
office.</TE>
<TE>   The fund's special targets are older children about to graduate
from the orphanage, who also get frank talks about the facts of life
and AIDS education during their mountain treks.</TE>
<TE>   "They're so sheltered. When they leave here, they're not ready for
life at all," said Willis, 38.</TE>
<TE>   Yegor Kasatkin, 15, has been at the orphanage since he was 6. He
has been on 15 trips with the Alpine Fund, hiking and learning about
nature, playing games and singing camp songs.</TE>
<TE>   "There it's beautiful; the air is fresh and everything's nice,"
Yegor said. "It's more interesting and you can see beautiful things."</TE>
<TE>   He said he wants to be a car mechanic or welder when he leaves the
orphanage in about a year, but also said he could see himself trying
for a career as a mountain guide.</TE>
<TE>   Willis first came to Kyrgyzstan in 1995, planning to stay six
months to learn Russian and climb the peaks here that attract
alpinists from all over the world. He ended up staying three years,
teaching English, helping create a debate club program at schools and
founding a college newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   After returning to the United States to complete graduate studies
in international education development at Boston University, Willis
sought a U.S. State Department grant to return to Kyrgyzstan. He
admitted that the interviewers were skeptical, asking: "How do we
know you're not just going climbing?"</TE>
<TE>   He said he persuaded them that "I care about the country and the
people," and soon was on his way back to Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the lure of the mountains proved too great, he sheepishly
admits. He says he went climbing for two months when he first
returned in August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But when he got back to the capital, Bishkek, Willis saw a
UNICEF-financed film about the Voenno-Antonovksy Orphanage, called
the U.N. agency and got in touch with the film's producers. Within
two weeks, he had a fully financed group going.</TE>
<TE>   Willis still gets grants from UNICEF as well as about $5,000 from
private donors in the United States, where the Alpine Fund is a
legally registered nonprofit organization.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving at the orphanage recently for a game of pickup soccer
with some volunteers, Willis was greeted by children who hugged him
and shook his hand.</TE>
<TE>   Zamir Momunaleyev, deputy director of the orphanage, said the home
embraced the opportunity when Willis offered to take children on
trips to the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "I first saw a person who was well-meaning, who had a way with
children," said Momunaleyev, whose center is home to 118 children
ages 7 to 16.</TE>
<TE>   Without the Alpine Fund, Momunaleyev said trips to the mountains
would be only a dream. Although the orphanage is financed by the
state, its officials still need outside donations to afford such
essentials as clothes and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   With increased attention on Central Asia after the Sept. 11
attacks, Willis hopes that the Alpine Fund will attract more notice.
American troops based at Manas airport near Bishkek for
anti-terrorist operations in nearby Afghanistan have joined in some
of the training sessions with children.</TE>
<TE>   In the southern city of Osh, the Alpine Fund supports a local
alpine guide who takes street children on mountain trips. Danfung
Dennis, 20, of Ithaca, N.Y., volunteered there over the summer and is
taking the fall semester off from Cornell University to keep working
with the group.</TE>
<TE>   He said the children really come alive when they head to the
peaks.</TE>
<TE>   "Going to these mountains that they've seen all the time but never
had a chance to go to, it's a thrill," Dennis said.</TE>

<HD>Hussein's Words of Wisdom Are Black and Read All Over</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bassem Mroue</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Libya's Moammar Kadafi has his Green Book. China's Mao Tse-tung had
his "Little Red Book." Now, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has a
pocket-sized, white-bound pamphlet filled with his words of wisdom.</LD>
<LD>   Such as:</LD>
<LD>   "Don't be attracted to easy paths because the paths that make your
feet bleed are the only way to get ahead in life."</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the Iraqi Information Ministry brought out
"Saddam Hussein: Great Lessons, Commandments to Strugglers, the
Patient and Holy Warriors." Most Iraqis were already familiar with
the free pamphlet's contents, 57 quotations drawn from speeches made
by Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Since 2000, selections from the 57 commandments have been painted
on school walls, carved on statues, splashed across billboards,
framed and placed on the walls in government offices, printed in
Iraqi newspapers -- all of which are controlled by the state,
Hussein's Baath party or Hussein's son Odai.</TE>
<TE>   The Muslim call to prayer is broadcast on state television in Iraq
and, after every call -- five times daily -- a few of the
commandments are read.</TE>
<TE>   Saddam's commandments cover all aspects of life. He advises
against making decisions in anger or humiliating an enemy after
defeating him. He calls for doing good, depending on brains as well
as brawn, ruling fairly, planning well, keeping people's secrets and
learning from others' mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   At Baghdad's Al-Quds Elementary School, the commandments are
painted in black and red on the walls of the entrance and in the
classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "Who is going to recite for us one of the leader's commandments?"
Al-Quds Principal Khawla al-Ani said after introducing a reporter to
a class of earnest little girls.</TE>
<TE>   Seven-year-old Ilaf Marwan raised her hand, then stood and recited
confidently: "Keep your eyes on your enemy and be faster than him."</TE>
<TE>   Her teacher apologized because the classroom, decorated with a
poster of Hussein, was dim. There was no electricity, the teacher
said, because of the U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   Sabih Fakher, an Information Ministry official who helped compile
the pamphlet, said the commandments are "very important lessons to
the people of Iraq in the shadow of the continuous aggression and the
unjust siege."</TE>
<TE>   Al-Ani called Hussein's commandments "lessons from the heart to
the heart."</TE>
<TE>   Such praise for Hussein is common in Iraq, where criticism of him
can bring jail or worse. The United States may consider him a
stockpiler of weapons of mass destruction who gives terrorists a
haven and heads an "axis of evil." But in Iraq, according to the
blurb on his pamphlet, he is a "great son" of the Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has threatened to topple Hussein's government if
he does not cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq denies it has such weapons. The United States and Britain
insist that he is hiding some.</TE>
<TE>   If Hussein is seeking advice as the standoff intensifies, he might
turn to Page 11 of his pamphlet:</TE>
<TE>   "Don't provoke a snake unless you have the intention and power to
cut off its head."</TE>

<TE>   Saddam Says ...</TE>
<TE>   Selections from "Saddam Hussein: Great Lessons, Commandments to
Strugglers, the Patient and Holy Warriors," an Iraqi Information
Ministry pamphlet that quotes from Hussein's speeches.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't let he who thinks you despise him get close to you.</TE>
<TE>   * If you rule, rule in a fair way, and don't let your heart take
part in the ruling, or let a criminal who cannot be rehabilitated
escape punishment.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't treat your friend and your enemy equally even if you
reconcile with the second. That way your enemy doesn't scorn you and
your friend doesn't look down on the meaning of friendship and its
rights.</TE>

<HD>Baby Languishes in Orphanage After Adoption Ban</HD>
<DH>Romania acted after it was accused of being a marketplace
for children. But critics doubt that the result benefits youngsters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Danica Kirka</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>BUCHAREST, Romania</DL>
<LD>Spania Bancuta has been alive for three months and alone almost as
long -- ever since her mother dropped her off at a children's
hospital in Bucharest and never returned.</LD>
<LD>   But it may be awhile before the Gypsy girl with placid dark eyes
can leave her steel crib in Room 5.</LD>
<LD>   Like thousands of other children, Spania isn't eligible for
adoption abroad because of a temporary ban imposed by the Romanian
government that has outraged Western couples trying to adopt, and
prompted concerns from aid workers that youngsters are being
condemned to stay in orphanages.</LD>
<TE>   "The longer they delay the foreign adoption law, the more serious
it is for the children," said Sister Mary Rose Christy, a Roman
Catholic nun from Burlingame, Calif., who works in Romania. "That's
who is being hurt: the children."</TE>
<TE>   Romania ordered the ban in June 2001 after the European Union
claimed that the impoverished Balkan country had become a marketplace
for children and would have a harder time winning membership in the
prosperous 15-nation bloc.</TE>
<TE>   The ban put the EU at odds with the United States, which sided
with American, Israeli, Spanish and French couples trying to adopt.
While the United States agreed that the system didn't always protect
the rights of children, U.S. Ambassador Michael Guest said his
government's interest was to place the children in loving families.</TE>
<TE>   Baroness Emma Nicholson, the British EU official pushing Romania
to toughen its laws, says Romania is vulnerable to mobsters preying
on children. Americans would never allow their children to be
exported the way Romania does, and "should afford the same respect to
Romanian families as their own."</TE>
<TE>   One of the worst scandals to emerge with communism's collapse in
eastern Europe was the plight of abandoned children, nowhere more so
than in Romania. Dictator Nicolae Ceausescu had outlawed abortion and
birth control, and families who couldn't feed their children handed
them off to the state.</TE>
<TE>   The images of starving and bereft children in state institutions
shocked the world, and humanitarian agencies poured in.</TE>
<TE>   The EU advocates limiting foreign adoption to a last resort, after
foster care or local adoption has failed. Efforts should concentrate
on giving children a good home by Romanian standards, Nicholson said.</TE>
<TE>   The ban is due to expire in February, but could be extended if a
new adoption law isn't passed. Legislators are awaiting EU input
before tackling it.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the ban's opponents have won little sympathy from
Romania's leadership, including President Ion Iliescu.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans should produce their own children," he said recently.
"If they want children, they should go to countries with high
birthrates.... Our main goal is to improve conditions for all
children in our country."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 84,000 children in state care are not orphans but
youngsters whose parents visit periodically to retain custody rights,
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   To pay for the strain on state coffers, the government in 1998
began allowing adoption agencies to donate funds to the child welfare
system in exchange for the right to parcel out the most adoptable
children -- especially babies. But in a country where the average
monthly wage is $130, the cash proved too tempting. "Adoption was an
area with a lot of corruption," Prime Minister Adrian Nastase said.
Before the ban, he said, Romanian orphans had been sold via the
Internet for as much as $50,000, and the state had no power to
intervene. He didn't elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   With international aid, the system is slowly improving. Facilities
at orphanages are better, as is the ratio of caretakers to children.
The number of children in state orphanages has fallen dramatically
from the 100,000 in Ceausescu's time, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   About 43,000 children now live in state institutions, compared
with 57,000 last year. An additional 41,000 are living in foster
families or with relatives, government statistics show.</TE>
<TE>   The total number of domestic and foreign adoptions fell from 4,254
in 2000 to 2,795 last year; there had been 1,060 through August this
year. But up to 3,500 children eligible for adoption abroad have been
left in limbo since the ban was imposed.</TE>
<TE>   Some exceptions were made for children whose paperwork was in
process, but the ban stunned couples like John and Amanda Murrow of
Six Mile, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   They had heard about a little Gypsy girl they've named Samantha
from a friend working with street children in Romania. The aid worker
found neighborhood kids in the village of Bahnea, 200 miles northwest
of the capital, playing catch with what he thought was a doll. It
turned out to be a 3-month-old girl.</TE>
<TE>   Rescued near death, she is now 15 months old and with a foster
family. The Murrows are sending aid.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in God's time we will adopt her," Murrow said. "It
feels like she is part of us already. She just hasn't joined us yet."</TE>
<TE>   Children like Samantha and Spania also have almost no hope of
being adopted in Romania, where prejudice against the Gypsy, or Roma,
minority runs deep.</TE>
<TE>   Spania came to the abandoned babies' ward at the Caraiman
Childrens' Hospital with syphilis, which has abated with treatment.
Welfare workers promise she will be moved soon.</TE>
<TE>   Social worker Georgeta Ciobanu is trying to find Spania's parents
to see if they really want to give her up for good. Meanwhile, she
visits her whenever she can, cuddling the little girl in her
butter-colored blanket. "She likes to be held," Ciobanu said.</TE>
<TE>   Child-care advocates say the legal delays are devastating for the
children. Sister Christy says that by the time a child is 7 years
old, much of his or her development has taken place and been stunted
by orphanage life.</TE>
<TE>   "The basic thing you don't get in an institution is love," she
said. "Those children never have a feeling of security and it affects
their whole life."</TE>
<TE>   Take Alexandru Soare. He's only 9, yet savvy enough to approach
any prospective adopter with suspicion. "I would make them show me
identification," Alexandru said. "So they wouldn't steal me," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his age, there's another complication -- he has a brother
and sister, and they come as a package, having stuck together ever
since their mother dumped them eight years ago and told them that she
wanted nothing more to do with them.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Alexandru, his 14-year-old brother, Mihai, and their
sister, Mirela, 16, still hope for a miracle.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are people with a good heart," Mirela said. "I
wouldn't mind being adopted into such a family."</TE>

<HD>Oregon Site Casts Doubt on Land-Crossing Theory</HD>
<DH>Discovery could mean North America's early human
inhabitants arrived by sea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph B. Frazier</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Researchers have found traces of a human presence on the Oregon coast
dating to more than 10,000 years ago, raising the area's importance
for those who study the peopling of the Americas.</LD>
<LD>   The findings at the Indian Sands site in Boardman State Park are
more than 2,000 years older than previous discoveries along the
Oregon coast. The site, about 12 miles north of Brookings, was
excavated in August by a team of researchers from Oregon State
University.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery, which dates to the end of the last Ice Age, also
lends weight to the theory that early inhabitants might have arrived
by sea, rather than by land.</LD>
<TE>   The discovery puts their arrival around the time that inland
inhabitants arrived, bringing into question the theory that all of
the earliest inhabitants crossed the Bering Strait and moved south
overland to what is now the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Excavators also found tools made of local materials and charcoal.</TE>
<TE>   Roberta Hall, an Oregon State University anthropology professor,
led the excavation team along with Loren Davis, a geoarcheologist and
anthropology instructor at the university. Hall said the information
will help tribal people, including the Confederated Tribes of Siletz
and the Coquille Indian Tribe, learn about their ancestors and the
challenges they faced. The tribes are collaborators in the research.</TE>
<TE>   The findings are about the same age as a few sites in coastal
Alaska, British Columbia and California. Determining the number of
people who lived at the Indian Sands site, and for how long, would
require a huge excavation, Hall said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we did was just a preliminary test to see whether deposits
from the late Pleistocene were preserved," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The team used three years of soil, geologic and other research as
part of a different method of finding traces of the ancient people.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, researchers note early signs of human activity and dig
there. This project, however, involved analyzing sediments to figure
out where they might find preserved materials and identifying
attractive places where people would have wanted to live.</TE>
<TE>   Hall said the discovery vindicates the newer research method.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian Sands site is on the coast now, but Hall's group
determined that it was a mile or so inland 10,000 years ago. At that
time, she said, the coastline would have been well west of where it
is today. The coastline didn't establish its modern location until
about 6,000 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a rocky outcrop, a really good source of quarry material,"
Davis said. "They would have come inland for that."</TE>
<TE>   Hall said erosion and civilization complicated the archeologists'
work because they could find only undisturbed sediments in a small
area. She said researchers found the tools, obsidian chips and
charcoal about a yard down.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said that the tools appear to have been made of native
materials but that the obsidian, although common inland in the Oregon
Cascades and elsewhere, does not occur along the coast. Further tests
will determine its source and possibly reveal the mobility and trade
patterns of the early people, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Carbon-dating of charcoal indicated the site was 10,430 years old.
But when the numbers are recalibrated, she said, they come out to
more than 12,000 years.</TE>

<HD>Rx for Shortage of Nurses: More Teachers</HD>
<DH>A shortfall of more than 800,000 nurses is projected by
2020. But schools lack funds and faculty, so they turn away good
students.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>YAKIMA, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Hospitals across the country are desperately seeking nurses like
Tracey Rasmussen, a 34-year-old mom with a warm, down-to-earth
bedside manner and a 3.9 GPA.</LD>
<LD>   But she was rejected twice from nursing school -- one of thousands
of qualified would-be nurses turned away each year because nursing
colleges lack space, faculty and funding.</LD>
<LD>   Anyone who has spent time in a hospital lately knows about the
nation's nursing shortage. By 2020, the shortage is expected to grow
to nearly 30%, a shortfall of more than 800,000 nurses nationwide,
according to projections by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services.</LD>
<TE>   Finding people who want to be nurses isn't hard. Getting them into
nursing schools is.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so frustrating," said Rasmussen, who was finally accepted
into Washington State University's Yakima nursing program and has a
job waiting for her in the maternity ward of a local hospital when
she graduates in May.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the looming shortage, nursing schools in the United States
turned away nearly 6,000 qualified applicants last year, according to
a survey by the American Assn. of Colleges of Nursing.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them will reapply. Some of them go to other schools,
community colleges and private schools. A significant pool will be
lost to nursing," Dorothy Detlor, dean of Washington State's College
of Nursing, said of the two-thirds of qualified applicants her
program rejects each year. "It's a serious problem across the
country."</TE>
<TE>   A generation ago, women had few options in the workplace beyond
nurse, teacher or secretary. As opportunities expanded, the allure of
nursing faded. The outdated Florence Nightingale image didn't help
attract young people to what has become a high-tech career. Over the
past two decades, nursing schools have struggled at times to recruit
students.</TE>
<TE>   But nursing today has overcome its history and image problem. In a
struggling economy, nobody sneers at a profession that offers college
graduates multiple job offers with starting salaries of up to $60,000
in some areas. The median annual salary for nurses was $45,000 two
years ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' most recent
data.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gotten the message out there that nursing is an exciting
career," said Kathleen Ann Long, dean of the College of Nursing at
the University of Florida and president of the American Assn. of
Colleges of Nursing. "That's the good news."</TE>
<TE>   The bad news is that there's not enough faculty.</TE>
<TE>   Nurses are in such high demand that they invariably must take a
pay cut to teach. A 2001 salary survey found that nurses with
master's degrees earn an average of $24,000 more in practice than
they do teaching.</TE>
<TE>   "The universities are just not able to compete," said Johnie
Mozingo, associate dean of academic affairs at the University of
Tennessee College of Nursing, which rejected half its nursing
applicants this year.</TE>
<TE>   Cramming more students into classes isn't an option. Most states
mandate student-teacher ratios of 12-to-1 or less, especially for
hands-on classes.</TE>
<TE>   The average age of nursing faculty nationally is 51. When the
current generation retires, replacements will be hard to find.</TE>
<TE>   "Without those faculty, we cannot prepare the nurses of the
future," Long said.</TE>
<TE>   To expand programs, nursing schools need more money.
Unfortunately, most rely heavily on state budgets, which are facing
their worst crisis in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Educating a nurse costs more than training the average liberal
arts major, and nursing schools compete for limited dollars within
universities. At Washington State, for example, tuition and state
funds pay $8,200 per student -- but it costs $20,000 a year to
educate nurses. Other departments end up subsidizing nursing schools.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Congress passed the Nursing Reinvestment Act in
a bid to ease the shortage. The measure, signed into law by President
Bush, expands scholarships, offers grants for nursing schools, and
includes loan forgiveness for nurses who earn advanced degrees and
become teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Nursing educators applaud the law, but with their fingers crossed,
as they wait to see whether Congress puts money behind it. The House
Appropriations Committee will determine funding next year.</TE>
<TE>   The new law alone won't solve the problem. In many areas,
hospitals are stepping in to expand nursing programs when government
funding falls short.</TE>
<TE>   In Ohio, Cleveland State University will start a fast-track
nursing degree program this spring, backed financially by the
Cleveland Clinic Health System.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina Baptist Hospital is giving Winston-Salem State
University $750,000 to hire more nursing faculty members for an
accelerated nursing program that starts in January.</TE>
<TE>   And in Alaska, five hospitals and health care agencies have
promised the University of Alaska $1.8 million to double the number
of nursing graduates.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals have a keen interest in producing more nurses: Studies
show that when hospitals cut nursing staff and increase workloads,
patient deaths increase. But they also have tight budgets to
consider.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of looking at those scarce resources and investing
them where you're going to get the most benefit," said Pamela
Thompson, chief executive of the American Organization of Nurse
Executives, a subsidiary of the American Hospital Assn. "Hospitals
only have so much money."</TE>
<TE>   Nursing experts agree that there's no magic solution. They say
expanding enrollments at nursing colleges will require time, money
and attention from states, the federal government, private health
agencies -- as well as patients and families who expect a nurse to
answer when they press that hospital call button.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pressed to the wall, and it's going to take maybe one
crisis to push us over the edge," said Laura Dzurec, University of
Connecticut School of Nursing dean. "It's a huge need and,
unfortunately, it's an invisible need. There isn't anything more
essential than this."</TE>

<HD>In These Barbershops, Men Can Feel Like Men</HD>
<DH>Upscale salons pamper guys by offering everything from a
manicure to a beer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Polier</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>John Ziemba was relaxing over a game of pool, frosty beer in hand,
killing a little time before a business dinner.</LD>
<LD>   He had come to John Allan's Men's Club for a shoeshine too. And if
he had time, maybe a haircut or manicure. It was a typical visit to
the salon for the 26-year-old investment banker -- a trip he makes at
least once a week.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not like a girl's salon," he said. "This is a guy's place.
Guys had nowhere to go until now."</LD>
<TE>   Upscale men's grooming lounges have become common in cities
throughout the country -- a growing effort to lure young men to what
are, in essence, the classic American barbershop with a bit of
21st-century shine.</TE>
<TE>   Advertised as "honoring the sanctity of old-style barbershops
while providing the modern amenities of a full-service salon," John
Allan's in Manhattan has created a world where men feel like men,
even when being pampered.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to go backward," owner John Allan said.</TE>
<TE>   Allan's 20-year career in the salon business gave him the perfect
perspective on the needs of men and the lack of services available.
"I decided to fill a void," he said. "I wanted guys to look good and
feel comfortable -- and to reinstate the sense of community that my
grandfather had in the 1930s."</TE>
<TE>   Barbershops and what they meant to mid-century Americana were all
but extinct in the last few decades. The MGM movie, "Barbershop," has
brought this tradition back into the spotlight, illustrating the
social and political importance these shops have on men's lives.</TE>
<TE>   "For decades, the barbershop was a rite of passage for a young
man, a tradition passed down from father to son," said Tom Haulter,
owner of Everyday Joe's in Brownsburg, Ind. "We are rebuilding that
sense of community in the shop."</TE>
<TE>   His new shop just outside Indianapolis has attracted more than
1,300 clients in 10 months, ranging from blue-collar workers to
celebrity race car drivers. But it's not just the haircut that keeps
them coming back.</TE>
<TE>   "It brought back a lot of memories," said Dan Anderson, a
corporate technology salesman. "Men were sitting around chatting
about sports and politics. It had that old throwback feel to it."</TE>
<TE>   When Haulter, a master barber, cut Anderson's hair, Anderson
noticed a difference immediately. The difference is about 3 1/2 years
of training. A beautician's license in the state of New York requires
six months of training; a barber's license takes four years.</TE>
<TE>   Well-trained barbers are a dying breed, said Adrian Wood, master
barber and owner of the Paul Mole Barber Shop, which has been a
neighborhood fixture for almost 30 years. But the trend toward
upscale barbershops is certainly on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   "Men are rushing back to the barbershops," he said. "Our business
has increased incredibly over the last year."</TE>
<TE>   His formula for success is simple: Treat men like men.</TE>
<TE>   Wood doesn't attract the same type of clientele as some of the new
shops, which are entertainment-driven.</TE>
<TE>   Everyday Joe's draws a big crowd on Monday nights with prime-time
football. Haulter turns on his 70-inch big-screen TV, flips some
burgers and hot dogs, and cuts hair. He also gives hot-lather
straight-razor shaves.</TE>
<TE>   Shorty's in West Hollywood seems more like a dance club than a
men's hair salon. Sporting walls of graffiti, vintage furniture and
hip clientele, Shorty's has also become a music promoter for
up-and-coming disc jockeys. Many of the customers come in to find out
what's new in music, what's going on around town.</TE>
<TE>   "Shorty's is anti-foofy," owner Christopher Bair said. "It's about
convenience as well as comfort. It's a place for guys who care about
what they look like."</TE>
<TE>   Men do care, and they're paying for it -- $16 at Shorty's and $18
at Everyday Joe's for a haircut, $61 at John Allan's, where a shoe
shine and manicure are thrown in.</TE>
<TE>   Still, these services cost a fraction of the price they would at
unisex salons.</TE>

<HD>Ben Franklin's DNA Is on a Wish List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David B. Caruso</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>An amateur genealogist wants to create a way for people to find out
whether they're descended from Benjamin Franklin and he needs some
DNA to do it.</LD>
<LD>   One possibility would be digging up Franklin's bones, which have
been buried for 212 years near Independence Hall. Since that seems
unlikely, L. David Rober is focusing instead on men with
well-documented ties to the statesman and inventor.</LD>
<LD>   Roper says all he needs from the candidates is a simple, $150
analysis of their Y chromosomes -- genetic material handed down from
fathers to sons.</LD>
<TE>   Y chromosomes change infrequently from generation to generation.
Even after two centuries, males related to Franklin would have nearly
identical ones, Roper said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is as close as we can get to Benjamin's DNA without exhuming
him or finding one of his teeth," said Roper, a retired Virginia Tech
physics professor who lives in Blacksburg, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Roper said he doesn't know of any practical use for his research,
though it could smash or support a bit of family mythology. His
mother is a Franklin and he plans to test himself.</TE>
<TE>   In the decades after his death, rumors flew that Franklin, a
printer and philosopher who persuaded France to enter the
Revolutionary War and helped craft the Constitution, may have
fathered several children out of wedlock.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a call from a guy who thinks he is descended from an
illegitimate son of Benjamin's," Roper said. "Who knows? Maybe it's
true. This would tell us."</TE>
<TE>   Donors would pay the $150 fee, which would go to the lab that does
the testing.</TE>
<TE>   DNA sampling is painless, requiring only a few cells swabbed from
the inside of the cheek, but it does have limitations, said Dr. Scott
Woodward, a Brigham Young University professor and expert on
molecular genealogy.</TE>
<TE>   Y chromosomes only reveal whether someone is related to another
person, not whether he is directly descended from him, he said. The
tests don't work for women, who have no Y chromosome and whose X
chromosomes change more frequently from generation to generation.</TE>

<HD>Experiment Shows Diverse Plant Life Is Good for Planet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Williams</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>EAST BETHEL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>William Cooper leaned through the door of a tiny airplane in 1930 and
looked down on a patchwork of forest, bog and prairie. Even from that
height, he recognized the promise of the unusual collection of
ecosystems.</LD>
<LD>   He didn't, however, do a very good job of remembering its
location. The pioneering ecologist and other researchers spent years
before they figured out where it was and acquired the land. They gave
it to the University of Minnesota in 1942.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, researchers have done more than 100 experiments on its
nine square miles in an effort to understand the nation's ecosystems.</LD>
<TE>   "All the major ecosystems in the [northern] states are here; we
can get information for the ecosystems from the Rockies to Maine,"
said David Tilman, who directs the Cedar Creek Natural History Area,
one of the most studied pieces of ground.</TE>
<TE>   The diverse terrain, 30 miles north of the Twin Cities, includes a
rare oak savanna, and spruce and pine forests. The Cedar Creek
wetlands snake across it. There's a bog, a lake and fallow farm
fields.</TE>
<TE>   Tilman, an ecologist at the university, said researchers began
work by recording information about the area's plants, insects and
animals. As a result, researchers have a baseline of information on
the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Experiments have yielded a steady stream of papers in prominent
scientific journals. Topics include the effects of forest fires,
nitrogen pollution and benefits of biological diversity.</TE>
<TE>   In one experiment, Tilman and his colleagues planted a field in a
checkerboard of different combinations of wild plants. They found
that plots with more kinds of plants were more productive and hardier
than plots with smaller combinations.</TE>
<TE>   Research also shows broad mixes of native plants absorb more
carbon dioxide, make better use of nutrients, are more resistant to
disease and resist invading species better than a single species on
its own.</TE>
<TE>   The results have global implications because humanity has altered
ecosystems by reducing diversity and introducing foreign plants. The
catalyst has been the massive addition of carbon dioxide and nitrogen
into the air and soil, Tilman said. Nitrogen in the soil prompts
tremendous growth in some species, which choke out others. Carbon
dioxide and nitrogen enter the air from burning fossil fuels, but
most nitrogen in the ground is from fertilizer.</TE>
<TE>   Tilman's colleague at the university, Peter Reich, is conducting
an experiment that examines how plants react to increased nitrogen
and carbon dioxide. It is called BioCon -- for biodiversity, carbon
dioxide and nitrogen.</TE>
<TE>   White plastic pipes form a fence around six large rings of plants.
Inside the rings, he has planted and divided different combinations
of plants. Reich and his students fertilized some plots with nitrogen
while the pipes vent carefully regulated amounts of carbon dioxide
over the rings.</TE>
<TE>   "This experiment is a time machine of a sort," Tilman said.</TE>
<TE>   Reich said that since the experiment started in 1998, he has found
that plots with the most diverse group of plants absorb more carbon
dioxide, which is harmful to people, than plots with fewer plants.</TE>
<TE>   The results so far suggest that highly diverse ecosystems will do
a better job of turning carbon dioxide into oxygen than less-diverse
ecosystems.</TE>
<TE>   Tilman's experiments have brought scientific rigor to
environmental debates, said Laura Huenneke, chairwoman of the biology
department at New Mexico State University.</TE>
<TE>   "Ecology has this reputation for running about in the streets
shouting alarm about the negative impacts of losing species and
diversity reduction, but we've been shockingly remiss in supplying
any hard experimental data to demonstrate the environmental impact,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Dave Tilman has certainly been at the forefront of those who have
pushed for careful experimentation as a direct attack on this
question," she said.</TE>

<HD>Chipping at Fossils for Global Warming's Toll</HD>
<DH>Scientist studies excavations from period of mass
extinction 200 million years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brandon Loomis</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Jennifer McElwain will spend the next year chipping her way through
more than a ton of sediment and plant fossils at the Field Museum,
hoping to find rock-solid evidence of global warming's ecological
toll.</LD>
<LD>   McElwain, a paleobotanist at the natural history museum, led a
team of scientists who collected more than 1,000 fossils during a
one-month expedition to Greenland funded by the National Geographic
Society.</LD>
<LD>   The fossils span a period of mass extinction and recovery that
started more than 200 million years ago -- a period that some
scientists blame in part on high levels of carbon dioxide that led to
global warming. By examining the pores on leaves, she hopes to
predict roughly what would happen to today's plants and animals if
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles during this century, as some
predict.</LD>
<TE>   "It could be that we find plants are really happy and they sail
through extreme warming," McElwain said. "I don't think that's going
to be the case."</TE>
<TE>   A former researcher at the University of Sheffield, England,
McElwain previously studied a lesser collection of ancient ferns,
ginkgoes and other fossils from before the age dominated by
dinosaurs. She found that as the years progressed during the mass
extinction between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, the number of
pores per leaf declined.</TE>
<TE>   Laboratory research on modern plants shows that they respond to
high levels of carbon dioxide by developing fewer pores to suck up
the gas. And many scientists believe that carbon dioxide spewed from
volcanoes in the Atlantic Ocean as the continents drifted apart.</TE>
<TE>   Surviving plants also developed smaller or segmented leaves, which
McElwain believes indicates major global warming as the gas trapped
heat. Small leaves release more heat, helping plants stay cool.</TE>
<TE>   The specimens were hacked centimeter by centimeter out of Hurry
Fjord in Greenland. They await unpacking in a museum storage room.
The fjord's 990-foot cliff is a complete record of Triassic-Jurassic
plant life, laid down in layers by stream sediments and cut open by
glaciers.</TE>
<TE>   A protective resin helps leaf fossils retain some of their
original material instead of being replaced by rock entirely. As
McElwain removes their paper wrapping and brushes their surface, some
flake off the rock altogether, making them ready for the microscope.
Some of them came loose as soon as the rock was hammered from the
fjord.</TE>
<TE>   "When it was windy, you opened the rock and there were
200-million-year-old leaves flying around," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Others will have to be removed with acid before McElwain can count
pores.</TE>
<TE>   She and a student will spend the next year studying fossils from
increments of time to see how many species disappeared or lost
dominance -- and which others took their places. If she can determine
the changes wrought by a gas increase similar to the current one, it
may indicate how the world will change this century.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the idea," she said. "The problem with the idea is that
the plants that were around 200 million years ago are very
different."</TE>
<TE>   There are competing theories on what led to the disappearance of
life in the period that McElwain is studying.</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists believe that a layer of iridium around the Earth
from the period of the extinction indicates that a meteor impact
blacked out the sun -- much like the one often blamed for the later
extinction of dinosaurs.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Tanner, geology professor at Bloomsburg University in
Pennsylvania, acknowledged that carbon dioxide buildup and global
warming are the prevailing theories for what's viewed as Earth's
third-largest extinction. But he believes that it's just as likely
that the opposite -- global cooling -- killed off plants and the
animals that relied on them.</TE>

<HD>Miners Race a Fireball to Help Co-Workers</HD>
<DH>Confusion marks response to mining disaster. Company's
emergency procedures and federal inspections are questioned.</DH>
<SE>Last in a weekly serial documenting what happened during
America's worst mining disaster in nearly two decades.</SE>

<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>BROOKWOOD, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Gas was slowly gathering in the mine's Four Section. Half an hour
after the first explosion, it was once again a powder keg.</LD>
<LD>   By now, three miners from a neighboring work area had made their
way to Four Section and reached Gaston Adams Jr., the lone man who
had been too badly injured to walk.</LD>
<LD>   Clarence "Bit" Boyd and four men who joined him along the way were
in two manbuses, approaching the entrance to Four Section. Just
behind them, about a quarter of a mile from the section entrance, 11
miners gathered to decide what to do.</LD>
<TE>   Ricky Rose was there with seven others from his "belt crew." Dave
Blevins was there with two men he had found spraying tunnels with
flame-retarding rock dust. Many miners believed that the company had
been scrimping lately on fireproofing material, a charge that the
company denied.</TE>
<TE>   Blevins, one of the Jim Walter Resources No. 5 mine's most
respected foremen, took charge.</TE>
<TE>   He sent Rose and three others to find a telephone and alert the
control room that three injured men were on their way out. And he
asked for volunteers to go with him to fight the fire they believed
was burning in Four Section.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately, three men from the belt crew jumped on the bus. Jerry
Short was about to join them, but a friend stopped him. The
self-rescue apparatus, which was worn on their belts and converts
carbon monoxide into oxygen, wasn't designed for firefighting, the
friend said. It was meant for escape.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving three miners, including Short, behind to await Rose's
return, Blevins and his three volunteers drove toward danger, Boyd's
group already on the move ahead of him. Now a dozen men were inside
Four Section or approaching the entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Rose had ridden about two minutes, searching for a telephone, when
he bumped into a crew coming from the mine's main production area.
They needed to go help fight the fire, Rose told them. The longwall
crewmen couldn't believe what they were hearing. The control room,
they said, had just ordered them to evacuate.</TE>
<TE>   Rose didn't know what to make of that. Seconds later, out of the
corner of his eye, he saw dust swirling straight toward him down the
tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   Four Section had exploded again, 50 minutes after the first
explosion, this time much more powerfully. Superheated, 2,500-degree
flames barreled through the section at 900 feet per second. The blast
tossed a 12-ton scoop 80 feet against a coal rib, bent 3/4-inch
steel, leveled concrete ventilation walls. At the spot of ignition,
it tore out a crater 50 feet long and 30 feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   Eight men -- the three who had first reached Adams and Boyd's
group of five -- were hurled through the air. A 1,500-pound rock
landed on Adams.</TE>
<TE>   A ball of fire rushed over the eight so quickly that it barely
burned them, but it consumed all the oxygen in the section.</TE>
<TE>   Lying there in the darkness, in a fierce rain of debris and coal
dust, all eight suffocated.</TE>
<TE>   At the entrance to the section, a manbus carrying Blevins and two
volunteers was blown off its tracks. A wall of compressed air, moving
in front of the fireball, hurled the vehicle against a wall of coal.
The manbus slammed back down with two men still inside it and Blevins
beneath it, his chest crushed.</TE>
<TE>   A fraction of a second later, the fireball rushed past, sucking
the oxygen from the air.</TE>
<TE>   The fireball rolled on through the tunnels, setting equipment
afire and looking for an outlet. It found an airshaft, rocketed 2,100
feet straight up, blasted from the surface of the Earth and
momentarily lighted up the evening sky.</TE>
<TE>   By diverting the fireball, the shaft saved Rose's life.</TE>
<TE>   The swirling whirlwind he had seen coming through the tunnel
knocked him and the seven men around him off their feet, enveloping
them in a choking cloud of soot. With the dust came a sound -- the
loudest thunder Rose had ever heard. It sounded, he said later, like
the whole mine was falling in on him.</TE>
<TE>   Around him, Rose heard men yelling to get out. He felt his way
back to the manbus and flipped on the headlight switch. The soot was
so thick he couldn't tell if it was working. As others piled on, he
grabbed the gas lever and raced toward the mine entrance.</TE>
<TE>   A few hundred yards closer to the blast, Short and the other two
men who had been waiting for Rose to return scrambled to their feet.
Holding onto one another, they felt their way along the tracks in
pitch darkness for 15 minutes before finding clean air.</TE>
<TE>   There, they encountered a miner just arriving from another part of
the mine. The control room operator had told him that a ventilation
wall had fallen and sent him to help, he said. The others ordered him
to go back the way he had come.</TE>
<TE>   It took Rose and his group 20 minutes to reach the elevator shaft,
located 3 1/2 miles from Four Section. It was 6:30 p.m., and the
elevator cage was still up top.</TE>
<TE>   Rose grabbed the telephone: "You got people on the bottom that's
scared to death and want to come out."</TE>
<TE>   He called three times before the cage came.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The mine's trained rescue team interviewed the 19 miners who
escaped to learn what they were dealing with. Of the 32 men who had
been working the shift, 13 were still inside.</TE>
<TE>   About 8 p.m., rescuers entered the mine and moved cautiously
through the tunnels toward Four Section. They found Raymond Ashworth,
Blevins' third volunteer, near the section entrance. He was conscious
but burned from the top of his head to the soles of his feet.</TE>
<TE>   At 11:30 p.m., he was evacuated from the mine and airlifted to the
University of Alabama Medical Center in Birmingham. By the time his
wife, Cathy, got there, he had slipped into a coma.</TE>
<TE>   All she could do was ask the nurses to clean the coal dirt from
his swollen tongue. The next day, he died.</TE>
<TE>   At the entrance to Four Section, the searchers found the bodies of
Blevins and his two other men. They stopped and took air readings.
The methane concentration was high. So was carbon monoxide,
indicating that the section was still burning.</TE>
<TE>   The searchers were in the barrel of a gun that was primed to go
off again. About 6:30 a.m., with no hope of finding more survivors,
the rescue team pulled out.</TE>
<TE>   That morning, the mine was flooded to put out fires raging in the
tunnels. Once the fires were extinguished, the water was pumped out.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next few months, searchers explored the mine piece by
piece. Working in short shifts to avoid heat exhaustion, they would
creep along a few hundred feet, halt and build a temporary seal so
they could ventilate the section. Then they would explore another few
hundred feet, stop and do the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 2, more than five weeks after the explosion, searchers
recovered three bodies at the entrance to Four Section. Six days
later, the last nine bodies were found.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The mine reopened in mid-December, an early Christmas present for
workers who'd been sitting home for nearly three months.</TE>
<TE>   The federal Mine Safety and Health Administration cited the
company last week for 27 violations, eight of which contributed to
the accident and the deaths. One of the worst, the agency said, was
failing to start evacuating the mine after the initial explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Walter Resources executives refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the agency admonished Jim Walter Resources for having "no
responsible person who took control of the situation" during the
accident. The agency also declared the mine's firefighting plan
inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   Although federal law requires that firefighting and evacuation be
simulated every 90 days, several miners interviewed recently were
hard-pressed to recall an evacuation drill and said firefighting
drills were usually limited to a foreman running through a checklist.</TE>
<TE>   The mine's firefighting plan has been revised with an emphasis on
improving coordination from the control room.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, the mine has been cited for numerous violations,
including accumulations of coal dust, ventilation problems and
inadequate roof support.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's new budget calls for a 5% cut in funding
for MSHA's coal mine enforcement. Experts say that could mean fewer
inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   In September, a thousand miners, family members and company
officials marked the one-year anniversary of the accident by erecting
a memorial.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who perished, Blevins has been singled out perhaps
more than any other as the embodiment of courage. His tombstone in a
Tuscaloosa cemetery is inscribed: "Son, Husband, Father, Grandfather
and Hero of JWR 5 Mine Explosion."</TE>
<TE>   His son, Dave Jr., who worked at neighboring No. 7 mine, has led
the drive to make the mine owner pay.</TE>
<TE>   He's a natural leader, just like his dad. Ten of the 13 families
that lost breadwinners have filed wrongful death lawsuits against the
company, alleging negligence.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Walter Resources denies that it was negligent and
characterizes the accident as unforeseeable.</TE>
<TE>   The company says the miners who were killed and injured understood
the risks but chose to follow their creed and go to the aid of their
brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three men injured in the first explosion, only Tony Key has
returned to work underground -- over his wife's objections. He wanted
to prove to himself that he could do it.</TE>
<TE>   Michael McIe, the man who led Key to safety, spends his days
tramping through the woods, under doctor's orders to do something
that gives him peace. Troubled by nightmares, he is on anti-anxiety
medication.</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Rose, the miner who prayed as he headed toward Four Section
after the first explosion, is back underground. It's the only work he
knows. But he asked to be taken off the belt crew, which lost three
men.</TE>
<TE>   After the mine reopened, he went to the spot where their bodies
were found, knelt in the coal dust and wept.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   THE STORY SO FAR</TE>
<TE>   Miners know what underground fires and gas explosions can do; the
annals of mining abound with tragic examples. But when a gas
explosion ripped through an underground tunnel, injuring three men,
other miners working that day in America's deepest vertical-shaft
coal mine did not flee. Like New York City police and firefighters on
Sept. 11, the miners raced not from danger but toward it.</TE>
<TE>   How This Story Was Reported</TE>
<TE>   The story of the accident at Jim Walter Resources No. 5 mine is
based on interviews with eight miners who survived; another
half-dozen current or former employees of the No. 5 mine; relatives
of five miners who died; two members of the Alabama state mine rescue
team; members of the United Mine Workers of America safety committees
at several Alabama mines; UMWA safety director Joe Main; UMWA health
and safety representative Tom Wilson; Jim Walter Resources spokesmen
in Brookwood, Ala., and Tampa, Fla.; Assistant Secretary of Labor
David Lauriski; federal Mine Safety and Health Administration
spokesman Rodney Brown; and mining-industry experts. It also drew on
depositions given to MSHA during its investigation and on six years
of federal safety citations against Jim Walter Resources No. 5, which
were obtained from MSHA under the Freedom of Information Act.</TE>

<HD>Arkansas Will Tell the Stories of Overlooked Japanese
Detainees</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>McGEHEE, Ark.</DL>
<LD>From paintings of kimono-clad women to a caricature of Hitler and a
sketch of an American soldier, shield in hand, marching across the
globe -- the artworks offer a vivid portrayal of history and culture.</LD>
<LD>   Crafted by Japanese American children in internment camps in
Arkansas during World War II, they were willed to former McGehee
Mayor Rosalie Santine Gould by a camp art teacher.</LD>
<LD>   And they are the heart of a major preservation effort.</LD>
<TE>   Once bustling with 16,000 detainees, the camps have been reclaimed
as farmland -- except for isolated historical markers and a small
cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   "May the people of Arkansas keep in beauty and reverence forever
this ground where our bodies sleep. Erected by the inhabitants of
Rohwer Relocation Center -- October 1944," reads an inscription on an
obelisk topped with a globe and an eagle.</TE>
<TE>   In Gould's home, autobiographies written by the children as part
of the camp schoolwork fill Manila folders tucked neatly into
cardboard boxes.</TE>
<TE>   "Since Dec. 7, 1941, War has darkened our horizons. On April 13,
1942, we were evacuated to the Santa Anita Assembly Center. Never had
we been in a place so devoid of luxuries," 15-year-old Midori Oura
wrote in 1942.</TE>
<TE>   After five months, the family was sent by train from Santa Anita
to Arkansas. The window shades on the train cars were pulled shut and
passengers were allowed exercise stops only in remote areas so as not
to pique anti-Japanese furor in towns along the route.</TE>
<TE>   "However far Arkansas may have seemed to us, in our hearts we were
glad that we were going to a permanent relocation center [for the
duration of the war]," Midori wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen assembly centers were made available on the West Coast.
More than 120,000 Japanese Americans from the West Coast and Hawaii
were temporarily assigned there, taken from their homes and land out
of fear of domestic terrorism and racism after the attack on Pearl
Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   They were told that they were being relocated for their own
protection because of public hostility.</TE>
<TE>   At the onset of World War II, they were moved to 10 more
"permanent" camps -- two of them in southeast Arkansas. Those two
were the only ones in the segregated South, selected because the
federal government owned a wide expanse of land here.</TE>
<TE>   Midori and her family were among the 16,000 interned in Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   A series of exhibitions, a symposium and a documentary compiled by
the Los Angeles-based Japanese American National Museum and the
University of Arkansas at Little Rock tell the overlooked story of
the Arkansas camps and their detainees.</TE>
<TE>   In flowing prose, Midori described her life from birth to
captivity:</TE>
<TE>   "Early on the morning of Nov. 20, 1926, Mr. and Mrs. Stork were
racing through the Southern California skies, bearing their precious
burdens. Said Father Stork, 'You've beaten me twice to this Inglewood
home, but this time, I'll be first.' 'Oh no you won't,' cried Mother
Stork. 'This world needs more women.' With an extra flap of her
wings, she reached the house on the stroke of one by the clock. Thus
I came into the world. My parents were both delighted even though I
was their third girl."</TE>
<TE>   Johanna Miller Lewis, chairwoman of the university's history
department, said historians have long neglected the Arkansas camps.</TE>
<TE>   "In all of the stuff written on the camps, there is usually only
one or two pages about Arkansas. Arkansas got the short end of the
stick and we are trying to fix that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Gov. Winthrop Paul Rockefeller said he hopes that the project,
funded through a $3-million grant from his family's Winthrop
Rockefeller Foundation, will help Americans learn from history.</TE>
<TE>   Rockefeller became interested in the camps 15 years ago when he
met a Silver Spring, Md., restaurant owner who spoke about being
relocated to Arkansas during the war.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important particularly in these times that we do use
it as a learning experience for the people of Arkansas. These are
parts of history that we need to objectively look at and make sure
that they are not forgotten," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Rohwer camp opened in September 1942 in Desha County, the
Jerome Center the same year in Drew and Chicot counties. Only one
Japanese American family descended from the camps' residents remains
in the state today.</TE>
<TE>   In the nearly six decades since the camps closed, there has been
little enthusiasm for documenting their history, said Gould, who
became interested in Rohwer and Jerome in the early 1980s while
serving as mayor of McGehee 12 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started all this 20 years ago, there was no interest at
all [in preservation]; everyone turned their backs. There were World
War II veterans who did not want anything to do with the Japanese
here. I didn't agree with them, but I didn't want to tear the town
up," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Although she is a lifelong resident of the area, Gould knew little
of the camps before becoming mayor. When the camps opened, she was in
Fayetteville attending college.</TE>
<TE>   Later, she returned and married into the family that owned the
land where the Rohwer camp was located. She recalled taking her
children to play in the area that was the camp cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   "It was part of Arkansas and part of American history, but we knew
very little about it. It was an entirely different America, an
entirely different set of rules then," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The cemetery sits at the end of a gravel path that winds between
planted fields. Its 29 grave markers include the names Kowata
Takeshi, 1890-1943; Matsuda Matagoro, 1872-1942, and Kunishi Saijiro,
1867-1943.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller markers indicate the graves of infants with names
including Masaki, Tasugi and Sano. All were born in 1942 and 1943.</TE>
<TE>   During their internment, the Japanese Americans erected a towering
tank-shaped monument on the cemetery grounds in tribute to former
detainees who served and died during World War II in the 100th
Infantry Battalion and 442nd Regimental Combat Team, made up mostly
of Japanese Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Both units saw fierce fighting in Europe and were among the
bravest in U.S. military history, receiving more than 18,000 honors.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the names of the soldiers beneath the drawing of an
American eagle is the inscription: "Dedicated to the men from Rohwer
Center who gave their lives to America on foreign soil."</TE>
<TE>   The only marker at the Jerome camp was constructed in the early
1990s. A brick tower, part of the camp's physical plant, is all that
remains. The crumbling 80-foot tower sits in the middle of farmer Kim
Ellington's milo field.</TE>
<TE>   Ellington, who grew up on the property, said former detainees
often visit the site.</TE>
<TE>   "We have eight or nine groups out here a year. They just want to
see and remember it. Every now and then, there would be someone who
had hard feelings, but not often," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ellington has unearthed spoons, pieces of dishes and other
remnants of the camp while tilling his field. "And more bricks than
you can shake a stick at," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Irene Hirano, the museum's executive director, has close ties to
the Rohwer camp. Her grandfather and seven of her aunts and uncles
were relocated from Gardena to Rohwer during the war.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was growing up, our families didn't talk about the war
years. I knew my father was in the military, and occasionally my
relatives would talk about the camp, but I had no idea of what that
whole experience was about," she said. "It wasn't until I went to
college and began to learn about what happened during World War II
... that I learned about my family's experience."</TE>
<TE>   She visited the Rohwer cemetery for the first time this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It underscored the importance of why we need to preserve the
story of the people that are still living and share it with a larger
American public."</TE>

<DL>FORT EDWARD, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Doomed maiden. Frontier martyr. Murder victim. Propaganda fodder.
Calendar girl.</LD>
<LD>   More than two centuries after Jane McCrea was supposedly killed by
British-allied Indians just before one of history's most significant
battles, she remains a tragic and elusive historical figure, an
American icon shrouded in myth, mystery and misconception.</LD>
<LD>   This year, the 225th anniversary of her death, has seen renewed
interest in McCrea, whose death is credited by some historians with
helping the Americans defeat the British at the Battles of Saratoga
in 1777.</LD>
<TE>   But finding the real McCrea among the versions offered by history
proves difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge, huge detective story," said David Starbuck, an
assistant professor of anthropology at New Hampshire's Plymouth State
College.</TE>
<TE>   With the approval of a Kansas woman believed to be the oldest
living McCrea descendant, Starbuck is seeking a state court's
permission to exhume McCrea's remains and try to answer some of the
questions that have baffled historians.</TE>
<TE>   "We still may not answer some of the big questions, but with
forensics, maybe we can fill in some of the details," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Jane McCrea House, located in the middle of this Hudson
River village 40 miles north of Albany, is misnamed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a nice state historic marker and it's a beautiful house,
but she was never in the building," said Eileen Hannay, director of
the nearby Rogers Island Visitor Center, where a McCrea exhibit takes
up most of one room.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit tells of a young woman living on the northern fringe
of New York's settlements who becomes a victim of frontier warfare.
The displays include artwork, literature and artifacts stemming from
a Jane McCrea craze that began a generation after her death.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1850s, pieces of wood -- reputedly from a pine tree that
stood at the spot where she died -- were being fashioned into canes
and boxes, and sold with certificates authenticating their source as
the famous "Jane McCrea Tree."</TE>
<TE>   And in the early 1900s, a local insurance company produced
calendars with artwork depicting a doomed McCrea awaiting her fate
while Indians gather in the background.</TE>
<TE>   "She's always been a historical celebrity," said Starbuck, who
calls McCrea "the most famous woman killed during the American
Revolution."</TE>
<TE>   What is known about McCrea is that she was born in New Jersey in
the 1750s and was living at her brother's farm near Ft. Edward when
the British army began marching south from Canada in the summer of
1777. Among the loyalist officers serving with the British was
McCrea's fiance.</TE>
<TE>   Scouting for the British were hundreds of American Indians, who
were under orders to attack militia patrols but avoid harming the
elderly, women and children.</TE>
<TE>   According to most accounts, McCrea was captured by Indians on July
27, 1777, while trying to hide in a friend's house in Ft. Edward.
Those accounts say an argument arose between two warriors claiming
her as their captive, with one of the Indians killing and scalping
McCrea.</TE>
<TE>   McCrea's betrothed, it is said, first learned of her death when he
spotted her hair being paraded about the British camp by the
returning Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Word of McCrea's grisly demise quickly spread through the
colonies, where it was reported in newspapers from New England to
Virginia. The specter of Indian atrocities convinced American troops
to rally behind the army arrayed against the British at Bemis
Heights, just south of Ft. Edward.</TE>
<TE>   Some historians credit the fallout from McCrea's death with
helping the Americans defeat the British weeks later at the Battles
of Saratoga, an outcome that changed the course of history. The
Saratoga victory convinced the French to join the fight against
England, and the Franco-American alliance led to the British
surrender at Yorktown, Va., in 1781.</TE>
<TE>   The cultural effect of McCrea's death rippled well into the 1800s,
thanks to an American artist living in Paris, according to Robert
Venables, a senior lecturer on American Indian studies at Cornell
University.</TE>
<TE>   John Vanderlyn's 1804 painting titled "Death of Jane McCrea"
depicted a young white woman in the clutches of two hulking warriors
about to deliver the fatal blow. His lurid image would be copied and
reproduced in the decades before the Civil War. Books, plays,
pageants and poems retelling her story also were popular as the
United States expanded westward.</TE>
<TE>   As white settlers clashed with Native American tribes, the
outpouring of McCrea images and literature mirrored the nation's
image of Indians, according to Venables.</TE>
<TE>   "It helps to have pegs that you can hang certain themes on, and
Jane McCrea is a convenient peg, and that peg is: Indians are savages
and whites deserve to conquer the North American continent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Starbuck, who has excavated colonial military sites in this region
for two decades, hopes to exhume McCrea's remains from a cemetery
just north of the village and perhaps learn details such as her
height, hair color and how she died.</TE>
<TE>   McCrea seemed to get taller and more attractive, her hair longer
and lighter, with each retelling of her story, Hannay said. But some
accounts say she had dark hair, and at least one contemporary
described her as a country girl "without either beauty or
accomplishments."</TE>
<TE>   As for her death, the accounts of McCrea being tomahawked and
scalped by her Indian captors are countered by contemporary British
reports that she may have been mistakenly shot by jittery American
militiamen.</TE>
<TE>   A forensic anthropologist could uncover evidence of bone damage
from gunshots or other wounds, but determining which side killed her
is unlikely, Starbuck said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he got the idea for the exhumation after hearing that a
97-year-old McCrea descendant living in Wichita, Kan., was concerned
that McCrea's story would fade from history.</TE>
<TE>   With Mary McCrea Deeter's blessing and the court's approval, the
anthropologist hopes to exhume the remains in the spring and try to
solve the 225-year-old mystery.</TE>

<HD>Panel Expands Inquiry of Fraud at Los Alamos Lab</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Gehrke</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A House committee is expanding its inquiry into fraud and credit card
abuse at Los Alamos National Laboratory, saying it is apparent that
the abuse is more widespread than first thought.</LD>
<LD>   The committee issued a sweeping demand for new documents,
including reports to lab director John C. Browne on the alleged
irregularities, and a breakdown of whether computers missing from the
nuclear lab contained classified information.</LD>
<LD>   Ken Johnson, spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, said three investigators are being sent to the lab and
will begin their work Monday.</LD>
<TE>   "It is apparent that the amount of fraud and abuse at [the lab] is
much more extensive and includes many more employees than we had
originally at first believed," said the letter, signed by committee
Chairman Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) and other senior members.</TE>
<TE>   The letter to Richard C. Atkinson, president of the University of
California, which runs the lab, expressed frustration at "the
apparent failure of the University of California and [the lab] to
sufficiently address these issues over the past several years."</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, which was sent Tuesday and released publicly
Friday, the panel also requested documents on the firing of two
investigators, who were dismissed after blowing the whistle on lab
management practices and materials from its auditor,
PricewaterhouseCoopers.</TE>
<TE>   Lab spokeswoman Linn Tytler said late Friday: "We will fully
cooperate with the committee and supply all of the requested
documents."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said the expanded request for documents was a result of
questions raised by documents received from an earlier request by the
committee, press reports, and information from Los Alamos employees
"suggesting that the problems are more prevalent than first
reported."</TE>
<TE>   Danielle Brian, executive director of the Washington-based
watchdog group Project on Government Oversight, which has worked with
Los Alamos whistleblowers, said the letter was an encouraging sign.</TE>
<TE>   "We think its a great start. It's obviously a serious
investigation," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Alamos lab grew out of the Manhattan Project that
developed the atomic bomb during World War II and has been a key part
of the country's nuclear energy and weapons programs.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI, the Energy Department's inspector general, and the Senate
Finance Committee are also investigating the allegations of fraud,
theft and cover-up at the nuclear weapons lab. Three lab employees
are on administrative leave after initial phases of the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The two investigators who were fired, Glenn Walp and Steven Doran,
had sounded alarms about misuse of the credit cards and missing
equipment, including some from sensitive areas of the lab.</TE>
<TE>   Walp submitted a report to Los Alamos authorities in March that
listed 263 computers as missing since 1999, many of them presumed
stolen. In all, about $2.7 million worth of equipment is unaccounted
for, according to Walp's reports.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 31, FBI agents armed with search warrants scoured the
homes of Los Alamos employees Peter Bussolini and Scott Alexander and
found thousands of dollars worth of goods that may have been acquired
by abuse of lab purchase orders.</TE>
<TE>   A third employee may have used her government credit card to buy a
Ford Mustang with custom equipment.</TE>

<HD>Secret of Lost Dog Trail Haunts a Friendship</HD>
<DH>Pair grew up close in a small Wyoming town. Was one of them
capable of something horrible?</DH>
<SE>First in a weekly serial about two mysterious deaths and a
reluctant witness.</SE>
<AU>Helen O'Neill</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>GREEN RIVER, Wyo.</DL>
<LD>From every corner of this dusty river outpost you see them, sheer
jagged cliffs rising from the desert, all burnished reds and
orange-yellows and sandy browns, breathtaking and beautiful and
deadly.</LD>
<LD>   Castle Rock. Giant's Thumb. Slippery Jim Canyon. Massacre Hill.
Their names evolved along with their formations and their stories.</LD>
<LD>   But the name on everyone's mind last summer -- in the mines, in
the taverns, at the mini-mart, at the Sage Creek Bagel Cafe -- was
Lost Dog Trail.</LD>
<TE>   The remote, rutted track meanders for seven miles across open
desert before ending at the head of a cliff. It is a forbidding place
of loose shale and parched scrub and swirling dust winds that gust
even in summer. Coiled rattlesnakes sun themselves on ledges,
slithering into crevices to cool. Lizards scurry underfoot. The
redness of the rock seems as endless as the blue of the sky.</TE>
<TE>   Senses are sharper here, if only because of the vastness, the
desolation, the danger.</TE>
<TE>   It was here, high on a ridge overlooking Flaming Gorge Reservoir,
that a young mother and her child plunged to their deaths six years
ago, their bodies crashing from rock to rock before coming to rest
100 feet down.</TE>
<TE>   A tragic accident, people thought at the time. A weekend outing
turned terribly wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Or so it seemed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Green River is a mining town of 14,000 named for the river that
snakes through its center. It has a dusty, old-fashioned spirit and
charm: Strangers are quickly welcomed; scores quickly settled.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Brauburger and Bob Duke grew up here, in the shadow of the
cliffs, best friends since a schoolyard fight in seventh grade.</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger was the tough one of the pair, not a serious
troublemaker but always in a scrape. As a teen, he strayed into
drinking and drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Duke was the clean-cut one, serious and ambitious, the son of
schoolteachers who were known for their strictness at home and at
school.</TE>
<TE>   The two grew up a few blocks from each other, Brauburger in a
little brown ranch house on Arizona Street, Duke in a little red
house on Bridger Street. They went to school together, shot pool
together, dreamed big dreams together.</TE>
<TE>   Duke talked of college, of getting rich, of traveling far from the
trona (soda ash) mines of Green River and making a name for himself.
Brauburger was content to drop out of school and follow his father
into construction.</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger admired Duke: He was always so focused, so sure;
nothing ever rattled him. He would set his mind to something and
master it completely. When they took up tae kwon do together, Duke
became a black belt. Brauburger dropped out after several classes.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing Brauburger could do better than Duke was shoot. He
was an excellent marksman.</TE>
<TE>   They would go off-roading in Duke's truck, tearing over the desert
above Flaming Gorge Reservoir, shooting rabbits and drinking beer. Or
they would go cruising for girls on the streets of the neighboring
town of Rock Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Many nights they'd sit home watching murder-for-hire and horror
movies: The violent cult film "Faces of Death" was a favorite. They
would joke about becoming hit men themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd kid around about what a great life, little effort, little
time, quick money," Brauburger said. "Click, just pull the trigger.
Click! Next thing you have 15, 15, 20 grand. Man, what a life."</TE>
<TE>   The outlaw history of Sweetwater County seemed to inspire such
talk: Butch Cassidy once roamed these parts, back in the mid-1880s,
when Green River was becoming a hub for the Union Pacific railroad.
The mines came in the 1940s and remain the biggest local employers.</TE>
<TE>   There is still a rough-around-the-edges quality to much of life
here -- a throwback to the days of old.</TE>
<TE>   It's the wind, some locals joke, blowing in from the plains,
driving people crazy.</TE>
<TE>   It's the highway, others say, carved right through the rock,
bringing interstate traffic and interstate problems.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it's the vast open desert where evil deeds are easily
buried in the dust, and the only witnesses are rattlesnakes and
lizards.</TE>
<TE>   On resurrection day, goes one old saying, bodies will be poking up
through the red desert dirt like white picket fences.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When he was 21, Brauburger bought Duke his first gun -- a 9 mm
Beretta. Brauburger was older by a few months, so he was legally able
to make the purchase. He also had connections -- connections that
Duke didn't have -- to drugs, to guns, to small-time crime.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, Brauburger would regret these connections and try to
escape them.</TE>
<TE>   Years later he would wish, with all his heart, that he had never
strayed into a world that had tarnished him for life with a
reputation he felt he didn't deserve -- a reputation that would haunt
him when he finally tried to do the right thing.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, though, life was good. Brauburger worked construction
jobs with his dad during the week, drank beer with Duke on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Duke was not so content.</TE>
<TE>   His dreams of a life beyond Green River were dashed when his
17-year-old girlfriend, Liana Davidson, a pretty, shy, dark-eyed
girl, got pregnant in high school. When she found out, Liana was
terrified. Duke stood by her, though he told Brauburger that he felt
trapped. They married in May 1991 and had a son, Erik, three months
later.</TE>
<TE>   Duke became a carpet layer, working hard, building a reputation as
the best in the business in Sweetwater County. Employers loved him:
He was diligent, professional and quiet, a good provider for his
family, a good husband and father.</TE>
<TE>   Liana threw herself into motherhood and home, filling the
apartment with homemade wreaths, crafts and knickknacks. She talked
of opening a craft shop someday.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife is going to make me independently wealthy," Duke would
joke.</TE>
<TE>   Liana disapproved of her husband's friendship with Brauburger:
Roger was too rough, she said, and she hated his drug-dealing
friends.</TE>
<TE>   So the friendship shifted. Duke still hung out with Brauburger for
occasional nights on the town, and they would still go off-roading in
his truck. But Duke started spending more time with another friend, a
cop. The two worked out and went fishing together, attended martial
arts classes, took up rock climbing. Brauburger, trying to hold down
a steady job while selling marijuana on the side, was not invited.</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger envied his old friend with his perfect home, perfect
family and money in his pocket with the jobs that always seemed to
come his way.</TE>
<TE>   Someday, he thought, I'd like to settle down and have a home and
family too.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger got the news in Laramie, 223 miles away, while he was
helping a friend move.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a terrible accident," his mother said on the
phone.</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger listened in horror, a hot panic rising in his chest. He
thought of the raw jagged edges of the cliffs at the head of Lost Dog
Trail. He thought of the bodies. He thought of his best friend.</TE>
<TE>   He put the phone down and buried his face in his hands.</TE>
<TE>   Oh my God, he thought. How could this have happened?</TE>
<TE>   But in his heart he thought he knew.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the deaths were ruled an accident.</TE>
<TE>   A steamy August day. A little boy throwing rocks and chasing
lizards. A mother hovering over him. The father heading back to the
Jeep for a soda.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly a scream. And they were gone.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Duke's account was heartbreaking. He described how he raced to
the edge of the cliff and saw the twisted bodies of his wife and
child far below, how he couldn't find any way to reach them, how he
heard the gurgling sound of his son's last breath.</TE>
<TE>   Frantically, he called 911 on his cell phone, then drove to the
main road to guide in the ambulance and the firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke of his agony as he watched the bodies being winched up in
a basket, the broken body of 5-year-old Erik cradled in the arms of
his bruised and bloodied mother, 22-year-old Liana.</TE>
<TE>   Even the rescuers wept.</TE>
<TE>   Duke stood by his Jeep in silence, answering investigators'
questions in a monotone, unable even to cry.</TE>
<TE>   Poor man, he must be in such shock, people thought, as they
flocked to the funerals in an outpouring of community grief and
support. Only 23 years old and he had lost his family.</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger struggled to find words of comfort for his friend, but
he didn't know what to say. He carried Erik's coffin with a heavy
heart, proud to be the pall bearer, sick with grief for the child he
had known, tormented by thoughts about what had happened -- thoughts
that he didn't dare share with anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Mother and child were buried side by side in Riverview Cemetery on
a hill overlooking town. Bob Duke took pride in picking out designs
for the headstones: doves and flowers for Liana, an engraving of a
boy and a dog for Erik.</TE>
<TE>   But even as Duke broke down at the funeral, even as grief and
disbelief swelled through the town, there were whispers of doubt.</TE>
<TE>   What could have lured the family to such a desolate, dangerous
spot in the first place?</TE>
<TE>   Why had there been no autopsy, no thorough police investigation?</TE>
<TE>   What had really happened that day on Lost Dog Trail?</TE>
<TE>   "There was just this sense," said Tim Merchant of the sheriff's
department, echoing other investigators. "It was just a gut feeling
that something wasn't right."</TE>
<TE>   But the one man who thought he knew what was wrong was too
terrified to say.</TE>
<TE>   After all, who on earth would believe him?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After the funerals, Brauburger kept his distance from Duke,
although he still borrowed money from him for drugs. They didn't go
off-roading as much anymore. They didn't hang out watching movies.</TE>
<TE>   When Duke moved to Houston in the fall of 1998 to live with his
older brother, Mike, Brauburger felt a sense of relief. He could put
his dark thoughts behind him. He could bury his secret with the past.
Nothing he did or said could change things, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   And then the phone calls began, and the nightmarish suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   And the fear and the guilt that had haunted Brauburger for two
years erupted one night in a frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   Next week: Suspicions, threats and fear.</TE>

<HD>Injunction Forbids N.Y. Transit Strike</HD>

<AU>John J. Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Intensive round-the-clock negotiations began Friday between the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority and union representatives in an
effort to avert a subway and bus strike that would leave millions of
riders scrambling to get to work.</LD>
<LD>   As expected, a state Supreme Court justice issued a preliminary
injunction Friday against a walkout under the state's Taylor Law,
which forbids strikes by public employees.</LD>
<LD>   In his decision, Justice Jules Spodek said a transit strike would
be "enormous, debilitating and destructive."</LD>
<TE>   The ruling, which clears the way for possible contempt citations
and jail time for union leaders, was designed to pressure the 34,000
members of the Transport Workers Union to agree to a new contract
before 12:01 a.m. Monday, when the old pact is set to expire.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg applauded the judge's decision. The
mayor, who pledged that he would pedal from his Upper East Side
Manhattan home to City Hall downtown, bought a $500 mountain bike
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's going to shut down New York," he vowed.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides said they were far apart on wages, payments to pension
funds and disciplinary policies.</TE>
<TE>   A central question is whether the MTA has sufficient funds to
grant raises.</TE>
<TE>   It claims that it faces a $1-billion budget deficit, despite an
increase in ridership.</TE>
<TE>   But last year, the authority reported a $300-million surplus.
Officials of the agency say the surplus was spent to dramatically
improve subway and bus service, and grant discounts to riders.</TE>
<TE>   Union negotiators view the explanation with skepticism and said
they wonder if the authority either exaggerated its successes so that
Gov. George E. Pataki would not face financial problems before his
reelection in November or whether some money is being withheld for
11th-hour bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980 during the last transit strike, which lasted 11 days, the
union was fined $1 million and workers gave up two days pay for each

<HD>A threadbare tapestry of the Texas plains</HD>
<DH>That Old Ace in the Hole, A Novel, Annie Proulx, Scribner:
364 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Banville</AU>
<BD>John Banville, literary editor of The Irish Times, is
the author of many novels, including "Shroud," to be published in the
spring by Alfred A. Knopf.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Annie Proulx, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of "The Shipping News"
and the wonderful story collection "Close Range," really should have
known better than to settle on a title as awful as "That Old Ace in
the Hole." With the exception of "in" and "the," there is not a word
there that should be allowed into the title of any self-respecting
novel, certainly not a novel of the scope and ambitiousness of this
one. Then there are the names of the characters: LaVon Fronk and her
son, Coolbroth, Ribeye Cluke, Ace Crouch and Tater Crouch, Tazzy
Keister, Freda Beautyrooms, Sheriff Hugh Dough and his brother Doug,
Jim Skin, Dick Head etc. One might expect Proulx, who used to be E.
Annie Proulx, to know something of the inadvisability of peppering a
text with such outlandish monikers, even one set in the territory of
a Conway Twitty or a Breece D'J Pancake. She would have done well to
heed her protagonist, Bob Dollar, in his observation of the Texas
town of Woolybucket that "eccentricities were valued and cultivated,
as long as they were not too peculiar."</LD>
<TE>   Young Bob, whose parents went off to Alaska when he was a boy,
abandoning him to the care of his Uncle Tam, has been sent to
Woolybucket, in the Texas Panhandle, on a clandestine mission to buy
up farms so that they can be turned into intensive hog-raising
factories by the multinational conglomerate Global Pork Rind. He is
25, something of a dropout, and in search of himself, or of any old
self, so long as it is habitable. On the advice of his Global boss,
who knows how much the Panhandlers deplore the spread of these giant
noxious hog farms, he pretends that the interests he represents are
seeking to build luxury homes in the area to be sold to rich clients
hankering after a life on the prairie. The canny folk of Woolybucket
do not really buy his story but welcome him anyway into their little
community, for they are a tolerant bunch and do not mind much even
when they discover his true intent.</TE>
<TE>   He finds a place to stay, at $50 a month, in an old bunkhouse on
LaVon Fronk's farm, the Busted Star. LaVon, "who resembled one of the
minor Roman emperors," is a salty widow with a limitless trove of
stories of the Panhandle and its colorful inhabitants. She is
compiling a county history to be called "The Woolybucket Rural
Compendium," the material for which already fills two of the ranch
house's downstairs rooms. She is therefore, of course, a rich source
of information, for the reader no less than for Bob, on all those
Crouches and Doughs and Keisters. Indeed the novel, as one rapidly
comes to realize, is not so much a narrative as itself a compendium
of tales, tall and rarely short, which Proulx seeks to weave into a
rich tapestry of rural American life.</TE>
<TE>   Proulx, a New Englander who now lives in Wyoming and Newfoundland,
is a curious hybrid among contemporary American writers. In her
western fictions she is a beamingly benign version of Cormac
McCarthy, yet her work also has affinities with that of Steinbeck and
even Thomas Pynchon. However, the books which "That Old Ace in the
Hole" is most reminiscent of are "Candide" and -- wait for it --
Evelyn Waugh's "Decline and Fall." Like Voltaire's and Waugh's
hapless heroes, Bob Dollar wanders through a wicked world, an
inviolable innocent, wistfully convinced that there is a better life
awaiting him if only he can figure out what it is. He knows that the
hog factories are poisoning the environment of the Panhandle, yet he
has been given a job to do and is stubbornly determined to do it,
even though it goes against the grain of his character to lie about
his role as a spy for his egregious masters back at Global Pork Rind.
Somehow we know from the start that he will come through with his
decency intact and a brighter future in prospect, and we are not
proved wrong. Like most fictional innocents abroad, however, Bob as a
character is lacking in something essential, a vividness, a
thereness, which in turn is a lack at the heart of the book itself.</TE>
<TE>   Proulx is a natural storyteller, which is not the same as being a
natural novelist. She displays a jaunty disregard for the rules of
fiction and of the novel form but does not replace them with rules of
her own. "That Old Ace in the Hole" is a big rattlebag of a book,
filled with yarns, jokes, nuggets of faux wisdom of the
cracker-barrel variety and a teeming cast of determinedly lovable
eccentrics. It is not so much a narrative as a vast web of
digressions. Failures of tone abound; here are two examples, the
first a real clunker. After a wonderful set-piece cockfight, "Bob
drove back to the Busted Star feeling he had been present at some
dark blood sacrifice older than civilization, a combat with sexual
overtones rooted in the deepest trench of the panhandle psyche."</TE>
<TE>   This is the kind of blush-making sentence a weary writer might
write at the end of a long day and hurriedly strike out first thing
next morning. There are other, less obvious but no less lamentable
instances of stylistic laxity. Here is Bob Dollar at one of his
shrewder moments:</TE>
<TE>   "He had seen for himself that right-thinking ways were supported
by billows of gossip and a constant and surveillant picking at those
who showed the slightest tendency to slip off the trodden path unless
they fell into the category of Colorful Panhandle characters. And
work was the great leveler, work and the land, the twin assets of all
rural people." [italics added]</TE>
<TE>   The italicized phrases here are no more than word clusters, not so
much written as computer-generated. None of this would be worth
commenting on if Proulx had not in the past shown herself, especially
in the short stories, to be as sharp a stylist as anyone writing
today. In the superb long story, "Brokeback Mountain," for instance,
there is hardly a surplus phrase or a word out of place. By contrast,
"That Old Ace in the Hole" is what Henry James would have called a
loose, baggy monster.</TE>
<TE>   There is a plot, though it is rather a feeble one -- Global Pork
Rind gets its comeuppance -- interrupted at every turn as yet another
new character launches into yet another outlandish tale. But perhaps
it is churlish to ask for narrative drive when there are such riches
on offer. Proulx, for all that may be said of her failings in this
book, has a vivid and capacious imagination and a fine ear for the
rhythms of vernacular speech; one can hear these Panhandlers as they
spin their web of stories. The prose too, when it is not slipshod,
produces moments of peculiar, syncopated poetry: "Jim Skin came in,
plastered with grease." And amid all the skewed rural comedy there
are, as always in this humane writer's work, moments of tenderness to
shake the heart. At the center of the book comes an almost perfect,
four- or five-page vignette, recounting how Ace Crouch's wife,
Vollie, once fell secretly, hopelessly in love with a cowboy going by
the name -- nicely judged, for once -- of Ruby Loving. Proulx, in a
couple of sentences sketching the end of this non-affair, expresses
with consummate skill the sadness and sweetness of these inarticulate
lives:</TE>
<TE>   "It was years before she pulled out of the feeling, scared, maybe
love, or whatever it was for him. If she took a plum from a tree
after fog or rain, beaded with droplets [of] moisture, she thought of
him, thought of that hot sweaty Texas time."</TE>

<HD>The book that started a war</HD>
<DH>Uncle Tom's Cabin Or, Life Among the Lowly, Harriet Beecher
Stowe, Oxford University Press: 456 pp., $22</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vivian Gornick</AU>
<BD>Vivian Gornick is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is now a century and a half since "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was
published in the spring of 1852. Within a year of publication, the
book had sold 305,000 copies in the United States and something like
2.5 million all over the world. Its impact, among English speakers
especially, was phenomenal. Lord Palmerston read it three times and
called it statesmanlike. Abraham Lincoln, when he met Harriet Beecher
Stowe, remarked famously, "So this is the little lady who made this
big war." After the war, however, sales declined rapidly, and by the
1890s, the book was out of print, where it remained for 50 years.</LD>
<LD>   But "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was destined for the kind of mythic fame
that would have made its author drop her jaw and shade her eyes. The
characters were kept alive by successive stage dramatizations that
exploited them for their comic and melodramatic elements, each one
moving ever further from the original until, finally, the famous
novel was transformed into a vaudeville that, by the 1920s, compelled
the writers of the Harlem Renaissance to blast it to kingdom come
with their hot scorn of "Tom-ism." Thus, as Edmund Wilson observed 40
years ago in "Patriotic Gore," his great study of Civil War
literature, "To expose oneself in maturity to Uncle Tom may prove a
startling experience." Indeed.</LD>
<TE>   I read the book last month for the first time, not only to
discover that there are no dogs snapping at Eliza's heels as she
crosses the ice, that Simon Legree is not an overseer, that Topsy
bears a strong resemblance to the sinister love child in "The Scarlet
Letter" and that Tom is a Christ figure, but also to discover the
real shocker: the unexpectedness of Stowe's intelligence, the depth
and the breadth of it. A masterpiece of American literature had lived
inside me since childhood as the sum of those distortions that
popular culture and civil rights rhetoric had imposed on it for most
of its lifetime. If ever a book proved that politics and literature
are inextricably bound, "Uncle Tom's Cabin" is it.</TE>
<TE>   What Lord Palmerston meant when he called the book statesmanlike
is that Stowe creates a slowly unfolding, steadily encompassing
picture of how slavery was actually lived out in the United States
among slaves, slave owners and traders, bounty hunters and Christian
do-gooders (both genuine and hypocritical). It is a picture drawn
with sufficient analytic and descriptive power to make every creature
on the landscape a felt reality.</TE>
<TE>   The structure of the book is simple. Tom, a slave on a Kentucky
estate, is bought and sold twice, and Eliza, a slave on the same
estate, becomes a runaway. These twin events provide the two major
strands of storytelling that the book develops. Eliza's fate is
resolved successfully when she falls into the hands of Quakers on the
Underground Railway who transport her (along with her child and
recovered husband) to Canada. Tom's journey is of an altogether
different nature. Each of Tom's successive owners forces him farther
south -- deeper into hell -- on a Pilgrim's Progress that is meant to
account for much of the world of slave masters. To begin with, there
is the weak, kindly philistine, Arthur Shelby of Kentucky, then the
poetic, spiritually inert Augustine St. Clare of New Orleans and, at
last, the pathologically self-hating Simon Legree hidden away in
rural Louisiana. Holding the drama together is Tom's steady progress
toward his own Christ-like death, a death, that is, of course, a
foregone conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   Metaphysical schemes aside, the characters in "Uncle Tom's Cabin"
are remarkably absorbing. In the first household we meet Tom; Eliza;
Tom's wife, Chloe; and the Shelbys liberal son, George; in the
second, St. Clare and his daughter, Little Eva; the wild-child slave,
Topsy; and St. Clare's self-consciously Christian cousin from the
north, Ophelia; in Simon Legree's house of horror, it is Eliza's
long-lost mother, the magnificent Cassy (another character Hawthorne
could have written) who compels attention. These people all take
their places in the allegory, and the force and clarity with which
each one comes alive on the page, emerging from prose that is
essentially without art, is amazing.</TE>
<TE>   Stowe was a writer with a mission. Her mission was to make
mid-19th century America see that it had betrayed itself with
slavery, and her excellent mind told her to work hard to create
characters who would move, as well as instruct, readers. So we see
the vanity of Arthur Shelby's weakness, feel the anxiety behind Simon
Legree's murderousness and are shocked by the mad integrity of
Topsy's wildness as well as the terrible limitation of Ophelia's
knee-jerk Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   Tom is the figure in whom reposes Stowe's idea of genuine
Christianity -- the man who cannot close his heart or raise his hand
against another, even at the risk of losing his life -- and Tom is
also the repository of typically radical fantasies about the Other.
On arriving at St. Clare's beautiful house in New Orleans, "Tom got
down from the carriage, and looked about with an air of calm, still
enjoyment. The negro, it must be remembered, is an exotic of one of
the most gorgeous and superb countries in the world, and he has, deep
in his heart, a passion for all that is splendid, rich, and
fanciful.... If ever Africa shall show an elevated and cultivated
race -- and come it must, some time, her turn to figure in the great
drama of human improvement -- life will awake there a gorgeousness
and splendor of which our cold western tribes faintly have conceived.
In that far-off mystic land ... will awake new forms of art, new
styles of splendor; and the negro race, no longer despised and
trodden down, will, perhaps, show forth some of the latest and most
magnificent revelations of human life...."</TE>
<TE>   Little Eva is Tom's saintly counterpart. When everyone is
terrorized by Topsy's suicidal unruliness, Eva alone tames the
wretched black girl by smoothing her face with a kindly hand. It is
often Eva who is the catalyst for plain thinking in the central
section of the book. In one crucial scene, St. Clare and Ophelia sit
on a veranda watching the little girl climb onto Tom's lap. Ophelia,
the complicated do-gooder, finds herself viscerally disgusted at the
sight of the white child hugging the black man, and St. Clare
observes, "You would think no harm in a child's caressing a large
dog, even if he was black; but a creature that can think, and reason,
and feel, and is immortal, you shudder at ... I know the feeling
among some of you northerners.... You loathe them as you would a
snake or a toad, yet you are indignant at their wrongs. You would not
have them abused; but you don't want to have anything to do with them
yourselves. You would send them to Africa, out of your sight and
smell, and then send a missionary ... to elevate them...." Gazing at
Eva and Tom, St. Clare murmurs, "What would the poor and lowly do,
without children?... Your little child is your only true democrat
...."</TE>
<TE>   Ophelia is amazed and chastened by these thoughts and thinks him
on the verge of becoming an abolitionist; whereupon he instantly
punctures his own balloon. "Nothing," he assures her, "is easier than
talking," and recalls, appropriately enough, that "Shakespeare makes
somebody say, 'I could sooner show twenty what were good to be done,
than be one of the twenty to follow my own showing.' "</TE>
<TE>   At the unforgettable heart of the novel stands St. Clare. It is
through him that Stowe makes the largest sense of things. In the
middle of the novel he delivers a 15-page disquisition worthy of
George Eliot on the existential meaning of slavery. The speech is
both profound and shocking. He is the Ashley Wilkes of "Uncle Tom's
Cabin": a developed sensibility rendered useless by an immobilized
will. His words, his destiny, his very being come to haunt the
reader. In his person, the hope of civilization is both aroused and
deflated. Through him we feel acutely the limited use of an educated
intelligence as opposed to that of a clarified spirit moved to
urgency.</TE>
<TE>   St. Clare is the good German under the Nazis or the nerveless
Tolstoyan shrugging off serfdom or the liberal white South African
living with apartheid. St. Clare is any one of us at any time in
history. In 1858, in a collection of articles, letters and slave
auction notices called "A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin," Stowe published
a letter written in 1773 by Patrick Henry in which Henry says of
slavery, "[T]hat this abominable practice has been introduced ... at
a time when the rights of humanity are defined and understood with
precision, in a country above all others fond of liberty ... is as
repugnant to humanity as it is inconsistent.... Would anyone believe
that I am master of slaves of my own purchase? I am drawn along by
the general inconvenience of living here without them. I will not, I
cannot, justify it."</TE>
<TE>   We see why it took Moses 40 years to lead the Jews out of the
desert. How dominating is appetite, how enveloping immediate
experience! Even the philosophically minded among us capitulate,
ultimately, to the narrowest sense of personal need. Political time
moves at a snail's pace because it is only with nearly insurmountable
difficulty that moral discomfort takes root in the best of people,
forcing an imperative out of a complaint; so viscerally repugnant is
it for a critical mass to find the prevailing system unbearable, much
less prepare to take up arms against it. Impossible, then, for one
and all, victims and victimizers alike, to do more than rage or
regret, suffer or run, pursue or die. Harriet Stowe was a fervent
Christian, but she might just as easily have been a theoretical
revolutionary, such is the cast of her mind.</TE>
<TE>   "Uncle Tom's Cabin" has the power to make any reader remember that
if arms are not taken up during a time in which some human beings are
perceived and treated as less than human, then everyone alive will
have much to answer for. It is impossible to read the book and not
find yourself thinking, "If the time was now, and the place was here,
where would I be standing on this landscape of human insufficiency?"</TE>

<DH>The Secret, A Novel, Eva Hoffman, PublicAffairs: 272 pp.,
$25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Harris</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Iris Surrey, the narrator of Eva Hoffman's first novel, calls it "the
Weirdness." It's something about Iris, a healthy, pretty girl living
with her mother, Elizabeth, in a college town near Chicago, that
doesn't show in the mirror. Or it's something about Iris and her
mother together. The Weirdness reveals itself in other people's
startled, evasive eyes -- the eyes of an aunt Iris meets only once;
the eyes of her mother's boyfriend, Steven, who is almost like a
father to the girl before he leaves.</LD>
<LD>   Iris knows nothing of her real father, and for much of her
childhood she doesn't care, her relationship with Elizabeth is so
close and satisfying. "She was ... the larger part of myself, as much
me as my limbs or bloodstream.... We moved in our own special
atmosphere ... an amniotic fluid that incorporated us both ... She
sponged me up and I felt some of her own substance passing into me
... like nourishment, like juice."</LD>
<TE>   As Iris grows up, however, things begin to bother her -- the
aunt's anger, Steven's transition from warmth to disquiet, the
cruelty of schoolmates who notice that Iris looks just like her
mother and spread rumors "that I was the fruit of an incestuous union
between my mother and her twin brother; that my mother had murdered
my father -- because he was also her father." She becomes aware of
the Weirdness and feels, like many another troubled teenager, that
something is wrong with her.</TE>
<TE>   At 17, Iris rifles through Elizabeth's papers and discovers a
truth that is more horrible than the rumors: She is a clone. She has
no father. Her mother is, in genetic terms, her identical twin
sister. Her grandparents, whom she has never met, are therefore her
parents as well as Elizabeth's. Iris is a new kind of creature on
Earth, a freak, a monster. Hoffman, who left her native Poland at 13
to come to the New World, knows all about feeling different and
failing to fit in. Iris' discovery occurs about a quarter of the way
through "The Secret." The rest of the story is about her struggle to
cope with her clonehood, to find an identity apart from her mother,
whose DNA she shares, whose gestures she mimics, who may have done
and thought everything Iris will do and think.</TE>
<TE>   There are wider implications too. Hoffman sets the novel 20 years
into the future, envisioning a more crowded, more polluted America in
which "virtuals" have substituted for much old-fashioned reality, the
nuclear family has disappeared, implants keep the elderly going
indefinitely and "Human Education" has made people feel that they
aren't living their own lives so much as re-enacting tired variations
on hackneyed old plots.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman, whose nonfiction works also include "Exit Into History"
and "Shtetl," is at her best when she explores Iris' anguish in the
context of technology's threats to our traditional notions of self.
Human cloning -- which in "The Secret" seems to be legal, if rare --
is just one of them. In dialogues with her "Adviser" -- something
like a psychotherapist -- Iris time and again points out the
inability of 20th century thinking to apply to her case.</TE>
<TE>   It's as a novel, as a tale requiring verisimilitude, that "The
Secret" falters. All the characters are born-and-bred Americans, but
they use British idioms: "kerb" for curb, "maths" for math, "twig on"
for realize. Iris often sounds much older than she is supposed to be.
Her education at a Midwestern high school, in an age dismissive of
the past, is unaccountably classical -- when she quotes something,
it's likely to be "Hamlet" or from Greek myth.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, Hoffman fails to convince us that Iris' secret
could be kept from her so long. She is a bright girl, and America is
a relentlessly gossipy society. Can we believe that her cloning in
2005 wouldn't have been publicized worldwide, that 17 years later she
wouldn't have heard of similar cases, that those nasty schoolmates
wouldn't hit on the right answer? Hardly. Yet the novel depends on
her ignorance. That's the real weirdness.</TE>

<HD>Seeking peace in a world falling to pieces</HD>
<DH>Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World, Margaret
MacMillan, Random House: 574 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William I. Hitchcock</AU>
<BD>William I. Hitchcock teaches history at Wellesley
College and is the author of the forthcoming "The Struggle for
Europe: The Turbulent History of a Divided Continent, 1945-2002."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Woodrow Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war on
Germany in April 1917, he made no secret of his ambitions. This would
not be a war to gain territory or treasure but a fight for the
"ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples."
He famously declared his chief war aim: "The world must be made safe
for democracy."</LD>
<LD>   Once engaged in the Great War, Wilson expanded on these principles
in his Fourteen Points. The United States now repudiated the making
of secret alliances, which had led to war in 1914. It also pledged to
ensure freedom of the seas, promote free trade, reduce armaments and
give the peoples of Europe and the Middle East, languishing under the
rule of tyrannical empires, the opportunity for national
self-determination. Not least, Wilson asked that the states of the
world join together in a League of Nations to help preserve peace.</LD>
<LD>   Surely no nobler set of war aims was ever articulated, and when
Wilson arrived in Europe in January 1919 to preside over the postwar
peace conference, the public hailed him as an almost divine figure, a
man possessed of the power to right the wrongs and ease the
sufferings of war-racked Europe. The crowds that lined the streets as
he made his way into Paris erupted with shouts of "Vive l'Amerique!"
Wilson, they believed, had come to Paris not merely to make peace but
to make the world anew.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, he failed, and the story of Wilson's heroic failure
lies at the heart of Margaret MacMillan's excellent survey of the
Paris Peace Conference. This is a sprawling work of narrative
political history, filled with both diplomatic detail and vivid
portraits of statesmen from across the world who converged on Paris
in those dreary early months of 1919. This is by no means the first
book to have covered this ground, but by combining impeccable
research with lively prose and an eye for telling detail, MacMillan
brings the diplomatic wranglings to life.</TE>
<TE>   The three chief leaders occupy center stage. Woodrow Wilson faced
off against the wily British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, a
Welsh dynamo with a keen political sense and few scruples. He also
locked horns with the stalwart French premier, Georges Clemenceau,
who hated Germany with all his heart and demanded a tough peace
settlement that would forever hobble the once fear-inspiring nation.
These men brought with them dozens of ministers, hundreds of advisors
and thousands of journalists, who packed the best Paris hotels and
restaurants, filling the city with an air of drama and intrigue.
MacMillan, Lloyd George's great-granddaughter, has an especially keen
eye for set-piece descriptions and character portraits, and she
persuades us that "for six months, Paris was the capital of the
world."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the leaders in Paris took on an agenda of staggering
proportions, addressing issues that affected almost every continent.
With the German, Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires swept away by
the war, the leaders had to rearrange the political map of Europe.
They also sought to revive the European economy, disarm the defeated
powers, contain the Bolshevik challenge coming from Russia, dismantle
the German colonial empire and design successor states in the Middle
East to take the place of the defunct Ottoman Empire. On top of this,
they outlined an unprecedented experiment in international
cooperation and collective security: the League of Nations.</TE>
<TE>   If these leaders had shared a common vision and close unity of
purpose, they might have managed to achieve great things in Paris.
But they were divided on almost all the great questions of the
conference. Wilson expended enormous energy on the League, believing
this new world body would assure a lasting peace. Clemenceau
disdained it and demanded a military occupation of the Rhineland, the
long-term disarmament of Germany and a heavy reparations bill. Lloyd
George, under political pressure at home to "squeeze Germany until
the pips squeaked," lent support to France's demands for reparations
from Germany but tried to ingratiate himself with Wilson by
supporting the League. All the while, he had his eyes set on snapping
up large chunks of the Middle East, now that the Ottomans had been
pushed aside. Not surprisingly, the Germans, who were not allowed to
participate, declared the whole thing a sham.</TE>
<TE>   At times, MacMillan's narrative flies past like an express train,
and we catch only glimpses of various characters in each compartment.
Bolshevik leader V.I. Lenin appears briefly, casting scorn on
Wilson's high-minded pieties. Then a noisy band of Yugoslavs looms
into view, calling for recognition of their newly proclaimed kingdom;
then delegations of Romanians, Hungarians, Bulgarians, Greeks, Czechs
and Slovaks speed by before ceding place to the Japanese
representatives, asking for a sphere of influence in China.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, however, the story returns to the central questions of
the conference: Must Germany be treated harshly or leniently? Should
Germany pay for the war damage it caused? Should all the peoples of
Europe and the Middle East really be granted self-determination or
should multi-ethnic states be established? And, most important, what
powers should be given to the new League of Nations to keep the
peace?</TE>
<TE>   As MacMillan shows, the peace conference failed because these
issues were never resolved. The treaty that was finally signed with
Germany in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles was shot
through with contradictions that opened the way for Germany's angry
defiance. For example, the victors demanded payment of reparations
but gave no indication of how Germany would find the means to pay.
Self-determination had been loudly championed by Wilson, but the
Allies remained in occupation of German territory in the West, while
in the East, millions of Germans wound up living inside the new
states of Czechoslovakia and Poland. Meanwhile, Romania and
Yugoslavia were allowed to swallow vast tracts of Hungary. And, to
Wilson's profound distress, the League of Nations, on which he had
labored so valiantly, was scorned by the United States Senate, which
refused to ratify American membership.</TE>
<TE>   The most egregious betrayal of Wilson's idealism occurred in the
Middle East, where Britain and France pounced on the Ottoman Empire
like hungry wolves. Turkish nationalist forces under Kemal Ataturk
preserved a sovereign Turkish state (and crushed hopes for an
independent Kurdistan), but the vast lands stretching south and east
-- Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Transjordan, Iraq and the Arabian
Peninsula -- these were to be divided up as spoils of war. The
British and French politely claimed to be acting on behalf of the
League of Nations, which would oversee the elevation of these
undeveloped regions into modern states. In fact, this was a land
grab, and it laid the ground for the anti-Western animosity that
permeates the Arab world today.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the many shortcomings of the peace settlement devised in
1919, MacMillan offers some sympathy for the peacemakers. They did
not, after all, willingly sow the seeds of World War II. They simply
disagreed on the basic mechanism to ensure a lasting peace. Indeed,
despite the subtitle of the book, these were six months that signally
failed to change the world: They did not make the world safe for
democracy or restrain the destructive power of nationalism or curtail
the building of vast navies and armies. In the same month that the
peace conference ended, Adolf Hitler began a career as an education
officer in the German army, instructing cadets about the Jewish and
Bolshevik conspiracy against Germany.</TE>
<TE>   MacMillan's fine work reminds us just how hard it is, even for
great powers, to hammer swords into plowshares. Today, at a time of
unprecedented American power and global reach, our record of
manufacturing peace has not been especially strong either. Those
recent settlements that have worked, such as in Bosnia and Kosovo,
have held together only because of the presence of large numbers of
U.S. and NATO soldiers to enforce an uneasy truce. In Afghanistan,
our efforts at nation building are incomplete at best. In Israel, the
West Bank and Gaza, half a century of determined peacemaking efforts
have gone unredeemed. Meanwhile, there are some 60 armed conflicts
going on in the world today, and the United States is either
powerless or unwilling to stop them. MacMillan's book reminds us of
the main lesson learned at such a high cost in Paris in 1919: Peace
is not something that can be imposed at the conference table. It can
grow only from the hearts of people.</TE>

<HD>Love, loss and the urban poet</HD>
<DH>Married to the Icepick Killer: A Poet in Hollywood, Carol
Muske-Dukes, Random House: 208 pp., $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thea Klapwald</AU>
<BD>Thea Klapwald has written for the (London) Times
Literary Supplement and other publications, and is working on a novel
about expatriates living in Hong Kong.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The perennial question, "What does it mean to be a Los Angeles
writer?" is one of the many that Carol Muske-Dukes explores in her
recent collection of essays, "Married to the Icepick Killer: A Poet
in Hollywood." Perhaps, when she describes herself as an
"internationally unknown author," she is taking a stab at answering
it.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, this is an understatement. Muske-Dukes is an
accomplished, published novelist and poet who has received many an
award and fellowship and is director of the graduate program in
literature and creative writing at USC. She is an uncontested
linchpin of the literary community in Los Angeles. But compared to
the theatrical and celebrity-driven world of her husband, the late
actor David Dukes, it must have felt like taking on the role of an
undiscovered starlet, again and again.</LD>
<TE>   The lurid title, reminiscent of "You'll Never Eat Lunch in This
Town Again," belies the prose within. The essays, many of which
appeared previously in the New York Times, are decidedly up-market.
The themes run the gamut of societal and academic hot-button
subjects: the never-ending rant against and appeasement of the
constantly changing set of literary and academic standards in the
modern world; a poet's place in politics; politicians, particularly
former President Clinton; poetry as a commodity in Hollywood; poetry
as fad and marketing tool; and performance poetry, or what she terms
"poetry karaoke." She covers a lot of ground in small leaps, but the
analysis of poetry, the poems themselves and a poet's craft are at
the core of these relatively short pieces.</TE>
<TE>   The most inspired moments are those in which Muske-Dukes allows
her natural irreverent playfulness to emerge, and usually they are in
the context of a spill-the-beans titillating tidbit from her life as
a wife to an actor and her status as a sought-after member of the
literati.</TE>
<TE>   In the essay "Two Poems: East and West, Right and Left -- Politics
Through The Eyes of Poetry," she describes being invited to the White
House for a fancy do honoring poets. There, Clinton recites poetry,
relays how poems have instructed him in all matter of political
lessons. Muske-Dukes riffs on Shelley's quote that "poets are the
unacknowledged legislators of the world" and imagines how a "Poets'
Congress would be motley but more eclectically read than any previous
legislative body, better at similes (President Yeltsin, you think
like a piroshki!), better at the bedrock iambic line ('Whose bill
this is I think I know....'), better at imagining authority figures
minus their clothes and in party hats. To prevent filibustering,
congressional members would occasionally be required to communicate
in haiku...."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the tell-all tales that fly off the supermarket shelves,
Muske-Dukes' gossip has a point, roundabout as the structure of the
essays sometimes seems. She tells all in the service of poetry. Her
prose is expansive, dreamy, but the slightly curled lip of cynicism
is never far from present. Her tone is in turn forceful and
forthright, bewildered and tearful, as she confronts the difficult
changes in her personal life and the world around her, but her
natural cadence is one of temperance.</TE>
<TE>   The book is dedicated to the memory of her husband, and the most
moving essay "Let Me Play the Lion Too: A Remembrance" recalls his
devotion to the art of acting and the theater. The quote "Let me play
the lion too" is from "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and speaks of his
desire "to play every part, like Bottom, wanting to transform the
self and regale the audience, the reader." They are also the words
inscribed on his gravestone.</TE>
<TE>   The juncture at which Hollywood and poets meet, if at all, is
usually an awkward one, but for Muske-Dukes it has always been full
of the magic of love and now includes the pain of loss. However, to
be an L.A. writer, one must be willing to eat lunch in this town on a
regular basis, and the chances that Muske-Dukes will continue to do
so are very good. As she quotes from Seamus Heaney's "The Cure at
Troy": "Suspect too much sweet talk, but never close your mind."</TE>

Enter his poet, Russell Sullivan. In his meticulously researched
"Rocky Marciano: The Rock of His Times," Sullivan reminds us that the
preternaturally powerful Marciano was one of the sweetest of the
sweet scientists to ever practice the art of bruising.</LD>
<LD>   The son of an immigrant shoe mill worker, Marciano was born in
1923 in Brockton, Mass. Rocky was a standout baseball and football
player in high school, but, to the consternation of his parents and
coaches, he dropped out in his sophomore year. He was drafted and
went overseas in 1943. In the service he was cajoled into lacing up
the gloves and, clumsy as he was, it was clear that he had the right
hand of Thor. After his discharge from the service and a bumbled
professional baseball tryout in 1947, Marciano answered his calling
as a boxer. Despite his very late start in boxing at 23 and his two
left feet, he won a couple of amateur titles.</LD>
<TE>   Then, like something out of the "Rocky" movies, Marciano called Al
Weill in New York City. Weill, the chief boxing impresario of his
day, and his genial trainer Charley Goldman agreed to set up an
audition for the diminutive Marciano, who at 5 feet, 11 inches and
185 pounds would have been a cruiserweight today. They put him in
with a big seasoned heavyweight, Wade Chancey. As Sullivan vividly
recounts, there were chuckles as Rocky launched wild haymakers and
tripped over himself, but then he landed a right hand and, as the
chorus of his faithful New England fans would soon learn to shout, it
was "Timmmmmberrr!" Weill agreed to keep an eye on Rocky but sent him
back to the pugilistic minors in Providence, R.I. Marciano, who may
have had the best right hand in heavyweight history, a punch he
dubbed "Susie Q," continued to turn on the black lights for everyone
he faced. Weill and Goldman were sold, and from there they marched
Marciano straight to the title.</TE>
<TE>   On the way, when Marciano was 37-0, he took on his guiding star,
Joe Louis. Marciano starched Louis in the eighth, jumped for joy at
the fact that he had arrived and then, sensitive hard guy that he
was, went to his locker room and wept for Louis. A year later in
1952, Marciano was in Philadelphia to challenge Jersey Joe Walcott
for the title. A master boxer, Jersey Joe took Marciano to school for
12 rounds but then in the 13th the Brockton Blockbuster separated
Walcott from his senses with a cannon shot that should be in the
Louvre of stylized violence.</TE>
<TE>   Freddie Brown, the legendary cut man for Marciano, worked out of
the gym where I trained. I used to press him for stories. Once he
told me about the night Marciano was getting cut to pieces by the
crafty Ezzard Charles. Brown said that Marciano's nose was cut so
badly that it looked as though it might come off. Rocky's corner was
thinking about tossing in the towel when their man told everyone to
calm down because he was going to put Charles to bed in the next
round. Marciano kept his word. I was eager to see whether Sullivan
would capture this moment in the net of his narrative. He did.</TE>
<TE>   After dispensing with Charles and a few other contenders, there
were no serious challengers left and Rocky quit boxing in 1956 with a
record of 49-0, the only heavyweight champion to retire undefeated.
Marciano died in a plane crash in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan argues that Rocky was the perfect icon for his times. The
table of virtues for the Cold War era included loyalty, simplicity,
patriotism and a respect for authority. Rocky was a paragon of all
these virtues. Yet as Sullivan contends, Marciano was also more
complex than he seemed. Beneath the easygoing surface, he was driven
by a heavyweight ambition to walk out of the invisibility of poverty
and become somebody. Though he was famous for his obedience to his
manager and trainers, he resented that his acceptance of authority
suggested to many that he could not string together a combination of
thoughts. Marciano was one of those rare individuals about whom it
seems no one has a bad word to say. Even the fighters that he iced
loved Marciano.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan acknowledges that Rocky "had a bizarre obsession with
money." When I talked with Freddie Brown, he blessed Marciano a
thousand times but could not help but add, "Rocky was the cheapest
guy I ever met. He would not pay for anything and kept every penny he
earned." But Rocky knew the story of Joe Louis and of other palookas,
and his dogged fears of being fleeced and ending up with nothing but
a pocketful of mumbles may not have been paranoia.</TE>
<TE>   While you would have to have a taste for the sweet science to
savor the delectable stories Sullivan spins around Marciano's big
fights, his book offers many illuminating glances into the world
around the ring. For a prime example, Sullivan explores the subtext
of race in the '50s by registering the views of the African American
press on Marciano (by and large, black writers applauded Marciano's
power but rooted for Walcott, Charles and Archie Moore). Like Roger
Kahn's magisterial history of the '20s ("A Flame of Pure Fire") as
seen through the discerning eye of someone studying the heavyweight
champ Jack Dempsey, Sullivan's book is not just a perfect paean to a
pugilistic hero but also to a history of mid-century America as
glimpsed from the corner window of what was then America's second
most popular sport, professional boxing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From 'Rocky Marciano'</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-five seconds into round six Marciano knocked Layne out....
What happened next was stunning. Everything seemed to stop. Then,
after two or three seconds of suspended animation, with each fighter
remaining motionless, Layne began to sink to the canvas with
delayed-action effect, slowly at first and then much more rapidly.
According to several ringside observers, the falling Layne looked
"like an elephant collapsing from a rifle shot" or "a ship sinking
into the sea." He dropped to the canvas face forward in a hunched
position. Once he hit the floor, he rolled over to his side and
curled up. He was out.</TE>

<LD>When I lay down, for the night, on the desert,</LD>
<LD>   on my back, and dozed, and my eyes opened,</LD>
<LD>   my gaze rushed up, as if falling up</LD>
<TE>   into the sky,</TE>
<TE>   and I saw the open eye of night, all</TE>
<TE>   guileless, all iris of a starshine grey,</TE>
<TE>   scattered with clusters of brilliant pupils.</TE>
<TE>   I gazed, and dozed, and as my eyelids lifted I would</TE>
<TE>   plummet up out of the atmosphere,</TE>
<TE>   plunging and gasping as if I'd missed</TE>
<TE>   a stair. I would sleep, and come to, and sleep,</TE>
<TE>   and every time that I opened my eyes</TE>
<TE>   I fell up deep into the universe.</TE>
<TE>   It looked crowded, hollow, intricate, elastic,</TE>

<TE>   entering another dimension, and yet</TE>
<TE>   one in which I belong, as if</TE>

<HD>Where Shelley rubs shoulders with Seinfeld</HD>
<DH>Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, 17th Edition, John
Bartlett, edited by Justin Kaplan, Little, Brown: 1,472 pp., $50</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Frederic Raphael</AU>
<BD>Frederic Raphael is the author, most recently, of
"Personal Terms," edited notebooks, 1950-69, and "All His Sons: A
Novella and Nine Stories."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Bartlett (1820-1905) was a pioneer in the now well-plowed field
of reference books. Although a native of Cambridge, Mass., he found
the great majority of his quotations in what was then called English
(today it has to be "British") literature. In preferring favorite
passages from longer works to sayings or quips, Bartlett anticipated
Gertrude Stein's "Remarks are not literature" (itself a remark, of
course). Unlike this one, the first edition even eschewed the Duke of
Gloucester's comment on Volume 2 of "The Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire": "Another damned thick, square book! Always scribble,
scribble, scribble. Eh, Mr Gibbon?"</LD>
<LD>   Here we have a damned thick one too. Mainly American in his
contemporary addenda, general editor Justin Kaplan has also gone back
both to Europe and to classical antiquity for a fat chunk of what
Bartlett ignored, or preceded. The latter's first edition came too
soon to register Oscar Wilde's most scintillating epigrams, but he
would surely have endorsed his successor's Wilde selection (49
entries). I am less confident of his applause for scriptwriters'
one-liners. Why would anyone look up "Taxi Driver's" Paul Schrader's
"You talkin' to me?" To check the spellin'?</LD>
<TE>   Dictionaries of quotations are the running buffets of literature:
If no single dish satisfies, you can at least get it fast. Bits and
pieces is all our culture now. With the proliferation of print and
verbiage, even an unsleeping, Methuselean bookworm could never read a
quarter of the world's acknowledged masterpieces. Who today would
dare to echo T.E. Lawrence (2 entries), who claimed to have read, as
a student, all the books in Oxford's Bodleian Library? The unsporting
Robert Graves (6) worked out that, even before World War I, Lawrence
would have had to read 300 books a day to make good his boast. Today,
it would be more like 3,000. We have no choice but to rely on
anthologists and epitomists.</TE>
<TE>   John Bartlett flattered his readers by assuming that they
resembled him (son of a bookseller) in being "familiar" with the
literature he culled, if only "with just enough of learning to
misquote," as Byron (151) put it. His lordship fails to evict the
later, prosaic and very similar Simeon Strunsky (1): "Famous remarks
are very seldom quoted correctly." That superfluous "very" should
alone have disqualified the gentleman.</TE>
<TE>   Of others who make the cut by virtue of a single entry, none is
more worthy than Joseph Nye Welch, who in 1954 said to Sen. Joseph
McCarthy, "Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you
no sense of decency?" Bartlett's does overlook the best monosyllabic
retort of recent history, though the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations
does not, U.S. Gen. Anthony McAuliffe's to the German demand that he
surrender Bastogne, Belgium, in December 1944: "Nuts." Louis XVIII of
France is in, for saying, "Punctuality is the politeness of kings,"
but not for his tenderly heartless one-word response to the dying
Talleyrand. When the old scoundrel told his majesty that he was
suffering "the torments of the damned," Louis only asked, "Deja?"
(Already?)</TE>
<TE>   The gourmand, faced with a sumptuous choice, will always remark
what is missing: for gaping instance, Letizia Bonaparte's reaction to
her son Napoleon's coronation as emperor of the French: "Pourvu que
ca dure" (Provided it lasts). The French, arguably the wittiest race,
are done no favors here. But then, as the Duc de la Rochefoucauld
suggested, there is something in their misfortunes which does not
wholly displease their friends.</TE>
<TE>   What writer can deny being a little like Cyril Connolly, who could
not pass an index without checking whether he was included? He would
be relieved that he makes it here, although not for "Narcissus with
his pool before him," an apt slogan for those who see their wit, or
fame, reflected here, nor yet for "It's closing time in the gardens
of the West," a slogan he coined for the outbreak of war in 1939,
which severed him from the France whose literature, and foie gras,
meant so much to him. Latin poet Horace's uncited self-description
"Epicuri de grege porcus" (a pig from Epicurus' herd) was always
Connolly's likeliest epitaph.</TE>
<TE>   Horace (104) is well represented, but a certain New England
prudishness (Kaplan is a Harvard professor) is evident: The Horatian
tag "Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum," translated as
"It's not everyone that can get to Corinth" is alluding not to "the
expense of the life there," as Kaplan notes, but to Corinth's
delectable courtesans.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Miller (2) gets in for "Every man with a bellyful of the
classics is an enemy to the human race," from "The Tropic of Cancer,"
but not for the famous turd-in-the-bidet passage from "Quiet Days in
Clichy." Jean Genet (3) is denied "Nous ne sortirons jamais de ce
bordel" (We'll never get out of this whorehouse/mess), which has a
thousand metaphorical uses. T.S. Eliot (130) has his posthumous
blushes spared by the omission of "the jew is underneath the lot."
But why no sign of Theodor Adorno's "It is barbarous to write a poem
after Auschwitz"?</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan alerts us to how much is recycled, not to say pirated, by
successive writers. Epicurus (3) is noted for "Death is nothing to
us, since when we are, death has not come, and when death has come,
we are not," which was echoed, but not here, by Ludwig Wittgenstein,
who rendered it: "Death is not an event of life, it is not lived
through." Gore Vidal (3) added a snappy gloss by saying that when any
of his friends has a success, he dies a little. Vidal will be
relieved that Truman Capote doesn't outscore him, but Norman Mailer
goes in one ahead (why no reference to his seminal Dissent article
about the "white Negro"?).</TE>
<TE>   Last words too have family resemblances. The emperor Augustus,
Rabelais and Lord Byron all offered variations on "e finita la
commedia," although only Rabelais is cited. Byron's friend Shelley
recalled Rabelais' comment about death being the "grand peut-etre"
(great maybe) when caught in a storm on Lake Leman. Lytton Strachey
gets in with his "If this is dying, then I don't think much of it,"
but I miss the theatrically superb last words of Sir Walter Raleigh
to the executioner, "Strike, man, what do you fear?"</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Babington Macaulay might have been unique if his
(apocryphal) first words had been quoted. He was supposedly silent
until the age of 3 or 4, when he banged his head. A lady later asked
if he felt better, to which he replied, "Thank you, madam, the pain
is somewhat abated." Pablo Picasso should have raised his score with
his definition of modern art as "a sum of destructions." He could
have displaced his verbose neighbor, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, whom
Peter Medawar conclusively debunked. Kaplan's lifeboat should have
been big enough to find a niche for Karl Popper, if only at the
expense of others.</TE>
<TE>   Since the entries are presented in the order of the authors'
births, it is tempting to draw a chart, giving weight for talent, to
discover the ups and downs of Western literature. It would begin on a
high, with the Bible and the classics, dip into the almost mute Dark
Ages, recover sharply with the Elizabethans, maintain a bullish
profile with Augustans and Romantics, and then surge again in the
Victorian age, before dropping toward the present.</TE>
<TE>   If you had to choose the single most illustrious five-year
vintage, from whenever BC till the present day, how could it not be
1871-75? Marcel Proust, Paul Valery, Bertrand Russell, Ford Madox
Ford, Colette, G.K. Chesterton, Karl Kraus and Thomas Mann, Rainer
Maria Rilke, Robert Frost and Walter de la Mare, Gertrude Stein,
Somerset Maugham, Stephen Crane and Winston Churchill form the
A-team; which leaves Max Beerbohm, Hilaire Belloc, Willa Cather,
Theodore Dreiser, not to mention Karl Jung, G.E. Moore, Maurice
Baring and John Buchan on standby.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan and his collaborators have, on the whole, done a valiantly
sustained job, knowing that they could never be sufficiently
comprehensive. I cannot, for instance, discover who said, "Why write
aphorisms? To help the mind lose weight." Among the aggrieved,
Dorothy Parker (10) might have winced at not being credited with her
remark at a dull Hollywood party after which, she presumed, the
guests would "crawl back into the woodwork." For citing Elton John
and Bernie Taupin as its authors, in the maudlin lyrics in memory of
Marilyn Monroe (later shamelessly recycled to shroud Princess Diana),
Kaplan risks incurring another of Mrs. Parker's uncited lines: "This
book is not to be tossed lightly aside, but to be hurled with great
force."</TE>
<TE>   I certainly do not take that view, but who can fail to be
conscious of how deep a dive that quality-control graph takes when it
comes to the modern samples? Comedian Jerry Seinfeld is a funny man,
but who needs his newspaper remark that "Everybody lies about sex.
People lie during sex. If it weren't for lies, there'd be no sex"?
For this, the author of "Les Liaisons Dangereuses," Choderlos de
Laclos, must be effaced? And how good for the ages is "Sesame Street"
with "It's not easy bein' green" or, come to that, the two most
recent presidents of the United States, quoted on the back of the
jacket? Our modern calves are rarely golden but, as Robert Graves
once said, about certain modern poets whom he scorned, "These be thy
gods, O Israel."</TE>

<LD>The 20th anniversary edition of "The River Why" gives those of us who
may have missed this classic a second chance at discovery. In the
novel, young Gus, spawn of a world-famous fly-fisherman and his
bait-fishing cowgirl bride, comes of age and makes a beeline for an
isolated cabin by a river, to live one man's version of the ideal
life: fishing every minute of every day. He leaves his father
(nicknamed H2O), his mother (The River Ma) and his mystical younger
brother Billy Bob, and the comforts of home, including the daily
dinner debates like fly versus bait or "The Great Izaak Walton
Controversy." Gus' solitude lasts until he becomes a local legend for
his fishing prowess and until he is rendered inarticulate and
ineffectual by a fleeting vision of a mysterious and beautiful female
angler. "There's not much more to tell," Gus tells us in "The Last
Chapter." "It was of the line of light and of the touch of the hand
of love that I wanted to speak."</LD>
<TE>   "The River Why" found its audience, and "My Story as Told by
Water," a 2001 collection of essays, explains how David James Duncan
chose his writing path. He is often compared to Norman Maclean,
though Duncan writes that his bank account certainly bears no
resemblance to Maclean's. Their books, however, "speak in long,
idiosyncratic sentences of rivers, fly-fishing, and beloved but
inscrutable younger brothers; both were rejected by every big
publisher in the land before being taken up by small presses; both
were read by hundreds of thousands."</TE>
<TE>   But Duncan confesses, "I would gladly give up 'The River Why' and
all it's given me if I could get back the waters that inspired the
book in the first place," all the creeks and rivers of his childhood
that have been polluted and destroyed. In "My Story as Told by
Water," he describes a childhood spent moving from one beautiful
place to another, chased by developments that erased their beauty
like so many words on a page. Duncan's adulthood has been spent off
the grid: "Capitalist fundamentalism, I still believe, is the perfect
Techno-Industrial religion, its goal being a planet upon which we've
nothing left to worship, worry about, read, eat, or love but dollar
bills and Bibles."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "I play music with animals -- granted, an unusual vocation,"
confesses Jim Nollman, who is not a scientist, not a painter, not a
professional musician, but a strange, new unabashed species of
naturalist. "A collaborator once described what I do as 'just two
warm-blooded mammals out on the water getting into a groove.' "
Nollman, who founded a nonprofit called Interspecies Inc., has for 25
years traveled the globe to play music to beluga and other whale
species, dolphins, monkeys, moose, caribou and ravens. As a writer
and as a naturalist, he is more irreverent than sanctimonious, doing
what he does just for the pure fun of it.</TE>
<TE>   "The Beluga Cafe" begins in 1987, when Nollman and a friend
traveled up to the Mackenzie Delta in Alaska and to the Beaufort Sea
to play music (using underwater speakers and recorders) to belugas.
It did not take long for them to be labeled "Greenpeacers" by the
local Inuit whale hunters, in spite of the fact that Nollman and his
friend are neither for nor against native whale hunting, as long as
the hunt does not involve "mindless tapping into the macroeconomy ...
no spring-steel animal traps, no Boston Whalers with twin Mercs. No
Old Crow hidden beneath the floorboards. No floorboards." Some of the
natives think it's great; others suspect the two are playing orca
sounds to scare away the belugas. Nollman dreams of his detractors
one night: Ted Koppel on Nightline saying, "Is it interspecies
communication or just one man's fantasy?" And "a frowning Miles
Davis" saying to them all, beyond the grave, "Hey man, get a life."</TE>

<LD>Ruby River, Lynn Pruett, Atlantic Monthly Press: 280 pp., $24</LD>
<LD>   Lynn Pruett is one of those good-natured Southern writers who draw
you in with their gentle drawl. Soon enough, all those tart asides
about small-town busybodies, lighthearted intimations of bad behavior
and hunger-inducing references to homemade pie are growing on you
like kudzu. Try to resist, and you quickly discover that it's
downright impolite to walk away when Pruett has so much to tell.</LD>
<LD>   After all, "Ruby River" is classic town gossip, the kind typically
served up with strong coffee or sweet iced tea. Appropriately enough,
it centers around Bohannan's truck stop, a bustling hive of
polyunsaturated fat and controversy located in Maridoches, Ala., on
the banks of the Ruby River.</LD>
<TE>   Hattie Bohannan is the can-do widow of Oakley Bohannan, a former
military hero, now "Missing in Traction": While Hattie waits for
Oakley's ashes to return from the Veterans Administration, she
plunges into the restaurant biz, opening Bohannan's and becoming a
stickler for ripe tomatoes. The headstrong Hattie, with "her smooth
clear skin that hinted of expensive treatments, old Atlanta, and
inner peace," is an obvious target for the sniping Ladies of the
Church of the Holy Resurrection.</TE>
<TE>   After her daughter Jessamine is discovered carrying on with a
married man and a prostitute named Ash Lee is found working
Bohannan's parking lot, the old bags at the church -- led by the
lustful, misogynistic Rev. Martin Peterson -- vow to stamp out this
thriving center of wanton harlotry. Not surprisingly, hilarity and
hypocrisy ensue.</TE>
<TE>   But what is surprising is the grace with which Pruett orchestrates
what, in lesser hands, could be a thudding farce. Hattie is a
compelling widow: a capable yet vulnerable Southern lady inching her
way into a relationship with the sheriff, trying to keep a lid on
three daughters (and a fourth who is actually Jessamine's) and
occasionally showering Rev. Peterson with rocks.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Hattie Bohannan may well lose her beloved truck stop
to rampaging fundamentalists intent on opening an evangelical
steakhouse, but, with her common sense and top-notch chili, she's
already won us over.</TE>

<TE>   Your Mouth Is Lovely, Nancy Richler, Ecco Press: 358 pp., $25.95</TE>
<TE>   "As a people we've tended to dwell on the past and ignore the
future. For centuries we've done that, and where has it gotten us?"
So asks Bayla, a budding revolutionary in Nancy Richler's ambitious
novel about a political prisoner held in Siberia following the
uprisings that swept Russia in 1905.</TE>
<TE>   Miriam is the name of Richler's sympathetic teenage heroine, and
she grows up in a Jewish ghetto amid superstition, crushing orthodoxy
and the vise grip of industrial capitalism. She's raised by her
feckless father and a formidable stepmother, Bayla's big sister
Tsila, a haughty seamstress given to tough love: "You're a big girl,
almost a woman," she informs Miriam. "It's time you lift yourself
from the grave of your own morbidity."</TE>
<TE>   But the way Miriam lifts herself isn't what her hard-nut stepmom
has in mind. While Tsila scorns her neighbors as unenlightened fools,
she isn't ready for the response to unfair working conditions,
pogroms and cholera outbreaks cooked up by the likes of Bayla and the
upstart, anti-tsarist Bundists whom Miriam falls in with.</TE>
<TE>   Bayla, it turns out, is an expert bomb maker, and with every page,
"Your Mouth Is Lovely" transforms from being a magical shtetl
portrait into something more incendiary. The enigmatic title comes
from a traditional blessing upon infants; "Your Mouth Is Lovely" is
suffused with the lyricism of the ancient texts and their seductive
mythologies.</TE>
<TE>   But, poised between past and future, Miriam gravitates toward
newer, more compelling mythologies whose scriptures are written in
pamphlets and expressed by exploding shrapnel. It's a fascinating
historical turning point: The monarchy is crumbling, the proletariat
is finally getting a leg up, and the Jews of Kiev are departing for
New York, Montreal and Buenos Aires. And it's beautifully told by
Richler, through the eyes of one girl who ends up in Siberia for her
tiny role in changing the world.</TE>

<HD>Potters' world ends with a bang and a whimper</HD>
<DH>A Whistling Woman, A Novel, A.S. Byatt, Alfred A. Knopf:
432 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Merle Rubin</AU>
<BD>Merle Rubin is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The work of A.S. Byatt is best known for summoning up the spirits of
ages past. One has only to think of her Darwinian fable of Victorian
love and perversity in the 1992 book "Angels and Insects" or of her
Booker Prize-winning novel, "Possession" (1990), a story of passion
between two Victorian poets and the modern-day scholars studying
them.</LD>
<LD>   But what will likely prove to be her most impressive
accomplishment is not these tales of another century but the
roman-fleuve she has been writing for the last 25 years about the
Potters, a plain-living, high-minded Yorkshire family in some ways
similar to her own. With "A Whistling Woman," the fourth and final
novel of this sequence, Byatt rounds off her searching,
multidimensional portrait of postwar British life in the 1950s and
1960s and takes her place as a major novelist of our era.</LD>
<LD>   Like Ford Madox Ford's tetralogy of World War I, "Parade's End,"
and Evelyn Waugh's World War II trilogy, "Sword of Honor," Byatt's
tetralogy conveys an intimate sense of the texture of day-to-day life
while affording a sweeping overview of the transformations of an age.
With consummate skill and inventiveness, she creates a large cast of
characters whose intertwining stories form a richly evocative
tapestry.</LD>
<TE>   If, in America, we tend to think of the 1950s as a decade of
constriction and conformity, the first two novels of Byatt's
tetralogy remind us that in Britain it was a time of awakening and
opening up. In "The Virgin in the Garden," published in 1978, Byatt
introduced us to the Potters: the erudite, defiantly atheistic
schoolmaster father; his well-educated but quieter wife; their
introverted, mathematically gifted son, Marcus; and their two
intellectually formidable daughters -- gentle, blond, scholarly
Stephanie and spiky, redheaded, clever Frederica. This is a family
for whom literature matters: Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Blake,
George Eliot and D.H. Lawrence are real presences in their mental
lives.</TE>
<TE>   In "Still Life" (1985), we watched the newly married Stephanie
trying to adjust to domesticity after a brilliant career at
Cambridge, while undergraduate Frederica pondered the meaning of
metaphor and sampled the charms of various young men. The upheavals
of the mid-1960s shaped the narrative of "Babel Tower" (1996) in
which Frederica fled a bad marriage and became involved in a
censorship case, defending a book she wasn't sure she approved of.</TE>
<TE>   The dynamic of social and cultural change builds toward a shocking
culmination in "A Whistling Woman," set in 1968-1970, a time when the
expansive hopes of the 1950s and early 1960s are shaken by violent
protest, a burgeoning interest in the irrational and a general
breakdown of norms and standards.</TE>
<TE>   Like the weird whistling creatures, half-woman, half-bird, in the
fairy tale that opens this novel, Frederica is a woman in transition.
She is no longer sure what she wants of her love life, only learning
from her disastrous marriage that trusting one's instincts can be a
big mistake. Living in London and teaching part time, she raises her
8-year-old son, Leo, and feels exasperated by demands for a
dumbed-down curriculum as student revolt rears its callow head. Asked
to host a highbrow BBC television show, Frederica is torn between the
scholarly life and the glamour of television, which her BBC producer
thinks will change the world:</TE>
<TE>   "Frederica ... said she thought [television] might take the place
of the hearth in nineteenth-century fiction, the coals where Dickens'
characters saw the generation of fantastic images, the warmth around
which stories were read aloud, or told, or lived.</TE>
<TE>   " 'You are still thinking in terms of novels,' said [the
producer]. 'But yes, that's just, that's very just. I was thinking
also of Plato's Cave, with the fire and the shadows.'</TE>
<TE>   " 'Novels won't go away.'</TE>
<TE>   " 'That remains to be seen.'</TE>
<TE>   " 'We need images made of language.' "</TE>
<TE>   In Frederica's native Yorkshire, the university's vice-chancellor
is organizing a symposium where linguists, biologists, psychologists
and other savants will discuss questions about cognition, learning,
innate and acquired intelligence. Returning there to do a BBC program
on the symposium, Frederica witnesses its violent disruption by
student demonstrators. She also sees her family, including her
nephew, who has become interested in a local cult-like community
known as the Spirit's Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   Defying the oversimplified notion of the 1960s as a battle between
a culture and a counterculture, Byatt creates three distinct milieus
that overlap in surprising ways. Largest and most diverse is the
world of liberal, humanist values that includes Frederica, her
family, friends and the symposium. The second is the soi-disant
"anti-university" sprouting like a mushroom on the university's
outskirts.</TE>
<TE>   But it is the third milieu that is Byatt's most brilliant -- in
many ways, awe-inspiring -- creation. This is that strange
therapeutic community called Spirit's Tigers, which is transforming
itself into a religious cult. What makes this community so
extraordinary is that, for all intents and purposes, it is not a
fake, and Joshua Ramsden, the charismatic man at its spiritual
center, is not a charlatan: He is a genuine religious mystic. He is
sane enough to know that the visions and voices he sees and hears do
not actually exist in the outside world. Yet he also feels certain
that they are not just inside his head.</TE>
<TE>   Up until now, the Spirit's Tigers have been led by Gideon Farrar,
a standard '60s guru who preaches peace and love, and puts the latter
precept into practice by having sex with his besotted female
followers. But once Joshua enters the picture, Gideon is consigned to
the margins. Severely ascetic, averse to touching -- let alone having
sex with -- other people, Joshua effortlessly commands the group's
allegiance almost in spite of himself. His Gnostic-Manichaean vision
of matter as evil, and life as a battle between darkness and light,
exercises a powerful appeal, which Byatt does a remarkable job of
conveying.</TE>
<TE>   The community's resident psychoanalyst, Elvet Gander, is as
affected as the others. "It would be so very easy to mock our
doings," he writes to a colleague back in the normal world. "The
English style is fatally mocking -- we can only have the Sublime, it
seems, if we include the grotesque as a safeguard. So yes, we were
absurd, a lot of predominantly middle-aged English people ...
prancing, round a bonfire.... The sky was full of sparks, and stars
beyond the sparks. I felt. I felt -- why not? Why can't we have back
the tyger burning bright, and the burning lamb, and the Tree of
Life.... Why can't there be singing and ritual and meaning and a
grand purpose, as men once thought there was?" Although Joshua's
visions are shown to lead to self-immolation, Byatt invests them with
an unearthly, chilling grandeur.</TE>
<TE>   Not only does Byatt handle her many characters, themes and milieus
with authority and finesse, she also weaves them into a satisfyingly
coherent whole. Like Iris Murdoch, an anatomist of love, she explores
the heady world of romance among the highly endowed. She can create
characters who shine with intelligence and individuality, and she
shares something of Murdoch's uncanny sensitivity to the nuances of
erotic relationships. Science as well as literature come into her
ken. Luk Lysgaard Peacock, a researcher on how snails learn, is in
love with his colleague Jacqueline, who happens to be in love with
the painfully shy Marcus Potter. The university's dean of students,
cultivated, elegant Vincent Hodgkiss, is also in love with Marcus,
who's in love with a girl who has joined the Spirit's Tigers. And a
new love awaits Frederica.</TE>
<TE>   It is no easy thing to come up with a satisfying ending to any
novel, let alone a novel that serves as the ending of an entire
sequence. "The end is always the most unreal bit," Frederica tells
little Leo and his friends when they complain about the inadequate
conclusion of the fairy tale being read to them at the novel's
outset. But the children are right to demand a "real ending," one
that "leaves no sense of let-down, or half-measure, or thinness, or
turning-away of imaginative intensity," which is what Frederica
herself finds on rereading Dostoevsky's "The Idiot."</TE>
<TE>   Gathering up the various characters and themes of the previous
novels, "A Whistling Woman" pours them into a kind of crucible. Out
of this emerges an imaginatively intense vision that captures the
dangers of a turbulent era while affirming the enduring humanistic
values that help keep us from going over the brink.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From 'A Whistling Woman'</TE>
<TE>   And across the wet turf, over the dry-stone walls, the snails slid
fluently, creating an intricate net of silvery ribbons, their shells
glistening with water, their dove-grey translucent bodies glistening
with their own secretions, their fine horns wavering before them,
testing the air, peering quietly around. Their shells were variegated
and lovely, some a delicate lemon, some a deep rose, some a greenish
soot-black, some striped boldly in dark spirals on buff, some with
creamy spirals on rose, some with a single band of dark on gold, some
like ghosts, greyish-white coiled on chalk-white ...</TE>

<HD>Looking without seeing</HD>
<DH>Los Angeles: People, Places, and the Castle on the Hill,
A.M. Homes, National Geographic Directions: 174 pp., $20</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David L. Ulin</AU>
<BD>David L. Ulin is the editor of "Another City: Writing
From Los Angeles" (City Lights) and of "Writing Los Angeles: A
Literary Anthology," recently published by the Library of America.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For as long as there has been a Los Angeles, writers have arrived
from elsewhere to tell us what it means. They fly or drive or take
the train in, then spend a few weeks marveling at the local customs
before returning to Baltimore, London or New York to report on what
they've found. In the 1920s, such writers were named H.L. Mencken and
Aldous Huxley (although Huxley later became a born-again Southern
Californian, living here from 1937 until his death in 1963); in the
1930s, Edmund Wilson; in the 1940s, Evelyn Waugh and Simone de
Beauvoir; and in the 1950s, Norman Mailer, whose Hollywood novel "The
Deer Park" remains one of the most scabrous portraits of the
Southland ever penned. Since then, the trend has (at least partially)
abated, as L.A. has produced its own commentators, who write less
from a perspective of exoticism than an enduring sense of place.
Still, every now and again, we find ourselves in the presence of yet
another outsider who has come to Los Angeles with the idea of
explaining it, as if no one had ever passed this way before.</LD>
<TE>   The latest author to fall prey to this illusion is the New York
novelist A.M. Homes, whose "Los Angeles: People, Places, and the
Castle on the Hill" recalls a visit to Southern California in the
winter of 2001. I say "fall prey" because "Los Angeles" is less a
book about the city than an example of how not to write a book about
the city, a recycling of cliches, superficialities and prejudgments
dressed up to look like a loose travelogue. It's odd, because in her
fiction, Homes has always been an astute observer, piercing the
hypocrisies of middle-class life with a penetrating eye. Here,
however, she can't get out from under her own preconceptions, as if
L.A. were less a physical landscape than an elaborately amorphous
fantasy.</TE>
<TE>   "I chose Los Angeles," she writes in a brief preface, "because it
feels like one of the most American cities in America right now.
Simultaneously a city of the future and the past, the American Dream
continues to thrive here and the city remains a mythological mecca,
an epicenter for visionaries, romantics, and dreamers. And Los
Angeles is perhaps the most surreal place in America. In fact and
fiction, its landscapes, hills, and valleys are the backdrop against
which our postmodern lifestyle plays itself out and our national
anxieties and influences are thrown into relief."</TE>
<TE>   These are big claims, but throughout "Los Angeles" Homes' vision
is too narrow to address them on any but the most facile terms. The
difficulties begin with her opening sentence: "The problem with Los
Angeles is that it's not in New York." Although we soon discover that
she is talking about distance and her fear of flying, the statement
sets an unfortunate tone of provincialism that permeates the book.
For Homes, it's impossible to imagine that anyone -- anyone outside a
certain rarefied realm, that is -- inhabits the dreamscape of Los
Angeles or that the city might have an identity of its own. Instead,
her L.A. is defined by friends like John Waters, Griffin Dunne and
Jennifer Beals, and locations such as the Chateau Marmont (the Castle
on the Hill of the book's subtitle), where she stays because "[a]mong
the guests, there are always people from New York." As "Los Angeles"
progresses, in fact, the Chateau becomes increasingly the filter
through which Homes views the city, until she barely makes the
pretense of leaving the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Were this a different kind of book, Homes' reticence might not be
such a problem; writers from Kay Thompson to Arthur Hailey have
written vividly about hotel life. Yet where she gets into trouble is
in assuming that the Chateau is somehow representative, that what she
finds there can be applied to Los Angeles at large. As such, she
misses out on any opportunity the city offers to connect with its
wide array of people and communities, from Koreatown to the Valley,
Silver Lake to East L.A. This, in turn, gives her observations the
quality of faded photographs left too long in the sun. Rather than
riding a bus down Wilshire Boulevard (the most traveled public
transportation corridor in the United States), she tells us, somewhat
sniffily, "From the moment you arrive in Los Angeles, it is about the
car." Instead of visiting the Bradbury Building or immersing herself
in the collections at the Huntington, she writes off L.A. life as
"steeped in twelve-step culture -- everything is just for today."
When, toward the end of the book, she declares that "[w]ith the
exception of a few lizardy old ladies discreetly tucked into the
booths of the Hotel Bel Air at lunch time -- faces tight as a drum,
hands now gnarly claws -- it is as if old people are banned from the
city of Los Angeles," I have to wonder how she could have missed the
Fairfax District, which is, after all, just a mile or so downhill
from the Chateau. And then there's this, my personal favorite
observation: "In Los Angeles, ... I am that dark and mystical thing,
a woman from the East, an 'intellectual' " -- as if L.A., by
definition, had no intellectual life of its own.</TE>
<TE>   Such a conceit strikes me as uncomfortably self-serving,
reflecting less Los Angeles than the myths by which Homes frames
herself. To be fair, this comes with the territory, for travel
literature often relies on the tension between sensibility and place.
Yet in "Los Angeles," tension arises not from Homes' engagement but
her disconnection, her inability to immerse herself in the city at
large. Even when she ventures out of the Chateau, she keeps her
distance, relying on a series of interviews -- with, among others,
the director of the Southern California Earthquake Center, four
residents of the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund Retirement
Community and the artist Mark Bennett, who also works as a Beverly
Hills mailman -- presented in a Q&amp;A style as if she couldn't be
bothered to develop three-dimensional scenes.</TE>
<TE>   "[R]ather than processing their words and making them my own, I
wanted these voices to be represented," she writes by way of
explanation, but ultimately that seems a cop-out, for the interviews
are flat, distracted, as if conducted out of obligation, not desire.
In the middle of the book, for instance, Homes visits Dr. Fred Kogen,
the "mohel of Beverly Hills," who declares, "Oh, I can tell you
stories, funny stories about that. How many stories do you want?"
It's a perfect opening, but she fails to capitalize, announcing, as
if there were a meter running, that she's "almost out of time."
Worse, when Kogen asks her to accompany him to a circumcision, she
lets the invitation drop without response.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, all this represents a lost opportunity, a chapter
left unwritten, an experience undone. Even more, though, it becomes a
metaphor for the entire volume, which never evokes its subject in any
satisfying sense. That may or may not have to do with Homes' status
as an outsider, but surely it suggests a lack of absorption, of
curiosity, in the city and its life. The best travel literature,
after all, involves authors learning something, whether about the
world or themselves. They land in a place and explore it, taking away
something (a bit of insight, or information) they didn't already
know. Yet in "Los Angeles," such a process is strangely absent,
almost as if Homes had never left New York.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Oh what a tangled web we weave,</LD>
<LD>   When first we practise to deceive! -- Sir Walter Scott</LD>
<LD>   But that's the point, isn't it? And Henning Mankell's Inspector
Wallander is there to unravel it sooner or later in "Firewall." But
Kurt Wallander is getting on, and the life that he must cope with
fits him as well as a suit cut for a larger man. He has been
diagnosed with diabetes, his energy is low, he is world-weary, sick
of senseless creatures who beat on each other in an arbitrary world.
He forgets his cell phone, or carries it turned off; he forgets his
wallet on his desk, his notepad, his glasses and, for all we know,
his false teeth as well; he drives jerkily and too fast; he's given
to sudden rages. Around him society has turned brittle, the young
opaque, adults perplexed, friends fickle, relationships precarious,
colleagues undependable, existence lonesome and unmoored. To soothe
his loneliness, he even sends an ad to the local newspaper's
personals section, hoping to find companionship (and sex).</LD>
<TE>   We are, as ever, in Ystad, in southern Sweden. Two girls brutally
murder a taxi driver. "What's happened to the world?" "I don't know."
"They're just young girls." "I know, I know. And they have no remorse
at all." One of the girls walks out of police custody and vanishes;
the other accuses Wallander of unprovoked aggression. Then, a man
falls dead beside an ATM; a blackout cuts power to Ystad and a large
area around it; a corpse found at the malfunctioning power substation
turns out to be that of the girl who walked off; and the corpse of
the man at the ATM disappears from the morgue. Clearly, security in
Swedish morgues, police and power stations leaves something to be
desired. Meanwhile, "the Swedish justice system is degenerating into
a crumbling warehouse of unsolved cases."</TE>
<TE>   Not to worry. The mystery turns out to be connected to electronics
and computers: what they can do and undo, what can be done with them,
what can be done to them. The police investigation turns into
long-range hacking and breaching of codes and firewalls; the crucial
sleuths will be techies, geeks and nerds. So Wallander was right:
Perhaps it's time to quit. But not while the fate of society hangs in
the balance. Only inches from failure, he will nonetheless solve the
case, or preside over its solution to keep the soft underbelly of our
society from frying. And, just to reassure him (and his faithful
addicts), his semi-estranged daughter, Linda, decides to follow in
his footsteps and become a policewoman. But unraveling a tangle
leaves one at an obtuse angle.</TE>
<TE>   And why shouldn't attorneys write novels not just of procedure and
suspense, but of stylish sleuthing through sentiment, emotions,
intimacies, human weakness and making the best of not-quite-getting
what you had hoped to get? Scott Turow's latest, "Reversible Errors,"
is about ambition, affection, attraction, hope, anger and
dissembling; about two love affairs blundering toward resolution; and
about the power of law, which, at its drabbest, is about words on a
page and tricks of a trade, but also about life and death. In the
end, law saves lives or ruins them, or ends them. Or perhaps people
do.</TE>
<TE>   Turow's people are as slippery and mutable as the law in practice.
Their reasons are often unreasonable. Their values are fungible.
Their memories are fallible or slovenly or sly. Their stories keep
changing: the tales they tell to police, to their lawyers, to their
lovers, to their friends, to themselves. And all of this matters
because a poor soul awaiting execution for a triple murder committed
long ago has decided to recant the confession on which his sentence
was based. As his court-appointed defenders follow the trail of
evidence and turn up a great deal more than anyone suspected, the
condemned man's guilt becomes less clear, but each alternative
explanation that might exculpate him adds to the murkiness of the
case. The more testimony, new evidence, confessions and allegations
the investigators gather, the more perplexing the conundrums they
face. The more vics, wits and possible perps talk, the greater their
confusion, and the reader's.</TE>
<TE>   Turow has constructed a mazy, tortuous tale, as easy to misread as
it is to read. In legal parlance, a reversible error is a mistake so
significant that an appellate court must set aside the judgment that
was based on it. But errors may prove more reversible in court than
they are in life. Crooks and criminals may yet be pardoned, saved.
Can error-prone, self-destructive, unimpeachable adults hope for as
much?</TE>

<HD>NPR goes a little show biz</HD>
<DH>'Morning Edition' will run a serial radio play with
Hollywood actors, plus the program's host and a reporter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Dutka</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>National Public Radio's East Coast executives were in town en masse
six weeks ago to usher in the opening of NPR's new West Coast studios
-- Hollywood-style. There was no party at Spago, no red carpet;
instead, they were attending the world premiere of an unlikely
project: a five-part radio play running this week on the network's
most popular news program, "Morning Edition With Bob Edwards."</LD>
<LD>   "I'd Rather Eat Pants," recorded Nov. 1 at the Museum of
Television &amp; Radio in Beverly Hills, is an L.A. Theatre Works
production of a Peter Ackerman play specially commissioned for NPR.
Each 8 1/2-minute segment will air locally on public radio stalwarts
KCRW-FM (89.9) and KPCC-FM (89.3).</LD>
<LD>   Edwards and "Morning Edition" special correspondent Susan
Stamberg, a longtime fan of the L.A. Theatre Works troupe, share the
stage with such show business veterans as Edward Asner, Anne Meara
and Ed Begley Jr. -- Edwards as host of "Morning Edition" and
Stamberg as a reporter on the show.</LD>
<TE>   "Both are playing outsized versions of themselves," "Morning
Edition" senior producer Susan Feeney said of the news contingent.
"We're poking fun, a bit. Because our audience is incredibly loyal,
we're able to try new things."</TE>
<TE>   Though NPR announcers have appeared in news-related or promotional
skits over the years, the network has never folded an original
production -- this one almost vaudevillian in feel -- into its most
important news offering.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't an easy sell. Immersion in local culture ("Hollywood,
show biz") may herald NPR's expanding acknowledgment of the West and
a lessening of "East Coast bias," said "Morning Edition" executive
producer Ellen McDonnell. But the NPR executives, after all, had an
institution to protect.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a news producer and I come up with the idea of putting what
is essentially a soap opera in the middle of 'Morning Edition,' a
23-year-old show with 13 million listeners," McDonnell recalled after
the sold-out taping. "That would give anyone pause. No one understood
what I was talking about. But they never said 'no.' "</TE>
<TE>   The idea got off the ground after a lunch last June attended by
McDonnell, Feeney, Stamberg and Susan Loewenberg, Theatre Works'
producing director. After a programming executive discovered an
unused grant slotted -- amazingly -- for "radio drama," Ackerman
("Things You Shouldn't Say Past Midnight") was asked to write a
40-minute, Los Angeles-themed play in which each of the five acts
ends in a cliffhanger. The program would run at holiday time, they
figured, when everyone needs a boost.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Gordon Hunt ("Frasier," "Mad About You"), the story
revolves around the Peppersteins -- a duplicitous New York couple who
hook up with Wisdom (Derek Cecil), a California surfer dude whose
brain, they're convinced, is "pierced."</TE>
<TE>   Traveling cross-country on his motorcycle, they land in the office
of Barney Kikkle, an unscrupulous Hollywood agent on the lam from the
mob. After some wacky encounters (including a bizarre reunion with
their long-lost daughter), the onetime grocery store owners land
their own reality show and are interviewed by "Susan Stamberg, Culver
City."</TE>
<TE>   One of the early hosts of "All Things Considered," Stamberg admits
to being a ham. Though radio still appeals, she jokes about giving up
her day job. "Susan thinks she's going to be 'discovered' and get a
film contract," McDonnell said. "I keep reminding her it's a bit
part."</TE>
<TE>   Stamberg rehearsed for two days -- considerably less than the rest
of the cast, which also includes Dan Castellaneta, Clea Lewis,
Kendall Schmidt, Jonathan Banks and Emily Bergl. "It's so different
from what we do: grabbing a story, turning it around, getting it out
and on to the next," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards was dazzled by the chance to rub elbows with Meara, Asner
and Begley, personalities he says he used to watch before rising
early for "Morning Edition" made prime-time viewing off-limits.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm star-struck," Edwards said. "It's great to be surrounded by
people who make a living through laughs. Since I've missed 23 years
of prime-time viewing and know little of popular culture, these
people are my references. I just heard that Mary Tyler Moore has gone
off the air."</TE>
<TE>   Some in the NPR community find theater and news an odd fit,
reflective of an overall softening in the network's reportage. For
Edwards, it's a welcome respite from the daily diet of war, famine
and disease.</TE>
<TE>   "We need something to restore the humanity -- 'please let me
believe in something' -- and lighten things up," Edwards said. "On
other outlets, you get that all the time with the occasional serious
story. We're just the opposite."</TE>
<TE>   KPCC news director Paul Glickman agrees. "One of the problems NPR
has is the image of being stodgy and overly earnest, so this is a
step in the right direction," he said. "Still, putting on more than
40 minutes of comedy -- the hardest form of writing -- in the space
of five days is a risk ... an ambitious experiment, I'd say."</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain: The exposure will be good for Loewenberg,
whose company performs in "The Play's the Thing" -- a show airing
Saturdays at 8 p.m. on KPCC.</TE>
<TE>   "Plays normally get relegated to low-listening periods," she said.
"Being on in drive time is pretty impossible because it's hard to
compete with [NPR's] 'Car Talk' or 'An American Life.' I hope this
serves as a great hors d'oeuvre before the main course, our two-hour
show."</TE>

<LD>The nominations are in for 2002, and it's time to announce America's
newest cultural hot spot. New York? Not this time, paisano. How about
Austin? Chapel Hill? San Jose? Nope, none of those gleaming New
Economy towns.</LD>
<LD>   The winner, believe it or not, is Detroit, one of the scrappiest,
most soulful burgs in the nation -- as well as one of the most
complex and misrepresented. Detroit, a.k.a. Hockeytown, where the
fans at Joe Louis Arena are as tough as the players slamming each
other out on the ice. Detroit, longtime urban boogeyman of the
national imagination, where the citizenry used to vent its anger and
despair by torching the town on Devil's Night (Oct. 30) in the '80s
and early '90s. Detroit, which columnist Frank Rich of the New York
Times, in a profile of Detroit-bred rapper Eminem, recently dubbed
"America's closest approximation of hell."</LD>
<LD>   Yeah, yeah. For years Detroiters have weathered the slurs and
swallowed the bad jokes. Most insults were uttered by people who've
probably never set foot south of 8 Mile Road, which divides Detroit
proper from its northern suburbs.</LD>
<TE>   But culturally speaking, the Motor City has been on a roll lately,
for reasons that tend to elude national trend watchers and fashion
arbiters. A geographic and cultural anomaly -- it is the only major
U.S. city that looks south into Canada -- Detroit is a blue-collar
Midwestern metropolis invented by French Canadian fur trappers, then
reinvented by Appalachian and Mississippi Delta migrants who came to
work in the auto plants.</TE>
<TE>   "Manual labor" isn't a dirty term in Detroit, whether you're a
stamping plant worker or a guitar player. It's a place of proud
working-class sentiments and long memories, where the populace draws
solidarity and inspiration by huddling against outsiders' negative
perceptions. A city where a do-it-yourselfer aesthetic substitutes
for the creativity-by-committee approach of corporate Hollywood and
its ilk. Former auto worker Berry Gordy brilliantly fused all these
local tendencies when he used assembly-line techniques to recruit,
train and popularize his Motown music empire.</TE>
<TE>   With its miles of blighted buildings and boarded-up factories,
Detroit still has a long, hard road ahead of it. But in its blunt
way, the Motor City is showing that cultural vitality isn't always
picturesque. Nor is it usually achieved without hardship and
struggle. "Detroit had more than its share of problems," says Marilyn
Wheaton, director of the city's Cultural Affairs Department. "But get
over it. It's coming back."</TE>
<TE>   Having worked in downtown Detroit for five years in the early to
mid-'90s, I heard plenty of chamber of commerce palaver about
Detroit's "comeback," which always seemed to be just around the
corner. But there are signs that the "Renaissance City" is emerging
from its 30-year-long Dark Ages, a period that followed Detroit's
1967 riots, the worst in modern U.S. history until L.A.'s civic
unrest in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   A creative hub</TE>
<TE>   Detroit, a three-quarters African American city of just under a
million, is a hub of magnificent Art Deco skyscrapers, elegant parks
and grand, if faded, homes. It has given the world the
mass-production automobile, the Motown sound, techno dance music,
Robin Williams, Tim Allen, Alice Cooper, Aretha Franklin, Jackie
Wilson, Francis Ford Coppola and the Coney Island chili hot dog, a
confection perhaps only a bred-to-the-bone Detroiter can love.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Detroit neo-garage rock bands like the White Stripes and
the Detroit Cobras are kicking out the jams at venues across the
country. Last Memorial Day weekend, 1.5 million people attended the
Detroit Electronic Music Festival, the largest draw for such an event
anywhere, and a fitting tribute to the city where Derrick May and
Kevin Saunderson pioneered beat-driven, computer-generated dance
music.</TE>
<TE>   "What is the connecting thread with Detroit music? A kind of
earthiness, I think, directness, no-nonsense. And also isolation,
because we're not on either coast, so things tend to incubate here,"
says Susan Whitall, a writer for the Detroit News and author of a
book about the women of Motown.</TE>
<TE>   Several of this fall's best films use Detroit as their
indispensable backdrop. They include "Standing in the Shadows of
Motown," an affectionate documentary about the studio musicians who
backed up the Temptations, Supremes and other '60s R&amp;B acts; and, of
course, "8 Mile," Curtis Hanson's gritty biopic about Eminem.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Moore's documentary "Bowling for Columbine" spends a good
deal of time wandering Detroit and his nearby hometown of Flint,
trying to fathom the national gun fetish. Though Moore's depiction of
the city isn't exactly flattering, his movies (including "Roger and
Me") have testified to Michiganders' resiliency and character. Yet
another Detroit-set movie, Joe Carnahan's well-made, morally murky
cop drama "Narc," starring Jason Patric and Ray Liotta, will open
soon.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, like many cities, Detroit sometimes fails to recognize its
native sons and daughters until they're halfway out the door. Sam
Raimi nurtured his peculiar talents in Detroit for years before
moving to Hollywood and directing this summer's No. 1 movie
"Spider-Man." Another metro Detroit transplant, Jeffrey Eugenides,
author of "The Virgin Suicides," which is set in Detroit, this year
impressed book critics even more with his second novel, "Middlesex."</TE>
<TE>   Their hometown's influence can still be felt in their work,
however, and many other Detroit artists either have stayed put or
moved back home after making their reputations elsewhere. As for the
omnipresent Marshall Mathers III -- love him, hate him or simply
ignore him -- he has dragged rap music kicking and screaming across
the borderline that separated boomers from the hip-hop generation.</TE>
<TE>   It would be dangerous to over-romanticize Detroit, one of the
poorest big cities in the country, which only recently landed its
first new movie theater to be built in decades. Years of white
flight, economic disinvestment and insensitive freeway building have
ravaged the city as surely as did the '67 riots, when tanks were
called in to calm the burning streets.</TE>
<TE>   Yet people in "the 313" (Detroit's area code) somehow keep
churning out popular culture that's as big and durable as a Ford
pickup. "I jokingly tell people there's something in our water," says
Chris Jaszczak, a Detroit native and downtown theater owner. That
brew isn't to everyone's taste, but it makes for a strong
constitution.</TE>

<LD>As a clinical psychologist, I was glad to read Stephen Farber's
commentary ("Psychology as a short subject," Dec. 8). I thought it
was just me. I figured it's only because of my profession that I look
for in-depth motivations of characters. I often walk out of
screenings asking, "But, why was he/she like that?" Then I tell
myself, "Oh, Carol, it's only because you're a psychologist that it
interests you." I'm afraid most people don't want to look beneath the
surface anymore; they just want to believe that "why" is some sort of
"chemical imbalance" and they can take a pill to cure all emotional
pain. Unfortunately for the Hollywood development people (who may be
on anti-depressants themselves), pill-taking offers little in the way
of dramatic possibilities. It's a major challenge to dramatize the
inner workings of the mind, but when the challenge is met
successfully, art that informs and transforms the human spirit can
result.</LD>
<LD>   Look at Sidney Lumet's "The Pawnbroker." The darkness of Rod
Steiger's racist Holocaust survivor was so shocking, and so
brilliantly illuminated by the film, that seeing this film most
likely changed the direction of my life. I knew I must study
psychology in college.</LD>
<LD>   I don't think movies should all be transformative. If only they'd
just try to make more sense of what it means to be human.</LD>

<LD>While a theater in Fiji shows movies for free ("Showing Free Movies
in Fiji: Is He an Ugly American?" Dec. 8), I had to pass on paying
$14 for "To End All Wars" at the ArcLight, Hollywood. After spending
the entire 2003 entertainment budget of my one-income household on
two tickets for Peter Gabriel's concert ($94.50), I couldn't justify
having to cheat on my taxes to be able to watch a movie about
humanity, dignity and forgiveness. Indeed, the path to salvation is
not easy -- nor cheap. Instead, I had to content myself with "Men in
Black II" on DVD ($2.70). With free movies and great sunsets, Fiji is
beginning to sound interesting. Now to get there ... is that the 110
to the 101 to the 405?</LD>

<LD>"Punch-Drunk Love" must be the most misunderstood movie since "2001."
Stephen Farber is the latest critical lightweight to lay into this
modest Paul Thomas Anderson masterpiece ("Psychology as a Short
Subject," Dec. 8). He finds Anderson's creation to be "intentionally
shallow," and "defiantly anti-psychological." He sucker-punches
Anderson with such pejoratives as "glib," "absurdist," "postmodern"
and, worst of all, "hip." He thinks that Anderson thinks that
"psychotherapy is a joke."</LD>
<LD>   I don't know about that, but I do suspect Anderson trusts us to
figure out what's behind Barry Egan's violent outbursts, since the
director's already made it crystal-clear. Farber asks, "What would
motivate her [Emily Watson] to pursue him so avidly?" Open your ears,
Stephen. "He needs me." It's all over the soundtrack! But to Farber,
mired in his beloved, naturalistic "psychological realism," all this
"punch-drunk love" can only be explained in terms of "perverse
tendencies."</LD>
<TE>   This is a simple love story, a kind of beautifully stylized,
modern fairy tale that hits every little grace note without any of
the ham-fisted, art school intrusiveness that made Wes Anderson's
"The Royal Tannenbaums" so precious and insufferable. This is
American filmmaking that can stand with the best of Malick and
Kubrick and any other world-class auteur. If guys like Farber weren't
so visually and aurally impaired, if they weren't weighted down with
Freudian mumbo-jumbo, if they could trust something that didn't
immediately click along the familiar, earnest tracks of the films
they grew up admiring, maybe they could see a film such as this for
what it is, a revolutionary romantic comedy like nothing we've seen
before.</TE>

<LD>Many thanks for giving us Baz Dreisinger's survey of L.A.'s hip-hop
radio ("A New York State of Mind," Dec. 8).</LD>
<LD>   Hip-hop fans should benefit from the commentary on our local
musical culture. I was terribly impressed that after having spent two
months in town, this populist postdoctoral fellow has really figured
out L.A.'s sound. Maybe it's the vantage point from Miracle Mile.</LD>
<LD>   At first blush, I thought an article consisting of a list of pop
culture references couldn't hold it together. However, the author's
New York-sized ego fills in the gaps nicely.</LD>

<LD>Los Angeles Philharmonic general manager Deborah Borda was being less
than completely honest when she told Mark Swed that senior discounts
will continue ("Sounds Good, Yet ... " Dec. 8). When I asked, I was
informed that such discounts will not be available on subscriptions,
as they have been.</LD>
<LD>   You may count me among those who are utterly alienated by the
Philharmonic's new pricing policies. I have been a subscriber and a
contributor for more than a decade. Now, I suddenly can afford only
the cheapest seats, at binocular distance, and for a lot fewer
concerts at that. As for the various "inaugural events," their
pricing clearly indicates the Phil can't be bothered with us ordinary
folks.</LD>
<LD>   I rather doubt that I will occupy a seat at Disney Hall next
season. Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and Mozart Orchestra
subscriptions are musically every bit as satisfying and will cause me
a lot less financial pain. Meanwhile, both organizations seem far
more appreciative of their supporters than is the Philharmonic.</LD>

<LD>Thank you for the interesting article on Peter Jackson and "The Lord
of the Rings" ("A Pair of Ring Masters," Dec. 8). However, Lady
Galadriel's ring, Nenya, was not made by Sauron. It, like the other
two rings of the Elves, was made by the Elven King Celebrimbor and
the master craftsmen of Eregion. If Sauron were to obtain the One
Ring, then those rings would be revealed to him, and all that were
wrought by the Elves using the rings ruined. The Nine Rings of men
were made by Sauron and given to men, whom he enthralled.</LD>

<HD>Designer adds a store to her clutch</HD>

Angeles to showcase her mix of fashion and fun.</DH>

<LD>British handbag designer Lulu Guinness is having the kind of euphoric
interlude that comes with being new to this sun- and star-filled
city. "I want to live here," she says in her high-pitched, high-class
English accent. "Everyone is so charming!" Wearing a vintage black
lace cocktail dress, she is standing near a shelf of satin shoes
while a party celebrating the opening of her first West Coast shop is
swirling around her. Her eponymous boutique, on West 3rd Street in
L.A., is a gem, with a black-and-white striped awning not unlike the
one found on Guinness' cottage-shaped purse.</LD>
<LD>   Lucky magazine hosted the soiree where guests -- including Sarah
Wynter, Shiva Rose and Tamara Beckwith -- sported the designer's
witty bags and shoes. The starlets pale in comparison with the
ultra-glamorous Guinness, who has parlayed her own brand of
pin-curled, red-lipsticked, movie-star looks into a line of bags so
refreshingly distinct that several have landed in the permanent
collection of London's Victoria &amp; Albert Museum.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps her best-known bag and one of those picked for museum
posterity is "the florist basket," a black satin bag topped with a
bouquet of red roses. She is also known for the delicately beaded fan
clutches that have been red-carpet hits with Elizabeth Hurley, Trudie
Styler and Rachel Griffiths. (A special fan purse, which can be dyed
to match any dress, will be available for Academy Award dressing
consideration.)</TE>
<TE>   For daytime, totes and pouches are emblazoned with jaunty
embroideries of stilettos, powder puffs, pearl necklaces and other
girl props, and sayings such as "You Can Never Have Too Many" and "Be
a Glamour Girl -- Put on Your Lipstick." Other designs, including an
evening purse shaped like a glittery fairy-tale castle or like a box
of chocolates, are collected by customers who come to personal
appearances insisting that the designer sign her creations.</TE>
<TE>   Guinness' purses (which range from $35 for a makeup roll to $995
for a fan bag) are sold in more than 800 stores in the U.S.,
including Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom, and the designer has shops in
London and New York, and plans to open one soon in Tokyo. . This
fall, she introduced a line of vintage-inspired footwear -- red
patent-leather Mary Janes, round-toed 1940s satin dance shoes and
1950s wedge-heeled espadrilles. She also designs umbrellas, socks and
travel accessories.</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of a banker, Guinness grew up in the countryside
outside London and in South Africa, where she studied graphic arts at
Capetown University. A self-described late bloomer, she didn't design
her first bag until 1989 at age 29, fashioning a briefcase with
see-through plastic panels to show off gadgets such as Sony Walkmans
and Filofaxes. "It was meant to make me my fortune," she says saucily
in her store the day after the party, where the floor is still sticky
from spilled vodka drinks. Today, she is dressed in a flower print
Marni dress and a cream crochet cardigan that belonged to her
"granny."</TE>
<TE>   When a trio of London stores -- Browns, Joseph and Liberty --
picked up the briefcases, Guinness found herself "bitten by the
fashion bug," she says. At first, like many designers, she tried to
be all things to all people. But gradually, she gained the confidence
to do her thing, creating ladylike bags in fuchsia and magenta suede.
"Nobody did color back then," she says, leaning forward to light a
cigarette.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, not only does every hot fashion house have a handbag
(Balenciaga, YSL, Celine), but there is also a crop of entrepreneurs
-- such as the exceedingly popular Kate Spade of New York; Jennifer
Tash and Trang Huynh of L.A.'s Isabella Fiore; and London's Anya
Hindmarch -- who have brought attention and a new sense of wit to
handbag design.</TE>
<TE>   As her business grew, Guinness incorporated her own old-style
glamour, developed during a lifetime of shopping the vintage clothing
stalls of Portobello Road, into her work. She used her graphic arts
background to create whimsical drawings inspired by vintage fashion
illustrations, which she collects. (The floor of her flagship store
in London, just off Sloane Square, is papered in covers from 1950s
French Vogue.) She even drew the self-portrait that will adorn the
bottles when she launches her lily-of-the-valley scent this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Though many people assume that Guinness is an heiress (which
trumps being an actress any day), she married into the family of
frothy stout fame. Her husband, Valentine, is the grandson of British
statesman Walter Edward Guinness -- Lord Moyne -- who was
assassinated in Cairo in 1944 by two members of the famous "Stern
Gang," a group that fought for Israeli statehood.</TE>
<TE>   She met Valentine, a playwright and rock musician, in 1980 when
she showed up at a recording studio with her friend to sing backup
for his glam rock band, Darling.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about her husband's family, she demurs, saying,
"There's a lot of Guinnesses and some of them are extremely rich. But
not all of them are."</TE>
<TE>   Married in 1987, the Guinnesses live in Notting Hill with
daughters Tara, 11, and Madeleine, 6. Resisting the urge to stay
through the weekend and explore the Rose Bowl flea market, she's
headed back to London in a few hours for Madeleine's school Nativity
play.</TE>
<TE>   But already she's dreaming of her next trip to L.A. "I would love
to live near the beach," she says. There's also Charleston, S.C.
She's had a lifelong fantasy of living in the American South. In
truth, it's all of the U.S. that she can't get enough of. "I always
enjoy myself here," Guinness says. "I like the feeling that
everything is possible."</TE>

<PH>Five Years of the Getty</PH>
<KH>Isolated? Elitist? L.A. makes the Getty its own in surprising
ways.</KH>
<HD>Seven million visits later ...</HD>
<DH>Five years in, the Getty Center is clearly a popular
destination. Is it the art or the view? Both. A look at the mark its
billion-dollar footprint has left on Los Angeles and the broader
world of art.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Suzanne Muchnic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five and a half years ago, when dust was still rising at the Getty
Center and all the world was speculating about what, exactly, the
$1.3-billion castle on a hill would be, the Getty's No. 1 art guy
made an astonishing statement. "We have gained respect for visitors
who don't come to a museum with the idea they are visiting a school
or library, but as if they are going to a park," said John Walsh, a
scholar of Dutch painting who directed the J. Paul Getty Museum from
1983 to 2000.</LD>
<LD>   As the opening drew closer, artist Robert Irwin expressed similar
thoughts about the 134,000-square-foot Central Garden he designed for
the Getty Center: "My hope is that people will recognize that this is
a sculptural environment, but that they'll also find it inviting
enough that they'll flop down on the grass because this is a garden
to be used."</LD>
<LD>   The Getty Center -- which houses the J. Paul Getty Trust's offices
and programs, including a museum, institutes for art conservation and
research and a grant program, on a 24-acre campus carved out of a
750-acre property in Brentwood -- will celebrate its fifth
anniversary on Monday. And if anything is clear at a glance, at least
on sunny weekends, it's that the Getty is used in exactly the ways
Walsh and Irwin envisioned. If you build it, they will come, look,
eat, walk and plop down.</LD>
<TE>   That wasn't obvious from the get-go. Even as the Getty Center
opened its doors to throngs of arts professionals and the public,
some observers complained that its lofty site in a ritzy neighborhood
exacerbated its elitist image. Commenting in a Christian Scientist
Monitor article published on opening day, author Mike Davis likened
the center to "a remote spaceship that dropped into the Santa Monica
mountains" and warned that "the locals are still waiting to see if
it's friendly."</TE>
<TE>   It seems that many have. On the day after Thanksgiving, one of the
busiest days of the year, more than 8,700 people visit the center.
Young couples who want to be alone hike up to the museum instead of
taking the tram. Families eat brown-bag lunches at outdoor tables or
treat themselves to salads, pizzas and sandwiches in the cafeteria.</TE>
<TE>   Local visitors make beelines to their favorite vantage spots and
point out distant sights to their guests from Cincinnati, Toronto and
Omaha. Little boys stick their fingers in fountains and waterways as
their parents herd them along. Children roll down the hill at the top
of the garden, squealing in delight.</TE>
<TE>   It's a scene of human dramas and life lessons. An elderly man,
walking with a cane and wheeling an oxygen tank, pauses to get his
bearings at a scale model of the center, displayed on the museum's
plaza, then soldiers on with his slightly younger mate. A young
father teaches his tiny daughter how to climb the stairs to the
temporary exhibitions gallery: "First one foot and then the other."</TE>
<TE>   On days like this it may appear that people go to the Getty to do
anything but look at art. But no, every gallery is crowded, and for
each person who strolls through, there's someone engaged with an
artwork.</TE>
<TE>   Some work on assignments. In a display of ancient Greek and Roman
sculpture, Montebello High School students fill out a questionnaire
on a marble statue of Marcus Aurelius, on loan from Berlin's Pergamon
Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Liz Cvitan, a student from Mount St. Mary's High School,
prepares a report on a Roman statue of Venus, but she often comes on
her own or with her mother, artist Kirsten Cvitan. "I used to go to
the old Getty Museum, but now that it's closed for renovation I come
here," Liz says. "It's a lot of fun to get to know the art."</TE>
<TE>   Upstairs, art education transpires more informally. A man sprawled
on a couch with his son gazes at Nicolas Poussin's 1651 painting
"Landscape With a Calm" and explains that the French artist was an
ace at differentiating clouds from mountains while using the same
blue-gray palette. In another gallery, a young man stares at "Bust of
a Noblewoman," a sculpture made by Guiliano Finelli in 1630, and asks
his date, "What makes her noble? Money?"</TE>
<TE>   The gallery that always draws the largest crowd displays the
museum's collection of French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist
pictures. Today is no different, but Dutch artist Gerrit von
Honthorst's 1622 painting "A Musical Group on a Balcony," installed
on the ceiling of a small passageway, is a bigger hit with kids.
Adults, who tend to look ahead, not up, usually miss it. But
youngsters spot the figures on the ceiling, proclaim the artwork
"cool" and walk in circles, heads thrown back.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter where you go, that guy in the red-feathered hat is
looking at you," Jason Matthews, 10, tells his friend.</TE>
<TE>   So it goes at the museum, where every information center is packed
with people looking up facts on computers or checking out exhibits on
techniques, media and styles. The same is true at the Family Room,
just outside the museum's East Pavilion, where kids color furiously
or dress up and have their pictures taken, a la Old Master paintings.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be a queen," one little girl informs her mother.</TE>
<TE>   It's all a bit much for some visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "Another friggin' line? I don't think so," grumbles a man who has
already waited to ride the tram and buy lunch, as he spots a queue
for an orientation film. But instead of going home to watch TV, he
lopes off to the galleries.</TE>
<TE>   Others find refuge at the Getty Research Institute, which stages
small shows from its vast collections in a circular building just
west of the museum. "Oh thank God, a nice empty place," says a woman,
peering into darkened galleries where a mere dozen people are looking
at "Landscapes of Myth" and its images of Greece. "It's a mob scene
out there," she whispers to the guard.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, attendance at the Getty Center dropped from 1.7 million
in 1997, the opening year, to 1.5 million in 1998, then to 1.3
million, where it seems to be holding fairly steady. The Los Angeles
County Museum of Art packed in 1.3 million people in 1998-99, when it
hosted a Van Gogh blockbuster, double its average annual attendance.</TE>
<TE>   "Before we opened, we anticipated that our maximum crowd would be
1.4 million," says Deborah Gribbon, director of the Getty Museum. "We
are operating very close to what we thought would be our capacity."</TE>
<TE>   More than 7 million people, including about 250,000 students on
school tours, have visited the Getty Center in the past five years.
Meanwhile, the median age of visitors has dropped from 50 to 45 and
the number of repeat visitors has risen from 24% to 34%, the Getty
has found in periodic surveys. Early on, about half the visitors came
from outside Los Angeles. That number has dropped to about 40%,
perhaps because travel has declined since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. Still, on any given day, first-timers can be seen poring
over maps of the site and gathering for docent tours.</TE>
<TE>   'Disneyland of the mind'</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the spectacle of holiday weekends, the Getty Center
attracts scholars, students, curators, artists and other arts
professionals to exhibitions, lectures, symposia, discussions,
concerts and meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a Disneyland of the mind," says Robbert Flick, a prominent
photographer who teaches at the University of Southern California.
The first thing he noticed, as a longtime observer of the city
through the lens of his camera, was that the Getty Center "provided a
view of Los Angeles that hadn't been there before. All of a sudden
Los Angeles could be contained as you scanned from Mt. Baldy to San
Nicholas Island."</TE>
<TE>   What keeps him coming back, with his wife, artist Susan Rankaitis,
are photography and drawing exhibitions at the museum and a range of
programs presented by the Getty Research Institute.</TE>
<TE>   For Rankaitis, participating in the museum's Point-of-View series
of gallery talks by artists was "one of the most professionally
rewarding things I have done," she says. Her subject: French
photographer Gustave le Gray. "I love his work and the depth of the
Getty's collection is unbelievable. I went to the show nine or 10
times before I gave my talks. The whole thing made me feel so
connected to the museum."</TE>
<TE>   Making connections with everyone from individual artists and
scholars to families and school groups is a major goal for the Getty.
While some observers praise the hilltop complex as a monument to high
culture in a city that desperately needs one, others condemn it as
physically and psychologically removed from the city.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people would have loved to see the Getty Center in
another place," says philanthropist Eli Broad. "But overall, the
Getty is a great asset. It has helped us with cultural tourism and it
has made the city more of an international cultural center."</TE>
<TE>   "The Getty has been perceived as isolated," Gribbon says, "and we
have taken very deliberate steps to go out into the community and
bring people here. Not just visitors, but people who feel they have a
stake in the Getty one way or another. We like to be a gathering
place, but I don't think we had anticipated the degree to which this
has happened."</TE>
<TE>   The special exhibition program, for example, has come as something
of a surprise to the art community, partly because the original Getty
Museum in Pacific Palisades didn't have space for temporary shows.
The Getty Center shows feature esoteric topics and relatively obscure
artists, but they have proven popular with critics and the public
alike. The top draws so far, each attracting more than 165,000, are
"Painting on Light: Drawings and Stained Glass in the Age of Durer
and Holbein" and "Devices of Wonder: From the World in a Box to
Images on a Screen."</TE>
<TE>   Opening receptions for the exhibitions draw hundreds of people,
some of whom seem to be as interested in each other as the art on
display. That doesn't bother Gribbon, who likes the idea that the
Getty is a magnet for those with different agendas. Los Angeles can
foster isolation, she says, so "some people come here for the kinds
of things other cities offer more naturally -- to sit down and meet a
friend or read a book."</TE>
<TE>   The situation isn't quite that casual at the Research Institute,
which hosts 25 to 30 scholars each year, but it has become far more
democratic recently."We are trying to change the landscape of visual
art studies and make it publicly approachable," says director Thomas
Crow, who has placed a greater emphasis on contemporary and modern
art since he took charge two years ago. In the institute's elite
early days, scholars had to be invited; now they are chosen from an
open application system, with a few invitations going to people who
need them to be granted leave.</TE>
<TE>   Today, says Crow, "We like to include younger people and those who
are doing hard work in the trenches, carrying heavy teaching loads."</TE>
<TE>   Criticism seems to be waning</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is thrilled with the Getty Center. It's hard to get
there during rush hour, parking is a pain, taking the tram is slow,
the museum's traffic patterns are confusing, and you still have to
get reservations on weekdays. But few people in the art world voice
their complaints publicly -- if only because so many of them are
involved in some way, or want to be.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Getty bashing seems to be on the wane.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't hear the same kind of 'why don't they do this?' and 'why
don't they do that?' now that they have matured and clarified what
they do and -- just as important -- don't do," says Earl A. Powell,
director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and
former director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The Getty
has become more collaborative, he adds. "They determine how they
cannot just give away money but involve themselves in the process of
improving the endeavors they get themselves into."</TE>
<TE>   All things considered, the new arts complex has turned out to be
"a tremendous resource for the city," says Victoria Steele, head of
special collections at the Young Research Library at UCLA. She notes
that Getty staff conserved the Gospels of Gladzor, a 14th century
manuscript in UCLA's collection regarded as a cornerstone of Armenian
art history, organized an exhibition about it and published a book,
making sure the local Armenian community was involved with the
project.</TE>
<TE>   The Getty has "permeated people's images of the city" and
"enriched creative imaginations," she says.</TE>
<TE>   How so?</TE>
<TE>   Look at Yxta Maya Murray's latest book, Steele says. In her new
novel, "The Conquest," the protagonist is a Getty restorer of rare
books and manuscripts whose work takes her on an adventure into 16th
century scandals.</TE>
<TE>   "The Getty is a temple to the magnificence of European culture,"
says the author, who is also a professor of law at Loyola Law School.
"As a Latina, I have a sort of rapturous, cognitive dissonance when I
enter this supreme church built by Mr. Getty's money. There are
incredible paintings and sculptures of goddesses and you know the
models were poor prostitutes. These eternal works of art are also
historical propaganda used to justify the expansion of Europe into
the Americas.</TE>
<TE>   "I could lounge on the decorative arts floor for the rest of my
life," Murray says, "but at the same time my little superego is
chattering away as I walk through the halls. For any person of a
racial minority, to pierce the veil of the Getty temple is a
mind-blowing experience of assimilation. So for me, the Getty is just
ripe for a novelist's imagination."</TE>
<TE>   And perhaps for the city's, as well.</TE>

<DH>Gael Garcia Bernal pursues a new style of filmmaking,
stardom -- and a role as Che Guevara.</DH>

<LD>"Bienvenida al [fin] del mundo," he blurted into the phone. (Loosely
translated: Welcome to the rump of the earth). After flying for 13
hours, not sleeping in 24 and only vaguely remembering when I had my
last meal, I agreed with him that I had indeed, landed at the end of
the earth -- Chile, to be exact, on the southernmost edge of South
America.</LD>
<LD>   I did it all for him -- Gael Garcia Bernal, 23 and already the
star of some of Mexico's most celebrated films. Beginning two years
ago with "Amores Perros," last year's "Y Tu Mama Tambien" and this
year's "El Crimen del Padre Amaro," he has come to represent Latin
America's new breed of filmmaking -- daring, visceral, subtly
political.</LD>
<LD>   It was his debut as the working-class street thug in Alejandro
Gonzalez Inarritu's Oscar-nominated "Amores Perros" that first
grabbed Hollywood's attention. Like a Mexican Marlon Brando, Garcia
Bernal transmits vulnerability beneath a bad-boy sexuality.</LD>
<TE>   As director Gonzalez Inarritu sees him: "There is this internal
complexity that he reflects in his eyes. He reminds me very much of
River Phoenix; he has the same tenderness but also this sense of
being on the edge. He has an ambivalence that is very interesting and
that the camera loves.... He is a cinematic animal -- a type of
animal that is almost extinct."</TE>
<TE>   But his path to stardom has been unusual, considering that his
feature films have been small and -- outside Mexico -- foreign. If
his luck holds, and he continues to land the right roles, he could be
on his way to becoming a new breed of international movie actor. His
current project, "The Motorcycle Diaries," for example, is
British-financed, directed by a Brazilian, about an Argentine
revolutionary, starring a Mexican, with dialogue in Spanish and
developed by an American company.</TE>
<TE>   Given all this, I set out to interview Garcia Bernal in Chile on
the location of "The Motorcycle Diaries." Based on Ernesto (Che)
Guevara's personal record of his pilgrimage across South America, the
film chronicles the seven-month journey in 1951-52 with his friend
Alberto Granado that marked a turning point in young Guevara's life
-- a trip that would eventually transform Guevara from optimistic
doctor-in-training into a stern Marxist insurgent.</TE>
<TE>   I had been told that I would catch up with Garcia Bernal in the
midsection of Chile, in a coastal industrial city called Valparaiso.
Chile is as long as the United States is wide; bordered by the
imposing Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west, it
boasts one of the world's most diverse geographies, from scorched
deserts to ski resorts.</TE>
<TE>   But visiting a movie set is rarely as glamorous as it might seem.
Usually, it is an exercise in frustration. Reporters are at the whim
of temperamental stars or directors, held hostage by jittery
publicists eager to keep prying eyes from the realities of the set.</TE>
<TE>   I had been invited by Garcia Bernal's representatives, but the
company that financed the movie, Film4, had closed the set to all
journalists. By the time this became clear, I was lost in Chile
searching for Gael, following Ernesto Guevara's trail.</TE>
<TE>   On the trail</TE>
<TE>   After a two-hour drive from the Santiago airport, passing through
valleys lined with vineyards bathed in early morning fog, I arrived
in Valparaiso, just north of Santiago. The cabdriver searched for an
hour but could not find my hotel. So he dropped me off in the heart
of the city, where I could make inquiries.</TE>
<TE>   Valparaiso was once a thriving port town until the Panama Canal
cut off its business in the early 20th century. Described by locals
as San Francisco without the gold, Valparaiso's downtown is grimy,
with packs of street dogs scavenging for food and a place to sleep.
The nicer part of the city was above, on hillsides that overlook the
Pacific, dotted with brightly colored houses and lined with
meandering stone paths. I wandered the narrow concrete streets,
dragging luggage and my computer, as buses belched black smoke around
me. I found a telephone and reached the film production scheduler
based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I had been sent to the wrong city.
The hotel was in Temuco, a city about 500 kilometers -- or an
eight-hour drive -- from Valparaiso.</TE>
<TE>   The production was running a week behind schedule and would arrive
in Valparaiso next week. Panicked, I checked into a hotel and made
more phone calls. Around 7 p.m., I found a note slipped under my
hotel room door from a "Micky."</TE>
<TE>   I called the number and asked for Micky in Spanish. I was greeted
with "Hello" in English and the male voice correcting me: "This is
Michael." It was Michael Nozik, a producer on the film, overseeing
the project for South Fork Pictures, part of Robert Redford's
production company.</TE>
<TE>   He reassured me I would meet with Gael, but I had to fly to
Temuco.</TE>
<TE>   So I booked a flight for myself and a photographer. The closest
photographer available happened to be in Argentina, so he immediately
set out on a seven-hour bus trip across the Andes to meet me.</TE>
<TE>   Next I haggled with Nozik and his assistant over the exact date of
my interview -- Garcia Bernal, whom I had met briefly twice before,
wanted to change it; I insisted on the agreed-upon date.</TE>
<TE>   At 11 p.m. the night of my arrival in Chile, Garcia Bernal called:
"Hey, you! What's going on? How are you? Hey, I'm really sorry it was
such a long trip but I am so glad you're here. Thanks so much for
coming. We're going to have fun!"</TE>
<TE>   Causes for the taking</TE>
<TE>   The photographer and I arrived Sunday morning in Temuco, a city
once considered the last frontier in Chile for 16th century Spanish
conquerors.</TE>
<TE>   The Spaniards were beaten back by the Mapuche Indians, known for
their fierceness in battle. Temuco is deceptively peaceful. It rests
on a verdant valley rimmed by volcanoes, crystal-clear lakes and
mineral hot springs, and the air is crisp and clean with fluffy rain
clouds drifting above.</TE>
<TE>   But the other side to Temuco is spelled out on the city's streets
and in newspapers. As we drove into town, I noticed the graffiti:
"Free the Mapuche Nation."</TE>
<TE>   The Mapuches, like Indians from Mexico, Peru and Central America,
are rising up to demand their land back. The papers told the story of
the latest flare-up: The week the production was filming in Temuco,
Mapuches rioted, protesting the killing of a 17-year-old boy by
police. They carried the dead boy's casket to the governor's palace.
They closed down highways.</TE>
<TE>   When Guevara and Granado rode through this region more than 50
years ago, they were given shelter by the Indians. Guevara wrote
somewhat sarcastically in his diary, "we were like demigods, from
Argentina no less, that wonderful country where [Col. Juan] Peron and
his wife Evita lived, where the poor have as much as the rich and the
Indian isn't exploited or treated callously as he is in this
country."</TE>
<TE>   In Chile at the time of Guevara's journey, the standard of living
was lower than in Argentina, unemployment was high, and many Chileans
emigrated to Argentina "searching for the proverbial streets paved
with gold... ," Guevara wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Flash forward to 2002: The week I was in Chile, the newspapers
reported six Argentine children had died of starvation. Argentina's
economy is in shambles. Peru's Marxist rebels continue to hide out in
the jungle, Brazilian street children are shot by police for
loitering, Venezuela is in revolt, and Colombia's government is under
fire from leftist rebels, rightist militias and drug lords.</TE>
<TE>   A young revolutionary like Che would find no shortage of causes.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's hardships and the Mapuche uprisings, I later find out,
have had an impact on Garcia Bernal, whom I finally saw Sunday
afternoon. He greeted me with a kiss and a large, black pebble from
the Mapuche land as a keepsake. Several Mapuches were cast as extras
in the film.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Salles, director of "The Motorcycle Diaries," later told me
Garcia Bernal has a sponge-like ability to soak up his surroundings.
Some of this he has learned as an actor. Most of it flows from his
sensitivity and natural curiosity. He started acting as a 1-year-old,
and spent most of his teen years starring in soap operas. But just as
he became a soap heartthrob, at age 19 he left Mexico's television
world to study acting at the Central School of Speech and Drama in
London.</TE>
<TE>   "His capacity to adapt and to mold himself to situations is
extraordinary," Salles said. "And that is a great gift to the
director."</TE>
<TE>   For "The Motorcycle Diaries," Garcia Bernal has immersed himself
in history, literature and politics. For the past three months, he
has been reading Albert Camus, Karl Marx, Chilean poet Pablo Neruda
and biographies of Guevara. He has learned to play rugby and ride a
motorcycle (so well he no longer uses a stunt double). By the end of
the shoot, which is expected to go through the end of January when
they reach the Peruvian Amazon, Garcia Bernal must lose as much as 15
pounds on his already slight frame. He wants to look as emaciated and
run-down as the asthma-ridden Guevara did at the end of his journey.</TE>
<TE>   On the afternoon I met with him, a pungent smell permeated his
brown suede and wool jacket: dank, moldy and sweaty. Wearing brown
jeans, boots, a torn olive-colored T-shirt on top of an orange
long-sleeve jersey (an outfit he wore two days in a row), his black
hair was impossibly full with bed-head. They had been shooting nights
and he wore sleep on his face.</TE>
<TE>   Taken separately, his features are not conventionally beautiful --
he has a distinctive, crooked nose, with a slight scar rounding the
bridge. When his wide lips part, large incisor teeth flare out. He is
smallish, 5 feet 7 with narrow shoulders and hips. His brown-sugar
complexion is offset by light green eyes flecked with gold.</TE>
<TE>   His beauty lies in those eyes. They emit a tremendous sadness and,
alternately, a childlike glee.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike with many Hollywood stars, you get the sense that he is
humbled by his success. He is embarrassed by his popularity. He says
he pursued a career in acting to have fun. And "The Motorcycle
Diaries" begins in mischief. It is essentially a road movie about two
young guys on an adventure who accidentally end up on a journey of
self-discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia Bernal loves mischief. He greets every female fan -- some
have driven miles to see him -- with a kiss on the cheek and happily
poses for pictures with them. In Chile, there are no handlers holding
back the fans and no paparazzi shooting his indiscretions. He reads
each of the dozens of love notes that are left under his door when he
comes back to his room. He gratefully accepts, as a parting gift, an
opened bottle of wine that two girls have been slurping while waiting
for him. When I asked him if he was afraid of the piranhas he might
encounter in the Amazon (for an upcoming scene), he smiled and said,
"Nah, I love to get bitten by little piranhas."</TE>
<TE>   One moment, he plays the naughty schoolboy; the next he is as
intense as a philosophy student.</TE>
<TE>   Right now he is tired. He has been filming and promoting movies
nonstop for three years.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like a pingpong," he says over dinner. "I need to recharge
my batteries."</TE>
<TE>   He was raised in nonconformist ways by somewhat bohemian, leftist
parents who worked in theater. His mother, Patricia Bernal, is an
actress and former model. His father, Jose Angel Garcia, is a
director. Although he does not like to talk about it, his parents
divorced when Garcia Bernal was in elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   Along with his mother, Garcia Bernal and his two siblings
constantly moved from one Mexico City neighborhood to another. He was
surrounded by artists and leftists.</TE>
<TE>   But like most children, he longed for a normal, middle-class life.
"You live in a society that pushes you into that," he said. "I would
have died to have a normal life -- which meant going to church on
Sundays and joining a country club. Now I am so grateful I was not
raised like that."</TE>
<TE>   He was only 9 at the time, but he says he vividly remembers
Mexico's 1988 presidential election -- marred by allegations of fraud
-- when leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas lost out to Institutional
Revolutionary Party candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari. At 16,
Garcia Bernal met Mexico's pipe-smoking, masked renegade,
Subcommander Marcos.</TE>
<TE>   Although Garcia Bernal is turned on by politics, he is
uncomfortable with overtly political movies. He was disappointed with
"El Crimen del Padre Amaro," which happens to be playing in Temuco's
only movie theater during our visit. The film, which is the
highest-grossing Mexican movie ever in its home country, raised the
ire of conservative Catholics and endured calls for boycotts and
protests. It is Mexico's official entry for the 75th Academy Awards'
foreign-language film category. In the United States, the film has
done well, grossing $3.1 million in limited release. But Garcia
Bernal says he disliked the movie's lack of ambivalence and subtlety.
(Garcia Bernal is in negotiations to star next in Pedro Almodovar's
"La Mala Educacion" [A Bad Education]. Inspired by Almodovar's
Catholic schoolboy days, the director promises it will be hard on the
church.)</TE>
<TE>   Director Salles says he is determined not to make "The Motorcycle
Diaries" overtly political. Just as he illustrated Brazil's desperate
poverty and ruthless treatment of children in "Central Station"
through the story of a young boy and an older woman, he says "The
Motorcycle Diaries" will depict Ernesto Guevara's journey to becoming
"Che" Guevara, the gun-toting revolutionary.</TE>
<TE>   It will be one of two Guevara movies in the works. The other, to
be produced by Steven Soderbergh and Laura Bickford, will star
Benicio Del Toro as Guevara in the latter part of his life.</TE>
<TE>   Although this will be Garcia Bernal's second time playing Guevara
(the first, which he says he would rather forget, was in the HBO
biopic "Fidel"), he knows a lot is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a certain amount of insecurity about it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a lot of responsibility. I want to do it well because of
what he represents to the world. He is a romantic. He had a political
consciousness that changed Latin America."</TE>
<TE>   The shadow of Guevara, the patron saint of revolution, still looms
over Latin America. To many young people, his image represents
bravery, rebellion, freedom, justice. But it is hard to know where
the real Guevara ends and the myth begins. The book "The Motorcycle
Diaries" is a bit anticlimactic, promising but not delivering
epiphanies.</TE>
<TE>   Journalist Alma Guillermoprieto describes him in her collection of
essays as a "harsh angel" incapable of living with peace, constantly
in search of revolution:</TE>
<TE>   "So many incinerated lives: the would-be guerrillas who starved to
death in northern Argentina, the young men drowned in vats of
excrement in Brazil, the eviscerated martyrs of Guatemala, the
sociology student in Argentina whose severed hands were delivered in
a jar to her mother -- the children of Che."</TE>
<TE>   But Garcia Bernal takes a magnanimous view of those he portrays,
and seems unfazed by Guevara's more ruthless side. He's a softy for
his characters, whether he is playing Guevara, the nasty street kid
in "Amores Perros," the horny teen in "Y Tu Mama Tambien" or the
ambitious, amoral priest in "El Crimen del Padre Amaro."</TE>
<TE>   He views them all with compassion and recognition of himself. What
unites them -- and what attracts Garcia Bernal -- is their evolution
as people.</TE>
<TE>   "They are all searching for an identity," he said. "Film does that
to you, it makes you root for the bad guy."</TE>
<TE>   He is not afraid to show weakness and vulnerability, said Alfonso
Cuaron, who directed him in "Y Tu Mama Tambien."</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of actors of his generation are tied to this image
of what a man should be: A man needs to be cool, tough, rough and
they must repress certain emotions," said Cuaron. "He does not do
that. He has this docile intensity."</TE>
<TE>   In the final scene for "Amores Perros," Garcia Bernal is waiting
for his girlfriend at a bus stop. But she never shows up. He must
decide to stay and find her or run away from his street life.</TE>
<TE>   It is a heartbreaking scene in which his physicality says it all:
His puffy eyes are moist with tears, his head shaved, face bruised.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez Inarritu said he wanted to surprise Garcia Bernal and
brought his father on to play the driver of the bus. But he had no
idea the depth of feelings it would evoke.</TE>
<TE>   As they began the scene, the driver turned to Garcia Bernal and
said, "So, young man, are you coming or not?" When Garcia Bernal
looked up and saw his father, whom he had not seen in months, he
crumbled.</TE>
<TE>   "He just stopped and hugged him for a really long time," the
director told me by phone. "He started to cry like a little boy. It
was very emotional."</TE>
<TE>   An emotional journey</TE>
<TE>   If riding across South America was Ernesto Guevara's passage into
manhood, making "The Motorcycle Diaries" has become an emotional and
psychological journey for Garcia Bernal.</TE>
<TE>   His life has changed so dramatically that he longs for more
mundane activities.</TE>
<TE>   "I miss playing soccer with Diego," he said, referring to his
childhood friend Diego Luna, his co-star in "Y Tu Mama Tambien".</TE>
<TE>   "I want more time to absorb my surroundings and contemplate. I
miss that urge to want to live in other parts of the world. I miss
the fruit and the fruit waters of Mexico.... I want to fall in love."</TE>
<TE>   His home is a four-story walk-up in the historic district of
downtown Mexico City, but he is rarely there. Though he has plenty of
women around, he says he wants a meaningful relationship. About
acting, he readily acknowledges he is still very green and has "a lot
to learn."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia Bernal's career has taken off in part because of timing.
Not only is Latin America blossoming with interesting movie projects,
but the United States is more keen on tapping talent from abroad.</TE>
<TE>   With "Amores Perros" and "Y Tu Mama Tambien" leading the way,
filmmakers across Latin America have churned out their own box-office
hits in the past two years. This past year, nearly every country in
Latin America had at least one film that outperformed a Hollywood
movie at the home country's box office. Countries like Argentina,
Chile, Peru and Uruguay produced native movies that broke records.</TE>
<TE>   As I leave Chile, I notice the papers are tracing Garcia Bernal's
every move. He is widely recognized even in little cities like
Temuco. Guevara's picture is often printed alongside his. It is hard
to imagine such photos dominating the entertainment pages of Chilean
newspapers only a decade ago. Under Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Guevara
was a hero worshiped in secret.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a communist, and Pinochet was not very fond of
communists," our Temuco cabdriver, Don Eduardo, commented wryly on
the way to the airport. But Chile today has a socialist president and
the defense minister is a woman once tortured by Pinochet's security
police and whose father was killed by them.</TE>
<TE>   His role as Guevara is full of symbolism; the Argentine guerrilla
who became a Latin American revolutionary will be portrayed by a
Mexican actor on his way to becoming a Latin American cultural
touchstone.</TE>
<TE>   I had set out on my own South American odyssey in pursuit of a
movie star. I ended up finding something else.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Amores Perros' and 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' changed what it meant to
be Latin American. Magical Realism was dead," Chilean screenwriter
and novelist Alberto Fuguet explained over lunch. "We recognize
ourselves in Gael. He carries around a Walkman and at the same time
wears an Indian wool hat. He has become a large part of a cultural
awakening."</TE>

<HD>The record of a mystical connection</HD>
<DH>Director Lynne Ramsay was so mesmerized by Samantha
Morton's portrayal in 'Morvern Callar' that, sometimes, she couldn't

<DL></DL>
<LD>As with an electron whose exact speed and location can never be
determined at the same time, it is difficult to explain "Morvern
Callar" in a way that does justice to the what-happens-next elements
of its story and the feeling, the sensation, of watching it. The
latest from acclaimed British director Lynne Ramsay, the film is a
revolutionary head trip charged with energy and spirit that
solidifies her position as one of the most interesting filmmakers at
work in the world today.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Glasgow, Scotland, the 32-year-old Ramsay began her
career as a still photographer before moving to London to study
cinematography. There she would make a series of prizewinning shorts
before going on to write and direct her feature debut in 1999 with
"Ratcatcher." An evocative study of children struggling amid the
bleakness of Glasgow's tenement housing touched by a surrealist eye
and a tender heart, the film would garner Ramsay more awards and
positive critical notices around the globe.</LD>
<TE>   "Morvern Callar," which opens Friday, is adapted by Ramsay and
Liana Dognini from the novel by Alan Warner. Its enigmatic title
comes from the name of its lead character, a twentysomething grocery
store employee in the Scottish hinterlands. As the film opens, she
has come home one evening to find her boyfriend dead by his own hand,
splayed across their living room floor near neatly wrapped Christmas
presents and a series of instructions he left blinking on his
computer screen. This sets her off on a journey of equal parts
self-discovery and self-destruction that finds her trekking to the
Spanish desert and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Anchored by the lead performance of Samantha Morton (best known
for her Academy Award-nominated turn in "Sweet and Lowdown" and her
appearance in last summer's "Minority Report"), Ramsay's film is able
to go for long stretches with little to no dialogue, giving it a
pulsing, hypnotic feel. Perhaps not since the mid-'60s work of
Jean-Luc Godard and Anna Karina has a bond between director and
performer been so palpable on screen. "She's so mesmerizing to
watch," Ramsay says. "Like she's in some kind of trance. Sometimes in
the beginning I didn't know when to say 'cut.' She just understood
Morvern so deeply, it wasn't about motivation or back story, it was
about right now."</TE>
<TE>   The novel is told through Morvern's first-person narration, a
running monologue that nevertheless provides little insight into her
thought processes and interior life. Decisions are never made, they
simply occur, and Morvern -- inscrutable, somewhat scary and
seemingly capable of anything -- remains a magnetic enigma
throughout. Ramsay decided early on not to replicate the book's
narration with voice-over, so that often the viewer is simply
watching Morvern think, trying to guess what might come next.</TE>
<TE>   "I liked that she's such an ambiguous character," Ramsay says,
"and if I lost that edge, I'd lose what was interesting. It can be
frustrating for some people, but what was good about the character in
the first place would be destroyed by explaining her too much. Even
in her internal world she's still a mystery. It reminded me of a
western when the cowboy rides off in the end and you still don't know
what the deep root of his problem is."</TE>
<TE>   Though Ramsay has a key group of core collaborators she has worked
with from her very first short films, including cinematographer Alwin
Kuchler, editor Lucia Zucchetti, production designer Jane Morton and
sound designer Paul Davies, she strives to keep things fresh and to
remain challenged with each new project. For "Morvern Callar" she
co-wrote the script with Dognini, a friend from film school who is
primarily an animator, while also using an actor as casting director
(he makes an appearance as the dead boyfriend) and a fine artist as
her music supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   By using crew members, mostly friends, who are somewhat out of
their element, as well as casting nonprofessional actors for a
handful of key roles (Morvern's best friend and traveling companion
is played by Kathleen McDermott, a Glasgow barber's assistant),
Ramsay hoped to constantly surprise everyone involved, including
herself.</TE>
<TE>   "The film is a trip, like a psychological road movie," she says,
"and I wanted to go there too. I want to be transported. I like when
I see films myself and I don't know exactly what's going to happen. I
wanted it to be a challenge to myself, because I didn't want to make
the same film twice. I was a bit sick of the social realism of
'Ratcatcher.' I grew up there, I come from there. This may be a
departure, but I feel every film should be."</TE>
<TE>   'A symbiotic thing'</TE>
<TE>   If Morton was ever unsure of where to take a scene, she didn't
have to look far for an answer. As Ramsay recalls, "She said I was
the only director she's worked with who acted it all out off camera.
I'd get so into it, I wasn't even totally aware I was doing it. It
was like a symbiotic thing."</TE>
<TE>   Comparing working with Ramsay to her experiences with other
directors, the 25-year-old Morton says, "It's the first time I've
been directed by anyone in my age group. A lot of the formalities
weren't there. It felt much more human. The person talking is talking
to you, not at you. A lot of people see actors as fodder, or a bit
thick. You get people to drive you around, oh, we'll make that call
for you -- there was none of that. We were all equal and that was
really, really refreshing."</TE>
<TE>   Morvern moves through a world of parties, music, drinking and
drugs, and Ramsay isn't shy about picking up the film's inherent
generational subtext. "You look at the world and you portray what you
see," she says. "And I think my generation has been given a culture
that's quite hedonistic and very cynical. People are looking for
something more, but they don't know exactly what that is. So people
are drifting, they don't know what it's all about anymore, and I
think that's happening all over the world. You do think of those
things when you make a film, what you're trying to say and to whom."</TE>
<TE>   Even if "Morvern Callar" doesn't broaden her audience, her next
project, an adaptation of Alice Sebold's best-selling novel "The
Lovely Bones," almost certainly will.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to shoot in America with her usual team of collaborators,
Ramsay is understandably hesitant to discuss how she plans to bring
the story of a young girl's vision of the afterlife to the screen.
Working again with co-writer Dognini, and having already completed a
second draft, she will only allow that "we're taking a definite
approach, sort of a darker version of 'It's a Wonderful Life.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ramsay and Morton regard "Morvern Callar" as a triumph not only
for themselves as individuals but also for their collaboration on the
character of Morvern Callar. Describing the bond they felt regarding
Morvern, Morton simply says, "I found her completely contagious. It
was just an immediate emotional connection. We both understood this
woman. Sometimes Lynne would just say, 'Morvern. Be Morvern.' "</TE>

<HD>The family business</HD>
<DH>Siblings Lynn, Vanessa and Corin Redgrave will reaffirm
their status as one of the great acting families in New York this
season. But don't call them a dynasty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick Pacheco</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>New York</DL>
<LD>Stored in the archives of London's Victoria &amp; Albert Museum are boxes
marked "Redgrave" that contain memorabilia of a family of actors that
stretches as far back as the 18th century. Among the ephemera are
books, portraits, letters and programs associated with, among others,
Roy Redgrave, the self-styled "Dramatic Cock o' the North," who
played London's Sadler's Wells in 1902 and later became a silent-film
star. His son, Michael, followed in the family profession, scoring
triumph after triumph on the London stage, in 1935 co-starring in a
production of "Flowers of the Forest" opposite Rachel Kempson, whom
he later married.</LD>
<LD>   In the years to come, the couple's progeny, Vanessa, Corin and
Lynn, would collect their own voluminous theatrical clippings, as
would their grandchildren, most notably Natasha Richardson and her
sister Joely. All of which might lead one to think of the Redgraves
as one of the preeminent theatrical dynasties of our time.</LD>
<LD>   One would be wrong, according to Vanessa Redgrave.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not a dynasty!" says the actress, mother of Natasha and
Joely. "We're a family of professional actors. That's not a dynasty!
I'm so sick of hearing this word; it's used so loosely, and it is so
completely inappropriate. We have no power. We just have the power
that's in ourselves to try to do the work as well as we can."</TE>
<TE>   The opportunity to look anew at that power and the Redgraves'
particular contribution to theater is sparked by the fact that
Vanessa, Corin and Lynn each will be starring in separate projects on
the New York stage this season. First up is 63-year-old Corin,
playing the notorious Benedict Arnold in the new Richard Nelson drama
"The General From America," off-Broadway through the 22nd of this
month.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Lynn, 59, will perform in her own off-Broadway play,
"The Mandrake Root" -- inspired by her mother, Lady Rachel Kempson --
in which the arrival of a dyspeptic 80-year-old actress on her
daughter's doorstep spurs an attempt to reclaim the damaging past.</TE>
<TE>   And later in spring, Vanessa, 65, takes on the role of drug-addled
Mary Tyrone in a revival of Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into
Night," with Brian Dennehy, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robert Sean
Leonard.</TE>
<TE>   The Redgrave family first burst into the American consciousness
through film, not stage. Michael Redgrave -- long established in
Britain as a commanding classical stage actor, the equal of Olivier
and Gielgud who, like them, would later be knighted -- became known
to U.S. audiences as the star of such films as Alfred Hitchcock's
"The Lady Vanishes" (1939) and "Mourning Becomes Electra" (1947), for
which he received an Oscar nomination. His daughters, Vanessa and
Lynn, became international film stars in 1966, nominated for Oscars
for, respectively, "Morgan" and "Georgy Girl" -- Vanessa as a cool,
sexy beauty, Lynn as an ugly duckling. Even Corin was a film presence
that year, in a brief role as a hothead in "A Man for All Seasons."</TE>
<TE>   But it is on the stage that the Redgraves have wielded a creative
power as commanding as any Plantagenet or Windsor. No one family
since the Barrymores has earned more collective critical acclaim and
honors or, for that matter, generated more grist for tabloid
headlines. But through all the controversies, what has remained
constant is a fierce devotion to the profession that Corin, the
middle child, likened to a vocation. In organizing the Redgrave
memorabilia with his sisters for a planned exhibition next year at
the Theatre Museum in London, Corin said, "I was struck by how brave
and committed to their calling they were."</TE>
<TE>   Jobs that keep them on the go</TE>
<TE>   Speaking by phone with the actors about how the blood ties of the
past reverberate in their lives and work revealed just how
peripatetic -- and busy -- this generation of Redgraves is. Lynn, who
lives in Connecticut, was reached in Australia, where she was filming
"Peter Pan," playing a flamboyant aunt in the Darling family. It's
the fourth in a line of just-completed movies, which include the
David Cronenberg film "Spider," starring Ralph Fiennes, Miranda
Richardson (no relation) and Gabriel Byrne.</TE>
<TE>   Corin, who lives in London with his wife, actress Kika Markham,
spoke from New York, where he had begun performances of "The General
From America." And Vanessa was on the fly, moving between London and
Copenhagen, where she was involved in aiding human rights
organizations in the case of Chechen political prisoner Ahmed
Zakayev.</TE>
<TE>   "When we were children, because we're an acting family and my
parents were often heading off for a tour or to make a film, there
were a lot of goodbyes and a lot of welcome-homes," Lynn recalls. "We
would hug and kiss even if we were just going to shop."</TE>
<TE>   Those abandonment fears, which fell particularly hard on Lynn as
the youngest, are one of the themes of "Mandrake Root," her second
play to deal with family issues. The first, "Shakespeare for My
Father," more directly addressed her relationship with her remote but
exacting father.</TE>
<TE>   In "Mandrake Root," named after a powerful aphrodisiac with
mystical properties, the father figure is Robert, a distinguished
actor whose homosexuality causes his actress-wife, Rose, to take up
with a lover.</TE>
<TE>   Though there are autobiographical elements (Michael had male
lovers, famously Noel Coward), Lynn cautions that anyone looking for
more than glancing similarities would come up empty-handed. "It would
be going down the wrong garden path," she says. "Robert is definitely
not my father, and Sally [his daughter] is definitely not me."</TE>
<TE>   But there appear to be more similarities between Rose and Rachel
Kempson. Speaking of her mother, now 92, Lynn quotes actress
Constance Cummings, who once said of Rachel, "She is like a beautiful
swan, gliding gracefully through adversity." And Rose is a
fascinating and complex character: a sexually charged romantic grown
angry, forlorn and confused with age but still a force of nature.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fictionalized account, but Lynn is playing her mother, at
ages 20, 40, 60 and 80, and she is incandescent," says Susan Dietz,
one of the producers of the play, which premiered at San Jose Rep
earlier this year. "This [is a] very tough look at the failings of a
mother and a daughter and how they begin to repair the damage."</TE>
<TE>   Any damage was suffered by the children of such an emotionally
complex and talented couple apparently was compensated for with an
environment in which art, literature, poetry and drama held sway and
talent was nurtured and held to the highest standards.</TE>
<TE>   Given their famous pedigree, all three of the Redgrave children
sought to make their own way in the acting profession and avoid the
inevitable comparisons -- out of sheer self-preservation if nothing
else, Lynn says. "I think we've all aspired to become better and
better as actors because the bar was set so extraordinarily high,"
she says. "Our regular fare was to see the greatest of actors -- our
parents' friends and peers -- and I think because of that, Vanessa,
Corin and I enjoy a shared passion about being actors and respecting
what it takes to do the work."</TE>
<TE>   In later years, Lynn and Corin have also turned to writing,
following another family tradition: Their great-grandfather
Fortunatus Augustus Scudamore was a writer of Victorian melodrama,
and Michael also wrote adaptations and original plays.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn is on to her third play, "Nightingale," a one-person show
about a pinched, disappointed woman whose past is slowly revealed.
Corin, in addition to writing a memoir of his father, has written and
performed a monodrama about Sir Anthony Blunt, a British art scholar
who spied for the Russians (and who was an acquaintance of Michael
Redgrave's during their Cambridge days).</TE>
<TE>   An education in social issues</TE>
<TE>   Corin's current role of Benedict Arnold is yet another conflicted
and complex character in a resume that includes Oscar Wilde in "De
Profundis" and Shakespeare's "Coriolanus." Corin says he is drawn to
playing maverick characters, not unlike his sister Vanessa. That
against-the-grain propensity bleeds into their politics as well.</TE>
<TE>   While Lynn is comparatively less political, Corin and Vanessa have
been -- and are -- committed and active socialists. They are
co-founders of the Workers Revolutionary Party and the Moving
Theatre, a stage company committed to works of contemporary
relevance. Indeed, Corin's last great role in America was a gift from
Vanessa: She discovered an unproduced play of Tennessee Williams,
"Not About Nightingales," and the Moving Theatre brought it to
Broadway with Corin as a towering, sadistic prison boss, a role that
won him a Tony nomination in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The siblings have also acted together through the years. Vanessa
and Lynn were in a West End production of "The Three Sisters" with
Vanessa's daughter Joely. And Corin and Vanessa have assayed the
stage, playing lovers in Coward's "Song at Twilight" and brother and
sister in "The Cherry Orchard." Although Corin maintains that he
doesn't look for social or political relevance in roles, he says,
"One is very glad when it does resonate. When you can share something
about the political condition with the audience, then one feels
doubly blessed. For example, what's striking in Richard's play ['The
General From America'] is this quest for certainty: This is right and
that is wrong, this is good and this evil, the attempt to devise some
sort of moral compass that is due north, and march off confidently.
Well, the world is a much more complex place than that."</TE>
<TE>   Because their father was also a committed leftist, one might
gather that he was instrumental in the development of his children's
tenacious fight for social justice as they see it -- there was a
period when Corin was blacklisted by the BBC and snubbed by the Royal
Shakespeare Company for his radical politics, and Vanessa has been
the subject of countless attacks. But Vanessa says her political
education came first from family friends, actors such as Peggy
Ashcroft and Paul Robeson and intellectuals such as George Devine,
and then through her husband, the late Tony Richardson. "He was the
real [political] shaker and iconoclast of the family," she says. "I
was a very conservative and somewhat ignorant lady compared to him."</TE>
<TE>   Vanessa says that what she did learn from her parents was
discipline ("never to offload your moods and tiredness onto the
process"), openness ("not to judge everything in a play by how I
would react, but to put myself in the shoes of somebody who is not
me") and the sense of acting, in its best expression, as "something
connected to public service."</TE>
<TE>   "I think all good work is of social significance in some way or
another," she adds. "And as a theater family -- and that is what we
are -- those standards are very high. I'll put my mother first,
because she usually gets put last, but as an actress, she was
extraordinarily poignant, tender and had -- and has -- spontaneity
and immediacy, which is stunning. And as for my father, well, the
Shakespearean texts seemed to come from him as though they had never
before been uttered by anyone, including himself. So, when you ask if
I'm feeling nervous about 'Long Day's Journey Into Night,' yes, I'm
feeling quite nervous about Mary Tyrone. It's enormously demanding.
And it is exactly what it says it is: one long shot into the night."</TE>
<TE>   For Vanessa, the crosscurrents of family, politics and art
converged in a moving way a couple of years ago when, after the
liberation of Kosovo, she and her mother participated in an arts
festival in the capital city of Pristina. Rachel Kempson recited
Sonya's concluding speech from Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya" about the
dignity and redemptive power of work and the search for peace until
final rest comes with death. Given the significance of "Vanya" in
Michael's career, the play would already hold a special place in the
Redgrave legacy. But it would also seem to encapsulate the family's
values of hard work, steely determination, personal bravery and the
romantic blood ties that lie beneath it.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, while filming in Australia, Lynn discovered the unmarked
grave of her grandfather and asked her father what he would like to
have put on the stone. "Roy Redgrave, actor," he replied. "Just
yesterday I went and visited my grandfather's grave," Lynn said from
Australia. "It's high on a hill, with the ocean on one side and a
spectacular view of Sydney Harbor on the other. I've always had this
romance about this gypsy life we lead. And Roy, he was an adventurer.</TE>
<TE>   "Just hop on a boat, write a couple of plays on the way, get off,
join the company and behave badly, get drunk. I don't get into the
'behave badly,' the 'get drunk,' but the rest of it, that's exciting;
still exciting. When I get on the plane, get in the car, it's still a
romance."</TE>

<KH>BRIEF ENCOUNTER</KH>
<HD>Adaptable author</HD>
<DH>Susan Orlean wasn't planning on her life being folded into
'Adaptation.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lauren Sandler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Susan Orlean is a literary journalist who expanded her New Yorker
story about a man arrested for stealing rare orchids into the
best-selling book "The Orchid Thief." When "Being John Malkovich"
writer Charlie Kaufman was given the job of adapting Orlean's book,
he became blocked, obsessed with Orlean and with himself, and ended
up expanding and fictionalizing their lives into the script for
"Adaptation." For Orlean, it has been a truly postmodern experience.</LD>
<LD>   In "Adaptation," not only does Charlie Kaufman write himself into
the script, but he writes you in as well. How has it been to have
someone write about you for once?</LD>
<LD>   I think it's a good exercise, in a weird way, for a writer to have
the shoe on the other foot -- it helps you begin to understand what
you do for a living. And that flip is exactly what Charlie is doing
with this movie. It's this M.C. Escher continuous loop about a writer
writing about writing and writing about writing about yourself.</LD>
<TE>   In creating the Susan Orlean in the movie, Kaufman wrote your
character as someone who erupts in a fountain of lies, philandering
and violence -- and all without a clear wink to the audience that
this isn't exactly true to life. Does this concern you?</TE>
<TE>   You'd be foolish not to have a little concern about that. There's
a risk, of course, because some people will see the movie and walk
out convinced that every bit is meant to be docudrama. If the people
who made this movie weren't so serious about making a good movie --
if this was "Porky's" instead -- it would have been a dangerous,
crazy thing to do professionally. But to be involved in a movie like
this is part of what I couldn't resist -- the opportunity to
participate in something extraordinary.</TE>
<TE>   And what is that experience as a journalist? How do you feel about
being widely perceived not as a New Yorker writer with a private life
but as the basis for the character in "Adaptation"?</TE>
<TE>   I suppose that if I wrote about Hollywood it would be different. I
almost never do. And that's part of the great joke of all of this.
I've been a crusading voice against celebrity journalism for a really
long time. But people I write about tend to be enveloped in their own
subcultures, and I'm not sure they'll know about the movie. When I
met Meryl Streep [who plays Orlean], she threw her arms around me and
said, "This is going to change your life a lot more than mine." I
know what she meant by that, but I'm not sure yet.</TE>
<TE>   Were you happy with Streep's portrayal?</TE>
<TE>   It was such a relief when she was cast, like knowing you're going
into an operation with the chief of the Mayo Clinic -- scary and
weird, but at least I knew I had the best doctor. She brought a sort
of dignity to this whole strange experience. But it's funny the
things you notice -- like there's not an article of clothing she
wears in this movie that I would ever own.</TE>
<TE>   Do elements of Kaufman's script seem to understand a deeper layer
of your persona than what you have revealed in your own writing?
Like, how did he know that?</TE>
<TE>   There were certain elements of the screenplay where it was
completely unnerving. And I've never talked to Charlie about that.
I've never asked how he could divine me without my ever expressing
those things. Someday I'll buy him a beer and ask him.</TE>

<HD>Philosophy written in the stars</HD>
<DH>The college study of 'Star Trek' episodes and movies leads
to some penetrating discussions about human nature.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carolyn Patricia Scott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"But they're both the real Kirk. It's not that one is the impostor,"
Arthur Lechtholz-Zey argues.</LD>
<LD>   James Stramel disagrees. "I think that one of the reasons why the
rational but weak and ineffectual Kirk is regarded as the real Kirk
-- the good one -- is because the view of 'Star Trek' and the episode
is that what is most definitive of the human personality is our
reason," he says.</LD>
<LD>   An argument between a pair of Trekkies? A disagreement between
sci-fi fanatics? No. This scene is from a recent class session of
"Philosophy 41: The Philosophy of 'Star Trek.' " Lechtholz-Zey is one
of about 30 students taking in the new course at Santa Monica
College; Stramel is one of two professors teaching the class; and,
yes, that's Captain Kirk they're discussing.</LD>
<TE>   The television classic has been praised, imitated, examined and
parodied on television, in dormitories and living rooms for more than
35 years. Its very language has entered into the modern lexicon ever
since William Shatner as Kirk commanded: "Beam me up, Scotty!" But
the science fiction saga, though frequently cited in film, television
and writing classes, is not the standard for the study of philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Star Trek' is intentionally philosophical," the course's other
instructor, Amber Katherine, explains. Stramel finishes her thought:
"Most people who watch it like the explosions and the crazy aliens,
and that's fine, but they're being introduced to and being stimulated
to think -- if only in a kind of fuzzy and inchoate way -- about
various philosophical problems.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact," Stramel continues, "almost every episode is a morality
play; they raise all kinds of topical issues."</TE>
<TE>   Students enrolled in the course are just as convinced of the
validity of the study of philosophy through the "Star Trek" lens.
"I'm actually a UCLA student," Glennn Medrano admits, "but I'm
enrolled here, because I'm very much interested in the things that
'Star Trek' offers -- it's kind of like multidisciplinary; it has
elements of sociology that I find interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, not everyone on campus understands the concept. One of
the fliers announcing the class that the professors had distributed
throughout the campus came back to their lecture room on the first
day of class with the header "Philosophy 41: The Philosophy of 'Star
Trek' " crossed out and tagged: "And also Philosophy 4: 'Leave It to
Beaver': Back-to-Back Episodes Every Night."</TE>
<TE>   Stramel dismisses the resistance to the idea of a class focused on
a popular show by pointing out "we are going to be exploring the
philosophy of the show in order to teach philosophy through an
interesting and popular medium." In essence, the original series and
all of its spinoffs, as well as the "Star Trek" movies, become the
text for the class.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to give students some critical thinking skills,"
Katherine says. "That will enable them to read the text of television
in a way that's as sophisticated as they might read a literary text."
Screenings are supplemented with readings from books, including "Star
Trek: The Human Frontier," by Michele Barrett and Duncan Barrett.</TE>
<TE>   Allegories in space</TE>
<TE>   The establishment of the class doesn't surprise Rick Berman,
producer of "Star Trek: Nemesis," the latest film that opened Friday.
"It's not surprising that teachers from grammar school to graduate
school try to in some way incorporate the issues that are explored in
'Star Trek' and also the reason for why it's been so popular for so
long -- from the original series to our movie 'Star Trek.'</TE>
<TE>   "Voyager," "Deep Space Nine" and "Enterprise" are "thoroughly
postmodern ," Katherine says. "Where the original 'Star Trek' and
'The Next Generation' series examined societal issues in simple
allegories that were, in effect, morality plays, the later shows do
not.</TE>
<TE>   "They pick and choose and they paste together in this acontextual
and ahistorical way a text that alludes to a lot of the issues in our
culture," Katherine continues. Do the producers and writers,
consciously lay out philosophical mazes? "Star Trek" creator Gene
Roddenberry created the show during the Cold War and wanted to
present uplifting themes, Berman says. From the maiden television
voyage of the Enterprise in 1966 on, there was a conscious effort to
address contemporary sociopolitical issues.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an episode coming up on 'Enterprise' that deals in a very
abstract fashion -- as science fiction tends to do well, through
metaphor as opposed to hitting it right on the head -- with the
stigma against people with HIV and AIDS," Berman says"But when we do
movies the major purpose is to entertain," he says. "John Logan, the
writer of our most recent movie, 'Nemesis,' has combined both
emotional and intellectual into the themes in the story, but it's
always got to be mixed in with something that is action-packed, funny
and epic."</TE>
<TE>   Epic proportions notwithstanding, one of the story lines in
"Nemesis" very nearly parallels a vintage "Star Trek" television
episode, "The Enemy Within," which by coincidence was the episode
chosen for screening at a recent night's class. The story revolves
around Kirk, split in two, rendering a weak and indecisive person and
an aggressive, belligerent, combative person -- neither suitable to
command a starship. "That's exactly what we're doing with this movie,
in terms of Captain Picard [played by Patrick Stewart in the TV
series "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and subsequent "Star Trek"
films] facing himself and Data [the android lieutenant commander
played by Brent Spiner in the same series and films] likewise facing
himself."</TE>
<TE>   In the Santa Monica College classroom, the concept of "facing
oneself" is taken even further. "The concept that to be human is to
be a rational, unified self is challenged after 'The Next
Generation.' In other words, the modern concept of the self is
replaced by the postmodern concept that says, in effect, that to be
human is to be ambiguous and fluid," Katherine concludes.</TE>
<TE>   Moviegoers may come out of the theater admiring the special
effects, but the would-be "Star Trek" philosophers will debate
whether "Nemesis" is returning to Roddenberry's views or howAristotle
or Plato would have assessed variations in the modern and postmodern
ethos of fictional starship captains Kirk and Picard's responses.</TE>

<KH>MEDIA MATTERS / DAVID SHAW</KH>
<HD>Yes, papers chase Pulitzers, but society benefits from it</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was leafing through a 24-page special section the Seattle Times
published early this month on AIDS in Africa, and maybe because I had
just finished reading the Hollywood Reporter moments earlier, I was
struck by what seemed an interesting confluence of ambitions.</LD>
<LD>   This is traditionally the time of year when the Hollywood studios
release their most prestigious movies, even if only for a week, in
only two cities -- New York and Los Angeles -- the bare minimum
required before year's end so they can qualify for Academy Award
consideration. Somewhat less well-known to the general public, this
is also the time of year when many newspapers across the country rush
to get their most prestigious reporting projects into print so they
can qualify for journalism's equivalent of the Oscars -- the Pulitzer
Prizes -- which also require a calendar-year release for eligibility.</LD>
<TE>   Although the Oscar and the Pulitzer winners are announced in the
spring -- March 23 and April 7, respectively, next year -- I don't
mean to extend this comparison too far. After all, a worldwide
television audience estimated at 1 billion people watches the
prime-time Oscars, and such superstars as Billy Crystal, Whoopi
Goldberg and Steve Martin have served as hosts; the Pulitzer awards
ceremony is largely an in-house affair, an invitation-only lunch
attended by fewer than 300 people, and Rube Goldberg would be a more
likely luncheon host than Whoopi.</TE>
<TE>   But both awards have enormous status in their respective
communities, and while I certainly wouldn't claim that Pulitzer
winners are remotely as well-known to the general public as Oscar
winners, I have been surprised over the years to see how even the
least media-savvy people perk up and pay homage when someone is
introduced, in a social setting, as a "Pulitzer Prize winner." And
that is often how they are introduced -- forever after.</TE>
<TE>   But the renown attached to the Pulitzers notwithstanding, some
journalists question the zeal with which their employers pursue the
prize. I've heard many reporters and editors grumble that newspapers
only do certain stories to try to win a Pulitzer -- that this or that
paper wasted its resources because editors assigned four reporters
for three months and devoted 10 pages of space over a week's time (or
whatever), not to serve readers but only to go after Pulitzer glory.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, I heard a similar complaint about the Oscars last
summer, when a young man I know grumbled that too many movies are
made "just to win Oscars."</TE>
<TE>   I said to him what I've said to colleagues who've complained about
the Pulitzers: "There's nothing wrong with doing something to win an
award if you wind up doing something better than you otherwise would
have."</TE>
<TE>   Having been a Pulitzer judge, I can tell you that, given how poor
most newspapers in this country are, I was pleasantly surprised --
indeed, astonished -- by how much excellent journalism I saw. Other
judges felt the same way. Even if the stories we read were done only
in pursuit of a Pulitzer, the readers in those newspapers'
communities were much better served than if the stories had not been
done.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to win a Pulitzer and actually winning one are, of course,
two very different things. Last year, there were almost 2,000
Pulitzer entries -- and 14 winners.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the high level of competition and the different standards
and tastes of [the judges] ... you can't just set your cap for a
Pulitzer on one story and expect to win," says Eugene Roberts, former
executive editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer. "My theory has always
been that for every Pulitzer you get, you probably have to have five
things worth a Pulitzer."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts should know. The Inquirer won 17 Pulitzers under his
editorship, and he was widely perceived within the industry as being
more astute than anyone at else at coming up with Pulitzer-worthy
stories.</TE>
<TE>   Boons of good journalism</TE>
<TE>   All this might seem of purely intramural journalistic interest
were it not for the importance of good journalism to the health of
our democratic society. This is especially true at a time when most
newspaper owners -- worried about diminished profits -- are
increasingly unwilling to spend the money necessary to do good
journalism.</TE>
<TE>   The best newspapers -- the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Wall
Street Journal and Washington Post, all with daily circulations
ranging from 750,000 to 1.7 million -- would do world-class
journalism even if there were no Pulitzers. There are several other
papers, large and small, of which the same could be said.</TE>
<TE>   But one of the great things about the Pulitzers -- unlike the
Oscars -- is that very small papers, with very limited resources,
sometimes win. Oh sure, Miramax likes to position itself as the
underdog independent battling the big, bad studios, but by the time
Miramax won its first Oscar for best picture -- in 1997, for "The
English Patient," which was released in 1996 -- it was part of the
billion-dollar Disney empire.</TE>
<TE>   It's not uncommon, though, for a truly small newspaper to win a
Pulitzer -- and to win it for performing such valuable public
services as examining alcohol abuse and the problems it creates in
the community (the Great Falls [Mont.] Tribune, circulation 34,000);
exposing the destruction of a local coal company by men with ties to
organized crime (the Pottsville [Pa.] Republican, circulation
29,000); investigating the state's unusually high infant-mortality
rate and prompting legislation to combat the problem (the Alabama
Journal of Montgomery, circulation 23,000); investigating the links
between rampant local crime and the corruption of the local criminal
justice system -- and initiating political reforms (the Virgin
Islands Daily News, circulation 16,000); and investigating the death
of a local Marine and prompting a fundamental reform in Marine Corps
recruitment and training practices (Lufkin [Texas] Daily News,
circulation 13,000).</TE>
<TE>   The smallest paper ever to win a Pulitzer was a weekly -- the
Point Reyes (Calif.) Light, circulation. 3,000, which won for its
investigation of Synanon. The first non-dailies to win -- the
Whiteville (N.C.) News Reporter and the Tabor City (N.C.) Tribune --
were also small, with a combined weekly circulation of less than
7,000. They won Pulitzer gold medals in 1953 for separate but
similarly courageous three-year campaigns exposing the Ku Klux Klan,
racism and lynchings.</TE>
<TE>   Am I suggesting that any of these particular stories were assigned
and written with a Pulitzer in mind? Or that they would not have been
written had there been no Pulitzers? No. I'm no mind reader. Besides,
I think most journalists go into the profession because they want to
seek justice, expose wrongdoing, comfort the afflicted and shine a
light in dark and ugly corners, and they would do so with or without
prizes.</TE>
<TE>   But I've been around newspapers long enough to know that many
stories are conceived with the visions of a Pulitzer dancing in the
editor's eyes. And I see nothing wrong with that. People may disagree
in any given year about whether the "best" story won a Pulitzer. But
unlike the Oscars, no bad or weak entries win.</TE>
<TE>   No one wins a Pulitzer for the journalistic equivalent of such
cinematic fluff as "The Greatest Show on Earth" and "Around the World
in 80 Days," both of which were chosen as best picture of the year.
That's why, when I hear about all those papers rolling their stories
with Pulitzer potential into print at this time of the year, I can
only applaud.</TE>

<LD>Out went the family piano and the living room furniture. In came the
Steinway concert grand and dozens of velvet-cushioned chairs. And
there was even more heavy lifting to do at the Beverly Hills estate
of director-producer Irwin Winkler and his wife, Margo, before the
couple could welcome American Friends of the Israel Philharmonic
Orchestra to a benefit gala starring Chinese pianist Lang Lang. The
den furniture also had to be whisked away, making room for a dozen
tables for the formal post-performance supper. The home's "denuding,"
as Margo Winkler playfully dubbed it, was unsettling, she said, only
minutes before the couple welcomed about 70 guests, including Israel
Philharmonic Orchestra music director Zubin Mehta and Nancy Mehta,
and philanthropists Eli Broad and Edye Broad. But worth it: "What
could be better than having Lang Lang appear in your home?" the
Winklers chimed.</LD>
<TE>   Nothing, it seemed. Dedicating his performance to the Mehtas,
Lang, 20, thrilled the crowd with powerful renditions of Haydn's
Sonata in E, Lecuona's Malaguena and Balakirev's Fantasie Orientale.
Guests jumped to their feet to applaud the young artist, who would
make his debut at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion the following
evening. "He is a meteor, a rocket who has just taken off!" Zubin
Mehta exclaimed. After the performance, guests retired to the
den-turned-dining-room to feast on roasted chestnut soup, rack of
lamb and chocolate truffle cake -- catered by Wolfgang Puck -- at
tables topped with antique silver teapots filled with white peonies.
The Dec. 4 "Evening of Musical Dreams" raised $300,000 for orchestra
operations and education programs.</TE>
<TE>   "I came back yesterday from Israel, after opening the orchestra's
season," Mehta told guests, who also included Sidney and Joanna
Poitier, Susan and Leonard Nimoy, Maurice and Nathalie Marciano and
Peter and Annette O'Malley. "Life is going on, unusually so. Just
this past March, when the orchestra was playing with Japanese pianist
Mitsuko Uchida, a bomb just 15 blocks away exploded before the
performance, and yet the hall was filled. People need this incredible
2 1/2 hours in a concert hall." The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra
will return to Los Angeles on Dec. 10 of next year to appear at the
new Walt Disney Concert Hall, Mehta said.</TE>

<LD>High above the glittering Hollywood &amp; Highland shopping mall and its
hordes of consumers, actress Maggie Gyllenhaal detailed her
fascination with sadomasochism.</LD>
<LD>   Outside the Highlands club on Sunday night, the delicate actress
explained how she watched porn films to prepare for her role in
"Secretary," an especially challenging turn as a masochist that
earned her a place among the winners of Movieline magazine's
Breakthrough Awards. "At first it was so incredibly intense," she
said of watching a porn actress degraded in various ways. "And then I
realized she was totally overwhelmed ... and she was actually feeling
something. I think it's what everyone wants. To be overwhelmed."</LD>
<LD>   Gyllenhaal's introspection was especially striking, as elsewhere
around the nightclub celebrity worship seemed the prevalent mode.</LD>
<TE>   Actress Laura Harring showed off her "exotic, Sri Lanka" jewelry
to a group of adoring female friends. To the plumpest she clucked,
"You're so skinny!" Lili Taylor sank into one of the overstuffed
leather couches in the lounge, popping up occasionally to pose with
various party sponsors for a photographer.</TE>
<TE>   George Clooney made his way into the party with Sam Rockwell, who
was being honored for his role as game show host and self-described
CIA assassin Chuck Barris in "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind." Waldo
Sanchez tailed them, carrying a tiny film camera and headphones. He
explained that after working as Clooney's "hair designer" on
"Confessions," he became inspired by the actor's directorial debut.
So he started a documentary about it. "It's kind of an appendage to
the film," Sanchez said.</TE>
<TE>   The Breakthrough Awards are bestowed on actors and filmmakers for
career-launching work by Movieline's editors, who determine the
winners after seeing 15-minute clips of each picture. Last year's
awards were the first, held primarily to mark the arrival of actress
Naomi Watts, who struggled for years before finding a place in the
spotlight in "Mulholland Drive."</TE>
<TE>   This year's winners also included actors Derek Luke ("The Antwone
Fisher Story") and Salma Hayek ("Frida"), writer-director Joe
Carnahan ("Narc") and skateboard legend Tony Hawk (honored for his
philanthropy and for starting his own film production company).</TE>
<TE>   One of the more heartfelt thanks came from Luke to Denzel
Washington, who cast the Sony Pictures Studios gift shop clerk as the
star of "The Antwone Fisher Story," Washington's own directorial
debut. "I came from the 'hood and I never had any role models," said
Luke, holding back tears. "I've never won anything in my life."</TE>

<HD>Computing 'Star Trek' data</HD>
<DH>Brent Spiner, who plays a gold-tinted android, reviews some
essentials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gordon Cox</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brent Spiner's eyes are blue. This may come as a surprise to many
people familiar with the actor from his best-known role. It takes
yellow contact lenses, not to mention darkened hair and a coat of
gold-tinted body paint, to transform Spiner into Data, the
inquisitive android from "Star Trek: The Next Generation."</LD>
<LD>   Underneath the shiny makeup, Spiner is a versatile actor who has
appeared on Broadway in the Stephen Sondheim musical "Sunday in the
Park with George," and in "1776." But the 53-year-old Houston native
will always be best remembered as Data, a role he played in the "Next
Generation" TV series (1987-94) and in subsequent movies.</LD>
<LD>   In "Star Trek: Nemesis," which opened Friday, Spiner also plays
B4, an earlier model of the android.</LD>
<TE>   How is it to play Data again?</TE>
<TE>   It's like summer camp. You get to come back and play with your
friends.</TE>
<TE>   You're also credited as a writer on "Nemesis." Have you ever
written for "Star Trek" before?</TE>
<TE>   Surreptitiously, yeah, but not upfront. A lot of what we worked on
in the "Nemesis" story is: What haven't we done, and what haven't we
seen? We wanted to do a really great action picture, but to make it
about something and give it emotional depth.</TE>
<TE>   Are you a Trekkie?</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't say so. I think "Star Trek" is good stuff, and I think
it's a really honorable piece of pop culture. But I was always more
drawn to comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Do you consider yourself a comedian?</TE>
<TE>   Comedy is definitely the way I see things. And I think that from
the beginning, ["Star Trek" creator] Gene Roddenberry saw Data as the
comic relief on "Next Generation."</TE>
<TE>   What about those hard-core Trekkies?</TE>
<TE>   In general I think "Star Trek" fans have gotten a bad rap through
the years. "Saturday Night Live" perpetuated this myth that "Star
Trek" fans are weird people. They're not. They're no more weird than
Deadheads or any other kind of fans. They're just people who enjoy
"Star Trek."</TE>
<TE>   There's talk of "Nemesis" being the last "Star Trek" movie.</TE>
<TE>   If the movie's successful, we'll make another one. If it's not
successful, we won't. We tried to end on a note of hope, and there's
no certainty about what's going to happen next.</TE>

<HD>Films that fill a cable niche</HD>
<DH>Made-for-TV movies, once a staple on the broadcast
networks, are helping more narrowly focused channels serve their
audiences.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Craig Tomashoff</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the beginning, there was the Movie. It survived and flourished,
drawing viewers out of their homes and into theaters. Then, starting
in the late '60s, everything changed. Instead of going out to see
major movie productions, people could sit in their living rooms and
watch ambitious network efforts like "Brian's Song" and, later,
"Sarah Plain and Tall."</LD>
<LD>   During the past decade, things have changed even more, as HBO
became the showcase for costly yet important films, from "And the
Band Played On" to "Live From Baghdad." At the same time,
coincidentally or not, the broadcast networks have pulled back
sharply. Where once ABC, CBS and NBC all had Sunday night movie
franchises -- showing original films as well as theatrical releases
-- now only CBS remains with a weekly presence, and they've got to be
wondering why they even bother.</LD>
<LD>   Competition from regular series like NBC's "Law &amp; Order Criminal
Intent" and HBO's "The Sopranos," coupled with overall movie-format
fatigue, has meant that all but a few CBS movies have drawn poor
ratings, as have those from ABC on Sunday. All of this has led to
chatter that the TV movie genre was all but dead, except on the pay
cable channels HBO and Showtime.</LD>
<TE>   However, the third phase in the evolution of TV movies has
arrived; even as the networks pull back, the made-for-TV movie has
been born again on even some of the most narrowly focused cable
networks. Now it's not simply Lifetime, USA or TNT that are in the
game; even niche cable outlets not generally thought of as homes for
original fictional movies are getting into the business.</TE>
<TE>   Animal Planet, ESPN and Court TV are just some of the unexpected
channels where original movies are cropping up.</TE>
<TE>   "I can remember in the mid-'90s, when channels like USA and TNT
announced they were going to be doing movies, and it seemed like such
an out-there proposition," recalls MTV and VH1 Entertainment
President Brian Graden. "TV movies were what the networks did. But
now, all of cable really is the predominant home for the genre."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, for instance, Court TV aired its second
original film, "The Interrogation of Michael Crowe." This weekend,
ESPN was to premiere its second movie, "The Junction Boys." On Jan.
5, Animal Planet will show "Gentle Ben II," a sequel to an original
film it aired last year. Comedy Central joined the trend earlier this
fall with the fact-based film "Porn 'N Chicken." Even the Oxygen
Network, which seldom has dabbled with much fictional, scripted
programming, has recently completed production on its first movie,
set to air next summer.</TE>
<TE>   The movies are all quite different, but their networks have one
goal in mind: These shouldn't just be good films, they should also be
good advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "When we started thinking about doing it, we realized that the
last thing any viewer really needed was another TV movie," explains
Henry Schlieff, chairman and chief executive of Court TV Network.
"But there are diverse reasons to get into this. HBO's agenda is to
distinguish itself. For Lifetime, it's a volume business that helps
with ad sales. From our perspective, we're still defining our brand,
and a long-form program -- specifically a movie -- is the single most
useful tool with which to do that."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, if you want to know the core mission of a
particular channel, just check out its original movies.</TE>
<TE>   "The movies serve two purposes," says Animal Planet executive vice
president and general manager Michael Cascio. "They bring in a bigger
audience because they are a familiar form of entertainment for
viewers. But they are also the chance to carry the message of your
network to that audience."</TE>
<TE>   Whereas a broadcast network TV movie has to appeal to as large an
audience as possible to lure in the maximum amount of viewers and
advertisers, smaller cable outlets can be more selective about what
they put on. And, since their networks are built around a narrow,
easily definable interest -- sports, criminal justice, etc. -- they
can produce projects their viewers are almost certain to want.</TE>
<TE>   "In cable, you have so much more freedom to really focus on one
audience and super-serve that group," explains Debby Beece, president
of programming for the Oxygen network. "You can go more in-depth with
what your viewers want and not worry about appealing to big groups."</TE>
<TE>   This means the original movies on Cascio's channel must be
"family-friendly and celebrate the relationship between humans and
animals," he adds. For the Oxygen network, which primarily targets
female viewers, that means mining the romantic comedy genre. Court TV
movies are fact-based legal dramas that "are activist. When you see
them, you want to get up out of your chair and do something,"
Schlieff says.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, ESPN movies are going to have something to do with guys
and glory. "When it comes to sports TV movies, there really is a
void," explains Marc Shapiro, executive vice president of programming
and production at ESPN. "If somebody is going to fill that void, why
wouldn't it be us?"</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the niche channels' desire for niche movies
seems to be working. When Court TV aired its first original film,
"Guilt by Association," last March, Schlieff saw "a significant
increase in new viewers in that time slot. It was a seminal moment
for our network, proving to everyone that we were no longer just the
place to go for trial coverage."</TE>
<TE>   The average rating for each of Animal Planet's film premieres was
167% of what the network normally received in that time period. Of
the audience that tuned in ESPN's first made-for-TV movie effort last
March, "A Season on the Brink," 20% "either didn't watch the channel
or used to and turned away from it," according to Shapiro.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, "Porn 'N Chicken" became the highest-rated movie Comedy
Central has ever aired, and that includes major theatrical releases
like "Private Benjamin" and "Blazing Saddles."</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to bring new viewers to the network, but we can't
go off-brand to do it," says Bill Hilary, executive vice president
and general manager of Comedy Central. "The temptation is there to
make movies safer, to be like a network movie and go for the broad
audience, but we're niche networks. That's never been what we're in
the business for."</TE>
<TE>   Taking some risks</TE>
<TE>   It's a tricky balance, though. Networks have to give their
faithful audience something familiar, but they also want to lure
viewers who wouldn't ordinarily have a big interest in their channel.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to take some risks, and doing movies is one of them,"
Shapiro says. "We've always been the place for sports fans to go for
news and information, and that will still dominate our schedule. But
if you're truly going to bring in new viewers, younger viewers and
female viewers, you have to stretch into new territories."</TE>
<TE>   According to Beece, it's no accident that these channels have
taken a page from the major network playbooks by cramming the
commercial breaks during their movies with countless promotional
spots for the channel's other programs. "From a marketing standpoint,
it's a good hook. You throw a lot of promotion out there so people
can see what else you've got. It becomes a vehicle to bring people
into the network."</TE>
<TE>   The trend toward producing films isn't strictly about bringing in
more viewers, though. It's also often done to save money.
Traditionally, cable channels have turned to former theatrical and
network fare to fill their schedules. By making their own product,
however, they are more in control of their own destiny and their own
budget.</TE>
<TE>   "Making a movie can cost around $2 million or $3 million, but we
can make a lot of that back in international sales," Hilary says.
"The actual cost can end up around $1.4 million, which is a lot less
than theatrical movies you can buy that have already been around the
block a few times. So obviously, we'd like to do a few more of our
own and build a library. After all, there's only a certain amount of
times you can play 'Ferris Bueller' before it gets old."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Cascio: "Any time you can make the statement that you're
about original programming, that's preferable to just buying the
first run of 'Dr. Dolittle,' even though we'd like to have that movie
too. But when you have to spend half of your budget on one theatrical
release, it's not going to be worth it. Still, economics are not the
main reason for doing this. It's just another tool to get an audience
in and show the uniqueness of your channel."</TE>
<TE>   As much of a bargain as home-grown movies may be for niche
networks, none of them seem to be rushing too many projects into
development. Court TV has started work on its next film, "Political
Asylum," about the immigration system. Comedy Central is working on a
trio of films, one of which it is also planning on turning into a
weekly series. Animal Planet would like to do four to six movies a
year and has recently finished "Big Spender," set to air later next
year.</TE>
<TE>   Even larger channels like MTV and VH1 have come to realize that
movies should be just one key element in a programmer's arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to look at them through a branding, not a commodity,
prism," Graden says. "For us, doing movies just creates a more
interesting tapestry across the channels. When you mix them in, you
have yet another personality you can put forth, and the goal for a
channel is to be as rich and varied as possible."</TE>
<TE>   The production list may be relatively small, but if these movies
continue to succeed, there's no telling how far this trend could go.
Perhaps it's best to prepare now for a made-for-the-Weather-Channel
film about a problematic cumulus cloud that eventually reforms or a
very special Food Network presentation -- "Eggs Florentine: The
Movie."</TE>

<LD>Chicago playwright James Sherman ("Beau Jest") was listening to the
radio last month when the appointment of Hu Jintao -- China's new
Communist Party chief -- was announced. He knocked off a parody of
Abbott and Costello's classic baseball routine "Who's on First" and
sent it to 20 friends.</LD>
<LD>   Within days, media outlets such as Newsweek, Esquire and Germany's
Focus magazine contacted him. And, while "Googling" himself last
week, he found "Hu's on First" posted on Web sites in Italy,
Portugal, Germany and Scandinavia.</LD>
<LD>   "This was a huge lesson in the power of the Internet," Sherman
said. "I'm a little concerned that I'll be hearing from [homeland
security czar] Tom Ridge any day. There's a subculture that passes
along stuff like this. And Bush -- a C student, full of malapropisms
-- is certainly ripe for satire."</LD>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>London</DL>
<LD>The first we see of Ralph Fiennes in the upcoming psychological
thriller "Spider," he is stepping gingerly onto the platform of a
soot-stained London railway station, looking as disturbed and grimy
as his surroundings.</LD>
<LD>   It is immediately clear we are not in Bridget Jones' London
anymore. The man descending from the train is Spider, a schizophrenic
with a terrible past, and he moves along the platform toward his
destiny in the haunted, tortured manner upon which Fiennes has built
a canon of characters over a 10-year career.</LD>
<LD>   Spider joins those other dark souls of Fiennes' list of screen
credits, from the sadistic Nazi concentration camp commandant in
"Schindler's List" to the fatally burned pilot in "The English
Patient," all, as he put it in a recent interview in London,
"screwed-up, angst-filled men who had either lost their love, were
adulterous or are completely stressed out."</LD>
<TE>   The ability to tap into weirder minds has served Fiennes well. As
he turns a youthful-looking 40 this month, the English actor's award
shelf already includes two Oscar nominations (supporting actor for
"Schindler's List," and best actor for "English Patient) and a Tony
Award for playing -- no surprise here -- Hamlet. But it is a
cultivated style that also limits the variety of scripts coming his
way.</TE>
<TE>   "Ralph's always doing that 'I'm being burned at the stake' thing,"
is how one London theater producer somewhat cattily puts it. Which is
one reason Fiennes is also appearing on American screens as a
love-struck U.S. senator, swept away by Jennifer Lopez in Wayne
Wang's light, blatantly commercial "Maid in Manhattan," which opened
Friday. ("Spider" opens this coming Friday; "Maid" is being released
by Sony, "Spider" by Sony Classics.)</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt I was seen only as someone who did very serious,
art-house-oriented films," Fiennes says after a day's rehearsal at
London's Royal National Theatre, where he is back to playing the very
serious again as psychoanalyst Carl Jung in Christopher Hampton's
"The Talking Cure," which opened here last week. "I don't get offered
any romantic comedies. I don't get the parts that I guess Hugh Grant
has cornered very brilliantly."</TE>
<TE>   He smiles at the reference to Grant, Britain's foppish, bankable
leading man. Even with the rake of an unfashionably early 20th
century-style mustache he's cultivated to play Jung, Fiennes' good
looks burn through in a way the blinking Grant will never match.
There is less intensity to Fiennes off screen, no effort to create
mystique. But he does complain that roles haven't been coming his way
because, he says, he is tagged as a "not many laughs, preoccupied
with some inner struggle" kind of actor.</TE>
<TE>   Enter "Maid in Manhattan," during which the Fiennes character gets
to, among other things, politely ogle Lopez's famous bottom.
"Perfect," is the senator's assessment (though given his own string
of roles requiring him to, as they say in Britain, "get his kit off,"
perhaps Fiennes is the one who should consider taking out some
insurance on his rear).</TE>
<TE>   "The film is a very warm, uncomplicated love letter to New York,
and from the feedback I'm getting, people think I'm likable in it,"
Fiennes says in a modest tone. "We'll see," he adds. "It's made for
this particular market, and I have no way of knowing. Is this
people's taste?"</TE>
<TE>   Try and try again</TE>
<TE>   Working with J.Lo Inc. is Fiennes' second attempt to cast aside
the "complicated" tag for a lighter screen identity. The first,
taking debonair detective John Steed from the camp '60s British TV
series up to the big screen in the 1998 film "The Avengers, " failed
miserably. "People at the time were behind that choice, agents and
friends, saying, 'We're going to see you as something else -- this
confident, easy, witty Englishman,' " Fiennes recalls with a pained
grin. "Patrick Macnee, who was the real John Steed, read our script
and said, 'This is a really good "Avengers" episode. If only we'd had
this quality ourselves.' But it just didn't translate.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just one of those things that happens in the movie
business," Fiennes says and sighs. "But it did bruise me. You get
knocked like that, you do think: 'Ouch.' "</TE>
<TE>   But he was not ready to withdraw into type, making nothing but
film adaptations of classic Russian novels written in verse (though
he did do one of them, 1998's adaptation of Pushkin's "Onegin"
directed by his sister, Martha).</TE>
<TE>   He recovered his commercial balance to make this fall's horror
thriller "Red Dragon," starring as serial killer Francis Dolarhyde in
the Hannibal Lecter prequel. Another dark character, but at least one
in a movie aimed at making money (even if the film was something of a
box-office disappointment).But Fiennes is pretty clear he does these
parts to pay for the freedom to choose roles that stir his soul. And
"Spider" is one of them, a movie he wanted to make so badly for so
long that he deferred his fee (as did co-star Miranda Richardson and
director David Cronenberg) when a block of financing fell through
three weeks before shooting of the $8-million film began. It is a
visceral performance that some say you could build an Oscar campaign
around, which is why the film will have a short December release
ahead of its wider February distribution.</TE>
<TE>   The "previously published material" on which the movie is based is
Patrick McGrath's singular 1991 novel of the same name. It is the
story of a man released from a psychiatric institution into a London
halfway house, struggling to get a fix on the monstrous childhood
event that is repeat-playing in his head.</TE>
<TE>   "The novel has a major literary conceit at the center of it, in
that a man whose personality is disintegrating is able to write so
beautifully yet still be the basket case that he is," Cronenberg said
by phone from Toronto, where he lives.</TE>
<TE>   The director's solution was to drop the screenplay's dependency on
Spider narrating his story as he writes a journal in English.
Instead, Fiennes as Spider scrawls notes obsessively in a script
intelligible only to himself, taking "evidence" about the crime he
believes has been committed.</TE>
<TE>   Getting inside the role</TE>
<TE>   The magic lies with Fiennes' ability to wordlessly embody Spider's
thoughts, his pain, the kinetic crashing of conspiracies and
confusion.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, anyone expecting to hear that famously silky,
Shakespearean-trained voice had better go rent "Quiz Show" again.
Fiennes' Spider mumbles through the film, speaking in mantras that
tug at his character's memories. "If you listen to the mumbles, if
you could really decipher them, they do all relate to Spider's life
and his obsessions and the loops he has going round in his head,"
Cronenberg says.</TE>
<TE>   But Cronenberg makes it clear he was not looking for "clinical
accuracy" in the portrait of a schizophrenic. Still, Fiennes sought
out schizophrenics before shooting began to get a sense of the range
of behavior among the afflicted. And it was he who hit on Spider's
mumbling ways, improvising the bleak persona for an enthusiastic
Cronenberg during rehearsals.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be [people] who say: 'This isn't the way
schizophrenics are; some are very normal people who have families and
hold down jobs," Fiennes says. "But I wanted to see what was out
there and come back and weave it all together to create my own
Spider. David wasn't trying to do a documentary. He was making a
piece of art. And I love that. I think that's right."</TE>
<TE>   The result is a character who wears his inner damage like a coat.
He is greasy, with splotchy skin and nicotine-stained fingers.
Fiennes and Cronenberg, who attest to their friendship formed on the
set ("He's a lovely guy, very sweet. Not weak, but sweet," the
director says) shared an image of Spider looking a bit like Irish
playwright Samuel Beckett. Spiky hair. Very angular face. "Sort of
like a plucked hen," Fiennes says.</TE>
<TE>   But it is a professional tribute to Fiennes, a man with more than
a smattering of nobility about him, that his shuffling, downcast
Spider is so achingly authentic.</TE>
<TE>   "Well what's the truth to someone like Spider?" asks Fiennes
rhetorically, almost impatient that the point is not being grasped.
"He doesn't wash. He smokes nonstop. He probably has a mouth like an
ashtray. His feet probably smell. It's an urban London skin that's
not washed. And that is how I imagined it."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the eight-week-shoot, Cronenberg fretted about his
friend's appearance. "There were bones sticking out of his face
behind his ears and I was kind of worried about him. He kept losing
weight throughout the shoot. And he didn't wash, I can tell you."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh I did bathe," Fiennes says and laughs in response.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes tremendous courage to dump your movie-star image in
order to be the character," says Robert Lantos, the Canadian producer
who worked with Fiennes on "Sunshine," in which he played three
characters across separate generations of Hungarian Jews. "Most of
the time when you're watching movie stars you never forget you're
watching a movie star, nor do they let you forget that you're
watching a movie star."</TE>
<TE>   For "Sunshine," Fiennes also lowered his price to ensure a movie
he believed in got made. "The money was never an issue, though, and
we waited for him for about a year because he was doing 'Avengers,'
for which he was being paid a fortune."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, says Lantos, "if you want to make films that have
something important to say and are challenging, then you have to
accept the economic reality of that world. Ralph goes where his heart
takes him. And if you're a truly great actor, committed to your
craft, you do exactly that."</TE>
<TE>   The challenge of the theater also provides Fiennes with retreat
from the intrusions that accompany being a celebrity, A-list actor.
(In Fiennes' case, the media chatter here tends to focus on the
19-year age difference between him and Francesca Annis, the
accomplished stage actress who is his partner. She is the older one
of the couple.)</TE>
<TE>   Yet the stage holds professional risks as well. "For so many of
these personality actors who make it big in films, it becomes just
too scary to go back on stage," says Greg Hersov, artistic director
of Manchester's Royal Exchange Theater. "Fiennes has a robust stage
career, but he keeps seeking out these huge roles that are
tremendously testing."</TE>
<TE>   That uncertainty seems to be on Fiennes' mind as he was preparing
for "The Talking Cure's" opening. After one rehearsal, he expresses
mystification at how the quality of performances swings so wildly
from one day to the next. But his appetite for roles that touch some
strange zone of the soul remains great. After playing Jung, he'll be
back on the London stage in the spring doing Henrik Ibsen's "Brand."
Ibsen, perhaps the heaviest going of all.</TE>
<TE>   One more complicated part to master. One more crazy career move.</TE>

<HD>Fiennes reveals his method to portraying madness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Wallace</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So how does an actor get inside the fever of madness and evil to
portray it authentically on screen?</LD>
<LD>   Suspend judgment, answers Ralph Fiennes. "I'm just loath to use
these words 'evil' or 'bad,' " he says.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly in Fiennes' hands, Francis Dolarhyde, the serial killer
of "Red Dragon" becomes more than a cartoon villain.</LD>
<TE>   Of Spider, Fiennes says, "People looked at the screenplay and felt
Spider was a malevolent schizophrenic with a mother hang-up. But I
saw him as a pitiful figure, actually not realizing what he had done,
trapped in some oedipal nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   "Spider should never be a ghoul or a creepy guy," Fiennes says
forcefully. "He is frozen, alone in the world and locked in his own
head."</TE>
<TE>   The unforgettable Amon Goeth, the concentration camp commandant of
"Schindler's List," is the sort of Nazi who shoots Jewish prisoners
from his balcony for momentary peace and quiet. Can there be any
sympathy for him?</TE>
<TE>   "No, 'sympathy' is the wrong word, really," Fiennes says. "But
once you've read the script and you decide to play someone like Amon
Goeth, your job is to look at the world through their eyes. I know
he's terrible, awful, psychopathic, but you know.... "</TE>
<TE>   Fiennes slips into Goeth's voice, a moaning, complaining drawl.
"I've got to go out today and more people coming in on trains ...
aahh," he says and groans. "He's pulled into the fact they are
vermin. His head is in that place that says we just don't need these
people, they're everything that's going to screw up the country."
Fiennes returns to Goeth's voice.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah God, it's exhausting. I need a drink, I need a girlfriend, and
I need a good game of poker because I've had a long day."</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it's horrific when you're the audience," Fiennes says
in his demure English tone once again. "We look on appalled. But if
you're inside it you must have a very different reality. And in
playing the part, that's sort of the way I try to look at it."</TE>

<HD>A Growing Trail of Question Marks</HD>
<DH>Has integrity in public life been replaced by 'they all do
it'?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shouldn't we wonder, isn't there a towering figure somewhere in
American business who doesn't leave a trail of question marks behind
him?</LD>
<LD>   There are two ways to view the nomination of John W. Snow as
Treasury secretary: One, everybody does it. Or two, President Bush
and Vice President Dick Cheney want us to think everybody does.</LD>
<LD>   As chief executive of the railroad company CSX Corp., Snow sold a
big chunk of his holdings ahead of the firm's announcement about its
weakening financial condition -- news that drove down stock prices.
Bush and Cheney have faced similarly uncomfortable questions.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe everybody in the corner suite does it. Maybe the
administration wants us to think so.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence, we're told, that Snow anticipated the
downturn in his company's fortunes when he sold 120,000 shares last
August. The same is said about Bush, who sold 212,140 shares of
Harken oil company stock just weeks before the company announced a
restructuring that sent its value tumbling. Bush was then a director
at Harken. And Cheney, as CEO of Halliburton, unloaded 100,000 shares
of stock in advance of a 76% drop in the company's value.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's the way business works, or maybe we're supposed to
think so.</TE>
<TE>   Snow, of course, was paid stupendously to run his railroad --
$36.5 million in the last four years, plus a platinum parachute
reportedly worth $40 million or so. Once upon a time, we were told
that payouts like this were justified by red-hot performance. But
under Snow, CSX's return to shareholders lagged the S&amp;P 500, the New
York Stock Exchange listing of all transportation companies and even
a 10-year Treasury bill.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe everyone did it.</TE>
<TE>   I am not, as I frequently remind myself, an expert in matters of
running large and demanding corporations. And I'm also aware that
delivering potshots from this distant vantage is all too easy. As
Eric Hoffer once said, "In a trader-dominated society, the scribe is
usually kept out of the management of affairs, but is given more or
less free hand in the cultural field. By frustrating the scribe's
craving for commanding action, the trader draws upon himself the
scribe's wrath and scorn."</TE>
<TE>   But still.</TE>
<TE>   As a "performance incentive" in 1996, Snow took a $24-million loan
from CSX to buy company stock. But the stock didn't perform. It lost
value. And when the outstanding loan couldn't be covered by the value
of his shares, Snow didn't get pinched like other investors. The
company forgave him the debt, never mind incentive. Oh well, maybe
everybody did it.</TE>
<TE>   After all, under Snow's reign, CSX managed to turn a profit and
still not pay taxes for at least two of the last four years. Instead,
the company received federal millions in "rebates," which sound to me
a lot like taxpayer subsidies. All legal, of course, so far as we
know.</TE>
<TE>   As Treasury secretary, Snow would be responsible for the IRS,
which relies heavily on moral persuasion to see that everyone and
every corporation contributes a fair share to support the nation.
What kind of moral symbolism is it to hand the agency over to a man
who found ways to make money and not pay taxes?</TE>
<TE>   From Washington we hear testimonials of those who know Snow and
have worked with him over the years. They say he is a man in whom we
can believe. His deeds have shown him to be a person willing to serve
his country and the cause of industry, not just himself.</TE>
<TE>   I guess that's the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Snow held government positions before; he understands how the
system works and how it's supposed to work. He realizes how leaders
are supposed to conduct themselves. Yet he maintained a membership in
the symbolically charged men's-only Augusta National Golf Club until
he was called to service. Only then did he resign. What that says,
loud and clear, is that his personal principles are distinct from
what the nation expects, and he knows it.</TE>
<TE>   Haven't we learned by now that just because something is legal,
it's not always right?</TE>
<TE>   Rewards that reflect achievement, a willingness to share risk,
integrity in our personal choices, life by example -- we used to call
these "core values."</TE>
<TE>   John Snow's nomination tells us that this is all sucker talk for
salary workers, not the way of corporate aristocrats.</TE>
<TE>   Because they all do it, right?</TE>

<HD>Cuba's on a Back Burner and So Is Otto Reich</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Frank del Olmo</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can make a good argument that President Bush owes more to Cuban
Americans than to almost any other bloc of U.S. voters. But you
surely couldn't tell from the shabby way one of their most outspoken
leaders is being treated in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   I refer to Otto J. Reich, the controversial former assistant
secretary of State for Western Hemisphere affairs. He's been left
twisting in the wind -- and it couldn't happen to a nicer guy --
since well before Thanksgiving, when he was abruptly ousted as this
country's chief diplomat for Latin America.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's capital is a town where the perks and symbols of
power mean a lot. So imagine how Reich must have felt Nov. 22 when he
returned from an official trip to Brazil to find that his nameplate
and picture had been removed from the walls of the State Department.
That's also when Reich learned his office had been moved from the
sixth floor to the first floor.</LD>
<TE>   When Bush administration spokesmen hastily explained that Reich's
new job would be as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's "special
envoy" to Latin America, no one could explain precisely what his
duties would be. And in the last two weeks, Powell has made major
trips south of the border, to Mexico and Colombia. His new special
envoy was not invited. I guess Reich can't take a hint.</TE>
<TE>   But his political supporters in Congress can. That's why U.S.
Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Cuban American
Republicans from south Florida, have been pressuring the White House
to find another job for Reich, and fast.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, as veterans of Washington politics they should have
seen Reich's downfall coming. To begin with, his yearlong tenure at
the State Department's top level was temporary. Because Senate
Democrats made it clear they did not consider Reich qualified for his
post and would not vote to confirm his appointment, Bush gave the
Cuban American what is called a "recess appointment," meaning it was
valid until the most recent Congress adjourned.</TE>
<TE>   Full of his characteristic hubris, Reich assumed that his
appointment would become permanent when Republicans won back control
of the Senate in November. But then Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), a
moderate who is likely to replace the retiring North Carolina
conservative Jesse Helms as senior Republican on the Foreign
Relations Committee, said he would prefer another candidate for the
Latin America post.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, White House sources told me that Reich would soon be
named the president's special envoy to Latin America. That may save
some face for Reich, but it remains to be seen whether it will repair
Bush's standing with those Cuban exiles who consider the brash former
lobbyist a hero in the struggle to oust Fidel Castro.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some of us pointed out all along that Reich's
anti-Castro obsession was precisely what made him so ill suited for a
job dealing with the entire Western Hemisphere. With Venezuela
teetering on the brink of political chaos, with Brazil, Peru and
Ecuador having recently elected populist presidents who are dubious
about U.S.-backed economic liberalization and with Mexico still
pressing for an immigration deal, we need an envoy who can see
farther than Havana.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the small matter of the Cuban exile terrorist
Orlando Bosch, whom Reich tried to help get a U.S. visa in 1987 when
Reich was ambassador to Venezuela. Bosch eventually sneaked into this
country on his own and still lives near Miami. The Bush people don't
like to talk about him much -- and not just because it looks bad to
have a convicted terrorist living openly in Florida's sunshine even
as the U.S. wages war on terrorism elsewhere. It's that the president
who in 1989 allowed Bosch to stay in this country on indefinite
parole is the current president's father. And among the Floridians
who urged the senior Bush to let Bosch stay in that state was Jeb
Bush, then a political consultant and now the state's governor.</TE>
<TE>   That brings me to what Reich's temporary tenure at the State
Department was really all about: domestic politics. Having an avid
anti-Castro activist in a highly visible post helped ensure Cuban
American support for Jeb Bush in his recent successful gubernatorial
reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Reich's temporary appointment was also reward for the Cuban
American votes that were pivotal in the 2000 presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   So while Reich's predicament is humiliating for now, expect to
hear from him again. After all, Florida is likely to be an important
state in the 2004 presidential election too.</TE>

<HD>Economic Jump-Start Won't Do</HD>
<DH>Only major tax cuts will boost profit and jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James K. Glassman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that President Bush has named his new economic team, he's
expected to turn his attention to a stimulus package. I hope not.
Growth, yes. Stimulus, no.</LD>
<LD>   "Stimulus" implies a goose to the economy -- or, more politely,
the quick boost you get when you jump-start a dead battery. But this
economy doesn't need a jump-start. While it's not reaching its
potential, it's far from dead, or even asleep. Over the last 12
months, gross domestic product, or the output of all goods and
services, has grown 3.2% -- actually better than the post-World War
II average. Unemployment, at 6%, is half a point below the post-1970
average. Inflation is tame, interest rates are low, layoffs are
easing and personal incomes and consumer confidence are rising.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, there are problems -- mainly a lack of investment by
businesses in plant and equipment and a slump in corporate profits,
conditions that in turn threaten the jobs of millions of Americans.</LD>
<TE>   But stimulus wouldn't help much. The theory of a stimulus package
is to put cash in the hands of consumers, who would go out and spend,
spend, spend -- which would encourage businesses to invest, invest,
invest. The package would focus on demand-side tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   There are different approaches, but they all amount to sending out
rebate checks to Americans, as the government did in 2001, to
encourage them to buy things.</TE>
<TE>   But if the economy is truly sick, people will be so scared (and
prudent) that they will stash the extra cash in the bank or use it to
pay off debt, rather than buy a new dishwasher.</TE>
<TE>   If the economy isn't so sick, why bother with rebates that simply
increase the federal deficit? If businesses believe their sales are
rising today because of an emergency one-time tax rebate, why would
they want to invest in new plants for next year?</TE>
<TE>   What we need are serious structural changes to the tax code that
will promote the kind of economic growth that helps all Americans.
The key is private investment -- putting money into technology and
other enduring assets that will increase entrepreneurship, employment
and prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the politics of a growth package aren't easy
because some of the changes have to focus on business taxes and on
relief in the upper, as well as the middle and lower, brackets.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there's a happy precedent. Forty years ago, the U.S. was in
the doldrums for similar reasons: national security threats (the
Cuban missile crisis) and a big stock market decline.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 14, 1962, President John F. Kennedy, a Massachusetts
Democrat, urged Congress to "reduce the burden on private income and
the deterrents to private initiative which are imposed by our present
tax system."</TE>
<TE>   He asked for "an across-the-board, top-to-bottom cut in personal
and corporate taxes" because the system "exerts too heavy a drag on
growth, siphons out of the economy too large a share of personal and
business purchasing power, [and] reduces the financial incentives for
personal effort, investment and risk-taking."</TE>
<TE>   Wow. I couldn't have said it better myself. In the end, Congress
cut corporate taxes and reduced rates in the top personal bracket by
21 percentage points, igniting the boom of the 1960s -- a tide that,
in Kennedy's phrase, lifted all boats. The budget deficit narrowed
and eventually turned to surplus in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Powerful Kennedy-style tax cuts, not stimulus, are the right
recipe today as well.</TE>
<TE>   First, Congress has to increase certainty by making permanent the
phaseout in death taxes and the rate cuts enacted last year.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the tax code needs to be simplified by ending the
alternative minimum tax, killing special deductions and exemptions
and further leveling rates.</TE>
<TE>   Third, business taxes -- which, as economists know, are mainly
passed on to consumers -- need serious reform. Three ideas: Lower
rates sharply, allow companies to treat purchases of new machines as
expenses (writing them off immediately, rather than over many years)
and let corporations deduct their dividend payouts.</TE>
<TE>   A true growth package, which must also constrain out-of-control
lawsuits and trim regulations that deter risk-taking, is critical in
this dangerous age.</TE>
<TE>   As President Kennedy said in 1962: "So long as our national
security needs keep rising, an economy hampered by restrictive tax
rates will never produce enough jobs or enough profits."</TE>

<HD>Why Can't Jeanie Buss Get the Respect She Deserves?</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In spite of her being an "Heiress Apparent" ("Buss--The Next
Generation," by Steve Springer, Nov. 24), Jeanie Buss apparently
deserves no more respect from The Times than if it were a supermarket
tabloid and she were a woman of the '50s who had somehow stepped out
of her expected role as a chattel wife. How flattering that she is
"best known for being Jerry's daughter, a former Playboy model and
girlfriend of Laker coach Phil Jackson."</LD>
<LD>   On the front page of The Times on the same day was a story on
Hindu widows who are not educated, empowered, cared for or cared
about. How nice that our poor little rich girl, intelligent enough to
be "poised to become a powerhouse in the NBA," will not have to face
being destitute in her unmarried state like her Indian sisters.
Nevertheless, it seems that she does not deserve much more respect
from Springer than a Third World culture gives [its] widows.
Apparently there is only interest in culling readership at the
expense of the dignity of the woman who had the courtesy to give
Springer an interview.</LD>

<LD>The gift guide for holiday shopping ("Home for the Holidays," Nov.
24) may have heralded the start of the Christmas season in a uniquely
Southern California way. Its emphasis on retro-inspired objects
reminds us how influential the 1960s still are in shaping Los
Angeles. However, the inclusion of the aluminum Christmas tree also
is a reminder that not all of what was produced in the '60s was
worthwhile or even worth preserving. Some of your readers may recall
that the original trees were illuminated with a rotating color wheel
lamp that caused the tree to change from one garish hue to another in
a matter of seconds. It is one artifact better left in storage.</LD>

<HD>More Conscious Thoughts on Crick</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your story on Francis H.C. Crick and his work in yet another
challenging area of science was thought-provoking ("Francis Crick's
Quest," by Michael A. Hiltzik, Nov. 17). He has certainly contributed
much to the field of science over the years. It's great that he still
has so much passion for his work. Having worked in the field of
science (microbiology and biochemistry), I'm cheering for him and his
team.</LD>
<LD>   However, one consideration is that after all of the evidence has
been established on consciousness, we still might be surprised to
find a metaphysical or spiritual dimension interwoven into the
physical aspect. The spiritual definition might be what completes the
definition of consciousness. As Crick suggests, consciousness is
different and complex: "There are lots of bits of business to
explain."</LD>
<LD>   George Tharrington</LD>
<TE>   Yorba Linda</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am disappointed that you would state that consciousness
"separates humankind from animals and machines" as if this were an
established scientific fact. The lie that nonhuman animals are mere
automatons that act only from instinct has been promulgated for
thousands of years. In fact, humans are animals, and other highly
evolved animals think, learn and have likes, dislikes and friends.
They feel affection, frustration, boredom, loneliness, annoyance,
fear and enjoyment. They are persons in that they have personalities.
They love, suffer and mourn.</TE>
<TE>   I hope that more and more people will take off their blinders and
realize that animals are much more like us than society has been
willing to admit. Consciousness doesn't separate humans from animals;
it links us. When sincere and compassionate people face this truth,
we make the necessary adjustments in our lives. Our consciences allow
us to do no less.</TE>

<HD>West Nile Virus Taxing Limits of Federal Lab</HD>
<DH>The CDC's Colorado facility has seen its workload swell
because of the fatal disease that is spreading nationwide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Katherine Vogt</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>FORT COLLINS, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Giant beakers filled with blood clutter countertops and extra
refrigerators cramp the hallways at the federal government's main
research center for West Nile virus.</LD>
<LD>   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists have had to
sharply shift the focus of their work toward the sometimes fatal
disease that is spreading across most of the country.</LD>
<LD>   The individual labs within the white building are packed with
beakers of blood and other animal specimens that may carry the virus.</LD>
<TE>   Former offices have been relocated to temporary structures outside
to make room for extra lab space.</TE>
<TE>   Lab officials say their workload increased dramatically after a
few dozen cases of West Nile virus appeared in the U.S. in 1999. This
year, more than 3,500 human cases of the mosquito-borne illness have
been confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   "Our workload has been a lot, and there is no sign that it is
going to let up," said John T. Roehrig, chief of the arbovirus
diseases branch of the CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Infectious
Diseases.</TE>
<TE>   West Nile previously received the same attention as countless
diseases affecting the global community. Now, as the CDC's primary
West Nile virus research facility, up to 90% of the lab's time and
resources are devoted to the disease.</TE>
<TE>   About 150 people work at the lab.</TE>
<TE>   The emphasis on West Nile comes while the lab also tries to
address its responsibility for research on plague and tularemia, both
highly secured agents with potential for use in bioterrorism.</TE>
<TE>   And with an increased concern about bioterrorism since the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks, the lab has made a series of security changes,
including the installation of a giant barbed-wire fence around its
perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   Roehrig acknowledged that other research projects have been put on
the back burner to make room for West Nile studies.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to maintain expertise and credibility for all the diseases
we're responsible for. But where we've had the biggest effect is in
our field teams, who are now responding to West Nile," Roehrig said.</TE>
<TE>   He said lab scientists are trying to develop better diagnostic
testing for West Nile virus. One model, which detects genetic
material from the virus, is being used in scientific investigations
and may one day be used to screen donated blood for West Nile virus.</TE>
<TE>   Other research projects include new vaccines for horses and
possibly birds, and studies of how the virus may be transmitted
between humans through breast milk, blood transfusions and organ
donations.</TE>
<TE>   Roehrig said drug companies are investigating a possible human
West Nile vaccine, which he expects to see within a couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   In the beginning, the Fort Collins lab was responsible for
confirming all human cases of West Nile virus. Since then, lab
workers have trained state and local agencies to do their own testing
when possible.</TE>
<TE>   One of the main lessons learned from the arrival of West Nile was
that state and local health agencies were far less prepared for an
infectious disease outbreak than they should have been, said Duane J.
Gubler, director of the CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Infectious
Diseases.</TE>
<TE>   He said West Nile is a wake-up call to a public health system that
has grown complacent about vector-borne infectious diseases since the
advent of powerful new drugs and antibiotics over the last few
decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Along with that complacency, we allowed the public health
infrastructure to deteriorate," Gubler said.</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: the aging, cramped lab in Fort Collins.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1967 to help the CDC deal with arboviral encephalitis in
the western United States, the lab soon took over research duties for
plague, Dengue fever, Lyme disease and other zoonotic bacterial
infections.</TE>
<TE>   As duties grew, the lab became more crowded. By 1998, some offices
were moved to temporary structures outside of the main building to
make room for more lab space.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with West Nile virus making the lab busier than ever, Roehrig
said the labs are sometimes so crowded that scientists literally bump
into one another.</TE>
<TE>   Gubler said the electrical wiring, heating and cooling systems and
other parts of the lab infrastructure are antiquated and desperately
need to be replaced.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, scientists will try to learn from the changes the lab
has undergone in the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the main lessons we've taken home from this experience is
that we need to keep an open mind and expect the unexpected," Gubler
said.</TE>

<HD>Gardens Top It Off in Portland</HD>
<DH>New regulations encourage 'ecoroofs' instead of traditional
tar and shingles. Rooftop greenery reduces energy costs and storm
runoff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gillian Flaccus</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>When Chris Moehling wants to show off the new garden at the youth
hostel he manages, he steps out a second-story bedroom window onto a
roof blooming with plants.</LD>
<LD>   The 650-square-foot garden of scrubby succulents and yellow
marigolds grows right out of the roof, above the busy street, and is
visible to the hundreds of shoppers and motorists who pass below.</LD>
<LD>   "We get people walking in from the street asking all kinds of
questions," Moehling said. "This is one of the more visible streets
in town. People really get a kick out of it."</LD>
<TE>   The hostel's plantings are the latest in a string of green spaces
flourishing on Portland's roofs in place of traditional shingles and
tar -- and the trend is no coincidence.</TE>
<TE>   The city has emerged as an international leader in the budding
"ecoroof" movement. Portland has boosted its reputation by enacting
regulations that offer breaks to developers who install green roofs
and by officials who aggressively promote rooftop planting.</TE>
<TE>   Living roofs, long common in Germany, Holland and Switzerland, can
reduce runoff after rainstorms by as much as 90%, slash a building's
energy costs by 10%, and reduce summer temperatures on scorching city
rooftops by about 70 degrees, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   They also delay the runoff after a major storm by several hours,
preventing flooding and sewage problems that occur when a storm-water
system overflows.</TE>
<TE>   And the gardens filter pollutants and heavy metals from rainwater
and cool the excess water before it enters streams and threatens
sensitive aquatic species, such as salmon in the Pacific Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   "Once a person sees all the things that an ecoroof can do, it's
almost dumb not to plant them," said Tom Liptan, an environmental
specialist for the city. "I expect we'll see a lot more."</TE>
<TE>   Portland isn't the only city to plant gardens on its skyline.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago, Toronto and Seattle have grown gardens on their city
halls and courthouses, and Atlanta plans to follow suit. Ford Motor
Co. will finish a 10.6-acre living roof on its truck plant in
Dearborn, Mich., next year, and county buildings in Anne Arundel
County, Md. have recently sprouted grassy tops.</TE>
<TE>   What sets Portland apart, experts say, is the city's financial
commitment to ecoroofs in the form of tax breaks, grants and building
codes, and the range of buildings -- both public and private -- that
sport rooftop gardens.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at it on the surface, offering economic incentives
makes a lot of sense," said David Beattie, director of the Center for
Green Roof Research at Pennsylvania State University.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to drag people to the table, so having economic
incentives such as you have in Portland is the way to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Portland took the lead in the tiny, but growing, green roof
movement nearly two years ago when it approved a regulation that
allows developers to expand their building plans if they include an
ecoroof. Experts say Portland is the only city in North America to
offer such an incentive; it also waives certain code requirements for
those with green roofs.</TE>
<TE>   In the future, Portland may create zoning that encourages ecoroofs
or offer significant discounts on storm-water fees for people who
cultivate their rooftops, said Dean Marriott, Portland's director of
environmental services.</TE>
<TE>   "I've just been talking this up to anyone who will listen," he
said. "We're trying to get public and private examples of ecoroofs in
the community, and we're trying to use all the incentives that we can
think of."</TE>
<TE>   Portland hopes that green roofs will help end the severe and
recurring sewage overflows that pour into the Columbia and Willamette
rivers after nearly every heavy rainstorm by reducing the amount of
water runoff. The runoff floods the system, forcing raw sewage into
nearby rivers.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal mandate, the city must correct the problem by 2011.
It's in the middle of a $1-billion project to install larger
underground pipes, said Liptan, city environmental specialist.</TE>
<TE>   Portland has made government incentives for green roofs a priority
because of the technology's cost. Green roofs cost about two times
more than regular roofs to install -- between $10 and $15 per square
foot -- and require extensive research and planning.</TE>
<TE>   Financial support from the government is key to persuading
companies and individuals to install ecoroofs, said Ireen Wieditz,
director of the Toronto-based Green Roofs for Healthy Cities.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always a lot of interest, but I think it's still new to a
lot of people," she said. "People seem to love the idea and are
really embracing it, but we just need the government to support it."</TE>
<TE>   Faced with crowding, runoff and pollution problems, some German
cities require new flat roofs to be green roofs, while others require
residents to pay taxes based on the percentage of paved surface they
own.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, one out of seven German roofs are green; in some
cities, one-fourth of buildings have ecoroofs, said Beattie, the Penn
State professor.</TE>
<TE>   "Man has an amazing capacity to dirty his own nest and the Germans
have done it before we did," he said. "They simply faced the problem
before we did."</TE>
<TE>   Liptan is encouraged by recent interest in ecoroofs, however, and
said he has fielded nearly two dozen serious phone calls in recent
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   At least five major city developments are considering ecoroofs,
and a new nonprofit called "Ecoroofs Everywhere" is working with the
city to spur interest in the technology among homeowners and small
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   To Greg Haines, the man who started Ecoroofs Everywhere, that's
fitting news.</TE>
<TE>   "I think of Portland as the No. 1 ecoroof city because storm water
is such a big deal here and salmon are so huge and the Willamette
River runs right through the city," he said. "When I think of
Portland, I think of the bridges and the river and the community."</TE>

<LD>Anthony Shay, founding artistic director of the L.A.-based Avaz
International Dance Theatre, is now making his mark as a writer. He's
just won a prize for one book and has received a sizable grant to
write another.</LD>
<LD>   Shay won the 2003 Congress on Research in Dance Award for his
"Choreographic Politics: State Folk Dance Companies" (Wesleyan
Press). He has also received a $40,000 National Endowment for the
Humanities grant to write about immigrant dance culture in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   "Choreographic Politics," Shay says, deals with "how national
dance companies like the Moiseyev Dance Company and Amalia
Hernandez's Ballet Folklorico de Mexico are created and developed
within a social ethnic and gendered environment and how these then
purport to represent their nation-state. Although viewers think
they're looking at colorful dance performances, in fact these
companies very carefully embed political and ethnic messages within
their performances."</LD>
<TE>   The book took Shay about two years to write. He will receive his
award at a CORD conference in August. He expects to finish his next
book, with the NEH grant, by the end of 2003.</TE>

<LD>   The Gang will tour "The Guys," Anne Nelson's staged reading about
the aftermath of Sept. 11, to universities in Mississippi and Georgia
and to the Annenberg Center in Philadelphia next spring and to
several Midwestern venues next fall.</LD>
<LD>   Part of the motivation is to pay actors a decent wage.
Participating Gang actors -- V.J. Foster, Cynthia Ettinger, Brent
Hinkley and Kate Mulligan -- will get $500 a week plus expenses, paid
for by the presenters. This is in stark contrast with the Gang's
usual productions, which, under Actors' Equity's rules, pay each
actor no more than $15 a week. The Gang's current production of "The
Guys" pays celebrities $270 a week.</LD>

<LD>Art Basel Miami Beach -- America's version of Art Basel, the world's
most prestigious marketplace for international modern and
contemporary art -- wrapped up its debut last Sunday with attendance
of 30,000 and a lot of happy dealers.</LD>
<LD>   "We sold everything but the Scotch tape," said Tim Blum of Blum &amp;
Poe Gallery in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Even participants who were less euphoric said they made enough
sales and contacts to return next year.</LD>
<TE>   Looky-loos wandered through the booths during the four-day event
at the Miami Beach Convention Center, but so did serious collectors,
museum directors and leading curators and art consultants. The crowd
included collector groups from nearly 50 museums, including Los
Angeles' Museum of Contemporary Art, Sao Paulo's Museum of Modern
Art, Madrid's Contemporary Art Museum and New York's Museum of Modern
Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and
Metropolitan Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   With all those fancy folks in town, there were some odd sightings
on the periphery of the fair.</TE>
<TE>   Designer Karl Lagerfeld, who showed his fashion-inspired
photographs at Gmurzynska Gallery's booth and flaunted his glitzy
dresses at a hot-ticket program, plopped down at a tacky sidewalk
cafe. With his white hair pulled back in a ponytail and his neck
encased in an impossibly high, starched collar, he looked like a
peacock in a chicken coop.</TE>

<PH>Five Years of the Getty</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>A nest still in fine feather</HD>
<DH>The endowment fell $1.7 billion in the last two years, but
not to worry: There's $4.4 billion left -- and always fund-raisers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Boehm</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Visit the Getty Center, and you can get a sense of what its fiscal
overseers have experienced in five years of running it: a steep ride
up and a steep ride down, all for the sake of an edifying encounter
with art.</LD>
<LD>   The tram ride to and from the hilltop museum and research complex
in Brentwood is a mile-and-a-half round trip and doesn't cost a cent.
But the art institution's up-and-down financial journey can be
tallied in billions gained, lost and spent.</LD>
<LD>   The market boom of the late '90s pushed the Getty's endowment to
its summit, $6.1 billion, during the summer of 2000. Since then, the
market slide of the new century has shaken $1.7 billion out of one of
the nation's richest cultural piggy banks, leaving it at $4.4 billion
-- or just about where it stood when the Getty Center opened in
December 1997.</LD>
<TE>   That's OK with Barry Munitz, president of the J. Paul Getty Trust,
which funds and operates the Getty Center.</TE>
<TE>   Suppose a seer had appeared to him on Jan. 5, 1998, his first day
on the job, and proposed a deal: You can spend an average of $284
million per year for the next five years -- enough to keep up the
place, meet payrolls for a staff of about 1,300, pay off the
construction debt, add to the art collection and conduct high-level
academic research and art preservation projects. You'll be able to
share it all free of charge with 7.4 million visitors -- and you'll
still be sitting on a $4-billion-plus pile when the time is up.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have signed that piece of paper in the morning," Munitz
says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite enviable," says Ed Able, director of the American
Assn. of Museums. "These are very, very stressful times for museums
because all revenue sources have been undermined simultaneously,"
leading in some cases to staff cutting and the closing of galleries.
Meanwhile, the Getty Center sits in relative fiscal serenity atop its
hill and its mountain of cash.</TE>
<TE>   "The stability of their funding," says Able, "means they don't
have to generate the kinds of outside income that other museums must
generate."</TE>
<TE>   Despite that nice cushion, the Getty Trust faces the same economic
uncertainties as every other investor, and some major expenses loom.
The long-delayed renovation project at the Getty Villa in Pacific
Palisades is estimated to cost $250 million. (See accompanying box.)
If it goes forward, the plan is to borrow that sum and pay it down
long term, at interest rates projected at 2% or less. But when the
villa reopens -- two years from now under the current timetable --
the operating expense, which Munitz estimates at $30 million a year,
will be immediate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our main financial challenge," he says.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a $50-million painting in the pipeline -- the Getty
Trust having agreed to pay the British owner of Raphael's "Madonna of
the Pinks" that sum, unless some buyer in the U.K. can match it under
a government program designed to keep historic artworks on British
soil. The Getty won't divulge what it spends on art acquisition, but
Munitz says it steadily has exceeded the $30.6-million annual average
that New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art reported in public
financial statements for the three fiscal years from 1999 to 2001.
Private collectors, rather than other museums, are the Getty's most
formidable bidding rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's always telling me, 'Boy, it's great to be able to get
anything you want,' " Munitz says. "Most of the things we've gone
after lately we haven't gotten. We stay disciplined, and we just
won't go any higher than what we think the right price is. Private
collectors don't necessarily work that way. They have the money, they
like something, and they don't have to [worry about] paying the
electric bill for the tram."</TE>
<TE>   The Getty's self-set ceiling for all its annual spending is 5% of
its endowment's average value over the previous three years. The
investment strategy calls for betting about 60% to 65% of the
endowment on stocks and an additional 5% to 10% on "alternative
investments" such as private equities and venture capital
opportunities. About 30% stays in conservative fixed-income
securities such as government and corporate bonds and federally
insured mortgage pools. Munitz says the Getty Trust has a series of
indexes and benchmarks it uses to rate how its investments are
performing. Overall, he said, during the downturn the trust's returns
have bettered those standards by about 1.5%.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm comfortable, but not pleased, with how well we're doing
vis-a-vis the benchmarks. I think we can do better," he says. To that
end, he says, the Getty Trust is hiring an in-house finance expert
whose job will be strictly to track the portfolio and work with the
17 outside investment professionals who manage the endowment. Until
now, two Getty finance executives had divided their attention between
investments and other fiscal chores such as budgeting and operating
expenditures.Peter Frumkin, a Harvard professor who studies nonprofit
organizations, says the Getty Trust's investment strategy is "a
little bit more aggressive" than the 60-40 split between stocks and
fixed-income investments he says is typical for major institutional
investors such as universities, hospitals and foundations, "but well
within the normal parameters."</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-'90s the Getty briefly stepped outside those parameters
and took a $400-million hit when it bet that the market would go
down. Instead the market went up. At the time, Getty officials said
they wouldn't repeat that sort of unorthodox maneuver.</TE>
<TE>   Among charitable foundations, the Getty Trust's assets rank fifth
nationally, according to a survey by the Foundation Center, a New
York-based research organization. The Getty endowment's rise during
the good times -- and the 27.6% dip it has taken during the two most
recent years of market declines -- jibe with the experience of other
large foundations, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The Getty's endowment declines are "probably within the middle of
the bell curve," says Dorothy Ridings, president of the Council on
Foundations, a national service organization based in Washington,
D.C.</TE>
<TE>   The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, which invested mainly in
Hewlett-Packard stock, saw its endowment suffer a two-year drop from
$15 billion to $3.8 billion. The Lilly Endowment, invested wholly in
Eli Lilly and Co. drug stock, declined in two years from $15.6
billion to $10.2 billion. The Ford Foundation, which pursues a
broad-based investment strategy, saw its investment assets shrink
from $14.5 billion to $8.3 billion over a similar span, a 37%
decline. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the nation's largest,
has dropped $1 billion in value during 2002, standing at $23.9
billion as of Oct. 31. As with the Getty Trust, those declines are
not purely from market losses, but also reflect ongoing philanthropic
spending.</TE>
<TE>   Munitz has asked Getty department heads to propose ways to
economize for the coming fiscal year. Still, he says, barring a
prolonged U.S. economic decline , "I would be amazed if there was
anything dramatic" that the Getty would cut, such as slashing staff
and programming. If the endowment suffers further investment losses,
the Getty has the built-in flexibility to cope through difficult
times, Munitz says. It can buy less art, or it can cut back on its
relatively modest grant-making program, which has risen from $10.6
million to $19.2 million annually over the past five years.</TE>
<TE>   But sitting still atop the pile would be a mistake, Munitz says.
Four years ago, he and other trust officials said publicly that it
would be prudent for the Getty Trust to start seeking donations
rather than just clipping coupons on the endowment. That notion
raised protests from some other cultural organizations. If anything,
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's director, Andrea L. Rich, said
at the time, the Getty should be sharing more of its considerable
wealth instead of trying to hit up a limited pool of arts donors for
even more.</TE>
<TE>   Munitz thinks the market's downturn, and the two-year shrinkage of
the pile, vindicates what he said back then, and that's why the Getty
Trust is moving ahead with fund-raising now. According to its
financial reports, the trust took in only $8.7 million in
contributions -- much of it the valuation of donated art -- during
the five fiscal years ending last summer.</TE>
<TE>   But now, Munitz says, prospective board members are being scouted
for, among other attributes, their ability to make or generate
donations. The Getty also has established two councils for donors who
want to support the villa project and the center's painting
conservation program. So far, 41 have signed up, to the tune of
$5,000 a year each, and similar support groups for other operations
are planned.</TE>
<TE>   A year and a half ago the Getty hired a fund-raising specialist to
pursue corporate giving, Munitz said, and another development hire is
in the pipeline. Aims include generating more gifts of art and cash,
securing sponsorships for exhibitions and educational programs,
finding donors who would like their names emblazoned on facilities in
exchange for large sums, and renting out the hilltop for corporate
functions.</TE>
<TE>   Fears that the Getty will siphon off donations that otherwise
would go to needier institutions "make no sense," Munitz said. "It's
not a zero-sum game. It's all boats rising."</TE>
<TE>   LACMA's Rich had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very bizarre, but for years people have come to us wanting
to give money, and we've said no," Munitz says. "We're going to stop
saying no. And people will give us art, and they will give us money,
given our strength."</TE>

<LD>In jazz, recordings from the past never really disappear. The music
of Charlie Parker is as alive today as it was on the day it was
created. And the gift-giving season inevitably spurs interest in the
latest packages of great performances. This year some particularly
attractive choices are available, with many of the art's key figures
represented in boxed sets:</LD>
<LD>   Essential</LD>
<LD>   Charlie Christian's "The Genius of the Electric Guitar" (Columbia
Legacy), four CDs. Electric guitar -- for jazz, pop and beyond --
begins with Christian. His brief life (he died in 1942 at the age of
25) produced a brilliant collection of recordings, most of them
included here.</LD>
<TE>   John Coltrane's "Legacy" (Impulse!), four CDs. Anything by
Coltrane is worth having, but this set is particularly valuable. His
son Ravi Coltrane has gathered recordings from various companies into
a comprehensive overview of the great saxophonist's extraordinary
body of work.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Evans Trio's "Consecration: The Final Recordings, Part 2.
Live at Keystone Korner, Sept. 1980" (Milestone), eight CDs. Few of
Evans' efforts are more touching than these performances, produced
within days of his death in September 1980, and a remarkable
expression of a musical mind in its final, fullest blossoming.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Parker's "The Complete Savoy and Dial Master Takes" (Savoy
Jazz), three CDs. A more manageable version of an earlier eight-CD
set that included extensive alternate takes. Vital to any jazz
collection, it displays Parker at his seminal best, defining bebop on
the spot in virtually every classic number.</TE>
<TE>   For collectors</TE>
<TE>   Miles Davis' "The Complete Miles Davis at Montreux 1973-1991"
(Columbia Legacy), 20 CDs. Here's an opportunity for dedicated
Davis-ites to explore the evolution of his music over two eventful
decades -- the '70s and '80s. Since many of the programs employed the
same tunes, there is also the opportunity to hear the changes in his
musical thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Smith's "The Complete Roost Johnny Smith Small Group
Sessions" (Mosaic), eight CDs. Guitarist Smith's brief arc of jazz
popularity centered on the 1952 session with Stan Getz that produced
"Moonlight in Vermont." But his richly harmonic style was present in
numerous other settings, almost all little-known. Guitarists in
particular will find much of value in Smith's highly personal style.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Vaughan's "The Complete Roulette Sarah Vaughan Studio
Sessions" (Mosaic), eight CDs. Vaughan at the peak of her vocal
powers when she made a series of recordings for Roulette ranging from
pop-oriented outings to sets with the Count Basie Band. Recommended
for Vaughan fans willing to sift through the chaff to find the
occasional glorious moments. (Mosaic albums are available solely
through Mosaic Records, 35 Melrose Place, Stamford, CT 06902; [203]
327-7111).</TE>
<TE>   Also available</TE>
<TE>   Beegie Adair's "Centennial Composers Collection" (Green Hill), six
CDs. The pianist would be far better known if she worked in a jazz
town. In this intriguing set, she applies her elegant, lightly
swinging readings to the music of George Gershwin, Irving Berlin,
Jerome Kern, Richard Rodgers, Duke Ellington and Hoagy Carmichael.</TE>
<TE>   Herbie Hancock's "The Herbie Hancock Box" (Columbia Legacy), four
CDs. The Lucite box surrounding this collection of Hancock recordings
dating from the mid-'70s to the early '90s is the most
user-unfriendly packaging in recent memory. The always fascinating
music, from the acoustic VSOP tracks to electric efforts from albums
such as "Headhunters" and "Future Shock," deserves more suitable
presentation.</TE>

<LD>"It's hard to believe that 25 years have passed since his untimely
death in 1977," RCA Records declares on the back of its latest Elvis
Presley retrospective.</LD>
<LD>   What's really hard to believe is that the label still has 100
unreleased Elvis recordings worth hearing after all these years of
repackages -- and sure enough, it doesn't. The Presley boxed set
"Today, Tomorrow &amp; Forever" is woefully pedestrian.</LD>
<LD>   Pop fans should approach all boxed sets warily. These multi-disc
packages may look as if they were designed with loving care, but the
motivation is usually just profit. Often, single-disc greatest-hits
packages are all you need. Here's a holiday gift guide to this year's
sets. The albums are rated "essential" (it belongs in a comprehensive
pop library), "for collectors" (a quality set, but more of an
artist's work than casual fans need) and "also available" (routine or
less).</LD>
<TE>   Essential</TE>
<TE>   The Band's "The Last Waltz" (Warner/Rhino). The incomparable Band
said farewell to the road in a landmark 1976 concert in San Francisco
that featured such guests as Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Van Morrison and
Eric Clapton. Martin Scorsese's concert film (also titled "The Last
Waltz" and available on DVD) is a must, and this four-disc set
supplements the film's music with 24 extra numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Cooke with the Soul Stirrers' "The Complete Specialty
Recordings" (Specialty). One of the half-dozen greatest soul singers
ever, Cooke spent six years with the Soul Stirrers gospel group
before turning to secular music. This marvelous three-disc set
includes 20 minutes of a performance at the Shrine Auditorium in Los
Angeles in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   Fats Domino's "Walking to New Orleans" (Imperial/Capitol). This
New Orleans singer-pianist didn't have the rebellion and flash of
such other '50s rockers as Presley or Little Richard, but his records
had a wonderfully engaging, sing-along charm. Four discs.</TE>
<TE>   Various artists' "Sun Records 50th Anniversary Box" (Varese
Sarabande). Sam Phillips' Sun Records was by many standards the
creative center of early rock 'n' roll -- the place where the blues
and country music truly met. The 75 selections on these three discs
go beyond the big stars (including Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and
Little Junior Parker) to showcase some of the label's other valuable
contributors. The set doesn't include anything by Presley, however,
because RCA took control of all his Sun recordings when it bought his
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Various artists' "When the Sun Goes Down: The Secret History of
Rock and Roll" (RCA). Beware of musical salutes drawn from a single
label. But RCA Victor and its subsidiary, Bluebird, were valuable
showcases for blues in the '20s, '30s and '40s. Among the artists
represented in the four discs: Arthur "Big Boy" Crudup, Blind Willie
McTell and Sonny Boy Williamson. Crudup's "That's All Right,"
included here, was the song Presley recorded for his first Sun
single.</TE>
<TE>   For collectors</TE>
<TE>   Bjork's "Family Tree" (Elektra). This gifted and disarming
singer-songwriter is among the most imaginative figures in all of
pop, and this set is typical of Bjork's eccentric approach. It's one
greatest-hits disc plus five mini, 3-inch discs of new, rare and
unreleased material.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Buckley's "The Grace EPs" (Columbia/Legacy). Here's a
customized package for fans who already have the folk-based
singer-songwriter's haunting 1994 debut album, "Grace," and his
equally striking 1997 posthumous album, "Sketches for My Sweetheart
the Drunk." It contains five EPs that were released internationally.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Sinatra's "Frank Sinatra in Hollywood" (Reprise/Turner).
Hollywood here means movies, not the city in which Sinatra recorded
those great Capitol albums. You'll find much to enjoy and much to
skip over in this six-disc package. It's a historical treasure trove,
but Sinatra's lavish Capitol, Reprise and Columbia studio collections
are better entry points.</TE>
<TE>   Rod Stewart's "Reason to Believe: The Complete Mercury Studio
Recordings" (Mercury/Chronicles) The best material in this three-disc
package, not his later Warner Bros. offerings, is the reason Stewart
is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He sings with a genuine
sensitivity and passion, though his intensity and focus begin to
drift on the third disc.</TE>
<TE>   Also available</TE>
<TE>   The Cranberries' "Treasure Box -- The Complete Sessions 1991-1999"
(Island). This Irish group's debut album, "Everybody Else Is Doing
It, So Why Can't We?," was a beautifully understated work, but forget
virtually everything after that. A four-disc set.</TE>
<TE>   Enya's "Only Time: The Collection" (Reprise/Rhino). "Only Time,"
the inspirational song from the Irish singer's "A Day Without Rain"
album, gave comfort to millions after the Sept. 11 attacks,
underscoring the soothing qualities of Enya's music. These four discs
offer a generous career overview.</TE>
<TE>   Elvis Presley's "Today, Tomorrow &amp; Forever" (RCA). There are a few
choice if scratchy live recordings from a 1956 concert. Otherwise
it's assorted movie soundtrack numbers, outtakes and concert
recordings. You can find at least a dozen better Elvis options than
this four-disc set.</TE>
<TE>   Various artists' "Like, Omigod! The '80s Pop-Culture Box
(Totally)" (Rhino). Unless you are having an '80s party, there's
really no reason to have seven discs that include lots of music by
such acts as Taco, the Fixx, Night Ranger and New Kids on the Block.</TE>
<TE>   Dwight Yoakam's "Reprise Please Baby: The Warner Bros. Years"
(Reprise/Rhino) As a country artist greatly influenced by California
mavericks Buck Owens and Merle Haggard, Yoakam was always a
contender, but his vision lacked the indelible creative spark of his
idols. One of the four discs is previously unreleased tracks, several
of them live.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On July 10, the foundations of the Getty Center in Brentwood were
severely shaken. Earthquake was not the cause. The falling of an
auction hammer in London did the deed.</LD>
<LD>   After 10 quick minutes of furious bidding, Sotheby's chairman
Henry Wyndham brought the hammer down on "The Massacre of the
Innocents," a tumultuous scene of Herod's soldiers slaughtering
babies while their mothers try desperately to save them. The painting
had been newly attributed to the 17th century Flemish genius Peter
Paul Rubens. An early work, dated about 1610, it was being called a
signal painting that announced the emergence of the courtly Baroque
era in European art -- easily the most important Old Master picture
to come on the open market in a dozen years.</LD>
<LD>   Wyndham asked for an opening bid of 3 million pounds, one-third of
Sotheby's published high estimate of the painting's worth. "Six
million!" shouted a voice from the room, and the bidding race was on.
Eight contestants went after the Rubens. The price rose quickly in
million-pound increments, and five suitors were still scrambling as
the bid soared past 25 million pounds. A prominent London dealer
dropped out at 32 million pounds, a Dutch and American team of
dealers passed at 35 million pounds. In the end just two were left.</LD>
<TE>   When Wyndham closed the bidding, the Rubens had fetched 49.5
million pounds -- $76.7 million -- the highest price ever paid at
auction for an Old Master painting. The winning bid was placed by Sam
Fogg, a Mayfair book dealer, but within days it emerged that he was
bidding for a private collector -- 44-year-old Canadian tycoon David
Thomson. He'd bought the dramatic work as a present for his father,
publishing magnate Roy Herbert Thomson of England. In November the
Rubens was promised as a gift to the Art Gallery of Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   It won't, in short, be coming to Los Angeles. For it also quickly
emerged that the unsuccessful under-bidder was the J. Paul Getty
Museum, which dropped out when the price got to around $63 million.
There was no joy in Brentwood. Mighty Getty had struck out.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's failure to capture the coveted prize now hangs over
its sun-drenched travertine piazza like an immovable dark cloud. A
ray of sunshine poked through the post-Rubens gloom in October, when
it was learned the Getty had negotiated the $50-million purchase of
what is reportedly the last undisputed Raphael not in a public
collection. A tiny private devotional image of the Madonna and Child,
less than a foot on a side, the Raphael must still navigate
treacherous British export laws before landing on the Pacific shore.</TE>
<TE>   Success with the Raphael will not mitigate the failure with the
Rubens, though. The Getty painting collection needs them both -- and
more still.</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, the Getty was seen as an 800-pound gorilla --
the wealthiest art museum in the world, with the financial clout to
buy whatever rare masterpiece it wanted. But no more. As December's
fifth anniversary of the opening of the lavish Getty Center
approaches, the Rubens episode stands as a marker in the museum's
history.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-year-old has spawned other surprises since its debut, both
happy and dispiriting. The most refreshing is a nearly unbroken
string of first-rate temporary exhibitions. The most startling was
the dismantling and reorganization of programs shortly after the
opening of the center -- a glittering six-building campus, which was
specifically tailored to meet those program needs at a cost of more
than a billion dollars.</TE>
<TE>   But the collection is a singular issue. "When the chance comes to
make a great acquisition, we will," the Getty Museum's former
director, John Walsh, flatly declared in 1983. On July 10 a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity arose -- but the Getty didn't seize
it.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh, since retired, was speaking early in the run-up to building
the Getty Center, after the institution's enormous endowment had been
secured (it now stands at $4.4 billion) but before an architect had
even been selected for the planned Brentwood complex. In one sense he
had no choice.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Getty had a small but excellent collection of Greek
and Roman antiquities and a large but excellent collection of French
decorative arts, its European paintings were mediocre at best, its
European sculptures almost nonexistent. Opening an extravagant new
complex with the largest, most beautiful suite of galleries devoted
to such paltry holdings would have made the museum an international
laughingstock.</TE>
<TE>   In another sense, however, Walsh's declaration had little to do
with the Getty in particular. It simply spoke to any art museum's
core value.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's parent, the Getty Trust, had designed its programs
not just to build the collection, but for the field of art history at
large. Education, conservation, research, scholarly symposia, new
facilities, publications and all the rest are not unimportant. But
even the best of them finally occupies a secondary rank. They merely
support the encounter between a viewer and a work of art. The
collection matters most.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Getty Center opened in December 1997, the quality
of its holdings had improved immeasurably. A mediocre collection had
become a good one, with pockets of greatness.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help outward appearances that two of those pockets were
staggering holdings of works on vellum and paper -- medieval and
Renaissance manuscripts, and 19th and 20th century photographs --
which, for conservation reasons, must regularly be returned to
storage. Individual paintings also stood out, including incomparable
works by Fra Bartolommeo, Dosso Dossi, Manet, Renoir, Van Gogh and
many more.</TE>
<TE>   Another standout was the Pontormo. "Portrait of a Halberdier
(Francesco Guardi?)" by 16th century Italian Mannerist Jacopo
Pontormo was acquired with great fanfare in 1989. Perhaps the finest
portrait of its period now in an American museum, the picture was
bought at auction at Christie's for $35.2 million -- more than $50
million in today's currency. It was the most ever publicly paid for
an Old Master, until the Rubens broke the record in July.</TE>
<TE>   Therein lies a lesson. When the Pontormo went on the block in
1989, I wrote a column on the morning of the sale that simply said
the Getty would buy the painting that night. I had no inside
information. I wasn't psychic, and I wasn't going out on a limb. Who
else but the Getty had the winning combination of deep desire and
deep pockets?</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen years later, the answer to that question is ambiguous.
Many other deep pockets have opened. Meanwhile, the Getty's desire
has flagged.</TE>
<TE>   When the Rubens passed the Pontormo's adjusted-level $50-million
mark, three or four buyers were still after it. The 20th century
claims -- and fears -- of the Getty's omnipotence in the marketplace
no longer apply in the 21st.</TE>
<TE>   Developing the museum's collection of painting and sculpture is
not paramount for the Getty Trust. Huge resources were devoted to
bringing the collection up to respectable snuff for the opening but,
Getty administrators told The Times in 1998, the acquisition budget
was then promptly slashed in half. Since the summer of 1998, only
about 20 paintings and half a dozen sculptures have been purchased.</TE>
<TE>   True, they include some knockout examples by well-known Modern
names such as Monet, Cezanne and Degas, as well as by such
lesser-known older artists as German Renaissance painter Hans
Hoffmann (his only known surviving painting), brilliant 17th century
Dutch landscapist Meindert Hobbema and even a long-forgotten
collaboration between Rubens and Jan Brueghel the Elder. But since
the center's opening, the pace of significant acquisitions has been
sluggish.</TE>
<TE>   Neither is the Rubens the only extraordinary work the Getty didn't
buy. Perhaps the most egregious lapse came last year, when a rare
lime-wood figure of a female saint by Gothic master Tilman
Riemenschneider was sold at Sotheby's New York for $2.97 million. The
buyer was a British foundation. The Getty has battled the British
government over that country's restrictive art-export laws -- notably
for Antonio Canova's pivotal Neo-classical marble "The Three Graces,"
kept in Great Britain through dubious legal maneuvering. (A rare 13th
century Cimabue panel was also withdrawn from Sotheby's days before
an auction, through a deal with London's National Gallery.) So it was
bizarre to see the great Riemenschneider sculpture blithely go
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Nor have marquee names been the only losses. In 2000 there was the
mess with Jean-Francois de Troy. The Getty owns his luxurious Rococo
genre scene "Before the Ball," which was exhibited to great acclaim
with its companion piece, "After the Ball," at the Paris Salon of
1737. When the companion came up for auction in 2000, the Getty
reportedly pulled out of the bidding at 2 million pounds. It sold for
2.4 million pounds -- $3.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Before the ball, after the ball -- clearly the Getty dropped the
ball. For want of a little more than half a million dollars, the
richest art museum in the world came up short.</TE>
<TE>   As the Rubens shows, opportunity missed can be opportunity forever
lost. Yes, $76 million is a lot of money -- roughly the museum's
entire operating budget last year. But so what? Turning money into
great art is an art museum's primary function, not to mention its
greatest joy.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, just as the museum was flubbing the Rubens
acquisition, the Getty Research Institute was formulating the launch
of "an ambitious long-term project" that includes gathering a group
of scholars for intense study on a critical theme -- namely, the
history of art collecting. No word yet as to whether the Getty
Museum's collection will be a subject of their inquiries.</TE>

<DH>No one ever said being a mother and an actress was easy.
But, it's a tough act when you can't afford a nanny.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Tsing Loh</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Seattle</DL>
<LD>It wasn't supposed to be like this, my career in solo performance.
First of all, I was supposed to be young -- lean, catlike, my hips
like a knife's edge in Eric Bogosian-like black jeans. But there I
sat, at 25, and the phone refused to ring.</LD>
<LD>   Now I'm 40, I'm married, I'm tired, I'm flabby ... and the work
comes to me. Now I'm doing a three-month stint at Seattle Repertory
Theatre in the premiere of my new show, "Sugar Plum Fairy." After a
short respite, it's back out to the Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company in
Washington, D.C., to open "I Worry" at the Kennedy Center. The
schedule at both places: eight shows a week, including five a
weekend, with Monday off to do laundry.</LD>
<LD>   And hey -- did I mention my two small kids who go everywhere with
me? Sometimes I forget, what with the sleep deprivation, the
8-month-old's nursing, my 2-year-old's frequent need for reassurance
at 3:42 a.m. because, as a kindly pediatrician noted recently,
"Two-year-olds love routine -- what they hate is transition."</LD>
<TE>   Which is not to say that I'm the first woman to balance performing
with motherhood. Consider the glamorous and in her heyday
always-on-a-film-set Demi Moore, mother of three. Of course, Moore
famously had four nannies. I work in regional theater: "Demi Moore's
kids on Karen Finley's budget" is how I describe my lot.</TE>
<TE>   Still, I count myself lucky because I have my husband to help and,
by the grace of God, my sister -- or as I call them, "Red Leader One"
and "Red Leader Two." Mike and Tatjana plot their visits around the
lives they have in other cities -- hers as a photographer in San
Francisco, his as a musician in, well, last month it was Detroit,
Florida, New York and London. They meet each other in airports, strap
kids into car seats, exchange a stream of rental car keys, apartment
keys, children's museum memberships, diaper bags and, of course,
hilarious complaints about how badly I'm cracking up, often to my
face.</TE>
<TE>   That's the price of not being able to afford professional help. MC
Hammer paid his posse top dollar. My posse is my family, and, believe
me, you feel the difference. Still, overall, I have to say that it
all works as smooth as ... well, as incredibly chunky peanut butter
with leaves and twigs in it.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a sampling.</TE>
<TE>   Week 1. Joyous arrival in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   It's always heaven coming to Seattle, even if it took me and the
kids nine hours to fly here due to an emergency Alaska Airlines
grounding in Eugene because the man behind us kept insisting, no
kidding, that he "smelled something funny."</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, touchdown's always a treat because Seattle Rep is no
Equity-waiver hellhole like the kind my scrappy director David
Schweizer and I have cut our teeth on for so many years in New York
and L.A. Seattle Rep -- well, I think of it as a glowing ocean liner
of delight in the Pacific Northwest gray, bursting with friendly
staffers, zippy guest computers, track-lighted wall art, gourmet food
baskets, flowers, baked goods, welcoming and more welcoming.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there is so much welcoming, I think this is as close to a
career in politics as I'll ever experience. A typical moment at
Seattle Rep is being walked into a lovely dinner party, handed a
glass of wine and told: "This is a special event for donors of $3,000
or more. That man over there? That's Leonard P. Jones. He's a VP at
FirstCorp. They're underwriting your show. Mind saying a few words?"</TE>
<TE>   You do the math and think, "For $33,000 a minute, I think I can!"
And soon, whether you're gazing into the hopeful faces of 11 board
directors, 40 staff members or 200 volunteer ushers ... well, it's
moments like this when you're glad you're no longer at the point in
your life when you're trying to be tragically hip.</TE>
<TE>   I mean, thank God we don't have to say: "Yes, it's about incest --
but it's a surprisingly light and entertaining take! And yes, I do
think your 14-year-old daughter ... would enjoy it." Nope! This year
we get to say: "It's a story of girls auditioning for 'The
Nutcracker'! At Christmas! And what do you know, it's running through
Christmas! What a coincidence!" Life is good!</TE>
<TE>   Week 2. Problems.</TE>
<TE>   My 2-year-old, Madeline, has a runny nose. Greenish. In a city
where I tend to get laryngitis.</TE>
<TE>   A tension falls over the cramped apartment containing me, my kids
and my sister. This is life on a ship, an Antarctic expedition ...
i.e., if someone stubs his toe, just throw the body overboard,
because that toe is going to gangrene, that person's going to go
lame, soon everyone else will be carrying him, causing them to stub
their toes, husky dogs will be offed for meat, the mission is over.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't catastrophize" is my sister's command when I get to
thinking this way. But indeed, even the glowing ocean liner of joy
seems to be smacking up against a few bergs. The continuing theme of
the story: money.</TE>
<TE>   In these shaky economic times, what regional theaters like about
one-person shows is that you only have to pay ... one person.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, my director's motto -- and why I love him -- is:
"More is more." David's not a stool-and-a-glass-of-water guy.</TE>
<TE>   His conception of "Sugar Plum Fairy" is less monologue than
two-character play of me battling a runaway set -- one that contains
an exploding Christmas box, flying tutus, mirror walls, mirror balls
...</TE>
<TE>   She's a neurotic pre-pubescent girl having wild Walter Mitty-esque
fantasies to Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev. Can anything be "too much"?
Apparently they've run some numbers in the scene shop, and the answer
is yes. New York designer David Zinn is hysterical.</TE>
<TE>   Week 3. Thanksgiving: Feast of gratitude.</TE>
<TE>   Two days off! Sinuses cleared! Husband's in town! Design issues
resolved! Flying back to San Francisco, Red Leader Two triumphantly
hands keys to Red Leader One ...</TE>
<TE>   Week 4. Meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   ... who wakes up vomiting with a mysterious stomach flu. And now
we're deep in the bowels of the tech schedule -- the dreaded 12 to
12. At dinner break, I rush home to bolt food over the sink and then,
still in costume, feed the kids ... at which point I'm vomited upon
by Madeline.</TE>
<TE>   Which prompts a metaphysical meditation I call "The 2-Year-Old and
the Diva -- One and the Same." Compare. Madeline has a dresser; I
have a dresser. She has food brought to her; at the theater, food is
brought to me -- or at least tea. She throws tantrums.... I don't
throw them intentionally, but the next day, after another night's
sleep wrecked by having to pump milk at 3 a.m. (the 12 to 12 plays
havoc with every routine), I suddenly burst into tears and run
offstage while a horrified crew watches.</TE>
<TE>   It's dreamlike -- I feel like a gigantic Christmas tree toppling,
taking everything down with me -- which, by the way, is the exact
costume I am wearing at that very moment, complete with lights,
sleigh bells, coconuts! More is more! When word comes that Seattle
Rep's telemarketers' spirits are flagging and they could use a pep
talk.... Not to be melodramatic, but this sounds absurdist, dark,
Pinteresque!</TE>
<TE>   And yet, the telemarketers ... ya gotta love 'em. After all, it's
their grisly task to call Seattle residents during dinner and ask
them to renew their subscriptions. If some "visionary" director has
proffered an all-mime version of "King Lear," it's the telemarketers
who pick up the pieces. Says one telemarketer: "If I call people in
July and they're screaming my ear off, I just wait and call back in
October -- by then they're usually over it." They describe their work
with gallows humor, even cheer. And of course, I've brought baked
goods. Spirits unflagged.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Rep throws a great opening night party. By then I've
slept, the show's working, and everything is gravy. Over champagne I
joke to David Schweizer that a family is the great disadvantage of
being a heterosexual in the theater. Perhaps I'd be better off with
the home life of a fab diva like a Liza Minnelli.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, and a coterie in which no one is biologically able to
reproduce anything," David agrees.</TE>
<TE>   We clink glasses and are grateful for the family we have, in the
theater and beyond. Tomorrow's a day off, isn't it? Life is good. (Or
is the day off Wednesday ... ?)</TE>

<HD>When voices unite</HD>
<DH>At the 'Messiah' sing-along, music lovers find harmony in
Handel's famous oratorio. It earns a chorus of hallelujahs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I've seen whole choirs waltz through the door." Jean Severson's
pleasant alto rises toward a laugh. "Quartets come in, sit two in
front, two in back. There are herds of sopranos. Then there's a group
of people waiting for the 'Hallelujah' Chorus. It's the only thing
they know."</LD>
<LD>   Severson is only getting warmed up as she runs through her take on
a longtime tradition in supposedly traditionless Los Angeles: the
annual "Messiah" sing-along, which for 22 years has predictably
filled two-thirds of the 3,000 seats at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion
with people who love to add their voices to Handel's famous oratorio
-- or, at least, parts of it.</LD>
<LD>   "You get people who get up, sing a measure, then you don't hear
them for a page," she says, "then they chime in a page later. There
are no expectations. There's no pressure. People are hanging from the
rafters. It's unbelievable."</LD>
<TE>   Severson, who is the concert manager of the Pasadena Symphony, has
been participating in the Los Angeles Master Chorale's
bring-your-own-score "Messiah" on and off since 1986. She trained as
a singer and appeared in community theater before shifting gears to
work in orchestra administration.</TE>
<TE>   "Once a year or so," she said, "I dust off my choral skills and
take them down to the Music Center. Basically, it's a free-for-all.
You come, you elbow your way in to a seat: OK, go."</TE>
<TE>   Well, not exactly. The free-for-all has a conductor. This year's
edition, which takes place Monday, will be led by the Master
Chorale's music director, Grant Gershon, whose job it is to keep the
cues coming and the mass effort out in the hall moving along with the
orchestra and the soloists on stage.</TE>
<TE>   "The person who suffers the most is the conductor," Severson says.
"Because it's hideous. Some professionals come, who know everything.
But eventually every chorus gets slower and slower. His poor arms!
Thank God for the soloists. They give the maestro a moment of peace."</TE>
<TE>   This will be Gershon's first go-round at the head of a public
"Messiah." Last year, Martin Neary conducted and Gershon headed for
the audience seats and sang along for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of chirping away, then I hear this wonderful voice next
to me," Severson said. "It's Grant Gershon. It was the most
humiliating experience in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Gershon, who took charge of the chorale last year, participated
"kind of on a whim," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly I had some professional curiosity about it as well. I
had never been to one before. I brought my score, planted myself
among the civilian population and I had a great time.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really fascinating. Some people seemed to be there just to
listen and enjoy. Some people were really putting on a performance.
It really ran the gamut."</TE>
<TE>   Gershon isn't under any illusions about the musical values of the
performance, however.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, any sing-along 'Messiah' is not going to have the
polish of a rehearsed performance," he said. "But it does have a
remarkable spirit of community to it."</TE>
<TE>   A star in the East</TE>
<TE>   What is a two-decade tradition in L.A. is half-again as old on the
East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The New York City-based National Choral Council claims to have
invented the idea with its "Messiah Sing-In" at Lincoln Center's
Avery Fisher Hall in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   "We created the name 'Messiah Sing-In' during a period when there
were sing-ins and love-ins," said the council's music director,
Martin Josman. "New York had long had a profile as being a very
strong instrumental and opera town. Those of us in the choral
fraternity were eager to create an event that made choral music
important for the whole community at least one night of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "Since it was to be a community venture, rather than the
glorification of any one organization or one conductor, we decided
there would be no chorus on stage, that the audience would be the
sole singing group, and that we would have a team of conductors, 17
or 18, each one conducting one of the choruses."</TE>
<TE>   The National Choral Council will offer its 34th annual "Messiah
Sing-In" on Wednesday in Avery Fisher Hall. A "Messiah" sing-along
also has been held annually at the Kennedy Center in Washington,
D.C., since 1971. The Master Chorale is confident that its founder
and leader from 1964 to 1984, Roger Wagner, began the tradition in
Los Angeles in 1980; it may have been the first one on the West Coast
as well.</TE>
<TE>   In the debut version in 1968, the choral council tried to do all
53 arias and choruses in the standard edition of the oratorio,
published by Schirmer. That performance lengthened what is usually a
2 1/2-hour piece to four hours and 20 minutes. Since then, every
"Messiah" sing-along takes cuts.</TE>
<TE>   But then, so do most rehearsed performances. For starters, there
is no single authentic version of the work. From the first
performances (in Dublin in 1742, and in London in 1743, which is
where George II began the tradition of standing for the "Hallelujah"
Chorus), Handel made changes in every performance he led during his
lifetime. British music theorist and editor Ebenezer Prout compiled a
representative and highly influential edition in 1902, though
scholars say even that score didn't reflect any single Handel-led
performance.</TE>
<TE>   Editors have been tinkering ever since. But most sing-alongs as
well as many modern performances rely on the 252-page Schirmer
edition, which will be on sale in the lobby of the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion tomorrow for newcomers who don't have a copy. Gershon will
announce from the stage which parts will be sung and which will be
skipped.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll do more of the score than you might think," he said.
"Essentially the entire first part, probably about one-third of the
second part and probably about half of the third part."</TE>
<TE>   Preparing for the performance</TE>
<TE>   After finding herself seated next to Gershon's "perfect tenor
voice" last year, Severson said this year she plans to do at least a
little prep work for the big day.</TE>
<TE>   "To avoid utter humiliation," she said, "I'll go over the
choruses."</TE>
<TE>   Another alto, Missy Alpern, one of a group of about 10 Beverly
Hills High School alums who have been attending on and off since the
mid-'80s, agreed that some practice pays off.</TE>
<TE>   "Our group doesn't rehearse as a group," she said. "We've sung the
'Messiah' so many times in school and on so many occasions. But that
doesn't mean we don't practice individually."</TE>
<TE>   Baritone George Kohn, a mortgage banker by day, jazz pianist by
night and singer on weekends, is one of the newcomers. He's not doing
much to prepare, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll listen to the recording," he said. "I have a score. I've
heard from others that there are a lot of good singers who show up.
I'm a good sight reader. But I'm pretty much assuming I'll be
carried."</TE>
<TE>   Alpern, who credits her love of choral singing to a high school
chorus teacher, claims that part of the fun is the challenge of
retrieving rusty skills on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a pickup basketball game. You don't know how it's going
to turn out. You find you've turned two pages instead of one and ...
'I don't know where I am!' "</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a fun experience of being together," Alpern said. "The
way the world is today, I could spend my whole life not physically
interacting with anyone. This has to be done the old-fashioned way.
There's no new technology for choral singing. You have to be there.
You have to have the music."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, she says, there is the exhilaration of participating,
even in a small way, in the choral big time: "This is our way --
those of us who will never get to sing with the Master Chorale -- of
singing with the Master Chorale. It's a chance to get as close to
greatness as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Gershon isn't exactly prepared for greatness, but he is prepared
for fun.</TE>
<TE>   "In a perverse way," he says, "I'm really looking forward to it.
It's a new experience. The orchestra is quite good. There are
terrific soloists. I'm a person who enjoys spontaneity in
performance. What could be more spontaneous than having no
rehearsals?"</TE>

<HD>David Lynch: 'Blue Velvet' to BlueBob</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Hochman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Music has been nearly as important as the scripts and visuals in such
influential David Lynch film and TV projects as "Twin Peaks" and
"Blue Velvet."</LD>
<LD>   And Lynch has been active as a producer and collaborator with
composer Angelo Badalamenti and singers Julee Cruise and Jocelyn
Montgomery. So his opinion probably is worth noting in a discussion
about the music and marketing strategies of a new act called BlueBob.</LD>
<LD>   "It's all horse manure," says the director, sitting in the
combination screening room/recording studio of his Hollywood Hills
home, smoke trailing from his cigarette as he gives his hand a
dismissive flip.</LD>
<TE>   Sitting with him, John Neff and Pascal Nabet roll their eyes. It's
not just that they've heard this act before. It's that Neff is half
of BlueBob, while Nabet owns Soulitude, the label releasing its debut
album.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and also because Lynch is the other half of the group.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch writes the lyrics (little vignettes of paranoia and
underbelly cruising) and plays guitars and various percussion items,
while Neff adds everything else and handles the gruff, largely spoken
vocals. Overall, the space-age bluesy atmosphere and dark scenarios
make it perhaps a cousin to Tom Waits and Captain Beefheart more than
to the stark, haunting beauty of Lynch's other collaborations.</TE>
<TE>   "BlueBob started because I love machines," Lynch says. "I said,
'John, I want beats like machines, like dogs on PCP -- when they bite
down you feel it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Lynch and Neff became acquainted in 1997 when the latter, a
longtime studio engineer and designer, built Lynch's home facility
and wound up being hired as the director's audio specialist.</TE>
<TE>   Soon they started some musical experiments and officially teamed
to produce Montgomery's 1998 album, "Lux Vixen," which featured
interpretations of compositions by medieval mystic Hildegard von
Bingen. It was released in this country by Mammoth Records.</TE>
<TE>   BlueBob, Lynch says, started as an experiment. "There was no
thought of an album at all, until we got four things recorded," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   More serious about it, they continued writing and recording and
last year finished the debut BlueBob album. It was released in Europe
last month and got strong press interest and is due here in February
or March. The group, with the two joined by Nasbet and three other
musicians, made its first and so far only live appearance Nov. 11 at
Paris' historic Olympia Theatre, sharing a bill with Portishead
singer Beth Gibbons.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch, with no real musical performing experience, is thrilled
about the opportunity but dubious about his own live role. "John is a
performer and we had a killer band," he says. "I am not a performer.
I just sat there like an idiot. It was torment."</TE>
<TE>   However, with much radio exposure outside of public and college
stations unlikely, there is talk of designing a multimedia theater
presentation to bring the music to the public. Lynch is not
committing. "It just depends on how much torment you can put up
with," Neff says to his partner.</TE>
<TE>   Will Enrique get a response? Perhaps</TE>
<TE>   An Enrique Iglesias single, "Quizas" (Perhaps), addressing family
estrangement and reconciliation, is a hit on Spanish-language pop
radio. Now the singer will make an attempt to reach an
English-speaking audience with the song, but not by doing a new
vocal.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, a version of the song's video -- a melancholy clip with
Iglesias and others lip-syncing the lyrics in solitude reminiscent of
a sequence in the Paul Thomas Anderson movie "Magnolia" featuring
Aimee Mann's song "Wise Up" -- is being released by Interscope with
subtitles.</TE>
<TE>   It will be featured this week on an installment of MTV's "TRL" as
well as on various TV entertainment news shows.</TE>
<TE>   But the person at whom the song is most directed doesn't need
subtitles. Iglesias won't specifically discuss the lyrics, but
representatives say there's no doubt the song was largely inspired by
his own estrangement from his father, Julio Iglesias, and recorded in
part with hope that it might bring about a response.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the senior Iglesias has said nothing of it to his son. In
a recent interview, though, he acknowledged hearing the song, and the
two have occasional contact.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesperson for the father said there was no further comment
about the matter.</TE>
<TE>   A word from their sponsors</TE>
<TE>   Celine Dion, who has signed on to represent Chrysler's new models
with a song written for the campaign, is now working on an entire new
album that will include that song. Max Martin, Peer Anstrom, Rick
Wake and Umberto Gatica have all been producing tracks for the
collection, which is expected to be released in conjunction with the
March 25 opening of Dion's concert production, "A New Day," at
Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Apple will offer a limited-edition Madonna signature
model of its iPod digital music player in the days before Christmas.
Bearing a laser-engraved autograph from the singer, the item will
sell for regular price, but will only be available through her
official Web site, www.madonna.com.</TE>
<TE>   Small faces</TE>
<TE>   New York trio Secret Machines had an impressive music business
turnout at a recent Spaceland concert. Large contingents from Warner
Bros. Records (including chairman Tom Whalley) and ArtistDirect
(including Vice Chairman Marc Geiger) were on hand, along with
representatives of Capitol Records and MCA Records. All seemed quite
taken with the band's atmospheric space-rock, which falls somewhere
between Pink Floyd and Spaceman 3.</TE>
<TE>   California rock band AFI  is shooting a mini-movie for a DVD that
will be packaged with its major-label debut album, due from
DreamWorks Records on March 25. Meanwhile, the band's three
independent-label albums -- on vinyl LPs -- are being sold in an
elaborate boxed set featuring the albums pressed on clear vinyl and a
24-page full-color booklet, all housed in a black velvet box. The set
is available only through Nitro Records' Web site,
www.nitrorecords.com.</TE>
<TE>   Rapper AZ, having asked for and received release from Motown
Records, is shopping for a deal for his Quiet Money label. He's
working with two new acts, Trav and Nova, and plans to put out a
single of his own in February. He's also acting in the movie "Envy,"
co-starring Lisa Ray, Ray-J, Chico DeBarge and Maya Campbell and set
to premiere in April.</TE>
<TE>   On March 18, the reunited Concrete Blonde will release "Live in
Brazil," a new album recorded, uh, live in Brazil. The group will
tour in the spring as well.</TE>
<TE>   A DVD tribute to late singer-songwriter Steve Goodman will be
released March 18 by Red Pajama Records, the label he founded 20
years ago. The disc features 20 Goodman songs, including his most
famous one, "The City of New Orleans," drawn from performances on
"Austin City Limits," plus a mini-documentary with interviews of
Goodman, John Prine, Kris Kristofferson, Arlo Guthrie and others.
Goodman died of leukemia in 1984.</TE>

<HD>Nas finally lives up to his hip-hop billing</HD>

<LD>Nas</LD>
<LD>   "God's Son" (Columbia)</LD>
<LD>   *** 1/2</LD>
<TE>   Long revered as one of hip-hop's brightest stars, this Queens
rapper has rarely lived up to the hype. His albums have been
inconsistent affairs that highlight his striking storytelling
abilities and his use of metaphors as narrative tools, but that also
showcase his inability to distinguish his essential work from his
lesser music.</TE>
<TE>   But Nas gets everything right on his stunning sixth studio album,
which was scheduled to be released Friday. On the funky "Get Down,"
the Public Enemy-like "Zone Out" and the muscular single "Made You
Look," he raps with the type of flair present on nearly all of the
major hip-hop recordings of the middle and late 1980s</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most rappers who claim to "keep it real," Nas takes an
impressively personal take on "Warrior" and "Dance," which feature
him rhyming extensively about the death of his mother earlier this
year. The uplifting "I Can" is equally impressive, as Nas encourages
children to believe in themselves and gives a history lesson designed
to instill hope in the hopeless.</TE>
<TE>   Nas emerges here as a legitimate rap voice without the aid of a
slew of A-list guests or overtly commercial cuts. For anyone doubting
rap's relevance, "God's Son" is a reason to get excited about hip-hop
again.</TE>

<TE>   Carrabba speaks to alien nation</TE>
<TE>   Dashboard Confessional</TE>
<TE>   "MTV Unplugged 2.0" (Vagrant)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   There's delicious irony when an alienated, isolated voice in the
wilderness is surrounded by adoring fans who all feel the same way.
That's the essence of a lot of pop music, and rarely is it so acute
as at a Dashboard Confessional concert. There, clean-cut kids don't
just take in Chris Carrabba's edge-of-anguish accounts of the tough
search for love and truth in a young life. They sing along. Every
word. On every song. Loudly.</TE>
<TE>   This "Unplugged" combo audio CD and video DVD (in stores Tuesday)
fully captures this scene, a summer camp hootenanny where "Kumbaya"
is supplanted by "Screaming Infidelities" chronicles of the searing
pain of being lied to by a girlfriend and other treacheries. The
sharing-session setting expands Dashboard's emotional range by giving
it a meaningful context -- it's the vantage of youth, where
everything that happens to you is very important, and much of it
reeks.</TE>
<TE>   That he does it with folkie earnestness rather than nu-metal rage
or Blink-182 slapstick is a plus. And on much of the session Carrabba
is joined by his stellar band, giving the songs new life. It's that
kind of progress that could add many more voices to the fan chorus.</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   Catchy hooks and a few jabs</TE>
<TE>   The Snitches</TE>
<TE>   "Star Witness" (Oh!Tonito)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   The Reunion Show</TE>
<TE>   "Kill Your Television" (Victory)</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Give the Reunion Show credit -- the Long Island foursome has seen
the garages emptying and suspects the bandwagon is getting full.
"It's all been done before," proclaims the call-out on "New Rock
Revolution," a rollicking number that wouldn't be out of place on any
revivalist's playlist. "We are rebels with no yell / We are idols in
the prime of nothingness / Let's do it for the right reasons ... /
Let's do it for a cause."</TE>
<TE>   OK, let's. Let's ride that cranky old Moog that careens across
your title tirade to somewhere special. Or recall those jagged
guitars that pinprick the princess in "Star Training." Alas, too
infrequently on the band's gutty debut does its bombast advance
beyond wallowing in self-loathing.</TE>
<TE>   While the Reunion Show might have aimed for Weezer's "Pinkerton,"
the Snitches show what might happen if the Buzzcocks stole Weezer's
gear. The veteran Montreal collective's third album brims with lean
riffs, bouncy synths and tongue-in-cheek snappiness that is indebted
to bands ranging from the Cars to the Clash.</TE>
<TE>   While displaying formidable range in tempo, the Snitches peak on
the relentlessly catchy "Right Before My Eyes." They reference the
revolution too, but seemingly only to mock -- in a rib-poking, French
Canadian way -- anybody who takes it too seriously.</TE>
<TE>   -- Kevin Bronson</TE>
<TE>   Quick spins</TE>
<TE>   Alanis Morissette</TE>
<TE>   "Feast on Scraps" (Maverick)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   Morissette matters most when resisting the demons of society and
herself, as she does erupting on the frantic "Sister Blister" or the
big, windy "Fear of Bliss." Quieter songs tend to lose that fire, but
"Simple Together" is delicate and true, transforming this two-disc
collection into more than curious leftovers from "Under Rug Swept."
Add a DVD disc and you have odds and sods for true believers and the
rest of us.</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Appleford</TE>
<TE>   Stellastarr</TE>
<TE>   "Somewhere Across Forever" (Tiswas)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   Galloping through NYC boroughs eager to breathe free of garage and
electroclash, Stella- starr has harnessed a great new-wave hybrid,
part Echo &amp; the Bunnymen drama, part Pixies post-punk howl, headed
with a muscular certainty toward chiming guitar pop. This three-song
teaser to a 2003 full-length album serves as a West Coast debut and
loses no time building perfectly to singer Shawn Christiansen's
plaintive evocation of all the burning sons of Robert Smith, crying,
"Hey teachers, hey preachers, cheerleaders, I'm gonna school ya."
Stellastarr plays today at the Derby and Monday at Spaceland.</TE>
<TE>   -- Dean Kuipers</TE>
<TE>   Swizz Beatz</TE>
<TE>   "Swizz Beatz Presents G.H.E.T.T.O. STORIES" (DreamWorks)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   After helping make DMX and Eve household names in the late 1990s,
this keyboard-dependent rap producer became one of the genre's most
in-demand beat-makers. An adequate rapper at best, Swizz delivers a
few verses on his strong debut album. He remains behind the mixing
boards on most of the collection's 17 cuts, allowing such able
friends as LL Cool J, Snoop Dogg, Eve and the nearly forgotten Shyne
to deliver clever rhymes about life, love and the streets that work
well with his thunderous backdrops.</TE>
<TE>   -- Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   Enanitos Verdes</TE>
<TE>   "Amores Lejanos" (Universal Music Latino)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   The veteran Argentine trio engineers a triumphant comeback,
following 1999's disastrous "Nectar" with a strong, poetic album
informed by the kind of instrumental fluidity and unabashed nostalgia
that three years of nonstop touring can bring to a band. Enanitos'
strength has always been its ability to add delicate, nocturnal
shadings to its harmless pub-rock confections. A highlight: the
infectious Edith Piaf tribute "Frances Limon."</TE>
<TE>   -- Ernesto Lechner</TE>
<TE>   Various artists</TE>
<TE>   "Right to Chews: Bubblegum Classic Revisited" (Not Lame)</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Parents: Not only is this batch of sunny pop worth sharing with
your kids, but apparently you ought to perform with them too. That's
Kayla, the 4-year-old daughter of the disc's executive producer,
Orange County's John Borack, singing on Receiver's version of the
1910 Fruitgum Co.'s "Goody Goody Gumdrops." That wink aside, the
collection succeeds because many of the 25 artists indeed "revisit,"
not merely cover, the 3-decade-old material. The yummiest: Cliff
Hillis' take on Tommy Roe's "Dizzy," Gilbert O'Sullivan's "Get Down"
as performed by Marykate O'Neil (with help from Jill Sobule) and
"Saturday Night" as revved up by Japan's the Oranges.</TE>

<PH>Five Years of the Getty</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>The knight of the realm</HD>
<DH>Chess fan and longtime shaker Barry Munitz thinks several
moves ahead in the Getty's quest to serve arts and community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The other day, as a docent herded a tour group between buildings on
the Getty Center's hilltop campus, an important-looking man swept
past: deep tan, bushy mustache, a retinue of photographers and
minions in tow. The docent sized up this scene and turned to her
visitors.</LD>
<LD>   "I have absolutely no idea who that is," she announced.</LD>
<LD>   "It was just a delightful moment," says Barry Munitz, president of
the Getty Trust, who apparently possesses excellent hearing along
with his tan and mustache. He tells this tale on himself, then
releases a burst of laughter into his private conference room,
perched above the Getty site.</LD>
<TE>   Munitz, 61, took on the Getty Center not quite five years ago,
after two decades in high-profile academic and corporate jobs. Since
stepping in, within three weeks of the center's opening in December
1997, he has reorganized the place, overseen the endowment of more
than $4 billion and, he says, applied himself to the Getty's mission
of being many things to many people -- museum, research center,
educator and even high-end restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   To this post Munitz brought a big personality and broad
reputation. As chancellor of the 330,000-student California State
University system from 1991 to 1997, he was known for prodigious
energy, broad curiosity and a nearly inexhaustible Rolodex, whose
contents were shared in frequent name-dropping. In his office, he
kept a gleaming collection of chess sets and books.</TE>
<TE>   Though he took criticism for boosting fees to balance budgets
while enrollment fell, Munitz was widely credited for bringing new
respect to an academic institution long cast in a role as the state's
second-best.</TE>
<TE>   Yet except for a ripple of fifth-anniversary attention -- hence
those photographers the other day -- the wider world hasn't heard
much lately from Barry Munitz. This lull, following his splashy past,
has some insiders and outsiders wondering: What exactly does the top
dog at the Getty do all day? Has Munitz happily settled into this
role, or is this the calm before another transition, perhaps back to
the world of higher education?</TE>
<TE>   "We have all the exposure we need," he answers, citing the
museum's attendance (roughly 25,000 visitors per week) and the
trust's many other programs. His mission on this hilltop, he says, is
to make his programs sing and make himself invisible.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wander all around this place saying tell me how this
works," says Munitz. "Explain to me why the digitizing of visual
images is such a controversial question. And tell me why you'd be
comfortable doing X in the auditorium, but you find doing Y in the
auditorium just an absolute outrage. I do go crazy if the learning
curve flattens out. But there's very little danger in these next
years of the steepness flattening out."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he adds, when he imagines returning to a job dependent on
fund-raising, "I just can't see going back to groveling on a daily
basis."</TE>
<TE>   From an underdog to an elite</TE>
<TE>   BY all the evidence, Munitz's job is mostly a matter of talk.</TE>
<TE>   He estimates that he handles 20 to 30 incoming phone calls daily
(his assistants think it's more likely twice that).He scorns
computers, and rarely uses cell phones, because he doesn't want to be
enslaved by technology, he says. So his staff forwards incoming
e-mails via phone and fax, typically forwarding message lists six
times a day.</TE>
<TE>   Jill Murphy, the chief of staff he brought with him from the Cal
State system, has the task of separating wheat from chaff.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't have hobbies, really. He doesn't have children. This
is what he does, almost obsessively," says Murphy. In dealings with
Getty department heads, she says, "he returns phone calls within 15
minutes. It scared people at first."</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing piles up," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Before he dug in at the Getty, Munitz says, he didn't fully
appreciate the depth of difference between speaking for an underdog
institution and speaking for an elite one.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking for the underdog, he says, is like acting on stage, with
gestures and expressions calculated to reach the back row. And
representing the Getty is like acting on screen for a camera that
magnifies every nuance.</TE>
<TE>   That difference may help explain the tempest that erupted soon
after Munitz took the job. Musing on the trust's budget, he horrified
administrators at other arts institutions by suggesting that the
Getty, the wealthiest arts foundation in the U.S., should start
looking for donors, instead of just relying on its investments.
Munitz defends that idea, and has plans to develop it further, but
quieted down when other arts groups howled. Since those first months,
Munitz says, he has come to recognize and embrace "the luxury of
taking a softer voice for a while."</TE>
<TE>   He keeps track of Getty-sponsored projects, which reach into more
than three dozen countries, and museum workings, which lately include
a $50-million offer to buy a Raphael painting from a London
collection. He also looks for strategic alliances among cultural
groups and philanthropies worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   For Munitz's predecessor as president, Harold Williams, getting
the billion-dollar Getty Center built was the first order of business
for more than a decade. First on Munitz's list of projects is the
renovation and reopening of the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades, a
$275-million project now apparently on the brink of resuming after a
delay of more than two years amid legal disputes with the property's
residential neighbors. (See accompanying box.)</TE>
<TE>   Another key part of the next five years, he says, will be
"ratcheting up" the Getty's local involvements, such as the
10-year-old program underwriting internships at arts organizations
countywide, a three-year series of grants for historic preservation
around Los Angeles and grants to pay for organizational planning by
smaller organizations from Self-Help Graphics to the Long Beach
Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Munitz's out-of-town work is "showing the flag" and
spreading the wealth. When he saw a chance to help the troubled
Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia to reorganize and perhaps move its
much-admired but seldom-seen collection to a new site, he flew to
Pennsylvania, did some groundwork, made two phone calls to board
members, then mailed a check for $500,000 to help underwrite an
institutional reassessment. He has invested comparable time and money
in helping in the reorganization of London's art history school, the
Courtauld Institute of Art, which may allow the loan of some of the
Courtauld Gallery's collection for display at the Getty.</TE>
<TE>   Munitz views it as his job to entertain ideas that a seasoned
museum administrator might not. For instance, the Getty has long
refused to allow commercial shoots on its site. But last year, when
Adidas and Laker star Kobe Bryant asked about using Getty buildings
and gardens as a backdrop for some advertising images, Munitz thought
again.</TE>
<TE>   "Here we are, so desperately trying to reach out to this range of
communities in the city," Munitz says. "And here's this
extraordinarily visible person ... who loves the Getty." Under a deal
approved by Munitz, Adidas and Bryant got their photo shoot (for no
charge, in fact) and the Getty got permission to send that image out
as a pro-education poster to hundreds of Los Angeles schools.</TE>
<TE>   For his efforts, Munitz pulled a salary of more than $524,000,
plus benefits, last year. But he did not begin on top of a hill.</TE>
<TE>   Raised mostly by a divorced mother in the Flatbush neighborhood of
Brooklyn, Munitz went to Brooklyn College because it was free. From
there, he earned a PhD in literature at Princeton, taught at UC
Berkeley for two years in the late 1960s, and then, just as students
and professors across the U.S. were rising up to challenge the
nation's authority figures, he went into academic administration,
including stints at the University of Illinois and the University of
Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Next he jumped to Houston-based Maxxam Inc., a holding company
that has controlled such companies as Pacific Lumber and Kaiser
Aluminum. That stint put Munitz close to controversy; apart from
weathering protests in California over Maxxam's redwood lumbering
practices, he sat on the board of a Texas savings and loan company
that crashed in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   But by 1991, he'd grown wealthy and his business experience made
him attractive when Cal State went looking for a new chancellor.</TE>
<TE>   Now, largely but not entirely free of the financial constraints
that typically come with nonprofit work, Munitz tells his trustees,
"You can do anything you want to do, but you can't do everything you
want to do." For instance, given the paucity of masterworks in the
art market, "there's not going to be a Vermeer at the Getty. And it
has nothing to do with whether we have $2 billion or $4 billion or
$15 billion in the endowment."</TE>
<TE>   Within months of his arrival at the Getty (soon followed by the
three dozen chess sets and 1,000 chess books on the shelves of the
presidential conference room), he set in motion an overhaul of the
organization's structure -- never mind that the center was designed
specifically to fit that structure. He dismantled the trust's
education and information institutes, saying work on those issues
should instead be spread throughout the trust's programs, and recast
the Getty Leadership Institute as a museum program instead of a
separate department. In late 1998, he found time to serve as head of
the transition team for incoming Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways he's a tough egg out of Brooklyn. We had our
disputes when I was there," says Michael Roth, who served as
assistant director of the Getty Research Institute under Munitz, then
left to become president at the California College of Arts and Crafts
in Oakland. "But it's no accident that he's a great fan of chess.
He's not thinking of the next move, he's thinking many moves ahead,
and that's indicative of someone who's committed to the long term
health of the institution."</TE>
<TE>   Since his arrival, Munitz notes, "10 of the 15 board members who
hired me are no longer on the board, six of the seven directors that
I inherited are no longer here, and three of the seven programs are
gone." The source of his greatest pride so far, Munitz says, is that
"we were able to go through that dramatic change without scandal,
without tearing the place apart."</TE>
<TE>   John Walsh, who retired as director of the Getty Museum in
September 2000, cites the way Munitz "radiates energy." Jack Miles, a
senior advisor to Munitz since 1999, hails Munitz's creation of a
"climate of transparency" among senior staff. "He tells everybody
everything," says Miles. Munitz is not, however, the most frequently
seen man on campus. One former employee, requesting anonymity,
counters that Munitz's daily doings are a mystery to many within the
institution, and theorizes that Munitz's true professional loves are
education and politics, not art.</TE>
<TE>   Influential companions</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, educational and political leaders turn up in the
company Munitz keeps -- but then, so does just about anybody who
wields power in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   August found Munitz and his wife, Anne, on a boat off Dubrovnik,
Croatia, with a group of friends that included philanthropist Eli
Broad and former Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   In September, he walked from Florence to Siena (and looked in on a
Getty project nearby) with a group that included Getty trustee Lloyd
Cotsen and former Princeton University President Harold Shapiro. In
October, Munitz was in London at the Courtauld Institute. And he
passed Thanksgiving on Lizard Island, at Australia's Great Barrier
Reef, where he joined a group including Sherry Lansing, chief
executive of Paramount Pictures' Motion Picture Group and member of
the UC Board of Regents.</TE>
<TE>   What did he and Lansing talk about? The presidency of the
University of California, for one thing.</TE>
<TE>   UC President Richard Atkinson retires in October 2003, leaving
open one of the most coveted positions in all academe. The regents'
search committee includes Davis and Lansing.</TE>
<TE>   In the abstract, the UC job "would be a dream come true," Munitz
says. But he notes that when he recruited many in his current team,
"I made a commitment that if they came, I'd stay." Another factor is
that "it just wouldn't feel right" to take over the state's No. 1
university system after spending so much energy fighting to get more
respect for the No. 2 system.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the prospect of groveling for dollars again in
Sacramento, in the middle of a major budget crunch.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a candidate, and won't be a candidate," says Munitz.</TE>
<TE>   And besides, there is the job at hand.</TE>
<TE>   "When Harold [Williams] left," recalls Munitz, "he said to me,
'I'm giving you an institution that has achieved adolescence. You're
gonna have to bring it to maturity.' And I think of that all the
time."</TE>

<LD>It was scheduled to open long before the Getty's fifth birthday. Now
an expanded and renovated Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades  may make
its debut in 2005.</LD>
<LD>   The villa, a reproduction of a 1st century Roman country house,
was the original Getty Museum (from 1974 to 1997). Its once and
future task is to display the collection's core holdings in Greek and
Roman antiquities, 50,000 sculptures and other objects from the 3rd
century or earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The plan: Build a new entrance, including a 450-seat amphitheater,
and a new restaurant to replace the site's old tea room, expand the
bookstore, renovate museum galleries to increase light and display
possibilities, relocate an auditorium, construct an administration
building and a central plant building (including heating and cooling
systems) and two parking structures.</LD>
<TE>   The complex will grow from 134,000 to 210,000 square feet, and
from 291 to 560 parking spaces.</TE>
<TE>   Getty officials say some of the project is already complete,
including work on the 64-acre property's ranch house, which will
house a library and curatorial and conservation offices, among other
tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Renovation of the museum building is about 80% done, and
construction of the central plant is in early stages.</TE>
<TE>   The cost: An estimated $275 million, which marks a $125-million
increase from estimates four years ago and matches the estimated
construction cost of Walt Disney Concert Hall downtown.</TE>
<TE>   The delay: In 2000, the villa's neighbors, concerned about noise
and traffic issues, prevailed in a Superior Court lawsuit to halt
much of the expansion work. Previous disputes with neighbors had
resulted in a conditional-use permit that limited the facility's
operations, including a ceiling on guest traffic, which in the
mid-'90s was estimated at 400,000 visitors yearly.</TE>
<TE>   This year, in late October, a state appellate court reversed the
Superior Court decision. This month the neighbors appealed the case
to the state Supreme Court, which typically has 90 days to accept a
case for consideration or deny it.</TE>
<TE>   A court spokeswoman said the justices accept 3% to 5% of the
appeals that reach them.</TE>
<TE>   The next step: If the appellate court's ruling stands, Getty
officials could pull construction permits for the disputed parts of
the project as early as February 2003. It will take about 30 months
to finish the entire project once that construction begins.</TE>

<HD>Heads Up on Airline Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumers understandably are focused on how United Airlines'
high-profile bankruptcy could throw a monkey wrench into their travel
plans. But travelers also should pay attention to a proposed
marketing deal that is working its way through a Transportation
Department review.</LD>
<LD>   Why does a marketing deal matter to the flying public? Because the
agreement proposed by Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and
Continental Airlines could dramatically reshape the passenger airline
industry -- but not necessarily in a manner that serves passengers'
long-term interests.</LD>
<LD>   On its face, the marketing agreement seems to be
consumer-friendly. Travelers could accumulate frequent-flier mileage
across the three carriers and enjoy access to more airport lounges
and flights. But smaller airlines -- Southwest Airlines, JetBlue
Airways, America West Airlines and others that have sparked
competition in the industry -- say the deal would make it nearly
impossible for them to break into parts of the country where the
marketing consortium would dominate.</LD>
<TE>   A recent Department of Transportation review of a narrower
marketing plan proposed by United and US Airways Group suggests that
smaller competitors have reason to worry. The agreement cleared an
informal DOT review but regulators expressed "a number of concerns"
because the two struggling airlines control almost a quarter of all
airline passenger traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Delta, Northwest and Continental already carry more than a third
of all passengers and will scramble to make gains as United and US
Airways shrink to reduce losses. If approved, the marketing deal
would lead to an airline industry dominated by three powerful
forces--American Airlines, the United/US Airways team and the
Delta/Northwest/Continental marketing consortium.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers benefit from competition, however. The very existence of
Southwest, JetBlue and other smaller players forces big airlines to
justify fare structures, improve service and respond more quickly to
consumer demand. So regulators must move cautiously in determining
whether the marketing plan will lead to anti-competitive behavior.</TE>
<TE>   It's worrisome that the Transportation Department is conducting an
informal review of a significant plan that could reshape U.S. travel
choices. The department should extend its review beyond its Dec. 21
deadline. And in addition to being thorough, the review should be
formal.</TE>
<TE>   Given what air travelers have had to put up with in recent years,
it's only right that a decision that may affect millions of them not
receive the fly-by-night treatment.</TE>

<LD>Just when you thought you'd heard every possible kind of holiday
story, here comes the U.S. Postal Service with a forlorn plea for
help.</LD>
<LD>   You know those nifty white plastic bins with the sturdy handles,
those lightweight tubs that fit inside each other and were designed
to carry mail from processing centers to homes and businesses, those
government containers that cost $3.25 each and carry a warning about
theft of official property bringing a $1,000 fine and three years in
federal prison? Well, it seems millions of these handy containers
have gone missing. No doubt due to millions of coincidental
accidents. But the Postal Service needs them back. Please.</LD>
<LD>   Not that any otherwise law-abiding American would intentionally
turn a durable government postal bin into, say, a laundry basket,
tool case, magazine rack, book bin, wastebasket, pet bed, footrest,
firewood box, stool, plant box, portable dresser drawer, garbage can,
recycle container, file holder, toy chest, income tax document
container, hose holder or kitten hauler.</LD>
<TE>   But just in case you find one or 10 around your business, house or
apartment, feel free to leave it or them at a post office, mailbox or
delivery door. It's especially important today when Americans
hand-address many of the 850 million pieces that will make Monday the
year's busiest mailing day. Tuesday will be the year's busiest
sorting day and Wednesday the heaviest delivery day, when some 9,000
plastic mail bins will leave the typical postal center.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd really like to get the bins back," said George Marsh, a Los
Angeles postal spokesman. "There's no amnesty or anything. But no
questions asked."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout history the Postal Service has used many delivery means
-- mules, ponies, wagons, trucks, trains, airplanes, canvas bags,
even missiles in one fast, and brief, delivery experiment. The most
practical container has been these simple plastic bins. They hold
large quantities of incoming mail, trundle along sorting lines
collecting pieces spit out by computerized sorters, get steered to
belts to the proper trucks, are hand-carried to delivery doors and
left there on the honor system. That's where the problem seems to be.</TE>
<TE>   Postal officials bought 20 million of these containers in the last
two years, a $65-million investment. In rain and snow, sleet and
storm, the sturdy bins went out on their appointed rounds. But many
fewer came back. What to do? The mail must go through. The Postal
Service issued a news release recently. In one week, 210,924 bins
were anonymously returned. Do you maybe have No. 210,925?</TE>

<LD>That giant sucking sound you hear around your personal financial
information is not an illusion.</LD>
<LD>   Only a few years ago, banks had to keep the lid on what they knew
about your checking or savings account. Since Congress passed the
Financial Services Modernization Act in 1999, however, the "financial
supermarkets" created by the merger of banks, insurance companies and
brokerage firms have been allowed to share any and all data within
their dubiously named "families" with virtually no restrictions. They
can merge customer data from several sources and even sell it to
third parties.</LD>
<LD>   Among the most frightening examples of this is the Orwellian
Medical Information Bureau, a central database on about 15 million
Americans and Canadians. More than 750 insurance firms use the
database to obtain hospital and doctors' office records, which are
used to screen life and health insurance policy applicants.</LD>
<TE>   Widespread sharing of private information helps explain the growth
in identity theft, up 500% since the late '90s.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three years, Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough) has
sponsored legislation that would require financial companies to
obtain consumers' permission before sharing or selling their personal
data. Each year, Speier's bills have been defeated by banks, insurers
and securities houses. This time, opponents will be hurting only
themselves if they lobby against Speier's SB 1.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike similar previous bills, SB 1 is co-authored by one of the
Legislature's most powerful leaders, Senate President Pro Tem John
Burton (D-San Francisco). If the Legislature fails to embrace it,
momentum is expected to build for local privacy ordinances such as
those recently passed in San Mateo, Contra Costa, Alameda, Santa Cruz
and Solano counties. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors is
expected to approve one Monday that would forbid financial companies
to sell or trade confidential personal information without the
customer's written consent. Consumer groups also have said that
should SB 1 fail, they will put a sweeping privacy measure on the
2004 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   SB 1 would preempt local ordinances. As Mark Lowe, a spokesman for
the California Credit Union League, put it: "A statewide standard
would be far preferable to [the current] patchwork of local laws. It
would be much, much easier for all financial institutions to live

<TE>   Speier has made reasonable compromises. Last year, for instance,
she agreed to revise her bill to allow some relatively innocuous data
sharing, such as letting auto insurers switch a customer from a
high-risk group to a low-risk group without first obtaining that
customer's permission.</TE>
<TE>   Banks may try to kill SB 1 by suggesting it could hurt the
economy, a potential death blow in the current deficit crisis.
Opponents should realize that would amount to a suicide pact. A bill
like Speier's is the companies' best hope of avoiding dozens of
conflicting laws, a swamp of litigation and a ballot measure dictated
by consumers who are mad as hornets.</TE>

<LD>I can't find the right shoes!</LD>
<LD>   I'm Willow, a scruffy dog with a big head. Nobody at this place
knows my name. My family moved and couldn't take me with them. So
that's how I ended up here in this jail cell, shopping for shoes.
Most of the feet that whiz by my cage are too busy to stop.</LD>
<LD>   It's hard to play ball with tall, pointy shoes.</LD>
<TE>   Small shoes aren't sturdy enough for walking.</TE>
<TE>   I like worn-out sneakers -- especially ones with mud caked on the
bottoms. If sneakers like that would take me home, we could do lots
of digging together.</TE>
<TE>   Hiking boots mean we could explore the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   And flip-flops would send me to the beach -- yippee!!</TE>
<TE>   But most of the shoes that I like only huddle around the puppies.
Young dogs don't stay long. A family of sneakers usually takes them
home. You see, I've celebrated six birthdays already. I am nobody's
pup.</TE>
<TE>   So I slump. I sprawl. I mope about the icy cement of my cage. I
barely wag my tail when the green-shoed person brings in my kibble.</TE>
<TE>   I lift an ear when a pair of black walking shoes steps in front
me. Not too small or too big. Not too new or too old. The shoes
aren't pointy or shiny or flashy. And best of all, these shoes aren't
moving. They stay here, for a long time.</TE>
<TE>   The man who wears the shoes scratches my ears. He lets me lick
him. This guy even brings me a ball. I look his shoes over and over.
They might be something I could live with.</TE>
<TE>   And lucky for me, he thinks so too. The black-shoed man leads me
out of my cage. He holds the end of my leash and we walk right past
the puppies! I give his scuffed shoes a big, old lick. They are the
perfect fit!</TE>

<HD>Murdoch Looks for U.S. Arm of Satellite Empire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Media titan Rupert Murdoch was once asked by a German journalist
whether he recognized himself when described by critics as an "ogre."</LD>
<LD>   "No," Murdoch replied. "But I can think of more important things
than being loved by everybody."</LD>
<LD>   What the chairman of News Corp. is thinking of these days is
circling the Earth with broadcast satellites, distributing films and
other programming to billions of people in a single shot.</LD>
<TE>   With the official collapse last week of EchoStar Communications
Corp.'s proposal to buy General Motors Corp.'s DirecTV satellite
service, the door has now been opened for Murdoch to make the
purchase.</TE>
<TE>   If he succeeds in buying DirecTV, Murdoch will add satellite
broadcasting in the U.S. to his BSkyB satellite operations in Britain
and Europe, his Star TV satellite group in Asia and his SkyGlobal
satellite services in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   "DirecTV is the golden piece needed to fill in his global
picture," says Sean Badding, senior analyst of Carmel Group, a
California research firm that tracks satellite TV and other media.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's on the ground, not in space, where the real effect
of Murdoch's move would be felt.</TE>
<TE>   A Murdoch acquisition of DirecTV could affect millions of U.S.
households by sparking a price war with cable operators.</TE>
<TE>   Carmel Group projects that satellite broadcasting will have 30
million U.S. subscribers within a few years, in part because the firm
figures that Murdoch would expand the reach of DirecTV to 20 million
households, up from its present 12 million.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, satellites would still trail far behind cable as a
delivery system for television and other services; cable operators
have 73 million customers today. And the merger of Comcast Corp. and
AT&amp;T Corp.'s systems, which received federal approval last month,
creates a single company with 22 million cable subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Murdoch, in other words, would be the underdog in this battle. And
that's just the position he relishes most.</TE>
<TE>   The 71-year-old prides himself on having forged the News Corp.
empire out of the two newspapers he owned in Adelaide, Australia,
nearly half a century ago. "I have fought against them all my life,"
Murdoch said of his more entrenched competitors in Australia back
then -- and of all of his competitors since, according to Australian
journalist Neil Chenoweth's biography published last year.</TE>
<TE>   Murdoch, already a press lord in Britain, became a force in U.S.
media circles in the mid-1980s. In a single year, the
then-much-smaller News Corp. spent $2.6 billion to acquire the 20th
Century Fox film studios, a chain of magazines and six television
stations. The TV outlets became the nucleus of the Fox Entertainment
Group, which now has 35 stations.</TE>
<TE>   In all, News Corp. stands as a giant with more than $30 billion in
stock market value and $16 billion in annual revenue from television,
newspapers, satellite and filmed entertainment on six continents.</TE>
<TE>   Murdoch has insisted repeatedly that he follows no grand plan.
"News Corp. is what it is today because I never pretended to know in
advance which course development would take," he said in an interview
more than a decade ago. "I am a businessman and the chief executive
of a media company, but not a media guru with the vision of a new age
coming."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he says the only reason that he got into satellites is
because he "missed the boat" on cable. "I was wrong about its profit
potential," he conceded.</TE>
<TE>   The alternative course Murdoch picked hasn't been easy. In the
late 1980s, News Corp. started BSkyB in Britain and promptly lost
hundreds of millions of dollars with it over several years.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Murdoch persevered.</TE>
<TE>   "Rupert is a very determined competitor," says John Tinker,
managing director of Blaylock &amp; Partners, a New York investment firm,
who has followed Murdoch's businesses for decades. "BSkyB is a very
strong property now."</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, News Corp. almost went under, just as the Gulf War and a
worldwide recession hit. Murdoch agreed to sell some assets, largely
magazines and print operations, and was allowed to refinance News
Corp.'s burdensome $7.6-billion debt load.</TE>
<TE>   But even then, he didn't slow the company's global expansion.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Murdoch bought the Star satellite operations from its
owners in Hong Kong. News Corp. has had many setbacks with Star,
among them a ban for many years on broadcasting to China. But Star
beamed into India, set up business in Japan and is now back in China.</TE>
<TE>   In the late '90s, Murdoch tried to establish a satellite presence
in the U.S. by setting up a company called ASkyB. But he ran into a
hostile opposition.</TE>
<TE>   The cable companies feared competition with Murdoch, anxious over
the leverage that his global satellite operation could use to make
deals with producers of programming.</TE>
<TE>   The cable industry campaigned vigorously against Murdoch, lobbying
Congress and freezing out News Corp.'s Fox channels in retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Murdoch retreated from the ASkyB attempt, but he came
back last year, negotiating for months with General Motors to buy
DirecTV. GM instead tried to sell the satellite service to EchoStar,
a proposed deal that was nixed by federal antitrust regulators.</TE>
<TE>   The very day the EchoStar-DirecTV merger collapsed, News Corp.
phoned GM executives, asking for a meeting.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a mystery why. Media experts such as Jack Myers, who
publishes an online newsletter on the advertising and media
industries, predict a robust future for satellites, which can be put
into operation with much lower capital investments than cable systems
demand.</TE>
<TE>   Murdoch is saying nothing publicly about his desires for DirecTV.
"It's way too early to talk," says News Corp. spokesman Andrew
Butcher. "We have to see if they want to sell it to us and whether we
want to buy it at the price they may want."</TE>
<TE>   That's true. But it's a sure bet that whether it's through DirecTV
or some other means, Murdoch eventually will find a way to assemble
the last piece of his global satellite network.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no such thing as a 'global village,' " Murdoch has said.
"Most media are rooted in their local and national cultures.</TE>
<TE>   "Nevertheless, when you ask me whether global communications
networks are a reality, my answer unequivocally is 'Yes!' "</TE>

<HD>For Musicians, Is Money Over Art?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With respect to famous musicians ("Reborn Eagles Lose Peaceful, Easy
Feeling," Dec. 8), it appears that it is more often about the money
and less about the art. Sure these guys are entitled to the big
bucks, but how many millions do you need?</LD>
<LD>   I remember several years back on a Larry King interview, during
the Eagles' Hell Freezes Over tour, Larry questioned Don Henley about
the high price of tickets ($100 and up). Henley responded that he
hadn't heard anyone complaining. Probably not, since he doesn't hang
out with me and the million other "average Joe" Eagles fans who
couldn't shell out that kind of dough for a rock concert.</LD>
<LD>   Does Don Felder deserve the same monetary compensation as Henley
and Glenn Frey? Of course not. However, as a long-time band mate who
has contributed to the success of one of America's truly great rock
bands, he does deserve to be treated better than his lawsuit alleges.
Henley and Frey need to remember who they all are: musical artists
and not some greedy corporate entities that just happen to play
guitars and drums.</LD>

<LD>Common sense would dictate that anyone with physical and mental
disabilities needs to find ways to adapt to the society as a whole
("Ruling Could Force Theater Alterations," Nov. 28).</LD>
<LD>   Although there is no question that the society also must try to
make life easier for the disabled, Judge Florence-Marie Cooper's
demand on AMC Entertainment Inc. theaters seems to go beyond logic. I
wonder who will benefit by her ruling if all the theaters with
stadium seating need to be torn down.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, if carried to the extreme, the economic burden probably
would break the back of our society and endanger public safety as
well. For example, many disabled are prohibited from sitting in
roomier rows at airplane exits because they would be unable to assist
in an emergency evacuation. Are they then also considered segregated
and discriminated against under Judge Cooper's ruling?</LD>
<TE>   Should auto manufacturers be required to install special but very
costly instruments on all cars so that people with all sorts of
physical or mental disabilities would be able to operate them?</TE>
<TE>   The Americans with Disabilities Act was enacted with great
intentions; it was just too bad that our lawmakers had adopted a
shoot-before-asking approach in passing this act.</TE>
<TE>   John T. Chiu</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That's just great. The only theater chain in Southern California
that consistently screens open-captioned movies for the hearing
impaired is hit for violating the Americans With Disabilities Act for
its seating arrangements.</TE>

<HD>Got Cash? Forget About Mortgage</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Liz Pulliam Weston</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Is it a bad idea to pay cash for a house? I live in an area
where housing is pretty cheap, and I'm interested in purchasing the
house I'm now renting for $400 a month. I think I can buy it for
about $30,000.</LD>
<LD>   I am 48, make $45,000 a year and have a 401(k) at work. My current
savings outside my retirement fund are minimal as I've been paying
off credit cards. But my mother recently passed away and I'm
expecting a $70,000 inheritance. I'd like to use this money to pay
off an $8,000 car loan and buy the house, using the rest to invest. I
also would use the money I've been paying for rent and the car to
increase my savings.</LD>
<LD>   But my sister says I should get a mortgage instead of paying cash,
because of the tax deduction. Is that true?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Would you pay somebody a dollar to get back 27 cents?
That's essentially what you're doing when you get a mortgage if you
don't need to.</TE>
<TE>   Every dollar you pay in mortgage interest gives you a tax break of
just 27 cents, assuming you're in the 27% federal tax bracket.</TE>
<TE>   That example also assumes you're able to itemize your taxes -- and
most Americans can't. They take the standard deduction because their
deductible expenses, including mortgage interest, are too low to
justify itemizing. The payments on any mortgage you get would be
pretty small -- as in less than $200 a month -- so you probably
wouldn't get much if any tax benefit from a mortgage unless you're
already itemizing.</TE>
<TE>   It might make sense to get a mortgage if you're pretty sure you
can get a better return on your money elsewhere. Given the small
amounts involved and that you'll have money to invest even after you
buy this house, you probably don't need to be too concerned about
this issue.</TE>
<TE>   One small piece of advice: Consider reversing your plans for the
excess inheritance and money freed when you pay off debt. Establish a
six-month reserve with the inheritance, and use the extra income to
add to your investments. That will allow you to pay cash for the
inevitable maintenance and repairs a house needs so you don't wind up
back in debt. Monthly investing will help smooth out market ups and
downs through dollar-cost averaging.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Student Loans Are Like Other Debts</TE>
<TE>   Q: Your advice to limit student loan borrowing is totally
unrealistic!</TE>
<TE>   You said people shouldn't be devoting more than 10% of their
monthly gross income to student loan payments in their first year out
of school, but there's no way I could have gotten the education I did
if I had limited my borrowing to that amount.</TE>
<TE>   Now I'm working in my field, but the payments are nearly killing
me. There should be some government program with loan forgiveness to
help those of us who had to borrow more.</TE>
<TE>   A: It's not unrealistic to expect people to be able to afford the
things they buy, whether it's a television, a home or an education.</TE>
<TE>   When people refuse to consider the consequences of their
borrowing, they wind up as you have: overwhelmed with debt and unable
to save for any of the other important goals of life, such as a home
down payment, retirement or your own kids' education.</TE>
<TE>   The federal student loan program caps the amount most
undergraduates can borrow at $23,000. That amount of debt is a little
bit high for most liberal arts majors who graduate, but more than
manageable for most business majors (who tend to get paid more).</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that there are plenty of private lenders out there
more than willing to lend you just about any amount you request for
an education. They know you're pretty much required to repay, because
you usually can't get rid of these loans in Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   So you need to be the one to put a limit on your borrowing. If you
can't afford the education you want, you need to find an education
that you can afford.</TE>
<TE>   (If you missed the formula for affordable student loan debt, here
it is again. First, figure that your payment on each $1,000 in
student loans will be about $12 a month -- a conservative estimate.
Then find out how much monthly income you can expect after
graduation. Divide that income by 10, and that will help you
determine your maximum monthly payment and thus the maximum you
should borrow for your education.)</TE>

<HD>Movers' Ads Don't Deliver the Goods</HD>
<DH>Promotions in the U.S. Postal Service Mover's Guide point
to disreputable firms with shoddy service, customers complain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myron Levin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moving is never fun. But Carol Erickson figured she'd picked the
right firm for the job.</LD>
<LD>   She found Transworld Van Lines in the U.S. Postal Service Mover's
Guide, a booklet distributed at all 38,000 post offices. Erickson,
80, who moved in July from Santa Cruz to Washington to be near her
daughter, was a believer in the adage "buyer beware." But she figured
that because Transworld was "associated with the Postal Service, they
must be all right."</LD>
<LD>   When the crew pulled up on moving day, they were not in the
gleaming semi-trailer with the Transworld logo that she saw in an ad
in the Mover's Guide -- but in a rented Ryder truck.</LD>
<TE>   It was Erickson's first, but not worst, surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Unknown to Erickson, Transworld had logged a truckload of
complaints. The company wound up shunting her possessions to two
other moving companies, whose employees were abusive and refused to
tell her their names, she said. It took weeks for Erickson to get her
things, she added, because she resisted a demand to pay double the
Transworld estimate of $1,588.</TE>
<TE>   Living out of a suitcase, Erickson held out as long as she could,
but with her possessions -- including vital medications -- held
hostage, she capitulated. When she finally recovered her property,
Erickson recalled, she found many of her nicest things had been
damaged, and the companies refused to process damage claims.</TE>
<TE>   Transworld did not respond to questions about individual
complaints, saying that it usually subcontracts the actual moves with
other companies and cannot account for their actions.</TE>
<TE>   Erickson's story differs only in the particulars from hundreds of
similar complaints. Even its leading trade group -- the American
Moving and Storage Assn. -- acknowledges that the interstate moving
industry is rife with shady operators.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Little Recourse</TE>
<TE>   Irate victims quickly find that they have almost no recourse,
because regulatory oversight is virtually nonexistent, and it's next
to impossible to bring a successful claim in court.</TE>
<TE>   It's one thing when authorities leave victims to fend for
themselves. But it's another, Erickson said, when the government
gives operators such as Transworld a promotional boost.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think the post office would be sponsoring someone who
would take advantage of vulnerable people," she said.</TE>
<TE>   James Balderamma, a Florida activist who runs a Web site devoted
to moving scams, said the Postal Service had failed to appreciate the
extent of the industry's problems.</TE>
<TE>   It's "further proof that something drastic needs to be done,"
Balderamma said. "Even the legitimate movers are complaining that the
rogue movers are stealing their business and destroying their
industry, piece by piece."</TE>
<TE>   The situation reflects a regulatory Catch-22, in which authority
over interstate movers rests with the federal government, essentially
tying the hands of the states. But the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration, a branch of the Transportation Department, concedes
that it makes little effort to go after rogue movers. Agency
officials say they can't afford to divert staff from their main
mission: reducing deaths and injuries from truck and bus crashes.</TE>
<TE>   Although the safety administration advises victims to go to court,
lawsuits usually are futile because the cost of suing exceeds the
damages that could be won. That's because under federal law,
interstate carriers are liable, at most, for the value of lost or
damaged goods.</TE>
<TE>   Despite congressional hearings and a blistering report last year
by the General Accounting Office, the situation has remained
unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   Caught in the crossfire, the Postal Service contractor that
publishes the Mover's Guide, Imagitas Inc., recently canceled
agreements with Transworld -- which soon went out of business.
Imagitas then contracted with a second company, Nationwide Relocation
Services Inc., but canceled that deal too after consumer complaints
about the firm.</TE>
<TE>   The Postal Service and Imagitas say they won't be accepting more
ads from movers anytime soon.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite its obvious relevance to people who are moving, we are no
longer ... seeking advertisers for this category," said Sue Brennan,
a Postal Service spokeswoman. "Should there be a favorable change in
the regulatory environment that would provide consumers ... with a
more effective method of evaluating moving companies, we would
consider opening the category up again."</TE>
<TE>   Under its Postal Service contract, Imagitas produces the Mover's
Guide and a companion Web site that provide change-of-address forms
along with ads and tips on moving. After recovering its costs,
Imagitas splits ad revenue with the Postal Service.</TE>
<TE>   Published three times a year, the Mover's Guide has been hailed as
a big money-saver for the government, shaving millions from the cost
of handling undeliverable mail.</TE>
<TE>   Transworld advertised in the January-April 2002 and May-August
2002 editions of the guide. And the Englewood, Colo.-based firm rode
the government's coattails as hard as it could. Scripts used by
Transworld's telephone sales force stressed an alliance with the
Postal Service, Ron Michael, a former company supervisor, told The
Times.</TE>
<TE>   Transworld's Web site described the firm as "the approved vendor
of the United States Postal Service."</TE>
<TE>   "To be affiliated with a government group," the site said, "one
has to have a strong commitment to integrity and service."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Growing Complaints</TE>
<TE>   In a recent 18-month period, the Denver/Boulder Better Business
Bureau received 96 consumer complaints about Transworld, according to
bureau spokeswoman Tami Roeder. "No viable moving company should have
this many complaints ... especially that have been unanswered and
unresolved," Roeder said.</TE>
<TE>   Shagra Pier, Transworld's owner, attributed the complaints to
companies that Transworld had contracted with for the moves.
"Basically it was, a lot of times, bad choice," Pier said.</TE>
<TE>   For Tara Roberts, who in April hired Transworld to move her from
Texas to Washington after seeing the ad in the Mover's Guide, the
experience was as surreal as it was expensive.</TE>
<TE>   The crew that showed up at her Austin home in a Ryder truck
included a foreman and two day laborers with no experience as movers.
Roberts and her mother, Donna Vallee, said the men told them they had
been heading to a pawn shop to raise some cash when the foreman
stopped to ask whether they wanted to make a little money.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts said the men gouged holes in the doors and floors of her
home, costing her $1,450 in repairs and lost income from the sale of
the house. She said they repacked many things she had already packed
-- which seemed odd until she learned they had tacked $943 onto her
bill for packing materials.</TE>
<TE>   Although Transworld had given an estimate of $2,422.80, Roberts
said she was given a bill for $5,815 and told it must be paid on
delivery "or they would put my belongings in storage and I would have
to pay storage fees and re-delivery fees as well."</TE>
<TE>   She managed to borrow enough from her father to ransom her goods.
After they were delivered, Roberts said she found that her furniture
was damaged, and that a diamond bracelet and $1,000 ring she had
packed in a dresser had disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's unbelievable," Roberts said. But she said a common
response from people she told was, "Oh yeah, this happened to
so-and-so" as well.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Imagitas canceled its agreement with Transworld under
disputed circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   John Kelley, chief marketing officer for Imagitas, said the
contract ended after discussions with Transworld about consumer
complaints. "We were not satisfied" with the response, Kelley said.</TE>
<TE>   Pier, Transworld's owner, had a different account, saying the deal
was scrapped because Transworld had defaulted on payments to
Imagitas. "The last two months, we were behind," Pier said.</TE>
<TE>   Pier also said shaky finances, not consumer complaints, prompted
him to dissolve Transworld in August.</TE>
<TE>   After dropping Transworld, Imagitas signed up Nationwide
Relocation Services, a moving broker based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
Nationwide's ads appeared in the Mover's Guide edition of
September-December 2002, but this deal now has been canceled too.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, the Better Business Bureau of Southeast Florida
has received 69 complaints about Nationwide, said Brodie White, the
bureau's president. White said many of the complaints involved
Nationwide's alleged failure to take responsibility for abuses by
movers it procured for its customers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Notorious Figure</TE>
<TE>   A background check of Nationwide might have raised concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The company's operators have included family members and
associates of Aldo Disorbo, a notorious figure in the moving industry
in South Florida, which government officials say has long been a
hotbed of moving scams. Until an amended corporate filing in July,
Disorbo was listed in state records as a Nationwide official.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Disorbo was banned from the moving industry for three
years as part of a settlement of a lawsuit by the state of Florida.
He later was sentenced to two months in jail on a contempt charge for
violating the ban.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, authorities said, Disorbo remained involved as
a behind-the-scenes operator of at least 10 moving companies, in one
case listing his 2-year-old daughter as a vice president.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times, Nationwide Vice President Milton
Campis said the number of complaints against the company was quite
low, given that the firm is involved in hundreds of moves each month.
And contrary to allegations that it takes no responsibility for its
customers once it refers them to moving firms, Campis said Nationwide
continues to "hold the customer's hand" throughout the process.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a great company," he said. "Are there problems in the
moving industry? Yes." But the way Nationwide handles complaints is
"what sets us apart."</TE>
<TE>   Campis said that after Transworld's default, Nationwide signed a
one-year contract with Imagitas for about $700,000. He maintained
that mutual dissatisfaction led to termination of the agreement,
though Kelley said consumer complaints led to Nationwide being
dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Although Nationwide, as a moving broker, does not own or operate
trucks, it was described as a "full service" company in a Mover's
Guide ad, which also featured a photo of a Nationwide truck.</TE>
<TE>   The truck photo, said Campis, was Imagitas' idea. "They said,
'Listen, put a truck on there with your name on it, it will look
great," Campis said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not aware of that," Kelley said, "and would be surprised by
that."</TE>

<HD>Important Tips for Out-of-State Moves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myron Levin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you are relocating to another state and plan to hire a mover, take
special care with your choice. Experience has shown that you will get
little help from federal regulators or the courts if things go wrong.</LD>
<LD>   Some important tips:</LD>
<LD>   * Begin making arrangements for your move at least four to six
weeks in advance. Get several estimates in writing. Do not allow a
mover to base an estimate solely on contact by e-mail or the
telephone. Reputable firms will inspect your goods, because that is
the only way to make an accurate estimate.</LD>
<TE>   * Consider a binding rather than nonbinding estimate. The binding
contract may be more expensive, but theoretically keeps the mover
from jacking up the price later. Cost should be based primarily on
distance moved and weight of goods, but customers should seek a full
explanation of charges.</TE>
<TE>   * Beware of firms that offer to move you for a song -- they may
have no intention of honoring their low-ball estimate.</TE>
<TE>   * Make sure you know whether you are dealing with a mover or
moving broker. Many firms that bill themselves as full-service movers
are actually brokers or "relocation specialists" that charge a fee to
arrange your move. They will farm out the move to other companies
that you will have no chance to investigate. Brokers' contracts often
hold them harmless from overcharges or damage caused by movers they
hire.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't equate a sophisticated Web site with professionalism or
integrity. Some firms are little more than a Web site and several
people manning the phones. Consider visiting the mover's office.</TE>
<TE>   * Consider hiring a firm from the American Moving and Storage
Assn.'s certified mover and van line program. These firms have agreed
to adhere to a set of voluntary standards. Information on the program
and other moving tips can be obtained at www.moving.org, or by
calling the association at (703) 683-7410. Moving tips also are
available on the Web site of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration, www.fmcsa.dot.gov  (keyword: Moving), where you also
can check whether a mover is licensed and insured (keyword: Licensing
and Insurance System), though this does not guarantee you will be
treated well.</TE>
<TE>   * Your mover is required by federal law to give you a booklet that
spells out your rights and responsibilities. Make sure you receive
and review the booklet; don't deal with a mover that fails to provide
it.</TE>
<TE>   * Never sign blank documents.</TE>
<TE>   * Beware of firms with names nearly identical to those of
established movers, a common deception by fly-by-night firms.</TE>
<TE>   * Consider buying extra insurance, and don't deal with firms that
don't offer it. Standard coverage is free, but pays only 60 cents a
pound for items damaged, lost or stolen. If a family heirloom
weighing 20 pounds is lost, standard coverage pays you just $12.</TE>
<TE>   * Create an inventory and check the mover's inventory of your
goods. Consider photographing or videotaping your belongings to
verify their condition at time of pickup. Also at pickup, carefully
read the bill of lading, which is your contract with the mover. Don't
allow the movers to start loading the truck until you're satisfied
that everything is in order.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A few years ago, when IBM Corp. was contemplating a major change in
its pension program, the threat of losing millions of dollars in
promised benefits galvanized workers. They organized, protested and
persuaded the company to alter its plans.</LD>
<LD>   Millions of other American workers who are covered by traditional
pensions may face a similar battle in 2003. That's because the
federal government last week issued a proposal that could end a
three-year moratorium on the type of changes IBM had sought --
specifically, the conversion of traditional "defined benefit"
pensions to so-called cash-balance plans.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike a traditional pension, which guarantees a monthly payment
that's based on the participant's age, years of service and final
income at a company, cash-balance plans provide each participant with
a personal account, similar to a 401(k).</LD>
<TE>   The amount a cash-balance retirement plan eventually will pay in
pension benefits hinges on how much the company contributes to the
plan and the rate of return the company guarantees the money will
earn over time.</TE>
<TE>   For older workers, that can mean sharply reduced pension payments
compared with traditional defined-benefit plans.</TE>
<TE>   That is one of the big reasons many companies are interested in
making the shift to cash-balance programs: Firms can save huge sums
in pension funding.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the number of traditional pension plans has shrunk
over the last two decades, about 42 million Americans still were
covered by the plans as of 1998, the last year for which data is
available, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that mobilized IBM workers," said Jimmy Leas,
an IBM employee in South Burlington, Vt., who was involved in the
fight when IBM proposed converting to a cash-balance plan. "We
picketed. We wrote letters. People stopped working, and they forced
the company to make a change" in its proposal, he said. "American
workers can put a stop to this."</TE>
<TE>   The government's concern about the fairness of cash-balance plans
led to the moratorium on conversions of traditional pensions starting
in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   But last week, the Treasury Department issued proposed rules
addressing age-discrimination issues that arise with cash-balance
plans. The rules, if finalized, could end the moratorium and open the
floodgates to a wave of pension-plan conversions, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Conversion Backlog</TE>
<TE>   "The whole world is not going to turn to cash balance, because
different companies have different needs," said Eric Lofgren, global
director of the benefits consulting group at Watson Wyatt Worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, he said, "there is a backup of companies that wanted to
go cash balance but didn't want to do it until things were more
certain. We will see a big wave of conversions."</TE>
<TE>   Experts note that cash-balance plans have advantages for some
workers, particularly younger ones who are likely to switch jobs at
least several times in their careers.</TE>
<TE>   Younger workers are at a disadvantage with traditional pensions,
because those plans are back-loaded -- that is, those who remain with
the company the longest get the biggest pension payments.</TE>
<TE>   Cash-balance plans, by contrast, usually promise all workers
identical annual percentage rates of growth in pension-account
assets, regardless of age. That can allow younger workers to accrue
benefits faster than under traditional plans.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, cash-balance plans are portable. Though a vested
participant eventually will get his or her earned pension benefits no
matter whether the pension is traditional or a cash-balance plan, the
structure of the latter allows that transfer to occur at the
termination of employment rather than at retirement. (The money can
be paid out in a lump sum, and rolled over into an IRA, for example.)</TE>
<TE>   But for older workers, any new conversions of traditional plans to
cash-balance plans could be costly, despite the government's
proposals to address the fairness issue, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The leveling out of pension accruals under cash-balance plans
hurts longtime workers who have relied on the traditional pension
system that rewards seniority with richer pensions. When that promise
is taken away at 35, the participant probably has time to save enough
to make up the difference. But when it's taken away at 50 or 55, it's
another story, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who get caught in the middle are often getting a bad
deal," said David Certner, director of federal affairs for the
American Assn. of Retired Persons in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Complex Formula</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the complexity of the pension-conversion formula can
open the door to abuses, and the government's proposed rule change
does little to eliminate that possibility, Certner said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law bars companies from taking away pension benefits that
already have been earned by an employee.</TE>
<TE>   However, figuring out the exact amount that each employee is due
from an old pension plan requires a complicated calculation whereby
the company determines the monthly retirement annuity that the
participant already has earned (based on age, service and salary);
calculates the lump sum required to generate that monthly annuity at
age 65; and then applies a "discount" rate to determine the present
value of those future benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The discount rate assumption in the calculation is key. The higher
the assumed rate of the money's growth, the smaller the present value
of the benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Pension law currently says companies should use the 30-year
Treasury bond yield, which is roughly 5% today, as the discount rate,
to be conservative.</TE>
<TE>   But the proposed rule allows companies to calculate the present
value of future benefits based on any "reasonable" interest rate
assumption. Using even a slightly higher rate can have a dramatic
effect on the value ascribed to employees' already vested benefits in
pension plan conversions.</TE>
<TE>   Consider a 50-year-old woman entitled to a $2,000 monthly benefit
at age 65. Using a 5% discount rate, this woman would start the
conversion process with $165,033 in already-earned benefits.</TE>
<TE>   But if the assumed discount rate was 7%, the present value of her
benefit would be roughly 25% less -- $122,442.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the proposed rule allows for something called
"wearaway." In a nutshell, this means that an older employee could go
several years without earning additional pension benefits.</TE>
<TE>   A quick explanation of how wearaway occurs: When a cash-balance
plan is created, each participant would have two separate accounts.
One would equal the present value of the vested pension benefits in
the old plan; the other would be the participant's opening balance in
the new cash-balance plan.</TE>
<TE>   If an employee quits, he or she would be entitled to whichever
account had the higher balance. However, for an employee who stays
with the company, the present value of the vested pension would stay
constant while the cash-balance account would continue to accumulate
company contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Assume the company is contributing $5,000 a year to the employee's
new cash-balance plan. If the present value of the old pension is
$200,000 and the opening sum in the cash-balance account is $100,000,
it would take years for the cash-balance account to exceed the old
pension's value, even if the credited rate of return is substantial.</TE>
<TE>   The government said it doesn't consider a period of wearaway to be
discriminatory, assuming the present value of the old pension plan
was figured fairly.</TE>
<TE>   "What happens to a mid-career worker, who has put a number of
years into a defined-benefit plan and then has the formula changed?"
Certner asked. "We were disappointed that the Treasury didn't do more
to protect employees."</TE>
<TE>   Because pension issues can be so complex, workers at companies
that are contemplating a shift to cash-balance plans often don't
understand what they've lost until long after it's been taken away,
said Douglas Sprong, a St. Louis attorney representing employees who
are suing over cash-balance conversions.</TE>
<TE>   "IBM had the smartest workforce that the world has ever known, so
they figured it out," Sprong said. But in the past, companies have
presented cash-balance conversions with documents emphasizing the
portability of the plans, without detailed discussion of how much
some workers could lose in the end.</TE>
<TE>   Pension advocates had hoped that the Treasury would require
companies to use the currently low statutory discount rate when
calculating the present value of pension benefits in a conversion.</TE>
<TE>   They also wanted longtime workers to be eligible for some type of
grandfathering -- either the ability to stick with the old plan
through retirement, or be given another assurance that their benefits
wouldn't be drastically slashed when they were on the doorstep of
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Neither was included in the proposal, though it's possible
individual companies could choose to grandfather older workers or
provide other credit for service already earned.</TE>
<TE>   IBM allowed mid-career workers with a certain level of seniority
to choose which pension plan they preferred.</TE>
<TE>   For pension advocates, the battle is just beginning: A group of
individuals and organizations that fought cash-balance plans in the
past met Friday to plot their next move, said Karen Ferguson,
director of the Pension Rights Center in Washington and a longtime
critic of cash-balance plans.</TE>
<TE>   They're hoping to fuel a large public response to the possible
lifting of the moratorium on plan conversions.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed rules are subject to a 90-day comment period and
public hearings before they're made final.</TE>
<TE>   "Employees should raise this issue in their workplace, with their
members of Congress and with President Bush," said Rep. George Miller
(D-Calif.). "If they do not, the issue will fade and with it the
annual value of their pension."</TE>
<TE>   "We are at a time when there is incredible insecurity -- when
people are tremendously worried about their income in retirement,"
Ferguson said. "We think there is going to be a tremendous outpouring
of outrage from affected employees."</TE>

<HD>Understanding Cash-Balance Plans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>From Associated Press</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some facts about cash-balance pension plans:</LD>
<LD>   * The first cash-balance plan was introduced by Bank of America in
1985, but large numbers of employers began embracing the idea only in
the late 1990s, in a search for cost savings. About 19% of the
largest 1,000 U.S. companies had such plans in 1999, before a
moratorium halted conversions of traditional pension plans to
cash-balance plans.</LD>
<LD>   A report this year by consultant Watson Wyatt Worldwide found 33
of the largest 100 firms have instituted cash-balance plans or
similar types of plans.</LD>
<TE>   * Employers typically contribute to workers' cash-balance accounts
based on a percentage of workers' annual income -- often 5% of pay.
In that sense, the plans resemble 401(k) retirement accounts. But
workers aren't able to contribute and have no control over how the
money is invested.</TE>
<TE>   Companies build in an assumed annual percentage rate of return on
the accounts that is the same for all workers, regardless of their
age.</TE>
<TE>   * Company adoptions of cash-balance plans have been at a virtual
standstill since 1999, after protests by workers at some companies
led the Internal Revenue Service to halt approval of new plans and
led some members of Congress to call for reform.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of workers have sued their employers over the plans,
claiming conversions from traditional pension plans reduce benefits
of older workers and thus are discriminatory.</TE>
<TE>   Although companies were free to go ahead with conversions even
without the government's OK, most have waited, worried that they
would be open to charges of discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   New rules proposed last week by the Bush administration, if
approved, would clarify the standards for such plans, putting limited
burden on companies to prove their fairness and allowing more
conversions.</TE>

<HD>'Rings' Around the Clock</HD>
<DH>A fellowship of filmmaking spans the globe and works
24-hour days to produce 'The Lord of the Rings'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. Huffstutter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To bring the timeless tale of "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"
to the big screen, director Peter Jackson embarked on a quest that
would have made even his Hobbit hero Frodo tremble: to conquer time
itself.</LD>
<LD>   The latest film chapter of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic work, which hits
theaters this week, was produced by an army of more than 500 people
that spanned 21 time zones across three continents. As animators in
New Zealand finished painting the sneaky gleam in the eyes of the
humanoid Gollum, artists in Los Angeles were touching up his
translucent skin. Overseeing it all was Jackson, who kept tabs on
every brush stroke while laboring over the movie's soundtrack with an
orchestra in London.</LD>
<LD>   Somewhere, at any hour, someone was working on the film.</LD>
<TE>   Banking on the power of the Internet and with the difference in
time zones, movie productions such as "The Lord of the Rings" have
become nonstop affairs, spawning a workday on which the sun never
sets. The 24-hour cycle, which was tested during the production of
the first movie in the "Rings" trilogy, already is being implemented
for the third installment, "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the
King."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't even bother asking what time it is anymore," said a very
tired John Clinton, project producer with visual effects shop Sony
Pictures Imageworks in Culver City. "The movies never stopped. They
never slept. Neither did we."</TE>
<TE>   Bits of the movie flowed through cyberspace from one city to the
next, without so much as a pause. As Tolkien might say, the
production relied on one vision to rule them all, one deadline to
find them, one global computer system to bring them all and in
cyberspace bind them.</TE>
<TE>   In a 24-hour workday, the schedule is grueling. Each day is
regimented with almost military-like precision, broken down minute by
minute. But the absence of regular night-and-day cycles also can be
incredibly confusing. Is the next conference call at 1 p.m. New
Zealand time? Los Angeles time? London time?</TE>
<TE>   But the payoff, as Jackson found, is the ability to create a film
on the epic scale of "The Lord of the Rings" -- and not just one, but
three at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Shifting production around the globe is already common in some
quarters of the technology and entertainment worlds. The benefits
typically include faster turn-rounds and cheaper labor costs, freeing
specialists to focus on high-level work. But rarely has it been
embraced as fully as it was by the makers of "The Two Towers."</TE>
<TE>   Take one "day" as an example. It's 8 a.m. Friday in Wellington,
New Zealand, time for the artists at Weta Digital, the effects and
production company behind "The Two Towers," to cram into a tiny
office and begin one of a dozen international meetings the staff
holds each day. Sipping a warm cup of tea, visual effects supervisor
Jim Rygiel picks up a phone and dials.</TE>
<TE>   An ocean away, the phone rings at Imageworks. Inside a cozy room,
where the air hums with the sound of computer monitors, it's noon
Thursday in Southern California. A handful of artists greet the New
Zealand crew and the two teams begin to study footage of the film.</TE>
<TE>   As they speak, bits of data fly through the Net, zooming across
millions of miles of cable. When translated onto a monitor, they
arrange themselves into images of the film's noble knights and fair
maidens.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Across Time Zones</TE>
<TE>   Halfway through the conversation, they place a call to Jackson,
who's at a rented house just outside London. The director joins the
discussion about the skin tone of tree-like creatures called Ents.
For him, it's after 8 p.m. Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   When the meeting ends more than two hours later, Jackson will head
to bed. The Los Angeles team will be moving toward dinner time, while
the New Zealand team is preparing to work through lunch.</TE>
<TE>   "There just weren't enough hours in the day to get everything done
for all three films," said co-producer, Barrie M. Osborne. "We used
the Internet to cheat time."</TE>
<TE>   Such a system is familiar to technology workers. Silicon Valley
firms routinely employ scores of programmers half a world away in
places such as China and India to save money and squeeze more work
into a project than a typical workday would allow. This type of
project handoff was critical for programmers at the end of the
millennium, as they raced to root out so-called Y2K bugs before Jan.
1, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   International cooperation is also commonplace in the world of
animation. At Film Roman, the North Hollywood studio that animates
"The Simpsons" and "King of the Hill," artists work for months at a
time drawing and detailing scenes in an episode. Files are then
shipped either in paper form by mail or in digital form via the Net
to art houses in South Korea, where millions of frames are colored
and finished.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Back and Forth</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks before each episode airs, artists on both sides of
the Pacific Ocean hand the project back and forth between secure
computer servers to make minute changes from the director and
writers. The work is painstaking, as a single editorial change can
entail redrawing hundreds of frames.</TE>
<TE>   "When we start getting down to the wire, it's crucial that we use
the Net for those kinds of last-minute changes," said John Hyde,
chief executive of Film Roman. "We need the technology to make our
deadlines."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has long turned to technology as a means of creating
more man-hours for a project. In 1994, long-distance provider Sprint
Corp. and animation workstation maker Silicon Graphics Inc. launched
a private telephone and computer network for the entertainment
industry that allowed subscribers to transmit video or graphics in a
matter of minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of post-production and visual effects firms such as Digital
Domain in Venice had hoped the system would help them cope with the
dozens of time-consuming back-and-forth approval and editing sessions
they would normally undergo with a project's director. But the
system, which cost as much as $30,000 a month to run, proved too
costly for the budget-conscious entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the idea of using technology to connect an
increasingly global and fragmented motion-picture industry survived.
Part of it was inspired by the massive number of film and television
productions leaving Los Angeles in search of cheaper foreign locales.</TE>
<TE>   While most productions go offshore to take advantage of tax breaks
and lower wage rates, a side benefit is the continuous workday. That
advantage is starting to catch on with other big-budget projects in
production. "Peter Pan" and the next two installments of "The Matrix"
series are filming overseas and using the Internet to send daily
takes, director notes and other data back to their home studios in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Film companies in Australia and New Zealand have embraced this
strategy and often tout the ease of access to high-speed data
connections between their countries and the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   In nearby Fiji, real estate developer Paradise Entertainment Ltd.
is preparing to break ground next year on a 6,000-acre studio and
post-production facility. One key selling point is the center's
location, right on the Southern Cross undersea optical cable, one of
the world's largest data pipes.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood needs time," said Taniela Bolea, chief executive of the
Fiji Audio-Visual Commission. "We sit right on the international
dateline, and right on a huge data pipe. It made sense to build on
all that."</TE>
<TE>   But saving time can come with a price.</TE>
<TE>   While brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski were directing the
original "Matrix" movie in Sydney, studio executives at Warner Bros.
insisted on seeing daily takes of the footage. Osborne, who was
executive producer on the Keanu Reeves blockbuster, recalled that the
crew in Australia used bundled high-speed ISDN lines and a software
program to automatically send digital copies of video clips to the
studio each night.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, the system should have worked. But the software made an
expensive mistake: If the computers in Sydney had difficulty staying
connected to the computers at Warner Bros.' offices in Burbank, the
software would hang up and redial -- each time making a long-distance
call.</TE>
<TE>   "After not getting a phone bill for several months, I got one that
amounted to several hundred thousand dollars," Osborne said. "It was
a nightmare, costing us a fortune and not producing any results."</TE>
<TE>   That experience, coupled with the realization that Jackson would
be in London while the visual effects and sound editing work on "The
Two Towers" was being done in New Zealand, led Osborne and the Weta
staff to start dreaming up better ways to keep the director in the
loop.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Networking</TE>
<TE>   The team made a deal with Telecom New Zealand, the country's
largest communications provider, and Media.Net, a Manhattan
Beach-based networking company. Working with local firms, they
established a secure private data network between London and Weta's
offices in Wellington.</TE>
<TE>   When the sun set in New Zealand, large data files containing sound
tracks and digital clips of visual effects were sent to a server near
the house Jackson was renting in England. He pulled the data onto a
portable Apple iPod, then transferred the files to his laptop to
review them.</TE>
<TE>   "We would sit [in New Zealand] and Peter would play back the sound
mix in London. He'd call us and say, 'I'm ready to give you notes,' "
said Christopher Boyes, an editor at Skywalker Sound who served as
lead sound mixer on the project. "It was like having him at home."</TE>
<TE>   As Jackson and the Weta team spoke, their computers exchanged
electronic commands that would allow either side to point out a
specific detail on the screen or pull up a particular frame of
footage.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't work smoothly at first.</TE>
<TE>   "The files were moving too slowly," Osborne said.</TE>
<TE>   After scouring the network, Weta resolved the problem by upgrading
the computers at the Wellington facility.</TE>
<TE>   There was another hurdle: Even with 1,400 computers running 24
hours a day at Weta, the massive amount of rendering for the virtual
characters and backgrounds in "The Two Towers" would take more than a
year to finish. Looking to offload some work, Jackson tapped the
visual effects staff at Imageworks.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such a crazy schedule," said Debbie Denise, executive vice
president of production infrastructure for the Culver City operation.
"We had two sets of clocks, one on New Zealand time and one on London
time. We figured out what meeting we were in by what clock we were
looking at."</TE>
<TE>   From Jackson's perspective, the only thing that mattered was time.
His specific focus was the end of October, his deadline for
delivering the final edit of the film to the printers. They needed to
make 10,000 copies of "The Two Towers" for this week's release and
couldn't afford to wait.</TE>
<TE>   "We were still finishing up the final sound mix as the plane was
flying from New Zealand to Los Angeles with the print master,"
Osborne said. "Sending the sound [to the lab] electronically saved us
a day or two in delivery time. It gave Peter the extra time he
needed."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson used every spare minute. The sound arrived a couple of
hours before the printing machines started rolling.</TE>

<LD>Employers Plan to Spend More on Health Care</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles-area companies expect health-care spending on their
employees to jump nearly 15% next year, according to a survey by
Mercer Human Resource Consulting. That would come on top of an
expected 8.6% bump this year, when employers are spending an average
of $5,628 per worker.</LD>
<LD>   Sixty-eight California companies were part of the survey, which
polled 2,889 employers across the country.</LD>
<TE>   Nationally, employers expect health-care costs to rise 14.6% in
2003, about the same as this year's 14.7% increase, the steepest in a
dozen years and seven times the rate of inflation.</TE>
<TE>   Employers in the Los Angeles area are expecting the rate of
increase to double next year because they have been more aggressive
in curtailing costs through higher co-payments and deductibles and
more restricted formularies, said Praveen Thadhani, a Mercer human
resources consultant. Many local employers don't think they can take
as hard a line with workers this coming year, he said.</TE>

<TE>   UAL Seeks Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection</TE>
<TE>   The parent of United Airlines filed for bankruptcy reorganization,
setting in motion a major overhaul of the loss-ridden carrier. The
Chapter 11 filing means United will continue operating while it
develops a plan to pay back its creditors.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the No. 2 airline behind AMR Corp.'s American Airlines
has vowed to continue flying its current schedule and maintain its
frequent-flier program.</TE>
<TE>   But in coming months, the carrier and parent UAL Corp. are
expected to undergo significant changes that could include shrinking
the airline and selling off routes and other assets to raise cash.
Those changes, in turn, are likely to trigger major shifts throughout
the airline industry and in the choices available to travelers.</TE>
<TE>   United is the biggest airline at the Los Angeles and San Francisco
airports, and several of its most heavily traveled routes involve the
two cities.</TE>
<TE>   United, the most powerful and profitable airline only a few years
ago, is awash in red ink and unable to make payments on its $21
billion of debt. Its Chapter 11 filing culminated a grueling downturn
at the company in the last two years that produced record losses,
eroded service, alienated many passengers and sapped employees'
morale.</TE>

<TE>   Bush Nominates 3 to Economics Team</TE>
<TE>   President Bush announced three appointments to his economics team,
which had been shaken up by resignations and dismissals.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he would nominate the chairman and chief executive of
CSX Corp., John W. Snow, as Treasury secretary, putting a corporate
leader in charge of the struggling economy. Snow, a veteran of the
Ford administration, brings a resume that crosses an academic's
economics knowledge with the reality of a quarter of a century in the
business world at CSX, a transportation holding company.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also named Stephen Friedman, a former co-chairman of
investment firm Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., to succeed Lawrence B. Lindsey
as chairman of the National Economic Council, a White House advisory
group.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsey and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill were dismissed Dec.
6, submitting their resignations as the White House hurried to spur
economic growth before entering the early phases of Bush's 2004
reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also nominated William H. Donaldson, a former investment
banker, academic and Wall Street official, to head the Securities and
Exchange Commission, a move aimed at restoring confidence in the
financial integrity of corporate America. Donaldson would replace
Harvey L. Pitt, who resigned last month after a series of
controversies that raised questions about his ability to be a tough
overseer of Wall Street amid this year's torrent of business
scandals.</TE>

<TE>   EchoStar Throws in the Towel on DirecTV Deal</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar Communications Corp. finally abandoned its proposed
$18-billion acquisition of Hughes Electronics Corp., the owner of
satellite TV giant DirecTV. But EchoStar will end up paying its El
Segundo-based rival only a fraction of a previously negotiated
penalty for backing out of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Under a settlement with Hughes' parent, General Motors Corp.,
EchoStar has paid the full $600-million breakup penalty but it will
avoid having to spend $2.7 billion, as called for under the original
merger agreement, to purchase Hughes' controlling stake in PanAmSat,
a commercial satellite service.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement may clear the path for a sale of Hughes to News
Corp., the entertainment giant controlled by Rupert Murdoch that lost
a bidding war to EchoStar a year ago. Murdoch called Hughes to
request a meeting with GM. Murdoch has said he would be interested in
purchasing GM's 30% controlling stake in Hughes.</TE>

<TE>   K2 Pursues Baseball Glove Maker Rawlings</TE>
<TE>   K2 Inc. confirmed that it is making a pitch for Rawlings Sporting
Goods Co., one of the nation's oldest suppliers of baseball gloves
and equipment, in a move designed to make the Los Angeles-based
snowboard and ski manufacturer a company for all seasons. K2, which
sells Olin skis and Ride and Morrow snowboards as well as Shakespeare
fishing gear, said it has been in talks to take over 115-year-old
Rawlings, of Fenton, Mo., since last month. Details of the
discussions weren't disclosed.</TE>

<TE>   Seagate Stock Offering a Disappointment</TE>
<TE>   Computer disk-drive maker Seagate Technology Holdings went public
and the tepid response from investors spoke reams about the state of
the IPO market. After the company priced its new shares at $12 each
-- compared with expectations of $13 to $15 -- Seagate slumped to
close at $11.50 in its debut trading session on the New York Stock
Exchange, a result that rendered it "broken" in market-speak.</TE>
<TE>   Seagate, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands but is run
from Scotts Valley, Calif., is one of only 16 California companies to
be taken public this year. Indeed, 2002 is shaping up to be the
slowest year for IPOs by California companies since at least 1980,
according to data tracker Thomson Financial.</TE>
<TE>   The national picture isn't much better: 82 companies nationwide
have floated IPOs this year, also the slowest pace in at least a
decade. The long bear market has made many investors unwilling to
take a chance on shares of new companies.</TE>

<TE>   Workers Accuse FedEx of Discrimination</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-six current and former California employees of FedEx Corp.
filed a lawsuit accusing the world's largest express shipper of
widespread discrimination against minorities and women.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleges that the Memphis, Tenn.-based company relegates
most minorities to low-paying, casual and even dangerous jobs and
undermines their efforts to advance. When employees complain, FedEx
fails to take appropriate action and, in some cases, retaliates, the
suit alleges. It also accuses FedEx of falsifying time cards and
failing to pay overtime.</TE>
<TE>   A FedEx spokeswoman said the claims appear to be without merit.</TE>
<TE>   Of FedEx's 117,000 U.S. employees, about 15,000 work in
California.</TE>

<TE>   California Dealt Blow on Power Costs</TE>
<TE>   A federal regulatory judge found that energy companies overcharged
California utilities by $1.8 billion during the electricity crisis --
far short of the $9 billion that Gov. Gray Davis and others had
demanded. According to the finding, it's the power suppliers that are
owed money -- $1.2 billion for unpaid bills.</TE>
<TE>   The initial finding by Judge Bruce Birchman of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission sparked angry denunciations from California
officials. "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rigged the
rules," Davis said at a news conference in Sacramento. "They threw
out just about everything we could claim."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he would continue to press the state's case before
FERC, in the political arena and in the courts. He said he would
write to President Bush demanding that FERC "do the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the setback, Davis promised that utility rates to
California consumers would fall within 24 months with the decline of
financing charges for emergency power purchases by the state. And he
emphasized that any refunds from generators would be used to further
reduce consumers' bills.</TE>

<TE>   Worries Spark Gold Rush; Stocks Fall</TE>
<TE>   The specter of war, terrorism and the use of nuclear weapons sent
gold near three-year highs at the end of the week with jittery
investors looking ready to chase the precious metal still higher as
2002 draws to a close.</TE>
<TE>   Spot gold rose to $335.25, bringing the three-year-old high at
$338 firmly into traders' sights. It is up about 20% in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, U.S. stock indexes fell for a second week. The S&amp;P 500
and Dow lost 2.5% and Nasdaq 4.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil rose to an eight-week high as a nationwide strike aimed
at ousting Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez limits shipments to
refineries from the world's fifth-biggest oil exporter.</TE>

<LD>Davis Not Running</LD>
<LD>   In spite of the fact that California has rung up a $21-billion
deficit (and still growing) on his watch, Gov. Gray Davis nixed a run
for the presidency in 2004, saying he wants to "leave this state
better off than I found it" (Dec. 11). Does Jay Leno write his stuff?</LD>
<LD>   John L. Brodhead Sr.</LD>
<TE>   La Canada</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So Davis isn't going to run for president. I guess in that case I
should publicly announce that I'm no longer a candidate for the Nobel
Peace Prize. I'm certain that we both had about the same chance of
winning.</TE>

<HD>Manzanar Restoration a Step Toward Honesty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Reassembling a Sad Chapter of History," Dec. 11: Hats off to the
National Park Service for taking a small step to restore the dignity
of the U.S. For years we took conflicting, hypocritical positions by
demanding that the nations that lost World War II preserve prisoner
of war and concentration camps as memorials, while we sought to erase
all evidence of our own abuses. While it may be accurate to conclude
that the "internment" of American citizens of foreign ancestry in
"camps" was triggered by a genuine, national, hysterical fear of
invasion, the inescapable fact is that we consciously decided to
curtail the freedom of certain classes of American citizens. Later,
instead of honestly acknowledging our past, we tried to pretend it
never happened.</LD>
<LD>   The restoration of Manzanar is a step toward honesty and truth. I
believe that this country is capable of true greatness. I also
believe that our country is making some serious mistakes in foreign
policy these days and that the bluster, double talk, deception and
rhetoric of misdirection practiced by our national leaders of all
stripes undermine the ability of the people to think critically,
weaken the heart or will or soul of the people and, ultimately,
undermine this country's potential for greatness. In this context, a
little straightforwardness, a little honesty, is like a tonic.</LD>

<TE>   Thank you for that picture worth a thousand words. And it is so
timely to remind us of sad Manzanar ... today, when once again our
Constitution is under assault in the pursuit of a false security. Let
us pause and think twice about what America is supposed to be about,
what we can be at our best and what the Constitution promises us all
-- and the world.</TE>

class he would have been treated to my commemorative Haiku poem on
Manzanar and a photo, which I include when covering World War II or
during Asian/Pacific American Heritage month (May).</TE>

<TE>   It is interesting that Manzanar camp is being rebuilt (partially).
This is a sad part of our history, but one that should not be
forgotten. One piece of literature that was not mentioned in the
article is a fine book by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston and James D.
Houston called "Farewell to Manzanar." It is a firsthand account of
her time in the camp.</TE>
<TE>   I am an English teacher at Santa Maria High School, and we
regularly use this book as part of our world literature class. The
students are often quite surprised to read this true story. Other
good accounts of Manzanar are a couple of shows done by Huell Howser
for PBS, which I use in the classroom as supplemental material.</TE>

<LD>Re "Anti-Islam Rhetoric Undercuts Moderates," Commentary, Dec. 11:
Having traveled to Egypt and Turkey, I know that believing in the
Islamic faith does not mean that one is vicious or violent. But such
everyday peaceful lives are sadly overshadowed by events like the
senseless violence in Nigeria over the Miss World pageant. Until
there is a vocal condemnation across the Islamic world of the fringe
minority who are filled with ignorance and hate -- of those in the
Islamic world who take out of context the words of the Koran -- there
will be a justification of those on the other side who deride Islam.
Moderation comes with proof in action, not from words.</LD>
<LD>   Barry J. Klazura</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I appreciated Salam Al-Marayati's commentary. All too often, the
religion of Islam is itself a casualty when violent acts committed by
marginalized fanatics are reported in the press. A religion that has
1.2 billion adherents worldwide has a complex demography. Failing to
take this into account when reporting isolated acts of violence by a
few self-proclaimed Muslims only serves to foster the "us versus
them" mentality.</TE>
<TE>   Arshad M. Khan</TE>
<TE>   Chino Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Al-Marayati is using the constitutional right of free speech to
criticize the discussion of Muslims and the Koran in the U.S. This is
a luxury not found in Muslim countries, where criticism of the Koran
can and does lead to physical harm.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Myers</TE>
<TE>   Downey</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Al-Marayati cites Numbers 31:17, which says: "Now kill all the
boys and all the women who have had sexual intercourse."</TE>
<TE>   The implication of his citing this biblical passage is that the
way that Numbers mandated the killing of boys and women who had had
sexual intercourse is comparable to the violence that all
right-thinking people deplore when it is perpetrated by Islamic
militants.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the violent response mandated by Numbers 31:17 was a
response to the plan by the Midianites to undermine the Israelites by
making them commit harlotry with their women. The women were not
innocent bystanders but part of a scheme to destroy the Israelites.
The reason God commands Moses to kill all the women who had had
sexual intercourse is because these women had been at the forefront
of the campaign to destroy the Israelites.</TE>

<HD>Don't Build Belmont on Racial Fault Lines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While we agree with Frank del Olmo's conclusion that a scaled-down
Belmont Learning Center should probably be completed on the portion
of the site not cut through by earthquake faults, his insinuation of
an Anglo conspiracy to prevent completion of a badly needed school is
counterproductive and insulting ("Belmont: Faults, but Still Needed,"
Commentary, Dec. 8).</LD>
<LD>   The history of Belmont is terribly unfortunate, marked by
extremely bad luck and ineptitude. But Del Olmo's thinly veiled
accusation of racism (that "a school would have been finished years
ago ... if the student body were predominantly Anglo rather than
mostly Latino"), disguised as the view of some "frustrated parents --
not to mention angry students and impatient political activists,"
does nothing constructive and irresponsibly inflames the issue.</LD>
<LD>   If the school is ultimately built on the site, it should be
because that is the best solution for all involved, not because Del
Olmo wants to see "a gesture of good faith to a community that has
been badly served by [Los Angeles Unified School District] decision
makers."</LD>
<TE>   It is unlikely that Belmont will ever be completed as long as the
racial divide is allowed to run deeper than the fault running beneath
the half-built school.</TE>

<LD>Re "Cheney Wins, Public Loses," editorial," Dec. 11: Does the
Pentagon develop military strategy in public? No. For that matter,
does The Times develop editorial policy in public? Again, no.</LD>
<LD>   While you may criticize the administration for not looking at all
sides of the issues of energy policy, asking its members to make
public the discussions held during the development of that policy is
just as wrongheaded as letting me sit in on your board of directors
meetings.</LD>

<HD>Navigating City Hall Is No Walk in the Park</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I recently moved to Los Angeles from San Francisco and visited City
Hall, looking forward to visiting my councilman's office.
Unfortunately, a "police state" mentality made the visit a big
disappointment. I took the Metro to the Civic Center and approached
the building's grand front entrance. There I was told that only city
employees and not regular citizens could use that entrance. Common
transit-riding folk have to awkwardly schlep around to the back of
the building. Passing through the metal detector, my belt buckle
sounded the alarm. I was waved through without any further type of
search.</LD>
<LD>   Then I, like all visitors, was required to show a driver's license
and write down my name and destination in the building. Finally, I
was branded with a visitor's badge. All of this in a building that
was built as a temple to democracy. The sign-in and ID procedures are
an affront to civil liberties. I'm sure some people find them
outright intimidating. And no, post-Sept. 11 security hysteria is not
a good excuse.</LD>
<TE>   Once residents clear the metal detector they should be able to
conduct city business as they need to without signing in with the
police. City halls throughout America were built to serve people who
need help from their local governments. San Francisco's, for example,
was specifically designed as a "palace for the people." The intrusive
security system at City Hall obviously serves its employees well.
Maybe it can be reconfigured and rethought to meet the needs of the
people who use and pay for it.</TE>

<LD>I found it interesting that in your Dec. 11 issue, most of the A
section of the paper was dedicated to terrorism, the Middle East and
homeland security. Yet buried on Page A29 was a small article
indicating that Consumer Reports magazine had announced its findings
that 42% of 484 fresh broiler chickens tested contained deadly
campylobacter bacteria and 12% of the chickens contained salmonella
-- rather alarming statistics.</LD>
<LD>   It would seem to me that more people in the U.S. will probably die
from food poisoning than from terror attacks in the coming years.
Perhaps the Bush administration could allocate a tiny portion of the
huge homeland security budget to help combat this other threat to the
American public. Or maybe we simply need to establish the Office of
Poultry Defense?</LD>

<AU>Gregory J. Boyle</AU>
<BD>Gregory J. Boyle is a Jesuit priest and executive
director of Homeboy Industries.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have lost too many friends to gang violence not to want Chief
William Bratton to succeed in his bid to stop the recent epidemic of
killing. But judging from his statements so far, it's clear that the
gang issue in Los Angeles is unlike anything he has encountered in
his career. The chief seems to have bought into many of the same old
myths about gangs that have been circulating for years. Maybe it's
time to clear up some things -- for the chief and for the rest of the
city.</LD>
<LD>   First, it's important to understand the difference between gang
members and gangbangers. As he began his new job, Bratton reminded
his rank and file that they were "outnumbered 10 to 1." There are
"100,000 gangbangers out there," he said. Not so.</LD>
<LD>   Those of us who work with gangs know that, though all gangbangers
are gang members, not all gang members "bang." Gangbangers commit
illegal acts -- from misdemeanors like writing on walls to felonies,
including murder. Only a small percentage of the estimated 100,000
gang members in Los Angeles are responsible for illegal gang
activity. Let's remember, there have been upward of 300 gang-related
homicides thus far this year, which means that only a fraction of a
percent of gang members are killing people. If police can understand
that their job is to isolate those gang members who "bang," they'll
find themselves not as outnumbered as they think.</LD>
<TE>   Another persistent myth is that of the "multigenerational" gang
member, which views gangs as family dynasties in which the mantle is
passed from father to son. Certainly, there are a few gang members
whose fathers -- even grandfathers -- were members of the same gang.
But those cases are few. Nearly 1,000 gang members a month, from all
over Los Angeles County, walk through our doors at Homeboy
Industries, and the rarest find is this multigenerational gang
member. Failing to understand this deprives police of some of their
best allies: parents of gang members, most of whom would like nothing
more than to help their children find a productive path.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the myth of the "gang associate." This
designation is officially given to kids who come to the attention of
law enforcement but can't be linked to any gang. Once given, the
label is hard to shake, appearing in law enforcement databases and
station-house files. But ask any gang member in the county about
these gang associates and you'll get blank stares. You're either a
gang member (initiated into the gang by being "jumped in") or you're
not. But for decades, law enforcement hasn't known what to do with
the teenage neighbor or young cousin seen standing and talking with a
gang member, and so they have invented this label.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton has said he's going to fight gangs the way East Coast law
enforcement has fought the Mafia. But our gangs don't fit the
organized crime model. At best, they belong in the category of
"disorganized crime." Prosecutors have tried and largely failed to
use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO,
to go after L.A. gangs. Gangs rarely have a Tony Soprano-type leader.
There are members with more "juice" or influence than others. But if
gangs are run at all, they are only loosely managed by an
ever-changing politburo or informal "board of directors" that is
fluid and unstable.</TE>
<TE>   Alarm bells have been sounded recently about "spoons" -- parolees
who return to the street and "stir things up" there. Certainly, these
folks exist. But for every spoon, I can name hundreds of gang member
parolees who have walked into my office seeking a job or free tattoo
removal. These men and women have gotten no job training in prison,
and nothing awaits them when they hit the streets (so no one ought to
be surprised by California's 71% recidivism rate -- the highest in
the country). Still the spoons are few, and they are easily
identified and isolated.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department has also railed about the prison
influence being exerted on gangs. But of the gang-related homicides
this year, I'd wager that none was orchestrated from within prison
walls. Gang violence is usually random and impulsive. To insist that
gang members are puppets manipulated on the streets by prisoners
behind the walls is to not acknowledge the intrinsically haphazard
nature of gang violence and the utter despair it reflects.</TE>
<TE>   So what can be done? First, if the chief wants communities to
participate in the policing of the streets, as he's been urging them
to do, he has to change his approach. People in poor urban parts of
Los Angeles often don't cooperate with the police because they don't
know the police. Officers rarely work in the same community long
enough for residents to get to know them -- and vice versa. Unless
Bratton turns the incentive system on its head and pays officers to
stay put rather than "promote out," people will continue to feel
reluctant to cooperate or come forward with vital information. And
since human beings seem less likely to demonize people they know,
keeping officers in our communities for longer stretches is healthier
all around.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton has identified gang members as the enemy and declared war
against them. How many failed law enforcement attempts to effectively
deal with gangs have begun with the same battle cry? The problem in
declaring war on gangs is that you end up viewing the city and its
residents in battlefield terms. Families are seen as harboring the
enemy. Police become an occupying army, resorting to tactics like
planting evidence and using excessive force because, after all, all's
fair in war.</TE>
<TE>   The chief and his new gang czar, Capt. Michael Hillmann, are smart
enough to know that their efforts form only one-third of a city's
response to gangs. Prevention and intervention are the other
two-thirds of what has to be a cooperative effort. It is the job of
the mayor and other city leaders to bring hope to our despondent,
poor communities. It is the chief's job to keep the streets safe
until they do.</TE>
<TE>   The people of L.A. are less interested in getting angry about
gangs and more determined than ever to see law enforcement choose
smarter strategies in dealing with them. The whole city wishes the
new chief well. At the same time, we can only hope that this moment
marks a departure from our past failures in rhetoric and tactics.</TE>

Her new book is "Secret Agents: The Menace of Emerging Infections."</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>On Fox TV earlier this month, host Bill O'Reilly asked whether the
recent spate of cruise ship epidemics could have been "bacterial
sabotage." In doing so, he voiced a common fear in our new age of
global terrorism. But that tabloid-fed hypothesis is dangerously easy
and ignores century-old lessons of public health.</LD>
<LD>   Suspicions about bioterrorism are understandable. After all, a
bona fide act of bioterrorism -- the anthrax attacks of 2001 --
remains unsolved. The largest previous case of bioterrorism in the
United States, in which 751 Oregon salad bar patrons came down with
salmonella food poisoning in 1984, went unsolved for a year until a
religious cult member questioned on unrelated matters unexpectedly
confessed to the crime.</LD>
<LD>   But the culprit in the cruise ship outbreaks, Norwalk virus, is
one of the most infectious and contagious germs around. It doesn't
need deliberate human assistance to spread; like the common cold, it
gets around quite well on its own.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, Norwalk virus and its close relations are the most
frequent cause of food-borne illness in this country, responsible for
an estimated 23 million cases each year. So hardy and transmissible
is the virus that it stars in two classic episodes in the modern
annals of public health.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the virus scored big at a college football game between
Duke and Florida State. The Duke players had eaten
Norwalk-contaminated food at their training center before traveling
to Tallahassee for the game. Around kickoff time, they started to
suffer the same graphic symptoms as the hapless cruise ship
vacationers. By the end of the game, 64 players from both teams were
infected.</TE>
<TE>   An even more dramatic outbreak took place in 1982, when a
Minnesota bakery worker ill with Norwalk virus used his bare hands
and arms to stir a batch of butter-cream frosting. This unusual
culinary technique left some 3,000 pastry lovers in gastronomic
distress.</TE>
<TE>   If the recent cruise ship epidemics demonstrate anything, it's how
modern life -- not malign saboteurs -- gives emerging pathogens
entree to new niches around the globe and inside our bodies. So many
aspects of our culture -- from where we live to where we play, from
how we raise livestock to how we raise children, from invasive
medical technologies to high-speed transportation -- are changing in
ways that create more intersections between us and the bugs.</TE>
<TE>   Vacation cruises, we now know, are perfect breeding grounds for
Norwalk virus, the flu virus and other organisms. Building new homes
amid second-growth forests has given us Lyme disease. Lifesaving
chest catheters have spread drug-resistant Staphylococcus bacteria.
Global travel has brought old scourges like mosquito-borne yellow
fever and malaria to our shores. And yet it's also true that, against
this backdrop of ever-emerging infections, an intentionally planted
epidemic might be hard to distinguish from a natural disease
outbreak.</TE>
<TE>   Today more than ever, public health officials are primed to take
notice if lots of people suddenly become ill from a single disease
agent or suffer pulmonary symptoms (suggesting an aerosolized
microorganism or toxin); if large numbers of victims are afflicted
with a pathogen not previously seen in their geographic area; or if
several deadly epidemics erupt simultaneously. But these same
criteria also describe recent high-profile outbreaks with natural
causes -- outbreaks that looked at first like bioterrorism but proved
not to be.</TE>
<TE>   The 1976 epidemic of a fatal respiratory infection at an American
Legion convention in Philadelphia, for instance, had all the
hallmarks of a deliberate chemical or biological attack -- especially
because it took months to identify the bacterium that caused what we
now know as Legionnaires' disease.</TE>
<TE>   HIV/AIDS in Africa in the 1980s, dengue fever in Cuba in 1981,
pneumonic plague in India in 1994, foot-and-mouth disease in hogs in
Taiwan in 1997, Nipah virus among animals and humans in Malaysia and
Singapore in 1998, West Nile virus in New York City in 1999,
foot-and-mouth disease in Britain and Europe in 2001: All at some
point were suspected of having been deliberately introduced.</TE>
<TE>   Precisely because charges of bioterrorism are so easily hurled
today, we need a robust global public health system that can protect
against both natural and premeditated epidemics. A few days before
O'Reilly's show, the World Health Organization launched an emergency
fund to dispatch aid within 24 hours anywhere large-scale infectious
disease breaks out, whether naturally spawned or intentionally sown.
Fittingly, the fund's seed money came from the Nuclear Threat
Initiative, Ted Turner and former Sen. Sam Nunn's charitable group
working to halt global trafficking in weapons of mass destruction.
The group's rationale for the contribution: The same measures needed
to defend against and defuse bioterrorism are those needed to contain
normally evolving infections that can swiftly turn into global
nightmares.</TE>
<TE>   Bioterrorism is a growing peril. As the number of people with
expertise in microbiology and molecular biology increases, so will
the small fraction willing to use their skills to destructive ends.
But the recent cruise ship outbreaks, however distressing to those on
board, shouldn't raise undue suspicions or skew our perspective.</TE>
<TE>   In nations where the populace cannot afford cruises, infectious
disease stubbornly ranks as the top killer. Despite today's
headlines, the most talented bioterrorist remains nature itself.</TE>

<HD>Iran Holds Postwar Dilemma for U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Mackey</AU>
<BD>Sandra Mackey is the author of "The Reckoning: Iraq and
the Legacy of Saddam Hussein."</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is reportedly weaving an Iraqi Islamist group
and its patron, the Islamic Republic of Iran, into the web of war it
is wrapping around Saddam Hussein. The development suggests that
President Bush has effectively removed Iran from the "axis of evil"
for the greater good of taking down Hussein. The administration's
apparent embrace of Ayatollah Mohammed Bakr Hakim, the Islamic
group's leader, also sets the stage for a crucial foreign-policy
choice that will affect long-term U.S. goals in the Persian Gulf.</LD>
<LD>   Since the end of World War II, U.S. foreign policy has played,
first, Iran against Iraq, then, Iraq against Iran. During the 1960s
and 1970s, when the Soviet Union was seeking influence in the Persian
Gulf by delivering weapons to Baghdad, the United States armed the
shah of Iran with some of the best weapons in its arsenal and
appointed him policeman of the gulf. After the 1979 Iranian
revolution and Hussein's 1980 invasion of Iran, it was Iraq that
became the beneficiary of U.S. affections. That ended when Hussein
invaded Kuwait, kindling the 1991 Gulf War.</LD>
<TE>   In its first term, the Clinton administration broke the pattern.
Declaring both Iran and Iraq rogue regimes, it unfurled the policy of
"dual containment." The United States would deal with neither the
mullahs in Tehran nor the tyrant in Baghdad until each rejected
policies the U.S. found objectionable. But during Clinton's second
term, the frustrations of containing Hussein, coupled with the
apparent softening of the Iranian revolution, led to a series of
efforts to repair relations with Iran. Bush's apparent interest in
Hakim as an ally suggests he has chosen that path again.</TE>
<TE>   Hakim is the religious leader of several million Shiite Muslims
who live in southern Iraq along the border with Iran. He was among
the Iraqi clerics who fled to Iran during Hussein's repression of the
Shiites during the Iran-Iraq War. In 1982, he founded the Supreme
Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. The Iranian government
protected and heavily subsidized Hakim, even allowing him to create a
military force called the Badr Brigade. That makes his council the
only Iraqi opposition group other than the Kurds in command of any
military power.</TE>
<TE>   Hakim, the United States and Iran certainly share a common
interest in deposing Hussein. Washington views the tyrant of Baghdad
as a dire threat to U.S. national security. Hakim seeks both revenge
against Hussein for past grievances and the opportunity to secure
territory in Iraq from which to prepare for the struggle for control
of post-Hussein Iraq. The regime in Iran regards Hussein as a dark
menace on the border, one that invaded the country.</TE>
<TE>   A bonus for the mullahs would be that the United States, in
ridding Iraq of Hussein, would also rid Tehran of the Moujahedeen
Khalq (People's Holy Warriors), an Iranian group with a bizarre
ideology that mixes Marxism and Islam. The Moujahedeen, which stages
periodic raids across the border from its bases in Iraq, represents
the only armed opposition to the regime in Tehran.</TE>
<TE>   In light of the reported contacts between Hakim and Washington, it
seems that Iran wants to work with the United States to oust Hussein.
The two countries are already cooperating to stem the flow of illegal
Iraqi oil through the Persian Gulf, and Iran offered help in the U.S.
campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan by pledging to rescue
downed American pilots. It all adds up to the best opportunity since
the 1979 revolution for the United States and Iran to reopen
relations.</TE>
<TE>   Whether that happens will largely depend on how the administration
proceeds against Hussein. If U.S. military power is sent into Iraq
this winter without a mandate from the United Nations, Iran will have
little choice but to retreat into hostility toward the U.S. Iranians
across the political and theological spectrum share a powerful sense
of nationalism. Its emotional appeal is what saved Iran from defeat
by Hussein. Nationalism was one of the core causes of the Iranian
revolution. Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi fell not only because of the
absolutism of his regime but also because most Iranians perceived him
to be subordinating Iran to the United States. More than two decades
since the revolution, the potency of Iranian nationalism has not
diminished.</TE>
<TE>   Iranian independence and identity would be threatened by the
presence of American troops on its border, a given in the
administration's war scenario. It's a reality the Bush administration
must comprehend as it plots its war strategy. The mere sight of U.S.
occupation forces on the ground in what Iran regards as its
geographical and historical frontyard is likely to inflame Iranian
nationalism, and the longer their stay, the more severe the possible
reaction. With the opportunity to engage Iran sacrificed, the United
States would have little choice but to weigh occupied Iraq against
belligerent Iran.</TE>
<TE>   The high-wire balancing act between Iran and Iraq that the United
States has practiced for more than 40 years has never been good
policy. It has ignored the obvious truth that the Persian Gulf is a
region. One side is Arab, the other Persian. To ensure the free flow
of oil at reasonable prices in the gulf, the primary U.S. goal since
1973, the United States needs both Iraq and Iran.</TE>
<TE>   This geopolitical necessity is yet another in a long and somber
list of reasons why the United States needs to think long and hard
before toppling Hussein in a solo act. Even the world's only
superpower cannot escape the real risk that quick invasions can
become long occupations. And temporary allies can too easily become
long-term enemies.</TE>

<HD>Forget the 'Youth Menace': Crime, It Turns Out, Is a
Grown-Up Business</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Males</AU>
<BD>Mike Males, senior researcher for the Center on
Juvenile and Criminal Justice, teaches sociology at UC Santa Cruz.</BD>
<DL>SANTA CRUZ</DL>
<LD>The murder rate in Los Angeles is up. And a new report from Choices
for Youth and the California Wellness Foundation suggests why --
youth violence. "This is an epidemic" involving youths ages 10
through 17, said Choices for Youth director Laurie Kappe.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Police Department Deputy Chief Ronald Bergmann urged
more "aggressive curfew and truancy enforcement" to take "young
victims" and "possible [suspects] off the streets." Deputy City Atty.
Anthony Koutris called the problem of kids carrying guns
"overwhelming."</LD>
<LD>   But reports on the LAPD's official Web page detailing several
hundred homicides tell a different story. Even amid the increase in
murders this year in the city, the number of juveniles committing
homicide is down sharply. Barring a calamitous next two weeks, fewer
L.A. juveniles under age 18 will be arrested in homicide cases in
2002 than the 49 arrested last year, and far fewer than the average
of 150 arrested annually in the 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   The relatively low number of juvenile arrests does not stem from
aggressive curfew enforcement. The LAPD's own studies, as well as
others', show that curfews don't reduce crime or protect youths.
Police reports show that 47 L.A. juveniles have been murdered so far
this year -- most, apparently, by grown-ups. The suspects listed on
the LAPD Web site accused of murdering youths under age 18 are all
adults.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles murder suspects, overall, are considerably older than
in the past. In the 1990s, two-thirds of the murder suspects were
under age 25; in 2002, fewer than half are.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, police and community leaders in Oakland, which is also
suffering from a sharp rise in homicides, blamed youth violence. Yet,
as in L.A., police tabulations show that murder suspects in Oakland
are older. Only three teenagers have been arrested in murder cases in
that city this year, far below the average of 10 to 12 a year in the
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The reflex to blame youths stems from the conventional theory
that, as UCLA management professor James Q. Wilson puts it, "a
'critical mass' of young persons ... creates an explosive increase in
the amount of crime." This is not true today, if it ever was.
Correlations of crime rates and the proportion of America's
population ages 14-24 -- the "crime-prone" age group -- over the last
three decades show that years and states with higher percentages of
young males suffered considerably fewer murders and other violent
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Reliance on antiquated demographic myths has generated absurdly
wrong predictions and futilely repressive policies against younger
and poorer groups.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, forecasts by Northeastern University criminologist James
Alan Fox and former Manhattan Institute senior fellow John J. DiIulio
Jr. that teen population growth would spawn hordes of "adolescent
superpredators" and a "teenage crime storm" provoked sensational
headlines: "Teenage Time Bombs" (Time magazine); "Wild in the
Streets" (Newsweek); "The Coming Mayhem" (Los Angeles Times).</TE>
<TE>   The dire predictions proved false. There were 60,000 fewer youth
homicide, rape, robbery and assault arrests in 2001 than in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the evidence debunks it, the dogma that "demography is
destiny" and "more teens means more crime" prevails. National law
enforcement and academic experts recently surveyed by the Washington
Post attributed the upsurge in the 2001 crime rate to an "increase in
the teenage population ... the age group most likely to commit
crimes." Fox warned in an August 2002 Urban Institute report that
"the youth population is now beginning to grow [particularly among
minorities]," threatening "renewed problems of youth violence."</TE>
<TE>   Is obtuseness a job qualification for crime experts? The U.S. teen
population has risen by 3 million since 1990 -- and compared with
1990, murders in 2001 dropped by 7,500, violent crimes by 400,000 and
property crimes by 2 million. FBI crime-clearance figures released in
October showed youths last year account for just 5% of the nation's
homicides and 12% of its violent crimes, the lowest percentages on
record.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't just conservatives who perpetrate demographic fallacies.
Recently, Marc Mauer, assistant director of the liberal Sentencing
Project, contended that legislation mandating longer prison sentences
for repeat offenders such as three-strikes laws "has contributed to a
rapid aging of the California prison system" by locking up older
convicts "whose crime production was already on the decline." Mauer
declared that crime was better controlled by imprisoning young
people, the "known offenders."</TE>
<TE>   But this is wrong on all counts. The prison population's aging
isn't because of three-strikes laws. It results from two obvious, yet
ignored, long-term trends: skyrocketing felony arrests and recidivism
among older felons, and declining crime among younger groups.</TE>
<TE>   Figures from the California Criminal Justice Statistics Center
show that in 1980 about 25,000 Californians ages 40 and older were
arrested in felony cases; in 2001, 92,000. Prison admissions of
felons ages 40 and older rose from 1,200 in 1980 to nearly 9,000 in
2001. An additional 27,000 California parole violators over age 40
were returned to prison in 2001, five times more than in the 1980s.
Nearly all of California's over-40 prison population was sentenced
for offenses committed within the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, felony arrests of California teens plunged from 148,000
in 1980 to 106,000 in 2001, topping national declines. Yet, because
crime authorities rigidly insist that adults "age out of their
crime-prone years" by 30, the graying of America's criminals has gone
mostly unnoticed. In 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention finally broke the
official silence: "Juvenile superpredators are more myth than
reality," it declared. "The age group with the greatest increase in
violent crime arrest rates is persons in their 30s and 40s."</TE>
<TE>   The middle-aged crime scourge is devastating. Prisons across the
United States, especially in California, overflow with aging addicts,
burglars, embezzlers and domestic abusers. California -- which spent
$1.3 billion in 2001 caging inmates older than 40 -- and the rest of
the nation remain woefully unprepared to manage mushrooming numbers
of older convicts whose health costs may be staggering.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of tougher sentences and cutbacks in prison
rehabilitation services failed to anticipate today's murder and
violence surge, as tens of thousands of parolees are released every
year without drug treatment or job prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, crime and law enforcement authorities continue to
repeat the same alarmism that teenagers, particularly dark-skinned
ones, augur more crime. Yes, blaming unpopular demographic groups is
routine, wins funding and shields policymakers from accountability
for ineffective strategies. But crime authorities' elevation of
anti-youth prejudice over science and their warping of data to fit
ideological ends remain a disservice to California and the nation
that can only be termed criminal.</TE>

<BD>Harold Meyerson is editor at large of the American
Prospect and political editor of LA Weekly.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>On that dull gray morning after, when official Washington awoke to
the news that Ol' Trent had gone and shot off his mouth again at Ol'
Strom's centenary toot, it just wasn't no big deal. Official
Washington had always known that the mental landscape of Trent Lott,
like that of incoming House Republican leader Tom DeLay, wasn't
suitable for inspection by small children or swing voters, what with
Lott's loyalties to old-time Mississippi and DeLay's periodic
assertions that the United States was, love it or leave it, a
Christian nation.</LD>
<LD>   Now that Lott's tenure as majority leader hangs by a thread, it's
important to recall the initial indifference of the bipartisan
Beltway establishment to remarks that should have been met with
instantaneous outrage. But Lott and DeLay were old news. Who really
cared about their inner lives?</LD>
<TE>   What mattered was that these guys ran the Congress: They moved the
appropriations bills, saw to the interests of home-state concerns
like WorldCom (from Lott's Mississippi) and Enron (from DeLay's
Texas), blocked any chance for real prescription drug coverage and
threatened big businesses that dared to write checks to the
occasional Democrat. They were pols; they were pros. If Lott wanted
to think the country "wouldn't have had all these problems over all
these years" if it had just voted for a rabid segregationist instead
of Harry S. Truman, well, that didn't really affect what he did in
his job, did it? Besides, he was talking about 1948. In this city of
the five-minute news cycle, who cared about 1948? No harm, no foul.</TE>
<TE>   Truth be told, official Washington is largely inured to right-wing
excess. After more than 30 years of Republican rightward drift --
beginning with the party's bid to attract segregationist Democrats in
the mid-'60s and continuing through Ronald Reagan's supply-side
revolution, Newt Gingrich's "contract with America" and now President
Bush's drive to enrich the rich at all costs -- the GOP's radicalism
has become just another part of the Washington scenery.</TE>
<TE>   Since the mid-'90s, all the Republicans' congressional leaders,
save only current House speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, have
been Southerners, promoting a harsher conservatism than anything even
Reagan contemplated. Bush shares their right-wing zealousness, though
by masquerading brilliantly as a moderate he has given the entire
movement a renewed air of respectability. Lott is a pillar of this
new conservative order, so he can't really be a lunatic -- can he? So
what if he voices fond memories of the dank, segregationist South?</TE>
<TE>   Initially, then, those inside the Beltway acted as if nothing had
happened. For several days silence reigned on both sides of the
aisle, until the tenacity of a few reporters raised the incident to
such prominence that the stench was impossible to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most disgraceful reaction, and certainly the most
bewildering, came from Lott's Democratic counterpart, Tom Daschle.
"There are a lot of times when he and I go to the microphone and
would like to say things we meant to say differently, and I'm sure
this was one of those cases for him," Daschle said.</TE>
<TE>   How's that again? I understand that there's a code of professional
courtesy that operates between the leaders; I didn't realize it
extended to ignoring affirmations of America's apartheid past.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle's willingness to give Lott a pass on this one is an
extreme illustration of how defensive, denatured and defanged the
Democratic establishment has become. Lott's remarks were an affront
not merely to America's racially egalitarian values but to the
bedrock principles of the modern Democratic Party. Coming on the
heels of the November election in which the Democrats lost the Senate
in large part because they ran on the narrowest of messages and
affirmed no basic Democratic principles, Daschle's silence should be
grounds for ending his tenure as party leader, too. A Democratic
leader who fails to realize that the Republican leader has just
offended the moral sense of the nation has forfeited his claim to the
job.</TE>
<TE>   There's no sharper contrast in American politics today than that
between the Democrats' initial failure to chastise Lott and the
Republicans' glee in attacking incoming Democratic House leader Nancy
Pelosi. The "latte-sipping" San Francisco Democrat was said to
personify "a lurch to the left" (in the New Republic's assessment)
that would doom the Democrats. She was bashed for coming from a
district that was home to a large number of gays. She was attacked
for having organized her party's opposition in the House to the
resolution authorizing Bush to go to war against Iraq without United
Nations sanction -- never mind that most Americans don't want the
U.S. to go to war without the U.N.'s blessing. It's worth noting that
hunting season on Pelosi began well before she had so much as opened
her mouth to say anything about where she'd take her party.</TE>
<TE>   The double standard here is overpowering. Did anyone suggest that
the Republicans were handicapped because their Senate leader came
from a state that was the historical (and quite possibly,
present-day) home to a higher percentage of white racists than any
other? That DeLay's stated and restated belief that the U.S. is and
should remain a Christian nation might just imperil the Republicans
in this increasingly diverse and tolerant land?</TE>
<TE>   Yet Democratic Party leaders have declined to attack Lott and
DeLay for their extremism -- until, in Lott's case, the spreading
outrage finally was heard in the party's innermost sanctums.</TE>
<TE>   The initial Republican silence at Lott's comments was
understandable, of course -- and not just because the GOP hoped the
embarrassment would pass without notice. Lott's disastrous stroll
down memory lane uncovered an entire history that the Republicans
would greatly prefer to keep under wraps. It returned the Republicans
to that fateful moment when they embraced the radical segregationist
South, which, in the summer of 1964, was in full flight from a
Democratic Party whose chieftain, President Lyndon B. Johnson, had
just signed the Civil Rights Act. In recent days, DeLay has hastened
to note that a majority of Republican senators voted for that act.</TE>
<TE>   But today's Republican Party of Bush, Gingrich, Lott and DeLay has
its roots in the presidential campaign that year of Barry Goldwater,
who condemned the act fiercely, and in the efforts of Thurmond and
other die-hard segregationists to mobilize the racist right of the
Deep South into the Republican column. What Lott revealed was not
merely his nostalgia for the days of white rule and white sheets. It
was the conception -- in original sin -- of today's Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   But the modern Republican Party would rather not be reminded of
its origins -- that it was born, like Yeats' images, "in the foul
rag-and-bone shop of the heart." The GOP made a devil's pact with
white racism long ago in order to win elections. There was no
Republican outcry at Lee Atwater's Willie Horton ads or at Jesse
Helms' campaigns or at a host of other more subtle attempts to play
on white fears or depress black turnout.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Lott has bathed them all in their filth, the rage of the
non-Southern right-wingers is boundless. Conservatives of all
descriptions, from Rush Limbaugh to the Wall Street Journal's
editorialists, have rushed forward to cleanse themselves of Lott's
taint.</TE>
<TE>   For the few remaining Republican moderates in the Senate, Lott's
loose lips have presented an exquisite embarrassment and an electoral
peril. Peter Fitzgerald, the first-term Republican senator from
Illinois, faces a dicey reelection campaign two years hence. Can he
hope to win in a state with a large black population and a sizable
number of Republican moderates, after having voted for Lott for House
majority leader? Self-proclaimed moderate Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania, has already forgiven Lott, but there are Republican
colleagues to his left -- Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Gordon
Smith of Oregon, to name two -- who will make a mockery of all they
profess to stand for if they stick with Trent.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Rove, rest assured, doesn't care about the senators'
feelings, but if forcing them to vote for Lott as majority leader
means jeopardizing some Senate and House seats in '04 -- or, God
forbid, Bush's ability to carry Northern swing states -- then he has
probably already handed Lott a one-way ticket to a whites-only
Palookaville. No thanks to his Republican colleagues, or his
Democratic adversaries, or a weary and quiescent Beltway media, Lott
is becoming what he's always actually been: yesterday's news.</TE>

<AU>Susan E. Seager</AU>
<BD>Susan E. Seager is a 1st Amendment lawyer in Los
Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I got my first real job at Parker Center, the Los Angeles Police
Department's headquarters. Not as a cop; as a journalist working for
a local wire, City News Service. It was just a part-time job,
Saturdays only, but I wrote front-page news, about murders and
earthquakes and gangs.</LD>
<LD>   I loved the Parker Center press room the minute I walked in.
Hidden in the back corner of the first floor, it was an obstacle
course of gray metal desks piled high with old newspapers and white
paper printouts from chattering wire service machines. It was dusty
and hot. Police scanners squawked loudly in a code I didn't yet
understand.</LD>
<LD>   City News' veteran cop reporter, Norman "Jake" Jacoby, gruffly
showed me the ropes. He curtly taught me to listen to the police
radios and to call, at least once each shift, the watch commander at
all the divisions of the LAPD, the L.A. County Sheriff's Department
and suburban police departments. I learned later that his crankiness
had nothing to do with me; he talked the same way to the cops, too.</LD>
<TE>   For the year or so that I worked at Parker Center, first with City
News and later as a full-time reporter for United Press
International, I was at the center of some of the city's most
traumatic events, from the capture of "Night Stalker" serial murderer
Richard Ramirez to the arson fires that blackened the historic
Central Library -- twice. Once, on a hunch, I asked a homicide
detective whether a single killer might have been responsible for a
seemingly unconnected series of murders and rapes of women in their
homes in the San Gabriel Valley. "Could be," came the reply. It
wasn't until many killings later that law enforcement told the public
what police authorities had known for a while: A drifter from Texas
named Ramirez was the Night Stalker.</TE>
<TE>   Even after I left the cop beat, the LAPD dominated stories I
wrote, including the trials of the officers charged with beating
Rodney King. I'll never forget hearing an LAPD official testifying
that it was not excessive force to beat King because a reasonable
police officer would have interpreted his writhing movements on the
ground as offensive martial arts moves.</TE>
<TE>   Now they're talking about tearing down Parker Center -- an "aging"
building that is five years younger than Mayor James Hahn. I just
assumed someone would step forward and protest. It may not be
classically beautiful, with its modernist boxy shape, its blue-tiled
column supports, its no-comment windowless facade and tropical
blue-green glass flanking its sides. Named after Chief William H.
Parker, architect of the modern LAPD, the headquarters has been
featured as a backdrop in countless cop shows and movies. But more
important, it is a reminder of our tumultuous history with the LAPD
itself.</TE>
<TE>   "The Glass House" looks pristine in the black-and-white
photographs featured in the 1958 book "The Badge," written by
"Dragnet" creator Jack Webb. But on April 29, 1992, it was surrounded
by angry protesters and riot police in the wake of the news that the
officers who beat King had been acquitted of criminal charges in Simi
Valley. I was at home with a new baby that day, but I can just
picture then-Chief Daryl F. Gates leaving Parker Center that evening
to attend a political fund-raiser on the Westside even as he learned
of rioting across the city.</TE>
<TE>   My decidedly unsentimental spouse can't understand why I'm upset.
"What are you saying, that every building that you worked in should
be preserved?" he asked. I couldn't get a rise out of the Los Angeles
Conservancy, either. A staff member told me that the organization
could not take a position on Parker Center's threatened demise until
it conducted some research.</TE>
<TE>   A recent visit to what is now called the Norman 'Jake' Jacoby
Press Room revealed the same dusty, messy place I had left. UPI's
desk had been abandoned, its old police scanners cannibalized, its
printer unplugged. Al Leone, a City News reporter, told me that his
outfit and The Times are the only news outlets that still operate
desks in Parker Center. Someone created a little shrine on my old UPI
desk for Nieson Himmel, a Times police reporter who died in 1999.
Everyone liked Nieson. Sporting a headset long before Madonna, Nieson
had sources all over the Southland who tipped him off to small plane
crashes, gruesome murders, fires likely to become wildfires and
anything else that was newsworthy.</TE>
<TE>   On my former desk, someone had placed a stack of his old yellowed
newspapers, a dusty box of his business cards and photographs of him
with his ubiquitous reading glasses perched on his massive bald head.
Nieson's car was legendary. When I worked as a "copy boy" at The
Times, it was our ritual to spot his car parked on 1st Street, a
battered old sedan filled to the gills with newspapers, magazines and
cereal boxes, mainly Count Chocula. His house too was stacked floor
to ceiling with papers. Once it caught fire when he wasn't home. I
took the call when the Los Angeles City Fire Department called the
press room looking for him.</TE>
<TE>   I worked in Parker Center when the so-called war on drugs began in
earnest. Gates embraced it with fervor, announcing that the
department had created a military-style "battering ram" to aid in the
fight. The department rolled it out one night when I was on duty,
using it to break into a supposed "rock house" in South-Central Los
Angeles. They found only a minuscule amount of drugs, and no charges
were filed, but the house was destroyed. We dutifully reported the
bust we knew would make the evening news. The skepticism some of us
felt did not find its way into our dispatches.</TE>
<TE>   As time went on, I grew frustrated at the passiveness of the job.
I was dependent on the police to tell me the details of their cases.
After officer-involved shootings, the police narrative always seemed
to be the same. The individual was shot after an officer observed the
suspect reaching inside his clothing for "what appeared to be a shiny
metallic object" (which once turned out to be a can of hair spray) or
because "the suspect was fleeing officers and posed a threat to
others." One reporter used to joke grimly about "misdemeanor
homicides," slayings of people of color that produced scant attention
from the police, media or politicians.</TE>
<TE>   We mostly reported what the cops said and not much else. We didn't
have time; there was always another breaking police story or fire to
report. Our job was to listen to scanners and talk to police, not
seek out witnesses who might tell a different story. More than that,
it was part of our culture as cop reporters.</TE>
<TE>   But that too is part of the history of the LAPD, and it's embedded
in the walls of Parker Center. Buildings are witnesses to history.
Tear them down, and it is harder for all of us to remember our past
-- including our mistakes.</TE>

<HD>Serbs Fall Into Electoral Abyss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Lynne Tillou</AU>
<BD>Susan Lynne Tillou recently participated in the U.S.
electoral observation mission to Serbia. She has previously worked
for the United Nations mission in East Timor and twice with the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.</BD>
<DL>ZAJECAR, Serbia</DL>
<LD>The third time wasn't a political charm in Serbia. The cold and snow
didn't deter Serbs from casting their ballots, though the three
uninspiring presidential candidates may have been a good excuse to
stay home. But in last Sunday's elections, the third in as many
months, not enough Serbs -- a minium 50% of the eligible electorate
is required -- went to the polls to validate the outcome. As a
result, the Serbs failed to exercise their constitutional right to
directly elect their president.</LD>
<LD>   It was a major blow to democratic reforms begun after the Slobodan
Milosevic regime was toppled in 2000. Furthermore, the Serbs'
inability to directly elect their president signals that Serbia is
not yet ready to be considered seriously for membership in key
European organizations.</LD>
<LD>   Milosevic's handiwork during his last days in office is partly to
blame for Serbia's lack of progress toward becoming a democracy. The
former Yugoslav president crafted the electoral law that requires a
50% turnout in both first-round and runoff elections for president.
The constitution dictates that if the voters can't pick a leader,
parliament must.</LD>
<TE>   A primary factor limiting a majority turnout was the inaccurate
and out-of-date national voters' list, which served to inflate the
eligible electorate and make the 50% level virtually unattainable.
All political parties and observer groups agree that the list was
filled with names of the deceased and citizens now living abroad who
cannot vote because there is no provision for absentee balloting.
Some names were duplicated.</TE>
<TE>   The Serbian government claimed to have updated the voter list
since the previous two rounds of presidential balloting. But the list
was never made public. Registered voters were allowed to check for
their names on the list in their respective municipalities, but
candidates and observers -- even interested ministers in parliament
-- were barred from viewing the list, which is reportedly stored on a
computer in the central government's offices in Belgrade.</TE>
<TE>   The government's lack of transparency and inept handling of the
voter-list revisions damaged Belgrade's credibility and prompted some
domestic observer groups and political parties to conduct their own
surveys to determine how many ineligible names might be on the rolls.</TE>
<TE>   One local party representative in Zajecar told me that his party
had estimated that more than 600,000 voters, roughly 9% of the total
electorate, on the latest revised national list were invalid because
their names were obvious duplicates, unrecognizable at the municipal
level, of dead people and of Serbs living abroad for work. That's a
number that would have made the difference in reaching the threshold
for electoral validation.</TE>
<TE>   Another major factor limiting voter turnout was that none of the
candidates wooed the youth vote in the three rounds of presidential
voting, a stunning political mistake.</TE>
<TE>   This electoral group was probably the most influential in the
movement that ousted Milosevic in the 2000 elections and brought
about the opportunity for democratic reform. Through organized rock
concerts in major cities and other get-out-the-vote activities, the
youth in 2000 were mobilized and had a message. Today, while some
young people remain active in their parties, many are disenchanted
because most of the promises of reform in 2000 have not been kept.</TE>
<TE>   The parties' failure to target the youth vote illustrated the
general shallowness of the campaign. For the most part, candidates
simply stated their policies and sometimes criticized their rivals,
but never debated the issues. Serb Radical Party candidate Vojislav
Seselj's campaigning consisted mostly of graffiti messages on walls
of public buildings or sides of public buses. He held only two
campaign rallies.</TE>
<TE>   As one member of parliament described it, the candidates were like
"models walking down a catwalk: You either like the outfits they
present or you don't."</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of a president-elect, the speaker of the parliament
will be acting president until the body determines how it will select
the first Serb president since the disintegration of Yugoslavia.
There is already talk that ministers from the Democratic Party of
Serbia, the party of the Yugoslav president and front-running
candidate, might boycott a vote to approve the 2003 budget to show
their dissatisfaction. This would deepen the political differences
that have divided and immobilized the coalition government for
months. Salaries and pensions of government workers will be withheld
until the budget issue is resolved, which may further fan the flames
of labor unrest. Public workers have already rioted in the streets of
Belgrade to protest difficult privatization reforms slowly being put
into effect.</TE>
<TE>   Serbia's failure to directly elect a new president was not the
only setback last week in its quest to become a regional actor in
Europe. Vojislav Kostunica, the Yugoslav president, suggested -- in
comments later retracted -- that Yugoslavia would not cooperate with
The Hague in extraditing alleged war criminals. In addition, the U.S.
warned Serbia that it would regard any Serb violation of U.N.
sanctions against Iraq with the utmost seriousness, implying that the
country is still illegally exporting arms to Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Also last week, high hopes for a federation between Montenegro and
Serbia, the two remaining Yugoslav republics, were dashed when Kosovo
refused to be considered a part of any such union. The agreement,
backed by the European Union, could effectively put an end to the
decade-long breakup of Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Serbia can successfully integrate with the European
community, as have the former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia, Croatia
and Macedonia, hangs in the balance. Now more than ever, the U.S. and
the European Union need to remain engaged in the Balkans, and reward
those who are willing to make the difficult and unpopular decisions
for change.</TE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I have a terminal illness and bought a condo in a
50-year-old upscale development on the Westside because the hospital
and emergency services are within walking distance. I have a hefty
mortgage and large medical bills.</LD>
<LD>   Owners who purchased their condos decades ago are living next to
owners who recently paid more than half a million dollars for the
same unit. New owners are typically two-career families encumbered
with mortgages. Many of the older owners' condos are mortgage-free.</LD>
<LD>   I am one of the owners who paid nearly half a million dollars for
my unit. The early owners dominate board positions and keep raising
the monthly fees and control all expenditures.</LD>
<TE>   After trying to force me to move, the board decided to tent all
units for termites. Never before have these condos been tented. It
wasn't until the board learned of my illness that they planned to use
the chemical pest controls.</TE>
<TE>   The tenting method will seriously affect my immune system. Aside
from the tremendous inconvenience and added cost, physicians have
informed me if my unit is chemically treated, I could die. Still the
board is moving forward.</TE>
<TE>   I can't seem to get enough of the other owners to understand my
plight and support my point of view.</TE>
<TE>   There are many alternatives to tenting, but the board said their
decision is final. I tried mediation but it failed and was
nonbinding. The board has rejected arbitration and has now accused me
of interfering with the association's business and served me with a
fine for "breaking the rules."</TE>
<TE>   Paying attorneys to fight the board takes money away from my
medical care. This seems so unfair. Is there anything I can do?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: The widening disparity between original and new owners,
mortgaged and unmortgaged homeowners, financially stable owners
versus those on fixed incomes affects everyone in a deed-restricted
development. These constantly changing demographics also seriously
affect quality of life issues in developments across the nation.
Buyers need to take these issues into consideration before they
purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Under California's Davis-Stirling Act, the association is
responsible for treating the complex for wood-destroying pests while
individual owners are responsible for treating their individual
units, unless that responsibility has been delegated to the
association.</TE>
<TE>   Spending money in an effort to prevent the association from
tenting the complex to treat termites could be costly.</TE>
<TE>   The California Court of Appeals has already determined that the
board may choose the method for treating a complex, and the court
will defer to that decision and decline to second-guess it. Fining in
these circumstances just adds to the burdens of owners whose
individual problems make compliance a hardship.</TE>
<TE>   Under Civil Code section 1354, the board has authority to
temporarily remove owners from their own property in order to
complete pest treatment "for such periods and at such times as may be
necessary for prompt, effective treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Common interest development laws make no provisions for illness,
infirmity or financial hardship. If the board decides you are to move
out during termite treatment, you move out at your own expense.</TE>
<TE>   Some boards faced with similar problems have chosen to treat the
individual units for termites rather than tent because of the health
problems of one owner.</TE>
<TE>   As the demographics of many complexes change, so should the
board's consideration for the individual rights and health issues of
its occupants.</TE>
<TE>   Other than notice, there are no due process or fairness
requirements, only the decision by the board.</TE>
<TE>   Even if notice is defective, there are no penalties for boards
that claim they satisfied the notice requirement and no guidelines in
the law to ensure they have. Regrettably, the courts and the law are
oblivious to your special needs.</TE>

<LD>At sunset, Regina Kennard's house stands in the shadow of an elevated
stretch of Interstate 15. Attracted by the home's affordability and
its proximity to the onramp for her daily commute to work at a
mortgage company in Orange County, Kennard moved from Ontario to
Fontana more than a year ago and joined countless other Southern
Californians who live along a freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The mother of two chose the 4,729-square-foot lot next to the
freeway because it was bigger than those farther up the street. She
purchased the 1,977-square-foot home new last year for $189,900.</LD>
<LD>   "I wanted a big yard," said Kennard, who keeps the windows shut at
night because of the din. "I should have been more concerned. I
didn't realize the noise."</LD>
<TE>   Even further from her thoughts were the long-term health effects
of freeway pollution. Like most buyers, Kennard was unaware of
emerging scientific research that shows air pollution immediately
downwind of freeways can be more than 4 to 10 times higher than
average levels throughout much of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a building body of data that living next to a freeway has
adverse health effects, particularly among children," said Ira Tager,
a UC Berkeley epidemiologist who is studying how air pollution
affects asthmatic children for the California Air Resources Board.
Work by a variety of health researchers and environmental agencies is
finding that the highly concentrated pollution from autos and trucks
increases the incidence of asthma, respiratory infections and cancer
in people residing along freeways and other heavily traveled
thoroughfares.</TE>
<TE>   The studies, some of which have come out in California during the
last year and others that are ongoing, are attracting attention as
new homes and condominiums have become more common along freeways
because of the shrinking availability of land suitable for building
and the increasing demand for housing.</TE>
<TE>   If buyers are unaware of the health dangers, so are builders.
"It's new information to me," said Tim Piasky, director of
environmental affairs for the Building Industry Assn. of Southern
California, who noted that individual builders cannot track every
study.</TE>
<TE>   "We count on our regulatory agencies to set the requirements," he
said. "Unless there are requirements, builders will use the maximum
area."</TE>
<TE>   There are no current requirements or recommendations for buffers
between homes and freeways, but the Governor's Office of Planning and
Research has drafted new planning guidelines for cities and counties,
which are responsible for regulating local land use. The guidelines,
according to associate planner Brian Grattidge, ask cities to
consider whether it is appropriate to zone housing right next to
freeways, given the emerging studies on air pollution.</TE>
<TE>   The California Air Resources Board will issue its first official
warning in the spring and advise, but not require, that builders
create buffer zones between future residential developments and
freeways.</TE>
<TE>   "People who construct new homes should consider having at least
100 meters [less than a tenth of a mile] between them and the
freeway," said Shankar Prasad, health advisor for the board.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers have long been aware of home health risks ranging from
ground water contamination -- think Erin Brockovich -- to the
interior culprits of leaded paint, mold and asbestos. But most
haven't considered air pollution levels along freeways, according to
real estate broker Remy Agaton, who is selling the home of Lydia
Fabres, just one house north of Interstate 10 in West Covina. Like
Kennard, Fabres did not know about the studies showing higher
pollution levels.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of 100, maybe 10 are concerned about the noise, and they
never ask about the pollution," said Agaton of Jasrel Real Estate
Brokers Inc. in the City of Industry. Buyers are more concerned about
amenities, such as good schools and proximity to shopping and
transportation routes, said Agaton, who has sold many homes near
freeways in her 17-year career.</TE>
<TE>   Fabres, a single mother of four teenagers, said that the location
is what attracted her to the West Covina home. She worked in the
health-care field near downtown Los Angeles when she purchased the
house three years ago after a divorce, and freeway proximity saved
the busy mother time.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an advantage," she said. "When you came home it was
close." It also was close enough for her children to walk to school,
a nearby park and the West Covina Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   The noise bothered the family at first, and Fabres said she was
fleetingly concerned about pollution. However, she found that the
location and features of the three-bedroom, two-bath home with a den
and large backyard outweighed those concerns. Fabres is taking time
off from work to sell her home and move to Walnut for its schools and
proximity to Mt. San Antonio College, where her children, who have no
respiratory disease, plan to continue their education after
completing high school.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to saving time, buyers are often attracted to
freeway-close homes because of lower prices, according to real estate
industry executives. Fabres, for instance, is asking $275,000 for her
home.A couple blocks farther north of Interstate 10, a comparable
three-bedroom home in the same neighborhood sold for $289,900 in
mid-November.</TE>
<TE>   "Home prices near freeways generally are less expensive," said
John Burns, president of John Burns Real Estate Consulting in Irvine.
A rule of thumb, he said, is that these homes cost the buyer about $5
less per square foot than a comparable home in the same area far
enough away that buyers do not perceive the freeway as a negative.</TE>
<TE>   But researchers are beginning to document the drawbacks. Large
doses of pollutants emitted by motor vehicles can irritate the
respiratory system and exacerbate asthma and chronic bronchitis, from
which 10% to 20% of the population suffers, according to Dr. John
Balmes of UC San Francisco. Published studies examining the
respiratory health of people along freeways show a 75% to 100%
increase in asthma because of the higher concentration of air
pollutants, said Balmes, former president of the California Thoracic
Society, the medical section of the American Lung Assn. of
California. Some of the pollutants, including benzene and diesel
soot, are known carcinogens.</TE>
<TE>   One study published earlier this fall in the Journal of the Air &amp;
Waste Management Assn. shows that the level of so-called ultra-fine
particles, which are emitted from automotive tailpipes but are too
small to be visible, was four times higher just downwind and east of
the 405 Freeway in Westwood. About a fifth of a mile downwind, the
level of the particles gradually fell to the same level as upwind of
the busy freeway, wrote the research team, headed by William C.
Hinds, a professor in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences
at UCLA. Carbon monoxide, a good indicator for a range of other
automotive emissions, also fell sharply a fifth of a mile downwind of
the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental health scientists are particularly worried about
ultra-fine particles because they can penetrate deep into the
respiratory system.</TE>
<TE>   In another study in the Los Angeles area, the South Coast Air
Quality Management District found that the risk of contracting cancer
from air pollution, particularly lung cancer, was up to twice or more
as high right along the freeway than in other areas of the region,
except for those with both dense traffic and heavy concentrations of
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Like many Southern Californians, Kennard, who grew up in Altadena,
is used to air pollution. "As you drive into the inland area, you see
the smog haze," she said. "However, I can't say that I paid too much
attention. My children do not have any respiratory issues."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Kennard said she is concerned about what the studies reveal.
"I would move, if I could, to a cleaner area."</TE>
<TE>   Until environmental and zoning regulators complete ongoing studies
and develop guidelines or regulations, home buyers must carefully
weigh the benefits and health risks of being near a freeway. Said
epidemiologist Tager: "If I were a parent with young children and had
a choice between a nice home near a freeway and one not so nice but
away from a freeway, I'd buy the one away from the freeway."</TE>

<HD>Inside tips on filtering out air pollution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William J. Kelly</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are steps homeowners can take to reduce exposure to automotive
pollution.</LD>
<LD>   "Simple things ... would lead to modest improvements," said
William Nazaroff, a professor of mechanical engineering at UC
Berkeley who specializes in air filtration. A room-size air filter,
for example, could be used in a bedroom at night to reduce particle
pollution. Or a homeowner could hire a contractor to install a
central air system filter.</LD>
<LD>   A variety of filters can be used, Nazaroff said, including
high-efficiency particle arresting filters, commonly known as HEPA
filters, and activated carbon filters to remove some exhaust fumes,
such as benzene.</LD>
<TE>   To optimize the efficiency of a central air system, the contractor
should "pressurize" the house by installing an outside air intake.
While it sounds counter-intuitive, bringing outside air into the home
prevents polluted air from leaking in under doors and through cracks
around windows, said J. Michael Burke of Burke Environmental Inc. in
Inglewood. The air inside is then continually filtered while the
central blower fan operates.</TE>
<TE>   Burke, who has served on numerous technical committees for the
American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning
Engineers, said that new controls on central air systems can run the
blower fan alone when the furnace burner or cooling system is not
needed. This keeps air circulating through the filter and reduces
indoor pollution.</TE>
<TE>   A heating and air-conditioning contractor can install a basic
central filtering system for as little as a few hundred dollars,
depending upon the grade of the filters and any needed controls,
Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   The additional electricity needed to filter household air will
cost about $30 a month for a 2,000-square-foot house.</TE>
<TE>   "People who are close to a freeway or in a polluted area are
advised to have that system running," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There is long-term hope too. Cars are much cleaner now due to
air-pollution control standards, according to the California Air
Resources Board, and new standards and cleanup programs are expected
to continue to reduce emissions from cars and diesel trucks in the
decade ahead.</TE>

<HD>Pastoral lifestyle is preserved in Capistrano</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marnell Jameson</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Juan Capistrano is a famously picturesque town known for its
namesake mission and for the legendary swallows that return to it
every year. People, too, flock to this historic city for its pastoral
lifestyle and relative lack of pretense. The city of 32,500 is
nestled in a coastal valley one mile from the ocean, halfway between
Los Angeles and San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   Insider's view</LD>
<LD>   Slow growth and historic preservation are the mantras in this
town, which is one of the oldest in the West. There is community
pride to spare and a core of locals that fight valiantly, if not
always successfully, against rapid development.</LD>
<TE>   One of the reasons for the town's beauty is a city ordinance that
forbids building on ridgelines or sightlines. The rolling coastal
hills remain unfettered, and no one is king of the hill.</TE>
<TE>   The low-crime, 13.6-square-mile city has a diverse population,
including a denizen of cowboys, a large population of Mexican
immigrants and white-collar SUV-driving newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing card</TE>
<TE>   The quaint, old-fashioned town caters to pedestrians, many of whom
come in by train at the busy San Juan Depot. Within walking distance
of Mission San Juan Capistrano, the town's centerpiece, are a library
designed by Michael Graves, numerous antiques stores, a playhouse,
several mom-and-pop restaurants and boutiques.</TE>
<TE>   Just over the tracks by the depot is the Los Rios Historic
District, a well-preserved residential street and still-thriving
slice of the past. The annual Swallows Day Parade, a tradition that
began in the 1930s, pays tribute to the area's history every March
with marching bands and local cowboys on horseback.</TE>
<TE>   Wow factor</TE>
<TE>   Since its founding by Father Junipero Serra in 1776, the mission
has been considered the jewel of the 21 missions that were built
along El Camino Real. The mission's idyllic grounds, tolling bells,
tranquil gardens and old adobe walls make it popular with tourists
and locals.</TE>
<TE>   Dividing lines</TE>
<TE>   The 5 Freeway splits the town into east and west sides. With the
exception of exclusive homes in the vicinity of Aguacate and
Peppertree Bend, two of the city's most prestigious streets featuring
multimillion dollar estates, the west side is older, offers more
affordable single-family homes and the bulk of the city's multifamily
housing.</TE>
<TE>   East of the freeway are newer, upscale homes, many built during
the last 15 years. These tonier neighborhoods attract commuters who
want relief from more congested nearby cities but who still want easy
access to the business corridors of Irvine and Newport Beach. Homes
in these neighborhoods, which include Hunt Club, Marbella, Capistrano
Estates, Stoneridge and San Juan Hills, range from the high $700,000s
to more than $3 million, according to broker Robyn Robinson, co-owner
of Regency Real Estate.</TE>
<TE>   Good news, bad news</TE>
<TE>   With a mean daily temperature of 53 degrees in January and 67
degrees in July, it would be hard to find better weather. Traffic
congestion, however, particularly around the mission and overpass at
Ortega Highway, is an increasing problem.</TE>
<TE>   Hot spots</TE>
<TE>   The Swallows Inn, a popular location for filmmakers, is the
closest thing to a saloon most city folk will ever see, except
instead of horses hitched out front, Harleys are parked in gleaming
rows. Inside, the rowdy riders, sporting full beards and leather-clad
girlfriends, drink heartily to live and lively western music.</TE>
<TE>   Report card</TE>
<TE>   Public schools are part of the Capistrano Unified School District.
The town's two elementary schools reflect what one would expect from
a city that has two sides of the track. Student test scores at
Ambuehl Elementary on the east side average in the 70th and 80th
percentiles. At San Juan Elementary, to the west, scores dip to the
30th and 40th percentiles, and into the 20s in reading. These two
schools feed into Marco F. Forster, the city's only middle school.
Though the school pulls just above average on national test scores,
it has trouble overcoming negative perceptions about its mixed
demographics. Some residents send their children to one of the city's
five private schools, or to other private schools just outside the
city limits.</TE>
<TE>   On the market</TE>
<TE>   In early December, 89 single-family houses were on the market for
between $350,000 and $7 million; 16 condos were listed for prices
ranging from $135,000 to $589,000.</TE>
<TE>   Housing stock</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Capistrano has 7,019 single-family residences and 2,048
condominiums. During the last 12 months, 209 condos have sold. During
the same period, 498 single-family houses have sold.</TE>

<LD>This corner condominium is in the 66-unit Venice Renaissance, an
award-winning building designed by Johannes Van Tilburg and
constructed in 1989. Jonathan Borofsky's three-story "Ballerina
Clown" and Guy Dill's "Harmic Arch" sculpture draw attention to the
mixed-use project, which has a Chaya Venice restaurant and a yoga
studio on its first floor.</LD>
<LD>   The building was ahead of its time as an example of sensible urban
design and yet it was inspired by the 1905 Venetian arcades of Venice
founder Abbott Kinney. The elaborate Corinthian columns of the
street-level loggia match those of the original Venice Center on
Venice Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   About this home: The unit is filled with natural light and ocean
breezes. A private deck faces the beach, less than two blocks away.
The condo also has a view of the "Harmic Arch." The open floor plan
includes numerous windows, sliding-glass doors and skylights. The
complex has courtyards and pathways as well as rooftop pools and
gardens.</LD>
<TE>   Asking price: $475,000</TE>
<TE>   Size: The condo has two bedrooms in 1,188 square feet.</TE>

<LD>Rocker Tommy Lee has listed his home in the hills of Malibu at $3
million.</LD>
<LD>   Lee is selling because he is engaged to singer-dancer Mayte
Garcia, who was once wed to Prince, and they want to buy a house
together in the L.A. area, real estate sources said.</LD>
<LD>   "Both of his children [by ex-wife actress Pamela Anderson]
were born while he was living there," said co-listing agent Beth Ann
Green.</LD>
<TE>   Lee bought the house, described as Moorish in style, in 1995. The
house was in the news in July 2001 when a 4-year-old boy accidentally
drowned in the pool during a birthday party.</TE>
<TE>   The house, built in 1991 on nearly 2.5 acres behind gates, has six
bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms in about 7,400 square feet. There is also
a media room, a three-car garage and an elevator.</TE>
<TE>   The former Motley Crue drummer, 40, recently released "Never," his
first solo album. Most of it was recorded in his Malibu home, sources
say.</TE>
<TE>   Green, at Coldwell Banker's Beverly Hills East office, shares the
listing with Tracy Bunetta at Coldwell Banker's Malibu East office.</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach by way of Ukraine</TE>
<TE>   Stanislav "Slava" Medvedenko, the young Ukrainian who joined the
L.A. Lakers two years ago last summer as a backup forward, has
purchased a Manhattan Beach home for $1.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Medvedenko, 23, is a first-time home buyer. He closed escrow last
week on a five-bedroom, nearly 4,500-square-foot house built in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The home, on a corner lot, has a living room with a fireplace and
a wet bar; a family room with a fireplace; a master suite with a
fireplace and two balconies; an office and a three-car garage with a
workbench.</TE>
<TE>   The house has a spacious floor plan and high ceilings. The
6-foot-10, 250-pound basketball star played professionally in Ukraine
and Lithuania before joining the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Medvedenko tore the tendon off the tip of his
right pinkie finger, and he was expected to be out of play for as
long as six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Pane of Re/Max on the Boulevard in Studio City was the
selling agent.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks sale pushes ceiling</TE>
<TE>   Writer-producer-director David Duclon and his wife, Deborah, have
sold their home in the Westlake area of Thousand Oaks for close to
its $10-million asking price. It is one of the highest home sales in
the area, local Realtors say.</TE>
<TE>   The buyers are Ray Scherr, former owner of the Guitar Center chain
of music stores and founder of the Hollywood RockWalk (which honors
musical innovators), and his wife, Janet. The Guitar Center is one of
the nation's largest music product retailers.</TE>
<TE>   The Scherrs are also longtime supporters of the Alliance for the
Arts in Thousand Oaks. A 400-seat theater there was renamed in their
honor after the couple donated $1 million to the alliance in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   David Duclon wrote and produced such TV series as "The Odd
Couple," "Happy Days," "Laverne and Shirley," "The Jeffersons,"
"Silver Spoons," "Punky Brewster," "Family Matters" and "Malcolm &amp;
Eddie." He and his wife sold the home, which they built in 1995, to
scale down.</TE>
<TE>   The chateau-style estate is on 4.5 acres behind gates. The
18,000-square-foot house is on a hill with golf course views.</TE>
<TE>   The home also has five bedrooms, 11.5 bathrooms, an elevator, a
library with a fireplace, a family room with a fireplace, a pub with
fairway views, and a foyer with a sweeping staircase and a crystal
chandelier.</TE>
<TE>   The master suite has his-and-her wings with steam showers and
whirlpool baths. His wing also has an office, kitchenette and
balcony. Her wing has leaded-glass windows, twin walk-in closets and
a chandelier.</TE>
<TE>   There is an 1,800-square-foot guest house on the property as well
as a pool, spa, five-car garage, sport court and motorcourt with a
fountain.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Hurwitz of Hurwitz-James in Beverly Hills had the listing and
represented the buyers, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Beach home has a star-studded past</TE>
<TE>   A Malibu beach house owned by singer Diana Ross at one time and
the late actor Richard Harris at another sold the first day it was on
the market for nearly its $7,995,000 asking price.</TE>
<TE>   The contemporary home has four bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms in about
2,900 square feet. It also has walls of glass facing the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Among its neighbors are such notables as David Geffen, Lawrence
Ellison, Courteney Cox, David Arquette and Richard Riordan. The buyer
is an executive in the entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency, Beverly Hills,
represented both sides of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Bungalow traded up for a Tudor</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Kilner, who plays Hamilton in the series "CSI: Miami," has
sold his California bungalow-style house in Spaulding Square for
$845,000, and he bought a Tudor-style home in the Hollywood Hills for
$867,000.</TE>
<TE>   The two-bedroom house he bought was built in 1928 and is described
as being in need of refurbishing. He sold his three-bedroom bungalow,
built in 1917, to Norman Steinberg, who co-wrote the movie "Blazing
Saddles" (1974). Steinberg, also known for writing "My Favorite Year"
(1982), sold his four-bedroom home in Windsor Square to a businessman
from El Paso for slightly more than $1.7 million. That house was
built in 1922.</TE>
<TE>   Kilner, 44, became an actor after a successful career as an
investment banker managing accounts for Fortune 500 companies. He has
appeared on such series as "China Beach" and "The Cosby Show." He
starred opposite Nancy Travis on the CBS sitcom "Almost Perfect"
(1995-96) and was cast as Dad in the movie "American Pie 2" (2001).</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg most recently has been executive producer of the series
"Raising Dad," which he also has directed. He was an executive
producer of "Cosby," for which he was also a writer.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanine Sales at Hilton &amp; Hyland, Beverly Hills, represented
Kilner in his deals; Timothy Enright of the Enright Co. represented
Steinberg in buying and selling; and Janet Caminite of DBL, Santa
Monica, represented the buyer from El Paso, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Arranging sale of Malibu home</TE>
<TE>   Kelley Love, who has arranged compositions for the Pandemonia
Orchestra, has sold his Malibu home for its asking price of just
under $1.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The recently renovated home, behind gates, has five bedrooms in
4,600 square feet. It was built in 1989. The three-level home also
has a pool, spa, cabana, sauna, attached guest house and canyon
views.</TE>
<TE>   Ira Greespon of Ocean Pacific Realty, Malibu, represented the

<KH>ASK THE INSPECTOR</KH>
<HD>Disclosure statements arrived with litigious society</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barry Stone</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I was a Realtor nearly 25 years ago, before having
children. With my kids now grown, I've gone back to work but can't
believe how much things have changed. Before, no one ever talked
about disclosure, and home inspectors were unheard of. Now I can't
spend five minutes in the office without someone mentioning home
inspection reports and disclosure forms. How did all this change
happen?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Disclosure marks the historical turning point in American
real estate. To get the full picture, let's step back a few
generations. In the early 1900s, the main concerns among home buyers
were stable foundations and watertight roofs. Litigation was the last
thought on anyone's mind, and most people were thankful to have
indoor plumbing.</LD>
<LD>   In the ensuing decades, home buying changed dramatically, from a
simple, casual exchange to a complicated, legal process; from a
personal handshake to an intricate complex of fine print signed in
triplicate, witnessed by notaries, reviewed by attorneys, evaluated
by appraisers, overseen by escrow officers, underwritten by title
insurance companies and dominated by disclosure requirements.</LD>
<TE>   Most of this change is fairly recent. By the mid-1960s, the
purchase price of a home was barely more than two years income for
one working person, mortgage interest rates were about 5%, and buyers
were unconcerned about routine defects. The American Dream was
affordable, and people accepted flaws as part of the package.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the 1970s: Societal changes affected all aspects of
business and finance. Home prices escalated to previously unimagined
levels.</TE>
<TE>   With the expanded financial commitment of enormous down payments
and burdensome monthly installments, people were less willing to
accept homes in "as is" condition. Properties were expected to be in
good repair, and buyers were less forgiving of undisclosed defects.</TE>
<TE>   In response to these changes, contractors offered a new kind of
service: property inspections for home buyers. These early home
inspections were basic overviews, concerned primarily with major
structural and mechanical defects. Most people remained unaware of
such services, and the quality of these new inspections was
rudimentary at best.</TE>
<TE>   As home inspections slowly became popular, growth brought an
increased demand for ever more detailed inspections. When buyers were
not satisfied, inspectors learned that faulty reporting spelled legal
trouble. With the onset of claims and lawsuits, the exactitude of
inspections intensified.</TE>
<TE>   As these transformations were occurring in the marketplace,
government agencies and legislatures were riding the wave of change.
By the late 1980s, many states were enacting seller disclosure laws,
signaling the end of the "buyer beware" era. Previously, sellers
could make cosmetic changes to a defective home, declare that
everything was perfect and walk away free of consequence.</TE>
<TE>   New disclosure requirements altered that picture, providing
penalties for sellers who failed to reveal known problems and setting
new standards for agents and brokers. The problem with these
requirements was that sellers and agents were often unaware of latent
defects.</TE>
<TE>   As the demand for disclosure increased on all fronts, home
inspections became more important. The first generation of
inspectors, in the 1970s, foresaw the need for meaningful standards
to regulate their evolving trade. Across the country, they formed
national and state associations, such as the American Society of Home
Inspectors and the California Real Estate Inspection Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Without state licensing, self-regulation helped elevate
inspectorship. Formal standards of practice were drafted. Ongoing
education became mandatory for member inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   In the span of 25 years, the real estate transaction process has
been totally transformed. Fear of litigation dominates the
marketplace, and active disclosure has been recognized as the best
defense.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "There Are Ways to Fight Those Noisy Leaf Blowers,"
Letters, Dec. 8: If [the letter writer] figures out how to get law
enforcement to create a healthy and peaceful home by eliminating
carcinogenic fumes, I hope he will share it with all.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last eight years, homeowners in the Los Angeles area have
been forced to move from their condos due to carcinogenic fumes from
tobacco smoke that has enveloped their homes ... from smoking
neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   As he suggested regarding the leaf blowers, we have all told the
condo association boards, and they simply do not care. And this in
spite of the nuisance clause in all CC&amp;Rs, which reads, "No noxious
or offensive activity shall be carried on upon the Covered Property,
nor shall anything be done thereon which might be or become an
annoyance or nuisance to occupants within the Covered Property, which
shall in any way interfere with the rights of quiet enjoyment of
occupants within the Covered Property...."</LD>
<TE>   It is my hope that condo developers will take note of these
concerns and begin creating healthier living environments for the
future.</TE>

<HD>Fannie Mae funds aid Muslim buyers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Wedner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to promote homeownership among observant American
Muslims, Fannie Mae has committed $10 million in home financing
originated by American Finance House LARIBA, an Islamic financial
institution.</LD>
<LD>   Financing options are limited under Islamic law, which prohibits
"riba" -- the paying or collecting of interest on mortgages and other
types of debts. The recent agreement between Fannie Mae and the
Pasadena-based financial institution is expected to provide
much-needed liquidity to American Finance, which seeks to help meet
the growing demand for homes among Muslims who want to make the
purchase in accordance with their beliefs.</LD>
<LD>   Under American Finance's home financing model, the financial
institution forms a partnership with the home buyer through a
lease-to-own arrangement. After agreeing on the fair rental value of
the home, the home buyer typically puts down 20%. American Finance
and the buyer own the home together, but the buyer buys back shares
of the home over, for example, 20 years.</LD>
<TE>   Because the financial institution owns more of the house than the
buyer, the buyer pays a greater monthly share in the beginning years
of the contract. Over time, the buyer, who now owns a greater share
of the home, pays less.</TE>
<TE>   Agreements between American Finance and the buyer are interpreted
into conventional loan documents to comply with consumer protection
laws.</TE>
<TE>   If the buyer sells the home before the 20 years are up, any profit
is kept after paying back the original "shares" of the home to
American Finance.</TE>

<LD>Question: My 10-year-old granddaughter must stay with me for a few
months while her parents work out their marital problems.</LD>
<LD>   The mobile home park manager said that since the park is an
adults-only park, she could not stay more than 10 days. If she stayed
longer, I would be served a three-day notice to move because no one
under the age of 18 is allowed.</LD>
<LD>   He said this was part of the "child visitation policy" at the
park, which could not be amended. I don't want to lose my housing.
Can he legally prevent my granddaughter from staying with me?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Mobile home residents often ask this question. First of
all, there is no such category as "adults only" housing. Housing can
be "seniors only," but to qualify as such, 80% of the units must be
occupied by at least one person 55 or older or 100% of its units must
be occupied by people 62 or older.</TE>
<TE>   Since your park only requires that residents be at least 18 years
old, and not older than 55 or 62, it probably does not qualify for
senior-only status.</TE>
<TE>   If the park does qualify as a senior-only park, the management's
exclusion of your granddaughter and other children may be legal.</TE>
<TE>   To find out the park's status, contact your local fair housing
agency. It will be able to determine whether your park qualifies as a
seniors-only park.</TE>
<TE>   If it is not seniors only, the agency can notify the park
management that discrimination against families with children is
illegal. In this case, your granddaughter may be allowed to stay with
you for the time required or beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Late fee doesn't apply to deposit</TE>
<TE>   Question: My landlord gave me a notice increasing my security
deposit. The notice said if I didn't pay the increase amount within
30 days, I would be charged a late fee.</TE>
<TE>   Are late fees allowed on security deposits?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: No. The concept of charging late fees applies to the
payment of rent, not security deposits. These fees can be imposed to
reduce any financial loss a landlord may encounter in paying the
mortgage if the rent is paid late or not at all.</TE>
<TE>   Because it could be difficult to prove that the non-payment of the
new security deposit amount created a financial loss, this late fee
is not enforceable.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you don't pay the increased deposit amount and you move,
this deposit late fee could not be deducted from the security deposit
you've already paid.</TE>
<TE>   Security deposits can be increased during month-to-month tenancies
with a proper 30-day change of terms notice as long as the total
amount collected does not exceed the statutory limit of twice the
monthly rent for an unfurnished unit, or three times the rent if the
unit is furnished.</TE>
<TE>   Guarding use of information</TE>
<TE>   Question: I'm applying for a new apartment, and the application
requires a great deal of personal and financial information. It is
understandable that the landlord needs this information to decide
whether to rent to my family. But how do I ensure that my personal
and financial information is not used inappropriately?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: You have raised a legitimate concern in light of today's
problem of identity theft. This is a topic you should discuss with
the prospective landlord or agent. By expressing your fears, you will
help him or her to be sensitive to the issue.</TE>
<TE>   You are entitled to add language to any information you provide,
or any release of information, limiting the use of that information.
An example would be a statement that says: "Use of this information
is limited to consideration of my application as a tenant. Any other
use is forbidden."</TE>

<KH>HOME-BUYING STRATEGIES</KH>
<HD>Writing their own script</HD>
<DH>TV freelancers find financing and the perfect duplex, but
not without a solid cast of experts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy Price-Robinson</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Television writers Daniel Vaillancourt and David A. Lee never thought
they could get the financing to buy a home.</LD>
<LD>   "We're freelance writers," Lee said. "Who would give us a loan?"</LD>
<LD>   But weary of paying $2,000 a month for rent on their Hollywood
Hills apartment, they came up with a plan one day in late July: Buy a
duplex, live in half of it and rent out the other half. The rental
would provide a source of regular income to help them qualify for a
mortgage and offset the monthly payment.</LD>
<TE>   An hour later, they were driving around looking for signs. As
freelancers, Vaillancourt said, "we're used to creating our own
opportunities.... So this was nothing new. We pounded the pavement."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, their determination helped them find a West Hollywood
duplex a month later and close escrow 30 days after that.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not to say the two didn't have help. Used to
collaborating in their work lives, the partners decided they needed a
real estate agent to help them determine location, price, down
payment, how much rent a second unit could bring, what renovation was
necessary to get that rent and, finally, the financing.</TE>
<TE>   One agent immediately came to mind. Vaillancourt and Lee had met
Michele Hess of DBL Realtors last year during an entertaining
afternoon touring multimillion-dollar open houses. Hess was holding
an open house along with mortgage broker Leo Donato, whose services
the pair also would use.</TE>
<TE>   Finding the right duplex, Lee and Vaillancourt discovered, was
more difficult than selecting a real estate agent and mortgage
broker. The second day of their search, they received an e-mail from
Hess listing 32 potential properties. But after looking at several
duplexes in areas they didn't like, they narrowed their search to
West Hollywood, Hollywood, Silver Lake, Los Feliz and Miracle Mile.</TE>
<TE>   Using skills honed in researching characters for TV shows,
Vaillancourt studied the legal ramifications of buying duplexes with
tenants already in residence. West Hollywood has strict rules, one of
which states that "landlords may not issue 30-day notices to
terminate tenancy without cause."</TE>
<TE>   However, according to West Hollywood's rent stabilization
ordinance, tenants may be asked to move under certain conditions: if
the landlord or a close relative wants to move in (and then generally
only the newest tenant may be asked to move), if all rental units in
a building are withdrawn from the rental market, if a landlord
already living on the premises needs to switch units with a tenant
for medical reasons (to have a ground-floor unit, for example), or if
the landlord needs to make repairs ordered by a government agency
that cannot be done with a tenant in the unit.</TE>
<TE>   A landlord in a West Hollywood rent-controlled unit can offer
money to encourage a tenant to relocate but cannot force a move. "You
can't buy your way out," said Allyne Winderman, the city's director
of rent stabilization and housing.</TE>
<TE>   With a clear understanding of the laws in West Hollywood,
Vaillancourt and Lee continued their search, looking for fixer-uppers
from about $300,000.</TE>
<TE>   After seeing the location and condition of duplexes in that price
range, however, they expanded their range up to $600,000 and asked
contractor friends Tim Wenzel and Tommy Shortess to evaluate the cost
of improving each duplex they considered. According to Hess, each
increment of $750 in rental income charged would qualify them to
borrow an additional $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the new price range, qualifying for the loan was not
difficult. According to Donato, people who are self-employed should
look for a "no-income-verification loan." Also known as a "stated
income loan," it bases qualification on credit history and down
payment, not on verifiable income. The downside is it comes with a
higher interest rate. "It's a very common loan in Hollywood," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   After looking at dozens of places, getting financial analyses from
Donato for eight or nine of them, and making offers on four (for
which they were outbid by other buyers), Vaillancourt and Lee found
the ideal duplex on the Thursday before Labor Day, the second day it
was listed.</TE>
<TE>   The 2,176-square-foot Spanish-style duplex, built in 1923, sits on
a leafy street filled mostly with duplexes. Like others on the
street, it looks more like a single-family home than a duplex. The
two front doors are sheltered by a single arched, covered porch, and
each half has a different parapet roof detail and a distinct picture
window.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the units have built-in cabinets, tiled fireplaces and 9
1/2-foot ceilings. One has one bedroom, and the other two bedrooms.
Around back, the garage has been converted to a home office and guest
room. According to the seller's agent, $100,000 in upgrades had been
spent on the duplex in the last two years, including tiled floors,
can lights, all new windows (except for the front picture windows)
and central air and heat. Plus, the property had no tenants.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to buy the duplex before the Labor Day weekend could bring
a slew of other buyers and agents, Hess suggested to her clients that
they offer full price, nearly $600,000, and that they give the buyer
24 hours to consider the offer. Three hours later, the offer was
accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the duplex had been improved, Vaillancourt and Lee
wanted to make it nicer. They pulled up the tile in the unit they
chose for themselves and added hardwood floors, put granite kitchen
counters in the rental unit and added marble floors to both units'
bathrooms.</TE>
<TE>   New appliances included a front-loading washer and new dryer for
each unit. A new wood fence gives the rental unit its own small yard.</TE>
<TE>   By upgrading the rental unit, the new owners hope to rent it out
for $2,200 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Lee and Vaillancourt, who landed an MTV writing job just months
after moving here from New York in 2001, see this as their starter
home for the next five years, but wild success could alter their
plans.</TE>
<TE>   "You come off an MTV job," Vaillancourt said, "and two years later
you create your own show and it's a hit and you buy a
multimillion-dollar mansion in the hills. That's what happens to
people in L.A."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Reserve, noting encouraging signs that the economy is
working through a "soft spot," left interest rates unchanged last
week and signaled that November's rate cut may turn out to be the
last one needed for recovery.</LD>
<LD>   The Fed decision to leave its benchmark rate for overnight bank
loans at a 41-year low of 1.25% means that Americans will be able to
keep borrowing at the lowest interest rates in decades on home-equity
loans.</LD>
<LD>   The Fed, which aggressively cut rates 11 times in 2001 as it
struggled to deal with the country's first recession in a decade and
the economic fallout from the terrorist attacks, had left its fund
rate unchanged through most of this year until the half-point cut
Nov. 6.</LD>

<HD>Eastern Bias Clouds Heisman Race Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chuck Culpepper</AU>
<BD>Newsday</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eleven score and six years ago, our founding parents brought forth
upon this Earth a new nation, and after such a chore they felt really
tired, so they stayed put near the Atlantic.</LD>
<LD>   Years later, they realized the land stretched some 3,000 miles to
the west, but most of them had kids, thus no energy left for crossing
two mountain ranges.</LD>
<LD>   And so years after that, Western college football teams lacked for
regard amid an Eastern bias of non-sinister origins. More people
lived in Eastern-Central time zones than in Mountain-Pacific; people
are strange beings who tout nearby athletes; and the East, still
tired from founding the country, often nodded off just as the West
kicked off.</LD>
<TE>   As of 2002, no West Coast player had won the Heisman Trophy since
USC's Marcus Allen in 1981. The West complained of the Eastern bias,
the East complained of the West's complaints about the Eastern bias,
and an exhausting 2002 Heisman race became a prime Eastern-bias test
case.</TE>
<TE>   First, a human wrecking ball got scant mention even as contenders
bounced up and down the list all fall. He played for Arizona State,
whose games often air only for insomniacs, vampires and dateless
Westerners. Teams would counter him with two or three of their own,
and still, even many college football fans don't know about defensive
end Terrell Suggs.</TE>
<TE>   The dynamo began each game with an endearing ritual where he'd
look at his mother, she'd ask how badly he wanted it, he'd indicate
he wanted it badly, and he'd go out and prove himself correct on the
way to an NCAA-record 22 sacks.</TE>
<TE>   As the mayhem concluded, you could make a case for Suggs as most
outstanding player, wringing such numbers (29.5 tackles for losses,
six forced fumbles) from such a position. You could get worked up
about it. Voters overlook defenders, except with their best choice of
the last decade, Michigan everyman Charles Woodson. Voters lately
rival Best Picture Oscar voters for uninspiring choices. The Eastern
bias!</TE>
<TE>   But the most outstanding of the year breathed even farther west,
where USC had the intestines to schedule Colorado, Kansas State and
Notre Dame atop its conference schedule. So when Carson Palmer
mastered the nation's No. 1 schedule with gaudy numbers such as 32
touchdown passes and gave Notre Dame's pass defense the worst passing
beating in its history, he molted from mediocrity, redefined USC as
something other than an annual sigh to its lunatic fans, and bobbed
up as the most outstanding player.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't count as ludicrous to support Miami's Ken Dorsey,
Miami's Willis McGahee, Penn State's Larry Johnson or Iowa's Brad
Banks, but the Carson candidacy lent the prospect of Eastern-bias
grumbles and the fear of hearing again how there's only one voter
region in the West, three in the East.</TE>
<TE>   "I go with the experts because if everyone says it, there must be
something to it," USC Coach Pete Carroll said while recalling no
Eastern bias as coach of the NFL's Patriots and Jets. "I don't have
enough comparison and background to tell you, 'This is the case,'
whether it's because of when our games start or they're not viewed as
much on the East Coast. I think we have the best player in America
here and we'll see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   We'll see, but we might not know. We knew in 2000, when Eastern
bias ruled, when everyone argued Miami (10-1) should play for the
national title instead of Florida State (10-1) because it beat
Florida State, but nobody argued Washington (10-1) should play
instead of Miami after it beat Miami. Back then, Florida State Coach
Bobby Bowden cleverly cited the importance of proximity to the
original 13 colonies. If Palmer comes up short, it's cloudier, but we
might say it's partly because the colonists originally crossed the
Atlantic, not the Pacific.</TE>

<LD>   In the NHL offices in Toronto, Andy VanHellemond, the director of
officiating, said he believes the officials are getting better at
making the calls and the players are getting better at playing this
new, more skillful game.</LD>
<LD>   "We didn't do this to increase scoring," VanHellemond said
recently. "We did it to improve the game, create more chances and
make it a more energized game. You can look at the stats and see it's
working. There have been 45 fewer fights (after one-fourth of the
league schedule) and 90 less majors for fighting. That means there
isn't as much contact during the course of the game. It means there
is more movement and less grabbing on."</LD>
<TE>   The game is being cleaned up. And because of that, even though
increasing scoring was not the NHL's goal, goal scoring was up 6%
over last season.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are many more players and coaches who are happier
with the new faceoff rule that has speeded up the game by 16 minutes
than there are those happy with the obstruction crackdown, even
though that crackdown is designed to create freer movement through
the neutral zone so the quick, highly skilled players can perform
better offensively.</TE>
<TE>   "The speed-up of the game is great," said Washington Capitals
Coach Bruce Cassidy. "I'm home, got my three beers and in bed by
11:30 p.m."</TE>
<TE>   Cassidy has been less thrilled with the manner in which the
obstruction situation has been handled.</TE>
<TE>   "From one night to the next, you hope you're not the team they
[the officials] decide to single out," he said. "I guess they've
eliminated some obstruction, but I think from night to night [it's
uneven].</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm fine with it. Let's see a full season and playoffs.
Ultimately, it's the fans' sport and if this creates more
entertaining hockey, then that's good."</TE>
<TE>   There seems little doubt that the hockey is better. The speed of
the game has increased on the ice and on the game clock, and one rule
seems to be affecting the other.</TE>
<TE>   Because obstruction is being called, there is less hooking,
holding and tripping in the neutral zone. That means more space to
work and less frustration. The quick drop of the puck on faceoffs
also eliminates the time players used to spend jawing with and
agitating one another. Combined, it has resulted in fewer roughing
and fighting penalties.</TE>
<TE>   And all of that goes to explain why power-play goals were up by
114 in the first 310 games, while the number of power plays increased
only one per game.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been an increase of power plays in the neutral zone,
but roughing is down 108 minor penalties," VanHellemond said. "There
isn't as much contact during the course of the game, and it is making
a difference."</TE>
<TE>   VanHellemond said there is a debate among fans, players and
coaches over what exactly constitutes obstruction, but said there is
no debate in his office.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no degrees of infraction," VanHellemond said. "It's
like if the goalie shoots the puck over the glass. He may not have
intended to, but it's a penalty. With obstruction, it is the same. It
may just be a little hook that throws another player off stride, but
it's still a penalty. You used to be able to slingshot past with a
hook, but that's a penalty now. The way the game is played now is
creating more excitement and energy."</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa Senators forward Mike Fisher, who freely acknowledges he is
not one of the team's "most skilled guys," said he has enjoyed
playing more this season because his game is primarily forechecking
and that's what officials want to see.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most skilled on the Ottawa roster is Marian Hossa. The
veteran right wing, who ranks among the league's top 15 scorers,
agrees the game is better, but sees recent inconsistency.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning, it helped more because there were more calls
and that meant more power plays," Hossa said. "There was a little
more room at the beginning. Now, they are calling it a little less.
But I love it. The game should be more open, and there is certainly
no problem for me to adjust."</TE>
<TE>   It has taken some teams longer than others to adjust. The
Capitals, for instance, sometimes had to kill as many as eight or
nine penalties per game at the beginning of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting the feel of it now," Cap center Glen Metropolit
said. "And it helps the little guys. It really does open the game a
lot, creating room for someone like me [5 feet 10, 193 pounds] to get
through to the offensive zone."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Calgary Flames' Jarome Iginla, who led the NHL in goals
(52) and overall scoring (96 points) last season, had only six goals
and 18 points in 27 games. He said he has not been helped by the new
directive.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if there is any big difference," he said. "I don't
know that it creates more space. I wouldn't say the neutral zone is
that much more open. I just don't see it that way."</TE>
<TE>   And Jaromir Jagr has had some trouble adjusting to the cleaner
play too. Though Cassidy said Jagr has not been protected as much by
officials as he should be, Jagr leads the league in shots with 128
and the Caps in goals with 15. But getting on the scoreboard, said
the right wing, has been more difficult than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I am missing the net because I am so used to guys hanging
on me, the fact that they aren't always there is throwing my shot
off," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But it is the fact players such as Jagr, Hossa, Pittsburgh's Mario
Lemieux and Dallas' Mike Modano are getting more goal-scoring chances
that is making VanHellemond happy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to hear players like Jagr say those kinds of things,"
VanHellemond said. "They are positive excuses. If you are a fast,
quick, skilled player, you love this."</TE>

<HD>Match Made in Tennis Heaven</HD>
<DH>Kramer and Schroeder were kings of the court in the middle
of the 20th century, and Kramer's influence is felt in the sport to
this day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This Christmas story began when Jack Kramer and Ted Schroeder,
budding tennis champions, met on a court as 13-year-olds.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 68 years later, it's a rare day that these old friends
don't talk on the telephone at least once, sharing memories, a
passion for life and a mutual desire to improve junior tennis in the
United States with a plan they're urging the USTA to adopt.</LD>
<LD>   They were born two weeks apart in the summer of 1921, played as
rivals and doubles partners, and will each celebrate a 59th wedding
anniversary in February, Kramer to his wife Gloria, Schroeder to his
wife Ann.</LD>
<TE>   "We all just celebrated a huge event -- two whole years without
Jack breaking something," Schroeder said Monday from his home in La
Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder said it jokingly, but he was worried about his friend
two years ago around Christmas when Kramer was seriously hurt on the
golf course he owns while showing one of his grandsons, Michael, then
10, how to drive a cart.</TE>
<TE>   "We started down a little hill to go over a bridge and he panicked
a bit and didn't turn," Kramer said from his office at Los Serranos
Country Club in Chino Hills. "The cart hit the corner of the bridge
and I flew out and ended up face down in a little creek. It scares me
every once in a while when I drive by there."</TE>
<TE>   A few golfers on a nearby hole saw the accident and rescued
Kramer, who wrecked his right kneecap and fractured a leg.</TE>
<TE>   "He darn near drowned," Schroeder said.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent New Year's Day with him, from 8 o'clock in the morning
until 9 o'clock that night, up at the UCLA Medical Center. We bet on
every ballgame all day long."</TE>
<TE>   Kramer gave his buddy another scare five months later when he
busted the same leg, taking a misstep while hailing a cab after a
dinner preceding another grandson's graduation from Texas Christian
University.</TE>
<TE>   "He spent a week in the hospital in Fort Worth, then was flat on
his back until October," Schroeder said.</TE>
<TE>   In a concession to age, aches and three hip operations, Kramer
hasn't played golf or tennis in seven years.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't run or play anymore, but I can walk," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder still gets out on the golf course by his home, but a bad
knee and arthritic back keep his rounds down to nine holes.</TE>
<TE>   Kramer, whose name appeared on 30 million Wilson tennis rackets,
is arguably the most influential man in tennis history, making his
impact on the game as a player, promoter, co-founder of the ATP and
commentator. He won Wimbledon in 1947, the U.S. title in 1946 and
'47, and was on winning Davis Cup teams in 1939, '46 and '47, the
last two with Schroeder as his partner.</TE>
<TE>   "He put more continuing pressure on an opponent than any other
player I ever saw or played against," said Schroeder, who first met
Kramer at the Los Angeles Tennis Club. "That goes all the way back to
Bill Tilden."</TE>
<TE>   Kramer was the best player in the world, amateur and pro, from
1946 until he quit in 1953. He could handle Don Budge, Bobby Riggs,
Pancho Gonzalez and Frank Sedgman, all the top players at the time.
What he couldn't handle, or wouldn't tolerate, were the rules that
kept him and other pros out of the Grand Slam tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had been playing at Wimbledon and the U.S. Nationals and the
others, I might have won 20-25 events over those years," Kramer said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Kramer promoted tours that laid the groundwork for the
era of open tennis that began in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud of forcing the people who ran the sport to turn to
the logic of open tennis, which made the Grand Slams and all the
associations around the world wealthy," Kramer said. "My tour, and
getting all the top players to turn pro, weakened the amateur game,
but the amateur game was phony. The kids were getting money but it
was under the table and it wasn't enough."</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder won the U.S. title in 1942, Wimbledon in 1949 and played
for U.S. Davis Cup teams from 1946 to 1951, compiling an 11-3 record.</TE>
<TE>   "We revolutionized the game in Melbourne in '46," Schroeder said.
"Nobody'd seen serve-and-volleyers before. It took the Australians
until '51 to catch up to us."</TE>
<TE>   Talk to Kramer and Schroeder and it's clear that they share more
than memories and interests. What they have between them is a deep
mutual respect that has endured throughout their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "Two things about Jack Kramer," Schroeder said. "No. 1, he's one
of the few people I know who have never changed one iota since I
first met him. No. 2, the world could be falling down upon my head
and Kramer is one of only two people I know in this world -- the
other is a friend in Australia -- where when you are around them the
world is automatically a happy place again."</TE>
<TE>   Says Kramer: "Ted is practically the only honest man I've ever
met. His word is good, he follows through on everything he's ever
done."</TE>

<HD>Vick Is No Match for Outdated Strategy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Oates</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dan Reeves and Wade Phillips, who coach Michael Vick's team, the
Atlanta Falcons, have always held that winning football is based on
an effective running offense and an efficient running defense.</LD>
<LD>   Thus Reeves, the Atlanta leader, and Phillips, his defensive
coordinator, are stubbornly playing runball in a passball era.</LD>
<LD>   Because Vick is their quarterback, though, the Falcons are 8-4-1.
What's more, they're looking at 11-4-1 going into their last three
games against Seattle today, then Detroit, then Cleveland.</LD>
<TE>   But their progress in the playoffs next month will depend on
whether the Falcons can modernize their game. They have a way to go.
In a 34-10 loss last Sunday, it was Reeves, not the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, who routed Vick. As for Phillips, his defensive strategy
led to Tampa Bay's three touchdown passes in the second quarter,
putting Vick in a hole so deep he couldn't climb out. Strategically,
the Falcons' game was a disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong Defense</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay passer Brad Johnson is the picture-perfect opposite of a
mobile quarterback. Nor is Johnson's offensive line well respected.
The Buccaneers' asset is Johnson's arm. Near or far, he can throw a
football straight. Yet, obviously, there are ways to attack good
passers who can't move and who play behind ordinary offensive
linemen.</TE>
<TE>   In Johnson's case, the way to beat him, his smartest opponents
say, is with a two-man blitz up the middle. They say it almost always
works. That's precisely what Atlanta didn't do.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips, the defensive coach in charge of stopping Johnson, lined
up the Falcons in conventional defenses designed, in the NFL idiom,
to stop the run and react to the pass. And stop the run they did, for
as long as the score was close.</TE>
<TE>   But Tampa's running game was not the problem. The threat was
passer Johnson -- who was left alone. That's just the way he likes
it. It's the only way he can get off a pass.</TE>
<TE>   Once in a while, Phillips blitzed him from the outside, but it is
the multiple inside blitz that a statue masquerading as a passer
can't handle.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong Offense</TE>
<TE>   Good defensive football is an art requiring different approaches
to different quarterbacks. Against a slow-footed passer like Johnson,
a hard rush up the middle works best, flushing him outside, where he
tends to be helpless. But against a running quarterback like Vick,
defensive teams want him inside.</TE>
<TE>   And when Vick was on the field, inside he was, but it took two
teams to keep him there, the other team and his own. His conventional
coach, Reeves, lost by playing conventional football with the most
unconventional quarterback of our times.</TE>
<TE>   The front four give the Buccaneers the league's best defense, but
they can be discouraged by quick, rather long passes thrown before
they can get to the passer -- just the kind Vick throws so well.</TE>
<TE>   The best formations for that kind of offense are those with four
wide receivers -- just the kind that Reeves didn't use.</TE>
<TE>   He's a Scrambler</TE>
<TE>   For Reeves, it was orthodox football as usual. His play selection
was as conventional as his strategy. And as detrimental to his
quarterback's style. Unlike others in 2002 football, Vick is both an
alert passer and an extraordinary runner who scrambles for his big
gainers.</TE>
<TE>   But scrambles begin as pass plays -- opening up the field -- and
the Falcons called few pass plays against Tampa until the second
half, when, far behind, they had to pass, and the Buccaneers knew it.
That is a wholly different problem. In terms of Vick's future, only
the first half was relevant. The second half -- in which a
22-year-old neophyte was playing catch-up against the league's
toughest and most mature defense -- doesn't count.</TE>
<TE>   At times, theoretically, Reeves could have used Vick as a
designated runner in planned running plays out of the quarterback
position; but fearing an injury, the Falcons frown on such plays, as
most football people believe they should.</TE>
<TE>   Anatomy of a Series</TE>
<TE>   A second-quarter sequence was typical of Vick's day a week ago.
After his passes had moved the Falcons to the Tampa 15-yard line,
Reeves killed the drive -- and his quarterback -- with two
conventional calls. On first down and again on second and long,
predictably, Atlanta ran the ball, not with Vick but with two others,
totaling two yards.</TE>
<TE>   That made it third and eight, when, again predictably, Reeves put
Vick in shotgun formation as Tampa's fast front four closed in on him
while their seven teammates covered Vick's receivers. Predictably,
the pass fell incomplete, for, in that situation, good defensive
players can easily handle either option, pass or run. Finally, on
fourth down, Atlanta kicked a field goal.</TE>
<TE>   That afternoon, the thing that made Vick's life unbearable was the
Falcons' running-play mind-set: running to set up passing. To shut
him down, the Buccaneers, good as they are defensively, needed
precisely what Atlanta gave them.</TE>
<TE>   Best Passing Team</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Rich Gannon of the Oakland Raiders will lead the
world's greatest passing team into Miami today for the game of the
week against the smart, tough Dolphin defense. Just a year ago, as
coached by Jon Gruden, the Raiders were only potentially the finest.
For Gruden wanted to run the ball -- as he still does in Tampa, where
he was persuaded to throw it last week only by the kind of defense
Atlanta showed him.</TE>
<TE>   In Oakland, by contrast, the new coach this year, Bill Callahan,
45, prefers passes instead of runs, regardless of down, distance, or
field position. And his quarterback, Gannon, 36, has been cooperating
magnificently.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego last week, Gannon threw the ball on nearly every snap
to build a 20-7 lead that rose in the end to a surprisingly lopsided
27-7.</TE>
<TE>   So doing, the Raiders succeeded the Rams and New England Patriots
-- last winter's Super Bowl pair -- as the NFL's great passing
machine. The Rams have lost their quarterbacks and most of their
offensive line. The Patriots still have the know-how and the required
passer, Tom Brady, but not Gannon's kind of receivers.</TE>
<TE>   Because of Callahan, Gannon and Oakland owner Al Davis -- a
longtime proponent of the thrown ball -- the Raiders this year are
keeping alive the passball revolution that former San Francisco Coach
Bill Walsh started in the 1980s. And not only that. The Raiders' 9-4
is best in the AFC.</TE>
<TE>   Gannon MVP?</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers were the victim of Gannon's short-pass, ball-control
offense, which resembles the offense that Walsh and his quarterback,
Joe Montana, introduced 20 years ago. Since their day, passing teams
have won most of the pro championships.</TE>
<TE>   Gannon, a leading MVP candidate, has perfected the quarterback's
role in such an offense, the other indispensable parts being good
blockers up front and good runners for change-of-pace draw plays and
the like.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, one of the runners, Walsh always said, must double as
super in the passing game. At Oakland, that's Charlie Garner.
Together with wide receivers Jerry Rice, Tim Brown and Jerry Porter
and a tight end -- frequently the big new tight end, Doug Jolley --
Garner gives Gannon five first-class short-pass targets. Since one of
the five is open on virtually every play, the Raiders keep passing.
And driving. And winning.</TE>
<TE>   This year, unlike last year under Gruden, the Raiders don't bother
to set up their pass offense with running plays. They simply come out
passing. The Chargers, with one of the NFL's best defenses, spent
last Sunday trying to do something about it, but the truth is that
few opponents can.</TE>
<TE>   One Oakland bonus is that it's easier to protect a small lead in
the fourth quarter with small-ball passing than any other way. On a
recent Monday night, for example, the New York Jets were only six
points behind the Raiders with six minutes remaining but couldn't
regain possession in time to win. Instead, Gannon simply kept
passing. And driving. And ... you know.</TE>
<TE>   Deep-Red Zone</TE>
<TE>   As coach of the Raiders, Callahan continues to show off one of the
league's great red-zone offenses -- except, in his case, it's more of
a deep-red-zone offense. The Raiders aren't automatic touchdown
makers from an opponent's 20-yard line in. Nor is any team. But in
the final 10 yards this fall, the Raiders have been devastating.</TE>
<TE>   Down there, they shift to a running offense, abandoning the pass
offense that carries them down the field. The Gannon pass threat is
always present, to be sure, but the Raiders have learned to run in
the deep-red zone. Thus at San Diego, on another 300-yard passing day
for Gannon, they scored all three touchdowns with running plays.</TE>
<TE>   Strangest of all, Callahan has been using three running backs. At
the 10-yard line, the Raiders rely on Garner. When they get to the
five-yard line, they run Tyrone Wheatley. At the one-yard line, they
call on Zack Crockett.</TE>
<TE>   Five Guesses</TE>
<TE>   * Oakland to win by one or two points over favored Miami at Pro
Player Stadium. This is a must-win for both teams.</TE>
<TE>   * San Francisco by a field goal over Green Bay on Candlestick
Point. The Packers have Brett Favre. The 49ers have Jeff Garcia and
Terrell Owens.</TE>
<TE>   * Kansas City by one or two points over favored Denver on Invesco
Field at Mile High. If the Broncos are going to win every time at
home, so be it. But the Chiefs are better now.</TE>
<TE>   * San Diego by one or two over favored Buffalo at Ralph Wilson
Stadium. The Chargers don't figure. What does figure is that their
luck will change soon.</TE>
<TE>   * New England by a field goal Monday night over favored Tennessee
at Nashville Coliseum. On a neutral field, Patriot quarterback Tom
Brady, the Super Bowl MVP, would outplay the Titans' Steve McNair.</TE>

<HD>Rock 'n' Rollers, Your Tab Is Running at the Rainbow</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The platform boots, the Spandex, the big hair, the dog collars--the
Rainbow Bar &amp; Grill has seen it all during three decades as playroom
of choice to the Sunset Strip's flamboyant rock 'n' roll strutters.
Oh, if those walls could talk. From the bustling side patio and
parking lot pickup scene to the dining room's dimly lit red leather
booths to the intimate "Over the Rainbow Room" upstairs, where the
Beatles once hung out, the place exudes decadent cachet. We reminisce
with owner Mario Maglieri, 79, the silver-haired father figure who
reigns over the Rainbow and legendary rock-club neighbor, the Whisky
A Go-Go.</LD>
<LD>   Did you intend to work in rock 'n' roll?</LD>
<LD>   No. I came into the Whisky in 1964 as a manager. Now I have the
building and I have the business. I don't know how I ended up with
it, but that's how business goes. I had clubs in Chicago, and I came
out here because the fella who had the Whisky at the time, Elmer
Valentine, called me needing help with the business--and it was
fantastic. He had groups coming in like the Turtles, John Mayall and
Eric Clapton. That's how I got started out here.</LD>
<TE>   What was the Strip like when you opened the Rainbow?</TE>
<TE>   The Strip in 1972 was young people. They'd gather together, smoke
a joint or whatever. It was a laid-back thing. You didn't have the
hard drugs that you have today. It was all peace and love.</TE>
<TE>   Who were your earliest rock star regulars?</TE>
<TE>   Led Zeppelin. Every time they were in town, they'd party in the
middle booth. And them guys know how to party!</TE>
<TE>   How did the Rainbow become home away from home for rockers?</TE>
<TE>   A lot of people who own bars and restaurants act like they're so
above everybody else. I don't do that. You have to make friends with
people--you gotta greet them by their name. People love to be
noticed. I feed 'em. Like Matt Sorum from Guns N' Roses. I used to
give him soup and bread. These poor guys don't have any money,
they're musicians. So I take 'em in. I won't give 'em booze. But if
they're hungry, I'll feed 'em.</TE>
<TE>   What's the secret to staying in business with customers who like
to throw TV sets out of windows?</TE>
<TE>   It's very simple. If a guy stood up on a table, you tell him,
"Either sit down or I throw you out." That's the way you gotta be
with them. They know if they don't behave, they'll get thrown out and
they won't be let back in. And they always want to get back in!</TE>
<TE>   Who were your rowdiest customers?</TE>
<TE>   Oh, Guns N' Roses! I had to put them out I don't know how many
times! They'd get rowdy and throw bread at people. They're good guys
but they get out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   What about that occupational hazard of rock, drugs?</TE>
<TE>   I try to tell young people that drugs aren't the way to go. Like
Jim Morrison. I babied that guy day in and day out [at the Whisky]. I
used to grab him and go, "Why are you ruining your life?" and he'd
just look up at me [and say,] "Oh, Mario..." He went down the tubes
like so many guys. It's sad.</TE>
<TE>   You've lived through glam, metal, punk, grunge, hip-hop. Which era
is your favorite?</TE>
<TE>   Every year. I love rock 'n' roll. Even the guys coming up, they
get an E for effort.</TE>
<TE>   OK, but what era was your least favorite?</TE>
<TE>   The punk guys like Sid Vicious. They weren't out to make music,
they were out to destroy things. I had to close the Whisky for a
couple of years because they'd walk out of the club and break car
windows and yell at people. It's not that I'm against punk music. I
used to sit in the car with John Belushi and listen to bands like
Fear. He loved that stuff. It's fine as long as you don't hurt other
people.</TE>
<TE>   Which customer did you most love?</TE>
<TE>   I loved a girl named Janis Joplin. She was just a priceless lady.
She had stringy hair and dirty fingernails. She'd come in [to the
Whisky] and say, "Gimme a Southern Comfort on the rocks--I want the
whole bottle!" She had that raspy voice. To me she was beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   Who are your high-wattage regulars these days?</TE>
<TE>   Lemmy from Motorhead. He likes to play the pinball machines, so
he's in here all the time. [The late] John Entwistle used to hang
here when he was in town. We have a lot of rappers coming here now,
like B-Real from Cypress Hill, Dino from Fear Factory. They come in
by droves.</TE>
<TE>   Give us the worst Rainbow Room pickup line.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, baby, I'm a producer. I'll put you in the movies!</TE>

<HD>A Labor of Love</HD>
<DH>The Preparations for Her Family's Italian Holiday Meal Were
Extensive, but the Payoff Was Worth the Effort</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MAURIELLO BAKER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Each Christmas Eve, when I cook my family's traditional Italian
seafood extravaganza, there's only one compliment that matters: "Dad
would be proud."</LD>
<LD>   My father, Salvatore Mauriello, an Italian immigrant, was a barber
by trade but a chef at heart. Dad loved to experiment in the kitchen,
and Christmas Eve dinner was no exception. For many Italian families,
this is the meal of the year. As far back as I can remember, my
mother and father would prepare this meal for as many as 22 people.
It was always a sit-down affair, never a buffet, and the menu had
three essential components: linguine with filbert sauce, cioppino
with seafood, and baked clams--all served with loaves of hard-crusted
bread.</LD>
<LD>   My most vivid childhood memory is of my parents standing at the
kitchen sink on Christmas Eve with small vegetable brushes preparing
the cioppino--scrubbing littleneck clams, peeling and deveining
shrimp, cutting and cleaning lobster tails. The process took hours
and, because the seafood had to be fresh, it was a task that couldn't
be done in advance.</LD>
<TE>   Each year my father would drive to San Pedro the day before to
ensure that the seafood was top quality. Compared to the prep work,
the actual cooking was a quick but flamboyant process in which Dad
artfully tossed garlic, spices, wine, lemon slices and tomato sauce
into a huge pot. My mother would stand behind him cautioning not to
make it too hot, but my father hated being constrained in the kitchen
so we all learned to eat his way.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, shortly before my father's death, we moved Christmas Eve
dinner to my house in West L.A. My father protested, but it had
become too much work for him and Mom. I had graduated to the big
time--scrubbing clams and cleaning shrimp. But Dad still did all the
cooking and I sat glued to his side, watching as he'd add a little
more garlic to the shrimp marinade or filberts to the linguine sauce.
After a few years of assisting, I learned to prepare the dinner solo.
Mom, who's now 92, looks over my shoulder just as I did over Dad's.
Of course, over the years we've been able to cut the prep time by
using a food processor and buying fresh seafood from my nephew, who
works in the food industry and lives nearby. One thing, however,
remains constant. We still have to scrub the clams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Linguine with Filbert Sauce</TE>
<TE>   Serves 4 to 5</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups raw filberts</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups dry white wine, divided in half</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   8 large garlic cloves, crushed</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1-pound linguine</TE>
<TE>   Using pulse setting on food processor, chop nuts into  1/4 -inch
pieces. Do not over chop. Place nuts in bowl; pour half the wine (
3/4 cup) over nuts. Cover with plastic wrap; marinate in refrigerator
4 hours. Combine oil, garlic, salt, pepper, red pepper and parsley in
saucepan; saute ingredients over medium heat until garlic just begins
to brown, about 3 minutes. Stir often to avoid burning. Add nuts with
wine marinade to seasonings. Add remaining  3/4 cup wine. Cook over
medium heat for 8 minutes. Remove from heat; set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, prepare linguine according to package directions. About
2 minutes before draining, ladle out 2 cups pasta water; add to spice
and nut mixture; stir well. Cook over medium heat 2 minutes. Sauce
will remain thin. Drain linguine; top with sauce.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cioppino</TE>
<TE>   Serves 6 to 8</TE>
<TE>   25 littleneck or cherrystone clams</TE>
<TE>   8 lobster tails, 4 to 6 ounces each</TE>
<TE>   16 ounces dry white wine, divided in half</TE>
<TE>   30 shrimp (16 to 20 per pound)</TE>
<TE>   8 ounces extra virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   15 large garlic cloves, crushed</TE>
<TE>   4 shallots, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons salt</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons coarse ground black pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper (use  1/4 teaspoon for less spicy
version)</TE>
<TE>   1 cup fresh parsley, chopped</TE>
<TE>   6 round lemon slices, 1/8-inch thick</TE>
<TE>   16 ounces tomato sauce, unseasoned</TE>
<TE>   Under cold running water, scrub clams with stiff brush,
particularly along hinge of shell. Refrigerate until ready to use.
With kitchen scissors, cut off small fins along each side of lobster
tail, leaving large tail fins at end. Cut lengthwise along soft
underside of lobster shell, removing 1-inch strip along length. Rinse
lobster under cold running water and drain. Place lobster in large
dish. Add 1 cup white wine; cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate 6
hours.</TE>
<TE>   With your fingers, peel away shell on shrimp, leaving tail shell
in place. Using kitchen scissors, make shallow cut along outside
curve of shrimp. Under cold running water, remove vein with fingers.
Rinse again and drain. Place shrimp in large dish and add 1 cup white
wine. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 6 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Combine oil, garlic, shallots, salt, black pepper, red pepper,
parsley and lemon in pot. Saute ingredients over medium heat until
garlic just begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Stir often to avoid
burning.</TE>
<TE>   Place lobster tails, meat side down in pot, reserving wine
marinade. Cook tails 12 minutes, turning halfway through cooking.
Move lobster around pot occasionally to prevent sticking. Remove from
pot and set aside. Repeat until all lobster has been cooked.</TE>
<TE>   Place fresh clams in pot. Add wine marinade from lobster. Cover
and steam over medium-high heat until clams open, about 8 minutes.
Add tomato sauce and stir to blend. Return lobster tails to pot. Cook
in sauce another 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Add shrimp and wine marinade, stirring well. Cook until shrimps
turn pink, about 4 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately in large bowl.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baked Clams</TE>
<TE>   Serves 4 to 6</TE>
<TE>   25 fresh littleneck or cherrystone clams (about 1 1/2 inches in
diameter)</TE>
<TE>   2 cups water</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   4 large garlic cloves, crushed</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoons salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper</TE>
<TE>   Dash to 1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup dry white wine</TE>
<TE>   1 lemon, sliced in 1/8-inch rounds, pits removed</TE>
<TE>   1 cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs</TE>
<TE>   Cheesecloth</TE>
<TE>   Under cold running water, scrub clams with stiff brush,
particularly along hinge of shell. Arrange clams in 5-quart pot; add
water. Cover and steam over medium heat 6 to 7 minutes. Stir clams,
making sure any as yet unopened clams are in the water. Cover and
continuing steaming until all clams open, about additional 5 to 6
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Use tongs to remove clams from pot. Set aside to cool. Strain clam
cooking water through cheesecloth to remove sand. Set liquid aside to
cool.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, combine oil, garlic, salt, black pepper, red pepper,
parsley, wine and 3 lemon slices in bowl. Add strained clam liquid.
Stir well.</TE>
<TE>   When clams are cool enough to handle, break shells apart by
bending them at hinge, removing any particles of broken shell. With
your fingers, remove the clam from shell. Clean waste pocket by
breaking skin and rinsing under cold water. Set aside. Rinse shells
in cold water and pat dry. Arrange in baking dish. Place one clam in
each shell. Stir liquid before dousing each clam to keep spices well
mixed. Carefully spoon seasoned liquid over each clam, filling the
shell. Sprinkle breadcrumbs on each clam, filling shell. Carefully
spoon just enough liquid to moisten breadcrumbs.</TE>
<TE>   Arrange remaining lemons around edges of dish. Brown under broiler
10 to 15 minutes, or until breadcrumbs turn golden brown. Spoon sauce
from bottom of baking dish over each clam before serving.</TE>

<HD>A season in purgatory</HD>
<DH>The Men and Women Who Join the State's Department of
Forestry and Fire Protection Dream of Heroism. Sometimes They Have to
Settle for the Joy of Camaraderie and the Comfort of Routine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>Geoffrey Mohan is a Times staff writer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They wait. It is the bulk of their job, this waiting, and they fill
it with necessary tasks. They roll hose. They clean the engine. They
hone their bodies. They ready themselves for fire.</LD>
<LD>   Few of them can articulate what compels them to fight wildland
fires. They fall back on describing their obsession in bits and
pieces: the hikes, the outdoor work, the camaraderie, the deadly
magnificence of flame. To Brian Beresford, a Native American and
captain in the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection,
it's simple: ''It's the only way left to be a warrior.''</LD>
<LD>   This is the story of a half-dozen warriors and their season with
the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. It is the
story of childhood dreams and the adult realities that intrude on
them. For some, the compulsion to fight fires started with TV's
''Emergency.'' They wanted to be Johnny Gage or Roy DeSoto, rushing
on Rescue Squad 51 to Rampart General. Others panicked at the
prospect of a bleak office cubicle. Some found a family they never
had.</LD>
<TE>   The warriors know that most people think they have the coolest job
on the block. But while the post-Sept. 11 hagiography of firefighting
aptly honors the dead of the World Trade Center, it's hard to be a
hero every day. Particularly if on that day you scrub the station
toilets, polish the truck, lug 65 pounds of hose on a practice hike,
cook for your crew, and then watch someone else's fire on the news.</TE>
<TE>   Even when the warriors get the fire they crave, opportunities for
heroism are limited: smoke jumpers and dive-bombing water drops are
the exception, not the norm. The vast bulk of firefighting is mule
work, cutting and scratching lines around fires with simple hand
tools, laying down hundreds of feet of hose to cool down the burn
area well after the firestorm has subsided. That tedium is the
equity, socked away a day at a time, cashed in for the few
astonishing moments lived at the perilous edge.</TE>
<TE>   Each spring and summer, the California Department of Forestry and
Fire Protection ranks swell with 1,450 itinerant firefighters, hired
for anywhere from a summer to nine months. They are mostly young;
many can't order a beer legally. Another 200 of the agency's
permanent firefighting cadre (3,800 men and women) are pushed up to
temporary officer positions, the young leading the younger. Those who
come to the Yucaipa station, at the eastern edge of the San Gabriel
Mountains, are a mixed lot. A few have college degrees. Others joke
that they picked CDF because those were the letters they saw most
often on their report cards.</TE>
<TE>   During this year's fire season, Todd Williams, a former business
major assigned to a CDF hazardous-materials unit in Riverside, will
bump up from engineer to captain of a wildland crew for the first
time. He is 35. Shana Shuttleworth, 32, will struggle to prove she
can drive a fire engine like the men, and lead a rookie crew. Rusty
McCulley, 30, will chalk up what he hopes will be his pivotal
season--or he'll have to go back to selling motorcycles. Brett
Taylor, 20, will live with his parents, hoard his salary and spend it
this winter on college courses that will boost his firefighting
credentials. Rob Menor, who traded civil engineering for fighting
fires, will see some of the best fires the year has to offer. He'll
turn 20 during the burning season. David Roberts, also 20, will taste
disappointment. They'll be watched over by Clyde Chittenden, a
taciturn, 48-year-old battalion chief who juggles duty as Yucaipa's
fire chief with supervising strike teams sent to battle wildland
fires throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   The first reality check for wildfire warriors comes early. The job
isn't just about forest fires. The men and women with the pine tree
on their shoulder patch and the bear on their badge also fight
structure fires, rescue people from wrecked cars and serve as the
rural or municipal fire departments for 23 counties, a dozen cities
and more than a score of special fire districts statewide. In
Yucaipa, a city transitioning from chicken farms and orange groves to
tract homes and golf courses, that means CDF firefighters run out to
trailer parks a half-dozen times a day to attend to elderly victims
of strokes, falls or loneliness. While there are plenty of CDF
firefighters happy to fulfill these urban duties, for those looking
for wildland blazes, serving on the city engine is like catching in
the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   The ride of preference is Engine 3576, a short, muscular truck
made for bad roads. It's one of a pair of wildland firefighting
engines housed at Yucaipa that can be called anywhere in the
state--anywhere in the country, if needed. For most of the year,
Chittenden has struggled to keep either of the state-wide engines in
house. They've been to fires every week, and other engines and crews
have moved up to cover for them.</TE>
<TE>   The season started in January, months ahead of schedule,
with fires that burned as angry as a summer inferno. By mid-November,
7,622 fires had charred 491,333 acres statewide, well above the
average over the last five years, which have been among the worst
spans in state history, according to the CDF and the U.S. Forest
Service. (Nationwide, 7.1 million acres went up in flames, the worst
tally in a half-century, according to the National Inter-Agency Fire
Center in Boise, Idaho.)</TE>
<TE>   If there's a time and a place to be a wildland firefighter, it's
now, in Southern California, where what does not burn in summer can
be whipped to flames by the Santa Ana winds of fall.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 27, the place for the warriors to be is Julian, in San
Diego County. Several suspicious fires break out in the early
morning, and Chittenden gathers a strike team of five engines--20
firefighters--from San Bernardino County. Julian is familiar
territory. Two weeks prior, Chittenden had returned from a weeklong
fire near the small town that consumed 61,000 acres, destroyed 37
homes and left him slack-jawed at tornadoes of flame dancing across
50-acre swaths of knotty manzanita.</TE>
<TE>   ''I've been in this business for 25 years and I'm seeing things
literally that I've never seen before,'' Chittenden tells his team as
they gather shortly before dawn in the parking lot of the CDF
headquarters in San Bernardino. There are ''four or five'' fires, all
suspected arson, he warns. ''None of them are really screaming, but
assuming this guy or gal continues [setting them] there'll be more
action,'' he says. ''Let's not kill ourselves getting down there. We
know the route.'' With that, the strike team heads south. All told,
CDF will send 25 engines at a cost of $55,000 a day.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Williams takes a seat beside the engineer and Rusty McCulley
rides behind him. They don't know much about each other. Williams
grew up in Orange County, in a milieu of surfing, suburbia and punk
rock. McCulley was either on welfare or homeless most of his
childhood, following the threadbare dreams of his grandmother. He
grew up mostly in Upper Lake, a tiny town in Lake County.</TE>
<TE>   ''We were always on welfare,'' he explains. ''We were always
moving. Actually, the whole story was there was going to be this
family-uniting thing. My real mom was going to come out from Texas,
and we were all going to move to Oregon and be this big happy
family.'' They packed an old Impala with all their possessions and
headed to Oregon. When they realized their dreams didn't match their
funds, they turned back to California. The money finally ran out
around Redding. ''We picked up cans and whatever to get money for gas
and food,'' McCulley says. ''We'd live in rest-stops, off the side of
the highway. This one time we ran completely out of money and we were
trapped, on the Sacramento River. We just lived there for a while.''</TE>
<TE>   A hulking man whose biker looks belie a gentle manner, McCulley
jokes that he can win any hard-luck contest. He spent time in a
foster home. Even when they did settle down, he left home after a
spat over dating a Hupa Indian girl. McCulley spent most of high
school living on friends' couches or spare beds. At the same time, he
started hanging out in a firehouse in Upper Lake. The firefighters
let him do gofer work; then they started taking him to fires.</TE>
<TE>   ''I thought that was just the most exciting, best thing in the
world,'' he says. ''I got a little pager and a little tiny badge, a
little uniform, and I loved it.''</TE>
<TE>   As soon as he graduated from high school, McCulley joined the U.S.
Forest Service as a firefighter and eventually switched to the CDF.
''It's like a family I never really had. Brothers I never really had.
People that really care about you.''</TE>
<TE>   As they drive south toward the Cleveland National Forest, Williams
takes the temperature and humidity with a field kit. It's 90 degrees
with 17% humidity, and they're barely out of the morning rush hour. A
mile past Santa Ysabel on State Highway 79, they pass the Inaja
picnic area, where there is a memorial to 11 dead wildland
firefighters. Every rule that will govern their behavior in the wild,
the ones Williams drums into seasonals heads, was born in this
killing field.</TE>
<TE>   During a wildfire on Nov. 25, 1956, a sudden shift of wind flicked
a finger of flame up-canyon toward an inmate crew, trapping them
mid-slope above the San Diego River. With nowhere to run, three U.S.
Forest Service rangers, a prison guard and seven inmates died in the
ensuing blowup. What emerged from the Inaja incident are the 10
Standard Orders for firefighters, which all wild- land firefighters
commit to memory: ''Keep informed of fire weather conditions and
forecast . . . know what your fire is doing at all times . . . have
escape routes and make them known.''</TE>
<TE>   Williams quizzes his charges on this when the opportunity arises.
How much faster does a fire move uphill than on the flats? (About 16
times faster.) When they do something wrong, he teases: ''How could
this accident have been prevented?'' It's the question he'd have to
fill in on the accident form. They get his point.</TE>
<TE>   Being overtaken by flames is the top cause of death in nearly a
century of chronicled wildland fire battles, according to federal
statistics. The introduction of aircraft--Inaja also was the first
place where aerial retardant was dropped-- has put aviation accidents
in second place, followed closely by heart attacks, vehicle
accidents, and falling limbs and rocks. Wildland firefighters now
carry fire shelters. Dubbed ''shake-and-bakes,'' they're a kind of
pup tent made of aluminum foil bonded to fiberglass cloth. Since
coming into widespread use in the 1970s, shelters are credited with
saving the lives of about 250 firefighters, according to the National
Wildfire Coordinating Group. One survivor of a blowup, quoted in a
shelter manual, describes his experience as "a nuclear blast
occurring right over you, and you're lying in tinfoil.''</TE>
<TE>   At times like these, fire instructors advise their students to
concentrate on reasons to live--a wife, a child, anything--to calm
the rising panic that urges them to get up and run. One short breath
of super-heated gas will asphyxiate a firefighter, and temperatures
in a wildland fire can range to 1,600 degrees. Four wildland
firefighters forced to deploy shelters on a rocky slope could not
seal out those gases and were asphyxiated in a Washington state fire
last year. Most wildland firefighters get through a career without
ever taking a shelter out of a pouch slung on the belt of their web
gear. But you can see their hand reach to check it every time they
walk toward a fire.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the strike team gets to Julian, there is little smoke
visible on any horizon. The biggest fire, about 200 acres, has been
brought under control, with a line cut around its entire perimeter.
There's a strange sense of victory and disappointment when Chittenden
tells the strike team to ''find some shade'' and rest up for a night
shift of mopping up what's left. For six hours, strike team members
play spades, tease, try to nap, and listen to others talk about
flames that have come and gone.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is unfazed by what the job tosses him. ''It's all good,''
he says, a kind of mantra for the Yucaipa crew.</TE>
<TE>   ''I was one of those kids who grew up watching 'Emergency,' ''
Williams confesses. 'I know that sounds trite, but I looked at that
and said, 'That's the coolest thing ever.' I liked Johnny Gage,
because he was always playing with people. I'm a lot like that.''</TE>
<TE>   He was supposed to take over his father's machine-shop business,
and he enrolled in a business-administration track at Cal State
Fullerton. 'I mean, the degree was cool, and I loved going to
college, but I just didn't want to take that over. You know, your
parents want you to do one thing and you want to do another. I told
them, 'Hey, that's just not what I want to do.' It worked out real
good.''</TE>
<TE>   Williams put in a year as a volunteer at a small department in
Riverside County and two seasons with CDF when he took a permanent
job as a dispatcher. ''Who wants to be a seasonal firefighter when
you have a house payment?'' He was engaged to a young woman he'd met
in Hemet, but wasn't going to marry her until he got a permanent
firefighter position. When she finally told him to pick a date or
pack a bag, they chose Oct. 2.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm not kidding, we drove home from lunch the day we picked a
date. There was a message from this lady in Fresno, from CDF:
'Congratulations, Riverside submitted your name for the permanent
academy and you'll be going to the permanent academy starting Oct.
9,' '' Williams recalls. "So we got married, went on a four-day
honeymoon in San Diego and then I left for six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   ''It was the same thing when my second daughter was born. She was
like 2 months old when they sent me to the engineer academy for
another four weeks. I said, 'You guys aren't helping me out here at
all.' ''</TE>
<TE>   By sundown, Engine 3576 takes its post in the burn area. Williams,
McCulley and a half-dozen other firefighters grab shovels and
Pulaskis--a combination axe and grub-hoe--and walk about 4,000 feet
of hose laid through the woods by a day crew. They check for leaks
and search for spot fires. At an altitude of 4,500 feet, it's a hard
hike, and they step carefully over the sharp stobs of manzanita, cut
away by fire crews. There isn't much fire left. They pause and watch
the chalk-like streaks of shooting stars, stragglers from the
summer's Perseid meteor shower. It's all good.</TE>
<TE>   For the rest of the night, the warriors stand on the wood porch of
a summer house, watching an inmate crew's headlamps dance across the
darkened terrain from one smoldering fire to another. A few compare
details on dirt bikes they have at home. Williams runs into an old
friend, and they chat about his new swimming pool. Clyde Chittenden
tells of rescuing a boa constrictor from a motor home's engine
compartment.</TE>
<TE>   If his mother had had her say, Chittenden would have been a
druggist behind a counter in a quiet town. He had taken all the
college premed courses to fulfill her dream and was interning at a
pharmacy, counting pills at a counter, when it struck him: ''I said,
'Oh, my God, I've never been so bored in my life.' '' So Chittenden
stuffed his schedule with fire-science courses and became a paid-call
firefighter in Crestline, in the San Bernardino National Forest--a
bottom-rung assignment where you sit in a firehouse and get paid only
if you go to a call. ''I still vividly remember the first call I went
on was a structure fire, walking into a room with fire all around,
and I said, 'This is what I want to be doing for the rest of my life.
' ''</TE>
<TE>   In the early morning hours in Julian, Williams curls his six-foot
frame into the front seat of the engine. The rest lay sleeping bags
on lawns or driveways, or curl up beside a smoldering stump. It's
lousy sleep, and they rise groggy. Chittenden orders a crew to put
out their "keep-warm'' fire. A frightened citizen has called to
report it. ''We were putting it out,'' a firefighter jokes back. ''It
just took us all night.'' As they head off to town, Williams smiles.
'We'll be heroes now, just watch,'' he jokes. Sure enough, residents
who have gone through their second wildfire scare in a month wave and
smile, and the firefighters of Engine 3576 smile back. Firefighters
did save homes. It just wasn't Engine 3576.</TE>
<TE>   Agency rules require eight hours of rest before a strike team can
head home. In the old days, that meant a tent in a noisy fire camp.
Now the warriors head to the Julian Inn and pair up in a room--an
arrangement the agency has calculated as cheaper than paying for the
infrastructure of setting up camps. When they awake shortly after
noon, they're told to get dinner and head home. An arson suspect has
been caught, a firefighter with the California Conservation Corps, a
dropout from Nebraska who wanted to earn some cash fighting fires,
according to Chittenden. This year, part-time firefighters have been
accused of setting several blazes. They include an $8-an-hour
unemployed firefighter charged with burning a half-million acres in
Arizona. Arrests like that tarnish the image of salaried
firefighters, but they shrug it off with a joke about getting out of
town quickly, while they're still heroes.</TE>
<TE>   When engine 3576 lumbers into Lytle Creek Canyon northwest of San
Bernardino on Sept. 6, the radio is tuned to KCAL, 96.7 FM, and Brett
Taylor tells a crew member to turn it up. "Gimme fuel, gimme fire,
gimme that which I desire!'' blasts from the radio, the lyrics of a
Metallica song. The crew laughs. A hellish landscape surrounds them.
Flames surge along three sides of a steep canyon. Spot fires dot the
sparse grove of fir and pine on the canyon bottom, where smoking
stumps burn like caldrons.</TE>
<TE>   There's fuel, and there's fire. This is the second strike-team
assignment in as many weeks for Engine 3576, a pace that has been
routine for most of the year. Taylor, a second-year seasonal from San
Bernardino, is joined by Katie Forrest, a college student, and Menor,
who's been at Yucaipa for little more than a month. It's a mop-up
assignment on a fire that has raced from the thick chaparral at the
canyon's narrow entrance up into the timbered peaks of its end,
burning 400 acres so far. Fire officials are counting on the sheer
rock faces and some quick bulldozer work to keep it from barreling on
to Mount Baldy or Wrightsville.</TE>
<TE>   The strike team, meanwhile, has to put out some ''slop-over'' on
the canyon floor.</TE>
<TE>   With enough water, almost anyone can put out a fire. Putting one
out this deep in the woods is an art of using as little water as
possible. Most wildland fire engines carry 350 to 500 gallons, and
sometimes that's barely enough to fill a few thousand feet of hose
line and spray for a few minutes. Tanker trucks can take an hour or
more to retrieve water for refills.</TE>
<TE>   The tools of the task are Pulaskis, shovels and small bladder bags
filled with foamy water. The warriors divide into pairs and wander
off, smudgy yellow ghosts in the dim arc of their own headlamps.
There is little dirt to bury the embers, and each shovel-full comes
up with scaly rock instead. They pause from time to time and crane
their heads to catch the loud crack, whoosh and thud of a burned tree
falling. Showers of orange sparks whip across the bowl, and embers
cascade down the mountainsides with a sound like broken glass. Before
long, a pale cantaloupe-colored crescent moon rises, gliding along
the silhouette of a mountain. It's quiet, except for the scrape of
shovels.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner is a sack lunch--''sack nasties,'' as they call
them--filled with a ham-and-cheese sandwich or two, the occasional
cold and salty bean burrito, and the treasured Payday, Skittles,
chocolate-chip cookies and granola bars. While they can be fitness
freaks, wildland firefighters eat more like lumberjacks than
triathletes. An average fire-camp menu includes eggs, sausage and
greasy potatoes in the morning, and steak, potatoes and an
over-boiled vegetable for dinner. Personal snacks include sunflower
seeds and beef jerky. Cigarette smoking, once common among the
firefighters, has been replaced by chewing tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the crew members still have the metabolism of a teenager.
Taylor, in fact, will turn 20 after midnight and is hoping to get
released from the fire in time to celebrate. He'll make as much as
$25,000 in a long fire season--March through November in Southern
California--and save almost all of it by living with his parents in
San Bernardino. This winter he will spend most of his savings at
Victorville College, where he'll take the courses that will earn him
more points to get hired permanently.</TE>
<TE>   In high school he wanted to be an arson investigator. ''I went to
Redlands as an Explorer [Scout] and fought my first fire, and decided
this is what I want to be.''</TE>
<TE>   Menor, in his first season, will turn 20 a week after Taylor. His
name's pronounced Men-OOR, he tells the crew, and, yes, he's heard
''manure'' jokes since second grade. A smart student in high school,
he was working toward a civil engineering degree when two
firefighting buddies detoured him. ''At first, my parents were
questioning it, the dangers,'' he says. ''They said, 'You can have a
job inside, in an air-conditioned office.' I just couldn't see doing
that.''</TE>
<TE>   By 2:45 a.m., eye-burning smoke is settling thickly in the canyon,
and it is quiet but for war stories and falling trees. Up canyon, a
supervisor fires flares into the canyon sides, showing rookies how to
light back-fires. The flares burst in bright flowers against the dark
hillside. The warriors watch like kids on the Fourth of July. They
roll hoses and stuff them into rucksacks stored on the back of the
engine. When there are no more chores left, the captain tells them to
get some sleep. Taylor says he'll stand watch. Getting an hour or two
of bad sleep is worse than none, he reasons.</TE>
<TE>   At 6:15, the radio hisses to life with the news that fire has
jumped the line. If it crests the canyon ridge, the next stop is
Wrightsville. ''I think if we round up the engines and rally the
troops we can chase this one down,'' a weary voice on the radio says.
Taylor rouses the crew, but they've already heard it; even when
they're asleep, their minds filter the background chatter. Up the
road, a three-acre blaze is taking off into the timber. A tall snag
torches off, casting an eerie silhouette of a burning cross. Each
crew member hoists a rucksack filled with two 100-foot coils of 1
3/4-inch, canvas-covered hose. They weigh 65 pounds, and the straps
dig at their shoulders. In minutes, heart rates leap from a sleep
rate to a sprint as they head up a slope pitched like a church roof.
Heavy cotton clothing under the fire-resistent Nomex gear was
comfortable for nighttime temperatures. Now it drapes like wet
towels.</TE>
<TE>   A crew of inmates arrives and scratches away at the duff of the
forest floor while the engine crews assemble a hose line up a sinuous
path along the left flank of the fire, cooling off its edges so it
won't creep back over the hose. Another group advances up the right
flank, hoping to pinch off the head of the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Those who carry the hose, stiffened now with water, call out the
slack left before it runs out: ''20 feet . . . 10 feet--that's
hose!'' In a matter of seconds, they grab a new coil of hose, called
a ''stick,'' unfurling it downhill. In a choreography of hands and
shouts, they clamp the hose, remove the nozzle, couple the new stick,
reattach the nozzle, unclamp the hose line and pay it forward. If
they've done it right, they've left themselves with a safe, wet area
where the flames won't get to them before the new stick is added.
Segment by segment, they advance up the hill, using every stick
they've carried. They top out at a logging road, where the canyon
dissipates in a talus field and granite outcrops.</TE>
<TE>   Fire has jumped into a pine above them, but a chain-saw crew makes
quick work of it, rolling the burning logs back down into the burned
areas. They've corralled it. It's taken about 40 minutes. ''You see?
You see?'' Taylor says. ''You see why we're hooked? That's what
cracks me up about this job. One minute you're practically asleep and
the next minute, you're giving it your all.''</TE>
<TE>   First light on Sept. 23 reveals a mushroom-topped smoke column
rising thousands of feet above the San Gabriel Mountains. Shana
Shuttleworth, Robert Menor, Josh Rundquist and David Roberts head
west on the 210 Freeway. Could this be the fire they've been dreaming
about? Roberts, who arrived only two weeks earlier, has never put
water on fire in a CDF uniform. Shuttleworth, a permanent firefighter
with eight years' experience, is getting her chance to be an engineer
and drive the rig for the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Shuttleworth dreamed of being a firefighter while growing up in
Lake Elsinore. Back then, the state was building the 215 Freeway, and
construction trucks lumbered by her home. Shuttleworth and her twin
sister would run to the edge of the yard, signaling to truckers to
yank their air horns. One day, she looked up and saw the driver was a
woman. ''I was blown away,'' Shuttleworth recalls, and she decided
she had to drive a truck. Her other childhood dream had been to talk
on the radio. ''Now I get to do both,'' she says and laughs.</TE>
<TE>   The suspicious fire that began near Camp Williams, on the east
fork of the San Gabriel River, has swelled to 800 acres overnight, a
time when fires usually cool down in Southern California. But not
this year. Nighttime fires burn like daytime, and daytime fires burn
like hell. Before it's over, the Williams Fire will consume 36,000
acres and draw more than 3,000 firefighters from as far as Montana's
Blackfoot Reservation and Virginia's Smoky Mountains. But the rookies
of Engine 3576 are about to find out about bad luck.</TE>
<TE>   At the Santa Fe Dam recreation area, the strike team gathers for a
safety run-down. Old-school veterans who've heard it before feign
attention, staring at the tips of their boots. Shuttleworth gathers
her team afterward. ''They think they know it all,'' she tells them.
''But I want you guys to really pay attention to it. One day you're
going to be alone up there without a supervisor and you need to know
what to do.'' Shuttleworth tells them to hook a 1 3/4-inch line to
the pumper and lay it atop the engine, in case flame overtakes them
on the way up to the fire's western flank on Glendora Mountain Road.
Rundquist, 19, is so nervous in the front seat, he keeps pressing his
foot against the horn button on the floor. Each time he does it,
Menor, Roberts and Shuttleworth laugh.</TE>
<TE>   As they head up State Highway 39, residents headed for work give
the firefighters the thumbs-up and honk horns, and they wave back
gamely. By the time most of the commuters reach their offices, the
strike team is arrayed along Glendora Mountain Road, where
Shuttleworth parks along an inside curve and prepares for battle. The
fire is above the road, ''backing down'' the hillside, moving slowly.
Embers roll down toward them, igniting spot-fires below the fireline
that quickly heat up the intervening underbrush, like a freshly
struck kitchen match. When the manzanita and chemise burst into
fireballs, the crew can feel the heat on their faces. They cast wary
glances back below them, looking for a telltale wisp of smoke--a
spot-fire on the slope below them.</TE>
<TE>   Rocks tumble loose and slam onto the road. Rats scurry
down, singed and dazed. It's common to see deer, coyotes, fox and even
bears run from a fire front. Firefighters' sympathy for their plight
is mitigated by their own sense of survival. Sometimes they're forced
to kill burning rats or rabbits to keep them from running into
unburned brush beyond the fire line, igniting a spot-fire that can
run up at them from behind.</TE>
<TE>   Shuttleworth keeps a watchful gaze, showing her crew which
sections will go off next, pointing out places where no firefighter
should ever stand. ''I love to watch it,'' she admits. ''When there's
quiet time to watch, it's a great opportunity to learn fire
behavior.''</TE>
<TE>   Her fascination with flame bloomed later than for most CDF
firefighters and after what she admits were a few wrong turns. One of
them was a Deadhead biker who fathered her first son, and whose legal
name she didn't know when the nurse asked her. When he left, she was
23, a single mom and unemployed. She returned to Lake Elsinore and
started dental hygienist classes at Mount San Jacinto Community
College in Menifee. Then a friend suggested she take an EMT course
and everything changed. ''I thought it'd be a good idea to take that
class, since I had a baby and it would be good to know First Aid,''
Shuttleworth said. ''It was full of firemen. Just listening to all
their stories and seeing the firefighters, I said, 'I have to be a
firefighter.' ''</TE>
<TE>   Shuttleworth signed up as a volunteer at the Lake Elsinore CDF
station in December 1993. Six months later she was a seasonal
firefighter, and went to her first fire on her first day at work. ''I
came to work, got on an engine and was gone 11 days,'' she said. ''I
found out I loved this job.'' While at Lake Elsinore she met Capt.
Dave Shuttleworth, a grizzled veteran who has been a mentor to dozens
of firefighters over nearly three decades. She fell in love, and they
were married two years later.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is what I want to do--wildland firefighting,'' Shuttleworth
says. ''I love this right here, being out here, being in the brush,
being in the dirt.'' She pauses to watch a manzanita bush explode
like paraffin.</TE>
<TE>   By noon, fire kicks up on Glendora Mountain Road, creeping under
the foliage, erupting in wider swaths, reducing the sun to a feeble
diode. The situation worsens when the U.S. Forest Service crews
launch flares into the hillsides to starve the approaching fire of
fuel. Vegetation erupts so quickly the crews shelter themselves from
the radiant heat by huddling behind the rig. But the only
firefighting for Engine 3576 comes when Shuttleworth tells Roberts to
put out an ember that's rolled across the road.</TE>
<TE>   Three hours later, their shift ends. When the warriors crest a
ridgeline heading back toward camp, they see what the rest of the
fire has been doing. Angry flames ripple from every ridgetop for
miles, and the ravines and canyons look like lava fields in the dusk.
Worse, flame is blowing over the road ahead, breaking the containment
line and racing westward. On the radio, voices crackle with
excitement. Finally, a fire they can attack. Battalion Chief Jack
Consol radios to camp, offering to keep his strike team on the fire
for another 12-hour shift. Some have been up since 2:30 a.m., driving
from fire stations as far away as Yucca Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Engine 3576 stops at a steep hillside where the flames are blowing
up over the road. They give Roberts the nozzle, and Rundquist and
Menor file behind him. Both Shuttleworth and Consol keep a close eye
on them, shouting directions as they disappear behind a shroud. When
flames reach a stand of scrub oak below them, Consol orders them to
stand back and let it burn out. The flames roar up, pressing a wave
of heat at them, then die out in short grass, momentarily out of
fuel. They advance again, dousing what remains. It is textbook
firefighting, with two instructors. But Consol gets the answer to his
offer. They're to stand down and return to camp--the night crew will
handle it.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone packs up, cursing the decision, savaging the U.S. Forest
Service. To veterans on the team, leaving a fire that's this active
is the most humiliating moment they've had in years.</TE>
<TE>   By morning, the blaze has grown to 8,005 acres, and hundreds of
homes have been evacuated along the foothills. Scores of city fire
engines have shown up to protect at least 1,000 structures threatened
by the flames. Wildland firefighters call these urban rigs ''pavement
queens,'' but they are the ones that will be on the news every night.
They console themselves with the prospect of overtime--Menor, for
example, will make $250 a day--that will come out of the hide of the
Forest Service because the fire is in a national forest. CDF, in
fact, will charge the Forest Service $11,000 a day for each strike
team.</TE>
<TE>   There are 10 air tankers, 17 helicopters and hundreds of fire
engines staffed by more than 3,000 people battling the fire. The
ad-hoc headquarters at Santa Fe Dam is swelling with everything from
kitchens to showers and a mechanics bay. Blue tents of Forest Service
crews dot the picnic areas. Hotshot crews play hackey-sack, with 10
pushups as punishment for the one who drops the bag. At the end of
the day, a group of women unload dogs--a standard poodle, a cocker
spaniel among them--and walk them around the camp. They're with Hope
Crisis Response, an ''animal-assisted emotional support group''
called in to soothe the stress of fighting fire. The only emotional
trauma Engine 3576 is feeling comes from not fighting fire.</TE>
<TE>   On day two, the strike team is assigned to the same area where
they sat and watched the day before: Division Z, on the fire's
northwest side, opposite the most active front of the fire, which is
creeping southeast into foothill communities. When Shuttleworth makes
the tight turn onto Glendora Mountain Road, she notices the steering
is unusually stiff. The strike team stops. They tilt the
International cab's hood forward and the other engineers try the
steering. The engineers tease Shuttleworth that she broke the engine,
and one of them suggests with a smile that she's too weak to turn the
wheel. She laughs it off, but it's a sensitive point: Shuttleworth
had to take the CDF physical three times before passing.</TE>
<TE>   She's also made three mistakes this season: She broke a taillight
backing into a dirt berm, left the parking brake loose and had a hose
slide off the truck while it was moving. She knows these things can
be chalked off to learning the ropes--or come back to haunt her.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighting, particularly forest fires, has been a macho domain
for decades. But while modern times have caught up, Shuttleworth
senses there are some who think she shouldn't be an engineer this
summer, and others who think she shouldn't be a firefighter at all.
''They look at my size, they hear my squeaky, Mickey Mouse voice and
I think some of them are embarrassed to take orders from me.''</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, the steering really is shot, and Consol doesn't
take any chances. A CDF engine lost a drive shaft near Cajon Junction
in August and careened 60 feet down a ravine, severely injuring three
firefighters. ''Out of service,'' Consol mutters. They drive gingerly
back to camp, crushed. ''We're just falling apart today,'' Menor
says. The rest of the team will stay around Follows Camp, a small
settlement on the east fork of the San Gabriel River that has the
feel of the fictional Cicely of TV's ''Northern Exposure.''</TE>
<TE>   Menor can't hide his envy: ''If we get fire, it would be way
cool.''</TE>
<TE>   Shuttleworth charms her way through the red tape of the
maintenance bay at camp. While a mechanic checks the power-steering
system, the crew grabs sack lunches and heads for a bench. Above
their heads, the fire header boils into a massive cumulus cloud
rising to well over 20,000 feet. It's a sign of unstable air and can
produce its own weather, including powerful downward blasts of air.
''If you're on a fire and that's above you, that's another watch-out
situation, because those downbursts will make the fire move in all
directions,'' Shuttleworth warns. ''Don't just look at the weather
because you want to know if it's a nice weekend or you have something
planned. Learn everything you can about weather, because weather
affects everything about fire. If this is what you want to do, then
you should get to understand weather.''</TE>
<TE>   By sundown, the fire has grown to 12,000 acres, and the mechanic
works his way through every element of the power steering: filter,
hose, pump. When he can't find the source of the problem, he
dispatches the engine to a shop in Montebello. At worst, he assures,
it will be back in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning, day three of the fire assignment, the engine
is not there. The only consolation comes from the rest of the strike
team. They did nothing at Follows Camp but wait for a fire that
didn't arrive. Shuttleworth borrows a rented double-cab Ford pickup
and takes the crew on errands. They pass Cafe Mundial restaurant in
Monrovia, where Roberts works Wednesday and Thursday nights as an
order expeditor. His third job is at a city-owned skateboard park.
He'll keep at least one for the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts grew up in Monrovia, where he used to light bonfires in a
lot next to his house. As a teenager, he and a friend who was a fire
Explorer Scout put out a fire in Grand Avenue Park, in the
flood-control basin. ''Ever since then, I wanted to be a
firefighter,'' he says. Last December, Roberts went through the
67-hour fire academy at San Bernardino CDF headquarters, then added
courses in the spring and summer. With the state on high alert and
the governor authorizing emergency hiring, he didn't have to wait
long. ''I put in my application and they called me up,'' he explains,
shrugging.</TE>
<TE>   The warriors wash their clothes at a laundromat, then buy 25 deli
combo sandwiches at Subway for the whole strike team, which has been
assigned to the Julius Klein Conservation Camp, a few miles from
Follows Camp. As they head up to deliver the lunches, they see what
they are about to miss: Fire is cresting over nearby ridges in sheets
of up to 100 feet and is about to run through the narrow gorge cut by
the east fork of the river. They could stay to fight it with the rest
of the strike team. But they've made a crucial error: Their gear is
on the rig, and the rig is in Montebello. They drop off the lunches
and leave.</TE>
<TE>   As they head toward camp, Shuttleworth and the others from Engine
3576 drive past the fire front, where flames arch over East Fork
Road. Shuttleworth finds a wide turnout and pulls over to watch. It's
a textbook safety zone--wide and bare enough to avoid the intense
heat of the flames--and a good moment to teach the concept to her
rookies from the safety of the truck. They park on the downhill side
and watch the flames run up toward them. When the flames come near,
they move to the opposite side. When that hillside ignites from the
heat below, they move back. They're all smiles when they get back to
camp. But smiles fade to scowls on day four. The engine is not in
camp.</TE>
<TE>   They pack into the pickup for another day, doing errands for five
hours. When they return to camp at 1 p.m., there's no sign of the
engine. ''This strike team assignment is officially starting to
stink,'' Rundquist announces. Still, the news isn't all bad. The
engine is fixed; it just needs to be picked up in Montebello. By 4:30
p.m. the warriors have completed the paperwork and are back in the
engine. By the time they get back to camp, it's too late to join the
strike team. But at least they have their engine. Judging by the
towering column of smoke, there still is plenty of fire for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   By the morning of day five, the mood is upbeat as the warriors
hear their new assignment: the Mount Baldy side of the fire. At last,
it seems, they might get to battle the flame front.</TE>
<TE>   They head out to a staging area at the San Antonio Dam. But it
turns out to be far southwest of the real fire, and they sit for
hours, waiting for orders. They play Gameboys, or scan through the
radio and fight for their favorite groups: Guns N' Roses, the Rolling
Stones, Led Zeppelin, Eminem, Nelly. One crew makes minor engine
repairs. Shuttleworth takes the rig for a tour of Mount Baldy Village
and returns. A courier brings up overtime checks at 5:15 p.m. There's
talk of a back-firing operation, but by the time it starts, the shift
is over.</TE>
<TE>   There's no fire, but there's always hope. It's what keeps them
coming back every year. It's what they train for. It's what they wait
for.</TE>
<TE>   The next day breaks their heart. The warriors awake to a steady
rain and thick fog, a scene so improbable in the statewide drought,
they're at a loss to process what's happened. An unusual low-pressure
system, kicked off by a storm in the Pacific, has moved in over the
Angeles National Forest. Word comes from Consol: the San Bernardino
strike team, and several others, are being released. They are to
report to camp to be demobilized. Within hours, they're headed back
to Yucaipa. This fire is over. As it turns out, so is the season.</TE>
<TE>   Through the fall, there are small brush blazes around Yucaipa's
foothills, and some accidents worthy of ''Emergency'' on I-10. But
that's about it.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts gets to crawl into one car and rescue a driver, but he's
laid off as of Nov. 11 and starts looking for a paid-call
firefighting job and weighing whether to return to his restaurant
job. Menor is laid off as well and will work as a paid-call
firefighter on the east side of Yucaipa. He also gets a volunteer job
on the search-and-rescue team of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's
Department.</TE>
<TE>   McCulley makes the November cut but is bracing for the next
round of layoffs. He'll take some time off, he says, and may return to
sales. Shuttleworth is sent back early to her station in Lake
Elsinore after supervisors find shortcomings in her driving. It's a
blow, but by mid-November, she's giving herself a pep talk. ''It is a
man's world, and in order to survive, you have to be strong,'' she
says. "I'm going to be the best driver this department ever had. I'll
walk in the door and say, 'Chief, let's go for a drive.' I'll be an
engineer one day. I'll be a captain one day and run my own station.'
''</TE>
<TE>   Williams is badly injured by a ''deck gun'' hose during training
and is out for three weeks. Chittenden says he is impressed by
Williams' leadership and expects him to make permanent captain soon.
''I could go down the list and say good things about all of them,''
he says of this season's crew. ''There's not a single one I wouldn't
love to have as a permanent firefighter.''</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, they'll train, stay in shape, work fall-back jobs
and fill in the time of waiting.</TE>

<HD>Eyes Wide Open for Johnny Cash</HD>

<LD>Officials at the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba Linda
were taken aback this year when Bill Miller of Corona offered his
enormous collection of Johnny Cash memorabilia for an exhibit. The
Elvis-Nixon connection has been well-publicized, but Johnny Cash,
too? "Johnny Cash performed for five U.S. presidents and had a
closed-door meeting with President Nixon regarding prison reform in
1974," says Arianna Barrios, director of communications for the
library, where the Johnny Cash 70th Birthday Tribute is displaying
gold records, guitars, photos, clothing and other items. "It's not
often someone comes to you with a ready-made show."</LD>
<LD>   Miller's affinity for country music's outlaw Man in Black started
in 1968, when Miller was 9 and a classmate brought the album "At
Folsom Prison" to show-and-tell. "The sound was something like I
never heard," Miller says. "I begged my parents to buy me the record.
They didn't know who Johnny Cash was. They liked Bing Crosby and
Wayne Newton."</LD>
<TE>   Miller grew up in Eagle Mountain, a former Kaiser Steel Co. town
of 3,700 (now a prison ), in the Mojave Desert. The album's salty
language concerned his parents but they drove him to Indio to buy it.
Miller replaced his monster posters with images of Cash and was soon
humming "I Walk the Line." Later the family moved to New Mexico, and
Miller, 15, persuaded his father to drive him five hours to Denver
for his first Cash concert in 1973. Cash tossed a harmonica to
Miller, who went backstage and met his idol along with manager Lou
Robin. During the next 26 years, Miller went to more than 100 Cash
shows and built a friendship with Robin and Cash that endures today.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's home and office overflow with a mountainous Cash
collection that exceeds 1,000 pieces, with some items on loan to the
Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas. The Nixon Library display includes two
guitars that Cash frequently played, including a six-string Guild
guitar that Cash gave Miller and autographed with the first four
lines of the hit song "I Walk the Line." Also on view are Cash's Air
Force uniform, stage wear from each decade of the singer's career,
his passports and other pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Cash stopped touring in 1998 and invited Miller to his home in
Hendersonville, Tenn. "It was a huge party with 400 people eating off
June's personal china," says Miller, a former Corona mayor. "He's a
great guy. He's a very private person. Most people who know him
aren't close to him. I know it sounds corny, but I feel blessed."</TE>
<TE>   Though he deals in star autographs today, Miller doesn't charge
anything to loan out his Cash memorabilia. "I've never charged a
penny. If it spent its life touring, I'd be happy. I'm building a
historical archive. This is all great stuff, but the memories are
worth more than anything in the collection."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A portion of Miller's collection is on display at the Richard
Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba Linda until Jan. 1. (714)
993-5075.</TE>

<DH>A Beachwood Canyon Garden Takes on New Life Blending
Forgotten Landscape Elements With Wild Plantings</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Heeger</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Landscape designer Sean Knibb likes to roam around and brood and kick
dirt as he creates a garden. But when he did this for client Sunny
Smith, his foot struck stone. It was a buried staircase Smith didn't
know she had, a funky flight of brick and concrete that, once Knibb's
crew had dug it out, suddenly opened up her Beachwood Canyon hill.</LD>
<LD>   ''Here was structure from the past, a usable landscape remnant,''
Knibb says. He quickly discovered other remnants, including part of a
concrete wall and scraps of railroad ties he knew he could work into
a new design. There were a few odd trees, too, such as a shaggy date
palm, a silver olive, even a rubber tree that might have started life
in a pot.</LD>
<LD>   Not only did this mix of old materials suit Smith's 1920s house,
but it introduced a garden theme: layering textures and tones to
bring a small, steep space alive.</LD>
<TE>   ''I wanted a garden I could use,'' says Smith, a project manager
for a landscape-design firm and mother of two young children who are
frequently outside. ''I asked for lawn, paths, eating and sitting
places, but nothing formal or terribly studied.''</TE>
<TE>   Knibb set out to re-create the feel of gardens from his childhood
in Jamaica. ''I didn't so much see specific plants as imagine a sense
of being enveloped in lush, contrasting greens with splashes of
orange here and there,'' he says.</TE>
<TE>   His design for stair-step terraces was inspired by Indonesia,
where landscapes follow natural contours of hills. ''The land bends,
you follow. You don't fight it,'' he explains. So instead of carving
out static tiers, he invoked a series of what he calls ''sliding
curves that seem to move as you go up.'' Strategically placed iron
fencing with sinuous rails boosts the effect, as do dynamic plants
such as grasses and artemisias mixed with starchier succulents and
hydrangeas. By repeating these plants, along with complementary
paving themes, Knibb connected the garden's parts. And he enlarged
its scope by constructing different ways to climb its hill.</TE>
<TE>   Each offers its own surprises. Choose those old, original stairs,
and you wade through artemisias to discover lettuce at the feet of a
statue of the Virgin Mary. Approach from the right, via flagstones
edged with thyme, and you find the outdoor dining room, complete with
a whitewashed fir table and billowing scrim of 'Iceberg' roses. More
flagstones lead between lavenders to a tucked-away bench, beyond
which are the main stairs and a view of ''the Crow's Nest,'' a pole
arbor smothered in vines at the property's summit. Up there, the big
Hollywood panorama, which could previously only be seen in glimpses,
unfolds.</TE>
<TE>   ''I sneak up for quick 20-minute rests,'' Smith says. Whenever
possible, she goes out to weed, prune and putter on her hill. ''My
last garden was about flowers. This one has a wilder spirit.''</TE>

<LD>The great novelists, Larry McMurtry believes, write their
masterpieces in the prime of life. And at 66, he figures he's past
his prime. The powers that inspired ''The Last Picture Show'' and
''Terms of Endearment'' are in decline. By his own reckoning, the
curtain fell on his great period 17 years ago, with the publication
of ''Lonesome Dove.''</LD>
<LD>   McMurtry remains stunningly prolific; he churned out four novels
during the past year, the last two at a gallop. But some time ago he
lost interest in reading fiction, preferring to spend his evenings
with European history and British diaries. He doesn't travel much
anymore, either. He stays put in windblown Archer City, Texas, where
he taps out books on a manual typewriter, tends a sprawling
secondhand bookstore, breakfasts at the local Dairy Queen, hosts
out-of-town friends on the weekends, complains about the dearth of
decent restaurants and, as one of those friends puts it, ''lives in
his own head.''</LD>
<TE>   Is Larry McMurtry, the premier Western novelist of our generation,
riding quietly into the sunset? ''I've been feeling a bit restless
lately,'' he says, a sure hand resting on the wheel of his dusty
Cadillac, odometer clicking past 104,000, as he stares into a pastel
Texas twilight. Passing by at the speed limit is the stark prairie
that inspired an adventure story about a couple of old-timers leading
a cattle drive in ''Lonesome Dove'' and a gloomy tale about
adolescents trapped in a small-town vise in "The Last Picture Show.''</TE>
<TE>   ''I might get a pied-a-terre somewhere--just to have better
food.'' He laughs. ''The real problem here is food. I've lived in
places where you just normally go out to eat. I work pretty hard, and
it's nice to go out and have a reasonable dinner. You'll see what the
prospects are tonight.'' He pauses while that sinks in. ''It's
grim.''</TE>
<TE>   McMurtry lives in a majestic three-story home a few doors down
from the single-story house where he grew up and not far from the
high school where he graduated in 1954 among a senior class of 19. He
moved back to Archer City, population 1,848, just five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   He keeps mostly to himself, and locals know better than to try to
engage him in chitchat. ''He's a very conservative-type feller,''
says Max Wood, the town's 68-year-old mayor. Wood has known McMurtry
since high school but doesn't consider himself a close friend.
''Larry was always the type of person who was more of a loner.''</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Archer City seems mostly indifferent to its literary son.
''They just let him be," says Sue Deen, one of McMurtry's two
sisters, who runs a local feed store that also sells her brother's
books. ''He's just part of who lives here. No one bothers him, which
is how he wants it. He likes his privacy.''</TE>
<TE>   Early success as a writer took McMurtry to Houston and later to
Washington, D.C., New York and Los Angeles, where he had a home in
Santa Monica and an apartment in Sherman Oaks. Then a heart bypass in
1991 drove him into a depression, from which he slowly recovered at
the home of a friend in Arizona. The decision to return to Texas,
perhaps for good, was made because of books--not the books he was
writing but the antiquarian book business he has nurtured on the side
for years.</TE>
<TE>   The repository for those titles is Booked Up, which McMurtry
refers to informally as ''booktown.'' At last estimate--no one counts
them and there's no database--about 500,000 volumes were squeezed
onto the shelves of four Booked Up stores, all within half a block of
the town's lone blinking red traffic light. Finding and tending those
books has become his all-consuming passion. He buys for the
burgeoning shelves, a pasture on which book dealers and book lovers
from around the world come to graze.</TE>
<TE>   But just how long can this urbane soul remain happily hunkered
down in small-town Texas? Is this the place where a famous Western
writer and intellectual wants to grows old?</TE>
<TE>   Since the publication of the diaries of Meriwether Lewis and
William Clark nearly two centuries ago, the West has been mined for
myth and adventure by many an American writer. Mark Twain and James
Fenimore Cooper were among the earliest to capture its wild and
brutal outlines. Larry Jeff McMurtry became the dominant voice in
Western literature soon after the publication of ''Horseman, Pass
By'' in 1961. That novel became the basis for the movie ''Hud,''
starring Paul Newman and featuring Oscar-winning performances from
Patricia Neal and Melvyn Douglas.</TE>
<TE>   ''If anybody had any sense,'' says the writer Carolyn See, a
professor of English at UCLA, ''they'd throw out 'Moby Dick' and put
'Lonesome Dove' in the center as the great American epic novel. No
question about it. His heroes in that book are just terrific. His
women are just terrific. And he sustains it for 800 pages.''</TE>
<TE>   Her UCLA colleague Blake Allmendinger, a specialist in Western
literature, says ''Lonesome Dove,'' which won the Pulitzer Prize for
fiction in 1986, ''is the only long novel I've taught in my whole
career that students were happy to read.''</TE>
<TE>   The literary landscape of the West today is much richer and more
eclectic than when McMurtry began his career. Many of today's gifted
Western authors are chroniclers of discrete interest, writing about
the experience of Native Americans, Chicanos, Asians and other
communities in the West. Others have tapped into the au courant vein
of environmental literature. But only a few, such as Cormac McCarthy
("All the Pretty Horses''), Thomas McGuane ("Nothing But Blue
Skies'') and Annie Proulx (''Close Range: Wyoming Stories''), have
taken on the grand Western ethos. And none has been able to match
McMurtry's ability to bring the West to large, popular--as well as
literary--audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Gordon, the literary editor of Boston Review, writing
admiringly of McMurtry's latest book, ''Sin Killer,'' in the New York
Times Book Review, said McMurtry ''is a resident of that
uncomfortable territory of American letters that lies between the
popular and the literary.'' His cross-genre oeuvre includes classic,
emotionally rich contemporary Westerns as well as ruminative works of
nonfiction and scholarly essays in the New York Review of Books. Also
sprinkled among his more than 30 books, though, are readable but
disappointing sequels that have a cranked-out feel.</TE>
<TE>   McMurtry has always been something of a contradiction. He was born
a few miles from Archer City on a cattle ranch, the son and grandson
of ranchers. But, unlike a great many Texas writers, he doesn't
romanticize the West. In fact, he sometimes seems repulsed by it.
(''I love the plains but I hate cows and horses," he says. "And I
regard ranching as a form of slavery.")</TE>
<TE>   ''It's that strong attraction-repulsion that characterizes most of
his work,'' says Mark Busby, professor of English at Southwest Texas
State University who has closely studied McMurtry's work for years.
''That stems from being an intellectual in Texas in the '60s, a
bookless man in a bookless state.'' That bookless state has changed a
good bit since the '60s, and McMurtry is one of the reasons. ''Larry
McMurtry will no longer sign books in this store--nor books sent
through the mail. Forty years of constant signing has had a bad
effect on both his signature and his disposition. Read to enjoy.
Those unable to do without a talismanic scrawl may try Three Dog
Books.''--Handwritten sign posted in Booked Up Store No. 1. Signed by
Larry McMurtry.</TE>
<TE>   His day usually begins at 6:50 a.m. with 10 minutes on the
treadmill in his basement gym. That tuneup is his only nod to cardiac
health. ''That's all I can tolerate,'' he says. ''I'm on that
treadmill from 6:50 until 7. Bored, even at that hour.'' He lives on
the sunset side of Archer City, in what he amusingly calls the
silk-stocking district. His house is one of the town's largest, a tan
brick structure with a large shaded front porch and surrounded by
mature mulberry, poplar and ash trees. It rests between the clubhouse
and the ninth green of Archer City's private golf course (though
McMurtry isn't a member).</TE>
<TE>   For years the house was owned by a wealthy widower whose only son
had been killed in an oilfield accident. When he was a youngster,
McMurtry remembers, a light would burn in a second-floor room of the
house until late at night, and he always assumed the owner was
reading--a rare kindred spirit in love with books in 1950s Texas.
McMurtry never learned if the man really was a reader, but in 1988,
when the owner died, McMurtry bought the house.</TE>
<TE>   Inside is McMurtry's personal collection of 25,000 books, arranged
by subject--Russia, English politics and so on--on shelves that rise
14 feet from the oak floor to the ceiling. The movie and Western
collections line the walls of a small guesthouse, a few steps from
the back door. ''I have all the books I might need right here,'' he
says. ''I don't like libraries.''</TE>
<TE>   At 7:30 a.m. each day, he settles into a chair at one end of a
25-foot oak table, one of three he acquired a few years back from the
Hollywood public library. With a fan turning slowly on the ceiling
and the morning light gleaming through a large window behind him, he
pecks away for 90 minutes on a manual Hermes 3000 typewriter. His
steady pace: 10 pages a day for a first draft; 20 for a revision.
''As I get older, I get faster,'' he says. ''Partly it's just
fluency. To me, writing fiction is always about momentum. Momentum is
more important than finesse. Finesse is what you do on the second or
third draft. Getting the story out is what you've got to do first.''</TE>
<TE>   He's just finished the fourth and last book of his Berrybender
tetralogy. The first of that series, ''Sin Killer,'' released in May
to mixed reviews, introduced the Berrybender clan, a wealthy English
family exploring the West in 1832 by boat up the Missouri River. The
second part is due out in early May. McMurtry originally had wanted
to write a nonfiction book about the river, the superhighway into the
West in the early 19th century. ''But I couldn't get a boat to
explore it. It was too bureaucratized, with all those dams and locks
and stuff. So I turned all that into a novel.''</TE>
<TE>   Now he's writing a book of nonfiction about six notable massacres
of the West, which occurred in the mid- to late-1800s in California,
Utah, Arizona, Kansas, Montana and South Dakota. In recent months, he
has penned essays for the New York Review of Books on the diaries of
James Lees-Milne and the work of novelist Thomas McGuane. And he's
also finishing several teleplays and screenplays based on his work
and that of others.</TE>
<TE>   McMurtry has never been a slow writer. It takes him just three
months, about 120 hours of writing, to finish a book. Some critics
complain that he's too prolific, that his books would benefit from
another couple of turns through the Hermes. But McMurtry doesn't read
those, or any other, reviews. And he takes a dim view of writing
revisions, feeling that too many revisions ruined ''Horseman, Pass
By.''</TE>
<TE>   Still, he's his own harshest critic, and after four decades in the
business, he believes his powers as a fiction writer are in decline.
''Fiction is tricky,'' he says. ''It depends on a very complicated
ability both to focus emotion and imagination. Constructing a long
novel is a really demanding business. I don't think there have been
many novelists whose best work has been written after they were 60.
This is my own theory, but if you look at the great novelists, they
write competently over a long lifetime, but their masterpieces tend
to fall within a short period.''</TE>
<TE>   McMurtry's rich period, in his view, was from ''All My Friends Are
Going to be Strangers,'' published in 1972 when he was 36, through
''Lonesome Dove,'' which appeared in 1985 when he was 49. (''Lonesome
Dove'' was later adapted as an Emmy Award-winning miniseries starring
Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones.) That period included the books
''Terms of Endearment'' and ''Desert Rose.''</TE>
<TE>   After 90 minutes at the typewriter, he usually drives downtown and
opens a couple of his stores for the early-bird shoppers. Then he
heads to the edge of town and the local Dairy Queen, which he
featured in ''Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen,'' a collection of
semi-autobiographical essays that had McMurtry hanging out at the DQ,
reading the German philosopher Benjamin and guzzling lime Dr Peppers.
(And you thought there was nothing to do in Archer City.)</TE>
<TE>   Most mornings he orders biscuits with gravy or jam and reads the
Wichita Falls Times Record News, the Wall Street Journal, the
Financial Times and the New York Times. While he's eating, the three
women who run Booked Up arrive for work at Store No. 1, a former Ford
dealership. McMurtry turns up there by midmorning and waits for his
scouts, who haul in books they've collected, mostly from remainder
warehouses in Austin and Dallas. He pays them $3 a book plus gas
money, and then he prices the books, by hand with a pencil, at $15
and up. He also buys books from friends who have surplus stock and
impeccable taste, such as independent bookseller Ian Jackson in
Berkeley. And he occasionally travels to look over private
collections; a few months ago, he hauled back a treasure trove of
Caribbean literature from Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   ''If I'm not buying, it's immediately noticeable,'' he says. ''If
I haven't bought anything in three weeks, I feel very thinned out.
Very thinned out.'' Booked Up doesn't have a computer, but McMurtry
trolls through the invoices daily. "I pretty much know what we've got
and what we don't have," he says. A busy weekend may bring several
hundred customers, including professional book collectors but also
book lovers. McMurtry's theory is that people will travel, even to a
place as remote as Archer City, two hours drive northwest of  Dallas,
if there are enough books and, especially, enough good ones. ''The
challenge is not to get a million or 2 million books,'' he says.
''It's to keep the stock junk-free. And that's my job. Junk control.
Buying is the equivalent of breathing in the secondhand book
business.''</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth White, who works at the Texas Medical Center Library in
Houston, was one of a dozen customers on a recent Monday. She was on
a busman's holiday, staying at the Lonesome Dove Inn, a
bed-and-breakfast run by McMurtry's friend, Mary Webb. White spent
two days collecting medical books but also left with two armloads of
books on cooking, her hobby.</TE>
<TE>   Dealers are generally given the run of the four stores, sometimes
working through the night to collect boxfuls of books. The owner of a
new store on Madison Avenue turned up recently, spent the night in
Booked Up and spent $6,000 in 24 hours. Many of McMurtry's customers
are longtime friends in the book business, such as Lou Weinstein,
co-owner of Heritage Book Shop on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, who
comes about once a year. ''He has a perfect instinct for the right
books and the right people,'' McMurtry says. ''He knows exactly what
he wants and the condition it has to be in. He is one of the best
high-spotters in the world. He always has the high spots in any
genre.''</TE>
<TE>   What McMurtry doesn't sell is copies of his own books. ''It's an
endless nightmare selling my books,'' he says, ''because I'm
constantly pestered by people who want me to sign them, want me to
talk about them or something.'' McMurtry's books can be purchased at
only two places in town. One is Stirrup Feed, where McMurtry's sister
also sells coffee, wind chimes, Texas knickknacks and "equine
products and accessories," according to the sign out front. The other
place is Three Dog Books, which is run by Julie and Cody Ressell.
Julie worked at Booked Up for a few years until McMurtry set her and
her husband up with their own store as a wedding present.</TE>
<TE>   McMurtry's relationship with the town has had its ups and downs.
''The Last Picture Show,'' which rendered adolescent alienation
against the black-and-white backdrop of a small Texas town in the
1950s, turned a spotlight on Archer City, but not the kind that a
Chamber of Commerce might like. The anti-McMurtry talk grew so heated
that, at one point, he wrote a letter to the local paper, challenging
anyone to debate him at the legion hall. There were no takers. Later,
the characters from ''The Last Picture Show'' turned up in a sequel,
''Texasville,'' all silly and rich from the oil boom of the 1970s.
But when Hollywood decided to shoot the movie on location in Archer
City, massaging the town with movie stars such as Jeff Bridges,
Cloris Leachman and Cybill Shepherd, and with money and goodwill, all
was forgiven.</TE>
<TE>   ''I think the town feels ambivalent about me,'' McMurtry says,
sitting on a sorting table in Booked Up No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   He has a full head of hair that is gray-turning-to-silver and
old-fashioned glasses. He wears a perpetual frown, but it hides a
refreshing directness and a wry sense of humor. ''I'm not the
most-loved citizen, that's for sure,'' he continues. ''I bring a lot
of strangers to town. And I don't think people are crazy about these
bookstores. Of course, if they weren't here, there would be nothing
here--just boarded-up, empty, desolate-looking buildings--and it
would look more like a dead town than it does now. I think people
recognize that. But they'd rather have the five-and-dime and the
hardware store back.''</TE>
<TE>   (''We feel fortunate that at least we have Larry in those
buildings,'' Mayor Wood tells me later. ''Small cities like us take
whatever business we can get.'')</TE>
<TE>   The Ressells, Julie and Cody, themselves relative newcomers to
town, say McMurtry's reserve keeps him at a distance from most of
Archer City. ''People around here spend hours and hours shooting the
bull,'' says Cody, a bearded sometime musician. ''Larry doesn't hang
out and shoot the bull.'' Adds Julie: ''Some people also think his
books are dirty. I hear that a lot.''</TE>
<TE>   One of his best friends in town is Webb, proprietor of the
Lonesome Dove Inn and a sister of one of McMurtry's high school
classmates. I ask Webb if McMurtry was popular in high school. ''Oh,
he was as popular as you can be in Archer City without playing
football,'' she says. ''But we knew he was special. He got straight
As and won literary prizes.''</TE>
<TE>   After lunch, he'll take a nap, run errands and spend a little more
time at the bookshop. At night, he rarely goes out, preferring to
munch on salami and crackers and settle into his soft white sofa to
read. At the moment, he's working through a biography of Nazi
minister Albert Speer and the memoir of novelist Jim Harrison while
also exploring the nine-volume diaries of Lees-Milne, a socially
well-connected architectural historian who wrote from before World
War II until his death in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   What McMurtry doesn't read anymore is fiction, despite having
reviewed hundreds of novels earlier in his career for various
publications. ''Won't read it at all,'' he says. "I've read like a
thousand novels, but I don't want to read fiction anymore. If I do,
it's always 19th or 20th century fiction. George Eliot. Tolstoy,
Balzac. I can't read contemporary fiction.''</TE>
<TE>   And why not? "Just not interested,'' he says, shrugging his
shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   We arrive at Mcbride's restaurant on the outskirts of Wichita
Falls in the gathering dusk. The restaurant has a 1970s feel, with
low tile ceilings and dark wood paneling and a wicker basket of
plastic-wrapped crackers and melba toast on each table. This evening
it hums with friendly voices, crying babies and the clink of glasses.
McMurtry is wearing his daily work outfit--a faded blue long-sleeve
shirt over a polo shirt, worn blue jeans and blue New Balance jogging
shoes.</TE>
<TE>   He is good company, spinning stories about his life and his
Hollywood friends. (''I just talked to Diane [Keaton] yesterday,'' he
says at one point. ''She's just bought Peter's [Bogdanovich's] old
house.'')</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many serious writers, McMurtry has moved easily among the
worlds of literature, movies and television. He was the first non-New
Yorker to serve as president of the literary organization PEN and
spent several years as a university lecturer. But he also has written
70 screenplays and teleplays, including ''The Last Picture Show,''
which he co-wrote with Bogdanovich and which won screenwriting honors
from the New York Film Critics Circle and the British Academy of Film
and Television Arts.</TE>
<TE>   ''I don't see why writers complain about Hollywood,'' he says.
''The process has never been frustrating for me. I take a mature
view: It costs me two typewriter ribbons and maybe $1,000 to write a
book. Movies are a big business. If you try to pretend it's high art,
you'll be disappointed.'' He was trying to explain that recently to
Annie Proulx; McMurtry and his friend Diana Ossana have written a
screenplay based on Proulx's New Yorker short story ''Brokeback
Mountain.'' ''What I had to tell her was that no matter how much she
theorizes it, no matter how good it looks on paper, you never know
what's going to happen until you get the real actors and it starts
shooting. And then it may be glory or it may be junk. Hollywood is
what it is--an uncontrollable process which only great geniuses, like
Hitchcock and a few others, can control a certain portion of by
relentless ruthlessness. Most people can't control it.''</TE>
<TE>   McMurtry and Ossana wrote the four-hour miniseries ''Johnson
County War,'' starring Tom Berenger and Burt Reynolds, which aired as
a Hallmark Channel special last year. He's peddling a couple of movie
projects, including Proulx's story and two others, co-written with
Ossana and based on his books ''Anything for Billy'' and ''Boone's
Lick.'' He's also shopping a script for "White Boy," a true story
about the only white player in the old Negro baseball league who
happens to be mayor of a neighboring Texas town.</TE>
<TE>   McMurtry orders a Cutty Sark and water, a salad and the catfish.
He's fully recovered physically from his quadruple bypass surgery 10
years ago. He has no dietary restrictions, and a recent cardiac
checkup found him in perfect health. But the bypass, which followed a
mild heart attack, left a permanent psychological scar. ''It was a
breaking point in my life,'' he says. ''A watershed. I'm a different
person. It was the most interesting experience of my life and the
most ambiguous. Very transformative.''</TE>
<TE>   The first two months of recovery had gone well, and McMurtry
plowed happily through five volumes of Virginia Woolf's diaries and
12 volumes of Proust. But when he attempted to return to his former
life--running the bookshops, traveling and writing--he pulled up
lame. He lost interest in reading newspapers, which had been a
constant in his life. He still wrote fiction, but it felt, he has
said, "like faxes I received each day from my former self." What he
couldn't do at all was read for pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   He stayed with Ossana in Tucson, found a good therapist and slowly
inched back from the abyss. It took more than two years for him to
rediscover the pleasure of reading and another year before he
recovered his interest in the rare-book trade.</TE>
<TE>   ''Now,'' he says, ''I feel like I'm as much myself as I'm likely
to ever be again. Maybe 75% or 80% of my former self.''</TE>
<TE>   Have there been any positive side effects? ''Well, women think
so,'' he says, chuckling. ''I think I'm less Type A. I was definitely
humbled by that experience. But everyone is. What could be more
humbling than to die for five hours and then be jump-started back to
life like a dead car?''</TE>
<TE>   Before his surgery, Ossana says, McMurtry was ''like a shark. He
only moved forward, never looked back. Everything was about right now
or the future. The surgery stopped him in his tracks. He became very
ruminative and quiet. Now I think Larry has looked about as inward as
he wants to look.''</TE>
<TE>   Divorced since 1966, McMurtry maintains close friendships with a
number of women. He talks daily by phone with his screenwriting
partner Ossana, who has a room of her own in his Archer City house.
''Larry is more of a connoisseur of women,'' Ossana says. ''He adores
them and finds them fascinating. He's bored with men. His magic with
women is that he's able to maintain friendships with them.''</TE>
<TE>   On that topic, McMurtry says only: ''I have no girlfriend,
although I am a great admirer of Nigella Lawson,'' the best-selling
British cookbook author and sultry TV show host. ''I just went out
and bought all of her books today.''</TE>
<TE>   When McMurtry moved back to Archer City, he planned to write
several nonfiction books while surrounded by his library for
reference. But another force driving his decision to return was the
deep current of change in the secondhand book trade. His passion for
the book business runs deep, rooted in his bookless childhood. He was
always a voracious reader, of course. But, by nature, he's also a
treasure hunter. In the antiquarian book world, a good scout need not
be able to quote Proust. But he needs to know the misprints and
misspellings that separate a merely old book from a priceless find.</TE>
<TE>   As he contemplated a move back to Texas, an explosion of book
fairs across the country had largely supplanted secondhand bookshops,
even some of the country's most famous family-run ones. The Booked Up
store that McMurtry and his business partner Marcia Carter had
started in 1970 in Washington, D.C., was becoming a victim, like so
many other urban bookstores, of declining sales and rising rents. And
McMurtry concluded that if he were ever going to have a profitable,
large bookstore, it would have to be in Archer City, where real
estate is relatively cheap and ''we can sell books, lickety-split.''</TE>
<TE>   If McMurtry's life is unexciting in Archer City, it is
comfortable. He's within driving distance of Austin, where his son,
James, a singer-songwriter, and his 12-year-old grandson, Curtis,
live. James' first rock album was produced by John Mellencamp, who
had heard some of his music when McMurtry wrote the screenplay for
"Falling From Grace," Mellencamp's feature film debut. James, who has
just finished his sixth album, doesn't have any interest in the
bookstores. But McMurtry is hoping that his grandson will.</TE>
<TE>   Already, McMurtry sees a collector's touch in young Curtis. ''He
has great book sense and he's a completist collector,'' McMurtry says
with pride. ''If he collects anything, he wants it all. He wants
every video of the [Mary-Kate and Ashley] Olsen twins. And he studies
the differing configurations of the goggles of various superheros.
He's got the touch.''</TE>
<TE>   But whether Curtis will share his grandfather's passion for the
book trade remains to be seen. ''It's almost unknown for a great
American bookshop to survive its creator,'' McMurtry says. ''And I
don't think I want my grandson to live in Archer City all his life
just to run his grandfather's bookshops.'' He laughs. ''But he might
pack away the best 20,000 books in the library if he wants to have a
bookshop in San Francisco. Or if he doesn't, he doesn't. He can sell
it.''</TE>
<TE>   McMurtry admits he's only half-serious about being restless. He's
intellectually restless, but ''it's a question of being trapped in
one's own creation,'' he says. ''Many, many people are. I really love
my booktown. I think it's a very worthwhile thing to do. And if you
believe that--and I do believe that--you've just got to do it.''</TE>
<TE>   He grows weary of the social narrowness of a small town, however.
''I don't get tired of the expansive nature of the bookshops, and the
people they bring here, including a lot of dealers I have known for
decades,'' he says. ''I don't get tired of the book trade, just of
Archer City. But right now, I'm kind of trapped.''</TE>
<TE>   And still scanning the treeless horizon for a decent meal.</TE>

<HD>Landmark Indecision</HD>
<DH>In Beverly Hills, a Vulnerable Gem Stirs the Preservation
Instinct</DH>

<LD>When it comes to architectural gems, diamonds should be forever. But
that isn't always the case in Southern California, where the past two
years have seen the demolitions of a 1963 Richard Neutra home in
Rancho Mirage, a 1924 Rudolph Schindler residence in Pasadena and a
1931 Schindler house in Avalon, on Catalina Island.</LD>
<LD>   In Beverly Hills these days, preservationists have their fingers
crossed for another unprotected treasure box, the fantastical old MCA
complex (now North Crescent Plaza), at Little Santa Monica Boulevard
and North Crescent Drive. The site's fan base went on alert in
September when the property was listed for sale or lease after
telecommunications company Global Crossing filed for bankruptcy;
company founder Gary Winnick was a principal in the partnership that
owned the building. Mitchell Dawson says he headed to Beverly Hills
City Hall to verify that no demolition permits were in the works. "I
just wanted to make sure," says the vice chairman of the Beverly
Hills Planning Commission. Something about the 2 1/2-acre
complex--with its porches, gabled roofs, antique iron gates, plaza
courtyard, fountain, reflecting pool and columns--inspires fierce
affection in architecture lovers. That group would include its
creator, architect Paul Revere Williams, the first African American
Fellow of the American Institute of Architects.</LD>
<TE>   In the days before his death in 1980, Williams called the complex
his favorite commercial project--no small praise from a brilliant
stylist who designed, redesigned or partnered on thousands of
Southern California buildings, including landmarks such as the
Beverly Hills Hotel and Los Angeles International Airport's atomic
boomerang-style Theme Building (now the Encounter restaurant). "My
grandfather used to say it [the MCA complex] was 'a fine piece of
work,' " says granddaughter Karen E. Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   The project began in 1936 with a commission from moguls Lew
Wasserman and Julius Stein at the Music Corporation of America.
Williams gave MCA a home in the grand manner with a Colonial revival
building done in a style dubbed "neo-Georgian." To Christopher A.
Pine, a senior planner for Beverly Hills, the work epitomizes
Hollywood during the '30s. "Williams wanted to create a statement. It
bears strong resemblance to studios in Culver City." MCA acquired
Universal Pictures in 1962, and the building was sold to Litton
Industries, which added a second building during the early 1960s,
also designed by Williams. "It looks like the whole was done at the
same time," says Hudson. "It was a stroke of genius. I think it was
kind of fun for him."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998 Litton sold the property to the partnership of which
Winnick was a principal. (Winnick also owned a Paul Williams-designed
Bel-Air home, which he razed in 2000.) The curving front driveway of
the MCA complex and its oval-shaped office have inspired some to call
it "The White House." "It's my grandfather's most classic example of
using residential design in a commercial building," says Hudson, who
marvels that the building has had only three owners.</TE>
<TE>   That situation is bound to change, and landmark lovers are
fretting over the toothless quality of preservation in Beverly Hills.
The city has a preservation ordinance, but the measure is ineffectual
because Beverly Hills has never secured certification to act under
California historic preservation laws (derived from National Park
Service guidelines). "It's never been applied in 27 years," Pine
says.</TE>
<TE>   The alternative route of listing in the National Register of
Historic Places offers a measure of protection, but must be initiated
by a building's owner or other person with knowledge of its
historical significance, Pine says. "If the new owner wants to
investigate and document it, it could be listed," he says. "Who it
was built for and built by, it's like a bull's-eye." Hudson, who has
authored two books on her grandfather, is holding her breath. "I
would hope whoever bought the building bought it for what it was."</TE>

<LD>To observers, the landscape surrounding the Southern California
Institute of Architecture downtown is an urban wasteland as devoid of
life as the dirt lot on which SCI-Arc sits near 4th and Merrick
streets. But like a production of "Blade Runner" in reverse, a team
of artists is using the technology of the future in a show that
resurrects the phantom streets of a vanished Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   In "34 North 118 West" (the title refers to L.A.'s latitudinal and
longitudinal coordinates), Jeremy Hight, Jeff Knowlton and Naomi
Spellman offer visitors a historic walking tour using the satellite
technology now installed in some cars to provide map coordinates,
directions and estimated arrival times.</LD>
<LD>   Arriving at SCI-Arc, sonic archeologists are given tablet PCs and
headphones linked to a Global Positioning System and set loose in a
four-block area around the institute. Each touch-screen PC is loaded
with a detailed map of the area created by the Sanborn Insurance Co.
in 1906. The maps, showing long-gone landmarks such as the
Anheuser-Busch bottling plant and the C. Ganahl Lumber Co., are
linked to a GPS satellite and dotted with pink onscreen "hot spots."
As visitors move about the neighborhood, arrival at a "hot spot"
triggers an audio voice-over of dramatized history and anecdotes
culled by the artists from old newspapers, personal reminiscences and
letters from the past 100 years.</LD>
<TE>   Near the SCI-Arc building, in a former freight station, a
steam-powered locomotive is heard over the headphones. On 3rd Street,
a rail worker describes his job stopping would-be suicides from
committing "death by train." Another "hot spot" launches a local
legend about a bagpiper who used to play near the old La Grande
passenger train station at 2nd Street and Santa Fe Avenue. (The piper
got drunk, passed out on the tracks and awoke when a train ran over
his hand.)</TE>
<TE>   The artists, CalArts graduates specializing in multimedia
projects, were inspired by the thought of more visionary uses for GPS
and hand-held positioning systems. "These are the vulgar histories
that don't get recorded in the textbooks," Knowlton says. "As this
space gets reconfigured with new buildings, we're able to pick up the
past's echoes and bring it to life in the present."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Time travelers can excavate downtown history from 1 to 4 p.m.
weekends through Dec. 22 at the Southern California Institute of
Architecture, 350 Merrick St., Los Angeles. www.34n118w.net.</TE>

<HD>A Vacuum Store Sucks Up the Camera's Glare</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There are easily a couple dozen vacuum stores in the South Bay. But
it's probably safe to call All Makes Vac &amp; Sew in Torrance the only
one with an international cult following. "For a little
hole-in-the-wall vacuum cleaner shop, it's a very strange thing,"
says owner Carl Tice.</LD>
<LD>   In 1996, Tice, a self-confessed computer geek, installed a Web cam
in the shop. Two more soon followed. The next year, Tice instituted
the wave. Wherever you may be on the globe, entering an instant
message in a dialogue box on the All Makes Vac &amp; Sew Web site when
the cameras are running gets you a friendly salute on the site from
Tice himself, usually holding a wipe board festooned with a smiley
face, your name and such (printable) message as you may request.</LD>
<LD>   During business hours, visitors can monitor live feeds of such
vistas as a vacuum display, Tice working at his computer or a
customer lugging in a broken Hoover. Messages prompt a beep from the
computer at Tice's desk in the middle of the shop. If he's not with a
customer, it's "action" for your personal vacuum store buddy.</LD>
<TE>   Some discover the site while trolling cyberspace for Web cams, the
Internet equivalent of reality TV. Others stumble onto the scene
while browsing for a new vacuum. Tice has had queries from England,
Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Some ask about the weather, others
about the time. "Just last week I had a guy from Paris," says Tice.
"It went on for about 15 or 20 minutes. Some people have way too much
time on their hands, but I'm happy to entertain." There are
occasional "inappropriate requests or comments," some focused on hot
female customers spotted on camera. There was also a crack about
Tice's "big belly" (attributable, surely, to those 10 pounds added by
the camera).</TE>
<TE>   Tice has few worries about being upstaged. "I think it's pretty
goofy," says Jim Sander, Vac &amp; Sew's sole employee. Sander hasn't
waved a single time. "Honestly," he says, "I've never been tempted."</TE>

<HD>Velvet Goes Underground</HD>
<DH>Tijuana Was the Florence of a Peculiar Art Renaissance. But
These Days in This Radically Changed City, It's Tough to Find a
Decent 'Velvis.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Quinones</AU>
<BD>Sam Quinones is the author of "True Tales From Another
Mexico: The Lynch Mob, the Popsicle Kings, Chalino and the Bronx"
(University of New Mexico Press). His last story for the magazine was
on the band Los Tigres del Norte.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day in 1968, when twins Juan and Abel Velazquez were 15 years
old, their father, Jose, sat them down and placed before them
canvases of black velvet. Jose had grown up on the hard streets of
Mexico City, where he'd been a boxer for a time. Later he taught
himself cartooning and then to paint on velvet, which is how he'd
been supporting his family.</LD>
<LD>   "Time for playing is over," he told his sons. "It's time to make
money."</LD>
<LD>   He took up a brush, dabbed it in pink paint and taught his sons
the craft he knew best. Starting with a simple classic image of
Tijuana velvet painting--the Pink Panther--he taught them to paint on
the soft, rich fabric. When their attention or brush strokes strayed,
he grabbed his sons by the hair and shook them. "We just wanted to go
out and play," recalls Abel.</LD>
<TE>   For the next two years, the boys learned the secrets of velvet
painting. Brushes had to be nearly dry, their father told them. Laden
with too much paint, they would cause caking. Painting back and forth
across velvet muddies the fabric's sheen, so paint only in one
direction. Paint what sells. Be literal. Tourists don't buy velvet
impressionism.</TE>
<TE>   Other velvet icons followed: Snoopy, Charlie Brown, the Playboy
Bunny. They learned to paint a prowling tiger and John Wayne,
bullfighters and unicorns, black lovers and white lovers. The
Velazquez twins became known among Tijuana's painters as "The
Photographers," since what they painted invariably looked so much
like the real thing.</TE>
<TE>   Juan and Abel Velazquez were not the first velvet painters in
Tijuana, but they are now, at age 51, almost the last. Like
bleary-eyed boxers who've fought too many rounds, they still lug
their velvet paintings around the city, trying to sell them to
tourists but seldom with much luck. After decades of defining
Tijuana, velvet painting is disappearing.</TE>
<TE>   The art supply store that once sold 200 hundred-yard rolls of
velvet a month now barely sells two. Many painters have died, moved
away or turned to other professions. Only a handful are still known
to paint velvet, and none of them are young. Even the tradition of
committing Elvis to velvet--the fabled "Velvis"--marches steadily to
extinction. In the entire city of Tijuana, more than 1 million
strong, only a few still regularly brush the King's fleshy cheeks and
pillowy lips onto velvet.</TE>
<TE>   One of these artists is Enrique Felix, who abandoned velvet for
many years but recently returned to it as a hobby. "My children now
are in their 20s," says Felix, who sells his paintings at his curio
shop near the tourist drag of Avenida Revolucion. "I don't want them
to do this. This is a good way to die of hunger. When we die, no one
will know the technique. It'll be forgotten and disappear."</TE>
<TE>   Tijuana is proud to be an industrial city now, a pit stop in the
global economy where more than 600 foreign-owned maquiladoras, or
assembly plants, employ more than 100,000 people. Tijuana workers
manufacture more televisions than are produced in any other city in
the world.</TE>
<TE>   Yet few events signal that change as clearly as the decline of
velvet painting, the art that was Tijuana's hallmark for so long.
From the late 1960s to the mid-'80s, the city's tourist shops were
virtually wallpapered in velvet portraits of JFK, clowns, unicorns,
crouching tigers, bandits and Jim Morrison. The city of Juarez went
even further, with factories of velvet painters turning out scads of
the stuff. Tijuana had street corridors where teenagers could watch
and learn from the more experienced velvet artists. Artists today
recall that cops, construction workers--some even say doctors--became
velvet painters.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, these were the days of lava lamps, black
lights and water beds in vans. If the 1970s were the most
embarrassing years of the 20th century, then Tijuana was its
Florence. Even the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which
ruled Mexico for 71 years, ingeniously drew political capital from
velvet painting.</TE>
<TE>   The father of modern velvet painting was a debauched drunkard
named Edgar Leeteg, an American billboard painter who moved to Tahiti
and was immortalized in the book "Rascals in Paradise" by James
Michener and A. Grove Day. Leeteg would paint all week, then drink
and fornicate on Tuesdays, when his money and whiskey would arrive by
boat. He died during a drunken spree in 1953, leaving behind many
Tahitian children and hundreds of velvet paintings hanging in
Hawaiian bars, restaurants and brothels.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear how the art form migrated to Mexico from the South
Seas. One theory holds that U.S. sailors who had seen Leeteg's work
in Hawaii brought their enthusiasm for it back to their home base in
San Diego. When on leave in Tijuana, they asked the street painters
there if they could duplicate Leeteg's style. Whatever the
explanation, velvet painting clearly took hold in Tijuana in the late
1950s. By the '70s, the city had a well-trained battalion of painters
who were able to provide any icon of machismo and pop culture that
tourists wanted splashed across the fabric.</TE>
<TE>   There was a moment in the early- to mid-1960s when velvet painting
could have become serious art in Tijuana. The painters who were using
the medium were widely considered some of Tijuana's best: Miguel
Najera, Tony Maya, Roberto Sanchez, Nacho Amaro. Imitators hadn't yet
entered the field. Tijuana's main attraction, however, was Avenida
Revolucion, the tourist drag known for intense competition among
merchants. Tijuana took the low velvet road and soon paintings were
selling wholesale.</TE>
<TE>   Imitations of what sold well became the prevailing ethic. Painter
Jesus Gutierrez photographed a neighbor with rugged features. Using
the man's photograph as a model, he painted a bandit. The man moved
away long ago and his name is lost to history, but he became the
standard bandit for dozens of velvet painters. Through the years,
they would add whiskers, an eye patch, scars, a beard, a mustache or
a cigarette. But the nose, eyes and chiseled visage remain
unmistakably the same. "You paint something, and if it sells well
everyone does it," says Gutierrez, who owns a gallery in town and
paints velvet only on request.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1970s, velvet had become the purview of an
international assortment of immigrant merchants who would visit
Tijuana. There was a Mexican guy from Arizona. Bart the Armenian
lived in New Zealand and would order 200 paintings each time he came
through, as did an Indian fellow from Trinidad and Tobago.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian Arabs are remembered most fondly by Tijuana's velvet
painters. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, they arrived almost
every month and set up in a San Ysidro motel. They'd order paintings
in lots of 100. Tijuana's painters would frantically dash off the
work over the next two weeks, and the Arabs would fill
tractor-trailers and truck them to Toronto. "They'd empty Tijuana
every time they'd come," recalls Juan Velazquez.</TE>
<TE>   One day, while hurrying to fill an order, Jose Velazquez finished
a canvas and tossed it aside. Later he found that it had landed face
down against a blank piece of velvet and had left a print. The
Velazquez studio grew hushed. He swore his sons to secrecy. Soon they
were painting one canvas heavily and then laying it against a blank
one, pressing the two together. They would quickly fill in some
detail and have a sellable second painting in a fraction of the time
it took to paint one from scratch. Soon the Velazquez home was a
velvet production line.</TE>
<TE>   During these years, the twins built their parents a home, paid the
household expenses, bought cars and clothes, and gave money to their
sisters. By 1979, the velvet painting market was so crowded with
artists painting the same kitsch that they undercut each other's
prices, with most works selling for $10 to $30 each. The painters
decided to unionize, and the Quetzalcoatl Painters Union grew to 350
members.</TE>
<TE>   Through the union, velvet painting became part of the PRI. The PRI
ruled Mexico for so long because it mastered the ability to co-opt
and extract loyalty from varied sectors of Mexican life. It did this
by threatening to levy government sanctions against those outside the
party.</TE>
<TE>   During that same period, the Tijuana police began rousting velvet
painters who worked and sold in public. So the new union asked Rafael
Garcia Vazquez, a PRI leader and head of the collection of vendors
unions known as the Revolutionary Workers Confederation, to help
defend them. In exchange, the painters joined the PRI and supported
the political career of Garcia Vazquez. At one point, Garcia Vazquez
even tried to use velvet painting unionists as his bodyguards when a
faction within the confederation threatened to oust him or kill him
or both.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of velvet paintings began to weaken in the mid-'80s as
tourists' tastes turned to other things. Painting on onyx was popular
for a while, and by the end of the 1980s, velvet's glory days had
drawn to a close. Painters stopped painting. The union faded away.
Jose Velazquez spent the last years of his life as a cartoonist,
selling his work in front of the Fronton Palacio jai alai hall. One
day even the Canadian Arabs stopped coming, without a final goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   These were the years when Tijuana began turning away from tourism.
The decline of velvet painting correlates directly with the rise of
the city's assembly plants, which make increasing numbers of
America's televisions. Today the town's economy has diversified. Its
middle class has expanded. Most of the people crossing from Tijuana
into the United States are Tijuana residents with cars and money,
going shopping. The city now has an opera company, two conservatories
of classical music and far more Mexican businessmen visiting on
weekdays than American tourists.</TE>
<TE>   If velvet painting once defined Tijuana to Americans, and a good
many Mexicans, its decline serves as a faithful barometer of the
city's changing place in world culture.</TE>
<TE>   While the Velazquez brothers continue to work in velvet, they can
no longer make enough money by selling paintings to stores. So they
take them to the street. Abel Velazquez says, however, that he was
recently prohibited from selling his paintings on the tourist bridge
to Avenida Revolucion. Mixtec Indian vendors from Oaxaca--selling
serapes, gum, wrestling masks and grains of rice with your name on
them--complained that he was hurting their sales. This may be the
final indignity: Indians, once the most disparaged of Tijuana's
migrants, now have the political power to push around velvet
painters.</TE>
<TE>   "We spent our youth in velvet painting. They were nice years,"
says Abel Velazquez. "But it's like everything else. Everything
ends."</TE>

Over Their Estrangement</DH>

<AU>Steve Salerno</AU>
<BD>Steve Salerno last wrote for the magazine about the
need to soothe and be soothed.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By all rights, we should be having a catch. That's what I was
thinking as I sat parked discreetly out of my 18-year-old's line of
sight, behind a natural peephole in a copse of evergreens on a street
that abuts the basketball courts.</LD>
<LD>   Around me the pulsing hum of the locusts sliced the heavy air.
Last year's basketball season was a dim memory; the next one wouldn't
begin for months. This was, unmistakably, baseball weather. In years
past, Graig and I would have long since broken out the gloves and
lost ourselves in the customary summertime ritual of pounding and
oiling. In the process we'd leave the family room redolent of leather
and neat's-foot oil--a tandem scent that evokes dugouts and
close-cropped outfield grass and fly balls drifting through an azure
sky on a warm summer day.</LD>
<LD>   But not this summer day.</LD>
<TE>   Out on the court, Graig--the unusual spelling is a tribute to
famed San Diego Padres third baseman Graig Nettles--set himself, rose
on the toes of his size 14 feet and launched the ball in a high,
sweeping trajectory. The shot dropped, sending the string net
swishing first one way, then the other, then sharply back, like the
grass skirt of a hula dancer at the height of her terpsichorean
frenzy. A trace of a self-satisfied grin flickered across his face
before he coiled himself into a crouch and sprinted toward the
basket. With a quick thrust of one of his immense hands, he
intercepted the bounding ball just as it was about to stray off the
court. Then he dribbled back to the foul line to begin anew.</TE>
<TE>   The watching was bittersweet. I savored my son's athletic
presence, yet despaired at the fact that he no longer cared to
perform for my benefit, as he once did with such endearing glee on
the ball diamond. In his early years as a Little League pitcher,
Graig was given to glancing my way in mid-delivery, a practice that
did little for his control and still less for the nerves of opposing
batters, who must have wondered what the big lefty with the scary
fastball was looking at when he was supposed to be homing in on home
plate. More recently, though, my son had grown uncomfortable with my
watching him play sports (albeit no more uncomfortable than when I
watched him do just about anything, or even when I tried talking to
him). Which is why I remained behind the evergreens until he finished
and headed for home.</TE>
<TE>   Partly, I consoled myself, our estrangement was a normal stage in
adolescence, an expression of my son's need to map out his own
identity. But partly, too, it was an expression of a deeper distance
that had crept into our relationship, just as it has crept into so
many father-son relationships. It was a distance whose dimensions
could be read in the diverging paths of two sports--one in
ascendancy, the other in decline.</TE>
<TE>   It's clear that basketball has overtaken baseball in the hearts
and minds of adolescent males, a happenstance most observers
attribute to the shrewdness of the sport's overtures to young
America. Basketball was quicker to grasp the concept of sports as
show biz, the extent to which slick multimedia packaging would appeal
to an MTV audience. This helps explain why, across America, the sharp
crack of wood against horsehide has been drowned out by the
persistent thump of a basketball on concrete.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, I ask myself, is it coincidence that basketball thrives
at the precise moment in history when fathers have all but
disappeared from the American landscape? In some cases the dads are
gone physically due to divorce or out-of-wedlock pregnancy. In other
cases the men are emotionally absent, buried in their work. Either
way, we are left with boys who were, or feel, abandoned by their
dads.</TE>
<TE>   Basketball, to me, is the perfect game for this grim Zeitgeist, an
in-your-face world of slamming and stuffing and ''trash talk.'' I
recall watching a particularly raucous shoot-around among Graig and
his friends one day and thinking: This game, it taps something, some
sense of estrangement, in the soul of the estranged. For if baseball
is Frank Sinatra, basketball is rap--audacious, edgy, a showcase for
the machismo of a generation of young men who, deprived of a father's
steadying influence, grew up thinking that they ''don't need nobody''
but themselves.</TE>
<TE>   I can't say precisely when my son began to see himself this way.
In memory, it seems as if our relationship went from doting to
dissonant overnight. I'm sure it wasn't actually like that. I do
remember being ''on his case,'' as he put it, much of the time,
harping on his appearance or his mouthiness or his driving or his
disinclination to commit much of himself to anything in life. One
evening he shaved his head. A few days later he came home with a
beat-up basketball. His baseball glove took its place in permanent
repose on the floor of the front closet.</TE>
<TE>   It occurs to me now that you cannot maintain the same rapport with
your son on the baseball diamond when elsewhere in your relationship
everything is wrong. Baseball is far too intimate an experience for
that. It is meant to be played by fathers and sons who enjoy each
other. Where there are no fathers, or there is no joy, there will not
likely be baseball. Basketball, on the other hand, is a solitary
ritual of man versus hoop or man versus his own physical limitations.
Far from requiring a father, it does not even require
friends--certainly not for practice. It is the textbook definition of
insularity. Freud might say there are times when a foul shot is just
a foul shot. Perhaps so. I know only what my instincts tell me:
America would be a happier place if there were fewer kids out alone
perfecting their jump shots and more kids chasing the fly balls off
their fathers' bats on a summer day.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, it is early evening and my boy is once again out
there, by himself, shooting hoops. With a sigh, I grab the car keys
and prepare to complete my part of the melancholy bargain, observing
without being observed. Somehow I can't get the smell of neat's-foot
oil out of my brain.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of Caribbean and Mexican resorts operating as
"all-inclusives" -- that is, supplying a room, three meals daily,
unlimited beverages, sports and entertainment for one fixed price --
continues to grow. As these properties spread, competition among them
increases.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout January and sometimes even further into winter, the
price for a week at some tropical all-inclusives, including
round-trip air fare, has fallen to about $1,000 or less. In the
examples below, $859 to $1,125 will buy you air fare, accommodations,
meals and drinks for a week, and almost everything else for which you
would usually pay extra at a noninclusive resort.</LD>
<LD>   Cancun from $859: A seven-night vacation in Mexico's most popular
location at the seaside Barcelo Club las Perlas, an economy resort
minutes from the shopping district, costs as little as $859 for
departures from Oakland on Jan. 12, 19 and 26, or $929 for Feb. 2, 6,
20 and 27. The charter flights are operated by SunTrips, (800)
786-8747, www.suntrips.com. Single-room surcharge: $150 to $200.
Prices vary according to dates.</LD>
<TE>   Playa del Carmen from $969: This winter, E-Vacations.com, (888)
653-8242, www.e-vacations.com, is offering seven-night stays in Playa
del Carmen, a booming Mexican resort town 40 miles south of Cancun.
Its "Mucha Playa" package is for stays at the 130-room Club Bananas,
where all rooms have a terrace or balcony. The rate is as low as $969
from Los Angeles for midweek departures during high season, Jan. 7 to
March 24. Additional nights cost $76, and the supplement for singles
is $98. Price varies by date.</TE>
<TE>   Honduras from $1,020: Often overshadowed by neighboring Belize,
Honduras is friendly and inexpensive, with superb diving and a
vibrant culture. Capricorn Leisure, (800) 426-6544,
www.capricorn.net, lures travelers for seven nights at the 118-room
Barcelo Palma Real Beach Resort (with casino, two restaurants, pool,
disco, sports and children's activities) in Playa Roma off the
Caribbean coast for $1,020 from Los Angeles and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Panama from $1,125: Also from Capricorn Leisure: You can
experience the Central American isthmus from two perspectives, with
seven-night vacations including air fare and ground transfers. Spend
one night on the Costa del Sol in Panama City, then pass six nights
at the Barcelo las Olas, a Pacific oceanfront property in Chiriqui,
west of a national turtle sanctuary. It has two restaurants and two
pools. Based on midweek travel Jan. 2 to March 31, prices are $1,125
from Los Angeles and San Francisco. Additional nights: $87 each.</TE>
<TE>   Any drawbacks to an all-inclusive resort? First, meals tend to be
buffet style, and some travelers tire of that weeklong sameness. More
important, because you have already paid for all meals, you may be
discouraged from trying the local cuisine or experiencing the
restaurants outside the resort. You and your fellow guests rarely
stray from the hotel's grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Some Americans don't like the idea of an all-inclusive resort;
others find the price advantages irresistible. Either way,
all-inclusives provide one of the cheapest ways to enjoy a tropical
vacation.</TE>

<LD>"There's something about being out in the swamp, especially when
you're by yourself ... something that seems to just suck the poisons
of civilized life right out of you, a kind of healing power that lets
you begin to be yourself again." Greg "Dancing Bear" Guirard was
quoting from his book, "The Land of Dead Giants," and his rapt
audience -- passengers on the steamboat Delta Queen -- nodded in
agreement.</LD>
<LD>   On a cruise through the Cajun backwaters of Louisiana only a few
miles from New Orleans, Greg and other lecturers were giving us a
crash course in Cajun life, history, music and culture from the
immigrants' early days in France, through the tumultuous days in
Acadia, Canada, to the swamp and bayou life in southern Louisiana.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Fontenot explained bird species and flora and other fauna of
the swamps and bayous. Guirard offered insight into the lives and
thinking of Cajuns.</LD>
<TE>   Mark de Basile was playing an accordion, and other Cajun musicians
kept the boat alive with music that had everyone clapping along and
occasionally jumping up to do the two-step.</TE>
<TE>   As Greg said: "A Cajun who isn't having fun is wasting his life."</TE>
<TE>   We cruised from New Orleans on the Mississippi River and entered
the Intracoastal Waterway, headed for New Iberia. We had a full day
of steamboating, and the sunny day drew passengers to the rocking
chairs on deck, where they relaxed with the slow current of the
river, followed the flights of egrets, cormorants and eagles, and
listened to a calliope concert.</TE>
<TE>   But not all was Cajun on the ship. For variety, there was the
Dixieland Five band, song stylist Annie Lebeaux and ragtime demon
Jazzou Jones, who is also cruise director.</TE>
<TE>   Although each meal featured a Cajun dish, American favorites were
standard.</TE>
<TE>   At New Iberia, an optional all-day tour for $55 started with a
drive through the countryside to St. Martinsville, home of the
Evangeline Oak, a memorial to the Acadian settlers. Next was a walk
in the nature sanctuary of Lake Martin, where the cypress trees drip
with Spanish moss. The day was topped off with a fais do-do, a
communal dance, and a lunch of seafood gumbo, fried chicken, shrimp
nuggets and jambalaya. The Cajun band from the ship began to play,
augmented by local musicians and singers. Local dancers arrived to
demonstrate the two-step, and soon everyone joined in, swirling
around the dance floor.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the week was filled with a swamp tour of Lake
Henderson ($46); a cruise on the Atchafalaya River to St.
Francisville (on the Mississippi River) for a shore visit ($46) to a
penitentiary and Greenwood Plantation or a tour of Myrtles and
Rosedown plantations ($46); and a final port of call at Baton Rouge
before returning to New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   The Delta Queen, part of the bankruptcy action of American Classic
Cruises, was bought earlier this year by Delaware North Co., which
also purchased two other steamboats, the Mississippi Queen and
American Queen.</TE>
<TE>   Delaware North will continue three- to 11-night itineraries along
the Mississippi and Ohio rivers and will feature theme cruises -- big
band and jazz, among others -- as American Classic Cruises did. A
Lewis and Clark itinerary will be introduced to coincide with the
anniversary of the expedition. The American Queen will be returned to
service in January.</TE>
<TE>   Brochure rates for seven-night cruises are $1,225 to $3,864 per
person, double occupancy. For information, contact (800) 543-1949,
www.deltaqueen.com.</TE>
<TE>   The 174-passenger paddle-wheel steamboat Delta Queen was built in
1926 as a sister to paddle-wheeler Delta King and ran overnight
service between San Francisco and Sacramento. Just before World War
II, the Navy leased the boat to transport troops in San Francisco
Bay. During the war the vessel was used as a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   In 1946 it was purchased by Tom Green, whose family had run a
steamboat company since 1890. His mother, Mary B. Green, was one of
the first female captains and pilots on the Mississippi. Green had
the Delta Queen moved from San Francisco through the Panama Canal to
New Orleans, where it sailed to Cincinnati.</TE>

<HD>On the wild side of life in Dominica</HD>
<DH>You don't come to this island Eden for beaches or night
spots. But flora, fauna and geologic wonders are here in profusion.

<DL>Portsmouth, Dominica</DL>
<LD>The rattling prop plane lurched and careened between steep peaks as
we approached Dominica's rudimentary airfield, set in a narrow valley
at the edge of the sea. One false turn and we'd be flattened against
a mountainside. Yet I couldn't keep from peering out the window at
the scenery: brilliant flashes of red and orange wildflowers against
crumply, jungly ridges, and clear, boulder-strewn streams rushing
through paradise.</LD>
<LD>   Angst and awe intertwined, a melange of emotions that would sum up
the experiences we longtime college friends, Leslie Ricketts, Monica
Ekman and I, had on a trip last March to the Caribbean's nature isle.</LD>
<LD>   Positioned between the French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe
in the West Indies, Dominica (dom-in-EE-ka) is a 29-mile-long Eden of
primeval rain forest, endangered parrots, waterfalls fed by 365
rivers and more than 80 species of orchids. What it doesn't have are
white-sand beaches and their attendant resort hotels and casinos.
Dominica has remained an unspoiled destination for hikers,
naturalists and divers, albeit a tad rough around the edges, as we
found out upon landing.</LD>
<TE>   When we made reservations at the Picard Beach Cottage Resort, near
Portsmouth, about an hour's drive from Melville Hall Airport in the
island's northern realm, the receptionist had said a car would be
waiting.</TE>
<TE>   "Need a ride? I'll take you."</TE>
<TE>   As we stood looking like tourists in front of the airport, a man
appeared, obviously a local with his British-tinged lilt. Most
Dominicans are descendants of African slaves brought by 18th century
planters. English is the official language, and, because of a later
occupation by the French, a French-based patois is widely spoken as
well.</TE>
<TE>   "No thanks. We're taken care of," Leslie said.</TE>
<TE>   The man waited and watched as we watched and waited. He spoke
again, insisting that we call the hotel on his cell phone. They knew
him, he promised.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, the hotel had forgotten about us, and yes, they knew
Max. We hopped into his minivan and rode along tiny, twisty roads
through fluorescent green cane fields edged with coconut palms, past
jagged cliffs overlooking teal waters. Peering now and again in the
rearview mirror, Max regaled us with stories about island life and
offered to ferry us around during our stay. We made no promises.</TE>
<TE>   Dominica isn't known for its luxe accommodations, but we didn't
fare too badly those first few nights. Picard Beach Cottages is a
clutch of wood bungalows in 18th century vernacular style, sitting
among tropical gardens on the island's longest beach, which stretches
a mile. We dropped our luggage and strolled along the volcanic black,
palm-fringed sand. We spotted only one person, a distant figure
making a beeline toward us. Word had gotten out that new tourist
blood had arrived.</TE>
<TE>   His name was Alexis, a tall, young, congenial guy in army pants.
He offered to drive us anywhere we wanted. "Parrots, sure, I can take
you there. Waterfalls, volcanoes, no problem."</TE>
<TE>   We began to see how, though the island had no formal tourist
infrastructure, an indigenous counterpart had taken root in the guise
of entrepreneurial young men determined enough to buy a car, enabling
them to take visitors to hard-to-reach sites, as well as lead guided
hikes, snorkeling excursions -- whatever you want, for a very U.S.
fee. The young men are knowledgeable about their island and can
provide much insight into local life. But you need to know the going
rates and do some hard-nosed bartering. Even then misunderstandings
can occur.</TE>
<TE>   The only other options for getting around seemed to be renting a
car and negotiating narrow, potholed, unsigned roads (on the left
side, no less), or signing up with sketchy tour companies.</TE>
<TE>   As we contemplated our logistical situation, we decided to head to
nearby Portsmouth for dinner. That is, until the hotel clerk warned
us that it's unwise to venture into town after dark. Machete-wielding
men sometimes pounce on unsuspecting foreigners. (Machetes are common
here because many men use them in sugar cane fields.) Just petty
theft, she reassured, nothing serious. The best option would be to
have someone drive us for about 37 cents each, she said.</TE>
<TE>   We chose to dine at the hotel's restaurant, Le Flambeau. The
open-air eating area sits right on the water, with clacking palm
fronds and the surf mingling in a melodious serenade.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll have the Creole-style kingfish," Monica said.</TE>
<TE>   "No more," the waitress said laconically.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, the flying fish special," Monica said.</TE>
<TE>   "No more."</TE>
<TE>   While Monica pondered what else to order, I chose the Creole
chicken, which the waitress wrote on her pad.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll have that too," Leslie said.</TE>
<TE>   "No more."</TE>
<TE>   So eating wasn't going to be easy either. We played out this
scenario at restaurants all over the island until we learned to
ignore the menu altogether and ask the server what was waiting in the
kitchen. What was certain was that every dish came with delicious
"provisions," side dishes such as beans, rice, potatoes and dasheen
(a kind of taro), and that once we got our food, it would be flavored
in the delectable Creole way.</TE>
<TE>   Early the next morning, as we were taking a wake-up swim, Alexis
strolled up the empty beach to "check up on us." We hesitantly
decided that hiring a driver was the best way to go, and, because we
had already given Max some business, we agreed to have Alexis take us
to the parrot sanctuary that afternoon for about $9 each.</TE>
<TE>   On tiny, winding roads we bumped up to the foot of Morne
Diablotins, Dominica's highest mountain at 4,747 feet, deep in the
Northern Forest Reserve. This remote wilderness offers just a
sampling of Dominica's supreme primordial beauty. We headed on foot
down the mile-long Syndicate Trail, which offered our best chance of
spotting the endangered sisserou (the national bird) and smaller
Jacquot parrots. Alexis knew exactly where the parrots should be.
Alas, it was raining, and though we heard the birds, they stayed out
of sight.</TE>
<TE>   Next we strolled to nearby Milton Falls. Along the way, Alexis
pointed out a cinnamon tree with its peeling, fragrant bark, bananas
ready for the picking, coffee bushes, orange trees overflowing with
sweet fruit, wild thyme and avocados, mere hints at the fecundity of
this lush isle. And we spotted two tiny specks flying high in the
sky. Parrots!</TE>
<TE>   When things are too perfect, you know something's wrong. Sure
enough, as Alexis dropped us off at the hotel, we nearly fell for one
of the oldest tricks in the tourist scam books. We had agreed to the
price in East Caribbean dollars, but now our friendly guide insisted
that we pay in U.S. dollars -- $75 for a two-hour ride. (U.S. dollars
are widely accepted.) We argued and complained, finally compromising
at $60 total and learning an important lesson: When settling on a
price, make sure you've decided on a currency.</TE>
<TE>   Getting tired of the scams</TE>
<TE>   There are other things to do in northern Dominica, but it was time
for us to move 20 miles south, to the capital of Roseau. But the
question was how.</TE>
<TE>   The easiest way to get there was with an informal taxi service for
$122 East Caribbean ($45 for three). Or was that $122 U.S.? The
answers were never straight, and we were beginning to feel
uncomfortable. Maybe renting a car would be best, we began to think.
Then, by happenstance, we learned that a local taxi minivan could
transport us to Roseau for only $2.80 each. It was one of the best
finds of our trip.</TE>
<TE>   Alexis and Max were on hand as we rolled our suitcases to the main
street and waited for the minivan. And waited. And waited. Finally we
relented, agreeing to pay Max the relatively exorbitant price of $45
to drive the three of us. We piled in, and he turned around toward
Portsmouth.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you doing?" Leslie cried.</TE>
<TE>   "Taking you to Roseau," Max said.</TE>
<TE>   Once again the plan had changed: He was going to put us on a local
minivan, the same one we had been waiting for, pay the driver the
going rate and pocket the profit.</TE>
<TE>   "Let us off. Now!" I yelled.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately he dropped us near the local taxi depot, where we had
no trouble finding the next minivan south. (Registered taxis and
minivans are designated by an HA or H on the license plate.) As we
sped down the coast road, packed between 10 Dominicans and their
luggage, closing our eyes as the driver screeched around cars on
blind curves, we congratulated ourselves for figuring out a tiny
piece of the getting-around puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   Unbelievably, the first thing we saw in Roseau (ROO-so) was an
enormous cruise ship, looming over the collection of wood-and-stone
buildings adorned with Victorian fretwork and overhanging balconies.
Camera-bedecked tourists filled the streets close to shore. One of
the first nods to tourism in Dominica has been the development of a
deep harbor to support not one but two cruise ships at a time.</TE>
<TE>   We prowled around Old Market Square, a crafts market on the former
site of slave auctions and executions; admired piles of bananas,
coconuts and mangelos (really sweet oranges) at the Saturday morning
farmers market; then strolled away from the sunburned crowd up narrow
streets to the botanical gardens, dating from the 1890s.</TE>
<TE>   The only way to reach the secluded Papillote Wilderness Retreat, a
cluster of green stucco bungalows deep in the rain forest and our
home for three nights, was by taxi. The driver began asking questions
about where we would be touring, but by now we knew enough to remain
elusive.</TE>
<TE>   Anne Jno Baptiste, an American married to a Dominican, started the
nature reserve in 1967, planting indigenous orchids, bromeliads,
heliconias and gingers in the jungle at the foot of Morne Macaque.
It's now an eco-inn with steaming mineral baths, a labyrinth of
walking trails and lots of chaise longues strategically placed for
relaxing to the accompaniment of chirping frogs and pattering rain
(300 inches of rain annually on the mountains here).</TE>
<TE>   We could have happily stayed exclusively at Papillote, but the
seven-mile one-way trek to Boiling Lake beckoned. Many agree that
this arduous, all-day hike to the world's second-largest boiling
lake, in Morne Trois Pitons National Park, is the Caribbean's most
spectacular. You need a guide, which we arranged through the front
desk for a whopping $50 each.</TE>
<TE>   Brian, fond of the phrase "Ya, mon," picked us up in his
spiffed-up Toyota and drove us to the trail head.</TE>
<TE>   In pouring rain we followed him past giant gommier trees, which
the Carib Indians use to carve canoes, and birds of paradise. We
panted up and over Morne Nicholls, by which time the rain had abated
but not the mud. Then began the precarious, rocky descent into the
Valley of Desolation, a Dantesque moonscape that is the lingering
devastation of a 19th century volcanic eruption. We had begun to
smell sulfur about a mile back, but here the noxious odor assailed
our nostrils and throats. More than 50 steaming fumaroles and hot
springs bubbled and burped and percolated throughout the
moss-and-lichen-covered valley, crossed by inky streams so hot they
can burn flesh. With no marked trail, we stayed close to Brian.</TE>
<TE>   On the valley's other side we climbed some more, finally reaching
the eponymous lake, measuring 210 feet across and nearly 200 feet
deep and roiling away at a constant 198 degrees. It's believed to be
a flooded fumarole, a crack through which gases escape from the
molten lava below, heating the water. Perched on rocks above the
smelly, sulfurous clouds, we ate our bag lunches before heading back
the same way, muddy and fatigued but awestruck.</TE>
<TE>   As the sun fell into the shimmery gold sea one evening, Monica,
Leslie and I sat on a pier in Roseau watching an illuminated cruise
ship, bigger than a building, returning its passengers to sea in
cookie-cutter luxury.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly I became nostalgic. Someday, I thought, big-time tourism
is going to find this hidden place, with all its wonders and wondrous
quirks. Let's just hope that planners step wisely.</TE>

<HD>In Dana Point, a kids' marine scene</HD>
<DH>From expanded Ocean Institute to tall ship to beach, the
small fry get a big splash of watery exploration.</DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Dana Point</DL>
<LD>"Mom, I see a boy!" My daughter's shout drew me to the sliding door
of our hotel room.</LD>
<LD>   "What?" I replied, looking down to a deserted, rain-spattered pool
deck.</LD>
<LD>   "Not there," Kyla said, "there." She pointed farther out into the
night, toward the ocean. "I can see the red light."</LD>
<TE>   I squinted and could just make out a glowing speck in the
darkness. Ah, a buoy.</TE>
<TE>   My daughter's excitement was contagious one Saturday last month.
Despite a late start because of a storm, we finally had arrived at
the Doubletree Guest Suites in Dana Point for a three-day weekend. A
fire flickered at a Doheny Beach campsite across the road, the buoy
winked in the Pacific and room service soon would deliver our dinner
of clam chowder and Caesar salad. More good things were ahead:
visiting the Ocean Institute's new $16.5-million marine education and
research facility, sailing on an old-fashioned tall ship and combing
the beach to see what the storm waves had tossed up.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, our gamble on the weather paid off. I opened the
drapes to blue skies.</TE>
<TE>   Our gamble on a budget-priced hotel paid off too. On the
Doubletree Web site I had found a nightly rate of $62 (plus tax and
$13 for parking), low enough to give me pause. And upon arrival, my
suspicions seemed confirmed when we were given a room that was a
humid 80 degrees. No amount of coaxing could keep the air conditioner
working.</TE>
<TE>   But the front desk staff proved courteous, sending up a bellman to
move us into a room with a functioning air conditioner and an ocean
view. The bedroom and bathroom were compact, and the furnishings were
a bit worn around the edges. But the separate parlor, a godsend when
traveling with a child, more than compensated with its microwave,
refrigerator, sink, TV and VCR.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning Kyla and I lingered over hot chocolate and warm
bread -- microwave cooking at its finest -- before setting out for
Dana Point Harbor, a five-minute drive.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Point is named for Richard Henry Dana Jr., author of "Two
Years Before the Mast." He sailed from Boston in 1834 on the brig
Pilgrim, bound for California to trade manufactured goods for cattle
hides and tallow. Dana Point, then called Capistrano Bay, was on the
ship's trading route.</TE>
<TE>   The harbor and town don't show many signs of those old days. Two
marinas have slips for more than 2,400 yachts, and luxury homes are
perched atop the cliffs from which ranch hands threw bundles of hides
to sailors on the beach below.</TE>
<TE>   We stopped for brunch at Harpoon Henry's in Mariners Village, a
collection of restaurants and shops by the harbor. I enjoyed my
scrambled eggs, muffins and fruit, and Kyla liked her
cinnamon-vanilla French toast. Our booth overlooked rows of boats,
kayakers paddling between the slips and white sails gliding out to
sea. It was a million-dollar view for $17.23.</TE>
<TE>   Ocean Institute aquariums</TE>
<TE>   The Ocean Institute is less than a mile away at the other end of
the harbor, an easy walk except for 7-year-old legs. We drove.</TE>
<TE>   The institute opened its Ocean Education Center in October.
Weekdays the classrooms are filled with students. But on weekends the
facility opens to the public for tours of classroom laboratories,
including new aquariums. More than 10,000 gallons of seawater are
home to small sharks, black sea bass, bottom dwellers such as brittle
sea stars and other colorful life.</TE>
<TE>   My daughter has loved fish since she was too small to pronounce
their names, so we had high expectations. Then we saw the sign at the
door: "Tours canceled today."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently a car had plowed into the center's power generator the
night before. The driver disappeared from the scene, but the Ocean
Institute's fish did not get off so easily: During the blackout, the
tanks couldn't filter the water and regulate the temperature as
usual.</TE>
<TE>   By Sunday morning, power had been only partly restored, and the
classroom aquariums were off-limits while staff administered fish
first aid. (The institute reported no casualties.)</TE>
<TE>   Kyla and I were able to explore lobby exhibits about underwater
archeology in the sunken city of Port Royal, Jamaica, and about ice
probes that one day might be used on Jupiter's moon Europa. Kyla
didn't pay much attention to the display of 17th century pewter
plates and pirate cannonballs, but she liked operating the
magnetometer that demonstrated how divers find metal artifacts buried
on the ocean floor.</TE>
<TE>   We left for an even more appealing exhibit, the Ocean Institute's
full-size replica of Richard Dana's Pilgrim. The brig, fully
operational but usually moored as a living-history classroom, holds a
free open house most Sundays. With Kyla leading the way, we clambered
up to the helm, then to the tight quarters below decks.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the Ocean Institute's vessels do go out on the water. The
calendar of cruises includes trips to see marine wildlife during the
day or bioluminescence at night. (Visitors also can join Capt. Dave's
Dolphin Safari; the popular Dana Point catamaran operation, not
affiliated with the Ocean Institute, looks for dolphins and whales.)</TE>
<TE>   We chose a three-hour tour on the Ocean Institute's other tall
ship, the Spirit of Dana Point. Capt. Sully motored us out of the
harbor. John, a crewman in a striped T-shirt and cloth cap, divided
passengers into teams to raise the sails.</TE>
<TE>   "When I say 'heave,' you say 'ho' and pull hard," John instructed.</TE>
<TE>   Our ship soon was scudding along in a breeze. Capt. Sully gave
each child a turn at the helm, and John played a ukulele and sang
silly songs and sea chanteys. I leaned back to enjoy the sun on my
face and the roll of the waves. Eventually we lost the wind, so the
captain switched on the engine to return to harbor.</TE>
<TE>   After soup for me and a kid's sandwich for Kyla at the Brig
Restaurant, we shopped at Mariners Village and rounded out the
evening with a girls' night in the hotel. We watched "The Princess
Diaries" (brought from home) on the VCR and painted each other's
fingernails.</TE>
<TE>   Monday was a holiday, so we had the luxury of swimming in the
hotel's small pool and relaxing in the spa before breakfast in the
Doubletree restaurant. After checking out, we went to Doheny State
Beach, a five-minute walk, across PCH.</TE>
<TE>   Kyla enjoyed the visitor center, which features aquariums and an
artificial tide pool full of real critters, such as sea stars and
hermit crabs. I had brought a falcon-shaped kite, which we assembled
but couldn't keep from divebombing into the sand. A passerby with two
kids showed me how to tug on the kite's string to flap the falcon's
wings every time it began to lose altitude. Kyla raced off to play
with her new friends while I swooped the kite below gulls and
pelicans.</TE>
<TE>   Our last stop was for lunch at the nearby Laguna Cliffs Marriott
Resort's Regatta Grill. The view of lush lawns and azure ocean was
spectacular, as was my crispy-skin salmon. Kyla was content with a
grilled-cheese sandwich. We peeked into one of the guest rooms,
refurbished in the resort's recent $10-million renovation. It was
luxurious, but our suite at the Doubletree was bigger, and better for
my budget.</TE>
<TE>   I still think back to when, as we watched the sun sink past the
yacht masts at Mariners Village, Kyla held up two dandelions and
said, "Make a wish, Mom." I did. And with any luck, we'll be back in
Dana Point soon.</TE>

<LD>A loving squeeze for Florida citrus</LD>
<LD>   The theme of the Florida Citrus Festival, Jan. 16 to 26 in Winter

<HD>The bonanza of Fort Worth</HD>
<DH>Cowboys and culture happily coexist deep in the heart of
Texas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSEMARY MCCLURE</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Fort Worth</DL>
<LD>You probably don't give much thought to Fort Worth when you fly into
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. If you think about it at
all, you may associate the town with cowboys, livestock and rodeos.
And with good reason: Fort Worth residents are proud of their Western
heritage. They even call their city Cowtown.</LD>
<LD>   But you may not know that Fort Worth is a culture capital, with 14
museums, including a huge new contemporary art museum that was
scheduled to open Saturday. In a city where oil money and
philanthropy go hand in hand, its museums can and do buy some of the
biggest and best art in the world. That's a bonanza for visitors,
especially considering that many Fort Worth museums don't charge
admission.</LD>
<LD>   When I was here last month, friend Jorden Nye and I took advantage
of the city's multifaceted charms, from its cowboys to its culture.</LD>
<TE>   We cheered as bull riders tried to stay aboard 1,800 pounds of
wildly kicking fury; we yelled "yeehaw" when cowboys herded longhorn
Texas steers through town; and we rubbed elbows with about 6,000
Willie Nelson fans as the country music icon performed at the world's
largest honky-tonk.</TE>
<TE>   Then we visited the city's cultural district for a preview of its
new crown jewel: the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday the Modern was to open its new building to the public,
becoming one of the largest contemporary art museums in the nation.
The $65-million building, designed by internationally known Japanese
architect Tadao Ando, holds an impressive collection of postwar art,
ranging from mid-20th century Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art to
new works in various media, including video and sound.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the things you only see in books," Jorden said when we
visited.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Modern is worth a visit on its own, it is but one of
several significant cultural institutions. There are so many that the
city calls itself the "museum capital of the Southwest."</TE>
<TE>   Some are small and regional, but others have notable claims to
fame. Across the street from the new Modern is the Kimbell Art
Museum, whose architecture and wide-ranging collections propel it to
the fore as one of America's best small museums. It was designed by
20th century architect Louis Kahn, a controversial but well-respected
figure.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby is the Ammon Carter Museum, whose large American art
collection includes several hundred sculptures and paintings by
Western artists Frederic Remington and Charles Russell; it also
contains one of the nation's largest photography collections.</TE>
<TE>   Just around the corner is the new American Cowgirl Museum, a
rootin', tootin' homage to the women who shaped the West.</TE>
<TE>   And a few miles away in the downtown district is the striking Bass
Performance Hall, one of the top opera houses in the world, according
to Travel &amp; Leisure magazine. It was designed by architect David M.
Schwarz of Washington, D.C., in the classic European style and opened
in 1998. Two 48-foot-tall trumpeting angels decorate the facade. Like
other Fort Worth cultural institutions, including the Modern, the
hall was built with private funds.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, in the last 10 years Fort Worth residents have raised
$285 million for new cultural institutions. A good chunk came from
the billionaire Bass family, sometimes called the Medicis of Fort
Worth, and from other key families and businesses, but many ordinary
folks also donated.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people think the words 'cowboy' and 'culture' don't mix, but
there's no conflict," said Douglas Harman, president of the Fort
Worth Convention and Visitors Bureau. "People of the horse world love
the West; they also enjoy visiting museums."</TE>
<TE>   Edward P. Bass, a member of the cattle- and oil-rich clan and the
motivating force behind the construction of the performance hall,
likes to talk about how Fort Worth celebrates its cow town roots. "Is
it unique that we should pursue both high culture and popular
heritage so passionately?" he asked. "First and foremost, we want
Fort Worth to be a good place to live.</TE>
<TE>   Ups and downs of downtown</TE>
<TE>   The effort to make Fort Worth a good place to live accelerated
about 20 years ago with the beginning of the renovation of downtown.
A 20-block area was renamed Sundance Square after the Sundance Kid,
who hid out here with buddy Butch Cassidy around the turn of the
century.</TE>
<TE>   The district has fine hotels, restaurants, shops, nightclubs and
such only-in-Fort-Worth highlights as life-size topiary longhorn
steers and a half-block-wide mural of a herd of cattle being driven
along the Chisholm Trail, which once ran through downtown Fort Worth.
There are redbrick streets, turn-of-the-century buildings and
twinkling lights that line buildings and decorate trees and window
frames.</TE>
<TE>   But some of the bloom is off the rose in this area, once saluted
as "Texas' hottest downtown" by Texas Monthly magazine. It was hit by
tornadoes two years ago that caused about $500 million in damage. The
heavily damaged 35-story Bank One building still stands, its windows
and doors shuttered. The building once housed offices and the Reata
Restaurant, a local favorite that popularized the term "upscale
cowboy cuisine." The Reata has relocated nearby; its tortilla soup
and beef dishes are standouts.</TE>
<TE>   We stayed in the downtown district at the moderately priced
Renaissance Worthington, a 12-story, 504-room hotel with spacious,
nicely furnished rooms and a well-equipped exercise room and indoor
pool. Nearby hotels range from the luxurious 38-room Ashton, with
down pillows, comforters and Frette linens, to a Courtyard by
Marriott, with simple rooms and weekend rates of less than $100 a
night.</TE>
<TE>   Fort Worth's main tourist districts are its downtown; the cultural
district, home to the city's major museums; and Stockyards Station, a
national historic district where visitors can get a realistic taste
of the Old West.</TE>
<TE>   From 1867 to 1872, more than 3 million head of cattle were driven
up the Chisholm Trail from Fort Worth to Abilene, Kan. The drives are
reenacted twice daily in the stockyards district. The cowboys are on
the city payroll; so are the longhorns, which receive chow and a
comfortable corral for their efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Like many visitors, we took a walking tour of the area, stopped by
the Stockyards Hotel (where bank robbers Bonnie and Clyde were once
guests) and shopped in stores where we could buy a pair of
silver-trimmed spurs for $42.95 or ostrich hide boots for $895.</TE>
<TE>   Our next stockyards stop was the Cattlemen's Steakhouse, a local
institution where we saw '50s-era photos of blue-ribbon steers on the
wall and were served thick and juicy charbroiled steaks. Another good
place to dine in the district is Joe T. Garcia's, also an
institution. Garcia's can seat 1,600 at its sprawling indoor-outdoor
Tex-Mex restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Diners have two choices: fajitas ($10.50) or a huge enchilada-taco
plate ($9.25). We were seated next to Ando, the Modern's architect,
the night we visited, and he seemed to enjoy his food as much as we
enjoyed ours.</TE>
<TE>   From haute to honky-tonk</TE>
<TE>   There's much to do in the daytime in the stockyards district, but
the area really comes alive at night. Saloons and clubs line Exchange
Street, the main drag. And then, of course, there's Billy Bob's
Texas, a nightclub/bull-riding venue/honky-tonk. We moseyed down to
Billy Bob's our first night in town. Covering 100,000 square feet,
the club is so huge that it holds an indoor rodeo arena, a dance
floor, restaurants, a showroom, bars, a saloon and a dry goods store.</TE>
<TE>   Out on the dance floor, we saw women with straight hair, tight
jeans and tall boots gracefully two-stepping with men in western
hats, plaid shirts and equally tight jeans. Above their heads, a
mirrored saddle turned slowly, throwing slivers of light across the
room. "That works better for us than a mirrored ball," said manager
Marty Travis. The saddle is a prop from "Rhinestone," a 1984 film
with Dolly Parton and Sylvester Stallone.</TE>
<TE>   If you get to Billy Bob's before the main act -- Willie Nelson was
there when we visited -- you can stop by the arena to watch
professional rodeo cowboys participate in bull riding, often called
the world's most dangerous sport. The action is explosive and
breathtaking.</TE>
<TE>   Between riders, I chatted with cowboy Kent Cox, 31, a retired bull
rider who lost an eye some years ago when a bull crushed the side of
his face, requiring five surgeries and 13 aluminum plates. "I miss it
sometimes," he said nostalgically.</TE>
<TE>   Rodeo is a highlight for many Fort Worth visitors. There are
championship competitions, including barrel racing, bronc riding and
calf roping, Fridays and Saturdays at the indoor Cowtown Coliseum in
the stockyards district. Major equestrian competitions, such as the
Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo (Jan. 11 to Feb. 7), are held across
town at Will Rogers Memorial Center in the cultural district.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the cultural district has horses.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the fine things about our city," said Harman of the
convention bureau. "One moment you can be in Kimbell Museum and the
next moment you can walk across the street and see a cutting-horse
show."</TE>
<TE>   We spent two days exploring the cultural district's museums and
could have spent more. Jorden, an avid collector, was particularly
interested in the Modern's works. Nearly 100 pieces, estimated at $40
million to $60 million, were acquired for the opening.</TE>
<TE>   The 153,000-square-foot glass-and-concrete building seems to float
on the large reflecting pool it faces. Diffused or deflected light is
everywhere. This first large-scale U.S. commission for architect Ando
is a work of art on its own.</TE>
<TE>   I asked chief curator Michael Auping for a list of the five crown
jewels of the collection. He began with "Vortex 2002," a soaring
230-ton steel sculpture by Richard Serra.</TE>
<TE>   The 67-foot-tall work stands outside, at the southwest corner of
the museum. He also mentioned Andy Warhol's "Twenty-five Colored
Marilyns," Francis Bacon's "Self-Portrait," Anselm Kiefer's
"Quaternity" and Gerhard Richter's "Seascape."</TE>
<TE>   Much as I enjoyed the Modern, another stop in the district also
left a lasting impression: the wild and woolly Cowgirl Museum and
National Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   The three main galleries in this light-filled building are devoted
to ranch women; Hollywood types, such as Dale Evans and Barbara
Stanwyck; and champion cowgirls, from shooting ace Annie Oakley to
jockey Julie Krone, who won the Belmont Stakes in 1993 to become the
first woman to win a Triple Crown race. There are trick riders and
ropers, country crooners and lots of glitzy costumes and props.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a host of fun interactive exhibits. Kids -- or adults
-- can saddle a horse, interview a cowgirl via an interactive
computer or become the star in a Wild West movie poster.</TE>
<TE>   If you're really bold, you can ride a bronc in a rodeo and be
filmed doing it. The museum posts your film on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   OK, it's not a real bronc; it's mechanical. And you're not really
in a rodeo. It's rodeo footage playing on a screen behind you. But
the filming part is true.</TE>
<TE>   Yeehaw. I'm an Internet rodeo cowgirl. And richer, too, for the
museums I visited.</TE>

<HD>Volcanic vistas near San Luis Obispo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John McKinney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cerro San Luis may be steep, but the path to the summit rewards
hikers with views of the coast, San Luis Obispo and the surrounding
countryside.</LD>
<LD>   Proud locals say "our mountain" when referring to the peak, also
called San Luis Mountain or Cerro San Luis Obispo. They are among the
few who seem to know the meaning of the large "M" perched on the
eastern slope.</LD>
<LD>   The "M" is not for the nearby Madonna Inn or the Madonna family,
big property holders in these parts and owners of most of the
mountain, as I figured. Nor is the "M" an advertisement for
McDonald's, as my children guessed. The letter stands for nearby
Mission College Prep High School.</LD>
<TE>   Another M-word to remember is morro. Cerro San Luis is one of nine
morros, or peaks, that extend from Morro Bay to San Luis Obispo. They
are remnants of volcanoes that were active 20 million years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997 the city of San Luis Obispo acquired land and trail access
on the lower slope of the mountain for an open-space preserve. Though
rangers warn the climb atop 1,292-foot Cerro San Luis intrudes on
private land, the trek remains a popular workout, particularly among
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo students.</TE>
<TE>   To reach the trail head, drivers heading north from Los Angeles
will exit U.S. 101 at Marsh Street in downtown San Luis Obispo.
Almost immediately, turn left onto Carmel Street. Go a block and turn
left onto Higuera Street.</TE>
<TE>   Follow Higuera until you're just short of the onramp for
southbound 101. Turn right onto a paved road, which leads to the
signed Charles A. and May R. Maino Open Space. Parking is near the
gated trail.</TE>
<TE>   The path is a dirt road, wide in most places, though it
occasionally narrows considerably. When dry the adobe surface is
cement-hard, but after a good rain it's as slippery as soap.</TE>
<TE>   Begin by squeezing through a narrow wooden stile. Large clusters
of prickly pear cactus and a few magnificent pepper trees line the
road. Curving and climbing west, the trail will look down on Laguna
Lake and across to Bishop Peak, at 1,559 feet the highest of the
morros.</TE>
<TE>   The path splits near the summit. Both forks lead to a wooden
platform just below the peak. Some easy rock climbing leads to
fabulous panoramas at the top.</TE>
<TE>   An optional side trip is 2.2-mile Lemon Grove Loop, which branches
off Cerro San Luis Trail. Lemon Grove Loop is on the mountain's
eastern slope overlooking downtown San Luis Obispo and the Santa
Lucia Mountains. The trail leads to giant eucalyptus, reaches the
edge of the Maino Open Space, then passes the trail's namesake citrus
grove before reconnecting with Cerro San Luis Trail.</TE>

<LD>Your cruise liner may look shipshape, but what about bacteria and
viruses, dangers you can't see? Is anyone monitoring those?</LD>
<LD>   It's a natural question considering the string of cruise ships
that have limped into port in recent weeks, each carrying dozens of
people sickened with gastrointestinal illness. Ships run by Disney,
Holland America, Carnival and Britain's P&amp;O Cruises are among those
that have collectively reported hundreds of cases of the illness,
which typically causes vomiting and diarrhea and lasts one to three
days.</LD>
<LD>   Cruise sanitation is stringently monitored, but even the strictest
on-board regimen cannot prevent all outbreaks, especially those
caused by viruses.</LD>
<TE>   "You're never going to get rid of them," Dr. Frederick Southwick,
chief of infectious diseases at the University of Florida College of
Medicine, says of such outbreaks. He calls a ship the "perfect
vehicle" for transmitting the so-called Norwalk-like virus, suspected
in the most recent cases.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got a large number of people in a small environment," he
says. The virus spreads rapidly by person-to-person contact.
Typically, you get infected when you touch an infected surface, then
your mouth. Just one ill person on board can infect many other
passengers, he says.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government and the cruise lines, in a cooperative
program of inspections and investigations run by the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, have been trying for three
decades to eliminate gastrointestinal outbreaks aboard cruise ships.
They can claim considerable progress.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, when ship inspections began, there were 12 to 15
outbreaks of diarrheal illness each year aboard cruise ships, the CDC
says, attributed to various causes. The number fell steadily; in 1999
there were only three outbreaks.</TE>
<TE>   This decrease occurred even though the number of North Americans
taking a cruise quadrupled from 1981 to 1999, to 5.9 million per
year, according to Cruise Lines International Assn., which represents
about 95% of the berths marketed in the U.S. and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Early data show that the per-passenger rate of such outbreaks is
actually decreasing, says Dave Forney, chief of the CDC's vessel
sanitation program, although CDC statistics from 2000 to 2002 were
not available as of the Travel section's press time Tuesday. Recent
outbreaks reported by Holland America, Disney and Carnival affected
about 10% or fewer of passengers.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC program requires ships to report all gastrointestinal
cases. An outbreak that affects 2% or more of those aboard typically
triggers a CDC investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Also under the program, CDC staff twice a year inspect each
passenger ship that has an international itinerary, calls on a U.S.
port and carries 13 or more passengers. There are 154 ships on this
roster, counting all the major cruise lines and some minor ones.
Owners pay a fee, based on their ship's tonnage, to finance the
program. (Ships that sail only domestically, such as the Delta Queen,
are under jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration.)</TE>
<TE>   The inspectors arrive unannounced. Depending on the size of the
vessel, up to four may be assigned, and the inspection may take up to
eight hours.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an extremely stressful day for most cruise ships," Forney
says.</TE>
<TE>   The program's operations manual sets detailed standards for water
systems, food handling, swimming pools and spas. During inspections,
each of 41 criteria, with labels such as "hands washed; hygienic
practices," is assigned 1 to 5 points, totaling 100. Points are
deducted for violations.</TE>
<TE>   It's a hands-on task. "We take out the thermometer and check the
buffet," Forney says.</TE>
<TE>   Ships must score 86 or higher to pass. If they don't, they can
request a reinspection after taking steps to correct the problems.</TE>
<TE>   Most ships work hard to pass the inspections, and most succeed.
The scores are posted on the Internet at www.cdc.gov/travel. (Click
on "green sheets" under "Cruise Ships and Air Travel.") Only four
ships on the current list failed.</TE>
<TE>   I suspect most home kitchens wouldn't pass these tests. I know
mine wouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   A review of recent CDC reports shows that scores may be imperiled
because of "old food residue ... in the corner of dairy cooler," "cut
cheese was not date-labeled" or "the blade assembly of the can opener
was not easily cleanable."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, some violations were egregious, such as kitchen
workers "observed handling soiled equipment and then handling clean
equipment without washing their hands first" and food in a
refrigerator registering up to 54 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   During inspections before their recent disease outbreaks, Holland
America's Amsterdam scored 96 (in June), Disney's Magic scored 99 (in
June), Carnival's Fascination scored 93 (in July) and P&amp;O Cruises'
Oceana scored 95 (on Nov. 29).</TE>
<TE>   "We have not identified any problems with food handling or the
water," Forney said of the CDC's subsequent investigations of the
Amsterdam and Magic; reports were pending on the others.</TE>
<TE>   That is part of the dilemma. Much of the CDC twice-yearly
inspection focuses on practices that may promote bacterial growth,
such as poor refrigeration, although some of its standards, such as
hand-washing and sanitizing food surfaces, may help reduce the number
of viruses too, Southwick says.</TE>
<TE>   Yet most gastrointestinal illnesses are believed to be caused by
viruses, not bacteria. The Norwalk-like virus is hardy, resisting
heat and most chlorine compounds, and is "very hard to find," says
Southwick of the University of Florida College of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   He notes that countless Americans who have never stepped on a ship
are made ill each year by the very common Norwalk-like virus.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the cruise lines, however, they aren't required to report
it.</TE>

<HD>Help the time pass swiftly on holiday travels</HD>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're worried about that upcoming holiday trip with the kids, you
need some strategies for making that typically awful time on the
road, in the sky and away from home more tolerable, possibly more
fun, even during the busiest travel weeks of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Comfort is everything, especially in the car. Along with pillows,
water bottles and snacks, monogrammed fleece blankets for kids will
keep them warm and eliminate fights over whose blanket is whose.
Lands' End has Polartec Aircore throws in a dozen colors for $29
each, plus $5 for the monogram.</LD>
<LD>   Order by Friday if you want them in time for Christmas. Call (800)
345-3696 or visit www.landsend.com/cd/frontdoor.</LD>
<TE>   New toys and books are always a hit, particularly if they have
something to do with the place you're visiting. For example, Matchbox
has a vehicle for each of the 50 states, complete with a mini-license
plate. You might want to get the kids one for each state you'll
travel through, perhaps a vintage convertible with a surf-shop logo
for California or a tow truck for New York. Take a look at the
collection at www.matchbox.com/ 50thbirthday.</TE>
<TE>   Fans of the historic American Girl dolls and books will stay busy
in the car with the interactive book "Molly's Route 66 Adventure," as
Molly and her family make their way from Chicago to Los Angeles after
her dad returns from World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Those heading off on a holiday cruise might want to compare
today's megaships to the ship on which wealthy Samantha Parkington
sailed to England in 1904 with her family in "Samantha's Ocean Liner
Adventure." The eight pullout souvenirs in each book (including
Samantha's mask from the captain's ball and Molly's mini map of Route
66) are bound to be a hit. The books are available at most bookstores
and can also be purchased at www.americangirl.com.</TE>
<TE>   The National Geographic book "Dive!" is a great introduction to
scuba diving for kids heading to the beach. Younger kids will enjoy
National Geographic's "My First Pocket Guide: Seashore Life," which
is full of big pictures of critters like fiddler and hermit crabs,
sea urchins and coral, with "field notes" on where to find them and
what to look for.</TE>
<TE>   To nurture your young explorer's interest in faraway places, pick
up a copy of the newly designed magazine National Geographic for
Kids, which is available on newsstands and by subscription -- 10
issues for $17.94. And you can download puzzles, games and stories
from www.nationalgeographic.com to take along on your trip.</TE>
<TE>   The kids will stop complaining about that traffic jam when you
toss them the hand-held electronic game Rush Hour, which retails for
$14.99. The 1,200 puzzles and five skill levels should keep them busy
for a while. Rush Hour is made by Radica USA and is available at most
toy stores and on Web sites like www.amazon.com.</TE>
<TE>   Kids who want to keep reading or playing games in the car after
dark will love the Princeton Tec Aurora Headlamp from L.L. Bean. It
provides 160 hours of light with just one set of batteries. The
decrease in whining will make the $29 seem like a bargain. Call (800)
221-4221 or visit www.llbean.com.</TE>
<TE>   Because the holidays are supposed to be about family time, see if
you can get the kids to turn off their CD players and Game Boys for a
while in the car -- at least long enough to listen to a book on tape.
It's the traveling family's version of gathering by the fire for a
story.</TE>
<TE>   In a collection that should please kids, Broadway veteran Jim Dale
reads the Harry Potter tales. With anywhere from seven CDs ("Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone") to 17 ("Harry Potter and the Goblet
of Fire"), they should keep the kids and you entertained even if you
have to cross three states to get to Grandma's house.</TE>
<TE>   Younger grade-schoolers are guaranteed to like Judy Blume's
"Double Fudge," the latest in the series about a little boy nicknamed
Fudge and his family. Kids from divorced or blended families might
enjoy the audio version of Rachel Cohn's "The Steps," about a girl's
holiday visit to her father's new family. These titles are all
available from the Listening Library, www.listeninglibrary.com. Check
your local library and video store for other favorite stories on CD
or tape.</TE>
<TE>   If that book-on-tape idea is greeted with a groan, try talking.
Time stuck in a car or plane might be the best gift you can give the
kids -- a few hours with nothing else to do but focus on them and
what's happening in their lives. Best of all, they can't tune you out
by leaving the room.</TE>

<LD>Regarding the Dec. 8 Weekend Escape, "Slip-Sliding Away in Regal
Kings Canyon": Two years ago, a friend and I stayed in the main lodge
at the Montecito-Sequoia Resort and found everything but the skiing a
disappointment.</LD>
<LD>   Our room had a very small window, stained and threadbare carpet,
mismatched dorm-style furniture and filthy blankets. Housekeepers
dropped off fresh towels daily, but didn't clean the bathroom or make
the beds.</LD>
<LD>   Food was on par with that of a camp. Resort and Forest Service
staff occupied dining hall tables while guests were left without
seats. One morning, empty beer bottles and wineglasses from the night
before remained on tables while guests ate breakfast.</LD>
<TE>   My friend and other guests who signed up for lessons waited 20
minutes in a blizzard before finding an instructor, who said the
lesson was canceled because it was snowing too hard.</TE>
<TE>   For $300 per person for a two-day stay, we expected more.</TE>

<LD>Buying airline tickets free on the Web is becoming a thing of the
past.</LD>
<LD>   Internet travel seller Expedia recently began charging a $5
booking fee for airline tickets.</LD>
<LD>   Rival Travelocity plans to match the move next year. The
airline-owned Orbitz site first imposed a fee in December 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The fee for Expedia, www.expedia.com, is designed to help the site
"maintain the high quality of service" despite reductions in airline
commissions, a spokeswoman said. The $5 charge is waived when the
ticket is part of a travel package.</TE>
<TE>   Travelocity, www.travelocity.com, will start charging up to $5 per
ticket in early 2003, said spokesman Al Comeaux. He declined to be
more specific.</TE>
<TE>   He said the fee "will help us accelerate innovation ... and
provide even better consumer offers."</TE>
<TE>   Orbitz, www.orbitz.com, charges a $5 booking fee for tickets from
airlines that pay it a fee or commission and $10 for all other
airlines. When Orbitz first imposed fees, Expedia criticized the move
as anti-consumer.</TE>

<TE>   United Airlines will honor its agreements on code shares,
frequent-flier miles and lounge access with 13 foreign partner
airlines, despite filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last
week, the Star Alliance announced. United said it will operate while
it develops a plan, expected to involve reducing routes, to pay
creditors.... The State Department on Dec. 6 warned Americans to
defer nonessential travel to Venezuela. It said it is "gravely
concerned" about possible escalation of political unrest.... New York

<LD>This cruise has a pace a New Yorker would love: four Florida and
Caribbean ports in seven days, round trip from the Big Apple.</LD>
<LD>   At least that's what Norwegian Cruise Line hopes as it rolls out
the unusual itinerary for its newest ship, the Norwegian Dawn,
scheduled to begin sailing Saturday from Miami after inaugural
festivities Monday in New York.</LD>
<LD>   The 2,224-passenger Dawn, a sister ship to the line's Norwegian
Star, can reach speeds up to 25 knots, allowing it to make the
whirlwind round trip in seven days. It will begin with traditional
seven-day Caribbean cruises out of Miami in winter, then switch to
the New York round trips for the summer and fall season, starting in
May.</LD>
<TE>   From New York there will be four ports of call: Nassau and Great
Stirrup Cay, the cruise line's private island, in the Bahamas; and
Miami and Port Canaveral, Fla. One downside, at least for those who
don't love on-board life, is that cruisers spend nearly two days at
sea at the start of the outbound leg from New York to the Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if you're staying in one of the ship's two Garden Villa
suites, for $26,000 a week, you might not mind. Billed by Norwegian
as the largest afloat, each has more than 5,300 square feet of space,
with three bedrooms, floor-to-ceiling windows, terraces, a Jacuzzi
and a private dining room with butler service. The Dawn has 10
restaurants, an array of sports, from basketball to soccer, a Mandara
spa, a movie theater and children's programs. Original paintings by
Van Gogh, Matisse, Monet and Renoir adorn one restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Fares begin at $599 per person, double occupancy, for the
seven-day Caribbean itinerary and $799 for the New York-Bahamas round
trip. (800) 327-7030, www.ncl.com.</TE>
<TE>   In another debut, Holland America Line on Saturday was to christen
the Zuiderdam, the first of five sister ships it calls Vista-class
vessels, the largest ever built for the line. The 1,848-passenger
ship will sail weekly Caribbean itineraries from Fort Lauderdale,
Fla. Fares begin at $859 per person, double occupancy. (877)
724-5425, www.hollandamerica.com.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Tourists by the millions wend their way across the
waterways of Brugge, Belgium, one of Europe's best-preserved medieval
cities. They find daffodils in spring and enjoy the glorious colors
of summer and fall. But as Marina del Rey reader Tracy M. Lowe
discovered two years ago, Brugge can be twice as nice in winter when
snowy scenes are reflected in the canals. She took pictures in Venice
too, but says Lowe, "I liked Brugge better."</CP>

<KH>HER WORLD</KH>
<HD>To enjoy France, say au revoir to those American
stereotypes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Spano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Travel tests stereotypes we hold about other people. This is
especially true when Americans go to France, with its proud history,
culture and traditions. Some lap it up, but others return home
horrified and hurt by what they perceive as the rudeness, deviousness
and hypocrisy of the French.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, exposure to tourists from the U.S. often
confirms the French assessment of Americans as self-indulgent,
tactless and simple-minded.</LD>
<LD>   Few people better understand the way true and false cliches come
into play when Americans visit France than Diane Johnson, author of
"Le Divorce" (Dutton, 1997) and "Le Mariage" (Dutton, 2000). (A movie
version of "Le Divorce" is due out next year. Johnson's next novel,
also set in France, is expected at the end of 2003.)</LD>
<TE>   These deliciously funny novels about how the two cultures butt
heads in the streets, patisseries, cafes and bedrooms of Paris are
the products of Johnson's close observation. She's a San Franciscan
who has lived part time in the City of Light for the last seven
years.</TE>
<TE>   I recently talked with Johnson by telephone. Here are some of the
highlights of our tete-a-tete:</TE>
<TE>   Question: Why do Americans love France?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: We're taught that it is the perfect America, without
puritanism. The food is great. Luxury and beauty are valued.</TE>
<TE>   Q. How did you find it when you first went?</TE>
<TE>   A. It was 1980, and my husband [John Murray, a professor of
medicine] wanted to take a sabbatical someplace where he had to learn
a new language. I didn't speak a word of French until the end of the
year. But I had a positive experience and completely blamed myself
for not speaking the language.</TE>
<TE>   Q. How did the French treat you?</TE>
<TE>   A. Everyone was nice. Now, most Americans find the French much
nicer than they expected. And people who started going there in the
'50s say they are nicer. They have gotten better, maybe because of
prosperity, television, travel. The French go everywhere. When they
visit America they are prepared to find things charming and
picturesque that seem gross to us. They think Las Vegas is fabulous,
though they wouldn't want it in France.</TE>
<TE>   We once lent our house in Tahoe to French friends. Afterward, we
saw in the refrigerator what they'd been eating: Wonder bread. Can
you believe it? They were trying to eat the local bread.</TE>
<TE>   Q. So perhaps some of the common cliches we hold about the French
aren't true?</TE>
<TE>   A. Well, the French are not at all hedonistic; they're almost
puritanical about things like food, which they understand as an
important part of life. You can't just throw food on the table. It
should be done well.</TE>
<TE>   And there's the myth people still believe about the lack of
cleanliness in France, maybe from going to the toilet in a brasserie.
Americans consider it a sign of the nation's backwardness.</TE>
<TE>   Q. What about the rudeness of the French? It seems the friendlier
you are to them, the meaner they treat you.</TE>
<TE>   A. They absolutely think we smile too much. It makes us seem
simple and uncultivated. At the moment I start getting indignant over
this, I hear an American in the Louvre saying something stupid like,
"Oh, they have elevators here."</TE>
<TE>   Q. As a part-time expatriate, do you sympathize more with the
French now?</TE>
<TE>   A. Maybe I am getting compromised, but I have begun to see the
advantages of some of their behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't we love to know how they eat without getting fat? It
isn't bulimia. They eat fewer carbohydrates and smaller portions.
When I order the same thing in the U.S., I get twice as much. I dread
that huge heaping plate.</TE>
<TE>   Q. Your novels are full of beautiful French women wearing cleverly
tied scarves. Have you figured that out yet?</TE>
<TE>   A. A French woman once showed me how to fold a scarf, but you'd
have to be an origami expert to do it right.</TE>
<TE>   Q. With their scarves and high heels, are French women oppressed?</TE>
<TE>   A. I believe they haven't needed feminism per se. They have a much
higher, less problematic status than American women. It's normal for
them to work. French men are interested in what they do, in things
like cooking and clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Q. Don't the French play around a lot?</TE>
<TE>   A. French women say French men are horrible cads, but they have a
more relaxed philosophy about adultery. There's also more toleration
of flirting.</TE>
<TE>   If an American man said to a female colleague, "You're looking
pretty today," it would be taken amiss.</TE>
<TE>   Q. In "Le Divorce" the narrator says Americans abroad have a
"slightly toxic chemistry." Where does it come from?</TE>
<TE>   A. A certain rigidity is involved that makes people have trouble
in France. You have to be prepared to give up some of your cultural
expectations and accept things on their own terms.</TE>
<TE>   Q. Do you have any tips for travelers to France?</TE>
<TE>   A. Be more polite than usual. Even little things like saying
"please" and "thank you" smooth the way. Don't just walk into a
store, look around and leave. Say bonjour and au revoir.</TE>
<TE>   Q. Is there anything about France you just can't stomach?</TE>
<TE>   A. I never order andouille [sausage made of pig intestines]. At
first I tried to be a good sport about eating it but eventually
realized that it wasn't going to happen.</TE>

<HD>The accidental treasures of Venice</HD>
<DH>Away from the crowds, the quieter squares of the city lead
to great surprises. Fine art fills even the littlest of its 100-plus
churches.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Madeline King Porter</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Venice, Italy</DL>
<LD>When I went through customs on my return from Venice, I had nothing
to declare, no glass, no lace, no gondolier's striped shirt or straw
hat.</LD>
<LD>   But I brought back something surprising, especially for a person
without much religion: a love for the churches of the Serenissima,
for the public squares in which they stand so majestically, for the
islands they dominate and the canals they illuminate, for their quiet
dignity and their flamboyant style, for their femininity and their
muscle, their silence that demands whispers and their resounding
bells that necessitate shouts.</LD>
<LD>   Every church in Venice is a work of art, and because the city
never was dominated by Rome, it practiced its own kind of faith, led
by its doges (dukes) and patricians (nobles) -- and the painters,
sculptors and architects hired to honor them. The stunning results
have brought joy to untold millions. Granted, there's also much to
see along the winding canals and in the museums, palaces and shops.
But Venice is about churches. And the best ones are those that catch
you unaware, that you never planned to visit and that may not even be
included in the guidebooks.</LD>
<TE>   My trip was filled with those kinds of churches, and it was over
before I realized there wasn't time to see any more and there never
would be time to see them all. But my favorites will always be with
me. And for that I can thank my friend Chris.</TE>
<TE>   Chris has the good sense, and the good fortune, to divide his time
between New York City and Venice, where he happened to be during the
first couple of days of my October visit. It began, as all good
visits should, with an antipasto. We were at Corte Sconta, Chris'
favorite restaurant, dining on a dish that included baby clams,
spider crabs and just about every other creature in the sea. As we
sipped white wine, two American women were seated at the next table.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have to go to that church," one of them said.</TE>
<TE>   "What church?" the other asked.</TE>
<TE>   "That one in the big square."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, she meant the Basilica of San Marco, the most famous
church in Venice, a Byzantine wonder with its layers of gold,
alabaster and marble. I knew she was right. Everyone should go there,
along with the Doges' Palace and the Accademia museum. It was one of
the few must-see items on my list. Chris agreed; he just wouldn't go
with me.</TE>
<TE>   After lunch we strolled through the Castello area of the city,
passing a quiet little campo (square). At one end was a simple brick
church. On my own, if I'd noticed it at all, I would have judged it
pretty -- if plain -- and kept on going.</TE>
<TE>   But I was with a fan of all things Gothic. "This is a must-see,"
Chris said, and I followed him into San Giovanni in Bragora. At first
I was surprised by the intimacy of the little church. Then I was
stunned by the sheer beauty of its art. I remember thinking that if a
church I'd never even heard of could be this impressive, maybe I
should have a look at a couple of others.</TE>
<TE>   Over the altar was Cima da Conegliano's "Baptism of Christ,"
realistic in every detail. The painting "Christ Resurrected" by
Alvise Vivarini was markedly different from the style of the period,
with foreshortened figures of youthful soldiers and a bemused Christ.
And a painting by Palma Giovane, "The Washing of the Feet," had a
moody, almost angry feeling -- not at all what I would have expected.
But then nothing in the church was what I'd expected.</TE>
<TE>   In case I thought San Giovanni in Bragora was an anomaly, Chris
reminded me that there are 105 other churches in Venice, all with
something to recommend them. I took it as a challenge. But instead of
searching them out, I decided to wing it. And that's how I found my
"accidental" churches.</TE>
<TE>   A fascinating pastiche</TE>
<TE>   I almost backed into the first one while trying to snap a long
shot of the Arsenal, once the great shipbuilding center of Venice.
When I turned around, there was San Martino, dominating its little
campo, not quite sure of its style. And for good reason: San Martino
was designed by Jacopo Sansovino (middle Renaissance) in the shape of
a Greek cross (Byzantine), incorporating tracings on the main window
(Gothic) that were a nod to his mentor Codussi (early Renaissance),
with a trompe l'oeil ceiling above walls hung with 18th century
paintings. Whew. That's about every style out there, but San Martino
was a poor parish, built over time, and with the passing of each era,
art and architecture changed.</TE>
<TE>   The guidebooks that mention San Martino give it short shrift, and
while it was meant to be the final resting place of Doge Francesco
Erizzo, he requested that his heart be buried in the Basilica of San
Marco, so I guess even he had mixed feelings about the church where
the rest of his body is entombed. But tucked away inside are four
carved angels by the great sculptor Tullio Lombardo. His work is
found throughout Venice, but it's worth a visit to San Martino just
for those angels.</TE>
<TE>   Only three of Sansovino's churches remain, the others destroyed in
various battles. I discovered San Francesco della Vigna one day when
I got lost. The simple white nave with its gray marble columns exudes
a rich Tuscan dignity while retaining the asceticism of the
Franciscans cloistered there, for whom Sansovino designed the church.
One of the monks let me into the courtyard, which is rundown but
elevated by a beautiful statue of St. Francis.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, I found Giovanni Bellini's "Madonna and Child With
Saints," with its poignantly lovely Mary and pale and wistful St.
Sebastian. But the painting paled beside the Giovanni Battista
Tiepolo ceiling, festooned with elaborate carved garlands, that
crowns one of the side chapels. I stood in awe beneath it, along with
the other visitors -- half a dozen of us -- privileged to have
discovered this jewel of a church.</TE>
<TE>   I seemed to be on a roll. The sun was barely up the next day when
I found my way to a campo in the center of the San Marco district.
Overlooking it was Santa Maria Formosa, another Renaissance church,
designed by Codussi the year that Columbus discovered America. Inside
is a vividly restored polyptych of "St. Barbara and Saints" by Palma
Vecchio and a triptych by Bartolomeo Vivarini, "Madonna of Mercy."</TE>
<TE>   Tintoretto's stamping ground</TE>
<TE>   Hardly anyone visiting Venice, even for an extended stay, finds
time to explore Cannaregio, the city's own suburbia. Its wide canal
cuts through neighborhoods where clothes are hung on lines above
narrow streets and the family motorboat is docked outside for the
commute to work. I would have missed it too, except that Chris
suggested I might want to see a church there.</TE>
<TE>   The area is easy to reach, just a 10-minute walk from the
vaporetto stop to the church of the Madonna dell'Orto. And the
streets are virtually devoid of sightseers, even in Campo dei Mori,
where Tintoretto spent most of his life. Who could blame him? His
house is one of the most charming in Venice. The nearby Madonna
dell'Orto is filled with Tintorettos, including "Adoration of the
Golden Calf," in which the artist appears as one of the men carrying
the idol, and "Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple," among his
most renowned paintings. His "Last Judgment" is a vivid, even
violent, painting.</TE>
<TE>   I crowded onto the No. 12 boat one cool and sunny morning bound
for the basilica at Torcello, the oldest church in the Venetian
lagoon and one of its most visited. On the way, the boat stopped at
the island of Burano, known for its brightly painted houses and
handmade lace. I piled off with the other passengers, checked out the
colorful houses and gave a perfunctory nod to the local church, where
even the women sweeping the floor looked as if they would rather be
somewhere else. Then I decided to go exploring during the long wait
for the next boat. That's how I found another wonderful church.</TE>
<TE>   A footbridge connects Burano to the island of Mazzorbo. I headed
for the distant campanile, but when I arrived at the church, I found
it closed. As I turned to leave, however, the parish priest appeared
from the side door and kindly let me have a look.</TE>
<TE>   Mazzorbo was once a major port, but there's not much left now but
a couple of villas and the Roman-Gothic church of Santa Caterina,
which dates from 1283, small and lovely with a wooden ceiling and a
number of interesting paintings. One of them, a somewhat foreboding
but interesting "Baptism of Christ" by Giuseppe Salviati, held my
attention. I later discovered that Salviati was a 16th century artist
influenced by Titian.</TE>
<TE>   It's a long boat ride to Santa Caterina, but it's only five
minutes by vaporetto from Venice's San Marco landing to the island of
San Giorgio, which is dominated by the dream church of painters
through the centuries: San Giorgio Maggiore. Those who can't paint
can point cameras, always from across the water. It's amazing how few
people actually make the short boat trip to have a look inside at the
altar, with huge bronze figures of angels, and a golden globe held by
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. I never expected I would take the boat
to San Giorgio Maggiore. In fact, the last thing I expected to do in
Venice was spend most of my waking hours in churches, but having done
it, I highly recommend the experience.</TE>
<TE>   And thanks, Chris.</TE>

<HD>'Teenage Faust' Horns In on an Old Tale</HD>
<DH>The devil is up to his tricks in a modern take on good and
evil, desire and destiny at an Indiana high school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Faust legend, about a man who sells his soul to the devil for
riches and fame, has tempted audiences over the centuries in various
incarnations, including Christopher Marlowe's 16th century play "Dr.
Faustus," the Broadway musical "Damn Yankees" and even the Disney
comedy "The Devil and Max Devlin." The latest twist on the oft-told
tale is the Showtime family comedy "I Was a Teenage Faust,"
premiering Sunday on the cable network.</LD>
<LD>   In this version, a nerdy Indiana teenager named Brendan (Josh
Zuckerman) is at the end of his rope, having just lost a student
council election to a dog. To add insult to injury, he has fallen in
love with Twyla Day (Caroline Elliott), a teen model who is about to
leave town to become a star in New York. Before she departs, though,
she's going to throw a party at the country club.</LD>
<LD>   Brendan knows he doesn't have a chance in you-know-where of being
invited. That is until the fast-talking Mr. Five (Robert Townsend), a
tempter from below, arrives in town looking to sign up a few souls
for his boss, Mephisto (Stuart Margolin).</LD>
<TE>   Writer-director Thom Eberhardt ("Without a Clue") has always been
intrigued by the Faust story. "I was a big 'Twilight Zone' guy when I
was a kid. There were a lot of those type stories on 'Twilight Zone'
and 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents.' I also just like the idea of the
word 'Faust.' "</TE>
<TE>   Showtime was also eager for him to do another kids' film. Two
years ago, Eberhardt wrote and directed the film "Ratz," about two
boys who were turned into rodents. Eberhardt won an Emmy for his
screenplay and turned the story into a bestselling book.</TE>
<TE>   Eberhardt says that both "Ratz" and "Faust" are "lunatic" stories.
"They have their tongue in their cheeks, but not so far as to
interfere with kids enjoying the story. We had so much fun when we
did 'Ratz,' I wanted to do another [kids' comedy] and get even
funkier with it. I started thinking about a deal-with-the-devil
story, and Faust was such a funny word...."</TE>
<TE>   The Faust legend, he says, is timeless because it "asks a moral,
challenging question, which is how far would you go to get what you
want. You can't do much worse than sell your soul to the devil. That
is the challenge. Do you want something so bad that you make that
kind of a deal? It's just a fundamental moral question."</TE>
<TE>   Townsend, who has directed several movies for Showtime, including
"10,000 Black Men Named George," jumped at the chance to play the
bumbling tempter, Mr. Five. "It's a really cute story," he says.
"Thom Eberhardt writes in a unique voice, and he understands kids."</TE>
<TE>   Townsend says Eberhardt took the story of a kid who is not well
liked in school -- "and that's every kid in America who is not the
football star or homecoming queen -- and twisted it. He follows the
classic storytelling but adds another layer to it."</TE>
<TE>   Eberhardt knows about intricacies of the teen world because he is
the father of two daughters.</TE>
<TE>   "I have had teenage girls in the house for the last 10 years, so I
am sort of immersed in it," he says. "Plus, I seem to do my best
writing in a kind of slightly surreal, if not lunatic, sort of
environment. That's the kind of environment young teenagers live in.
It is completely surreal. Things don't make sense to them. And things
that seem obvious to them don't make sense to anybody else."</TE>
<TE>   "I Was a Teenage Faust" can be seen at 8 p.m. Sunday on Showtime.
The network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young
children).</TE>

<LD>Election 2000 in Florida: Could it happen here? -- The title of an
Orange County Grand Jury report completed in the wake of the
controversial 2000 presidential election.</LD>
<LD>   "Uncounted O.C. Ballots Discovered" -- The headline on a recent
story in The Times describing how 7,991 absentee ballots from the
county's Nov. 5 election went missing and were discovered just hours
before the state deadline for certifying election results.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, the lost-and-found ballots didn't change outcomes of
races in Yorba Linda, Anaheim, San Clemente, Westminster or Fountain
Valley. So the county was spared embarrassing mentions on the
national news and serving as fodder for late-night talk show
monologues.</LD>
<TE>   But the county can't breathe easy when it comes to casting future
ballots. The recent breakdown was the latest in a string of
embarrassing miscues, including incorrect sample ballots, mislabeled
candidates and political parties, improper Vietnamese translation,
missing fiscal analyses in voter pamphlets and a shortage of
Spanish-language ballots at some poll locations.</TE>
<TE>   The 2001 grand jury report makes it clear that technology alone
won't prevent problems. Proper training for county staffers and
volunteers is necessary to make elections flow smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors had been planning to review new voting
technology even before the ballots went missing. The board on Tuesday
will discuss three options for replacing the existing system, which
relies on punch cards that are hand-fed into counting machines --
some of which are 30 years old.</TE>
<TE>   The new systems would probably have prevented the misplaced
ballots that marred the Nov. 5 election. But technology also promises
to free up the county's Registration and Voting division's staff to
focus on other problems. Fewer volunteers will be needed to conduct
elections because the machines will allow a consolidation of multiple
precincts into a single location. County workers will be able to
focus their efforts on training volunteers who staff voting booths,
and have more time to ensure that ballots include the right
information. And, because there won't be punch cards, chads and other
opportunities for error, the vote tally should move more smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   Replacing the old system will cost residents about $25 million.
This could be the time to take the plunge, because the county seems
to have funding in line.</TE>
<TE>   The state Voting Modernization Act of 2002 will contribute some of
the needed funds, and county officials expect the incoming
Republican-dominated Congress to make good on a federal pledge to
provide additional money.</TE>
<TE>   The county should revisit the grand jury report in light of the
recent breakdown and ensure that any useful recommendations are being
pursued. Voters who take the time to study the issues deserve to know
that their votes count -- and will be counted in a timely manner.</TE>

<LD>Chapman University President James Doti broke into a grin this month
when a reporter asked him which categories of the state budget should
be spared as Sacramento tries to plug a $21-billion budget hole.
"Higher education," the economist quipped.</LD>
<LD>   Ask board members at the Orange County Transportation Authority
what should be spared and the answer will be transportation funding.
The county's health professionals understandably will rally support
for public health care. The emphatic response at county school
districts will be to protect elementary and secondary education. And
so it will go with every other special interest.</LD>
<LD>   The pain already is being felt in the county.</LD>
<TE>   OCTA's long-awaited expansion of the Garden Grove Freeway is
likely to be delayed because the governor's hit list includes $1.8
billion in transportation project funding, including $174 million
earmarked for the freeway that hasn't had a major upgrade since it
opened 35 years ago. OCTA also faces the loss of $17.5 million for
street improvements around the county and $12 million to rebuild a
heavily used rail corridor that travels through parts of Placentia
and Anaheim. The rail corridor, incidentally, is where three people
died in April when a freight train hit a Metrolink passenger train.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Unified School District recently warned that it might
have to cut as much as $4.5 million from this year's midyear budget.
Bill Bowman, executive director of the Regional Center of Orange
County, used a column in the Dec. 8 edition of The Times to plead
with lawmakers to do the right thing and not cut the budget of the
agency that helps the disabled to lead safe, healthy lives.</TE>
<TE>   Local legislators already are making time to each bash competing
proposals. Republicans are lobbying for more cuts, and Democrats are
pushing equally hard for new taxes. That approach ignores the hard
reality. Legislators must remember that partisan politics won't help
county residents who will be hurt as programs and services are cut.
With that in mind, the local delegation must remember that it was
elected to serve voters, not to use the budget crisis for political
grandstanding.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Planning Department misconstrued building trends,
misspent money on SUVs and computers, and by some accounts misplaced
$18 million. The Board of Supervisors shouldn't reward such bumbling
by letting the department raise fees by a planned 58%. But this board
forked over an $8-million loan to the agency in August without asking
serious questions, so its ability to manage this crisis is in
question. An outside hand is needed.</LD>
<LD>   Taxpayers were kept in the dark until earlier this month when 39
workers were told to expect pink slips. But clues are emerging that
the Planning Department kept increasing its spending in recent years
despite a downturn in building activity. It kept its staff full even
though there wasn't enough work. It bought them a fleet of Ford
Explorers and a $7-million computer system.</LD>
<LD>   The cockamamie rationale: Business would soon pick up. Never mind
the economic downturn, the near build-out of county land and the
ongoing incorporations that are transferring vast swaths of real
estate to cities. The department's lack of proper planning was
evident in a staff-written "trend analysis" that predicted permit
applications would rise last March. "We are not considering any
reductions in staff," the staff wrote.</LD>
<TE>   The public can only hope that the authors of that report were
first in line for layoff.</TE>
<TE>   The department knew its accounts receivable were in for a downturn
because supervisors had lowered building fees a couple of years ago,
after an audit found that the county might have overcharged
developers by $10 million. The county faces a lawsuit over its
building fees, which are not supposed to amount to more than the cost
involved in processing them. The courts might want to have a say in
this latest proposal for a fee increase as well. No one wants to
furlough workers into a slow job market. But the agency's profligate
ways during a time of uncertainty display incompetent management and
blatant disregard for public funds. Any householder knows not to buy
a shiny new SUV and computer when the family income takes a drop. The
department's failure to show similar common sense creates a larger
sense of public mistrust: What other mistakes has this agency been
making in its crucial work of examining development in the county?</TE>
<TE>   And just what were all those public servants doing when there
wasn't enough work to keep them busy? Not shelving books in
short-staffed libraries, that's for sure. Beyond that, the department
may be unable to account for an $18-million reserve that seems to
have gone missing.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors' actions were just as troubling. The board ordered
a financial report on the department's problems, which it received in
September. But it examined the report behind closed doors, failed to
reveal its contents to the public and took no action on it. So it's
time for this sad matter to move into stronger and more transparent
hands.</TE>
<TE>   An $18-million reserve depleted, an $8-million loan nearly used
up, in a county that could squeeze out only $2 million extra this
year for medical services to the poor. Auditor-Controller David
Sundstrom needs to step in with a full independent inquiry before the
county takes any more missteps.</TE>

<LD>Re "O.C. Supervisor Accuses Rival of Trickery," Dec. 4:</LD>
<LD>   Cynthia Coad has an interesting view of the "will of the people."
What makes her think that the 3rd District will of the people would
be to elect a nonresident or carpetbagger to represent them? Does
anyone believe that Tom Coad was really living in that guest house he
rented to qualify for residency?</LD>
<LD>   Ms. Coad has voted against the will of the people on issues such
as the tobacco tax settlement, union labor contracts and El Toro.
When the special elections are held on Jan. 28, we will know who the
3rd District constituents want representing them, and it will not be
the will of the people at the Coad household.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "New Church-Indian Divide," Nov. 27:</LD>
<LD>   On behalf of our Tribal Council, representing many members of the
Juaneno Band of Mission Indians, the Acjachemen Nation, we wish to
thank you for your insightful editorial on our efforts to preserve
the remaining 29 acres of the Putiidhem sacred site.</LD>
<LD>   The site is at the intersection of Camino Capistrano and Junipero
Serra in San Juan Capistrano. The Putiidhem site is the location
proposed by a developer, the Pueblo Serra LLC/JSerra Initiative, to
build a Catholic high school, ironically to be named after Junipero
Serra. As you point out, state law has to date talked much but done
little to protect the rights of the Native Americans, rights that are
easily cognizable but also easily and often conveniently overlooked
in the march for development and profit.</LD>
<TE>   We need more people to recognize the contributions made by Native
Americans and their tribal governments and the respect that should be
given to the original people of California. We also need more people
to recognize that tribal sovereignty is not all about gaming, but
about the protection of fundamental human rights and dignity. Your
editorial is an important step in that direction.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the Catholic Church early on was confronted with a
similar dilemma of disturbing the dead buried on the hills rising
from the river Tiber in Rome at the present site of St. Peter's
Basilica. At that time, only the emperor could permit the basilica to
be built upon Peter's tomb. To this day, Catholics are taught that
the "bodies of the dead must be treated with respect and charity, in
faith and hope of the Resurrection."</TE>
<TE>   Despite this, the Pueblo Serra LLC/JSerra Initiative continues to
push to build a gymnasium, performing arts center and playgrounds on
the Native American burial ground, even as there are other viable
locations in south Orange County that do not require the dead to be
disturbed. The dead at the Acjachemen Putiidhem village site should
be left at rest and undisturbed.</TE>
<TE>   Basic common sense dictates that cemeteries are not playgrounds.</TE>

<HD>Which Retired Teachers Are You Talking About?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Retired Schoolteachers Enjoy Generous Benefits," Dec. 4:</LD>
<LD>   I retired from full-time teaching in 1996 with more than 30 years
of teaching experience. My retirement check each month is
considerably less than 70% of my highest year's earnings. In fact, it
is less than 50% of my final year's salary. I supplement that by
continuing to work, but as a substitute at substantially less per day
than I made as a full-time teacher.</LD>
<LD>   My "attractive" health benefits (paid for by the district from
which I retired) do not include dental or vision coverage. That
monthly payment for insurance stops the day I turn 65.</LD>
<TE>   I wonder if elected officials would be happy with that kind of
retirement package if they had put in 30-plus years on the job. In
addition, if my husband dies before I do, will I get any Social
Security benefits from all the years that he worked and earned Social
Security credits?</TE>
<TE>   Your generalizations about retired teachers are too sweeping. I
know they don't apply to me.</TE>
<TE>   Maggie Bell</TE>
<TE>   Dana Point</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I believe the letter on schoolteachers' benefits omitted a few
pertinent facts.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, recently retired teachers will receive a pension with 70% or
more of their highest salaries after 30 years of teaching; if only
all teachers with that much experience were receiving those benefits.</TE>
<TE>   I and the majority of retired teachers left the profession when
both salaries and percentage for retirement were considerably less.
My retirement, after 25 years, is about half of my salary.</TE>
<TE>   The writer also neglects to mention that teachers contribute 8% of
every paycheck to their retirement, with the school district matching
the amount. In addition, most teachers do not carry their medical
benefits into retirement as the article implied.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bishops to Warn of More Lawsuits," Dec. 3:</LD>
<LD>   The Roman Catholic Church seems to see itself as the victim rather
than the perpetrator. The bishops of the Catholic Church were not
doing their job: Time after time they exposed children to sexual
predators. Now the bishops don't like their authority being
diminished by the law or the church's wallet being punished.</LD>
<LD>   Too bad. The church and bishops should be grateful if these are
the only things that happen.</LD>
<TE>   Without diminishing the pain of the victims, I think this sinful
scandal will produce some great changes that are long overdue: The
Catholic Church will become less patriarchal, and parishioners will
become more involved in the good works of the church. We Catholics
will also become more grateful and supportive of the priests who are
weathering and will survive this scandal, most of whom are men of
extremely good character and sacrifice.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Pressures May Lift O.C. Flight Limits," Dec. 6:</LD>
<LD>   Let me see if I have this straight. For over a decade, we've been
subjected to claims by Newport Beach pro-airport factions that the
now-dead El Toro airport was badly needed because of huge passenger
demand and air cargo needs. Figures of 30 million passengers per year
and tons and tons of air cargo that would have to be handled in
Orange County to keep our economy going were widely circulated and
cited. Those who didn't follow their plans were shortsighted NIMBYs.</LD>
<LD>   Well now, the same Newport Beach groups that made these claims are
negotiating to cap passenger capacity at the county's only airport at
only 75% of its designed capacity and cut the authorized air cargo
flights by 50%.</LD>
<TE>   The pro-airport, special-interest-driven minority from Newport
Beach can't have it both ways. Either there is a looming passenger
capacity shortage and a need for more air cargo handling, or there
isn't. And based on their most recent actions to limit the use of
John Wayne Airport below its designed and authorized levels, it would
appear that they have agreed with the anti-airport majority in this
county and concluded that there clearly isn't a need. Otherwise, we'd
all have to conclude that Newport Beach and its city-funded
pro-airport groups are just myopic, hypocritical NIMBYs who cost the
citizens of this county a decade and tens of millions of dollars
trying in a selfish attempt to improve their own little quality of
life at the expense of their neighbors.</TE>

<TE>   Increasing the capacity of John Wayne Airport beyond its current
physical capacity would be a big mistake for many reasons. But the
hypocrisy of Newport Beach officials regarding this issue is
disgusting.</TE>
<TE>   Now that their 10-year effort to shift the burdens of John Wayne
Airport into their neighbor's backyard has been blocked, Newport
officials are turning their attention to limiting the inevitable need
for growth at John Wayne. The same officials who tried to convince us
of the "need" for a 38-million annual passenger airport at El Toro
are now saying that growth at John Wayne should be limited to 10.8
million passengers per year. If the "need" for new airport capacity
is as strong as Newport officials have claimed, why do they now
propose limits below our airport's physical capacity of 14 million
passengers a year?</TE>
<TE>   The preservation of any limits at John Wayne is highly
questionable. Allan Murphy, the airport director, tells us: "Everyone
wants to make sure ... that we are in compliance with federal law."
Who is kidding whom? Federal law forbids local limits on commercial
flights. Any future set of limits, such as those now being proposed,
will clearly not be in compliance with federal law.</TE>

<LD>Re "Trashed Frat House Puts Hopes on Hold," Dec. 7:</LD>
<LD>   What about the good things in fraternities?</LD>
<LD>   The experience that fraternity members extract from four years in
college is something that has no comparison. Fraternities open so
many opportunities for members to grow as individuals and develop
into successful leaders of society.</LD>
<TE>   Networking, a healthy social life, leadership responsibilities,
service involvement and a real sense of personal achievement and
confidence all derive from fraternities while we are earning our
educational degrees.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sorry that a few members of a single fraternity perpetrated
such a horrible act, but I would hope that an educated outsider would
not base a feeling toward fraternities, or any group, on one event.
What about the other 364 days of the year? Do you actively seek to
find all the good things fraternities provide to their members,
campus and the community?</TE>
<TE>   For instance, did you know that fraternity members are the primary
group contributing money and volunteer time as counselors to send
underprivileged kids to a free summer camp? Or that Greeks raise more
than $30,000 every year for philanthropies and serve community
groups?</TE>
<TE>   I hope that society will approach fraternities with an open mind,
rather than developing beliefs based upon a few terrible acts.</TE>

<LD>Re "Health Safety Net Is Fraying," Dec. 8:</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Marian Bergeson's reasoned, compassionate piece restates what
we have been telling the Board of Supervisors for seven years. The
county is not meeting its legal or moral responsibilities as the
health-care provider of last resort. The Medical Services for
Indigents program is a vital part of the safety net in this county of
almost 3 million, which lacks a county hospital. Currently funded at
a meager $47 million, the program has been serving fewer and fewer
people since the Social Services Agency has been screening patients
for eligibility.</LD>
<LD>   The program is a well-kept secret. Most of the many thousands of
uninsured families and individuals who lack access to necessary
health-care services are unaware that it exists. The county evidently
does not want to publicize MSI because the need is so great that much
more funding would be required if the word got out.</LD>
<TE>   Until we decide as a society to enter the 21st century and provide
health care for all, this county is going to have to change its
priorities, as Bergeson states, and find additional funds for the MSI
program to meet the county's legal obligation, under the California
Welfare and Institutions Code.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bush Picks Rail Exec for Treasury," Dec. 9:</LD>
<LD>   Bush's snow job continues with the appointment of John Snow as
Treasury Secretary.</LD>
<LD>   Surely whomever he appoints to the position is irrelevant. His
aid-to-the-rich program will not lose steam until the public really
analyzes the impact of his tax policy and sees its one objective: a
complete plutocratic takeover.</LD>
<TE>   Entitlement for the rich has been deeply etched into Bush's
constitution, if not his soul. And his estate tax cut, another step
toward a single-mindedly envisioned plutocracy, is another hangman's
plank for the lynching of progressive taxation. Judging from past
inattentions, it's unlikely that the public will be listening to the
debate for his latest giveaway schemes for the rich.</TE>
<TE>   If not, Bush's economic coup d'etat will continue unabated, for no
economic alternative plan seems apparent in the "Sleepy Hollow" we
call the Democratic side of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Hoover</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Odd that George W. Bush would select for the Treasury post someone
who applauded Bill Clinton's balanced budget and deficit reduction
just a few short years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Not so odd, however, is the fact that Forbes magazine gave John W.
Snow a CEO rating of "D" for his stewardship of CSX Corp., which
hemorrhaged profits for five years even as Mr. Snow paid himself
handsomely with millions in salary and stock options. And this is
whom our president selects to lead us into economic recovery?</TE>

<LD>Re "City's Future Is in Erasing the Past," Dec. 8:</LD>
<LD>   George Orwell once wrote, "One who controls the past commands the
future." I always thought that he meant this as a criticism of those
who engage in rewriting history to promote their own political
interests, but I am afraid that some members of the Mission Viejo
City Council might have taken this statement as a lesson in political
leadership.</LD>
<LD>   Any attempt by the new City Council to remove the names of those
who have contributed so generously to our community from the city
facilities, or any unleashing of vengeance upon city staff who simply
performed their bureaucratic duties honestly and competently under
the previous regime, is petty demagoguery at best.</LD>

<TE>   The article was my first introduction to this Assemblyman John
Lewis, and yet he is allegedly the architect of the Mission Viejo
City Council takeover.</TE>
<TE>   Why is it that he was able to supply so much cash without having
any hint of his name connected with "Friends of Mission Viejo"? I am
a very vocal member of the city and speak regularly at City Hall. Why
have I never seen him there?</TE>
<TE>   If he really wanted to "make a difference," as he was quoted as
saying, why does he not come and speak at an open microphone in front
of his peers?</TE>
<TE>   If there is one thing I've learned about politics, it's that
people don't just raise large sums of money for candidates without
expecting something in return -- and thanks to this article, I'd like
to know what it is.</TE>

<LD>Re "Dissent Growing Over Rancho Mission Viejo," Dec. 2:</LD>
<LD>   After a 50-year orgy of free-for-all building in Orange County, we
are left with ugly urban sprawl, monstrous freeway traffic jams,
overcrowded schools, polluted air and water, decaying
infrastructures, chronic sewage spills and a host of other problems.</LD>
<LD>   Intelligent, civilized planning demands that we stop and take a
breather from all the frantic construction and solve the enormous
problems that development has brought in the last century. Our city
and county planning departments must recognize that enlightened
planning does not just mean development of land. It also means the
preservation of what is beautiful and a consideration always for the
quality of life.</LD>
<TE>   Planners must remember that their boss is the public, not the
wealthy builders they meet with on a regular basis. There seems to be
a built-in conflict of interest in their jobs. Planners need to
listen to the the taxpayers. Developers often argue that a "balance"
should be reached between them and environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, the population of Orange County was 210,000. Today it is
2.8 million. Yes, let us talk about balance. Instead of more people,
more housing projects, more automobiles, more destructive toll roads,
etc., let's call a halt to mindless construction in the irreplaceable
pristine lands of South County. Let our planners work on the massive
problems they have helped create as a result of overbuilding. Let's
be civilized enough to see the priceless beauty that exists in South
County must be preserved for future generations.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Preserve or Develop Rancho Mission Viejo?," Dec. 8:</TE>
<TE>   Letter writer Bruce Crawford of Fountain Valley praised property
rights as the cornerstone of liberty: I hope Mr. Crawford then also
recognizes the rights of smaller property owners and opposes the
regular utilization of eminent domain -- the seizing of private
property for the "greater good" of the public.</TE>
<TE>   Large landowners with pending projects are allowed to tromp on the
rights of smaller property owners in order to push through their
projects because a road or other infrastructure utility is needed. A
government agency may declare a public project that requires the
seizing of private property, often against the property owners' will
and at prices below what the owners may consider fair-market value
even if they are willing to part with their property.</TE>
<TE>   And how is the property-right issue addressed when the
consequences of large property owners' rights to develop spill
outside property boundary lines in the form of urban runoff,
pollution, crime and traffic? Developers in Orange County have long
had preferential treatment over the wishes of the public.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the time the crux of the matter can be answered by asking
the question: "Who stands to make the big bucks?"</TE>
<TE>   And to counter Mr. Crawford's last question, why is it not freedom
to cherish open space?</TE>

<HD>Catholics Have Been Sharing Deep Levels of Hope, Despair</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dwight Smith</AU>
<BD>Dwight Smith works for the Catholic Worker, a community
service group that runs the largest homeless shelter in Orange
County.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Barman and John McAndrew, two Roman Catholic priests who on
Wednesday will perform public acts of penance, have asked Catholics
to suggest acts of contrition they can perform to assist their
scandal-plagued church. The priests surprised my wife and me by
listing our private telephone number as the one to call with
suggestions for the priests' acts of penance.</LD>
<LD>   The first call came in at 4:45 a.m., and we've now fielded more
than 70. Most were from confused Catholics asking, "Why should these
innocent priests do any penance whatsoever?" But we sensed no
confusion at all regarding the perhaps unanswerable horror of how
bishops could have ignored what was being done to innocent children.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the callers are victims of sexual abuse by the clergy.
They honored me by sharing their stories. Tentative at first, they
would haltingly discover that I was not a priest but another kind of
survivor. At that point, we would share deepening levels of hope and
despair -- despair in the terrible acknowledgment of what we had
lost, but in the end, a growing hope that these innocent and
impetuous priests could spark a realization, a terrible epiphany for
all of us.</LD>
<TE>   Because of this priestly example of penance and the impact of
these 70 conversations, I now know that these tragedies occurred
because people like me and you too often ignored what some people are
doing to other people's children.</TE>
<TE>   Some well-meaning bishop might respond, "You're not responsible
for those people or those children." But Christ has commanded us to
listen to priests, but not to do as they do, and above all, to love
our neighbors as ourselves. He has a given us numerous warnings
against limiting the size of our neighborhood, and that's exactly
what we would be doing if we listened to those intended words of
consolation.</TE>
<TE>   We also must do more than bishops who listened to psychiatric and
legal experts whose entire spiritual legacy has everything to do with
self-fulfillment and nothing to do with the fulfillment of Christ's
plan for humanity.</TE>
<TE>   We are not consoled; our wounds are unbound. And not just as
survivors, but as a people searching for God, and for ways to God. As
a result, we have together built a place where the suffering of
children, still a scandal, is also a source of redemption.</TE>
<TE>   Here at the Catholic Worker, the children's shelter where the
priests' penance is to take place, we help parents help their
children. We help them to heal, to grow and to learn. And like these
priests who have forsaken their upward mobility within the strangely
unrepentant Roman Catholic hierarchy, we also sacrifice and do
penance.</TE>
<TE>   In order to invite victims into our hearts, and our homes, and
back into our church, we must also suffer. We must likewise become
"victims" of a personal sacrifice offered in restitution, and we must
do this through service to other people's victims: the victims of
both this current scandal and the ongoing and even more enormous
scandal of children abused, molested or neglected and then abandoned
by all of us. Abandoned, sadly, as we raise our voices in a
condemnation of the church that fuels both our denial and the scandal
itself, and whose very fury derives from our complicity.</TE>
<TE>   If we were caring each day for victims, we might have saving
testimony to offer our bishops, and to our bishops' victims. We might
send it to them in the form of a public penance.</TE>
<TE>   The redemption that these priests, and each one of us, can offer
the victims of the church's scandal, is to repent of our own
abdication and allow the victims' ongoing suffering to heal us in the
same way we have let Christ's suffering heal us.</TE>
<TE>   Could there be any greater act of reconciliation than to let their
wounds give us impetus to renew our search, and to spur us to
merciful service to other people's victims? To let our vanity crumble
before their terrible injuries so their injuries need not be borne
alone and in vain? I pray not, and I in turn ask for your prayers,
victim and priest alike, that we might soon reunite in our search for
a common path to God.</TE>

<AU>Fred Smoller</AU>
<BD>Fred Smoller is chairman of the department of political
science at Chapman University and director of the Ludie and David. C.
Henley Social Sciences Research Laboratory.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Absent a successful legal challenge to Measure V, voters in the 3rd
District will choose a new supervisor in a special election Jan. 28.
With the two great issues of the last decade -- the Orange County
bankruptcy and the proposed airport at the former El Toro Marine base
-- largely behind us, and with no other offices or propositions on
the ballot, voters have the opportunity to take a fresh look at
Orange County and the many challenges it faces.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, this election could be an exemplary election -- a model
of "how to do it."</LD>
<LD>   Professor Bruce Buchanan, a political scientist at the University
of Texas at Austin, uses the phrase "good democratic practice" to
describe how campaigns should be conducted from the point of view of
what is best for citizens.</LD>
<TE>   Here's a look at how "good democratic practice" could define the
role and behavior of three groups -- candidates, the media and the
voters -- as the Jan. 28 election approaches.</TE>
<TE>   CANDIDATES</TE>
<TE>   If a court challenge to be decided this month doesn't derail the
election, the race probably will be among former Assemblyman Bill
Campbell, former Tustin Councilman Jim Potts, Robert L. Douglas of
Orange and Douglas Boeckler of Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Research shows that negative campaigns turn voters off and cause
them not to vote. The candidates should tell their campaign managers
that they will not tolerate personal attacks and attempts at
character assassination. They should not permit such attacks in their
campaign advertising, or by those who campaign on their behalf with
so-called independent expenditure committees.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they should focus on the critical issues facing Orange
County, especially those identified by the media and academic
researchers such as Mark Baldassare, whose recently released Annual
Survey of Orange County is packed with useful information about
county issues.</TE>
<TE>   Political science research shows that candidate debates are among
the most important vehicles for educating voters about the issues and
the candidates. The candidates should agree to participate in a
minimum of three debates in different parts of the 3rd District,
perhaps on university campuses or other venues where the public has
easy access. These debates should be held once a week beginning
immediately after the New Year. I would be pleased to host and
moderate one or more of these at Chapman University in Orange or to
help find a venue and a moderator, such as the League of Women
Voters, that the candidates, public and press find acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   MEDIA</TE>
<TE>   We need press coverage that provides citizens with the information
they need to make an informed choice. "Horse race" coverage -- who's
up and who's down and the inside "dope" on the campaign -- is
entertaining but provides little useful information. Instead of
infotainment journalism, the press should focus first on candidate
character and qualifications; what type of people are the candidates;
and their political and social values, their education and their
experience.</TE>
<TE>   Next, reporters should identify the major issues facing Orange
County and detail what each candidate proposes to do about them.</TE>
<TE>   Voter guides published by the media, which include easy-to-read
and informative tables about the candidates and where they stand on
the issues, also would help voters make informed choices.</TE>
<TE>   Given the high percentage of voters who use absentee ballots (as
high as 33% in some cities), these should be made available as early
as possible. With only one race to cover, the press will have the
time to do more detailed and policy-oriented stories.</TE>
<TE>   VOTERS</TE>
<TE>   Campaigns should be about the needs of voters, but they seldom
are. It is the voter's job to pay attention to the campaign, become
reasonably informed about the major issues and to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan suggests that a turnout of at least 50% in a presidential
election is a reasonable goal. That would be high for this race --
20% to 25% is more likely in a special election -- but it's a worthy
target.</TE>
<TE>   Each of us can contribute to a higher turnout by talking about the
election and the issues with our friends, colleagues and neighbors,
and by attending one or more of the proposed candidate debates.</TE>
<TE>   By doing these things individuals reaffirm their faith in
democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Let's take advantage of this unique opportunity to hold an
exemplary campaign -- or at least a much better campaign -- than is
typically held in Orange County.</TE>

<LD>UCLA assault -- In some editions of Saturday's California section,
several paragraphs were inadvertently omitted from an article about
the alleged rape of a UCLA woman. The missing passages explained the
criminal charges against three Carson High School students who were
visiting the campus on a field trip, as well as details about the
trip. The story is reprinted in its entirety today inside the
affected California sections.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Top officials with the YWCA of central Orange County will unveil a
proposal Monday that would allow the beleaguered 81-year-old
organization to retain a presence in the city of Orange, even though
it plans to merge with the Boys &amp; Girls Club.</LD>
<LD>   "The executive board is looking into solutions that would involve
a new start for the YWCA in Orange," said Shannon Tucker, executive
director of the chapter. "It would be nice if the solution would
involve stepping back in time to the simpler, basic mission of the
YWCA."</LD>
<LD>   Tucker declined to release the details, which will be presented to
the Board of Directors.</LD>
<TE>   The nonprofit announced in November that it would be shutting down
in June, because it was no longer able to cover the costs of
providing child care, after-school programs and other services for
needy families.</TE>
<TE>   The "new start" comes in the midst of a battle between factions of
the Young Women's Christian Assn., and against the backdrop of a
national decline in membership and support that have forced more than
half of the YWCA's chapters across the country to close.</TE>
<TE>   The merger being explored by the Orange chapter would involve
combining operations with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Tustin and Santa
Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Board member Arianna Barrios, who is against the merger, said YWCA
leaders have mismanaged finances and are breaking the organization's
bylaws.</TE>

<LD>A Buena Park man accused of firing an assault rifle into a party at a
Fullerton house early Saturday was arrested on suspicion of attempted
murder, and three of his family members were charged with being
accessories, police said.</LD>
<LD>   No one was injured in the incident. Fullerton police said Harvey
Garcia, 19, went to the house in the 2100 block of West Olive Avenue
looking for a man who had tried to break up a fight between him and
his girlfriend, Jessica Mena, 18, an hour earlier. Garcia fled after
firing the rifle into the house and pointing it at the host, Lt. Doug
Cave said.</LD>
<LD>   Police found Garcia leaving his house with his father, Javier
Garcia, 56, about 12:45 a.m. Another car leaving the house held Mena;
Garcia's mother, Maria Garcia, 43; stepbrother Miguel Gonzalez, 19;
and three assault rifles, Cave said. All but Mena were arrested as
alleged accessories to a murder attempt.</LD>

<LD>This story, which ran in Saturday's California section, is being

from some editions of The Times.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Carson High School officials were unable to explain Friday how
three popular students apparently eluded supervision during a
school-sponsored visit to UCLA last week and allegedly sexually
assaulted a UCLA student in her dorm room.</LD>
<TE>   Carson High Principal Douglas Waybright said school officials were
investigating the incident, which is alleged to have occurred Dec. 5
during a daytime tour of the Westwood campus. Only one teacher was
assigned to supervise 56 students during the excursion, according to
Los Angeles Unified School District officials.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA police arrested the three students the next day, using
descriptions provided by the victim and other witnesses. But details
of the alleged incident became public only this week.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office said Friday that
it had asked the Inglewood Juvenile Court to order that the suspects
be tried as adults.</TE>
<TE>   The two 17-year-olds and a 16-year-old had not been identified,
pending their certification as adults. They were in juvenile custody,
charged with one count each of forcible rape in concert, forcible
rape and oral copulation, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the 17-year-olds also faces an additional count of sexual
battery for allegedly groping a second woman in a campus dorm the
same day.</TE>
<TE>   "This crime was horrendous," Deputy Dist. Atty. Alex Karkanen, who
is handling the case, said Friday. "Our primary goal is to ensure a
successful prosecution."</TE>
<TE>   At UCLA and Carson High on Friday, officials privately said that
planning for the visit might have been too hasty and that more Carson
High staff members should have accompanied the students.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Cox, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Unified School
District, to which Carson belongs, said that, according to the
district's police report, the students arrived at the campus about
9:30 a.m. for a welcoming presentation. They were split into groups
and were told to meet at a certain spot on campus by 1:30 p.m. Cox
said she did not know whether any adult accompanied any group of
students.</TE>
<TE>   A Carson High teacher who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
students had been allowed to explore the campus for several hours on
their own.</TE>
<TE>   "My understanding is, they were given some free time," the teacher
said. "We've taken many trips to UCLA. Students are told not to go
certain places, and if they're told they're representing Carson High
School, you expect them to listen."</TE>
<TE>   The teacher who led the field trip, Cox said, "had no indication
that anything was wrong." It was only the next day, when UCLA police
went to the Carson campus, that high school officials learned of the
alleged assault.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA policy requires that high school students on campus tours be
accompanied by one teacher or counselor for every 25 students,
officials said. But Carson High had informed the university too late
to arrange for a formal tour; the students were there on an informal
basis.</TE>
<TE>   Waybright, who has been principal of the 3,500-student high school
for four years, said he could not discuss most specifics of the UCLA
visit, but said the students had been supervised by the high school
staff. He would not say how many supervisors there were.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very unfortunate incident," he said. "We're all very
disappointed and hurt by just the notion of it, because we have a
great school here."</TE>
<TE>   Students interviewed at the campus Friday identified those
arrested as two seniors and a junior and said at least one was a
member of the football team. Cox, the district spokeswoman, said two
of the boys live together. The three are good friends, described as
popular and funny.</TE>
<TE>   At UCLA, police spokeswoman Nancy Greenstein said that the young
woman, accompanied by friends, went to the campus police station late
in the afternoon of Dec. 5 and reported that she had been raped. She
and others who had seen the young men on campus and near the Fir
residence hall provided detailed descriptions.</TE>
<TE>   Greenstein and other UCLA officials said that, while other sexual
attacks have occurred on the campus over the years, including an
assault in a restroom in January 2001, only one, in 1987, involved an
attack by a stranger in a residence hall.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very uncommon for us to have an assault like this on campus
... but the reality also is that we're in a large urban area and on
occasion bad things happen."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA officials said the young men are believed to have entered the
residence hall, a four-story structure housing about 200 students, by
"tailgating" students who had opened the door to the building with
electronic key cards.</TE>
<TE>   "They apparently walked in behind the students," said Mark
Foraker, UCLA's housing director.</TE>
<TE>   "These three individuals would appear to be of a similar age, so
they would not have stood out necessarily from the students who live
here."</TE>
<TE>   Foraker said campus security and housing officials are reviewing
their security and campus visitation policies to make sure students
are protected. He said the review would be completed in several
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said, UCLA police have stepped up patrols around
the residence halls, most of which are in the northwest part of the
sprawling campus.</TE>
<TE>   And at the De Neve Plaza dormitory complex, which includes the Fir
residence hall, students heading home for holiday break Friday
expressed a range of emotions about the alleged assault, from
resignation to fear to anger.</TE>
<TE>   Several students said crime could happen anywhere. Others said the
alleged attack was a reminder that they should not walk alone from
the library to their dorms in the middle of the night or prop open
their room doors when they do laundry.</TE>
<TE>   And one second-year student voiced irritation that campus security
officers had not provided more details, letting rumors get out of
hand.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not telling anyone what happened," said Monica Gray, a
second-year student, "But people have a right to know."</TE>

<HD>Court: Hold Cops Liable for Pursuits</HD>
<DH>A state appellate panel urges the Legislature to change
laws giving officers immunity in crashes and victims no avenue for
redress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state appeals court has taken the unusual step of urging lawmakers
to change laws that give police officers broad protections against
liability in high-speed chases, saying cops should be held more
accountable for their actions.</LD>
<LD>   The 4th District Court of Appeal issued its challenge in a
stinging opinion involving a Westminster police officer who chased a
stolen car through a high school campus in 1995. The suspect's car
slammed into a dumpster, which struck an innocent bystander who was
collecting recyclables, gravely injuring him.</LD>
<LD>   The justices said the existing law, considered the nation's most
protective, amounts to a "get-out-of-liability-free card" for police
officers regardless of whether they act recklessly during chases. The
law also leaves victims no form of redress, they said.</LD>
<TE>   "We urge the Legislature to revisit this statute and seriously
reconsider the balance between public entity immunity and public
safety. The balance appears to have shifted too far toward immunity,"
the court stated in its opinion published earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling comes amid growing scrutiny of police chases, which
according to federal statistics have killed 541 people in the last 10
years across California.</TE>
<TE>   Of those victims, 181 were either pedestrians or innocent
occupants of cars that crossed paths with cruisers or getaway cars.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent high-profile case earlier this month, a
3-week-old Los Angeles boy lost his left arm when a man fleeing the
scene of a stabbing sped through a red light and crashed into the
sport utility vehicle the baby was riding in.</TE>
<TE>   Under existing law, officers do not have to prove they were
following a formal pursuit policy when a suspect's car crashes and
causes harm. Rather, all they have to do is show the department had
an adequate policy in place. Officers can be held liable if their
vehicle hits a bystander.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the justices said they had no choice but to rule
against the family of the man hit during the Westminster chase, even
though justices believed the police officer acted improperly.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates who have long been pushing to rewrite the rules said
they are buoyed by the court's commentary, describing it as the
strongest argument to date in their fight to get the statute
overturned.</TE>
<TE>   State lawmakers are not obligated to take up the matter, and it is
not immediately clear if they will.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, even some law enforcement officials said the ruling
should force police departments to reexamine their chase policies and
consider ways to reduce the risks to bystanders.</TE>
<TE>   "A decision like this, or the comments surrounding the decision,
is a good heads-up that departments need to pay attention," said
Newport Beach Police Chief Bob McDonell, president of the California
Police Chiefs Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The statute in question, known formally as 17004.7 of the motor
vehicle code, shields police officers from liability in chases to a
far greater degree than similar laws in other states, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "California has taken it to an extreme," said Geoffrey Alpert, a
criminology professor at the University of South Carolina who is
considered among the nation's top authorities on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The law was actually a compromise reached 15 years ago between the
California State Trial Lawyers Assn. and a coalition of 160
government agencies, insurers, doctors and nonprofit groups such as
the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.</TE>
<TE>   Citing rising insurance costs, the coalition was considering a
statewide ballot measure that would extend strict limits on all types
of liability claims, said Browne Greene, a Los Angeles attorney who
was president of the association at the time.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, most police departments did not have pursuit policies
in place. So the trial lawyers agreed to support immunity for those
departments that created polices, Greene said. As part of the
compromise, the parties agreed to extend the period of time in which
victims could file lawsuits against government agencies from 100 days
to six months.</TE>
<TE>   After the law was adopted, police departments across the state
established chase policies. But Greene now believes the law has
proven to be flawed.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the idea of establishing policies has done
anything. You've seen an ever-increasing set of carnage, murder and
mayhem caused by these police chases," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other lawyers who have handled such cases agree that the recent
ruling could be pivotal in getting the statute overturned.</TE>
<TE>   "This may very well be a watershed moment," said Carole A. Watson,
a Los Angeles civil rights attorney who said her firm stopped taking
such cases a long time ago "because you just can't win them."</TE>
<TE>   But police officials and their lawyers maintain that public safety
will be in greater jeopardy if police are second-guessed about every
chase.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, if they open up liability for all pursuits, that will
have a chilling effect on whether or not to allow the crook to run,
and essentially give them good reason to. That's the danger," said
McDonell, the Newport Beach chief.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a delicate balance of not being able to pursue criminals and
weighing the risks of pursuing them."</TE>
<TE>   McDonell said most departments have adequate policies and review
measures in place, so that if protocols are not followed, officers
are punished with actions ranging from written reprimand to firing.</TE>
<TE>   The suit in Westminster was brought by the family of Khuong Van
Nguyen, who was seriously brain-damaged in the accident and spent
three years in a hospital until he died, leaving behind a wife and
three children.</TE>
<TE>   His family is preparing to appeal the 4th District's ruling to the
California Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The state's highest court has already upheld the statute, ruling
in 1999 that an officer who gives chase without activating a siren or
red light is still fully protected from liability. But the family's
Los Angeles attorney, John Taylor, said he hopes the appellate
court's attack will encourage state justices to take another look at
the law.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hopeful that the California Supreme Court would take a look
at this very pressing issue," Taylor said. "I think that the
frustrations that the [4th District] court expressed in their opinion
is an invitation for the Supreme Court to do something that the
Legislature hasn't done yet."</TE>

<HD>Voices Raised in Operatic Fog</HD>
<DH>San Francisco Opera singers say the fake haze used in
productions is making them ill. Management insists the fumes are
safe.</DH>

<AU>John M. Glionna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>For veteran soprano Pamela Dale, the opera has always been an
ethereal realm where the human voice is prized as a divine musical
instrument. It is not, she insists, a place she ever thought she'd
have to wear a respirator.</LD>
<LD>   But each time she comes to sing, until the moment she walks on
stage, Dale wears a black and purple mask that makes her appear
otherworldly and feel foolish. The reason, she says, is that the
opera is making her sick.</LD>
<LD>   The reason, say Dale and fellow choristers: the chemical fog
widely used in theatrical productions to create dramatic atmosphere.
Containing either mineral oil or a mix of glycol alcohols similar to
those in automobile antifreeze, the chemical mist has damaged their
breathing, they contend, and threatens the range of their voices.</LD>
<TE>   "San Francisco has the sickest opera house in the world," Dale
said. "With their use of these chemicals, the management are ruining,
not only people's careers, but their health as well. Many people are
sick but are afraid to speak out for fear it will cost them their
jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Call them divas in distress, but Dale and a growing number of
chorus singers have complained to opera officials or filed workers'
compensation lawsuits. Last month, a chorus singer and sometime
soloist sued in Superior Court, accusing the opera and several
chemical fog manufacturers of negligence, fraud and unfair business
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran female singers who complain of illness say that they are
ridiculed as drama queens and that their complaints are dismissed as
"menopausal."</TE>
<TE>   Dale and others say they have no alternative but to return to work
in an atmosphere that they consider dangerous. With only a handful of
full-time operas nationwide, there are 2,000 applicants for each
chorus opening.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't enough houses, not enough jobs," said Alexandra
Nehra, a San Francisco opera singer for 17 years, who has filed a
claim contending that the use of faux fog is being taken to dangerous
extremes. "We don't want to lose our professions. We're singers. It's
all we know how to do."</TE>
<TE>   The outcry led earlier this month to a daylong hearing in which
city supervisors were asked to consider a ban on fake fog. But
production unions associated with the opera warned that such a move
would discourage Hollywood filmmakers from coming to town.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Chris Daley listened as two dozen opera singers
described symptoms such as vomiting, dizziness and labored breathing.
Some artists said they have at times been so sick that they have had
to be dragged offstage.</TE>
<TE>   "The science about the chemicals isn't conclusive," he said. "But
here come all these people describing all these terrible symptoms
and, at some point, the anecdotal evidence becomes pretty
compelling."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Opera spokesman Robert Cable dismisses the claims.
"We'd never do anything to endanger our artists," he said. "We
contend that the use of this fog is consistent with the best
practices and reflects our ongoing commitment to health and safety."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Daley, San Francisco Opera's production director,
Patrick Markle, guaranteed that the fake fog is safe and criticized
"widespread misinformation and misstatements about the facts."</TE>
<TE>   "We have conducted extensive research and independent studies
verifying the science that supports using theatrical smoke and fog in
the [War Memorial] Opera House as safe and not posing health risks,"
Markle wrote. In addressing supervisors, Markle cited "ventilation
experts" who support the use of chemical fog.</TE>
<TE>   The mix of glycol smoke and mineral oil has been an issue in other
performance venues, including Hollywood. On Broadway, a 2001 study by
New York's Mount Sinai Medical Center concluded, "actors are at risk
when exposed to elevated or peak levels."</TE>
<TE>   But the New York probe also noted that, if exposure levels were
reduced to limits recommended in the study, "actors should not suffer
adverse impact to their health or their vocal abilities."</TE>
<TE>   Ken Greenwood, senior business representative for Actors' Equity
Assn., a union representing 45,000 actors on Broadway and in regional
theaters, said union officials will enter into a collective
bargaining agreement with theater owners this month to establish a
protocol to identify how levels of fog and smoke will be monitored
and enforced.</TE>
<TE>   Former camerawoman Carol Wetovic filed a workers' compensation
claim against DreamWorks SKG after she became sick from theatrical
stage effects, including faux fog, used on the set of the TV show
"Spin City."</TE>
<TE>   "Every time, every place they use it, people complain," Wetovic
said.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Wade, a safety official with the International
Cinematographers Guild, said Hollywood has taken steps to set
standards on the use of such theatrical effects. "There may be actors
that don't like to work in it," he said. "It makes them
uncomfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, few other opera singers have reported fog-related
illness similar to those in San Francisco. The reason, union
officials say, is that San Francisco, the nation's second-largest
opera after New York City, operates in an ornate 70-year-old building
with poor ventilation.</TE>
<TE>   Also, other cities that use chemical fog do not have a full-time
staff or schedule.</TE>
<TE>   While officials at the Los Angeles Opera say they are aware of the
controversy, they contend that the company does not use glycol
machines and is continually updating all fog-making equipment for
safety.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Papuc, Nehra's lawyer, says his client has already settled
a workers' compensation claim but is suing "on behalf of the general
public to get the San Francisco Opera to stop using these harmful
chemicals."</TE>
<TE>   Nehra says that, along with her health, her art has suffered. If a
performer can't breathe deeply, singing is impossible. "To hit the
high notes you need a column of air to support the notes," she said.
"Without air, you strain your vocal chords."</TE>
<TE>   Dale traces her illness to a 1998 production of the opera "Norma,"
when the opera house's chemical fog cloud didn't stop even after the
show ended. "The entire chorus was trapped behind this curtain with
our lungs burning from this smoke and fog," she recalled. "Everybody
was choking."</TE>
<TE>   But singers say opera management would not discuss the fog use.</TE>
<TE>   After Dale and others filed workers' compensation claims, the
California Department of Health Services in 2000 conducted a survey
that found 39% of opera employees had become sick from exposure to
the fog.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though 28 of the 44 chorus members were sick, the opera
refused to address the matter because it impinged on the artistic
discussion of management, which is convinced these products are
essential to creating a look," said Mark Mitchell, a spokesman for
the American Guild of Musical Artists, which represents 6,000 opera,
ballet and choral performers.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the 2000 study, the California Occupational Safety and
Health Administration cited the San Francisco opera for a "serious"
violation of workplace safety and set a $2,340 fine. But after the
opera promised to take measures, including special training, the
citing was reduced to a general violation and the fine dropped to
$750.</TE>
<TE>   "This is war," Dale said. "The opera has isolated us as traitors
and scapegoats. But we won't quit until they clean up their act."</TE>

<HD>DUI Case Botched by Blood Mix-Up</HD>
<DH>A collegian finds LAPD lab used wrong man's sample to
finger him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matt Lait and Scott Glover</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nick Bergamo knew he wasn't drunk when police pulled him over for
driving under the influence. But when his blood alcohol test came
back from the Los Angeles Police Department's crime lab, it showed he
was nearly twice the legal limit.</LD>
<LD>   That couldn't be, he told his attorney. So his attorney hired a
private laboratory to test the blood sample. Again, his blood alcohol
level was recorded at well over the legal driving limit.</LD>
<LD>   Bergamo, a 20-year-old Loyola Marymount College student, was
emphatic that the tests were wrong. As his case moved closer to
trial, Bergamo and his parents convinced his attorney to perform a
DNA test on the blood sample, a highly unusual step for a DUI charge.</LD>
<TE>   The result: The blood belonged to another man.</TE>
<TE>   The findings vindicated Bergamo and raised questions about the
LAPD's handling of blood evidence -- an issue that embarrassed the
LAPD during the 1994 murder trial of O.J. Simpson.</TE>
<TE>   "I was floored when the results came back," said Lane Scherer, the
lawyer who represented Bergamo. "A mistake like this is a big, big
deal."</TE>
<TE>   Scherer said the implications of the mix-up may extend beyond this
one case, noting that blood tests generally are tested by labs in
batches. "So if you mess up one, the others might be wrong as well,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   If Bergamo got somebody else's blood, Scherer said, didn't it make
sense that somebody got his?</TE>
<TE>   Police officials said they are investigating how the mix-up
occurred and who is responsible. But, they said, they are fairly
confident that the lab did not make a mistake. One possible
explanation, they said, was that the blood was mislabeled when it was
initially drawn by nurses at the LAPD's jail intake facility in Van
Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to figure out what happened," said Cmdr. Gary Brennan,
the department's spokesman. "We're not dropping this. We want to know
what occurred just as much as anybody."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the department's probe, LAPD criminalists said they
also will have the blood sample tested at a private DNA lab, to make
sure that Bergamo's attorney or lab weren't the ones who made the
mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Where's Blood Sample?</TE>
<TE>   A lab official said seven other blood samples were tested at the
same time as the sample identified as Bergamo's. All eight of them,
the official said, had blood alcohol levels well above the legal
driving limit. Now, however, police don't know what really became of
the blood sample taken from Bergamo or whether it was even tested.</TE>
<TE>   According to the police report of the incident, LAPD officers
spotted Bergamo around midnight on May 25 speeding southbound on
Shoshone Avenue near Rinaldi Street in the San Fernando Valley when
they decided to pull him over.</TE>
<TE>   Officers said they smelled alcohol on Bergamo's breath, saw that
his eyes were bloodshot and heard him slur his words. They asked him
to step out of his truck so they could conduct a field sobriety test
on him. After a series of tests, which the officers said he failed,
Bergamo was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Bergamo, his attorney said, disputed nearly every aspect of the
police report, from the street where police said they pulled him over
to his performance on the sobriety tests. A passenger in Bergamo's
car was prepared to testify in Bergamo's defense if the case went to
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Though Bergamo was adamant that he was not impaired by alcohol,
his attorney declined to say whether the young man had had any
alcohol before getting behind the wheel. Any alcohol in his blood
would have been illegal because Bergamo is under 21, the state's
legal drinking age. Bergamo declined to talk about the case, but
released a prepared statement through his lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not under the influence at the time the officers stopped my
vehicle," Bergamo said. "I feel the police report is grossly
inaccurate.... This has been a very painful and disheartening
experience."</TE>
<TE>   Drunk driving offenses can have significant ramifications for
motorists, from jail time in cases that result in injuries to a
year's suspension of a driver's license. Car insurance rates also go
up dramatically for years after such convictions.</TE>
<TE>   With the stakes so high, Bergamo's parents sought out the law
offices of Lawrence Taylor, a firm that deals exclusively with DUI
cases. Lawyers in that firm automatically retest blood samples tested
by the police.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, who has written books on the subject of DUIs, said test
results from police labs are often unreliable. Sometimes the
equipment is not calibrated correctly, he said, or sometimes police
put too much or too little of a blood preservative in the sample,
which can affect results.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a real big fan of crime labs and their criminalists.
They're clueless. But most attorneys know less, and that's why they
can get by," said Taylor, who assigned Scherer to represent Bergamo.</TE>
<TE>   In Bergamo's case, the test results from the LAPD showed that the
blood alcohol level in the sample was 0.148. When Taylor's lab
performed the test, the results were 0.13. For Bergamo, even the
retested results seemed impossible. His attorney then conducted a
blood-typing test to determine whether it was Bergamo's blood. That
test failed to exclude him as a possible donor.</TE>
<TE>   DUI Case Dismissed</TE>
<TE>   The young man, however, was insistent that a mistake had been
made. A DNA test was his last hope to prove it. His parents agreed to
pay the additional expense of such a test, which runs about $1,200.</TE>
<TE>   The results finally cleared Bergamo. A judge earlier this month
dismissed the case and made a factual finding of innocence on his
behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Since the dismissal, word of Bergamo's case has spread among local
defense attorneys in court hallways and legal chat rooms on the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "DUI practitioners dealing with blood analysis should be aware
that crime labs continue to fail in their chain-of-custody record
keeping," Taylor warned other lawyers in a recent e-mail message.
"And the LAPD apparently remains a prime culprit."</TE>

<LD>Holiday parades and religious processions were the order of the day
Saturday as Laguna Niguel, Santa Ana and Villa Park stepped off with
their own colorful pre-Christmas celebrations.</LD>
<LD>   The festivities began in the early morning, when Villa Park kicked
off its annual Santa Parade, and continued into the late evening with
Santa Ana's Las Posadas procession along Main Street. But the largest
event was in South County as dozens of bands, equestrian teams,
organizations, clubs and celebrities entertained a crowd of more than
9,000 in the annual Laguna Niguel Holiday Parade.</LD>
<LD>   In Villa Park, a Santa Claus riding a sleek fire engine
crisscrossed Orange County's smallest city before throngs of cheering
children and parents. With the ambitious goal of covering more than
50 local streets, the procession began at 8 a.m. and continued until
the early evening.</LD>
<TE>   In Laguna Niguel, original TV Mouseketeer Sherry Van Meter was
among the celebrities in the milelong procession along Crown Valley
Parkway from Street of the Golden Lantern to Niguel Road. The theme
of this year's parade was "Bringing Families Together." It featured
fire, law enforcement and emergency medical personnel, including
Sheriff's Police Chief Lt. Linda Spreine, who heads the sheriff's
contract services to the city.</TE>
<TE>   Other celebrities in the parade included Richard Karn, host of
TV's "Family Feud"; renowned gymnast Mitch Gaylord of the 1984
Olympics; and McKenzie Westmore, who plays Sheridan Crane on the TV
soap opera "Passions."</TE>
<TE>   "This was the first year we had actual celebrities," said parade
chairman Ron Perella, who directed 3,000 marchers from a golf cart.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Ana, hundreds of children and adults attended the Las
Posadas celebration at El Centro Cultural de Mexico, an event that
featured bands and activities, such as construction of pinatas. Las
Posadas is a Mexican Christmas tradition that reenacts Mary and
Joseph's search for shelter in Bethlehem before the birth of Jesus.
Saturday's event was a run-up to a Las Posadas celebration that
continues from Dec. 16 to 24.</TE>

<HD>Chinese Club Practices Many Arts of Unity</HD>
<DH>San Marino social center offers eclectic array of
activities.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a spacious room where elegrant drawings of Chinese bamboo groves
line the wall and a gold-painted screen shades the doorway, heels
clacked in time to "Achy Breaky Heart."</LD>
<LD>   And so began another day at the Chinese Club of San Marino.
Established in 1980, the club has become a focal point for the
Chinese American community -- a place to maintain traditions and to
learn about Californian trends.</LD>
<LD>   Cobbled together in 1994 and 1997 from vacant stores, a surf-wear
shop and a salon, the clubhouse features an eclectic array of weekly
events, including classes in line dancing, Peking Opera, yoga and
yuen ji wu (a form of martial arts that is like tai chi but faster).</LD>
<TE>   The clubhouse, which was the first permanent space for a Chinese
club in the region, also holds occasional workshops on flower
arrangement and sushi-rolling.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Chen, 49, who has been line dancing since the class started
six months ago, estimated that she visits the clubhouse five times a
week.</TE>
<TE>   One of the purposes of the club,Chen said, is "to combine all
cultures together, not just Chinese." The mother of three said she
participates in yoga, line dancing and a book club there.</TE>
<TE>   Eugene Sun, a former president of the nonprofit group, said, "In
the late '70s, the Chinese Club was formed because there was
disharmony. It was to help students to do better in schools -- get
better grades and communicate better."</TE>
<TE>   Now it is a symbol of the way Chinese have also become San
Marinans.</TE>
<TE>   "We offer whatever the community wants, whatever is popular.
Sometimes it's line dancing. Sometimes it's Chinese painting," said
Dennis Lin, the current president.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get people into the mainstream and be proactively
involved in the community," said Becky Ung, president of the San
Marino Board of Education, who teaches workshops at the club on
emotional intelligence and parenthood.</TE>
<TE>   "I only remember when I first moved here -- I wished someone would
explain to me how the school system works, how I can get involved,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   To this end, Ung often distributes fliers about school issues
during yoga or line-dancing classes.</TE>
<TE>   The club has also evolved into a crucial link between San Marino
community leaders and Chinese Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Zee, a part-time assistant to the Chinese Club president who
was doing paperwork one Friday morning in an office behind the big
hall, talked proudly about the club's monthly luncheon for city and
school officials, police officers and businesspeople who may not know
much about Chinese Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "Becky and I usually design something cultural. There are a lot of
things the community wants to know, but they don't know where to
start," Zee said.</TE>
<TE>   San Marino Police Chief Arl Farris said the luncheons have helped
his department better serve the Chinese community, which constitutes
41% of the city's population.</TE>
<TE>   Farris remembers one session in which members of the Chinese
community talked about traditional Chinese ways of showing respect,
such as looking down or away from people as they are speaking, in
contrast with Americans' tendency to look speakers straight in the
eye.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps in the past, officers were more assertive when people
were looking down and away, repeating questions more assertively or
pressing the issue more than now. Now when we see a person looking
down or away, we know that what they're doing is being respectful,
honoring the officer's position," Farris said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that the Police Department, which has no Chinese-speaking
officers, also draws about once a month from a list of translators
supplied by the Chinese Club.</TE>
<TE>   "The list is vital," said Farris. He said his dispatcher can call
one of the 30 volunteers at any hour of the day or night when
officers encounter someone who can't speak English.</TE>
<TE>   The club isn't limited to ethnic Chinese. Lois Matthews was
scissor-stepping and "grapevining" with the 40 other women at the
recent line-dancing class.</TE>
<TE>   "I come because I love line dancing. A lot of my friends do it,"
Matthews said. She knows Yung, the instructor, through their church.</TE>
<TE>   Fen-Cheng Chong, a 73-year-old in a lime green warmup suit, was
dancing near Matthews. Chong doesn't speak English, so the words to
"Achy Breaky Heart" and Yung's calls to grapevine -- a sideways dance
step -- were lost on her.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, Ung was dancing next to her. As Ung shouted out in
Mandarin to go back, go forward, and niu pi gu (shake your behind),
Chong began doing the electric slide in sync with the group.</TE>
<TE>   "I adore coming here," Chong said. "It gives me a chance to
sweat."</TE>
<TE>   And laugh. Giggles erupted every two minutes during the lesson as
women turned the wrong way or called out corrections in Mandarin when
the teacher made a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when Matthews made a joke -- in English -- they laughed
with her too.</TE>

<KH>TIMES HOLIDAY FUND</KH>
<HD>Center Helps Children Deal With Painful Realities</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daren Briscoe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's nothing visibly different about the children playing in the
waiting room at the Community Family Guidance Center in Cerritos.</LD>
<LD>   The two brothers playing board games and the girl puzzling over
her math homework wouldn't be out of place in any doctor's or
dentist's office.</LD>
<LD>   But the stories of the nearly 3,000 children the center serves are
not like the stories of most children. The lives they describe to the
counselors and psychologists give added significance to the donations
the center solicits for the children in an annual holiday
letter-writing campaign.</LD>
<TE>   "When you take poverty, mental illness, child abuse and neglect,
it doesn't add up to a happy holiday," said Patricia B. Kent,
director of community relations at the center.</TE>
<TE>   With programs for children "from birth to 18," the center takes
referrals from courts, probation officers, schools and mental-health
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   One program helps children recently discharged from mental-health
facilities readjust to living with their families. Another offers
counseling for those with substance abuse problems.</TE>
<TE>   Two-thirds of the children who receive counseling have experienced
some kind of neglect or physical or sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these kids with backgrounds of abuse are more prone to
drug abuse," Kent said. "They self-medicate so they don't have to
face reality."</TE>
<TE>   Though the mission of the nonprofit center is to help children
deal with reality, for one day of the year, after the gift drive,
it's OK to forget. A room normally used for group counseling is
decked out in holiday trimmings, and families are invited to "shop"
for donated toys.</TE>
<TE>   For this year's gift giveaway on Dec. 20, the toys won't be
wrapped, allowing parents to pick things appropriate to their
children's tastes, including gift certificates for hard-to-shop-for
teens. "It's just a way to empower the parents so they don't have to
feel like they're picking up a gift for their child from someone
else," Kent said.</TE>
<TE>   Kent remembers offering to help a family carry gifts to the car
during last year's drive, only to discover that the family had taken
the bus because their car had broken down. She drove them home, and
recalls how happy the children were with their toys. "The kids were
just so thrilled to have something new. All children love toys, but
it was an innocence you don't see in children who are used to having
things," she said.</TE>
<TE>   This season, as part of its annual holiday fund-raising drive, The
Times is featuring organizations that serve disadvantaged families
and children in Southern California. The Community Family Guidance
Center received $10,000 from last year's Times Holiday Campaign. It
is one of more than 50 charities that shared in the $653,000
collected in that fund-raising effort.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOW TO GIVE</TE>
<TE>   Donations (checks or money orders) supporting the Times Holiday
Campaign should be sent to: L.A. Times Holiday Campaign, File No.

<HD>L.A. Film Critics Pick 'Schmidt' as Year's Best Film</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"About Schmidt," Alexander Payne's comedy-drama about a recently
widowed retiree, was voted best picture of 2002 on Saturday by the
Los Angeles Film Critics Assn.</LD>
<LD>   "Far From Heaven," Todd Haynes' paean to '50s movie melodramas,
was the runner-up.</LD>
<LD>   "About Schmidt" won three awards Saturday. Besides best film, the
New Line release picked up best-actor honors for Jack Nicholson and
screenplay honors for director Payne and co-writer Jim Taylor.
Charlie Kaufman was runner-up in the screenplay category for
"Adaptation."</LD>
<TE>   Nicholson and Daniel Day-Lewis tied for best actor. The latter won
for his performance as a brutal New York 19th century gang leader in
Martin Scorsese's "Gangs of New York."</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson previously won best supporting actor from the critics'
group for 1983's "Terms of Endearment" and best actor for 1987's
"Ironweed" and "The Witches of Eastwick." Day-Lewis won best actor 13
years ago for "My Left Foot."</TE>
<TE>   Julianne Moore won best-actress honors for her roles as troubled
'50s housewives in "Far From Heaven" and Stephen Daldry's drama "The
Hours." Moore earlier won the National Board of Review of Motion
Pictures best-actress award for "Far From Heaven." Isabelle Huppert
was runner-up with the L.A. critics for "The Piano Teacher."</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Almodovar won best director for "Talk to Her," his
Spanish-language drama about two men who love comatose women. Haynes
was runner-up for "Far From Heaven."</TE>
<TE>   Edie Falco won the best supporting actress award for her role as a
woman trying to keep her Florida motel and restaurant out of the
hands of developers in John Sayles' "Sunshine State." Kathy Bates was
runner-up in the category for "About Schmidt."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Cooper took home the best supporting actor award for his
colorful performance as an eccentric, sexy orchid thief in Spike
Jonze's "Adaptation." Cooper already won the National Board of Review
award in the category. Runner-up was Christopher Walken for "Catch Me
If You Can."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign film honors went to Alfonso Cuaron's Mexican coming-of-age
comedy, "Y tu Mama Tambien." Almodovar's "Talk to Her" was runner-up.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the major awards handed out by the Los Angeles critics
went to independent features.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, they picked Todd Fields' indie drama "In the Bedroom"
as best film. It was subsequently nominated for five Academy Awards,
including best picture. With "About Schmidt" and "Far From Heaven"
dominating this year, it puts both in the running for Academy Award
nominations.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1975, the Los Angeles Film Critics Assn. has more than
50 members. Since 1980, 18% of its best-picture winners have gone on
to win best-picture Oscars, including "Rocky," "Schindler's List" and
"Unforgiven."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, it's best-actor pick, Denzel Washington for "Training
Day," and supporting actor choice, Jim Broadbent for "Iris," won the
Academy Awards in their respective categories.</TE>
<TE>   Other winners:</TE>
<TE>   Cinematographer: Edward Lachman, "Far From Heaven"; runner-up,
Conrad L. Hall, "Road to Perdition."</TE>
<TE>   Production design: Dante Ferretti, "Gangs of New York"; runner-up:
Mark Friedberg, "Far From Heaven."</TE>
<TE>   Animation: "Spirited Away"; special citation for "Lilo &amp; Stitch."</TE>
<TE>   Documentary/nonfiction: "The Cockettes"; runner-up: "Bowling for
Columbine."</TE>
<TE>   Music/score: Elmer Bernstein, "Far From Heaven"; runner-up, Philip
Glass, "The Hours."</TE>
<TE>   New Generation Award: Lynne Ramsay.</TE>
<TE>   Independent/experimental: "Corpus Collosum," Michael Snow; and
Kenneth Anger for his body of work.</TE>

<HD>Offensive Words? We Need to Stay on Offensive Against Gang
Killing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today, even more than usual, I'm going to be very careful about my
choice of words. A sensitivity epidemic is spreading across Los
Angeles, and I certainly don't want to become part of the problem.</LD>
<LD>   The issue is gangbangers killing anything that moves (or rather, I
should say, the problem is mishaps involving wayward youth). Whatever
you call it, you'd think we were in Dodge City, the way bullets are
flying in parts of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   And what are public officials and other luminaries worked up
about?</LD>
<TE>   Language. That's right. They're in a lather over the words being
used to describe a police crackdown on killers.</TE>
<TE>   Our story begins with Mayor Slim Jim Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   It's Thursday afternoon, and Times political editor Jim Newton
gets a phone call from the mayor, who isn't happy.</TE>
<TE>   Myself, I'll take Jim Hahn being angry any day. It's proof there's
a pulse.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's in a dither, as it turns out, over a Times headline that
said: City Declares War on Gangs.</TE>
<TE>   The city did no such thing, Hahn argued, claiming that he and LAPD
Chief Bill Bratton have been careful to avoid military metaphors.
After making his point, Hahn went away mad.</TE>
<TE>   Your tax dollars at work.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe this would be a more acceptable headline:</TE>
<TE>   City Peeved at Gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the fact that Bratton actually used the word "war" at
the press conference while Hahn stood there like fence board, here's
something to ponder: The headline appeared Dec. 4, and the mayor
called Dec. 12.</TE>
<TE>   We all knew this guy is slow off the mark, but did the man take an
eight-day nap?</TE>
<TE>   Actually, I'll tell you what happened. Hahn got some heat from
members of the African American community and a couple of liberal
do-gooders. John Mack of the Urban League and somebody from Magic
Johnson's development company met with Hahn to beef about this war
talk.</TE>
<TE>   They weren't the only ones stirring it up. Tony Muhammad, the
Nation of Islam's Western regional director, told The Times, "We are
with the police chief when he says, 'Get angry.' We are angry. But
how do you differentiate between a gangbanger and my brother?"</TE>
<TE>   If he doesn't know, maybe the cops should bring Tony and his
brother in for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   A mayor with the tiniest thread of courage would have told these
chaps he understands the racial implications and long-standing
concerns about cops storming South L.A. like Marines. Then he would
have asked his critics what the heck they were doing to save lives.</TE>
<TE>   Is John Mack throwing himself into the line of fire? Does Magic
Johnson think the road to peace is a string of Starbucks with his
name on the wall?</TE>
<TE>   Innocent bystanders are bleeding to death in the streets,
terrified parents are begging for help, and we've got a posse on the
lookout for insensitive language. Meanwhile, the mayor, making like a
tough guy, beats up on a newspaper hack.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Bratton, as I've said before, hasn't been here long enough
for any of us to know whether he's got any answers. My doubts grew
last week when I saw that he might hire John Miller, co-anchor of
ABC's "20-20," as his personal assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Walters wasn't available? As a TV reporter, Miller scored
a sit-down with Osama bin Laden and nodded like a Yankee bobble-head,
as if he understood a word of Arabic. He also spent 10 minutes
working as an NYPD flack, and co-wrote a quickie book on national
security. I'm sure that'll do him a lot of good at 103rd and Central.</TE>
<TE>   In fairness to Bratton, the guy has told us a dozen times that he
knows he can't make a difference by blitzing street corners with
paramilitary battalions. Gangs are flourishing because 6,000 things
have gone wrong, and Bratton has met with one community leader after
another asking for ideas and assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Does Bill Bratton talk too much?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so. But the bigger problem is that everyone else has so
little to say.</TE>
<TE>   I don't care whether Bratton calls it a war, and I don't care
whether he calls the bad guys morons. What matters is that he take
care of business, and he can't do it if everyone else who might make
a difference is standing on the sidelines, giving him grades on
political correctness.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn made a so-so recovery Friday when he told The Times he was
distressed about the murders of children and their grieving mothers.
He said he wants to make sure an overzealous LAPD doesn't alienate
the neighborhoods it has to work with to get the job done.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be careful about our choice of words here," he said.
"That is the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   No it isn't.</TE>
<TE>   We've had 600-plus homicides this year, half of them involving
gangs. The bottom line is that our so-called leaders have to put an
end to the carnage, by whatever legal means, and by whatever name.</TE>

<HD>For Ex-Supervisor, Principles and Cold Shoulders</HD>
<DH>Maria VanderKolk says her surprise visit in support of
Ahmanson project was 'the right thing to do.' To former friends,
she's a turncoat.</DH>

<LD>Maria VanderKolk flew 1,800 miles last week for three minutes of
redemption. But some old friends refused even to talk to her.</LD>
<LD>   VanderKolk was once the youngest supervisor in Ventura County
history and a darling of environmentalists. Her onetime allies
practically ran her out of town after she brokered a 1992 deal that
saved 10,000 acres of scenic hills but permitted construction of
3,050 homes on Ahmanson Ranch.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 38 now and an assistant city manager near Denver,
VanderKolk surprised even the project's developer when she returned
Tuesday to Ventura County -- paying her own way, she said -- to
endorse Ahmanson Ranch again.</LD>
<TE>   "It's sticking with your principles and sticking with the
decisions that you make that mark a true leader," she said before
testifying to the county Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   VanderKolk considers the development's dogged opponents -- once
her friends -- to be leaders. They consider her a turncoat.</TE>
<TE>   "She's nothing to me," Ahmanson critic Mary Wiesbrock said. "She's
just, like, worthless."</TE>
<TE>   In the eight years since VanderKolk left California, plans for the
$2-billion golf course community overlooking the San Fernando Valley
have been stalled in lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Its opponents warn that putting nearly 9,000 people on grazing
land would be disastrous to an area already cluttered with homes.
They want the developer, Washington Mutual Bank, to sell or donate
its 2,800 acres to enlarge the preserve that VanderKolk was
instrumental in establishing.</TE>
<TE>   At last week's hearing to evaluate Washington Mutual's plans for
protecting endangered frogs and flowers, VanderKolk was amazed to see
hundreds of people still turning out to debate Ahmanson Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where they came from," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the hearing room, VanderKolk sat next to her former deputy,
Lenora Kirby, who passed out jellybeans. Kirby runs Las Virgenes
Institute, a conservation organization created by Washington Mutual
that critics deride as a puppet for the developer.</TE>
<TE>   VanderKolk told the current supervisors she still considers the
land deal her greatest achievement, with the possible exception of
her two children. As she testified, Wiesbrock and other open-space
activists shook their heads.</TE>
<TE>   When she exceeded her three-minute limit, the activists tapped
their watches and shouted to the supervisors to cut her off. Several
tried to shove into VanderKolk's hands a packet they had prepared to
discredit her -- its headline: "A Betrayal of the Public Trust."</TE>
<TE>   VanderKolk politely declined. "I saw that. Thank you," she said,
fighting back tears. In the stack was a rudimentary flier from
VanderKolk's campaign for supervisor. She was 25 then and naive. Her
flier even misspelled the land as "Ahmerson."</TE>
<TE>   Wiesbrock tapped VanderKolk to run because she wanted someone to
challenge the incumbent, who supported plans to develop the Ahmanson
land and neighboring Jordan Ranch. VanderKolk had written a letter
critical of the Jordan project, and Wiesbrock noticed it in a
newspaper. Soon after, the young toy marketer took a sick day to
register her candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big mistake," Wiesbrock said this week.</TE>
<TE>   VanderKolk won that election by about 100 votes. Within two years
she was meeting then-Gov. Pete Wilson and working out the complex
compromise to preserve much of the mountain land and allow
development on the remainder.</TE>
<TE>   Four ranches involved in the deal are now part of the Santa Monica
Mountains National Recreation Area and the Santa Monica Mountains
Conservancy. About half of Ahmanson Ranch is also public parkland.
About $26 million in public money was spent on the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a compromise," Wiesbrock said. "It was a sellout."</TE>
<TE>   VanderKolk calls it a model deal that will smartly accommodate the
area's growth. "To me, if you're an elected official, it's your duty
to offer solutions," she said. "You can be against something, but, by
God, you'd better have an option. Don't just be against. Don't just
be a naysayer."</TE>
<TE>   As Ventura County supervisors continue to evaluate the Ahmanson
Ranch project, VanderKolk told them she returned to remind them the
parkland acquisition had been praised initially as a visionary deal.</TE>
<TE>   "She's not a politician -- she never was," Kirby said, "but she
did something very big. It made me proud all over again."</TE>
<TE>   VanderKolk still thinks about running for office again, maybe
Congress. But she is more content now with her "wonderful life" in
Arvada, Colo. She is the town's chief promoter and spokeswoman, and
her husband runs the family's hardware store. Next spring she will
spend a month in Europe on a fellowship to study government.</TE>
<TE>   Just before she boarded a plane Wednesday to fly the 900 miles
back to Colorado, VanderKolk said she was glad she had made the trip.
"I just thought it was the right thing to do," she said, "and I'm
really, really proud of how it went."</TE>

<HD>Bill Miller, 98; Vegas Hotels Entertainment Director, Club
Owner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Miller, an innovative Las Vegas hotel entertainment director who
booked Marlene Dietrich and Mae West into the Sahara Hotel's main
showroom in the 1950s and turned the concept of the staid lounge act
on its head when he booked the supercharged Louis Prima and Keely
Smith into the Sahara's Casbar Lounge, has died. He was 98.</LD>
<LD>   Miller, onetime owner of Bill Miller's Riviera, a top postwar
nightclub overlooking the Hudson River in Fort Lee, N.J., died of
natural causes Monday at his home in Palm Springs.</LD>
<LD>   A show business agent who had once been half of a vaudeville
dancing duo, Miller bought the Riviera in 1945.</LD>
<TE>   As an agent, he had booked many of his clients into the swank
nightclub's large showroom, and he had no trouble convincing one, the
popular crooner Tony Martin, to be his first headliner: He offered
Martin $10,000 a week, twice what he was getting at the Copacabana in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the biggest smash you ever saw," Miller told the Las Vegas
Review-Journal in 1999. Other headliners followed, including Dean
Martin and Jerry Lewis, Sammy Davis Jr., Tony Bennett and Frank
Sinatra.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Miller's Riviera was the place," Joey Bishop recalled
Friday. "It was up there with the Latin Quarter and the Copacabana."</TE>
<TE>   Bishop was working at the Latin Quarter in 1952 when Sinatra asked
if he would be his opening act for an engagement at Miller's club
across the river, thus beginning Bishop's longtime relationship with
Sinatra.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get to associate with the owners of clubs, but Bill was
more than just the owner of a nightclub; he was fun," Bishop said.
"You could do humor about him from the stage and he'd laugh as much
as the audience did. He was just a wonderful guy."</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1904 in Pinsk, Russia, Miller arrived in America with his
parents when he was a year old. (Miller said he never knew his real
last name, suspecting it fell victim to an immigration official's
mix-up on Ellis Island.)</TE>
<TE>   The family settled in Brooklyn before moving to New Jersey, where
Miller's father, an accomplished building tradesman, made a good
living.</TE>
<TE>   Hooked on vaudeville shows, Miller dropped out of high school to
pursue a career in show business.</TE>
<TE>   Learning to dance by watching the dancers on stage and then
practicing the steps at home, he linked up with another young dancer
and formed the duo of Miller and Peterson. They went on to play the
legendary Palace Theater, and Miller eventually assembled his own
successful musical comedy revue.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1929, after more than a decade, he had had enough of the
stage and became an agent.</TE>
<TE>   After Bill Miller's Riviera closed in 1953 to make way for the
Palisades Parkway, Miller bought a 10% interest in the Sahara Hotel
and was named entertainment director in 1953. With many top acts
being booked into the rival Sands Hotel, Miller told the
Review-Journal, "I had to start from scratch."</TE>
<TE>   The first act he booked was Ray Bolger, a dancer best known for
his role as the Scarecrow in "The Wizard of Oz."</TE>
<TE>   "The trouble with Ray Bolger was that nobody knew how to use him
in a nightclub act," Miller said. "He was a dancer. How many numbers
can you do?"</TE>
<TE>   So Miller created an act for Bolger, in which he served as master
of ceremonies of a variety show. Bolger, who did a dance before
introducing each act, was a hit.</TE>
<TE>   Miller went on to book Donald O'Connor, Marlene Dietrich and, in
1954, Mae West. Then 61 and off the screen for 11 years, West had
been touring with a not-so-successful stage revue.</TE>
<TE>   To give the onetime Hollywood sex symbol some Vegas pizazz, Miller
hired a group of male bodybuilders to appear with her on stage. Clad
only in bathing suits, the musclemen strutted and flexed as West
fluttered her false eyelashes and cracked wise.</TE>
<TE>   "I wrote her a song for the very finish," Miller said. "It went,
'I've got something for the girls: boys, boys, boys.' "</TE>
<TE>   West's buffed "boys" remained a staple of her stage act.</TE>
<TE>   In 1954, Miller offered one of his former clients, trumpet player
and singer Louis Prima, and his partner and wife, Keely Smith, a
seven-year deal to perform with their backup band, Sam Butera and the
Witnesses, in the Sahara's Casbar Lounge.</TE>
<TE>   When Prima expressed misgivings about working in the lounge,
Miller told Prima, "You're going to make more money than you ever
did."</TE>
<TE>   And, Miller recalled, "there was no one, ever, in the history of
show business, that did the business this man did. From midnight
until 6 in the morning, you could not get into that club. That really
was one of the biggest things that happened in Vegas.... All the
lounge acts started with Louis Prima."</TE>
<TE>   Miller left the Sahara in 1955 and bought an interest in the new
Dunes Hotel, where he worked as entertainment director. Working with
a tight budget, he booked "Smart Affairs," a show that started the
trend of Lido de Paris, the Follies Bergere and other big production
shows.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who later worked as entertainment director of the Flamingo
and International hotels, retired to Palm Springs in the mid-1970s.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his fourth wife, Denise; two daughters, Judith
Miller of New York and Susan Miller of Desert Hot Springs; a stepson,
Jerry Johnson of Pasadena; a sister; and two grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Nurses Say Union Win May Ease Shortages</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daren Briscoe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nurses and union officials celebrating Friday's decision by nurses at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to join the California Nurses Assn. said
Saturday that unionization may help to stem a statewide nursing
shortage.</LD>
<LD>   California has one of the worst such shortages in the country,
with a ratio of one nurse for every six patients at most hospitals.</LD>
<LD>   Many nurses say that they are overworked and that pension plans
and other benefits at the hospitals that employ them are too
expensive or are nonexistent.</LD>
<TE>   The union, which already represents a majority of the nurses in
Northern California, has been courting nurses at Cedars-Sinai for the
last year. Friday's close vote -- 695 in favor and 627 opposed,
according to union officials -- means that the two biggest private
hospitals in the West are now unionized.</TE>
<TE>   Cedars-Sinai, the largest, employs about 1,500 nurses in
non-managerial positions. Long Beach Memorial, where nurses voted to
join the union last month, employs about 1,300.</TE>
<TE>   "This will have a very strong ripple effect," said Liz Jacobs, a
union spokeswoman. Because Cedars-Sinai is so large and influential,
she said, the vote "will have a great impact on the standards of
nursing practice in California."</TE>
<TE>   At a celebratory breakfast Saturday at the nearby Jerry's Deli,
nurses talked about what they hoped to achieve through unionizing.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to get better pension benefits and medical insurance,"
said Mariano Mendoza, 59. Under the current pension plan, he said,
the hospital will match annual employee contributions only up to
$500. Mendoza wasn't sure what a pension plan negotiated by the union
would look like, but said, "It will all be in the contract."</TE>
<TE>   Carmelita del Mundo said that lower nurse-patient ratios would
improve both working conditions for nurses and the quality of patient
care.</TE>
<TE>   "I've worked at Cedars for 25 years, and they've had a long time
to do it better," she said. "Now we've got a union, and I hope other
hospitals will follow suit."</TE>
<TE>   At Long Beach Memorial, where there have been two nurses strikes
since November's unionization, nurses recently won improvements in
retirement benefits and a pay increase averaging 21% over three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials said that better pay and benefits could help
hospitals retain the many nurses who currently leave to work in home
health care or outpatient clinics.</TE>
<TE>   "The average age of registered nurses in California is 47," Jacobs
said. "To keep nurses in the profession until they turn 65, you've
got to have some incentive."</TE>
<TE>   Joao da Silva, 34, has worked at Cedars-Sinai for 2  1/2 years. He
said the same medical benefits his family is able to get through his
wife's job for $50 would cost him more than $300 under the medical
plan now offered at Cedars.</TE>
<TE>   With the vote to unionize, Da Silva said, he expects a better
benefits package and more job security.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what he would have done if the vote had failed, Da Silva was
blunt. "My contract is up in February, and I'd be out of here," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Law School Claws Its Way to Big Leagues</HD>
<DH>It took seven years for the Chapman institution to get
accredited. Now, $31-million endowment is helping bring in top
students and faculty.</DH>

<LD>There's an old joke law school deans like to tell: What does it take
to create a law school as well-known and respected as Harvard?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: $300 million. And 300 years.</LD>
<LD>   Parham Williams likes to repeat it because, as dean of Chapman
University's School of Law, he believes it embraces the ambitious
goals he has set for the 7-year-old institution he's nursed back to
health from a troubled beginning: excellence, built brick by brick
over the long haul.</LD>
<TE>   "Starting a law school from ground zero is a huge undertaking,"
said the 71-year-old educator, whose former students include author
John Grisham and Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.). "We learned that you have
to have a blueprint to build a house, a road map to find out where
you are going."</TE>
<TE>   When the former University of Mississippi dean was hired by
Chapman in 1997, its law school was struggling two years after it
opened.</TE>
<TE>   The campus in Orange had been denied provisional approval by the
American Bar Assn., which criticized the level of the school's
students, its weak academic standards and "lax approach" to grading.
Applications were in a tailspin. Perhaps most damaging was a lawsuit
brought by students who claimed they were misled into thinking ABA
approval for Chapman was imminent; the suit eventually led to $1.25
million in tuition refunds.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of naivete about what it meant to have an
ABA-accredited operation," said Joanne Telerico, an associate dean
who was brought in by Williams shortly after he arrived to improve,
among other things, student recruiting and job-placement efforts.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, Chapman received the ABA's seal of approval, capping a
turnaround fueled by a $31-million endowment and aggressive national
recruiting of top students and faculty.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman's Law School Admission Test (LSAT) scores for 2002 place
it in the top third of the nation's 187 accredited law schools, up
from the bottom third in 1996. The goal is to reach the top 20%
within three years.</TE>
<TE>   Since Williams came aboard, Chapman's law library has grown by
110,000 volumes. New professors include two who held prestigious
posts clerking for U.S. Supreme Court justices. Applications have
surged more than fourfold in five years, and those for next fall are
on track to nearly double. Last summer, 71% of graduates passed the
California bar exam on the first try, up from 40% in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman hopes to achieve a national reputation by selling itself
as a place where a quality legal education can be had with a personal
touch that can't be found in the cavernous lecture halls of the
big-name lawyer factories.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Telerico and other recruiters took Chapman's story to
131 student events in 30 states, from UC Berkeley to Boston College.
Fourteen percent of Chapman's students come from out of state, but
the school hopes to raise that number to 50% as word of its ABA
approval spreads.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a branding thing," Telerico said. "We want people to know
what Chapman is. The university has been around for 141 years, but
the name of Chapman is not recognized outside the West as well as
we'd like it to be. ... We want to defy the standard thinking that
you have to be old to be good."</TE>
<TE>   Recruiters tell prospective applicants about Chapman's $32-million
law school building, which opened in 1999. They tell them how this
year's 372 students enjoy easy access to professors. They trot out
the ABA accreditation.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, they bring up the scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Chapman dramatically increased its spending on
scholarships to entice students with good test scores. This year, 29%
of all tuition and fees were paid with scholarship money, about twice
the amount at the average law school, according to the ABA.</TE>
<TE>   That's drawing students, for whom "debt management" is as much a
part of law school as a contracts class -- especially at a school
such as Chapman, where the tuition is $24,250 this year.</TE>
<TE>   Heather Armstrong, a 26-year-old scholarship student from San
Bernardino, scored in the top 10% on the LSAT entrance exam. She was
accepted at law schools at the University of Texas, Loyola Marymount
and William &amp; Mary.</TE>
<TE>   Texas offered her a scholarship: $5,000. Chapman offered to pay
the entire cost, provided she keep her grades high.</TE>
<TE>   She chose Chapman.</TE>
<TE>   "Chapman some day will have a really good reputation," Armstrong
said. "Plus, they bought us. That's the way they get a lot of
top-flight students. I could go a hundred grand in debt, or I could
come here."</TE>
<TE>   There's more to lure students. She and others talk about the
quality and energy of a younger-than-average faculty who know them by
their first names, and about being part of the school's rebirth.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel like you're breaking new ground here," said Will Hagin,
26, of Santa Ana. "It's exciting to be part of something that you
know is going to be big in a few years."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Lang was convinced of that as well. That's why the
professor left the University of Maine law school to join Chapman
this fall to start an advanced-degree program in tax law, one of only
24 in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought of this as an entrepreneurial activity," Lang said.
"It's a bit of a challenge. I've got to go out and market a program
without having the advantage of the university having a big name
already."</TE>
<TE>   The chance to work at the educational equivalent of a start-up
company is what attracts faculty applicants to Chapman, Dean Williams
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It appeals to younger people," he said. "Here, you can be part of
the building process, and your ideas will become an important part of
what this place becomes."</TE>

<LD>There's an old joke law school deans like to tell: What does it take
to create a law school as well-known and respected as Harvard?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: $300 million. And 300 years.</LD>

<TE>   Chapman's Law School Admission Test (LSAT) scores for 2002 place
it in the top third of the nation's 187 accredited law schools, up
from the bottom third in 1996. The goal is to reach the top 20%
within three years, which would put Chapman's law school in the
league with those at American University, Rutgers and Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   Since Williams came aboard, Chapman's law library has grown by
110,000 volumes. New professors include two who held prestigious
posts clerking for U.S. Supreme Court justices. Applications have
surged more than fourfold in the last five years, and those for next
fall are on track to nearly double. Last summer, 71% of graduates
passed the California bar exam on the first try, up from 40% in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they've turned the corner," said Newport Beach attorney
Andrew Guilford, a former California Bar Assn. president who for
years has promoted the need for a nationally known law school in
Orange County. "A county with 3 million people deserves the
opportunity for a first-rate legal education. Chapman has gone a long
way to provide that."</TE>
<TE>   Chapman is not the first law school in Orange County. Western
State University College of Law opened in Fullerton in 1966. Whittier
Law School arrived in Costa Mesa in 1997. Both are ABA accredited.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman hopes to achieve a national reputation by selling itself
as a place where a quality legal education can be had with a personal
touch that can't be found in the cavernous lecture halls of the
big-name lawyer factories.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard nothing but good things," said former student Denis
Bilodeau, who, with a pregnant wife and the law school's future
uncertain, quit Chapman in its dark days and took a $22,000 tuition
refund. "The faculty is of a much higher quality than it was before.
And they have a much better facility now. When I was going there, we
were in a strip mall."</TE>
<TE>   Bilodeau, a civil engineer who is on the board of the Orange
County Transportation Authority and the Orange County Water District,
credits Williams and his high standards for Chapman's comeback.</TE>
<TE>   "He basically came in and said [a percentage] of you are going to
fail your classes. He put a heavy grading curve in there," Bilodeau
said. "They needed a guy like him. He wasn't the most popular guy at
first, but he got the job done."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Telerico and other recruiters took Chapman's story to
131 student events in 30 states, from UC Berkeley to Boston College.
Fourteen percent of Chapman's students come from out of state, but
the school hopes to raise that to 50% as word of its ABA approval

that's dynamic. They see a vision for the school and they make you
see it too."</TE>

<TE>   "It appeals to younger people," he said. "Here, you can be part of
the building process and your ideas will become an important part of
what this place becomes."</TE>
<TE>   Thirty or more professors are interviewed for each faculty hire.
On a recent day, candidate Melissa Berry, who teaches at the
University of Washington's law school, gave what's known in the
business as a "job talk" to a gathering of Chapman's faculty.</TE>
<TE>   Her topic: Whether there's clearly established federal law
regarding the proportionality of sentences handed out in
non-death-penalty cases. The hourlong session was part of her tryout.
Professors peppered her with questions, and later voted on her
performance.</TE>
<TE>   "What's exciting to me is that it's a new school ... still in the
policy forming stage," Berry said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "At an old school, when you're a junior member of the faculty, you
don't have much of a say about anything. Here, a lot of young people
are coming from different places, full of energy and they're helping
to shape the school."</TE>

<LD>A mother and son can grow unusually close living together in a
trailer for 21 years.</LD>
<LD>   And then, when the woman who adopted you at birth begins to slide
away in her 70s and dies, and leaves you grieving for the only real
family you had left, the sense of loss can be pulverizing.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe that sadness is stoking the anger Jeffrey Smith is feeling
these days. Maybe, as more time flows since his mother's death 32
days ago, he'll see things differently. But when he tells me that the
anger still gurgles and then explains why, I can feel it.</LD>
<TE>   Smith's story comes from the other side of the tracks -- from a
guy, now 34, who's lived since he was 13 in a 35-foot trailer with
his mother, Eunice. It's a life many of us might think of as nomadic,
but Smith says he's lived at only three sites during 21 years in the
family trailer.</TE>
<TE>   In September 1996, Smith and mother moved to the Ponderosa mobile
home and RV park in Garden Grove. From there you can see Crystal
Cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   Eunice Smith survived a quadruple bypass three years ago, but
showed signs of Alzheimer's earlier this year, and ultimately lost
her will to live, her son says. On Nov. 13, at 78, she died in an
Anaheim hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Five days later, Jeff buried his mother. The next day, Ponderosa
management gave him a letter expressing sympathy for his mother's
death, but also notifying him he had to leave the first week in
December or face eviction.</TE>
<TE>   Smith was incensed. Although he'd lived permanently in the park
with his mother and had signed various other papers with her, only
her name appeared on the contract. Jeff Smith had no legal right to
remain, Ponderosa said, even though for the entire six years of his
mother's stay, the monthly bills were sent to "Smith, Eunice and
Jeff" and all the rent checks were drawn on mother and son's joint
checking account.</TE>
<TE>   "I never had any problems whatsoever, and the day after Mom's
funeral they hand me an eviction notice," Smith says. "They didn't
have to do what they did, but for me to fight it would have taken
more energy and resources than I had available, and they knew it."</TE>
<TE>   My phone call to Ponderosa management went unreturned. I drove out
there, but was unable to find anyone at the management office. An RV
resident I spoke to said tenants seldom see the manager and have
difficulty even arranging meetings with her. The resident didn't know
Smith, but said trailer owners believe new management is targeting
long-term tenants for eviction, for reasons they can only speculate
about.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last six months, we've felt totally intimidated and
helpless," the resident says, insisting on remaining anonymous. "No
one cares to see management come to their door, because you know they
aren't coming down to invite you to a party in the clubhouse."</TE>
<TE>   The owners of mobile homes aren't blessed with a multitude of
tenant rights; they have fewer than the owners of the manufactured
homes that are less easily moved, says a state Senate Housing
Committee consultant.</TE>
<TE>   But what happened to Smith stinks to high heaven.</TE>
<TE>   Smith could have gone to court and argued that his long-term
residence entitled him to stay. Maybe he'd win.</TE>
<TE>   But, not emotionally up for a fight so soon after his mother's
death, he left.</TE>
<TE>   Smith has stored his trailer -- the home he helped his adoptive
parents design (his father died in 1986) and the only one he's had
since. In time, he'll probably sell it.</TE>
<TE>   Smith now rents an apartment and duels with both anger and
sadness.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not past it," he said last week of his ouster. "I hate it.
They basically told me I had to get out of the house I had been in
with my mom."</TE>

<HD>Staggered by Quake, Tiny Town in Ventura County Is Back on
Its Feet</HD>
<DH>Piru, whose downtown shops were closed after the 1994
temblor, is attracting new residents and business interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Suzie St. John</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Monica Nolan thinks of Piru as Ventura County's best-kept secret --
one she hopes won't last much longer.</LD>
<LD>   As an analyst for the county's Redevelopment Agency, Nolan has
spent three years working to revive the tiny community hit hard by
the 1994 Northridge earthquake.</LD>
<LD>   The 6.7-magnitude temblor closed Piru's quaint downtown of fewer
than a dozen shops. Some businesses moved into trailers while waiting
for repairs.</LD>
<TE>   Others packed up, leaving residents without necessities such as a
bank and a market.</TE>
<TE>   Fast forward nearly nine years, and Nolan's efforts can be seen
throughout the community, which has grown by 700 residents since the
quake to 1,800 today.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are finally starting to pop for Piru," Nolan said.</TE>
<TE>   The changes include a renovated inn with a restaurant, an ice
cream shop, new housing subdivisions, a dude ranch and a town square
that officially opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony Saturday. "The
town square is truly the foundation upon which this community is
being rebuilt, and it will only go uphill from here," Supervisor
Kathy Long said.</TE>
<TE>   There is a second new restaurant in the works, and the Fillmore
and Western dinner train will begin running to Piru next year,
connecting it with the nearby towns of Fillmore and Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   A railroad spokesman said no start date has been set, but March is
the target.</TE>
<TE>   Trains will stop at the yellow-and-red depot that is the
centerpiece of Piru's new town square. It will also serve as a
visitors center.</TE>
<TE>   The community's town square, seven acres of abandoned railroad
property, includes a bandstand pavilion, restrooms, fountain,
parking, picnic tables, benches and a pedestrian and bike path.</TE>
<TE>   The $1.7-million project, funded by grant and loan programs, had
been in the planning for three years, with construction starting last
January.</TE>
<TE>   "There are three main ideas behind the town square," Nolan said.
"First is to create more retail space for the town; second is that it
will be an entry point for visitors; and third is that it provides a
town meeting place for the community."</TE>
<TE>   She believes that the changes give Piru a chance to revive
economically.</TE>
<TE>   "We used the town square project to show private investors that
there is opportunity in this town," Nolan said.</TE>
<TE>   One person who could see the silver lining was Tim Cohen. In the
last two years, the Camarillo resident has bought a 6,000-acre ranch
nearby and restored the town's white-columned hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "I could see the Redevelopment Agency was putting a lot of
attention to Piru," said Cohen, whose family has been in the
thoroughbred racehorse business for 35 years. "After evaluating the
ranch ... and the inn, I knew they could be economically viable."</TE>
<TE>   The first of Cohen's visions became reality in October, when the
Heritage Valley Inn opened.</TE>
<TE>   The inn was built in 1888 as a second home to Piru founder David
C. Cook, who built the Piru mansion as his first residence.</TE>
<TE>   For many years it was known as the Piru Hotel, then Mountain View
Hotel and finally Round Rock Hotel before becoming a home for the
elderly in the 1950s. It closed in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen has now converted the 15-bedroom, three-bath establishment
into an inn with 11 bedrooms, 12 bathrooms and a full-service dining
room.</TE>
<TE>   The taupe-colored building with white trim and a wrap-around porch
helps anchor downtown at Main and Center streets.</TE>
<TE>   The inn's restaurant is open Friday, Saturday and Sunday. However,
manager Jeff Thomas said that he expects the schedule to expand as
business picks up.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping the train will bring more people out here and
finally make Piru a destination," Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   The inn also ties in with Cohen's plans for the ranch called
Rancho Temescal.</TE>
<TE>   Located about two miles east of town, it's a working cattle and
horse ranch that Cohen is opening up to guests.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful, beautiful piece of land," Cohen said. "I think
it's great to save open space, but it's also great to share it."</TE>
<TE>   Visitors can ride horses or harvest fruit from ranch orchards.
They may also herd and brand cattle.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be a very hands-on, working-ranch experience," Cohen
said.</TE>
<TE>   The dude ranch should be fully operational by the end of January,
Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen said he has hired about 20 people, most of them from Piru.</TE>
<TE>   The town's housing is also on the rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate agent Brian Guevara said homes built in the mid- to
late '90s sell for nearly $300,000, and prices for small, older homes
are in the $100,000 range.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Piru is one of the last diamonds in the rough," he said.
"You can buy a house in Piru for a little over $100,000, with the
same house costing closer to $200,000 in Ventura."</TE>
<TE>   Nolan said Habitat for Humanity is building 22 homes, and a
60-townhome project is also in the works.</TE>

<LD>Monica Nolan thinks of Piru as Ventura County's best-kept secret --
one she hopes won't last much longer.</LD>
<LD>   As an analyst for the county's Redevelopment Agency, Nolan has
spent three years working to revive the tiny community hit hard by
the 1994 Northridge earthquake.</LD>
<LD>   The 6.7-magnitude temblor closed Piru's quaint downtown of fewer
than a dozen shops. Some businesses moved into trailers while waiting
for repairs. Others packed up, leaving residents without necessities
such as a bank and a market.</LD>
<TE>   Fast forward nearly nine years, and Nolan's efforts can be seen
throughout the community, which has grown by 700 residents since the
quake to 1,800 today.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are finally starting to pop for Piru," Nolan said.</TE>
<TE>   The changes include a renovated inn with a restaurant, an ice
cream shop, new housing subdivisions, a dude ranch and a town square
that officially opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony Saturday. "The
town square is truly the foundation upon which this community is
being rebuilt, and it will only go uphill from here," Supervisor
Kathy Long said.</TE>
<TE>   There is a second new restaurant in the works, and the Fillmore
and Western dinner train will begin running to Piru next year,
connecting it with the nearby towns of Fillmore and Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   A railroad spokesman said no start date has been set, but March is
the target.</TE>
<TE>   Trains will stop at the yellow-and-red depot that is the

<HD>Animal Activist Finds Himself in Rat's Nest of Legal
Trouble</HD>
<DH>He is accused of feeding vitamins to rodents to counter the
poison that the U.S. is using to kill the nonnative animals. He could
go to prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rob Puddicombe figured he was annoying the National Park Service, but
he didn't think officials would make a federal case out of it.</LD>
<LD>   That miscalculation could now mean a year in prison for him. The
charge -- feeding vitamins to rats.</LD>
<LD>   "These people hate me," Puddicombe said. "And they want to keep me
off the islands."</LD>
<TE>   A bus driver and environmental activist from Santa Barbara,
Puddicombe is an uncommon crusader with an unusual obsession --
saving the black rats of the Channel Islands. He is accused of
sailing a 10-foot inflatable boat last year across the channel to
Anacapa Island, which actually is three small islands, to distribute
pellets containing vitamin K to the rat population.</TE>
<TE>   Park service rangers have been feeding the rats something very
different -- rodent poison -- and they say the vitamin K distribution
was designed to counteract the extermination effort. Puddicombe was
charged with illegally feeding animals and interfering with agency
functions. His trial is scheduled for Feb. 20.</TE>
<TE>   At issue are two starkly opposed views of the proper relationship
between people and animals -- or at least man and rat.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a case here of someone trying to circumvent the efforts
of scientists to eradicate what they have determined to be an
environmental pest," said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S.
attorney's office in Los Angeles. "A lot of time and effort went into
this project, and he is accused of trying to undo what they started.
He is interfering."</TE>
<TE>   Park officials say they need to get rid of the rats, which are not
native to the islands, to protect several native species,
particularly a small seabird called the Xantus's murrelet, whose eggs
the rodents devour.</TE>
<TE>   "The Channel Islands are a special place because they provide a
haven for creatures that appear nowhere else," said Kate Faulkner,
chief of natural resources management at Channel Islands National
Park. "There are lots of places for rats, and not many for
murrelets."</TE>
<TE>   Puddicombe believes that park rangers have no right to choose
which animals should live and which should die.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a topsy-turvy world when poisoning wildlife from helicopters
is a good thing and feeding wildlife is a crime," he said. "As far as
I'm concerned, this is like ethnic cleansing; it's a jihad against
nonnative species."</TE>
<TE>   "I love underdogs, and rodents are the underdogs of the animal
kingdom," he added. "A mouse or rat is just as valuable as an
elephant. It's just as smart and has the same feelings."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute echoes similar controversies that have dogged
campaigns to eliminate predators, from seagulls to snakes, that
threaten native species in isolated ecosystems such as those on
islands. In the case of the Channel Islands, park service officials
are in the middle of a complex ecological juggling act, trying to
remove rats, pigs and golden eagles to restore the five-island park
to its original condition.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows when the first rat scurried onto the islands. Some
say the rodents arrived after the paddle steamer Winfield Scott ran
aground between Middle and East Anacapa islands in 1853. Others say
the first rat presence was recorded in 1939.</TE>
<TE>   On Anacapa the numbers of the rodents, which are native to Europe
and grow to about 14 inches long, have ranged up to an estimated
3,000. (The rats also live on San Miguel Island, but are not
considered a problem there and have not been poisoned.)</TE>
<TE>   "They eat smaller eggs, and they will eat newly hatched chicks,"
said Paul Collins, curator of vertebrate zoology at the Santa Barbara
Museum of Natural History, who has studied the rats.</TE>
<TE>   Among the eggs the rats like to munch are those of the petite,
black and white Xantus's murrelet, which nests only on Santa Barbara
and Anacapa islands and is a candidate for listing as a threatened
species, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Puddicombe, 52, doesn't buy it. He says the $2-million rat project
is an example of the park service's demonizing, and then
annihilating, an animal to return the islands to some murky,
idealized past.</TE>
<TE>   "How far do they want to go back? To the Chumash? The pre-Chumash?
The Cretaceous era?" he asked, sitting on a patch of beach near
Ventura that he likes to call his "office."</TE>
<TE>   Quiet, informed and intense, Puddicombe is an Eagle Scout who grew
up in a military family and moved around the country before landing
in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   He worked as a diver on offshore oil platforms in the North Sea
and the Gulf of Mexico. Later he dove for abalone off Santa Barbara
and volunteered as a seabird rehabilitator.</TE>
<TE>   "Rob is a very sensitive guy who hates to see animals suffer,"
said June Taylor, who runs a seabird rescue center in Santa Barbara
and has 18 pelicans in her backyard pond. "He rescues seabirds and
brings them to me. I am not really surprised to hear about the rats.
He meant well."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Puddicombe was aghast at the extermination plan. "When I
heard they were dropping poison I got involved," he said, gazing out
at Anacapa, finely etched against the blue horizon. "There is
something for everyone to hate about this project."</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the poison intended to kill rats is also killing the
Anacapa deer mouse, a species found only on the island. They also
maintain that there is no evidence the rat has damaged the murrelet
population.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel these charges against Mr. Puddicombe are clearly
retaliatory," said Michael Makarian, president of the New York-based
Fund for Animals. "The agency is upset that anyone has expressed
dissent over their plans to bomb an entire ecosystem with poison."
The group recently joined with Puddicombe in asking the government to
declare the Anacapa deer mouse an endangered species and stop the
poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   The park service said hundreds of deer mice were taken off the
island before the extermination campaign and are being reintroduced
as the poisoning is finished. And they say they have videos of rats
munching decoy eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Puddicombe spent a year successfully filing Freedom of Information
Act requests seeking memos, e-mails and reports from government
agencies and companies involved in the poisoning. He formed the
Channel Islands Animal Protection Assn. last year as a self-appointed
guardian of island creatures.</TE>
<TE>   The group sued the park service last year to try to stop the
poisoning, but the case was thrown out by a federal court in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "He did a spectacular piece of research in tracking down the
details of this project," said Ken Palley, president of the Santa
Barbara Surfrider Foundation, which opposes the extermination. "Rob
is a reasonable guy. He's no loose cannon. It's like when Mahatma
Gandhi and Martin Luther King went up against government agencies --
he put his body on the line."</TE>
<TE>   Puddicombe decided to act in October of last year. Prosecutors
said he sailed an inflatable boat 11 miles across the Santa Barbara
Channel to Anacapa and fed rats food laced with vitamin K. The poison
the park service uses prevents blood from clotting, effectively
causing rats to bleed to death internally. The vitamin interferes
with that process. Puddicombe said he won't comment on the incident
until his trial.</TE>
<TE>   Park rangers saw Puddicombe and a second man identified as
40-year-old Robert Crawford of Goleta wearing large backpacks and
sitting on a trail, throwing something, said Mrozek of the U.S.
attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicious park staff members smelled a rat and later found nearly
5 pounds of vitamin pellets scattered over the island. By then, the
two men were back in the boat and trying to get underway.</TE>
<TE>   "But the boat broke down," Mrozek said.</TE>
<TE>   As the men waited for help, rangers concluded that they were
connected to the pellets. Both were cited with misdemeanor offenses.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford pleaded guilty to feeding wildlife and interfering with
agency functions. He was sentenced to two years' probation, told to
keep off the islands for two years and ordered to pay $200 in
restitution, Mrozek said.</TE>
<TE>   Puddicombe refused to deal and insisted on a trial, hoping that
the public would be as outraged as he was over the rat killing.</TE>
<TE>   But his efforts may have been in vain. Park service officials have
finished dropping poison. By the time the trial starts, they
estimate, the rats will have been eradicated.</TE>
<TE>   Puddicombe shook his head. "This," he said, "is barbaric."</TE>

<LD>Two Ventura County men were arrested on suspicion of stabbing a
21-year-old Oxnard resident in a Ventura parking lot late Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Jessie White, 21, of Ventura and John Inselman, 21, of
Camarillo approached Jason O'Rourke as he was sitting in a parked car
at Seaward Avenue and Pierpont Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   The three men began arguing, prompting O'Rourke to get out of the
car. O'Rourke was stabbed several times in the upper torso, police
said, but his injuries were not considered life-threatening. He was
taken to Ventura County Medical Center.</LD>
<TE>   The alleged assailants were caught at a nearby liquor store,
police said.</TE>

<HD>Law Students' Talks Turn Into Trials by Fire</HD>
<DH>Panel of judges proves to be a tough audience for Fullerton
classmates discussing human rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zahra Khoury thought gaining the trust of Iraqis who had fled their
homeland and were now living in Southern California was the most
difficult part of her project on international human rights law.</LD>
<LD>   It took dozens of meetings and hours of coaxing before any would
even talk to the Fullerton law student. And the goal was getting them
to speak candidly of their lives in a country whose government has
jailed relatives of those living abroad who speak against the regime.</LD>
<LD>   But Saturday, as Khoury presented her findings to a panel at
Western State University College of Law in Fullerton, she discovered
that a grilling by three seasoned judges can be even tougher.</LD>
<TE>   Khoury's presentation on the state of human rights in Iraq was one
of four given by students in a course taught by Orange County
Superior Court Judge Nho Trong Nguyen. The course is the school's
first on international human rights law.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen said putting the students before judges gives them valuable
experience lawyers must have.</TE>
<TE>   "They may have been flustered," Nguyen said, "but it's good for
them."</TE>
<TE>   The trio of judges quickly created a climate another student
described as "adversarial" by peppering Khoury with questions during
her half-hour presentation: What would she do to solve Iraq's
problems? What actions should the United Nations undertake?</TE>
<TE>   Khoury tugged at her electric-blue suit jacket and looked
pleadingly at Nguyen after one inquiry. After another, she turned
away and moaned, "Oh, God." Such tough questions were unexpected but
helpful, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought they would listen to my whole presentation, then maybe
ask a couple things," Khoury said. "I didn't think they would drill
me. But as embarrassed as I was when I didn't know the answers, I
think it was obvious how much I cared for the people I talked to."</TE>
<TE>   The other student presentations were on Iran, Vietnam and Myanmar,
known as Burma before 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Juvenile Court Judge John Flynn, one of the more demanding
interrogators, said the questions were intended to gauge the
students' quick-thinking skills, not humble them.</TE>
<TE>   "To shift and keep moving like you're on an ice floe, that's what
it takes to be a good lawyer," he said. "When I'm asking hard
questions, I'm trying to get to the root of what they believe. I'm
testing the limits of how deep the passion for that cause lies in
their hearts."</TE>
<TE>   After a presentation on Iran with five other students, Josh Light
said the judges' questions about how they would change the situation
were aggravating.</TE>
<TE>   "It was this adversarial approach, which we totally didn't
expect," Light said. "Policymakers around the world don't have
answers to these questions, and we're just law students who've
studied these countries for a couple months."</TE>
<TE>   State Appellate Court Judge Eileen C. Moore said that even if the
students didn't know how they would fix injustices, their passion was
moving. "None of them know what the solution is, but they all still
have hope," she said. "It makes me optimistic that these horrible
things will end someday."</TE>

<HD>Top-Secret Nuclear Lab Will Welcome Students</HD>
<DH>Scientists at Sandia, conducting the nation's latest
weapons research, will teach classes leading to a master's degree.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michelle Munn</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>LIVERMORE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The squat beige buildings in this Bay Area suburb contain some of the
most secretive nuclear weapons research on the planet. But come
January, officials here will start sharing information with a special
class of scholars.</LD>
<LD>   A group of plasma physicists, nuclear engineers and cyber-sleuths
at Sandia National Laboratories will begin teaching courses leading
to the nation's first master's degree in National Security and Public
Safety.</LD>
<LD>   The University of New Haven, a Connecticut school offering
graduate course work in forensic science from a branch campus in
Sacramento, will serve as the lab's education organizer and
authorizer.</LD>
<TE>   Master's program students -- many of whom already work at Sandia,
at the adjacent Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory or as
government contractors -- will receive the kind of practical,
hands-on experience that research labs and intelligence agencies
crave, proponents say.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Hartwig, Sandia's group leader for information security,
said Sandia is the target of more than 100 attacks on its computer
network daily.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the stewards of the nation's nuclear weapons supply, and
we need to understand these attacks," Hartwig said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a program we have in place to provide expertise for the
next generation to work in the Department of Defense, Sandia and the
Department of Energy."</TE>
<TE>   Sandia is an Energy Department research center operated by the
Lockheed Martin Corp. It has a large facility in Albuquerque and a
smaller one in Livermore that supports the weapons work of the
Lawrence Livermore lab. Sandia engineers design 97% of the 6,500
components in every nuclear weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Students will sit down to banks of computer monitors in portable
classrooms starting Jan. 6 and bring their own experience and skill
to the national security issues of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 23 applicants accepted thus far, two have doctorates and 12
have master's degrees, ranging from engineering and computer science
to criminal justice and law, said New Haven Dean Paul Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Among the courses will be "Introduction to Practical Issues in
Cryptography" and "Computer Viruses and Malicious Code." Course work
will focus on securing the homeland and combating bioterrorism and
cyber-terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of what will be taught will be open information," said
Sheryl Stewart, team leader of education and training at Sandia. "But
when you put it together, it might be more privileged information."</TE>
<TE>   Because the nation is on high alert for terrorist attacks, Sandia
will conduct background checks on prospective students, and only U.S.
citizens will be admitted. Some scientific and intelligence experts
say the degree offers the right exposure to the national
laboratories' scientific staff so they better understand the social
issues underlying national security.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Demchak, a professor of cyberspace policy at the University
of Arizona and head of the International Security and Arms Control
section within the American Political Science Assn., sees the
citizenship requirement as a surrogate screening mechanism, which
could protect the course material and participants.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the course titles, they suggest some sensitive
material will be taught and the folks are probably worried about
re-creating the flying lessons fiasco of past years, where the 9/11
terrorists learned just enough to fly big jets into buildings,"
Demchak said. "A potential attacker does not need to know how the
whole system works, just where the cracks are, in order to gain
advantage."</TE>
<TE>   But others question the decision to bar foreign nationals.</TE>
<TE>   Louise Comfort, a professor of organizational theory and crisis
management at the University of Pittsburgh, suggested that the policy
sends the wrong message to foreign nationals.</TE>
<TE>   "They are using U.S. citizenship as a filter for loyalty," Comfort
said. "The balance between security and civil liberties is difficult.
But blanket categorization is a poor way to go. It's the worst kind
of profiling imaginable."</TE>
<TE>   One master's student is John Berry, a 45-year-old video
conferencing manager at Sandia. He has a bachelor's degree in
computer science from Cal State Hayward and plans to remain at Sandia
after the course.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly at Sandia it has a minimal short-term impact," Berry
said. "But long term, the degree -- with all the hoopla around the
homeland defense stuff -- it seems to be where the country is going."</TE>

<HD>Heavy Rain Soaks Northern California</HD>
<DH>Storm drops as much as 9 inches of rain in 24 hours,
causing problems throughout the region. Series of showers begins
moving into Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Cara Mia DiMassa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Heavy rain and high winds continued to pound Northern California on
Saturday, causing weather-related problems throughout the region,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Water-soaked Northern Californians braced for high winds, flood
warnings and even more wet weather, as Southern California prepared
for the first onslaught of storms.</LD>
<LD>   "It's unbelievable," said Gerard Giudice, general manager of
Ristorante Giorgio in Greenbrae, about 15 minutes north of San
Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   "There are trees blowing down all over the place, and some of our
employees can't get to work. It's a disaster, literally. It's as
heavy as we have seen it in a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Although Northern Californians got a bit of a midday respite from
rains that have been drenching the area since late Thursday, storm
problems seemed to be everywhere. They ranged from a tornado warning
issued Saturday morning after a rotating funnel was spotted on the
waters off Cape Mendocino to mudslides and fallen trees that caused
traffic backups in Marin, Napa and Sonoma counties.</TE>
<TE>   High wind advisories were issued throughout Northern California,
and wind gusts in some areas reached 50 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen some things out there that I haven't seen in 18 years
in business here," said Dave Reynolds, owner of Cloverdale Cyclery.
The city of Cloverdale, in Sonoma County, reported more than 10
inches of rain from Thursday night to Saturday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen streets signs flapping, water coming up onto the
sidewalks and cars that looked like they were going to float down the
street," Reynolds said.</TE>
<TE>   The storm, which dropped as much as 9 inches of rain in 24 hours,
is the first of three storms thought to be the remnants of Typhoon
Pongonsa that are expected within the next week. The typhoon wreaked
havoc on Guam earlier this month, causing the territory's governor to
ask for federal disaster relief.</TE>
<TE>   As for the forecast for Northern California, "Pretty much, it's
going to be a rainy week," said Diana Henderson of the National
Weather Service.</TE>
<TE>   Weather officials said they expected many Northern California
rivers, including the Napa, Russian, Garcia and Navarro, to flood in
some areas late Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers endured slight delays at San Francisco International
Airport, which was buffeted by steady rain and winds gusting at about
35 mph. Flights were running as much as an hour behind schedule, said
the airport manager, Dennis Neves.</TE>
<TE>   Flights at Oakland International Airport were not affected, said
Jerry Bell, operations coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E reported as many as 280,000 customers without power
throughout Northern and Central California on Saturday. Spokesman
Jason Alderman said that customers north of San Francisco Bay and
along the coasts had been the hardest hit.</TE>
<TE>   Power failures also were reported in the Reno area, where winds
gusted as high as 90 mph. At the Nugget Hotel in Sparks, Nev., the
lights in the lobby kept flickering on and off, and table candles
were being distributed to guests. The hotel's kitchen crew had
prepared 3,000 banquet dinners for Christmas parties to be held there
Saturday night, and the staff spent part of the day wondering whether
guests would be able to leave their homes to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Bender, a Sacramento investment banker, said that, on his
drive into Sparks along Interstate 80, he had seen billboards blown
out, an overturned tractor-trailer and an outhouse on its side.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, a spokesman for the National Weather
Service said the storm that hit Saturday night is expected to drop
less than an inch of rain and move through quickly.</TE>
<TE>   But another storm should arrive Monday, with heavier rain Tuesday,
tapering off Wednesday. Rain is expected again next weekend, as are
high surf at west-facing beaches and some flooding in Southern
California coastal areas. Snow will fall at elevations above 7,000
feet.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Larry Collins of the Los Angeles County Fire Department said
an action plan is being developed for the areas that were burned over
by fires over the summer.</TE>
<TE>   When storms start, Collins said, "materials will begin sliding off
into slopes. It pushes loose soil and ash into the canyons. When it
comes, it comes like a flash flood. It will scour trees as well as
neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   The department has organized rescue teams to be on call near
fire-damaged areas, including Azusa, Glendora, La Verne and San
Dimas, cities south of Angeles National Forest, where almost 36,000
acres were charred in September.</TE>
<TE>   The Fire Department is cleaning out debris in the storm basins
below burned areas and has distributed sandbags to local fire
stations for residents who want to protect their property.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a tremendous potential for life loss from mud and debris
flows after the fires," Collins said. "We know that it's coming."</TE>

<HD>Headstrong Artist Carved a Place in History</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First-generation American artist Gutzon Borglum emerged onto the
national scene when he carved into history the heads of four U.S.
presidents on Mt. Rushmore, deep in the Black Hills of South Dakota.</LD>
<LD>   Although his earlier paintings and sculptures would be
overshadowed by the mountainside known as the Shrine to Democracy,
many of his works were crafted in Los Angeles and the town where he
lived, Sierra Madre.</LD>
<LD>   Like Mt. Rushmore itself, Borglum was a larger-than-life figure
who demanded attention. Amid a career that spanned more than half a
century, he carried on a romance with the California landscape,
painting hundreds of seascapes, landscapes, crumbling mission
exteriors, championship horses and a portrait of Gen. John C.
Fremont, as well as sculpting a bust of Fremont's wife, Jessie Benton
Fremont, and the Los Angeles Times' bronze eagle.</LD>
<TE>   The artist was born John Gutzon de la Mothe Borglum in Idaho on
March 25, 1867. His father was a Mormon immigrant from Denmark who
had married two sisters. When Borglum was 4, his father, a frontier
doctor, left the church, discarding young Borglum's mother so he
could move back into society with only one wife and a brood of
children.</TE>
<TE>   Young Borglum, angry and rebellious, moved with his father and the
rest of the family to Omaha, where he was reared by his
stepmother-aunt.</TE>
<TE>   In 1884, his father's wanderlust led the family to Los Angeles.
The father opened a medical practice and Borglum, 17, began a career
as a lithographer's apprentice and a fresco painter. He quit after
six months, angry over what he considered a meager salary.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to be a famous artist, he began to paint landscapes and
portraits of the rich and famous. He gradually carved out a niche for
himself, and opened his own art studio in the basement of The Times'
building on Broadway. There his art caught the eye of Times Publisher
Harrison Gray Otis, who would later commission the Times eagle, which
was emblematic of Otis' motto: "Stand fast, stand firm, stand sure,
stand true."</TE>
<TE>   The eagle weighs more than 200 pounds and has a wingspan of 7 1/2
feet. It perched atop three Times buildings beginning Dec. 5, 1891.
In 1956, it was moved inside to protect it from decay, and today it
graces the lobby.</TE>
<TE>   Sharing a Studio</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1880s, Borglum became attracted to a worldly woman
named Elizabeth "Lisa" Putnam. She was an accomplished still-life
artist and teacher, as well as a divorcee nearly twice his age. But
she recognized his genius and encouraged him to go to San Francisco
for study. When he returned in 1887, after less than a year under the
tutelage of artist William Keith, Putnam invited Borglum to share her
studio.</TE>
<TE>   As he began to experiment with various painting styles, he
attracted critics, friends, patrons -- and editor Charles F. Lummis,
who saw in Borglum the promise of better things.</TE>
<TE>   "His paintings had many shortcomings and showed his lack of
education. Yet there was in them a creative breadth that promised to
make him heard," Lummis wrote in his magazine, Land of Sunshine.</TE>
<TE>   Borglum believed that he would be famous before he turned 30.
Putnam, his teacher, mentor and lover, shared his dream.</TE>
<TE>   His portraits led to his first significant art commission, in
1888, when Jessie Fremont asked him to paint her husband, who had
explored and mapped the West. In return, she gave Borglum letters of
introduction to her prosperous friends, including railroad magnate
Collis Huntington, former California Gov. Leland Stanford and young
Theodore Roosevelt.</TE>
<TE>   Fremont's portrait proved valuable, earning Borglum the loyalty
and support of Jessie Fremont, who was instrumental in furthering his
career.</TE>
<TE>   In 1889, Borglum, 22, married Putnam, 41, in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   That same year, he finished a 5-by-9-foot painting of a stagecoach
drawn by six horses careening down a mountain road. "Staging in
California," considered one of his finest works, is at the Joslyn Art
Museum in Omaha.</TE>
<TE>   The work earned him the backing of a socialite, Mrs. Spencer H.
Smith, who bought many of his paintings, introduced him to her
powerful friends and, in 1890, paid for his art training in Europe,
where Borglum learned sculpting techniques under Auguste Rodin in
Paris</TE>
<TE>   In 1893, Borglum and his wife were lured back to L.A. by the
climate and a commission for three landscapes from Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   With four Great Danes in tow, the Borglums set up their studio in
a cottage tucked amid grapevines and palm, pepper, orange and oak
trees in the foothills of Sierra Madre on the northwest corner of
Hermosa Avenue and Live Oak, now called Orange Grove Avenue. They
called their four-acre ranch El Rosario, meaning the rose garden.</TE>
<TE>   "There is enough beauty in nature here to keep me painting a
lifetime," Borglum said. The home was also close to Lucky Baldwin's
racehorses, which Borglum used as models for many paintings.</TE>
<TE>   Lummis, the editor, introduced Borglum to his notable friends and
his home, El Alisal. Borglum built the rock fireplace in the landmark
house that Lummis crafted along the Arroyo Seco. Today, it is the
home of the Historical Society of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   As more people began to recognize Borglum's talent, he grew more
self-confident and butted heads with Lummis, which led to a bitter
feud. Each man believed he was an authority on art.</TE>
<TE>   Borglum became downright bitter when Stanford unexpectedly died in
1893, leaving his financial affairs tangled. Borglum lost out on his
$10,000 commission for the three landscapes.</TE>
<TE>   Another blow came just before Thanksgiving in 1894, when he found
all four Great Danes dead, poisoned by a mean-spirited neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   By 1896, he was nearly 30 and nearly broke. His marriage was
failing because his wife wanted a quieter life, while he was bursting
with creative energy. Worse, with his self-imposed deadline
approaching, he wasn't famous.</TE>
<TE>   So the Borglums returned to Europe, where he took London by storm,
painting portraits of the rich and titled and attending lavish
parties. But that interlude merely delayed the inevitable. After six
years in Europe, he declared his marriage over and hopped on a ship
for New York in 1902.</TE>
<TE>   Marrying Again</TE>
<TE>   Crossing the Atlantic he met Mary Montgomery, 23, whom he would
marry in 1909. The couple had two children. His former wife
eventually returned to their homestead in Sierra Madre, where she
continued to paint. She died in Venice, Calif., in 1922.</TE>
<TE>   Borglum was more determined than ever to win renown. Within a
10-year span, he created a marble bust of Lincoln, which was
installed in the Capitol rotunda; sculpted more than 100 pieces for
the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in New York; and crafted
a monument to Civil War Gen. Philip Sheridan in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   His penchant for outspokenness enraged the public, but the press
loved him. He called one artist a "pinhead sculptor" and argued that
most of the nation's public monuments were "worthless and should be
dynamited."</TE>
<TE>   "This is America's colossal age," he said, "and American artists
should celebrate it."</TE>
<TE>   In 1915, the United Daughters of the Confederacy signed him to
carve a now-famous tourist attraction, a 1,200-foot-long relief of
Confederate soldiers on Georgia's Stone Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   When the Ku Klux Klan became the group's major financial
supporter, Borglum embraced the Klan, saying blacks had "eaten into
the very moral fiber of our race character" and calling immigrants
"slippered assassins," despite his father's roots in Denmark. Before
completing the project, he was fired for his "offensive egotism and
delusions of grandeur." He smashed his models and bolted to South
Dakota before authorities could catch him. The Stone Mountain work
was completed by others, but not until 1970.</TE>
<TE>   South Dakota, which had been courting Borglum, had decided that it
too wanted a tourist attraction. So Borglum delved into politics,
fighting for funding and struggling against personal bankruptcy and
public indifference to build the monumental sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   Monumental Project</TE>
<TE>   In 1927, he began to carve the 60-foot-high heads of four
presidents: George Washington for the birth of the Republic, Thomas
Jefferson for the idea of representative government, Abraham Lincoln
for promoting a permanent union and equality, and Theodore Roosevelt
for establishing the 20th century role of the U.S. in world affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Borglum chose the subjects himself, dissuading South Dakota from
using Sioux Indian Chief Red Cloud and scout Kit Carson, among
others. Despite his earlier racist comments, the artist admired
Lincoln and even named his son after him.</TE>
<TE>   Borglum's detractors called the project more an engineering feat
than art. A New York critic opined that if he was going to destroy
another mountain, "thank God it's only in South Dakota."</TE>
<TE>   Of the $990,000 needed to create the Mt. Rushmore Memorial,
$836,000 came from federal funds, even during the Depression. Much of
the rest came from schoolchildren who donated pennies, nickels and
dimes, while Borglum mortgaged his 500-acre Connecticut estate and
pitched Studebakers and Bromo-Seltzer in radio ads. Borglum received
$170,000 for the 14 years he spent on the project -- a little more
than $12,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   As tough as the granite of his beloved mountain, he died of a
heart attack a few days before his 74th birthday in March 1941. His
son, Lincoln, finished the project later that year, just before the
U.S. entered the war.</TE>
<TE>   Borglum is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park in Glendale in the
Memorial Court of Honor. The four presidential heads of Mt. Rushmore
are depicted in bronze on his plaque.</TE>
<TE>   All that's left of El Rosario is a stone fireplace. But Lizzie's
Trail Inn, a tiny museum in Sierra Madre, displays the palette on
which he mixed his colors of California.</TE>

<HD>Bruce Vidal, 54; Longtime L.A. Disc Jockey Reveled in
Having Achieved His 'Dream Job'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>   Bruce Vidal, a disc jockey for KIIS-FM (102.7) for 15 years, whose
booming voice was as big as his 300-pound girth, has died. He was 54.</LD>
<LD>   Vidal, who spent 1982 through 1996 on local air waves, died Friday
of an apparent heart attack at his home near Palm Desert, said Don
Barrett, author of the book "Los Angeles Radio People." Vidal had
suffered from complications of diabetes.</LD>
<LD>   During part of his tenure here, in the mid-1980s, Vidal was
married to his chief competitor, Laurie Allen, whose job he took at
KIIS. Their on-air rivalry earned them an appearance on ABC's "Good
Morning America" and articles in People magazine and The Times, among
other publications.</LD>
<TE>   The two, who married in Las Vegas in 1976, both spun patter and
music from 6 to 10 p.m. five nights a week, Vidal on KIIS and Allen
on KMGG-FM (105.9).</TE>
<TE>   They joked about the two cars parked in their Canoga Park
driveway: a sleek, new red Corvette and a not-so-sleek dented Dodge
Aries.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever gets the highest ratings," Allen told The Times in 1985,
"gets to drive the Corvette."</TE>
<TE>   Vidal, who attracted four times as many listeners as his wife, got
the sports car.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my dream job," Vidal told The Times of his KIIS stint in
that dual interview. "Fifteen years ago, when I got into radio, I
wanted to come to Los Angeles, work at the No. 1 Top-40 station in
town, make a lot of money, live in the Valley, have a house with a
pool and drive a Corvette. And it's happened."</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Vidal moved on to smaller radio stations, first in
Thousand Oaks and in 1999 to what had become KELT-FM (92.7) in
Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Los Angeles, the son of a postman, Vidal took five
years to get through high school and then graduated to a job parking
cars. But after seeing a television commercial for the Career Academy
School of Broadcasting, he took the six-month course in 1970 and
landed a job at a small station in Washington, Iowa. Three years
later, he moved to station KDLM in Detroit Lakes, Minn., where he met
Allen. In 1976, after marrying Allen, Vidal went to work at KOIL in
Omaha, Neb.</TE>
<TE>   By 1981, he had moved to K101 in San Francisco. It was the
scene of his worst professional blunder. As a promotion gimmick, the
station had offered to pay $25,000 to any listener who caught a
deejay failing to play three songs consecutively between commercials
and announcements.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very intense because we did commercials at 10, 20, 30
and 50 minutes. We all felt like a gun was to our heads," he told
People in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Vidal read an ad without playing the touted three-in-a-row songs,
and the station had to pay up. Soon after, he moved south, starting
with a part-time job at KIIS and then replacing Allen as evening
deejay.</TE>
<TE>   Information about survivors was not immediately available.</TE>

<HD>Herman Weiner, 88; Steel Magnate, Philanthropist, Sports
Booster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Herman L. Weiner, a frustrated wannabe baseball player who became a
steel industry magnate and philanthropist encouraging youths to
pursue both scholastic and major league dreams, has died. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Weiner died Friday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of cardiac
arrest after spending several weeks in a coma, said his son-in-law,
Mark Spitz.</LD>
<LD>   From 1947, when he helped his father, Jack, start Weiner Iron &amp;
Metal Co., until he sold what became Weiner Steel Corp. to Hiuka
America Corp. in 1990, Weiner built what his son Steve said was the
largest industrial scrap metal recycling company west of Chicago.</LD>
<TE>   The company, under Herman Weiner, expanded into several
subsidiaries including Pacific Erectors Corp., which built vast water
storage tanks for utility companies throughout California.</TE>
<TE>   Other subsidiaries made large pipes and tin plate for use in
canning.</TE>
<TE>   But the man whose own bright future in professional baseball was
derailed by a collegiate injury always remained involved in sports.</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate, Spitz said Saturday that Weiner, in partnership
with attorney Ed Hookstratten, almost became owner of a National
Football League franchise in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "They had raised the money required of the NFL [to be granted an
expansion team] and were in constant contact with [then-NFL
Commissioner] Pete Rozelle.... [Weiner] knew 24 of 28 owners and had
more than enough votes from the owners to get approval and be a
franchise owner," Spitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Weiner's dream was thwarted when Al Davis suddenly moved the
Oakland Raiders (now back in Oakland) to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Spitz, who won seven gold medals in swimming events at the 1972
Olympics in Munich, Germany, and two additional medals later, also
credited Weiner with serving as his agent a dozen or so years ago
when, then in his 40s, he tried to make a comeback in competitive
swimming.</TE>
<TE>   "My father-in-law thought I was getting too fat. He said to me,
'Why don't you get off your can and exercise?' " Spitz, who had gone
on to careers in show business and real estate, told Times sports
columnist Melvin Durslag in 1989. So Spitz did as advised and trained
anew -- unsuccessfully -- for Olympic events in Barcelona, Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Born in East Los Angeles, Weiner earned a baseball scholarship to
UC Berkeley. There he built such a record, his son said, that one San
Francisco sports columnist labeled him the "Jewish Dizzy Dean."</TE>
<TE>   Weiner in one season under Coach Clint Evans established a 12-1
pitching record -- including two no-hit games and three one-hit games
-- and led the conference in hitting with a .479 batting average.</TE>
<TE>   But he suffered a knee injury while playing center field, and
never recuperated enough to make the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Weiner worked briefly in the movie industry in sound and editing
departments at MGM, and then devoted himself to the scrap metal
business.</TE>
<TE>   He also coached youth baseball and football for many years in
Little League, Pony League and Pop Warner Football League, and
conducted sports clinics for youngsters up and down the state.</TE>
<TE>   With his father, who died in 1964, and other members of the
family, Weiner was responsible for donating the Charley DiGiovanna
and Fred Haney Trophies given annually to inspirational Los Angeles
Dodger and California Angel baseball players.</TE>
<TE>   Weiner gave lavishly to scholarships and helped recruit and
support promising students at UC Berkeley, UCLA, Stanford, Utah State
and others.</TE>
<TE>   He was president of Southern Seas, the UC Berkeley booster group
in Southern California, and in 1958 was accused of luring UCLA
football prospects to UC Berkeley. Then-Berkeley football coach Pete
Elliott scoffed at the allegation, saying that Weiner was "a man of
high moral standards."</TE>
<TE>   Weiner is survived by his wife of 60 years, Trudy; his son, Steve;

<HD>Austin Towers Over No. 13 Xavier</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mario Austin waited six games before he was allowed to play this
season. It didn't take him long to know he was back.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-foot-9 junior forward had 28 points and nine rebounds in his
season debut and No. 24 Mississippi State kept right on winning with
his return, beating No. 13 Xavier, 71-61, Saturday at Madison Square
Garden in New York.</LD>
<LD>   "After running up and down the court a few times I felt OK, but
then I ran really hard on one break and got the pass, a reward for
running hard, and I thought 'I'm back,' " he said.</LD>
<TE>   Austin was held out of the Bulldogs' first six games while the
NCAA cleared up some questions about his eligibility. He was given
the OK to rejoin the team Tuesday, and the Bulldogs (6-1) won their
sixth straight as Austin outplayed Xavier's 6-9 forward David West in
the matchup of two of the country's talented big men.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, Mario Austin is back," Xavier Coach Thad Matta said.
"What a show he put on today."</TE>
<TE>   Austin was 12 for 21 from the field, including making his only
three-point attempt, and played 32 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't come out with any numbers in mind," Austin said. "I just
wanted to fit in and help us win. It just so happened I took shots
and they went in."</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi State, playing for the first time in Madison Square
Garden, took control early and then held on over the final two
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   West, a two-time Atlantic 10 player of the year, had two points in
the first half as the Musketeers (5-2) fell behind 33-15. He finished
with 13 points, 6.7 below his average, and 17 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Alabama 72, Bowling Green 63 -- Kenny Walker scored a
career-high 25 points and made three key free throws to help preserve
the victory at Mobile, Ala., for the Crimson Tide (7-0).</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Netter scored 26 points for Bowling Green (2-4), but after
he made a hook shot to bring the Falcons to within 66-63 with 1:51
remaining, he fouled out 34 seconds later and Bowling Green didn't
score again.</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Pittsburgh 89, Southeastern Louisiana 55 -- Julius Page
scored 17 points for Pittsburgh (6-0), which took a big early lead
with a series of dunks and fast-break layups on the way to an easy
win at Pittsburgh. Southeastern Louisiana is 1-5.</TE>
<TE>   No. 6 Oklahoma 69, Coppin State 47 -- Hollis Price scored 22
points for Oklahoma, which took control with a 13-2 run over the
final 6:39 of the first half to take a 15-point halftime lead at
Norman, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Quannas White had 13 points and seven assists for the
Sooners (5-1). Coppin State (1-6) shot 36% from the field.</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Indiana 66, Purdue 63 -- Jeff Newton scored all 16 of his
points in the second half, including nine in the final three minutes,
to help Indiana hold on to win a nonconference game at Indianapolis.
Newton also had 12 rebounds to become the first Indiana player since
Alan Henderson, in 1995, to record five consecutive double-doubles.</TE>
<TE>   At 8-0, Indiana is off to its best start since 1989-90. Purdue
(4-2) was led by Willie Deane with 21 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Duel in the Dome was scheduled as a nonconference game after
the Big Ten's rotating schedule pitted the two rivals against each
other only once this season.</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 Notre Dame 102, DePaul 71 -- Matt Carroll had a career-high
33 points and the Fighting Irish missed only two shots from two-point
range in the first half in their victory at South Bend, Ind. Chris
Thomas had 22 points and 10 assists for Notre Dame (9-1), which shot
63% from the field in the first half to open a 48-36 lead over De
Paul (4-1).</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Missouri 93, Memphis 78 -- Arthur Johnson had 23 points and
11 rebounds for his fourth double-double in the first six games to
help the Tigers (6-0) win at Columbia, Mo. Memphis (4-2) shot 37%
from the field. Missouri's first six opponents have shot less than
40%.</TE>
<TE>   No. 21 Michigan State 71, No. 12 Kentucky 67 -- Chris Hill scored
16 points and made two free throws with 13.6 seconds left to seal the
victory for the Spartans (5-2) at Lexington, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Bogans scored 23 points for the Wildcats (5-2). Bogans was
11 of 17 from three-point range in Kentucky's last three games, but
he was three of eight Saturday and missed a three-point attempt with
21 seconds left and his team trailing 69-67.</TE>
<TE>   No. 14 Florida 69, No. 18 Maryland 64 -- The Gators' victory at
College Park, Md., ended the nation's longest nonconference home
winning streak at 87. Maryland's last nonconference home defeat was
Dec. 12, 1989, against Coppin State.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Anthony Roberson scored 20 points, making four of seven
three-point baskets, for Florida (7-2). The Terrapins (4-3) made only
four of 11 free throws and have lost three of their last four.</TE>
<TE>   No. 15 Illinois 70, Temple 54 -- Brian Cook had 25 points and 11
rebounds for Illinois (7-0), which broke it open after holding only a
three-point lead at halftime at Chicago. Temple (1-6), playing
without Coach John Chaney, who was at home while he recovers from
pneumonia, shot only 29% from the field.</TE>
<TE>   No. 16 Marquette 63, Wisconsin 54 -- Dwyane Wade scored 25 points
and Marquette (6-1) snapped a four-game losing streak against
Wisconsin (6-2), winning at Milwaukee. Kirk Penney, the Badgers'
leading scorer, finished with only seven points, 11 below his
average.</TE>
<TE>   No. 17 Tulsa 62, Southwest Missouri State 46 -- Kevin Johnson had
16 points, 12 rebounds and three blocked shots for Tulsa (5-1) in a
win at Springfield, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   No. 19 Stanford 76, St. Mary's 58 -- Julius Barnes scored 17
points and Josh Childress had 16 for the Cardinal (5-1) at Stanford.
St. Mary's, playing Stanford for the first time in 14 years, pulled
to within 45-42 with 13:37 left before Stanford countered with a 14-3
run to take control.</TE>
<TE>   No. 20 Kansas 113, Emporia State 61 -- Kirk Hinrich made five
three-point baskets, matching his career high, and scored 23 points
and Wayne Simien also had 23 points to help Kansas (5-3) take a 34-10
lead 8 1/2 minutes into the game and win in a rout at Lawrence, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   No. 23 Creighton 101, Tennessee Tech 72 -- Kyle Korver made six
three-point baskets and had 20 points for Creighton (7-0) at Omaha.
Creighton outscored the Golden Eagles (4-3), 17-0, over a 5:38 span
of the first half to break open the game.</TE>
<TE>   Eastern Washington 62, Washington 58 -- Alvin Snow scored 24
points at Seattle to help the Eagles (6-2) post their first victory
over Washington. Nate Robinson scored 19 points for Washington (2-4).</TE>
<TE>   Colorado State 90, Washington State 79 -- The Cougars (3-4) pulled
to within 77-76 with 5:22 remaining before the Rams (8-2), who made
32 of 47 free throws, pulled away to win at Fort Collins, Colo.
Marcus Moore had 20 points for Washington State (3-4).</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State 62, Sacramento State 49 -- Phillip Ricci had 18
points and 12 rebounds to lead the Beavers (4-1) at Sacramento. Ricci
scored all but three of his points in the second half to help Oregon
State pull away after being tied, 20-20, at halftime.</TE>

<LD>USC held a scrimmage Saturday that featured a little bit of
everything.</LD>
<LD>   Punches were thrown. Players scrambling for a fumble converged in
a massive dog pile. Safety Troy Polamalu got as many carries at
running back (one) as he had interceptions.</LD>
<LD>   And the Trojans moved another step closer to their Jan. 2 meeting
with Iowa in the Orange Bowl. USC will take a few days off before
resuming practice Thursday, when it begins implementing a game plan.</LD>
<TE>   "Right now we're just trying to keep football on our mind and work
on little things," linebacker Matt Grootegoed said. "Starting
Thursday, we'll kick it into gear."</TE>
<TE>   Tempers briefly boiled over when offensive tackle Winston Justice
got into it with some defensive linemen.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just football," said Grootegoed, the team leader in
tackles. "But you could tell we're not going 100%. We're working, but
next week will be a lot harder."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterbacks Matt Cassel and Brandon Hance scrimmaged with the
first-team offense, and Matt Leinart and Billy Hart played with the
second team.</TE>
<TE>   Leinart, a redshirt freshman from Santa Ana Mater Dei High,
reportedly has been dissatisfied with his limited role on the team.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he would transfer if he doesn't win the starting job in
spring practice, Leinart said, "I'm not going to talk about that
because I don't know. No comment."</TE>

<LD>Sheila Stufflet completed a three-point play with 18 seconds left in
overtime and Brooke Stewart added two free throws in the final
seconds to lead Pittsburgh to a 92-88 victory over No. 11 Penn State
on Saturday at Pittsburgh in nonconference women's basketball.</LD>

a top 25 team for only the second time in two years.</LD>

control and outscore Pacific (2-6), 26-7, over the final 7:50. The
Cardinal is still playing without its best player, Nicole Powell, who
has not practiced or played because of a bulging disk in her back.

Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   No. 6 Purdue 53, Indiana 51 -- Shereka Wright scored 26 points,

pass the length of the court and drove for a left-handed layup but
missed for Indiana (5-3).</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 Notre Dame 84, Temple 61 -- Alicia Ratay scored 17 points

<TE>   No. 10 Texas Tech 84, Wyoming 64 -- Cisti Greenwalt had 26 points
and eight blocked shots for Texas Tech (4-1), which made 11
first-half layups and won at Casper, Wyo. Wyoming (4-2) shot 16% from

<TE>   No. 15 Oklahoma 68, Texas Christian 64 -- Chelsi Welch scored 16
points, including six straight late in the second half, to help
Oklahoma (8-2) rally at Fort Worth. TCU (3-5) pulled to within one
with 14 seconds remaining, but Stephanie Luce and Dionnah Jackson
made three free throws for the Sooners.</TE>
<TE>   No. 16 Mississippi State 72, Illinois 67 -- Tan White had 19
points and six steals and Doceida Warren scored 15 points in a

All-American LaToya Thomas, win at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   No. 17 Louisiana Tech 93, Nicholls State 50 -- Erica Smith scored

<HD>Holyfield Looks Like Old Warrior</HD>
<DH>Byrd scores a unanimous decision over aging opponent to
claim International Boxing Federation belt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Boxing is a lot like the Bible, goes the old maxim, in that 'tis
better to give than to receive, and as the holiday season descended
upon the storm-lashed Eastern Seaboard, aging Evander Holyfield
abruptly got religion Saturday night in the form of a decisive
whipping administered by a younger, quicker Chris Byrd.</LD>
<LD>   In the first of a series of heavyweight fights that promoter Don
King hopes will produce a challenger that reigning World Boxing
Council champion Lennox Lewis might deem worthy, the 32-year-old
Byrd, a lefty who snapped his right jab throughout 12 rounds with
impunity, outpointed the 40-year-old four-time champion to win a
unanimous decision and the International Boxing Federation belt.</LD>
<LD>   Byrd had come into the ring wearing a blue shirt that said "Jesus"
in big letters. Woven into his trunks was a reference to the Biblical
verse Acts 4:12. When the fight ended, the two men met in Holyfield's
corner to pray, arm in arm -- and to bear witness to a fight that
gives fresh impetus to Byrd's career and raises questions about how
much longer Holyfield ought to endure such beatings.</LD>
<TE>   During the 12-round fight, for instance, Byrd landed 154 jabs;
Holyfield three. In all, Byrd connected with 252 punches, Holyfield
102. Judge John Stewart scored the fight, 116-112; judges Steve
Weisfeld and Eugene Grant had it, 117-111.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd, a silver medalist in the 1992 Olympics, improved his record
to 35-2. Holyfield fell to 38-6-2. Attendance at Atlantic City's
famed Boardwalk Hall, far from full, was reported at 8,543.</TE>
<TE>   Holyfield, who said afterward he had injured his left shoulder,
said his career is still alive: "It's still there and my goal is
still to be undisputed heavyweight champion."</TE>
<TE>   But Byrd pointed out the obvious: "He's a great fighter, but I
beat him to the punch."</TE>
<TE>   Holyfield earned about $5 million for Saturday's fight, Byrd $3
million -- but now Byrd is in line for a next big payday, against the
winner of a March 1 bout in Las Vegas between World Boxing Assn.
champion John Ruiz and Roy Jones Jr., the light-heavyweight champion
who is moving up in weight.</TE>
<TE>   As part of King's newest, greatest plan, the winner of Saturday
night's fight is to be matched against the winner of the March 1
bout. That winner would then square off against Lewis in a
unification bout that, in theory, would be a cash bonanza for all
involved -- including, of course, King.</TE>
<TE>   Many pieces of that puzzle remain to be put together, however.</TE>
<TE>   For one, Lewis has to agree to it, and he said Saturday, "I'm not
committed to fighting anybody."</TE>
<TE>   After he knocked out Mike Tyson in June, Lewis professed to be
unimpressed with Byrd, the IBF's No. 1-ranked contender. Thereupon he
surrendered his IBF belt. Thereupon King confirmed he had paid Lewis
$1 million to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Thus King could launch his "tournament," as he calls it, and Lewis
could spend months watching a line of challengers get hit about the
head for the opportunity to fight him -- if the price is right and
someone proves suitable.</TE>
<TE>   But who?</TE>
<TE>   The Klitschko brothers, Vitali and Wladimir? "I don't think he
deserves to fight me," Lewis said of Vitali, saying reports of a
March 2003 pairing are not accurate and adding that Wladimir "looked
like he didn't want to get hit" in his most recent fight, on Dec. 7
in Las Vegas against Jameel McCline, a 10th-round technical knockout
that went Klitschko's way.</TE>
<TE>   Jones? In a heavyweight bout, Lewis said, "I'm always going to go
for the heavier guy."</TE>
<TE>   Tyson "deserves another fight" but only "if he cleans up his act
and starts knocking people out."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz at least drew a measure of Lewis' praise: "I see him working
hard." Asked, however, if he would fight Ruiz, Lewis replied,
"Perhaps."</TE>

<HD>Birmingham Made Most of Rematch</HD>
<DH>Patriots believed they had a shot at beating Taft, then
proved it with a dominating victory Friday at the Coliseum.</DH>

<LD>Eddie Arreola fell to the Coliseum turf and started crying. Later, he
started pulling up grass from the field and put it into a paper cup.</LD>
<LD>   For the Lake Balboa Birmingham senior offensive lineman, it will
be a souvenir of one of the most surprising City Section championship
games in its 89-year history.</LD>
<LD>   "Nobody believed we could be No. 1," Arreola said Friday night
after the Patriots' 35-7 victory over previously undefeated Woodland
Hills Taft (13-1). "It's been my dream in my four years of [high
school] football."</LD>
<TE>   Few believed the Patriots (11-3) had a chance. After all, Taft
dealt Birmingham its worst defeat of the season on Nov. 15, a 30-6
decision that left the Patriots dismayed. But it would also serve as
motivation for the rematch.</TE>
<TE>   "Much of the way everybody perceived the game was based on that
first time we played," Birmingham Coach Ed Croson said. "The more we
watched that film, the more we thought we were a better team than on
Nov. 15. We realized we weren't that far away from them."</TE>
<TE>   Taft hadn't been challenged during the season. Only once did a
team hold a fourth-quarter lead on the Toreadors. Nobody held them to
fewer than 30 points.</TE>
<TE>   Birmingham put them on the defensive right away with an 80-yard
drive capped by a 28-yard pass play from Ryan Lombardo to Brian
Baylor. The Patriots stuck to their plan and controlled the game with
a dominant performance by their offensive line.</TE>
<TE>   Those linemen -- Arreola, Robert Elisha, Ernesto Mena, William
Ramirez and Phillip Cerda -- paved the way for 239 yards on the
ground. Dennis Keyes and Baylor were the beneficiaries with 133 yards
and 92 yards, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The dominance showed in the Patriots' five scoring drives, which
consisted of six, 13, seven, eight and 21 plays. The Patriots
attempted only one pass in the second half and had the ball for all
but eight seconds of the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got a great defense," Croson said of Taft. "I think we
made enough movement in the front to let our running backs get
upfield. I believe we've got the best running back in Los Angeles in
Dennis Keyes, and with Baylor back there, they're not going to get
stopped behind the line of scrimmage often.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the right game plan for that opponent and I think they
executed it perfectly."</TE>
<TE>   For Taft, it was a night of despair. The Toreadors, who lost the
City final last year on the final play of the game to Dorsey, looked
helpless as the deficit grew larger.</TE>
<TE>   Taft's best chance to make it a game came in the third quarter
trailing, 28-7. But after reaching the five-yard line, Ian Bell was
stopped for no gain, Steve Smith dropped a pass from Cary Dove and
Keyes broke up two passes.</TE>
<TE>   "We just didn't play our game from the start," said Dove, who was
16 of 30 for 214 yards with an interception. "We never got any
momentum our way."</TE>
<TE>   Defensive back Mike Pratt said the hardest thing was not being
able to get the ball back because of the Patriots' sustained drives.</TE>
<TE>   "When they went up three, four touchdowns, you can just run the
ball like that," he said.</TE>

<LD>Mohamed Trafeh of Duarte achieved one of two goals he set for himself
in the national cross-country championships at Morley Field in San
Diego on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   He attained the most important one, however, when he finished
seventh in the meet that pitted the top eight finishers from the
West, Midwest, Northeast and South region championships against each
other.</LD>
<LD>   Trafeh, a junior, clocked 15 minutes 15 seconds over the
5,000-meter course to post the highest finish by a runner from the
West region.</LD>
<TE>   Senior Michael Poe of Etiwanda, who won the West regional at Mt.
San Antonio College on Dec. 7, was a disappointing 22nd in 15:39
after fading badly in the second half of the race.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Chris Solinsky of Stevens Point, Wis., ran 14:41 to win the
boys' race by a record-equaling 20 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Trafeh placed eighth in the West regional, but his goals for the
national meet were to finish among the top 10 and be the
highest-finishing non-senior.</TE>
<TE>   He just missed achieving the latter when junior Garrett Heath of
Winona, Minn., nipped him at the finish.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt like I had nothing to lose," said Trafeh, one of
three runners to lead the field through the mile in 4:44. "I was
really hurting during the race, but I was going to run all-out for as
long as I could."</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Zoe Nelson of Kalispell Flathead, Mont., won the girls'
race in 17:30 to become the fourth champion in a row from the West.</TE>
<TE>   Erik Starkey, the cross-country coach at Chino Hills Ayala for the
past four years, has resigned to pursue other coaching opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Starkey, 31, guided the Ayala girls' teams to four consecutive
Sierra League titles and a fifth-place finish in the state Division I
final last year. The Ayala boys' team won league titles in 1999, 2000
and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Pye and Dawn Staabv, assistants under Starkey, will take
over the Ayala program.</TE>
<TE>   -- John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   Larry Edwards has retired as football coach at Calabasas after 24
seasons but will remain at the school as a teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards guided the Coyotes to a 5-5 record this season, their
first in the Marmonte League. He won the team's only Frontier League
title in 1986 and coached the '86 team and the 1999 team to semifinal
appearances in the Southern Section playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   -- Dan Loumena</TE>
<TE>   Jon Looney has resigned as head football coach at Brea Olinda to
spend more time with his family. He will remain at the school as a
teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Looney won 104 games in 14 years and led the Wildcats to the 2001
Southern Section Division IX championship.</TE>
<TE>   -- Dale Ruhe</TE>
<TE>   Guy Gardner has retired as football coach at Westminster La
Quinta. Gardner compiled a 6-33 record in four seasons with the
Aztecs, who were 1-9 this year.</TE>
<TE>   -- Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   USC continues to reel in top Southern California prep football
recruits, picking up commitments from tight end Chris Barrett of
Tustin and linebacker Jonathan Turner of Corona.</TE>

<HD>Kline Puts Los Alamitos on Fast Track</HD>
<DH>Quarterback runs for three scores, passes for two others as
Griffins win their first Southern Section Division I title by
defeating Mater Dei, 41-14.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took Los Alamitos High all of five seconds Saturday night to send
the message that it was intent on winning its first Southern Section
Division I football title.</LD>
<LD>   That was the time it took Randy Estes of the Griffins to sprint
downfield on the opening kickoff and greet Santa Ana Mater Dei's
Corey Boudreaux with a how-do-you-do tackle that sent him crashing to
the turf.</LD>
<LD>   Then Los Alamitos quarterback Jeff Kline made like a gazelle,
weaving effortlessly through defenders for three rushing touchdowns
and passing for another as the Griffins took control before the end
of the third quarter.</LD>
<TE>   The rest was just details as Los Alamitos overwhelmed its Orange
County rival, 41-14, before 14,812 at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   Kline finished with three touchdowns rushing, two passing and 293
all-purpose yards for the Griffins (13-0-1), who exacted revenge
against a Mater Dei program that had won three of four playoff
meetings between the schools in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't even express what I feel right now I'm so happy," said
Kline, who rushed for 129 yards in 12 carries and completed 14 of 23
passes for 164 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it was going to be a defensive struggle, but they had
to respect our passing game and it opened up a lot of holes."</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos tailback Ryan Bagley also took advantage of the
openings, rushing for 109 yards in 17 carries.</TE>
<TE>   "We missed a lot of tackles and it just got out of control," Mater
Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson said. "We thought we had [their offense]
schemed; we just didn't have it tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei (10-4) played well in spurts but could never mount a
threat after falling behind, 20-0, midway through the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Rafael Rice scored both of the Monarchs' touchdowns
-- on a one-yard run and a 10-yard reception -- but Mater Dei only
converted four of 11 third downs and committed two turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   For the second game in a row, Rice fumbled on Mater Dei's opening
possession, but the Monarchs escaped damage when Kevin Gamarnik's
22-yard field goal attempt was wide right.</TE>
<TE>   Gamarnik connected on his next attempt, from 32 yards, to give the
Griffins a 3-0 lead late in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos went ahead, 10-0, early in the second quarter when
Kline faked a handoff and ran to his right for a three-yard
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   The Griffins increased their advantage to 17-0 on Kline's 23-yard
touchdown pass to Jeremy Childs midway through the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just a playmaker with his feet, his arm and mostly his
brain," Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes said of Kline, a 6-foot-2
senior who hasn't garnered serious interest from colleges. "I'm glad
to have him."</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth section title and first since 1993 for Barnes,
who earlier this season became the winningest coach in Orange County
history. He has 217 victories in 24 seasons.</TE>

<KH>DIVISION VIII FOOTBALL FINAL</KH>
<HD>Kaiser Stops Serrano, 28-21</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Giving up a couple of touchdowns by halftime didn't indicate much of
a defensive effort by Fontana Kaiser in the Southern Section Division
VIII championship football game Saturday night, so the Cats decided
to do something about it.</LD>
<LD>   Kaiser's defense scored a touchdown midway through the third
quarter to help secure a 28-21 victory over Phelan Serrano at Fontana
High.</LD>
<LD>   It is the first section title in any sport for the three-year-old
school.</LD>
<TE>   Kaiser (13-0-1) clung to a 21-14 lead when Omar Alvarez stepped in
front of a pass from Jon Edmiston and returned it 21 yards for a
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "I got it when it counted the most," Alvarez said. "I keyed the
fullback the whole way, then took it to the house."</TE>
<TE>   It was one of three interceptions for Kaiser, which came into the
game having allowed only 438 yards rushing this season. Chris Vega,
who had 2,385 rushing yards and 37 touchdowns before Saturday, was
held to 31 yards in 21 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Vega did score on a four-yard run with 8 minutes 16 seconds left
to cut the deficit to 28-21, but Kaiser's defense again stepped up
after the offense lost a fumble near midfield, forcing Serrano (13-1)
to punt with 4:42 left.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser was twice on the verge of adding to its 6-0 lead in the
first half, but Serrano defensive end Devin Blakely intercepted a
pass in the end zone to end one threat. On the first play of the
second quarter, running back Allen Wade fumbled at the Serrano five.
Cheyne Nelson picked up the ball and ran it back 95 yards for a 7-6
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser moved back ahead, 14-7, on a five-yard run by Kevin Mafua
and a two-point conversion run by Marcus McCliman with 5:17 left in
the half.</TE>

<HD>That's 'D' as in Diablos' Defense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deep in the bowels of Edison Field, behind closed locker room doors,
a sobbing and battered Sean Norton of Newhall Hart High tried to
explain life as a quarterback after facing the most harrowing defense
in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   "I couldn't see straight," he said. "I couldn't remember what the
stadium looked like. They were putting pressure on me all night. We
just didn't have enough time to throw."</LD>
<LD>   You've heard of the Orange Crush. What Hart endured Saturday was
the Red Crush of Mission Viejo, an unyielding defense that recorded
13 tackles for losses. Norton was sacked six times and came away with
minus-52 yards rushing, not to mention a throbbing headache.</LD>
<TE>   The Diablos (14-0) defeated Hart, 10-6, to win their second
consecutive Southern Section Division II championship. It was the
first time since 1990 that a team had held Hart (12-1-1) without a
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unbelievable," Mission Viejo linebacker Jedidiah Collins
said. "We counted on our defensive line to stop them. Everybody
played with their heart. We knew they'd never quit. We remember
they've scored 45, 46 points in games, but we knew they couldn't stop
our defensive line."</TE>
<TE>   Norton, a 5-foot-11 junior, came out of the locker room at
halftime feeling a bit light-headed after several hits in the first
half. But he probably thought he was riding the Matterhorn at
Disneyland after the opening series of the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   On consecutive plays, he lost 11 yards on a bad snap, was sacked
for minus-six yards by Justin Williams, then was dropped in the end
zone for a safety by Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't know how to block us," said Williams, who had 21
sacks this season.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the dilemma coaches faced all season against Mission
Viejo. When you try to double-team one lineman, someone else steps
up. The biggest sack of the night was made by unsung Brady Beach on
fourth down with 4:58 left on the Mission Viejo 34-yard line. That
was the last scoring threat for the Indians.</TE>
<TE>   "The defense is amazing," Mission Viejo Coach Bob Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson guided Lake Forest El Toro to three section titles during
the 1980s, but he's having the time of his life at Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years in a row of this stuff is fun," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most people assume the best team in Southern California comes out
of the Division I playoffs, but players from both teams in the
Division II game were convinced this year was an exception.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this was for the championship of Southern California,"
Collins said. "[Hart] has a great team, great coaches, but today we
outplayed them."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for Norton, he suffered the same fate every
quarterback experiences taking on the Red Crush.</TE>
<TE>   "They deserve every accolade they get," Norton said.</TE>

<LD>West Covina South Hills may have finished second to Walnut in the San
Antonio League standings, but the Huskies got the last laugh on
Saturday. And it was a big one.</LD>
<LD>   Avenging a loss seven weeks ago, South Hills won the Southern
Section Division VII championship with a 36-8 victory in front of
5,000 at Cal State Fullerton.</LD>
<LD>   "There was a lot of motivation," said South Hills lineman Michael
Armijo Jr., who had two of his team's nine sacks. "They didn't face
the real us the first time."</LD>
<TE>   In winning its third championship, South Hills (11-3) hardly
looked like the team that had five turnovers in a 30-9 loss to
Walnut. The Huskies dominated Walnut (12-2), which was playing for
its first title after having not won a playoff game since 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Tailback Stephano Smith, who missed the first game because of
arthroscopic knee surgery that kept him out of four games, rushed 23
times for 212 yards, including touchdowns of one and seven yards.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon McKinney rushed 18 times for 72 yards and scored on runs
of one and five yards, and quarterback Phillip Guerrero completed
seven of 10 passes for 155 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Payton blocked a field goal on Walnut's first possession and
intercepted two passes -- one in the end zone, the other setting up a
24-yard scoring drive following his 52-yard return on Walnut's second
possession. He has a school-record 11 interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Earnest returned a fumble 14 yards for a 36-0 lead with 31
seconds left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   -- Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   Carpinteria 26, Cerritos Valley Christian 22 -- Joel Carty scored
the game-winning touchdown on a four-yard run with 34 seconds left to
complete an undefeated season and give Carpinteria its sixth Southern
Section title in the Division XI final at Santa Barbara College.</TE>
<TE>   Carpinteria (14-0) trailed, 22-19, when it took possession at its
34-yard line with 3 minutes 30 seconds left. A 29-yard pass play from
Aaron Gonzales to tight end Evan Boardman put Carpinteria at the
Valley Christian four, and Carty plunged in one play later.</TE>
<TE>   Valley Christian tried three long passes, but the game ended when
Nick Zemke sacked quarterback Taylor Cameron as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   Valley Christian (12-2), which led, 15-12, at halftime, took a
22-19 lead on a 30-yard pass play from Cameron to Brad Boekestein
with 10:25 left to play.</TE>
<TE>   Chase Twedell, who rushed for 214 yards in the first half,
finished with 260 yards and two touchdowns in 29 carries for Valley
Christian; however, he was injured on a carry late in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Soto had 123 yards and a touchdown in 13 carries for
Carpinteria, which won its last title in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   -- Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   Ontario Christian 27, Edwards AFB Desert 19 -- Greg Talen
completed seven of 13 passes for 177 yards, including a game-winning
55-yard touchdown to Danny Belko with 26 second left in the third
quarter for the host Knights (13-1), who overcame a 13-0
second-quarter deficit to win the Division XII championship.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Robinson rushed for 97 yards and a touchdown in 20 carries,
increasing his season total to 2,195 yards, and broke up a
desperation pass at the Knights' two-yard line with no time left. Don
Vanden Berge added 80 yards in eight carries for fourth-seeded
Ontario Christian, which won its third section title and first since
1982.</TE>
<TE>   Rudy Burgess carried 12 times for 194 yards, including touchdowns
of 67 and 69 yards, and caught a 40-yard touchdown pass for the
second-seeded Scorpions (13-1).</TE>
<TE>   Talen scored the Knights' first touchdown on a five-yard run
midway through the second quarter, and Brent Vander Eyk kicked field
goals of 31 and 33 yards in the fourth quarter for Ontario Christian.</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Galluzzo</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena Poly 14, Simi Valley Grace Brethren 7 -- Galen Hall
intercepted Eric Durso's pass at the 24-yard line with 38 seconds to
play and the Panthers ran out the clock to seal the Division XIII
victory at Moorpark High.</TE>
<TE>   John Clark rushed 23 times for 187 yards, including a three-yard
touchdown run early in the second quarter. Hall scored on a 41-yard
pass from Jurdie Gaffney with less than one minute left in the first
half to give the Panthers (11-2) a 14-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Grace Brethren (10-4) mounted a nine-play, 41-yard drive on its
second possession of the third quarter and capitalized on a pass
interference call to push the ball to the seven before Durso
connected with Chad Kackert for a touchdown to pull the Lancers
within 14-7 with 4:58 left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Beau Kelsey intercepted a pass and Taylor Sergey had a blocked
punt for Grace Brethren, which played its first season of 11-man
football.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena Poly, which last won a title in 1999, outgained the
Lancers, 183-57, on the ground.</TE>

<HD>The Waves Fade After Fast Start</HD>
<DH>Short-handed Pepperdine is unable to stave off an Oregon
rally in the second half and loses, 105-90.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pepperdine Coach Paul Westphal would like to have shifted the Waves
into high gear with the benefit of a full roster Saturday night
against the high-flying Oregon Ducks.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, he had to settle for makeshift, patching together a
lineup depleted by injury, illness and foul trouble.</LD>
<LD>   The short-handed Waves put up a fight, but fifth-ranked Oregon
rallied behind forward Luke Jackson and pulled away down the stretch
for a 105-90 victory before 3,387 at Firestone Fieldhouse in Malibu.</LD>
<TE>   Although forward Glen McGowan returned from a knee injury to play
in his first game of the season, Pepperdine (3-3) was still missing
center Will Kimble, out after being diagnosed with a heart condition,
and point guard Devin Montgomery, sidelined because of a broken
thumb.</TE>
<TE>   And the 6-foot-9 McGowan didn't stick around long. He picked up
four fouls in the first half before fouling out two minutes into the
second half. Foul trouble also sent Wave center David Patten to the
bench.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have liked to see that game with our big guys not in foul
trouble," Westphal said. "It might have been a little bit different
story."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was the story for Oregon (6-0). The 6-7 junior led all
scorers with 27 points and also contributed seven rebounds, six
assists and three steals. His layup and dunk after successive steals
gave the Ducks a 70-62 lead with 13:55 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine never got closer than three after that. Forward Jimmy
Miggins had 24 points for the Waves, who went four minutes without
scoring as Oregon extended its lead to 92-79 with 4:48 left on a
three-point play by reserve center Ian Crosswhite, who scored a
career-best 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine got off to a fast start, making five of its first seven
three-point shots and taking a 33-27 lead on a close-range basket by
forward Boomer Brazzle.</TE>
<TE>   But the tide turned for the Waves after Patten was called for a
shooting foul against Jackson and drew a technical for protesting.
Jackson made four free throws, starting Oregon on a 15-2 run.</TE>
<TE>   During the stretch, Pepperdine's coaches drew another technical
when they sprang out of their chairs to argue that Jackson should
have been called for traveling. Jackson made both free throws to give
Oregon a 37-35 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Westphal blamed the technicals, both called by official Dave
Libbey, for taking the momentum away from the Waves.</TE>
<TE>   "They were absolutely the most ridiculous, unprofessional,
egotistical [technicals] I've seen in 40 years of basketball,"
Westphal said.</TE>

<HD>Sato Comes Out on Top Twice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>If Sarah Hughes was stunned when she won the gold medal at the Salt
Lake City Olympics, Yuka Sato was positively thunderstruck to learn
she had defeated Hughes and world champion Irina Slutskaya on
Saturday to win the Hallmark Skaters' Challenge.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a wonderful American Olympic champion here and a world
champion here, and it was surprising for me," said Sato, who also
finished second in the pairs event with her husband, Jason Dungjen.
"The last number was the fourth number for me today, and the crowd
supported me from beginning to end. Without their support, I'm not
sure I would have gotten through it."</LD>
<LD>   Even Hughes, still rounding into form after a torn leg muscle, was
so happy for Sato she couldn't quibble with her own third-place
finish. Sato's sweet, flowing performance to "Song of Homeland"
earned marks of 5.6 to 5.8 (out of 6.0) for skating techniques and
two 5.9s for presentation.</LD>
<TE>   "She's a great skater. I've always admired her skating since I was
younger," Hughes said of Sato, who won the 1994 world title skating
for Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes fell on her final jump in the interpretive program, a
triple toe loop, but was happy with the events of the weekend. She
learned that she had been accepted at Harvard and finished second at
the Crest Whitestrips International Challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really proud of how I handled myself," said Hughes, who
intends to compete at next month's U.S. championships at Dallas.
"It's been very, very difficult, especially to get back into the
mindset."</TE>
<TE>   Olympic men's champion Alexei Yagudin, second after the short
program, rallied past Michael Weiss to win the $30,000 first prize.
He earned two 6.0s for his routine to the aptly named "Overcome," as
he overcame a painful hip injury to win the hearts of the crowd of
5,173.</TE>
<TE>   Six-time U.S. champion Todd Eldredge, who said Saturday he won't
defend his title, finished third. Eldredge said his exit from the
Olympic-eligible ranks was hastened by the U.S. Figure Skating
Assn.'s decision to rescind an offer it made to him in June for him
to compete in pro-am events and appear at clinics on its behalf.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't say if he attributed the snub to his decision to sign
with Stars on Ice, which isn't sanctioned by the USFSA. The rival
Champions on Ice troupe has long been sanctioned by the USFSA.</TE>
<TE>   John LeFevre, executive director of the USFSA, said the
organization hadn't turned against Eldredge because of his Stars on
Ice deal. "No agreement was signed," LeFevre said of the USFSA's
offer to him.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic co-gold medalists Jamie Sale and David Pelletier won the
pairs title. Sato and Dungjen were second, followed by Olympic bronze
medalists Xue Shen and Hongbo Zhao of China and Qing Pang and Jian
Tong of China.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Loyola Marymount point guard Charles Brown picked a good night to
lead a young Lion team out of post-finals doldrums.</LD>
<LD>   Brown had career-highs with 16 points, eight rebounds and eight
assists as Loyola remained undefeated at home with a 76-68 victory
over Long Beach State in front of 1,302 Saturday night at Gersten
Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   The Lions (5-3) let a 16-point second-half lead dwindle to five in
the last two minutes but it didn't keep them from improving to 4-0 at
home.</LD>
<TE>   Guard Brandon Worthy had 14 points off the bench and forward Andy
Osborn had 12.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Coach Steve Aggers praised Brown's most complete
performance to date.</TE>
<TE>   "He still made some turnovers that I think is just because of his
inexperience," Aggers said. "But he had a great summer and he bulked
up in the weight room in preparation for this year. He's got the
weight of our team on his shoulders.'</TE>
<TE>   Osborn's three-point basket gave the Lions a 56-40 lead but the
struggling 49ers didn't go away easily.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach guard Tony Darden scored all 18 of his points in the
second half, but Loyola made 11 of 12 free throws in the last 2:30 to
pull away.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very emotionally lethargic because we just came off
finals," Aggers said. "It was frustrating because even though we got
a big lead, we couldn't extend it. But we did what we had to do to
win."</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach State (1-6), which committed 20 turnovers, dropped its
fifth in a row and only has a victory over Cal State Monterey Bay, an
NAIA school.</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge 92, San Jose State 67 -- Ian Boylan had 23
points, Armand Thomas had a career-high 16 points and the Matadors
led by as many as 29 in front of 1,113 fans at home.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose State never led and never threatened, as the Matadors
scored at will down low, from three-point range and in transition
after several San Jose State turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Scoring and stealing has been a theme lately for Northridge (5-2),
which lit up Bethany College, an NAIA school, 117-51, last Saturday,
and set a school record with 26 steals.</TE>
<TE>   The next few weeks will be more telling for the Matadors. After a
home game against Loyola Marymount, they play at Southern Illinois
and at Washington before opening Big West Conference play at home
against Utah State on Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "The next few weeks is strictly business for us," said Thomas, a
senior who redshirted at San Jose State as a freshman before
transferring. "We've raised the bar to where we're going to play."</TE>
<TE>   Northridge junior guard Justice Graham, who is averaging 6.4
points, has been suspended indefinitely because for behavior
detrimental to the team.</TE>
<TE>   Oudie Baker had 23 points for San Jose State (3-4). Freshman
forward Antonio Lawrence, the Spartans' second-leading scorer at nine
points a game, did not play because he was suspended for undisclosed
team reasons.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   Idaho State 79, Cal State Fullerton 70 -- Guard Marquis Poole
scored 20 points and teammate Scott Henry chipped in 17 points and 11
rebounds to lead the Bengals (3-4) over the host Titans (1-6).</TE>
<TE>   David Schroeder and Jeremy Brown scored 13 points each for Idaho
State, which was coming off a 10-day layoff.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton center Pape Sow fought off a mild strain of his right
ankle that happened just before halftime and led all scorers with 21
points. Ralphy Holmes scored 14 and Derick Andrew had 11 for
Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton forward Bron Groomes, who scored five points, suffered
an injured ankle with 14:14 left and did not return, hurting
Fullerton, which was out-rebounded, 41-25.</TE>
<TE>   Sow's basket with 12:48 left tied the score at 45-45. But 40
seconds later Poole, who played at Compton Centennial High, started
an 8-0 Bengal run with a three-point play.</TE>
<TE>   Sow's three-pointer with 8:15 left cut Idaho State's lead to it
54-51, but the Bengals recovered to lead by as many as 10 points.</TE>
<TE>   -- Paul McLeod</TE>
<TE>   UC Riverside 71, UC Santa Cruz 58 -- Freshman forward Nate Carter
had game-highs of 17 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Highlanders
(1-2) over the visiting Banana Slugs (0-6).</TE>

<HD>USC Behind Schedule After 71-39 Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Terry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC Coach Chris Gobrecht had good intentions when she drafted a
schedule that included top-10 teams Kansas State, Notre Dame,
Connecticut and Saturday's opponent, Tennessee.</LD>
<LD>   But following a 71-39 loss to the fourth-ranked Lady Vols before
3,322 at the Forum -- including members of the 1983 and 1984 USC
national championship teams -- and a national television audience,
Gobrecht wondered if the 4-4 Trojans were on the road to perdition
instead of the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<LD>   "It might have been a mistake to schedule as many of these top-10
opponents as we did so close together," Gobrecht said. "I believe we
will survive on the other side of it; they say that what doesn't kill
you makes you stronger.</LD>
<TE>   "But psychologically and emotionally, we've just not had a chance
to recover each time and reload our spirit before we had to face the
other one. You could tell we were kinda running on empty
emotionally."</TE>
<TE>   The 7-1 Lady Vols, whose only loss was to top-ranked Duke, can do
that to teams.</TE>
<TE>   In its last game, against Louisiana Tech on Dec. 4, Tennessee won,
60-35, Louisiana Tech's lowest point total ever. On Saturday the Vols
held the Trojans to their lowest point total ever.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee ran countless fast breaks, outrebounded USC, 42-28, and
forced the Trojans into yet another bad shooting day (16 for 56,
28.6%) with an array of stifling zone defenses.</TE>
<TE>   The game was close for 7 1/2 minutes, after which USC led, 11-6.
But the Trojan offense was turned to ice by Tennessee, which closed
the half with a 22-3 run for a 28-14 halftime lead. The 14 points, on
six-for-22 shooting, were the fewest ever scored by the Trojans in a
first half.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we matched USC's intensity early," Tennessee Coach Pat
Summitt said. "I knew it would be challenging for us on the boards,
and we really concentrated on that."</TE>
<TE>   There was no letup by Tennessee in the second half. The visitors
would lead by as many as 34 points on the way to their fifth
consecutive victory over USC.</TE>
<TE>   USC's previous low was 40 points against Washington in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Shyra Ely and Kara Lawson led Tennessee with 16 points each. Ebony
Hoffman was the only Trojan in double figures (10 points), and she
left the game in the final minutes after catching an elbow in the
face and bleeding through the nose. After the game, Hoffman was taken
to USC University Hospital for a CT scan. She was diagnosed with a
mild concussion but was cleared to rejoin the team when her headaches
subside.</TE>
<TE>   Gobrecht showed some anger afterward. Asked if she thought the
contact was incidental, Gobrecht replied, "What do you think? I think
it's pretty sad you have to clear your elbows like that when you're
up 30."</TE>
<TE>   It was the kind of fire USC could have used more of Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Elloluv Doesn't Lose Composure in Starlet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last thing that trainer Craig Dollase said to Pat Valenzuela on
Saturday as he gave him a leg up on the filly Elloluv in the Starlet
Stakes was, "Don't look at the odds."</LD>
<LD>   "I can't read them, anyway," said Valenzuela, who 10 minutes later
was smiling with Dollase in the Hollywood Park winner's circle after
riding Elloluv, a 30-1 longshot, to the biggest upset in the 22-year
history of the Starlet. Second to Elloluv in the $366,500 race was
Composure, who at 1-5 odds was beaten by four lengths.</LD>
<LD>   If a Grade I race ever looked like a slam-dunk, it was the
Starlet. Composure was running for the first time since coming within
a half-length of beating the undefeated Storm Flag Flying in the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, and none of her six opponents had
ever won a stakes race. Elloluv, who had broken her maiden about a
month ago, went into the 1 1/16-mile race off only two starts.</LD>
<TE>   "Realistically," Dollase said, "we were looking for a stakes
placing. But this filly had also been training awfully well and we
were hoping that she might jump up and run a real big race."</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Dollase's biggest client, J. Paul Reddam -- and named
after the way Reddam's wife Zillah greets friends with her English
accent -- Elloluv was purchased for $120,000 after Dollase had picked
her out of an auction of unraced 2-year-olds at Keeneland in April.
Elloluv's payoff of $63.60 broke the Starlet record of $52.60 that
was set by Cheval Volant in 1989. Saturday's time was 1:42 4/5.</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela, who had three victories Saturday, sent the filly to
the lead out of the gate. Composure, who broke from the outside post
under Mike Smith, moved third place after six furlongs, but never
threatened.</TE>
<TE>   With $752,000 of the $801,000 bet on Composure in the show pool,
there was a shortage of $130,906, money Hollywood Park had to pay in
order to give bettors the required nickel on a dollar.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the last jump, Piensa Sonando, under Laffit Pincay, beat
Fleetstreet Dancer by a head in the $100,000 Native Diver Handicap to
give owner Nelson Bunker Hunt his first stakes victory at Hollywood
Park since 1987.</TE>

<LD>The seven fillies and mares entered in today's $150,000 Bayakoa
Handicap haven't won many races in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Top Of Our Game, Secret Of Mecca, Netherland, Polaire, Cee's
Elegance, Angel Gift and Starrer have combined for six victories this
year, and three of the seven ladies haven't won since 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Starrer, the likely favorite, is zero for five in 2002, with her
last victory coming in the Bayakoa last year. If she repeats today,
she'll be the second filly or mare to do so. Manistique won the Grade
II in both 1998 and '99.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by George Krikorian and now trained by John Shirreffs after
beginning her career in the Dave Hofmans barn, Starrer, a 4-year-old
daughter of Dynaformer, has been facing better competition lately
than what will line up against her this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, Starrer was fourth in the Breeders' Cup Distaff,
finishing behind probable horse of the year Azeri, likely 3-year-old
filly champion Farda Amiga and multiple stakes winner Imperial
Gesture. Patrick Valenzuela has the mount and the $35,000 yearling
has earned two of her three wins at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Golden Arrow, who has been second in his last two
on grass, will try to break through in the fifth, an optional claimer
at one mile on turf. Victor Espinoza will ride the son of Rahy for
trainer Neil Drysdale.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Itsallintheheart. The 6-year-old gelding will try for
his fifth win in a row in today's fourth at Golden Gate Fields.
Claimed for $10,000 by trainer and co-owner Jerry Hollendorfer on
Aug. 24, Itsallintheheart has won while moving up the ladder and will
be taking on $40,000 claimers today.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in today's sixth at Golden Gate. The 11
original entrants are a combined 0 for 106.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta in the sixth keying Go Natalie Go
on top with Milagra, Stormy Spirit and Forty Pureza in the two hole
with all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/73. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $24.60/$424.80. Total money bet: $494.</TE>

<LD>UCLA is one victory away from its fourth NCAA men's soccer
championship, but standing in its way is a familiar opponent.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins play Stanford in today's title match at Gerald J. Ford
Stadium in Dallas. If recent meetings against the Cardinal are an
indicator, it could be a joyous airplane ride back home to Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA (17-3-3) won both meetings with Stanford this season by 1-0
scores, a big part of why the Bruins won the Pacific 10 Conference
championship. Forward Matt Taylor expects another close match.</LD>
<TE>   "It always seems to come down to the end," said Taylor, who scored
the first goal in a 2-1 semifinal victory Friday over Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford (18-4-2) advanced to its second consecutive College Cup
and third overall. The Cardinal defeated Creighton, 2-1, in the
semifinals to reach their second title match. They lost to Indiana in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   It will be the first NCAA title match between two West Coast teams

<DL></DL>
<LD>She's got gold, she's got silver, she's got bronze. What more could a
woman want? Diamonds, maybe?</LD>
<LD>   Mia Hamm, who for a dozen years or so has been the darling of
women's soccer fans worldwide, is someone else's darling now. Nomar
Garciaparra's, to be precise.</LD>
<LD>   They are engaged to be married, the Boston Red Sox shortstop
perhaps having come to the conclusion that if he can't win a world
championship, at least he can win a world champion.</LD>
<TE>   The Boston Herald broke the news, with the Miami Herald (no
relation) adding the tidbit that Garciaparra was "shopping for a
$50,000 rock."</TE>
<TE>   "It's true, we got engaged over Thanksgiving," Garciaparra, 29,
told the Boston Herald.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to know where and when we're getting married, but you
now what, I don't even know those details. We're just really happy
right now and really enjoying our time together."</TE>
<TE>   Besides winning two world championships and her Olympic gold and
silver medals, Hamm, 30, was named FIFA World Player of the Year in
2001 and is one of three finalists -- along with China's Sun Wen and
Germany's Birgit Prinz -- for this year's award.</TE>
<TE>   That ceremony takes place in Madrid on Tuesday during the 12th
annual FIFA Gala.</TE>
<TE>   A Star Is Born</TE>
<TE>   Had the nominations for the FIFA awards been made a little later
and had the national team coaches who made those nominations paid a
bit more attention, Christine Sinclair surely would have been a
finalist.</TE>
<TE>   The 19-year-old Canadian star-in-the-making has enjoyed a
phenomenal year. Just consider:</TE>
<TE>   * In September, she scored a tournament-high 10 goals in leading
host Canada to the silver medal at the first FIFA Under-19 Women's
World Championship, won by the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   * In November, she scored a tournament-high seven goals while
helping Canada finish second to the U.S. in the CONCACAF Women's Gold
Cup and thereby qualify for the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup in China.</TE>
<TE>   * In December, she scored both goals, including the game-winner in
overtime, in a 2-1 victory over defending champion Santa Clara to
lead the University of Portland to its first NCAA women's title.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Sinclair set an NCAA tournament record of 21 points
with 10 goals and one assist, bettering the mark of 16 points set in
1993 by -- who else? -- Hamm.</TE>
<TE>   No Credibility</TE>
<TE>   The English-language online version of the Russian newspaper
Pravda apparently has no more credibility than the Russian newsprint
version.</TE>
<TE>   On the eve of Thursday's vote to select the host for the 2008
European Championship, Pravda reported that "Russia was confidently
leading the list of candidates" and that its bid was supported by
"almost 56%" of those surveyed by UEFA, whereas the joint bid by
Austria and Switzerland had garnered only 0.28% of the votes.</TE>
<TE>   The Austrians and Swiss, overwhelming winners, no doubt are still
laughing about that.</TE>
<TE>   Sigi's Dilemma</TE>
<TE>   The Asian Football Confederation and the Oceania Football
Confederation have agreed on the dates for next year's AFC/OFC
Challenge Cup, and Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid would like to get on the
phone and tell them to start over.</TE>
<TE>   The two confederations announced Friday that Asian Games champion
Iran would play Oceania champion New Zealand in Auckland, New
Zealand, on March 28 and again in Tehran on April 4.</TE>
<TE>   Considering that April 4 is the day before the Galaxy begins
defense of its Major League Soccer championship and that New Zealand
is likely to want Galaxy midfielder Simon Elliott for both games,
something has to give.</TE>
<TE>   Chances are, Schmid will figure out a way to keep Elliott in April
in return for releasing him in June, when New Zealand plays in the
eight-nation FIFA Confederations Cup in France.</TE>
<TE>   War Games</TE>
<TE>   Should war break out in Iraq, one of the victims will be the FIFA
World Youth Championship, scheduled to be held a short voyage down
the Persian Gulf in the United Arab Emirates cities of Abu Dhabi,
Dubai, Al Ain and Sharjah.</TE>
<TE>   Monitoring events closely is FIFA, which said that the March
25-April 16 tournament, in which the U.S., Canada and Mexico are
among 16 teams playing, would be moved in the event of war.</TE>
<TE>   Where it would be moved to, FIFA would not say.</TE>
<TE>   Potter-ing About</TE>
<TE>   On a happier note comes this delightful tale from England, which
as any Harry Potter fan knows, is the home of best-selling author
J.K. Rowling.</TE>
<TE>   It seems that Potter fans have noticed that the claret and amber
scarves worn by supporters of the English club Bradford City are
almost identical to the ones worn by Potter and his schoolmates in
the hugely popular movie series.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, they are flying off the shelves like, well, magic.</TE>
<TE>   The club normally sells about 100 scarves a month, but has sold
more than 10,000 this year.</TE>

<HD>Will McGriff Get First Dibs?</HD>
<DH>Free-agent first baseman says he is interested in Dodgers,
and feeling is mutual. But Evans is weighing all his options.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>While the Dodgers continued to explore options Saturday in another
slow day at the baseball winter meetings, Fred McGriff offered at
least one solution to fill their opening at first base.</LD>
<LD>   "I hear they're looking, they've got a great organization that
wants to win and that's the main thing I'm looking for," the All-Star
first baseman said from his home in Tampa, Fla. "The Dodgers are one
of the teams I watched play a lot last year on TV, and they were
always real competitive.</LD>
<LD>   "You could see those guys had the right attitude when they went
out there, and that's why they had a good year. They were in the
[National League wild-card] race until the end and were one of the
best teams in the league. San Francisco beat them at the end, but
they were in it and that's what counts."</LD>
<TE>   Especially for McGriff, who at 39 is eager to acquire another
championship ring after helping the Atlanta Braves win the 1995 World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are among the clubs at the top of the free agent's
list, and the feeling is mutual, although thorough General Manager
Dan Evans is considering many plans to bolster the batting order and
help overburdened slugger Shawn Green. Evans on Saturday contacted
McGriff's agent and McGriff, who had a salary of $7.25 million in
2002, is willing to work with the Dodgers on a one-year deal that
would address the club's luxury-tax concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves and other clubs are pursuing McGriff, and Evans might
take a different road, including acquiring an outfielder and moving
Green to first base, but McGriff believes he could enjoy life at
Chavez Ravine.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the years, everyone knows what the Dodgers are about," he
said. "They have all that tradition, so they're one of those
organizations that you can't ignore.</TE>
<TE>   "You know about the type of players they've had there and what
they try to do every year. They've had a lot of great players and won
a lot, and now it looks like they're really ready to get back to
that."</TE>
<TE>   McGriff could help the process, fulfilling the Dodgers' desire to
increase run production at first.</TE>
<TE>   Although he hit only .273 last season with the Chicago Cubs,
McGriff had 30 home runs, 103 runs batted in and a .505 slugging
percentage. He needs only 22 homers to join the 500-homer club -- an
added benefit for one of pro sports' most marketing-conscious
franchises.</TE>
<TE>   McGriff's age apparently isn't a concern for the Dodgers, and
scouts at the meetings said he's still a skilled hitter after 16
seasons in the major leagues. McGriff is limited defensively, scouts
added, but the Dodgers are confident that any first baseman would
benefit from the range of middle infielders Alex Cora, Cesar Izturis
and rookie Joe Thurston, expected to start at second.</TE>
<TE>   "I take a lot of pride in my game," McGriff said. "I still enjoy
playing this game and I've been working out since October. I know
what I can do."</TE>
<TE>   Although Green volunteered to move to first, the Gold Glove right
fielder conceded Saturday "it would be a big adjustment and I realize
it's definitely not an easy adjustment." McGriff said Green belongs
in the outfield.</TE>
<TE>   "Shawn Green is an All-Star outfielder," McGriff said. "Why would
you want to move an All-Star? Maybe they won't have to."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are proud of left-hander Jarrod Washburn, who emerged
as one of the majors' premier starters as the Angels won the World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   "He answered a lot of questions this year," Manager Mike Scioscia
said. "Our goal was always to become a World Series club, and your
No. 1 guy has to have his stuff Oct. 15 just like he had it April 15.
Wash was able to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that doesn't mean the Angels plan to reward the
arbitration-eligible pitcher with a multiyear contract.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a multiyear deal. We control him for '03, '04 and '05,"
General Manager Bill Stoneman said, meaning Washburn can't become a
free agent for another three seasons. "He can't go anywhere. The only
question is, what's he going to be paid? The contract that he has is
a three-year contract."</TE>
<TE>   Well, that's the club's perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn views things differently, agent Scott Boras said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the No. 1 starter on a world championship team as a
three-year player, which is a pretty rare accomplishment, but that's
the club's choice," Boras said. "They approached us about a multiyear
contract last year, but we felt it wasn't in our best interest
because Jarrod hadn't really reached the plateau that he reached this
year. You take it as it comes."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn figures to get a big raise on his $350,000 salary after
going 18-6 with a 3.15 earned-run average, pitching 206 innings and
limiting opponents to a .235 batting average. Stoneman has not ruled
out a multiyear contract for the Angels' top starter, but intimated
reaching a deal won't be easy.</TE>
<TE>   "What players like Wash want is salary certainty or salary
guarantees," he said. "What you've got to look at is both sides have
to trade something off to do a multiyear deal. It's totally a
function of dollars."</TE>

<LD>Former Dodger owner Walter O'Malley, former major league managers
Dick Williams, Billy Martin and Whitey Herzog and former commissioner
Bowie Kuhn are among those on the veterans' ballot for induction into
baseball's Hall of Fame.</LD>
<LD>   Another former manager, Gene Mauch, was on the preliminary list
but failed to make the cut. He was in pretty good company, though.
Another who missed was one George W. Bush, former managing partner of
the Texas Rangers.</LD>

season, counting base salary only?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Turnabout: Seattle fans have enjoyed the Japanese pipeline that
brought Ichiro Suzuki and Kazuhiro Sasaki to the Northwest. Now the
tables have turned.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Sapp, former Pac-10 lineman of the year at Washington, is one

Sapp recently scored a first-round TKO over three-time World Grand

<TE>   Hype school hoops: Chicago Sun-Times columnist Jay Mariotti wasn't
overly impressed with the TV showing of Ohio prep phenom LeBron
James.</TE>
<TE>   "Before James is anointed as anything but The Next Struggling NBA
Rookie, he should learn to shoot a jumper that doesn't hit iron or
glass, a malaise that continues to infect the nation's hoops youth.
The verdict: Spend less time in the air, more time on the perimeter,
and check back with me in a year or two."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More of the same: Writes ESPN.com columnist Charley Rosen about
James: "His transition from offense to defense is shameful. Instead
of hustling downcourt, he lingers near the ball, hoping for a steal.
His post-up defense offers less resistance than a short summer's
breeze. In short, LeBron James can't guard his own shadow."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Financial statement: When the $5-million NASCAR Winston Cup awards
ceremony in New York coincided with the Perris Auto Speedway awards
banquet at Harrison Hall on the Lake Perris Fairgrounds, a Perris
press release stated, "The PASSCAR stock car drivers will be dividing
up approximately $4,996,000.00 less than their NASCAR counterparts."</TE>

<TE>   "We thought it'd make the perfect Christmas gift for people," said
Daniel Hooper, the school's marketing director.</TE>
<TE>   Then Dennis Franchione, who had led the Crimson Tide to a 10-3
record this year, quit to coach Texas A&amp;M. Now, Hooper is asking $15
each for 1,000 dolls, in hopes of recouping his $15,000 cost, and

<HD>It All Evens Out for the Clippers</HD>
<DH>Miller and Brand are impressive in a 94-83 win at Houston,
which ends a 2-2 trip and gives team the same record on the road and
at home.</DH>

<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Youthful, inconsistent, injured team hits road.</LD>
<LD>   Road hits back.</LD>
<LD>   That's the expected scenario whenever the Clippers leave Southern
California this season. Except that for the second time, the Clippers
showed their depths instead of sinking to them while away from
Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, the Clippers on Saturday displayed a poised, resilient
style of play rarely seen at home, taking a 94-83 victory from the
Houston Rockets before 13,144 at the Compaq Center and evening their
four-game trip to Louisiana and Texas at 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers also finished with a 2-2 mark on a four-game trip
last month to Philadelphia, New Jersey, Orlando and Miami. They are
5-7 on the road and 5-7 at Staples Center, where they play 11 of
their next 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, the Clippers' inexperience didn't overwhelm them during
crunch time. Their confidence swelled as the minutes ticked by
against the Rockets, whose seven-game home winning streak ended.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, the Clippers were not flawless, but there were few signs of
the halting steps they took in squandering double-digit leads in the
not-too-distant past.</TE>
<TE>   The ball was in the right hands at the right moments Saturday,
which meant point guard Andre Miller and power forward Elton Brand
had their fingerprints all over the Clippers' 10th victory in 24
games this season. Each scored 27 points, each retreating to the
locker room at game's end to have ice applied to injured body parts.</TE>
<TE>   Miller had his sprained left ankle soaking in an ice bucket and
Brand had an enormous ice pack strapped around his right thigh.</TE>
<TE>   "Excellent," Brand said of Miller. "He played great. He hit big
shots. Played good defense. I thought he looked like he was back to
normal. I asked him about it, but he said, 'No way. It's still
killing me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Miller's bum ankle certainly looked as if it slowed him during
Friday's loss to the Spurs at San Antonio, when he missed 10 of 13
shots en route to seven points and six assists in 29 minutes. He
looked rejuvenated Saturday against the Rockets, making 10 of 15
shots and adding six assists in 44 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Brand, who is listed at 6 feet 8, did his best work against Yao
Ming (7-5), Kelvin Cato (6-11), Eddie Griffin (6-10) and Terence
Morris (6-9). Not all at once, mind you, but at various moments,
Brand battled all of them for inside position and for rebounds. He
would make 12 of 21 shots and take 16 rebounds, including seven on
the offensive end, and add four blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   Brand swatted one of Yao's nine attempts, trigging a fastbreak
that led to his short jump shot and a 66-55 lead midway through the
third quarter. Yao would score 16 points and take nine rebounds in 36
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   But with Miller and Brand guiding them with steady hands, the
Clippers never trailed and led by as much as 40-24 early in the
second quarter. They held a double-digit lead for most of the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "Once again, Elton is Elton," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said.
"Every game he gives you everything he has. I just think the guy is
an All-Star."</TE>
<TE>   A first-time All-Star last season, Brand is tied with Kevin
Garnett of the Minnesota Timberwolves with 20 games with 10 or more
points and rebounds, tops in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Like Miller, Brand struggled at times Friday against the Spurs. He
had 16 points and 14 rebounds, a monster game for many power
forwards, but also was frustrated by suffocating pressure from Tim
Duncan, David Robinson and Kevin Willis -- San Antonio's three-headed
7-foot monster.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of looking forward to a day off today, the Clippers went
at the Rockets (12-10) from the start. By taking an early lead, the
Clippers kept the pressure on Houston, particularly on guard Steve
Francis.</TE>
<TE>   Badgered by Miller, Francis scored 14 points on five-for-18
shooting, well off his season average of 24.3 points. Cuttino Mobley
led the Rockets with 19 points on eight-for-17 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "We came out and played well," Miller said. "Everybody played
well. We were basically doing what we wanted to do."</TE>

<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>There has been a good deal of hand-wringing recently among the
Clipper coaches about the team's poor shooting. The Clippers began
Saturday's game ranked 15th among the 29 NBA teams with a 43.8%
shooting percentage.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got to start making shots," Coach Alvin Gentry said after
the team's 32-for-85 shooting (37.6%) in Friday's loss to the Spurs.
"We've got to step up and make shots. It's a pretty simple game."</LD>
<LD>   The coaches are thought to be especially concerned about point
guard Andre Miller, who has been hobbled by a sprained left ankle
since Nov. 29 and was shooting 40.7% in 22 games before Saturday's
game against the Rockets.</LD>
<TE>   For one game, at least, the coaches could stop worrying.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Miller's 10-for-15 shooting and 27 points, the Clippers
made 39 of 81 shots (48.1%) en route to a 94-83 victory over Houston.
Marko Jaric made six of 14 shots, scored 13 points and added eight
assists.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to make some of those outside shots in order to open it
up inside for Michael [Olowokandi] and Elton [Brand]," Gentry said.
"Marko helped open things up for Michael and Elton."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eric Piatkowski sat out his second game because of a lower
abdominal strain and said he expects to be sidelined for Monday's
game against the Spurs at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "No way," he said when asked if he would play Monday. "Unless
there is a dramatic improvement. If I'm not 100%, then I'll just
re-aggravate it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have won five consecutive games against the Rockets,
including both this season.... The Rockets were without forward Kenny
Thomas, who has a sprained right ankle. Eddie Griffin filled in for
Thomas, drawing Brand as his defensive assignment.... The Clippers
outrebounded Houston 44-36, taking 15 offensive rebounds.</TE>

<LD>Pittsburgh's Mario Lemieux makes his first appearance in the
Arrowhead Pond since 1996, when the Penguins play the Ducks tonight.
That gives the Mighty Ducks a formidable task.</LD>
<LD>   Lemieux was leading the NHL in scoring with 53 points through
Friday's games. He has gotten at least one point in 13 consecutive
games.</LD>
<LD>   "This is going to be fun," Duck goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere
said. "But we can't just stand around all night and look at him. We
have to play our game."</LD>
<TE>   With Lemieux slicing and dicing opponents, the Penguins have the
NHL's top power play, scoring at an incredible 30% before Saturday's
game.</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux leads the league in power-play assists and is tied for
third in power-play goals. The Penguins have three of the top four
players in power-play points, with Lemieux, Alexei Kovalev and Dick
Tarnstrom.</TE>
<TE>   "We are 93.8% on penalty killing the last five games," Duck Coach
Mike Babcock said. "Of course I say that, and here comes Lemieux.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel pretty good about our power play. We're at 17% and that's
about half of what Pittsburgh is doing. No one has been able to stop
Mario.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to do what you can. You have to limit his touches
and limit his opportunities. That means being disciplined and staying
out of the penalty box."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Giguere, who is 4-1-1 with a 1.48 goals-against average in his
last six games, has his own streak. He has successive shutouts and
has not allowed a goal in 140 minutes 15 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't not to think about things like that," Giguere said. "I
know I am going to give up goal sometime. I will just focus on making
all the saves I can. Let's just say there is a better chance that
Mario will score than me getting the shutout."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks want to send forward Mike Brown to minor league
Cincinnati to get more playing time, but first have to place him on
waivers, which they did on Friday. Teams have until Tuesday to claim
Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who has been used on the fourth line, has been a healthy
scratch the last six games. The Ducks claimed him off waivers from
Vancouver at the start of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks will likely recall rookie forward Alexei Smirnov after
the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. Pittsburgh, 5 p.m., Ch. 9</TE>
<TE>   Site -- Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KPLS (830).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Ducks 12-9-6-3, Penguins 11-12-3-3.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Penguins (2001-02) -- 1-1-0-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- Duck defenseman Ruslan Salei went through a full workout
during practice Saturday but will not play tonight because of a
strained right side. Left wing Martin Straka (strained hamstring) may
return tonight for the Penguins.</TE>

<HD>Palmer Coasts to Trophy</HD>
<DH>He becomes USC's fifth Heisman winner with a surprisingly
comfortable victory</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Carson Palmer gazed upon the stage at the Yale Club on Saturday night
and saw a gathering of former Heisman Trophy winners that included
Mike Garrett, the first of four USC players to win the award.</LD>
<LD>   Just as this year's announcement ceremony was about to begin,
Palmer received a good-luck phone call from Marcus Allen, the last
Trojan winner.</LD>
<LD>   Not long after, history came to pass.</LD>
<TE>   Palmer straight-armed tradition and won the 68th Heisman Trophy,
the first Trojan quarterback to be recognized as college football's
most outstanding player.</TE>
<TE>   "You never think it can happen to you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, who passed for 3,639 yards and 32 touchdowns this season,
outdistanced Iowa quarterback Brad Banks, Penn State running back
Larry Johnson, Miami running back Willis McGahee and Hurricane
quarterback Ken Dorsey to become the first Heisman winner from a West
Coast school since Allen in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time we got a quarterback," said a giddy Garrett,
USC's athletic director.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll nervously watched the announcement on
television from his home after overseeing practice earlier in the
day.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll, who guided the Trojans to a 10-2 record and a berth in
the Orange Bowl against Iowa on Jan. 2, said Palmer achieved the
pinnacle this season with help from offensive coordinator Norm Chow,
quarterbacks coach Steve Sarkisian and his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great reward for a great season for everyone who was
involved," said Carroll, who will arrive in New York today and attend
Monday's formal presentation dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, who has passed for 11,515 yards in his career, said
Carroll and Chow helped him learn "how to be a man. How to be a
leader." He also thanked his teammates, who helped him put together
USC's best season since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't be more honored to take this trophy back to share with
my teammates in Los Angeles," he said. "This award is every bit
theirs as mine."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer's performance against the toughest schedule in the nation
and his showcase effort in the regular-season finale against Notre
Dame were enough to sway Heisman voters in six regions across the
country.</TE>
<TE>   It was supposed to be one of the closest votes in Heisman history,
but like many of the victories that Palmer engineered during a
season-ending seven game winning streak, it turned into a rout.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer's name appeared on 620 of a potential 921 ballots. He
received the most first, second and third-place votes to total 1,328
points. Banks, who will play against Palmer in the Orange Bowl,
totaled 1,095. The 233 differential was not even close to the 10
tightest races in Heisman history.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer won five of the six regions, losing only the Midwest region
to Banks.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people have talked about the East Coast bias," Palmer
said. "I think this kind of answers that."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said he benefited from a lack of preseason Heisman hype
that seemed to hurt Dorsey, who finished fifth in Heisman voting this
year after placing third last year. Dorsey is 38-1 as a starter and
has the Hurricanes on the verge of their second consecutive national
title.</TE>
<TE>   "I made lots of mistakes early," Palmer said. "Luckily they
weren't all on national TV."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, however, was at his best when the national spotlight was
on the Trojans. And he owes a debt of gratitude to Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Without the Fighting Irish, and his nationally televised,
prime-time torching of their vaunted secondary, Palmer might not have
overcome Banks or Johnson, who became only the ninth Division I-A
player to rush for more than 2,000 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer finished a brilliant regular season by passing for 425
yards and four touchdowns in a 44-13 rout of Notre Dame, which was
ranked second in the nation in pass-efficiency defense. It was the
most passing yards and most touchdowns ever against the Fighting
Irish.</TE>
<TE>   "We were fortunate to be in that game and have the national
attention we did around that game," Palmer said. "I think that might
have been what put [me] over the top."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer's road to the top was hardly smooth.</TE>
<TE>   He played for two head coaches and three offensive coordinators
after he arrived at USC from Santa Margarita High in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Under first-year coach Paul Hackett, Palmer shared time with Mike
Van Raaphorst during the first eight games of his freshman season,
then became only the second player in school history to start as a
true freshman. He finished the season with 1,755 passing yards, seven
touchdowns and six interceptions and appeared primed for a big
sophomore season.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, however, suffered a broken collarbone in the third game
against Oregon and was sidelined the rest of the 1999 season.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Palmer passed for 2,914 yards, but he had more
interceptions (18) than touchdown passes (16). The Trojans completed
the season with a loss to Notre Dame, and Hackett was replaced by
Carroll, who promptly hired Chow.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Palmer passed for 2,717 yards and 13 touchdowns with
12 interceptions as the Trojans overcame a 1-4 start to finish 6-6.</TE>
<TE>   When he appeared on the cover of several regional publications
before this season, he dismissed the publicity as unwarranted.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of that stuff about me is false -- the Golden Boy, Golden
Arm ... I haven't done anything yet. I haven't won any big games," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer was instrumental in the Trojans' season-opening victory
over Auburn and also played well against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Winning the Heisman in Manhattan on Saturday was a bit ironic
because his splendid season could have been derailed Sept. 21 in
Manhattan, Kan., when USC lost to Kansas State, 27-20.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer completed only 18 of 47 passes for 186 yards that day as
Trojan receivers dropped eight passes.</TE>
<TE>   Two games later, Palmer took a critical sack in overtime against
Washington State and the Trojans lost, 30-27.</TE>
<TE>   But that was the last time Palmer and the Trojans struggled.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer passed for 2,006 yards and 23 touchdowns in the final six
games.</TE>
<TE>   Chow, who coached 1990 Heisman Trophy winner Ty Detmer at Brigham
Young, said there was no secret to Palmer's success this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Just hard work," said Chow, who also will fly in for Monday's
dinner. "He realized what it was going to take. He was always a young
man that wanted to do well. The guys gave him confidence, they voted
him captain and they started playing well.</TE>
<TE>   "It steamrolled into a pretty good thing."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer joins a Heisman club that includes 67 previous winners and
an even more exclusive fraternity of USC players who won the award.</TE>
<TE>   Garrett said USC officials would be clearing space in Heritage
Hall to make way for Palmer's Heisman Trophy and No. 3 jersey. They
will be displayed with those of 1965 winner Garrett, 1968 winner O.J.
Simpson, 1979 winner Charles White and 1981 winner Allen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Tailback U, it will always be Tailback U," Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   But a pretty good quarterback passed through.</TE>

<HD>Mission Viejo Has to Get Defensive</HD>
<DH>Diablos win second consecutive Division II title by holding
high-powered Hart in check, 10-6.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You know all those stories about the Mission Viejo High defense?</LD>
<LD>   About how it can flatten elusive running backs, pester
strong-armed quarterbacks and generally reduce even the most
productive offenses to mush?</LD>
<LD>   They're all true.</LD>
<TE>   The Diablos put on a show to remember in the Southern Section
Division II championship game on Saturday, registering six sacks and
13 tackles for losses during a come-from-behind 10-6 victory over
Newhall Hart before 8,036 at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   The defense intercepted two passes from usually reliable
quarterback Sean Norton and limited the Indians to 44 second-half
yards in leading top-seeded Mission Viejo (14-0) to its second
consecutive section title.</TE>
<TE>   The Diablos, who stretched their winning streak to 28 games, also
ended Hart's 35-game unbeaten streak by handing the second-seeded
Indians (12-1-1) their first defeat since they lost to Los Angeles
Loyola, 24-16, on Oct. 7, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   More impressive, Mission Viejo was the first team to hold Hart
without a touchdown since Encino Crespi defeated the Indians, 14-3,
on Sept. 14, 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "Our defense came out swinging," said Diablo defensive lineman
Justin Williams, who registered his two sacks on consecutive plays.
"We knew we had to play the best football we had all year and we
pretty much did."</TE>
<TE>   Williams made the play of the day when he sacked Norton in the end
zone for a momentum-turning safety that pulled Mission Viejo to
within 3-2 early in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Marty Tadman returned the ensuing free kick to the Mission Viejo
45-yard line, then capped a 55-yard drive nine plays later by
throwing a perfectly placed 27-yard touchdown pass to Clark Hardman.</TE>
<TE>   "Marty set up the play with a pump fake and threw the perfect
ball," Hardman said. "The rest is history."</TE>
<TE>   Tadman connected with wide-open tight end Mark Dunn in the back of
the end zone on the two-point conversion to give the Diablos a 10-3
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Will Simons kicked his second field goal of the game, a 33-yarder,
to draw Hart to within 10-6 early in the fourth, but the Indians'
final two drives ended in disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive lineman Brady Beach sacked Norton for an eight-yard loss
on fourth and seven with 4 minutes 58 seconds left, and defensive
back Trevor Miller intercepted a Norton pass with 2:40 left.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo tailback Jamielle Gummer, who rushed for a game-high
73 yards in 19 carries, sealed the victory by gaining a first down
with 1:38 left.</TE>
<TE>   Other Diablo defensive heroes included linebacker Aaron Miller,
who had 12 tackles and two sacks, and lineman Ryan Quarles, who also
had two sacks.</TE>
<TE>   Norton completed 23 of 38 passes for 216 yards, but he often had
to rush his throws because of a furious pass rush. Norton finished
with 12 carries for minus-52 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "They manhandled our offensive line and we had some breakdowns,"
said Hart Coach Mike Herrington, whose team saw its streak of four
consecutive section titles and 19 consecutive playoff victories end.
"Their front seven just killed us."</TE>

Kings a 3-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins in front of a
sellout crowd of 18,184.</LD>
<LD>   "Ziggy [Palffy] made a great play of picking off a pass coming out
of their end and then showed tremendous patience hanging onto the
puck," said Schneider. "I was wide open when two guys went to him. I
knocked the puck down with my glove and then just shot it as hard as
I could."</LD>
<LD>   The Kings also needed 15 saves from goaltender Felix Potvin, a
power-play goal from Palffy and Craig Johnson's first goal of the
season to extend their winning streak to three games.</LD>
<TE>   With Lemieux making his first appearance in Southern California
since December 1996, the Kings knew they had a major challenge in
slowing down the high-powered Penguins.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to pay attention to the little things against
Mario," King defenseman Jaroslav Modry said. "Playing against a
legend like that always makes for a big game. He's a great hockey
player and a nice gentleman to play against."</TE>
<TE>   Anytime Lemieux is on the ice, all eyes are on him. Even when he's
not scoring goals, his presence makes it easier for his teammates to
get the puck into the net.</TE>
<TE>   That's been the case all season for Lemieux's linemate, Alexei
Kovalev, who scored the first goal of the game. It was his 17th of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   Although the teams were at even strength, the Penguins looked as
if they were on a power play midway into the first period because of
how much room they had to work with in the Kings' zone.</TE>
<TE>   With two defenders keeping a close eye on Lemieux, Kovalev found
himself alone behind the Kings' goal with defenseman Mattias Norstrom
watching him from the other side of the net. After a couple fakes,
Kovalev skated around the left post and, before Norstrom could reach
him, bounced the puck off Potvin and into the net at 9:24 of the
first period.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings were able to tie the score, 1-1, with a power-play goal
from Palffy at 11:22 of the second period.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that special teams were a big part of our success last
year," King Coach Andy Murray said recently. "We're working at it. We
need people who have been put in those positions to execute for us."</TE>
<TE>   And that's exactly what happened on the Kings' first goal.</TE>
<TE>   With Pittsburgh winger Ville Nieminen in the penalty box for
tripping, the Kings had the Penguins on the run with great passing
from their top line of Jason Allison, Adam Deadmarsh and Palffy, but
it was Lemieux who ended up scoring the goal for the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider got the play started when he kept the puck in the
Penguins' zone, and then after Palffy completed a give-and-go pass to
Allison, he made a centering pass for Deadmarsh that was knocked into
the net by Lemieux.</TE>
<TE>   With the capacity crowd back into the game, the Kings gave the
momentum back to the Penguins when winger Mikko Eloranta was called
for goaltender interference on Johan Hedberg at 12:10.</TE>
<TE>   That's a big mistake against the Penguins, who began Saturday's
game with the NHL's best power-play success rate at 30.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh needed only 26 seconds to take a 2-1 lead. Lemieux, who
leads the league in scoring, picked up his second assist of the game
when his shot from the top of the left circle was blocked by Potvin.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh forward Jan Hrdina pounced on the rebound and scored at
12:36.</TE>

<HD>A Rare Day They Can Enjoy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the Lakers' annual holiday party Saturday, players squared off
against a group of kids in such games as video basketball, Skeeball,
Foosball and Pop-a-Shot.</LD>
<LD>   For the most part, the kids held their own. But then, the Lakers
are having trouble beating anybody at anything these days.</LD>
<LD>   The party, put on by the Lakers and the Department of Children and
Family Services, was held at the HealthSouth Training Center, the
Lakers' practice facility in El Segundo.</LD>
<TE>   Before joining about 50 foster kids at the party, the Lakers went
through what Coach Phil Jackson called a normal practice session
Saturday that lasted a little more than an hour and a half.</TE>
<TE>   The only player to miss the party was Kobe Bryant, who was at
practice but did not participate in order to rest his sore elbow. A
team spokesperson said Bryant had a dentist's appointment immediately
after practice.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the Lakers seemed to enjoy the party. It provided a
nice respite from their recent struggles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers made only five of 19 shots (26%) in the fourth quarter
of Friday night's 98-82 loss to the New Orleans Hornets. No Laker
made more than one shot in the quarter -- Bryant was one for seven
and Shaquille O'Neal, missing easy layups, was one for four.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant was two for 10 in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it's fatigue or poor shot selection," Jackson
said of the shooting woes.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant had his sore elbow treated during practice Saturday, and
Jackson also chose to rest O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "We need him to have fresh legs," Jackson said. "He's the engine
that drives this team."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry, bothered by a pain in the back of his right hand all
season, also rested Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have lost 15 games, which is how many they lost during
the 1999-2000 season, when they won their first of three consecutive
NBA championships.</TE>
<TE>   It's not Jackson's nature to rant and rave at his players, and he
didn't Saturday. There were no closed-door meetings or anything like
that.</TE>
<TE>   "They're professionals," he said. "They know what they have to
do."</TE>
<TE>   He called the lopsided loss to the Hornets embarrassing, but
stopped short of calling it worse.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't devastating because we didn't invest that much in the
game," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said now is the time to start investing more.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something holding us back," he said. "It's time to start
playing with playoff intensity. We've got to stop the leak in the
dike. There's a lot of water running out.</TE>
<TE>   "As a coaching staff, we're beginning to ask, 'Did we squeeze
everything out of this team in winning three straight championships
to where they don't have anything left?' "</TE>

<TE>   Record vs. Magic -- 0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- Orlando is coming off a 111-85 victory over Golden State
on Friday night, but before that game the Magic had lost three in a
row. Tracy McGrady is leading the NBA in scoring with a 30.5-point
average. Grant Hill, who is nursing a sore left ankle but is expected
to play, is averaging 15.9 points. The Magic beat the Lakers,
112-102, on Nov. 27. In that game, McGrady had 38 points, nine
assists, six rebounds and two steals. The Lakers have defeated the
Magic in seven of the last eight games in Los Angeles. But then the
Lakers hadn't lost a home game to the Hornets in nearly five years
before Friday night.</TE>

<KH>ORLANDO AT LAKERS Tonight at Staples Center, 6:30, Fox Sports
Net</KH>
<HD>Wary Grant</HD>
<DH>Hill's latest comeback is still a work in progress, but his
iffy ankle is holding up so far</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is no Plan B. Grant cannot get injured again this year, there
cannot be another surgery. This is it. This is all the marbles.</LD>
<LD>   Orlando Coach Doc Rivers, before the season</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   The good news for the Magic: Grant Hill is (still) back.</TE>
<TE>   As comebacks go, his is still more harrowing than heartwarming. He
can't play in all the games yet, or any practices. Once he had to
take a week off and when he tried to come back, in a victory over the
Lakers, Rivers thought he was favoring his left ankle and held him
out of the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The doctors said it wasn't the old fracture site, merely
tendinitis. Of course, they were hopeful the last two seasons too,
and Hill was similarly reassuring, right up until the announcement he
had to pack it in.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Magic wasn't told this was how it would be, but on
Thanksgiving at Rivers' home, he says, "My son prayed for Grant
Hill's health. The sad thing was that he beat me to it."</TE>
<TE>   On the bright side, their prayers may be answered.</TE>
<TE>   Hill is playing better than he ever has for Orlando, increasing
his minutes as he goes, which is welcome news for a team that's
always waiting to see if it still has a season and he still has a
career. He has played more games this season than in his first two
with the Magic, combined.</TE>
<TE>   The calmest, most understanding and most patient of them is, of
course, Hill himself.</TE>
<TE>   Well, on the surface, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of expected it, especially with the history of the
situation, that the ankle would receive a lot of attention," Hill
says.</TE>
<TE>   "You know I also understood that there were going to be bumps and
bruises along the way. We had one the first week in the season [at
Milwaukee, where he came out after nine minutes] and everyone was all
panicked, like it was the end of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand it and I hope it just doesn't become a distraction
for the team."</TE>
<TE>   Worse distractions followed and others may too, which is the only
way it can be until he's all the way back.</TE>
<TE>   "We're playing against the Lakers," Rivers says, "and Grant's out.
Four and a half minutes left, we're drawing up a play in a timeout.
Tracy [McGrady] is trying to catch my eye. He's looking at Grant,
like, 'Is Grant coming back in?'</TE>
<TE>   "And I'm trying not to acknowledge him."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, it used to be distracting when Hill's season
ended in December or January too.</TE>
<TE>   "I really believe Grant is going to be OK," Rivers says. "I
believe this is something we've got to put ourselves through. It's a
distraction, but I'd rather have this distraction, with Grant, than
the one we had last year, without him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grant &amp; Tim  to Tracy &amp; No One</TE>
<TE>   The Magic's present and, it hopes, future configuration for a team
led by Hill and McGrady was Plan B, after Hill signed in 2000 but his
friend Tim Duncan, who was close to joining him, by all accounts,
went back to San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   McGrady had just turned 21, was only the No. 3 prospect of that
free-agent class, having just averaged a career-high 15.3 points in
Toronto, but he was from Central Florida and jumped at the chance to
go home.</TE>
<TE>   Now, McGrady is considered Kobe Bryant's rival for the mythical
title of best perimeter player. Hill, who was supposed to play Batman
to Tracy's Robin, never got the chance.</TE>
<TE>   This was no problem for Hill, who was always different, a
statesman in a super-athlete's body. Preternaturally gracious and
deferential, he had to learn how to be a star at Duke and Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   If they could only stay on the court together, Hill and McGrady
would be a dynamic tandem, resembling the great Michael
Jordan-Scottie Pippen partnership as much as any without Jordan can.</TE>
<TE>   Like Jordan and Pippen, McGrady and Hill are position-transcending
players, capable of running the offense, scoring, rebounding and
defending anyone from a point guard to a power forward. This season,
with Hill flying again, Miami's Pat Riley said they were even better
than his old Magic Johnson-James Worthy duo.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was Hill's ankle, broken during the 2000 playoffs when
he was a Piston, repaired in Cleveland by a medical team that put
three screws in. It still hurt the next fall, forcing him out four
games into his Magic debut.</TE>
<TE>   A second surgery followed, performed by Baltimore doctors ... as
was Hill's third surgery, less than a year later, when he lasted 14
games in his second Magic season.</TE>
<TE>   Without him, the Magic struggled mightily to be mediocre, and Hill
struggled with the thought of never getting back to them.</TE>
<TE>   "There were bone spurs that were preventing the fracture from
healing," he says. "They took out the spurs and drilled holes into
the fracture site. Then they took my blood and spun it to increase
platelets to promote healing."</TE>
<TE>   There's something to be said for being on the cutting edge of
medical science, but the way they were going, one more operation and
it looked as if they might have to shoot Hill into space to try the
procedure under weightless conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "It was difficult," Hill says. "You go through a lot of different
emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the hardest part, really, was trying to play the last
couple years. The ankle's not right, you know something's not right
and you almost feel like, 'Is this how it's going to be from here on
out?'</TE>
<TE>   "And, of course, being away from the team, being on crutches, the
whole thing, thinking, 'Is it over?' and all the different things
that go through your mind, both good and bad during this process.</TE>
<TE>   "Like I said, I'm a better person, a better teammate and,
hopefully, a better player. I will be when all is said and done but
I'm just glad to be playing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Back on Chain Gang</TE>
<TE>   Every day, the coaches, the management, the training staff,
everyone is, "How do you feel? How do you feel?" So I just look at it
as everyone really likes me and really cares about my well-being.</TE>
<TE>   -- Grant Hill</TE>
<TE>   Even for players with young legs that hurtle them 40 inches into
the air, the season is a grind, exacting a toll that starts at their
toes and works its way up.</TE>
<TE>   Today's courts are portable and built over air, which provides a
little cushioning, but NBA life is still about taping, icing,
anti-inflammatories and dreams of summer.</TE>
<TE>   Or as Bryant noted last season, at 23: "It's not the age, it's the
mileage."</TE>
<TE>   Thus, it isn't surprising that the Magic has this season scoped
out according to the dangers it poses for Hill, who was supposed to
be brought along slowly, playing perhaps 25 minutes a game and pulled
at the first sign of trouble, whether he got that hurt look or not.</TE>
<TE>   He wouldn't be practicing with the team in the beginning. He could
attend, of course, and listen and shoot and ride the bike, but no way
were they going to let him subject himself to more pounding between
games.</TE>
<TE>   Then there were the dreaded back-to-backs and the
four-games-in-five-nights double sets, the ultimate test, which Hill
has yet to pass.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, this season's Hill looks more like the old one, with
explosiveness he hadn't shown in Orlando and a hell-for-leather
approach that says that whatever happens, he's ready.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember when Doug Collins had him [in Detroit], he always
complained about the beating Grant takes," Rivers says. "And I didn't
really understand it, watching him last year. But watching him this
year -- he's playing like Grant Hill again. He drives. He scores
tough points. He's an Allen Iverson, as far as taking hits. I mean,
he's on the floor all game.</TE>
<TE>   "And with that foot, the way he plays, they don't go together. It
scares the hell out of you.... If he doesn't get right up, I mean,
you're thinking, 'Oh, here we go.' "</TE>
<TE>   In 30 minutes a game, Hill leads the team in rebounding, at 7.5,
is co-leader in assists with McGrady at 4.6 and is third in scoring,
15.9. Projected over the 40 minutes he once averaged and hopes to
again, that would be 21 points, 10 rebounds, six assists.</TE>
<TE>   Now, except for when he's hurt, you hear people saying that
everyone forgot how good he was, which they did.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Hill would blame them, if he were the blaming kind. He
almost forgot, himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day since I started playing pickup ball, I'm gaining more
confidence and I'm reminding myself, along with my teammates, what I
used to do and what I still can do," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "As good as I've been, I think I can be better. I'm better than
where I was the first day of training camp, I'm better than where I
was the first preseason game, I'm better than where I was the first
regular-season game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just kind of, like, sometimes I'll do something, like, 'Wow,
I haven't done that in three years!'</TE>
<TE>   "Last year I got so frustrated because I didn't have it right
away. I wasn't patient. That's one of the things I've learned -- it's
going to take some time. You've got a little rust, you've got to take
some time. It's not even just being away for two years but having the
injuries and the mental hurdles, the physical hurdles to get over.
But considering what I've been through, I feel pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Considering what his teammates have been through, they're all
feeling pretty good, although at 13-11, breaking in a new lineup with
the 6-8 Hill, 6-9 McGrady and 6-8 Mike Miller at guard and small
forward, they have work to do to regain their promise.</TE>
<TE>   For himself, Hill says he's ecstatic for every moment, from the
oh-no-not-again ones to the exultant running-jumping-dunking ones.
It's not a done deal or a happy ending yet but it has a chance.</TE>

<LD>The Sacramento Kings won a thrilling game that had an ugly finish.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Webber made four free throws in the last 8.5 seconds and the
Kings beat the Utah Jazz, 98-96, Saturday night at Salt Lake City
after a disputed foul call prompted angry Jazz fans to throw debris
at the officials as they left the court.</LD>
<LD>   "It was close. I think the refs decided the game," said
Sacramento's Bobby Jackson, who scored 21 points.</LD>
<TE>   The players were already off the court as the debris, which
included full plastic water bottles and mini basketballs, rained
down. Referee Tony Brothers was hit on the forearm by a water bottle
but said he was OK.</TE>
<TE>   Webber had 27 points and 13 rebounds, and made 13 of 17 free
throws. He was perfect when it counted most.</TE>
<TE>   Utah's John Stockton was fouled by Jackson with 2.4 seconds to go
and Sacramento leading, 96-95, after two free throws by Webber.
Stockton made the first free throw to tie the score but missed the
second, and John Amaechi was called for fouling Webber on the
rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz fans didn't think Amaechi, who got the rebound, touched
Webber and booed loudly as Webber went to the line.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Portland 98, Minnesota 92 -- Derek Anderson scored 24 points, and
Rasheed Wallace had 18 points and 11 rebounds to lift the Trail
Blazers in overtime at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers overcame one-for-20 shooting in the fourth
quarter and outscored the Timberwolves, 13-7, in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Garnett led the Timberwolves with 21 points, but was nine
for 27 from the field. Troy Hudson scored 14 points for Minnesota,
but only two after halftime.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 104, Memphis 87 -- Steve Nash scored 17 points in the first
quarter to help the Mavericks build a big lead at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks set a franchise record for consecutive home
victories with 12, including one from last season. Their 11-0 start
at home ties the club record to begin a season set in 1983-84.</TE>
<TE>   Nash finished with 26 points and seven assists. Shawn Bradley had
18 rebounds and eight blocks for Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami 101, Golden State 92 -- Eddie Jones scored a career-high 38
points at Miami and the Heat ended a five-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, whose previous career high was 37 points, scored 15 points
in the fourth quarter to help the Heat avert what would have been a
humiliating defeat. After leading by 21 points in the third quarter,
the Heat's lead was cut to one point.</TE>
<TE>   Antawn Jamison led the Warriors with 25 points, giving him 25
points or more for the sixth time in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 111, Denver 104 -- Carlos Boozer's three-point play with
10.6 seconds left bailed out the Cavaliers, who struggled to put away
the slumping Nuggets in the final minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Zydrunas Ilgauskas and rookie Dajuan Wagner scored 29 points
apiece for the Cavaliers, who won for only the fourth time at home
and fifth time this season.</TE>
<TE>   James Posey had 21 points for the Nuggets, who lost their fourth
in a row and have lost nine of 10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 113, New York 90 -- Paul Pierce had 29 points and 10
rebounds at New York, and the Celtics beat the Knicks for the seventh
consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Antoine Walker scored 23 points and Vin Baker had 16 for the
Celtics, who swept New York last season and are 3-0 against the
Knicks this season.</TE>
<TE>   Allan Houston scored 24 points for the Knicks, who shot 38% from
the field.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce unloaded on the Knicks to start the second half, scoring 12
consecutive points. The Knicks never got closer than 12 points the
rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 91, Seattle 78 -- Richard Hamilton scored 15 of his 25
points in the second half at Auburn Hills, Mich., and the Pistons
extended their winning streak to three games.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Barry and Predrag Drobnjak made three-point baskets to start
the second half, pulling the SuperSonics to within four points, and
they later cut the deficit to 60-59.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 102, Atlanta 88 -- Shawn Marion scored 24 points, and
Amare Stoudemire had eight in the decisive third quarter for the Suns
at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The Suns won their third in a row to end a five-game trip and
completed a season sweep of the Hawks. Atlanta lost its third in a
row.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix trailed by one point at the half but outscored the Hawks,
30-16, in the third quarter and held a double-digit lead throughout
the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 97, Milwaukee 95 -- Jalen Rose had 30 points, and Donyell
Marshall had 18 points and 18 rebounds to lead the Bulls at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Cassell tied the score, 95-95, on a baseline jumper with 32.3
left, but Rose responded with a fadeaway jumper with 8.1 seconds
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Williams stole Ray Allen's pass with 0.5 seconds left and was
fouled. He missed both free throws, but the Bucks could not get off a
final shot.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago has won three of its last four games, and the Bucks have
lost five of their last seven.</TE>

<HD>More Unrest for Weary Lakers</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hits and myths as the Lakers once more take on their ancient foe,
each other....</LD>
<LD>   Distress wafts in on little media feet at their practice site as a
minicam stampede awaits Shaquille O'Neal's further thoughts on his
teammates' inadequacy but settles for teammates' reaction when His
Immensity stalks off without comment.</LD>
<LD>   It's still true: Nobody does the holiday season the way the Lakers
do.</LD>
<TE>   Even for zany three-time champions who while away the season by
gnawing on each other, this is no ordinary December, shivering in the
basement, with 15 losses and the big guys taking turns
cold-shouldering the little guys.</TE>
<TE>   They've already lost as many as in Phil Jackson's entire first
season here. Even amid the skirmishes that followed, they still
didn't lose that many in his second and third seasons until Jan. 28
and Feb. 17, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   On the bright side(?), after Friday's lethargic loss to the
Hornets, Jackson says his players now know "how lousy they are."</TE>
<TE>   That's something, I guess, although it probably wouldn't make a
good advertising slogan.</TE>
<TE>   It's still early, but if the Lakers are to crawl back up the
cellar steps, big guy and little guy alike will have to understand
what the problems and solutions are, and are not.</TE>
<TE>   The big guys have to stop ripping the little guys.</TE>
<TE>   As my 9-year-old daughter says, I'm down with that.</TE>
<TE>   Look at it from a practical standpoint, Your Highnesses. Someone
has to inbound the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Teammates say Kobe Bryant remains a little distant but has calmed
down. O'Neal, on the other hand, visited the royal displeasure upon
them in waves last week, smoldering in silence with teammate, team
official and reporter alike.</TE>
<TE>   Not that that should have been a surprise. Let's see: Shaq vs.
Phil last season, vs. Kobe the season before, vs. Brian Hill, Del
Harris, Nick Van Exel, Fred Hickman, Penny Hardaway ...</TE>
<TE>   See if you can detect a pattern.</TE>
<TE>   It's still not easy being Shaq, whose greatness is manifest but
whose feelings are easily hurt. His inner child, which keeps getting
out, wants what he wants when he wants it. Typically, his adult side
then surfaces later in the season to collect all the MVP awards not
already spoken for.</TE>
<TE>   Two seasons ago, O'Neal wanted Bryant traded for Jason Kidd, which
Phoenix would have loved to do.</TE>
<TE>   Now Shaq is OK with Kobe but seems to want the other 10 guys
traded for Kidd, which I don't think New Jersey will go for.</TE>
<TE>   In this league, big guys take care of little guys ... or they're
not really big guys.</TE>
<TE>   The way it works, the big guys do what they do, enabling the
little guys to do what they do. In return, the big guys get most of
the money and all the credit (or blame.) Derek Fisher's problem isn't
trying or caring, so putting more pressure on him doesn't help.</TE>
<TE>   At this late date, it's silly to go on about whether O'Neal waited
too long to undergo surgery. If he made a mistake, it's over and done
with.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if Jackson, Jerry Buss and Mitch Kupchak miscalculated
what they could spend and how much help the team needed, that's over
and done with too.</TE>
<TE>   They have to go on from here and what they have is all they're
likely to have.</TE>
<TE>   They've got to make a trade.</TE>
<TE>   What a great idea! Let's do it the tabloid/talk show way: How
about Fisher and Samaki Walker for ... Latrell Sprewell!</TE>
<TE>   If anyone harbors any illusions about what can be done at this
late date, the reality is, not much.</TE>
<TE>   They're a two-superstar operation, with O'Neal and Bryant getting
$37 million of the $63-million payroll and $26 million spread over 12
players.</TE>
<TE>   Now, either A) the Lakers are getting away with underpaying some
prodigy or B) the other 12 players don't figure to have much trade
value.</TE>
<TE>   And the answer is: B!</TE>
<TE>   The only players with any value are tall ones at the end of their
contracts -- Robert Horry and Walker. Horry has his uses. If they
move Walker, they have to take back a player making the same $1.5
million, and there aren't many of those averaging 7.0 points and 7.6
rebounds in 26 minutes, as Walker is.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the speculation further trips out the little guys, who
are continually asked to speculate upon the extent of their futures
here.</TE>
<TE>   "We're mired in conversations about how poor we've played, whether
there should be changes, whether there should be trades," says Rick
Fox, the local king of all media who likes it here.</TE>
<TE>   "These are all conversations we had when I was in Boston and we
were terrible."</TE>
<TE>   It's more pertinent to ask what the Lakers can get off the waiver
wire. Try: Horace Grant, who's 37, coming off knee surgery and isn't
what he was when he left here two seasons ago, to say nothing of what
he was in the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   That's as good as it's likely to get. The cavalry isn't riding to
the rescue. They have to deal with it.</TE>
<TE>   Their supporting cast stinks.</TE>
<TE>   It's true, the little guys aren't having banner years ... and the
bosses were cavalier in the off-season about staying ahead of the
competition.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the little guys are what they are and they do
what they do.</TE>
<TE>   Horry has always been a twiggy power forward who causes mismatch
problems and specializes in big shots -- in spring. Fisher always
tries to step up, for better (the 2001 playoffs when his three-point
shooting finished off San Antonio) or worse (now). Fox is a
hard-nosed role player, if deferential on offense. Walker doesn't get
confused with Karl Malone but is a bargain at $1.5 million. Brian
Shaw is a prototype Jackson player. Devean George may not be a
bargain at $4.5 million, but he's useful. So is Mark Madsen's gung-ho
spirit. Like Glen Rice, Tracy Murray can shoot, but he isn't a
Jackson prototype. Kareem Rush isn't ready but didn't figure to be.</TE>
<TE>   Horry, Fisher, Fox, George and Shaw have been here for three title
runs, or as Jackson was obliged to note in their defense last week,
"They're not chopped liver."</TE>
<TE>   If things are different, it has as much to do with the big guys.
Since O'Neal's return, their defensive average has gone from 95 to
99, and that's something they did together.</TE>
<TE>   Phil better wake up and start coaching.</TE>
<TE>   Tex Winter even tells Jackson that on the bench when Phil watches
the other team score 10 points in a row without getting up, much less
calling a timeout.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, it ignores what Jackson does best, which is keeping
everyone calm, no matter how bad things look, by staying calm,
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Brown makes players crazy with constant teaching, even if
he's right. Pat Riley rubs his players' noses in misery, making it so
unbearable, they give their all to surmount it, so by season's end,
one way or another, they're wasted.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, the easiest-riding great pro coach, measures problems
against time, in the sure knowledge that the season is a trackless
wasteland, in which you can stage a comeback against Dallas that will
never be forgotten -- at least, for four days until you lose to
Golden State.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson tried gently reining in Bryant, when it looked as though
any Laker who said he was hurt would have to bring Kobe a note from
his doctor. Phil and Kobe went at it two seasons ago and it was too
early for one of those.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson needs O'Neal to stop staring daggers at everyone, but Phil
and Shaq went at it last spring and it's too early for one of those
too.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the Lakers are in a deeper hole than the far-sighted
Jackson expected. The problem, though, isn't that he isn't on the
case, but that it's such a hard case.</TE>
<TE>   It's all about us.</TE>
<TE>   If it once seemed like the Lakers' world, that's over.</TE>
<TE>   One reason the big guys are upset goes unexpressed, since a Laker
never worries about lowly Dallas or Sacramento. Nevertheless, it's
unnerving to see them so far above them, pulling away.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be a long process to get ourselves back on
track," Fox said. "I think we wanted it quickly. We wanted it with
the return of Shaquille. We wanted it to happen overnight and it
hasn't."</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't even started yet. If they settle down and go to work,
they'll get their chance to rise to the challenge, as they did last
spring. If not ...</TE>
<TE>   Well, we'll always have the Angels. Won't we?</TE>
<TE>   At present, the Mavericks and Kings are better than they were,
hungrier than the Lakers and more together. If crunch time is a ways
off, the Laker superstars should thank their lucky stars.</TE>

<TE>   GAME OF THE WEEK</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS AT NEW JERSEY</TE>
<TE>   When -- Thursday. Time -- 4:30 p.m. TV -- Ch. 9, TNT</TE>
<TE>   Here's a cliche you won't be hearing as much of: "finals preview."
The struggling Lakers will be on the second of a four-game trip,
which they'll start with a 2-10 road record, having beaten only the
Clippers and Grizzlies. The Nets, who ran away with the East last
season, look as if they're in for a fight this time.</TE>

<TE>   ** Seattle (4-9) at Atlanta (8-4-1), 10 a.m.: So far Tampa Bay is
the only team to really stop Michael Vick, holding him to 16 yards
rushing last week. Seahawks have league's worst run defense. Hmmm ...
wonder what's going to give? LINE: Atlanta by 9  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** New York Jets (7-6) at Chicago (3-10), 10 a.m., KNX (1070):
Said Jet linebacker Marvin Lewis: "No one in this league stinks."
Except for maybe Cincinnati and Chicago and Minnesota and Detroit and
Carolina and Washington and.... LINE: New York by 6  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   **** Oakland (9-4) at Miami (8-5), 10 a.m., Channel 2, KMPC
(1540): Dolphins apparently won't be motivated to help save Dan
Marino's single-season passing record. Said defensive end Jason
Taylor: "If [Raider quarterback Rich] Gannon throws for 310 yards and
we win the ballgame -- sorry Dan." LINE: Miami by 1  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Tampa Bay (10-3) at Detroit (3-10), 10 a.m.: Lions were 0-3 and
New Orleans was 3-0 when they played earlier. Lions won, 37-31. Said
Warren Sapp: "Nothing is a mismatch because it's mano-a-mano, snot on
snot." Yes, "snot." LINE: Tampa Bay by 8  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Baltimore (6-7) at Houston (4-9), 10 a.m.: Texan quarterback
David Carr continues on record pace with 68 sacks, four short of
Randall Cunningham's NFL mark (72). LINE: Baltimore by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ** San Diego (8-5) at Buffalo (6-7), 10 a.m.: If the cold weather
doesn't turn out to be the great equalizer, consider this, just in
case the Bill offense doesn't seem to have that crispness: Buffalo is
0-6 when Drew Bledsoe throws an interception. LINE: Buffalo by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ** Carolina (5-8) at Pittsburgh (7-5-1), 10 a.m.: After loss to
Houston, will Steelers step up or wilt? Remember the Jerome Bettis
coin-toss fiasco in 1998? Pittsburgh was 7-4, lost that game in OT to
Detroit, and lost last five in a row. LINE: Pittsburgh by 8  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Minnesota (3-10) at New Orleans (9-4), 10 a.m.: Saint running
back Deuce McAllister hopes ankle injury doesn't keep him out:
"Nobody wants to miss a game now. This is a fun time." We think he
was talking about the playoff push, not the fact that Vikings are on
the agenda this week. LINE: New Orleans by 7.</TE>
<TE>   ** Washington (5-8) at Philadelphia (10-3), 10 a.m., Channel 11:
Redskin guard Tre' Johnson wants it both ways when supporting the

to know fear yet." LINE: Philadelphia by 7  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   * Jacksonville (5-8) at Cincinnati (1-12), 10 a.m.: Said Fred

<TE>   *** Indianapolis (8-5) at Cleveland (7-6), 10 a.m.: Hopefully, Tim

That was his downfall in a three-interception, 30-7 loss to Brett
Favre and the Packers last season. LINE: Indianapolis by 2.</TE>
<TE>   *** Kansas City (7-6) at Denver (7-6), 1 p.m.: Denver has lost

<DH>Raiders' Gannon is dismantling defenses as he passes his
way toward Dan Marino's season yardage record</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Hard to imagine, but Raider quarterback Rich Gannon once flirted with
the idea of giving up pro football to become a lawyer. Fifteen years
later, as he inches toward NFL history, Gannon faces 12 angry men
every Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   That would be the opposing defense, plus a defensive coordinator
ready to hammer-throw his headset into the upper deck.</LD>
<LD>   "Rich drives you crazy," said Jim Mora, San Francisco's defensive
coordinator. "He presents tremendous problems. He's very smart, and
he's a great decision maker. And he's got all those throws --
sidearm, over the top, underhand -- so he's got a lot of ways to burn
you."</LD>
<TE>   Gannon is within striking range of Dan Marino's single-season
record of 5,084 yards passing that has stood since 1984. Marino is
the only player in league history who has thrown for 5,000 yards in a
season.</TE>
<TE>   Gannon, 36, who starts today's game against the Dolphins with
4,205 yards, is on pace to finish with 5,175.</TE>
<TE>   "He's like a doctor performing surgery on some of these
secondaries," said Marino, now an analyst for CBS and HBO. "The thing
about him is, he's playing so smart too. He's not making mistakes, he
knows when to throw the ball away and they're really using the
passing game in some respects as the running game."</TE>
<TE>   By that, Marino means the Raiders thrive on a steady diet of short
passes to pick apart defenses, instead of the deep ball that so long
was a hallmark of the franchise. The vertical stretch has gone
horizontal.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Marino threw 564 passes during his record year, Gannon is
on pace for more than 100 more, 672, and could even threaten the
league record set by Drew Bledsoe, who threw 691 with New England in
1994.</TE>
<TE>   Marino threw 12 touchdown passes of 30 yards or longer that
season; Gannon has thrown only four that long, and through 13 games
has 23 touchdown passes, fewer than half of Marino's record of 48.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time Marino's record has been threatened. St.
Louis quarterback Kurt Warner was on pace for a staggering 6,026
yards through the first six games of the 2000 season before breaking
a finger. And Warner threw for 4,830 yards in 2001, the closest
anyone has come to Marino's record. San Diego's Dan Fouts threw for
4,802 in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   "You never want your records being broke," Marino said. "I would
be lying if I told you I wanted [Gannon] to do it. But if he does it,
he deserves it. He's a class guy. You know what I like about it? He's
doing it and they're winning and they have a good team."</TE>
<TE>   Gannon, touted by many people as the NFL's most valuable player,
has had help. He's flanked by future hall-of-fame receivers Jerry
Rice and Tim Brown, a budding playmaker in Jerry Porter, a versatile
running back in Charlie Garner, a sure-handed rookie tight end in
Doug Jolley.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Callahan has replaced Jon Gruden as coach, and the Raiders
have tweaked their offense. Gruden's approach was more run-oriented,
and his teams consistently were among the league leaders in rushing
yardage. Callahan's Raiders have the fourth-fewest rushes, 305, and
are more willing to lean on Gannon's passing.</TE>
<TE>   In a victory at Pittsburgh, 70 of the Raiders' 87 plays were
passes and Gannon threw 25 consecutive times during one stretch. He
set an NFL record for completions in a non-overtime game with 43, and
a team record with 64 attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the season, in a victory at Denver, Gannon set an NFL
single-game record with 21 consecutive completions.</TE>
<TE>   He set another record last Sunday with his 10th 300-yard game of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the NFL record book is starting to look like his
diary, Gannon insists that isn't his goal.</TE>
<TE>   "The only record I'm focused on is our wins and losses," he said.
"I don't want to sound arrogant, but that really is our focus and
will continue to be my focus."</TE>
<TE>   Gannon's pro career almost ended before it started, back when he
was a Delaware quarterback. NFL scouts acted as if they were
considering him as a quarterback but really saw him as a safety.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, Rich," they would tell him at the end of the workout, "now
let's see you backpedal."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, when New England chose him in the fourth round of the
1987 draft, then told him he would be a defensive back, he politely
told the Patriots to take a hike.</TE>
<TE>   "He was going to go to law school instead of playing football,"
recalled his father, James Gannon, a lawyer. "I remember having lunch
with him and he said, 'I'm not going to play for them, Dad.' He's
firm-minded, you might say."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots caught his drift, trading him to Minnesota. Gannon
went from the Vikings to the Redskins to the Chiefs, and finally the
Raiders, and with Oakland, he has reached the Pro Bowl the last three
seasons. As for his place in NFL history? Case closed.</TE>

<HD>Fisher's Goal Extends Streak for Senators</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Fisher and the Ottawa Senators are still finding new ways to win
at home.</LD>
<LD>   Fisher deflected Martin Havlat's shot past Martin Brodeur at 3:10
of overtime to give the Senators a 4-3 victory over the New Jersey
Devils on Saturday night. The victory extended Ottawa's home winning
streak to a club-record eight games.</LD>
<LD>   But after leading, 2-0, the Senators had to rally to force
overtime, and kill off a two-minute power play before Fisher scored.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a fun game to be part of," Fisher said. "We started really
well and then we kind of let down."</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa has lost only once in 16 games (12-1-3).</TE>
<TE>   "That's character right there," Ottawa goalie Patrick Lalime said.
"Leading 2-0, then going down 3-2 ... it shows a lot about this
team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 6, Edmonton 3 -- Markus Naslund scored four goals at
Edmonton, Canada, giving him a league-leading 20.</TE>
<TE>   The Vancouver captain scored his fourth goal on a one-timer at
12:36 of the second period after taking a pass from defenseman Brent
Sopel and blasting the puck past Tommy Salo.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 2, Washington 0 -- Evgeni Nabokov stopped 34 shots for
his first shutout this season, and Coach Ron Wilson's new team beat
his old one at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, fired by the Capitals in May after five mostly successful
seasons, watched as Nabokov and the revived Sharks won for the third
time in four games since Wilson replaced Darryl Sutter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 2, Buffalo 0 -- Robert Esche recorded his first
shutout for the Flyers to make goals by Donald Brashear and Eric
Desjardins stand up at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Esche, obtained from Phoenix in the summer, was rarely tested in
stopping 15 shots, the lowest shot total this season by Buffalo. The
Flyers pelted Martin Biron with 34 shots.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 4, New York Rangers 1 -- Mats Sundin had a goal and an
assist at Toronto, where the Maple Leafs handed the Rangers their
season-high fifth consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers elected to give 19-year-old goalie Dan Blackburn his
18th consecutive start instead of using Mike Dunham, who was acquired
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The Maple Leafs have won eight in a row at home and nine of 12
overall. Ed Belfour turned aside 36 shots.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 4, Boston 2 -- Richard Zednik, Chad Kilger, Craig Rivet
and Yanic Perreault scored to lift the Canadiens at home and extend
Boston's season-high losing streak to three games.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Theodore made 25 saves for Montreal in his first start since
giving up seven goals at Colorado on Dec. 6.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 4, New York Islanders 3 -- Vincent Lecavalier had two
goals and an assist to help host Tampa Bay end a five-game losing
streak against the Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Parrish, Shawn Bates and Kenny Jonsson scored for New York.
Bates has four short-handed goals this season, including one in each
of the last two games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 6, Columbus 4 -- Sergei Fedorov had two goals and an
assist to lead the Red Wings at Detroit, one day after his 33rd
birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Fedorov's short-handed goal with 3:18 left in the second period
gave Detroit a 5-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   He beat Marc Denis from the slot, high on the glove side, after
taking a pass from Brendan Shanahan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 4, Atlanta 0 -- Brent Johnson earned his first shutout
this season, and Tyson Nash scored his first goal to spark the Blues.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson made his first start at home this season and helped
stretch Atlanta's losing streak to six games. Johnson stopped 32
shots in earning the 10th shutout of his career and the first since
beating San Jose on March 13.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 3, Minnesota 1 -- Scott Walker scored two goals at
Nashville, one on the power play.</TE>
<TE>   The Wild cut the deficit to 2-1 at 1:30 of the third period on
Andrew Brunette's 12th goal this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 3, Calgary 1 -- Dean McAmmond and Derek Morris scored to
lead the depleted Avalanche at Calgary, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche were without injured forwards Joe Sakic and Peter
Forsberg, but used McAmmond and Morris -- former Flames -- to supply
the offense.</TE>

<TE>   Fourth string? "Son, Coach wants to see you. And bring your
playbook."</TE>
<TE>   But fourth in the annual Heisman Trophy voting?</TE>
<TE>   Well done. You're on your way to a prosperous NFL career.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, this is what the Heisman Trophy has become:</TE>
<TE>   First place usually goes to the best publicized quarterback from a
Florida school or the best publicized running back from a Midwestern
school.</TE>
<TE>   Second place usually goes to a scrambling quarterback who will
probably be playing another position, or finding another line of
work, within three years.</TE>
<TE>   Third place usually goes to another quarterback, whose college
career peaked too soon or too late for the Heisman voters to notice.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth place usually goes to the player with big upside and
big-league potential, held back mainly by geography and/or position
and/or an undermanned publicity department.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the previous 10 Heisman elections (and NFL general
managers please note: Miami's Willis McGahee finished fourth in the
2002 balloting):</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   2001</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Eric Crouch.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth place: Joey Harrington.</TE>
<TE>   Crouch was drafted by the defending NFC champion St. Louis Rams.
Harrington was drafted by the Detroit Lions. Guess who took a quick
look around, gulped and immediately retired.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, Harrington has taken a pounding in his first season
with the Lions, looking very much the embattled rookie at times. He
has the lowest completion percentage (50.2) and quarterback rating
(60.0) among NFL qualifiers, but he's still feeling his way, learning
every week. He managed to oversee three Detroit victories and send
three other games into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   2000</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Chris Weinke.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth place: LaDainian Tomlinson.</TE>
<TE>   While Weinke was losing the Carolina quarterback job to
36-year-old Rodney Peete, Tomlinson established himself as the
greatest single-season rusher in San Diego Charger history. After 13
games, he ranks third in the NFL, behind Ricky Williams and Priest
Holmes, with 1,375 yards rushing, averaging 4.5 yards a carry. He's
also San Diego's leading pass catcher, with 64 receptions for 432
yards, and the primary reason the Chargers remain in playoff
contention at 8-5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1999</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Ron Dayne.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth place: Drew Brees.</TE>
<TE>   Dayne has had a good seat watching Giant teammate Tiki Barber rush
for 1,000-plus yards in two of the last three seasons. Brees is the
quarterback the Chargers drafted after trading away the pick that
became Michael Vick. Brees was taken in the second round after the
Chargers had already selected their franchise running back,
Tomlinson, in the first.</TE>
<TE>   Would the Chargers have been better off with Vick, but without
Tomlinson? Doubtful. In his first season as San Diego's full-time
starter, Brees has been efficient, if not spectacular. But after Ryan
Leaf, all the Chargers were hoping for was A) upright, B)
semifunctional and C) noncontroversial. Vick, who'd have been the
ultimate round peg in Marty Schottenheimer's resolutely square
offensive system, could not have guaranteed that last bit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1998</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Ricky Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth place: Tim Couch.</TE>
<TE>   For once, the Heisman voters projected it right -- although it
took Williams a trade to Miami and a breakthrough fourth season to
finally convince the doubters. Couch bears the scars of growing up in
the NFL on an expansion team -- no offensive line in the early going,
costing him more than half the 2000 season, and no running game for
his first 3 1/2seasons, stranding him in an easy-to-defend-against
game plan.</TE>
<TE>   In Season 4, he has the Browns on the fringes of the playoff race,
with rookie running back William Green's late-season development
finally lightening his load.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1997</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Charles Woodson.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth place: Randy Moss.</TE>
<TE>   Woodson has played in three Pro Bowls and maybe a Super Bowl is
next, if the Raiders can secure home-field advantage through January.
Moss is Moss -- the most formidable game-breaker in the league during
those moments when he's interested, a franchise-breaker when he's
not. So what is it with the 2001 and '02 Vikings? Have they not won
enough to maintain Moss' attention? Or has Moss been too uninterested
for the Vikings to win enough?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1996</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Danny Wuerffel.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth place: Orlando Pace.</TE>
<TE>   Wuerffel is the No. 3 starter in Steve "Captain Hook" Spurrier's
three-man Redskin pitching rotation. Pace, being an offensive
lineman, never had a prayer in the Heisman voting. But he has played
in two Pro Bowls, and you saw what happened to the Rams' offense once
injuries knocked him out of the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1995</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Eddie George.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth place: Darnell Autry.</TE>
<TE>   A career year for the Heisman voters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1994</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Rashaan Salaam.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth place: Kerry Collins.</TE>
<TE>   Salaam rushed for 1,074 yards in his rookie season, 610 in three
seasons after that. Collins, after troubled stints in Carolina and
New Orleans, pulled his act together in New York. The Giants won a
conference championship in 2000 and Collins surpassed the 20,000-yard
passing mark this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1993</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Charlie Ward.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth place: Marshall Faulk.</TE>
<TE>   Ward was Heisman's great gift to the NBA, for whatever that has
been worth. Faulk, the greatest NFL all-purpose back of his era, was
hopelessly handicapped in the major-college-heavy, East Coast-biased
'93 Heisman balloting. He played for San Diego State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1992</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Gino Torretta.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth place: Marvin Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Torretta's syndrome -- a condition commonly associated with
Heisman Trophy winners who soon lose their way upon entry into the
NFL. Jones has been a solid performer at inside linebacker in his
decade with the New York Jets.</TE>

<LD>Get that little dude into a dressing room, and quick.</LD>
<LD>   Pull him out of that bulky jersey, pads and thick pants. Put him
in something light, something sleek; those bronze bones aren't used
to warm Coliseum nights.</LD>
<LD>   And the high-top boots? Please! This is the Pac-10, remember? You
have any track cleats?</LD>
<TE>   And could someone pull him out of that awful crouch? Make him
stand up tall, make his eyes dance, put his hands on his hips and
cock the helmet back on his head.</TE>
<TE>   It's been 21 years since the Heisman Trophy came to the West
Coast, and he needs to look the part.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and one more thing.</TE>
<TE>   Can you wipe that grimace off his face and give him a smile?</TE>
<TE>   A dazed, loopy, I
can't-believe-some-rich-New-Yorker-just-handed-me-college-football's-
greatest-trophy smile?</TE>
<TE>   It's the kind of smile worn by the USC quarterback who is bringing
him here.</TE>
<TE>   His name is Carson Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   And, yeah, well, I'll be a son of a bias.</TE>
<TE>   I don't believe it either.</TE>
<TE>   It was more impossible than somersaulting over Ricky Manning Jr.</TE>
<TE>   It was more unusual than throwing for 425 yards against the sons
of Rockne.</TE>
<TE>   It was a upset bigger than Beano Cook's belly, against competition
stiffer than Lee Corso's hair.</TE>
<TE>   Carson Palmer won the 2002 Heisman Trophy on Saturday night, and
nothing more outrageous has been written on these sports pages in, I
don't know, at least a month.</TE>
<TE>   Since all that stuff about the Angels winning the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Carson Palmer won the Heisman, and next thing you know, they're
going to move Tuscaloosa to Tustin and trade Ann Arbor for Alhambra.</TE>
<TE>   He won it even though nobody in the Eastern time zone was supposed
to stay up late enough to watch his games.</TE>
<TE>   He won it even though nobody in the Midwest was supposed think he
was tough enough.</TE>
<TE>   He won the most regionally biased award in all of sports despite
being from a region that is represented by only one-sixth of the 921
voters.</TE>
<TE>   That's how hard it was.</TE>
<TE>   That's how good he was.</TE>
<TE>   That's how much USC should celebrate a coach like Pete Carroll who
made him comfortable, a coordinator like Norm Chow who made him
versatile, a publicity guru like Tim Tessalone who made him
accessible.</TE>
<TE>   And a big kid whose quiet spirit made it possible.</TE>
<TE>   Think about it, all you high school swaggerers and Pop Warner
preeners.</TE>
<TE>   Carson Palmer drowned out thumping tubs from Iowa City to Miami
without ever raising his voice.</TE>
<TE>   He overshadowed Heisman highlight flicks from State College to
Boulder with nothing more dramatic than two fingers pointed to the
sky.</TE>
<TE>   He won it with performance. He won it with winning.</TE>
<TE>   Think about this.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer may be the only Heisman winner in recent times who, upon
scoring a touchdown, never playfully posed like the trophy.</TE>
<TE>   Here's guessing old John Heisman wouldn't have minded.</TE>
<TE>   When I saw Palmer take the stage at the Yale Club on Saturday and
say, "My heart's about to come out of my chest," I thought about the
last time I saw him look so confused.</TE>
<TE>   It was the middle of November, and I approached him outside
Heritage Hall to explain that I was going to begin banging the drum
for his Heisman campaign.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, he was an afterthought on every list, his shaky early
career haunting him, his geography hiding him.</TE>
<TE>   He had become clearly the hottest player in the country, with 13
touchdown passes in his last three games, but who knew, and who would
know?</TE>
<TE>   Sure, USC had had four Heisman winners. But that was before the
1980s emergence of college football giant ESPN, whose announcers now
essentially coronate the Heisman winner, who usually comes from a
team that plays on their channel.</TE>
<TE>   The Pac-10 has a TV contract with Fox Sports Net, which meant
Palmer was not being promoted or even shown in many Eastern time zone
homes and hotels that do not receive the network.</TE>
<TE>   "The Heisman?" he said to me that day, laughing. "Are you kidding
me?"</TE>
<TE>   Voters loved Ken Dorsey, the Miami quarterback who has lost one
game in his entire career. Voters were falling hard for Brad Banks,
the Iowa quarterback who led his team on a swath through the Big Ten.</TE>
<TE>   Voters were thinking about Miami's Willis McGahee, and Colorado's
Chris Brown, and Marshall's Byron Leftwich.</TE>
<TE>   Heck, Palmer wasn't even the most respected quarterback in his own
conference, that distinction belonging to Washington State's Jason
Gesser.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, I'd love to think about the Heisman," Palmer said that day.
"But I know how it works."</TE>
<TE>   So that's what I wrote, that it would take either the elimination
of all time zones or a couple of incredible final games for Palmer to
get what he deserves.</TE>
<TE>   At about 8 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on Nov. 30, he completed
those games.</TE>
<TE>   First, there were the four touchdowns and no interceptions in a
pasting of UCLA that featured Palmer's Heisman Moment. It was a
somersault over Manning that looked like John Elway and inspired his
team to 52 points.</TE>
<TE>   "That's something that will be shown on TV for the rest of the
year," said Carroll after that game. "That has to help."</TE>
<TE>   Then, a week later, there were all those yards with four touchdown
passes against Notre Dame in what was his Heisman Closing Argument.</TE>
<TE>   Remember how Palmer led the trailing Trojans on a quick touchdown
drive at the end of the first half against the nation's fifth-ranked
defense?</TE>
<TE>   The Notre Dame players were so demoralized, they let the Trojans
race past them through the tunnel into the locker room at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, the game was done. So, too, it turned out, was the
Heisman race.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer didn't just win what was supposed to be the closest
five-man battle in history, he won it relatively huge, with nearly 50
more first-place votes than the next guy.</TE>
<TE>   Banks, the runner-up, didn't have the numbers or the schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Johnson, Penn State's third-place finisher despite rushing
for more than 2,000 yards, struggled against his three toughest
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   McGahee, despite six touchdowns in the season finale, finished
fourth probably because he was only a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   And Dorsey, the favorite entering the season, watched his mediocre
personal statistics overcome his incredible team statistics.</TE>
<TE>   "When I heard how all the voting broke down, I was taken aback,"
Palmer said during a phone interview late Saturday. "I had no idea it
would be like that."</TE>
<TE>   He had no idea about any of this. He did not try to win anything.</TE>
<TE>   "I just played," he said. "All season, I just went out there with
nothing on my mind but helping the team. I just played."</TE>
<TE>   So big-time college sports can still work that way, huh?</TE>
<TE>   That smile on the little bronze dude, make it a big one.</TE>

<LD>I was under orders the other day to buy a cake knife for the wedding,
although we have a kitchen drawer full of some really nice knives. I
was also told to have the names of the bride and groom engraved on
it.</LD>
<LD>   It cost almost $100, which isn't surprising when you consider they
charged by the letter to do the engraving, and there are 18 letters
in "Grocery Store Bagger."</LD>
<LD>   It was hard to tell if the wife was only kidding when she reached
for the kitchen drawer full of knives after I had shown her the
"Grocery Store Bagger's" engraved name instead of the kid's real
name, and I told her I would have had them engrave his real name if
only I could have remembered it.</LD>
<TE>   The wife, meanwhile, bought a crystal Cinderella and Prince
Charming cake topper for $145, and while I'd have preferred Snow
White and Dopey, right now I wish the daughter would've made a play
for Carson Palmer a few years back and made me a proud USC
father-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   The wife also bought a pair of $45 engraved crystal flutes, and I
can't wait to see the look on Dopey's face when he thinks that's what
he's got to drink his beer out of all night. Throw in a $60 pillow
for the rings to rest on, and now would be a great time for anyone to
speak up with a reason, any reason will do, why these two shouldn't
be married.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I BELIEVE Bob Baffert is the key to paying for this wedding if it
must go on.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the deal: There's this big-shot horse owner from the East,
Daniel Borislow, who reportedly plays $30,000 a hand in pai gow poker
and by his own admission bet "northward of $100,000 on the Kentucky
Derby," coming to Hollywood Park next Saturday intent on running his
horse, Toccet, and betting a bundle on him.</TE>
<TE>   This guy retired as a millionaire, and bets so much money on
horses they close down the third floor at Philadelphia Park only for
his use. "I bet I'm the biggest horse bettor in the game," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week he took out an ad in the Daily Racing Form and offered
to put up $200,000 with the chance to win only $100,000 if his horse
beat Vindication in the Hollywood Futurity. "Knowing the owner of
Vindication he'd probably want to go $2 million for $1 million,"
Borislow said. "I'm good for that too."</TE>
<TE>   Vindication, trained by Baffert, is on vacation after winning all
four of his races, including the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, in which
Borislow's horse finished ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert also trains Kafwain, who finished second to Vindication in
the Breeders' Cup, and the West Coast bettors will make him the
favorite in the Futurity.</TE>
<TE>   "You know Borislow is going to want his horse to be the favorite,"
Baffert said, which means Borislow will have to pay a king's ransom
to impact the Hollywood Park tote board -- which puts more money in
the pool for me to win when Toccet loses and Baffert does his thing.</TE>
<TE>   "So we're talking wedding by the ocean in San Diego or the In &amp;
Out Burger truck pulling up to the house for the reception," Baffert
said. "I don't know, Toccet is a good horse and he'll have a nice
little jockey riding him."</TE>
<TE>   I'd feel better if it were a nice big jockey riding him or, at the
very least, if Baffert knew enough about racing to realize there are
only little jockeys.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW I haven't had much luck with Baffert in the past. I asked
trainer Bobby Frankel once for a winner, he gave me one and it won.
The problem with Frankel is, he swears a lot, is very grumpy and
spends most of his time on the East Coast, which explains why he
swears a lot, and is very grumpy.</TE>
<TE>   We're stuck with Baffert as our resident whiz, who acts as if he
knows less about horse racing than Phil Jackson knows about coaching
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know how much an engraved cake knife costs?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't worry," he said, his horse will not only beat Toccet, but
another potential contender in Ghostzapper, trained by Frankel.</TE>
<TE>   That was encouraging until Baffert excused himself to saddle
Composure in the Hollywood Starlet on Saturday. Composure went off as
the 1-5 favorite and finished second to some 30-1 pig; if this was a
dress rehearsal to take care of the wedding bill, the daughter's
going to be wearing the best dress Purple Heart has to offer.</TE>
<TE>   "Why don't you buy a $5,000 horse, enter him in a stakes race,
which gets you use of the Director's Room for 50 people, have the
wedding, scratch the horse and you'll really make out," said Baffert,
and I'm beginning to think he just might be a better wedding planner
than trainer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BOB &amp; JILL Baffert were married earlier this year, and knowing the
expense involved, he's pledged to do his best to set up Borislow for
the wedding kill.</TE>
<TE>   I'd feel a lot better about this if I hadn't made a practice wager
Saturday on Baffert's Oneexcessivenite, who finished eighth in a
nine-horse field in the seventh. It gave me an idea though.</TE>
<TE>   Come race day, if everyone thinks it's going to be a match race
between Toccet and Kafwain, I can take all the deposit money that's
been saved for a wedding dress, reception hall and Cinderella junk,
and put it on Frankel's horse.</TE>
<TE>   It's a gamble. I lose, and I'll have to take back the crystal
flutes, but I've got a feeling the Bagger would prefer his own dirty
beer mug anyway. I know this, if I lose, I'm definitely taking back
the knife before the wife makes a point of telling me what she
thinks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Franklin M.:</TE>
<TE>   "What do you have to say about Carson Palmer now?"</TE>
<TE>   No thanks are necessary for pushing him to such heights.</TE>

<HD>Bruins Enjoy Visit by Holton</HD>
<DH>They give their former assistant coach a warm welcome, then
rout his Portland team, 105-67.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Strange feeling, returning to the building where you played and
coached.</LD>
<LD>   Stranger still, absent-mind- edly walking to the wrong bench
before the game begins.</LD>
<LD>   Strangest of all, Michael Holton watched UCLA players he recruited
and helped develop absolutely pummel his Portland Pilots, 105-67,
Saturday night before 6,608 at Pauley Pavilion.</LD>
<TE>   "Because of the relationship I have with some of those guys, they
wanted me to see them do well," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Holton played at UCLA in the early 1980s and was an assistant from
1996-2001 before becoming Portland's coach last season. He is
especially close to senior guard Ray Young and junior forward T.J.
Cummings.</TE>
<TE>   But there was nothing close about the game. UCLA (2-2) led by 11
points after five minutes, 21 points after 11 minutes and 29 points
by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Young, whose confidence is growing with each game after
redshirting last season, scored 14 points in 18 minutes. Cummings had
13 points and nine rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "If the game got too close, I knew I would be receiving a call
[from Holton] saying, 'We could have got you,' " Young said. "So I
didn't want to leave it to chance.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Holton always had my back when he was [at UCLA]. He's who I
cried to when I was struggling. He was there for me, right or wrong,
like a father. I wanted him to see that we are improving."</TE>
<TE>   Holton's current team appears to need his undivided attention. The
Pilots (3-3) beat San Diego State during a three-game winning streak
but have lost three in a row to Pacific 10 Conference teams.</TE>
<TE>   "UCLA played great, they did everything they set out to do," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Dijon Thompson came off the bench to score 23 points, but
nearly every Bruin shined. Thirteen players scored, 14 had at least
one rebound and the Bruins got 54 points and 31 rebounds from
reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore forward Andre Patterson hadn't practiced since gaining
eligibility Friday, yet he logged seven minutes, blocked two shots
and threw down a dunk.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't planning on playing him more than a couple minutes, so
it was nice to allow him to break a sweat," UCLA Coach Steve Lavin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Portland played at a fast pace but shot only 25% and UCLA turned
missed Pilot shots into fastbreak baskets. The Bruins also dominated
the boards, outrebounding Portland, 61-31, and taking 20 offensive
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "The score was dramatic, but the important thing is you can see a
team on the path of improvement," Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   It was UCLA's second victory after opening with losses to San
Diego and Duke. There is one more tuneup -- a home game Tuesday
against Northern Arizona -- before the Bruins travel to Kansas on
Dec. 21.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Fey, a 6-foot-11 center, started for the second game in a
row and made an impact for the first time, scoring five points in the
first three minutes. The Bruins utilized their significant size
advantage early, outrebounding Portland in the first half, 33-8.</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Cedric Bozeman played only 16 minutes because of a
sore back. His backup, sophomore Ryan Walcott, kept the offense
running crisply and scored nine points.</TE>
<TE>   By the second half the action resembled a pick-up game between
varsity and junior varsity teams, which suited the Bruins fine. After
losing two exhibitions and the opener against San Diego in front of
their home fans, cheers sounded good.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole game was a boost for us," Young said. "We ... need more
games like this."</TE>
<TE>   It marked the fifth time UCLA has scored 105 points in the last
five years and the biggest margin of victory since a 100-39 victory
over Morgan State in 1999. It was a laugher from a team that had
elicited little more than cringes.</TE>
<TE>   That it came at the expense of a popular former Bruin was of
little consequence.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael Holton will have a very successful program at Portland
and I loved seeing him," Young said. "But we need to get on track,
and this was a big step."</TE>

<KH>UCLA FOOTBALL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Price Says He's Not Candidate for Bruins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is not known whether the roar traveled all the way from Pullman to
Denver, where UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero was interviewing
Karl Dorrell and Greg Robinson. But the Washington State Cougars gave
throaty approval to Coach Mike Price's announcement Saturday that he
is not interested in the Bruin job.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not going to UCLA because I can't take you with me," Price
said to his players after practice.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, he was a long way from getting an offer -- and
reportedly that is what bothered Price about UCLA's belated request
to talk to him. According to sources, he did not believe he was a
serious candidate because Guerrero waited until Friday to ask for an
interview -- four days after Bob Toledo was fired.</LD>
<TE>   Guerrero has stayed focused on New Orleans Saint assistant Mike
Riley and Denver Bronco assistant Dorrell, although he did meet with
Kansas City Chief assistant Robinson on Saturday night after
interviewing Dorrell.</TE>
<TE>   Riley will fly to Los Angeles after the Saints play today and meet
with UCLA Chancellor Albert Carnesale tonight or Monday. Riley turned
down a lucrative offer from Alabama on Friday and has expressed a
desire to coach at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Although the interviews with Dorrell and Robinson reportedly went
well, Guerrero did not ask either coach to meet with Carnesale,
simply inquiring about where they could be reached Monday. Guerrero
is scheduled to fly to Dallas today to attend UCLA's NCAA
championship men's soccer game.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell and Robinson have the vocal support of their head coaches.
Chief Coach Dick Vermeil, who coached UCLA in 1974-75, called
Guerrero to boost Robinson early last week and Bronco Coach Mike
Shanahan praised Dorrell, who was a finalist for the San Diego State
opening last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Karl would be an excellent candidate," Shanahan said.
"He's a heck of a coach, a first-class person and he knows [Los
Angeles] well."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bronco receiver Scott Montgomery: "He's the kind of guy you
like to be around as a head coach and he fits right into that
player-coach type coach. At the same time, he's a good disciplinarian
and has a lot of talent."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, a respected defensive tactician, is in his second season
with the Chiefs after six years as defensive coordinator of the
Broncos. He is a Los Angeles native who spent 15 years in the
collegiate ranks, including eight at UCLA, which won three Rose Bowls
during his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson told a source early Friday afternoon that he had not been
contacted by UCLA, but apparently Guerrero contacted him later in the
day and set up the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cory Paus did not take part in the Bruins' first practice since
Dec. 6 on Saturday and is not expected to play in the Las Vegas Bowl
on Christmas Day. The senior quarterback sat out the last five games
because of a broken leg and had hoped to return for a bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Rodney Leisle said he is strongly considering
making himself available for the NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   Leisle, a junior, was a preseason All-American, but he sat out
four games because of a broken foot. He has 17 tackles and no sacks
in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Ryan Smith expects to be ready to play by spring practice
after having surgery on his ankle. Smith, a junior, injured the ankle
near the end of last season and had off-season surgery. However, he
never fully recovered and had only five receptions in eight games
before electing to have a doctor outside the UCLA staff evaluate the
ankle.</TE>

<HD>Paul's New Arrangement Is Flip Side of Lennon-McCartney</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Boucher</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clark &amp; Lewis? Costello &amp; Abbott? Hammerstein &amp; Rodgers? How about
McCartney &amp; Lennon?</LD>
<LD>   Messing with the name of a famous partnership can be jarring to
the ear, like some semantic pothole on memory lane or, worse, an
ungraceful recalculation of history. That's why a number of Beatles
lovers are asking Paul McCartney why, when it comes to the band's
storied songbook, he can't just let it be.</LD>
<LD>   The concert album by McCartney that hit the charts this month,
"Back in the U.S.," lists 19 Beatles songs written by "Paul McCartney
and John Lennon," a transposition of the classic "Lennon-McCartney"
signature line that is instantly recognizable across generations of
music fans. The tinkering is part of McCartney's ongoing attention to
legacy maintenance -- he wants more prominent crediting on his
defining works, such as "Yesterday" -- but it is a sour subject for
some observers, especially considering the death of Lennon 22 years
ago this month.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, an attorney for Yoko Ono, the widow of Lennon, said he
is "looking into" legal recourse available to block McCartney's
tinkering. Ono was traveling in Japan and unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "This was done against her wishes," said Peter Shukat, Ono's
attorney. "It's ridiculous, absurd and petty. Paul is hurting his own
legacy with this. He and John made an agreement 40 years ago that
they would share credit in this way. To change it now, well, John's
not here to argue."</TE>
<TE>   Geoff Baker, a London-based spokesman for McCartney, said Friday
that the entire matter is a tempest in a teapot. Baker points out
that it is general knowledge that no one, including Lennon, has ever
denied that McCartney was the lone or dominant creator of "Hey Jude,"
"The Long and Winding Road" or "Mother Nature's Son," and to put his
name first on the song credit is nothing more than history
housekeeping. Baker also says it is misleading to say the young
Lennon and McCartney had an ironclad deal to keep the credit
untouchable.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a divisive thing," Baker said. "It's not Lennon or
McCartney. Look, even if Paul did 95% or more on these songs, he's
not asking that John's name be taken off. He just doesn't think it
should be first."</TE>
<TE>   This is not a new campaign by McCartney, and history suggests
there is nothing Ono can do to stop him. In 1976, McCartney's
then-band Wings released a live album that also flipped the familiar
"Lennon-McCartney" credit, although another concert album a decade
ago saw him use it the traditional way. Since then, though,
McCartney's feud with Ono over the credits has ratcheted and the
former Beatle, now 60, has shown an intensified concern about how his
name will appear in the history books.</TE>
<TE>   McCartney has made several failed attempts to sway his former
bandmates or their families to alter the credits on newly minted
Beatles albums, but music law experts say that, on his own releases,
he can discard the standard credit line.</TE>
<TE>   Donald S. Passman is author of "All You Need to Know About the
Music Business" and an attorney who has represented Janet Jackson,
R.E.M., Pink and other music acts. He said omitting Lennon's name
altogether from a Beatles song credit would be cause for legal action
by the late star's estate, but that merely transposing the credit
likely does not because it does not seem to misrepresent the true
authorship or damage the song as a property.</TE>
<TE>   No song has been more central to the debate than "Yesterday," the
forlorn 1965 hit that has become one of the most popular and
oft-recorded songs of the 20th century. No song is more closely
associated with McCartney. He has often recounted that when he awoke
one morning, the melody was in his head as a whole and complete
thing. Not only was it his work solely, the hit recording was made
with a string quartet and none of the other Beatles present.</TE>
<TE>   When the song appeared on one of the "Anthology" releases that
have mined Beatles music in recent years, McCartney asked Ono if the
credits could be transposed. She refused.</TE>
<TE>   Ono recently told Rolling Stone magazine that she warned McCartney
that he might be doing himself a disservice in switching the credits.</TE>
<TE>   "If those songs are credited to 'McCartney-Lennon' and the rest of
the 200 or so are credited to 'Lennon-McCartney,' people may think
Paul wrote those songs and John wrote the rest," she said. "When the
suggestion was first made by Paul, I said, 'This is like opening a
Pandora's box, Paul. Don't do it.' I still stand by that statement."</TE>
<TE>   Martin Lewis, a well-known Beatles historian who worked on the
marketing of "Anthology," said, "It's been a battle for years, and in
the case of 'Anthology Vol. 2' in 1996, the spat caused delays while
they argued and we had to reprint the packaging. It was very
disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, a fixture at Beatles conventions around the country, said
the bickering is a sore spot for fans. The Beatles remain a potent
force in music -- their "1" collection of top hits was among the
best-selling albums of 2000 and McCartney's 2002 U.S. tour was both a
critical triumph and the top-grossing road act of the year -- and the
message of their lyrics runs counter to the family feuds.</TE>
<TE>   "They had Godlike talent but they still have human foibles, like
insecurity and vanity," Lewis said. "The fans want them to live up to
the philosophies of their songs. What is incontestable here is that
Paul McCartney is one of the greatest songwriters. In 100 years,
people will know that he wrote 'Yesterday.' "</TE>
<TE>   The future of "Yesterday" and the public opinion of 2102 are
exactly what McCartney is worried about, says Glenn Gass, a music
historian who teaches a course on the Beatles at Indiana University.
He believes McCartney is fearful that, for the ages, second billing
will make him seem a junior partner in the Beatles.</TE>
<TE>   "He is too paranoid that, in future centuries, they will read
'Lennon-McCartney' and assume he was lesser," Gass said. "To do this,
though, it's like messing with a sacred trust. This only cheapens him
and distracts from his true greatness."</TE>
<TE>   Some in the songwriting community scratch their heads at
McCartney's actions and any dust-ups it has caused. Take Mike
Stoller, of the prolific songwriting tandem Leiber &amp; Stoller, whose
memorable hits include "Hound Dog," "Jailhouse Rock" and "Poison
Ivy." Because Stoller is another famous partner with the trailing
credit -- the Paul position, if you will -- he has been hearing too
much about the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's silly in all directions," Stoller said. "It's silly
to change the order and silly to make a to-do about it."</TE>
<TE>   For the record, how did Stoller end up with the second spot in the
songbooks? "We just tried it both ways," he said, "and this was the
way it sounded better."</TE>
<TE>   That very same rhythmic reason, Lewis said, is the most often
cited reason that two gifted young men from Liverpool decided their
handiwork would be listed as the work of "Lennon-McCartney." That
agreement in the early 1960s had another important element: The
shared credit would appear on songs no matter what the level of
collaboration, even if one member had done nothing at all.</TE>
<TE>   There are early exceptions. On their first British album, "Please
Please Me," for instance, the "McCartney-Lennon" permutation appeared
on the sleeve. But from mid-1963 on, 'Lennon-McCartney' was the
standard, as shown by the title of a 1965 television special they
hosted: "The Music of Lennon &amp; McCartney."</TE>
<TE>   It was later that McCartney grew rueful of the credit, said Chris
Carter, host of the Los Angeles radio show "Breakfast with the
Beatles" and an interviewer of McCartney on the new "Back in the
U.S." concert DVD.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it became a thorn in his side," Carter said.</TE>
<TE>   McCartney has spent considerable energy in recent years on
building the historical record of the Beatles and himself. Besides
the sprawling "Anthologies" project, he has published his lyrics in
poetry form, toiled on a retrospective of Wings that led to an album,
a film and a book, and he is now preparing to rework the Beatles'
swan song, the "Let It Be" album, which drifted away from his vision.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul has reached an age where he is thinking of history," Lewis
said. "A lot of it has to do with the fact that John Lennon, after
his death, was mythologized, eulogized and canonized. Paul feels he
has to rehabilitate his image in comparison. And it's a real shame,
because he has nothing to prove to anyone."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Playing it backward:</TE>
<TE>   Paul McCartney's new concert album, "Back in the U.S.," was
released in late November. Nineteen Beatles songs on the CD feature a
revision of the classic "Lennon-McCartney" signature, instead using
the credit "Paul McCartney and John Lennon." The songs are:</TE>
<TE>   Hello Goodbye</TE>
<TE>   All My Loving</TE>
<TE>   Getting Better</TE>
<TE>   Blackbird</TE>
<TE>   We Can Work It Out</TE>

<HD>Past Meets Present for U.S. Collectors of British Muskets
in Afghanistan</HD>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>KABUL, Afghanistan -- For many U.S. troops stationed here, the
must-have souvenir is a 19th century British musket -- the remnant,
perhaps ironically, of a superpower's lost cause.</LD>
<LD>   Buyers say the guns give them a piece of Afghan history. The
antique firearms also help the owners identify with their
predecessors in arms: British expeditionary forces who fought three
disastrous wars here in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</LD>
<LD>   The fact that the British were so thoroughly trounced by the
Afghans seems only to enhance the guns' mystique and appeal.</LD>
<TE>   One collector is U.S. Marine pilot Lt. Col. James A. Dixon of
Yuma, Ariz., who proudly displays his 1863 and 1869 Enfield muskets
on the wall of his hooch, or tent. They are links to a historical
saga with resonance in his modern-day mission.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether these rifles were really there on the battlefield is not
important to me. It's the memory they bring to me of the British who
fought valiantly and of the places where those troops marched, which
is terrain I've flown over," said Dixon, who flies Marine Harrier
jets.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the rifles were left on the battlefield by fallen warriors
and kept in working order by generations of Afghans who still use
them for hunting, filling them with shot instead of the single musket
balls they were manufactured to use. The plains around Kabul, the
Afghan capital, where many of the 19th century battles took place,
are good hunting grounds for duck and partridge.</TE>
<TE>   Other firearms were imported over the years from India, a former
British colony, and still others are fakes, assemblages of
mix-and-match parts put together by Afghan merchants riding a
seller's market.</TE>
<TE>   Prices range from $100 to $1,000, roughly double those of a year
ago, when coalition troops first arrived after helping oust the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Gun shops on Chicken Street, Kabul's main shopping district, are
often filled Fridays and Sundays with uniformed troops looking for
rifles with the favored trademarks Enfield and Tower.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Customs Service and federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms regulations allow Americans to import guns only if the
weapons are antiques, meaning they are at least 100 years old.</TE>
<TE>   An Army spokeswoman at Bagram air base north of Kabul said only
Afghan rugs compete with British muskets for the wallets of souvenir
seekers.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the demand for the muskets comes from soldiers who take
part in reenactments of Civil War battles back home. Confederate
troops used Enfield muskets, U.S. Army spokesman Col. Roger King
said.</TE>
<TE>   The British fought three wars in Afghanistan -- from 1838 to 1842;
from 1878 to 1880; and in 1919 -- suffering thousands of casualties.</TE>
<TE>   In one battle during the first Anglo-Afghan war, in 1842, 17,000
British and Indian soldiers and camp followers were slaughtered
trying to return to India from Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   About 160 of Britain's dead are buried in Kabul's White Graveyard,
which, after years of neglect, was recently refurbished by British
and Commonwealth troops.</TE>
<TE>   Gear such as bayonets and watches left by the 1980s Soviet
occupiers also are hot items among collectors.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon said he buys historical souvenirs wherever he is stationed,
including olivewood relics from Israel, block prints from Japan and
brass artifacts from Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   An avid reader of history, Dixon researched his duty in
Afghanistan and knew he was coming to a violent place, one for which
an antique musket is an appropriate keepsake, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He started by reading about the Soviet occupation,  learning that
a Soviet infantry unit was attacked and virtually wiped out by Afghan
resistance fighters on a knoll just five miles north of the Bagram
runway.</TE>
<TE>   "So I asked myself, 'I wonder what else has gone on around here?'
" Dixon said.</TE>
<TE>   What did he find out? "That the country had been through wars now
for 300 to 400 years, in constant battle with only short respites of
20 years or so before they go right back into battle again," he said.</TE>

<HD>2 Held in Slaying of Diplomat</HD>
<DH>Suspected Al Qaeda members are charged with killing a U.S.
envoy in Jordan. Authorities say the men planned more attacks there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>AMMAN, Jordan</DL>
<LD>Security forces have arrested two suspected Al Qaeda members in the
assassination of a U.S. diplomat here two months ago, asserting that
the men were planning a series of attacks across Jordan on embassies,
celebrities, airliners and other targets, authorities said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Laurence Foley, 60, was gunned down outside his home by two men
who trained at Osama bin Laden's terror camps in Afghanistan and said
they took orders from one of the world's most wanted men, Abu Musab
Zarqawi, an alleged Al Qaeda lieutenant dispatched to bring "holy
war" to Western Europe, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Foley's death was supposed to be the first act in a reign of
terror across a nation that is a strategically important U.S. ally,
Jordanian officials said. They said they had seized surface-to-air
missiles, hand grenades, tear gas canisters and automatic weapons,
all calling cards for Al Qaeda and each one marked for use in Jordan.</LD>
<TE>   Information Minister Mohammed Adwan said Foley, a native of Boston
who had later lived in Oakland, Calif., was killed because he "just
happened to be an easy target."</TE>
<TE>   After his death, security forces swept through Amman, the capital,
detaining dozens of Islamic sympathizers. The two men charged in the
killing -- Salem Saad bin Suweid, a Libyan, and Yasser Fathy Ibrahim,
a Jordanian -- were arrested recently, and authorities said both
confessed to Foley's killing during interrogation.</TE>
<TE>   The assassination came at a difficult time for Jordan, a nation
squeezed in a tense and volatile region. On its western border, the
Palestinian intifada has entered its third year, while to the east,
there may soon be a war between the United States and Iraq. Jordan's
economy is bad, unemployment is high and the population is restive.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Foley's death, King Abdullah II, a young and largely
untested leader, had increasingly turned to his security forces to
keep order.</TE>
<TE>   But that apparently did not stop Al Qaeda from breaching Jordan's
defenses, including a sophisticated intelligence network considered
among the best in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Adwan said the Libyan suspect slipped into the country using a
phony Tunisian passport and, with his Jordanian accomplice, rented an
apartment in a town outside Amman. They worked alone, Adwan said, and
not as part of a terrorist cell.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 28, the information minister said, the men drove a car
they had rented from an individual -- who had no idea of their plans
-- to the quiet residential neighborhood where Foley lived. He was an
administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development and
did not travel with a heavy security escort.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Bin Suweid hid behind Foley's parked
Mercedes-Benz with a 7-millimeter handgun equipped with a silencer.
He shot the diplomat seven times in the head and body, then jumped in
the getaway car, driven by Ibrahim.</TE>
<TE>   Adwan said the authorities not only exacted a confession from the
men but recovered the weapon used in the slaying. He added that the
suspects had received $18,000 from Al Qaeda and were expecting an
additional $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   The killing sent a chill through Amman. Despite intense
anti-American sentiment stemming primarily from U.S. support for
Israel -- and from opposition to an attack on Iraq -- the city had
been considered safe for its 9,000 American residents.</TE>
<TE>   Since the slaying, the United States has withdrawn the several
dozen Peace Corps workers who had been here and has authorized
voluntary evacuations of all family members of U.S. Embassy employees
as well as of nonessential embassy employees. No one has accepted the
offer, but that is at least partly due to the way the program works:
Those who leave cannot return until the government deems the
situation improved, and that could take months.</TE>
<TE>   The anxiety had to deepen for the authorities when, according to
the official account, the two suspects confessed to being in league
with Zarqawi, a Jordanian considered to be among the top two dozen
leaders of Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Zarqawi was convicted in absentia in connection with a plot to
bomb tourist sites in Amman during the millennium celebration. He is
believed by intelligence agencies to be an important planner and
expert in mixing poisons. The German newsmagazine Der Spiegel
recently quoted intelligence officials as saying Al Qaeda had tapped
Zarqawi to orchestrate terror attacks in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The lingering anxiety was reflected in the low-key manner in which
the authorities announced the arrests. For Jordan, the announcement
represented a good news/bad news scenario. The good news was that
authorities found the men they say killed Foley. The bad news was
that Al Qaeda was operating in Jordan. The terror network has
threatened to attack any nation that gives support to the United
States, should it attack Iraq, and the threat has disquieted
U.S.-leaning governments from Saudi Arabia to Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very strange to have terrorism in Jordan," said Abdul Latif
Arabiyat, leader of the Islamic Action Front, the political arm of
the Muslim Brotherhood. "It is bad for us to have innocent people
killed here. Mr. Foley was under our security, under our umbrella.
This was a very painful thing for us, and everybody in Jordan has
condemned that death."</TE>
<TE>   Foley, a married father of three, had been working on projects to
deliver clean drinking water and health care to poor Jordanians and
provide loans to small businesses. He had worked for the Peace Corps
in India and the Philippines and carried out USAID assignments in
Bolivia, Peru and Zimbabwe.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of Foley's killing, U.S. Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm
Jr. condemned it as a "cowardly, criminal act" but did not call it
terror-related. On Saturday, the U.S. Embassy issued a statement but
refused to answer questions.</TE>
<TE>   The statement said, in part: "Larry Foley was a man dedicated to
improving the lives of others. He loved his work and his country. We
continue to honor him and the work he did here to help the Jordanian
people."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department spokesman Lou Fintor said: "We
welcome the Jordanian announcement earlier today of the arrest of two
men in connection with the tragic killing of USAID official Laurence
Foley. We deeply appreciate the excellent support and cooperation the
Jordanian government has provided throughout the investigation, and
we continue to consult closely with them regarding these arrests."</TE>

<LD>A month after a tanker spilled fuel oil off northwestern Spain, the
prime minister traveled to the tar-stained area to apologize for
failing to act more quickly to deal with the disaster.</LD>
<LD>   The government has been heavily criticized for mishandling the

<HD>Colombian Leader Vows to Strike Back</HD>
<DH>President Uribe blames rebels for bombings in Bogota that
injured 23, including a senator.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>President Alvaro Uribe vowed Saturday to strike back at leftist
rebels he blamed for bomb attacks that apparently were aimed at
national lawmakers and injured at least 23 people -- including a
prominent senator.</LD>
<LD>   An explosion shortly before midnight Friday on the 30th-floor
restaurant of the Tequendama Residences during a tango show injured
22 people and blew out windows, showering glass onto a boulevard
below. The bomb was hidden inside a suitcase and detonated by remote
control. The hotel is frequently used by lawmakers.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities were searching for a man and woman in their 20s
suspected of carrying the bomb into the restaurant, Bogota Police
Chief Gen. Hector Castro told reporters.</LD>
<TE>   Three hours earlier, a bomb disguised as a Christmas present
exploded in the Bogota office of Sen. German Vargas Lleras as he was
opening the package.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas, a member of Uribe's governing coalition, suffered minor
injuries to his hands. The senator has frequently denounced leftist
rebels fighting in Colombia's 38-year civil conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe said the attacks targeted legislators and blamed the leftist
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The president said
the FARC may have used training from the armed Basque separatist
group ETA and Northern Ireland's IRA to carry out the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to insist on more action from the armed forces and
demand more information from all Colombians," Uribe said. "We're
going to defeat these people."</TE>
<TE>   The residential hotel in the heart of the capital is on Bogota's
7th Avenue, which is lined with stores and museums. Lawmakers from
outlying provinces often stay there when Congress is in session, as
it is now.</TE>
<TE>   The normally combative Congress has in recent days shown support
for Uribe, approving a referendum on a plan to stem political
corruption and authorizing the president to oversee peace talks with
right-wing paramilitary groups.</TE>
<TE>   The FARC, whose fighters were blamed for an assassination attempt
on Uribe that killed innocent bystanders during the presidential
campaign, has accused the president of being a dictator and of
planning to surrender control of Colombia to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe promised to battle the rebels during the campaign. A recent
Gallup poll put his approval rating at 74%.</TE>

<HD>Ire Against U.S. Swells in S. Korea</HD>
<DH>As many as 100,000 denounce presence of American troops and
Bush's N. Korea stance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>SEOUL -- In the largest such demonstrations in recent memory --
indeed the largest public gatherings here since the World Cup -- as
many as 100,000 South Koreans took to the streets Saturday to air
grievances about U.S. conduct ranging from a fatal road accident
involving GIs to Bush administration actions on Iraq and North Korea.</LD>
<LD>   The largest crowd rallied in front of Seoul's City Hall, where
throngs also showed up during the World Cup soccer tournament in
June. Under a towering artificial Christmas tree, an estimated 50,000
people danced to the beat of a popular new Korean rock song that
vulgarly lambastes the U.S. Tens of thousands more protesters massed
in other South Korean cities.</LD>
<LD>   The country's riot police -- wielding shields and sheathed in
protective gear -- formed a human wall to surround the U.S. Embassy
in Seoul. The embassy issued statements warning American citizens to
avoid the area. But the demonstrations proved orderly.</LD>
<TE>   Few incidents were reported except in the city of Taegu, where
students wrapped in the South Korean flag scaled the walls of a U.S.
military base and climbed atop a water tower chanting anti-U.S.
slogans.</TE>
<TE>   The ostensible focus of the demonstrations was the deaths of two
teenage girls who were run over in June by a U.S. Army mine-clearing
vehicle and the acquittal last month before a court-martial of two
soldiers who were driving the vehicle. But with a crisis looming
concerning North Korea's nuclear weapons program, the protests took
on the broader issues of the role played by the 37,000 U.S. troops in
South Korea and the American war on terrorism. Activists from the
Philippines and Okinawa, Japan, came to Seoul to speak at the rally.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been more than 50 years since the United States came here,
and it is time to reconsider their presence," said Han Sang Ryul, a
Presbyterian minister who was one of the organizers of the Seoul
gathering. He and many other demonstrators said they were worried
less about North Korea's nuclear ambitions than about the prospect of
the Bush administration's provoking a war by attempting preemptive
strikes against North Korean weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, North Korea ratcheted up tensions with a raft of new
threats and anti-American rhetoric. In a letter to the Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy Agency, the North warned that it would
remove seals and monitors from nuclear installations if the agency
didn't do so immediately. North Korea asked the IAEA to do that
Thursday, but without threats to take unilateral action.</TE>
<TE>   The official North Korean newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, editorialized
that "the army and people of [North Korea] with burning hatred for
the Yankees are in full readiness to fight a death-defying battle."</TE>
<TE>   And yet another North Korean dispatch attacked the U.S. over the
release of the new James Bond film, "Die Another Day," in which
Bond's nemesis is a North Korean.</TE>
<TE>   Some conservatives in South Korea say North Korea is stirring
protests in the South to bolster its defense against the Bush
administration in the standoff over weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a manipulation from North Korea. They want to
create an anti-American atmosphere here at the same time there is
this weapons flap," said Norbert Vollertsen, a German physician who
is a prominent anti-North Korean activist here.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea has long been considered one of the United States'
strongest allies, its loyalty forged by the U.S. intervention against
the communist North in the 1950-53 Korean War. But recent polls have
shown that support for the presence of U.S. troops here is slipping,
particularly among the younger generation.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike student demonstrations here in the 1980s, recent protests
have brought out a broad cross section of society: homemakers,
shopkeepers, taxi drivers, bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that you have not only radical elements but mainstream
Koreans espousing some of these views is obviously something the U.S.
is concerned about," said one American diplomat, who asked not to be
named.</TE>
<TE>   Fury over the June 13 accident with the mine-clearing vehicle has
attained far more momentum than anyone might have anticipated. Since
the acquittal of the two GIs accused of negligent homicide, there
have been dozens of protests around the country and even in front of
the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Demonstrators believe that a Status of Forces Agreement is unfair
because it allows U.S. soldiers to be tried by courts-martial and not
Korean courts in cases of alleged crimes committed while on duty.
Many protesters have demanded a personal apology from President Bush.
The president did apologize to South Korean President Kim Dae Jung
for the June incident in a phone call Friday about the North Korean
situation, but that has not appeased protesters who believe he should
do so in public and in front of television cameras.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not a colony of the United States, and we don't want to be
treated that way," said Park Young Ja, 54, a coffee vendor in Seoul,
who added that despite her support for the protests, she remains a
conservative who does not want U.S. troops to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "We want them to stay here," she said. "But they must treat us as
equal partners."</TE>

<HD>U.N. Team Steps Up Pace of Inspections in Iraq</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>U.N. weapons inspectors pounced on about a dozen Iraqi sites
Saturday, including rooms at an infectious disease center where they
were denied access a day earlier.</LD>
<LD>   "Today was probably the single largest" group of sites inspected
since the investigators returned to Iraq on Nov. 27, said Hiro Ueki,
a spokesman for the United Nations program. He said 70 sites have
been visited.</LD>
<LD>   As Iraqi dissidents met in London to begin planning a future
without Saddam Hussein, the U.S. sent a fresh signal that it was
preparing for possible war with Iraq when the Defense Department
announced that it had ordered an additional 27,000 reservists to
prepare for active duty. Units ranging from Navy port workers to Army
engineers were told to be ready to be called up early next year.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Iraq said U.S. and British warplanes attacked civilian
targets in the southern part of the country Saturday, but the U.S.
military said the planes, policing "no-fly zones," had targeted Iraqi
air defense facilities.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 15 inspectors arrived Saturday in Iraq, bringing the
total to 113 since the U.N. resumed looking for evidence of nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons programs after a four-year hiatus.</TE>
<TE>   Among the sites examined was the main Iraqi nuclear center and a
Scud missile facility used to make bomb casings for chemical weapons
during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors revisited the Communicable Disease Control Center,
where they had been blocked Friday, the Muslim day of prayer. They
said there were no signs of seal-tampering and inspectors examined
the facility for an hour.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, chief U.N. arms inspector Hans Blix formally asked
Iraq to identify scientists who can be interviewed. Under a Nov. 8
Security Council resolution, the inspectors have the right to
interview in private anyone who might know details of Iraq's weapons
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, Kuwait's parliament met in special session and
rejected an apology from Hussein for the 1990-91 occupation of the
oil-rich emirate, saying it was a doomed attempt to stir unrest in
the key U.S. ally. Hussein issued a letter Dec. 7 that apologized for
the invasion but urged Kuwaitis to struggle against foreign armies --
seen as a reference to the thousands of U.S. troops training in
Kuwait.</TE>

<HD>Elections in Kenya May Put Voting Process to the Test</HD>
<DH>Some worry that the ruling party will resort to bribery,
violence and ballot-rigging, or will not hand over power if the
opposition wins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Davan Maharaj</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>Elections here are nearly two weeks away, but the son of President
Daniel Arap Moi already has won a seat in the House of
Representatives without a single ballot being cast.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Gideon Moi was declared the winner in the Rift Valley
province, which his father has represented for 47 years. His victory
came after three opposition candidates dropped out of the race. The
junior Moi and his rivals deny that they struck any deals. But many
observers say the challengers' sudden withdrawal was consistent with
the reputation of the ruling Kenya African National Union, or KANU,
to score easy victories by paying off opponents.</LD>
<LD>   As this East African nation approaches what many say is the most
important election since its 1963 independence from Britain, people
here no longer are talking about whether KANU will lose but whether
it will resort to bribery, violence and wide-scale ballot-rigging to
remain in power.</LD>
<TE>   A poll paid for by U.S. taxpayers revealed last week that KANU
presidential candidate Uhuru Kenyatta, Moi's handpicked successor and
the son of the nation's first president, trails Mwai Kibaki of the
opposition National Rainbow Coalition, or NARC, by nearly 50%. The
78-year-old president, who has ruled Kenya for nearly a quarter
century, is constitutionally barred from seeking reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "There is absolutely nothing KANU can do to stop this opposition
wave," said John Githongo, who heads the local chapter of
Transparency International, an international anti-corruption watchdog
group. "It's in their nature to rig, and they will try, but rigging
to overcome such a vast deficit might not be enough."</TE>
<TE>   David Makali, director of local think tank Media Institute,
agreed. "Within KANU, there is already a realization that [the
election] cannot be won."</TE>
<TE>   The East African, the region's most respected newspaper, reported
last week that KANU was resigned to losing the presidential race and
was trying to use a $40-million war chest to "induce defections" and
win a majority in the 210-seat parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition candidates say the ruling party has been using other
illegal tactics to achieve its goal. Kenyan police this month formed
a special squad to investigate allegations that ruling party
candidates have been buying voter identification cards for between $4
and $6 -- more than 50% of Kenyans earn less than $1 a day -- from
opposition supporters to ensure that they won't be able to vote.</TE>
<TE>   "To poor people, it's having some money to buy food," said Gabriel
Mukele, vice chairman of the Electoral Commission of Kenya, which
will oversee the Dec. 27 elections.</TE>
<TE>   Mukele said the commission had referred several reports of bribery
and voter-card buying to police. The cheating drew a rebuke from
Roman Catholic Bishop John Njue. "You should not sacrifice the
destiny of the country to the whims of the stomach," Njue told
hundreds of parishioners at a church service.</TE>
<TE>   Kenya's two previous multiparty elections -- in 1992 and 1997 --
were marred by allegations that KANU officials stuffed ballot boxes
and instigated bloody ethnic clashes to remain in power. Human rights
groups say party leaders stoked violence that resulted in the deaths
of hundreds of people and the displacement of 400,000 others.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the international community has pressured Moi's
government to hold free and fair elections. Sources said President
Bush and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told Moi in a meeting in
Washington this month that a smooth transition was the greatest
legacy he could leave.</TE>
<TE>   Kenya, with 30 million people, remains an important country in the
U.S.-declared war on terror. On Nov. 28, the country suffered its
second major terrorist attack in four years when suicide bombers blew
up an Israeli-owned beach resort near Mombasa, killing at least 16
people and injuring dozens more. In 1998, more than 200 people were
killed when suspects linked to the Al Qaeda terror network blew up
the U.S. embassies here in Nairobi and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is expected to recognize Kenya's role in the war on terrorism
when he visits Nairobi next month to open the new U.S. Embassy. By
then, Kenya is expected to have a new president, its third since
independence.</TE>
<TE>   Through candidate Kenyatta, Moi is hoping to extend KANU's
domination. His decision to pick Kenyatta, who failed to win a seat
in the last parliament, was a departure from his previous election
strategy, analysts say. Kenyans generally support candidates
belonging to their ethnic groups. For 24 years, Moi, who belongs to
the Kalenjin ethnic groups from the Rift Valley, has held power by
convincing other minorities that they needed to band together against
the larger Kikuyu and Luo tribes.</TE>
<TE>   Moi was hoping that Kenyatta, a Kikuyu, would draw massive support
from the tribe, said Gichira Kibara, head of the Center for Democracy
and Governance, a policy group. Kenyatta, a 1985 Amherst College
graduate who helps run his family's vast business empire, has been
pitching himself as the candidate of change even though his party has
been in power since 1963.</TE>
<TE>   But he "has failed to excite the traditional opposition base or to
convince the smaller tribes that he stands for their welfare," Kibara
said. About 68% of the 3,000 voters interviewed for a poll sponsored
by the Washington-based International Republican Institute said they
planned to vote for Kibaki. The poll, paid for by the U.S.
government, also found that 21% of respondents said they would back
Kenyatta.</TE>
<TE>   The poll indicated that opposition NARC could win parliamentary
elections by a landslide. About 65% responded that they would vote
for NARC's candidates, compared with 22% who said they would support
KANU.</TE>
<TE>   Despite failing to win a majority of the vote in the two previous
elections, Moi's party has managed to retain power -- thanks to
Kenya's fractious opposition -- by building coalitions. But so far,
opposition leaders and several former government ministers who
defected from KANU to protest the selection of Kenyatta have remained
united under the 71-year-old Kibaki, who lost the last two elections
to Moi.</TE>
<TE>   Kibaki was recently in a London hospital recuperating from
injuries he suffered this month when a matatu, or minibus taxi,
crashed into his sport utility vehicle. Analysts say the opposition's
campaign could be boosted after thousands of Kenyans lined the
streets to welcome him home this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Huge crowds have attended rallies across the country to support
Kibaki and opposition candidates. Many Kenyans, who are experiencing
the worst economic recession since independence, say they are hungry
for change after years of corruption, mismanagement and poverty.</TE>
<TE>   "All is possible without Moi," members of the crowd usually chant
in Swahili.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics worry KANU will not hand over power if the opposition
wins. But Kibara, the policy group leader, and others say that could
be disastrous.</TE>
<TE>   "Kenyans have so far restrained themselves, thinking that once Moi
exits the scene they will have a chance to improve their lives,"
Kibara said. "If KANU refuses to concede, they will see that there is
really no hope. Violence will be certain."</TE>
<TE>   In a speech Thursday at a Nairobi stadium, Moi promised to hand
over power to the winner and called on Kenyans to accept the results.
"If we fail this test," he said, "we would be seen as just another

<HD>Israel Detains 14 Palestinians in the West Bank; 1 Slain in
Gaza</HD>
<DH>Army says those held are 'terror suspects.' Mideast
mediators are to meet in Washington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli forces detained at least 14 Palestinians in the West Bank on
Saturday in a new sweep for militants.</LD>
<LD>   An Israeli army spokesman said 12 "terror suspects" were seized
overnight around Ramallah, political base of Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat, and two in the Bethlehem area. Troops
continued scouring Bethlehem after daybreak.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday night, the Israeli army killed a Palestinian at the
Gaza Strip's flash-point border with Egypt.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli military sources said that forces opened fire at
Palestinian gunmen approaching them near the frontier town of Rafah
about midnight and that one of them was hit. Palestinian security
officials said Israel had handed over a man's body from the scene.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the army killed two militants in the West Bank. Hamas,
an Islamic group sworn to Israel's destruction and which has carried
out suicide bombings in a nearly 27-month-old Palestinian uprising,
issued new calls for revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Middle East mediators were due to meet this week in Washington on
a peace plan initiated more than six months ago. But diplomats said
it was unlikely that the "road map" for three-stage rapprochement
between Israel and the Palestinians, culminating in security for the
former and statehood for the latter, would be completed as scheduled
on Dec. 20.</TE>
<TE>   The mediators -- the United States, the European Union, Russia and
the United Nations -- broadly agree on what the plan should include
but disagree on when to release it.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis and Palestinians disagree on the fundamental question of
how specific the plan should be.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the timing is the Israeli general elections,
scheduled for Jan. 28.</TE>
<TE>   "Washington has made it clear that no final plan will be presented
before the new government is in power," an official in Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon's office said. "Of course, that new government will then
have to approve the plan."</TE>
<TE>   A Palestinian official said that demonstrated the United States
was again acting as Israel's guardian ally.</TE>
<TE>   "This shows that the American policy intervenes only for the good
of Sharon, not for the good of the peace process," Palestinian
official Saeb Erekat said.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz was to leave for a week of
high-level talks in New York and Washington, the official in Sharon's
office said.</TE>
<TE>   Mofaz was due to meet U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who
in a Washington policy speech Thursday blamed the Middle East
stalemate on Palestinian terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Washington backs Israel's stance that Arafat bears responsibility
for suicide bombings and other militant attacks, and has called for
new Palestinian leaders to be elected.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat denies culpability and says Israeli countermeasures in the
territories have undermined his security forces' capabilities. On
Saturday, he hinted that his continued popularity would be proved by
a vote scheduled for Jan. 20.</TE>
<TE>   "Palestinian people will decide the new Palestinian leadership in
the coming elections," he told reporters at his Ramallah headquarters
Saturday.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LAHORE, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>A Pakistani court freed a top leader of a banned Kashmiri militant
group from house arrest Saturday, and India said that was proof
Pakistan continued to support terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Maulana Masood Azhar of Jaish-e-Mohammed, a group that Pakistani
President Pervez Musharraf outlawed a year ago for waging an
insurgency in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir, was placed
under house arrest in the Punjabi city Bahawalpur in December 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Under a Public Safety Act, Azhar's arrest has come up for review
by a special judicial commission every three months. On Saturday, a
three-member review board of the Lahore High Court rejected a request
by the Punjab Home Department to extend Azhar's detention for three
more months, saying there were no grounds to keep him.</LD>
<TE>   Azhar was one of three men released from an Indian prison in a
deal with New Delhi after an Indian airliner was hijacked in late
1999 to Kabul, the Afghan capital. The other two men freed were Ahmad
Omar Saeed Sheikh, also known as Sheikh Omar, convicted this year for
the killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, and Mushtaq
Ahmed Zargar.</TE>
<TE>   "It is quite clear that investigation and charges against Masood
Azhar have not been pursued by Pakistani authorities with any
seriousness," an Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   New Delhi blames Pakistan for allowing Pakistan-based militant
groups to cross into the Indian-ruled portion of Kashmir to fight an
insurgency there that has claimed more than 35,000 lives since 1989.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Seeks to Trip Up Iraq</HD>
<DH>Baghdad's declaration is combed for a few prime
discrepancies. With proof in hand, U.N. inspectors could move quickly
and in concert to uncover weapons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>To prepare for phase two of the disarmament campaign in Iraq, U.S.
intelligence is "whittling down" a list of discrepancies and holes in
Baghdad's arms declaration to identify the top half-dozen or so as
the basis for an intense and tightly timed series of inspections,
probably in the new year, according to U.S. officials.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration wants to identify a few "clear winners"
that will either find hidden weapons of mass destruction, produce
proof that they still exist elsewhere or lead to a confrontation
because Iraqi President Saddam Hussein balks at full compliance, the
sources said.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the trickiest stage. We won't have many chances to screw
up. Otherwise, we'll lose the initiative. If the first couple
inspections turn up nothing and it looks like we're crying wolf, then
it'll discredit or make harder subsequent efforts that may have more
merit," said one well-placed U.S. official who requested anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to pick clear winners and play it right or the United
Nations will run out of patience and we'll hand the advantage back to
Saddam. So there's a lot of gamesmanship involved here," the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   Speed will be crucial to success during phase two, U.S. officials
added. Washington will press the U.N. teams to move more decisively
than in the current piecemeal fashion, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "When everything is in place, then they'll move quickly and in a
concerted fashion. It's like trying to find cockroaches in your
kitchen at midnight. Once you turn on the light, you have less than
three minutes to get them. It's the same principle with Iraq," said a
Bush administration official.</TE>
<TE>   To block or chase attempts to move materiel, the U.S. wants the
inspections to deploy rapid-response "B teams" alongside the "A
teams" assigned to do the initial investigations -- a follow-up
capability earlier U.N. inspectors didn't have, the sources said.</TE>
<TE>   And, to ensure the inspections' maximum effectiveness, the
planning will have to be "down to the second" -- to coordinate, for
example, satellites monitoring Iraqi trucks that might be parked near
a facility and might move out as a U.N. team moved in -- said an
official involved in the process.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want him to be able to play a shell game with the
inspectors," the administration official said in reference to
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The phase two inspections will also have to be "married" to
interviews with Iraqi scientists, engineers and other technicians
involved in specific weapons programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we've whittled down the list of discrepancies or targets,
we'll say, 'This is our recommended strategy to test Iraqi
assertions, and here are three ways you can go about proving they're
lying,' " said the well-placed source.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. inspectors will be encouraged to launch simultaneous
investigations of possible storage facilities, research and
development sites, and Iraqi personnel who should have inside
information about nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or
ballistic missiles, the sources added.</TE>
<TE>   Still, U.S. officials predict that even an intricately coordinated
round of inspections could be fraught with problems.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was easy, we would have proved he was lying a long time
ago," said the administration official.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the sheer volume of reputed discrepancies in the
declaration, the United States has decided that for now it is
unrealistic to pursue most of them on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   But many of the disparities will be compiled in a fuller record
for the U.N. Security Council, U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It'd take forever to prove all of them, so our strategy is to be
like a canary in a coal mine," said the well-placed official.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, backed by Britain, is also preparing a
major diplomatic offensive to ensure that France, Russia and China --
the other three permanent members of the Security Council -- all take
a tough stand after fully evaluating the 11,807-page document
submitted to the U.N. a week ago by Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has reportedly been engaged in
almost daily telephone calls to his counterparts among the so-called
Perm-5, discussions that continued over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "He's coordinating our approach with other friends and inspectors
as we move toward formal discussions next week," said a senior State
Department official.</TE>
<TE>   Washington plans to keep the identities of the selected sites and
scientists close to the vest as long as possible to avoid giving
Hussein any hint of the targets, but U.S. officials acknowledge that
the Iraqi leader could easily figure out what the most likely ones
are.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in an apparent attempt to ease the international
pressure on him, Hussein has begun playing an aggressively defensive
game, cutting off key players in the Iraq showdown from lucrative
financial deals, say U.S. officials and regional experts.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Iraq's Oil Ministry notified Moscow that it was
canceling a $3.7-billion deal to develop its West Qurnah field,
Russia's Interfax news agency reported, quoting a Russian Lukoil
spokesman. Lukoil's failure to develop the field, which is estimated
to have reserves of 7.3 billion barrels, was cited as the reason.</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad has been pressing the Russians to begin work on the field,
a move that would violate U.N. economic sanctions. Although Russia
has long argued Baghdad's case at the United Nations, Moscow voted
last month for the U.N. resolution authorizing inspections.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam expects them to do more to end inspections, to end
sanctions and to work harder to press his case. He's disappointed
when they don't. He's always said that those who work with him would
be favored in contracts and those who didn't work with him or support
his position would pay," said Judith Yaphe, a former intelligence
analyst now at the National Defense University in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Iraq has recently canceled food contracts with
Australia, apparently also because of its support for the U.S.
position.</TE>
<TE>   "He's playing a clever chess game at the moment," Yaphe said.</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad is also putting pressure on neighbors, notably Turkey and
Jordan, with warnings that if Hussein's regime is toppled, they too
will pay a big price.</TE>
<TE>   "The message is clear: 'If we go down, you'll go down with us. And
if you're thinking of opposing us or supporting Americans, and if
Americans invade and you don't work to prevent it, there'll be chaos
in the region and your economies will be in the toilet,' " Yaphe
added. "That can have an impact because these are fragile regimes."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's apology to Kuwait earlier this month also had an
aggressive sub-theme directed at other neighbors in the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   "It was more of a threat than an apology. He basically called on
the Kuwaiti people to rise up against Americans and the ruling Al
Sabah family. He said they were corrupt and put Kuwaiti money in
Western banks," said Henri J. Barkey, a former policy planning
staffer on Iraq at the State Department now at Lehigh University.
"He's trying to show that he still has the ability to punish people."</TE>
<TE>   The administration says it isn't worried about Baghdad's recent
moves.</TE>
<TE>   "These things only alienate his friends. They're not successful,"
said the State Department official. "The fact is that, like us,
they're focused on disarmament before anything else."</TE>

<HD>Controversy Widens Over Ukraine Tapes</HD>
<DH>A dispute has arisen about the origins of recordings
implicating the president in a journalist's death and in arms sales
to Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Mycio</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>KIEV, Ukraine</DL>
<LD>KIEV, Ukraine -- Secret recordings of President Leonid D. Kuchma have
led to the sharpest rift between Ukraine and the U.S. in a decade,
after Washington accused him of approving the sale of military radar
to Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   A series of recordings, the first surfacing two years ago, has
become Kuchma's political nightmare. The initial recordings
implicated the president in the slaying of a journalist. Recordings
of other incriminating conversations have since been released, most
dealing with Kuchma's efforts to limit dissent.</LD>
<LD>   This spring, recordings from the president's office appeared
containing a conversation suggesting that he had approved the sale of
Kolchuga radar systems to Iraq for $100 million. There is controversy
about how the recordings were made.</LD>
<TE>   Kuchma's reputation in the West was tainted by the disappearance
of journalist Georgi Gongadze. However, the Bush administration's
conclusion that the Kolchuga recordings are authentic -- followed by
a report late last month from 13 U.S. and British investigators that
there was a "credible possibility" that the radar deal occurred --
have caused a deep split between Ukraine and the U.S., its most
powerful ally.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no evidence on which [the U.S.] can base such
unambiguous conclusions," Viktor Medvedchuk, Kuchma's administration
chief, declared last month while arguing that the recordings were
manipulated.</TE>
<TE>   Former presidential bodyguard Mykola Melnichenko, who now lives in
the U.S., contends that he secretly made digital recordings of the
July 2000 Kolchuga conversation in Kuchma's office. He says he also
recorded the tapes linking the president to Gongadze's disappearance
in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Gongadze recordings, made public after the discovery of the
journalist's headless corpse in November 2000, engulfed Kuchma in a
scandal that weakened him at home, isolated him from the West and
forced him to turn to Russia for support.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Melnichenko has been pilloried by the Kuchma camp and
praised by the opposition -- and by many in the West.</TE>
<TE>   But the former bodyguard's inconsistencies, together with the
mysterious appearance early this year of hundreds of hours of
additional recordings, are prompting a growing number of people --
including many of Kuchma's avowed foes -- to question the
whistle-blower's claims about how he made the recordings and for what
purpose. Melnichenko has become such a polarizing figure that
Ukraine's few remaining nonpartisan journalists use pseudonyms when
they take issue with his story.</TE>
<TE>   "I would lose contacts with opposition politicians and journalists
if they knew it was me," said a Kiev reporter, who used a pseudonym
on a recent article on the recordings. "Everyone thinks journalists
have to take sides. So if you question Melnichenko, you must be a
Kuchma apologist."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Melnichenko's story has not been seriously
scrutinized. He often has refused to answer questions, and his public
statements have been inconsistent. He declined to be interviewed for
this article.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a year, Melnichenko maintained that he had recorded
Kuchma with a Toshiba DMR-SX1 digital recorder hidden under a couch
in the president's office and had acted alone with no goal but to
bring the Ukrainian leader to justice. This summer, however,
Melnichenko announced that he had used several different recorders
and had tapes of Kuchma speaking at the president's country residence
and in a sauna.</TE>
<TE>   The new version of events came after Oleksandr Zhyr, an outspoken
Kuchma critic and the former chief of a parliamentary commission set
up to investigate the Gongadze case, said he was in possession of
hundreds of hours of recordings.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, Melnichenko submitted to the commission about 45 hours
of presidential conversations on two compact discs, though he has
refused to say who made the copies. Copies are widely available, and
their contents are on a Harvard Web site:
www.wcfia.harvard.edu/academy/melnychenko.</TE>
<TE>   The CDs purportedly contain the complete digital recordings of the
Gongadze conversations. The talks were scattered over several months
and were spliced together with a computer program called Sound Forge
for a continuous recording of episodes dealing with the missing
journalist.</TE>
<TE>   Zhyr's revelation suggests that Melnichenko may not have been the
only one with access to recordings. Yuri Shvets, a Washington-based
attorney working with Zhyr to disseminate what he says are 700 hours
of recordings dating from October 1999 on a Web site
www.5element.net, insisted in a telephone interview that he did not
get them from Melnichenko. "We got them in Ukraine. And Melnichenko
got them from us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shvets, Zhyr and Melnichenko are former KGB agents.</TE>
<TE>   Zhyr, who is in Ukraine, is vague about the recordings' origins,
though he says there probably are more to come. Because the Toshiba
automatically notes the date and time of a recording, it is evident
that chunks of time are missing, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of what is on the new collection of recordings duplicates
the material on the CDs. But there are many new episodes -- including
the Kolchuga deal.</TE>
<TE>   In that conversation, Kuchma allegedly tells Valery Malev, then in
charge of Ukraine's arms exports, to go ahead with a $100-million
sale of three Kolchuga radars to Iraq. The Kolchuga is a passive
radar that gives out no signals of its own and thus isn't detected by
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The new collection has led to some bizarre conflicts. In August,
when a Ukrainian Web site ran a transcript provided by Shvets that
detailed Kuchma purportedly discussing espionage against foreign
embassies, Melnichenko successfully asked that it be removed and that
the media not publish transcripts without his authentication.</TE>
<TE>   He then produced his own transcripts of the Gongadze conversations
and declared them the sole authentic versions. But Ukrainian
journalist Olexi Stepura, who has prepared painstaking transcripts of
the purported originals on the 45-hour CDs, contends that
Melnichenko's transcripts were of the recordings edited by the Sound
Forge program, which removed entire sentences from the original
recordings.</TE>
<TE>   None of the edits deal with Gongadze, but Stepura says: "They do
suggest that Melnichenko has not listened to the recordings and is
unaware of the discrepancies."</TE>
<TE>   But the evidence showing that Melnichenko is not in exclusive
control of Kuchma recordings and that other, more mysterious sources
are releasing them raises doubts about his account. Though many
people found it possible to believe that one person could record 45
hours with a device hidden under a couch, the existence of 700 hours
suggests a much more complex operation.</TE>
<TE>   Shvets is blunt about the logistics. "Melnichenko may have done
some recordings himself toward the end of the operation," he said.
"But an entire team had to be involved in this, and they had to have
high political protection."</TE>
<TE>   He says certain Ukrainian oligarchs spearheaded the operation to
blackmail Kuchma for their own ends. "But things got out of control,
and we got the recordings," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The situation has become so convoluted that parliamentary speaker
Volodymyr Lytvyn early last month became the first high-ranking
Ukrainian official to call for all of the recordings to be made
public.</TE>
<TE>   "There are political forces in Ukraine who don't want the truth to
be known," Lytvyn, whose voice figures in the recordings, told BBC.
"But we need to hear about everyone who was in the president's office
-- those who were in power and those that were secretly influencing
them."</TE>

<HD>Money Launderers Find New Ways to Fund Terror</HD>
<DH>German investigators suspect donations for radical Islamic
schools and camps were used to buy luxury cars, which were then sold
abroad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Watson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Dogged by investigators tracking the funds raised for terrorists,
money launderers constantly find new ways to give them the slip.
German police suspect that one trick may be as simple as buying some
fine cars.</LD>
<LD>   Police at Germany's Frankfurt airport were suspicious when a Saudi
and three Pakistanis stepped up to the immigration counter last year
with a letter of invitation from a local luxury auto dealer. The
travelers, including a Muslim cleric in his 70s, didn't look like
high-end car merchants. Border officers searched their luggage.</LD>
<LD>   They found fund-raising letters from Islamic schools and cultural
groups in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Europe, according to a
confidential Pakistani Interior Ministry report on the incident
recently leaked to the media.</LD>
<TE>   German federal police think that the groups are linked to militant
Islamists and are using donations to buy luxury cars that are
exported through Hamburg's port for sale in Saudi Arabia. Millions of
dollars laundered this way each year are then channeled to militants
in Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Middle East, according to the
report.</TE>
<TE>   German security officials informed Pakistani Ambassador Asif Ezdi
of their investigation, according to the report, and sought his
government's help with this warning: "In our assessment, money
collected here [in Germany] is used to buy cars, export them to Saudi
Arabia and resell them. Income earned in this way is then transferred
to Islamic organizations and Al Qaeda elements in Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>   Despite their suspicions, German police have found no evidence of
a crime in the Frankfurt case, and no charges were filed against the
four men. Like investigators around the world, the Germans are having
trouble sorting out good money from bad in their effort to dry up
suspected terrorist finances.</TE>
<TE>   So far in the war against terrorism, Washington has designated 243
individuals and entities in several countries as terrorist
financiers, and, with its allies, has blocked more than $133 million
in funds, according to Jimmy Gurule, the U.S. Treasury Department's
undersecretary for enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   It is complex work, and "these schemes to move money globally are
very, very difficult to uncover," he said. "The money trail can be
very difficult to follow.</TE>
<TE>   "And, of course, these terrorist financiers are looking for new
ways all the time to raise money and to move money," Gurule added.
"And as we continue to put pressure on one aspect of their means to
move money, such as the banking sector, then of course they're likely
to move away from that mechanism for moving money and look to less
formal mechanisms."</TE>
<TE>   If German police are right, tougher controls have not stopped
Islamists from raising and moving large amounts of cash from Islamic
charities in Saudi Arabia and Western Europe to radical religious
schools and terrorist training camps in Pakistan, Afghanistan and
Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   Germany's equivalent of the FBI, the Bundeskriminalamt, has traced
car exports to the four men questioned in Frankfurt. Investigators
suspect that they make up one of 12 money-laundering rings believed
to be operating in Germany's 16 states to support militant training
camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Hezbollah bases in
Lebanon and the Palestinian group Hamas. Yet authorities seem
powerless to stop such activity.</TE>
<TE>   German police refuse to discuss details of the case. But a
Pakistani diplomat said he had spoken with German authorities and
confirmed that no one was arrested after the Frankfurt incident.
"When we checked, we were told that those persons have done nothing
illegal," said the diplomat, who spoke on the condition he not be
identified.</TE>
<TE>   Job Tilman, spokesman for the Frankfurt prosecutor's office,
confirmed that police are probing the money-laundering allegations in
"an ongoing investigation against unspecified persons for membership
in a criminal organization."</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, the Group of 7 industrialized nations created the
Financial Action Task Force to develop strategies against money
laundering, but the task force's 31 member countries -- including the
U.S. -- only began to focus on terrorist financing after the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The billions of dollars that organized gangs and drug traffickers
launder each year come from traditional criminal enterprises, which
often give investigators an obvious crime to look for. But terrorist
groups increasingly rely on charitable donations and other legitimate
methods of raising and moving money that make a crime more difficult
to detect, said Patrick Moulette, the task force's executive
secretary.</TE>
<TE>   New Techniques</TE>
<TE>   "It is certain that the money launderers are very good and that
they have a great imagination to invent new techniques all the time,"
Moulette said from Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Last month in Rome, the task force brought 170 police, customs
officers and other government officials from several continents to
swap stories on money-laundering techniques and discuss ways to deal
with them.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, when the task force studied for the first time how
terrorists launder money, experts reported numerous dodges that were
frighteningly simple. One unidentified group moved about $7 million
by purchasing money orders worth $500 to $1,000 each, done so
blatantly that the serial numbers ran in sequence. Another operation
used three grocery stores as a front to move large amounts of cash.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, the task force concentrated on charities and
an informal international money-trading network known as hawala,
which moves hundreds of millions of dollars across borders each year
without formal bookkeeping -- and beyond the prying eyes of
government regulators.</TE>
<TE>   German federal police are looking at Islamic charities and hawala
middlemen in their investigation into money-laundering rings.</TE>
<TE>   In the Pakistani Interior Ministry report on the Frankfurt
incident, the three Pakistanis are identified as Mohammed Younas,
Mohammed Abdullah and Mohammed Ismail. The Saudi is identified only
as Mohammed Z. All had arrived from the Saudi city of Jidda, where
they received visas from the German Consulate using an invitation
letter from Jericho Automobil, a small Frankfurt dealership selling
Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail, who is in his 70s and was born under British rule in what
is now India, was carrying two briefcases, according to the report.
In one, police found documents bearing the letterhead of several
Islamic groups.</TE>
<TE>   Two are in Germany: the Islamic Cultural Assn. in Heidelberg and
the Islamic Welfare Organization in Bochum. Two others are in the
Netherlands: the Ayasofia Mosque Mili Goerues in Amsterdam and the
Islamic Cultural and Information Center, Abu-Bakar Mosque, in
Nijmegen. Another document was written on the letterhead of the
International Islamic Welfare Organization of Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials interviewed in Germany and Pakistan provided
no evidence that any of the groups have broken any laws.</TE>
<TE>   Introduction Letters</TE>
<TE>   Ismail, who told police that he lives in Karachi, had a letter of
introduction in his second briefcase. It said he was the official
representative of the Madrasa Jamia Arabia Nazirul Islam in Karachi
and was authorized to collect money on the religious school's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail's fund-raising letter was certified by "Pakistani
authorities," according to the Interior Ministry report, which
identifies neither the officials who gave their approval nor the
agencies involved.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the religious and government bodies that regulate
Pakistan's madrasas, or Islamic schools, said in interviews that they
have no record of the Karachi school where, other documents cited in
the Pakistani report indicated, Ismail claims to be a senior cleric.</TE>
<TE>   "German authorities believe that Ismail was collecting money from
Islamic organizations in west Europe and taking it out," the
Pakistani government report said, adding: "The letter of
recommendation carried by him said not only that he was authorized to
collect donations, but also that among 250 pupils at the school there
were also some who were prepared to lay down their lives for the holy
war against USA/Christians."</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, Ezdi, the ambassador, informed the
Pakistani Foreign Ministry of the German investigation and asked his
superiors "to look into the matter and pass on the relevant facts to
him as he has to inform the German authorities."</TE>
<TE>   But the matter ended there, according to an Interior Ministry
source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "We never received any instructions from the Foreign Office to
investigate the case," the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Jericho Automobil, the Frankfurt car dealership where the men said
they wanted to do business, has about 30 Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs,
most of them used, for sale in the shadow of the steel and glass
towers that line the financial district.</TE>
<TE>   The manager, Aziz Dasan, is a German citizen of Palestinian
descent. He emigrated with his family 20 years ago after fleeing his
homeland to Jordan during the 1967 Middle East War. German police
have not accused Dasan of any crime, and he said they have not
interviewed him.</TE>
<TE>   Displayed proudly behind his desk are pictures of three daughters,
each receiving a kiss on the hand from Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat during an official visit to Germany.
"Chancellor [Gerhard] Schroeder was there too," Dasan said, adding:
"I would be glad if I had ever met Arafat, but I didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Visits to Car Dealership</TE>
<TE>   Dasan said he vaguely remembers two or three of the men named in
the German inquiry paying a visit to his dealership before November
2001. They didn't buy anything and were interested in the used cars
because they said new models were too expensive, Dasan said.</TE>
<TE>   They asked him to fax an invitation letter so that they could
return to Germany and do business with him then, Dasan added. He said
that's a common request because 70% of his sales are for export to
the Middle East, mainly to Kuwait and Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Dasan estimated that he used to fax four or five invitation
letters a year to German visa offices abroad on behalf of potential
buyers. He said he stopped after his dealership's name appeared in a
police report on the Frankfurt airport encounter that was leaked to a
local newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi and Pakistanis returned to Dasan's dealership in
November 2001, he said, apparently after they were questioned by
border police. They didn't buy any cars then either, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Publicity surrounding the incident has been bad for business,
Dasan said. Next year, he'll have to find a smaller store to rent
because two businesses that sublease from him are pulling out.</TE>
<TE>   "They are afraid that something will happen to their shops," he
said. "There are a lot of crazy people out there."</TE>

<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- When the 10 nonnuclear members of the Security
Council receive their censored copy of Iraq's weapons declaration
Monday, the reports will no longer contain Iraq's recipes for weapons
of mass destruction. But another potentially volatile ingredient will
be excised as well: the names of foreign companies that, knowingly or
not, have supplied Iraq with weapons-making materials.</LD>
<LD>   Security Council members are concerned not only that such
disclosures might embarrass their nations' companies but also that
Iraq might have set out to do so intentionally, by naming prestigious
multinationals or firms connected with government officials.</LD>
<LD>   For their part, U.N. inspectors say that they don't want to
undermine any intelligence-gathering efforts done with the
cooperation of companies and that they are also worried about
liability issues.</LD>
<TE>   "Should they be held responsible if they thought they were selling
a fermenter to a beer company and it ended up in a biological weapons
program in Iraq?" asked Ewen Buchanan of the U.N.'s inspection
office.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear whether any of the companies or countries named on
Iraq's current list are new to U.N. inspectors or whether they refer
to previously unknown transactions. A nine-page index to the new
Iraqi declaration suggests that, as in the past, Iraq has chiefly
duplicated information about procurement activities that occurred
before 1991.</TE>
<TE>   But past Iraqi declarations and documents discovered by U.N.
weapons inspectors in Iraq from 1991 to 1998 "were littered with the
names of suppliers," Buchanan said.</TE>
<TE>   One set of Iraqi documents in particular, dating from 1996 and
1997, was "chockablock with supplier names, front companies, letters
of credit and other details," recalled a former U.N. inspector who
asked not to be identified. Those names, with the exception of
several accidentally revealed in one U.N. report, have never been
made public by the world body.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of the declared deals were done legally before the
Security Council ordered Baghdad to give up its weapons of mass
destruction in 1991, they reveal the deceptions Iraq employed to
obtain the building blocks of its weapons programs, especially its
allegedly extensive biological weapons efforts.</TE>
<TE>   According to accidental disclosures in a 1999 U.N. report compiled
under then-chief weapons inspector Richard Butler, from 1985 to 1989,
Iraq bought strains of anthrax, botulinum toxin, gangrene, West Nile
virus and other pathogens from the American Type Culture Collection,
a biological supply firm in Rockville, Md. Iraq also successfully
ordered germ strains from the Pasteur Institute in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the strains were ordered in the name of the University of
Baghdad, considered to be a place of legitimate research, while
others went to a front company acting as a purchasing agent for
Iraq's weapons program. But all were paid for by the military,
according to Iraqi records turned over to the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   Companies in Italy, Germany and Switzerland supplied fermenters
used to grow the germs. In 1987 and 1988, 39 tons of growth media
sufficient to produce about 4 tons of bacteria -- enough to kill
everyone in the world many times over -- came from the Oxoid company
in Britain and Fluka Chemie in Switzerland. Iraq still hasn't
accounted for the remaining growth media, U.S. and U.N. analysts have
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rolf Ekeus, the chief U.N. inspector in the 1990s, decided at the
time not to publicly identify any of Iraq's foreign suppliers to
ensure their cooperation in U.N. intelligence-gathering efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan said that previous inspection teams would often question
suppliers about what they had sold to whom and then cross-check the
information. Often, the process revealed the middlemen or front
companies that had procured materials for Iraq's covert weapons
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix said last week that he
intends to follow suit and to excise the names in the new report
before he shares it with the 10 nonnuclear members of the Security
Council. If the inspectors "were to give the names publicly, they
would never get another foreign supplier to give them any
information," Blix told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1990s, U.N. inspectors tracked scores of suspect
transactions to companies in Eastern Europe, Asia and elsewhere. More
recently, Western intelligence agencies have investigated and in some
cases intercepted additional Iraqi procurement efforts in several
countries.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and British intelligence sources have said that Iraq has
tried to order from Turkey thousands of atropine auto-injectors used
to combat nerve gas and has attempted to buy enriched uranium from
West Africa, along with aluminum tubes that could be used for uranium
enrichment.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. and the U.S. are also investigating Iraq's attempt to buy
a high-tech Kolchuga radar system from Ukraine through Jordanian
middlemen. A presidential bodyguard reportedly taped the Ukrainian
president authorizing that deal.</TE>
<TE>   There may be more revelations in Iraq's 11,807-page declaration
that only the five permanent Security Council members -- the U.S.,
Britain, China, France and Russia -- are authorized to see. But if
the five have their way, the rest of the world won't hear about them.</TE>

<HD>Chavez Scorns U.S. Call for Early Elections</HD>
<DH>Such a move would break Venezuelan laws, leader insists.
Bush official says possibility of violence should overrule those
concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>President Hugo Chavez on Saturday rejected a White House call for
early elections, as hundreds of thousands of his opponents held a
massive march through this capital.</LD>
<LD>   During a televised interview, Chavez criticized an appeal Friday
by the Bush administration that the country move up elections, saying
the Venezuelan Constitution won't permit a new vote on his rule until
August, halfway through his term, which is scheduled to end in 2007.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't believe that the government of President Bush is telling
the world that Venezuela must violate its constitution," Chavez said
in a separate interview with The Times and other foreign reporters.
"Here no one, no state power has the ability to call early
elections.... What I would recommend is that Washington review our
constitution."</LD>
<TE>   But a U.S. official defended the idea of early elections,
rejecting criticism that it amounted to encouraging the country to
violate its own laws.</TE>
<TE>   The official said a 13-day-old nationwide strike had pushed
Venezuela to the brink of a crisis that could result in violence. A
similar protest in April led to a coup that overthrew Chavez, but he
was restored to power two days later by loyal troops.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not sufficient for the government to sit on institutional
legitimacy when the country is at risk," said the official, who asked
not to be identified. "What we were trying to do was send a very
clear signal that the situation is so desperate and the potential so
grave for confrontation and violence that both sides need to be
prepared to think about this a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela's conflict pits Chavez against a determined array of
opponents, including businesses, unions, dissident military officers
and civic groups.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition wants Chavez to resign or hold new elections within
the first three months of next year. Chavez said that the country
must wait until August to vote on his rule.</TE>
<TE>   The strike has hobbled oil production in the United States'
third-largest oil supplier, cutting daily production from about 3
million barrels to between 500,000 and 700,000. There also have been
gasoline and food shortages, leading to concerns of street riots.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people blocked the main
highway running through central Caracas, in a human flood that waved
yellow-blue-and-red Venezuelan flags, beat drums and called for
Chavez's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez administration officials have responded to the strike by
trying to break it, saying they will import gasoline and pay for
foreign oil workers to run the nation's oil industry. That, in turn,
has led to fears of a prolonged work stoppage that would further
impoverish this already poor country.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time Saturday, the state oil company's top official
recognized that the strike was succeeding in shutting down
production.</TE>
<TE>   "In good measure, it's paralyzed," said Ali Rodriguez, president
of Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA. "The government remains firm,
but the country has been severely punished. If this is the triumph
they want to proclaim, well, it's a sad triumph."</TE>
<TE>   With talks to resolve the impasse stalled, the U.S. last week
stepped up pressure for a resolution, sending Thomas Shannon, a
deputy assistant secretary of State, to Venezuela to meet with the
country's foreign minister and calling for moved-up elections.</TE>
<TE>   That idea hit an especially raw nerve in the Chavez
administration, because the U.S. had appeared to tacitly endorse the
coup in April when it did not immediately condemn his overthrow.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Roy Chaderton, one of the most moderate members
of Chavez's Cabinet, said in an interview Saturday that the White
House didn't have "a full grip of what's going on in my country."</TE>
<TE>   "It was an expression of concern for Venezuela, but we are also
concerned for Venezuelan democracy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chaderton said that before the constitution can be amended, a new
national electoral council must be voted in. The current council is
dominated by opposition members.</TE>
<TE>   "In whatever democracy, if the tribunal is biased, [elections] are
not fair at all," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chaderton also said the government would put on the table a
proposal that the fiercely anti-Chavez media tone down their
confrontational tactics and provide more air time to the government.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela's major television stations and newspapers have been
making little effort to be objective, saying Chavez has forced them
to become a voice for the opposition. Physical attacks against
government supporters often land on the back pages.</TE>
<TE>   The reverse applies to the state-run television networks and radio
stations, which routinely ignore opposition marches and run ads
mocking anti-Chavez protesters.</TE>

<HD>Wrenching Changes Likely With Budget Cuts</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>By now you've heard the bad news: California is confronting a budget
hole of historic proportions, one that will require billions of
dollars in spending cuts, increases in fees and perhaps even higher
taxes.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature will spend much of the year
ahead searching for the least painful ways to pare state spending, as
government revenues plunge.</LD>
<LD>   The grim bottom line:</LD>
<TE>   Over the next 18 months they must produce more than $21 billion in
savings or tax increases or both.</TE>
<TE>   In a first step, Davis recommended $10.2 billion in cuts and
savings earlier this month. On Jan. 10, he will propose a budget for
2003-04.</TE>
<TE>   The politicians and budget experts poised to make these decisions
speak of difficult choices ahead, but their vague warnings fail to
fully convey the changes Californians could see in their daily lives.</TE>
<TE>   Here are snapshots of how key sectors of California society could
be affected by the governor's proposed cuts, even before the
introduction of next year's budget.</TE>
<TE>   Higher Education</TE>
<TE>   Higher fees, fewer classes, and increased competition for a
shrinking number of seats in public colleges and universities are the
likely outcome of Davis' proposal to pare higher education spending
by nearly $350 million. The decisions affecting the four-year
campuses are likely to trickle down to two-year schools, closing the
door to a college education for more California students.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the California State University and the University of
California systems are expected to approve fee increases at board
meetings Monday. Another round of fee hikes could follow next year,
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   CSU is considering raising annual systemwide fees by $144 for
undergraduates and $228 for graduates. Undergraduates currently pay
an average of $1,926 in yearly fees.</TE>
<TE>   UC is considering an annual increase in systemwide fees of $405
for undergraduates and bigger increases for students in law, medicine
and other professional schools. Currently, in-state undergraduates
pay an average of $4,408 in systemwide and campus fees, including
health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Raising fees for the first time since 1994 can forestall
reductions in the number of classes during the current school year,
but the possibility of such reductions looms next fall, when even
deeper cuts are expected to hit state colleges and universities.</TE>
<TE>   "This year is a problem, but next year could be a catastrophe,"
said CSU Chancellor Charles B. Reed in the latest CSU newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   Higher fees at CSU and UC would have a ripple effect, forcing some
students to seek lower-cost education in community colleges. But
community colleges have already been turning students away in recent
months, because they cannot afford to educate everyone who would like
to attend. Davis' proposed cuts, and the higher fees they would
trigger for the four-year colleges, would increase the competition
for community college slots even as the junior colleges would be
likely to further contract.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Community College District, the state's largest,
has reduced enrollment by close to 10,000 from last year to the
current total of roughly 130,000, said Marshall "Mark" Drummond, the
district's chancellor. Enrollment could be slashed by 5,000 more in
the spring term, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the state's other 71 community college districts will
follow suit, education officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Lower Education</TE>
<TE>   Class sizes would probably rise under the governor's proposal to
cut $3.1 billion from public education over the next 18 months,
school administrators say.</TE>
<TE>   School boards are considering furloughs, pay cuts and layoffs that
could apply to teachers, education officials say. A statewide program
to limit classes to 20 students in kindergarten through third grade
could founder.</TE>
<TE>   The giant Los Angeles Unified School District would have to cut
about $140 million -- and that comes on top of $425 million in
reductions earlier this year that forced school administrators to
increase class sizes in the upper grades.</TE>
<TE>   The Pasadena and Long Beach unified school districts have already
frozen hiring. Many districts are planning to suspend purchasing of
supplies, reduce janitorial work, consolidate bus routes or eliminate
administrative positions -- if they haven't already.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to protect classroom programs seen as crucial to
improving student performance, many school districts will have to cut
back on maintenance and to raid operating reserves -- a financially
dangerous tactic.</TE>
<TE>   "My staff is playing the 'Titanic' theme," said Supt. Jim Brown of
the Glendale Unified School District, which stands to lose nearly $5
million out of a $160-million discretionary budget.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation</TE>
<TE>   Davis made reducing California's maddening traffic congestion and
fixing its aging infrastructure a first-term priority as governor.
With the state budget a shambles, the governor will be hard-pressed
to sustain these popular efforts as his second term gets underway
Jan. 6.</TE>
<TE>   The governor borrowed $1.3 billion from the transportation account
in the 2001-02 budget, promising to repay the loan in future years.
Now he is proposing to move $1.8 billion more away from road and rail
improvements. In response, the California Transportation Commission
voted Thursday to freeze funding for most new projects until
February.</TE>
<TE>   The action will affect action on two light rail lines in Los
Angeles County, a downtown L.A. pedestrian improvement project and a
rail cargo upgrade, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California officials are bracing for the worst in the
months ahead: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority fears it
could lose $500 million in the current fiscal year, said MTA analyst
David Yale. Targets could include projects like bus and light rail
lines in the San Fernando Valley and on the Westside, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The six-county Southland region could lose as much as $1 billion
over the next year and a half, said Hasan Ikhrata, transportation
planning manager for the Southern California Assn. of Governments.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the transportation industry could face a devastating
downturn, said Bert Sandman, chairman of Transportation California,
which represents road builders, labor unions, and asphalt and gravel
suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   Which projects will be cut? That will be the subject of fierce
debate in the months ahead as politicians, local government officials
and industry groups try to protect their prizes.</TE>
<TE>   John Dutra, chairman of the state Assembly's transportation
committee, has set the tone for other politicians gearing up to save
popular local projects: Dutra (D-Fremont) says he will oppose any
cuts that would delay construction of a Bay Area Rapid Transit
extension to San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   State Parks</TE>
<TE>   Davis cut park fees two years ago. But most of those reductions
will be wiped out Jan. 1, when sweeping increases go into effect
without legislative approval.</TE>
<TE>   From higher fees at Hearst Castle to steeper charges for access to
camping at the best San Onofre beach spots, Californians will pay
more to take advantage of the state's most popular public treasures,
said state parks spokesman Steve Capps.</TE>
<TE>   Current plans call for day-use fees at state parks to increase to
$5 from $3. Annual day-use passes will increase to $67 from $35.</TE>
<TE>   Basic camping fees will rise to $13 from $12, and campers will now
be charged for extras, such as $5 for a second car. People will have
to pay special charges to camp at so-called premium sites, such as
desirable coastal locations. And boaters will once again have to pay
a $4 launching fee at state-managed boat ramps in such public
waterways as Folsom Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Admission to state museums will generally double in price to $2
for minors and $4 for adults. Special museum sites, including Hearst
Castle, will also charge more. Admission to Hearst Castle will be $12
for adults, an increase of $2, and $6 for minors, a rise of $1.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried not to do this as long as we could," said Capps, noting
that the fees will still be lower than when Davis took office from
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Environment</TE>
<TE>   Davis has proposed tapping voter-approved bonds to pay for some of
the things the shrinking budget was supposed to fund, including
environmental projects.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the administration is proposing to shift the
$25-million cost of a state plan to acquire and restore wetlands at
the Cargill Salt Ponds near San Francisco International Airport to
Proposition 50, a $3.4-billion water bond approved by state voters in
November.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts to environmental programs Davis is proposing pale in
comparison with the hit health care, education and transportation
could take. But that's little consolation to environmental groups,
which fear that oversight of the logging industry and other state
regulatory functions will suffer.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is also proposing to eliminate 31 vacant jobs within the
state Department of Fish and Game, including warden and patrol chief
positions. And he is recommending a reduction of the department's
review of timber harvest plans to gauge their effects on fish and
wildlife, saving roughly $2.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups contend that logging companies should have to
fund the full cost of the plans, including all fish and wildlife
reviews. They say they will urge the administration to consider that
option.</TE>
<TE>   Health Care</TE>
<TE>   The 6.4 million low-income Californians who rely on Medi-Cal for
their health-care needs could confront more paperwork and fewer
benefits under the Davis proposals -- and possibly no coverage at
all.</TE>
<TE>   The governor is asking the Legislature to once again require
families to submit quarterly eligibility reports, which it is
estimated will pare the Medi-Cal rolls by 193,000 people. Some
families will lose their eligibility because their income has
increased and others will fail to return the forms out of
forgetfulness or frustration, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The new requirements could also have the unintended consequence of
denying health coverage to the children of adults who lose Medi-Cal
eligibility, advocates say. Medi-Cal computers may accidentally drop
children when they cut off benefits for their families, or parents
may assume their children are no longer covered, the advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   Other proposed Medi-Cal cuts include tightening eligibility. A
family of four earning $18,000 a year is currently eligible for
coverage, but the Davis plan would lower that to $12,000. Current
patients who file forms on time would be unaffected.</TE>
<TE>   The income limits alone would bar an estimated 185,000 people from
Medi-Cal coverage next year who would be eligible under current
guidelines, said Stan Rosenstein of the state Department of Health
Services.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is also recommending the elimination of Medi-Cal coverage
for dental care, medical supplies, chiropractic services, inpatient
rehabilitation and other so-called optional services. And he is
proposing a 10% cut in Medi-Cal payments to physicians, nursing
homes, pharmacies and other health providers. Hospitals and some
health clinics would be exempted.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, the cuts "will create even greater demand at
community clinics that are already overwhelmed with uninsured
patients," said Mandy Johnson, executive director of the Community
Clinic Assn. of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts fear that the financial crisis already gripping the
overwhelmed Los Angeles County health-care network could spread
across the state.</TE>
<TE>   Social Services</TE>
<TE>   Davis is proposing about $2 billion in cuts from health and
welfare programs for low-income Californians, and many of the
programs curtailed or abolished would directly affect children and
senior citizens. Almost half the savings, for example, would come
from eliminating a $98-million program that provides subsidized child
care to former welfare recipients."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the governor's proposal, charitable groups were
gearing up for new demands in January, when the state's
welfare-to-work program begins cutting cash assistance to an
estimated 100,000 welfare recipients who have reached a federal
five-year limit on aid. Many are employed, but most still will fall
below the federal poverty line, advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   Other Davis proposals include cuts in the Department of Aging that
would save $2.5 million in the current fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would eliminate funding for several popular services,
including the Brown Bag Program, the Senior Companion Program, the
Foster Grandparent Program and the Respite Registry Program --
offerings that serve more than 50,000 seniors statewide, said
officials.</TE>
<TE>   For seniors already hard hit by the falling stock market and
reduced pensions, the cuts represent "an incredible erosion in basic
quality of life," said Anne Burns Johnson, president of the
California Assn. of Homes and Services for the Aging.</TE>

<LD>More than a year after anthrax killed two workers in the main
mail-handling center of the nation's capital, U.S. Postal Service
crews began fumigating the building with a toxic gas.</LD>
<LD>   The 17.5 million-cubic-foot Brentwood facility has been closed
since October 2001, after anthrax-laced letters to two senators were
determined to have been processed there and the two postal workers
died.</LD>
<LD>   Chlorine dioxide gas was to be pumped into the building until
today. After follow-up monitoring, postal workers could be back in
the facility by late April, officials said.</LD>

<DL>STOREY COUNTY, Nev.</DL>
<LD>They came for one last transaction at the infamous Mustang Ranch
brothel, and unlike previous customers, they were allowed to take
their purchases home.</LD>
<LD>   Barstools and tables. Souvenir T-shirts. Bottles of wine bearing a
Mustang Ranch label. Drawings of nudes. Even computers and credit

<LD>   The federal government on Saturday auctioned off the remains of
Nevada's oldest bordello, seized after its owner ran up a $13-million
tax debt, leaving the landmark pink stucco building and its adjoining
annex empty except for the ghosts of pleasures -- or sins -- past.</LD>
<TE>   "Let's start the bidding on these keys," auctioneer Sean Fraley
said as government accountants stood by, tallying up the take. "You
can buy the keys to this joint." They went for $170.</TE>
<TE>   The days of negotiating prices downward at the brothel were long
gone as Fraley pushed the bidding upward before banging his gavel and
closing one deal after another.</TE>
<TE>   On an impulse, retired airline pilot George Howell bought the
parlor's 3-foot disco ball for $350. He intends to hang it in his
private hangar in Rolla, Mo. "I've flown out of Reno for years and
have always heard about the Mustang Ranch. I think the disco ball
would be fun to hang above my airplane."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Payne, a local electrician, paid $200 for 10 Mustang Ranch
"pleasure menus."</TE>
<TE>   "They'll make great Christmas gifts. Maybe we'll put one above the
bed," said his wife, Ronna. "He can always wish."</TE>
<TE>   Another bidder paid $1,000 for 10,000 matchbooks, which he hopes
to sell on e-Bay. "Don't use my name," he pleaded. "People back home
will think I'm crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Already taken to a trash bin were the bed mattresses, which
officials deemed would be in poor taste -- and possible violation of
health codes -- to sell to the public, no matter what stories they
could tell.</TE>
<TE>   Auction proceeds -- about $610,000, including bids on four land
parcels -- will go to the Treasury Department's Asset Forfeiture Fund
to pay for law enforcement equipment. The land will be turned over to
the Bureau of Land Management, which is debating uses for it.</TE>
<TE>   In its heyday, the Mustang Ranch, about 15 miles east of Reno,
kept as many as 100 women busy in a single evening as one of nearly
30 houses of legal prostitution in rural Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Onetime cabdriver Joseph Conforte launched his first brothel in
1955, only to have it burned to the ground by local authorities after
it was deemed a public nuisance.</TE>
<TE>   He purchased the Mustang Ranch in 1967 and found legitimacy when
Storey County legalized brothels four years later. State law allows
rural counties to regulate brothels -- a legacy of Nevada's mining
and railroad construction camps. Nevada's other 12 rural counties
soon followed suit, coveting them as a source of much-needed
business-license revenue.</TE>
<TE>   But throughout his ownership, the cigar-chomping Conforte faced
income tax evasion, racketeering, bankruptcy fraud and other charges
-- even as he donated 1,000 turkeys to the poor every year and gave
free brothel passes to returning Desert Storm troops. The government
took the brothel in 1990 after he failed to pay a $13-million tax
debt and fled to Brazil, which has no extradition pact with the U.S.
The IRS auctioned the Mustang Ranch in 1990 -- and Conforte bought it
through a network of bogus companies and Swiss bank accounts fattened
by profits his associates skimmed from the Mustang's books.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the government again seized the property and its
assets, and closed the business for good, leading to Saturday's
auction.</TE>
<TE>   Among the bidders were the owners of two nearby brothels.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Hof, owner of Moonlite Bunny Ranch, spent about $23,000 on
everything from memorabilia for his brothel museum to nine burgundy
sofas and two ATMs. "I'm preserving American history," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among Lance Gillman's purchases were 32 plastic chairs ($35) and
300 bottles of premium liquor ($1,500) to equip his new Wild Horse
brothel. "What better place to shop if you're setting up your own
brothel," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Criminal activities notwithstanding, local authorities say they
will miss the revenue produced by the Mustang Ranch -- $300,000 a
year in sales taxes, room taxes and other sources.</TE>
<TE>   Storey County government won't be alone in missing the Mustang
Ranch. "At Christmastime, when there were local gift drives, or when
the local schools had needs they couldn't afford, people would make
just one phone call to Conforte and they were taken care of," County
Commissioner Greg Hess said.</TE>
<TE>   But there was no point in his buying any Mustang merchandise at
the auction. "I'm not sure my wife would let me put any of the
memorabilia in our house," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The fate of the two brothel buildings, an old stone ranch house
and the 340-acre site itself, remains unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   The land is expected to be transferred by the Treasury Department
to the BLM, which is debating what to do with it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's located in flood plain along the Truckee River, and we would
love to give the river more twists and turns through the property to
promote the growth of cottonwoods and willows," BLM spokesman Mark
Struble said. "If the area is enhanced, it could be a blooming trout
stream, an excellent place for fishing, picnicking and camping -- a
great place for families."</TE>
<TE>   Several groups have asked to use the buildings, "but we may just
let the fire department burn them for a drill," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The BLM, which also manages land surrounding the Mustang,
considered using it as a holding pen for the wild mustang horses it
collects from Nevada's open ranges, but decided against it because
equestrian effluent would pollute the river.</TE>
<TE>   Other ideas are coming in from the public, Struble said. One
person recommended it as a shooting range, another as a long-term
health-care facility.</TE>
<TE>   "One person suggested we turn it into a shelter for battered
women," Struble said. "Now that would be ironic."</TE>

<HD>Bush Circumventing Congress on Domestic Policy</HD>
<DH>His goals such as advancing the faith-based initiative
cheer his core constituency. He looks to broaden GOP's appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Seeking to reinforce support from his core constituency, while at the
same time possibly widening the Republican Party's appeal, President
Bush is sidestepping Congress to advance the domestic policy issues
he brought to the White House two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Though the potential war with Iraq and hoped-for improvement of
the economy are likely to be the most important elements determining
Bush's political future, the domestic issues are the ones that are
important to the president's longtime backers -- and that have come
to a stalemate in Congress.</LD>
<LD>   So, finding ways to act without requiring congressional approval,
Bush moved last week on one of those programs, his faith-based
initiative. Using his executive powers, the president ordered the
government to make it easier for religious organizations to win
government funds for charitable projects.</LD>
<TE>   The program has been stalled in Congress, and Bush's order did not
put it fully into effect. For instance, congressional approval still
will be required for tax incentives to spur private charitable
contributions for religious groups that deliver social services.</TE>
<TE>   But with Bush's action, federal agencies cannot discriminate
against religious-based charities in awarding federal grants and can
allow federal dollars to go to social service agencies that use an
applicant's religion as a factor in deciding whom to hire.</TE>
<TE>   On the environmental front, where Bush also has run into
roadblocks in Congress, he has taken several steps in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   He implemented a policy to increase logging in national forests,
enacting through orders he sent to the U.S. Forest Service key
elements of a program that has languished in Congress since last
summer. He has given industry a long-desired increase in its
flexibility in dealing with federal clean-air requirements, bringing
applause from the forestry products sector.</TE>
<TE>   He also proposed a slight increase in fuel economy ratings for
sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks -- a step the government has
not taken in six years. Environmentalists called it insufficient;
automakers said it would be difficult to do.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Bush was ready to
act on "a very aggressive" domestic policy agenda in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   However, on many pending issues, Bush's ability to act on his own
will be more limited. And they are likely to engender at least as
much controversy, even when the Republican Congress takes office next
month.</TE>
<TE>   These include a program to help the elderly pay for prescription
drugs and reworking the 1996 welfare laws to increase the amount of
time welfare recipients must spend at work or in job-training
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Further off are questions about how Social Security will meet the
demands on its trust fund over the next decade, when baby boomers
begin to retire in huge numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Few expect this critical issue will be resolved during the current
presidential term, given the deep divisions over whether to introduce
private investments into the federal retirement system.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have asked whether -- between the overseas pressures of
diplomacy, the military buildup in the Persian Gulf and the demands
of economy at home -- the White House will have the political energy
to carry out anything more than a limited domestic policy agenda in
2003.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said that in addition to the costs of prescription drugs
and remaining elements of the faith-based initiative, the
administration's domestic agenda will include pursuing a ban on
cloning, pension protections and drilling for oil in the Alaska
National Wildlife Refuge.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, expressing keen interest in energy legislation, said in
Shreveport, La., this month that "an energy bill is good for our job
base, it's good for economic security, and it's good for national
security."</TE>
<TE>   And the president frequently calls for legislation that would make
permanent the $1.35-trillion, 10-year tax cut that he signed in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   His domestic policy list is not extensive. But, said Bruce Reed,
who was chief of the Domestic Policy Council at the White House
during the Clinton administration, it might still be difficult to
achieve.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions with Iraq demand the president's attention and budget
woes remain unresolved. So, Reed said, "social policy is inevitably
going to be shoved aside because there isn't enough oxygen in the
public debate" to support discussion of domestic issues.</TE>
<TE>   But, arguing that the president needs to demonstrate domestic
policy achievements if he runs for reelection, Thomas E. Mann, an
expert on Congress and the presidency at the Brookings Institution in
Washington, said, "It would be a tremendous mistake if we failed to
see the link to 2004."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, he said, domestic policy is "moving up, rather than
being crowded out."</TE>
<TE>   The issue considered most ripe for action is the cost of
prescription drugs for the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   It was a topic of frequent debate during the presidential campaign
in 2000 and grew in intensity during the congressional campaign this
autumn.</TE>
<TE>   The question, of course, is how to pay for any assistance that
Medicare would provide.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to see how the outlook for social spending is
auspicious," said Peter R. Orszag, who served as a special assistant
for economic policy under President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   While domestic policy issues only rise to the level at which they
begin to have an effect on presidential elections when the economy is
unusually strong and national security concerns are well below the
surface of public debate, they motivate particular groups of voters.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the faith-based initiative.</TE>
<TE>   The president's decision drew criticism from the American Civil
Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and
State, a Washington-based advocacy group opposed to erosion of the
constitutional barrier between church and state.</TE>
<TE>   But in working around the House and the Senate, Bush cheered
religious groups, including those with large numbers of minorities
who perform extensive charitable work, and took actions that appeal
to his core supporters among Republican conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting that approval, Stephen Lazarus, a policy analyst at the
Center for Public Justice, a Washington-based organization that has
long advocated greater opportunities for religious groups to tap
federal funds, said that with Bush's action, religious groups' social
service programs would not have to be "religion-free zones when they
work with the government."</TE>
<TE>   The president unveiled his executive order establishing the
program before a racially diverse audience of religious leaders in
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   The applause he received throughout his remarks suggested progress
in his effort to broaden the Republican coalition by reaching out to
blacks, Latinos and Roman Catholics.</TE>

<HD>Cardinal Law Out, Boston Speculates on Replacement</HD>
<DH>Catholic insiders see front-runners, but Vatican and
archdiocese priorities may differ.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer and Geraldine Baum</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>On a dismal morning here Saturday, the momentous transfer of power
from Cardinal Bernard Law to a temporary overseer of the Roman
Catholic Archdiocese of Boston was acknowledged in a prayerful
entreaty as routine as rain.</LD>
<LD>   Standing in a chapel of the stately Cathedral of the Holy Cross,
Father Robert Carr prayed for Pope John Paul II and "Richard, our
bishop," referring to the Most Rev. Richard G. Lennon, who will head
the archdiocese until a new archbishop is named.</LD>
<LD>   Gone from the liturgy was any mention of Law, the once powerful
cardinal who resigned Friday after a year of an unrelenting sexual
abuse scandal that has driven the archdiocese to consider filing for
bankruptcy. After the liturgy, Carr asked the congregation to pray
for Law.</LD>
<TE>   Lennon, 55, who was ordained as one of Law's auxiliary bishops
only a year and half ago, found himself Friday as John Paul's
"apostolic administrator" of a battered and shaken Boston
Archdiocese. He will serve in that position until the pope appoints a
permanent replacement for Law.</TE>
<TE>   This is a time of transition in the 2-million-member Boston
Archdiocese, even as criminal investigations and sexual abuse
lawsuits against priests continue to pummel the church like the
driving rain outside the cathedral on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Catholics and non-Catholics alike are looking to brighter days
ahead that they hope will come with a new archbishop. The appointment
also will have national and global implications because the Boston
Archdiocese has long been one of America's most important Catholic
sees. In addition, Boston archbishops have traditionally been made
cardinals; cardinals elect the pope.</TE>
<TE>   Already, two bishops are on a short list, church insiders say.
They are Bishop Wilton D. Gregory of Belleville, Ill., and Archbishop
Harry J. Flynn of St. Paul-Minneapolis. Both have been in the
forefront of efforts by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to
fashion a mandatory "zero tolerance" sexual abuse prevention policy.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory, 55, is better known as chairman of the U.S. bishops
conference. Flynn, 69, was chairman of the conference's ad hoc sexual
abuse committee. Both addressed sexual abuse in their own dioceses
early on, with openness and firmness.</TE>
<TE>   Other bishops are being mentioned as well, including Archbishop
Charles J. Chaput, 58, of Denver; Archbishop Edwin F. O'Brien of the
church's military diocese; Bishop Donald W. Wuerl, 62, of Pittsburgh;
Bishop William E. Lori of Bridgeport, Conn.; and Bishop Thomas G.
Doran of Rockford, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some rank-and-file Catholics in Boston hope the pope
will name one of their own. "I hope it will be a priest of the
Archdiocese of Boston," said Thomas Groome, a professor of religious
education at Boston College and author of "What Makes Us Catholic."
"That's been the old tradition of the church, and it's a good
tradition. I hope it's not an import."</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, say the last thing the archdiocese needs is an
insider.</TE>
<TE>   Church insiders caution that it is good to keep in mind a church
axiom about the election of popes by cardinals behind the closed
doors in the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City.</TE>
<TE>   "A cardinal who goes in as a pope comes out a cardinal," the
saying goes. Much the same might be said about "front runners" for
the Boston Archdiocese. But that isn't stopping the speculation.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever is chosen, their talents, temperaments and track record
will be closely scrutinized. "You can bet the minute a successor is
named, we'll read about every overdue library book he's ever had,"
said David Clohessy, national director of the Survivors Network of
Those Abused by Priests.</TE>
<TE>   Father Thomas Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine America, said
Law's successor must have "instant credibility" with Boston's public,
priests and media as being able to handle the sexual abuse crisis
"quickly and correctly."</TE>
<TE>   But while the focus in Boston and, indeed, the U.S. Roman Catholic
Church has been on sexual abuse, that will probably not rank highest
among John Paul's concerns in choosing Law's successor, if history is
a guide. He has appointed priests whom he views as being
theologically orthodox, activist on social justice issues and
conservative when it comes to hot-button issues such as the
ordination of women and making celibacy optional.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be naive to think he [the new archbishop] won't be
equally conservative as Law," said Father Thomas McBrien, a liberal
Catholic commentator and professor of theology at the University of
Notre Dame. "He will be a conservative, a company man, a Vatican
loyalist and someone the priests and laity of Boston will soon find
out is no more open to questions of concern to them."</TE>
<TE>   Conservative Catholic author George Weigel, who wrote a
comprehensive biography of John Paul, said whoever is appointed will
be faced with restoring fidelity to Catholic moral teaching.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems clear that there are deep, decades-long problems with
the clerical culture of Boston, and the new man has got to have
experience in reforming priestly life and challenging priests to be
what they are by ordination -- icons of the eternal priesthood of
Christ," Weigel said. "In other words, Boston needs a vibrant,
compelling, experienced, orthodox leader."</TE>
<TE>   But on the street outside the cathedral here Saturday, two church
members -- a nun and a mother who brought her seventh-grade son to
take an entrance exam at the cathedral high school -- had their own
ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Sister Madeline Gallagher, who has worked for years here with
immigrants in Catholic education, said she was rooting for "the black
man" -- she couldn't remember his name. "I was just impressed with
his fairness and his manner approaching the people," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She was referring to Gregory. Gallagher might not have read in the
Boston Globe that Gregory was considered a long-shot. She had watched
Gregory on television. "The way he responded was with great respect,
yet he was firm with the reporters," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rafaela Cruz, who brought her son to the school, said she was glad
Law was gone. "Whoever comes in next has to deal with all the lying
and the cover-up," she said, "and make it easier for the good people
of the church, like the teachers, to do their work."</TE>

<HD>Illinois' Exonerated to Urge Clemency for All on Death Row</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Slater</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>As Republican Gov. George Ryan considers commuting some, possibly
all, death sentences in Illinois to life terms before he leaves
office in mid-January, about 40 former death row inmates who were
wrongfully convicted plan to meet here today and Monday to urge him
to spare the lives of all 160 condemned prisoners.</LD>
<LD>   The exonerated will not argue that the death penalty should be
abolished on moral or philosophical grounds, or even suggest that it
may not deter crime. Rather, they will emphasize what Ryan himself
has said: The system is so flawed, it cannot be trusted. Holding
themselves up as examples, they hope, will prove powerful evidence of
systemic failure.</LD>
<LD>   Anthony Porter plans to be there. He spent 16 years on Illinois'
death row for two murders he did not commit, at one point being
fitted for his burial suit and coming within two days of execution.
Gary Gauger plans to attend too. He was convicted in 1994 of
murdering his elderly parents and spent 33 months on death row before
two motorcycle gang members were accused and later convicted of the
slayings.</LD>
<TE>   "I was lucky," Gauger, 50, said. "That's such an absurd thing to
say, but I was very lucky. Many people helped me. I feel I should
help others. There's no doubt in my mind there are other innocent
people on death row."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan and his aides on the death penalty issue also believe there
may still be some innocent people among the condemned.</TE>
<TE>   The two-day gathering is being organized at Northwestern
University School of Law by the Center on Wrongful Convictions, a
collection of lawyers, teachers and students that in just a few years
has uncovered numerous wrongful convictions and become perhaps the
nation's most influential anti-death penalty group.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, the center's mission is not to oppose the death
penalty but to exonerate those wrongfully convicted. Having helped
free several Illinois inmates, however, the group now argues that
regardless of how one feels about death as punishment, the systems
now in place in the United States cannot guarantee that innocent
people will not die.</TE>
<TE>   "Even after I began to work on the Anthony Porter case, I thought
he was guilty," said Lawrence C. Marshall, the center's legal
director. "I was wrong. The system has proven itself to be wrong time
and again."</TE>
<TE>   A group of Northwestern journalism students, performing fairly
basic detective work, helped exonerate Porter after they tracked down
the real killer in the 1982 murders. Alstory Simon, who was living in
Milwaukee, confessed on videotape to shooting 19-year-old Marilyn
Green and 18-year-old Jerry Hillard, and has since been sentenced to
37 1/2 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The gathering will begin today at the law school, with remarks by
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and attorney Barry Scheck of the Innocence
Project at New York's Cardozo School of Law.</TE>
<TE>   Monday morning, Gauger will begin walking from Stateville
Penitentiary in Joliet, where many of Illinois' executions have been
carried out, with a letter urging Ryan to grant clemency to all
Illinois death row inmates. The letter will be handed off to some of
the other 102 death row inmates from across the country who have been
exonerated, making its way 37 miles to Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday night, the center will stage "The Exonerated," with
actor Mike Farrell playing Gauger, Danny Glover playing Delbert
Tibbs, who spent five years on Florida's death row for a murder he
did not commit, and other Hollywood notables.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan is expected to attend, watching with just a month left to
decide whether to commute the sentences of all 160 death row inmates,
commute some of them or leave the decision to Gov.-elect Rod
Blagojevich.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Ryan announced a state moratorium on executions following
a string of exonerations. The groundbreaking move has since been
followed by Maryland, and other states are considering such action.</TE>
<TE>   Since Illinois reinstated capital punishment in 1977, 12 men had
been executed and 13 death row inmates had been exonerated. At
clemency hearings for most of the inmates held over the summer,
victims' families lambasted Ryan for even considering clemency.</TE>
<TE>   Following the outcry, Ryan said he probably would not grant a
blanket clemency. Since then, however, Ryan has said repeatedly that
no one who was convicted by such a flawed system should die by it.</TE>
<TE>   "He can't condemn the system and then allow potentially innocent
people to be executed," said Rob Warden, executive director of the
Center on Wrongful Convictions. "All this would have been for
nothing."</TE>

<HD>GOP Fears Lott's Miscue Is a Setback for Party</HD>
<DH>Embarrassed, many Republicans worry remarks undercut effort
to shed all-white image.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Things had been looking up for Republicans who want their party to
seem more welcoming to minorities.</LD>
<LD>   Sens. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina, emblems of a GOP generation with roots in the segregated
South, are retiring. President Bush has continued to work hard to
appeal to Latino voters. And he has been preaching racial tolerance
with new eloquence since last year's terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Then along comes Senate GOP leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, who
in a single unguarded moment ripped open racial divisions many
Republicans had hoped to leave behind.</LD>
<TE>   Lott's comments at Thurmond's 100th birthday party Dec. 5 praising
the senator's 1948 presidential campaign, which was explicitly based
on support for segregation, caused Republicans to cringe not just out
of embarrassment but because they feared the remarks would undercut
the party's efforts to shed its image as an all-white club.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly does not enhance or assist Republican efforts to
broaden the base," Sen. Charles Hagel of Nebraska said.</TE>
<TE>   As Lott's remarks were publicized widely, he apologized
repeatedly, saying he didn't intend them as an endorsement of
segregation. At a Friday news conference in Mississippi, he offered
his most extensive explanation, saying he was "winging it" with
impromptu comments at Thurmond's party and misspoke.</TE>
<TE>   "In celebrating [Thurmond's] life, I did not mean to suggest in
any way that his segregationist views of 50 years ago were justified
or right," Lott said. "Segregation was immoral then and it is wrong
now."</TE>
<TE>   But critics in both parties say that, despite his contrition,
Lott's initial remarks indicate an insensitivity to the South's
legacy of institutionalized racism and the painful struggle to
overcome it.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy's effects have been intensified because it struck
many as so anachronistic in contemporary politics. While racism
remains alive and well -- and in some communities, a potent political
force -- analysts say it is increasingly rare for national
politicians to make comments that can be seen as racist.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the contemporary Republicans, starting with President
Bush as the role model, bend over backward not to go anywhere near
the terrain Trent Lott was evoking," said Earl Black, an expert on
Southern politics at Rice University in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "What Lott is doing is pretty rare these days for Republican
candidates."</TE>
<TE>   The emotional reaction to Lott's comments -- by Democrats and
Republican critics alike -- underscores how much race remains a
festering sore in the country's political life.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no longer the old blatant racism of the old Southern
demagogue, but you cannot say race has evaporated as a factor in
Southern politics," said University of North Carolina political
analyst Ferrel Guillory. "Lott has reminded us that we've got to be
mindful of our history, and there's still some history to overcome."</TE>
<TE>   The governor's contest in Georgia this year was a reminder of the
political potency of racial appeals. One factor that figured in the
surprising defeat of Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes was a backlash
against his efforts to remove the Confederate emblem from the state
flag.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the South, racial tensions also affected the Michigan
gubernatorial race. Jennifer Granholm, the Democratic candidate and
eventual winner, was criticized for supporting reparations for
slavery -- and accused of favoritism toward Detroit, a predominantly
black city. The National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People
responded that such attacks smacked of race-baiting.</TE>
<TE>   Still, none of this year's campaigns was as overtly pitched to
racial themes as those conducted by many Southern Republicans in the
1960s and 1970s. That strategy rejuvenated the GOP in a region where
it had been virtually nonexistent for almost a century because of its
identification as "the party of Lincoln" and where Democratic
candidates had promoted the politics of racism.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Helms' campaign against a black Democrat ran an ad
playing to white resentment of blacks' advancement through
affirmative action. It featured a pair of white hands crumpling a job
rejection letter. But that type of message increasingly has become
the exception.</TE>
<TE>   "Times are different and moderate middle-class voters don't want
their politicians to be like the Old South," Guillory said.</TE>
<TE>   In the years since the Helms ad, racial themes have been invoked
more obliquely. For example, even in debates about the Confederate
flag, Black said, proponents tend to talk about the emblem as a form
of Southern heritage, not of explicit racial symbolism.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats say such strategies represent an effort by
Republicans to have it both ways -- to signal sympathy with Southern
conservatives without alienating Northern and suburban moderates who
are crucial to their governing coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "Many Southern Republicans have played a coy wink-and-nod game on
racial issues, eschewing the racist past but making it clear in a
thousand ways to white voters that they weren't that happy about
having to toe the politically correct line on civil rights," said a
statement concerning the Lott controversy from the centrist
Democratic Leadership Council.</TE>
<TE>   Even Bush, who has made a bigger effort to court minority voters
than most Republicans at the presidential level, has been embarrassed
in the course of trying to appeal to the disparate parts of the GOP
base. During the 2000 presidential primaries, he sought Southern
conservative votes by speaking at Bob Jones University in South
Carolina -- an institution that had banned interracial dating. Under
criticism for the appearance, Bush was reduced to saying, "I don't
like being called a bigot."</TE>
<TE>   Bush has sprinkled his Cabinet and the top ranks of his
administration with minorities.</TE>
<TE>   White House political director Ken Mehlman said he believes Bush's
effort to make the GOP more welcoming to minorities is paying off --
at least among Latinos. He said many GOP candidates increased their
share of the Latino vote in last month's midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said there is no strong evidence
of a real Latino swing to the GOP. But, he added, "There is a
long-term struggle for the loyalty of Latinos, and it is a battle
where we have not yet achieved final victory."</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans say they believe the political damage inflicted
by the Lott controversy will be limited because Bush has far more
power than the Senate Republican leader in defining the face of the
party.</TE>
<TE>   "The public perception of the Republican Party is going to be
driven by President Bush and not Sen. Lott," said Whit Ayres, a GOP
pollster based in Atlanta. "President Bush, especially since 9/11,
has been very aggressive in promoting tolerance of racial and
religious minorities, and that will be the lasting impression of
Republicans in the early part of this decade."</TE>

<HD>More Young Students Suspended</HD>
<DH>Some officials say action against kindergartners is
necessary to stem violence. A study questions the effect and fairness
of the practice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>One hit a pregnant teacher, another exposed himself and another
stabbed a classmate with a pencil.</LD>
<LD>   They've all been suspended from school this year. And they're all
kindergartners.</LD>
<LD>   In the first four months under new schools chief Paul Vallas, 33
kindergartners have been suspended from Philadelphia public schools,
up from just one during the same period last year.</LD>
<TE>   "The goal is to get the parents in," said Gwen Morris, who
oversees alternative education for the 200,000-student district.
"What it says is: We have a uniform policy that everyone will be held
to."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Education does not break down school
suspensions by grade level, but several researchers said they see
anecdotal evidence that the youngest schoolchildren are being
suspended more frequently.</TE>
<TE>   Morris believes suspensions, combined with counseling and other
measures, are an effective tool in the city's crackdown on school
violence. None of the kindergartners has been suspended a second
time, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The time they spend at home together is clearly a time for them
to figure out why this is happening," Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Gilliam, a child psychologist at Yale University's Child
Study Center, said he doubts that young children make the connection
between an action in school and the ensuing suspension, which can
last as long as 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten days is a lifetime to a 3-, 4- or 5-year-old," said Gilliam,
who is working on a study of preschooler suspensions. "They can't
even fathom 10 days. It's like waiting for Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a bad move, because it absolves the school from
feeling that it's necessary to deal with that problem within the
school building. You push it out to the community, you push it out to
the family home, and that's where it started to begin with," Gilliam
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gilliam is studying suspensions in Connecticut, where 311
kindergartners were suspended in 1999-2000, about 92% of them
out-of-school suspensions.</TE>
<TE>   Gilliam said 79% of Connecticut's kindergarten suspensions went to
boys, and about half involved allegations of physical violence,
sexual harassment or verbal threats.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 52% of the suspensions went to black kindergartners, 35.2%
to Latinos and 12.1% to whites, he said. "Those percentages do not
match the demographics of Connecticut," Gilliam said, echoing
criticism from the Rev. Jesse Jackson and others that zero-tolerance
policies and other disciplinary codes are disproportionately applied
to minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Connecticut kindergartners, three-quarters of the
suspensions went to students from the lowest socioeconomic rung,
Gilliam said.</TE>
<TE>   That suggests to Peg Oliveira of Connecticut Voices for Children
that low-income students are not getting high-quality preschool.</TE>
<TE>   "The pre-kindergarten experience probably isn't preparing them for
what they need to do before they get to kindergarten," said Oliveira,
whose child-advocacy group has researched the issue.</TE>

<HD>The Liberals on the March in Spokane</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER H. KING</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SPOKANE, Wash.</DL>
<LD>They came marching up Main Street behind a blue banner covered with
the word "peace" in many languages. There were at most 150 of them,
and the carols they sang as they shuffled through downtown often were
drowned out by the din of passing traffic.</LD>
<LD>   The turnout was only about half what the march organizers had
anticipated. They blamed the weather. Earlier in the day, Spokane had
received its first snow of the season, and now it was raining -- a
cold drizzle that snuffed out the little candles the marchers
carried.</LD>
<LD>   This was last Tuesday evening. The sidewalk procession was one of
more than 100 peace demonstrations across the nation. By virtue of
some backward logic, I had come looking, not for opponents, but for
supporters of a preemptive invasion of Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Since people wary about war keep popping up in unlikely places --
the Petroleum Club of Midland, Texas, and at the very edge of ground
zero in Manhattan -- it seemed to follow that a peace march might
flush out some hawks.</TE>
<TE>   So I followed along, studying the reactions of people in the path
of the march. There weren't many to study. Downtown Spokane on a wet
Tuesday night in December, it soon became clear, does not offer much
in the way of a throbbing street life.</TE>
<TE>   In the second block, though, a man neatly dressed in a blazer and
tie emerged from a brick building just as the front edge of the
procession arrived. The protesters were singing "Hark the Herald
Angels Sing" and carrying the usual signs: "No Blood for Oil," "No
U.S. Global Domination" and the like.</TE>
<TE>   This man, a 43-year-old consultant from Portland, Ore., named
David Newhouse, leaned against a wall and watched, wearing an
expression I mistook at first for a bemused smirk.</TE>
<TE>   So what did he think about it all?</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's refreshing," he said. "It's refreshing to see people
come out and say something that is not the party line. Since Sept. 11
it seems like everybody in this country is jumping on the bandwagon
and not saying anything about the fact that our U.S. foreign policy
has a lot to do with how much they hate us in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   Newhouse, who had been on his way to dinner, stayed until the last
straggler was gone, seemingly fascinated by the scene. Spokane, he
noted, had a reputation in the Pacific Northwest for being "fairly
redneck. And so to see a peace rally here on a cold and rainy weekday
night is really great. Amazing."</TE>
<TE>   The marchers, as one of the organizers put it, had the look of
"the usual suspects." There were a few young parents who carried
toddlers in backpacks. There were a few teenagers. Most, however,
were older folks, some as long in hair as they were in years.</TE>
<TE>   "Greenpeace people" is how Aaron MacDonald described them. "You
know what they are going to say without even having to ask them."</TE>
<TE>   He was standing beneath the eaves of a bank building where he
works as a maintenance supervisor. He was 29 years old, tall, with
short hair and a lean face. He wore a cowboy-looking duster and a
backward baseball cap. He would not be mistaken for a Greenpeace
person.</TE>
<TE>   And yet ...</TE>
<TE>   "How do I feel about the war?" he said, repeating the first
question. "You mean, whether we should invade or not? I think no. Not
unless there is an absolute threat, we shouldn't go in there. The
Soviet Union had 40,000 missiles aimed at us and we never invaded
them. I think we only pick on people weaker than us.</TE>
<TE>   "And," he added, to make the record clear, "I don't consider
myself a liberal, even."</TE>
<TE>   We talked about the polls, and the numbers they produce indicating
strong support for the war. That's not what he'd encountered. Most
people he knew didn't talk about the war much, but those who did were
ambivalent at best.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anybody," MacDonald said, "who is gung-ho about it."</TE>
<TE>   He remembered the Gulf War, a decade earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "It was different in '91," he said. "In '91 I was living down in
Long Beach and on this one corner there were about 60 protesters out
every day. People were always pulling off the road and going over and
telling the protesters that they were wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't see that here," he said, nodding toward the marchers.
"You don't see anybody hassling them at all."</TE>
<TE>   The march covered eight blocks, moving past pawnbrokers,
department stores, family restaurants. Shoppers tended to give the
procession a glance and then slip into the next store. The diners
rarely noticed the passing parade. At the public library, three
shaggy fellows pointed and gawked from a third-floor window. Here and
there a motorist honked. That was about it for unsolicited public
reaction.</TE>
<TE>   At the federal courthouse, the march paused and a speech from an
old-timer began. MacDonald, I noticed, had trailed along. He stood at
the edge of the crowd, keeping his distance, but listening. As the
address dragged on -- "Let's move to Article 15: Everybody has the
right to freedom of thought ... " -- he finally drifted away.</TE>
<TE>   The rain was falling harder now. The walk back to the starting
point was done almost at a dogtrot, with some marchers beginning to
peel off along the way. Most of them, though, held ranks and kept up
with their caroling.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway back they encountered big James Holybee, 64, a retired
carpenter dressed for the rain in a hooded yellow slicker. Despite
the hood, raindrops kept splattering against his horn-rim glasses. He
moved haltingly with a cane.</TE>
<TE>   He had come to Main Street to pay a bill, but the protesters were
blocking his path to the mailbox.</TE>
<TE>   The marchers were singing "Silent Night."</TE>
<TE>   He yelled at them.</TE>
<TE>   "To hell with regime change, that's what I say."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't mean he was against the war. He just didn't want any
euphemistic dilly-dallying around.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq is nothing but a terrorist regime," he said, "and all Saddam
wants is to take over the world and destroy it. We should have taken
him out the first time, I will say that. He's a murderous terrorist."</TE>
<TE>   How did he think the war would go?</TE>
<TE>   "If we go over there and hit them hard," he said, "we could get
him out of there soon enough."</TE>
<TE>   What did he think of the peace march?</TE>
<TE>   "Not much," Holybee said flatly. "I don't approve of it. I'm a
conservative and a Republican. I am not a liberal."</TE>
<TE>   He ticked off the names of half a dozen conservative talk radio
shows and suggested anyone truly interested in what Americans think
about this war business should give them a listen.</TE>
<TE>   The last few marchers were moving past, singing "Joy to the
World."</TE>
<TE>   "Get rid of Saddam," Holybee shouted at them, waving his cane as
if to shoo them along.</TE>
<TE>   And then he made his way to the mailbox, deposited his bill
payment and limped into the night.</TE>

<HD>Man Is Fined $2.5 Million for Looting Key Archeological
Site</HD>
<DH>More than 2,000 artifacts, including 10,000-year-old
sandals, were taken from an American Indian cave.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RENO, Nev.</DL>
<LD>A man who federal officials say spoiled a major archeological find
when he looted ancient American Indian remains from a Nevada cave in
the 1980s has been fined $2.5 million in civil penalties.</LD>
<LD>   Jack Lee Harelson destroyed what could have been one of the most
important archeological cave sites in the Great Basin, Bureau of Land
Management officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Before Elephant Mountain Cave was looted over several years in the
early 1980s, it contained a 10,000-year record of human life in
northern Nevada, including artifacts from the Paiute tribe. The site
is in the Black Rock Desert, 140 miles north of Reno.</LD>
<TE>   "The desecration and loss of this site to all Americans is
staggering," said Bob Abbey, Nevada state director of the BLM. "While
we are pleased the judge ruled completely in BLM's favor, money can't
bring back what was lost."</TE>
<TE>   Harelson, of Grants Pass, Ore., maintained his innocence and
laughed when asked whether he would pay the fine.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm on Social Security and crippled, yeah, right," he said. "The
federal government knew that I had nothing going in. They needed to
slap someone.... You deal with the government and there are lies, and
that's what you have to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   Harelson acknowledged digging a "test hole" and removing some
artifacts, but argued he did so only to interest Nevada archeologists
in the site.</TE>
<TE>   Harelson and his wife discovered two large baskets, one with the
body of a boy and the other with the body of a girl, court records
show.</TE>
<TE>   They removed the bodies, baskets and other artifacts, and buried
the bodies in their backyard.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,000 artifacts were later recovered, including
10,000-year-old sandals that possibly were the oldest footwear found
on Earth, said Pat Barker, a state archeologist for BLM.</TE>
<TE>   William Hammett, an Interior Department administrative law judge,
handed down the civil penalty, the fourth largest ever assessed for
archeological theft.</TE>

<HD>Los Alamos Fraud Inquiry Expanded</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A House committee is expanding its inquiry into fraud and credit card
abuse at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, saying it is
apparent the abuse is more widespread than first thought.</LD>
<LD>   The committee issued a sweeping demand for new documents,
including reports to lab director John C. Browne concerning the
alleged irregularities, and a breakdown of whether computers missing
from the nuclear lab contained classified information.</LD>
<LD>   Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, said three investigators are being sent to the lab and
will begin work Monday.</LD>
<TE>   "It is apparent that the amount of fraud and abuse at LANL is much
more extensive and includes many more employees than we had
originally at first believed," said the letter, signed by committee
Chairman Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) and other senior members.</TE>
<TE>   The letter to Richard C. Atkinson, president of the University of
California, which runs the lab, expressed frustration at "the
apparent failure of the University of California and LANL to
sufficiently address these issues over the past several years."</TE>
<TE>   The letter was sent Tuesday and released publicly Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, the committee also requested documents regarding
the firing of two investigators who were dismissed after blowing the
whistle on the lab's management practices and materials from
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the auditor for the lab.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said the expanded request for documents was a result of
questions raised by documents received from an earlier request by the
committee, press reports and information from Los Alamos employees
"suggesting that the problems are more prevalent than first
reported."</TE>
<TE>   Danielle Brian, executive director of the Washington-based
watchdog group Project on Government Oversight, which has worked with
Los Alamos whistle-blowers, said the letter was an encouraging sign.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's a great start. It's obviously a serious
investigation," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Alamos lab grew out of the Manhattan Project that
developed the atomic bomb.</TE>

<HD>Republicans Say Lott's Latest Apology May Help Him</HD>
<DH>Many think the odds of keeping his leadership post are
better. But some still harbor doubts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- One day after embattled Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.)
apologized a third time for statements that critics regarded as
racist, many Republicans say he has improved his chances of holding
onto his leadership post -- but he's not out of the woods yet.</LD>
<LD>   Lott's allies are rallying to help contain the damage, fielding a
phalanx of defenders on today's news talk shows in a public relations
offensive to put the controversy behind him. More quietly, his
supporters are telling Senate Republicans that it could cause as much
political trouble for the party to dump him from his leadership post
as it would to keep him. They warn that forcing Lott from the
leadership could drive him out of the Senate, threatening the party's
two-seat majority.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, Lott's spokesman declared Lott's latest apology a
watershed in the senator's fight to hold onto his job.  "We feel very
confident that we are turning the corner," press secretary Ron
Bonjean said.</LD>
<TE>   Still, many Republicans have been taking a wait-and-see attitude
about Lott's future following his Friday news conference, in which he
admitted a "grievous" error in making comments at Sen. Strom
Thurmond's 100th birthday party that appeared to endorse the
segregationist platform of Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, Lott's fate rests largely in the hands of his 50
Senate Republican colleagues, who elected him leader last month.
Their decision will be affected not simply by rational calculations
of political interest. An equally powerful force may be the clubby
folkways of the Senate, a tradition-bound institution whose members
are very reluctant to criticize one another.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, many Republicans who are appalled by what Lott said
are giving him the benefit of the doubt. No one has called for him to
step down, although some have been jockeying for position in case he
does. As a result, some strategists say, Lott may be safe -- unless
another damaging revelation about his past emerges or the White House
drops its support for him as leader.</TE>
<TE>   "The Senate is very resistant to coups," said a senior Republican
Senate aide. "The question is whether the White House effects a
regime change. It maybe is easier in Iraq than in the Senate."</TE>
<TE>   Whichever course Senate Republicans choose, the situation is
fraught with political risks. If Lott stays on, GOP strategists say,
the controversy threatens to dog him and make it harder for him to
lead the fight for the Bush agenda over the next two years --
especially on issues, such as judicial appointments, that raise
race-related concerns. Many Republicans are worried about the
political damage the controversy will do to the GOP's efforts to
expand its support among minorities. Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), the
outgoing chairman of the GOP's Senate campaign committee, raised
those concerns at length in a Friday night conference call among
Senate Republicans, according to a source who took part in the call.
But when pressed by a colleague, Frist said he was not calling for
Lott to step down, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   If Lott is driven from the leadership, it presents other problems
for the party. Particularly ominous is the prospect -- raised by Sen.
Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in the conference call -- that Lott might
quit the Senate if he could not continue as leader. His replacement
would surely be a Democrat because he or she would be appointed by
Mississippi's Democratic governor, Ronnie Musgrove. That would mean
the GOP's 51-49 balance of power in the Senate would be lost.
Republicans would still control the chamber, because Vice President
Dick Cheney has the power to break a Senate tie, but it would make
the GOP's position vulnerable to the party-switching whims of even a
single member.</TE>
<TE>   Many Republicans dismiss those warnings as a scare tactic, saying
Lott would not be so vindictive as to resign and hobble his party.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction to Lott's news conference indicates he may have at least
won some breathing room in the controversy that has relentlessly
escalated daily for more than a week.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) had telephoned Lott earlier last
week "loaded for bear," an aide said, urging him to apologize in a
full-dress news conference. After Friday's appearance, Snowe issued a
statement saying "Sen. Lott needed to offer a personal, passionate,
and sincere renunciation of racism and segregation in all its forms,
and he did that tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Peter Fitzgerald (R-Ill.), who is up for reelection in 2004,
said through spokesman Brian Stoller that Lott seemed "sincerely
remorseful" in his news conference. Stoller said Fitzgerald believes
"individuals should be judged based on a lifetime of work, not by the
few times he makes public utterances that are patently ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   However, some critics said Lott did not go far enough because he
did not repudiate other elements of his record that they considered
evidence of racial insensitivity, such as his House vote in 1983
against making the Rev. Martin Luther King's birthday a federal
holiday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a pretty uneven press conference," said John Weaver, a
Republican - turned - Democrat who is a political advisor to Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.). "On question after question, he turned back to
campaign platitudes, as opposed to answering questions."</TE>
<TE>   But to build on Lott's defense of his own record, his allies
Saturday distributed talking points to each Republican senator
appearing on television talk shows today.</TE>

<HD>Bush Urges Congress to Extend Benefits to the Nation's
Jobless</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush jumped into the debate over unemployment benefits
Saturday, calling upon Congress to take immediate action next month
to extend unemployment payments for more than 750,000 Americans who
will no longer receive their checks as of Dec. 28.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats had been blasting the Bush administration for remaining
silent as efforts to extend the benefits deadlocked and Congress
adjourned without taking action.</LD>
<LD>   "When our legislators return to the capital, I ask them to make
the extension of unemployment benefits a first order of business,"
Bush said in his weekly radio address.</LD>
<TE>   The president urged Congress to make the extension retroactive so
recipients whose benefits expire Dec. 28 would be paid in full. He
also said he would direct the Labor Department to work with state
unemployment programs to minimize any delays in payments.</TE>
<TE>   "These Americans rely on their unemployment benefits to pay for
the mortgage or rent, food and other critical bills," Bush said.
"They need our assistance in these difficult times, and we cannot let
them down."</TE>
<TE>   The president's comments come as the nation's unemployment rate
rose to 6% last month and the administration is attempting to show
that it is actively engaged in getting the U.S. economy back on
track. Within the last month, Bush cleared out his old economic team,
including Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, and has picked a new
slate of advisors.</TE>
<TE>   But critics called the president's push on unemployment benefits
too little, too late.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very late in expressing an opinion," said Maurice Emsellem,
public policy director of the National Employment Law Project in
Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Emsellem said Bush's remarks did not address the more serious
issues of what to do about the estimated 1 million people whose
unemployment benefits have run out, though they still cannot find
work. Beginning in January, about 90,000 more people each week will
see their benefits run out, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "What's going to happen to those people?" Emsellem asked.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Congress are focusing instead on the more than 750,000
people in the country who are receiving extended unemployment
benefits under a temporary stimulus program passed in March. That
program provided 13 more weeks of benefits on top of the standard 26
weeks, but it expires this month. Unless the law is changed,
recipients who began collecting checks Oct. 6 or later will not
receive the full 13 weeks of pay.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, Democrats and Republicans joined to pass a bill to
extend the program through at least March. But House Republicans, led
by Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Bakersfield), considered the Senate version
too costly and instead pushed for only a five-week extension.</TE>
<TE>   "The Senate version would cost five times as much," said Christin
Tinsworth, a spokeswoman for the House Ways and Means Committee. "We
will have to consider this question again when we get back next
month."</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks Saturday, Bush gave no indication which proposal he

<DL>LAWRENCE, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Six boys plunged through the soft, thin ice of the Merrimack River on
Saturday, and four who were trapped below for several minutes died.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the boys were merely "cold and wet" after rescuers
retrieved them, Deputy Chief Joseph Marquis said. The other four had
been trapped under the ice for at least 10 minutes and were
unconscious when they were pulled from the river, said Lawrence
Police Chief John J. Romero.</LD>
<LD>   The boys, between 7 and 11 years old, walked out on the 1- to
2-inch-thick ice about 25 feet from shore. A seventh boy who had
stayed on shore ran to a nearby house to call for help.</LD>
<TE>   Temperatures were in the mid-40s on Saturday.</TE>

<HD>At Last, Gore Gets to the Oval Office, but It's on 'SNL'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Lieberman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Poking fun at his reputation for stiffness, not to
mention his narrow loss of the presidency, former Vice President Al
Gore completed a string of appearances on comedy shows Saturday by
hosting "Saturday Night Live," which for years won laughs at his
expense.</LD>
<LD>   Gore made light of his lingering public kiss with his wife,
Tipper, during the 2000 Democratic convention, compared the process
of picking a running mate to the reality TV show "The Bachelor" --
bonding with Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) over a glass of
champagne in a hot tub -- and got to play president with the cast of
"The West Wing," enviously trying out Martin Sheen's Oval Office
chair.</LD>
<LD>   "The good news about not being president is that I have my
weekends free," Gore declared in his monologue opening the 90-minute
show. "The bad news is that my weekdays are also free."</LD>
<TE>   On the same stage where cast member Darrell Hammond often
portrayed a dull, zombie-like Gore, Gore embraced such a routine
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe at times I was a little wooden and stiff and ... people
said I was patronizing," Gore told a receptive studio audience before
explaining to them, in his most patronizing voice, that "patronizing
of course means talking to people like they're stupid."</TE>
<TE>   But if Gore spent most of the show following the tradition of
politicians embracing the jokes normally directed at them, he did get
to skewer a Republican as well -- playing Mississippi Sen. Trent Lott
in a skit parodying the Senate leader's attempts to apologize for
remarks praising the segregationist 1948 presidential campaign of
Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.). "As long as I am in office," said Gore,
portraying Lott, "we will leave no white person behind."</TE>
<TE>   After keeping a low profile following his defeat two years ago,
Gore has been making the rounds of TV shows of late -- largely to
promote two books he wrote with his wife, "Joined at the Heart" and
"The Spirit of Family" -- but also perhaps testing the political
waters before saying whether he will again seek the presidency in
2004.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to doing traditional talk show interviews with the
likes of Katie Couric, Barbara Walters and Larry King, Gore has
appeared on shows known more for one-liners and slapstick skits than
policy statements -- trading quips with David Letterman, John Stewart
and Conan O'Brien.</TE>
<TE>   There is a long history of politicians using such shows to soften
their images, from Richard Nixon's "Sock it to me!" on "Rowan &amp;
Martin's Laugh-In" decades ago to Bill Clinton's playing his
saxophone on Arsenio Hall's show in 1992. Gore is not the first
would-be president to accept an invitation to host "SNL" either.</TE>
<TE>   The politico hosts have ranged from liberals George McGovern and
the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. to conservative Steve Forbes, an
uncomfortable-looking host whose 1996 appearance prompted a protest
from one of the musical guests -- the bassist for the group Rage
Against the Machine hurled a shredded American flag into Forbes'
dressing room.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more successful politician performers was Arizona Sen.
John McCain, who this fall quipped that if Barbra Streisand could
dabble in politics, he could dabble in her trade -- and promptly
crooned for the national TV audience.</TE>
<TE>   Gore shared the stage with his wife in two skits, confessing in
one -- as Tipper displayed a photo of him both bearded and bloated --
that perhaps he did overeat a bit after losing the presidency to
George W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   One running gag was that Gore may indeed have found losing harder
than he let on, as when he wistfully tried out Sheen's prop Oval
Office chair in the "West Wing" skit.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess while you were vice president you never got to sit in
it," Sheen said. "No -- no I did not," said Gore, who seemed
reluctant to give up the seat.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," said another cast member, "he did win the popular vote."</TE>

<HD>Treasury Nominee Skilled in the Art of Deal-Making</HD>
<DH>John W. Snow helped launch the deregulation revolution,
which many praise but others fault.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Warren Vieth and James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In 1976, an ambitious young economist in the Transportation
Department helped launch a revolution that changed the ground rules
of American commerce, creating enormous opportunities for some to
prosper, and others to fall behind. John W. Snow has done a little of
both.</LD>
<LD>   Snow, nominated last week to be President Bush's new Treasury
chief, was one of the architects of deregulation, the political
movement that transformed one heavily regulated industry after
another, from trucking to telephones. Like deregulation's mixed
record, Snow and the railroad company he has run for more than a
decade have at times prospered and expanded. Yet they have also
disappointed backers and disrupted the economy.</LD>
<LD>   Described by friends and critics as a consummate
consensus-builder, Snow used his mastery of detail and abundance of
charm at the Transportation Department to assemble the fragile
political alliances needed in the 1970s to reverse decades of
government oversight. He then flagged a ride with what would become
CSX Corp., one of the few surviving major railroads, where he used
his industry expertise and political connections to help the company
benefit from the policies he helped put in place, and enriched
himself in the process.</LD>
<TE>   But Snow, 63, has taken himself, his company, and to some extent
the country on a bumpy ride that has left many better off, but some
battered and bruised.</TE>
<TE>   Economists say deregulation has generated big economic gains for
the country by reducing costs, improving efficiency, encouraging
innovation and, in many cases, lowering prices. But it has not
bestowed its benefits equally. Thousands of people lost their jobs.
Many companies fell by the wayside. In some areas, service was
curtailed and costs increased. The laws still force many shippers to
do business with a single railroad, leaving them unable to shop
around for lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   "The chemical industry, coal-fired steam plants, the electric
utility industry, all of them are very unhappy with deregulation,"
said Robert Banks, president of R.L. Banks &amp; Associates, a railroad
consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   For CSX's stockholders, deregulation has yet to fully deliver on
its promise. At several key points, experts and associates say,
miscalculations by Snow and other CSX executives cost the company
dearly, and CSX stock has been a market laggard. Snow, however, has
profited handsomely from his efforts, taking home more than $50
million in compensation since becoming chairman 11 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "John Snow is a CEO with a mediocre operating record at best, who
has had an extraordinary amount of personal compensation," said Bob
Monks, a shareholder activist who once ran a railroad that did
business with CSX's predecessor. "The pattern of his career is that
of a professional schmoozer."</TE>
<TE>   Snow's defenders are quick to differ. "No, no, that's wrong," said
former Transportation Secretary William T. Coleman Jr., who was
Snow's boss there. "He's not a glad-hand fellow. He knows the
details. If you called him today, he could probably tell you where
every ... freight train is on his rail line."</TE>
<TE>   Snow, who will soon get a chance to present his case when the
Senate takes up his nomination, was unavailable for comment. But a
CSX spokesman said the company is confident Snow's key decisions will
eventually pay off.</TE>
<TE>   A product of Toledo, Ohio, Snow earned a doctorate in economics
and a degree in law. He worked as a college professor and a private
attorney before joining the Transportation Department in the latter
days of the Nixon administration. During the Ford administration, he
became a member of an influential club of high-ranking officials who
believed most regulated industries would be far better off if the
government got off their backs.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, Snow, as a deputy undersecretary of Transportation, was
instrumental in securing passage of the Railroad Reorganization and
Regulatory Reform Act, the first in a series of major deregulation
initiatives. It was followed by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978,
the Motor Carrier Reform Act of 1980 and the more sweeping Staggers
Rail Act of 1980.</TE>
<TE>   If any industry needed restructuring, it was railroads. The
industry had been hobbled by 89 years of ever-increasing government
control of shipping routes, freight rates and passenger service. Half
a dozen major rail carriers had gone belly-up. Some people thought
that the entire industry should be nationalized.</TE>
<TE>   The "4-R Act" did two things: It gave railroads limited ability to
negotiate the terms of their contracts with shippers, and it shoveled
the remains of several bankrupt carriers into Conrail, a new,
government-owned freight line serving the Northeast U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Snow shaped the contents of the bill, mediated differences between
industry and labor, and sold the package to the Republican White
House and Democratic Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "John Snow was the main intellectual force and energy source
behind the 4-R Act," said Robert E. Gallamore, a former federal
railroad regulator who now heads Northwestern University's
Transportation Center. "He was the go-to guy.... He put it into a
legislative vehicle and lobbied it through Congress."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Klem, who worked with Snow at the Transportation
Department and later at CSX, said Snow's people skills are so
impressive that others consistently underestimate his analytical and
consensus-building abilities. As a graduate student, Snow studied the
"Nash equilibrium" concept used by economists to predict outcomes,
and he sometimes used advanced game theory to analyze how to proceed
on an issue.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't expect someone who's that smooth to be deep," Klem
said. "They don't realize that he masters the details. He uses that
to good advantage."</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, the Carter administration began replacing Republican
appointees with Democrats, and Snow needed a new job. He was snapped
up by Chessie System, which later became CSX. As the railroad's chief
Washington lobbyist, he played a role in the policymaking process
that led to passage of the more comprehensive Staggers Act, which
essentially freed the railroads to compete on their own terms.</TE>
<TE>   Snow leapfrogged through the ranks of CSX executives, becoming
president and chief executive in 1989 and chairman in 1991. He
scuttled the diversification strategy pursued by his predecessors,
selling off non-rail subsidiaries and focusing on CSX's core
freight-hauling operations.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Snow made an offer to buy Conrail, which the government
had spun off to private shareholders. He portrayed the proposed
merger as "a terrific marriage" that would cut shipping costs and
appeal to regulators, because the two companies had little overlap.
But it was widely criticized for seeking to create a giant that would
dominate its only major rival in the East, Norfolk Southern Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Snow and CSX "misjudged the reaction of Norfolk Southern, their
customers and the regulatory bodies," said Martin Bercovici, a
Washington lawyer who frequently represents shippers.</TE>
<TE>   Soon CSX and Norfolk Southern were engaged in an all-out bidding
war. They ultimately agreed to pay $10.5 billion in cash and assume
$10 billion in debt to acquire Conrail, dividing the spoils between
them.</TE>
<TE>   To consummate the deal, Snow had to go back to work in Washington
to persuade federal regulators and members of Congress that Conrail's
demise would not harm freight shippers, union members or what was
left of the industry. It took more than a year, but he finally made
the sale.</TE>
<TE>   "Snow and his team were working the Hill and asking members to
either support the deal or be neutral," said Rep. James L. Oberstar
(D-Minn.), who tried to block the acquisition. "He was quite
persuasive."</TE>
<TE>   Rail experts say the acquisition was a good deal for Conrail
shareholders, the rail industry and probably the nation. For CSX, it
was another story.</TE>
<TE>   Snow's company was saddled with a huge debt load, and integrating
CSX and Conrail operations proved more difficult than expected. Costs
escalated, shipments backed up, and customers took their business
elsewhere. Five years later, it is still struggling to digest the
deal, and the company's stock price has fallen by half, closing
Friday at $27.83.</TE>
<TE>   Even within the slow-growing railroad industry, CSX's financial
record is unimpressive, analysts say. "CSX under Snow has been a
sluggish operation," said Mark Reutter, a rail historian and author.
When Snow was bidding for Conrail, CSX predicted the acquisition
would take heavy truck traffic off congested East Coast roads,
Reutter said, "and that has not occurred."</TE>
<TE>   CSX acknowledges that the combination has taken longer and has
created more problems than expected, but it sees light at the end of
the trestle.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly the company paid a premium price for Conrail," CSX
spokesman Adam Hollingsworth said. "However, we're confident that
over time it's going to prove to be the best investment CSX ever
made."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the company has benefited from deft tax filings.
Taking full advantage of laws on the books, CSX paid no federal
income taxes in 1998, 2000 and 2001. Instead, it received federal
rebates of more than $150 million by claiming a number of tax breaks,
including accelerated depreciation of equipment purchases. Critics
say such practices only reinforce perceptions that big business is
granted benefits that ordinary taxpayers are denied.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Snow has nurtured the details of business and politics.</TE>
<TE>   Just ask Rep. Nick J. Rahall II (D-W.Va.), whose district includes
the famed Greenbrier Resort, a mountain getaway owned by CSX and
frequented by Washington power brokers. Greenbrier holds an annual
retreat for members of Congress, who are ferried to and from the site
aboard CSX trains. Snow, a first-rate golfer, is frequently seen on
the course with key lawmakers and CSX customers.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, Rahall called CSX a "robber baron" for trying to
charge local county commissioners a princely sum to place a water
pipe along the company's right of way. But that didn't stop Snow from
inviting Rahall to Greenbrier to play in a foursome that included
professional golfer Tom Watson. Snow reduced the right-of-way fee
from $180,000 to $6,000, and impressed his guest by landing a ball
close to the pin from about 200 yards away.</TE>
<TE>   "He's unusual," said Rahall, a member of the House railroad
subcommittee. "He has served in the bureaucracy. He has served in the
business world. He is well connected. He knows the concerns of the
members of Congress with whom he deals."</TE>
<TE>   Klem, Snow's former colleague in the Ford administration and at
CSX, said he thinks his friend would be a better Treasury secretary
than he is a corporate CEO.</TE>
<TE>   "He's good at the inside game," Klem said. "When he goes to a
meeting with high-level players, he understands what they're after.
He marshals the relevant facts. He does it in such a low-key way,
people think they invented it themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the perfect job for him."</TE>

<HD>Plan to Aid River's Native Species</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Some brown and rainbow trout will be removed from the Grand Canyon
beginning in January to protect the native fish on which they have
been preying.</LD>
<LD>   Officials will use two approaches to thin the populations of
nonnative fish by as many as 30,000 over two years.</LD>
<LD>   They will vary the water levels in the Colorado River below Glen
Canyon Dam, which should disrupt spawning and keep some young fish
from surviving to adulthood. But most of the fish will be captured
and killed.</LD>
<TE>   The removals are part of a two-year experiment aimed at restoring
some of the natural conditions along the Colorado, which has grown
cooler, clearer, and less hospitable for native species since Glen
Canyon Dam was built more than 30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists believe the trout that moved into the river after the
dam's completion have contributed to the decline of the humpback chub
and other native fish.</TE>
<TE>   Drought forced a 1-year delay of the experiment's centerpiece, an
artificial flood designed to mimic the river's seasonal flows.
Theoretically, the floods will move sediment from the mouths of the
Colorado's tributaries and deposit the material along beaches
downstream.</TE>
<TE>   A 1996 attempt to replicate a flood produced only short-term
results, and many scientists now believe the temporary high flows
need to occur on a regular basis.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to figure out a way to do this year in and year out,"
said Nikolai Ramsey, a program officer for the Grand Canyon Trust and
a member of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation group that devised the
experiment.</TE>
<TE>   But bureau spokesman Barry Wirth said the 1996 flood experiment
taught scientists the importance of the sediment. Without it, the
floods would fail to deposit enough material to build up the beaches
and habitat.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau is under order to develop new management techniques for
the Colorado below Glen Canyon Dam, which trapped sediment and
lowered the water temperature. The new conditions allowed nonnative
species like the trout to thrive but threatened native species.</TE>

<HD>Smallpox Ravaged World for Eons</HD>
<DH>A huge international effort has led to the disease's
virtual elimination. The last-known natural case occurred in 1977.</DH>

<LD>In a Cairo museum lies the 3,000-year-old mummy of an Egyptian king,
his leathery face pocked and pitted from the ancient and deadly enemy
that took his life.</LD>
<LD>   The mummy is one of the earliest-known victims of smallpox -- a
tiny virus that none of us encounters today but was, until recently,
an ever-lurking threat that claimed countless souls, slaying emperors
and queens as freely as it struck down beggars and peasants.</LD>
<LD>   Today the smallpox virus has been routed, pushed to the brink of
extinction by a huge international effort involving worldwide
vaccinations. The last-known natural case was in 1977 in Somalia.</LD>
<TE>   "This is, along with safe drinking water, the greatest public
health success of the 20th century," said Dr. David Pegues, associate
professor and hospital epidemiologist at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect that anyone would try to once again unleash this
scourge on the world through biowarfare is thus more than horrible;
it is horribly ironic.</TE>
<TE>   This is a virus that had ravaged humankind for as long as 10,000
years, causing empires to collapse, destroying whole peoples and
transforming the smooth, fresh faces of survivors into grotesque
reliefs of craters and bumps.</TE>
<TE>   An epidemic in AD 180 killed as many as 7 million in Italy,
Greece, Egypt and Asia Minor, possibly triggering the decline of the
Roman Empire.</TE>
<TE>   The inadvertent introduction of smallpox into the Americas by the
Spanish killed millions of Aztecs, helping a few hundred
conquistadors conquer an entire people.</TE>
<TE>   Millions more North American Indians died, some at the hands of
the British, who deliberately gave them gifts of blankets infested
with smallpox scabs during the French and Indian Wars.</TE>
<TE>   Only 40 years ago, 10 million to 15 million people worldwide
contracted smallpox annually and 2 million of them died.</TE>
<TE>   Yet through these centuries of horror came a slow, dawning
knowledge -- and human beings began to fight back.</TE>
<TE>   It had long been noted, for instance, that survivors were
thereafter immune to the disease. Centuries ago, people translated
this fact into a logical, if hazardous practice known as
"variolation," the first inoculation against an infectious disease.</TE>
<TE>   An incision was made in the skin. Then, matter from a pustule or
scab from a mild, smallpox case would be placed in the incision,
exposing the body to a low-grade smallpox infection.</TE>
<TE>   In England, variolation was introduced by Lady Mary Wortley
Montague, whose face had been permanently scarred by "the speckled
monster." She had seen old women performing the procedure in Turkey,
and pressed for its introduction in England. (British authorities
first tested the method on condemned prisoners and pauper children.)</TE>
<TE>   Variolation also came to Colonial America. Puritan Cotton Mather
learned of the technique from an African slave. Mather strongly
advocated the practice, which was considered ungodly by many, who
believed it interfered with God's will. One protester firebombed
Mather's house, leaving a note: "COTTON MATHER, you Dog ... I'l[l]
inoculate you with this, with a Pox to you."</TE>
<TE>   Variolation was risky, killing 1% to 3% of the people who tried
it. But this was better than risking a natural infection, which
killed 20% to 30%. After his troops were devastated by smallpox early
in the American Revolution, Gen. George Washington ordered the
variolation of his troops.</TE>
<TE>   But there was another problem with variolation: It spread disease.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really as likely to start an epidemic as it was to stop
one, unless it was administered under a very strict quarantine," said
Elizabeth Fenn, author of the book "Pox Americana" and an assistant
professor of history at Duke University in Durham, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Quarantine was not the rule: Abigail Adams, for instance, wrote a
series of cheerful letters to her patriot husband, John Adams, after
her variolation, describing her attendance at sermons, public
meetings and standing with "the multitude" to hear the reading of the
Declaration of Independence.</TE>
<TE>   "I read this and I just cringed," Fenn said.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until the end of the 18th century before a safe vaccine
was developed, a pivotal discovery rooted in the oft-repeated lore
that milkmaids had fresh, smooth complexions because they never got
smallpox, just a mild infection from cows known as cowpox.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Jenner, an English scientist, first heard this tale as a
teenager. Years later, after penning many scholarly treatises on such
subjects as the natural history of cuckoos, he decided to tackle the
smallpox and cowpox connection.</TE>
<TE>   In a key 1796 experiment, Jenner showed that a child inoculated
with cowpox pustule extract no longer reacted when variolated with
smallpox, implying the child was now immune to smallpox. His work was
considered preposterous by the scientific community and he was forced
to finance its publication himself.</TE>
<TE>   But as other scientists confirmed Jenner's work, the huge
significance of his discovery became clear, and the practice of
vaccination, from vaccine, which come from the Latin word for cow,
swept through the world. Jenner was proclaimed a hero. Even Napoleon
said he could refuse Jenner nothing, releasing prisoners upon his
request during wars between France and England.</TE>
<TE>   To get live vaccine safely to the Americas, the Spaniards loaded
22 orphan children into a ship and sequentially infected their arms
with the virus so that there was still fresh, living material by
journey's end.</TE>
<TE>   Vaccination works because the virus used, the vaccinia virus, is
similar enough to the smallpox virus to confer immunity. In 1967, the
World Health Organization embarked on a worldwide eradication program
based on mass vaccination with vaccinia -- and by 1980, it appeared
that their job was complete.</TE>

<HD>Far From Battlefield, Marines Lose One-Third of Harrier
Fleet</HD>
<DH>The corps, persuing its long-held dream of a unique flying
force, pays a heavy price: 45 of its elite officers killed</DH>
<SE>THE VERTICAL VISION / PART I: "THE WIDOW-MAKER"</SE>
<AU>Alan C. Miller and Kevin Sack</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>YUMA, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Though many had died flying the Harrier, Marine Corps pilot Peter E.
Yount never thought it would let him down.</LD>
<LD>   He knew the attack jet well and was devoted to it. In the entire
U.S. arsenal, only the compact, muscular-looking Harrier could lift
straight up off a runway, hover like a hummingbird, then blast off in
search of targets.</LD>
<LD>   "Difficult but honest" is how Yount described it.</LD>
<TE>   But on a clear spring day in 1998, the Harrier would betray
him. At 14,500 feet over the Southern California desert, the plane's
engine quit. Yount twice tried to restart it. No response.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm losing control of this thing," Yount radioed to his wingman
in a firm voice. "I've got zero hydraulics. I've got nothing. I'm
getting out of this thing. Get out of my way!"</TE>
<TE>   He veered the aircraft away from farmhouses and highways in the
Imperial Valley below, then pulled the ejection handle. And there, at
7,500 feet, the Harrier failed him again.</TE>
<TE>   As Yount shot out of the cockpit, his seat rotated out of
position. When his parachute unfurled above him, its harness straps
smacked violently against his helmet, whipsawing his head. The
42-year-old lieutenant colonel and father of two young girls died
instantly of a broken neck.</TE>
<TE>   For the Marines, the ensuing rituals were painfully familiar.
Notify the widow. Remove the wreckage. Investigate the causes.</TE>
<TE>   They know this drill all too well because the Harrier is the most
dangerous airplane flying in the U.S. military today.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last three decades, it has amassed the highest rate of
major accidents of any Air Force, Navy, Army or Marine plane now in
service. Forty-five Marines have died in 143 noncombat accidents
since the corps bought the so-called jump jet from the British in
1971. More than a third of the fleet has been lost to accidents.</TE>
<TE>   The toll has been little noted by the public and the media because
the Harrier tends to kill pilots one at a time. In contrast, the V-22
Osprey, a problem-plagued troop transport plane, has killed as many
as 19 Marines in a single crash.</TE>
<TE>   The Harrier and the Osprey are the first two planes the Marine
Corps has acquired in pursuing its long-range vertical vision. A
third plane is under active development and several others are being
conceived.</TE>
<TE>   In the future, according to the vision, all Marine aircraft will
combine the best traits of helicopters and fixed-wing planes, making
the corps' flying force sharply distinct from those of the Navy, Air
Force and Army.</TE>
<TE>   The price to be paid for that vision was first seen in the
Harrier. The officers who died in it ranked among America's most
accomplished aviators. They typically finished near the top of their
flight school classes, often aspiring to become squadron commanders,
generals or astronauts.</TE>
<TE>   Many of their deaths were preventable. The Marines have known for
years they were flying a plane bedeviled by mechanical problems and
maintenance mistakes. Yet they moved haltingly to fix known
shortcomings that threatened pilots' lives.</TE>
<TE>   In Yount's case, a mechanic incorrectly installed a part that led
to failure of the temperamental engine. The ejection system that
fractured Yount's neck had previously killed two pilots.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps initially sold the Harrier to Congress and the
Pentagon for its ability to launch from a clearing as small as a
tennis court, or a damaged runway near a remote battlefield, and then
roar to the rescue of troops in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   In 31 years of flight, however, the Harrier's vaunted ability to
take off vertically has never been used in combat -- only in training
exercises, air shows and the 1994 film "True Lies," when Arnold
Schwarzenegger commandeers a Harrier to save Miami from a terrorist
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the planes have used their powerful thrusters for short,
rolling takeoffs from runways and Navy assault ships, mostly flying
missions that could have been handled by safer, more conventional
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Harrier's ailments can be traced directly to its
innovative vertical-thrust technology. But despite the investment of
tax dollars, aircraft and pilots' lives, there is little evidence
that the Harrier's noncombat deaths have been redeemed in any
significant way on the battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Harrier had been decisive many times in battle, we would
all still regret horribly the tragedies of the pilots who have been
killed, but at least you'd be able to say that the Harrier made a
difference," said Philip E. Coyle, the Pentagon's chief weapons
tester from 1994 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "What makes this situation so difficult is that we just don't have
that kind of battlefield record to support the accidental deaths."</TE>
<TE>   In the Persian Gulf War in 1991, the hot thrust-producing nozzles
in the heart of the fuselage -- the devices that allow the Harrier to
rise and balance in the air -- made the plane a magnet for
heat-seeking missiles. Its loss rate was more than double that of the
war's other leading U.S. combat jets. Five Harriers were shot down
and two pilots died.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most vulnerable plane that's in service now," said
Franklin C. "Chuck" Spinney, who evaluates tactical aircraft for the
Pentagon. "You can't hit that thing without hitting something
important."</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, the use of laser-guided ordnance
from highflying bombers and unmanned drones has diminished the need for
the Harrier's brand of close air support.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan provided precisely the kind of austere battlefield
where the Marines had maintained the Harrier would make a crucial
difference. Yet U.S. commanders held the Harrier out of the first
four weeks of combat last year.</TE>
<TE>   As other planes pummeled Taliban and Al Qaeda targets, Harriers
based on the Navy's amphibious assault ship Peleliu practiced attack
maneuvers over the Arabian Sea, hundreds of miles from the action.</TE>
<TE>   "Other squadrons were going north to the war and we were flying
south for more training," recalled Capt. Matthew Parker, a Harrier
pilot. "It was very frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Marines hope the Harrier will play a more dramatic role
in a potential war with Iraq. But given the plane's limitations, many
defense officials and military analysts deem that unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Answer to a Prayer'</TE>
<TE>   To the Marine Corps' ranking generals, the Harrier has
been a major step toward realizing a dream that germinated during World
War II in the bloody jungles of Guadalcanal and Tulagi. As Marines
battled Japanese forces and malarial mosquitoes on those South
Pacific islands, the Navy withdrew and initially left them to fend
for themselves without air cover and supplies. The Marines lost more
than 1,000 men in the campaign, and their resentment has endured for
60 years.</TE>
<TE>   The precept that Marines in the air should protect Marines on the
ground has been central to the corps' ethos ever since. By 1957,
Marine leaders had proclaimed the bold vision of creating an entire
wing of aircraft with the vertical ability of helicopters and the
speed and range of airplanes, a goal they now hope to reach by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   Their breakthrough plane was the Harrier. It was, said one
general, "an answer to a prayer."</TE>
<TE>   The Marines are now testing the tilt-rotor V-22 Osprey, designed
to speed troops into combat. Its revolutionary technology also has
had deadly side-effects, killing 23 Marines in two crashes in 2000
alone.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon, meanwhile, is developing the Harrier's replacement,
the Marine version of the next-generation Joint Strike Fighter, a
plane that will imitate the Harrier's abilities to take off after a
short roll and land vertically.</TE>
<TE>   As the military's smallest branch, the Marines have long feared
their air wing would be absorbed by the Navy or that the corps itself
would be folded into the Army. In waging the political battle to
remain a self-sufficient fighting force, they have sought over the
years to make their combat role distinctive.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps' generals are painfully aware of the Harrier's
shortcomings. Many can rattle off the names of pilots they have
buried. But they say that accidents are the price of technological
progress, and that the Harrier has proven its value in combat while
paving the way for a superior successor. They deny they have
needlessly jeopardized Marines in pursuit of their vision of an
independent air wing.</TE>
<TE>   "I would resist with all my moral fiber the idea that we would
willingly or knowingly try to bring aboard a program -- V-22 or
anything else -- and so fall in love with the program that we would
put people at risk to ride in those vehicles," Marine Corps
Commandant James L. Jones said at a military forum last year.</TE>
<TE>   If the Harrier's problems have lingered, some current and former
Marine officials contend, it is because the Navy has once again let
them down. As the financial overseer of the corps' aviation program,
the Navy hasn't always provided enough money to maintain a plane
flown only by the Marines, they say -- a charge Navy officials
vigorously dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Undaunted by past failures, the Marines have pressed on. Some
survivors of Harrier pilots say that is as it should be, that their
husbands and sons knew the risks but believed in the cause. Others
are less forgiving, convinced that the corps has been more faithful
to its vertical vision than to its pilots. They say the corps has
taken unreasonable risks with the lives of their loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   "They deserve the best chance we can give them if we're going to
stick them out there to stretch the envelope," said Jim E. Dale,
whose brother, 1st Lt. Kerry D. Dale, died in a 1988 Harrier crash
after his flaps jammed. "They deserve honesty. They deserve
integrity. They deserve the very principles from the corps that we
think the corps stands for."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Harrier's victims left behind adoring wives and
children too young to comprehend. Long after their deaths, their
parents grasp for memories, adorning their sons' bedrooms with
ceremonial swords, plastic airplane models and flags folded neatly
into tri-corner boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve years after Maj. Roland P. Wheeler died in a Harrier crash,
his widow, Brandi, still drives her white Toyota Camry with his call
sign -- "Wheels" -- stamped on her license plate. Even within the
macho culture of military aviation, she said, Harrier pilots hold a
certain swaggering cachet: "If you flew the Harrier, you walked on
water and glowed in the dark."</TE>
<TE>   After watching so many colleagues die, some pilots and their
families have decided the risk is too great. Gary Pheasant left the
Marine Corps in 1988, with 1,800 flight hours in the Harrier, when
his wife decided she could no longer live with the dread.</TE>
<TE>   "When I'd go fly," he said, "she'd make sure the house was clean.
She figured the chaplain could be coming over at any moment."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Love at First Sight</TE>
<TE>   No wonder the Harrier enthralled the Marines when they first saw
it at a British air show in 1968. With wings distinctively swept back
and angled downward, the plane is a technological marvel when it is
flying well.</TE>
<TE>   Named after a low-flying marsh hawk, the Harrier has a massive
Rolls-Royce engine that supplies 23,800 pounds of thrust through four
nozzles that pivot down to produce a shimmering blast of hot air. The
thrust can propel the plane off the ground and into a hover, a
process that pilots compare to balancing an elephant on the head of a
pencil.</TE>
<TE>   The British developed the Harrier in the 1960s to counter the
threat of a Soviet attack. If allied air bases were destroyed, a
dispersed fleet of Harriers could counterattack from glens or roads.</TE>
<TE>   Marine pilot Thomas H. Miller, then a colonel, was one of the
first two Americans to fly the British Harrier. "If I had my way, I'd
have a squadron of those things tomorrow," he told his superiors upon
his return. "I think we can save an awful lot of young people's
lives."</TE>
<TE>   The Marines got their first jump jets in 1971. Over the ensuing 31
years, the corps received 397 Harriers, first from Hawker Siddeley
Aviation Ltd. and British Aerospace Inc., and then from McDonnell
Douglas Corp., lead contractor on the second version of the plane.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines now have 154 Harriers. The plane is no longer in
production but is scheduled to remain in service another 13 to 17
years.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its early billing, the Harrier turned out to have a
crippling flaw: It crashed at an alarming rate.</TE>
<TE>   Other military planes have killed more pilots because there are
more of them, and they log more hours in the air. But by the accepted
standard of U.S. military aviation safety -- major accidents per
100,000 flight hours -- the Harrier has no peer among active planes
today.</TE>
<TE>   Major accidents are known in the military as Class A mishaps if
they cause death, permanent injury or at least $1 million in losses
(the dollar figure has increased over time).</TE>
<TE>   The Class A mishap rate for the first model of the Harrier, the
AV-8A, was astronomical -- 31.77 accidents per 100,000 hours.
Notoriously unstable, it had a propensity for rolling over and
slamming into the ground. Well over half were lost to accidents. One
tragedy-scarred squadron dubbed the plane "the Widow-Maker."</TE>
<TE>   Promising dramatic improvement, the Marines replaced it with the
more stable and capable AV-8B model in the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "Any safety problems, perceived or real, with the AV-8A have been
specifically designed out of the AV-8B," Col. Harold Clark, a Harrier
program officer, proclaimed in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   But by 1996, nearly a quarter of the new planes had crashed.</TE>
<TE>   The lifetime accident rate for the Marines' AV-8B is 11.44 per
100,000 hours of flight, well over the combined rates for other
attack and fighter planes flown during those years by the Marines,
the Navy and the Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   It is more than twice the lifetime accident rate of the Air
Force's F-16 Fighting Falcon, a single-engine tactical aircraft like
the Harrier that has been in service since 1979. It is nearly five
times higher than the A-10 Warthog, an Air Force attack plane that
has been flying since 1976. And it is more than 3 1/2 times the rate
of the F/A-18 Hornet, a twin-engine combat plane flown since 1980 by
the Navy and Marines that, like the Harrier, operates largely off
ships.</TE>
<TE>   The Harrier Review Panel, a Marine commission that issued a 1998
report on the AV-8B's problems, wrote that the Harrier's accident
rates "seem always to have been a decade or more behind the rest of
the tactical aviation world."</TE>
<TE>   All told, Harriers have been involved in more than 300
accidents and 900 less serious incidents, according to the Naval Safety
Center's aviation database. The loss to taxpayers exceeds $1.8
billion. And those figures don't include the plane's calamitous first
decade.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines had a glimmer of hope in 2001. The Harrier earned its
lowest Class A mishap rate ever: 2.74 per 100,000 hours of flight.
That prompted Commandant Jones to say last February that "the Harrier
is flying unbelievably well."</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, a Harrier crashed off the coast of Mexico. Two
more went down in North Carolina in June and July. All three pilots
ejected successfully. The financial losses totaled $90 million. And
the Class A mishap rate for 2002 shot back up to 9.66 through Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Across the Atlantic, planes in Britain's much smaller Royal Air
Force fleet have been crashing at an even higher rate. Between 1990
and 2000, the models most similar to the Marines' AV-8B had
cumulative major accident rates ranging from 12 to 19 when the U.S.
military standard is applied.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen major accidents killed two British and one American pilot
during that period.</TE>
<TE>   In August, an RAF Harrier slammed into the sea as the pilot
parachuted to safety in front of thousands of spectators at a Suffolk
air show. The cause of the crash is under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   A number of other countries, including Spain and Italy, have
bought Harriers over the years. But Taiwan decided earlier this year
not to lease nearly three dozen AV-8Bs from the Marines because of
concerns about "maintenance, safety and performance," said a Taiwan
defense official.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Navy has spent nearly $9 billion since 1971 to buy and
modify the Harriers and an additional $4.1 billion since 1986 to
repair and fly the aircraft. The Marines are rebuilding 74 AV-8Bs at
a cost of $28.2 million each, pushing the overall investment in some
of those planes above $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Budget Battles</TE>
<TE>   Many current and former Marine Corps leaders complain that the
Navy has not always provided sufficient funding because the Harrier,
unlike the F/A-18, belongs to the Marines alone.</TE>
<TE>   In their budget battles with the Navy, the Marines portray
themselves as the deprived stepchild in an institutional rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   Former Navy secretaries and other senior officers deny that the
Navy has shortchanged the Harrier program. But they said the Navy has
been reluctant to provide extra money to the Marines for a jet that
is more costly and less reliable than other combat planes.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the Harrier turned out to be grossly more expensive
than they thought, especially driven by the very high accident rate,
was not the fault of the Navy," said John F. Lehman Jr., who served
as Navy secretary from 1981 to 1987. "That was their miscalculation."</TE>
<TE>   Because the Navy has been unwilling to pour extra money into a
plane it regards as flawed, the Marines have chosen to make do with
what they had.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen E. Brooks, who flew the Harrier for four of his 10
years in the Marines before leaving in 2000, called it "a phenomenal
aircraft when it's being financed and maintained properly."</TE>
<TE>   But he said the Marines didn't "want to acknowledge how
expensive it would be to run it properly.... The Marine attitude would be:
'We'll make it work with what we've got.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Harrier's accidents cannot be traced to any single problem,
but rather to an array of them.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 12 years alone, the Marines have grounded parts of the
Harrier fleet 31 times for periods ranging from days to months.</TE>
<TE>   Failures of the cantankerous Rolls-Royce engine have been chronic,
causing more than two dozen major accidents.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines and the Naval Air Systems Command knew for nearly
eight years that the wing flaps were prone to locking up, but it took
three crashes, two of them fatal, before they decided to redesign the
problem part.</TE>
<TE>   The accident that killed Lt. Col. Yount highlights just how risky
the Harrier can be.</TE>
<TE>   Yount grew up close enough to Cape Canaveral, Fla., to watch
rocket launches from his porch. A former test pilot venerated for his
skill in the cockpit and his leadership in the ready room, he aspired
to become a general. He had been selected to command a Harrier
squadron at the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma.</TE>
<TE>   Janet Yount never fretted much about her husband's safety.
"When I'm in the plane, you don't have to worry," he had assured her. "I'm
in control."</TE>
<TE>   But he once confided that he never wanted to rely on the Harrier's
ejection system. "That thing's dangerous," his mother, Bettye Yount,
recalled him saying.</TE>
<TE>   The accident inquiry concluded that a circlip, a semicircular
fastener, was incorrectly installed by mechanics on the gas turbine
starter, setting off a chain reaction that led to the engine failure.</TE>
<TE>   Then, when Yount ejected, he was killed by the very system that
pilots depend on when they run into trouble.</TE>
<TE>   He became the third Harrier pilot since 1990 to die during an
"in-the-envelope" ejection -- meaning the circumstances were such
that survival would be expected -- according to the Harrier Review
Panel.</TE>
<TE>   A subsequent Navy examination cataloged other serious Harrier
ejection injuries, including five previous "major neck injuries"
sustained during otherwise normal ejections.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the Marines say they had no reason to believe the
ejection system was flawed before Yount's accident. In its aftermath,
they made safety improvements to better protect against serious
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Yount's death unnerved many in the Marine Corps because he seemed
to have made no mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "Here was a guy who did every single thing correctly and still the
airplane ended up letting him down," said retired Lt. Gen. Fred
McCorkle, head of Marine aviation at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines acknowledge they have had a rough ride with the
Harrier. But eight current and former Marine commandants and top
aviation officers told The Times in interviews that it has been worth
it.</TE>
<TE>   Retired Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., who stepped down as
commander of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing in August, said the Marines
"don't stop flying airplanes because we have accidents."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "We try to find out what the problem was and then we fix
it. And we tried to do that with the Harrier."</TE>
<TE>   McCorkle, who retired from the Marines last year after 35 years in
the service, said, "I've heard a lot of people who were very, very
attuned to caring for their troops say that's the cost of doing
business."</TE>
<TE>   Retired Commandant Charles C. Krulak, who convened the Harrier
Review Panel, which generated a six-year infusion of funds for the
program, said the Marines have made many efforts to improve the
plane's safety.</TE>
<TE>   All military pilots accept a certain level of risk. And Harrier
pilots in particular have been willing to commit themselves to a
plane they know is perilous, out of devotion to the Marines.</TE>
<TE>   Many adore the plane because it handles like a hot rod. They
express confidence in their ability to fly it despite the ominous
nicknames it has earned, including "the Scarier" and "the lawn dart."</TE>
<TE>   Like Capt. Richard F. Davis, who got a pilot's license before he
could drive, many had wanted to fly since childhood. And like Capt.
Manuel Rivera Jr., who challenged friends to play handball while he
hopped on one foot, they were fit, disciplined and brimming with
bravado.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, 27, died when his AV-8A rolled over during a
vertical takeoff in 1975. Rivera, 31, died when his AV-8B smashed into the
Omani coastline during a Gulf War training mission in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   For the pilots, it is a measure of their intense loyalty to the
plane and to the corps that even those who have suffered incalculably
from its crashes tend to remain unflinching advocates.</TE>
<TE>   Retired Gen. Richard. D. Hearney, a member of the first Harrier
squadron, was the head of Marine aviation in 1994 when his second
son, Brenden K. Hearney, 29, flew a British Harrier into the ground
while on an exchange program with the RAF in England.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got my lifeblood tied up in the program, literally," Hearney
said in an interview. Did his son's death change his commitment to
the Harrier? "Not a bit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, John O'Brien, a 28-year-old Marine pilot with only 152
hours in the Harrier, smashed his plane into a grove of trees during
a tricky "rolling vertical landing."</TE>
<TE>   Pinned inside the flaming wreckage, he suffered burns over
more than a third of his body and ultimately lost part of an arm and a
leg.</TE>
<TE>   Without a trace of bitterness, O'Brien said the Marines need the
combat flexibility the Harrier provides.</TE>
<TE>   "Advancements in technology don't come without sacrifice," O'Brien
said, surrounded at his Pennsylvania home by his wife and three young
daughters. "Advancements in technology are sometimes written in
blood."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Combat Record</TE>
<TE>   It would be one thing if the Harrier's unique design had produced
unique results. But in two wars and a number of lesser conflicts, the
plane has not made a distinctive mark.</TE>
<TE>   It is telling that Marine leaders, when defending the Harrier's
record, tend to point back two decades to another nation's conflict.</TE>
<TE>   In Britain's Falkland Islands War with Argentina, Royal Navy Sea
Harriers won a nation's reverence by defending the short-deck ships
on which they were based. Armed with cannons and heat-seeking
missiles, they proved too much for Argentina's Mirage fighters and
other jets in air-to-air combat.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps' Harriers have never faced a similar mission and
are not outfitted to do so. The Marines obtained the plane primarily
to support troops on the ground. As a result, the corps accepted many
trade-offs for an aircraft that relies on powerful blasts of hot air
to propel it into the sky.</TE>
<TE>   The superheated column of thrust can liquefy asphalt, while its
huge intakes can ingest pebbles and other engine-shredding debris.</TE>
<TE>   The Harrier has to be light enough for the engine's thrust to lift
it straight off the ground, so it carries a relatively small amount
of fuel, which limits both its range and payload. Its maximum
external load, including bombs and fuel, is 9,000 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the Marines' own F/A-18 can handle 15,500 pounds and
the Air Force's A-10 up to 16,000 pounds, according to Jane's All the
World's Aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   To keep its weight down, the Harrier has no protective armor. It
carries no flame-retardant foam in its fuel tanks because the foam
displaces fuel. The fuel tanks are not equipped with self-sealing
membranes to plug bullet or shrapnel holes.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps spent a lot of money to test such survivability
systems in the late 1990s but ultimately rejected them because of
their weight, said the Naval Air Systems Command, which oversees
Marine aircraft safety.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the plane's single engine gives it little margin for
error. It is neither supersonic nor stealthy, which means it cannot
fly especially fast or easily elude enemy radar.</TE>
<TE>   And the hottest of its thrust-producing nozzles are in the middle
of the fuselage, a design anomaly required to balance the Harrier for
vertical flight. In other aircraft, the hot spot is near the tail,
where a hit by a heat-seeking missile is less likely to be fatal.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, the Harrier's vulnerability was magnified
because it was intended to fly close to the ground as it swooped down on
enemy troops.</TE>
<TE>   In its first significant U.S. combat role, during the Persian Gulf
War in 1991, it paid a heavy price.</TE>
<TE>   On the war's final day, Capt. Reginald C. Underwood and other
Harrier pilots were flying below the cloud cover at about 8,000 feet
so they could see their target, a convoy of Iraqi military vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "We were flying way too low," said his squadron commander, Lt.
Col. Jerry Fitzgerald. An Iraqi missile went straight up the left hot
nozzle of Underwood's jet. "He never saw it coming," Fitzgerald said.</TE>
<TE>   Underwood was killed, one of two Harrier pilots to die in Gulf War
combat. Five of the seven Harriers that took enemy fire were
destroyed. Two ejecting pilots were captured by the Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   The Harrier's attrition rate of 1.5 planes for every 1,000 sorties
flown contrasted with a rate of 0.5 for the A-10, a sturdy and
inexpensive attack jet that flew many dangerous missions. The F-16
had an even lower rate, 0.2, and the Marine Corps' F/A-18 suffered no
losses.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Postwar Praise</TE>
<TE>   The Marines nevertheless point to the Gulf War as the Harrier's
proving ground. The corps' commandant at the time, Alfred M. Gray
Jr., told the Senate Armed Services Committee in March 1991 that its
support for the AV-8B "paid off in spades" in the Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   Marine officials and other Harrier proponents note that Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces in the Gulf, cited the
Harrier in a postwar report as one of several weapons that gave
"standout performances."</TE>
<TE>   The Harrier did fly early and often. But it required an enormous
transport and supply operation to keep it provisioned with bombs,
fuel, parts and distilled water for cooling the engine, a far cry
from its originally stated mission of operating from remote
locations.</TE>
<TE>   It took about 2,000 Marines to support an air group based at King
Abdul Aziz Air Base near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, that included 66
Harriers and 20 OV-10 Bronco observation planes, said retired Col.
John R. Bioty Jr., who commanded the group.</TE>
<TE>   During the last 10 days of the war, some planes also operated from
a short runway at Tanajib, a rearming and refueling base about 35
miles south of the Kuwaiti border that put them closer to the enemy
than any other airplane.</TE>
<TE>   The Harriers bombed Iraqi artillery, armored vehicles, troops and
air defense units, Bioty said. And while other planes flew far more
sorties, the smaller Harrier fleet flew a substantial number: 3,349.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the aircraft was able to base closer to the forward edge
of the battle area, it could respond quicker and didn't require air
refueling," Bioty said. "It can do things other airplanes can't do
and can go places other airplanes can't go."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, retired Air Force Gen. Charles A. Horner, the U.S. air
commander in the Gulf, said the decision to stack aircraft over the
battlefield "negated the need for quick response" from AV-8Bs.</TE>
<TE>   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
omitted the plane from its 1997 report on the Gulf air war, pointing
to its "relatively few strikes against strategic targets."</TE>
<TE>   Though the Harrier proved effective at what it did, "trying to
justify it based on the Gulf War is tenuous at best," Horner said.
"In terms of payload, range and suitability for close air support,"
he added, "the A-10 is a much better platform."</TE>
<TE>   Even some Marine generals agreed. Given the loss of five planes,
the Harrier in the Gulf "wasn't a failure, but it wasn't a great
success," said retired Lt. Gen. Charles H. Pitman, chief of Marine
aviation from 1988 to 1990. "I don't think they did anything
spectacular."</TE>
<TE>   The Marines say they have since reduced the Harrier's
vulnerability by tripling the number of flares and other decoys that
the plane can fire to divert missiles.</TE>
<TE>   But the primary reason the plane is safer in war today is that the
advancing technology of laser-guided missiles and bombs has allowed
all combat planes to fly at higher altitudes. In the process, the
Harrier has become less relevant.</TE>
<TE>   "You can find missions the Harrier can perform," said Michael
O'Hanlon, a defense analyst at the Brookings Institution, a
nonpartisan think tank based in Washington, "but I question whether
any of them are missions only the Harrier can perform."</TE>
<TE>   In future conflicts, unmanned drones like the one that killed
suspected Al Qaeda operatives in Yemen last month are expected to fly
missions that had been the exclusive province of combat planes like
the Harrier.</TE>
<TE>   And American commanders now routinely assign various aircraft to
essentially loiter over the battlefield, reducing the value of basing
planes up front near the troops.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics even argue it is unwise to put planes so close to the
enemy because it leaves them vulnerable to attack.</TE>
<TE>   All of those factors conspired to make the Harrier a marginal
player last year in Afghanistan, where highflying bombers and fighter
planes inflicted considerable damage before the Harriers were even
called into action.</TE>
<TE>   "Close air support in Marine terms was not what was happening
there," said Col. Thomas D. Waldhauser, commanding officer of the
15th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which included the Harrier squadron
aboard the Peleliu. "Close air support in Afghanistan was a B-52
dropping bombs from 30,000 feet."</TE>
<TE>   The six planes on the Peleliu were sent into combat only after
their frustrated pilots complained to Commandant Jones about their
idleness.</TE>
<TE>   When the war began, the Harriers in the region lacked a laser
targeting system. Lt. Gen. Michael A. Hough, chief of Marine
aviation, said Harriers were cleared to join the war only after
military leaders agreed that other aircraft with laser systems could
pinpoint targets for the AV-8Bs. (The laser systems are now being
installed in 98 Harriers at a cost of nearly $1.7 million each.)</TE>
<TE>   "This is the sort of conflict in which Harrier proponents
typically would expect to see the Harrier prominently used,
especially early on," said Christopher Bolkcom, a military aviation
analyst for the Congressional Research Service. "I don't think it's
lost on many people that the Harriers were not the first airplanes
used in that war."</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Harriers entered the fray, targets were scarce. In
November and December, the busiest months for the Harrier, the
aircraft dropped only 161 bombs during 342 sorties. The 400 allied
aircraft in Afghanistan never included more than 12 Harriers. Until
Dec. 31, the Harriers flew exclusively from ships, just like safer
and more effective Navy and Marine planes.</TE>
<TE>   On that day, after the fall of Kandahar, the Marines dispatched
two Harriers to a partly destroyed airstrip there. Marine leaders
touted this as evidence that the planes were operating where others
could not.</TE>
<TE>   But the two planes stayed only one night, flying four sorties and
dropping no bombs, according to the Marines.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Chris Raible, who piloted Harriers in Afghanistan, said the
flights "were like photo ops."</TE>
<TE>   When medals were awarded for Operation Anaconda, the major battle
in eastern Afghanistan in March, the honors went to the Marine
helicopter pilots who provided low-level fire for ground troops while
the Harriers circled above.</TE>
<TE>   Harriers have been operating alongside A-10s at a high-altitude
air base at Bagram since October, where the Marines say they have
provided "essential support to ground units." But the thin air and a
torn-up runway have restricted vertical flight.</TE>
<TE>   In two important respects, the Harrier performed impressively:
reliability and bombing accuracy. Pilots said the plane held up
remarkably during extended sorties and that their bombs almost always
hit their mark.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Jones said the Harriers "acquitted themselves quite well" in
Afghanistan. "They've proven themselves to be very worthy
contributors."</TE>
<TE>   But a number of military officials and analysts question the value
of the Harrier's contribution.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the reason the AV-8s were used at all in Afghanistan was
a tendency by the U.S. military to give everybody their turn, whether
you needed them or not," said Anthony H. Cordesman, an analyst at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies. "The AV-8B simply
wasn't competitive in terms of range, payload, survivability, target
acquisition [or] communications capability."</TE>
<TE>   The Marines acquired the Harrier for a different type of war than
is fought today, said Daniel Goure, a former director of the
Pentagon's Office of Strategic Competitiveness and now vice president
of the Lexington Institute, a think tank in Arlington, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "For that reason, they took all the attendant risk of mishap rates
and all the rest," he said. "In hindsight, I suspect they would have
come up with a different answer."</TE>

<TE>   The Marines had a disastrous time with the first Harrier, the
AV-8A, destroying 66 of 114 planes in accidents. They vowed that its
successor, the AV-8B, would end the safety problems. The record
improved, but the AV-8B is still the most dangerous military plane in
service.</TE>
<TE>   1981: "Any safety problems, perceived or real, with the</TE>
<TE>   AV-8A have been specifically designed out of the AV-8B."--Col.
Harold Clark, Harrier program official.</TE>
<TE>   1984: The AV-8B enters the fleet. Accident rate falls dramatically
from the AV-8A but stays high compared to other military planes.</TE>
<TE>   1990: Col. James Hart, Harrier program manager, tells a House
committee the AV-8B "is a significantly safer aircraft than its
predecessors," even though 24 of the first 204 crashed.</TE>
<TE>   1990: The AV-8B has 11 major accidents, two of them fatal. Marines
hold a symposium to decide what to do.</TE>
<TE>   1991: The AV-8B flies extensively in the Persian Gulf War, but the
introduction of a new night-attack model is delayed after a crash in
California reveals problems with Rolls-Royce engines. Casing flexed
at high speeds and caused fires.</TE>
<TE>   1992: Defense Department's inspector general reports the Harrier
engine still "ranks low in reliability" after seven upgrades, yet
concludes that the Navy and Marines are "taking appropriate actions"
to reduce accidents.</TE>
<TE>   1996: The AV-8B has the highest major accident rate of any active
plane in the military. Lt. Gen. Harold W. Blot, Marine aviation
chief, tells a House panel it "is still a safe plane to fly. We

<TE>   About This Series</TE>
<TE>   In reporting this series, The Times analyzed 87 judge advocate
general investigation reports of individual Harrier accidents between
1971 and 2001, most of which were obtained under the federal Freedom
of Information Act. The JAG office, a unit of the Navy, which
oversees Marine Corps aviation, withheld portions of some reports,
citing privacy and national security concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The Times also based its findings on information from the Naval
Safety Center's aviation database, obtained under the Freedom of
Information Act as well. The database includes voluminous records on
Navy and Marine aircraft and crewmen involved in accidents from 1980
through mid-2002.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps provided information on Harrier safety,
maintenance and combat records, including a breakdown of Harrier
accidents and fatalities.</TE>
<TE>   Comparative statistics about accident rates were provided by the
Naval Safety Center and Air Force Safety Center. Harrier cost data
came from the Naval Air Systems Command and the Navy Center for Cost
Analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines did not provide the identity of pilots killed in
crashes. The names and backgrounds of pilots who died in the Harrier
were compiled through searches of the Marine Corps Historical Center,
National Archives, news clippings and online databases, as well as
interviews with other fliers and family members. The Times
interviewed at least one relative of each of the 45 Marines killed in
Harrier accidents.</TE>
<TE>   The Times also interviewed scores of Harrier pilots, mechanics and
commanders, as well as a dozen current and former Marine Corps
generals, Pentagon officials and military analysts. Marine Commandant
James L. Jones answered questions about the Harrier posed by a Times
reporter earlier this year but declined to be interviewed for this

Jessica, 7, left, and Patricia, 9, says she never fretted for her

<CP>PHOTO: BRIEF VISIT: Marine leaders touted the fact that two
AV-8B Harriers were able to land on the heavily damaged airstrip at
Kandahar, Afghanistan, on Dec. 31, 2001, where other warplanes could
not. But the Harriers stayed just one night, flew four sorties and
dropped no bombs. One captain said the flights "were like photo ops."</CP>
