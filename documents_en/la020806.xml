<HD>From Vietnam to the U.S.: 'Mai's America'</HD>

<LD>Americans sure can look ugly, especially in contrast to a sweet,
openhearted Vietnamese girl. "Mai's America," a "POV" documentary by
Marlo Poras airing on PBS tonight, follows high school exchange
student Mai Nguyen from Hanoi to Mississippi and beyond.</LD>
<LD>   Mai comes from a comparatively well-to-do family in Vietnam that
plans to send her to the United States for her senior year, hoping
she will get accepted by an American university. Our first view of
her is in Hanoi, where she is chatting with streetwise but unschooled
shoeshine boys. "Compared to these kids, I feel like I am a
princess," she says.</LD>
<LD>   Mai arrives in Meridian, Miss., and settles in with a family of
self-described "rednecks," which might be giving them too much
credit. Their accented English is more difficult to understand than
Mai's. Neither "host parent" works, and one gets the feeling their
only interest in Mai is to milk her for living money. Still, Mai
shows remarkable compassion toward her "depressed" host mom,
"injured" host dad and "lonely" host sister.</LD>
<TE>   Filmmaker Poras' camera is so unobtrusive, it is apparent the
documentary's subjects forgot it was there recording their words and
movement (or lack thereof, in the host parents' case). This draws
viewers into Mai's world. Her commentary can be amusingly blunt, as
when she says of her host sister: "Kim goes to her boyfriend's
trailer every weekend. I don't like to go there. She's always in
David's room having sex."</TE>
<TE>   Mai's observations have a kind of "Innocents Abroad" appeal of an
outsider struggling to make sense of a radically different culture,
and revealing the sometimes nonsensical nature of that culture in the
process.</TE>
<TE>   Things improve for Mai when she decides to move in with a new,
African American host family and she becomes fast friends with a
teenage transvestite, who also feels like an outsider. ("I wish you
could come to Vietnam. I'm sure many boys would fall in love with
you," she consoles Chris Welburn, a.k.a. "Christy.") Mai trades her
bowl haircut for a hip buzz job, hangs out at a gay nightclub and
enjoys bowling and roller-skating.</TE>
<TE>   She also makes friends in the local Vietnamese expatriate
community, all the while gaining insights about her home country, the
U.S. and the difficult relationship between the two. It is quite a
revelation for her, for example, when she realizes that some of the
American soldiers who fought in Vietnam were the same age as the boys
sitting around her in history class.</TE>
<TE>   Mai does make it to Tulane University, but the story doesn't end
there, as finances and family pressures affect her life. "A dollar
takes so long to earn in Vietnam, and you can spend it so quickly in
America," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Though Mai's future is uncertain at the end of the documentary, in
Scarlett O'Hara fashion, her last words are upbeat: "I never imagined
that I would end up having a life like the shoeshine boys in Vietnam.
But I feel like I'm so much luckier than them. I'm 20 years old and
already I have so much education behind me."</TE>
<TE>   Viewers are left assured that for the resilient Mai, tomorrow is
another day.</TE>
<TE>   "Mai's America" airs on "POV" at 10 tonight on KCET.</TE>

<HD>The Evans Method: A Dash of Passion</HD>

<LD>What could it possibly say about today's movie business that the
coolest guy in Hollywood is an over-the-hill 72-year-old ex-studio
chief who hasn't had a hit in years? That would be larger-than-life
producer Robert Evans, star of "The Kid Stays in the Picture," a new
documentary about the long-ago head of Paramount Pictures that has
generated a tidal wave of glowing reviews and press coverage.</LD>
<LD>   The first actor to head a movie studio, Evans helped engineer such
classics as "Rosemary's Baby," "Love Story," "The Godfather" and
"Chinatown" before spiraling out of control on cocaine and being
caught up in a messy murder investigation during the making of "The
Cotton Club."</LD>
<LD>   But who says there are no second acts in show business? Thanks to
the new film and the cult popularity of an audio version of his 1994
memoir, also titled "The Kid Stays in the Picture," Evans has a whole
new career as a hipster raconteur. How hip? Well, MTV was just out at
Evans' Woodland estate filming a series of spots plugging the
channel's upcoming MTV Video Awards.</LD>
<TE>   "Lemme tell you, pal," he says in a spot for best female video,
his voice rumbling like a New York subway train, "any man who thinks
he knows the mind of a woman is a man who knows nothing."</TE>
<TE>   When I was at Evans' house the other night, the phone rang often,
usually with a young woman on the other end of the line. Vanity Fair
publisher Graydon Carter, who produced "The Kid," confessed to the
New York Observer that his 9-year-old daughter regularly badgers him
with the question, "Is Bob coming over for dinner tonight?"</TE>
<TE>   In a year in which the movies are grossing more but have less
ambition than ever before, it's telling that we have such abiding
nostalgia for throwbacks like Evans and the late Lew Wasserman who,
in their very different ways, represented an independence and
originality that has vanished from today's corporate suites.</TE>
<TE>   His face tanned the color of a beef bullion cube, Evans is one of
the great self-invented characters of our age, an age that's
especially in love with confessional entertainment, be it John
McEnroe's tell-all autobiography or MTV's real-life sitcom "The
Osbournes." Without any prompting, Evans punctuates our dinner
conversation with gory details about his recovery from a 1998
stroke--suffered in a movie pitch meeting--including a demonstration
of a new "heel-to-toe" form of walking he's mastered. As far as his
sexual performance is concerned, he offers assurances: "I'm still a
competitor--the dames aren't complaining."</TE>
<TE>   Surely there's a big component of camp appeal here. But our
fascination isn't just with Evans, but with the era he embodies. His
comeback is inextricably tied to our longing for the days when
Hollywood executives weren't pawns of giant conglomerates, but
swashbucklers who aspired to greatness. Evans' reign at Paramount
(1966 to 1975) neatly coincides with the last golden age of
Hollywood, a Camelot-like time when a young generation of high-living
maverick filmmakers reinvigorated the movie business.</TE>
<TE>   It's no surprise that young directors like Brett Ratner, David O.
Russell and Wes Anderson are eager to sit at Evans' feet, soaking up
the stories of his seesaw relationships with Francis Coppola, Roman
Polanski and Blake Edwards, who Evans says once challenged him to a
duel.</TE>
<TE>   "The studio mind-set today is all about franchises, but Bob was an
idea man," says Ratner, director of a franchise series himself, "Rush
Hour." "If Bob were running Paramount today I'd make a movie there in
a minute. He never made a movie that was a generic copy of something
else."</TE>
<TE>   Russell, who interviewed Evans at the recent L.A. Film Festival,
admits it would be unthinkable for someone as freewheeling as Evans
to run a studio today. "Bob couldn't work at a sterile product
factory like today's Paramount," says Russell, director of "Three
Kings." "He loved movies that were messy and passionate--his response
to film was always emotional. Today it's almost a sign of weakness in
the corporate culture to be excited or emotional about anything."</TE>
<TE>   Evans is loath to compare his tenure as head of production at
Paramount with the studio today. Viacom chief Sumner Redstone was at
the producer's side after his stroke, and studio head Sherry Lansing
has extended him many personal kindnesses. But events speak for
themselves; when Evans produced "The Saint," the film went through 11
writers and ended up having nothing to do with the project he
originally embarked on.</TE>
<TE>   Evans has opposed efforts to remake "Love Story," though the
studio, he says, is still trying. "I wouldn't touch it," he says.
"I'd need to take a Lysol bath afterward."</TE>
<TE>   To learn why movies are so uninspired today, it's worth taking a
closer look at how things were different during his heyday. In
business terms, Paramount today is a huge success. But its movies are
bland and formulaic. When Evans took power, the studio was owned by
Gulf &amp; Western czar Charles Bluhdorn, a volatile immigrant
entrepreneur who cooked the company's books, erupted in rages and was
ruled by his emotions. When Evans lit up the Gulf &amp; Western building
like a theater marquee for the opening of "Love Story," Bluhdorn
cried like a baby.</TE>
<TE>   Bluhdorn was something today's tycoons are not--an inveterate
risk-taker. His biggest gamble was Evans himself, who had utterly no
qualifications to run a studio when Bluhdorn gave him the job after
reading a New York Times piece by Peter Bart (soon to be Evans'
right-hand man) that portrayed Evans as a crafty hustler who was
beating the slow-moving studios to hot literary properties by buying
books before their authors had even finished writing them.</TE>
<TE>   This Sammy Glick-style savvy appealed to Bluhdorn, who was smart
enough to realize that his movie studio was in desperate need of
fresh executive talent.</TE>
<TE>   Business was bad all over, but especially so at Paramount. To save
money, Bluhdorn in 1970 moved the studio's production headquarters to
Canon Drive in Beverly Hills, freeing up the lot to be rented out for
TV production. "They were shooting porno films on the lot," recalls
Bart, now editor of Variety. "It was a good time to be somewhere
else. The minute we got to Beverly Hills, everything started to work,
probably because there was no studio bureaucracy."</TE>
<TE>   That's an understatement. In 1974, when Paramount made "The
Godfather II," "Chinatown" and "The Conversation," the studio's
production staff consisted of Evans, Bart, a pair of story editors, a
post-production executive and a business affairs attorney. Six
people. As Evans likes to say: "Less was more."</TE>
<TE>   Today's studios are overflowing with executives, but few have the
power to make a meaningful decision. When Bart fell in love with a
script, as he did with "Harold and Maude," he made Evans take the
script to the john, lock the door and not come out till he'd finished
reading it. Knowing Bluhdorn would go berserk if he discovered they
were making a film about an 18-year-old boy who falls in love with an
80-year-old woman, no one told him what the film was about until it
was finished.</TE>
<TE>   "We lied to everybody," Evans says. "We just said it was a love
story, because Charlie liked love stories."</TE>
<TE>   Evans once told Esquire, "My business is gambling. It's the
gambling instinct that makes me tick." He admits that when he
greenlit Robert Towne's "Chinatown" script, he didn't "understand a
... thing" about the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "But I understand talent," Evans says. "And if you have Jack
Nicholson, Roman Polanski and Bob Towne, you take the bet that you're
gonna have a great movie. Success is all about betting on your
instincts. That's the problem with today's business. It's not an art
form, it's a barter form. The studios are run by committees of MBAs,
but I've never seen an MBA who knows how to make people cry."</TE>
<TE>   Evans had a thousand flaws besides being vain and
self-destructive. But when it came to movies, he was a romantic, not
a businessman, which is probably why he has such a cult following
today. Because romance is exactly what's missing from today's movie
business. It's a longshot that Evans will ever make a great movie
again, but he hasn't thrown in the towel. He's still hustling,
pushing this project along, getting that script written. He doesn't
know how to give up.</TE>
<TE>   His most recent movie was a feeble remake of "The Out of Towners."
"It was terrible," he admits. "Goldie Hawn's salary cost more than
the original movie."</TE>
<TE>   So why'd you make it, I ask. Evans stares at me through his
blue-tinted glasses. "Hey," he says. "I needed the gig."</TE>

<HD>Choosing, Not Just Following a Path</HD>
<DH>Theater* Being a star of 'The Sopranos' has brought Edie
Falco more opportunities and choices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BLAKE GREEN</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Belasco Theatre has a ghost. Stanley Tucci has a friend who
swears he observed her wafting about. Edie Falco, wandering around
the old Broadway house, "got completely creeped out in a stairwell
just knowing about the possibility of running into something."</LD>
<LD>   Falco and Tucci are starring in the revival of "Frankie and Johnny
in the Clair de Lune," and on this day of rehearsals she's brought
along her dog, Marley, a yellow Lab-German shepherd mix, who seems a
bit edgy, sniffing and pacing about the dressing room. "Marley gets
freaked out by thunderstorms," Falco explains, referring to the
weather and deftly turning the conversation to the realm of the
explicable.</LD>
<LD>   It's something that Falco, whose life has been full of surprising
turns, is good at doing. Fingernails blunt and unpolished, thick
blond hair cropped in a shag--neither in keeping with the super-glam
persona of Carmela Soprano, the mob boss' wife who's been Falco's
vehicle to stardom in the HBO hit--the actress looks at the world
with a gimlet eye. Two very big, blue ones.</LD>
<TE>   Seemingly effortlessly, Falco moves among stage, film and
television, insisting she has no preference for one over another.
"The one thing I know is that I love acting, and I'll take any
opportunity to do a piece I find inspiring. It used to be I'd take
just any opportunity." She smiles, as aware as anyone of her chosen
profession's fickle nature. Take her current role as Frankie, the
hash-slinging waitress opposite Johnny, the short-order fry cook, in
Terrence McNally's play about a romantic relationship. It's in
previews and opens Thursday. Members of the producing Araca Group,
whose credits include "Urinetown," contacted her agent in hopes of
producing a play Falco wanted to do.</TE>
<TE>   "That," reports Falco, "is the kind of thing you dream about." As
is the fact that director John Sayles supposedly had her in mind when
he wrote Marly, the character she plays in the film "Sunshine State."
He sent a handwritten invitation. "That, and having coincidentally
named her Marly"--never mind the spelling deviation from her pet's
name--"unbelievable!"</TE>
<TE>   Once the "Frankie and Johnny" revival was settled upon, Tucci was
invited to make up the other half of the cast. Director Joe Mantello,
a fan since Falco's "Side Man" days off and then on Broadway, also
signed on. "She's someone who acts without acting," he says
admiringly.</TE>
<TE>   Waitressing isn't exactly unfamiliar territory for the actress,
who spent a decade or so supporting herself in this manner. The play
is set in Frankie's studio apartment, which, on stage, is actually
larger than the fifth-floor "teensy walk-up I lived in for years,"
Falco says. "She's a woman in middle age living as a single person.
Right now, I'm significant other-less."</TE>
<TE>   But right now, rationalizes Falco, who's 39, "this feels right.
I've spent a lot of time in relationships with men, feeling
neglectful, when the truth is I've worked my whole life toward this
sort of exciting, challenging career when I'm busy, have choices.</TE>
<TE>   "What I want to be doing right now," she continues, "is to be at
this theater working on this show" and--when the limited run ends in
late December--be back on the set to film the fifth season of "The
Sopranos." The success of the series is responsible for the fact that
Falco now has a house in Greenwich Village--and a place in the
Catskills--instead of that studio walk-up. The show's
much-anticipated fourth season begins Sept. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the fame that's come her way with "The Sopranos," Falco
says, "I've had to prepare myself for all kinds of stuff I didn't
know would be coming."</TE>
<TE>   The actress had been hanging around casting offices for a long
time before Carmela appeared on the horizon. Falco had done
television roles--including a couple of seasons as Officer Diane
Whittlesey in the HBO series "Oz"--as well as a number of independent
films dating to her senior year in college when she was cast in
1987's "Sweet Lorraine" with Maureen Stapleton.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was going to be a piece of cake," says Falco,
snapping her fingers. "Then, I didn't work for four years, fell into
waitressing and became seriously depressed."</TE>
<TE>   Classmates Hal Hartley, Nick Gomez and Eric Mendelsohn also cast
her in a couple of their films (she played the title role in
Mendelsohn's 1999 "Judy Berlin," which was set on Long Island). "I've
been thinking about some funny titles if I ever write my
autobiography," Falco says, "and one of them would be 'When This
Movie Comes Out.' ... If I had a nickel for every time those words
were said to me and turned out to be completely irrelevant to the
real truth: Nothing happened!"</TE>
<TE>   "Side Man," which opened in 1998, "was kind of my first play,"
Falco says. "I had to get my Equity card. I'd only done a lot of
one-acts and showcase stuff. The truth is, I never thought it would
go beyond a workshop." In the end, she says, she's figured she played
the role of Terry, the jazz musician's tragic alcoholic, suicidal
wife, "about 800 times," and "if I had a favorite, it would have to
be her. The experience was just so profound."</TE>
<TE>   Enter, in 1999, "The Sopranos."</TE>
<TE>   After the London production of "Side Man" opened two years ago,
fans who gathered at the stage door often greeted Falco with cries of
"Carmela!"</TE>
<TE>   That "concerned and saddened me," Falco says. "If I were another
person, maybe I'd be nothing but flattered, but part of me was
heartbroken." Terry, the role she'd created, was based on a real
person (the mother of playwright Warren Leight), "and for people to
come from a performance where they'd just seen her and say, 'Hey,
Carmela.' ... "</TE>
<TE>   For although "The Sopranos" "has been a spectacular job
experience, I'd hoped to work with many different writers and
directors over the years, each with a story to tell. I'm really
nothing more than a conduit for them to do things, and I hope this
doesn't limit the audiences' experiences of the stories because
they're too clouded by Carmela."</TE>
<TE>   In other roles, she's taken care to steer clear of the many
Carmela types she's been offered.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is you're responsible for shaping your own career. I
have a friend who complains she always plays the girlfriend--and
that's because she always accepts that kind of role." Being
selective, however, Falco says, "is scary business because acting
work is often not easy to come by."</TE>
<TE>   Even her preparation has had to change: "Whatever I do when I'm
working on a role--I hate the word 'research'; things feed me in ways
I don't know--I'm somewhat hampered now by the way I'm recognized. I
can't wander the streets anymore, which is what I've always done to
imagine what it was like to be other people. Now people no longer
behave naturally around me."</TE>
<TE>   This, even though in real life, Falco insists her own appearance
is the antithesis of Carmela. "I've always felt like a tomboy. I've
never been much of a girlie dresser, and if anything I've gone more
in that direction. At a certain point midseason I realized I was
dressing as such a slob: giant men's T-shirts, sneakers, a baseball
cap turned backward. I'm most comfortable in that place."</TE>
<TE>   On her ever-growing resume, Falco still has only one big-budget
Hollywood film--1999's "Random Hearts," with Harrison Ford, whose
humongous trailer impressed her almost more than her own part. One of
the decided advantages of Life With Carmela is that what Falco does
now "has gotta be something that interests me, that makes my heart
pound."</TE>

<HD>These Black-Clad 'Widows' Spin a Tangled Web</HD>
<DH>The American version of the 1983 British series has its
moments, but they are few and far between.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The popular 1983 British series "Widows" marked the first
women-in-crime success of writer Lynda La Plante, who went on to
create the oft-brilliant "Prime Suspect," which brightened PBS and
gave viewers fond memories of Helen Mirren as flawed, ambitious
police Inspector Jane Tennison, who rose in the ranks despite
opposition from her department's male coppers.</LD>
<LD>   "Widows" coincided in the U.S. with "Cagney and Lacey" when it
came to deploying women as serious players in crime drama. The
difference is that the women of "Widows" were on the other side of
the law.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes La Plante's Americanized lower-brow "Widows," which ABC
is rolling out on four successive Tuesday nights (starting tonight at
10), with Mercedes Ruehl as an aspiring art thief who involves three
other plucky women in her elaborate plan to lift a priceless Vermeer
from a gallery whose owner stole it himself.</LD>
<TE>   Although "Widows" begins as a crackling good mystery, the crackle
soon vanishes, as does the mystery, with La Plante's script evolving
slowly (paint dries faster) into that traditional male genre, the
caper story.</TE>
<TE>   "Widows" has its moments, nearly all of them centering on Ruehl as
Dolly Rawlins, whose art thief husband, Harry (Nigel Bennett), has
his own Vermeer heist in mind, a scheme violently aborted when he and
his partners are trapped in a van that is mysteriously smashed to
pieces and torched.</TE>
<TE>   While mourning him, Dolly has an epiphany. She'll do the heist
herself, with help from the widows (Brooke Shields and Rosie Perez)
of two of Harry's colleagues who were in the van with him and the
girlfriend (N'bushe Wright) of another man who was incinerated.
Meanwhile, Dolly is stalked by a Javert-style cop (Jay O. Sanders)
who is sure she's up to no good.</TE>
<TE>   Geoffrey Sax directs stylishly. As a caper tale, however, "Widows"
is pretty much a thrill-less stiff, even though it's refreshing to
have females in action roles that customarily go to males.</TE>
<TE>   But the heist gambit itself is absurd and antique (involving
another of those
hang-upside-down-to-beat-the-security-and-get-the-loot maneuvers).
Suspense? Don't ask. And attempts at humor fail. Wringing broad
comedy from Shields is like squeezing a Frappuccino from stone.</TE>
<TE>   Ruehl, an Oscar and Tony winner now appearing on Broadway in "The
Goat," has most of the credibility here. She fits nicely as a
criminal mastermind-come lately, getting points for swagger and
chutzpah. And if plans for a U.S. movie version of "Prime Suspect"
ever get beyond the talking stage, she'd be just the ticket as
Tennison.</TE>

<HD>A DVD Circus With 3 'Rings'</HD>
<DH>Movies* A basic version is on sale now. But coming extended
and collector's editions try fans' patience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To buy now or to buy later? That is the question, at least for fans
of Peter Jackson's Oscar-winning "The Lord of the Rings: The
Fellowship of the Ring."</LD>
<LD>   Today, New Line Home Entertainment is releasing the DVD ($30) and
VHS ($23) of the Hobbit blockbuster based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved
fantasy. But in the wings is an extended version set for release Nov.
12 ($40 for DVD; $25 for VHS) and a collector's DVD set ($80) that
includes the extended version plus custom-designed bookends.</LD>
<LD>   "The Lord of the Rings" is one of many high-profile films to be
released on video and DVD in two editions. Last December, for
example, in conjunction with the 60th anniversary of Pearl Harbor,
Disney's Touchstone released an edition of "Pearl Harbor" on DVD that
featured a few extras but no commentary from director Michael Bay.
Last month, another version was unveiled, this time with numerous
commentary tracks, including one with Bay, along with the director's
cut of the war epic and several featurettes and documentaries.</LD>
<TE>   Choosing between various versions of a film is "frustrating,
because this is becoming the norm instead of the exception," says
Natalia Shilkevich, an administrative analyst for the state of New
Jersey. She preordered the theatrical version of "The Lord of the
Rings" on DVD but canceled a few weeks ago when she learned from her
sister about the extended edition.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Lasorsa, senior vice president of marketing for New Line Home
Entertainment, says the company is "extremely sensitive" to
consumers' complaints about being confronted with different DVDs of a
film. As Touchstone did with "Pearl Harbor," New Line is offering
rebates for those who want to purchase both editions of "The Lord of
the Rings": Buy the one coming out today and get $5 off the extended
version or $10 off the special collector's set.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoopee," Shilkevich responds with mock enthusiasm. She says New
Line should have simply waited to release the film on VHS and DVD
until all the elements were in place.</TE>
<TE>   But given the commercial and critical success of "The Lord of the
Rings," the company wanted to get it on the home video market as soon
as possible. "In an ideal world, we would have had everything
available by August. But it just wasn't going to happen," Lasorsa
says.</TE>
<TE>   Director Jackson was too tied up in post-production in his native
New Zealand on the next installment of the Tolkien trilogy, "The Two
Towers," set for theatrical release in December, to get the extended
cut of "The Lord of the Rings" ready for August.</TE>
<TE>   To alleviate negative feedback, he says, "we have already made the
November release available for presale with retailers. There is
plenty of information out there with the November release, so
somebody isn't going into August buying blind without knowing what is
available in November."</TE>
<TE>   But "Lord of the Rings" aficionado Rob Noblin didn't know of the
second release until a friend told him last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have run out and gotten the first one, and I would have
been pretty upset that there were two," says Noblin, an attorney in
Los Angeles. "It kind of reminds me of when soundtracks started
selling well in the '80s: They would hold back enough songs for a
second album, and you would pay twice. It is like they are
undercutting their customers."</TE>
<TE>   The good news for fans is that the two-disc DVD being released
today and the four-disc set arriving Nov. 12 will have no overlapping
product. In fact, today's release will be the only place they can see
a 10-minute preview of "Two Towers."</TE>
<TE>   The two-disc set--which is available in pan-and-scan and
wide-screen versions--has no commentary but does contain three hours
of extra material, including 15 featurettes that originally appeared
on the lordofthe rings.net site.</TE>
<TE>   The extended version of the film will feature an extra half hour
of footage that was cut from the theatrical release. "There was a lot
of pressure on Peter to bring 'Lord of the Rings' in under three
hours theatrically," Lasorsa explains.</TE>
<TE>   "From a theatrical standpoint, there was an agreement made between
Peter and the studio that an extended version of the movie would be
created for the video market and released before 'Two Towers,' " he
says. "One of the other challenges we had is that Peter didn't want
this to appear as just the theatrical version with clips thrown in.
So it required a new score and new special effects."</TE>
<TE>   The extended version will feature four audio commentaries,
including one with Jackson and the writers and another with the cast.</TE>
<TE>   Noblin says he will probably buy the theatrical version now and
rent the extended one later. Shilkevich, on the other hand, plans to
wait for the extended version. "It gets to be pricey," she says. "In
the meantime, I can rent the movie if I need a fix."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Lasorsa admits that New Line is already thinking about
an ultimate boxed set of all three "Lord of the Rings" films in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "But just like what we are doing with August and November,
anything that comes out later will be something that will not feel
like you already own it," he says.</TE>

<HD>River City Slickers</HD>
<DH>Eric McCormack, Kristin Chenoweth amp up 'Music Man'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ardent fans of the NBC comedy "Will &amp; Grace" might be aware that Eric
McCormack, who plays Will, went to Broadway last year as a temporary
replacement in the lead role of scamp Harold Hill in Susan Stroman's
revival of "The Music Man." McCormack brought that performance to Los
Angeles on Sunday night at the Hollywood Bowl, paired with powerhouse
musical theater veteran Kristin Chenoweth as the prim librarian
Marian who falls for him in Meredith Willson's brassy ode to
small-town Americana circa 1912.</LD>
<LD>   In the role that made Robert Preston a star in 1957, McCormack
proved himself a more-than-capable singer and dancer, but it was his
nimble body language that was most notable in bringing to life one of
musical theater's most famous con men. Harold is described by the
town mayor (Lenny Wolpe) as "slipperier than a Mississippi sturgeon,"
and indeed McCormack oozed across the stage with a subtle athleticism
and noxious charm, his white suit becoming more and more ironic as
his murky intentions in River City became clear.</LD>
<LD>   He is a gifted physical comedian, which he established early on,
strutting through the famous set piece "Trouble," disguising his
chicanery as moral instruction on the evils of billiards. He
repeatedly brought some welcome lift to a book that is truly a museum
piece now, corny even for Iowa, where Willson is from and the story
is set.</LD>
<TE>   But it was Chenoweth who provided most of the musical highlights,
lending her amplified operatic vibrato to "Goodnight, My Someone,"
"My White Knight" and Marian's climactic declaration of love, "Til
There Was You," which many people of a certain age once thought was a
Beatles song after the group recorded it. (She will be seen singing
these same songs this fall when she plays Marian to Matthew
Broderick's Harold in a television adaptation of "The Music Man" for
ABC.)</TE>
<TE>   The show's signature tune remains the stridently jolly
"Seventy-Six Trombones," sung by McCormack and the assembled
townsfolk to describe the marching band Harold has promised to
fashion from the raw talent of River City's youth. No doubt inspired
by Willson's former service in John Philip Sousa's band, the song is
aptly symbolic of a kind of musical bombast called for in the book
but is reprised so many times in one form or another that it
inevitably passes beyond parody into celebration--a problem for
anyone who doesn't think the song is more than noisy carnival kitsch.</TE>
<TE>   The cavernous Bowl is anything but an easy setting for theater,
and how far up the hillside the audience could read the nuances of
the action is best known to the patrons who brought binoculars.
Director Gordon Hunt often filled the big stage with more than a
score of townsfolk and principals arrayed in a massive semicircle of
chairs, and choreographer Kay Cole managed to stretch the
high-stepping, petticoat-baring hoedown numbers to parade length.</TE>
<TE>   At the climax of "Seventy- Six Trombones," McCormack marched out
onto the runway that juts across the inner circle of box seats,
getting closer to the crowd. He and Chenoweth did the same during the
"Til There Was You" scene, which ended with the special tension of
wondering how the two actors managed to kiss without dislodging each
other's head microphones.</TE>
<TE>   But even before Broadway went electric, "The Music Man" was wobbly
as drama, creating a hero out of a fast-talking charlatan skilled in
the art of fleecing Midwestern rubes until he is transformed by the
love of a good librarian. It's the broadest of sentimental ideas, and
it's astonishing--or maybe not, given the vicissitudes of taste and
fashion--that in the 1957-58 season "The Music Man" debuted on
Broadway, it trounced Bernstein-Sondheim's "West Side Story" at the
Tonys and even won a Grammy for best cast album, as Bowl orchestra
conductor John Mauceri imprudently pointed out in his introduction.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not you regard that as a travesty of judgment, you can
appreciate the skills Hunt and Co. brought to this one-night
resurrection of a landmark American musical, treasured now more than
ever perhaps as a homespun period piece. In addition to the
accomplishments of McCormack and Chenoweth, Lyle Kanouse as the
big-bellied salesman hot on Harold's trail, Brooks Almy as Marian's
Irish widow mother and Ruth Williamson as the mayor's gullible wife
each gave robust, winning performances.</TE>
<TE>   It may not have been "The Music Man" as Willson originally
intended it to be experienced in a theater, but in the one-and-only
theater for thousands at the Hollywood Bowl it was as good as could
be expected.</TE>

<LD>   New Line Will Pit Freddy Versus Jason</LD>
<LD>   Will the whole be more than the sum of its parts? New Line Cinema
will find out when it combines two of its leading franchises--its
Freddy Krueger horror series and its "Friday the 13th" movies,
Variety reports.</LD>
<TE>   In "Freddy vs. Jason," Robert Englund will be back for his eighth
performance as Freddy Krueger. No actor has yet been cast in the role
of Jason, the lumbering maniac making his 11th appearance on screen.
Hong Kong's Ronny Yu ("The Bride With White Hair," "Bride of Chucky")
is set to direct the project, written by Mark Swift and Damian
Shannon.</TE>
<TE>   The film is due to begin shooting in Vancouver in September,
hoping to get a jump on projects such as 20th Century Fox's "Predator
vs. Alien" and Warner Bros.' "Batman vs. Superman." And New Line is
also milking another franchise--giving the green light to "Dumb and
Dumberer," a "Dumb &amp; Dumber" prequel due to hit the theaters next
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Amateurs Shoot Again for the Gold Ring</TE>
<TE>   The second installment of Project Greenlight has been given a go.</TE>
<TE>   The filmmaking competition, conducted by Miramax Films, HBO and
LivePlanet, gave winner Pete Jones ("Stolen Summer") the chance to
direct his own movie while being filmed by HBO. A warts-and-all
documentary chronicling the challenges of a first-time director was
nominated for an Emmy after running on the network.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, two amateur talents will have a chance to show
their wares. Instead of a single writer-director, there will be a
winner in each of those categories. The two will be partnered in the
making of a film, again to be distributed by Miramax with a
guaranteed minimum budget of $1 million.</TE>

<TE>   Pictures of J.Lo, Affleck Trigger a Bidding War</TE>
<TE>   People magazine won a bidding war against Us Weekly, paying what
experts say is an astounding $75,000 for nine photos of Ben Affleck
and Jennifer Lopez. The couple, a hot item in the wake of the
singer's recent split from her husband, grace the covers of both
publications this week.</TE>
<TE>   The price paid for the photo series--which showed the duo in the
front seat of a Bentley convertible--reflects how high the stakes are
being raised in the competition between the magazines. People is the
most profitable magazine in the United States. And, though Us Weekly
is not yet in the black, its new editor, Bonnie Fuller, is putting on
the pressure. Photo experts told the New York Post that, in less
frantic times, the photos might have commanded about $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   A People spokeswoman denied that the price paid for the picture
was out of the ordinary since it featured "two of our A-list
celebrities."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, 39, and conductor-composer Andre
Previn, 73, were married in Manhattan last Thursday. Mutter has been
widowed for seven years while Previn has had four previous wives,
including jazz singer Betty Bennett and actress Mia Farrow.... Tobey
Maguire ("Spider-Man") will play a jockey in Universal Pictures'
"Seabiscuit," based on Laura Hillenbrand's bestseller, for
writer-director Gary Ross. According to the Hollywood Reporter, he'll
receive more than $12 million.... Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart
Festival Orchestra ended its strike over the weekend, but the
settlement came too late to reschedule the group's canceled summer
concerts....Things went so well during the weekend reunion concert of
the Grateful Dead's surviving members in East Troy, Wis., that the
band--now called the Other Ones--has decided to go ahead with a fall
tour, their publicist said Monday. But Dennis McNally didn't know
when tickets would go on sale for the 15-show arena tour of the
Midwest and East Coast in November and December.</TE>

<HD>Lawrence's 'Runteldat' a Box-Office Surprise</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While most eyes this past weekend were on the $60-million opening for
M. Night Shyamalan's "Signs," some in the industry noticed a smaller
film that got off to a surprisingly big start. The concert film
"Martin Lawrence Live: Runteldat" took in an impressive $7.4 million
in only 752 theaters over the weekend, finishing No. 4 at the box
office, ahead of such heavyweights as "Road to Perdition," "Stuart
Little 2" and "Men in Black II."</LD>
<LD>   The film brought in $9,806 per theater, coming in second only to
"Signs" in per-theater average. The Lawrence film follows on the
breakout success of the comedy concert film "The Original Kings of
Comedy," released in August 2000, that also featured African American
comedians and took in nearly $40 million.</LD>
<LD>   That film reminded Hollywood executives that certain popular
stand-up comedians can bring in box-office gold. Richard Pryor's
electrifying concert films in the late '70s and early '80s were both
critical and commercial hits; Eddie Murphy's 1986 concert film "Raw"
grossed $50 million.</LD>
<TE>   Lawrence--whose other concert film, "You So Crazy" (1994),
performed modestly--saw an opportunity in following "Kings," studio
executives said.</TE>
<TE>   "Martin approached us," said David Gale, senior vice president for
MTV Films, which co-produced the film with Lawrence's company. "He
saw the 'Kings of Comedy' success.... I think that [live stand-up
show] surprised people in how it could translate into a viable
theatrical movie."</TE>
<TE>   That film also helped boost the careers of its comic stand-up
stars Bernie Mac, Cedric the Entertainer and Steve Harvey--many of
whom were known mainly in the African American community before the
film. Gale said he has since received scores of pitches from wanna-be
comedians wanting to follow in the footsteps of "Kings," including
the "Latin Kings of Comedy," "The Gay Kings of Comedy" and "The
White-Trash Kings of Comedy." Only the Latin Kings have been filmed
but it likely will be released on television, not in theaters.</TE>
<TE>   "Runteldat's" success is a welcome sign for Lawrence, a sometimes
troubled performer who has experienced several high-profile problems,
including brushes with the law. But rather than avoiding his past,
the comedian and the studio used the negative publicity as part of
the teaser campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing the audience has loved about this movie is that they
learn more about Martin Lawrence--kind of how Richard Pryor shared a
bit of Richard in his stand-up," said Rob Friedman, CEO and vice
chairman of the motion picture group at Paramount, which distributed
"Runteldat."</TE>
<TE>   The movie, which is rated R, cost only $3 million to make and more
than $10 million to market--and is likely to make the studio a hefty
profit. Having learned from "The Original Kings of Comedy," the
studio's advertising focused not only on African Americans but also a
broader audience.</TE>
<TE>   The key to success seems to be MTV, which co-produced the film and
heavily promoted it on its late-night television programs for the
18-and-over crowd. The network made special spots adding clips from
the live show but also featuring interviews with Lawrence.</TE>

<HD>Freedom Extends Only So Far</HD>
<DH>Energetic 'Move/Let Us Listen' is more structured than
improvised</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Take four talented, creative dancers and musicians. Put them in a
space at the Los Angeles Central Library with a small stage but wide
aisles and balconies where performers could be situated. Set up
improvisational structures or game plans for a six-part
collaboration. Then work to see what the relationships between the
participants, the venue and the chosen tasks, themes or subjects
might yield.</LD>
<LD>   "Move/Let Us Listen" certainly had its agenda clearly defined on
Sunday afternoon in the library's 235-seat Mark Taper Auditorium. If
anything, the expressive points of departure for this event in the
library's "Soundings" performance series seemed far more potent than
the ones fueling a previous improvisational project for choreographer
Loretta Livingston and composer Robin Cox at Cal State L.A.</LD>
<LD>   But this time the Livingston and Cox ensembles looked locked down
and over-directed--nearly as specifically controlled at every moment
as they would have been in formal choreography or conventional
music-making.</LD>
<TE>   Quotes and reminiscences on the program sheet set up the context
for each portion of the performance. A statement about freedom from
painter Pablo Picasso, for example, conditioned "The Forked Road."
However, for all their energy and expertise, the dancers and
musicians never seemed free here or not free, just hectically working
through an assignment.</TE>
<TE>   With the musicians setting up a nervous, clockwork pulse from the
stage, the dancers spread out to the edges of the forestage, the
front balcony and the center aisle, executing the designated
processes in their own ways and then switching positions with one
another.</TE>
<TE>   Livingston briefly stroked Johnny Tu's head during one such shift,
but opportunities for contact remained unexplored throughout the
afternoon. Yes, dancers and musicians marched together in "The Rhythm
Diaries," and clarinetist Elena Weber even joined a group sprawl. But
"The Porch" section lacked any of the family cohesion evoked in its
printed quote from architect Charles W. Moore, fragmenting instead
into simultaneous, scattered gestural riffs that might have seemed
compelling in solos but looked pointlessly busy en masse.</TE>
<TE>   During the "Whisper and Shout" finale, the most overtly emotional
segment of the afternoon, Heather Gillette took Tu's hand and he
passively partnered her. A little later, Livingston leaned into him
and, for a moment, he let his head drop onto her neck. But she
quickly whirled away and everyone sank into chairs for the fade-out.</TE>
<TE>   The dancing proved faultlessly adroit and resourceful. But this
observer felt that "Move/Let Us Listen" ended exactly where it should
have begun: with feelings, relationships and connections that needed
to be tracked, whatever the quoted pretext was supposed to be. All
the dancers found individual approaches to their duties--Alyson
Little Jones' tendency to turn the Taper into an imaginary swimming
pool, for instance, or Tu's full-tilt athleticism. But their
activities rarely linked up in a single satisfying action or image.
So, ultimately, it made more sense to watch and enjoy the
contributions of any one dancer than view the larger picture, in
which the components canceled each other out.</TE>
<TE>   It proved harder to guess the improvisational options and
contributions of the musicians: Cox, Weber, Erik Leckrone and Eric
Mellencamp. Reverberant with bell tones but driven by violin or
clarinet, the music came in cycles, always about to go somewhere but
cleverly doubling back.</TE>
<TE>   Since so much improvisational performance reeks of navel-gazing
and self-indulgence, you can understand why Livingston and Cox would
want to set up a structural safety net against such excesses. But
what an audience wants from serious improvisation is something deeper
or more revealing than conventional art-making. And "Move/Let Us
Listen" turned out to be something less.</TE>

<HD>Midlife Worries Frame 'Grace's' Perspective</HD>
<DH>Heather McDonald's new play is gracefully written, but the
details--and there are many--prove devilish.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LA JOLLA--A senator's wife is missing. Margaret Grace Braxton's
abandoned car has been discovered outside her son's school.</LD>
<LD>   Besides her claim to fame, Margaret is a mother of three and a
daughter whose parents' deaths prompt her to think a lot about her
own mortality.</LD>
<LD>   She's also the centerpiece of Heather McDonald's "When Grace Comes
In," a lyrical and excessively languorous new play at La Jolla
Playhouse.</LD>
<TE>   "When Grace Comes In" asks us to spend nearly three hours
examining Margaret's midlife crisis in painstaking detail. The
strangest thing about it is that Margaret doesn't seem all that
depressed.</TE>
<TE>   Despite many references to the character's sadness, Jane Beard
portrays Margaret as oddly upbeat, even cheery. In a way, this is a
relief; the play would seem longer if Margaret were unremittingly
dour or despairing. Yet Margaret's demeanor leads one to wonder why
her crisis is compelling enough to merit this much attention.</TE>
<TE>   By the end, it appears that Margaret's main problem--aside from
the usual issues that most people face as they pass through middle
age--is that two decades ago she gave up her budding career as an art
restorer to marry a law student who would soon represent Utah in
Congress. She has since been caught up in the effort of raising their
three kids.</TE>
<TE>   Now, facing her own sense of the years passing, she decides to
seize the day--first by taking a unscheduled 24-hour sabbatical
inside the National Cathedral, enjoying the light and the vastness,
and later by making a decisive return to her career. Apparently
without telling anyone where she's going, she takes a job in Venice.</TE>
<TE>   The play hardly raises the question of whether there might have
been some middle course. We do glimpse Margaret working as a
volunteer docent at the National Gallery. Still, with all of the
government-funded museums in Washington, surely a well-trained art
student who's married to a senator might find paid employment,
perhaps even with an occasional trip to Italy. That this possibility
is never mentioned makes the play seem like a throwback to the days
when a senator's wife would never look for a paying job.</TE>
<TE>   For that matter, McDonald never addresses the special pressures of
being a political wife. Although there is a brief reference to the
endless quality of campaigning, we never see Margaret in the trenches
of Utah. From what we see of her husband, he could just as easily
have a high-pressure corporate job in any other big city.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, we hear Margaret's dreams, most of them involving water.
We learn that her father drowned, and we see her mother slipping away
into a watery illusion (the stage directions in the script say the
mother has Alzheimer's, but this isn't clear in the dialogue) and
quite literally going to join her father in a kind of afterlife.</TE>
<TE>   We see Margaret's special bonding with her son. In a streamlined
flashback, Margaret and her husband meet in New York, and we sense
their sexual sparks. We hear Margaret talking to a late-night radio
call-in host.</TE>
<TE>   Much of this is written with, well, grace. McDonald, whose "An
Almost Holy Picture" was at La Jolla in 1995 and on Broadway earlier
this year, is a gifted imagist. But her ear fails her in strained
burlesque-style fantasy scenes involving an eccentric Polish
paleontologist, whose diagnosis compels Margaret to take action.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Ott's staging is immaculate, with spare but suggestive
design elements, including a complex soundtrack. But the effort is
disproportionate to the rewards.</TE>
<TE>   "When Grace Comes In," La Jolla Playhouse, La Jolla Village Drive
and Torrey Pines Road. Tuesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays-Sundays,
2 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. $39-$49. (858) 550-1010. Running time: 2
hours, 50 minutes.</TE>

<LD>Unreal. No other word could quite describe "The Real World Movie: The
Lost Season."</LD>
<LD>   Conceived by MTV as comedy-drama, this 90-minute feature contains
little of either. It premieres tonight at 9.</LD>
<LD>   Whereas the real "The Real World" can draw in viewers with
soap-operatic stories, this fake "Real World" largely repels with
self-indulgent, inside-baseball references to past characters and
plot lines, as well as elements of "The Blair Witch Project" added
for the heck of it.</LD>
<TE>   That's not to say the original series--which will begin its 12th
season in Nevada, in Sin City itself, come September--reflects
reality all that much either. It brings together seven young adults
in outrageously furnished quarters and lets human nature take its
course, as the cameras record everything, natch. Indeed, it's the
godfather of shows such as CBS' "Big Brother" and "Survivor" or Fox's
"Temptation Island."</TE>
<TE>   A big problem with tonight's film is that there is not even a
semblance of pseudo-reality to make the vapid dialogue and plot worth
paying attention to, nor is it over-the-top enough to be consistently
funny. Plus, you pretty much have to be well-versed in "The Real
World" to appreciate the jokes.</TE>
<TE>   The basic premise is this: Fictional "Real World" participants
start out in their Vancouver house, and the usual conflicts and
couplings begin. On their way to a "physical challenge" competition,
in which they will vie against people played by actual alumni of the
"Real World" series, they are hijacked by a nut job (Bryan Kirkwood)
who has created his own house full of surveillance equipment. It's
also packed with explosives, should they try to escape.</TE>
<TE>   Endless games of "Truth or Dare," as well as other "Real World"
staples such as "confessionals," ensue. I'll pick "truth": It's
probably better to skip this show and get on with your own real life.</TE>

<HD>Experiments Take Festival to Frontier of Sound</HD>

<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Experimentalism is attitude turned into action. Old norms are
undermined and reassembled according to fresh perspectives. At the
fifth annual Beyond Music Sound Festival over the weekend at Beyond
Baroque in Venice, experimenters staked out interests loosely linked
to curator Brandon LaBelle's themes of space, language and body.</LD>
<LD>   That resulted Saturday night in works that oscillated between
music, sound and the final frontier of noise, pushing machinery, such
as laptops, into secondary roles. Chicago-based Olivia Block, for
example, generated sounds from a metal pan filled with assorted
ingredients and equipped with a contact microphone, then processed
and distributed them in a sensuous rumble, always accenting the
source's physicality.</LD>
<LD>   An impressive electronic musician, New Yorker Stephen Vitiello is
a site-specific thinker who gives ambient music his own kind of
punch. He blended colorful static, throbbing hums, echoing clacks and
other real-time noise with gruff elegance.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles' Damion Romero sought to render sound as a bodily
presence in itself, relying on dense, loud, low tones to grip the
room and the listener's sternum. Physicality went a step further in
Arizonan Jeph Jerman's piece, performed with quasi-shamanistic
theatrics on natural found objects--rocks, bones and the like--to
surprisingly musical effect.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday night, a festival-adjunct presentation at Art Center
in Pasadena featured Yasunao Tone. Tone's fascinating CD-ROM works
are based on the visual-to-sound translation of Chinese calligraphy.
Insisting that he's interested only in "pure noise" and not in
composition, he inspired a heckler to ask, "Then what good are you?"
With a grin, Tone explained: "I don't project myself into the noise;
it's open to the audience.' "</TE>
<TE>   And that's experimentalism.</TE>

<LD>IN AMERICA'S COURT</LD>
<LD>   How a Civil Lawyer Who Likes to Settle Stumbled Into a Criminal
Trial</LD>
<LD>   By Thomas Geoghegan</LD>
<TE>   New Press</TE>
<TE>   208 pages, $23.95</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Geoghegan is a practicing labor lawyer whose previous work
("Which Side Are You On?") won critical acclaim for its exploration
of justice and unions. His newest book, "In America's Court," is a
two-part tale of Geoghegan's experience as a veteran Chicago civil
attorney trying his first (and only) criminal case, followed by his
opinions about our legal system's failings and future.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghegan had been needling a public defender friend for years,
jokingly offering to help him on a criminal trial. One day, the
friend asks Geoghegan to be "second chair" on an appeals case for a
young man, Rolando, who was convicted of murder at age 15 and who has
spent seven years incarcerated, waiting for this second chance to
prove his innocence.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear why the public defender would want Geoghegan to
help; Geoghegan apparently has never really wanted to work on a
criminal case. In fact, before the hearing, Geoghegan doesn't bother
to read the file nor in any other way prepare for the case.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghegan is jocular, portraying himself as an adventuring
pinstriped "Loop" lawyer, gallantly taking part in the case, which is
held not in the nice civil courtrooms, he takes pains to point out,
but at the unpalatable Chicago Criminal Courts Building that doesn't
offer a Starbucks. "If I stayed down here, what could I even drink?
Coke?" Though he has practiced law in the city for more than two
decades, he doesn't know where the Criminal Courts Building is, and
shows up late the first day, confused and helpless.</TE>
<TE>   The main reason for wanting to help the public defender, Geoghegan
tells us, is that as a civil attorney arranging settlements, he
doesn't feel he's accomplishing anything meaningful. "When my cases
don't go to trial," he laments, "I don't have anything to show." Yet
for all his professed willingness to assist, he continually points
out that he's a very busy man and has better things to do than sit in
this disgraceful building.</TE>
<TE>   What follows is a blow-by-blow description, not so much of the
trial but of Geoghegan's wide-eyed reaction to it. The writing in
this section is shoddy, as if the attorney used his Dictaphone to
draft the book. "[L]et's press the Pause button on Homer and go back
to [the public defender] and how he told Rolando's story," he writes.
(In an aside, Geoghegan mentions that lawyers tend to listen to audio
books these days rather than read them, citing eye strain from
overwork. "That's why for a lawyer like me, a real story is too long
to read," he tells the readers of his story.)</TE>
<TE>   During the voir dire jury selection process, he gives us his raw
notes, those taken in court and those added later, about prospective
jurors. These off-the-top-of-his-head comments add up to little.</TE>
<TE>   Attempting to create dramatic scenes, Geoghegan relies heavily on
ellipses, italics, stammering dialogue and exclamation points. For
instance: "I saw ... I ... Well, I saw ... a cage, iron bars,
something that as a lawyer I had never seen before, except on TV. And
I was irked, because I knew I should have expected this."</TE>
<TE>   The tone is colloquial, as if he's passing an afternoon with a
beer. The story, he makes clear, is more about him and how he sees
the world than about the fate of the young man in question.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the book's first three-quarters, Geoghegan abandons his
strengths as a writer and jurist, providing not a thoughtful
examination of criminal court proceedings but a kind of bewildered "A
Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" point of view. Would that
he stayed true to his abilities.</TE>
<TE>   The reader soon gets fed up with his rant, which is unfortunate
because buried beneath his verbal wanderings are the real points of
the tale: that America should consider ratifying the U.N.
International Convention on the Rights of the Child, which has been
ratified by almost every country in the world; that we should honor
the U.N. treaty we signed on the elimination of racial
discrimination; and that we should turn away from our propensity for
locking up underprivileged youths, a case for which he makes a valid
argument.</TE>
<TE>   The final section, "That's Why You Go to Law School," is engaging,
giving insight into how our legal system operates today and how
presidential appointments of judges affect the system. Here,
Geoghegan outlines his dream of international law superceding many
aspects of our national system.</TE>
<TE>   In this slim segment, Geoghegan demonstrates his ability to
explain the holes in our legal system, envision new ways of
considering the law and work for these changes.</TE>
<TE>   It's a shame that one must wade through the bulk of the book to
get to a place worthy of his talents.</TE>

<HD>Mini Monuments to Immense Tragedy</HD>
<DH>Models of such icons as the World Trade Center transform
the idea of the souvenir</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CINDY CHANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those little plastic likenesses of the Empire State Building or the
Eiffel Tower, mounted on key chains and sold in ground-floor gift
shops, may be schlock to some, but they serve a purpose. They say to
friends, to neighbors, to the tourists themselves 20 years hence: I
have been there.</LD>
<LD>   Then there's Oklahoma City, Waco, the World Trade Center. We've
all been there too, not physically, perhaps, but through the images
played over and over on television as tragedy and destruction struck
those places. As a nation, we have erected memorial parks and
monuments to pay tribute to those whose lives were lost, to help us
remember. There are more personal ways to remember too, ways that,
like those little plastic likenesses, are small and portable
souvenirs, if not quite so cheap.</LD>
<LD>   Constantin Boym, head of the New York design firm Boym Partners,
got the inspiration for his Buildings of Disaster series--miniature
models of places where disaster has struck--while watching the
nonstop news coverage of the April 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.</LD>
<TE>   "It occurred to me that day watching the 24-hour news coverage how
this totally unknown, nondescript building suddenly became this
universally recognized icon," Boym said. "I started thinking this
could be almost an alternative history of architecture. Here are
these buildings that are famous not because of their architectural
qualities but because of a tragic event that occurred there."</TE>
<TE>   The Buildings of Disaster series turns the concept of the souvenir
on its head as well, using a form that usually commemorates a happy
event--a vacation, a visit to a long-admired landmark--to instead
commemorate a tragic one. At $95 apiece, the Buildings of Disaster
models are carefully crafted--individually cast of bond- ed nickel
and hand-finished--and weighty, as much as a pound for a model only a
few inches high.</TE>
<TE>   The series, which debuted in 1998, initially included models of
the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, with pieces of the damaged structure
strewn around its base; the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas;
the World Trade Center after the 1993 bombing; the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building in Oklahoma City, one entire face reduced to a pile
of rubble; the Watergate Hotel; Unabomber Ted Kaczynski's Montana
cabin; the Three Mile Island nuclear plant; the Branch Davidian
compound in Waco, tongues of flame spewing skyward; the deadly
bonfire at Texas A&amp;M University, listing to one side on the verge of
collapse; and O.J. Simpson's Ford Bronco being pursued by a phalanx
of squad cars.</TE>
<TE>   But after Sept. 11, the Buildings of Disaster series, like so much
else, dropped its ironic overtones and took on a more serious cast.
Orders poured in for the 1993 World Trade Center model, so Boym
decided to create a model of the World Trade Center in the early
stages after the Sept. 11 attack--with gashes carved into its upper
stories--as well as a model of the damaged Pentagon. Part of the
proceeds, roughly $10,000, Boym said, from the sales of these two
models will be donated to the Sept 11 Fund, set up by the New York
Community Trust and United Way of New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to continue, and we have to remember. The memory
dimension is very important.... There's a big personal dimension.
These are private memorials rather than public memorials," Boym said.
One man put candles in front of his model of the World Trade Center,
creating an altar to the dead, Boym said. Another, a museum curator,
used the models as tools to teach her students some lessons about
history.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the idea of marking history, or the history that we
witnessed, with these little objects," said Lorraine Wild, a graphic
designer who bought models of the Unabomber cabin and the World Trade
Center from OK, a design store in L.A.'s Fairfax District.</TE>
<TE>   At OK one recent afternoon, the Buildings of Disaster models
repose on a lower shelf in a case displaying jewelry, glass bowls,
candleholders and vases of all shapes and hues. The small scale of
the models gives the viewer a god's eye perspective on the tragic
moments they depict. Pieces of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor are
strewn like a child's blocks; the caved-in section of the Pentagon is
only an inch or so across but represents an immeasurable amount of
human tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   The buildings that are physically damaged are obvious candidates
for the series. The ones that are intact, such as the Watergate Hotel
and the Unabomber's cabin, prompt reflection on what is "disastrous"
about the events that happened within them.</TE>
<TE>   Boym was initially reluctant to sell the models in stores, fearing
that customers without the benefit of a written explanation might see
just a cynical attempt to capitalize on tragedy. But that kind of
negative response did not materialize to any great extent, Boym said.</TE>
<TE>   OK owner Larry Schaffer hasn't heard much complaint about the
series either. "Our clientele is generally really, really
sophisticated. What people respond to is the irony," Schaffer said.
"The people who'd get [upset] at [the model of] Waco don't come into
our store."</TE>
<TE>   But one customer at OK said she found the World Trade Center and
Pentagon models disturbing. "You have to have stamina to have it on
your desk and be prepared to explain. Is it celebratory? Is it
anti-something? ... The Trade Center and the Pentagon, they're too
recent. They kind of give me the creeps," said Carol Clements, a
production designer.</TE>
<TE>   Customer Jeremy Podeswa, a film and television director who is
originally from Toronto, said he understood why many Americans were
unable to distance themselves from the events depicted in the models.
But the models make an important statement about present-day America,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The things we're most proud of we take home as souvenirs. Now,
when we represent America, part of the package is destroyed
buildings, America as discontented, America as affected by the rest
of the world," Podeswa said.</TE>

<LD>Where can you go to see a lion? To the zoo? The circus? On safari?</LD>
<LD>   Do you know that you can also see lions--and lots of other
animals--at an art museum? This lion, carved from sandstone in India
more than 1,800 years ago, does not reside at the zoo but at the
Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   Lion sculptures such as this one were placed at the doorways of
important buildings, especially temples and royal palaces. Doorway
guardians like this lion are called simhadvara. Simha means "lion"
and dvara means "door" in Sanskrit, an ancient language of India.
Lions were seen as powerful guardians that protected the people
inside. Noted for their loud roars, strength and pride, these kings
of the jungle were also associated with royalty.</LD>
<TE>   This decorative lion has a large, carefully groomed mane,
suggesting that someone took very good care of him. Look closely at
his expression and the tongue hanging out of his mouth. What words
would you use to describe the lion?</TE>
<TE>   The Norton Simon Museum has paintings and sculptures of lions,
cheetahs, elephants, monkeys, birds, boars, fish and more. Summer Fun
Days are from 1 to 2 p.m. every Thursday during August. This
Thursday's theme is "Spend an Afternoon at the Beach." Aug. 15 is "A
Trip to the Zoo" and Aug. 22 is "Making New Friends."</TE>
<TE>   For more information about the museum and to register for the
Thursday Summer Fun Days call (626) 844-6980 or visit www.nor

<HD>The World Is Their Canvas</HD>
<DH>'Artists in the non-art world' try to reshape the way we
think about man-made topography</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WENDOVER, Utah</DL>
<LD>If you had to pick just one landscape to illustrate the curious
obsessions of the L.A.-based Center for Land Use Interpretation, it
might be this haunted high-desert wasteland two hours west of Salt
Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   Glimpsed at 80 mph from the passing interstate, the stark panorama
blurs into a mirage of dazzling white salt flats ringed by scrubby
brown mountains. Here and there, a sun-bleached motel or abandoned
car announces humanity's presence. Superficially, it all could be
another generic Rand McNally dot on the epic canvas of the American
West.</LD>
<LD>   But if you scratch the surface--which, it might be said, is the
Center for Land Use Interpretation's primary reason for being--the
terrain begins to yield its bizarre treasures, revealing itself not
as a vast man-made junkyard but a kind of living museum where paradox
and contradiction are as common as sand in the Sahara.</LD>
<TE>   Under the blazing afternoon sky, Matt Coolidge, 35, surveys the
hallucinatory vista, his eyes veiled by a pair of dark sunglasses. If
he looks more like a CIA mole or Hollywood location scout than a
mild-mannered geography major from Montreal, well, Coolidge would be
the first to remind you that appearances can be misleading.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that narratives are told through a landscape as much
as they might be through a movie. You just have to learn how to read
the landscape," says the director of the center, an idiosyncratically
ambitious 8-year-old nonprofit that's trying to reshape the way
Americans see and think about their country's man-made topography.</TE>
<TE>   Like its even quirkier Culver City next-door neighbor the Museum
of Jurassic Technology, the center resides at a conceptual crossroads
where science, social history, environmental studies, art, folklore
and pop culture intersect. Imagine a gene-splicing experiment
involving the Sierra Club, the Smithsonian Institution, Outward Bound
and your favorite "The X-Files" episode and you may have a vague
sense of where this unclassifiable institution fits on the map.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a group that really exists in between a lot of our
conventional definitions," says Ralph Rugoff, an art critic and head
of the Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts at the California
College of Arts &amp; Crafts in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Adopting an approach that might be described as outsider science
meets gonzo tourism by way of contemporary art, Coolidge's group
employs a multimedia, multidisciplinary approach to shedding light on
places that, as he puts it, exist as much in most Americans'
"imaginations as in their actual experience." Seen through the
center's interpretive lenses, the American landscape turns out to be
a far more complicated, and revealing, place than can be conveyed in
iconic postcard vistas or captured in a day-tripper's mental
Polaroids.</TE>
<TE>   By giving people the tools to chip away at the crust of history,
myth, romance and language that encases our perceptions of
landscapes, the center hopes to bring viewers and visitors "closer to
the ground." "We like to say we work in the interpretive layer that's
between a physical object and the perception of that object," says
Coolidge.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sites You Won't</TE>
<TE>   Find in the Guidebooks</TE>
<TE>   Exhibit A is this deceptive void of Wendover, roughly an 11-hour
drive from the Culver City headquarters of the center, affectionately
known as CLUI (rhymes with "Huey"). As tourist draws go, it's not
exactly Disneyland, but CLUI regards it as pure analytical gold.</TE>
<TE>   Those pristine alkali flats Coolidge is pointing to? They're part
of a massive, and still very active, U.S. Air Force test-bombing
range. Those "desolate" ranges tapering toward the horizon? They're
strewn with local points of interest that you won't find listed in
many guidebooks, though you will find them cataloged in fascinating
detail on the center's Web site, www.clui.org. Among the attractions:
copper smelters, magnesium chloride plants, America's largest
chemical weapons storage facility, monumental outdoor "earth art"
works such as Robert Smithson's "Spiral Jetty" and a historic marker
indicating the site of a turn-of-the-century settlement-turned-leper
colony founded by Polynesian Mormons.</TE>
<TE>   At the edge of this arid expanse, awkwardly straddling the state
line, the Siamese-twin towns of Wendover, Utah, and Wendover, Nev.,
form an incongruous pit stop for weary big-riggers and low-rent
gamblers. From the Nevada side of the border, sparkling new casinos
glare across at crumbling bungalows and rows of ghostly military
barracks that have mostly stood empty since World War II.</TE>
<TE>   As for that ominous 50-foot tower, a rusting hulk that looks like
vintage 1940s, it's the handiwork of the Walt Disney Co., which built
it for its 1997 action thriller "Con Air." A few hundred yards away,
at the edge of a U.S. Air Force base, the "Con Air" plane sits
parked, surreally, next to a weather-beaten hangar that once housed
the Enola Gay, the aircraft that dropped the atomic bomb on
Hiroshima.</TE>
<TE>   CLUI revels in such mind-bending juxtapositions, which explains
why the center has established its largest off-site presence here.
Though it operates out of a remodeled 2,000-square-foot office
building on Venice Boulevard and also maintains a one-room Desert
Research Station in Barstow, 90 minutes northeast of L.A., CLUI has
made its small but growing compound of buildings in Wendover an
open-air laboratory for test-driving its large inventory of theories
and projects. Nothing here is quite what it seems, and the story that
you take home will partly depend on the story you came looking for.</TE>
<TE>   Coolidge recalls the sense of having struck pay-dirt when he and
other CLUI staffers first visited the area eight years ago. "As soon
as we rolled over that hill coming down the I-80 from Nevada into
Wendover," he says, "it was just like Mormons coming over the hill:
'This is the place!' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1994</TE>
<TE>   in the Bay Area</TE>
<TE>   Since 1994, when it was founded in the Bay Area, CLUI has been
scrutinizing the nation like a French deconstructionist perusing
"Finnegans Wake." From backwoods Maine to the Mojave Desert, it
approaches the American landscape as a giant, profoundly conflicted
text that must be sifted and mined for encrypted meanings, in keeping
with its official mission statement: "to increase and diffuse
knowledge about how the nation's lands are apportioned, utilized and
perceived."</TE>
<TE>   That rather bland-sounding credo, however, masks a considerably
more complex and subtle agenda. The brainchild of a group of former
college friends, several of whom were art students seeking a more
practical application of their talents and interests, CLUI has two
complementary personas. One is dry, scholarly and scientifically
neutral, the other elliptical, subversive and, in the words of
feminist art critic Lucy Lippard, purposefully "eccentric."</TE>
<TE>   Structured as a non-hierarchical collective of about 10 core
members, CLUI is augmented by an informal coast-to-coast network of
volunteers and specialists who rotate in and out on a
project-by-project basis and serve as field correspondents. The
majority are in their mid-20s to late 30s, and their backgrounds run
the gamut from geology and engineering to architecture, landscape
design, fine arts, video production, graphic arts, neurology, you
name it.</TE>
<TE>   Even they can't easily say where each of CLUI's identities begins
and ends. "It's funny: The center isn't exactly art, and it isn't
exactly an environmental activist group," says volunteer Zelig
Kurland, a student at L.A.'s avant-garde Southern California
Institute of Architecture. Not that Kurland and his colleagues are
eager to categorize CLUI: Their work, they believe, speaks for
itself--though you must listen closely to hear it.</TE>
<TE>   To date, the center's biggest single project has been assembling
and maintaining a massive database of man-made landscapes and sites.
Through painstaking field research, careful archiving of photos,
public records and other primary source materials, and lots of
constructive wandering around in the middle of nowhere, the center
has put together a detailed picture of nearly 3,000 "anthropic"
sites, or places made or altered by human beings.</TE>
<TE>   These range from the lethal to the vaguely ludicrous: abandoned
quarries, aborted hazardous waste incinerators; picturesquely
decaying resorts; "deleted communities" obliterated by reservoirs,
dams and other human interventions; obscure historical landmarks; and
other oddities. The center's goal is to expose and chronicle the
multiple narrative layers that tell the story, or stories, of a given
place. Eventually CLUI hopes to create 12 "interpretive nodes" around
the country, modeled on its Wendover facility.</TE>
<TE>   "We take a historical look at a contemporary landscape," says
Coolidge, savoring the concept's Zen koan-like qualities. In other
words, a toxic-waste dump can tell as much about today's system of
values as a pioneer cemetery tells about those of the past.</TE>
<TE>   Endorsing a notion of democratic accessibility, CLUI then makes
its research available, free, to any person or group that wants it,
for any purpose, as an educational public service. Several of its
remote facilities are open to visitors on a self-serve basis. Though
these buildings are kept locked, posted signs give visitors a
toll-free number to call. When they do, a recorded voice message
supplies the lock combination.</TE>
<TE>   What you do with the information you obtain is pretty much up to
you--an equal-opportunity approach that some find maddeningly
apolitical, but others deem a plus. "I think environmental people get
frustrated [with CLUI] because they say, 'Where's the political punch
line?' And Matt [Coolidge] adamantly refuses to deliver one," Rugoff
says. "That frustrates some people, but ultimately it makes the
project much more fluid and ultimately able to reach more people."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Using Art to Investigate</TE>
<TE>   the Landscape</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps what most distinguishes CLUI from the great, gray mass of
think tanks, intellectual clearinghouses and earnest environmental
groups is its ability to form alliances with artists and use art to
interrogate and respond to the landscapes it investigates.</TE>
<TE>   During its brief existence, the center has collaborated with many
artists and exhibited at institutions throughout the United States
and Europe, including L.A.'s Museum of Contemporary Art, MIT's List
Center for Visual Arts and the Center for Contemporary Art in
Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Over the past half-dozen years, CLUI has
mounted numerous photo-text exhibitions and sponsored other art
projects related to its research. It also runs a residence program
for artists at Wendover.</TE>
<TE>   The Wendover compound includes a remodeled, air-conditioned
trailer where staff and volunteers live and work, a studio for
visiting artists, a small gallery space and an exhibition hall where
the center keeps a permanent display on the region's startling array
of historic and contemporary land uses.</TE>
<TE>   CLUI's collaborations have made it as well-known among artists and
curators as it is to eco-heads and academics. "I think they [CLUI]
are artists in the non-art world. They've figured out a niche that's
missing in the art world," says Sue Spade, curator of the Cincinnati
Contemporary Art Museum, which worked with CLUI on a recent
exhibition "Ecovention: Current Art to Transform Ecologies."</TE>
<TE>   For that show, CLUI created 22 photo-text panels that examined
"superlative" Ohio sites, from a nuclear power plant to the nation's
last major surviving shoelace factory. Another recent CLUI exhibition
documented how the post-Sept. 11 installation of concrete berms and
bollards has transformed the elegant plazas of Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   It's not hard to detect a faint rhetorical giggle behind the
text's seeming objectivity. Photos also are shot in a way that
smudges the line between sober documentation and stylized "art
photography," making the familiar look slightly alien, the alien
strangely familiar.</TE>
<TE>   "The way they compose things, there's always something a little
off," Spade says. CLUI also publishes a monthly newsletter, the Lay
of the Land, and other publications written in scrupulously deadpan
prose.</TE>
<TE>   CLUI's projects have been sanctioned with critical praise and
dollars from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Lannan
Foundation, the LEF Foundation, the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs
Department and the Los Angeles County Arts Commission, among others.
It's a list that more conventional arts group would envy. "We've been
very fortunate that our supporters understand what we're doing and
don't want to mess with it," Coolidge says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Guided, Offbeat</TE>
<TE>   Bus Tours</TE>
<TE>   Periodically CLUI varies its repertoire by conducting guided bus
tours and other off-beat extracurriculars known as "extrapolative
projects." Lively, all-day affairs with themes such as "Antelope
Valley: The Cradle of Aerospace" and "Nellis Range Complex: Landscape
of Conjecture," these tours cater to the same bourgeois passion for
novelty and self-improving adventure as, say, a road trip to the
Getty.</TE>
<TE>   It's customary on such outings for CLUI staffers to provide
running commentary, pointing out legal bordellos, deserted 19th
century therapeutic bathhouses and other arcane landmarks frequently
"hidden" in plain sight. During lulls, participants may be regaled
with screenings of blandly officious government videotapes detailing
the marvels of the passing terrain--a 1950s nuclear test site, for
example, or the Hinkley Compressor Station, the PG&amp;E plant
immortalized in "Erin Brockovich." These might alternate with
"Zabriskie Point," Michelangelo Antonioni's 1970 art film on the
wretched excesses of American culture.</TE>
<TE>   One of CLUI's 1997 "hinterlands" tours of the Salton Sea and
Imperial Valley concluded at an abandoned yacht club on the north
shore of that noxious man-made reservoir. Waiters hired for the
occasion served cocktails to the tourists; hors d'oeuvres included a
variety of smoked, salted and dried fish.</TE>
<TE>   Now and then, CLUI tour buses will bring along a regional expert,
or "briefer," who'll hop aboard to discuss some aspect of the trip in
greater detail. One, Phil Patton, a journalist and author of
"Dreamland: Travels Inside the Secret World of Roswell and Area 51,"
accompanied a tour of the Nellis Range, a Connecticut-size chunk of
Nevada that encompasses the notorious Area 51, reputed site of secret
extraterrestrial comings and goings.</TE>
<TE>   Patton remembers the tour group as typical of CLUI's eclectic
constituency. "There are the sort of people who will go see Mel
Gibson in the crop-circles movie," he says. "Many of them also are
the military buffs. And there were a lot of movie people. I can't
break down how many were true nuts. A lot of people in the software
business are drawn to this kind of thing: There's symbology and
there's a system to be hacked."</TE>
<TE>   One of CLUI's ur-texts is Dean MacCannell's "The Tourist: A New
Theory of the Leisure Class" (Schocken, 1976). A behavioral sciences
scholar, MacCannell argued in his now-classic book that the tourist
had become the archetype of "modern-man-in-general." "Increasingly,
tourism is a point of view which we all share," Coolidge says.</TE>
<TE>   But does a site exist if no one's around to experience it? CLUI
has explored that issue, too, with its "Sound-Emitting Device
Project," which Coolidge describes as adding a sonic "vector" to the
experience of place. One such device, the "Water Ghost Installation,"
in the middle of dried-up Owens Lake, uses a solar-powered tape loop,
mounted in a box on a steel pole, to mimic the sound of running
water. The spectral noise evokes L.A.'s infamous water-rights wars
and creates a provocative aural/visual pun for the pleasure of the
few who happen upon it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little bit of a treasure hunt," says volunteer Lisa
Boulanger, referring to CLUI's stealthy stratagems. "It makes you a
little bit of a collaborator."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Turn Out the Lights</TE>
<TE>   and Lock Up'</TE>
<TE>   Twilight on the Utah salt flats. The mountains are sculpted in
primordial light, and one can easily imagine this place millions of
years ago as a vast inland sea. A breeze drifts across the plain, but
the real soundtrack is an engulfing stillness broken only by the
occasional whoosh of an 18-wheeler.</TE>
<TE>   It would be easy to romanticize such a landscape on such an
evening. But once you've looked at America through CLUI's eyes for a
few days, you're warier of such comforting conceits.</TE>
<TE>   At a time (post-Sept. 11) when many private companies and
government agencies are leery of dispersing details about their
affairs, CLUI has become a rare repository of reliable,
hard-to-obtain knowledge about the vast terra incognita we inhabit.</TE>
<TE>   All the center asks in return, Coolidge has said, "is that people
turn out the lights and lock up when they leave."</TE>
<TE>   Is that all, really? Not that democratic enlightenment isn't among
humanity's worthier goals.</TE>
<TE>   Is CLUI interested in beauty, a visitor asks? Or is "beauty" a
veil that keeps us from seeing the world around us, the world we
insist on steadily remaking in our own image?</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, people at the center are. I know I am," Coolidge replies
softly. "But some of the things I find beautiful are things that are
honest and clear. Isn't it Keats who said 'Beauty is truth?' There's
this aesthetic sense of truth that's like beauty. It's clarity. It's
the sense of things being true."</TE>

<HD>Marilyn Plays a Part in Their Lives</HD>
<DH>Fans come from around the world to mark the 40th
anniversary of a film legend's death, because ...</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No matter what Marilyn Monroe believed at the end of her life, she
could not have foreseen the vast extent of her legacy, could not have
imagined that 40 years after her death in 1962 at age 36, there would
be hundreds of flourishing Marilyn Monroe fan clubs worldwide, that
stores would still be full of Marilyn T-shirts, mugs, key chains,
calendars, masks and books (some by serious authors).</LD>
<LD>   She could certainly not have predicted that she would earn after
death what she never was granted in life: a kind of benevolent
family, a worldwide community of fans who want nothing from her, who
say they care deeply for her memory, respect her struggles, and
apologize for the mistreatment she received from all those men who
literally and figuratively handled her.</LD>
<LD>   Over the weekend, to honor the anniversary of Monroe's Aug. 5
death, some of those fans gathered in Los Angeles. They crossed
continents and oceans to be closer to the memory of the woman whose
blond buoyancy and baby doll demeanor belied the turmoil of her
life--the woman Truman Capote called "an untidy divinity, in the
sense that a banana split or cherry jubilee is untidy but divine."</LD>
<TE>   About 30 of those fans, many of whom were born long after
Marilyn's death, signed up for a five-hour tour Saturday of Marilyn's
homes and haunts around Los Angeles, an event organized by Leslie
Kasperowicz, 24, of the Immortal Marilyn club, and Jill Adams, 35, of
the Forever Marilyn club. The tour was part of a three-day
commemoration by various Marilyn fan clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Adams, who owns more than 200 books on Monroe, says her fandom
began when she read Norman Mailer's book on the actress and "realized
that she was this huge icon who was so fragile and vulnerable and
human."</TE>
<TE>   The tourists wore Marilyn T-shirts, tattoos, and hairdos;
picnicked on Marilyn paper cups and plates, photographed themselves
outside what was once the Los Angeles Orphan's Home, now called
Hollygrove, where the actress lived as a child, and the various
Beverly Hills homes where she later lived and died. They were an
intriguing assortment.</TE>
<TE>   Gia Woods, 20, of Las Vegas, who identifies herself as "an actress
and Christina Aguilera look-alike," took the tour "because nobody
today has Monroe's beauty or her talent. Plus, she started from
nowhere and attained her dream. I see her as an inspiration for me.
She's one of a kind."</TE>
<TE>   Caroline Krijnen, 35, a market researcher who came from Antwerp,
Belgium, for the Monroe event, says she first saw the actress at age
6. "She was so ahead of her time. She was one of the first to work
out, before people started talking about it. And one of the first
famous women to admit being sexually abused. She broke the barrier
there. She single-handedly changed the way things were done in
Hollywood, by starting her own company, MM Productions, in which she
owned 51% of the shares, and by producing pictures she wanted to
make. She didn't want to be the dumb blond anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Also on the tour were newlyweds Kim Kaine-Smith, 36, and husband
Sean Smith, 24, of Las Vegas. Kim, a professional Marilyn
impersonator at corporate wingdings, was wearing her Marilyn wig.
"I've loved her since I was 12, when my dad told me I looked like a
young Marilyn. When I turned 19 I dressed up like Marilyn and my mom
and I went to the Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park. The owner there
saw me and told me I could make money as her look-alike." Ross
McNaughton, 59, a travel agent from Wellington, Australia, has been a
Marilyn fan for 50 years, since he first saw a photo of her attending
a premiere. He cut it out of the magazine, and he's scooped up
"virtually every book or magazine that's come out on Marilyn " ever
since. "She had a mystique to which no one has come close ever since.
If she walked down the street now she would not look out of place."</TE>
<TE>   An Irish Marilyn Monroe fan club is run by Julie McIlmail, 25, a
public relations consultant in Belfast. "She was beautiful, talented,
and she's never gotten the credit she deserved," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Fifth-grade teacher Lisa Bates of Raven, Ky., says she became a
fan when she heard a Def Leppard song about Marilyn. "Then I read
Anthony Summers' biography, called 'Goddess,' and I was hooked. She
had a dream, she worked harder than most people who had fewer
obstacles, and she fulfilled her dream. It's so inspiring. She played
the best game with the worst hand of cards ... and she was surrounded
by people who were like leeches."</TE>
<TE>   Trino and Leja Chavez, both in their 20s, flew in from Chicago for
the tour. It was a big sacrifice to make to honor their heroine, they
said, because they have two babies at home and Trino was laid off
from his shipping clerk job at a Marshall Fields store after Sept.
11. "The bills are piling up no matter what we do--so we decided to
give ourselves this one treat," Leja Chavez said.</TE>
<TE>   Benice Cooper, 44, was also there. She loads cargo on airplanes at
Heathrow airport in England, and says her heroine has been Marilyn
for at least 25 years. "She was so talented, so underrated--but she
came out on top. She was a survivor--for as long as she could hold
on."</TE>
<TE>   The tour ended at a house in Brentwood that was the first home
Marilyn ever owned, and was where she died of a drug overdose. There
is Internet chatter among fans about one day purchasing the house
through combined donations and turning it into a shrine. There is
also talk about a possible Marilyn museum, for which her fans would
raise the money and maintain.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen Porter, 55, a financial director from Bedfordshire,
England, called herself "the oldest person on this tour." It pleased
her and her husband, Kevin, who runs a charity for homeless people,
to think that "so many young people are so fond of Marilyn Monroe."
The Porters began collecting Marilyn objects in their youth, dropped
out while they raised their family, and have now gotten back into
their hobby. The collection includes period magazines, plates,
calendars and figurines. "It's probably worth a lot of money," she
says, "but the money doesn't matter. I feel that if I had met her,
I'd have liked her. She was a good human being."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Watson, 47, a quality management director for an Austin,
Texas, aerospace firm, sports a Norma Jean tattoo on his arm. He says
he has all 10 Life magazines that featured Monroe on the cover. "I
also have 3,000 pictures of Marilyn on my computer," he adds. He is
one of the few who've seen the inside of Marilyn's Brentwood house.
He jumped the fence a few years back while it was unoccupied and
being renovated. "She's a big part of my life," he says.</TE>

<LD>Since last week, I've been waiting for readers to e-mail me in
droves, the way they did last month when basketball's bad boy, Allen
Iverson, was charged with a collection of crimes that could have
netted him 70 years behind bars.</LD>
<LD>   "I hope you've been following the adventures of your great love
interest, Allen Iverson, that cuddly, lovable guy you fawned over [in
a column] some time ago," one sarcastic reader crowed, in an e-mail
typical of more than a dozen I received labeling Iverson scum,
criminal, a thug, a jerk.</LD>
<LD>   Many readers seemed to take perverse delight in the news of his
criminal plight.</LD>
<TE>   But now that the case against Iverson has unraveled--he was
cleared last week of all but one minor charge--the silence from
readers is deafening.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, my column on Iverson--written last year when his
Philadelphia team faced the Lakers in the NBA playoffs--wasn't about
how cute or cuddly he was, but about the heart and passion he brought
to his game. The column, I thought, was relatively benign, and I
wasn't prepared for the umbrage it raised among folks determined to
see Iverson as nothing more than a pampered thug.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just a punk who's been blessed with athletic talent and
doesn't have the good sense to appreciate it," one reader wrote.
Others chastised me for making a hero out of a basketball player who
fought with his coach, recorded an obscene rap song, was once
arrested for carrying a pistol and served time in jail as a teenager
for a bowling alley brawl.</TE>
<TE>   That's why I wasn't surprised when his arrest became front-page
news and generated days of talk radio patter among folks eager for
the street-tough star to get his comeuppance.</TE>
<TE>   According to police, Iverson had forced his naked wife out of the
house during a domestic dispute, then gone looking for her with a
gun, barged into the apartment of a cousin and threatened two
acquaintances. He was charged with 14 criminal counts, including
felony weapons, trespass and conspiracy charges.</TE>
<TE>   But in court last week, a different story unfolded. The primary
witness said he never saw Iverson with a gun. His buddy didn't called
911 until 10 hours after the incident, and then only after a
20-minute phone conversation with a personal-injury lawyer. Later, he
reportedly told friends he would have recanted the story if Iverson
had paid him $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   And that stuff about Iverson throwing out his wife naked? That
came from that same discredited victim. There was no police report,
and Iverson's wife--who checked into a motel for two days--is back
home and isn't talking.</TE>
<TE>   The case against Iverson--which drew more police power that most
homicides in Philadelphia--amounted to nothing more than "a relative
looking for a relative at the home of a relative" the judge decided,
dismissing all but a misdemeanor charge of making "terrorist threats"
after six hours of testimony.</TE>
<TE>   But the verdict--Allen Iverson is an incorrigible thug--is still
the same in the eyes of many.</TE>
<TE>   "People have a vested interest in seeing Allen in a certain way,"
explains USC professor Todd Boyd, who has written extensively on the
cultural implications of sports in America. "The cornrows, the body
full of tattoos, the gangster hip-hop aesthetic. He looks like he
walked out of the penitentiary. When some people see Allen Iverson,
what they see is ... a thug in a basketball uniform."</TE>
<TE>   His is not exactly the image many parents want peering down from a
poster on junior's bedroom wall. Yet Iverson's inspired play on the
court, and his in-your-face individuality off the court, make him one
of the NBA's most popular players.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not Jordan, he's not Magic, he's not Kobe ... and he's not
trying to be," says Boyd, whose latest book "Young, Black, Rich and
Famous: 'Ball, Urban Culture and the Redefinition of the American
Dream" will be published by Random House in the spring. "Allen was
shaped by different things, and he refuses to bend to accommodate
what anyone else wants him to be. And for a large segment of the
population, the image he presents is threatening."</TE>
<TE>   His detractors were comforted by his brush with the law, because
it validated their disapproval of his lifestyle, his arrogance, his
unwillingness to look or act the part of a superstar.</TE>
<TE>   But if it's Iverson's impact on kids that troubles us, we need to
recognize that his image as iconoclast is part of the draw, part of
what makes his basketball jersey the NBA's top seller.</TE>
<TE>   Reader Carmen Wisdom said it best in response to my Iverson column
last time around: "I myself can't personally relate to Iverson's
tattoos, pantyhose headgear or choice of music," e-mailed Wisdom, who
teaches English in middle and high school in San Bernardino. "What I
can relate to is his determination to be himself. As the kids say, he
represents.</TE>
<TE>   "My students look at sleek, clean Michael Jordan, Derek Fisher,
Kobe Bryant and they see beautiful, skilled men. They do not
necessarily see themselves. They look at Iverson and there they are.
Scrappy kids from the mean streets, kids who don't have to suppress
their individual tastes and cultures to succeed."</TE>
<TE>   So we might as well make room for Iverson in our pantheon of
basketball heroes, because his appeal is not about to be undone by a
little brush with the law, or our hand-wringing over his homies or
his hair or his do-rag or his clothes. The heart he displays in his
play on the court is bigger than all of those.</TE>

<LD>"We're hiking to camp!" shouted Wolfman. "It's two miles north of
here. Any questions?"</LD>
<LD>   Devin's throat was dry. She wanted a drink of water, but most of
all she wanted to go home.</LD>
<LD>   "Which way is north?" asked Jack.</LD>
<TE>   "Follow me!" said Wolfman with a grin.</TE>
<TE>   The earth felt hard and dry under Devin's feet. She felt like she
was walking for two days instead of two miles. The 10 kids followed
Wolfman in silence, until they saw in the distance a shimmering lake.
Two cabins stood on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   Jack broke out in a run toward the water; the other kids followed.
At the edge of the lake were three canoes resting next to a small
wooden dock. Several lifejackets and paddles stood in a pile.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that Camp Rattlesnake?" Jack asked Devin, pointing across the
water.</TE>
<TE>   "It must be," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "How many of you have been in a canoe before?" asked Wolfman. One
girl raised her hand. "Everyone grab a lifejacket and a paddle!" said
Wolfman.</TE>
<TE>   Jack couldn't wait. He was the first to do what Wolfman said. Then
he stepped into a canoe. He tipped right over into the shallow water.
All the kids laughed, including Jack. Devin jumped in and helped him
up. Her shoes were soaked, but she didn't care. The cold water felt
good.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you all right?" asked Devin.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," said Jack. "I think I learned the first lesson."</TE>
<TE>   "Never stand in a canoe!" shouted Wolfman. "C-stroke! That's what
you're going to be doing with your paddle to get across this lake!
Everyone find a seat."</TE>

<HD>Forget Cell Phones; Coffee Is the Killer</HD>
<DH>Driving with your knees is no solution to the difficulties
of eating on the road, despite what some commuters think.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Do you have a year's supply of ketchup packets in your glove
compartment? Are you greeted at the Taco Bell drive-through window
with: "The usual, pal?" Has that new-car smell been replaced by
something that could be dubbed eau de deep fryer?</LD>
<LD>   You are not alone. The average American consumes 14 meals a year
in the car, up from about nine meals in 1984, according to a recent
national survey.</LD>
<LD>   The reason is simple: As drivers spend bigger chunks of each day
stuck in traffic, they are forced to make up for lost time. In
Southern California, motorists spend the equivalent of about 11 days
a year idling in traffic. Something has to give, and it's often a
leisurely sit-down meal.</LD>
<TE>   But if you are a regular dashboard diner, chew on this:
Food-related distractions were blamed for 259 accidents in California
last year, resulting in three deaths and 104 injuries, according to
the California Highway Patrol. Federally funded studies have
concluded that spills, drips, splashes and leaks from in-car meals
are responsible for more distraction-related accidents nationwide
than cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   In short, that greasy French fry could be a killer even before it
reaches your arteries.</TE>
<TE>   The fast-food industry has not overtly encouraged driving with
your mouth full, but it has responded to America's predilection for
eating in the car with pita pockets, burrito wraps, flat-bread tacos
and other foods that a motorist can grip in one hand while merging
into speeding freeway traffic with the other.</TE>
<TE>   One fast-food outlet even offers pancakes on a stick. A popular
chicken joint serves its chicken nuggets in a container that fits
conveniently into a cup holder. The bowl-shaped lid can be used to
hold the dipping sauce. And a taco chain now grates its cheese extra
thick to keep it from slipping off even during the most hazardous
traffic conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "Portability is the key thing," said Harry Balzer, vice president
of the NPD Group, a national marketing firm that tracks eating
trends. "Everything tied to the car is becoming more important."</TE>
<TE>   For good reason. More than half of the money that rolls into the
$129-billion fast-food industry comes from hungry motorists at the
drive-through windows.</TE>
<TE>   Other outlets are trying to cash in on this market. Starbucks now
has drive-through windows at 200 of its 5,600 coffee outlets
nationwide. Drive-through windows are being tested in Texas by
7-Eleven Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The automobile industry has also recognized the growing
eat-in-the-car trend by designing new models with extra large cup
holders, fold-out trays and stain-resistant upholstery.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is doing bigger and better cup holders," said Art
Garner, a spokesman for American Honda. He noted that Honda's new
sport utility vehicle, the Pilot, features a fold-out armrest for
rear-seat passengers that is big enough to accommodate a takeout
meal. The armrest includes small cubbyholes, just the right size for
condiment containers.</TE>
<TE>   In some of its new SUVs, General Motors offers an electric cup
holder that can keep a beverage hot or cold. The device plugs into
the cigarette lighter.</TE>
<TE>   Chevrolet recently introduced the new Bel Air convertible with
seat-back fold-out trays that resemble the pop-out trays on
airliners.</TE>
<TE>   But the fast-food and automobile industries also recognize that
eating on the road can be dangerous and can leave companies
vulnerable to food-accident lawsuits. Remember the 81-year-old woman
who sued McDonald's after being scalded by hot coffee that she
spilled while sitting in her car? For such reasons, the car companies
and fast-food purveyors rarely promote products as being convenient
for eating on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't encourage eating while driving," said a Burger King
spokeswoman, Kim Miller. But she noted that most of the chain's food
can be consumed with one hand, including the French toast stick.</TE>
<TE>   And some fast-food outlets send a not-so-subtle message that the
portability of their products is suited for meals on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Church's Chicken sells chicken strips in a round container that
fits into most cup holders.</TE>
<TE>   The top flips open to hold the dipping sauce. The carton carries
these instructions: "Place box in cup holder, find favorite radio
station. Enjoy."</TE>
<TE>   Eating behind the wheel has become so widespread that Hagerty
Classic Insurance, a classic-car insurer in Michigan, released a list
of the "Ten Most Dangerous Foods to Eat While Driving."</TE>
<TE>   The list was dominated by juicy, sticky foods such as chocolate,
jelly-filled doughnuts, barbecued meat and chili.</TE>
<TE>   The insurer gave the title of most hazardous driving food to
coffee, saying the beverage is usually served at a temperature that,
if spilled, can seriously distract a driver.</TE>
<TE>   The company's study also concluded that most food-related
accidents happen in the morning, when motorists are on their way to
work and most concerned about keeping their clothes free of stains.</TE>
<TE>   The study also found that the odds of having a food-related
accident can double if the vehicle has a manual transmission, since
eating, shifting and steering all at once require extra dexterity.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the dangers, some motorists in Southern California--home
of the worst traffic in the nation--claim to have developed a finely
honed technique for safely maneuvering through traffic while chowing
down.</TE>
<TE>   "I drive with my knees while I eat," Katherine Sheridan, a horse
trainer from Los Angeles, said as she prepared to drive away from a
Hollywood Jack in the Box with a bag of fries and a soda.</TE>
<TE>   Sheridan said she is so skilled at eating behind the wheel that
she rarely worries about the convenience or mess of the food she
orders.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Dennyson, who works in the entertainment industry in
Hollywood, also considers herself a pro at dashboard dining. But she
tries to stay away from food that requires two hands, utensils or a
lot of napkins.</TE>
<TE>   "I get burritos a lot," she said as she waited at the Jack in the
Box drive-through window. "I try not to get salads."</TE>
<TE>   How often does she eat in the car?</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather not say. I'm not proud of it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But there are those motorists, such as Ari Aquino of Los Angeles,
who refuse to eat in the car.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to go to work with food stains all over your clothes,"
he said as he idled in the Jack in the Box drive-through lane,
waiting to grab some lunch to eat at the office. "Besides, it's
dangerous to eat in the car, isn't it?"</TE>

<TE>   Don't Eat These and Drive</TE>
<TE>   The top 10 most dangerous foods to eat while driving:</TE>
<TE>   1. Coffee (It is a popular in-car beverage that is served piping
hot and can leave unsightly stains.)</TE>
<TE>   2. Hot soup (It is also served hot and is difficult to eat while
driving.)</TE>
<TE>   3. Tacos (They tend to fall apart with each bite, sending the
contents all over the car.)</TE>
<TE>   4. Chili (Chili-covered foods can drip and spill with the
slightest bump in the road.)</TE>
<TE>   5. Hamburgers (Special sauces and greasy meat juices can turn a $5
meal into a $500 auto repair bill.)</TE>
<TE>   6. Barbecued foods (Some finger-licking good foods are best eaten
over a sink.)</TE>
<TE>   7. Fried chicken (Drivers often try to clean their grease-covered
hands immediately.)</TE>
<TE>   8. Jelly and cream-filled doughnuts (Oozing jelly seems
magnetically drawn to a driver's lap.)</TE>
<TE>   9. Soft drinks (Another popular driving drink that can spill at
the slightest miscue.)</TE>
<TE>   10. Chocolate (Sticky and messy, it prompts drivers to try to
clean up immediately.)</TE>

<LD>Chatsworth development--In some editions July 29, a story in the
California section on opposition to the Deerlake Ranch development in
Chatsworth omitted comments from Hans Giraud, a consultant to the
developer. Giraud said that the developer's figures on how much
traffic the project would cause had been vetted by the Los Angeles
Department of Transportation, Caltrans and the Los Angeles County
Department of Public Works. He added that "we've met every legal and
technical criterion put before us."</LD>

<HD>HBO to Produce New Programs for ABC</HD>
<DH>Television: Partnership represents a dramatic shift from
Disney's in-house strategy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co.'s struggling ABC TV network announced Monday that
cable giant HBO would develop new shows for ABC over the next two
years.</LD>
<LD>   ABC will finance shows created by HBO Independent Productions and
will have the first chance to air any of the programs. If the network
takes a pass on a show, HBO can shop it to competing networks. ABC
will not get the rights to any of HBO's original hit series, however,
such as "The Sopranos" and "Sex and the City." HBO is a unit of media
rival AOL Time Warner Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The ABC-Home Box Office partnership represents a dramatic shift in
Disney's strategy. In recent years, ABC has depended almost entirely
on its in-house studio, Touchstone Television, to churn out the bulk
of the network's prime-time lineup.</LD>
<TE>   But ABC saw its prime-time ratings plummet 20% last year to third
place overall.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, six out of seven new shows on ABC will be Touchstone
productions.</TE>
<TE>   "ABC became too inbred, and they had to go outside" of the Disney
studio, said Jon Mandel, co-chief executive of Mediacom Inc., which
helps companies buy TV advertising. "HBO has quite a good reputation,
so [the agreement] makes sense."</TE>
<TE>   ABC executives concede they need a better mix of programming.</TE>
<TE>   "It's virtually impossible for one studio to program one whole
network," said Lloyd Braun, chairman of ABC Entertainment Television
Group. "We don't want to limit ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Although HBO produces a limited number of original shows, it led
all networks this year in Emmy nominations with its drama "Six Feet
Under."</TE>
<TE>   ABC is not expecting Sopranos-style shows; instead it hopes the
deal will generate one or two programs, such as CBS' hit comedy
"Everybody Loves Raymond," which is co-produced by HBO.</TE>
<TE>   "There might be a show, on first blush that looks like an HBO
show, but on a second glance could be right for us," Braun said. "The
lines are getting more and more blurred on what's right for cable and
what's right for broadcast television. And HBO has shown that they
can do both."</TE>
<TE>   Braun said the earliest that an HBO-produced show will appear on
ABC will be fall 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said ABC's challenge to rebuild the network has actually
turned into a positive in attracting suppliers such as HBO.</TE>
<TE>   "Studios believe that there's opportunities here," Braun said.
"There's room on our schedule."</TE>
<TE>   He said that ABC will make deals for shows with other independent
production companies such as Carsey-Werner-Mandabach ("That '70s
Show").</TE>
<TE>   Braun said the deal will be good for ABC because HBO has
established relationships with marquee talent--producers, writers and
actors.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to put HBO programming on ABC," said Russell
Schwartz, executive vice president for HBO Independent Productions.
"This is not about us just taking stuff that doesn't work on HBO and
sticking it on ABC. This is about developing programs for ABC."</TE>
<TE>   He added that his three-person team isn't planning to churn out a
bunch of shows. "We've never been about producing a schedule of 12
shows. We build them one at a time," Schwartz said.</TE>
<TE>   The ABC deal marks a renewed emphasis on broadcast TV for HBO
Independent Productions, which currently only has "Raymond" on the
air. A decade ago, the HBO unit was busy making shows such as
"Martin" for Fox Broadcasting Co. and "Roc." But by the mid-to-late
1990s, the studio had been priced out of a market that awarded
multimillion-dollar development deals to second- and third-tier
writers.</TE>
<TE>   But the economics of television have shifted. Studios and networks
phased out many of those big development deals, and they are showing
more willingness to make deals with suppliers who are outside the
company.</TE>
<TE>   ABC has been the most reliant on in-house product of the major
broadcast networks, said David W. Miller, a media analyst in Los
Angeles with the investment banking firm Sanders Morris Harris.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at Fox, CBS or NBC, there's a little more balance in
shows that were developed in-house and those developed by outside
suppliers," Miller said. "Disney's strategy has been to produce its
own shows and own all of the economics of the shows. That's great if
all of the shows are hits, but sometimes you want to hedge your
bets."</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal, ABC will pay HBO an undisclosed amount for a
development fund for new programs. In addition, HBO could request
joint ownership in a project, but ABC executives could veto that
request. ABC and HBO executives met for the first time to discuss the
partnership on July 15.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened very quickly," Schwartz said. "This seemed like a
good fit, it seemed natural and right for us to work with ABC."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>O'Neill Voices Support for IMF Talks on Brazil</HD>
<DH>S. America: Treasury secretary makes remarks while
visiting nation hit by political, economic uncertainty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAO PAULO, Brazil</DL>
<LD>U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, whose comments on Brazil's
economic woes roiled Latin American markets last week, on Monday
backed talks for an aid package to rescue Latin America's largest
economy.</LD>
<LD>   For several weeks now, Brazil's economy and the left's political
fortunes have been roller coasters traveling in opposite directions.
When the left's poll numbers go up, key financial indicators take a
beating. And when the left's poll numbers go down, the markets try to
stage a recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Brazil is the latest victim of a fiscal malaise that already has
given Argentina the dubious honor of being the largest country to
default on its debt. Along with Uruguay, which Sunday received an
emergency $1.5-billion transfusion, the countries are suffering from
low productivity, failing currencies, high unemployment, decreasing
trade and beleaguered governments.</LD>
<TE>   Amid those difficulties, O'Neill met with outgoing President
Fernando H. Cardoso and said he was very supportive of the
discussions between Brazil and the International Monetary Fund.
Brazil, which has a net public debt load of some $250 billion, is
seeking about $10 billion to help stabilize its falling currency.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the IMF has said they feel very good about their
progress in the talks, and I think things are going forward," said
O'Neill, who will meet with business leaders today.</TE>
<TE>   Before his trip, O'Neill had suggested that aid and loan
guarantees would end up in the pockets of Latin American leaders. He
later recanted, but that didn't stop protesters who burned the U.S.
flag Monday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Special Problem</TE>
<TE>   Because of its size, Brazil is a special problem. The crisis here
is being driven by the political fallout from this fall's elections,
in which the left is expected to do well.</TE>
<TE>   New polls show the ruling-party candidate, Jose Serra, in third
place far behind two candidates who propose a sharp break with
Cardoso's pro-business policies. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the
leftist Workers' Party and Ciro Gomes of the center-left Popular
Socialist Party appear to be headed to a presidential runoff in
October.</TE>
<TE>   Both have said Brazil should rethink its relationship to the U.S.
and the international economy. And both have promised to focus
special attention on the 1.8 million workers who are unemployed in
Sao Paulo, South America's largest city.</TE>
<TE>   But just the idea of a Lula or Gomes presidency terrifies the
other Brazil, the executives who run the sputtering dynamo that is
the Brazilian economy. From the high-rises of Sao Paulo's financial
center, those same business leaders look out to the industrial
suburbs that are a leftist stronghold and see a dangerous force
gathering like storm clouds in the nation's business climate.</TE>
<TE>   "The Brazilian economy is very vulnerable to fear of risk because
so much of our economy is tied to exports and the world economy,"
said Antonio Machado, an analyst with Opportunity, an investment
firm.</TE>
<TE>   A poll released Monday showed Lula leading with 35%, Gomes second
with 26% and Serra at third with 13%. Each poll that shows Lula
leading helps send Brazil's "country risk" factor soaring; the figure
is a measure of the riskiness of investing in Brazil. And with
Serra's numbers reaching new lows, so has the value of the Brazilian
currency, the real. On Monday, the real closed at 3.17 to the dollar,
having lost 20% of its value since June.</TE>
<TE>   Lula and his coterie of advisors have suggested that the market
shifts are part of a government-backed effort to sabotage his
campaign. They also argue that the man who 22 years ago helped found
the Workers' Party, known by its Portuguese initials, PT, is today a
social reformer with good business sense who has mellowed as he has
grown older.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems absurd to me that ... people are trying to sell this
kind of economic terrorism, on the basis of what some polls say,"
Lula said recently. "We want to offer to the foreign investor
something more serious than what they have seen up to now."</TE>
<TE>   No longer does Lula speak of nationalizing key industries or
reneging on Brazil's foreign debt. No longer do his speeches draw
heavily on fiery rhetoric of class struggle. Instead, he tosses
around phrases such as "economic growth" and "lower interest rates,"
saying Brazil should aspire to return to the boom years of the 1960s
and '70s.</TE>
<TE>   "Lula has matured," said Andre Singer, a Sao Paulo journalist and
Lula's spokesman. "As you get older, you are more capable of
understanding the reality of a society and governing."</TE>
<TE>   Gomes, on the other hand, seems to have grown more feisty with
age. This campaign season, the 44-year-old former finance minister
and provincial governor has railed against what he calls Brazil's
"oligarchy." He has called for a dramatic increase in the minimum
wage and has said he might oppose further agreements with the
International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were to agree to an [IMF] accord, I'd be going against the
immense desire for change that I see in this country," Gomes said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The same polls that put Lula ahead in the Oct. 6 vote show most
Brazilians increasingly frustrated with spiraling rates of crime and
unemployment, and disgusted with rampant government corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "People want a change," said David Fleischer, a professor at the
University of Brasilia and director of Brazil Focus, a political
newsletter. "They see Lula and the PT as a viable alternative."</TE>
<TE>   In a country where electioneering is increasingly a media-driven
activity, Serra suffers from an image problem, his dour looks and
surly demeanor turning off many voters.</TE>
<TE>   Lula, meanwhile, has gotten a make-over, straightening his teeth
and often wearing suits and ties to campaign events instead of his
trademark T-shirts and baseball caps.</TE>
<TE>   Serra has been hurt, too, by the tinge of scandal surrounding the
government of Cardoso, who has served two terms and cannot run for
reelection because of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Justice Minister Miguel Reale resigned after Cardoso
declined to launch a federal investigation into allegations that
organized crime has infiltrated the government of Espirito Santo
state, just north of Rio de Janeiro. "Cardoso may have boosted Lula
into the presidency with what he did in Espirito Santo," Fleischer
said.</TE>
<TE>   For all his difficulties, Serra retains rock-solid support in at
least one important constituency: the financial markets.</TE>
<TE>   He has pledged to keep in place the current government's economic
recipe of fiscal austerity, budgetary surpluses and low rates of
inflation.</TE>
<TE>   "Serra is someone the markets are comfortable with," Machado said.
"He represents continuity."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Business Concerns</TE>
<TE>   Business leaders are worried that the mellower Lula of the
campaign would be unable to resist the demands of his radical
supporters if he becomes president.</TE>
<TE>   To address such concerns, the PT took its most dramatic step of
the campaign in February. Lula announced that a conservative
businessman, Jose Alencar of the Liberal Party, would be his running
mate.</TE>
<TE>   Months later, when Alencar was confirmed as the PT's vice
presidential candidate at a party congress, several militants
responded with boos.</TE>
<TE>   "Lula is the best candidate to build a more just Brazil where the
working class has employment and dignified salaries, education and
food to eat," said Joao Felicio, president of the CUT, a labor
federation of more than 3,000 unions. "I believe in Lula's life
story, and I certainly don't trust Jose Serra and this current
economic model."</TE>
<TE>   The PT's antidote for Brazil's woes follows orthodox liberal
thinking: Put more money in the hands of Brazil's working
people--through anti-poverty programs, subsidies that lower food
prices and the like--and that will in turn stimulate economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   Like Lula, Gomes has chosen a candidate with conservative
credentials as a running mate. But Gomes is viewed even more
skeptically by many in Brazil's financial community, who see him as
unpredictable and a loose cannon.</TE>
<TE>   "Bankers are unanimously very worried by Ciro," an executive at
one of Brazil's banking associations told the Dow Jones news service
recently.</TE>

<LD>LodgeNet Entertainment Corp., the largest provider of pay television

<LD>   The companies formed InnMedia in October 2000 to offer movies on

<LD>New-home prices surged to record levels in each of Southern
California's six counties as builders struggled to keep up with
potential buyers, according to a quarterly report by the Meyers
Group.</LD>
<LD>   In Orange County, the most expensive market in the region, median
prices in the April-through-June period topped $500,000 for the first
time. That represented a 14% increase from a year earlier, the Meyers
Group said.</LD>
<LD>   Prices in San Diego County ran up more than 25% during the period
to $407,787. They jumped 20% in Los Angeles County to $359,900, grew
10% in Riverside County to $253,200, and gained 19% in San Bernardino
County to $239,990.</LD>
<TE>   "We've been riding very high levels of consumer confidence, and
we're just about out of inventory everywhere," said Michelle Wolkoys,
an analyst at the Irvine real estate research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Unsold units across the region were hovering at about a one-month
supply, the group found.</TE>

<HD>Asian Firms Back as Global Bidder</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Hutchison and STT are offering a lot less than
their original deal. Company delays decision to Thursday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Asian companies that withdrew an early offer to buy Global
Crossing Ltd. after creditors deemed it inadequate are now the top
contender to buy the assets of the telecommunications company--and
for a lot less than the $750 million in cash initially offered.</LD>
<LD>   Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. in Hong Kong and Singapore Technologies
Telemedia are offering only a small amount of cash and more than 21%
of the stock to creditors, who are owed $12.4 billion in the nation's
fifth-largest Chapter 11 case, sources familiar with the bidding
process said.</LD>
<LD>   Caught in the industry's downward spiral, Global Crossing
creditors and executives are finding that the longer they have
delayed making a deal, the lower the bids get. On Monday, the company
for the fifth time delayed a decision, from today to Thursday
morning. A court hearing on the bid was delayed from Wednesday to
Thursday afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   A flagging industry, in even worse shape after the bankruptcy
filing last month of giant WorldCom Inc., has put too many assets on
the market. Troubled firms, originally hurt by too much capacity and
too little demand, now are faced with selling their portions of that
glut at fire-sale prices.</TE>
<TE>   "They probably could get $1 billion if they just liquidated their
assets, and that might be the best deal they get," one source said.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing listed assets of $22.4 billion when it filed for
protection from creditors Jan. 28.</TE>
<TE>   It also filed for bankruptcy protection with a joint
Hutchison-SingTel offer to buy 79% of the firm by giving creditors
$300 million of the cash plus $800 million in notes and 21% of the
stock. They would have put the remaining $450 million into Global.
Creditors later said the offer was too low, and the companies
withdrew it.</TE>
<TE>   "They should have done the deal then. It would have made Hutch and
STT look very stupid," another source said. "But now they just look
very stupid themselves and make the two [companies] look good."</TE>
<TE>   Spokeswomen for the two Asian companies would not discuss the
status of talks for Global Crossing. "We have not made a decision on
the investment yet," SingTel's Melinda Tan said. Hutchison's Laura
Cheung said her company is keeping its options open but has not
submitted a formal bid.</TE>
<TE>   A Global Crossing spokeswoman would not comment.</TE>

<HD>Corporate Insiders Send Bullish Signs</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Despite the stock market downturn, corporate insiders are buying more
shares in their companies and selling fewer, signaling that they
think stocks could be hitting bottom, analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, companies are stepping up announcements of stock
buybacks, in which they purchase their own shares using corporate
funds. Buybacks can be a sign these companies think their stocks are
a bargain, and are seen by some analysts as another bullish signal.</LD>
<LD>   In the case of insider transactions, the ratio of overall insider
stock sales to purchases has fallen sharply in the last six weeks,
said Vickers Weekly Insider, a newsletter published by Argus Research
Co. in New York. In the week ended Friday, buys outnumbered sells for
the first time this year.</LD>
<TE>   "We've seen a dramatic change in a short period," David Coleman,
editor of Vickers, said Monday. "The insiders are extremely bullish.
They feel their stock is undervalued, and their message is, 'Buy.' "</TE>
<TE>   Newsletters such as Vickers track open-market stock purchases and
sales by company executives and directors, who are required to report
such transactions to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
purchase data exclude the exercise of stock options.</TE>
<TE>   Investment strategists who watch these transactions use the
collective wisdom of insiders as a market barometer. When insiders as
a group are eager to buy at open-market prices and reluctant to sell,
it often marks at least a near-term bottom in the stock market, these
analysts say. Conversely, when selling spikes, it may signal a market
top as executives take their profits in what they may think are
over-priced stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman said his benchmark ratio, which compares sales with
purchases over the trailing eight weeks among companies listed on the
New York and American stock exchanges, fell to 3 to 1 as of Friday
(or three sales for every purchase). The eight-week ratio hit a
recent peak of 4.1 to 1 in mid-June.</TE>
<TE>   The more volatile one-week ratio fell to 0.7 to 1 last week from
1.2 to 1 a week earlier, Coleman said.</TE>
<TE>   These ratios compare the number of sales with purchase
transactions, rather than overall share volume or dollar volume.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, insiders usually are selling more than they're
buying, because of the inclusion in sales data of stock bought via
options. Stock sales have outnumbered buys by an average of about 2
to 1 to 2.5 to 1, so ratios within that range are considered neutral.</TE>
<TE>   Though Coleman said he normally would wait for his benchmark ratio
to fall below 2 to 1 before turning bullish, the "rapid and
substantial about-face" by executives warrants an early call, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks he recently has added to his recommended portfolio include
Nortel Networks Corp., down 87% year-to-date as the wireless sector
has continued its free fall, and Maytag Corp., down one-third from
its 52-week peak in mid-April. At Nortel, insiders have reported
buying 1.8 million shares in the last three months while selling
100,000; Maytag's chief executive recently doubled his holdings in
company stock, buying 18,335 shares in the $31 range, Coleman said.</TE>
<TE>   Maytag closed at $30.89, down 11 cents, on Monday, while Nortel
closed at 95 cents a share, up 2 cents. Both trade on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, corporations have stepped up their share-buyback
programs, giving another boost to the argument that the stock market
is bottoming.</TE>
<TE>   In July, companies vowed to buy back $44-billion worth of stock,
second only to last September's record total of $53.6 billion, when a
wave of buyback announcements followed the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, said TrimTabs.com Investment Research.</TE>
<TE>   Buybacks are seen as positive because they can increase earnings
per share by reducing the number of shares outstanding, and because
they may signal that companies think their stock is a bargain.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to the stock market, the companies are the house,"
said David Fried, editor of Buybackletter.com in Pacific Palisades,
using a Las Vegas analogy. "They are absolutely the best judges of
their valuation."</TE>
<TE>   Stocks that Fried said he likes based on recent buybacks or
buyback announcements include check printer Deluxe Corp., aerospace
giant Boeing Co., and cigarette maker Philip Morris Cos.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, if you take these two things together [insider buying
and share buybacks], it's economics 101: Anything that reduces supply
is a good thing," said Mark Hulbert, whose Hulbert Financial Digest
tracks investment newsletters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts urge caution in interpreting the various data.</TE>
<TE>   "At these share prices you would expect to see more buying" by
insiders, said Lon Gerber, who tracks insider activity for Thomson
First Call. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index of blue-chip stocks is
down 27.3% year-to-date.</TE>
<TE>   Gerber called recent purchases by executives at J.P. Morgan Chase
&amp; Co. and Sun Microsystems Inc. "encouraging," but said overall
dollar volume of insider buying has remained flat.</TE>
<TE>   Gerber, whose most recent totals are for June, said insiders
bought $1.1-billion worth of stock in the first half of 2002--the
same as a year ago. On a positive note, he said, sales fell to $15
billion from $22 billion in the first half of 2001 and $34 billion in
the first half of 2000, when more gains were being realized because
of the higher stock market.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, companies do not always live up to their buyback
announcements, analysts say. Sometimes they are simply making a
public relations move aimed at calling attention to their stock.</TE>
<TE>   It's also an open question whether investors, disillusioned by a
wave of corporate scandals, will place as much credibility in the
transactions of corporate insiders as they have in the past.</TE>

<HD>Nasdaq Sinks to 5-Year Low; Dow Drops 269</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Fearful investors flee to Treasury securities
as another economic report suggests that the recovery may be running
out of steam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new wave of selling drove the Nasdaq composite index to a fresh
five-year low Monday and battered stocks across the board amid
growing worries about the economy.</LD>
<LD>   Investors' hunger for a "safe haven" continued to benefit the
Treasury bond market, where yields on some securities fell to their
lowest levels in at least a generation.</LD>
<LD>   On Wall Street, a weaker-than-expected report on July activity in
the service sector of the economy fanned fears that the U.S. could
tip back into recession and sent the Dow Jones industrial average to
its third consecutive triple-digit loss.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow tumbled 269.50 points, or 3.2%, to 8,043.63. After
rebounding 1,034 points from July 24 through Wednesday, the blue-chip
index has surrendered 693 points in the last three sessions.</TE>
<TE>   The technology-dominated Nasdaq index on Monday gave up the last
of its gains from the late-July rally, falling 41.91 points, or 3.4%,
to 1,206.01, its lowest close since April 1997. The previous Nasdaq
closing low was 1,229.05 on July 23.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks slumped Friday after the Labor Department said the economy
created a net 6,000 jobs in July, about one-tenth the total analysts
had expected.</TE>
<TE>   Other data last week also suggested that the pace of the economic
recovery has slowed.</TE>
<TE>   That has undermined perhaps the most important remaining pillar of
support for stocks, analysts warned.</TE>
<TE>   In June and for much of July, the market's dive was blamed on the
financial scandals that have soiled corporate America's image with
investors. As stocks slid, many Wall Street pros contended that the
economic fundamentals remained solid and that share prices soon would
revive based on those fundamentals.</TE>
<TE>   Now, "The economy has replaced confidence [in corporate America]
as the No. 1 fear," said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at brokerage
Jefferies &amp; Co. in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of
activity in the non-manufacturing segment of the economy fell to 53.1
in July from 57.2 in June. The new reading indicated that the service
sector still is expanding, but at a slowing rate.</TE>
<TE>   If the economic recovery is running out of steam, the recent
turnaround in corporate earnings could be threatened, Hogan and
others noted. That could deepen concerns about stocks' valuations
relative to underlying earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Trading volume Monday was well below recent record highs, so the
sell-off had no great urgency, analysts said. Still, losers swamped
winners by 12 to 5 on Nasdaq and by 3 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called VIX index, which gauges investors' fear levels by
measuring activity input and call options on a blue-chip stock index,
closed at 49.31 on Monday, just below the peak of 50.48 reached on
July 23--the day before shares resurged.</TE>
<TE>   For many investors in the market in recent days, "the dominant
mood has been, 'Get me out at any price,' " said Al Goldman, analyst
at brokerage A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the biggest stocks on the NYSE fell by 5% or more on
Monday. They included Citigroup, which slid $2.23, or 7.2%, to
$28.65, and Walt Disney, which fell $1.04, or 6.8%, to $14.27.</TE>
<TE>   In the technology sector, Intel slid 81 cents to $15.88, Cisco
Systems lost 53 cents to $11.36 and IBM dropped $1.89 to $65.99.</TE>
<TE>   European stock markets also were sharply lower Monday. The German
market stumbled 5.7%, the French market fell 4% and the Dutch market
lost 3.9%.</TE>
<TE>   As investors dumped stocks, some funneled the proceeds into
government securities, driving yields on some Treasury issues to
their lowest levels in at least 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the 2-year T-note ended at 1.89%, down from 2% on
Friday and 2.42% a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the 10-year T-note, a benchmark for mortgage rates,
ended at 4.21%, down from 4.29% Friday and the lowest since November.</TE>
<TE>   Many market pros say the rush into Treasury securities could
backfire on buyers, if the economic data in the next few weeks
suggest that recession worries are overblown. That could cause yields
to whiplash.</TE>
<TE>   "Treasuries are so dangerous at these levels," Goldman said.</TE>
<TE>   But the main catalyst for the rally in Treasuries is that "people
are very afraid," said Matthew Tucker, fixed-income portfolio manager
at Barclays Global Investors in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he said, many investors now are betting that the Federal
Reserve will help the economy by launching another round of cuts in
short-term interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   Lower short-term rates could make yields on longer-term Treasury
securities relatively attractive, even at current levels.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed's key rate, now 1.75%, already is at a 40-year low. But
analysts at brokerage Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. told clients last week
that the Fed could cut the rate to 1% by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   "More people are coming over to that camp," Tucker said.</TE>
<TE>   Fed policymakers will meet next Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Some Wall Street pros have doubted that the Fed would cut rates
further, because such a move could frighten investors if they
believed the central bank was entering panic mode over the economy.</TE>
<TE>   But as stocks continue to fall, Fed inaction could become the
greater risk, Goldman said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a Fed cut would be a positive thing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for frightening investors, Hogan said: "How much more can we
scare them," given the losses most portfolios have suffered this
year.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq index's decline Monday left it 76.1% below its record
high reached in March 2000.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft to Release Code for Windows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN and JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. will begin giving independent software writers a vast
trove of information today about how the Windows operating system
interacts with other computers and with smaller Microsoft programs,
fulfilling key parts of its proposed antitrust settlement with the
Justice Department.</LD>
<LD>   The release of the technical information is designed to allow
programmers to make alternative Web browsers, media players and other
features work as well with Windows as do Microsoft's own products.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft critics said that until the paperwork is released and
programmers try to make rival software work on Windows, it would be
impossible to evaluate how open the company is being.</LD>
<TE>   The software behemoth promised to make the disclosures last fall
when it settled with the Justice Department and nine states, which
had accused it of unfairly using its monopoly in personal computer
operating systems to promote Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser,
Media Player and other programs.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge is considering whether to approve the settlement
and whether to impose additional sanctions on Microsoft, as
California, Iowa and seven other states are requesting.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith and other executives said the
company would immediately offer licenses for 113 communication
protocols, the procedures by which Windows interacts with larger
server computers. That should let computer makers incorporate better
non-Microsoft systems for sharing files, printing and other
functions.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 28, the company will disclose 272 internal interfaces,
which cover how Windows works with other Microsoft programs for
e-mail, Web browsing and the like.</TE>
<TE>   As permitted under the proposed settlement, one server protocol
and one internal interface will be withheld for security reasons, and
one interface will be withheld to help protect content under a
digital rights management system.</TE>
<TE>   Those sound like minor exceptions rather than the truck-sized
loopholes some had feared. But because Microsoft decided what was an
interface at all, and what was part of the core code that didn't have
to be released, "it could be meaningless," said Donald Falk, an
attorney for a software industry group that has filed court papers on
the government's side.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department said it had not finished studying the draft
licensing terms and the disclosures to see if they are sufficient
under the settlement. "Without more details about what these guys are
doing, it's a tough call to say 'this is good' or 'this is bad,' "
said one software executive whose products compete with Microsoft's
and who asked that his company not be named. "What are the licensing
terms?"</TE>
<TE>   Foes of the federal settlement had complained that it required
disclosure of internal interfaces only just before Microsoft releases
a new operating system or a major update. So though Microsoft is
going to show the internal tricks in Windows XP and its coming
update, the company's programmers have had a long head start in
designing features that take advantage of those tricks.</TE>
<TE>   "A better remedy would put Microsoft in the position of having to
adopt industry standard open [interfaces]," said Vice President John
Perr of Ximian Inc., which is shepherding open-source versions of
programs designed to run on Microsoft's Internet-based ".Net"
architecture. "I would characterize this as 'Windows dressing.' "</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft also touted the Windows XP upgrade, which adheres to
another part of the settlement by allowing users to block access to
Internet Explorer and other features known as middleware.</TE>
<TE>   But the update contains "several examples where if you unclick a
choice indicating you don't want to use Microsoft middleware, it
shows up anyway," said Mike Pettit, executive director of ProComp, a
trade group backed by Microsoft rivals including AOL Time Warner Inc.
and Sun Microsystems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Pettit said that in a prerelease version of the update, Windows XP
invokes Microsoft's Internet Explorer for certain Web browsing, such
as utilizing a Windows program called "Shopping for Music," even if a
user has installed a rival product such as AOL's Netscape Web
browser. And he said Windows XP will use Microsoft's own Media Player
to play certain music files even though a user has installed a rival
media player from RealNetworks Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "I find astonishing at this stage of the game that these kinds of
things would happen," Pettit said. "Either the Justice Department
didn't do a very good job of protecting consumers or Microsoft has
not done a very good job of compliance."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said it was up to AOL and
RealNetworks to make sure their tools are used by default in every
instance. Desler said the XP update "enables third-party vendors to
have the opportunity to be the defaults. They're going to have to do
the work."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for states pressing for greater and speedier
technical disclosures and a more stripped-down version of Windows
said they will study how thorough Microsoft's new steps are. But they
said no matter how good the compliance is, it won't fix the
weaknesses in the federal settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a settlement agreement that appears weak, it's
implementation would still be weak," said Tam Ormiston, deputy
attorney general in Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares slipped 42 cents to $43.99 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>America Online Expected to Name USAI Executive as CEO</HD>
<DH>Media: Jon Miller has experience in both the entertainment
and Internet sectors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc. is expected to name a new head of its struggling
America Online division as early as today, turning to an outsider to
stabilize and reinvigorate its most troubled unit, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Jon Miller, formerly president of the information and services
group of USA Interactive Inc., will be appointed chairman and chief
executive of the division, which has been without a leader since the
abrupt resignation last month of Robert W. Pittman amid a plummeting
stock price.</LD>
<LD>   America Online's credibility battle on Wall Street and within the
AOL Time Warner family means Miller will be stepping into one of the
most challenging and high-profile jobs in media. But people who know
the 45-year-old executive say his understated, collaborative style
and experience across both the entertainment and Internet sectors
will reshape the insular AOL.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts also pointed out that Miller's style will mesh well with
the parent company's new management team, drawn entirely from Time
Warner ranks.Chief Executive Richard D. Parsons is known for a
soothing, low-key style, a stark contrast to AOL's brash,
take-no-prisoners approach. That attitude, symbolized by Pittman,
alienated many old-line Time Warner executives who were relieved last
month when he stepped down as chief operating officer of the company
and president of the Internet division.</TE>
<TE>   The two top lieutenants Parsons appointed last month--former HBO
Chief Executive Jeffrey Bewkes and former Time Inc. Chairman Don
Logan--also are described as under-the-radar executives who duck the
limelight.</TE>
<TE>   Miller also is coolheaded.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a yeller, screamer, jumper or thrower," said Bill Simon,
managing director of the global media and entertainment practice of
headhunter Korn Ferry International, who recruited talent for Miller
when he was at USA Interactive. "The experience at USAI is a
tremendous springboard for him to go to AOL," Simon said. "He'll be
outstanding, sensitive to the cultural issues within AOL Time Warner
and in using AOL's customer base to benefit other Time Warner brands.
It's a lot of heavy lifting, but he's good at building teams around
him."</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, America Online is the worst-performing division
within AOL Time Warner. A steep decline in its advertising revenue
and customer base since its 2001 merger with Time Warner has pushed
shares of the world's largest media enterprise to record lows.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of driving 20% annual growth of the new company, as
promised in the merger, the division, with its eroding economics, has
created a credibility gap internally and on Wall Street. In addition,
a federal probe of AOL Time Warner's accounting practices is expected
to zero in on the Internet division.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner stock closed at $9.95 on Monday on the New York
Stock Exchange, down from $74 just months after the merger was
announced.</TE>
<TE>   Executives who know Miller say he will do some housecleaning at
AOL, bringing in his own top team and driving out a culture focused
increasingly on advertising revenue and bottom-line performance
rather than the customer. They say he also will concentrate on new
services to keep customers from leaving.</TE>
<TE>   Miller is one of the few Internet success stories, having helped
media mogul Barry Diller build USA Interactive, through several
acquisitions, into one of the biggest revenue generators left
standing after the dot-com meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   USA Interactive, which sells concert and airline tickets and hotel
reservations online, will have an estimated $700 million in operating
cash flow this year from $4.8 billion in revenue, according to Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co. Those sales represent about 9% of all online consumer
transactions, putting USA Interactive just behind EBay.</TE>
<TE>   "They've come a long way since 1997," when Miller joined the
company, said Victor Miller (no relation), an analyst at Bear Stearns
who closely followed Jon Miller at USA Interactive.</TE>
<TE>   Yet USA Interactive is just a fraction of the size of America
Online, which has about $1.7 billion in cash flow.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors say the job may be a giant step for Miller but
acknowledge that there is a limited pool of successful Internet
executives to draw upon.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to restoring confidence on Wall Street and retooling
AOL's economic model, Miller faces a cultural divide within AOL Time
Warner.</TE>
<TE>   Many Time Warner executives blame the division and its management
for wiping out their nest eggs and stock options as shares declined.</TE>
<TE>   Executives who know Miller say he will help bridge the divide.</TE>
<TE>   Before joining Diller in 1997, Miller was managing director of
Viacom Inc.'s Nickelodeon International and chief programming
executive for the National Basketball Assn. Diller hired him to head
his company's broadcast group, a two-bit station operation bought for
$250 million and sold a couple years later to Univision for more than
$1 billion. Diller then put Miller in charge of the interactive
group.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, the headhunter, said Miller's stint under Diller--one of
the toughest bosses in media--would be useful at AOL. "He doesn't
allow the noise around him become a distraction," Simon said.</TE>

<HD>AOL Shares Fall as New Accounting Questions Surface</HD>
<DH>Media: Stock price returns to single digits with news of
allegations in a California lawsuit against Homestore.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of AOL Time Warner Inc. slipped into single digits again
Monday as a California lawsuit alleged that the media giant
participated in an accounting sham with troubled real estate Web site
Homestore Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The suit comes as New York-based AOL Time Warner faces an
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and a related
criminal probe by the Justice Department into reports that the
company used aggressive accounting practices to inflate revenue and
mask financial problems.</LD>
<LD>   In a revised class-action lawsuit filed July 31 in U.S. District
Court in Los Angeles, the California State Teachers' Retirement
System alleges that AOL and Homestore engaged in bogus advertising
transactions that appear to have been designed to help Homestore pad
its revenue.</LD>
<TE>   The suit, first reported Monday in the Wall Street Journal, is the
consolidation of several shareholder lawsuits that have been filed
against Homestore, which admitted this year to improperly using
barter deals to boost ad revenue. The Westlake Village-based company
restated its revenue for 2000 and 2001, spurring an SEC
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner is not named in the lawsuit, but an attorney for
the teachers retirement system--which claims to have lost $9 million
from its Homestore shares--said AOL may be added to the suit if it is
determined that company officials knew how the transactions were
being used.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll continue to investigate the AOL link," said Bruce Simon of
Cotchett, Pitre, Simon &amp; McCarthy, lead counsel in the shareholder
lawsuit. "What we are hearing about the [federal] investigation of
AOL for its own accounting issues feels an awful lot like the
Homestore transaction."</TE>
<TE>   The suit seeks as much as $2 billion in lost equity for Homestore
investors, he said.</TE>
<TE>   An AOL Time Warner spokesman defended the company's practices and
stressed that it has not been named in the suit.</TE>
<TE>   "AOL's accounting for all transactions with Homestore.com were
appropriate and signed off on by our outside auditors, Ernst &amp;
Young," said AOL spokesman John Buckley.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Homestore did not return a phone call seeking
comment.</TE>
<TE>   SEC investigators interviewed AOL officials in the spring as part
of the probe into Homestore, but additional questions now are likely
to be raised in light of the lawsuit, according to a source familiar
with the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of both companies fell Monday. AOL Time Warner's stock lost
35 cents to close at $9.95 in New York Stock Exchange trading.
Homestore fell 4 cents to close at 75 cents in Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, Homestore.com used third-party companies
such as SFX Technology and L90, now known as MaxWorldwide Inc., to
funnel money first to AOL and then back to Homestore, where it could
be counted as new revenue.</TE>
<TE>   In one transaction, the suit claims, Homestore.com paid about $2
million to SFX Technology for an asset that had no real value. SFX
kept about $30,000 for itself and used the rest to buy $2 million
worth of ads on AOL's House and Home Channel.</TE>
<TE>   Because AOL and Homestore had signed a revenue-sharing deal in May
2000 to jointly promote the feature, AOL gave about $1 million back
to Homestore, the suit alleges. AOL and Homestore announced an
exclusive advertising partnership, valuing the five-year deal at
about $200 million.</TE>
<TE>   Now that partnership is the subject of arbitration, with each side
accusing the other of failing to live up to the terms of the
agreement. Homestore has set aside a reserve of $90 million to cover
potential costs.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore remains the premier partner on AOL's real estate site.</TE>

<HD>Service Sector Continues to Grow but Pace Slows</HD>
<DH>Economy: July figures provide more evidence that the
recovery may be stumbling. Outlook remains cautious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. service sector grew for a sixth straight month in July, but
the pace of expansion slowed, a report said Monday, providing more
evidence that the U.S. economy's fragile recovery may be faltering.</LD>
<LD>   The Institute for Supply Management said its monthly
non-manufacturing index fell to 53.1 in July--the lowest level since
January--from 57.2 in June, marking the second straight month the
index has fallen. The figure was below analysts' forecasts for a dip
to 54.6.</LD>
<LD>   A number greater than 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which
makes up roughly 80% of the economy and includes such diverse fields
as legal help, retail and construction. Anything less than 50 signals
contraction.</LD>
<TE>   "It doesn't look like things are going to turn around in terms of
faster growth, significantly faster growth, until maybe close to the
end of the year," said Ralph Kauffman, director of the institute's
non-manufacturing survey committee.</TE>
<TE>   The drop in the service sector data came after the institute's
manufacturing index last week showed growth in that sector nearly
stalled in July, in part because factories grew more cautious as
major stock indexes plunged to five-year lows and consumer confidence
suffered.</TE>
<TE>   In one sign that service sector growth may slow further in coming
months, the new-orders index, a gauge of future demand, fell to 52.6
from 56.9 in June.</TE>
<TE>   Survey respondents said that although the economy continued to
improve, the outlook remained cautious through year-end.</TE>
<TE>   The report said the pace of layoffs slowed slightly as the
employment index rose to 45.8 in July from 44.3 in June, but it still
marked the 17th straight month of job losses.</TE>
<TE>   That followed the government's labor report Friday that showed the
economy added just 6,000 jobs in July, too few to bring down the
jobless rate from 5.9%.</TE>

<HD>Cablevision to End Rainbow Tracking Stock</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cablevision Systems Corp. said it would end the Rainbow Media Group
tracking stock after 16 months of trading, raising the possibility
that cable channels AMC, Bravo and Independent Film Channel would be
sold.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the move could be Cablevision's first step toward
putting the networks on the block to raise cash to meet its capital
spending needs next year. Analysts estimate the funding gap could be
$500 million to $1 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Cablevision is divided into two operating units. Cablevision NY
Group holds cable systems with nearly 3 million subscribers in the
New York area, the New York Knicks basketball team, the New York
Rangers hockey team and other assets; Rainbow Media holds AMC, Bravo,
IFC and Women's Entertainment.</LD>
<TE>   Cablevision NY will exchange about 1.19 shares of its stock for
each share of Rainbow stock.</TE>

<HD>Ad Giant Delays Results Report</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Interpublic Group says its audit panel needs more
time, raising investor concerns about accounting issues. Firm's
shares fall 24%</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Interpublic Group of Cos. shares tumbled 24% Monday after the world's
largest advertising firm delayed the release of its second-quarter
financial results, raising investor concern about accounting issues.</LD>
<LD>   The shares slid $4.69 to $14.99, a five-year low, on the New York
Stock Exchange. The company pushed back the report--originally due
out today--to Aug. 13, saying in a statement that its audit committee
needed to "complete its review prior to management certification of
its financial statements."</LD>
<LD>   "Anytime a company delays an earnings release at the last minute,
it raises concerns among investors," said David Doft, an analyst at
CIBC World Markets. "Either it's nothing or it's bad, and in this
market people sell."</LD>
<TE>   Under a new Securities and Exchange Commission rule, chief
executives and chief financial officers of the 947 largest publicly
traded U.S. companies must certify the accuracy of their financial
statements. For most firms the deadline for certification is Aug. 14.</TE>
<TE>   As of Friday, fewer than 40 companies had filed certification
statements, although more companies did so on Monday, including Los
Angeles-based Northrop Grumman Corp., Leggett &amp; Platt Inc., Tellabs
Inc., Allete Inc. and Rockwell Collins Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting at Interpublic rival Omnicom Group Inc., the
third-largest ad company, came under investor scrutiny in June when
the Wall Street Journal reported the company's merger accounting may
understate liabilities. Omnicom and Interpublic built up their
marketing services through dozens of acquisitions, leading to complex
accounting, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   As for Interpublic, "My intuition is that it's not a material
issue, but the market is spooked," said Ron Rimkus, a portfolio
manager at Mesirow Financial. He said his company hasn't been selling
the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Interpublic spokesman Philippe Krakowsky declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released late Monday, Omnicom said its CEO and CFO
"intend to sign and file, without qualification, the certifications
that the SEC is requiring."</TE>
<TE>   Omnicom in June said it gave the SEC information about its change
of auditors and the resignation of two board members this year. The

<HD>Medical Tenants Filling Space</HD>
<DH>Once reluctant to lease to doctors, some landlords find
that the health-care sector is a bright spot in a stagnating market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While most of Southern California's commercial real estate market
suffers from a painful slump, a few lucky landlords seemed to have
found a cure: the health-care business.</LD>
<LD>   The expansion of the medical industry--including the growth of
outpatient surgical centers--and relatively little new construction
have pushed the vacancy rate for medical office space across the
region to about 5%, roughly one-third of the rate for office space in
general, brokers and property owners say.</LD>
<LD>   Rents at medical office space are running at least 10% above
general leasing rates, and some traditional office owners who were
once reluctant to lease to doctors are welcoming medical tenants to
hard-to-fill space.</LD>
<TE>   In Beverly Hills, home to one of the nation's most prestigious
clusters of medical office buildings, medical office landlords are
getting some of the highest monthly office rents in Southern
California--nearly $4 a square foot. Doctors eager to be in the
neighborhood are being offered space in windowless basement storage
areas, and one building owner is cashing in on Rodeo Drive by
converting commercial offices into medical space along the famous
shopping strip.</TE>
<TE>   "Compared to commercial office real estate, medical office space
is much ... healthier," said medical building owner Robert Held.</TE>
<TE>   Brokers and property owners say demand has built steadily for the
last three years after the medical real estate market stagnated in
the wake of consolidations and cutbacks among medical groups in the
early and mid-1990s. In addition to expanding medical groups, a
significant portion of the need for medical space is being driven by
outpatient surgery centers, where patients can undergo relatively
minor surgical procedures once performed at hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "You are seeing those pop up all over Los Angeles and beyond,"
said real estate broker Marc Lebowitz of First Property in Beverly
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the growing demand, medical office space makes up a small
slice--perhaps 5%--of the overall office leasing market and is often
an overlooked specialty in real estate. Many cities impose limits on
where medical offices and facilities can be located, and the offices
themselves require more extensive plumbing and electrical systems
than generic office space as well as more parking--factors that
increase building costs and limit a landlord's flexibility. Many
office building owners are reluctant to rent to doctors and surgical
centers because they don't fit into the typical corporate image.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditional office users provide an awful lot of resistance to
any building that allows doctors," said broker Nick Christensen of CB
Richard Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   But as landlords struggle with a shortage of new tenants and
existing medical space grows hard to find, doctor offices and medical
facilities are opening in more traditional office buildings. In
Westwood Village, Innovative Healthcare Management recently leased
about 14,000 square feet of street level space for an outpatient
surgical center and offices in Westwood Center, a sleek office tower
owned by Arden Realty and populated with attorneys and other
professionals.</TE>
<TE>   "The major problem was that there was not enough medical space in
a medical building," said Bill Simon, president of Innovative
Healthcare Management.</TE>
<TE>   It took the owners of the Rodeo Collection, a small shopping and
office complex, only three weeks to lease about 30,000 square feet on
Rodeo Drive to plastic surgeons and other medical practitioners after
spending months looking for traditional office or retailer users,
said broker Bruce Kaufer of Grubb &amp; Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   "The medical demand is there, and we took advantage of that,"
Kaufer said.</TE>
<TE>   Falling vacancy rates and rising rents in medical office
properties have prompted some investors to start building medical
offices buildings at a time when other developers are scaling back or
postponing projects.</TE>
<TE>   Backers behind the $12-million Irvine Medical Plaza are confident
enough about future demand that they have purchased land and are
poised to start construction on the 43,000-square-foot building
without any signed leases, said broker John Wadsworth of Colliers
Seeley, who represents the property. That confidence stems in part
from the fact that the medical office vacancy rate in rapidly growing
South Orange County is only about 2.5%, while the market overall is
25% vacant.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Gottlieb, chief executive of Beverly Hills landlord G&amp;L
Realty, said that the firm's seven medical buildings--totaling about
235,0000 square feet--in the city are virtually fully leased and that
the firm started to convert storage areas into office space to
satisfy demand.</TE>
<TE>   Owners of the 7,800-square-foot Specialty Surgical Center on
Brighton Way bought a 50,000-square-foot Wilshire Boulevard office
building they plan to transform into a medical facility with seven
outpatient operating rooms. Orthopedic surgeon Andrew Brooks said the
facility would allow the group to increase the number of monthly
surgeries it performs from 700 to nearly 1,200.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked for about a year to find space on a large scale in
Beverly Hills, but that was impossible," Brooks said.</TE>

<HD>Restaurant Recalls Tainted Cheesecake</HD>
<DH>Food: A batch of baked goods is contaminated with the
listeria bacteria, Cheesecake Factory says. No illnesses reported.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cheesecake Factory Inc. said Monday it had recalled a batch of
cheesecakes contaminated with the potentially lethal listeria
bacteria.</LD>
<LD>   The Calabasas Hills restaurant operator also recalled all of its
baked goods made from July 18 to July 21 as a precautionary measure.</LD>
<LD>   The company said it believes none of the cakes were consumed.
There have been no reports of illness due to the contaminated cakes,
which were made at the company's Calabasas facility.</LD>
<TE>   A serious case of listeriosis takes one to six weeks to develop,
according to the Food and Drug Administration and other government
agencies. People most at risk of serious cases are the elderly,
children, pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems.</TE>
<TE>   Cheesecake Factory said it discovered the tainted cakes after
routine tests. It blamed the outbreak on human error.</TE>
<TE>   The company recalled a batch of white chocolate raspberry
cheesecakes that were sold to Olive Garden, the moderately priced
sit-down Italian chain owned by Orlando, Fla.-based Darden
Restaurants Inc.</TE>
<TE>   None of the contaminated cakes was sent to the Cheesecake Factory
or any other wholesale customer, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   It is unlikely any of the contaminated cakes were consumed because
of Olive Garden's own extensive quality assurance testing, according
to Cheesecake Factory's statement.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it has been working with the FDA and Olive Garden
since the problem was discovered.</TE>
<TE>   The recall could hurt Cheesecake Factory's business in the short
run because of consumer concerns, said Janet Lowder, president of
Restaurant Management Services, a consulting firm in Rancho Palos
Verdes. She predicts sales might drop by less than 5% in the next few
days.</TE>
<TE>   To contain the fallout, Cheesecake Factory probably will unleash a
PR offensive emphasizing that the chain discovered the problem itself
and quickly recalled the contaminated products, said Carlsbad
restaurant consultant Hal Sieling. Given the chain's popularity and
reputation for quality, Cheesecake Factory should emerge nearly
unscathed if nobody falls ill, he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, if somebody gets sick or dies, "things could get pretty
bad pretty quickly," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cheesecake Factory is in the midst of its biggest expansion ever,
with plans to open 11 namesake outlets and one of its upscale Grand
Lux restaurants by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, 180 diners fell sick and one died after contracting
salmonella, a food-borne illness caused by bacteria, at a Red Lobster
in Chattanooga, Tenn. Shares of Darden, Red Lobster's parent company,
fell by about 5% after the announcement of the death.</TE>
<TE>   Symptoms of listeriosis include fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting
and diarrhea. Serious infections can result in meningitis and even
death.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers with questions should call (888) 290-9437.</TE>
<TE>   Cheesecake Factory shares fell $2.81, or 9%, to $28.20 on Nasdaq,
before the news was announced.</TE>

<HD>Texas Sues Farmers Group</HD>
<DH>Insurance: The state accuses the firm of charging higher
premiums while reducing coverage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state of Texas filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit Monday against
Farmers Group of Insurance Cos., alleging the Los Angeles company
charged Texas policyholders higher premiums to pay for disasters in
other states, improperly used credit histories to set rates and
wrongly limited coverage for water damage.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed in state court in Austin, is part of a national
backlash against insurance industry efforts to raise premiums, limit
coverage and in some cases quit whole lines of business. Insurers say
these actions are a response to the double whammy of rising claims
and declining profits on investments. But a national coalition of
consumer groups recently accused the industry of using these factors
as an excuse for price gouging.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Atty. Gen. John
Cornyn said their accusations grew out of a continuing investigation
of property insurers in the state, which is a major battle zone for
lawsuits over mold-related illnesses--claims the industry portrays as
one of the chief threats to its financial health. Farmers, a unit of
Zurich Financial Services, writes about 20% of the homeowner policies
in Texas.</LD>
<TE>   Texas officials said their lawsuit asks that Farmers be fined
millions of dollars for alleged deceptive practices and that it be
forced to refund as much as $140 million to its Texas policyholders.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Farmers denied it has violated Texas laws, and its
Texas chief executive, John Hageman, accused Perry and Cornyn of
"political harassment." Perry is up for reelection on the Republican
ticket this year and Cornyn is the GOP nominee for U.S. Senate.
Zurich, which is based in Switzerland, didn't immediately reply to a
request for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Investment profits during the late 1990s allowed property insurers
to offset losses on operations and keep premiums low in a battle for
market share.</TE>
<TE>   But as investment markets were hammered last year, the U.S.
property-casualty industry recorded its first net loss after taxes, a
deficit of $7.9 billion, according to the Insurance Services Office,
an industry-funded data center.</TE>
<TE>   In California, insurers of homes and autos this year have filed
241 requests for rate increases with the Department of Insurance.
Similar actions across the nation caused Americans for Insurance
Reform, a New York-based coalition of consumer groups, to write July
30 to insurance commissioners in all 50 states calling for tougher
regulation of the companies.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas case "is part of the same insurance cycle we are seeing
here in California, in which insurance companies try to pass their
own investment losses on to consumers--either in higher rates or
reduced coverage," said Douglas Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer
and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. He said the industry's finances
are fundamentally healthy, and it "is trying to get consumers to
shoulder [its] losses in a bear market."</TE>
<TE>   Saying homeowner's insurance will be an emergency issue in the
next legislative session, Cornyn this year called for new laws giving
the state the ability to impose across-the-board rate freezes and to
restrict the use of credit scoring to set rates.</TE>

<HD>Moody's Cuts Ratings on Two PG&amp;E Units</HD>
<DH>Utilities: The move means the energy company must
renegotiate loans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL TAUB</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PG&amp;E Corp.'s power-generating and trading unit's credit ratings were
cut to "junk" Monday by Moody's Investors Service, forcing the
company to renegotiate $1 billion in loans obtained in June.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's downgrade of PG&amp;E National Energy Group to Ba2 follows a
downgrade by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., which cut the unit to below
investment grade last week. Banks require National Energy to have an
investment-quality rating from one or both companies.</LD>
<LD>   PG&amp;E, technically in default under its bank covenants, said it
obtained a waiver on the loans through Aug. 16. The owner of
California's top utility is in talks with lenders, including General
Electric Co.'s GE Capital and Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., to amend
the agreement, which runs through September 2006.</LD>
<TE>   "We are now working with these lenders to discuss long-term
modifications to this lending agreement, as our team has done
successfully in the past," PG&amp;E said.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's cut its rating on about $3.8 billion of debt three levels
from Baa2 because of weaker-than-expected cash flow and low wholesale
power prices. Additional cuts are possible, the credit-rating company
said.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's also lowered ratings for PG&amp;E Gas Transmission Northwest
and USGen New England, both PG&amp;E units.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of San Francisco-based PG&amp;E, which have lost more than half
their value this year, fell 51 cents, or 5.8%, to $8.30 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   National Energy's 10.38% coupon notes maturing in 2011 plunged 11
cents to 37 cents on the dollar, according to Trace, the bond
price-reporting service of the National Assn. of Securities Dealers.</TE>
<TE>   That lifted the yield on the debt to 32%, up from 26% before the
ratings cut.</TE>
<TE>   "The rating action reflects declining operating performance,"
Moody's said.</TE>
<TE>   Lenders have tightened credit for energy traders after the
collapse of Enron Corp. and federal probes of accounting and sham
transactions.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E's Pacific Gas &amp; Electric utility, under bankruptcy
protection, contributed 81% of earnings from operations in 2001.
National Energy added the rest.</TE>

<LD>Philips Electronics settled federal charges that it failed to pay
rebates on time to more than 50,000 customers.</LD>
<LD>   The buyers of Philips computer products waited as much as several
months beyond the promised eight-week rebate period, the Federal
Trade Commission said. Under the settlement, the company agreed to
pay eligible consumers within 10 days.</LD>
<LD>   The rebates, from $20 to $100, were for such products as CD drives
and monitors, the FTC said.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman said the delay occurred when Philips switched
companies that handle rebates in the middle of a promotion.</TE>

<HD>Ward Creditors' Suit Allowed to Proceed</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Montgomery Ward's unsecured creditors won a bankruptcy judge's
approval of a liquidation plan for the defunct retailer and the right
to sue its owner, GE Capital Corp., for at least $500 million.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Raymond Lyons approved the plan, which
hinges on fraud claims by creditors against General Electric Co.'s GE
Capital unit. Ward's suppliers say GE Capital duped them into
extending hundreds of millions of dollars in credit to the dying
retailer before its bankruptcy filing in December 2000.</LD>
<LD>   GE Capital failed to persuade 16,000 unsecured creditors to back a
rival plan to drop the suit and accept payment of at least 20% on
almost $400 million in claims. Under the plan Lyons adopted,
unsecured creditors would get at least 4% of claims, and perhaps as
much as 100%, if they win their suit.</LD>

<LD>The Treasury Department sold $16 billion in three-month bills at a
discount rate of 1.6%, down from 1.68% last week. An additional $16
billion was sold in six-month bills at 1.555%, down from 1.69%.</LD>
<LD>   The three-month rate was the lowest since Jan. 14, when the bills
sold for 1.53%. The six-month rate was the lowest since the
government began selling the bills in 1958.</LD>
<LD>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.627% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,959.60, and 1.589% for a six-month bill selling for $9,921.40.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, the Federal Reserve said the average yield for
one-year constant-maturity Treasury bills, the most popular index for
making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, dipped to 1.82% last
week from 1.88% the previous week.</TE>

<LD>AdvancePCS, which manages prescriptions for pharmacies, said it is
introducing a plan to encourage the use of low-cost generic drugs by
providing vouchers for new prescriptions and informing pharmacists
about the availability of generics.</LD>
<LD>   Insurance companies will pick up the tab to eliminate co-payments
for generic drugs under the voucher program, an AdvancePCS spokesman
said. The plan would benefit health insurers by helping to switch
patients to cheap copycats, which would cost insurers less in the
future.</LD>
<LD>   AdvancePCS' program, called AdvanceGenerics, will offer vouchers
that enable patients to obtain their first fill of a generic drug at
a pharmacy at no cost. Vouchers will be distributed directly to
patients by AdvancePCS, through their health plans or from their
doctors.</LD>

<HD>SEC Is Looking Into Mirant Accounting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mirant Corp. said that the Securities and Exchange Commission has
started looking into its accounting and energy trading after the
company disclosed last week that it may have misreported $253 million
in assets and liabilities.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC asked for details on transactions with other companies, as
well as shareholder lawsuits and energy sales in the West during
California's power shortage, Mirant said.</LD>
<LD>   Mirant, a power producer and North America's biggest natural-gas
trader, last week said it mistakenly claimed ownership of $85 million
in gas inventory and overstated $100 million in payables it owed. It
also may have booked $68 million in accounts receivable in the wrong
period.</LD>
<TE>   Mirant expects to report more on its accounting after a review,
general counsel Doug Miller said. Chief Executive Marce Fuller said
last week the errors were honest mistakes and not intended to deceive
investors.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Mirant, based in Atlanta, fell 56 cents, or 16%, to
$2.93 on the NYSE. They have plunged 91% in the last year.</TE>

<LD>Plunging sales of Wyeth female hormone replacement drugs Prempro and
Premarin appear to be stabilizing, with the medicines holding up
better than expected in the wake of a landmark study citing Prempro's
health risks, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Leerink Swann &amp; Co. analyst Mario Corso said the total combined
number of U.S. prescriptions for Prempro and Premarin in the week
ending July 26 were 21% lower than the weeks immediately before the
study came out, as some patients abandoned the therapies because of
health concerns.</LD>
<LD>   Based on current sales trends, Corso predicted combined sales of
Prempro and Premarin will dip 10% this year to $1.9 billion before
dropping to $1.4 billion in 2003 and $1.3 billion in 2004.</LD>

<LD>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. posted a quarterly profit topping analysts'

But some investors were expecting stronger revenue growth and the
stock fell.</LD>
<LD>   The maker of Tide laundry detergent also reached management's
long-term annual growth target a year ahead of schedule.</LD>
<LD>   Those targets of 4% to 6% sales growth and double-digit earnings
growth were hit despite a sluggish economy and a consumer products
sector that has seen more promotion and price cutting.</LD>
<TE>   The company posted net income of $910 million, or 64 cents a
share, contrasted with a loss of $320 million, or 23 cents a share,
in the year-earlier period, a loss that included a $1.16-billion
restructuring charge. Sales rose 6% to $10.17 billion.</TE>
<TE>   P&amp;G said that earnings before restructuring items were $1.09
billion, or 77 cents a share, compared with a profit of $891 million,

earnings of 75 cents.</TE>

<DL>TAIPEI, Taiwan</DL>
<LD>Taiwan's stock market and currency tumbled Monday on fears that
President Chen Shui-bian's call for a vote on independence would
prompt China to revert to its 1990s strategy of military
intimidation.</LD>
<LD>   Chen's remarks were made Saturday to pro-independence activists of
his party. He said the island nation and mainland China were "one
country on each side," and backed a referendum on formal
independence.</LD>
<LD>   Chen's government downplayed the importance of his comments. But
investors fled Taiwanese shares Monday, driving the main stock index
down 284.22 points, or 5.8%, to 4,636.67, its biggest one-day
percentage decline in 21 months.</LD>
<TE>   The Taiwan market had been one of the world's best performers in
the first four months of this year. But at Monday's close the main
index was at its lowest level since Nov. 30 and is down 16.5%
year-to-date. That's still a better performance than the U.S.
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, which is down 27.3% this year.</TE>
<TE>   China, in its first official response, said Chen will "bring
catastrophe" to Taiwan. "We warn the ... Taiwan forces to back off
from the precipice," Li Weiyi, a spokesman for a Cabinet-level China
agency responsible for Taiwan relations, told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing has said many times in the past that it would retake
Taiwan by force if the island declares independence.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not expecting a war, but the market fall is going to reflect
the increased anxiety of people," said James Chen, a money manager at
Fu Hwa Investment Trust Co.</TE>
<TE>   Worsening ties between Taiwan and China worry investors because
Taiwan has become economically dependent on the mainland. Taiwan
companies have more than $20 billion invested in mainland factories,
and China this year overtook the U.S. as the biggest market for the
island's exports.</TE>
<TE>   "Why say it?" Formosa Plastics Corp. Chairman Wang Yung-ching said
of Chen's remarks. "This is unexpected and unnecessary. Restoration
of direct links with China are now hopeless."</TE>
<TE>   The Taiwan dollar fell as much as 0.7% on Monday, ending at 33.95
per U.S. dollar. It has weakened from 32.8 per dollar July 18.</TE>
<TE>   Chen ended 50 years of Nationalist Party rule with his upset
victory in the 2000 presidential election. Although his Democratic
Progressive Party advocates independence for the island, Chen has
downplayed the sensitive issue in repeated appeals for talks with
China's leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Taiwan's policy toward China "hasn't changed," said Tsai Ing-wen,
chairwoman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council. "Taiwan has been
seeking stable cross-strait relations and will continue to try to
restore dialogue with China."</TE>
<TE>   The Taiwan market's dive Monday reverberated in other Asian
markets. Hong Kong's main share index fell 1.3%, the South Korea
composite index slumped 3.6% and the Singapore Straits Times index
fell 1.8%.</TE>
<TE>   But in Japan the Nikkei-225 index was off just fractionally to
9,704.93.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Second-quarter worldwide shipments of hand-held computers fell 3.5%
from a year ag, to 2.71 million units, as a lack of new models from
market leaders Palm Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. hampered sales,
market research firm Gartner Dataquest said. Total sales rose 1.5% to
$901.6 million.</LD>
<LD>   Hewlett-Packard, which acquired Compaq Computer Corp. this year
and sells more expensive models, overtook Palm as the market leader
in sales of personal digital assistants, or PDAs.</LD>
<LD>   Palm retained the lead in units shipped, with a 30% share,
followed by Hewlett-Packard with 16% and Sony with 10%.</LD>
<TE>   In sales, Hewlett-Packard edged Palm 24.4% to 24.1%. Sony had a
9.7% share, Toshiba 4.9% and Handspring Inc. 4.5%.</TE>

<LD>Infonet Services Corp. lost $36 million and posted 14% lower sales
for the fiscal first quarter, as the El Segundo network services firm
got hit with write-offs related to the shutdown of KPNQwest and the
bankruptcy of WorldCom Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The company's loss was equal to 8 cents a share for its first
quarter, ended June 30, compared with net income of $2.5 million, or
1 cent a share, for the same quarter last year. Sales totaled $147
million, down from $172 million a year earlier. During the quarter,
Infonet wrote off $41 million in network capacity purchased from
KPNQwest, a data carrier shut down in July, and put $5 million in
reserve to cover anticipated losses related to WorldCom's bankruptcy
filing.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Infonet fell 3 cents to $2.39 on the NYSE.</LD>

<HD>Uruguay Calm as Banks Reopen</HD>
<DH>Economy: Anxious depositors line up by the hundreds.
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill tours the troubled region today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay</DL>
<LD>The promise of $1.5 billion in U.S. aid to help underpin Uruguay's
ailing banking system calmed public jitters Monday, with the streets
largely quiet as banks reopened after a run had forced their closure.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday's announcement that the United States would front aid until
Uruguay reached a deal with the International Monetary Fund was a
welcome tonic ahead of today's stopover by Treasury Secretary Paul H.
O'Neill as he tours the troubled region.</LD>
<LD>   Dragged down after neighboring Argentina's economic meltdown and
buffeted by fears that giant neighbor Brazil could default on its
$250-billion public debt, Uruguay's economy has been ravaged by a
savings exodus and a dive in consumer spending.</LD>
<TE>   To help avoid another panic run on banks by depositors--and a
repeat of a looting spree amid Uruguay's worst violence in a
decade--legislators on Sunday approved a freeze on some deposits for
as long as three years.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, several hundred Uruguayans waited outside banks to
access their savings in this Ohio-size nation that is home to 3.4
million people. Police numbers were boosted in some parts of the
capital to protect depositors carrying large amounts of cash.</TE>
<TE>   "I have come to empty my account and do what everyone else is
doing--stash the money under my mattress, because you can't have
confidence [in the banking system] anymore," an elderly woman said as
she waited patiently in line outside a bank in Montevideo.</TE>
<TE>   Uruguay was one of just a few Latin American nations that enjoyed
investment-grade status until earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   But a three-year recession has plunged one in four citizens below
the poverty line and left 15.6% of the work force out of a job--a
30-year high.</TE>
<TE>   The government temporarily closed all banks for most of last week
to halt a run that has seen about half of deposits withdrawn this
year, as many depositors had feared just the kind of deposit freeze
that was implemented Sunday. Foreign reserves have plunged 80% in
recent months.</TE>

<HD>Wells to Move Its Retail Headquarters to L.A.</HD>
<DH>Banking: The shift is a sign to local businesses of how
much the region matters, an analyst says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying Southern California remains a key area for growth, Wells Fargo
&amp; Co. said Monday it would move the headquarters for its California
retail branch system to Los Angeles from San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Laura Schulte, currently Wells Fargo's retail head for Nevada and
Utah, was named to run the 900-branch California operation, which
includes $63 billion in loans to individuals and small businesses and
14,000 employees.</LD>
<LD>   Schulte, who will move to Los Angeles from Las Vegas, also will
have responsibility for 50 branches along the Mexican border from San
Diego to Brownsville, Texas, reflecting Wells' concerted effort to
win business from the nation's growing Latino population.</LD>
<TE>   Wells, based in San Francisco, said recently that Leslie S.
Biller, its L.A.-based chief operating officer, would leave the
banking company in October to pursue his goal of becoming a chief
executive.</TE>
<TE>   The move of retail operations to Los Angeles will help signal to
Southern California's small businesses how much the region matters to
Wells, said banking analyst Joseph K. Morford of RBC Capital Markets.</TE>
<TE>   "Since there are no large banks based in L.A. any more, this is
kind of making a statement," Morford said.</TE>
<TE>   Wells runs neck-and-neck in California with Washington Mutual Inc.
in the booming mortgage origination business and is No. 1 in home
equity loans throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   But it is second to Bank of America Corp. in deposits in
California and third in some areas, such as the Los Angeles-Orange
County region.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County absolutely is still a growth market for us," said
Kim Young, who was named Wells' regional president for Orange
County--the first time the bank will have an executive for the
county.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley Freeman, an executive with a background in private banking
and online services, will become regional president for Los Angeles,
Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   Getting banking customers to use Wells' brokerage and portfolio
management services is a top priority, Freeman said.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California executives will report to Carrie Tolstedt,
who ran the California retail operations from San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Tolstedt, promoted to executive vice president for regional
banking, will have overall responsibility for branch operations in 23
states.</TE>

<HD>Venture Capitalists Refund $2.7 Billion</HD>
<DH>Investments: Firms give back more than they raise as
industry grows wary of making new funding commitments to young
companies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. venture capital firms released investors from $2.7 billion of
commitments in the second quarter, exceeding the amount raised in new
commitments by other funds, as the industry copes with its worst
slump ever, a new survey said.</LD>
<LD>   Seven big venture funds said they effectively returned $2.7
billion to their limited partners in the quarter rather than invest
the money, according to a survey by the National Venture Capital
Assn. and Thomson Venture Economics.</LD>
<LD>   In the same period, other venture firms gathered $1.8 billion of
investor commitments for 30 new funds, but that was down 84% from
$11.2 billion in commitments a year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   When the canceled commitments are subtracted from the fund-raising
total, committed capital last quarter showed a net decline of $887
million, NVCA said.</TE>
<TE>   The crash of the technology sector and the dive in stock prices in
general have left many venture capital investors wary of making new
funding commitments to young companies.</TE>
<TE>   With the market for new stock offerings a shadow of what it was in
the boom years of the late 1990s, and with the corporate appetite for
mergers and acquisitions deeply depressed, some venture capitalists
fear there may be no route for them to cash out of their investments
in private companies.</TE>
<TE>   The seven funds that canceled some of the capital pledged to them
in 2000 and 2001 were Accel Partners, Atlas Ventures, Austin
Ventures, Charles River Ventures, Meritech Capital Partners, Walden
International and Worldview Technology Partners.</TE>

<HD>Moody's May Cut Disney's Credit Rating</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moody's Investors Service said Monday that it may cut Walt Disney
Co.'s long-term credit ratings because theme park attendance is
falling and fewer people are watching or buying advertising on the
ABC television network.</LD>
<LD>   The news helped drive Disney's shares to a new eight-year low.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's rating review followed a similar downgrade warning Friday
from Standard &amp; Poor's.</LD>
<TE>   Moody's expressed worry over Disney's theme park operations. It
also said it has ongoing concerns about the company's $15-billion
debt load and viewership and advertising levels at ABC's networks.</TE>
<TE>   "Moody's remains concerned that given ABC's lagging audience share
it may experience greater negative volatility should a 'double-dip'
advertising recession take hold," the firm said.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's said it may cut Disney's long-term debt rating, now A3.
That is Moody's fourth-lowest investment grade rating. The firm also
said it may cut the A2 ratings of Disney Enterprises and ABC.</TE>
<TE>   Lower debt ratings would raise Disney's cost of borrowing new
money or of refinancing existing debt.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Burbank-based Disney said fiscal third-quarter net
profit fell by nearly one-third from a year ago to $364 million, or
18 cents a share. The company also warned that fourth-quarter profit
may drop because of weak tourism.</TE>
<TE>   Disney shares, which plunged $1.52 on Friday in the wake of the
profit report, slid $1.04 to $14.27 on the New York Stock Exchange on
Monday.</TE>

<HD>SEC Chairman Freed From Recusal Pledge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt's one-year
pledge to sit out votes on cases involving former clients has
expired, leaving him free to act on all issues before the agency.</LD>
<LD>   The former securities lawyer, who was sworn in as SEC chairman a
year ago last Saturday, said he will decide whether to participate in
agency actions case by case. Those judgments may include whether to
vote on possible civil charges against bankrupt energy trader Enron
Corp. and its auditor Arthur Andersen, a past Pitt client.</LD>
<LD>   The decision means Pitt will be free to pass judgment on some of
the nation's biggest financial companies. His list of 112 former
clients, as a lawyer in private practice, included Andersen and the
other four biggest accounting firms; Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the largest
brokerage; the New York Stock Exchange; and the Securities Industry
Assn., the trade group for brokerages.</LD>
<TE>   SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan said Pitt will rely on his own
judgment and SEC ethics rules that bar commissioners from taking
actions that would benefit them financially. She said Pitt won't make
public any additional guidelines for his decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "That's pretty much it," Harlan said. "He'll handle it on a
case-by-case basis."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) has urged Pitt to extend his
recusal agreement, a position shared by some experts in the field of
government ethics.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been a sensible move on Pitt's part to have
extended the recusal agreement," said Stuart C. Gilman, a former
official at the U.S. Office of Government Ethics who is now president
of the Ethics Resource Center, a nonprofit group that advises
businesses. "He should insulate himself from any perception of a
conflict of interest. Sometimes that insensitivity is what gets
people into a lot of trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Pitt has said he will not return to private law practice when he
leaves the SEC, closing off a possible ethics concern about whether
his actions might be influenced by a desire to please future clients
or prospective employers.</TE>

<HD>Colombians Battle More Than a Protracted Guerrilla War</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRIDA GHITIS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Colombia's new president takes office Wednesday, an American
surveillance plane will circle overhead, patrolling the skies. On the
ground, among the international dignitaries attending the
inauguration ceremonies will be Robert Zoellick, the U.S. trade
representative. Both are symbolic of the key role the U.S. will play
in this new and dangerous chapter of the country's troubled history.</LD>
<LD>   There is little doubt that Colombia's 38-year-old guerrilla war is
about to get worse. Colombians knew that when they elected the
hard-line, Harvard-educated Alvaro Uribe in a landslide.</LD>
<LD>   It is also a virtual certainty that U.S. involvement will grow now
that many of the warring factions have received the "terrorist" stamp
from the U.S. State Department. The question remains: What will the
new era bring, beyond more bloodshed and heartache?</LD>
<TE>   Colombia's leftist guerrillas and its vigilante paramilitary
armies long ago qualified for the terrorist label. But the nation's
problems extend far beyond the very serious crisis brought on by its
devastating, surreal war. (It was reported that in July, all the
villagers of Puerto Alvira were kidnapped by guerrillas in one more
plot worthy of a Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel.)</TE>
<TE>   Depending on one's perspective, the most immediate problem may be
drug trafficking, grinding poverty, human rights abuses, terrorist
attacks, kidnappings for financial gain, a stratospheric murder rate
or a war that refuses to end. Ignoring any of these problems while
focusing solely on the war would be a serious mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe has a mandate to end the war, and he has a kindred spirit in
the White House ready to bankroll his guerrilla-hunting forays. The
two presidents, in Bogota and in Washington, risk worsening the
plight of Colombians and discrediting their efforts if they forget
their ultimate purpose: The war must end to make people's lives
better.</TE>
<TE>   The enormous danger faced by those fighting terror is the
temptation to counterattack with such power that they too inflict
terror on innocent civilians. The Colombian government and its U.S.
backers must undertake parallel campaigns to ease the plight of
Colombians. While fighting a war whose ultimate goal must be a return
to the peace table, a similarly vigorous effort to stimulate the
country's economy and address its social ills must begin. This will
ensure that Colombia's government is fighting on behalf of the
people, and that the U.S. is not simply standing on the side of war.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. pumped billions into Colombia's failed anti-narcotics
crusade and, in effect, into its unsuccessful war effort. Money and
talent must also be channeled into bringing prosperity to the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the war does little to help the economy, and ending the
fighting would improve living standards. But there is no need to wait
for this endless war to conclude before focusing on terrible social
and economic problems that make the narcotics business more enticing,
while giving rhetorical ammunition to leftist guerrillas who say they
fight for social justice.</TE>
<TE>   And it would be absurd to wait for the war to end before focusing
on the value of human life. Human rights abuses have become endemic
in the country. The worst violators are paramilitary groups. They
share the government's hatred of the guerrillas, which often leads
the army to turn a blind eye to their atrocities.</TE>
<TE>   The incoming president, whose father was murdered by leftist
guerrillas, is believed by many to have links to paramilitaries. He
denies that, but his supporters must keep a close eye on his conduct
of the war, the behavior of his army and the actions of the
battalions of civilians he plans to enlist as "the eyes and ears" of
the military.</TE>
<TE>   The planned presence of the top U.S. trade official at Uribe's
inauguration is a positive sign. Washington would do well to
strengthen its trade ties with Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   Under the surveillance of the U.S. plane, Colombia's landscape
presents new possibilities and enormous danger.</TE>

<HD>Light at the Tunnel's End? No, Not Yet</HD>
<DH>Energy crisis is far from over. And politics don't help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY W. HULETT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's energy crisis is far from over. If there had been any
doubt, the heat wave in July erased it, as electricity demand soared,
energy prices spiked and the system stumbled.</LD>
<LD>   California suffers from serious shortages of electricity
transmission capacity, and it desperately needs new power plants.
Dealing with these issues requires tough public policy action, not
more empty rhetoric.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. General Accounting Office recently warned that California
is dangerously lagging in getting new power plants positioned,
permitted and built. Rep. Doug Ose (R-Sacramento), chairman of the
House Government Reform Subcommittee on Energy Policy, cautioned:
"Certain politicians in California have tried to convince the public
that there is no real shortage of supply. The GAO report conclusively
dispels that notion."</LD>
<TE>   Since the beginning of California's energy crisis in 2000, state
officials have flailed about for someone to blame. They have sought
to deflect responsibility onto everyone else. They have failed to
take serious remedial action to restore a workable system. They have
made and then sought to break contracts that would guarantee future
power supplies. And they hope the public won't be able to figure out
whose fault it is when the system breaks down again, as it almost
inevitably will.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, there's plenty of blame to go around: the legislators who
crafted California's flawed deregulation law; regulators who
implemented it in a way that virtually guaranteed the worst possible
results; energy companies that allegedly abused and manipulated the
system; environmentalists who blocked the construction of needed
power plants; and politicians more interested in dodging
accountability than in making tough decisions.</TE>
<TE>   An analysis by Severin Borenstein, the highly regarded director of
the University of California Energy Institute, and others showed that
nonutility energy providers could reap huge profits under some
circumstances without breaking the law. It's also quite possible that
some energy providers--most notably the now-bankrupt Enron
Corp.--weren't satisfied with the huge profits available to honest
players, and either stretched or broke the rules.</TE>
<TE>   Where do the state's three privately owned electric utilities
stand in all this? The utilities have been victims of this crisis,
along with the ratepaying and taxpaying public.</TE>
<TE>   The summer of 2000 was the worst. In an effort to keep the lights
on, utilities bought power at stratospheric prices, confident they
would be allowed to recover those costs in full through deferred rate
adjustments. But they weren't. It was a classic case of being forced
to buy high and sell low--a recipe for economic disaster.</TE>
<TE>   The results were predictable. California's largest utility,
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, was pushed into bankruptcy and Southern
California Edison narrowly escaped the same fate. Those two
utilities, as well as San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, were forced to rely
on the state to buy power for them.</TE>
<TE>   California politicians now are seeking to strong-arm power
generators to renegotiate even modestly priced power-supply
contracts. Several energy companies have agreed to new terms,
although for reasons not immediately apparent.</TE>
<TE>   The state is involved in a very public face-off with San
Diego-based power generator Sempra Energy Resources, which is
building new power plants and has agreed to supply a large amount of
electricity to California over the next decade. The state has
threatened to void that contract.</TE>
<TE>   Was Sempra's contract too rich? It doesn't seem so. (I say this as
an outside observer with no connection to the company.) Its prices
are lower than those in the renegotiated Calpine contract that the
state ballyhooed as a wonderful deal for customers. Furthermore,
Sempra's average prices are about 20% lower than the average of all
power-supply contracts in the state's portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   So why the brouhaha? Don't think of this as a rational public
policy debate. Think of it as an election year ploy. If there's an
opportunity for politicians and regulators to gain a few popularity
points by engaging in name-calling, why not do it?</TE>
<TE>   State officials would be well advised to remember Abe Lincoln's
famous observation that you can't fool all the people all of the
time.</TE>

<HD>As Bubbles Pop, the Splatter May Hit Your Home</HD>
<DH>Equity could plunge if the overall economy drops again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You agree that your house is worth too much, don't you? In the last
week, the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times used the word
"bubble" in headlines concerning housing prices. Real estate prices
have bubbled so much in recent years that these two business-minded
newspapers, rarely accused of sensationalism, now find the term
routine.</LD>
<LD>   But what about ordinary Americans, 68% of whom own their own
homes, and for most of whom their house is their biggest asset? In
the last few years, the value of folks' stock portfolios has bubbled
up and then popped. So should people be listening for a similar giant
popping sound in regard to home values? If top financial players--who
usually get out of the market first, taking the most out with
them--are a guide, then maybe it's time to give the ominous data a
hearing.</LD>
<LD>   To be sure, the early warning signs of bubblefication are uneven.
Home prices continue to rise nationally, up 7.4% in June 2002 from
June 2001, according to the National Assn. of Realtors; yet this
year, sales of existing homes dropped 11.7% from May to June, and
June's sales activity was 4.3% below the sales rate of a year before.
In Los Angeles, sales dipped because fewer homes were on the market.
But elsewhere, prices rose even as demand fell. Illogical? Sure it
is, and illogic is one of the warning signs of a bubble.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, the housing market is a lot less liquid than stocks.
One can't log on to E-Trade, buy or sell a house at the click of a
mouse and then be in or out the next minute. But even so, housing has
displayed a champagne-like fizz lately, at a time when other
investments have fallen flat. Residential housing prices surged over
the last five years from a median price of $121,800 in 1997 to
$163,500 in June 2002. That's an upside of 34%--not bad if you can
keep it.</TE>
<TE>   And that's the question: At a time when other values are down, can
home prices stay up? After all, during those same five years the
stock market has given back all its bubble-icious gains, and then
some. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, for example, closed at 834
Monday, well below where it was five years ago today, when it closed
at 952.</TE>
<TE>   The housing industry dismisses talk of a bubble. Interest rates
are down, they say. Yes, the current national average mortgage rate
is about 6.65%, the lowest in at least three decades. But how low can
it go? And how long can it stay down? That's mostly a matter for
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan to determine.</TE>
<TE>   He will probably cut rates in the near term--further puffing up
prices and also second mortgages, as recession-battered Americans
pull out cash to meet expenses--but eventually what comes down must
go up.</TE>
<TE>   Higher rates might be the right policy for the country over the
next few years, but try explaining that to an over-leveraged,
sell-crazed homeowner. So expect a major political fight over home
equity preservation.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, data points--the bubble-pricking kind--keep spiking.
Ian Morris, an economist at HSBC Securities, argued earlier this year
that the ratio of personal income--about $7.4 trillion--to the total
value of individually owned residential real estate--about $12
trillion--was becoming unsustainable. That ratio, 1 to 1.6, is about
25% higher than the historical average, he observed, leaving real
estate nowhere to go but down. The last time the ratio reached so
high was in 1989, just before the price pop of the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In April, a Goldman Sachs research report analyzed the residential
construction industry, from home builders to home suppliers. "The
two-year streak of outperformance could be coming to an end," it
concluded. Indeed, in the four months since, prices for the industry
group are down. Of course, the overall market also is down.</TE>
<TE>   But that's the bottom line: Housing runs on its own cycle, but it
can't be disconnected from the larger economy. If the economy
double-dips into another recession, homeowners too will take a bath.
And the remains of the bubble will not keep them afloat.</TE>

<HD>Weighing a Just War, or Settling an Old Score?</HD>
<DH>Bush's case against Iraq is weak. An attack would be
wagging the dog.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What the heck, let's bomb Baghdad. Sure, it's one of the more
historically important cities in the world, and many of its more than
3 million inhabitants will probably end up as "collateral damage,"
but if George the Younger is determined to avenge his father and keep
his standings in the polls, that's the price to be paid.</LD>
<LD>   George the Elder, it will be recalled, was a bit squeamish about
leveling Iraq's capital, but his son, who has emerged as a big
believer in "regime change," will stop at nothing in his drive to win
foreign victories that distract from his startling domestic failures.
If nothing else, a nightly CNN fireworks display will take our minds
off pervasive corporate corruption and the Incredible Shrinking Stock
Market.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately for those determined to wage war in Iraq, there is
no logical connection between Saddam Hussein and the big political
problems facing George W. domestically. In a very real way, Bush's
key corporate contributors, beginning with Enron's likable "Kenny
Boy" Lay, have savaged the U.S. economy--and even Teflon politicians
pay during recessions.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the so-called war on terror, which boosted the
president's poll numbers astronomically, is falling into a dismal
bureaucratic morass, and this week's Time magazine carries an
exhaustive report reminding us that indifference to the Al Qaeda
threat by the Bush administration before 9/11 is another scandal
waiting to explode.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's claims in the first days after the Sept. 11 tragedy that
Iraq was complicit in the disaster have never been backed up by any
real evidence. The existence of an alleged, unrecorded encounter
between one of the 9/11 terrorists and an Iraqi official in Prague
has been debunked, reaffirmed, debunked again and on and on. Yet,
while there is no credible connection with Hussein, there is ample
evidence that the biggest funders and most enthusiastic cheerleaders
of the 9/11 terrorists came from the very Persian Gulf states that
were saved by the first Bush war against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   So, back to the old gambit that Iraq poses a threat of unleashing
weapons of mass destruction. Our allies aren't buying it, and even
Scott Ritter, the ex-Marine who conducted on-site U.N. inspections in
Iraq, has testified before NATO that the current alarm is politically
motivated and not supported by facts on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Among the skeptics is Richard G. Lugar, the ranking Republican on
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who questioned the lack of
evidence supporting the war push after last week's Senate hearings:
"We're all saying today that we haven't found the evidence, but
somebody has to ask, 'Why not?' "</TE>
<TE>   The consensus of experts expressed last week before the Senate is
that there is no hard evidence that Iraq has a nuclear weapon and
that its biological and chemical arsenal, almost totally destroyed
during eight years of inspections, would be of only local military
application. No serious observer suggests Iraq has the ability to
spread infectious "weaponized" diseases like smallpox to the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein is clearly a brutal bully, savage in the repression of his
own people, but he does not conform to the madman caricature of U.S.
policy. The madman theory does not explain Hussein's ability to
survive for decades by never crossing the line that would invite his
obliteration. Instead, he is a devious chameleon who was once a U.S.
surrogate and defender of the Arab world in the long, bloody war
against Iran--and then turned around and invaded his Arab neighbor
Kuwait when, according to some reports, U.S. diplomats led him to
understand he could get away with it.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did Hussein use chemical, biological or nuclear weapons
against U.S. troops during the Gulf War that followed, even though
subsequent inspections established that he possessed variants of the
first two. He sacrificed his army and continues to force immense
suffering on his people, but he has been quite effective in
preserving the sanctity and comfort of his own nest.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, Hussein is likely to follow up on last week's
offer for talks on the resumption of inspections by accepting the
conditions imposed by the United Nations. If that happens, the Bush
administration will be in a truly tough spot, as its so-called
axis-of-evil theory disintegrates. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
has already initiated contact with the North Koreans, desperate for
aid, and the theocracy in Iran is gradually crumbling.</TE>
<TE>   Bereft of a credible Evil Empire, the administration will have to
finally hunker down and deal with those forces at home, including
some of the president's Cabinet and business cronies, who so far have
done far more than Hussein to damage America.</TE>

<LD>When Chick Hearn broadcast his first Los Angeles Laker game, March
21, 1961, John F. Kennedy had been in the White House for two months
and a day, Mayor Norman Poulson ran Los Angeles City Hall, "West Side
Story" was soon to dominate the Oscars and Bobby Lewis topped the
charts with "Tossin' and Turnin."</LD>
<LD>   Hearn, 85, the L.A. Lakers' only play-by-play announcer, died
Monday. He called games for 42 seasons, first at the state-of-the-art
Sports Arena in Exposition Park. In 1967, he moved with the team to
the Fabulous Forum, the house that Jack Kent Cooke built. In 1999, he
switched to Staples Center, where this year he broadcast the Lakers'
third consecutive championship.</LD>
<LD>   Hearn told the world when Elgin Baylor scored a club-record 61
points in the 1962 NBA finals against the hated Celtics, a Laker
record that still stands, and when Jerry West threw in his half-court
shot to tie the third game of the NBA finals against the New York
Knicks in 1970.</LD>
<TE>   He gave "the word's-eye view" of the 1971-72 season, when the
Lakers won 33 straight games--still the longest winning streak in
professional sports history--and their first National Basketball
Assn. championship.</TE>
<TE>   He covered Hall of Famers--Baylor, West, Gail Goodrich, Wilt
Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar--and future Hall of Famers--Magic
Johnson and Shaquille O'Neal. He was the link from Tommy Hawkins, a
1961 Laker who is now a Dodger vice president, to Kobe Bryant, the
game's brightest young star.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has ever listened to a Los Angeles Laker game has heard
the rapid-fire delivery of Hearn, but basketball wasn't the only
sport he broadcast. After moving to Los Angeles in 1956, he broadcast
USC football and basketball. During a career that spanned more than
half a century, he also did Nevada-Las Vegas basketball, golf's PGA
Tour, the first Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier fight, the Rose Bowl,
professional tennis and WNBA Sparks games. Even "Bowling for
Dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn might never have called a Laker game if he had won the job
as the voice of the St. Louis Cardinals. That spot went to the late
Jack Buck, also a Hall of Fame broadcaster. That was in 1954, and the
rest is Southern California history.</TE>
<TE>   A lot comes and goes in Los Angeles--term-limited and increasingly
anonymous politicians, hot and then cold television stars. Chick
Hearn was a keeper.</TE>

<HD>Holden's Dubious Legacy</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With less than a year to go before he is termed out of office, Los
Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden is once again burdening taxpayers
with his legal expenses. Talk about a legacy.</LD>
<LD>   This time the bite is $75,000--so far--to defend the longtime
councilman against allegations that he forced a deputy to work on
various political campaigns on city time and fired him after one
campaign was unsuccessful. Previously, the city spent $1.5 million to
defend Holden against sexual harassment charges.</LD>
<LD>   As it had in the earlier lawsuits, the city attorney's office
recused itself from representing Holden, citing a conflict of
interest in a case that involves city employees on both sides.</LD>
<TE>   The City Council had little choice last week but to agree to pay
for private legal representation. But why do so by stealth--an
"emergency" motion, without public notice or even discussion?</TE>
<TE>   The city attorney's office had referred the case to a pool of
outside law firms retained for just such conflicts, but Holden
claimed that the assigned attorney did not return his calls. So he
turned to Mark Geragos, a high-profile defense attorney who is
defending actress Wynona Ryder on shoplifting charges and is a
frequent legal commentator on CNN. Geragos has worked on criminal and
civil defenses for the Holden family before.</TE>
<TE>   When he is not defending himself against lawsuits, Holden has
stayed busy racking up ethics violations for taking money beyond
permissible campaign limits 334 times in his long career. Yet voters
in his district continued to reelect him, albeit in closer races than
the cake walk afforded other incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   Voters often say he delivers on constituent services such as
filling potholes and trimming trees. Just imagine, then, what
services the city could provide with the almost $1.6 million that has
gone toward defending Holden so far. The city could do any one of the
following:</TE>
<TE>   * buy 8,000 library books;</TE>
<TE>   * refurbish 74 parks;</TE>
<TE>   * hire 34 police officers;</TE>
<TE>   * train 200 bomb-sniffing dogs;</TE>
<TE>   * expand the LA's BEST after-school program to 20 more schools;</TE>
<TE>   * fill 160,000 potholes.</TE>
<TE>   Now that would be a legacy.</TE>

<DH>Information blackout on arrests in post-9/11 sweep
undermines American values.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Washington had no hesitation last week in ordering
the Justice Department to reveal the names of almost 1,200 people it
jailed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. "Secret arrests are 'a
concept odious to a democratic society,' and profoundly antithetical
to the bedrock values that characterize a free and open one such as
ours," said U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler, quoting an earlier
ruling in her own decision.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft should let the matter rest there. He's
likely to appeal, however, just as he has in related challenges since
the detentions.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers with two dozen human rights and civil liberties groups
filed the Freedom of Information Act challenge late last year after
the Justice Department rebuffed request after request to say whom it
had rounded up and why, and where it had jailed these men and women.</LD>
<TE>   The department insisted--and continues to insist--that secrecy was
necessary to keep information from Osama bin Laden and other
terrorists still at large. If terrorists don't know who's in jail,
such logic goes, they can't know what the government knows about
their plans for attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Kessler, like most people who care about civil liberties, didn't
buy that argument. The vast majority of those swept up after the
World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks have been released from jail
or deported on immigration violations. None of those rounded up,
including the 73 believed to remain behind bars, have been charged
publicly with terrorism-related crimes.</TE>
<TE>   But even if the U.S. had nabbed Bin Laden himself, the ends don't
justify the means. Americans depend on the transparency of their
legal and political institutions to protect what Kessler called
America's "core values of openness, government accountability and the
rule of law." For that reason, "the public's interest in learning the
identity of those arrested and detained is essential to verifying
whether the government is operating within the bounds of law."</TE>
<TE>   Kessler gave the Justice Department 15 days to turn over a list of
the people jailed since 9/11. She said she would consider requests to
keep some names under wraps if prosecutors could demonstrate that a
detainee had knowledge of a terrorist conspiracy or specifically
requested secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, federal judges in Detroit and New Jersey have
ordered an end to secret deportation hearings, and a Manhattan
federal judge in April limited the government's use of the federal
material witness law to hold suspects indefinitely and secretly.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft has appealed each decision.</TE>
<TE>   Right after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, it was impossible to know what else terrorists might be
planning. There was an understandable impulse to cast a broad net for
people and information. But the post-Sept. 11 emergency does not
justify long-term changes that would snuff out the light and openness
that distinguish our democracy from the tyrannies that would destroy
it.</TE>

<LD>Re "Blast Kills 7 at University in Jerusalem," Aug. 1: The prophet
Muhammad said, "The ink of the scholar is more sacred than the blood
of the martyr." The late Abdus Salam, a tireless humanitarian and the
first Muslim to receive the Nobel Prize in physics, emphatically
argued that the Islamic civilization's path to renaissance lies in
the Koran's instruction to pursue knowledge and understanding, the
holiest of activities.</LD>
<LD>   It is not, then, without a sense of irony that the victims of the
horrendous bombing of Hebrew University were true martyrs, according
to Islam, whose sacred blood was spilled in their pursuit of
knowledge.</LD>
<LD>   It is time that Muslims throughout the world collectively unite
and proclaim, in the loudest possible voice, that terrorism in any
form is an ugly and un-Islamic practice. Failing to collectively
denounce terrorism amounts to creating a superficial Muslim
solidarity that includes the apologetics for terrorism. This then
gives certain bigoted individuals the tools with which to
misrepresent Islam. True Muslim solidarity must include a clear and
concise denunciation of terrorism, whenever and wherever its ugly
head appears.</LD>
<TE>   The grievances of Muslims can never justify turning a blind eye to
terrorism or being apologetic for terrorists.</TE>

<TE>   If King Abdullah II of Jordan wants to accelerate the timetable
for Palestinian statehood, he's talking to the wrong person ("Bush
Says Push for Peace Will Continue," Aug. 2). Instead of asking
President Bush to pressure Israel, he himself should demand that
Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Yasser Arafat's Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and
the Tanzim murderers stop the terror attacks directed against
innocent Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   When Israeli mothers can send their children off to school on a
bus or let their kids go to a disco or pizzeria without having to
worry that their sons and daughters may be killed by a Palestinian
suicide bomber, Israel will be more than willing to help the
Palestinians build a state.</TE>

<LD>"On Their Own and Uninsured" (July 31) highlights a national problem
that calls for a national solution before millions more working
Americans lose their health insurance coverage. No state, even one as
large as California, can solve the problem on its own. The American
College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine, the
second-largest physician organization in the United States, has
proposed a plan to cover all Americans within the next seven years.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal would establish uniform eligibility rules for
Medicaid and each state's Children's Health Insurance Program,
guarantee adequate federal funding support for such programs, create
an innovative income-based premium support program to help
individuals buy coverage on their own or through an employer and
require that insurers set their premiums based on the health risks of
the entire community, not on the health of the individual being
insured. Coverage would no longer be dependent on where a person
worked or where he or she lived.</LD>
<LD>   It is time for all of us to call on those running for Congress to
commit to cover everyone by the end of this decade.</LD>

<HD>Does the Evidence Support an Attack on Iraq?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush and the White House are determined to attack and
topple Saddam Hussein. So it does not matter to them that both the
FBI and CIA, the nation's top spy agencies, have concluded that Iraq
was not involved in the Sept. 11 attacks ("U.S. Returns to Theory of
Iraqi Link to Sept. 11," Aug. 2). Bush &amp; Co. believe Hussein is
guilty, so he must be guilty. Is it coincidence that this news item
was reported on the same front page as the arrest of two former top
WorldCom executives, Scott Sullivan and David Myers, for allegedly
cooking the books? The philosophy of the administration and its
corporate friends seems to be that "If the evidence is not there, go
ahead and create it."</LD>

<TE>   Thank you for publishing "Scientist Warns of Iraq's Nuclear Gains"
(Aug. 1). Instead of contemplating possible military campaigns
against Iraq, perhaps we should be asking why we're considering
attacking a country that we gave military support and aid to up until
1990.</TE>
<TE>   The United States approved the licensed sale of the components
used to create the very weapons of mass destruction that now prompt
talk of invasion. We need a foreign policy that does not buy
short-term safety at the expense of long-term security.</TE>

<TE>   Given Hussein's track record in human treachery, it is conceivable
that he is planning a surprise attack on the U.S. He could have a
weapon of mass destruction placed in the hands of a sleeper cell in
the U.S. today.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a question of if but when Hussein will use such a weapon
on humanity. I support any plan the Bush administration will use to
force him from power and free the Iraqi people and humanity from an
oppressive, evil dictator.</TE>

<TE>   I never imagined it was possible to be more afraid of my own
government than all those foreign regimes that hate us. Here's the
Bush team, preparing to plunge us (unilaterally) into a war with
Iraq--with God knows what consequences in American lives, or how much
hatred engendered in other Muslim countries. And Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft, proposing TIPS, a plan to induce 10 million Americans to
spy on the rest--shades of China and Nazi Germany. And Ashcroft
arbitrarily holding hundreds of people incommunicado in American
jails, exactly as all dreaded totalitarian regimes have done
throughout history.</TE>
<TE>   Where did our administration suddenly get all this power, and why
aren't ordinary Americans screaming to the heavens?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"After Police Incident, Some Fear Inglewood Will Take a Beating"
(July 23) did not provide an accurate portrayal of Inglewood, and the
photo at the top of the article--of the child playing in what you
described as the "rundown Darby-Dixon neighborhood of Inglewood,
which has a long-standing gang problem"--was particularly troubling,
as it clearly does not reflect an accurate picture of Inglewood.</LD>
<LD>   The Darby-Dixon neighborhood is a small part of the entire story
of the city of Inglewood. Inglewood has a significant African
American population, the majority of which are homeowners who take
great pride in their property. In fact, our local neighborhoods are
what most would consider model all-American middle-class communities.
The photo of a broken chain-link fence, metal bars and
graffiti-covered walls paints a very unflattering picture of
Inglewood that is not entirely accurate. In the future, I hope
Inglewood receives the kind of balanced coverage that presents a fair
and accurate picture of our entire city.</LD>

<LD>Katherine Harris once again ignores the law and gets away with it
("Election Chief Quits Belatedly," Aug. 2). We all know why her boss,
Gov. Jeb Bush, wanted her as the enforcer of Florida's election laws
when his brother ran for president, and clearly it was not for her
competence. Nor is Bush or Harris much concerned with the fact that
she is required to resign immediately, not retroactively, and not
after her replacement is found. What, they don't have an assistant
secretary of state in Florida?</LD>
<LD>   After her blatant favoritism in stopping the 2000 Florida recount,
is anyone surprised that Harris thought the law did not apply to her
office?</LD>

<LD>Re "Ballad of the Poor Samaritan," Aug. 2: Hooray for the honesty of
Ascension Franco Gonzales, who demonstrated integrity instead of
jeopardizing his future. Money that falls from another's possession
is not money from God; it is owned by the individual or entity that
earned it. Franco did the right thing. He has been an example of
honesty and integrity to millions of people. His single act of
honesty will have a greater influence on society than he will ever
know. Franco understands that no money can buy peace of mind--as a
credit card company advertises: "Priceless."</LD>
<LD>   I can only imagine a hundred years from now that his
great-great-grandchildren will be telling the story of how their
great-great-grandfather demonstrated honesty and integrity by
returning money that wasn't his. By his example many generations have
learned honesty, integrity and hard work. They will not call him an
idiot; they will hail him as a great person with high morals. Hooray
for Franco's parents, who instilled in their children right from
wrong. Hooray for Franco, who is truly a hero of honesty. I can only
hope that my children will remember the morals that we have taught
them when faced with a similar situation.</LD>

<TE>   What a stark contrast of news brought to me by The Times' front
page Aug. 2.</TE>
<TE>   An American citizen, white and rich, carted off to jail in
handcuffs for allegedly hiding almost $4 billion for WorldCom
("Former Phone Execs Arrested"). Meanwhile, a couple of columns over,
I read that an illegal immigrant returns $203,000 that falls into his
lap from a passing armored truck.</TE>
<TE>   This is for all Proposition 187 supporters: It's time to stop
blaming immigrants for all our woes. Take a hard, cold glare in the
mirror and realize that the greatest threat to our society is
ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Why was it that the best of what we want out of America--honesty,
hard work, the ability to do the right thing when confronted with
choices--was reflected in the actions of an illegal immigrant and not
in the deeds of a corporate chief executive? I'd take an Ascension
Franco Gonzales over a Scott Sullivan [former WorldCom chief
financial officer] any day.</TE>

<HD>Roy Kral, 80; Jazz Duo Star</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roy Kral, the pianist, singer and arranger who was half of one of the
most enduring duos in jazz--Jackie and Roy--has died. He was 80.</LD>
<LD>   Kral died of congestive heart failure Friday at his home in
Montclair, N.J., said his wife and musical partner, Jackie Cain.</LD>
<LD>   In a career spanning more than half a century, Jackie and Roy
brought an effervescence to the jazz repertoire, mixing it with bebop
and scat-like singing called vocalese to create their own distinct
style.</LD>
<TE>   They recorded more than 30 albums, covering everything from jazz
standards to the work of the Beatles. Among their most popular
recordings were their versions of "Mountain Greenery" and "Spring Can
Really Hang You Up the Most."</TE>
<TE>   And they did it in a manner that critics embraced.</TE>
<TE>   "They focused on songs that were not necessarily well known but
were classic popular songs," jazz critic Nat Hentoff said Monday.
"Unlike today, you could hear the lyrics and they were worth hearing.
There was a spirit in what they did that was just enticing."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Cicero, Ill., Kral took classical piano lessons as a boy.
Inspired by the pianist Earl Hines, he switched to jazz in the
mid-1930s. After playing in Army bands during World War II, he found
work as a staff arranger at a Detroit radio station. He soon moved to
Chicago and joined a quartet led by George Davis as pianist and
arranger.</TE>
<TE>   Despite some initial opposition from Kral, Jackie Cain, a young
singer from Milwaukee, joined the group a short time later.</TE>
<TE>   Kral and Cain left to join saxophonist Charlie Ventura's "Bop for
the People" combo in 1948. With Ventura, Kral served as the group's
pianist and sometime arranger. He is credited with giving the band
excellent arrangements of such tunes as "Pennies From Heaven" and
"Flamingo."</TE>
<TE>   The duo's stay with Ventura was brief, lasting about a year and a
half. They were married in 1949 and went out on their own to form a
bebop sextet.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s, they moved to Chicago, where they had their own
television show. They worked with Ventura again for a brief time in
1953, but continued to focus on their career as a duo, playing the
supper-club circuit in New York, for several years in Las Vegas and,
later, Los Angeles before returning to New York in the early 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Kral formed a company that produced jingles for television
commercials. Their voices were heard in TV spots for Halo shampoo,
Cheerios and Plymouth.</TE>
<TE>   And though the pay and hours were good, the music in commercials
was less than what they wanted to pursue. They quit the commercial
business and went back into jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Their later performances reflected their early tasteful work.</TE>
<TE>   "Their formula is as simple as ever: mainly octave unison vocals,
with moments of two-part harmony, and occasional wordless passages
that are too elegant to be stigmatized as scat singing," jazz critic
Leonard Feather wrote in a review of a performance in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "Their work had a delicacy, a subtlety and joy to it," Hentoff
said. "It was all done with best possible taste and first-class
musicianship. They were having fun, and it was infectious."</TE>
<TE>   Kral, whose sister, singer Irene Kral, died in 1978, is survived
by his wife and daughters Tiffany Bolling-Casares of Los Angeles,
Dana Kral of Montclair, N.J., and Carol May of Elgin, Ill.</TE>

<LD>Kohei Matsuda, 80, a former president of Mazda Motor Corp. and the
owner of the Japanese professional baseball club Hiroshima Toyo Carp,
died July 10 of stomach cancer at Keio Gijuku University Hospital in
Tokyo.</LD>
<LD>   The grandson of Mazda's founder, Jujiro Matsuda, he joined the
family business--then known as Toyo Kogyo--in 1961 as a vice
president.</LD>
<LD>   He helped the Hiroshima-based company introduce the Cosmo sports
coupe in 1967, the first car in Japan powered by a rotary engine.</LD>
<TE>   Matsuda became president of Mazda in 1970, succeeding his father,
Tsuneji, and steered the automaker through a period of declining
earnings.</TE>
<TE>   He retired from the presidency in 1977 and served as chairman for
the following three years, overseeing Mazda's 1979 capital
association with Ford Motor Co. Ford now owns about one-third of the
Japanese firm.</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, Matsuda became owner of the Hiroshima Carp and
invigorated the baseball franchise by instructing scouts to go after
young unknown players.</TE>
<TE>   The team won the first of six Central League pennants in 1975, and
captured the first of its three Japanese championship titles in 1979.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bernard Haldane, 91, a pioneering expert on career counseling and
author of 14 books, including "Career Satisfaction and Success: How
to Know and Manage Your Strengths," died July 21. He died of unstated
causes in Seattle, where he had lived since 1977.</LD>
<LD>   Born and educated in London, Haldane moved to New York City in the
late 1920s and became a labor relations consultant. He was also a
member of the Society for the Advancement of Management, which later
asked him to help returning World War II officers find work, which he
did without pay.</LD>
<LD>   In 1947, Haldane founded Bernard Haldane Associates, the career
consulting firm that now has nearly 100 offices in the U.S., Canada
and Britain. He sold the company in the early 1970s.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to counseling individuals about managing their
careers, Haldane worked with institutions including the Atomic Energy
Commission, Exxon, the Harvard Graduate School of Business
Administration, the Peace Corps and the United Presbyterian Church.</TE>

<LD>Archer Martin, 92, a chemist who shared the Nobel Prize in 1952 for
his work in separating complex mixtures, died July 28. No place or
specific cause of death was listed, although Martin had suffered from
Alzheimer's disease.</LD>
<LD>   The technique for which Martin and his colleague Richard Synge won
the chemistry Nobel is known as partition chromatography. The term
refers to the technique of separating and isolating the fundamental
chemicals in complex solutions.</LD>
<LD>   Developed while they were working for the wool industry in the
1940s, their technique enabled scientists to analyze the structures
of proteins and other complex organic substances.</LD>
<TE>   The London-born son of a doctor and nurse, Martin earned
bachelor's and doctoral degrees in biochemistry at Cambridge
University, and performed research successively for the Wool
Industries Research Assn., the Boots pharmacy chain and for Britain's
Medical Research Council.</TE>
<TE>   During his retirement years, he taught at the University of Sussex
and was a visiting professor at the University of Houston in Texas
and the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland.</TE>

<HD>Royals Halt Twins' Streak</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stung by four consecutive one-run losses, the Kansas City Royals
ended their frustrations against the Minnesota Twins on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Luis Alicea hit a three-run homer and Carlos Febles went four for
four to help the Royals to a 12-4 victory at Minneapolis, ending the
Twins' winning streak at five games.</LD>
<LD>   "That's what we needed," Febles said, "to come out and play a game
like this."</LD>
<TE>   The bottom third of Kansas City's order--Neifi Perez, Brent Mayne
and Febles--went 10 for 15 with nine runs scored and three RBIs.
Alicea had four RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels good to leave this place with a win," Alicea said.
"Minnesota has a great team."</TE>
<TE>   After losing six in a row, Kansas City got 17 hits and avoided its
first four-game sweep at the Metrodome. The Royals, 4-11 against
Minnesota this year, have outscored the Twins, 73-68. They scored
more than four runs for the first time in 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   Royal rookie Shawn Sedlacek (2-2) won despite giving up four runs,
eight hits and five walks in 6 2/3 innings. Sedlacek gave up two
sacrifice flies, to Denny Hocking in the second and Bobby Kielty in
the sixth, then faded in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Rivas hit an RBI double, and Cristian Guzman drove him in
with an infield single. But Scott Mullen relieved Sedlacek and got
David Ortiz to hit into an inning-ending double play.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Mays (1-3) gave up eight runs and 12 hits in 5 2/3 innings for
Minnesota. His fourth start since spending three months on the
disabled list with elbow inflammation was by far his worst.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny how it works," Mays said. "I thought I had good stuff.
It seems like every ball they put in play seemed to find a hole."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins are 19-5 since the All-Star break and 16 games ahead of
Chicago in the American League Central.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 7, Baltimore 1--Steve Parris gave up one run and six hits
in eight innings to win his fifth consecutive decision and Luke
Prokopec finished with a perfect ninth for the Blue Jays at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Hudson, Chris Woodward and Dewayne Wise homered for the
Blue Jays.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Cruz Jr., who went three for four with a walk, hit an RBI
double in the third and Woodward homered leading off the fourth for a
2-1 lead. Hudson hit his first major league home run later in the
inning, a two-run drive.</TE>
<TE>   Oriole rookie Rodrigo Lopez (12-4), who had been unbeaten in six
starts since June 20, gave up five runs and eight hits in five
innings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 4, Tampa Bay 3--Mark Johnson hit a tiebreaking triple in
the ninth to lead the White Sox at St. Petersburg, Fla. After Joe
Crede hit a one-out single off Esteban Yan (5-6), Johnson tripled
into the right-field corner.</TE>
<TE>   Aubrey Huff hit a three-run homer for the Devil Rays, who split
the four-game series. Tampa Bay has not won a series since June 28-30
against Florida.</TE>
<TE>   White Sox starter Jon Garland, who retired his last 11 batters,
gave up three runs and three hits in seven innings. He had a
career-high eight strikeouts and two walks.</TE>

<HD>Detroit's Fick Eyes Anaheim</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The Angels did not trade for Robert Fick this summer, but he would be
thrilled if they did this winter.</LD>
<LD>   Fick, the Detroit Tigers' only All-Star this season, could provide
an appealing alternative to Brad Fullmer at designated hitter next
season. The Angels inquired about Fick last month, before they
acquired outfielder Alex Ochoa. But the Tigers would not have traded
him for the price the Angels paid for Ochoa--backup catcher Jorge
Fabregas and two non-prospect minor leaguers.</LD>
<LD>   Fick grew up in Thousand Oaks, played at Cal State
Northridge--with Angel second baseman Adam Kennedy--and lives in
Manhattan Beach. Fick knew the Angels were interested in him, and the
interest was mutual.</LD>
<TE>   "It would have been sweet," he said. It would have been like a
dream come true, to get to go play at home and especially to play
with Adam again. You always want to be around guys who you know can
play the game and all that matters to them is winning.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at that Angel team, and they don't have the biggest
names, but they know how to win. It's awesome. It seems like it's a
different guy every night. That's how you win."</TE>
<TE>   Fick, 28, is eligible for salary arbitration, but even at double
his current $1.15-million salary he would be more affordable than
Fullmer, 27, also eligible for arbitration and making $3.75 million
this season. Both bat left-handed, but Fick has proven he can hit
left-handers. He is hitting .276 against them this season. Fullmer,
albeit in limited chances, is hitting .192 against lefties.</TE>
<TE>   The last-place Tigers desperately need prospects, particularly
pitchers. The Angels could provide one in triple-A right-hander Chris
Bootcheck, a former first-round draft choice whose father pitched in
the Tigers' minor league system.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitching coach Bud Black said the Angels have no plans for Ramon
Ortiz to skip a start so he can put in extra work fixing his flawed
delivery. Ortiz, who did not survive the fifth inning of Sunday's
loss to the New York Yankees, has won once in his last eight starts,
with a 5.40 earned-run average in that stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Black said the flaw--the front shoulder flies open, enabling too
many pitches to sail over the plate--is similar to one reliever Al
Levine had earlier this season, when he was hampered by tendinitis in
his pitching shoulder. But Black said Ortiz is not injured.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been a little streaky this year, but he's bounced back,"
Black said. "We look for him to bounce back again."</TE>

<TE>   Update--Outfielder Garret Anderson missed his second consecutive
start because of a strained right hamstring but is expected to play
tonight. The Angels believe outfielder Julio Ramirez (strained calf)
can complete a rehabilitation assignment this month and rejoin the
team when rosters expand Sept. 1. They are uncertain, but hopeful,
that reliever Dennis Cook (torn labrum and rotator cuff) can follow
the same timetable.</TE>

<LD>Texas Ranger pitcher John Rocker issued a written apology Monday for
anti-gay remarks he made toward patrons of a popular eatery.</LD>
<LD>   Rocker said he was with his girlfriend on Sunday at Breadwinners
Cafe &amp; Bakery in Dallas when some customers began badgering him.</LD>
<LD>   "It seemed as if they were trying to bait me with suggestive
comments," Rocker said in the statement.</LD>
<TE>   Rocker said he finished his meal and got up to leave. Then, he
said, the unidentified patrons followed him out of the restaurant,
located in a predominantly gay neighborhood, and made an obscene
gesture.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point, I admit I was angry and said some things I
probably should not have said, but I wanted to make it clear their
attentions were unwelcome," he said. Ranger spokesman John Blake said
the remarks were anti-gay in nature but Rocker's specific comments
were unknown.</TE>

<TE>   A man pleaded no contest to stealing Jackie Robinson's National
League championship ring and was sentenced to 180 days in jail.
Miguel Rodriguez, 21, of Los Angeles entered the plea to charges of
receiving stolen property and to grand theft of personal property,
Deputy District Attorney Louis Parise said. Robinson's
brother-in-law, Charles Raymond, inherited the ring after Robinson's
death in 1972. He reported that it had been stolen from his home last
year. Rodriguez was arrested in April after selling the ring, valued
at $12,000, to a pawnbroker for $100. The owner of Mr. Steve's Pawn
Shop on Western Avenue recognized the ring and called police.... Ted

<LD>Last season, Oregon spent $250,000 to put the likeness of quarterback
Joey Harrington on a building across the street from New York City's
Madison Square Garden.</LD>
<LD>   This year, the Ducks placed wide receiver Keenan Howry's picture
on a Times Square billboard for $300,000, which includes $50,000 for
air time on the YES Network to televise Oregon games on a delayed
basis.</LD>
<LD>   William C. Rhoden of the New York Times questions Oregon's latest
marketing plan.</LD>
<TE>   "Welcome to the multimillion-dollar world of college football, an
industry where employees are called amateurs and employer-employee
contracts are called scholarships. Howry looks Jim Thorpe-like, in
black socks, black shoes, green jersey, helmet in hand, black
armband, looking down on a daily throng of tourists, theatergoers and
diners. He is surrounded by bright lights, advertisements for plays
and products, gigantic images of the 'Today' show stars. In the
middle of all this is a college football player--an amateur.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where Oregon crossed the line that divides gaudy
innovation from exploitation. Putting Harrington on a billboard to
promote his candidacy for the Heisman Trophy is one thing. Putting
Howry on a billboard to promote the university, the Oregon football
program and a television deal is exploitive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the modern record for most punt returns in
a Rose Bowl game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Summer league champs: The Denver Nuggets, who have had six coaches
over the last six years, are the only team in the NBA without a head
coach, but that hasn't stopped the franchise from getting excited
about the team's 6-0 summer-league record at the Rocky Mountain Revue
in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great experience for them because they learned a lot,"
Denver assistant Jeff Bzdelik told the Denver Post. "They played
against people that will be playing in this league. We're going to go
back and review the things they did well, and mistakes. It's
something to build on."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Circus birds: Thanks to the arrival of quarterback Michael Vick,
people in Atlanta are excited about the Falcons' chances this season,
but Terence Moore of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution is a little
more skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "The Falcons are resurrecting Dirty Bird fever, with a charismatic
new owner, his expansive wallet and a slew of public relations moves
along the lines of Barnum &amp; Bailey, Bill Veeck or maybe just Home
Depot. But Falcon players aren't doing the talking, and neither are
Falcon coaches. It's just ownership, through the use of those
gimmicks. Gimmicks are entertaining, but they also are temporary.
Gimmicks work until the opening faceoff, tip, pitch or kickoff, and
then it's about winning."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: USC's Randy Tanner, who returned seven punts for 90
yards against Michigan State in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: After Cleveland traded point guard Andre Miller to
the Clippers for small forward Darius Miles, the Cavaliers' Lamond
Murray, rumored to be on the trading block despite averaging a
career-high 16.6 points at small forward last season, questioned the
direction of the franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year we keep rebuilding a house on no foundation. Ask
yourself, how many promises would you keep believing if you were
leading the team with scoring and your family and fans can't even
purchase your jersey from the team store?"</TE>

<LD>   What: "The Life"</LD>
<LD>   Where: ESPN, tonight, 6:30</LD>
<TE>   This episode of the weekly ESPN series shows that, despite what
Thomas Wolfe wrote, you can go home again. At least Tony Gonzalez
can.</TE>
<TE>   In one segment of this show, the Kansas City Chiefs' All-Pro tight
end returns to Huntington Beach High and visits with four of his
former coaches. He played football and basketball in high school and
also in college at California.</TE>
<TE>   Another segment focuses on Gonzalez's efforts to make it in the
NBA. Cameras follow Gonzalez from his apartment in Manhattan Beach to
a recent Summer Pro League game at Long Beach State. Gonzalez suits
up for a Miami Heat team but does not play.</TE>
<TE>   The cameras are back at a Heat practice the next day, but Gonzalez
is not there.</TE>
<TE>   Making it to the NBA had been his goal, but he says one can become
too attached to one's goals. Also, he says he wants to spend more
time with his 1-year-old son Niko.</TE>
<TE>   The show opens in Manhattan Beach, where the surfers don't even
know who Gonzalez is. One female surfer says of the Chiefs, "That's a
baseball team, right?" A surfer named Jim Miller, who says he has
never heard of Gonzalez, ends up befriending him and teaching him to
surf.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez's mother, Judy, is a big part of the show. "He always
loved playing basketball," she says, "but he always knew his paycheck
would come from football."</TE>
<TE>   In the final segment, Gonzalez and teammate Warren Moon meet for
lunch and throw a football around with some hotel parking attendants.</TE>
<TE>   It's a fun show, but somewhat lacking journalistically. Gonzalez
does not address his current contract dispute with the Chiefs. And
though there is a glimpse of Heat Coach Pat Riley, he is not
interviewed. It's not clear exactly why Gonzalez didn't get to play
in that summer league game, or why his attempt to make in the NBA has
apparently failed.</TE>

<HD>Watson Says Baseball Will Not Penalize Gagne</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>All-Star closer Eric Gagne will not be disciplined for hitting a
batter with a pitch in a loss to the Cincinnati Reds, a high-ranking
baseball official said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Watson, in charge of on-field discipline, made his ruling
after baseball's three-day investigation into the events that
preceded the ninth-inning ejections of Gagne and Manager Jim Tracy in
a 6-4, 13-inning loss on Thursday at Cinergy Field.</LD>
<LD>   "After reviewing the situation, we have determined that no
disciplinary action needs to be handed down from the office of the
commissioner," Watson said. "We feel that, in this incident, it just
would not be appropriate to take any action."</LD>
<TE>   Gagne expressed relief.</TE>
<TE>   "That's awesome," said Gagne, who made contact with umpire Dan
Iassogna while arguing. "I'm happy it's not going to hurt us in the
future, because the bullpen would have been real short-handed if they
suspended me."</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Nelson, vice president of umpiring, quickly determined that
Iassogna erred in ruling Adam Dunn was intentionally hit after a
two-run homer by Aaron Boone, the previous batter, had cut the
Dodgers' lead to 4-2. Nelson, who had a 45-minute meeting with Tracy
and General Manager Dan Evans on Friday, agreed with the Dodgers,
saying a pitcher in that situation would not intentionally hit a
batter and bring the potential tying run to the plate.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson recommended that Watson should "not do anything to Gagne,"
and Watson agreed after reviewing tapes of the incident. Nelson would
be responsible for taking action against Iassogna, whom he was
scheduled to interview in person Monday.</TE>
<TE>   However, Nelson reaffirmed he probably would not discipline
Iassogna, a reserve umpire from triple-A with extensive service in
the majors, because he made a judgment call and "believed he did the
right thing at the time."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball wants to close the door on the embarrassing matter, and
Watson's ruling was the first step in the process.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a whole lot of things that happened to the Dodgers as
a result of the umpire making that call, and we just really felt that
nothing else needed to be done," Watson said. "Their closer and
manager were ejected, they lost the game and had to make roster moves
because of all the pitchers they had to use.</TE>
<TE>   "Ralph traveled to Philadelphia to have a special meeting with the
Dodgers, which we felt was very productive. We talked a lot after
that, and it was clear to us [that nothing should be done]. This was
a very difficult situation for the Dodgers."</TE>
<TE>   Evans applauded the commissioner's office for its swift action.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully it will put an end to this entire situation," he said.
"It's time for us to move on."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said Alex Cora, one of the club's biggest surprises, and
Cesar Izturis would platoon at shortstop the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Cora started for the fourth game in row at shortstop Monday,
getting a run-scoring double in a 7-5 loss to the Philadelphia
Phillies at Veterans Stadium. Tracy said he is not disappointed in
the switch-hitting Izturis, batting .288 right-handed and .197
left-handed, but needs Cora's production for the playoff push.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to batting .299, Cora has been the club's most
productive pinch-hitter, batting .355 (11 for 31) with a home run and
three runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to do what's in the best interest of the group now,"
Tracy said. "I've got to give Alex more playing time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown said he did not experience back or elbow pain after a
70-pitch bullpen session on Monday at Dodger Stadium, and is
scheduled to throw again Wednesday before making his second
rehabilitation start Friday for triple-A Las Vegas at Edmonton. Tracy
said Brown, expected to be activated after his next start, would
throw about 80 pitches against Edmonton.... Third baseman Adrian
Beltre is 15 for 43 with four homers and 15 runs batted in during his
last 10 games.... The Dodgers are last in the National League in
walks with 292. The Dodgers and Detroit Tigers are the only clubs in
the major leagues with fewer than 300 walks.... Philadelphia starter
Brandon Duckworth struck out the first six Dodger batters Monday.</TE>

<HD>Hall of Fame Ceremony Has California Flavor</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Cigar, Serena's Song and Noor, and jockey
Westrope had strong ties to the state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a distinct California feel to the National Museum of
Racing's Hall of Fame induction ceremony Monday at Saratoga Springs,
N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Thoroughbred inductees Cigar, Serena's Song and Noor combined to
make 39 starts at various tracks in the state and their owners all
live or lived in California.</LD>
<LD>   And Jockey Jack Westrope was a regular on the local circuit before
he was killed at Hollywood Park in 1958.</LD>
<TE>   Only Bud Delp, the trainer who was honored, was based elsewhere,
primarily in Maryland. Even so, Spectacular Bid, Delp's most famous
horse, had success in California, winning six consecutive graded
stakes between Jan. 5 and June 8, 1980, at Santa Anita and Hollywood
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Cigar, the most dominant thoroughbred in the 1990s, was presented
by Les Benton, the chairman of the Dubai World Cup, a race the son of
Palace Music won when it was held for the first time in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   It was the horse's 14th consecutive victory during a streak that
reached 16 before it was ended by Dare And Go in the 1996 Pacific
Classic at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Benton gave the plaque to Madeleine Paulson, the widow of Cigar's
owner, Allen Paulson.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure that Allen is looking down on us right now and I can
assure him that not even [Fidel] Castro had a Cigar as good as this
one," she said. "I owned Cigar for the first two victories [of his
winning streak] and then I panicked. Allen always had the courage to
push the horse to the top."</TE>
<TE>   Paulson also acknowledged Bill Mott, Cigar's trainer during the
best part of his career, and jockey Jerry Bailey.</TE>
<TE>   "I fell in love with racing when I first started riding," said
Bailey, "but I never really loved a horse until Cigar. He will always
be very special in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Serena's Song, a daughter of Rahy, who was racing's all-time
earning female until Spain overtook her earlier this year, was
presented by her former trainer Wayne Lukas. He presented the plaque
to owners Bob and Beverly Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember at Keeneland [yearling sale] in July of 1993," said
Bob Lewis. "I was sitting next to Wayne and he told me this one is
going to fall through the cracks and he was so right.</TE>
<TE>   "She has been in our possession for nine years and has been an
absolute joy. She was a marvelous performer as a racehorse and we are
equally proud of her as a broodmare. She is the epitome."</TE>
<TE>   Purchased by the Lewises at the sale for $150,000, Serena's Song
wound up winning 18 of 38 races and earned nearly $3.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Every one of us has a special moment in time or a song that
brings back a memory. A first date, a dance. We all have our special
song. For Wayne Lukas and Bob and Beverly Lewis, Serena was our
song," Lukas said.</TE>
<TE>   "She had the elegance of Grace Kelly, the moves of Ginger Rogers
and the charisma of Marilyn Monroe. And for those of you too young to
know who they are, she had the moves of Janet Jackson and the
charisma of Britney Spears."</TE>
<TE>   The presentation of Noor's plaque to Col. Michael Howard, the
great-grandson of owner Charles Howard, was made by Mike Kane, vice
president of the National Turf Writers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In a career in which he raced in Europe and the United States, the
Irish-bred Noor won 12 of 31 races and was the first horse to beat
two Triple Crown champions.</TE>
<TE>   He defeated Citation, the 1948 Triple Crown hero, four times in
1950 and Assault, the 1946 Triple Crown winner, in an allowance race
at Hollywood Park on. Dec. 1, 1950.</TE>
<TE>   Delp, whose stable had earned $37.5 million before this year, has
been a trainer for about 40 years, winning more than 3,500 races and
leading numerous meets at Pimlico, Delaware Park, Monmouth Park,
Hawthorne and Arlington.</TE>
<TE>   His plaque was presented by Harry Meyerhoff, a longtime friend and
the owner of Spectacular Bid, generally regarded as one of the
greatest horses of all time.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been going to the Keeneland September sales for 35 years
with Bud and in that time we've bought 220 horses," Meyerhoff said.
"Only seven of them never started and five more never won a race.
Twenty of them were stakes winners and three were millionaires. Bud
has been training for me for all this time, and I believe the primary
reason why we've lasted so long together is that we both realize that
the three most important things in horse racing is patience, patience
and patience."</TE>

Westrope was his daughter, Pamela Westrope Donner, and his widow,

<TE>   Before he was fatally injured while riding Well Away in the 1958
Hollywood Oaks, Westrope, who rode for 26 years, won 2,467 races,
which then ranked eighth on the career list.</TE>

<HD>Lawyer: Differences Are 'Solvable'</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Owners' lead labor attorney Manfred says sides
'closer to agreement' on revenue sharing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid a heightened pace and the possibility that the players union
will set a strike date next week if there isn't significant progress
in baseball's collective bargaining talks, lawyers for the players
and owners reached agreement on some of the ancillary issues Monday
while failing to resolve the core issue of revenue sharing.</LD>
<LD>   However, after three separate meetings spanning about six hours,
baseball's lead labor lawyer, Rob Manfred, said the sides were
"closer to an agreement" on that issue</LD>
<LD>   "We have now had a series of days where we have not moved in the
wrong direction [on revenue sharing]," Manfred said in a conference
call with reporters. "I really believe it's solvable."</LD>
<TE>   Manfred has maintained an optimistic tone since negotiations
resumed in earnest after the All-Star break. People close to the
process agree the negotiations have been characterized by civility
and sincerity absent in 1994, but also speculate that Manfred is
trying to create a portrait of good faith bargaining in case the
owners ultimately declare an impasse and attempt to unilaterally
implement new work rules. A federal judge found them guilty of
illegal labor practice after they had implemented in 1994, a ruling
that prompted the players to end their 232-day strike.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Manfred even complimented union negotiators.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the return of union leader Don Fehr to the table after
his tour of the clubs (he still has to meet with the Boston Red Sox)
accelerated the pace of talks, Manfred said, "That one is a no-win
issue for me. I think we made good progress when he was away. He was
here today and I think we made good progress again. I think they've
been very professional about putting themselves in a position to move
forward regardless of who is in the room."</TE>
<TE>   The union has been more cautious in assessing progress, and on the
issue of revenue sharing, which includes differences over the amount
to be shared and method of distribution, union lawyer Michael Weiner
said only, "We're still looking for the right way to bridge the gaps.
We haven't found it yet."</TE>
<TE>   The sides did reach agreement on a package of non-economic issues
dealing with waiver periods, second medical opinions and contract
tendering, and are close to agreement on the minimum salary and
benefit plan, Manfred said.</TE>
<TE>   They also had one of their few discussions to this point on the
contentious issue of a payroll tax, which plays into the revenue
sharing formula. But when asked if the sides could agree on revenue
sharing without including the tax in computations, Manfred said, "The
only way I'll answer that is to say that when we get a deal done, it
will be as an overall package."</TE>
<TE>   Union representatives said they expected to respond to
management's proposal on steroid and drug testing by the end of the
week.</TE>
<TE>   The union's executive board is expected to confer by telephone
today, but is not expected to set a strike date until Monday, when it
may meet in Chicago. If a date is set then, it is expected that it
would be Sept. 1 or Sept. 16.</TE>

<HD>Maleeva Knows Sister Issue</HD>
<DH>Tennis: As the youngest of three siblings, she sees a
difference in scrutiny that the Williamses face.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID CARRILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Magdalena Maleeva loathes the comparisons between her family and the
Williams sisters as much as she did playing her two older sisters.</LD>
<LD>   Maleeva, competing in the JPMorgan Chase Open at Manhattan Beach,
said Monday that she and her older sisters, Katerina and Manuela,
"never received the type of scrutiny that [Serena and Venus] get when
they played each other."</LD>
<LD>   "Nothing negative was ever said or written that we wouldn't try as
hard when we competed against each other," said Magdalena Maleeva
after losing in the second round to Italy's Rita Grande, 4-6, 6-0,
6-3. "Maybe stuff like that is written about them because of racism."</LD>
<TE>   Critics have suggested that Venus and Serena Williams, who began
playing tennis in their youth at neighborhood courts in Compton,
Calif., have let up when they face each other.</TE>
<TE>   The Williams sisters have denied the allegations. They say they
play hard each time they hit the court.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's against Lindsay Davenport or their sister.</TE>
<TE>   But for the Maleevas, the attention was very different. Not as
high profile, the Bulgarian sisters played each other in 15 combined
matches with little fanfare.</TE>
<TE>   Magdalena, 27, said she always had a difficult time facing
Katerina and Manuela, who retired in 1997 and 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to concentrate when you know the person across from you
is your best friend," said Magdalena Maleeva, ranked No. 16 in the
world. "We always tried our best and after a match we never talked
about what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Magdalena faced Katerina and Manuela a combined six times, losing
every time. No one accused her of letting either of her older sisters
advance.</TE>
<TE>   The Maleeva trio made Grand Slam history by being the first
siblings seeded in 1993 at the Australian Open, French Open and
Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   The Williams sisters have taken it a step further. They became
last year not only the first siblings to play in a Grand Slam final
in 117 years, but the first pair of African Americans to play each
other in the final of a major tennis championship.</TE>
<TE>   But outside the Grand Slam events, the Williams sisters often do
what they can to avoid matching up against each other.</TE>
<TE>   At Manhattan Beach, top-seeded Serena Williams will begin play
Wednesday against Lina Krasnoroutskaya of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Venus Williams will sit out this tournament after winning the
Acura Classic title Sunday at Carlsbad.</TE>
<TE>   Without her sisters on the tour, Magdalena Maleeva hasn't lost her
motivation for the game, even though her career has been slowed by a
shoulder injury.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually didn't believe I would come back as strong," she said,
"so I'm very happy with how far I came back."</TE>
<TE>   In other second-round matches, Chanda Rubin defeated Marissa
Irvin, a Studio City Harvard-Westlake High graduate, 6-1, 3-6, 6-2.
Tatiana Panova of Russia defeated Meilen Tu, 6-2, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   In first-round matches, Alexandra Stevenson defeated Elena
Likhovtseva of Russia, 6-4 7-6 (6). Amanda Coetzer of Russia defeated
Jelena Jankovic of Yugoslavia, 6-2, 6-2. Katarina Srebotnik of
Slovenia defeated Paola Suarez of Argentina, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1. Tina
Pisnik of Slovenia defeated Shuai Peng of China, 2-6, 6-2, 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   In doubles, Martina Navratilova and Russia's Liezel Huber beat
Suarez and Uzbekistan's Iroda Tulyaganova, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (8); and
Corina Morariu and Kimberly Po-Messerli beat Slovenia's Tina Krizan
and Srebotnik, 6-2, 6-1.</TE>

<HD>Evans Bruises Spinal Cord</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Houston safety regains some feeling in legs
after being hurt in exhibition. Giants win, 34-17.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEONARD SHAPIRO</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>CANTON, Ohio</DL>
<LD>The expansion Houston Texans' first exhibition game--a 34-17 loss to
the New York Giants--was tinged with sadness Monday night when
reserve safety Leomont Evans had to be rushed to a local hospital
after suffering a bruised spinal cord as he tried to rush a Giant
punter.</LD>
<LD>   Evans, a former Los Angeles Xtreme player in the now-defunct XFL,
was on the right side of the Texans' punt team when he seemed to
lower his head and hit Giant blocker Sean Bennett high. Replays
showed Evans crumpling to the turf, and he remained there even as
Texans' return man Avion Black raced through a seam and returned the
kick 71 yards to the Giants' 18-yard line.</LD>
<LD>   Play was halted for almost 15 minutes as medical officials from
both teams and paramedics on the scene worked on Evans at the Giants'
30; players from both teams kneeled in prayer. He was taken to nearby
Aultman Hospital. By game's end, Evans, 28, had some feeling in both
legs and had regained movement in his upper extremities and was
undergoing further tests.</LD>
<TE>   "That's one of the toughest things to go through, when one of your
brothers goes down," said David Carr, the Texans' 23-year-old rookie
quarterback. "That [praying] wasn't fake. That could have been any of
us."</TE>
<TE>   In the game, David Carr made it clear why the expansion Houston
team made him the No. 1 overall pick in the April college draft. He
showed brilliant flashes despite an offensive line missing starters
Tony Boselli (shoulder surgery) and Ryan Young (pulled groin).</TE>
<TE>   Before being replaced in the third quarter, Carr completed nine of
17 passes for 96 yards and a touchdown and showed scrambling ability
when he avoided Michael Strahan with a lovely move to avoid a major
loss.</TE>
<TE>   "I like him," said Strahan, who broke an NFL sack record with 22
1/2 last year. "He got around me, so that shows he can move. He
showed composure in the pocket, and he'll get better with time. He
can throw the ball. Once their offense jells, they'll be an exciting
team to watch because of him."</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Palmer passed for 247 yards and two touchdowns for the
Giants, and rookie tight end Jeremy Shockey had a touchdown catch
along with a bruising 48-yard gain where he flattened several Texans.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Randy Johnson showed there were no lingering effects from last week's
grueling start.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson struck out his first six batters and pitched a two-hitter
Monday as the Arizona Diamondbacks completed a four-game sweep with a
2-0 victory over the New York Mets.</LD>
<LD>   "He was a man on a mission today," Arizona Manager Bob Brenly
said. "He threw 149 pitches last time out and it was hot, humid
conditions today. We weren't sure what we would get out of him today.
The guys in the bullpen were on alert, but Randy handled things by
himself."</LD>
<TE>   Coming off the longest outing in the majors this year Wednesday in
Montreal and pitching in 89-degree heat didn't slow the Big Unit.</TE>
<TE>   "It might have affected me in the past, but it obviously didn't
affect me today," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (16-4) came within two of Jim Deshaies' record for
strikeouts to start a game and didn't allow a hit through five
innings.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's game was a mental and physical grind," Johnson said. "It
was a 2-0 ballgame, I threw a lot of pitches the start before, and
the weather was tough. I was just really focused to get through the
ninth inning."</TE>
<TE>   Roger Cedeno's chopper to third base broke up the no-hit bid with
no outs in the sixth inning. Matt Williams fielded the ball but had
no chance to get the speedy Cedeno, who slid into the base.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York's only other hit was a clean single by Mo Vaughn to lead
off the seventh. Johnson struck out 11 and threw 114 pitches in his
first shutout since opening day against San Diego and the 32nd of his
career.</TE>
<TE>   "The game dictates what I need to do," he said. "If we score a lot
of runs, there's no need for me to be out there. But in a 2-0 game
when I hadn't thrown a lot of pitches, why not go out if I still feel
good?"</TE>
<TE>   Williams homered and Craig Counsell hit an RBI double off Shawn
Estes (4-9) as Arizona won for the 12th time in 14 games</TE>

<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>The pink Barbie-sponsored Formula Ford driven by Ashley Taws was
stolen while the 18-year-old driver and the rest of her AIM Autosport
team slept in a motel.</LD>
<LD>   Taws and teammate Louis-Phillipe Dumoulin raced Sunday in Trois
Rivieres, Canada. The entire team stayed near the track Sunday night
and planned to head home to Toronto on Monday morning.</LD>
<LD>   They woke up to find the team's truck and trailer gone, along with
the race cars, a scooter, tools and equipment.</LD>
<TE>   The thieves also tried to take a second truck and trailer carrying
Taws' show car and promotional items, but were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   The race cars, a pair of Aero 2s, were built by the team engineers
brothers Ian and Keith Willis, in the early 90s and have been driven
by some of Canada's top aspiring racing talents.</TE>
<TE>   Last month in Toronto, Taws became the first female driver to win
a pole in a professional Canadian racing event, doing it in a Formula
Ford race during the Toronto Molson-Indy weekend.</TE>

<HD>Ice Dancer Denies Charges</HD>
<DH>Figure skating: Anissina says she knew reputed mobster, but
he had no impact on results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Figure skater Marina Anissina acknowledged she is acquainted with
Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov, the reputed Russian mobster charged with
trying to fix the ice dance and pair competitions at the Salt Lake
City Olympics, but said Monday she and partner Gwendal Peizerat won
the ice dance gold medal without outside help.</LD>
<LD>   "This situation has perturbed me. I am certain it is something
that is a complete fabrication," she said at a news conference in
Arles, France, where the couple was to perform in an ice show. "It's
a ridiculous affair. I've only seen things like this in American
movies."</LD>
<LD>   Anissina was accompanied by Peizerat--who wore a black T-shirt
imprinted with the words "Not Guilty" in red and white lettering--as
well as by Didier Gailhaguet, president of the French ice sports
federation.</LD>
<TE>   Also present were Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze, who won the pairs event but had to share their victory
with Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier after the International
Skating Union determined French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne had been
pressured to vote for the Russians.</TE>
<TE>   Anissina said she met Tokhtakhounov at a 1999 party and they later
"spoke on the telephone from time to time." However, she denied
having participated in phone conversations cited in court papers
filed last week in New York.</TE>
<TE>   A woman identified merely as "the female ice dancer" but described
in terms that could only fit Anissina--and identified as Anissina
last week by International Olympic Committee President Jacques
Rogge--is said to have promised to help Tokhtakhounov get a French
visa.</TE>
<TE>   The criminal complaint also says Tokhtakhounov spoke to "the
female ice dancer" on March 7, after the Games, and she said the FBI
was investigating Gailhaguet because "information came in that
[Tokhtakhounov was] involved with the results" at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   The voice of a woman called "the female ice dancer's mother" is
also said to be on the tapes. "I never telephoned him [after the
Games]," Anissina said. "I'm sure that that is not my voice. I don't
know who my mother called, but I am sure that she didn't do that,
either."</TE>
<TE>   Peizerat said he believes she's innocent. "She had the misfortune
to know someone who was mixed up in this business," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Sikharulidze: "Very soon we'll learn that it was all a big
mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Gailhaguet said he had met Tokhtakhounov in 2000 to discuss the
Russian's plan to finance a professional hockey team in Paris.
However, he said he was told by French officials not to grant
Tokhtakhounov's request for help in getting a Franch visa.</TE>
<TE>   Gailhaguet said he did not speak to Tokhtakhounov after that and
believes the ice dance standings should not change, even though Rogge
said last week the results could be recalculated depending on the
outcome of various investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "They won their medal on the ice," Gailhaguet said of Anissina and
Peizerat. "The Russian judge [Alla Shekhovtseva] voted against the
French skaters, so where's the alliance?"</TE>
<TE>   Tokhtakhounov, described in the complaint as "a major figure in
international Eurasian Organized Crime," has socialized with tennis
and hockey players from Russia and other former Soviet republics. He
is in an Italian jail awaiting proceedings to extradite him to the
U.S. His attorney, Luca Saldarelli, said last week Tokhtakhounov is
innocent.</TE>

<HD>Toluca Has Fast Start in Mexico</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paraguay national team striker Jose Cardozo demonstrated why Toluca
is one of the early favorites to win the Mexican league championship
when he scored three second-half goals to beat Necaxa, 3-0, on the
first weekend of play.</LD>
<LD>   Cardozo, 31, has led the league in scoring twice and is Toluca's
career leader with 147 goals.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico national team defender Claudio "El Emperador" Suarez, the
world's most-capped player with more than 160 international
appearances, returned from a four-month injury layoff to help UNL
defeat Chiapas, 3-1.</LD>
<TE>   Suarez, 33, was injured while training with Mexico in Denver in
April and sat out the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Chiapas was one of two teams to relocate during the off-season.
Veracruz moved to Tuxtla Gutierrez and became the Jaguares de Chiapas
(Jaguars of Chiapas), and La Piedad flew the coop and set up in
Queretaro, where it is now known as the Gallos Blancos (White
Roosters).</TE>
<TE>   The Roosters opened with a 1-1 tie against San Luis Potosi, one of
two teams promoted to the 20-team first division.</TE>
<TE>   Puebla, which during the off-season acquired Colombia national
team midfielder Mauricio Serna from Boca Juniors in Argentina, Chile
national team striker Sebastian Gonzalez from Colo Colo in Chile and
former Galaxy and Mexico national team goalkeeper Jorge Campos,
managed only a 1-1 tie with the Chivas (Goats) of Guadalajara in its
opener.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Passarella, a 1978 World Cup winner and former Argentina
national team coach, made his Mexican league coaching debut as
Monterrey defeated Atlante, 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz Azul, boosted by the return of Mexico World Cup striker
Francisco Palencia from Espanyol in Spain, lost to UAG, 2-1. The
Tiburones Rojos (Red Sharks) of Veracruz, making their debut in the
first division, lost to Morelia, 4-3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Australia 2014 Farce</TE>
<TE>   One day after announcing that it wants to stage the World Cup in
2014, Australia was embarrassed Monday when Prime Minister John
Howard told FIFA President Joseph "Sepp" Blatter that the
announcement at Sydney had been nothing more than "a political stunt"
by state politicians and refused to support the bid.</TE>
<TE>   "It has all the hallmarks to me of a Sunday political stunt,
rather than a serious attempt to help soccer," Howard said.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer Australia, the national federation, is troubled by debt and
internal bickering, and the bungled World Cup bid has added to the
impression of chaos.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And the Nominees Are ...</TE>
<TE>   European champion Real Madrid of Spain could all but sweep the
honors when UEFA, European soccer's governing body, announces its
award winners for the 2001-2002 season at Monaco on Aug. 29.</TE>
<TE>   The list of nominees, with the players' national and club teams:</TE>
<TE>   Player of the Year: Zinedine Zidane (France and Real Madrid); Raul
(Spain and Real Madrid) and Ruud van Nistelrooy (Netherlands and
Manchester United).</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeeper of the Year: Gianluigi Buffon (Italy and Juventus),
Jerzy Dudek (Czech Republic and Liverpool) and Oliver Kahn (Germany
and Bayern Munich).</TE>
<TE>   Defender of the Year: Cafu (Brazil and AS Roma), Sami Hyypia
(Finland and Liverpool) and Roberto Carlos (Brazil and Real Madrid).</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder of the Year: Michael Ballack (Germany and Bayer
Leverkusen), Roy Keane (Ireland and Manchester United) and Patrick
Viera (France and Arsenal).</TE>

<LD>We didn't only lose a voice.</LD>
<LD>   We lost a guy who rode shotgun with us on harried winter
afternoons.</LD>
<LD>   We lost a neighbor who sat in our living rooms on tortured spring
evenings.</LD>
<TE>   We lost a friend, darn it, an old friend, a dear friend, a
crumudgeonly, eccentric, funny, couldn't-wait-to-see-him-again
friend.</TE>
<TE>   A trusted friend.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Vin Scully, do Los Angeles sports fans have any of those
left?</TE>
<TE>   Chick Hearn is gone, and it's hard to even write the words.</TE>
<TE>   He was 85, he barely survived last season, the last time I saw him
he was slowly moving through a New Jersey gym, his face pale, his
hands clutching to a walker.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it's still as difficult to fathom as the idea of someone
broadcasting 3,338 consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Chick Hearn is gone?</TE>
<TE>   The Jell-O has stopped jiggling? The butter is melting? The eggs
are broke?</TE>
<TE>   His death Monday feels like a fire that razed that wonderfully
creaky antique house on the corner. We didn't only lose a voice, we
lost a little piece of our city that can never be rebuilt.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are our city's most beloved sports team, yet there was
only one who was completely beloved by everyone.</TE>
<TE>   We know everything about the Lakers, yet there was only one of
them who acted as if he knew anything about us.</TE>
<TE>   Chick--and I will not refer to him as Hearn, nobody ever called
him Hearn--was the amazingly flexible and resilient bridge between
the common fan and the movie stars who played basketball for them.</TE>
<TE>   On Hollywood's team, he was our connection.</TE>
<TE>   We growl when the Lakers don't play hard? So did Chick.</TE>
<TE>   We moaned at Shaquille O'Neal's early foul-shooting troubles? So
did Chick.</TE>
<TE>   We cringed at Kobe Bryant's crazy shots? So did Chick.</TE>
<TE>   When the Lakers won a close game, it was Chick who wiped his face
first, then handed us the towel.</TE>
<TE>   When the Lakers lost a bad game, it was Chick who threw down the
program just in</TE>
<TE>   time for us to kick it across the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps my favorite Chick moment occurred when he was honored
during halftime of one of their home games.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had struggled in the first half. Chick was brought to
midcourt for the ceremony. He was handed a microphone. Maybe you can
guess what happened next.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't say he was thankful to the Lakers for honoring him.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was angry with the Lakers for dogging it.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd roared, as it always roared for Chick, the only Laker
who consistently garnered a standing ovation before every game.</TE>
<TE>   Appropriately, he was introduced as he sat in his unusual seat,
which wasn't along press row but halfway up the lower level, smack in
the middle of the stands above midcourt.</TE>
<TE>   Appropriately, the cameras would always catch him surrounded by
gawking and gesturing fans.</TE>
<TE>   When I first came to town, I wondered why Chick never asked for a
better seat. But as the years passed, I realized, for him, that was
the best seat. He could see the entire game, and he could do so among
friends.</TE>
<TE>   In 42 years, the Lakers became huge, their salaries became
incomprehensible, the gym moved downtown, a bunch of guys running
ball in Inglewood became a group of international heroes that
sometimes felt too large to embrace.</TE>
<TE>   But Chick never changed.</TE>
<TE>   A guy making $20 million a year could still get faked into a
popcorn machine.</TE>
<TE>   If a platinum rap artist lost the ball, the mustard was still off
the hot dog, even if that hot dog could now afford to buy the entire
slaughterhouse.</TE>
<TE>   The language of the league changed, but Chick kept talking the
same way.</TE>
<TE>   The work ethic of the league slackened, but Chick refused to buy
into that either, setting a standard that will be best illustrated in
the Lakers attempt to replace him.</TE>
<TE>   I have been told they may have to hire two people. One for radio,
one for television.</TE>
<TE>   And, yeah, like one of them will start next season and not miss a
game for the next ... 36 ... years. No matter how much that record is
celebrated, it can never be fully appreciated, because it can never
be fully comprehended.</TE>
<TE>   Did you know that Chick invented the term "air ball?" Or that he
was the first to use, "dribble drive?"</TE>
<TE>   Like any good friend, Chick eventually changed the way we spoke.
He changed the way we saw.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly half a century, he sat with us and laughed with us and
cheered with us until, instead of simply broadcasting the Laker
experience, he defined it.</TE>
<TE>   It will be impossible to think of anything but him this fall when
the Lakers win their first game in a quest for a fourth consecutive
NBA title.</TE>
<TE>   Ten o'clock at night, and half of L.A. will be running to the
refrigerator.</TE>

<HD>Tigers Go Quietly Into Night</HD>
<DH>Angels: Eckstein, Wooten spark 6-3 victory over Detroit
during 'Silent Night' at Comerica Park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The Detroit Tigers tried lulling the Angels to sleep. Nice effort,
but no luck. The last-place Tigers took another loss for their
trouble.</LD>
<LD>   This bordered on parody: With the teams playing only to make up a
May rainout, and thus a tiny crowd guaranteed to watch the crummy
home team, the Tigers promoted Monday's game as "Silent Night"--no
music blaring, the video screen left blank, just an organist and one
guy on the microphone to announce batters and pitching changes.</LD>
<LD>   "It was kind of like we played somewhere in a minor league
stadium, without the crazy bat races," Angel pitcher John Lackey
said.</LD>
<TE>   On a lethargic night in a near-empty ballpark, the Angels defeated
the Tigers, 6-3, and defeated fatigue too. The Angels played 12
innings Sunday in Anaheim, landed in Detroit after 3 a.m., checked
into their hotel, slept for a few hours, checked out and headed to
Comerica Park, bags packed for a postgame flight to Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to drink as much coffee as possible," designated hitter
Brad Fullmer said.</TE>
<TE>   With no artificial noise and a shortage of man-made noise, the
Angels quietly went about their business.</TE>
<TE>   The quietest of the Angels, leadoff hitter David Eckstein, reached
base five times, on a career-high four hits, and an error. Shawn
Wooten also had a career-high four hits, after replacing injured
first baseman Scott Spiezio in the fourth inning. Fullmer and Troy
Glaus hit consecutive home runs in the fifth inning to put the Angels
ahead to stay.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey sparkled, giving up a three-run home run and nothing else
in 6 2/3 innings for the victory. He struck out eight, the most in
his eight major league starts. He also started on the night this game
was originally scheduled, for triple-A Salt Lake at Memphis, where
they surely have had crazy bat races.</TE>
<TE>   Brendan Donnelly, Scott Schoeneweis and Troy Percival got the
final seven out, with Percival earning his 26th save. The Angels took
a half-game lead on the Boston Red Sox in the American League
wild-card race and closed within 2 1/2 games of the Seattle Mariners
in the AL West.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer, who did not hit a home run in July, has homered in each
of three games he has started this month. Glaus, who hit two home
runs in July, has hit one in each of the last two games.</TE>
<TE>   A dreary day nearly turned devastating for the Angels in the
fourth inning, when Spiezio fouled a ball off his right kneecap. As
he fell to the ground, he grabbed the knee.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was split in two," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was scared, particularly when trainer Ned Bergert asked
him to straighten his right leg and he could not. Spiezio left--the
first time in his career an injury forced him from a game, he
said--but the feeling in the leg soon returned, and X-rays were
negative. He is expected to sit out no more than a day or two.</TE>
<TE>   Thus relieved, the Angels could return to pondering the Tigers'
"Silent Night," a self-fulfilling prophecy if ever there was one.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely had kind of a spring training night game
atmosphere," Tim Salmon said.</TE>
<TE>   In accordance with league policy, the Tigers announced tickets
sold--18,546, for the original date and for Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers did not announce actual attendance, but it was
generously estimated at one-third the amount of tickets
sold--something close to the 6,798 that watched the triple-A game
between Salt Lake and Iowa on Sunday at Des Moines.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it is difficult to argue that the good people of
Detroit should spend their hard-earned dollars on the Tigers,
particularly on $14 bleacher seats. The Tigers have not posted a
winning record since 1993, and they are on pace to lose 102 games
this season.</TE>
<TE>   So, even with the music playing, the coming nights might well be
silent.</TE>
<TE>   "Would it have been different on any other night here? I don't
know, the way they're playing right now," Salmon said. "It seems like
the town is not very happy with them."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chick Hearn was a giant because of the combination of his singular
style, colorful personality and incredible longevity. Among all the
memorable figures in Laker history, for local fans none was as
synonymous with the team as Chick.</LD>
<LD>   And beyond Los Angeles, he influenced the vocabulary of the game
with original phrases so perfectly descriptive they couldn't be
improved upon.</LD>
<LD>   Just about everybody used them at least now and then.</LD>
<TE>   Chick's almost boyish enthusiasm and unwavering determination to
keep on doing what he loved endeared him to his audience more than
talent or craftsmanship alone ever could. No matter how much you
cared about the Lakers, you couldn't possibly have cared more than
Chick did.</TE>
<TE>   In my hometown of St. Louis this summer, we lost Jack Buck. In
Detroit, Ernie Harwell, still spry at 84, leaves the Tiger booth at
the end of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Voices like theirs (and Chick's) mean more to their audiences than
just the game on any particular day. They were the last ongoing links
to the game you grew up with.</TE>
<TE>   Their calls were bulletins and flashbacks at the same time--part
of the soundtrack of your life.</TE>
<TE>   A few, including Vin Scully, of course, are still going strong.
But we will never see their like again. Not just because their talent
is rare but because the circumstances in which that talent flourished
can never be recaptured.</TE>
<TE>   The best of today's broadcasters may be admired and appreciated,
but too much about sports and broadcasting has changed to allow for
the enduring connection and fondness so many felt for Chick Hearn and
a very few others.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

many duties for NBC have been play-by-play on the NBA Finals and
baseball's World Series.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Knocked Down Again by Setup Men</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>The Dodger bullpen is built around All-Star closer Eric Gagne, who
needs only a little help.</LD>
<LD>   Gagne isn't getting enough these days, and other relievers
faltered again Monday in a 7-5 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies
before 20,259 at Veterans Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Setup man Paul Shuey (0-1) continued to struggle with his new
club, failing to preserve a one-run lead in the eighth inning,
prompting Manager Jim Tracy to turn to Giovanni Carrara in a 5-5,
two-out, bases-loaded situation. Carrara hit Todd Pratt with a
first-pitch curveball to force in the go-ahead run, and hit Jimmy
Rollins, the next batter, with a 2-and-1 slider to bring in an
insurance run before Tomas Perez lined out to short.</LD>
<TE>   Tracy was saving Gagne for the ninth. Paul Quantrill was not
available, having pitched in five consecutive games, and Tracy did
not want to use left-handed specialist Jesse Orosco because of his
increased workload in the second half, including warming up during
games.</TE>
<TE>   "There are directions you would have liked to have gone in, but
you've got Paul Quantrill sitting down there, having pitched five
days in a row, and eight of the last nine," Tracy said. "You've got
Jesse Orosco having been on a bullpen mound, pretty much every day,
since the second half of the season started.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to get a third out in the eighth inning before we would
warm up [Gagne] and bring him in the game. Gio had to get an out
there for us, that's all there is to it, and unfortunately he hit
[two batters]."</TE>
<TE>   Carrara left the clubhouse before reporters were permitted to
enter, leaving the Dodgers to explain what pitching coach Jim Colborn
described as the middle reliever's "mini-meltdown."</TE>
<TE>   "Pratt is a good fastball hitter, so I told [Carrara] let's go
first-pitch breaking ball," catcher Paul Lo Duca said. "He'll throw
that pitch for strikes 99 times out of 100. It was just one of those
times he lost it.</TE>
<TE>   "The second pitch was a little slider. Jimmy Rollins was right on
the plate, and it just got away from him. That's all."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers loaded the bases with two out in the ninth against
Philadelphia closer Jose Mesa, putting leadoff batter Dave Roberts in
a situation he enjoys. Roberts began the game three for three with a
home run and eight runs batted in with the bases full this season,
but he lined out to center to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   Mesa got his 32nd save and second in the series, enabling Mike
Timlin (3-3) to get the victory despite giving up the go-ahead run in
the seventh on Mark Grudzielanek's fifth homer.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers (62-50) finished 6-7 on their first losing trip of the
season, splitting the four-game series with Philadelphia (53-58).
They trail the first-place Arizona Diamondbacks by a season-high
seven games in the National League West, after beginning the trip 1
1/2 games back, and lead the idle San Francisco Giants by a half game
in the NL wild-card standings.</TE>
<TE>   Adrian Beltre made another timely contribution with a two-run
homer--No. 15--in a three-run seventh, and starter Hideo Nomo
rebounded from a rough beginning to pitch seven innings with 10
strikeouts. But that was not enough for the Dodgers, who are 8-16
since the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   Shuey hasn't provided the boost the Dodgers hoped he would when
they acquired him July 28 from the Cleveland Indians, giving up
well-regarded pitching prospect Ricardo Rodriguez in the four-player
deal.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander, pitching for the sixth time in seven days, gave
up two hits and was charged with three runs in two-thirds of an
inning. Shuey has a 9.64 earned-run average with the Dodgers in 4 2/3
innings. He has given up eight hits and walked seven, retiring only
14 of 29 batters.</TE>
<TE>   Shuey acknowledged he is not accustomed to pitching as much as he
has with the Dodgers, though he welcomes the work.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that we had the lead," Shuey said, "and we
didn't have it anymore after I left."</TE>

<DH>Remembrance: Hearn stirred the imagination with his
words-eye view on radio and made Laker fans of millions across the
Southland with his picture-perfect descriptions.</DH>

<LD>Your radio was probably different. Mine was black with a large, white
rotary tuner with little notches to help make the speed-spin dial
from KFWB to KFI.</LD>
<LD>   Your memories are probably different too, which was the beauty of
it, no definitive television images to clutter the strokes Laker
announcer Chick Hearn painted in your imagination.</LD>
<LD>   "No image," announcer Bob Costas says, "imposed on you by
television or by tape."</LD>
<TE>   Hearn would broadcast thousands of games on television, yet that's
not where his legend took root. He belonged to an ever-shrinking
pantheon of announcers whose fabulously formed words are best
recalled flowing blindly out of a box.</TE>
<TE>   Guglielmo Marconi invented radio, but these guys reinvented it.</TE>
<TE>   It's no accident Vin Scully's most elegant dialogue with us, maybe
baseball's most memorable piece of masterpiece theater, was his
description of Sandy Koufax's perfect game in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   Two-and-two to Harvey Kuenn--one strike away. Sandy into his
windup, here's the pitch. Swung on and missed, a perfect game!</TE>
<TE>   Only 29,139 actually attended the game at Dodger Stadium. There
was no Fox Television broadcast, no wrap-up on Fox Regional Report
and certainly no raucous round-table discussion on "Best Damn Sports
Show Period."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, somehow, thanks to one man at a mike, the game is forever
etched.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn had that hold on Laker fans long before television games
were included in your basic cable package.</TE>
<TE>   Most of us heard, not saw, Jerry West's last-second, 63-footer to
tie Game 3 of the 1970 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks, yet
that moment is as imprinted in my mind as Magic Johnson's baby
sky-hook against the Boston Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn calling West's shot made your mind press the "record"
button: picture a school kid pacing the kitchen with time running out
on his Lakers, staring into his black-and-white radio, praying for a
miracle and actually getting it!</TE>
<TE>   It was Hearn who released the ball from West's hands, Hearn who
orchestrated the crescendo when West's miracle shot went in.</TE>
<TE>   Bring back that radio daze.</TE>
<TE>   "The mystique was greater," Costas said Monday of legends like
Hearn and Scully. "The sense of romance, the innocence was greater. A
guy was the voice of the team. There weren't multiple outlets
carrying games with a battalion of announcers. There weren't all
these places to get highlight packages. Their voice, their
description, their point of view, that was baseball or basketball to
you."</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to cry "sap" when you hear elders gush about olden days,
those pre-television Depression-era times when families gathered
around a giant living room radio and "watched" the Jack Benny Show.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, it's fair to say that a lot of baby-boomers shared this kind
of intimate relationship with their sports announcers.</TE>
<TE>   It was different then, maybe even better.</TE>
<TE>   That era is almost gone, likely never to return. Ray Scott,
Lindsey Nelson and Jack Buck are deceased. Ernie Harwell is on a
farewell tour after 42 years with the Detroit Tigers, and Chick Hearn
is gone.</TE>
<TE>   Who, other than Scully, is left?</TE>
<TE>   These are, undeniably, different times. Today's announcers are
largely handpicked, spoon-fed and bred for television. They speak to
a different demographic.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, the Tigers had the gall to fire Harwell, the team's
legendary announcer, only to face a public outcry that led to
Harwell's return.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is most owners today think pictures really are worth a
thousand words. Broadcasters don't grow up with their teams anymore,
and we don't grow up with them.</TE>
<TE>   The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette recently reported 70 of today's
baseball announcers have fewer than nine years experience with their
current team.</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, some of today's announcers are banished to radio. Even
Vin Scully is a television-only guy, broadcasting via radio only on
simulcasts.</TE>
<TE>   "Vin Scully not on the radio?" Curt Smith, author of the book
"Voices of the Game," bemoans, "is like not letting Picasso paint."</TE>
<TE>   A recent Washington Times writer mused the New York Yankees
"seemingly have more announcers than players."</TE>
<TE>   Chick Hearn was the best basketball announcer ever because he
learned and worked his trade on a blank audio canvas. It was by
osmosis and necessity that he shaped his delivery to the fast-paced
NBA game. He and Scully brilliantly massaged their skills to fit
their specific sports.</TE>
<TE>   "Radio is intimate," Curt Smith said Monday. "It's portable. It's
daily. It's ubiquitous. We become attached to the voices of the game
on radio in a way that's literally impossible on television.</TE>
<TE>   "Lindsey Nelson said of radio that the voice is your eyes and
ears. You are the star, the scriptwriter, the producer, director and
salesman. On television, Lindsey says, he provides captions."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn remained a star on television because he never changed his
rapid-fire act. He simply turned his broadcasts into radio-television
simulcasts. Even though you could now see the Lakers on television,
Hearn called games as though all his listeners were shut-ins at a
rest home for the blind.</TE>
<TE>   Chick faced a different challenge from Scully.</TE>
<TE>   "Hearn was never faced with filling dead air," Smith said. "The
problem with basketball on radio is not having too much time but
having too little. You have to have an economy of language, you have
to have a dramatic voice, you have to very succinctly and plainly
draw for your audience what is occurring as it occurs. And Chick
Hearn was superb. He was the whole package, the complete goods."</TE>
<TE>   The devil, as they say, was in the details. Hearn was a master of
description, from the way he noted Elgin Baylor's nervous twitch at
the free-throw line to explaining how a guard "hippity-hopped" the
dribble up court. You always knew the score with Hearn, how large the
court was, "94-feet of hardwood," how large the crowd was, "capacity
throng of 17,505," and what kind of pass a player threw, "alley-oop."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn set his music to a backdrop that was at times desperate and
apocalyptic: "Not even the Lord and all his disciples could have
stopped the Lakers tonight."</TE>
<TE>   When a colleague asked Harwell why he announced the score of a
ball game so often, Harwell reportedly told him, "Look, we all hope
they're listening to the whole ballgame, but most of them are not."</TE>
<TE>   Costas says this attention to detail was born of another era.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard tapes of Red Barber in the 1930s and '40s," Costas
said, "where he tells you there's a line single to left-center and he
tells you how many times it bounced before the center fielder picked
it up. You needed that then."</TE>
<TE>   Costas says the great ones--Hearn, Scully, Harwell, Buck,
Scott--announced the game as if television didn't exist.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, even the very good announcers, will very rarely describe a
guy's stance or the peculiarities of a guy's windup," Costas said,
"because they've been subconsciously influenced by television even
though they're on the radio."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Buck, the announcing son of late Jack Buck, the legendary St.
Louis Cardinal broadcaster, admits he was born of a different ilk.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the guys coming up don't have the same objectives as the
older radio guys did, which is to paint the full picture," Buck
recently told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. "I don't think the younger
guys--and I include myself in this--do as good a job as those guys
did."</TE>
<TE>   Few would argue with Smith, whose book chronicled sports' top
announcers, when he says Hearn was a cut above in his field.</TE>
<TE>   "You know in the movie 'The Natural,' where Roy Hobbs says he
wanted to be referred to as the best there ever was?" Smith asks.
"Well, Chick Hearn was the best there ever was in my view at doing
basketball. Just as Ray Scott was the Roy Hobbs of pro football, and
Vin Scully the Roy Hobbs of baseball, that was Chick Hearn in
basketball."</TE>

<LD>Column by the late Jim Murray on Chick Hearn, originally published
Sept. 25, 1986.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "Top of the key to Baylor.... Baylor yo-yo-ing in the
frontcourt.... Give and go to Goodrich!.... Bounce pass to West....
Dribble-drive to the basket.... He turns.... He's fouled!.... Oh, no,
Mendy didn't call it! No harm, no foul.... High post by Wilt....
Turnaround fake by Jerry.... He puts Cazzie in the popcorn machine. .
. . He shoots!.... He scores!.... Fall back, baby!"</LD>
<TE>   A lot of my friends have their own pieces of sidewalk on Hollywood
Boulevard. Spencer Tracy. Claudette Colbert. Mary Pickford. Gable.
Doug Fairbanks. Bogie. Errol Flynn.</TE>
<TE>   'Course, I didn't know all of them personally. But Tracy has been
a friend of mine ever since "Captains Courageous." And Gable and
Colbert crept into my heart in "It Happened One Night."</TE>
<TE>   But now, guess who's joining Tracy and Gable and Katharine Hepburn
and John Wayne? Guess who's joining legends like Tom Mix and Iron
Eyes Cody and Charlie Chaplin and Mack Sennett?</TE>
<TE>   Francis Dayle Hearn is who. Chick Hearn. The world's greatest
basketball announcer. The machine gun that talks like a man. The guy
who did more than any other to take pro basketball out of the drafty
gyms in Peoria and Altoona and put it on prime time.</TE>
<TE>   Every basketball player signing a million-dollar contract should
take off his hat stepping across that slice of sidewalk on Hollywood
Boulevard they dedicated to Chick Hearn Wednesday. It's a shrine of
their biz if not show biz.</TE>
<TE>   Basketball was a tough sell when Francis Hearn came along. I
remember in the late winter of '61 going down to the Sports Arena
where they were staging a playoff game between the then-St. Louis
Hawks and the newly arrived--from Minneapolis--Los Angeles Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   It was a Sunday afternoon, and they used to click off the
attendance on a screen high above the arena floor. It read 2,800 that
day as the teams took the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Now, mind you, this was a playoff game. The division final. But
not only were there few customers, there were hardly any other
journalists covering games in those days.</TE>
<TE>   But the Lakers had made a very important acquisition just before
that series. In later years, they were to acquire Wilt Chamberlain,
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, even Magic Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   None, however, was ever so important as the free agent they picked
up that winter of '61. Chick Hearn and pro basketball made Romeo and
Juliet, ham and eggs, gin and tonic look like unmatched opposites. It
was like a river joining a sea. Caruso finding a song, Van Gogh a
brush.</TE>
<TE>   Any sport needs a lively nomenclature, word pictures that go into
the language. Simple terms like bases loaded, circus catch, circuit
clout, screwball and squeeze play all served to dramatize the grand
old game of baseball that even became the national pastime, thanks to
the fertile mind of some chronicler of press row.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Husing took football out of its dock-fight image and invented
secondaries, even tertiaries for its defensive postures, and talked
of whole hosts of tacklers and coffin corner kicks until the game
today is so full of colorful allusions it is almost liturgical in
scope.</TE>
<TE>   Chick Hearn did the same things for pro basketball, which had
almost no language of its own when he came along. No more would
division playoff games be played before 2,800 spectators after Chick
hit the scene. They became the hardest tickets in town once Chick was
out in front of the tent.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't make basketball occult, he made it fun. He knew it as a
player himself and he was far from a homer. Chick became almost a
public scold when a player malingered. Or an ownership.</TE>
<TE>   That's why he has his gold star and his own section of sidewalk on
Hollywood Boulevard. He didn't play the pro game but he sold it. As
Elgin Baylor said at the dedication ceremony: "You made us stars.
When you have a product, you need somebody to promote it. That was
Chick."</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood Walk of Fame is for entertainers, communicators,
pioneers, builders. That's why Chick's there. He qualifies on all
counts. That's why he finds himself across the street from Spencer
Tracy and Claudette Colbert on Hollywood and Highland and not far
from Adolphe Menjou and the forecourt famous of the Chinese theater.</TE>
<TE>   He belongs to the ages now. Wallace Beery, Brian Donlevy, Cary
Grant, Jimmy Stewart--and Chick Hearn. Pretty heady stuff for the
ex-backcourt man from East Aurora and Peoria.</TE>
<TE>   Pretty soon they'll be selling star maps to his home and he'll
have a busload of people waving when he puts out the garbage in the
morning. Paparazzi will be waiting in the bushes with poised shutters
when he emerges to go to work. They'll want Robert De Niro to do "The
Chick Hearn Story."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Boulevard is marbled with the names of men and women who
helped build a multimillion-dollar industry. Chick Hearn is there
because he's one of them.</TE>

<HD>It's Reality Check for Madden</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"This is the start of what it's all about," John Madden exclaimed
during the fourth quarter of his first game in the "Monday Night
Football" broadcasters booth, and yes, football fans, it really is
the dawning of a new era.</LD>
<LD>   Taken on their own, Madden's words are no less confusing than
anything Dennis Miller uttered during his two skittish years
alongside Al Michaels--they're only equipped with fewer syllables.
Yet legions of television viewers, many of them still recuperating
from their lengthy "Dump Dennis" campaign, simply settled back</LD>
<LD>   in their sofas, smiled and nodded along with knowing</LD>
<TE>   approval.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to sports announcers and the people who listen to
them, it's all about comfort. Comfort between the announcer and the
viewer. Comfort between the announcer and his partner. Comfort
between the announcer and his subject matter.</TE>
<TE>   Those are three levels Miller never approached during his MNF
stint. Michaels, however, is keenly aware of the importance, which
may explain why he checked in early on Madden during Monday's
exhibition game between the New York Giants and the Houston Texans.</TE>
<TE>   "How are you doing, you getting comfortable?" Michaels asked
Madden midway through the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Madden: "I'm as comfortable as heck."</TE>
<TE>   Michaels: "Me too."</TE>
<TE>   Good to get that out there, on the record, considering all the
recent media attention given the Michaels-Madden partnership and
speculation that the MNF booth wouldn't be big enough for two
oversized egos. But was anyone convinced? If the exchange sounded a
little forced, a bit contrived, well, that's not a total departure
from the Miller era,</TE>
<TE>   either.</TE>
<TE>   Marveling about Giant offensive coordinator Sean Payton's detailed
game preparation, Madden noted that Payton "has everything scripted.
I was talking to him last night. He not only has the first 15 plays
for the first [string] scripted, but he has the second group scripted
and the third group."</TE>
<TE>   Miller was big on scripting too. For Payton, it meant a trip to
the Super Bowl two seasons ago. For Miller, all it meant was a lot
more free time to write jokes for his late-night HBO show.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, there were no references to Sylvia Plath or how
good a guy "Jimmy" Fassell seemed to be during the pregame production
meeting. In many ways, Madden is the anti-Miller: a longtime member
of the NFL establishment, not a nervous wannabe, and a very
intelligent man who has shrewdly accrued a massive popularity--and a
massive fortune--by pretending to be dumber than he really is.</TE>
<TE>   Alluding to his former Raider tight end and new Hall of Famer Dave
Casper, Madden said Casper graduated from Notre Dame "with some of
those Latin words after his name." Later, when discussing the Pro
Football Hall of Fame, Madden deadpanned, "What's the word for that?
Hallowed? Hallowed hall?' "</TE>
<TE>   Miller never connected with fans because he sounded like he was
showing off, trying to prove to the audience he was smarter than
everyone else. Madden is too smart for that. He knows what plays in
Middle America, and he knows exactly how to give the people what they
want. He's big into</TE>
<TE>   comfort.</TE>
<TE>   Michaels played willing straight man as he listened to Madden go
"boom!" while reviewing an impressive block made by a Texan lineman.</TE>
<TE>   Michaels: "Let it be duly noted: The first Monday night 'boom!' "</TE>
<TE>   Madden: "And it all started with a big ol' guard named DeMingo
Graham."</TE>
<TE>   Madden was in his comfort zone. Then came another boom, the one
that sent Houston safety Leomont Evans to the hospital with no
feeling temporarily below his neck. Suddenly, Madden was nowhere near
comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what every player and every coach ... you know, you go out
there and you compete and you want to play hard and do your best and
hit hard and all those things, but you don't want any injuries,"
Madden said. "You don't want to ever see</TE>
<TE>   this."</TE>
<TE>   Evans' status became an important, developing news story for the
remainder of the game, with sideline reporter Melissa Stark providing
periodic updates. But at halftime, when Michaels asked Madden to
imagine what Houston Coach Dom Capers might be thinking, Madden
jumped back into the safe realm of Xs and O's: "I would feel great,
because one thing I know--I have a quarterback!"</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Capers has a quarterback, rookie David Carr, who completed
nine of 17 passes for 96 yards in the first half. He also had a young
defensive back</TE>
<TE>   who, at the time, had no feeling in his arms or his</TE>
<TE>   legs.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, by game's end, Stark was able to report that Evans
had regained feeling in both arms and both legs and that an MRI and a
CAT scan showed everything was "normal." The early</TE>
<TE>   prognosis, Stark said, was a spinal cord</TE>
<TE>   contusion.</TE>
<TE>   Michaels declared that to be very encouraging news. Madden said
nothing, then moved to the next play: "Shotgun. Four wide receivers."</TE>
<TE>   This is the start of what it's all about. For Madden, that means
fun and football games and big ol' linemen named DeMingo. But real
life occasionally encroaches on Monday night too. The broadcast booth
has to be big enough to accommodate it when it happens, no matter how
many men with microphones are already inside.</TE>

<HD>Lantz's Stories Show Sunny Side of Chick</HD>
<DH>Remembrance: After 15 seasons as Hearn's partner, he
recalls moments that made Laker broadcast legend who he was.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Asked this week to recall some of his memories of Chick Hearn, Stu
Lantz said, "Gee, I wish I could call Chick. He's the one with the
great memory. He's the one with all the great stories."</LD>
<LD>   But Lantz, who spent 15 seasons as Hearn's broadcast partner and
travel companion, was able to remember a few.</LD>
<LD>   "You know how people will set an alarm in a hotel room, then check
out and never turn it off," he said. "I forget where we were, but
Chick had stayed up late one night working on his statistics, cutting
things out and mounting them on his boards. I think he must have left
his scissors on the nightstand.</LD>
<TE>   "The alarm went off at 4 a.m., and Chick couldn't figure out how
to turn it off. So he just grabbed the scissors and cut the cord."</TE>
<TE>   Lantz recalled going to dinner with Hearn once during a training
camp in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   "He volunteered to drive," Lantz said. "After we finished eating
we discovered Chick had not only left the keys locked in the car but
had also left the lights on. Even if we could have gotten to the
keys, we were still stuck."</TE>
<TE>   Many of Lantz's memories have to do with Hearn's penchant for
kidding.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always trying to get people to believe a story that wasn't
true," Lantz said. "He was always fishing. We called him the Big
Fisherman because he was always seeing who he could get to bite.</TE>
<TE>   "On the team bus, I always sat directly across the aisle from him,
so I could I hear when he was trying to reel someone in. He'd start
out saying something like, 'I can't believe so and so got traded.'</TE>
<TE>   "Then he'd wait for someone to hear him and run with it. Pretty
soon the whole bus was buzzing. He'd wait five or 10 minutes, then,
laughing, he'd let everyone know he was kidding."</TE>
<TE>   Lantz recalled a time in Denver when Hearn put a game in the
refrigerator too early.</TE>
<TE>   "Chick said, 'I'll walk home if the Lakers lose this game.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers lost.</TE>
<TE>   "The funny thing was Susan [Stratton, Channel 9's executive
producer] put a graphic on the screen that showed how many miles it
was between Denver and Los Angeles," Lantz said.</TE>
<TE>   Lantz has been asked over the years how he and Hearn really got
along. Lantz said if they had a disagreement on the air, it was soon
forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd tell Chick, 'You're entitled to your opinion, even if you're
opinion is wrong.' We'd have a good laugh, and that would be that."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn and Lantz, often referred to as Chick 'n Stu, became almost
like father and son. Lantz drove from his home in San Diego to the
hospital on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Lantz said he owes his career with the Lakers to Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   He and Hearn worked a summer league game together for Prime Ticket
in the mid 1980s and also did a couple of Nevada Las Vegas basketball
games.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me if there were ever an opening for someone to work with
him, he'd call," Lantz said.</TE>
<TE>   After Keith Erickson left for the Phoenix Suns in 1987, Hearn
called.</TE>
<TE>   "He was true to his word," Lantz said. "There are a lot of things
you can say about Chick and one is that he had a good heart. He had
the best heart in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought this day would come. I always thought he'd be
announcing long after I'm gone."</TE>

<LD>Soup cans and several Marilyn Monroe look-alikes came to the Museum
of Contemporary Art on Saturday to celebrate Andy Warhol's birthday.
(He would have been 75 today.)</LD>
<LD>   Upstairs, KCRW host Garth Trinidad deejayed while two
cakes--decorated, of course, with likenesses of Warhol--were served
to the Warhols and Monroes in attendance. As part of the celebration,
the museum offered free admission to the exhibit to those in costume.
But for some, it was a challenge to get through the doors, as
illustrated by the walking soup cans, three college students who made
their costumes from Hula-Hoops and fabric.</LD>
<LD>   The Campbell's regalia made taking a seat in the downstairs
theater difficult. "The little seats ...." said Laura Salgado, the
19-year-old creator of the cans. "Obviously, they don't accommodate
soup cans," added her friend, Won Choi, 19. Esther Goldstein, the
third can, giggled.</LD>
<TE>   In the next gallery, Jackie Onassis and Warhol muse Edie Sedgwick,
a.k.a. Kate Urcioli, 19, and Kristin Unger, 18, looked at the Warhol
paintings. The two had driven from Las Vegas specifically for the
birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fans," said Unger. "And this was our [way of] not having to
spend $17."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Battle Fatigue</TE>
<TE>   It's nearly noon, but actor Cole Hauser's voice sounds groggy and
distant. He returned to his Los Feliz home just three days ago after
five months in Hawaii shooting an as-yet-untitled war movie with
Bruce Willis. It's his second war film in about a year.</TE>
<TE>   Hauser begins the phone interview with monosyllabic responses, as
if he hasn't cast off his character, the tough-as-nails Navy SEAL and
demolitions expert he inhabited for months. The experience left
Hauser somewhat shellshocked. "It was intense," he says of the shoot.
"I'm sitting here in my home just recovering. I've slept for a couple
days. I'm just kind of doing nothing, which is just kind of staring
at the walls."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Hauser played a "racist shark of a man" in the
World War II picture "Hart's War," also starring Willis. After
returning from the Prague shoot, he had about a day to recover before
he began filming "White Oleander," a story about a young girl's
troubled life in foster homes. Hauser portrays a foster parent
opposite Robin Wright. On the first day of the shoot, he apparently
got his characters confused. "I'm supposed to be looking at [actress
Alison Lohman] like I'm passionate .... I'm sitting there and I think
everything's fine and the director [Peter Kosminsky] says 'Cole.
Cole. You're looking at her like you're going to kill her.' "</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after finishing work on that film, Hauser flew to
Hawaii for months of rigorous training in weapons and pyrotechnics.
During the battle scenes, he performed all his own stunts, diving
through explosions and suffering minor burns all over his body.
"There were so many explosions, it really felt like you were in war,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Military maneuvers have always fascinated Hauser. His father and
grandfather were both Marines. And at 18, he asked about enlisting as
a Marine at a recruiting office. But Hauser's aversion to authority
kept him out of the armed services. "I don't follow orders well," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   In the new film, directed by Antoine Fuqua, Willis is Hauser's
lieutenant, and their crew has been dispatched to make a rescue in
Nigeria. Hauser keeps the film's details to himself. "It's an amazing
story of soldiers ... about America helping out Africans," he says.
"It's really good for the times ....I think that this kind of film
would be one that other people would raise their fists and say,
'That's what I love about America!' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scream Attack</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Love Hewitt was accosted outside a San Diego radio
station by a 46-year-old woman who screamed at the actress as she
left KFMB-AM on Monday morning, according to police.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt's bodyguard stepped between the woman and Hewitt just in
time to intercept a few minor blows, a San Diego Police Department
spokesman said. When officers arrived at the scene, however, Hewitt
and her bodyguard were gone. Later, when police encouraged the
bodyguard to press misdemeanor assault charges against the woman, he
refused, so the woman wasn't arrested. Hewitt did not return calls
for comment.</TE>

<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Technical glitches and grass-roots resistance atypical of Japan
accompanied Monday's debut of the country's first national
identification system, a registry designed to battle bureaucracy by
centralizing personal data.</LD>
<LD>   The system will assign an 11-digit identification number much like
the U.S. Social Security number--to each of Japan's 126 million
citizens and gather basic information on each in a networked central
database: name, address, sex and birth date.</LD>
<LD>   Under the system, each local government will be responsible for
entering the data and each citizen will be issued a photo ID card.</LD>
<TE>   The idea is to allow people to more easily process social benefits
and obtain passports and other official documents, cutting down on
red tape among municipal, prefectural and national governments.</TE>

<HD>Alabaster Gleams in Cathedral</HD>
<DH>The L.A. diocese, in a break from stained glass, is taking
a chance with climate and chemistry in using the delicate,
translucent stone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Its sand-colored concrete walls loom over Temple Street like an urban
butte, and tons of marble, bronze and limestone gleam within. Yet, in
the end, there's no earthly element in the new Cathedral of Our Lady
of the Angels that matters more than the alabaster.</LD>
<LD>   Its job, basically, is to suggest the presence of God. When the
cathedral's first rank-and-file visitors step in on Sept. 3, they'll
find alabaster cut into translucent panes left, right and center,
27,600 square feet of it, designed by architect Jose Rafael Moneo to
filter sunbeams into sepia tones, and to stand in for the stained
glass that Catholic worshipers have admired for centuries.</LD>
<LD>   Nobody in North America, authorities agree, has ever used so
much of this strange stone this way. And as the cathedral's builders
readily concede, there are some sensible reasons for that. The tale
of how this cathedral got its windows is, at bottom, a chemistry
equation. But it also hints at the high ambitions of the cathedral's
creator and patron, and it reveals the hard work that begins after an
architect's biggest decisions and the surprises that crop up, even on
a closely monitored $163-million construction site.</LD>
<TE>   If you have driven through downtown Los Angeles on the 101
Freeway, you have seen the cathedral's sandy walls and the tall cross
formed by the concrete, alabaster and glass behind the altar. From
the floor of the cathedral, the alabaster makes a bigger
impression--11,800 panes, each sliced to a thickness of 15
millimeters (about 5/8 inch) and naturally veined like a vast, living
membrane.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a curious material," said C. Terry Dooley, senior vice
president at Morley Construction, who has supervised work on the
cathedral for six years. "It's found in big globules, lying around at
random in fields and on hillsides. They lug them back into the shop,
clean all the dirt off, and then try to slice them. It comes in weird
shapes, and you have to slice a whole lot of pieces to get clean
integral pieces of this size. They break a lot of them. It's a fairly
inefficient material."</TE>
<TE>   Chemically, alabaster is hydrated calcium sulfate, typically found
in boulders made of sedimentary rock formed as salty water
evaporated. Etruscan mourners put the ashes of their dead into
alabaster amphorae.</TE>
<TE>   Sculptors today like it because it's easy to carve, with veins
that might run red, green, gold or gray.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like marble that's not done yet. It needs temperature
and pressure for a few million more years," said Randy Fulton,
project management consultant for the archdiocese's project
management firm, Stegeman &amp; Kastner.</TE>
<TE>   Alabaster is in the Vatican (pieced together to form a dove, high
up behind the altar of St. Peter's Basilica). It's in the new Martha
Stewart catalog (7-inch-high vases for $28) and the Getty (vases
again, not for sale). It's in the collected works of Emily Dickinson
(who once wrote a poem titled "Safe in Their Alabaster Chambers"),
and in quarries and churches scattered through Italy and Spain. It's
also in the fourth verse of "America the Beautiful" ("Thine alabaster
cities gleam ...").</TE>
<TE>   Yet until this cathedral, North America had never seen this much
alabaster outside a quarry. Why? Because it's difficult to quarry,
it's soft and delicate, it crumbles at high temperatures, and if you
put it directly under a hard rain for long enough, it might dissolve.</TE>
<TE>   Vulnerability to</TE>
<TE>   Heat and Moisture</TE>
<TE>   "If you bear down pretty good, you can scratch it with your
fingernail," said Stan Jones, owner of Colorado Alabaster Supply in
Fort Collins. "It's really good for small, detailed pieces."</TE>
<TE>   Jones has quarried and sold alabaster since 1969, selling mostly
to sculptors and craft workers. If you put too hot a bulb in a lamp
with an alabaster shade, Jones said, "you bake the water out of it,
and pretty soon the whole thing loses its translucence and looks like
chalk."</TE>
<TE>   The stone's vulnerability to heat, said Douglas Hammond, a
professor of earth sciences at USC, is the result of a chemical
structure that includes two water molecules. Specific results can
vary, depending on humidity and other factors, but generally, when
pure alabaster's surface temperature reaches 136 degrees--a level
often surpassed when heat accumulates on roofs and exterior walls on
hot days in L.A.--the water molecules separate from the stone and it
goes opaque and chalky. Basically, it becomes gypsum, a material
found in common plaster. As heat rises further, it disintegrates.
Alabaster's chemical structure makes it vulnerable to moisture, too.
In fact, Hammond says, with enough direct exposure to sustained rain,
"it would eventually start to dissolve."</TE>
<TE>   From the start, these traits have been well known and much
discussed in the offices of the architects, engineers and contractors
working on the cathedral. But they amount to only part of the
picture.</TE>
<TE>   For all his worldliness as an architect--he won the prestigious
Pritzker Prize for architecture in 1996, sits on the faculty at the
Harvard Graduate School of Design and prides himself on largely
reinventing his style for each job--Moneo's affection for alabaster
can be traced to his birthplace in northern Spain, where many
churches dating back centuries include alabaster windows and other
details.</TE>
<TE>   In his 1992 Miro Foundation building on the Spanish island of
Mallorca, Moneo placed moisture-sealed translucent alabaster panes
between concrete louvers as a device to bring in light but screen out
the view of surrounding buildings.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the architect reasoned, alabaster would evoke
church history and harmonize with the cathedral's other earthy
materials. The fragile stone's filtered light, Moneo said, would
serve as "a metaphor for mystical experience and for the presence of
God within the church."</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the bottom line. The archdiocese has said it
spent $20 per square foot on the stone in the cathedral--about
$660,000, excluding labor. Even with the careful handling that
alabaster requires, said project management consultant Fulton, its
cost is a small fraction, perhaps one-tenth, of what traditional (and
labor-intensive) stained-glass windows could have cost.</TE>
<TE>   But what about heat and weather? The specialists at Morley
Construction and executive architects Leo A Daly wondered. "There was
a lot of concern over the alabaster," recalled David Campbell, a
designer in Moneo's Los Angeles office.</TE>
<TE>   Morley Construction's Dooley remembered taking detours to obscure
churches on his European vacations in the late 1990s, just to see how
the old alabaster had held up. It's impossible to know all the
factors involved, Dooley said, but some of those sunbaked panes are
"pretty dark now, and they look gloomy. The last thing we want is
gloomy."</TE>
<TE>   Experiments to Make</TE>
<TE>   the Material Hardier</TE>
<TE>   One of the team's first proposed solutions was to protect the
alabaster by laminating it with glass. But that quickly proved a
nonstarter; the laminating process itself generated such heat that
the alabaster went solid white.</TE>
<TE>   Next, the designers and builders made appointments in 1997
and 1998 at the Smith-Emery Testing Laboratory in Los Angeles, and set up
a science project. First, they put samples of raw alabaster, sealed
alabaster and glass-sandwiched alabaster into an oven. Then, said
Dooley, researchers ran the oven "through cycles as though the
alabaster was being heated by the afternoon sun in L.A. They went
back down cool, then back up, then back down."</TE>
<TE>   In too many cases, it was Stan Jones' lampshades all over again:
dried-out and clouded samples. With unsealed alabaster, recalled Nick
Roberts, project manager at Daly, the trouble began just above 110
degrees--unacceptable in a cathedral that's supposed to last 300
years. Fulton, who was also on hand for the testing, used words like
"brutal" and "abysmal" to describe the glass-sandwich results.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson of the testing, all sides agreed, was that the
alabaster needed more protection. The project's mechanical,
electrical and plumbing engineers, Ove Arup and Partners, used
computerized airflow modeling to design a sort of double-glazed
window system: First, to take the brunt of the sun, they set up an
exterior membrane of laminated glass embedded with ceramic material
to screen out roughly half of the incoming light. (Look up at the
stairstepped exterior windows from Temple Street and you can see the
herringbone pattern.)</TE>
<TE>   Then, beneath that exterior but outside the steel-and-aluminum
frame that would hold the alabaster, they created a ventilation gap 1
to 7 feet wide to let moving air carry away heat that would otherwise
accumulate. In theory, the alabaster challenge was solved.</TE>
<TE>   In practice, however, there was still an unprecedented amount of
alabaster to be found, shipped and placed. Acting on a recommendation
from Moneo, who lives in Madrid, the archdiocese investigated and
made a deal to buy its alabaster from Arastone, a quarry in Zaragoza,
in northern Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Like butchers slicing salami, workers at circular saws shaved the
pieces down to a thickness of 15 millimeters, then cut them into six
standard sizes. The smallest panes were cut about 13 inches high and
3 inches wide; the largest, 34 inches by 24 inches. The veining was
limited to four hues (roughly, grayish, yellowish, whitish and
reddish), and soon after they were cut, the panes were coated on all
sides with sealer.</TE>
<TE>   Then came inspection by a different European stone company,
hired by the archdiocese to evaluate samples of the alabaster before it
left Spain--conducting stress tests and looking for fractures,
veining problems and inexact dimensions.</TE>
<TE>   Planning conservatively, the archdiocese ordered more than 33,000
square feet of stone, allowing for 10% of that to break in transit or
on site, planning to set aside another 10% for future years.</TE>
<TE>   It arrived, on time, in six shipping containers, snugly packed in
crates, panes wrapped in foam. Benson Industries Inc. of Portland,
Ore., the subcontractor chosen to handle the alabaster and exterior
glass, began by putting up the framework to hold the panes. Then it
was up to half a dozen workers to set the alabaster within its frame,
matching a pane-by-pane pattern set by Moneo to create a calculated
"random" effect.</TE>
<TE>   They started in June 2001. Using electric hoists purchased
specifically for the task, they carried no more than 200 pounds of
alabaster up on each trip. Five months later, 11,800 panes of
alabaster had been placed aloft. In the "lantern" area above and
behind the altar, where heat accumulation is greatest because many
alabaster panes lie horizontally, designers used smaller panes and
added a thermostatically controlled cooling system. Installers also
added a 2,800-square-foot underpinning of safety glass above the
altar area, so that, if a pane of alabaster should weaken, it
wouldn't fall.</TE>
<TE>   "We handled it very much like we would handle a piece of glass,"
recalled Michael P. Flucke, senior vice president for Benson
Industries. "But the stone was not nearly as fragile as everyone
expected."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, when the numbers were tallied, in all the packing,
shipping, hoisting and placing, fewer than 1% of the panes had been
broken or rejected.</TE>
<TE>   There was so much stone left over, Flucke said, "it became
a little problem. Nobody expected to have so much." The archdiocese
wound up with about 5,000 square feet of extra alabaster on its
hands.</TE>
<TE>   The panes in the cathedral, their installation guaranteed by
Benson Industries for 10 years, have been aloft in their aluminum
frames for about a year now. They endured the heat wave of late June
and early July, when temperatures exceeded 90 on the ground, with no
hints of any heat damage and no breakage, contractors said.</TE>
<TE>   "The hottest part we have is that lantern skylight. On our hottest
days, it's about 110," Fulton said. "If it got over 140 degrees in
there, we'd put in more ventilation."</TE>
<TE>   'A Journey to</TE>
<TE>   and Through Light'</TE>
<TE>   Stepping into the cathedral, a visitor doesn't get the full
alabaster effect right away. The path in leads through sculptor
Robert Graham's 25-ton bronze main doors, then up a gently sloping
ambulatory that leads to the rear of the church. At the end of the
walkway comes a right turn, and it's then that a visitor sees the
full volume of the building's interior. Cardinal Roger M. Mahony has
called the architectural experience of the cathedral "a journey to
and through light."</TE>
<TE>   The alabaster signals completion of that journey. Filtering down
to the wooden pews and Spanish limestone floor of the church, the
light changes by the hour, sometimes yellowish, sometimes darker. By
night, the effect turns inside out, and the building's interior
lights shine through to make the church a sort of beacon. Regulars in
the building say they prefer the late afternoon, when the hue goes
more orange, and the evening.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, the effect is nothing like the traditional varied and
saturated colors of stained glass, and church officials say they
expect to hear from traditionalists about that. (Those
traditionalists do have the option of stepping down a level. The old
stained-glass windows from the nearby deconsecrated former cathedral,
St. Vibiana's, have been relocated to the new cathedral's mausoleum,
where they're illuminated from behind with fluorescent lights.)</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the archdiocese has found a place for its leftover
alabaster. After a moving job that took four days of loading, about
2,000 stone panes sit crated in a storage facility in East Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "So," Flucke said, "if they want to build an addition ..."</TE>

<HD>Taiwan Tries to Smooth China's Ruffled Feathers</HD>
<DH>Asia: A Chinese official calls President Chen Shui-bian's
remarks "open defiance."</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Taiwan sought Monday to defuse a diplomatic row over its president's
call for an independence vote, saying Chen Shui-bian spoke only of a
possible response to Chinese aggression.</LD>
<LD>   "Our foreign policy has not been changed," said Manfred Peng, a
spokesman for the Taiwanese government in Washington. That policy
still includes no declaration of independence and no promotion of a
referendum, Peng said.</LD>
<LD>   Though there was no indication that the story was linked to Chen's
comments, the official China Daily said Monday that military
exercises would be held this month along coastal provinces that face
Taiwan.</LD>
<TE>   Land, sea and air forces will practice simulated attacks and beach
landings, the paper said. China regularly holds such exercises in
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council,
might visit Washington this week to explain Chen's remark that
Taiwanese residents should consider a referendum on the island's
future, Peng said. Tsai plans to be in New York accompanying
Taiwanese Prime Minister Yu Shyi-kun on a visit.</TE>
<TE>   China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province, drew a parallel
in Chen's words to a call in 1999 by Taiwan's then-President Lee
Teng-hui to redefine bilateral ties as "special state-to-state"
relations.</TE>
<TE>   Li Weiyi, spokesman for Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office, said
Chen's stance would damage "Taiwan's economy, hurt the personal
interests of Taiwan compatriots and lead Taiwan to disaster." He said
China would "absolutely not allow anyone, in any way, to split Taiwan
from China."</TE>
<TE>   Xie Feng, a Chinese Embassy spokesman in Washington, called Chen's
remarks "an open defiance to all Chinese people" and dismissed the
Taiwanese effort to downplay the comments, saying it reflected the
worldwide criticism the words have generated.</TE>
<TE>   Taiwan's Peng said Chen's "intent is to try to reiterate the
existing facts."</TE>
<TE>   Taiwan "is already a sovereign and independent state," though it
also adheres to a promise not to declare independence or promote a
referendum, Peng said.</TE>

<HD>Hunger Afflicts Palestinians, a New Report Says</HD>
<DH>Territories: Study funded by U.S. aid agency concludes that
malnutrition among children is especially grave in the Gaza Strip.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Citing Israeli-imposed closures and curfews as the main cause, a
major study issued Monday concludes that one in five young children
in the Palestinian territories is suffering from malnutrition, a
figure on par with impoverished Third World nations such as Chad and
Bangladesh.</LD>
<LD>   The report, funded by the U.S. Agency for International
Development, says the problem is particularly alarming in the Gaza
Strip, where more than 13% of the population under the age of 5
suffers from acute malnutrition. That figure, the authors say, would
be "considered an emergency by most humanitarians and public health
officials."</LD>
<LD>   The report was released as Israel imposed a total ban on travel in
much of the West Bank and sealed off a portion of the Gaza Strip. The
closures came in the wake of yet another suicide bombing, on a bus
Sunday, and of attacks by gunmen in Jerusalem and the West Bank.</LD>
<TE>   The study, which was overseen by the humanitarian group CARE
International with technical assistance from Johns Hopkins
University, found that 22.5% of children in the territories under the
age of 5 suffer from acute or chronic malnutrition. It also found
that both wholesalers and retailers in the Palestinian territories
have experienced shortages of such high-protein foods as fish,
chicken and dairy products. And it found that a large percentage of
Palestinians have been forced to borrow money or sell belongings to
put food on the table.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually, people run out of places to borrow money and they run
out of assets to sell," said Dr. Gregg Greenough of the Johns Hopkins
Schools of Medicine and Public Health, who helped conduct the study,
which was done in June.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Response</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials did not address the impact of closures on health
issues Monday but said health conditions among Palestinians have been
deteriorating since 1995, when Israel turned over health-care
responsibilities in the territories to the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Yaacov Adler, who advises the Israeli government on health
issues in the territories, said that since the Palestinian leadership
took over, incomes have fallen drastically, affecting people's
ability to buy nourishing food.</TE>
<TE>   "People who don't have enough money eat the basic foods, not the
food which is desirable for a child's growth," he said. "I don't
believe it will solve the problem if we are blamed. We must examine a
way to improve this situation in a way that people will be able to
earn more and eat healthier food."</TE>
<TE>   Those who participated in the survey, however, did point to the
continuing conflict and the months of road closures, checkpoints,
curfews and fighting as the prime cause of declining incomes,
deteriorating health and less food.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank, wholesalers cited road closures as their major
obstacle, while shop owners said Israeli incursions and curfews were
the cause of most of their difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   In Gaza, both wholesalers and retailers said border closures were
by far the greatest source of disruption. In another aspect of the
survey, representatives of 724 of the 1,280 households sampled said
they had eaten less in the previous two weeks because they didn't
have money.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Garber, the USAID head of mission in the West Bank and Gaza,
said his hope is for cooperation from Israelis and Palestinians to
alleviate the problem.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Daunting Challenge</TE>
<TE>   Earl Wall, director for CARE International in the West Bank and
Gaza, said distributing relief goods in the territories under the
current conditions is a daunting task. He said his organization has
been trying to move medical supplies into the areas in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been terribly difficult for a whole wide range of
reasons," he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Dismisses Iraqi Overture to Congress</HD>
<DH>Inspections: In its second offer on arms monitoring, the
Persian Gulf nation invites lawmakers to bring experts for searches.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Iraq on Monday made its second offer in less than a week regarding
inspections of its weapons systems, invitations under wary
consideration by the United Nations but dismissed immediately by the
White House as a stalling tactic.</LD>
<LD>   As Washington debated whether Iraq's suspected development of
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons warrants military strikes,
an Iraqi parliamentarian invited members of Congress to bring experts
of their choice to search alleged weapons sites.</LD>
<LD>   The White House rejected the offer with hardly a comment, and
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld scorned the idea of a handful of
Congress members scouring Iraq for hidden mobile and underground
weapons caches.</LD>
<TE>   "They'd have to be there for the next 50 years trying to find
something," he told reporters. "It's a joke."</TE>
<TE>   But U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday that despite
initial doubts, he would not reject Iraqi overtures just yet.</TE>
<TE>   Last Thursday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri invited the
United Nations' chief weapons inspector, Hans Blix, for discussions
in Baghdad to review the outcome of previous disarmament talks.</TE>
<TE>   Annan rebuffed the offer Friday, concerned that Iraq was trying to
undo earlier agreements on U.N. inspections. The Security Council has
mandated that weapons inspectors must be allowed to make an
unfettered and comprehensive assessment in Iraq before formal talks
can resume. U.N. inspectors have not monitored Iraq's weapons
development since they left the country before a U.S.-led bombing
campaign in December 1998, and they have not been allowed to return.</TE>
<TE>   But after a private lunch with the Security Council on Monday,
Annan said that if Iraq would allow U.N. weapons inspectors back into
the country per Security Council guidelines, he would consider
allowing Blix to visit.</TE>
<TE>   "We would want to discuss with them the return of the inspectors,"
Annan said. "If Iraq is open to that idea, there are practical means
to send the inspectors back."</TE>
<TE>   Annan has held three rounds of talks with Iraqi officials this
year on the possible return of weapons inspectors and the lifting of
sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. At the last
meeting, in Vienna a month ago, Annan refused to set a date for
another encounter because he felt that Iraq was drawing out
negotiations as a stalling tactic.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. officials said privately that they are concerned that Iraq is
trying to further divide the Security Council and put old issues back
on the table.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, though, Annan said the Iraqi overture was worth a
closer--but brief--examination.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether this is a real break and a real change in attitude is
something that we will have to test," he said. He replied to Iraq
formally Monday evening and told reporters that he hoped for a quick
response.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we should drag it out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the Security Council's five veto-wielding members, Russia is
the strongest supporter of Iraq's proposal of last week, welcoming it
as an "important step toward resolving the crisis through political
and diplomatic means." France and China cautiously welcomed it, but
Britain and the U.S. clearly opposed new talks on Iraq's terms.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, John D. Negroponte,
said Washington was "deeply skeptical" of Iraq's invitation and
viewed it as an attempt to rewrite the rules of U.N. inspections.</TE>

<HD>Israel Faces Court Test of Deportation Plans</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Judge considers whether to expel brothers of
suspected organizers of attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIT EL, West Bank</DL>
<LD>The two Palestinian men sat in the dock Monday, legs in chains, and
listened to the translation of an Israeli military judge debating
their fate.</LD>
<LD>   Kifah Ajouri and Abed Nassar Asida are a test case: If all goes
according to Israel's plan, the two men will be expelled from their
hometowns in the West Bank to the Gaza Strip as part of a new policy
to punish the relatives of those the Jewish state holds responsible
for a growing wave of terrorist bombings and armed attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Ajouri and Asida are each accused of helping a brother who Israel
says organized terrorist attacks. But the judge, a Karl Malden
look-alike presiding over a special appeals panel at this Israeli
military base, ruled that most of the evidence against the two men
had to be kept under wraps for reasons of "security."</LD>
<TE>   Deporting attackers' relatives is controversial--perhaps
illegal--but Israelis are desperate. The government of Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon finds itself increasingly on the defensive as the
numerous military operations it has undertaken have failed to stop
the violence. Sharon's popularity has begun to flag, according to the
latest polls, and criticism of his policies is mounting from both the
left and right wings of a frightened public.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli tanks and troops have already seized control of most of
the West Bank and arrested thousands of Palestinians. On Monday, they
tightened their grip by banning all Palestinian road traffic in the
northern West Bank and reimposing curfews that had been eased.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in the situation of total closure in the area of Samaria,"
Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said, using the
biblical name for the northern West Bank. "Nobody enters and nobody
leaves."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Israeli forces entered the southern tip of the Gaza
Strip, cutting it off from the rest of the territory, and late Monday
launched airstrikes on a Gazan metalworks factory that the army said
was producing weapons. These measures followed a bloody day in which
15 people died in five Palestinian attacks in less than 24
hours--proving to many here that the government's tactics are not
working.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after the travel crackdown was imposed, a car exploded near
the town of Umm al Fahm, killing a passenger who media reports said
was a hitchhiking bomber. Police said they believed that the
explosives detonated prematurely and that the wounded driver was
unaware of the bomber's intent.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli newspapers noted Monday in blistering commentaries that
the death toll among Israelis in the last 22 months of violence just
surpassed 600. While that is about a third of the Palestinian toll,
the pace of Israeli deaths has been increasing, with a large majority
occurring in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "What country would allow its citizens to be slaughtered every
place they walk or sit, year after year, month after month, day after
day?" Amnon Dankner, editor of the Maariv daily, demanded in a
front-page editorial. He pointedly blamed Sharon, who he said has
given his public "empty promises" of restored security.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with such uproar, Sharon held urgent consultations Monday
evening with Ben-Eliezer and the army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Moshe
Yaalon. Officials announced afterward that the government will press
ahead with tougher restrictions on Palestinians, the demolition of
suicide bombers' homes and the exiling of their families from the
West Bank to the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts said Sharon will not deviate too dramatically from
his current policies.</TE>
<TE>   He does not have the troops to sustain a full military occupation
of the entire West Bank and Gaza, and Israel's economy is already
depleted by the war effort, the collapse of tourism and losses in the
high-tech sector.</TE>
<TE>   He also wants to avoid an enormous escalation, analysts said,
preferring to wait for a change in the leadership of the Palestinian
Authority and possible U.S. military action against Iraq's Saddam
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's attorney general has ruled that to deport an attacker's
relative, the government must show that the person who is being
banished had some tie to the attack or to supporting the attacker.
But such ties can be vague, and defense attorneys and human rights
activists argue that imposing sanctions on relatives is a form of
collective punishment illegal under international law.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, a military appeals panel heard the cases of Ajouri and
Asida, whom the army arrested last month and is trying to banish.
Granting a petition from defense attorneys, an Israeli court ordered
part of the hearing opened to reporters, offering a rare glimpse of
Israeli military justice in action.</TE>
<TE>   Ajouri's brother Ali is accused by Israel of dispatching two
suicide bombers to a working-class neighborhood in Tel Aviv last
month; three people were killed in addition to the bombers. Asida's
brother, Israel says, is an operative with the militant group Hamas
who coordinated two deadly shooting attacks outside the Jewish
settlement of Emmanuel.</TE>
<TE>   Military prosecutors said the two detainees were accomplices to
their brothers. Most evidence to support the state's case, however,
was kept secret because, they said, releasing it would jeopardize
national security.</TE>
<TE>   The defense attorneys, who work for an Israeli-Palestinian human
rights organization, the Center for the Defense of Individual Rights,
said the charges involve Ajouri and Asida having given food or a
place to sleep to their brothers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no justice here," Ajouri said during a break in the
proceedings at an army base just north of Ramallah. "They arrested me
because of my brother. This is unjust and illegal what is happening
here."</TE>
<TE>   Ajouri, a house painter with two children, said he had not seen
his brother in a year.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Ajouri's nor Asida's brother has been detained, and Israel
considers the men fugitives.</TE>
<TE>   The judge, retired Col. Danny Friedman, ruled that Ajouri and
Asida's attorneys could cross-examine only one of two secret service
agents who testified against the men, and only behind closed doors.
Reporters were asked to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "We are used to being in the dark," Dalia Kerstein, director of
the rights center, said later. "If there are charges against these
people, then they should have a trial, a charge sheet and punish them
if they are found guilty. But transfer from one part of occupied
territory to another part of occupied territory is illegal. We cannot
agree to collective punishment."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Justice Minister Meir Sheetrit said the threat of
expulsion will act as a deterrent to potential suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   "People ought to know that if they perpetrate a terrorist attack,
their families and supporters will be truly hurt," he said. "We'll
expel to Gaza people who were partners either by supporting the
terrorist or by knowing and failing to prevent the attack."</TE>
<TE>   Public Security Minister Uzi Landau said an action as simple as
attending the funeral of a relative who was a suicide bomber should
be enough to expel someone.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1967, when Israel captured and occupied the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, and 1992, the Israeli government deported to other
nations 1,522 Palestinians who were accused of terrorism or
affiliation with certain political groups.</TE>
<TE>   Israel never deported a female relative but is taking steps now to
do so. Ali Ajouri's sister Intisar has been ordered expelled to Gaza,
and the wife of a Hamas commander may face a similar fate.</TE>
<TE>   Security experts debated whether deportations would discourage
Palestinian attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Yatom, former head of the Mossad spy agency and security
advisor to Sharon's predecessor, Ehud Barak, said Monday that
deportations and house demolitions can be effective to a limited
degree.</TE>
<TE>   "This can make a contribution, but it surely cannot lead to a
significant improvement," Yatom told Israeli radio. "In the end we
are talking about a cocktail, if we can call it that, of means and
efforts which, if combined, can make the action of the security
forces more efficient, but it will be impossible to eliminate the
terror only with force."</TE>
<TE>   Yatom and others said Israel's "war against terrorism" must be
accompanied by political steps. Sharon has refused to enter into
political talks with the Palestinians, saying Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat is an unfit partner and preferring to wait
for a more cooperative leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Ben-Eliezer, Israel's defense minister, met with the
Palestinian interior minister, Abdel Razak Yehiyeh, late Monday to
discuss plans for a cease-fire that would allow Israeli troops to
leave Palestinian areas, Palestinian officials and Israel's Army
Radio said.</TE>

<HD>Milosevic's Defiance Is Taking Its Toll on Him--and His
Trial</HD>
<DH>Justice: Ex-strongman's insistence on playing the martyr
has meant illness and numerous delays.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE</DL>
<LD>He's in a maximum-security prison, at grave risk of a heart attack
and on trial facing 66 counts of war crimes. Yet in his mind--the
only domain where Slobodan Milosevic remains omnipotent--the
erstwhile Balkan strongman is still calling the shots.</LD>
<LD>   By refusing expert defense counsel in his trial before the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Milosevic
has cast himself in the role of wily attorney defending the falsely
accused. It is the performance of a lifetime, even if played more for
his shrinking audience of supporters back home than for the
three-judge panel that will decide his future.</LD>
<LD>   In the nearly six months since his trial began, the 60-year-old
former Yugoslav president has shown himself to be diligent in
preparing cross-examinations and alert to inconsistencies in witness
testimony, say court observers and prosecution sources.</LD>
<TE>   But the workload he carries in the biggest war crimes trial since
Nazi leaders were brought to justice in Nuremberg is taking its toll
on Milosevic's health and threatening to further slow proceedings
that will, under the best of circumstances, run two more years.</TE>
<TE>   And in that "martyred" state of a man working himself to death to
fight a bloodless bureaucracy, Milosevic is playing the abused victim
and calling the court's authority into question.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer by training but not in practice, Milosevic spends hours
each night preparing for the next day's parade of prosecution
witnesses, who have already numbered more than 100, with 177 left to
go. He has so far cross-examined every one of them, often drawing
rebukes from Judge Richard May for badgering, wasting time with
irrelevant questions or trying to put the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization instead of himself on trial for the 1999 war over Kosovo
province.</TE>
<TE>   "He has the ability to hold up his rights and his presumption of
innocence, and he has made absolutely clear that he will challenge
the prosecution at every step," said the court's spokesman, Jim
Landale. "But he is entitled to do that, just as he is entitled to
the right to defend himself."</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic has also drawn out the trial by refusing to accept any
written documentation into the record without live witness testimony,
said Florence Hartmann, spokeswoman for chief prosecutor Carla Del
Ponte.</TE>
<TE>   "In most cases, we meet with defense counsel and agree to accept
written statements about matters that are beyond dispute," Hartmann
said. "But Milosevic has refused to accept anything, which is his
right, but it means we have to present witness after witness to
establish even the simplest matters of fact."</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with his view that the tribunal has no authority to try
him, Milosevic refuses to meet with the prosecution for disclosure.
His wife, Mirjana Markovic, visits him in prison often but has never
attended the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Though court officials want the case kept on schedule, they are
confronted with the quandary of whether to impose counsel on
Milosevic against his will or let the trial continue to be
interrupted and the interests of swift justice defeated. As time
passes, they argue, witnesses move on with their lives and memories
fade, making it increasingly difficult to present an effective
prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   The deposed leader blamed for the chaos that devastated the
disintegrating Yugoslav federation in the 1990s has twice fallen ill
with flu, resulting in a two-week postponement of the trial each
time. He also took off two days in July because of high blood
pressure. Each of his health problems has left the prosecution
accommodating and consoling frightened witnesses brought in on
assurances that their time here would be safe, anonymous and
short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   A report by two U.N.-appointed cardiologists called in to examine
Milosevic after the latest no-show warned the tribunal that he was at
"severe cardiovascular risk" and should be under constant
observation, May told the court as it prepared for a four-week summer
recess that began June 29.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic's wife has accused the court of trying to exhaust him,
and Belgrade attorney Dragoslav Ognjanovic, one of two lawyers with
special access to Milosevic as "advisors," has condemned the
five-days-a-week, four-hours-a-day trial schedule as "infernal."</TE>
<TE>   The results of an extensive physical examination of Milosevic are
due to the court by the time testimony resumes at the end of August.
But the accused is unlikely to get much rest during the break unless
he retains help to prepare for the second phase of the prosecution.
That leg, which starts in September, will present evidence of crimes
allegedly committed during the 1991-95 wars in Croatia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina.</TE>
<TE>   Although Milosevic's defiance of advice to retain counsel might
seem to be self-inflicted damage, it enhances his view of himself as
one in a line of Serbian martyrs. He built his power base during his
13-year leadership by evoking the 1389 Battle of Kosovo Polje--a
defeat of Serbian forebears at the hands of Ottoman Turkey that is
the stuff of legends involving Serbian bravery and sacrifice for
halting the infidels' advance.</TE>
<TE>   Those still marching to Milosevic's drumbeat of Western
ingratitude and Serbian victimization are ever fewer as a new regime
has taken root in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital. But enough
Milosevic loyalists remain to keep the population bitterly divided
and the anti-Western propaganda flowing.</TE>
<TE>   "Milosevic 'Trial' Blows Up in Hague Prosecutor's Face," blares
the headline on a story circulated on the Internet from the vice
presidents of the International Committee to Defend Slobodan
Milosevic. The authors, Jared Israel and Nico Varkevisser, portray
the recent claims of former Serbian secret police chief Rade Markovic
that he was coerced to betray Milosevic as evidence that the entire
case is a Western setup.</TE>
<TE>   Such accusations may seem paranoid or self-serving to the
impartial observer, but they have resonance for the theater of
Serbian public opinion before which Milosevic is performing.</TE>
<TE>   "He's playing to a different jury and surely winning on the media
stage for the most part," said a prosecution source who asked not to
be identified. "But that doesn't mean he is scoring the legal points
he needs to win over the judges or discrediting the evidence we are
presenting."</TE>

<HD>Attack on Pakistani School Kills 6</HD>
<DH>South Asia: Gunmen target a facility for children of
Christian missionaries, but the dead are all local men. The
assailants escape.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Gunmen attacked a boarding school for the children of American and
other Christian missionaries in a Pakistani mountain resort town
Monday, killing six people in an assault authorities said was aimed
at foreigners.</LD>
<LD>   The victims were all Pakistani men--two Christians and four
Muslims, local police commander Asghar Ali Cheema said from Murree,
in the Himalayan foothills about 25 miles northeast of Islamabad,
Pakistan's capital. Two school guards and a retired teacher were
among the dead, and at least three other people were slightly
wounded.</LD>
<LD>   About 32 American children are among the school's nearly 150
students, who also include Britons and Filipinos, police said.</LD>
<TE>   "Their goal was to hit foreigners," said district commander
Moravet Shah, adding that police found a note at the scene expressing
"resentment against world powers."</TE>
<TE>   "What we know is that they were terrorists," he said. "Whether
they were religious terrorists, we have to determine."</TE>
<TE>   The Murree Christian School was founded in 1956 for children of
foreign missionaries working in Pakistan and neighboring countries.
Classes go from grades one through 12, according to the school's Web
site.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the gunmen were stopped before they got close to the
classrooms or living areas.</TE>
<TE>   A school statement said "all students and expatriate staff are
safe and being cared for," and added: "One missionary, Mrs.
Visitacion, suffered an injury to the hand."</TE>
<TE>   The British founded the settlement of Murree in 1851 as a vacation
spot, or "hill station," when the Indian subcontinent was under
colonial rule. From an altitude of 7,000 feet, it overlooks the
roughly one-third of the disputed territory of Kashmir that is
controlled by Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's incident was one of several recent major attacks on
Christian institutions or foreigners in Pakistan. President Pervez
Musharraf had been struggling to control extremists even before he
joined the U.S.-led war on terrorism after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   About 11:15 a.m. Monday, four assailants, dressed in track suits
and carrying knapsacks or other light bags on their backs, drove up
to the school's front gate on motorcycles and opened fire with
automatic weapons, police said.</TE>
<TE>   During a 20-minute gun battle, the militants killed two school
guards and made it through the gate onto the grounds when at least
one police officer shot at them. Police believe at least one gunman
was wounded, but they all escaped.</TE>
<TE>   A search with helicopters and dogs failed to track down any of the
attackers by Monday night, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The attack came as violence continued in the Indian state of Jammu
and Kashmir, where India plans to hold staggered elections for a
state assembly beginning in mid-September.</TE>
<TE>   At least eight people were killed and 12 seriously injured at dawn
today when suspected Islamic militants lobbed a grenade and opened
fire on a group of Hindu pilgrims in Kashmir, police said. Security
officers killed one of the attackers.</TE>
<TE>   Police in Jammu, the winter capital of Jammu and Kashmir state,
said the attack occurred on the route taken by hundreds of thousands
of pilgrims to the Amarnath shrine in the Himalayas.</TE>
<TE>   Indian and Pakistani troops have engaged in limited clashes for
several days along the cease-fire line that divides Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   The continued fighting and militant attacks are undermining U.S.
and other foreign efforts to persuade the two nuclear-armed countries
to start negotiations toward settling the 55-year-old dispute over
Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   India hopes it can negotiate limited reforms with a newly elected
government in Jammu and Kashmir state. But a loose alliance of
separatist groups insists that its supporters will not participate in
the vote, which they regard as India's attempt to legitimize its rule
in the territory. Arguing that Kashmiris have a right to
self-determination, they want a referendum on independence.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Monday, the U.S. Consulate in Karachi was closed
indefinitely for security reasons after local authorities decided to
reopen the street in front to traffic. A suicide bomber killed 12
Pakistanis in a June 14 attack at the consulate.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Karachi police quietly transferred the remains of slain
American journalist Daniel Pearl to the consulate's control.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl was kidnapped in Karachi on Jan. 23 while investigating
Islamic militant groups for the Wall Street Journal. Police found his
remains in May near Karachi.</TE>

<HD>Turkish Secularists See Red Over Islamists' Rise</HD>
<DH>Politics: The republic's founder rejected Muslim
traditions. Now, as religious parties gain strength, the military
guards his legacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>Ayse Calmuk knows that some Turks view her head scarf as a red flag
flaunting support for an Islamic political agenda. But she says
wearing it is simply a religious duty.</LD>
<LD>   "This is God's command," said the 31-year-old homemaker, who on a
hot summer evening was bundled up in a black silk scarf, black jacket
and loose cotton trousers. "My head scarf is not a political symbol.
It has nothing to do with politics."</LD>
<LD>   Feride Acar, a professor at Middle East Technical University here
in the Turkish capital, doesn't buy that argument. And as Turkey
heads toward elections in November that could bring a party with deep
Islamic roots to power, clashing views over head scarves reflect a
potentially dangerous split in society.</LD>
<TE>   "In this country, sociologically speaking, the head covering is a
symbol of violation of women's human rights. This is how many people
understand it," Acar said.</TE>
<TE>   "As a woman, if you are claiming that you are covering your head
because this is part of your religion and it's part of your belief
system, then that same belief system has other things that are
supposed to be accepted by women too," Acar said. "That includes
polygamy. That same belief system also includes unequal inheritance.
It includes the right of the husband to physically punish the wife.
All of these are gross violations of women's human rights."</TE>
<TE>   Calmuk ridicules that notion.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe any of these issues--polygamy or unequal
inheritance rights--are issues anymore in the modern world," she
said. "People like me don't believe in them. It's wrong to associate
them with Islam."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the government's fear of the head scarf is great enough
that students and public employees are banned from wearing it at
schools and on the job. The ban, itself often criticized as a
violation of women's rights, is just one small piece of a system
enforced by the Turkish army that supporters say is designed to
ensure that religious leaders can never take political power.</TE>
<TE>   Modern Turkey was founded in 1923 on the Ottoman Empire's ruins by
Kemal Ataturk. He had a secular, Europe-oriented vision that rejected
what he considered a backward Muslim world. He forbade the
traditional veil for women and fez for men, abolished polygamy and
let girls go to school.</TE>
<TE>   The military has guarded Turkey's secularism ever since, even
forcing out the country's first democratically elected Islamist-led
government in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts and politicians doubt that the army would allow the
Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party to take power if it won
elections set for Nov. 3. The party is led by the charismatic former
mayor of Istanbul, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Polls show the party with
20% to 30% popular support, at least double that for its closest
rivals.</TE>
<TE>   In Turkey's system, only parties that win at least 10% of the vote
are awarded parliamentary seats, so popularity at this level can
bring a strong position in parliament, conceivably even a majority if
most votes are split among a large number of parties.</TE>
<TE>   There are widespread fears that postelection conflict could erupt,
pitting the military against Erdogan and other religion-oriented
politicians. Such conflict would damage Turkey's democracy, its
troubled economy and its hopes of joining the European Union.
Although an open clash is far from inevitable, many say the risk
exists.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit declared recently that an Islamist
electoral victory could trigger a crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "There is speculation that Justice and Development will end up as
the first party," Ecevit said in an interview on state-run
television. "If that comes true, Turkey will be faced with questions
over its regime." That was taken as a reference to the possibility of
military intervention in some form.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not want Erdogan's rights to be taken away from him or the
party banned, but their true faces must be exposed," Ecevit added.</TE>
<TE>   Party leaders strenuously deny that they want to impose Islamic
rules on the government or society. Erdogan insists that he has never
chosen the label "Islamist" and that he simply tries to be a good
Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   Those who think the party wants to impose an Islamic state "don't
know us," said Abdullah Gul, its deputy leader.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that being a religious party, or establishing a
religious state, is not rational and not good, and doesn't help
anyone, not even religion," Gul said. "If you ask me individually, I
try to be a good Muslim, and I want my family and children to follow
that way. But I don't want to interfere in public life."</TE>
<TE>   Views vary widely as to whether such statements can be trusted.</TE>
<TE>   "I do acknowledge that there's a threat of radical Islam in this
country, people who would like to see Turkey run as an Islamic
state," said Husnu Ondul, president of the Human Rights Assn. of
Turkey. "But those people are not members of the Justice and
Development Party. There may be a few people like that [in the
party], but they're really marginal."</TE>
<TE>   Few people believe that religion-based parties could succeed in
imposing an Islamic political system even if they won elections and
tried to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan "can't form an Islamic state," said university student
Fatih Budak, 21. "That's impossible, because there's strong
opposition. There's us young people. There's the military. We won't
allow him to do anything of that sort."</TE>
<TE>   Efforts are already underway to undermine the Justice and
Development Party, said Kemal Can, a political analyst in Istanbul,
the country's largest city. "The coming three months will be a period
during which the military will do everything possible to ensure they
don't come to power," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Can noted that legal action against Erdogan might well keep him
off the ballot. He faces trial on charges of defrauding the state by
fixing contracts and illegally transferring money into his personal
account while he was Istanbul's mayor, from 1994 to 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan was convicted in 1998 of inciting religious hatred for
reciting a nationalist poem, even though the poem is taught in
Turkish schools. A court recently ruled that the conviction bars him
from being elected to parliament, but legal appeals continue.</TE>
<TE>   "If it becomes clear that Erdogan is not eligible to run for
parliament, that would be a huge blow to Justice and Development,"
Can said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Gul predicted that his party will win an outright majority
in parliament and form a government smoothly. "Democracy will work,"
he said. "I don't see any reason for [military] intervention."</TE>
<TE>   But Hasim Hasimi, a Kurdish member of parliament, predicted that
the courts will keep Erdogan from running and that if his party
nevertheless wins, the military won't allow it to form the next
government, either alone or in a coalition with other parties.</TE>
<TE>   "Turkey is still being governed by a constitution drawn up by the
military in 1982 following their last coup," Hasimi said. "Although
there've been a huge number of changes to that constitution, the
spirit of the military dictatorship is still enshrined in it."</TE>
<TE>   Turkey has been under direct military rule three times since 1960.
Before withdrawing for the third time, in 1983, the generals wrote a
constitution enhancing their power behind the scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Though few people predict that the army will stage another coup,
it has enormous influence over some political parties, the courts,
the media and business associations.</TE>
<TE>   The military exercises its power in part through the National
Security Council, which is made up of top political and military
leaders. In 1997, the generals used the council's monthly meetings to
badger Necmettin Erbakan, the nation's first Islamist prime minister,
into agreeing to curb Muslim religious schools and foundations. When
his government balked, the commanders orchestrated a campaign by
pro-secular business, labor and women's groups that forced Erbakan to
resign.</TE>
<TE>   The constitutional court banned his Welfare Party several months
later and slapped him with a five-year political ban that expires
early next year. His supporters in a successor party, Saadet, favor
holding elections next spring, so that he can lead their effort.</TE>
<TE>   Those fearful of state-imposed Islamic rules see Erdogan as the
current leader of that cause. "I really hate him," said Ayhan
Sarinalbant, a retired schoolteacher. "I think he's awful. Erbakan
was dangerous, but this man is 1,000 times more dangerous. He has a
lot more energy, and he's very clever."</TE>
<TE>   But Ramazan Hoca, an Istanbul resident who runs a stand selling
religious trinkets and music tapes, said Erdogan was a great mayor.
The corruption charges against Erdogan "are completely illogical,
absurd and stupid," he said. "Certain powers who fear for their own
power are doing this. But the people know this. If all the legal
obstacles are removed, he'll get enough votes to rule on his own."</TE>

<HD>Rebel Attack Forces Thousands to Flee Refugee Camp in
Uganda</HD>
<DH>Africa: Fourteen are killed and four abducted in a raid at
a facility that housed Sudanese.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KAMPALA, Uganda</DL>
<LD>Ugandan rebels fired on panic-stricken refugees Monday, forcing
24,000 to flee and killing 14 in a dawn raid on a United Nations
camp, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.</LD>
<LD>   Rebels from the Lord's Resistance Army abducted two Ugandan aid
workers during the attack, in which they commandeered an armored
vehicle and turned its guns on fleeing refugees from neighboring
Sudan before setting the vehicle ablaze, U.N. refugee spokeswoman
Bushra Malik said.</LD>
<LD>   The LRA, led by self-styled prophet Joseph Kony, is notorious for
cutting off villagers' lips and hacking off their limbs and has
kidnapped thousands of people for use as slaves, wives or fighters
during its 15-year insurgency in northern Uganda.</LD>
<TE>   "Initial reports are that eight refugees were killed," Malik said.
"Six Ugandan nationals have been killed as well."</TE>
<TE>   "All the stocks, food and non-food, have been looted, and they
completely burned the staff quarters."</TE>
<TE>   Malik said the two abducted Ugandans worked for the International
Rescue Committee aid agency. Two Sudanese refugees were also
abducted, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The IRC's New York offices later issued a statement saying that 37
of its staff members, all of them Ugandan nationals, were missing.</TE>
<TE>   "This attack on innocent civilians and aid workers is an outrage,"
IRC president George Rupp said.</TE>
<TE>   The attack, the second LRA raid on a U.N. refugee camp in Uganda
in a month, follows an intensification of LRA activity in response to
an army offensive launched in March.</TE>
<TE>   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, seeking to ward off criticism
that the offensive has done little to neutralize the rebels, traveled
to northern Uganda over the weekend to personally direct operations
against the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   In July, LRA rebels killed five refugees and a soldier and torched
buildings and looted supplies at a U.N. camp in the Adjumani district
of northern Uganda.</TE>

<HD>Santa Paula Ballot Arguments Written</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A battle over the future of Santa Paula's Adams Canyon has officially
begun, as community members on both sides of the issue have submitted
written arguments for voters to consider through the Nov. 5 election.</LD>
<LD>   Measure F would expand the city's growth boundaries to include
Adams Canyon, 5,413 acres of rugged hillsides and canyons to the
northwest.</LD>
<LD>   It would enable an Arizona developer to seek City Council approval
for up to 2,200 homes.</LD>
<TE>   In the ballot arguments, backers of the initiative--including
Santa Paula Mayor Ray Luna--say it will ensure that the council, not
the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, has control over what
happens in Adams Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   "We never thought we would have a dump or a jail in Santa Paula,
but we have them," Luna said. "We don't have the political clout in
the county that other cities do. We need local control."</TE>
<TE>   But opponents, including Santa Paula attorney Jim Procter and
former Councilman John Melton, call that argument an "insult to the
intelligence of Santa Paulans."</TE>
<TE>   Their ballot statement warns voters about traffic and pollution
that would likely result from a large development, adding that any
project would include upscale homes that few residents of the
blue-collar city could ever afford.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Miller, a Santa Paula resident and leading organizer in the
effort to keep Adams Canyon from being developed, said the measure is
not about city control.</TE>
<TE>   It is about an out-of-state developer who wants to clear the way
for a massive project, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not interested in moving the [growth boundary] for a
discussion--that is a smoke screen," he said. "They are very keen on
building a large-scale development there."</TE>
<TE>   While no project has been officially proposed, Arizona-based
Pinnacle Development Group has said it wants to build a mini-city to
be called the Ranch at Santa Paula. It would consist of homes,
schools, golf courses, hotels and shopping areas in Adams Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Boyd, project general manager for the developer, said if
Measure F passes, the company would hire planners to work with the
community to design a project that meets the public's needs.</TE>
<TE>   Under the city's General Plan, any such development would include
up to 400 units of affordable housing, recreation facilities and open
space, the proponents' ballot argument contends.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents say they support the development of Adams Canyon as a
way of revitalizing the cash-strapped city by bringing in added
taxes, new jobs and much-needed housing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the last opportunity we have to regain an economic
foothold in this area," said Planning Commissioner Gary Nasalroad,
who signed the ballot statement in favor of Measure F.</TE>
<TE>   But Miller said a remote canyon with no urban services, such as
streets, sewers and lighting, is the last place for a new suburb.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula voters said as much two years ago when they passed a
Save Open Space and Agriculture Resources initiative--requiring a
public vote before any new development was allowed in Adams Canyon.</TE>

<HD>Orphan Boy Saved From Deportation</HD>
<DH>Foster care: Woodland Hills resident takes in Guatemalan
teen whose parents, undocumented workers, were killed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Guatemalan boy facing deportation after his immigrant parents were
killed crossing a street in Sherman Oaks has been taken in by a
foster parent, improving his chances of staying in the United States
permanently, the boy's new guardian and county officials said on
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Candelario, 32, offered to become the guardian of Bryan
Mendoza after reading about his plight in a newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   Bryan, 14, ended up in legal limbo after his parents, whose visas
had expired, were struck and killed by a truck on July 21. He is now
living in Candelario's Woodland Hills apartment with two Mexican
teenage boys who were also stranded in the United States."They get
along great," said Candelario, who works as a clerk in a law firm.
"They're like a support group among themselves."</LD>
<TE>   Officials at the Los Angeles County Department of Children and
Family Services declined to discuss the case. But Candelario, a
licensed foster parent, said he was granted temporary custody of
Bryan last week and expects to gain permanent custody in upcoming
Juvenile Court hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials have said that
Bryan could be deported because his only relative in the United
States, an aunt, is also here on an expired visa. In such cases, INS
officials look to the country of origin for relatives who can take
custody of the child.</TE>
<TE>   But the new arrangement could allow Bryan to stay in the United
States because of a 1990 federal law that gives legal immigrant
status to undocumented children who are orphaned or separated from
their parents and are then placed in foster care, said Cecilia Saco,
a county case worker.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Monday, Bryan said he was pleased with the new
living situation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still pretty sad [about my parents], but now that I'm with
Steve, it's better," he said. "I want to stay here in the country,
study a lot and learn how to be an airplane mechanic."</TE>
<TE>   Bryan flew to the United States with his parents and his aunt nine
months ago on tourist visas that have since expired, Guatemalan
officials said. While his parents took low-paying custodial jobs,
Bryan enrolled in junior high school, began studying English and
joined a local soccer team.</TE>
<TE>   After Santos Mendoza, 41, and Floridalma Estrada, 38, were killed
while jaywalking on a dark stretch of Riverside Drive, Bryan's aunt,
Glenda Gomez, 23, said she couldn't afford to take care of him,
Candelario said.</TE>
<TE>   Now Candelario, a native New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent, is
welcoming the fourth member of a unique household that he said he
never would have envisioned until he gained custody three years ago
of a 15-year-old boy who had been abused by his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Candelario said he gained custody of the second boy, who is 16,
when his mother died of lupus.</TE>
<TE>   With Bryan's arrival, he said, things are getting a little crowded
in the two-bedroom bachelor pad.</TE>
<TE>   "We're moving to a three-bedroom within the month," he said.</TE>

<HD>Murder of Girl: Capital Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: Orange County D.A. wants death for Alejandro Avila,
who allegedly kidnapped, molested and killed Samantha Runnion, 5.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas said Monday that he will
seek the death penalty against the Lake Elsinore man accused of
molesting and killing 5-year-old Samantha Runnion of Stanton after
grabbing her as she played with a friend near her home.</LD>
<LD>   Rackauckas also said his prosecutors would offer no plea bargain
and believe Alejandro Avila could receive a fair trial in Orange
County despite the heavy publicity the crime has received.</LD>
<LD>   "This crime has shocked and outraged our community, our
nation--even other nations," Rackauckas declared during a news
conference at his office. "If there was ever a case where justice
would be served by seeking the death penalty, this is the case."</LD>
<TE>   Avila, 27, is being held without bail at the Central Men's Jail in
Santa Ana pending his arraignment Friday. He is charged with murder,
kidnapping and two counts of forcible lewd acts against a child.
Prosecutors can seek the death penalty under special circumstances:
The murder occurred after a kidnapping and the crime involved lewd
acts with a child.</TE>
<TE>   Avila professed his innocence in an interview with The Times hours
before his arrest, saying he was at Ontario Mills mall around the
time of the abduction.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Avila can receive a fair trial locally is likely to be a
key issue when he returns to court. Denise Gragg, the deputy public
defender representing Avila, declined to comment Monday on
Rackauckas' decision or to say whether she favors a change of venue.
But two weeks ago, she criticized President Bush for labeling Avila
"the killer" of Samantha before the defendant has had his day in
court.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office has traditionally held off much
longer before deciding whether to seek the death penalty. Typically,
the prosecutors wait at least until after the preliminary hearing,
when a judge decides whether there is enough evidence to bring a
defendant to trial.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas acknowledged that his office has "moved on this case
faster than any other" but did not elaborate on why prosecutors are
moving so swiftly.</TE>
<TE>   He said the decision was reached after consulting with Runnion's
family and his staff. After weighing many issues, including the
seriousness of the crime and all the evidence, members of the D.A.'s
death penalty review team agreed unanimously.</TE>
<TE>   "We took into account that Samantha was a stranger to her
assailant," Rackauckas said. "As an innocent child, she was extremely
vulnerable."</TE>
<TE>   Samantha's mother, Erin Runnion, released a statement Monday
saying her family was "grateful" to Rackauckas for discussing the
death penalty decision with them. "In our private meeting, he was
forthright with the options available and we express our gratitude
and trust in his judgment and expertise in prosecuting this case,"
the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha was abducted July 15 while playing near a row of garages
about 150 feet from the front step of her Laguna Court condominium. A
stranger asking for help finding his lost puppy grabbed her, kicking
and screaming, and forced her into his car.</TE>
<TE>   Her nude body was found the next day on the side of a mountain
road in Cleveland National Forest, along a route well-traveled by
hang gliders. Attention was focused on Avila after several tipsters
called a law enforcement hotline pointing investigators in his
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Avila was accused--and later acquitted--of molesting a girl who
until recently lived in Samantha's condominium complex. Avila matches
a description provided by the girl Samantha was playing with at the
time of her abduction, and his car was the green color she
remembered.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavits supporting Avila's arrest and several search
warrants filed during the investigation remain sealed under judicial
orders. But law enforcement sources have said DNA evidence links
Avila to the crime. One source also said cellular phone and credit
card records place him in south Orange County in the hours after
Samantha's abduction, near where body was found. Those records, the
source said, appear to contradict his alibi about being at the
Ontario mall.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dashing the hopes of a coalition of environmental and community
groups, a state appellate court in Los Angeles on Monday denied an
emergency request to halt construction of a terminal in the Port of
Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The court on Friday heard arguments from both the coalition and
the Port Authority regarding a stay of construction on the project's
first phase--a 1,200-foot wharf for the China Shipping and Holding
Co. that environmental groups say will worsen air quality for
residents, some of whom live within 500 feet of the project.</LD>
<LD>   But the court did agree that the coalition had raised "substantial
issues," and agreed to hear arguments on Oct. 18 for an environmental
review of the project, which is expected to be finished by then.</LD>

<LD>Jury selection began Monday for the murder trial of a Long Beach man
who is accused of killing his two children and leaving them in a
trash bin wrapped in plastic.</LD>
<LD>   Henry James White, 29, pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in
the deaths of his children, Brianna, 1, and Christopher, 5.
Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities say White killed his children, wrapped them in plastic
and threw them in a trash bin outside his apartment in 1999. He then
went to the Los Angeles County sheriff's station in Paramount and
told deputies he had hurt his kids and led them to their bodies.</LD>

<HD>Former Bell Gardens Official to Stand Trial</HD>
<DH>Politics: Judge orders ex-City Manager Maria Chacon to
appear for arraignment this month over an alleged conflict of
interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Bell Gardens City Manager Maria Chacon on Monday was ordered
to stand trial for allegedly violating conflict-of-interest laws by
engineering her appointment as manager.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Samuel Mayerson rejected Chacon's request to
dismiss or reduce the felony count to a misdemeanor charge, and
ordered her to appear for arraignment Aug. 19.</LD>
<LD>   The judge's ruling came after testimony from a district attorney's
investigator who said Chacon, a former councilwoman, voted for
measures clearing the way for her appointment, and then met with
council members to solicit support.</LD>
<TE>   Appointed to the $89,000-a-year post in December 2000, she was
fired after prosecutors filed the charge in June 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Chacon's attorney, Michael Nasatir, said the case was far from
over.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just the first round of a difficult fight ... and when
all the facts are brought out in court, justice will prevail," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The preliminary hearing was delayed for months when Chacon's
attorneys tried to get the Los Angeles County district attorney's
office removed from the case for alleged conflict-of-interest
violations.</TE>
<TE>   Chacon's attorneys said the prosecution was compromised because
the office's chief of investigations, Steve Simonian, worked in Bell
Gardens when the alleged crime occurred.</TE>
<TE>   A Superior Court judge agreed and disqualified the district
attorney's office, but an appeals court overturned the decision. If
convicted, Chacon could face a three-year prison term.</TE>

<LD>Two Oxnard gang members have been charged in last month's shooting
death of Eric Robles, 18, of Camarillo and the wounding of two of his
friends.</LD>
<LD>   Heriberto Arevalo and Jose Centeno, both 18, whom police
identified as known gang members, were charged with murder, shooting
at an occupied vehicle and assault with an automatic weapon. There
also is a special allegation that the crimes were committed to
benefit a street gang. They are scheduled to be arraigned Aug. 20 and
remain jailed in lieu of $1.5-million bail each.</LD>
<LD>   Robles, a Camarillo gang member, was killed July 6 on Raemere

also of Camarillo, entered a car. They were shot in an altercation
with several men in two other cars.</LD>

<HD>Witness Rejects Singer's Motive</HD>
<DH>Trial: Teen's manager rebuts the prosecution's theory that
unhappiness over a music contract led to an attempt on the life of
the Simi Valley girl's stepfather.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aspiring pop singer Jennifer Childs and her mother were pleased with
a music contract negotiated for the Simi Valley teen and had no
desire to break the agreement, a music industry manager testified
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The 19-year-old and her mother, Eileen Childs, 37, are accused of
setting fire to the mattress of the teen's stepfather, Larry Childs,
and beating him with baseball bats in an attempted murder.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors contend the two conspired to kill Larry Childs, 57, to
cash in on $1.4 million in life insurance to buy out the singer's
music contract and allow her mother to take over as her manager.</LD>
<TE>   But Torrance-based manager Alan Gaffere testified Monday that
Jennifer and Eileen Childs were involved in crafting the binding
contract with him and appeared pleased with the results.</TE>
<TE>   Gaffere said the teenager, who records under the name Jenni
Childs, has a Web site and a demo CD being circulated that received a
positive review from a music magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "Eileen was very much involved in the negotiation," Gaffere told
jurors, though he added that after the compact disc was recorded,
Eileen Childs became less involved. "She told me she doesn't want to
get in the way."</TE>
<TE>   Gaffere testified that his collaboration with Jennifer Childs has
been positive and he believes she shows promise as a recording
artist.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Lee, Gaffere
acknowledged that he is eager to see his client cleared of wrongdoing
so she can return to work.</TE>
<TE>   Gaffere testified that he has canceled 25 performances during the
last five months because the teen remains jailed in lieu of $500,000
bail.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Jean Farley, who represents Jennifer Childs, has
requested a bail hearing this week.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the public defender told Ventura County Superior Court
Judge Herbert Curtis that she would take responsibility for the girl,
letting her stay in Farley's home and driving her to court each day.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers for the mother and daughter say the pair are
innocent and called the prosecution's theory about a motive
preposterous.</TE>
<TE>   Farley told jurors in her opening statement that the two women
acted in self-defense after Larry Childs grabbed them by the hair and
dragged them across the room when a mattress in the family's master
bedroom caught fire.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony is scheduled to resume today.</TE>

<HD>Judge to Rule in Battle Over Church Land</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a closely watched case that pits a city's redevelopment efforts
against a church's property rights, a federal judge said he'll rule
today whether to grant a temporary injunction that would halt
condemnation proceedings on a piece of prime land in Cypress.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge David O. Carter heard arguments Monday from
attorneys representing Cottonwood Christian Center and the city of
Cypress in the first courtroom square-off in the nearly 2-year-old
battle that has gained national attention as a test case on religious
freedom.</LD>
<LD>   The two sides are fighting over 18 vacant acres near the Los
Alamitos Race Course that the mega-church bought in 1999 and plans to
develop as its new home. City officials rejected that plan in October
2000, and now say they want to put a Costco on Cottonwood's property
at the corner of Walker Street and Katella Avenue, the busiest
intersection in the city's 300-acre redevelopment zone.</LD>
<TE>   Cottonwood filed a federal suit in January, accusing the city of
discriminatory practices by stopping the church's building plans in
favor of businesses that would provide the city with tax dollars. In
May, the church sought a temporary injunction in federal court after
the City Council unanimously voted to condemn the church's land.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the city argued Monday that the city has a right to
enact its redevelopment plan, which includes seeking a "big-box"
retail outlet for the property. They also told the judge that
Cottonwood's objections should more properly be addressed in eminent
domain proceedings in state court.</TE>
<TE>   "What this case is about is trying to move forward with a
redevelopment plan," said Michael D. Rubin, who represents the city.
"The 18 acres is the key to transforming and revitalizing the
300-acre area."</TE>
<TE>   Were it not for the church's ownership of the property, Rubin said
the condemnation would be "a garden-variety redevelopment project."</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood's attorneys argued, however, that the city has
infringed on constitutional guarantees of religious freedom. The city
also is violating a religious land-use act passed by Congress in 2000
to prevent cities from impeding the free exercise of religion,
Cottonwood attorneys said. The only way to get those issues before
the court is to halt the city's eminent domain proceedings, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a land-use case," said Cottonwood attorney Kevin J.
Hasson, president of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a
Washington, D.C.-based group that concentrates on religious freedom
issues. "It's a constitutional case that involves land use."</TE>
<TE>   Hasson said Cypress officials waited a dozen years to advance
their redevelopment plans for the property and won't be harmed by
waiting until the constitutional issues are resolved in court.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney did concede that Cottonwood's ownership of the
property was the only reason this redevelopment case is out of the
ordinary.</TE>
<TE>   "Religion is special under the Constitution," Hasson said. "And
[it] is supposed to be special under the Constitution."</TE>

<HD>El Toro Ballot Proposal Dropped</HD>
<DH>Supervisors: Smith fails to win support for a Nov. 5
referendum on Irvine's park plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Supervisor Chuck Smith withdrew a proposal late Monday that would
have asked Orange County voters in November to authorize another vote
on the fate of the closed El Toro Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   Smith's move came as Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P.
Coad picked up support for her plan to ask voters to urge the Navy to
completely clean the base before it is sold to private developers.</LD>
<LD>   The flurry of interest in new measures was triggered by the Board
of Supervisors' Friday deadline to place items on the Nov. 5 ballot.</LD>
<TE>   Smith said he dropped his proposal after failing to draw enough
support. He wanted a countywide referendum on Irvine's plans to add
homes and other developments to an urban park at El Toro. In March,
voters backed a measure calling for a park at the closed base instead
of a commercial airport.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine wants to annex the 4,700-acre base, adding 3,400 homes and
2.9 million square feet of office space to plans for a university,
cemetery, golf and sports fields. The Navy announced in April that it
would sell the base to the highest bidder under Irvine's annexation
plans.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly, some members of this board are selective about what
they want the voters to ratify," Smith said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer said public support is behind the Irvine
plan. "For the board to put on an initiative without a groundswell of
public support was going to be a failure," he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Spitzer said he will back Coad's proposal for a November
advisory vote on an environmental cleanup at the base. He said he has
long called for the Navy to do a thorough examination of
contamination and to clean up the soil before any acreage is
sold--the intent of Coad's measure.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said he wasn't sure how he would vote on Coad's measure. He
said he shared her frustration, however, because the Navy prohibited
the county from testing soil at El Toro and based its cleanup plan on
the base being used as an airport, not a park.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Jim Silva didn't return calls for comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   If the park zoning voters approved in March "is the law of the
land, we need to make sure the land is cleaned up for it," Coad said.</TE>

<HD>Ladder, Bedsheets Used in Escape, Police Say</HD>
<DH>Crime: Three youths, two of them convicted of murder, fled
juvenile hall last week after overpowering guards with a handgun.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three juveniles, two of them convicted murderers, used a small ladder
from a utility room and bedsheets to climb over a 20-foot wall at
Central Juvenile Hall last week, according to law enforcement
officials. The escapees have not been found.</LD>
<LD>   The escape was orchestrated by Jose Argueta, 17, a Los Angeles
street gang leader who threatened one guard with a handgun, officials
said. The guard was warned that Argueta had nothing to lose with a
life sentence ahead of him.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Probation Officer Richard Shumsky, whose department operates
the 620-bed Lincoln Heights facility, said his investigators are
still trying to determine how the .45-caliber handgun was smuggled
in.</LD>
<TE>   "Given the fact [the guards] were held at gunpoint, it came from
somewhere. We don't know where," Shumsky said. "This is the first
instance where we've had hostages taken with a gun."</TE>
<TE>   Shumsky said that since the July 31 incident, the department has
adopted a policy requiring staffers to pass through the hall's metal
detectors, as do inmates and visitors. "There aren't going to be
ladders anymore," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot ladder that Argueta, fellow convicted murderer Marvin
Sandoval, 17, and convicted carjacker Fernando Nupiri, 18, used to
help them scale the 20-foot wall should never have been available,
Shumsky said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was outside policy," he said. The ladder was being used for an
improvement project in the facility. "It is no excuse. Obviously,
there was a breach," Shumsky said.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is slated to vote
today on a motion by Supervisor Mike Antonovich asking Shumsky for a
plan to prevent future breakouts.</TE>
<TE>   Some law enforcement officers are asking why Argueta, who is known
as Lil' Crazy, was not in Men's Central Jail.</TE>
<TE>   Shumsky said at present there are 42 beds for juveniles in the
main jail. "It is always full or close to full," Shumsky said.</TE>
<TE>   That left Argueta and Sandoval, who was convicted July 29 of
murdering a man he mistook for a rival gang member, in the juvenile
hall's Special Housing Unit. Those in the unit known as the SHU live
separately from other juveniles in custody.</TE>
<TE>   Staffers are armed with pepper spray and an alarm system, but have
no guns, Shumsky said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, the LAPD is the only response to an escape," said one
law enforcement source. Although the hall has metal detectors,
sources say, visitors are not always thoroughly searched, and known
street gang members and parolees are often among those allowed inside
as visitors.</TE>
<TE>   About 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, Argueta asked a guard to unlock his
room door to allow him to get a drink of water. Instead of going to
the water fountain, Argueta made his way to the office of the Special
Housing Unit, where he produced the gun. He took a guard's cell phone
and wallet and ordered him to lie on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   When a second guard entered the office, Argueta told him, "I've
got nothing to lose; I'm a lifer," according to a police report.
Argueta faced 50 years to life.</TE>
<TE>   Argueta then directed a third guard to unlock the rooms of
Sandoval and Nupiri. As that guard lay on the ground, Sandoval
demanded to know where the guard's cell phone was. The guard denied
having a phone, but Sandoval found it in a bag. Sandoval then kicked
the guard in his right side, telling him, "I should kill you,"
according to the police report.</TE>
<TE>   Argueta handcuffed the three guards, forced them into the "utility
closet," admonishing them to "not make any noise" unless they wanted
to be killed.</TE>
<TE>   The three juveniles took the keys from their guards and went
through a door that gave them access to the 20-foot outside wall.</TE>
<TE>   The three then used the ladder they found in a utility room to
scale the wall. With the aid of bedsheets tied like ropes, they
climbed over the razor-wire-topped wall.</TE>
<TE>   "They descended with the bedsheets. The bedsheets were found
dangling from outside," Shumsky said.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officers from the Hollenbeck Division were alerted shortly
before midnight and quickly brought in dogs and a helicopter to
conduct a search of the area that sits in the shadow of County-USC
Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   A short while later, a car was stolen in the neighborhood, and was
later recovered in the neighborhood frequented by Argueta's gang, law
enforcement sources say. Investigators suspect the car is connected
to the escape.</TE>

<HD>Assembly OKs Farm Labor Bill</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Measure would submit contracts to binding
arbitration. Governor hasn't decided whether he'll sign it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>To shouts of "viva" and an outburst of applause from farm workers in
the gallery, the Assembly voted Monday to submit agricultural labor
contracts to binding arbitration when talks between unions and
growers reach a deadlock.</LD>
<LD>   If signed by Gov. Gray Davis, who has concerns about it, a
spokesman said, the bill would mark the first time that the state's
landmark agricultural labor relations law has been amended since it
was enacted in 1975.</LD>
<LD>   The bill presents a dicey political challenge for the Democratic
governor as he runs for reelection, since he is seeking both to keep
organized labor as an ally and to persuade the business community
that he is a friend who can be trusted with a second term.</LD>
<TE>   The bill--SB 1736, by Senate leader John L. Burton (D-San
Francisco)--was sponsored by the United Farm Workers of America and
backed by organized labor.</TE>
<TE>   It was fought by such influential agribusiness organizations as
the California Farm Bureau Federation, Agricultural Council of
California and Western Growers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the United Farm Workers, founded by the late Cesar
Chavez, view binding arbitration as a hammer that would force growers
to reach agreements rather than risk having third-party arbitrators
impose contracts on them.</TE>
<TE>   The United Farm Workers say that major growers for years have
refused to enter into union contracts, even though their employees
have voted for the union.</TE>
<TE>   They say growers stall merely by refusing to bargain in good
faith.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Davis and the Legislature agreed to a system of binding
arbitration for backstretch workers at race tracks by reclassifying
them as "agricultural workers." In exchange for binding arbitration,
track operators were allowed to expand their operations to include
Internet and telephone betting.</TE>
<TE>   But the United Farm Workers and their Democratic supporters in the
Legislature insisted that farm workers who produce the food for
Californians should receive the same binding arbitration benefits as
backstretch workers.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill, a union and grower could seek mediation and
conciliation to resolve differences. But if an impasse occurred,
either side could petition the state Agricultural Labor Relations
Board to appoint an arbitrator who could impose a binding settlement,
subject to court challenge.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 agricultural employees in denims and red shirts bearing
the black eagle logo of the United Farm Workers filled the Assembly
chamber gallery in a show of support for the bill. They applauded and
cheered when the bill was approved 49-22 on a nearly party-line vote.</TE>
<TE>   The measure was returned to the Senate where routine approval of
technical amendments made in the Assembly is expected. It is then to
go to Davis, who has not taken a position on it, said spokesman Russ
Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said the governor has been "very supportive of farm
workers," but had "some concerns" about the bill and wanted to "see
what its impact would be on the business community."</TE>
<TE>   During an intense debate, Assemblyman Dean Florez of Shafter, a
Democrat whose San Joaquin Valley district includes vast agribusiness
enterprises, argued that farm workers had been promised by the
state's agricultural labor relations law nearly three decades ago
that they would have equal bargaining power with growers at the
negotiating table.</TE>
<TE>   But he said, because growers have refused to negotiate contracts
with the United Farm Workers, tens of thousands of laborers are
denied union wages, benefits and other protection to which they are
entitled.</TE>
<TE>   "Today we are trying to fulfill that promise," Florez told the
Assembly, saying that Latino voters are watching. "They are watching
the vote today. They want fairness. They want equity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Assemblyman Robert Pacheco (D-Walnut), who said he had
worked as a vegetable picker, said he was "sympathetic to the needs
of farm workers. But this bill bothers me." He complained that,
although it applied to agricultural employers, it did not apply to
labor contractors hired by employers.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Unveils Plan to Revise Business Taxes</HD>
<DH>Government: Mayor hopes to simplify levies and extend
exemptions, with council support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn announced several proposed business
tax reforms Monday aimed at simplifying and updating the city's
much-criticized tax structure.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn stressed that he had consulted key council members in
drafting his tax plan, in an effort to avoid the political pitfalls
that frustrated his predecessor. "I recognized very early on that, if
we wanted to get things done, we need to work as a team," Hahn said.</LD>
<LD>   Reform of the business tax code was a major priority and a major
disappointment for former Mayor Richard Riordan, whose proposals were
mostly thwarted by a combative City Council.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn, however, is moving more slowly and the threat of secession
in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood has made the council more
receptive.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the mayor, flanked by several council members
and business leaders, called for:</TE>
<TE>   * An independent study of tax reform alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   * Extending the current tax exemption to include, not only
start-up businesses, but also businesses that are new to the city.</TE>
<TE>   * Simplifying the way taxes are filed for thousands of businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to create a better business climate here in Los Angeles,"
Hahn said at a news conference at the Los Angeles Area Chamber of
Commerce. "Los Angeles must plan for its financial future."</TE>
<TE>   While the mayor received praise for making the proposals, several
people said the harder part of tax reform is yet to come.</TE>
<TE>   "The tough part will be the details--it's a very complicated
system," said Larry Kosmont, whose firm conducts annual assessments
of the cost of doing business in the state. "The challenges are ahead
of us."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is routinely rated the most expensive city in
California, and among the top 10 nationally, because of its various
costly taxes, Kosmont said.</TE>
<TE>   Several council members said they support the mayor's proposals,
which need council approval. "Let us commit today to cutting red
tape," Councilman Eric Garcetti, chairman of the council's Economic
Development and Employment Committee, said at the news conference. He
said the city needs to show that it is open for business.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Nick Pacheco, who heads the council's Budget and
Finance Committee, said the focus must be on small businesses, which
account for 99% of the city's business taxpayers. "They are the
backbone of our city's economy," Pacheco said.</TE>
<TE>   The city collected $360 million in business tax revenue in the
last fiscal year, officials said, and they are hoping to develop a
plan that will update the system but remain revenue-neutral. In a
slowly recovering economy, that could be difficult, some economists
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Kyser, an economist with the nonprofit Los Angeles County
Economic Development Corp., said that the state's budget problems
this year could trickle down to the local level and that the economy
might make it hard for the Hahn administration to develop meaningful
tax reform. Still, with the November vote on secession looming, the
timing is right for the mayor and the City Council to address this
issue, he said.</TE>
<TE>   If the city retains its complex tax system, Kyser said,
pro-secessionists can continue to argue that businesses are unwilling
to relocate here and that other cities can lure them with simpler tax
rates and filing systems.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Dennis Zine, who represents the west San Fernando
Valley, said at the news conference that the city "can succeed
without secession."</TE>
<TE>   Under the mayor's proposals Monday, businesses that now pay taxes
in multiple categories could pay in a primary category. His plan
would also modify the system by which the city calculates taxes for
businesses that pay according to their gross receipts.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he is directing the Office of Finance to report
quarterly on the status of the tax reform trust fund. The mayor said
his goal is to designate 75% of all revenues flowing to the city from
the state Franchise Tax Board for business tax reform and 25% would
be used for the housing trust fund. That money from the Franchise Tax
Board, which represents about 10% of the general fund, could be used
to offset potential tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said that council members would introduce these
proposals and that he believes he has their full support.</TE>

<HD>Parents, Students Protest Transfer of Magnet School
Administrator</HD>
<DH>Education: About 200 rally at Hamilton High's music school
in support of the assistant principal. District says he requested
change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Parents and students Monday afternoon angrily protested the transfer
of the assistant principal who had run Hamilton High School's Academy
of Music.</LD>
<LD>   About 200 people, some toting instruments and others waving picket
signs, rallied in support of the music magnet's administrator, Jeff
Kaufman, outside the Westside school's concert hall.</LD>
<LD>   Kaufman was reassigned to an assistant principal's position at
Emerson Middle School in Westwood. District officials and Kaufman
said he had requested a transfer, but he maintained that he had
sought to become a principal, not to make a lateral move.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm very distraught and very unhappy," said Kaufman, reached by
telephone while traveling in New England. "I have put a lot into that
school--heart and soul and countless hours. I always do what I feel
is in the best interests of the students, and it is my opinion this
decision is not. Maybe it's not the intent to benefit the students at
Hamilton, it's to benefit the ones at Emerson."</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman, who turns 53 today and has headed the academy since 1991,
said he would prefer to stay at Hamilton two more years to help
select and train his successor until he is eligible to retire.</TE>
<TE>   The music academy and a humanities magnet are separate schools
within Hamilton's main community-based school, all part of the Los
Angeles Unified School District. The district's local administrator,
Carol Dodd, said Kaufman had aggressively pursued a transfer for more
than a month, starting June 27.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he was tired, that he just couldn't handle it anymore,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Dodd said parents have been bombarding her with phone calls,
e-mails and letters since the announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult for them to understand that Jeff would ever pursue
leaving Hamilton High School," Dodd said. "I don't feel comfortable
discussing his actions with the community, but all I have been able
to say is that this is an action initiated by Jeff and actively
pursued by him."</TE>
<TE>   Officials had asked Kaufman several times if he were serious, Dodd
said, adding that he had sent in applications and letters of intent
for a transfer, as well as for a head position at a continuation
school--a position he eventually declined because it would entail a
$12,000 pay cut. Kaufman's position was filled once Dodd determined
that Kaufman was intent on leaving the academy.</TE>
<TE>   The replacement, who Dodd said works in the district and has a
background in the arts, administration and conflict resolution, will
be named within the next week. District Supt. Roy Romer fully
supports Dodd's decision, said his spokeswoman, Stephanie Brady.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 of the academy's more than 900 students attended the
rally Monday, along with many of their parents.</TE>
<TE>   "This is truly taking someone who has made this academy a great
success and punishing them," said Mario Milch of Los Feliz, whose
daughter attends the school.</TE>
<TE>   As senior Ary Katz of Silver Lake colored in a sign that read,
"Honk if You Love Music," a jazz sextet played in the background.</TE>
<TE>   "Without him I don't know what this place is going to be," Katz
said. "He's really a profound and amazing man, and without him this
school will do nothing but decline."</TE>

<KH>CHICK HEARN: 1916-2002</KH>
<HD>The Lakers' Legendary Voice</HD>
<DH>Sports: The team's broadcaster since 1961 coined terms like
'slam dunk.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER and LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chick Hearn, the legendary broadcaster who provided the lively
soundtrack to more than four decades of Los Angeles Laker basketball,
inventing a new vocabulary along the way, died Monday. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Hearn died about 6:30 p.m. at Northridge Hospital Medical Center,
where he was admitted Friday night after falling at his home in
Encino. He underwent two craniotomies to control brain hemorrhaging
Saturday but never regained consciousness. He declined seriously
Sunday and by Monday morning his condition was downgraded to grave.</LD>
<LD>   Talking to reporters at the hospital Monday night, Dr. Asher
Taban, Hearn's neurosurgeon, said, "The injury to the brain stem was
the main cause of death."</LD>
<TE>   Hearn, who was instrumental in introducing professional basketball
to Southern California sports fans after the Lakers moved west from
Minneapolis in 1960, broadcast 3,338 consecutive games in a streak
that began in 1965 and ended when he suffered a series of medical
setbacks that began late last year.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn missed his first Laker broadcast in 36 years last Dec. 20
after undergoing heart valve replacement surgery the previous day.
Two months later, he slipped and fell getting out of his car,
breaking his hip. The injury required Hearn to undergo
hip-replacement surgery, extending his absence from the Lakers to 113
days and 56 games.</TE>
<TE>   On April 9, Hearn returned to his familiar seat at Staples Center,
calling the play-by-play during a 30-point Laker victory over the
Utah Jazz. Though his voice sounded weak at the beginning of the
broadcast, Hearn sounded more robust as the game progressed, clearly
enjoying the appreciative applause from the fans and the opportunity
to entertain local radio and television listeners with his unique
wordplay once again.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the happiest I've been since I married Marge!" he
exclaimed on the air, referring to his wife of nearly 64 years. Half
a beat later, he was quickly back to business: "Shaq down the middle
... BLOWS THE LAYUP!"</TE>
<TE>   Hearn remained with the Lakers through the clinching of their
third consecutive National Basketball Assn. championship in June. It
was the Lakers' ninth league title since arriving in Los Angeles, and
from Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain to Magic Johnson and Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar to Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, Hearn had provided
the colorful narration.</TE>
<TE>   "It is impossible to express the depth of our sorrow.... This is
one very sad day for everyone associated with the Lakers, the NBA and
with the sports industry," said Laker owner Jerry Buss in a statement
from London where he was traveling. "What Chick has meant to the
Lakers and the popularity of NBA basketball in Los Angeles can never
be overestimated. His 'word's-eye view' is as responsible for this
success as any of the great players who have worn a Laker uniform. We
will be forever grateful to him."</TE>
<TE>   Former Laker star Magic Johnson expressed his sadness in a
statement Monday night to Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never forget all those times when I needed a hug, when I
needed a high five, he told me, 'It's going to be all right.' He
always uplifted me and uplifted other people, and I'll tell you
something, basketball and the Lakers, without him calling the games,
it would have never been the same."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Northridge hospital Monday evening, Laker general
manager and former player Mitch Kupchak said:</TE>
<TE>   "If you are a Lakers fan, if you are a basketball fan, if you are
a sports fan in general, you know this is truly not a good day....
Chick, we will miss you. Quite simply, you are the best."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn was the effervescent common link to every chapter in the
team's Los Angeles history and nearly as valuable to the franchise as
any of its storied players. His distinctive high-speed delivery--so
fast that Hearn often announced a player had scored while the shot
was still in the air--was perfectly suited to the Lakers'
fast-breaking "Showtime" playing style.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn invented a lexicon that has become as much a part of the
game of modern basketball as the three-point field goal--"Chickisms,"
they were called. He concocted such phrases as "airball" for a shot
that misses the rim, "slam dunk" for a shot that is thrust down into
the basket, "yo-yoing up and down" to describe a player dribbling a
basketball, and "dribble drive" for a player driving hard to the
basket.</TE>
<TE>   With Hearn behind the microphone, the Lakers didn't just pull away
from a beaten opponent, they "put the game in the refrigerator." A
defender badly fooled by a player with the ball was "faked into the
popcorn machine." When a player mishandled the ball while trying a
needlessly flashy move, Hearn determined that "the mustard's off the
hot dog."</TE>
<TE>   "He had this phenomenal ability to sound as fresh in the last game
of last season as he did in the first game of his first season," said
"Monday Night Football" broadcaster Al Michaels, who worked briefly
as Hearn's partner in the late 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "His medical problems obviously affected his voice in recent
years. But nothing could affect his enthusiasm and sense of humor....</TE>
<TE>   "To do what he did as long as he did with fresh and unabashed
enthusiasm is truly astonishing. Chick understood the essence of the
game. He had such vast knowledge he could have been a coach."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Sharman, former Laker coach, general manager and president
and now a special consultant to the team, said, "I've been in pro
ball since 1950 and I've heard a lot of announcers, but no one was
close to Chick. He was dramatic, humorous and informative, and he has
a passion for the game."</TE>
<TE>   Along with his contributions to the sporting vocabulary, Hearn
pioneered the "simulcast''--the nuanced art of calling a game
simultaneously for radio and television. Hearn adroitly straddled the
fine line between giving his television audience, with the action
right in front of them, too much information and his radio listeners,
relying on Hearn to create a vivid verbal picture, not enough.</TE>
<TE>   It's a subtle craft, and for more than 40 years with the Lakers,
he was the master of the simulcast.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn always said he couldn't remember the first time he put a
game in the refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   "It was at least 10 years ago, oh, maybe much longer ago than
that," he said in January 1998. "It just popped out, like a lot of
things do. It just didn't seem like a big deal at the time."</TE>
<TE>   A reader once wrote that he remembered Hearn using the phrase when
he was doing Bradley University basketball in 1950.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it's possible," Hearn said.</TE>
<TE>   Later came the phrase "The door is closed, the light is out, the
eggs are cooling, and the butter is getting hard."</TE>
<TE>   That came from the late Gladys Worthy, the mother of former Lakers
star forward James Worthy.</TE>
<TE>   "Chick and my mother struck up a friendship, and she used to write
to him occasionally," said Worthy, a member of the Lakers of the
1980s. "She suggested in a letter to Chick that he add 'the door is
closed, the light is out, the eggs are cooling, and the butter is
getting hard' whenever he put a game in the refrigerator. I don't
know where she got it, whether it's a Southern saying or what."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn once said, "Mrs. Worthy definitely gets credit for that,
bless her heart. The 'Jell-O is jiggling' came later. A fan wrote to
suggest that."</TE>
<TE>   Francis Dayle Hearn was born on Nov. 27, 1916, in Buda, Ill., one
of two sons of a railroad worker.</TE>
<TE>   The family moved to Aurora, near Chicago, in 1925, and Fran Hearn
played basketball at East Aurora High. He might have gone to college
on an athletic scholarship, except that his father was seriously
injured in an auto accident. Hearn was forced to get a job and forget
college.</TE>
<TE>   When Hearn was 19, he was involved in a car wreck and was put in a
body cast to heal broken ribs. Then he had to have the cast removed
for an emergency appendectomy and later developed pneumonia. The
prognosis was so bleak at one point that he was given last rites.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn became known as Chick when he was 22. Some teammates on an
AAU basketball team in Aurora turned the tables on Hearn, a chronic
practical joker, and played a practical joke on him. They handed
Hearn a shoebox, but instead of new shoes, it contained a dead
chicken, covered with bugs.</TE>
<TE>   "I got it all over me--it was awful," Hearn said.</TE>
<TE>   After that, his teammates started calling him Chicken, which
eventually was shortened to Chick. The name stuck throughout his long
and busy broadcasting career.</TE>
<TE>   It began with Armed Forces Radio when Hearn was stationed in the
Philippines during World War II. When he was discharged in 1946, he
decided to give broadcasting a shot in Aurora. He failed to get the
first job he applied for and began selling pharmaceuticals. But the
station manager who turned him down the first time came back and
offered him $5 to announce the second game of a high school
basketball doubleheader.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn worked the game but told the station manager to keep his $5.
He wanted a full-time job and got it--at $47 a week. He did a little
bit of everything--disc jockey, religious programming, news, sports
and weather.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn recalled his father's reaction when he told him he was
giving up the lucrative pharmaceutical business to go into radio. "He
just looked at me and said, 'Do you think radio is really here to
stay?' " Hearn recalled.</TE>
<TE>   By 1950, Hearn was announcing Bradley basketball for a station in
Peoria. A year later he came to Los Angeles to work for CBS radio and
announce USC football, an assignment that lasted until 1963.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn loved broadcasting. While steadily busy with the Lakers, he
also did some USC play-by-play for Channel 5 in the mid-1970s and
selected Nevada-Las Vegas basketball games from 1977-91.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Manoogian, who owned the rights to the Las Vegas package,
declined to say how much he paid Hearn but said, "Believe me, he
didn't do it for the money. He did it because he loved to work. And
he took the job seriously. He always came over the night before a
game to prepare for the telecasts.''</TE>
<TE>   During most of the 1970s, Hearn was the host of the popular local
game show ''Bowling for Dollars.'' Hearn won a lot of fans doing that
show. One was Jeanie Buss, who, in addition to being the daughter of
Laker owner Buss, is the team's executive vice president of business.</TE>
<TE>   She was 17 when her father bought the Lakers in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a huge Chick Hearn fan, not because of the Lakers but
because of 'Bowling for Dollars,' '' she said. "I remember meeting
him was one of the thrills of my life at the time because I was such
a fan."</TE>
<TE>   In his early L.A. days, Hearn also worked for the NBC network and
the local NBC station. When Bob Short brought the Lakers to town,
they had no television or radio contracts. But in March 1961, before
the Lakers' first playoff game in St. Louis, Short called Hearn at 2
a.m. on a Sunday and persuaded him to fly to St. Louis and broadcast
the game on radio. "The broadcast went well," Hearn remembered. "It
was a great game [the Lakers won, 122-118, but lost the series]. I
guess they liked my work."</TE>
<TE>   Years later, Pulitzer-prize winning Times sports columnist Jim
Murray would write that Hearn was instrumental in making professional
basketball a top draw in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Any sport needs a lively nomenclature, word pictures that go into
the language," Murray wrote in 1986 when Hearn was given a star on
the Hollywood Walk of Fame. "Simple terms like bases loaded, circus
catch, circuit clout, screwball and squeeze play all served to
dramatize the grand old game of baseball that even became a national
pastime, thanks to some chronicler of press row."</TE>
<TE>   "....Chick Hearn did the same thing for pro basketball, which had
almost no language of its own when he came along. No more could
division playoff games be played before 2,800 spectators after Chick
hit the scene. They became the hardest tickets in town once Chick was
out in front of the tent."</TE>
<TE>   At the dedication ceremony, former Lakers star Elgin Baylor, who
is now the general manager of the Clippers, said to Hearn: "You made
us stars. When you have a product, you need somebody to promote it.
That was Chick."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn was proud of his long marriage to Marge, whom he met in a
class when both were juniors at East Aurora High.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to pass him the answers," Marge once said, which prompted
Hearn to say, "She's still passing me the answers."</TE>
<TE>   They were married on Aug. 13, 1938, and would have celebrated
their 64th anniversary on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Of Marge, Hearn once said, "I don't know what I would have done
without her. She is definitely the woman behind this man."</TE>
<TE>   Chick and Marge had to cope with the heartbreak of losing both of
their children. Gary, their first born, died at 29 in 1972 from a
drug overdose. Daughter Samantha died at 43 in 1990 of viral
pneumonia brought on by years of battling anorexia.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't a day that goes by that something doesn't pop up to
remind [us] of them, a song they liked, something they did," Marge
told The Times in May 2000. "I talk about them to keep them alive
that way. [Chick] can hardly mention their names."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn turned down numerous requests to write his autobiography
because, he said, it would be too painful to talk about his children.</TE>
<TE>   He nearly ended his consecutive-games streak in 1990, with
Samantha hospitalized because of pneumonia, her condition reaching
the critical stage as the Lakers were about to be eliminated from the
playoffs by the Phoenix Suns.</TE>
<TE>   "I shouldn't go tonight," Chick told Marge as game time approached
at the Forum. "You may as well," Marge told him. "There's nothing you
can do at the hospital."</TE>
<TE>   So Hearn was in his customary perch at the Forum on May 15, 1990,
as the Suns ended the Laker season with a 106-103 victory. Samantha
died nine days later.</TE>
<TE>   "You never expect your children to die before you. For us, it was
a double loss," Hearn said in 2000. "At the time, we thought we were
doing everything we could for them. We never knew it would end in
death for both of them. God knows, we tried everything."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn's consecutive-game streak began on Nov. 21, 1965, in his
fifth season with the Lakers. He had missed the previous game because
he was stranded by a snowstorm in Fayetteville, Ark., after calling
an Arkansas-Texas Tech college football game. Hearn was on the plane,
on the ground, when the pilot announced the weather was too bad to
fly in.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't think we should fly," Hearn told the pilot, "that's
good enough for me."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn worked with six partners during the streak, beginning with
Michaels, then fresh out of college, briefly in 1967. Previously,
Hearn had worked solo, and he resented Michaels' intrusion as a
station-appointed color analyst. Michaels spent eight games at
Hearn's side, getting to talk in only four, before the experiment was
called off.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Hearn relented and agreed to a full-time sidekick. He
worked with former Laker Hot Rod Hundley in 1968, followed by Lynn
Shackleford, Keith Erickson, eventual Laker Coach Pat Riley and Stu
Lantz.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn had a gruff side, which he frequently exhibited when growing
impatient with members of his broadcast staff or callers to his
pregame Laker talk show.</TE>
<TE>   "Chick was a perfectionist," said Lantz. "He wanted to be perfect,
and he wanted everyone around him to be perfect. I knew that when I
took the job."</TE>
<TE>   But Hearn once described himself as crusty on the outside but made
of mush in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, a fan, after working up his nerve, approached Hearn at
the Forum and handed him a piece of paper with a name on it.</TE>
<TE>   "Chick," the fan said hesitantly, "my mother is in her 70s, and
she loves basketball. She loves you. Could you mention her name on
the air?"</TE>
<TE>   Said Hearn: "Of course."</TE>
<TE>   The fan walked away and, for the benefit of a few reporters who
were there, Hearn mumbled something like, "Yeah, fat chance," and
crumbled the piece of paper and threw it in a nearby trash container.</TE>
<TE>   It got a good laugh.</TE>
<TE>   But as soon as everyone went away, Hearn dug the crumbled paper
out of a trash container and smoothed it out.</TE>
<TE>   He read the name on the air.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, my God, what have I done?" Hearn once recalled. "I
can't read everyone's name on the air, but in this case I was glad I
did. I got several nice thank-you notes from those people."</TE>
<TE>   Michaels recalled a time this spring when he and his wife Linda
were in their car listening to Hearn call a playoff game on Mother's
Day.</TE>
<TE>   "Right in the middle of two crucial free throws near the end of
the game, Chick wished all mothers a happy Mother's Day," Michaels
said. "I just started laughing out loud."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn worked for three Laker owners--Short, Jack Kent Cooke and
Buss.</TE>
<TE>   Cooke, figuring that he could save money by giving Hearn two jobs,
also made him assistant general manager. In that position, Hearn had
one of five votes when the Lakers made their biggest trade
ever--acquiring Abdul-Jabbar from the Milwaukee Bucks in 1975. The
Lakers gave up four players for Abdul-Jabbar, who became the dominant
center of his era.</TE>
<TE>   When Buss bought the team from Cooke in 1979, Buss relieved Hearn
of his administrative responsibilities. But not wanting to make it
appear that Hearn was being demoted, he let him keep his title for a
number of years.</TE>
<TE>   Of Hearn, the great Dodger announcer Vin Scully said Monday night:</TE>
<TE>   "Though we have lost a dear friend and a true broadcasting legend
today, I would like to offer a prayer of thanksgiving for having been
able to enjoy his work for all these years. Chick had immense talent
that was driven by a tremendous work ethic and an insurmountable
passion for the game and his trade. His personality, character and
professionalism will be greatly missed, yet his spirit, importance
and impact will live forever."</TE>
<TE>   Besides his wife Marge, Hearn is survived by his granddaughter,
Gary's daughter Shannon Newman; her husband Louis; and
great-granddaughter Kayli, 2, who live in Placentia.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, Hearn was asked if he thought that he had left a
legacy. After some thought, he said only, "I just hope I've made a
contribution to the game."</TE>
<TE>   Asked what should be put on his tombstone, Hearn didn't have to
think about it.</TE>
<TE>   "No harm, no foul," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Steve Springer contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Ventura County Is in a Quandary Over Farm Worker Housing</HD>
<DH>Policy: Study finds that limits on residential construction
compound problems of lack of decent, affordable dwellings for
laborers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many of Ventura County's farm workers live in dwellings that are
overcrowded and lack hot water, toilets, sinks or adequate heating, a
new study shows.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, field laborers and their families are forced to
double and even triple up just to pay the monthly rent, considering
the county's costly housing market, a county study says.</LD>
<LD>   With strict limits on where growth can occur, policymakers must
decide where and how to build affordable farm housing so that
agriculture can remain a viable industry, the report concludes.</LD>
<TE>   "This just validates what everyone who is close to the business
knows," said Barbara Macri-Ortiz, an Oxnard lawyer and labor
advocate. "These workers are not housed properly and live in
conditions most people would abhor. For agriculture to be successful,
housing has to be part of the equation."</TE>
<TE>   The report--prepared by county staff working with a citizen
advisory group--is scheduled to be presented to the Board of
Supervisors today. Board members are expected to receive the study
and give staff direction on additional steps needed to address the
housing crunch.</TE>
<TE>   Seasonal laborers who harvest California's crops have long been
relegated to bunkhouses, shacks and other dilapidated dwellings. But
over the last two decades, these workers increasingly have become
permanent residents, bringing families with them.</TE>
<TE>   Housing to shelter them has not kept pace. University of
California studies estimate that the housing shortage for farm
workers has grown to nearly 100,000 units statewide. California
licenses 1,240 private labor camps, which provide housing for single
workers, but even those are becoming scarce.</TE>
<TE>   The state also provides grants for local governments to build farm
worker housing. It has invested about $70 million on projects in the
last four years, said Judy Nevis, chief deputy director of the state
Department of Housing and Community Development.</TE>
<TE>   "That's going to start to make a difference," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Counties have dealt with the problem in a piecemeal fashion. In
Napa Valley's grape-growing region, however, one innovative program
is underway.</TE>
<TE>   Construction is to begin this month on a 60-bed farm worker
housing facility. Growers voted to tax themselves to generate funds,
and several Napa companies added additional money. The facility will
be located on eight acres of donated land on the Silverado Trail near
St. Helena. It is expected to be completed in time for the 2003 grape
harvest.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, a private foundation gave $31 million to build housing
and health-care facilities for workers in the Central Valley. The
money was believed to be the largest award of its kind to assist farm
workers.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, the state's 10th-largest agricultural region,
an estimated 20,000 farm workers pick lemons, strawberries and
broccoli each year. Some farm worker housing has been constructed in
recent years, and more is planned.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard has two new apartment-style projects in the works, adding
about 75 units to accommodate families. Another proposal is working
its way through Santa Paula's planning process. Although no one is
sure how many new housing units are needed locally, officials
estimate that hundreds more must be built to begin to make a dent.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors last year asked for the survey to
ask agricultural workers about income, the number of people who live
in their homes, and living conditions. Although the poll was not
scientific, the county received about 1,516 completed questionnaires
of the 9,000 distributed.</TE>
<TE>   The responses provide a credible "snapshot" of how laborers are
getting by, said several members of a citizens advisory group that
helped with the survey.</TE>
<TE>   "Our farm workers are essentially invisible. We don't see how they
are living," said Ellen Brokaw, a committee member who farms avocados
and exotic plants. "We as farmers know how important they are to us.
But those who aren't farmers, and who voted for the restrictions
imposed by SOAR [growth-control initiatives], don't know the
essential immorality of not providing them a place to live."</TE>
<TE>   According to the study, about 70% of the respondents earn a median
income of $11,760, qualifying them as "extremely low income" by
federal standards. By contrast, the median income for all Ventura
County residents is $59,000.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-one percent of survey respondents reported living in
dwellings that are overcrowded, 22% said they lack adequate heating
and 7% have no bathroom facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Even if supervisors agree on the need for more housing, two big
questions would remain: Who will pay for it, and where will it be
built?</TE>
<TE>   Committee members say solutions are available if the county and
cities cooperate. Federal grants for farm worker housing can be
tapped, said Supervisor John K. Flynn, who met with housing officials
during a visit to Washington, D.C., last week.</TE>
<TE>   But the county can't do it alone, he said. The study pointed out
that 92% of respondents live within one of Ventura County's 10
cities.</TE>
<TE>   "Oxnard has always been very good on this issue," said Flynn,
whose 5th District is based in Oxnard. "But some of the other cities
need to examine the morality of some of their positions. I think they
will step up to the plate though."</TE>
<TE>   The study identifies 204 parcels of land that could be used to
build housing. They are scattered across the county, except in the
cities of Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Port Hueneme.</TE>
<TE>   Those cities were excluded because they do not have enough
irrigated farmland nearby, a condition for identifying a potential
site, committee members said.</TE>

<HD>Mourners in San Diego Recall a 'Mighty Woman of Israel'</HD>
<DH>Funeral: More than 2,000 attend service for Marla Bennett,
one of five American victims of a terrorist's bomb.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>In a tearful funeral here, a 24-year-old San Diego woman killed by a
terrorist bombing at Hebrew University in Jerusalem last week was
eulogized Monday as "one of Israel's martyrs for shalom, for peace."</LD>
<LD>   Rabbi Martin Lawson remembered Marla Bennett, a graduate of UC
Berkeley who went to Jerusalem to study Hebrew and Judaism, as "a
mighty woman of Israel" who was dedicated to the survival of the
embattled nation and who worked for reconciliation between Jews and
Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   "How could it happen that a person of such goodness would be taken
from us?" asked Lawson, of Temple Emanu-El. "The world too often
teaches hate and violence, rather than love and peace."</LD>
<TE>   Under tight security, an overflow crowd of more than 2,000 people
attended the hourlong service at Tifereth Israel Synagogue. The
casket was draped with the U.S. and Israeli flags.</TE>
<TE>   "Like 605 Israelis who have been murdered in the last two years,
Marla's life was taken through no fault of her own," said Tzvi Vapni,
deputy counsel general of the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles. "She
was targeted by a Palestinian organization which believes that the
innocent have no right to live ... an indiscriminate cult of death
that has brainwashed so many in the Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   Bennett, an honor student, had planned a career as a teacher and
administrator in the Jewish education system. She had planned to
return to San Diego late last week for a family bar mitzvah and the
wedding of a college friend.</TE>
<TE>   She was among five Americans killed when a remote-controlled bomb
exploded in the cafeteria at Hebrew University, once considered a
safe zone from terrorism. Two other people were killed and nearly 100
injured in an attack that brought a swift retaliation by the Israeli
military.</TE>
<TE>   Lawson said Bennett had been "murdered at the hands of Hamas
terrorists." Leaders of the radical Islamic organization, which is
dedicated to the destruction of Israel, have expressed regret for the
death of "non-Zionists," but have also said "they were in a place
they should not have been."</TE>
<TE>   Bennett's boyfriend, Michael Simon of Long Beach, noted that she
had always been careful to avoid places where terrorism might strike,
except last week when she was shopping for presents for friends in
San Diego. He had planned to come to San Diego to meet members of her
family; instead, he accompanied her body on the flight from Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "She never missed an opportunity to bring goodness into the
world," said Simon, his voice breaking. "The pain is so unfathomable,
the emptiness is so deep."</TE>
<TE>   Terry Smooke, a representative of Gov. Gray Davis, presented a
proclamation from Davis naming Monday as Marla Bennett Memorial Day
and condemning the "clenched fist of religious violence and hatred
[that] has now struck one of our own."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Susan Davis (D-San Diego) said that "terrorism has hit us
hard. We will never forget. We will never forget Marla."</TE>
<TE>   Lawson suggested that Bennett's grief-stricken friends and family
members should look to the story of Job, who lost his wife, his
children and all his possessions but refused to lose faith.</TE>
<TE>   "Job in his sorrow cried: 'God has given, God has taken away,
blessed be the name of God,' " Lawson said. "An ancient people, we
are not strangers to grief or the valley of shadows."</TE>
<TE>   The other Americans killed in the explosion were Benjamin
Blutstein, 25, of Susquehanna Township, Pa.; Janis Ruth Coulter, 36,
an assistant director of graduate studies for the university's

<HD>Abductor Killed by Shot in Head, Officials Say</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Rosamond man who kidnapped two teenage girls from a lover's lane
area overlooking Quartz Hill and raped them died of a gunshot wound
to the head, Kern County officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   A preliminary investigation into the death of Roy Dean Ratliff
indicates that the 37-year-old man was killed by a bullet that struck
his left cheek, Kern County Chief Deputy Coroner Jim Malouf and
sheriff's Det. Cmdr. Marty Williamson said.</LD>
<LD>   Ratliff, whose criminal record began at age 7, was hit by two
other bullets, one in the upper chest and one in the head. He also
had cuts on his throat and bruises on his head, Williamson said.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said that 17 shots were fired in the exchange between
Ratliff and Kern County sheriff's deputies and that a full review of
the shooting is to be released later this week. The coroner's final
report will take several weeks to complete, pending the results of
autopsy and toxicology reports.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Ratliff's injuries appeared to be consistent with accounts
by the victims, who said in televised interviews that they fought
with their attacker, hitting him with a whiskey bottle and cutting
him with a bowie knife.</TE>
<TE>   The girls were rescued later by sheriff's deputies, ending a
12-hour ordeal that began with their predawn kidnapping Thursday from
separate cars parked at a local overlook known as Quartz Hill
Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   The abductions set in motion a massive manhunt involving at least
half a dozen law enforcement agencies and the first statewide use of
the "Amber alert" system, which posts kidnapping information on
electronic freeway signs as well as on radio and television.</TE>

<HD>Billboard Fight May Change State Landscape</HD>
<DH>Lynwood: After years of political battle, Senate panel will
consider giving cities control over where to put signs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED ROHRLICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Kudler first looked at the Century Freeway viaduct a decade ago
and didn't see concrete. He saw gold.</LD>
<LD>   To the billboard entrepreneur, each passing car, each pair of eyes
was worth money--$15 million total, he figured.</LD>
<LD>   Once Kudler went to work, he wasn't the only one who saw a chance
to get rich.</LD>
<TE>   A billboard lobbyist asked Kudler for $1 million to help get
approval from the city of Lynwood. A competitor promised the city as
much as $4 million. The mayor's sister got in line for up to $1
million.</TE>
<TE>   Kudler's vision triggered a volatile mix of big money and
small-town politics that has raised questions of corruption and
influenced local elections.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Lynwood's billboard war threatens to spill past the borders
of this working-class city in south Los Angeles County and
dramatically change much of the remaining advertising-free landscape
of California.</TE>
<TE>   A lobbyist in the Lynwood fight, caught in the continuing
stalemate, has taken on the state law that bars billboards from the
80% of California freeways bordered by landscaped greenery.</TE>
<TE>   Today, a state Senate committee will consider a proposal that
gives local governments, not the state, primary control over where
billboards can be built.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed legislation might solve Lynwood's troubles, but not
Kudler's.</TE>
<TE>   Kudler, the scion of a family firm that built billboards for
others, wanted to make his mark in Lynwood by building them for
himself.</TE>
<TE>   He figured that a significant gap in landscaping along the Century
Freeway's viaduct, which towers several stories over the nearest
blade of grass, made it an exception to the state's prohibition.</TE>
<TE>   He began signing long-term leases with private property owners
whose land bordered the viaduct. Then he asked Caltrans for state
permits to build what would be the largest cluster of billboards on
the freeway, which extends from Norwalk to Los Angeles International
Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans refused permission, and Kudler spent years and $300,000
fighting the state agency in court, eventually winning approval for
his family's firm, Bulletin Displays.</TE>
<TE>   He stood to make $15 million in advertising revenue over the life
of the signs, which base rents on the number of people who drive by
and their estimated buying power.</TE>
<TE>   While Kudler was still fighting in court, he began seeking
building permits he needed from the city.</TE>
<TE>   He reached out to Paul Richards, Lynwood's mayor at the time and
the city's most influential officeholder.</TE>
<TE>   But Richards was a busy man. By 1997, Kudler had spent a year
trying to get a meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a friend suggested that Kudler contact a billboard
industry lobbyist who knew Richards. Ken Spiker Jr.'s own family firm
had long been involved with the Independent Cities Assn., where
Richards had served as president.</TE>
<TE>   Spiker got Kudler the meeting, and then offered his services in
exchange for 7% of billboard revenue. Kudler figured that would come
to about $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Kudler's father, Robert, opened Spiker's letter and scrawled on
the envelope, "Mark, who are these guys and what the [expletive] are
they talking about re 7%?"</TE>
<TE>   Kudler said his father told him it was a shakedown.</TE>
<TE>   Spiker said he customarily asked for a percentage. Both he and
Richards deny any improprieties.</TE>
<TE>   But the Kudlers, who pride themselves as fighters, declared war.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   They tried to fight City Hall by changing it.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997 and again in 1999, they backed opponents of Richards and
Richards' council allies but lost both times.</TE>
<TE>   Kudler, of Buena Park, then faced the challenge of trying to win
city permits from a council controlled by Richards, who describes
Kudler as "mean and wicked."</TE>
<TE>   Kudler didn't give up. He contacted Richards' nephew and asked him
to engage in some back-channel diplomacy. He said the nephew, Julio
Naulls, told him he could get the needed city permits for $25,000 in
cash.</TE>
<TE>   Kudler said he refused to pay, figuring the $25,000 was "the tip
of the iceberg."</TE>
<TE>   Kudler's account was verified by Enrique Vela, a political
consultant who said he accompanied Kudler to a meeting with Naulls.</TE>
<TE>   Naulls, who described himself as a political consultant in Lynwood
and neighboring Compton, denied Kudler's account, saying, "The matter
of compensation never came up."</TE>
<TE>   Richards said he knew nothing of Naulls' alleged solicitation and
that Naulls was not representing him.</TE>
<TE>   Richards said he was not on speaking terms with Naulls at the
time. Voter registration records show that Naulls was then living at
Richards' house.</TE>
<TE>   Naulls was one of five of Richards' siblings and nephews who gave
Richards' address as their own to voter registration officials,
records show.</TE>
<TE>   Richards said none of them actually lived with him and offered a
series of explanations.</TE>
<TE>   He said, for example, he believed his father, now deceased,
encouraged relatives to declare Richards' house as their permanent
residence as a symbolic way of holding the family together.</TE>
<TE>   After Kudler rejected Spiker's offer, the Los Angeles-based
lobbyist found another client, Regency Outdoor Advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Kudler was offering the city relatively meager benefits: a program
to tear down some existing billboards, discounted advertising for
local businesses, $60,000 to repair aging storefront signs, and one
unusual palliative, financing for a "museum of slavery."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Richards dated Feb. 1, 2001, Spiker presented
Regency's much more generous offer. The four-page proposal called for
Regency to pay the city $2.4 million for six signs around the viaduct
and an amount to be negotiated for 12 signs elsewhere along the
freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, Richards voted to name his sister, Paula Harris,
the city's exclusive negotiator on the deal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Richards voted to put Harris in charge of negotiations that would
earn her 20% of whatever the city collected. Because the final deal
called for the city to get $4 million, it meant up to a $1-million
fee for her.</TE>
<TE>   Richards voted even though he said he wasn't exactly sure what his
sister did for a living. Richards said he knew only that she has been
"in banking and other related businesses for 30 years."</TE>
<TE>   Harris said she is a manager in Bank of America's legal department
and has been an employee for 35 years. She declined to answer other
questions, referring inquiries to her lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   What Harris did to earn a fee is also a matter of dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The letter Regency originally sent to Richards proposed many of
the same terms that appeared in the nearly $5-million agreement later
hammered out under his sister's auspices.</TE>
<TE>   The city also employed an attorney to negotiate contract language
with representatives of the billboard company.</TE>
<TE>   Harris, through her attorney, Rickey Ivie, defended her work,
saying she earned her commission in arduous talks that he led.
Richards also defended the arrangement, noting that his sister would
be paid only if the billboard company and the city made a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Richards, an attorney, also said there was no need for him to
disqualify himself from a vote that could make his sister rich.</TE>
<TE>   State conflict-of-interest law prohibits a public official from
taking actions that would enrich himself or a member of his immediate
family, which is defined as a spouse and children. Adult siblings
don't count.</TE>
<TE>   Harris, too, was registered to vote at Richards' address.</TE>
<TE>   She got the contract as Allied Government Services, a sole
proprietorship.</TE>
<TE>   Her nephew, Julio Naulls, who had allegedly asked Kudler for
$25,000 to get city permits, wrote Lynwood on his aunt's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Identifying himself as Allied's vice president of government
affairs, Naulls suggested that the city hire Allied on a contingency
basis both to negotiate fees for new billboards and to collect fees
from billboard scofflaws. In both cases, Allied would get a
commission equal to 20% of whatever the city got.</TE>
<TE>   Harris was already making money in Lynwood.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council required a local bus operator to pay her $90,000
a year for "supplemental services" as a condition of getting its
contract renewed.</TE>
<TE>   Seven months later, the operator complained that Harris had not
done any work.</TE>
<TE>   Despite trouble with the bus contract, Naulls' letter got a quick
response. Within days, the request was placed on the agenda for a
special council meeting and approved.</TE>
<TE>   Only one council member, Arturo Reyes, a Richards rival, had a
question.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes asked how much the city could expect to make from the deal.
He got no answer, but voted for the proposal anyway, along with
Richards and two of Richards' allies, figuring that, because the
arrangement called for payment only if the firm brought in a new deal
or collected old debts, the city could lose nothing. Reyes said he
cast his vote not knowing Harris was Richards' sister.</TE>
<TE>   Harris signed a contract with the city on behalf of her company.
She retained Ivie to negotiate with Spiker, the lobbyist who
represented Regency.</TE>
<TE>   The details of Regency's deal called for it to pay for the use of
city-owned land, alongside, on and over city streets as billboard
sites.</TE>
<TE>   California law prohibits use of city streets and is murky about
allowing billboards to hang over them.</TE>
<TE>   But the legislation pending in Sacramento sponsored by Spiker and
other billboard interests would solve that problem.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, with the Regency negotiations well underway and
Richards running for reelection, Kudler expanded his offensive
against Richards, who has been a member of the Lynwood City Council
for 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   Kudler filed a racketeering lawsuit against Richards, Spiker,
Harris and Naulls in federal court. He alleged without proof that
Allied had been created as a vehicle to funnel hundreds of thousands
of dollars in bribes to Richards through his sister. He later dropped
the case.</TE>
<TE>   Those named in the suit denied Kudler's charges. They said that
the day after the lawsuit was filed, its allegations began appearing
in pamphlets funded by Kudler, aimed at defeating Richards and his
council allies.</TE>
<TE>   Because the charges had first been made in a lawsuit and were only
being repeated in the pamphlets, it was difficult for Richards and
the others to sue for defamation.</TE>
<TE>   Richards retained his seat, but another member of his council
majority lost, shifting the balance of power.</TE>
<TE>   Before the new council took office, Richards and his allies
completed the billboard deal with Regency.</TE>
<TE>   But as soon as the new council majority took over, they rescinded
Regency's and Allied's contracts, and voted to restart negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Bulletin Displays sought to match Regency's offer.
Kudler said he is now offering to pay the city between $4 million and
$5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "But the money will end up going to the treasury rather than to
somebody's sister," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Regency has threatened to sue the city.</TE>
<TE>   Harris has filed a claim against the city for $2 million--the
nearly $1 million she said she is entitled to as commission for the
Regency deal and another $1 million she anticipated would have come
from negotiating future billboard deals.</TE>
<TE>   Harris' lawyer, Ivie, said he is perplexed. He said he does not
understand how the new council could rescind a deal in which Regency
would pay nearly $5 million to a struggling city with an annual
budget of about $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The heck with one of the representative's sisters being
involved," Ivie said. "Why turn down $4 million? Does that smack of
something insane?"</TE>
<TE>   Pointing to Kudler's campaign contributions, he said successful
candidates for public office are often "sensitive to their backers."</TE>
<TE>   He suggested politics might be at work.</TE>
<TE>   Spiker, too, saw a political opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, he drafted a bill that would give cash-starved
cities greater leeway to follow the profit-sharing model he tried to
set up in Lynwood.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, carried by state Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long
Beach), would give cities financial incentive to approve signs
visible from hundreds of miles of landscaped freeways, where they are
now banned.</TE>
<TE>   Spiker said he already has deals lined up with 25 cities and
school boards.</TE>

<LD>Garden Grove police are asking for the public's help in finding a
woman with Alzheimer's disease who has been missing for more than a
week.</LD>
<LD>   Ba Thi Tran, 65, took a stroll on July 29 and has not been seen
since, police said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "She has nothing on that identifies herself," said Elaine Jordan,
an investigator for the Garden Grove Police Department. "Sometimes
she's lucid enough to identify herself and sometimes she can't."</LD>
<TE>   Tran wandered off from the apartment she shares with her husband.
She was without her medication, dentures, purse or identification
bracelet. Among other things, police and relatives said, she has no
means of transportation, credit cards or cellular phone.</TE>
<TE>   Tran, who is Vietnamese and speaks no English, was last seen about
10 a.m. July 29 wearing a white blouse and pants suit with a white
hat. She is 5 feet, 2 inches, walks with a slight hunch, has short,
graying black hair and dark eyes, and may be carrying less than $10,
relatives say.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information on Tran's whereabouts is asked to call
Jordan at (714) 741-5815.</TE>

<LD>Garden Grove police are asking for the public's help in finding a
woman with Alzheimer's disease who has been missing for more than a
week.</LD>
<LD>   Ba Thi Tran, 65, took a stroll on July 29 and has not been seen
since, police said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "She has nothing on that identifies herself," said Elaine Jordan,
an investigator for the Garden Grove Police Department. "Sometimes
she's lucid enough to identify herself and sometimes she can't."</LD>
<TE>   Tran wandered off from the apartment she shares with her husband.
She was without her medication, dentures, purse or identification
bracelet. Among other things, police and relatives said, she has no
means of transportation, bank account, credit cards or cellular
phone.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless Tran calls attention to herself or someone recognizes her
from her photo," Jordan said, "no one is going to know that she needs
help."</TE>
<TE>   According to the Alzheimer's Assn., 59% of Alzheimer's patients
may wander off and become lost at some point during the course of
their disease. Of those, the association says, 46% die from
hyperthermia or dehydration if not found in 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Tran, who is Vietnamese and speaks no English, was last seen about
10 a.m. July 29 wearing a white blouse and pants suit with a white
hat. She is 5 feet, 2 inches, walks with a slight hunch, has short,
graying black hair, dark eyes and may be carrying less than $10,
relatives say.</TE>
<TE>   She is known to frequent the Asian Garden Mall and shopping
centers nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Family members believe that Tran could be in the Long Beach or
Huntington Beach areas.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish to find her again soon," said daughter Holly Phan, 28, who
flew in from Fort Wayne, Ind., to help in the search. "We're so
worried about her--we don't know if she's safe or not."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information on Tran's whereabouts is asked to call
Jordan at (714) 741-5815.</TE>

<HD>Subway Contractor to Get $12.5 Million From MTA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has reached an agreement to
pay $12.5 million in past-due subway construction claims to
beleaguered contracting giant Tutor-Saliba--a firm found guilty last
year of engaging in a complex scheme to defraud the transit agency.</LD>
<LD>   According to the agreement, Sylmar-based Tutor-Saliba Corp.--whose
chief executive is a major donor to Mayor and MTA board member James
K. Hahn--will receive payment for outstanding claims related to the
building of tunnels and four subway stops on the 17-mile Red Line's
extension to the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The MTA board signed off on the settlement, avoiding litigation,
in a closed meeting last month without public comment.</LD>
<TE>   The MTA had refused to pay for much of the construction, arguing
that Tutor-Saliba was unfairly charging for its work.</TE>
<TE>   In July 2001, in a dispute that sprang from charges Tutor-Saliba
had mishandled other portions of Red Line construction, a Superior
Court judge found the contractor guilty of fraud, including using
minority businesses as fronts, more than 1,000 instances of unfair
business practices and submitting false claims.</TE>
<TE>   The construction giant, one of the largest public works
contractors in the nation, was forced to pay the MTA $29.5 million.
In March, the judge added to the fine by ordering Tutor-Saliba to pay
nearly $22 million in legal fees. The company is appealing.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its success in the lawsuit, the MTA chose not to pursue
more litigation with Tutor-Saliba over the Red Line work that
included the four subway stops.</TE>
<TE>   "The board felt that periodically you have to try these cases just
to show contractors you can't get away with overreaching. That's what
we did with the case that we won," said MTA chief legal counsel Steve
Carnevale. "But in this second case, we felt it was appropriate to
negotiate a payment both sides could agree upon."</TE>
<TE>   Carnevale said that at one point Tutor-Saliba was asking for more
than $40 million for the claims.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Tutor-Saliba President Ronald Tutor nor his lawyers
returned repeated phone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Carnevale said the MTA came to the conclusion it would be best to
settle the matter rather than pursue more litigation. The MTA became
convinced that Tutor-Saliba was rightfully owed a good chunk of what
it was asking for, he said. And after negotiations whittled the
difference disputed to a matter of a few million dollars, "the risks
and costs associated with a lawsuit" would not have been worthwhile,
Carnevale said.</TE>
<TE>   On July 17, MTA Chief Executive Roger Snoble and Tutor met in the
MTA chief's 25th-floor office downtown and agreed on the final
details of the settlement. Days later, the MTA board voted 11 to 0 in
the closed session to support Snoble's recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   Absent for that vote were City Councilman Hal Bernson, who is MTA
chairman, and Hahn. Both board members were forced to recuse
themselves because Tutor has contributed to them, most notably to the
mayor. Tutor gave $75,000 to Hahn during his mayoral bid, in addition
to $39,000 in contributions from employees and their spouses. Tutor
also recently gave $50,000 to the mayor's anti-secession drive.</TE>
<TE>   Tutor-Saliba was the subway's biggest contractor, with the MTA
paying nearly $945 million for work on the underground line. Some of
that work came under scrutiny for its quality, particularly after The
Times reported that some of the walls built by the contractor were
thinner than required.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A former federal narcotics agent pleaded guilty Monday to bribery and
other felony charges stemming from his sale of sensitive law
enforcement information to a private investigative agency.</LD>
<LD>   Emilio Calatayud, a 12-year veteran of the Drug Enforcement
Administration based in Los Angeles, was arrested in Mexico in June.
He had been on the run since February, when he fled the country to
avoid going to trial.</LD>
<LD>   Calatayud, 35, entered guilty pleas to five counts of bribery,
failing to appear for trial and tax evasion before U.S. District
Court Judge William J. Rea in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Calatayud faces a statutory maximum of 34 years in prison, but the
actual term is likely to be much less when federal sentencing
guidelines are applied. Sentencing is set for Nov. 18.</TE>
<TE>   In his plea agreement with prosecutors, Calatayud admitted having
sold criminal history and other confidential information over six
years to Triple Check Investigations of San Dimas. Triple Check was
not indicted.</TE>
<TE>   The stolen data came from three computer systems to which he had
access: the FBI's National Crime Information Center, the California
Law Enforcement Telecommunications System and the Narcotics and
Dangerous Drug Information System of the Drug Enforcement
Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The data bases contain information about millions of individuals
and businesses, ranging from arrest histories and warrants to motor
vehicle records.</TE>
<TE>   Calatayud charged Triple Check $60 to $80 per request. He admitted
having pocketed $22,580 for his services.</TE>
<TE>   Calatayud had faced 14 criminal charges. In exchange for his
guilty plea to five counts, prosecutors agreed to drop the other
nine.</TE>

<LD>Two men and a 17-year-old boy were arrested late Sunday on suspicion
of forcing a woman out of her car in Costa Mesa, then leading police
on a chase that ended after the vehicle crashed.</LD>
<LD>   Alejandro Ortiz, 20, and Alejandro Arellano, 22, both of Santa
Ana, were being held without bail at Costa Mesa City Jail. The
teenager, whose name was not released because of his age, was taken
to Orange County Juvenile Hall.</LD>
<LD>   The incident began about 9:30 p.m. Sunday when the three allegedly
approached a car parked in a lot in the 100 block of East 17th
Street, forced the 50-year-old woman inside to get out, knocked her
to the ground, got into the car and fled.</LD>
<TE>   Police spotted the stolen car in Fountain Valley. A short pursuit
ended when the car crashed into a parked car and the three occupants
fled on foot. All three suspects were arrested within 2 1/2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   The owner of the stolen car suffered minor cuts and bruises to her
hands and knees, said Lt. Dale Birney, a spokesman for the Costa Mesa
Police Department.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Where is Jonathan?</LD>
<LD>   He is 12 years old now, a boy with a faltering body and a soaring
mind. One morning in June, he just didn't show up at his Glendale
elementary school, and is now somewhere among the other 49,999 or so
children in the child welfare system of Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   Legally, I can't even print his last name, a Spanish surname, even
though he signed it on a letter to me. The Department of Children and
Family Services may not be able to tell you the whereabouts of every
single child in its care, but you can bet it can find a lawyer fast
if someone violates the sanctity of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   Someone at Jonathan's school found the letter in the boy's desk
after he disappeared. He mentioned me in a school assignment, too,
and both were passed along to me.</TE>
<TE>   Let me tell you first what little I know of Jonathan, which is
through Donald Galleher, a volunteer who read to special-ed kids at
the school every Thursday, and who speaks of the boy in the past
tense, as if he had vanished from life, which in a way he has, at
least from the life he knew.</TE>
<TE>   Galleher met Jonathan three years ago, when the boy was 9.
Jonathan, who has muscular dystrophy, at the time lived with his
father and his father's girlfriend in an upper-floor apartment, which
meant he had to be carried up and down to his wheelchair every day.
He hadn't always been in a wheelchair; at 9, he had a cane. By 10 or
11, he was on crutches, and at last in a wheelchair, in which he
sometimes spun wheelies on the playground at recess.</TE>
<TE>   When Galleher met Jonathan, the boy was just beginning to master
reading and writing. In three years, he had burst out of the gate and
passed the competition. As Galleher says, "I just watched this boy
blossom."</TE>
<TE>   That's how I come into this. Jonathan adored reading and watching
PBS, including a program I do about books and authors. Here is the
penciled letter he addressed to me on June 7, on school writing
paper:</TE>
<TE>   "Dear Pat Morrison How are you? I'm doing fine. This is your name
in Greek [and this 12-year-old boy rendered my name in the Greek
alphabet]. I saw you on TV for the first time on Sunday, April 21,
2002.... What does the book 'Three Apples Fell From Heaven' [a book
discussed on the program] is about? ... What are novels?"</TE>
<TE>   A month earlier, Jonathan, the PBS fan, was writing an assignment
about whom he would take to dinner if he could. He named Charlie
Rose, Bill Moyers, Roger Mudd, painting-show host Donna Dewberry and
me. "We would eat at the malt shop. We will eat 3 sandwiches. We
would drink chocolate milk shakes."</TE>
<TE>   And then, from one school day to the next, he was gone. His social
worker hasn't returned my call. Folks at the school are legally leery
of talking about him, as if he were one of those people who suddenly
gets snipped out of the group photo on the Kremlin balcony. And all I
want to do is buy him those milkshakes.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. County does foster care the way it does just about everything
else--big and messy. In its broad child-welfare reach are about
50,000 children. One law of foster care is, nothing is forever. In 10
years, one girl moved 36 times. You can't do that to a shrub and
expect it to thrive--why should it be any better for a child?</TE>
<TE>   It's a city-sized population of children who got a raw deal from
the first adults in their lives--addict mothers, felon fathers,
grown-ups who beat them up or molested them or neglected them. That's
how they came into an overloaded system that, like some of the
families they were born into, has too many kids for the money and the
people and the time available to care for them properly.</TE>
<TE>   Some foster parents, and some foster care workers, manage to do it
right, in spite of the odds. But L.A. County has to improve those
odds. Having been beaten up plenty by the lawsuit stick, maybe the
county will at last rethink its job as the third parent to 50,000
kids.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, a 15-year-old named Katie Goldsmith read a story
about a girl her own age, trekking from foster home to foster home
with all her possessions slung over her shoulder in a flimsy plastic
trash bag.</TE>
<TE>   To Katie, growing up on the Westside with a large, sturdy family,
that was the ultimate insult. She couldn't give them families, but
she could give them a little dignity, and two years later, her
nonprofit, a Case for Kids, is still collecting duffel bags and
backpacks so these young nomads at least can get pinballed around
with their possessions intact.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Jonathan has one of her duffels on his lap, packed with his
beloved books.</TE>
<TE>   Should anyone know where Jonathan is, give him my best. And tell
him that novels are books of make-believe that sometimes tell stories
about the way things might happen, in worlds where every child has a
home, and every adult is as kind as every child wishes him to be.</TE>

<HD>Suit Filed to Block Auto Mall</HD>
<DH>Courts: Environmental groups target city of Santa Clarita
for approving project they say endangers wildlife.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two environmental groups have sued the city of Santa Clarita over a
plan to build an auto mall near a bank of the Santa Clara River,
saying that the project would harm endangered wildlife and increase
pollution.</LD>
<LD>   The suit filed on Friday by the Center for Biological Diversity
and the Santa Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment
contends that the plan violates the California Environmental Quality
Act.</LD>
<LD>   The two nonprofit groups allege that the city did not consider the
impact of the auto mall on the endangered arroyo toad, which has been
found in the river.</LD>
<TE>   The groups also allege that Santa Clarita failed to consider
possible contamination of dirt being brought to the site.</TE>
<TE>   The suit was filed in Ventura County Superior Court because the
river flows into that county, said Peter Galvin, spokesman for the
center.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clarita spokeswoman Gail Ortiz said on Monday that the city
has complied with all environmental laws.</TE>
<TE>   The auto mall plan, a project of the powerful Newhall Land &amp;
Farming Co., also calls for improvements to sports fields used by the
William S. Hart Boys and Girls Baseball / Softball League, pitting
environmentalists against some league parents.</TE>

<HD>Hahn's Anti-Secession Actions Challenged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Proponents of San Fernando Valley secession on Monday asked two
watchdog agencies to determine whether Los Angeles Mayor James K.
Hahn broke the law by using city resources to fight their movement.</LD>
<LD>   In letters to the California Fair Political Practices Commission
and the Los Angeles Ethics Commission, the secessionists said that
the mayor had used city employees and equipment to campaign against
independence for both the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood. The
letters, dated Aug. 3, said the mayor's actions violated a state law
prohibiting elected officials from using public funds to fight ballot
measures.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn's office admitted that it had used city resources to send out
news releases and lobby against secession, but said it stopped doing
so last month, after the civic breakup measures were approved for
placement on the Nov. 5 ballot. A mayor's spokeswoman said Hahn did
nothing improper.</LD>
<TE>   The two commissions did not comment on the secessionists' letters,
which were signed by representatives of the San Fernando Valley
Independence Committee and the United Chambers of Commerce of the San
Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood secession campaign has also asked the commissions to
investigate Hahn's actions. The panels can impose fines for
violations of the ethics statutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley separatists' complaint against the mayor came as they
sought to step up their campaign after weeks of perceived missteps
and lagging financial support.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders said professional political consultants will now
run the campaign's day-to-day operations, taking over from a group of
mostly amateur activists.</TE>
<TE>   Gerry Gunster, a campaign director for the Sacramento-based
consulting firm Goddard Claussen Porter Novelli, will run the Valley
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Gunster replaces Jeff Brain at the helm of the campaign, although
Brain will remain president of the Valley VOTE secession group. The
Valley VOTE office in Sherman Oaks will be renamed for the campaign
organization, the San Fernando Valley Independence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Gunster said that he plans to hire three campaign workers and will
develop a strategy for a grass-roots effort in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "The feeling on the [Valley VOTE] board was that they've hired a
professional firm to run a campaign, and it's time to let the
professionals run it," said Gunster.</TE>
<TE>   The move was welcomed by secession supporters. "It's at the point
now where we need the pros," said Richard Leyner, a Valley VOTE board
member and candidate for city council in the proposed city.</TE>
<TE>   Brain said the change was his idea, and it would free him to do
more public speaking and fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Steinberg, a Valley-based political strategist who advised
early secession supporters but is not involved in the campaign, said
the consultants appeared to be blaming Brain for the campaign's
stumbles, which he said was unfair. The campaign has been faulted for
being unaggressive, slow to organize, and short on fund-raising
skills.</TE>
<TE>   "This firm [Goddard Claussen Porter Novelli] has been on board for
months, and now they're blaming Jeff," he said. "This is an effort
which never consolidated its own base in the San Fernando Valley."</TE>
<TE>   The consultants' touch was evident at the news conference on
Monday to announce the complaints against Hahn: It was held in a
symbolic location, on the steps of the building in Van Nuys that
could be the new municipality's city hall if secession passes.
Participants were flanked by giant copies of anti-secession e-mail
news releases sent by the mayor's office, offered as proof that Hahn
had misused city resources.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Hahn said the use of city resources to
distribute anti-secession news releases was legal because the
cityhood proposals did not become ballot initiatives until late July,
when laws barring such activity first applied to the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted on July 25 to
place Valley secession on the ballot, and the Local Agency Formation
Commission did the same with Hollywood secession on July 26.</TE>
<TE>   Since July 25, Hahn spokeswoman Julie Wong said, the mayor's staff
has not issued anti-secession news releases or held events that could
be construed as part of Hahn's anti-breakup campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Kaufman, a Los Angeles attorney specializing in election
law, said the prohibitions against using public resources to fight
ballot measures would not apply before the July 25 Board of
Supervisors' action.</TE>
<TE>   "Before this became an actual ballot measure, it was simply a city
issue," Kaufman said. "The mayor's office had the right and the
ability to communicate from the mayor's office to the public on this
issue."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Is Least Diverse Area in State, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Census: Rapid growth of immigrants, economic patterns cited
for most voluntary segregation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Californians are more likely to live among people of different races
than they were in 1990, but the Los Angeles area stands out as the
most segregated part of the state, according to an analysis of census
data.</LD>
<LD>   The percentage of California residents living in largely
segregated neighborhoods dropped by almost half from 1990 to 2000,
while the percentage of those in racially mixed areas more than
doubled, according to the study by the Public Policy Institute of
California, a San Francisco-based nonprofit research group.</LD>
<LD>   The report said rapid Latino population growth pushed many heavily
Latino cities and neighborhoods in Greater Los Angeles into the
category of "segregated," which it defined as one ethnic or racial
group forming the overwhelming majority of residents in an area. An
example would be South Gate, which, at 92% Latino, was ranked as the
third most segregated community in the state.</LD>
<TE>   The report, to be released Wednesday, does not employ the
traditional definition of segregation, in which laws and racism kept
people separated. The segregation it describes appears to be more the
result of immigration and economic patterns.</TE>
<TE>   "The nature of segregation, how and why it occurs, is very
different," said Hans P. Johnson of the Public Policy Institute, one
of the study's authors.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, 56% of the segregated neighborhoods in Los Angeles County
were primarily white, according to the report. By 2000, 70% of the
segregated neighborhoods were Latino.</TE>
<TE>   During that period, however, the number of segregated
neighborhoods in Los Angeles County declined. In 1990, 35% of Los
Angeles neighborhoods were segregated, but by 2000 the percentage
dropped to 26% of neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Latino immigration contributed to the overall drop in segregation
as well as the creation of newly segregated neighborhoods. In cities
such as Bellflower, neighborhoods that once had a white majority
became more diverse as their Latino populations increased.</TE>
<TE>   James P. Allen, a Cal State Northridge professor who studies the
ethnic makeup of Los Angeles, said "segregation" is no longer an
appropriate term to describe such population changes. "Segregation
implies a rigid Jim Crow system separating blacks and whites," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Those who can afford to "are relatively free to leave those ethnic
enclaves. It's mostly voluntary and nothing pernicious," Allen said
of the growth in Latino communities. Thus Allen said he uses the term
"separation" rather than segregation to describe the Los Angeles
communities that have become less diverse.</TE>
<TE>   Housing discrimination may be a lingering problem in the Los
Angeles area, Allen said, but the growth of Latino cities and
neighborhoods is due mainly to immigration. "A large number of
immigrants is coming in, and they tend to prefer to live near some
friend or relative," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Public Policy Institute study found seven of California's
least diverse cities in Los Angeles County, all in the east and
southeast portions of the county, which have long been a destination
for Latinos. (Two other primarily white Southern California cities,
Newport Beach and Encinitas, also made the list.)</TE>
<TE>   The most diverse cities in California tend to be suburban areas,
many in the San Francisco Bay Area. Diverse cities "tend to be
fast-growing cities with plenty of new and relatively affordable
housing," the study noted. It added that "many of these integrated
cities are the same places that are cited as examples of urban
sprawl."</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, San Bernardino County has the greatest
proportion of diverse neighborhoods. Long Beach, Buena Park and
Lakewood, along with Bellflower, also were identified as the most
diverse communities.</TE>
<TE>   The changes identified in the report are now obvious on the
streets of Southern California, where long-held assumptions about
segregation and integration were upset in the last two decades.
Polyglot inner-city areas became Latino immigrant enclaves, while
predominantly white suburbs became burgeoning multiracial boom towns.</TE>
<TE>   Remnants of a diverse past linger in and around East Los Angeles,
an unincorporated community identified in the study as the most
segregated community in California.</TE>
<TE>   Although it has always been a cornerstone of Mexican American
culture, East Los Angeles had for much of the 20th century been home
to thriving Jewish, Russian, Central European and Japanese American
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The handful of businesses that remain from those vanishing
communities are on their last legs.</TE>
<TE>   On 1st Street in Boyle Heights, the Otomi-san restaurant is the
last Japanese eatery in the area. The 50-year-old lunch spot, with
five stools at a counter and three booths, was empty at noon on a
recent Friday. Hand-lettered signs on the walls in Japanese still
highlight specials such as ginger pork and mackerel, but the tables
hold shakers of pico de gallo and chile con limon. "Most of my
customers are Latino now," owner Akira Seino said.</TE>
<TE>   Don T. Nakanishi, director of UCLA's Asian American Studies
Center, said East Los Angeles' transformation shows the effects of
integration and segregation. Nakanishi was born in a Japanese
American hospital in Boyle Heights, and lived in the area until he
graduated from Roosevelt High School and headed for Yale University
in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   As race-based housing restrictions eased and families that could
afford to moved out, Nakanishi said, East Los Angeles became more of
a starting point for recent immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Nakanishi recalls his childhood neighborhood being relatively more
prosperous and racially mixed, with Jews, Latinos, Asian Americans
and African Americans living near each other. But he attributes the
difference partly to other areas being off-limits.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything across the Los Angeles River was the Westside. When I
was in high school, Monterey Park and Montebello were just barely
integrated. You couldn't think of moving there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Montebello is three-quarters Latino and the 10th most
segregated city in the state, according to the Public Policy
Institute report.</TE>

<LD>A Los Angeles man pleaded no contest on Monday to stealing a 1953
National League championship ring given to the late baseball legend
Jackie Robinson.</LD>
<LD>   Miguel Rodriguez, 21, was sentenced by Los Angeles Superior Court
Judge Rand S. Robin to three months in County Jail after admitting to
receiving stolen property and to grand theft.</LD>
<LD>   The ring, valued at $12,000, was taken from a Robinson relative
last year. Rodriguez was arrested in April after selling the ring for
$100 to a pawnbroker on Western Avenue in Los Angeles. The pawnbroker
recognized the ring and called police.</LD>

<HD>Smokers May Sue for Fraud, Justices Rule</HD>
<DH>Tobacco: By ensuring that a range of internal industry
documents can be used, the state high court opens the door to many
new lawsuits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN and MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Diseased smokers in California may sue tobacco companies for fraud
and negligence, relying on evidence of misconduct for all but a
10-year period when cigarette makers were protected from lawsuits,
the California Supreme Court ruled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The court's action paves the way for many new lawsuits against the
industry and potential multimillion-dollar awards for victims.
Evidence that the industry may have altered tobacco with additives to
make it more addictive will be admissible regardless of the
industry's past protection from lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   Roughly 65 anti-tobacco lawsuits are pending in California. The
state high court's rulings in two cases Monday ensure that the
smokers and their heirs in these suits will be able to use a wide
range of internal tobacco industry documents from before 1988 that
have been deployed with devastating results so far in California.</LD>
<TE>   But the state high court also gave some relief to cigarette
makers. The court held that most evidence of the industry's conduct
from 1988 to 1998, when the state's legislative protections for
tobacco companies were in place, cannot be presented to a jury. The
tobacco immunity law was repealed in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling has been long anticipated because three consecutive
large awards against cigarette makers have put California in the
forefront of the legal war over smoking. The threat from lawsuits by
individual California smokers is considered one of the greatest legal
problems facing the tobacco industry, along with a racketeering suit
by the U.S. Justice Department and a $144.8-billion verdict in a
Florida class-action lawsuit that is under appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel U. Smith, who represented smokers in the two cases decided
Monday, called the rulings "a major victory for smoking victims in
California." He said smokers will prevail at trial without evidence
of the industry's conduct from 1988 to 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "The mountain of evidence in these cases is from the '50s and the
'60s," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   The tobacco industry predicted that Monday's rulings will lead to
new trials in three cases in which California courts have awarded
smokers $153 million in verdicts against manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   Charles A. Blixt, general counsel for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
called the rulings "a victory for fundamental fairness," because they
did not hold the industry responsible for actions taken during the 10
years of immunity.</TE>
<TE>   On a down day on Wall Street, tobacco stocks were up. Shares of
Philip Morris Cos., the top cigarette maker, rose $2.29 to $47.50;
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco gained $1.54 to $56.14. The favorable market
reaction appears to have been based on expectations that the
decisions would be even worse for the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's rulings came in two cases brought by smokers who died of
lung cancer. Both cases had been dismissed by trial courts on the
grounds that the 1988 immunity law barred such litigation.</TE>
<TE>   The California Supreme Court revived the lawsuits and rejected
industry claims that the immunity law also protected the industry for
the years before 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "With respect to conduct falling outside the 10-year immunity
period, the tobacco companies are not shielded from product liability
lawsuits," wrote Justice Joyce Kennard in Myers vs. Philip Morris
Cos., S095213.</TE>
<TE>   The court, on the other hand, rejected plaintiffs' claims that the
1998 repeal eliminated the industry's protections for the prior
10-year period.</TE>
<TE>   Betty Jean Myers, the plaintiff, smoked from 1956 until 1997 and
died at the age of 59 from lung cancer. A lawsuit being pressed by
her children was dismissed in federal district court on a motion by
the industry. Her children appealed to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals, which asked the California Supreme Court to clarify how the
decade of tobacco protection affects pending and future lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Carlos Moreno, the sole dissenter in Myers' case, insisted
that the Legislature's repeal of the immunity law in 1998 was
retroactive and wiped out any lingering protection for the tobacco
industry.</TE>
<TE>   The broader tort reform law that gave cigarette makers immunity
has been dubbed the "Napkin Deal." A group of powerful elected
officials, including then-Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and
then-Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer, met with lobbyists from
several industries at Frank Fat's restaurant in Sacramento and
scrawled details of the proposed law on a napkin.</TE>
<TE>   Philip C. Bourdette, who represents Myers' children, predicted
they will eventually prevail. "We are now back in court," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Olson, who represented Philip Morris in the case, said he
also was gratified by the ruling because it will limit the evidence
Myers' family can present. "Clearly this narrowed the scope of the
litigation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a companion case, Naegele vs. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
S090420, the California Supreme Court ruled that the industry is not
completely protected from evidence of its conduct during the 10 years
it enjoyed immunity. If the industry used additives to make smoking
more addictive, that evidence can be presented regardless of time,
the court said.</TE>
<TE>   The Naegele case was brought by Edwin Brigham, who smoked
cigarettes from 1950 until he was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1996.
He sued R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco
Corp. for negligence and fraud. When Brigham died, the suit was
carried on by Joseph Naegele, the trustee for the estate.</TE>
<TE>   A state trial court dismissed his suit, and a Court of Appeal in
San Francisco upheld that decision. The Supreme Court ruled that even
during the 10-year period, immunity was not absolute.</TE>
<TE>   "It does not extend to allegations that tobacco companies, in the
manufacture of cigarettes, used additives that exposed smokers to
dangers beyond those commonly known to be associated with cigarette
smoking," Kennard wrote in the 5-2 decision.</TE>
<TE>   She stressed that the immunity law "does not shield a tobacco
company from liability for injuries or deaths caused by something not
inherent in the product itself." Plaintiffs say some cigarette
manufacturers have added ammonia to tobacco to make cigarettes more
addictive, a charge cigarette makers deny.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar, joined by Moreno, said in a
partial concurrence and dissent that the court should have limited
the impact of the immunity law even further to allow fraud claims
based on high-nicotine tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   Brigham's case will return to the state Court of Appeal, which
must follow the state high court's lead.</TE>
<TE>   H. Joseph Escher III, who represents R. J. Reynolds in the case,
said his client was "very happy" with the results. "They can't say
that tobacco companies are liable for anything they did during those
10 years, except the notion that we adulterated the products to make
them more dangerous," Escher said, "which they will not be able to
prove."</TE>
<TE>   But Madelyn Chaber, who represents Brigham's family, said there is
plenty of evidence against tobacco companies from before 1988.
"Anything that happened in that 1988 to 1998 period is merely a sort
of continuance of past conduct," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers could appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on several
constitutional issues, but none suggested Monday that they were
considering that.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys will use Monday's rulings to argue that three
multimillion-dollar verdicts against the tobacco industry since 1998
should be overturned because juries based their decisions at least in
part on evidence of tobacco company conduct from 1988 to 1998.</TE>
<TE>   For example, plaintiffs introduced a 1994 videotape of tobacco
CEOs testifying under oath before Congress that they did not believe
nicotine was addictive.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiff lawyers say, however, that the overwhelming evidence in
those trials was about the industry's actions from the 1950s to the
1980s, when tobacco companies aggressively disputed evidence of the
harms of smoking.</TE>
<TE>   In March 1999, in the first case tried after the repeal of the
immunity law, a San Francisco jury awarded $51.5 million to lung
cancer sufferer Patricia Henley. The trial judge later trimmed the
award to $26.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, cancer victim Leslie J. Whiteley won $21.7 million
from Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds.</TE>
<TE>   And last June, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury ordered Philip
Morris to pay $5.54 million in compensatory damages and $3 billion in
punitive damages to 57-year-old Richard Boeken, who has since died.
The trial judge trimmed the punitive damages to $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-tobacco lawsuits typically allege that cigarette makers could
have made safer cigarettes, but failed to, manipulated nicotine
delivery systems to sustain the addiction of their customers, and
concealed the hazards and addictiveness of their products.</TE>
<TE>   The three smokers' victories are in various stages of appeal, and
William S. Ohlemeyer, vice president and associate general counsel
for Philip Morris, said Monday's rulings provide fresh ammunition in
seeking reversals.</TE>
<TE>   "We will now review those cases to determine how the court's new
decision affects those appeals--including, for example, what evidence
should have been excluded at trial," Ohlemeyer said.</TE>
<TE>   But Michael Piuze, who represented Richard Boeken, said he did not
believe the verdict will be thrown out as a result of Monday's
rulings, which he called "virtually a total loss" for the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Legal observers said the rulings, by providing a road map for
plaintiffs, are likely to trigger more lawsuits. But they cautioned
that the new claims may be less than a flood.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, they noted, California has a one-year statute of
limitations for most types of personal injury suits. That means that
people diagnosed with smoking-related ailments more than a year ago
are ineligible. People who were recently diagnosed, or suffer
smoking-related diseases in the future, can sue.</TE>
<TE>   And Chaber, who was the lawyer for Henley and Whiteley and also
represented Myers in the appeals, said doing battle with the tobacco
industry is still a daunting prospect for many potential plaintiffs
and their lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   She cited a case in which tobacco defendants have sought the
computer hard drive of a plaintiff "so they can look at every e-mail
they ever sent."</TE>
<TE>   For many potential litigants, "there isn't the time or the energy
or the money to invest in cases that have no chance of settling,"
Chaber said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Strapped for experienced teachers, California is skirting the
nation's new education law by insisting that 50,000 rookies without
full credentials are nonetheless "highly qualified," federal
officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The "No Child Left Behind" law, passed last year, requires
teachers in every state to be "highly qualified"--meaning fully
credentialed--by the end of the 2005-'06 school year. Teachers hired
in this school year on campuses serving low-income children, however,
must already be ''highly qualified."</LD>
<LD>   But the California Board of Education has come up with a
definition of "highly qualified" that includes teaching interns and
novices with emergency permits.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, the U.S. Department of Education said that won't do:
California must staff its schools with teachers fully licensed by the
state.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't define your way out of the problem," said U.S. Rep.
George Miller (D-Martinez), an architect of the federal law who has
called on California to reconsider its policy. "This is about letting
parents know who is standing in front of their children six hours a
day and what their qualifications are."</TE>
<TE>   The fight between Sacramento and Washington is more than a
squabble over semantics.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous studies show that a high-caliber teacher is the single
most important factor in raising student achievement. And the federal
government, which will provide $5.4 billion in education money to
California this year, ultimately could withhold funds if the state
balks at its directive.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the federal requirement poses an enormous practical problem
for a state where experienced teachers are in short supply,
particularly in schools serving low-income and minority children.</TE>
<TE>   If California follows the letter of the federal law, schools in
low-income communities will be unable to hire enough teachers this
fall, state officials said. That could push some class sizes up to
50, 60 or more students, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "If there aren't credentialed teachers in the job pool, you can't
penalize schools and stop kids from getting services," said Suzanne
Tacheny, a member of the State Board of Education. "We've had to take
a realistic look at who [is] available to fill the jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Several of California's leading education groups--including the
California Teachers Assn.--consider the federal demand unrealistic.</TE>
<TE>   "They may as well have decreed that pigs can fly," said CTA
President Wayne Johnson. "I think the State Board of Education is
dealing with reality, not myth. Some of these politicians just have
their heads in the sand."</TE>
<TE>   California's education secretary, Kerry Mazzoni, said teachers
with emergency credentials often are well-prepared for the classroom.
They are required to have bachelor's degrees and pass a basic skills
competency test. Most are enrolled in credentialing programs.</TE>
<TE>   Teaching interns, who have more training, face additional re-
quirements: enrollment in a cre- dentialing program and either
passing an exam in the subjects they teach or completing necessary
coursework to show they are profi- cient.</TE>
<TE>   Becoming credentialed takes one to two years of coursework and
supervised teaching, beyond a bachelor's degree.</TE>
<TE>   Mazzoni described the state's new standard of teacher quality as a
starting point, adding that training requirements will be ratcheted
up until California teachers exceed the federal government's demands.</TE>
<TE>   "[We] will bring them to full credentials over [four] years,"
Mazzoni said.</TE>
<TE>   That will be a tremendous undertaking. Of the state's 350,000
teachers, more than 50,000 do not have full credentials now. The
ranks of those newcomers are expected to grow as retirements and
attrition force the state to find as many as 200,000 new teachers
over the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis and lawmakers have made teacher recruitment and
retention a priority, using recruitment bonuses, loan assistance,
mentoring programs and other incentives to entice people into
teaching. Experts said those efforts are paying off. The number of
newly credentialed teachers is rising, albeit slowly--from 17,160 in
the 1997-'98 school year to 19,202 in the 2000-'01 school year.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the
Mexican American Defense and Education Fund, said that watering down
the definition of "highly qualified" will shortchange disadvantaged
African American and Latino students, whose test scores trail other
groups.</TE>
<TE>   "We are denying our most needy students access to what matters
most, and that's truly highly qualified teachers," said Russlynn Ali,
director of the Education Trust West, an advocacy group in Oakland.
"We are undermining our own progress for political expediency."</TE>
<TE>   The fight over teacher quality stems from a lengthy application
that California submitted in June for billions of dollars in U.S.
funding.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the paperwork was the state's proposed definition of "highly
qualified." As word of it leaked out, Miller and other critics took
aim at the state's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The federal education department reviewed California's policy and
found that it violated the "No Child Left Behind" law.</TE>
<TE>   "California will ... have to go back to the drawing board and
revise its definition to make sure it complies with the law,'' said
Cheri Yecke, director of teacher quality at the Department of
Education. "They are going to have to take the initiative to make
this right."</TE>
<TE>   Although other states face teacher shortages, Yecke said,
California appears to be the only one that has proposed a policy that
runs counter to the federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in schools throughout the state, novice teachers
differed on whether they should be deemed "highly qualified."</TE>
<TE>   Most agreed that to be competent, a teacher must obtain a
credential and spend three or more years in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't sit here and [say] I'm highly qualified. I'm not," said
Alex Bodnar, 27, a second-year kindergarten teacher at Cahuenga
Elementary School in Los Angeles who attends evening credential
classes at Cal State Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm working toward that goal. I still have a lot more to learn.
Nothing can replace experience."</TE>
<TE>   Other educators, however, questioned that wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   "A credential does not equal good teaching," said Nancy Ichinaga,
a state education board member who spent 25 years as an elementary
school principal in Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   Ichinaga often filled her openings at Bennett-Kew Elementary with
bright young people out of college. She personally trained the
newcomers, who also were paired with more experienced teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The approach seemed to work: Test scores at Bennett-Kew, which is
filled mostly with low-income children, rivaled those of suburban
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Credentials just mean they have a piece of paper that meets
certain regulations and requirements, which may have nothing to do
with teaching," Ichinaga said.</TE>

<HD>Twins Being Separated in Marathon Operation</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Doctors at UCLA voice cautious optimism as
procedure goes late into night.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of preparation, UCLA surgeons worked all day and night
Monday to separate conjoined twins from Guatemala, a so-far
successful operation expected to continue into this morning.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been in a nervous state, hoping that everything will turn
out," the twins' father, Wenceslao Quiej-Lopez, said through an
interpreter. He joined his wife, Alba Leticia Alvarez, in Los Angeles
on Friday night to be with "Las Maritas," (the little Marias) as he
calls them.</LD>
<LD>   Maria Teresa and Maria de Jesus Quiej-Alvarez, who turned 1 in
July, are connected at the top of the head and face in opposite
directions. They share part of a skull and some brain tissue.</LD>
<TE>   Within days of their birth in the rural village of Aldea Belen,
the girls were taken to a hospital five hours away in Guatemala City,
where they lived until May, when Healing the Children flew the girls
and their mother to Mattel Children's Hospital at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   They left for the operating room at 8 a.m. Monday and underwent
preparations for surgery until 1:49 p.m., when surgeons made the
first incision. By 5:45 p.m., two teams of surgeons working
simultaneously had cut two holes in the skull, one near each girl's
ear, and had cut two-thirds of the way around the skull.</TE>
<TE>   By 10 p.m., doctors had successfully clamped several major blood
vessels shared by the twins, a crucial step in the separation, and
were cautiously optimistic about the operation's success, hospital
spokeswoman Roxanne Moster said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 50 staff members worked on the girls. Anesthesiologists
worked in 12-hour shifts. Teams of reconstructive surgeons were
followed by neurosurgeons. The doctors expected the entire procedure
to continue at least until 2 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Neurological tests in June suggested that the twins could be
separated. However, the reconstructive surgeons were not sure if the
girls would have enough skin to close the wound. To increase the
amount of available tissue, they implanted a silicone balloon under
the girls' shared scalp. During the next month, physicians injected
saline solution into the balloon to stretch the skin.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to separating their fused skulls, surgeons must deal
with the fact that each twin has a vein that drains into her sister's
head. By late Monday, neurosurgeons were working to constrict these
vessels slowly so their remaining veins could pick up the extra flow.</TE>
<TE>   The physicians have donated their services. UCLA officials hope a
fund set up for the twins will cover the remaining costs of the
surgery, which they estimate at $1.5 million. Healing the Children
has collected about $6,000 as well, said founder Cris Embleton.</TE>
<TE>   The group petitioned for Quiej-Lopez's visa July 31 and received
approval the same day.</TE>
<TE>   "I really desire to be able to enjoy them and be happy, just like
other children," he said, wearing a T-shirt that read: "God Has Been
2 Good 2 Me."</TE>
<TE>   When he learned about their condition, he said, "I was afraid and
shocked and had no idea what was going on. Why did it happen to me? I
just had to accept it. Everyone else has normal kids."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jorge Lazareff, the pediatric neurosurgeon coordinating the
twins' care, met with the parents Saturday to go over details of the
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, surgeons worked for hours making final plans for the
incisions to ensure that the twins will have enough skin to cover the
wound.</TE>
<TE>   The little Marias are no longer so little. They have grown about
10% since the initial measurements were taken, adding to the
complexity.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday night, the family and anesthesiologists held a prayer
service. Right before the twins were wheeled to the operating room,
representatives of Heal the Children, family members and the hospital
staff prayed together one last time. The twins played and blew kisses
and said "bye."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives described their mother as nervous but confident. She
refused to comment while they waited. The family is staying with
relatives.</TE>
<TE>   The date of the surgery has special significance for Embleton. She
was inspired to start Healing the Children to help children worldwide
with treatable disorders when her adopted daughter, Lori Jo, died
Aug. 5, 1974, just before her first birthday. Lori Jo, who was born
in South Korea, died of a staph infection.</TE>
<TE>   "It's special for me to think that on that special day, two little
girls will get a new life," Embleton said. "It's a sign of hope for
me that good things are going to happen."</TE>

<HD>Farm Workers Win a Victory in Assembly</HD>
<DH>Labor: Bill calls for binding arbitration on agricultural
contracts. Gov. Davis, who has final say, is put in a tough spot
during a reelection year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>To shouts of "viva" and an outburst of applause from farm workers in
the gallery, the Assembly voted Monday to submit agricultural labor
contracts to binding arbitration when talks between unions and
growers reach a deadlock.</LD>
<LD>   If signed by Gov. Gray Davis, who according to a spokesman has
concerns about it, the bill would mark the first time that the
state's landmark agricultural labor relations law will have been
amended since it was enacted in 1975.</LD>
<LD>   The bill presents a dicey political challenge to the Democratic
governor as he runs for reelection, because he is seeking both to
keep organized labor as a powerful ally and to persuade the business
community that he is a friend who can be trusted with a second term.</LD>
<TE>   The bill--SB 1736, by Senate leader John L. Burton (D-San
Francisco)--was sponsored by the United Farm Workers of America and
backed by organized labor. It was opposed by such influential
agribusiness organizations as the California Farm Bureau Federation,
Agricultural Council of California and Western Growers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the United Farm Workers, founded by the late Cesar
Chavez, view binding arbitration as a hammer that would force growers
to reach agreements rather than face the risk of a third-party
arbitrator imposing deals on them.</TE>
<TE>   The United Farm Workers contends that major growers for years have
refused to enter into contracts with the union, even though their
employees have voted for them. They say growers stall merely by
refusing to bargain in good faith.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Davis and the Legislature agreed to a system of binding
arbitration for backstretch workers at racetracks by reclassifying
them as "agricultural workers." In exchange, track operators were
allowed to expand their operations to include Internet and telephone
betting.</TE>
<TE>   But the UFW and their Democratic supporters in the Legislature
insisted that farm workers who produce the food for Californians
should be subject to the same binding arbitration benefits as
backstretch workers.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill, a union and grower could seek mediation to resolve
differences. But if an impasse occurred, either side could petition
the state Agricultural Labor Relations Board to impose a binding
settlement, subject to court challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Farm labor advocates say passage of the bill could be especially
important to workers embroiled in a long-running contract dispute
with owners of Southern California's largest mushroom farm.</TE>
<TE>   Workers at the Pictsweet Mushroom Farm in Ventura have been
without a contract since 1987, and talks in recent years between the
company and the United Farm Workers have failed to progress.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW first won a contract at the mushroom farm in 1975 in one
of the first elections held under the Agricultural Labor Relations
Act, a state law adopted that same year to referee farm labor
disputes and oversee union elections.</TE>
<TE>   The union maintained contracts with a series of owners at the
Ventura plant over the years, but that ended in 1987 when
Tennessee-based United Foods Inc. bought the facility.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, UFW officials say they have tried a number of times to
get a new contract but have made little headway in their demands for
higher wages, dental and vision coverage, less-costly medical
insurance and a pension plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Pictsweet has been a poster child for this legislation," UFW
spokesman Marc Grossman said after the Assembly's vote. "The right to
organize doesn't mean anything unless farm workers get union
contracts. This [legislation] would mean arbitration instead of
litigation, so that Pictsweet workers get a contract."</TE>
<TE>   A handful of workers from the Ventura plant were in Sacramento on
Monday to urge lawmakers to support the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "This law is very important to us," said mushroom picker Manuel
Salomon, 59, who has worked at the farm for more than two decades.
"It would help us get what we have been asking for, which is a union
contract."</TE>
<TE>   Salomon joined about 100 agricultural employees wearing denims and
red shirts bearing the black eagle logo of the United Farm Workers,
who filled the gallery of the Assembly chamber in a show of support
for the legislation. They erupted into applause and cheers when the
bill was approved 49 to 22 on a near-party-line vote.</TE>
<TE>   The measure was returned to the Senate, where routine approval is
expected of technical amendments made in the Assembly. It then would
go to Davis, who has not taken a position on it, said spokesman Russ
Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said the governor has been "very supportive of farm
workers," but that Davis had "some concerns" about the bill and
wanted to "see what its [economic] impact would be on the business
community."</TE>
<TE>   During an intense debate, Assemblyman Dean Florez of Atwater, a
Democrat whose San Joaquin Valley district includes vast agribusiness
enterprises, argued that farm workers were promised by the state's
landmark agricultural labor relations law nearly three decades ago
that they would have equal bargaining power with growers.</TE>
<TE>   But he said because growers have refused to negotiate contracts
with the United Farm Workers, tens of thousands of laborers are
denied union wages, benefits and other protection to which they are
entitled.</TE>
<TE>   "Today we are trying to fulfill that promise," he told the
Assembly, noting that Latino voters "are watching. They are watching
the vote today. They want fairness. They want equity."</TE>
<TE>   However, Assemblyman Robert Pacheco (D-Walnut), who said he had
toiled as a vegetable picker, said he was "sympathetic to the needs
of farm workers. But this bill bothers me." He complained that while
it applied to agricultural employers, it did not apply to labor
contractors hired by employers.</TE>

<HD>Families Flee Burning Apartments</HD>
<DH>Fire: Passing motorist follows smoke to Saticoy triplex and
wakes the residents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three families escaped from their burning Saticoy apartment building
after being awakened by a passing motorist early Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze started about 4:30 a.m. in a storage building near the
three-unit complex in the 1200 block of Los Angeles Avenue, said Joe
Luna, spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Randall of Carpinteria was driving to work when he noticed a
trail of smoke off California 126 about 4:30 and decided to take a
closer look. Randall turned onto Los Angeles Avenue and saw a flicker
of flame at the back of the building.</LD>
<TE>   He immediately started pounding on the doors to alert the
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "They were all still asleep; they had no clue," Randall said. "I
was on the cell phone to the Fire Department while I was banging on
the door. There's a pretty good chance they could have been killed."</TE>
<TE>   Several hours after firefighters extinguished the blaze,
investigators were still sifting through the charred rubble looking
for clues about what sparked the fire.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still trying to find the point of origin on the fire," Luna
said. "But it didn't take much to get this building to burn."</TE>
<TE>   The fire smoldered in the building's storage unit, which contained
gas and paint cans as well as lawn equipment, before spreading into
the pre-World War II-era wooden structure, Luna said.</TE>
<TE>   Damage to the 1,600-square-foot building, which at one time served
as a medical and dental clinic, is expected to run about $200,000,
Luna said. Damage to the contents was estimated at $50,000, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents, several of whom work on nearby farms and speak little
English, spent Monday morning sorting through what was left of their
belongings while beginning the task of finding a new place to live.</TE>
<TE>   Several neighbors who were awakened by the smoke and flames used
hoses and buckets of water on the fire until firefighters arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters worked slowly even as the fire continued to grow,
witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't attacking the fire," said Brandon Cheeks, who lives
behind the complex and was among the first on the scene. "The fire
wasn't burning. When they did attack it, they put it out."</TE>
<TE>   Luna said what may have appeared to be a slow response was
actually textbook firefighting. He said firefighters had to wait for
backup crews before entering the structure.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters also had to make sure gas and electrical lines were
shut off, Luna said.</TE>
<TE>   "The public is not aware of the guidelines that are in place to
protect firefighters."</TE>
<TE>   Along with his wife, Veronica, who is seven months pregnant, Jose
Gonzales barely got out before the fire tore through the couple's

<HD>3 Families Flee Burning Apartments</HD>
<DH>Fire: A motorist wakes the residents after following a
trail of smoke to their Saticoy complex. They are left homeless, but
unhurt. A cause is not known.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three families escaped from their burning Saticoy apartment building
after being awakened by a passing motorist early Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze started about 4:30 a.m. in a storage building near the
three-unit complex in the 1200 block of Los Angeles Avenue, said Joe
Luna, spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Randall of Carpinteria was driving to work when he noticed a
trail of smoke off California 126 about 4:30 and decided to take a
closer look. Randall turned onto Los Angeles Avenue and saw a flicker
of flame at the back of the building.</LD>
<TE>   He immediately started pounding on the doors to alert the
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "They were all still asleep; they had no clue," Randall said. "I
was on the cell phone to the Fire Department while I was banging on
the door. There's a pretty good chance they could have been killed."</TE>
<TE>   Search for Clues</TE>
<TE>   Several hours after firefighters extinguished the blaze,
investigators were still sifting through the charred rubble looking
for clues about what sparked the fire.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still trying to find the point of origin on the fire," Luna
said. "But it didn't take much to get this building to burn."</TE>
<TE>   The fire smoldered in the building's storage unit, which contained
gas and paint cans as well as lawn equipment, before spreading into
the pre-World War II-era wooden structure, Luna said.</TE>
<TE>   Damage to the 1,600-square-foot building, which at one time served
as a medical and dental clinic, is expected to run about $200,000,
Luna said. Damage to the contents was estimated at $50,000, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents, several of whom work on nearby farms and speak little
English, spent Monday morning sorting through what was left of their
belongings while beginning the task of finding a new place to live.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors Help Out</TE>
<TE>   Several neighbors who were awakened by the smoke and flames used
hoses and buckets of water on the fire until firefighters arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters worked slowly even as the fire continued to grow,
witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't attacking the fire," said Brandon Cheeks, who lives
behind the complex and was among the first on the scene. "The fire
wasn't burning. When they did attack it, they put it out."</TE>
<TE>   Luna said what may have appeared to be a slow response was
actually textbook firefighting. He said firefighters had to wait for
backup crews before entering the structure.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters also had to make sure gas and electrical lines were
shut off, Luna said.</TE>
<TE>   "The untrained eye says, 'Why weren't they putting water on the
fire,' " Luna said. "The public is not aware of the guidelines that
are in place to protect firefighters."</TE>
<TE>   Along with his wife, Veronica, who is seven months pregnant, Jose
Gonzales barely got out before the fire tore through the couple's
unit. Nearly $700 in cash that Gonzales kept in the apartment--his
entire family savings--was lost.</TE>
<TE>   "I can get new material things," said Gonzales, a native of
Mexicali, Mexico, who works as an installer at a local
air-conditioning company. "But you can't replace life."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales and several relatives loaded waterlogged and
smoke-damaged blankets and bedding onto the back of his pickup truck.
Like the other two families forced from their homes, Gonzales and his
wife will spend the next three nights at a Ventura motel.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura office of the Red Cross is paying the bill, as well as
providing vouchers for clothing and three days worth of food.</TE>

<HD>Judge Rules Woman May Have Abortion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WILKES-BARRE, Pa.</DL>
<LD>A Pennsylvania judge Monday ruled against a man who is trying to stop
his pregnant former girlfriend from aborting their child, saying a
woman's right to an abortion was not subject to veto by a husband or
partner.</LD>
<LD>   Luzerne County Common Pleas Judge Michael Conahan dissolved a July
29 special injunction that had prevented Tanya Meyers, 23, of
Kingston, Pa., from getting an abortion after John Stachokus sued to
force her to have the baby. She is about 10 weeks' pregnant.</LD>
<LD>   In a case local legal experts said they had not seen the likes of
in more than a decade, Conahan also dismissed Stachokus' lawsuit,
saying the 27-year-old man from Plains Township, Pa., had no legal
standing to interfere with Meyers' decision.</LD>
<TE>   Conahan's ruling entrenched a woman's right to an abortion as one
of the privacy protections guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   "This right is not subject to being vetoed by a woman's husband or
partner," the judge wrote.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for Stachokus asked Conahan to maintain the injunction
until an appeal could be filed in state Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   But lawyers who represented Meyers on behalf of the
Philadelphia-based Women's Law Project and the New York-based Center
for Reproduction Laws and Policy said new restrictions on their
client were unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "The injunction, thankfully, has been dissolved and federal law
has returned to Pennsylvania," said Linda Rosenthal, a lawyer who had
represented Meyers.</TE>
<TE>   Stachokus sued under the state Abortion Control Act, saying Meyers
was coerced to choose an abortion by her mother. Conahan's ruling
cited case law, dating to 1973, saying it was clear Stachokus had no
authority or right to relief.</TE>

<LD>Two America West pilots accused of being drunk when they took the
controls of a jetliner last month were ordered to stay in Florida or
at their Arizona homes pending court hearings in Miami.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Cloyd and Christopher Hughes had asked Circuit Judge David
Young for permission to travel while awaiting their Oct. 21 trial.
The judge instead ordered them to surrender their passports, to go
nowhere except home or court, and to report to the state by telephone
once a week.</LD>
<LD>   Hughes, 41, and Cloyd, 44, have pleaded not guilty to charges of
operating an aircraft under the influence and operating a motor
vehicle under the influence. Prosecutors say the pilots pulled the
Phoenix-bound jet out of the gate at the Miami airport July 1 but
were ordered back after security personnel said they had smelled
alcohol.</LD>

<LD>U.S. marshals transferred former Rep. James A. Traficant Jr. from an
Ohio jail to a federal prison in Pennsylvania, where he will serve
eight years for bribery and racketeering.</LD>
<LD>   Traficant had asked to be placed in an Ohio prison so he can run
for reelection Nov. 5 from his Youngstown district. But the
sentencing judge made no recommendation either way.</LD>
<LD>   The Constitution states that a congressional candidate must be a
resident of the state where he is seeking office.</LD>
<TE>   Traficant will be held at the minimum-security Allenwood federal
prison in central Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   The nine-term Democrat was convicted in April on 10 counts,
including bribery, racketeering and tax evasion. Last month, he
became the second congressman expelled from the House since the Civil
War.</TE>

<LD>A U.S. company that has the rights to salvage and display artifacts

lower court ruling that bans it from selling items recovered from the
sunken ship.</LD>
<LD>   RMS Titanic Inc., based in Atlanta, argues that a federal appeals
court was wrong when it ruled in April that the company did not have
proper title to the 6,000 items it salvaged from the vessel. The
ruling meant that the company could be compensated for its salvage
work but could not sell any artifacts.</LD>

<HD>Miners, Rescuers Embody U.S. Spirit, Bush Says</HD>
<DH>Politics: The president meets with the nine men who escaped
from a cramped Pennsylvania shaft and tells them that America shares
their courage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GREEN TREE, Pa.</DL>
<LD>President Bush reveled in the company of the nine rescued
Pennsylvania coal miners Monday, saying the courage and determination
that they and their rescuers displayed also will help America win the
war on terrorism and overcome the country's economic downtown.</LD>
<LD>   "What took place here in Pennsylvania really represents the best
of our country--what I call the spirit of America, the great strength
of our country," Bush told several hundred residents of southwestern
Pennsylvania, including the miners and their families.</LD>
<LD>   Before his public remarks at the Green Tree Volunteer Fire
Department here in suburban Pittsburgh, the president met privately
with the miners, who then shared the limelight with him as he spoke.</LD>
<TE>   At a time when he is coming under increasing partisan criticism
for his handling of the war and the economy, Bush struck an
unrelentingly upbeat note as he sought to tap into the groundswell of
joy that accompanied the miners' rescue from a flooded mine shaft.</TE>
<TE>   The president hailed the desperate, round-the-clock rescue effort
as "a living example of people working together," and he added:</TE>
<TE>   "It is the determined spirit of America, and our optimism, and our
ability to solve problems which will help us deal with the economic
downturn."</TE>
<TE>   The miners were freed July 27 after being trapped 240 feet
underground for about 78 hours. On Sunday, they and their families
joined hundreds of people to give thanks at a Somerset County church,
about 100 yards from the flooded mine.</TE>
<TE>   Bush stopped in this key electoral battleground state--his 12th
visit as president--after a long weekend in Kennebunkport, Maine, at
his parents' seaside compound.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats moved to deflate Bush's appearance with the miners by
accusing his administration of inadequately funding mine inspection
safety programs.</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving Pennsylvania, Bush also signed the Born-Alive
Infants Protection Act, which the Senate unanimously approved on a
voice vote late last month. The measure confers basic rights to all
children born alive, regardless of their stage of development,
including fetuses who survive an abortion procedure.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is an outgrowth of the contentious congressional debate
in the mid- and late 1990s over whether to ban "partial-birth"
abortions.</TE>
<TE>   During that controversy, it became clear that the nation lacked
"any foundational consensus on an infant's legal status," said Sen.
Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), who sponsored the bill in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, according to Santorum, defines a "common-sensical,
straightforward notion that a viable child delivered into this world,
be it by natural or induced labor, or caesarean section, is a person
and is therefore protected under the nation's laws."</TE>
<TE>   At the signing ceremony in Pittsburgh, Bush extolled the bill for
protecting "the most vulnerable members of our society" because it
"establishes a principle in American law and American conscience:
There is no right to destroy a child who has been born alive."</TE>
<TE>   Before returning to Washington, Bush also spoke at a $1-million
fund-raiser in Pittsburgh for Pennsylvania Atty. Gen. Mike Fisher,
the Republican gubernatorial candidate, who is engaged in a close
election contest against former Philadelphia Mayor Edward G. Rendell,
a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing a crowd of partisan Republicans, Bush said: "I'm
optimistic about the economy. I should be--the fundamentals are
strong."</TE>
<TE>   The president also advised public patience in the war on
terrorism, warning: "There's no telling how many wars it'll take to
secure freedom in the homeland."</TE>
<TE>   But he added: "I believe we can achieve peace."</TE>
<TE>   The president is scheduled to undergo his annual physical today
before leaving Washington for his ranch near Waco, Texas, where he
plans to spend the rest of this month.</TE>
<TE>   During that time, however, Bush will travel to 15 cities or more
around the country, including San Diego and Stockton, to campaign for
GOP candidates and to promote his agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also is scheduled to host an economic forum on Aug. 13 at
Baylor University in Waco.</TE>

<HD>Connecticut Must Open Primaries, Judge Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HARTFORD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>A month after striking down the nation's most restrictive primary
system, a judge ordered Connecticut on Monday to open its September
elections to any resident belonging to a political party.</LD>
<LD>   State officials immediately appealed, saying that dozens, even
hundreds, of people may try to enter the primary just a month before
election day.</LD>
<LD>   "I am distressed about the potential chaos," Secretary of the
State Susan Bysiewicz said. "We have no way of knowing, so close to
the election, how many candidates will come forward."</LD>
<TE>   Senior U.S. District Judge Peter Dorsey's ruling affects
candidates for state offices and for Congress in districts
encompassing more than one town. Any resident who belongs to a
political party and provides an address on a form can run.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Dorsey struck down a law requiring challengers to
party nominees to get support from at least 15% of their district
delegates before they could appear on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   He ruled that the law favored incumbents and placed too great a
burden on challengers.</TE>
<TE>   The primary system was the nation's most restrictive, according to
the state's chapter of Common Cause. All other states allow
candidates to obtain signatures or pay a fee to get on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The latest ruling follows a request by two political hopefuls who
asked the judge to give them a way to get on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a great victory for democracy in Connecticut,"
said Elizabeth Daniels, a lawyer for the Brennan Center for Justice
in New York who represented Edwin Gomes and Jim Campbell.</TE>
<TE>   Gomes, a Democrat, was the first person to fill out the new form
Monday. He entered a primary against state Sen. Alvin Penn of
Bridgeport.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm on the ballot," Gomes said. "We're ready."</TE>
<TE>   The state's appeal was to be heard Friday by the U.S. 2nd Circuit
Court of Appeals in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers said the judge had overstepped his bounds by changing
the law before they had a chance to create a new primary system.</TE>
<TE>   "This judge owes the Legislature the right to come up with a
legislative remedy," said state Senate President Pro Tem Kevin
Sullivan.</TE>
<TE>   But Dorsey in his ruling criticized the Legislature for failing to
fix the system. He also noted that legislative leaders had indicated
that the issue would not be reconsidered until 2003.</TE>

<HD>War of Words Reopens Democratic Party Rift</HD>
<DH>Politics: As Lieberman and Gore argue populism, indications
are that cultural attitudes could be hurdle in this year's races.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The pointed words last weekend between former running mates Al Gore
and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) over the Democratic message in
2000 have reopened a long-standing split in the party, but the
dispute may only serve to divert attention from the key challenges
facing the Democrats in the next elections for Congress and the White
House.</LD>
<LD>   While the two men are arguing over whether Gore's "people versus
the powerful" populism is the right economic message for the party,
much evidence indicates that cultural attitudes had a larger effect
on the 2000 election--and could present a more formidable hurdle for
Democrats in 2002 as well.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, exit polling from the 2000 campaign suggests that Gore's
populist appeal neither attracted the working-class voters it
targeted nor repelled the more affluent voters that critics believe
it alienated. More dramatic was the party's decline in 2000 among
culturally conservative rural voters, who will likely prove a
decisive group again in many of the most competitive Senate and House
races this fall. "The populism in the message, at the end of the day,
did not make much difference one way or the other," says Democratic
pollster Mark Mellman.</LD>
<TE>   Yet the new argument over Gore's old message may solidify his
position, even as he is showing increasing strength among Democratic
voters looking toward the 2004 nomination. The exchange allowed
Gore--through an op-ed piece in Sunday's New York Times--to remind
Americans that he had offered himself as a fighter against the
"forces of greed" long before Enron, WorldCom and other corporate
scandals encouraged politicians in both parties to trumpet more
populist notes.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, Lieberman succeeded in elevating Gore in a way that
hasn't been done recently," said a top advisor to another Democrat
exploring the 2004 race. "He gave him a chance to defend a message
that does well with our base, and I can't for the life of me
understand what Lieberman's strategy was in doing that."</TE>
<TE>   Gore has said that he will decide by year's end whether to seek
the Democratic nomination in 2004. Lieberman has said that he will
not run if Gore does, but he also has strongly suggested that he will
if the former vice president doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   The fireworks between Gore and Lieberman--which both sides insist
does not signal any personal rift--reignited an internal Democratic
debate, which first flared immediately after the 2000 election, over
whether Gore had drifted too far left against George W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The argument touched on issues such as whether Gore had
overemphasized new spending programs in his campaign. But at its core
was a dispute over Gore's heavy reliance on populist
themes--particularly that he would represent "the people" against
"the powerful."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the Supreme Court declared Bush the winner, the
Democratic Leadership Council--a centrist party group that had been
closely allied with Gore before the campaign--issued a study charging
that Gore's confrontational populism had alienated upwardly mobile
suburban voters, whom President Clinton had attracted to the party in
1996. Soon thereafter, Stanley B. Greenberg, Gore's pollster in the
general election, released a competing study, which concluded that
Gore's populist message "helped him create a potential majority" in
the election.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman reopened the argument last week at a DLC meeting in New
York City. Meeting with reporters, Lieberman said Gore's pugnacious
rhetoric had alienated middle-class voters "who don't see America as
us versus them."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman had made similar, if somewhat less pointed, comments
earlier, and he had privately expressed reservations about the
message even during the campaign, former Gore advisors acknowledge.
("He is saying in public what he said in private," said one former
campaign official.) In an appearance on "Fox News Sunday," Lieberman
emphasized that his complaint was with Gore's 2000 rhetoric, not his
agenda or record: "Al's whole record is consistent with 'New
Democratic' values, which is growth and fiscal responsibility,"
Lieberman said.</TE>
<TE>   But Gore rocketed the controversy to a new level the same day with
a lengthy op-ed piece in the New York Times. In his commentary, Gore
aimed at opponents in both parties, arguing that events had not only
borne out his campaign criticisms of Bush on issues such as the
deficit and prescription drugs, but had also validated his populist
tone. "The suggestion from some in our party that we should no longer
speak the truth, especially at a time like this, strikes me as bad
politics and wrong in principle," Gore wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Gore aides said the piece was not written as a response to
Lieberman, but they acknowledged that Gore was aware of the senator's
thoughts and that they were "one of the factors" that led him to
write the article. In fact, for all the heat in this argument, the
evidence from the 2000 exit polls suggests that Gore's populism
didn't have as much of an effect as either its supporters or its
opponents believed.</TE>
<TE>   Gore's populism was aimed largely at working-class voters, but he
didn't run as well with those voters in 2000 as Clinton did in 1996,
when he entirely avoided populist themes. Meanwhile, Gore ran better
than Clinton among voters earning $100,000 a year or more--some of
the affluent voters who critics thought were alienated by the
populism.</TE>
<TE>   Other findings in the polls suggested that cultural attitudes--on
issues such as guns, abortion and Clinton's affair with Monica S.
Lewinsky--influenced voters in 2000 more than the economic issues at
the core of Gore's populism. Compared with Clinton in 1996, Gore lost
far more ground among rural voters than the suburbanites the DLC
feared he was driving away with his populism.</TE>
<TE>   And some Democratic strategists believe that culturally
reconnecting with those small-town voters may be a more urgent
priority for the party in 2002 than calibrating the right level of
economic populism. An unusual concentration of the most competitive
Senate races this year are in Midwestern and Southern states with
large rural populations, such as South Dakota and Arkansas. "A lot of
the task before us is to take fairly conservative men whose economic
interests lie with the Democratic Party and put them at ease
culturally," said Jim Jordan, executive director of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee.</TE>
<TE>   For Gore, the exchange continues a process of reemergence that
began with a fiery speech in April to a state Democratic convention
in Florida. As his visibility has increased, so has his showing in
early tests of Democratic sentiment for 2004; a survey released
Monday by independent pollster John Zogby found that 47% of Democrats
believe Gore "deserves" the presidential nomination--up from 38% in
March.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond Gore's heightened visibility, some analysts believe that
the economic slowdown and Wall Street scandals have made the former
vice president's populist message more relevant now than during the
boom times of 2000. "I think circumstances have caught up to the
message that he talked about in the campaign," says Tad Devine, a
senior advisor in 2000.</TE>

<HD>House Titan Gets a Rude Awakening</HD>
<DH>Primary: John D. Dingell faces Michigan colleague in a race
that exposes the Democratic divide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>He is a Goliath of Congress: John D. Dingell, a Democrat from
Michigan, has spent 47 years in the House of Representatives,
amassing vast power and using it to grill and intimidate corporate
chieftains, Hollywood moguls and other powerful interests that
testify at hearings before him.</LD>
<LD>   But in a closely watched primary today, Dingell--the
longest-serving member of the House--could find himself toppled by an
unlikely David: Lynn N. Rivers, a fellow Democratic member of
Congress 31 years younger, more than a foot shorter, with a
legislative record that looks like a phone message, compared with
Dingell's telephone book.</LD>
<LD>   Rivers is proving a surprisingly tough foe for Dingell in the
fight for the Democratic nomination to represent a newly drawn House
district that stretches from the academic salons of Ann Arbor to the
union halls of Dearborn.</LD>
<TE>   They stare at each other across a broad Democratic fault line.
Dingell comes from the party's old school, with strong ties to the
labor movement and a solid base in the traditional political
establishment; Rivers, first elected in 1994, is a newer breed of
Democrat who draws strength from issue-oriented voters, such as the
abortion rights, environmental and gun control groups that have
sprung up as alternative political power centers in the last
generation.</TE>
<TE>   This family feud has become a magnet for national celebrities from
Tipper Gore to Gloria Steinem, and campaign contributions have poured
in from around the country. A "who's who" of special interests has
taken sides because national interests are at stake. Dingell's defeat
would be a big blow to the United Auto Workers and their employers
and to the National Rifle Assn., whose causes he has championed in
Congress. Rivers' defeat would be a setback for feminist groups that
have struggled to increase the number of women in Congress--including
Emily's List, a women's political organization that has poured more
than $350,000 into Rivers' race.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of today's primary will surely determine who
represents that Michigan district, an area so heavily Democratic that
no Republican is given much of a chance to win against whichever
Democrat triumphs. There are also three candidates seeking the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination. The front-runner is Jennifer
Granholm, whose coattails could help Rivers by increasing turnout
among women, according to Ed Sarpolus, a pollster from Lansing, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   "Dingell has to get men to the polls," Sarpolus said.</TE>
<TE>   The unusual matchup between two House incumbents is a byproduct of
the once-in-a-decade process of redistricting, the revision of House
district boundaries to reflect population shifts. Michigan lost one
House seat this year, and the GOP-controlled state legislature took
it out on Dingell and Rivers, crafting a district that drew roughly
evenly from their old stamping grounds. For much of the campaign,
Dingell has led in the polls. But as the primary approaches, some
public polls show Rivers pulling even.</TE>
<TE>   The contest is a rude awakening for Dingell, who at age 76 has not
had a serious reelection challenge since Lyndon Johnson was in the
White House. Serving in Congress is not just his career, it is the
family business. His House seat was held by his father, John D.
Dingell Sr., from 1933 until he died in 1955, when the junior Dingell
won it in a special election.</TE>
<TE>   As chairman of the Commerce Committee from 1981 to 1995, Dingell
built a vast fiefdom--giving him a hand in writing health,
environment and business legislation, a forum for major investigative
hearings and a reputation among detractors as an arrogant bully. And
even though the Republicans now control the House, Dingell remains a
force to be reckoned with. In 1999, for example, he beat Republican
leaders by winning House passage of a patients' bill of rights. He
joined with Commerce Committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.)
to sponsor legislation, passed by the House in February, that its
supporters contend will bring faster Internet access to less
populated areas.</TE>
<TE>   And his support last year of the General Accounting Office's
investigation into industry influence on the Bush administration's
energy policy prompted the president to jokingly call him "the
biggest pain in the ass on Capitol Hill."</TE>
<TE>   Rivers, 45, who's just under 5 feet tall, was cut from a very
different cloth. She came to politics by way of motherhood, running
for the Ann Arbor school board as "a mom who got mad at the system"
before moving on to the state Legislature. She was married as a
teenager to an auto worker, had her first child at age 18, and put
herself through college and law school while working part time. Her
life story is a central part of her campaign pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "I really have a firsthand knowledge of what people are struggling
with in this country," Rivers says in one of her campaign ads. "We
certainly had days when I was looking around the house for pop
bottles and hauling them back to make sure I had the money I needed
to buy a gallon of milk."</TE>
<TE>   She also subtly tries to turn Dingell's seniority from an asset to
a liability, suggesting that while he is at the end of his career,
she is at the beginning. "I'm just getting started," she says in her
ads.</TE>
<TE>   Dingell's voice drips disdain in responding to that argument.</TE>
<TE>   "She's just getting started. She's going to be a voice," he said
in an interview. "It's wonderful to be a voice, but it's better to be
a leader.... She has yet to get her first bill signed by the
president."</TE>
<TE>   Although both are traditional liberals on most issues, there are
differences on gun control and abortion--hot-button issues for party
activists--that Rivers is seeking to exploit. "It is clearly a race
for Democrats to look at as a choice between two kinds of Democrats,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rivers contrasts her record on gun control to Dingell's support
for gun rights, which has made him one of the NRA's most important
allies in Congress. In 1999, he teamed up with Republicans to water
down gun-safety measures that were barreling through Congress after
the shootings at Columbine High School.</TE>
<TE>   Rivers also votes more consistently in line with the
abortion-rights lobby. Dingell is generally supportive of abortion
rights but has voted for legislation to ban a controversial procedure
known as "partial-birth abortion." Rivers opposes the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The national interest in their primary has made Dingell and Rivers
among the year's top House fund-raisers. According to the Center for
Responsive Politics, a Washington-based nonpartisan campaign study
group, they are on track to make this the seventh-most expensive
House race in the country.</TE>
<TE>   As of mid-July, Dingell had raised $2.4 million--52.9% of it from
political action committees, according to the center. "He's spending
more on this campaign than he did on his first 20," said Anita Dunn,
a political consultant to the Dingell campaign. Rivers has raised
$1.4 million, 9.9% of which is from PACs. But the $350,000-plus from
members of Emily's List has been a big share of her total and key to
her ability to compete with Dingell's vast fund-raising prowess, an
important advantage of incumbency for someone of his seniority and
clout.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the outcome may be determined by what voters decide
should be the basis for electing candidates to office: who they are,
or what they have done.</TE>
<TE>   "We offer very different things," Rivers said in an interview.
"Voters will have to decide which is more important to them."</TE>

Bertha. The storm dumped more than 7 inches of rain on parts of the
Gulf Coast before it broke apart. It was blamed for the drowning of a
man in Florida who was trying to pull his grandchildren out of heavy
surf, and it caused scattered flooding from the Florida Panhandle to
Mississippi. Moss Point is near the Mississippi coast, where more
than a dozen homes were reported flooded. The coastal area faced the
possibility of 2 to 3 more inches of rain, officials said.</CP>

<HD>Post-9/11 Thefts From ATM Lead to N.Y. Arrests</HD>
<DH>Crime: Up to 4,000 people may have been involved in
stealing up to $15 million from a credit union, authorities say.
Sixty-two people have been held.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Up to 4,000 people are being investigated for allegedly stealing $15
million from a credit union during the confusion after the terrorist
attacks on the World Trade Center, prosecutors said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   So far, 62 people have been arrested, and authorities are seeking
39 others in the widening inquiry. Many are New York City employees.</LD>
<LD>   Manhattan Dist. Atty. Robert M. Morgenthau called the scheme one
of the largest fraud cases to emerge in the aftermath of the collapse
of the twin towers Sept. 11. He added that the $15 million was a
"hard figure" and not a "pie-in-the-sky" estimate.</LD>
<TE>   At a news conference with Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly,
Morgenthau said the attack damaged the Municipal Credit Union's
ability to ensure that members' accounts contained sufficient funds
to cover withdrawals from the credit union's automated teller
machines.</TE>
<TE>   The credit union's computer system, in a building near the trade
center, suffered power outages and phone problems after the attack.
But credit union officials decided not to shut down the ATM
operation, recognizing that doing so could cause even more hardship
for members affected by the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a prime example of 'no good deed goes unpunished,' "
Morgenthau said. "People took advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said some credit union members who were arrested
withdrew the maximum of $500 a day when their accounts had minuscule
balances.</TE>
<TE>   Some went on spending sprees for jewelry, liquor, clothing, shoes,
leather goods and electronic equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "People tried to profit from the confusion," Kelly said. " ... For
a while, they got away with it."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said a nurse at the Manhattan Psychiatric Center made
54 withdrawals from automated teller machines starting seven days
after the attacks, even though her balance was already overdrawn. By
the end of October, the nurse had collected $18,111--which she never
arranged to pay back.</TE>
<TE>   An employee of the New York City Housing Authority, whose credit
union balance during the eight months before the attack never
exceeded $130, allegedly made 53 withdrawals and then used a Visa
card to make 101 purchases. He owes the credit union $10,378.</TE>
<TE>   A Police Department school safety agent who never had more than
$245 in her account in the eight months before Sept. 11 used ATM
machines 80 times and took out $11,344, authorities said. She
allegedly made multiple withdrawals on some days.</TE>
<TE>   Those arrested included employees of the Board of Education, the
transit authority, the Department of Health and the Housing
Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Each had taken advantage of the credit union's operational
problems to withdraw at least $7,500 in the weeks after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   When the losses were discovered in October, people who had
overdrawn their accounts were offered loan repayment agreements by
the credit union. Those who refused to sign or ignored notices from a
collection agency were arrested. They were charged with third-degree
grand larceny, which is punishable by up to seven years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation began in November when credit union officials
approached police, the city's Department of Investigation and the
Manhattan district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors and police said the arrests announced Monday were just
the most prominent part of the problem. Audits have found that more
than 1,700 members overdrew their accounts by at least $3,000, and
more than 4,000 by at least $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   A large number have made few or no repayments.</TE>
<TE>   Morgenthau estimated those who were arrested or were being sought
withdrew about $800,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a free ride.... Some started off small. Then they started
taking the maximum they could," the district attorney said.</TE>

<HD>Bush Plans Conference on Missing and Exploited Children</HD>
<DH>Crime: In response to the rash of abductions, the president
plans a White House event to update law enforcement and policymakers
on the issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN and LISA FACKLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Responding in part to the recent rash of child abduction and slaying
cases, President Bush is scheduled today to announce plans for a
White House conference on missing and runaway children,
administration officials said late Monday.</LD>
<LD>   His administration also will release a "Personal Safety for
Children" guidebook, describing the best ways parents can protect
their children from harm and exploitation--a rare but horrifying
phenomenon.</LD>
<LD>   Like Bush's Aug. 13 forum on the economy in Waco, Texas, the
Conference on Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children is designed to
display the president's concern about another problem that affects
young families--who also happen to comprise an influential voting
bloc, especially in the nation's suburbs.</LD>
<TE>   The makings of the Sept. 24 conference were in the works long
before the recent, highly publicized cases of abductions and slayings
of children, including several in California, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   One top White House aide said the administration has been working
on these steps since late January or early February.</TE>
<TE>   But the recent incidents clearly have given the issue a sense of
urgency.</TE>
<TE>   The daylong conference is intended to promote public awareness of
the issues surrounding the disappearance and exploitation of
children, and it will bring together experts, policymakers, community
leaders, teachers and law enforcement authorities to share reports of
progress that has been made and generate ideas to help prevent the
abuse of children in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The guidebook, available in English and Spanish, will be
distributed by the Department of Education.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, from 3,000 to 5,000 children are abducted by non-family
members in the U.S.; most of the children are taken for short-term
sexual reasons.</TE>
<TE>   In about 200 to 300 cases, the children are killed, ransomed or
taken with the intention of keeping them, according to the National
Center for Missing and Exploited Children.</TE>
<TE>   The issue has been in the headlines because of the recent cases
involving young girls: 7-year-old Erica Pratt in Philadelphia,
7-year-old Danielle van Dam in San Diego, 6-year-old Cassandra
Williamson in St. Louis, 5-year-old Samantha Runnion in Stanton,
14-year-old Elizabeth A. Smart in Salt Lake City, and two teenage
Antelope Valley girls.</TE>
<TE>   Erica escaped from her captors; Danielle, Cassandra and Samantha
were killed; the Antelope Valley girls were freed after police shot
their kidnapper to death; and Elizabeth is still missing.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such cases, however, the missing children center is urging
parents to stay calm, noting that the number of child abduction cases
has actually declined slightly this year.</TE>
<TE>   The center, a Virginia-based nonprofit organization, is
co-sponsoring the White House conference with the Justice
Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.</TE>

<HD>Weapons, Laptops Lost at Justice Dept.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department has lost track of 775 weapons and 400 laptop
computers, more than half of which may have contained national
security or sensitive law enforcement information, an internal
investigation found.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the weapons were recovered after they were used in armed
robberies, the department's inspector general, Glenn A. Fine, said in
a report released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the 775 weapons reported missing belonged to the FBI and
Immigration and Naturalization Service.</LD>
<TE>   Before last year, the FBI had not taken a complete inventory of
laptops and weapons in almost a decade, despite an agency policy
requiring one every two years, the investigation found. Last year's
inventory was prompted when other agencies, including the INS,
reported large numbers of missing weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Fine reported in March 2001 that an audit of the INS found the
service had lost about 500 weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The audit prompted criticism from Congress and a request by Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft to review the Justice Department's other component
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The new report, which includes the INS figures revealed in the
March 2001 audit, prompted more criticism Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "This problem has sparked consequences, in criminal acts and
danger to national security," said Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa),
a senior member of the Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "According to the reports, the problem of missing guns at the FBI,
in particular, is a mess, and it's been that way for years. It stems
from weak discipline, lax standards, tardy reporting and few, if any,
consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Some Justice Department officials attributed much of the problem
to faulty paperwork and tracking, suggesting some of the equipment
may have been loaned to other government agencies or may still be in
the possession of government employees.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI said Monday it is creating new programs to address the
problems.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>A federal judge on Monday approved the settlement of a lawsuit that
accused police of harassing blacks for decades.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement will create an independent agency to investigate
brutality complaints, deaths in custody, shootings and other major
uses of force.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit was filed by black activists and civil libertarians in
2001, just weeks before the city erupted in three days of riots over
the shooting death of a black man by a white officer.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott approved the settlement, reached
April 3.</TE>
<TE>   Although police union leaders deny that officers single out blacks
for harassment, the Fraternal Order of Police voted to accept the
pact. The city already has agreed to adopt tighter policies governing
the use of force and to improve training and record-keeping.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Thousands of immigrants have been forced to leave their jobs in the
last few months, the result of a little-publicized operation by the
U.S. government to clean up Social Security records, immigration
experts say.</LD>
<LD>   Since early this year, the Social Security Administration has sent
letters to more than 800,000 businesses--about one in eight U.S.
employers--asking them to clear up cases in which their workers'
names or Social Security numbers do not match the agency's files. The
letters cover about 7 million employees.</LD>
<LD>   Agency officials say they are simply trying to tackle a
bookkeeping problem. But the result could be the most dramatic blow
in years to undocumented workers on company payrolls.</LD>
<TE>   The crackdown has shown that a huge number of illegal immigrants
work "on the books," providing stolen or made-up Social Security
numbers to employers. Now, with those employers being confronted by
Social Security, many in turn are confronting their workers; those
who can't fix the problem are often being fired or are leaving.</TE>

<HD>Florida Judge Overturns State's School Voucher Program</HD>
<DH>Education: Ruling says the state constitution prohibits
such a system to aid religious schools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A few weeks after the Supreme Court upheld the use of school
vouchers, a Florida judge ruled Monday that the nation's only
statewide voucher program violates the Florida Constitution because
it gives tax money to religious schools.</LD>
<LD>   The decision was a major setback for Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, who
had numbered the 1999 voucher law among the greatest achievements of
his governorship. Bush, who is running for reelection this year,
vowed immediately to appeal "to fight for the rights of Florida's
parents and students."</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of the voucher system hailed the judgment as a victory
for public education.</LD>
<TE>   "Vouchers violate the Florida Constitution by taking taxpayer
dollars from our struggling public schools and [diverting] them to
private and overwhelmingly religious schools," said Maureen Dinnen,
president of the Florida Education Assn., a 122,000-member teacher
union. She called on the governor and Legislature now to "get on with
the business of making every public school the best it can be."</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling, state Circuit Judge P. Kevin Davey in Tallahassee
declared that the Florida Constitution is "clear and unambiguous" in
its prohibition on the use of public funds to aid any church, sect,
religious denomination or sectarian institution. The constitution
specifically prohibits any such use of money from the state treasury,
"directly or indirectly."</TE>
<TE>   "There is scant room for interpretation or parsing," Davey ruled.</TE>
<TE>   According to education specialists, Florida's 1999 law attempted
to circumvent the constitutional strictures by making the issuing of
vouchers a two-step process. The vouchers, officially called
"Opportunities Scholarships" and worth an estimated average of $3,500
annually, were given to parents, who then were supposed to endorse
the checks over to participating religious and other private schools.
The Bush administration could therefore contend that if religious
institutions ended up with the vouchers, it was because of the action
of parents, and not of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Davey said this was the equivalent of deleting the ban on indirect
aid from the constitution.</TE>
<TE>   It was uncertain whether the judge's ruling would have any effect
outside the state, or would even stand up on appeal. Davey's argument
was built on Article 1, Section 3 of the Florida Constitution, while
the U.S. Supreme Court, in its June 27 ruling upholding an Ohio
voucher law, decided it was not a violation of the U.S. Constitution
to expend state money on religious schools provided parents could
freely choose the school their children attended.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously you can't take the Florida Constitution and apply it to
New Jersey," said Tony Welch, a Florida Education Assn. spokesman.
Davey ruled after the FEA moved for a summary judgment in a lawsuit
against the vouchers brought by one of its members, a teacher with 35
years' experience.</TE>
<TE>   Chester Finn, president of the Fordham Foundation, a private
Washington-based think tank involved in education research, said
Davey appeared to apply a different standard than the one used by the
Supreme Court in its narrow 5-4 ruling. He predicted the Tallahassee
judge would be overruled.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is whether the Florida program aids the sectarian
institution, or whether it aids the education-deprived student who
then has a wide variety of school options that he can take his
voucher to," Finn said. In their ruling, involving a voucher program
in Cleveland, the majority of the Supreme Court justices decided it
was the students who were being helped, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's 1999 law permits students at public schools that are
given a failing grade by the state for two years out of four to
obtain vouchers to pay for tuition at a private school. Relatively
few families have taken advantage of the program, according to
statistics provided by the state Department of Education. Forty-four
students who received vouchers last year were planning to continue in
private schools when school resumes in a few weeks, department
spokesman Bill Edmonds said. In addition, 659 new students qualified
for the Opportunities Scholarships for the 2002-03 school year.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents in Florida should not lose the right of choice," said
Bush, who said his administration is prepared to search for private
funding to help children attend private schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's ruling puts in jeopardy the education of hundreds of
children in Florida," the governor said. "It is my hope that those
children will be able to continue to attend the schools their parents
have chosen."</TE>
<TE>   Ruth D. Holmes, the Pensacola teacher who brought the lawsuit,
said she had gone to court on behalf of every pupil she had taught in
the last 3 1/2 decades. "Our public schools are the lifeline for
these children, and I could never stand aside and watch our public
schools be taken away from them," she said in a statement released by
the FEA.</TE>

wall toppled when another crew had removed temporary braces, unaware
that the wall had not been permanently secured to the roof. Two
bodies were removed after the accident, but the third was trapped
under the wall for hours until a crane was brought in and raised the

<HD>West Nile Virus Isn't Going Away, Agency Warns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>National health officials warned Monday that the West Nile virus is
here to stay and that simple prevention efforts, such as wearing
insect repellent, are the best way to manage the epidemic.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Julie Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, told reporters that she wasn't surprised human
infections have risen since the disease spread south and west from
New York, where it was first seen in 1999. The disease has been found
in 88 people so far this year.</LD>
<LD>   Gerberding insisted there is little chance of eliminating the
mosquito-borne disease, especially when it spreads to areas with
longer summers and warmer water.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, she said, local officials should spray for mosquitoes
when the virus has been detected, and people should eliminate
standing water from their lawns to reduce their risk. Wearing insect
repellent and long pants and shirts also are recommended.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we want to overstate the situation," she said in a
media briefing. "It's been an evolving problem, so therefore there is
a certain sense of urgency. But I don't think we need to send the
message there's a crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Arkansas health officials reported the first suspected
human case of West Nile virus in the state Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Fay Boozman, director of the Arkansas Department of Health,
would not identify a man thought to be infected with the potentially
fatal virus, but said he lived near the Arkansas-Louisiana
borderline.</TE>
<TE>   Four people in Louisiana have died this summer of West Nile, a
virus that can cause flu-like symptoms and sometimes potentially
fatal swelling of the brain. Most of the victims have been older
people or those with weak immune systems.</TE>
<TE>   The virus has been detected in 34 states and the District of
Columbia.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine</DL>
<LD>A humpback whale got a helping hand from the crew of the
whale-watching vessel Nautilus over the weekend after she got tangled
up in some fishing gear.</LD>
<LD>   Skipper James Harkin said the crew knew something was wrong after
they saw that the 65-foot humpback and her calf were not diving
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   As the boat drew near, both whales swam alongside and the crew
began removing 300 feet of rope and netting. Passengers cheered when
crew members snipped away material that had been attached to the
whale's dorsal fin.</LD>
<TE>   Afterward, the whales stayed with the boat for 1 1/2 hours before
the Nautilus returned to dock, Harkin said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really sad when we had to leave them, but at least we left
them in good health," he said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The whale was familiar to the crew, which had been watching the
mother and calf this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Harkin said he had no doubt that the whale came alongside the
vessel because it needed help.</TE>
<TE>   "After observing whales for 20 years, it doesn't surprise me," he
said. "Whales are amazing."</TE>

<HD>'It's Fantastic': Monitor's Gun Turret Recovered</HD>
<DH>History: Sunken ironclad warship's innovative feature is
lifted from sea floor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After nearly 140 years of resting on the ocean bottom off North
Carolina, the massive gun turret of the Monitor--the first modern
warship--was brought to the surface Monday evening along with its two
large Dahlgren cannons.</LD>
<LD>   Strong undersea currents and bad weather Saturday had delayed the
effort for two days, and another storm threatened the expedition
today. But on Monday afternoon, Navy divers were able to hook massive
cables to the eight-legged claw they had previously attached to the
turret and begin the process of winching it 240 feet to the surface.</LD>
<LD>   The 150-ton turret broke water at 5:55 p.m. EDT to cheers and
whistles from the crew of the barge Wotan, which has been anchored at
the site 16 miles offshore since late June. Under a Civil War-era
American flag, a crane operator then lowered it gently onto the barge
for transport to Newport News, Va.</LD>
<TE>   "It's fantastic," said John Broadwater, director of the Monitor
National Marine Sanctuary. "It's sitting on the barge, and we are
looking at dents that the [Confederate ironclad] Virginia put on it
March 9, 1862."</TE>
<TE>   Once the turret reaches shore Wednesday, it will be submerged
again, this time in a tank where it will be chemically treated to
remove the salt that has built up over the decades. If the turret is
not treated, the salt will crystallize inside the iron, destroying
the metal.</TE>
<TE>   After it is cleaned and treated--a process that can take as long
as 10 years--the turret will go on display along with the previously
recovered engine and about 600 other artifacts at a new $30-million
museum in Newport News, Va., not far from the location of its
history-making counterpart, the Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   "Future generations will not have to rely on paintings and faded
photographs to remember the Monitor," Broadwater said.</TE>
<TE>   The Monitor and the Virginia, originally a Union vessel named the
Merrimack, made nautical history when they engaged in the first duel
of ironclad warships on that long-ago March day. Although the fight
ended in a draw with neither ship suffering significant damage, the
Monitor was able to drive the Confederate attacker away from wooden
warships in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a milestone in the history of the Navy," marking the end
of the era of wooden warships, said historian Mark Hayes of the Naval
Historical Center in Washington, D.C. "From then on, naval technology
was a race between developing stronger guns and better-protected
ships."</TE>
<TE>   The Monitor saw no further action and sank in an ocean storm on
New Year's Eve later that year while being towed by a Union ship, the
Rhode Island. Sixteen officers and seamen died in it. The wreckage
was discovered in 1973; to protect the wreck, its site was designated
the nation's first marine sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   The ship itself is too fragile to be recovered intact. "It was
literally falling apart in front of our eyes," Broadwater said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the team, sponsored by the Navy and the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, brought up its 36-ton steam
engine and 9-foot propeller. The turret is the last major section
that will be raised, but future expeditions will search for smaller
artifacts to join those already recovered.</TE>
<TE>   The turret is considered the most important and innovative piece
of the ironclad. Both the Confederacy and European nations had
already built ironclads, but the Monitor was the first to feature a
rotating gun turret that allowed it to fire its cannons in any
direction.</TE>
<TE>   While other warships had to undertake difficult maneuvers to be
able to fire broadsides at their opponents, the Monitor could fire
its cannons while steaming in any direction, giving it an enormous
advantage. And its armor enabled it to withstand any broadsides that
could be brought to bear.</TE>
<TE>   But retrieving the turret proved to be a formidable task. As it
sank, the Monitor rolled over and the turret broke loose, crashing to
the ocean floor only to have the main body of the ship land on top of
it.</TE>
<TE>   Extricating the turret was like rescuing "a little old lady
trapped under a building," noted one of the divers from the Navy's
Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit Two, which performed the bulk of the
undersea work.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the wreck's depth, conventional divers could work on
the ocean floor for only 30 minutes at a time before returning to the
surface and undergoing two hours of decompression.</TE>
<TE>   To get around this constraint, the team used a technique called
saturation diving, in which the divers lived for up to two weeks at a
time in a pressurized chamber on the Wotan. Each day, the divers
would put on their suits and be lowered to the bottom in a diving
bell. This technique allowed them to work on the bottom for six-hour
periods, so that round-the-clock shifts could be maintained.</TE>
<TE>   More than 150 divers participated in the work, which Navy
officials said was a valuable training exercise. The divers, whose
work has been featured in the movie "Men of Honor," routinely
participate in the salvage of shipwrecks and plane crashes at sea.</TE>
<TE>   The divers spent weeks cutting away the bulk of the ship that
blocked access to the turret, removing silt from the turret to
lighten the load, and attaching the specially designed, eight-legged
"spider" that would be used to lift it. On Monday, that spider was
used to lift the turret and place it on a nearby platform, which was
then hoisted to the surface.</TE>
<TE>   "This is truly a historic day," said Cmdr. Bobbie Scholley, who
was in charge of the dive team.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 artifacts were recovered during the 41-day
expedition, including a glass button, hydrometers, working
thermometers, an intact lantern chimney and two stanchions.
Archeologists expect to find many more artifacts when the turret is
examined because many of the sailors were known to have brought their
sea bags to the turret when abandoning ship, only to leave them
behind.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the divers retrieved what appears to be a nearly
intact human skeleton from the turret. After it is examined, it will
be buried with full military honors.</TE>
<TE>   This summer's project cost $6.5 million and was funded by the
government.</TE>

<HD>$3.7-Billion Spending Cut Fails to Garner Support in

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In an attempt to garner Republican support for an overdue state
budget, Assembly Democrats Monday offered to eliminate a $3.7-billion
tax package by slashing spending by the same amount, with $1.5
billion in cuts falling on public schools.</LD>
<LD>   In floating the proposal, which failed on a vote of zero to 49
late Monday night, Democrats sought to illustrate the effect of
granting GOP calls for no new revenues to close a $23.6-billion
budget gap and balance a proposed $99-billion spending package, which
is now 38 days late.</LD>
<LD>   But Republicans balked at the Democrats' offer because of the
heavy toll it would take on schools--a bipartisan favorite that
neither party wants to slash by $1.5 billion. GOP legislators are
seeking cuts that touch on a broad array of state programs and
services, but that largely spare schools.</LD>

<HD>Reversal Is Sought on Pledge Ruling</HD>

<LD>The Elk Grove Unified School District filed a petition Monday in an
attempt to overturn the appellate court ruling that potentially
outlaws the use of the words "one nation under God" in the Pledge of
Allegiance.</LD>
<LD>   The school officials are trying to reverse a ruling by the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that incited a political brouhaha.</LD>
<LD>   In filing the petition, the school district essentially asked the
three-judge panel to reconsider its decision or to have the case
reheard by an 11-judge panel.</LD>
<TE>   "We're asking them to reverse the decision ... because we don't
feel the use of the words, 'under God,' constitutes pushing
religion," said David Gordon, superintendent of the 52,000-student
district south of Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The controversial 2-1 ruling, issued in June, declared that the
Pledge of Allegiance violated the U.S. Constitution because the
phrase "under God" endorsed religion. The ruling was stayed and has
had no immediate practical effect. If allowed to stand, it would mean
that public school children in nine western states would be barred
from reciting the pledge with the disputed words.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon pointed out that no child in the Elk Grove district is
forced to participate in the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.
Gordon said he was "quite shocked" by the court ruling and
"obviously, we're hoping to have this resolved as quickly as
possible."</TE>
<TE>   Politicians, including Gov. Gray Davis and President Bush, blasted
the ruling of the San Francisco-based court. Late-night comedians
went wild. "Tonight Show" host Jay Leno, for instance, announced that
he was going to open the show with the Pledge of Allegiance, "but I
don't want to go to jail."</TE>
<TE>   The case was brought by Michael Newdow, an atheist who was upset
about teacher-led recitations in a class attended by Newdow's
8-year-old daughter. Newdow filed on behalf of his daughter. Newdow,
49, was unavailable for comment.</TE>

<HD>Proposal Defies U.S. Power Plan</HD>
<DH>Energy: A lawmaker calls for amending the California
Constitution to require state control of the electrical grid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In defiance of federal power regulators trying to break down
geographic and political boundaries, a state senator proposes
changing California's constitution to mandate state control of the
electrical grid.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) said he intends to introduce the
amendment this week. It would set the stage for a federal-state
showdown by barring California from turning over management of
hundreds of thousands of miles of transmission lines to multi-state
organizations favored by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</LD>
<LD>   "We now have California back in control of our energy grid and
we're keeping the lights on and we've moderated the market and we've
got the energy companies on the run," Peace said. "But now the energy
companies have gone to their strong suit, which is FERC, and they're
plotting their comeback."</LD>
<TE>   Last week, FERC proposed a 600-page order that attempts to
standardize the rules for moving electricity nationwide. It would
require utilities to turn over control of their transmission systems
to independent agencies that guarantee private companies equal access
to the grid.</TE>
<TE>   FERC officials say such a uniform system would encourage power
plant construction, make the grid run more efficiently and save
utility customers money.</TE>
<TE>   If passed, Peace's amendment would stand as the most explicit act
of resistance to the federal government's plans. But California
leaders are not alone in rejecting FERC's vision of making the
nation's power lines run like an interstate highway system, rather
than what FERC calls an "obsolete patchwork" of electricity grids.</TE>
<TE>   C. Clark Leone, manager of the Public Power Council, which
represents government-owned utilities in the Pacific Northwest,
responded to FERC's proposed order last week by saying, "So far
deregulation has led to civil disorder, bankruptcy, suicides and
criminal corruption."</TE>
<TE>   "What more do these guys want?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, states in the Southeast and West are most unhappy with
the federal proposal, said Ken Rose, senior economist at the National
Regulatory Research Institute at Ohio State University in Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer complaints have come from states in the Northeast and
Midwest, where regional transmission organizations have served as a
model for FERC.</TE>
<TE>   Rose called the disagreement philosophical.</TE>
<TE>   "FERC says competition works if you get the details right," he
said. "And others view the idea of allowing competition in this
industry as flawed."</TE>
<TE>   Peace said that, if his amendment fails in the Legislature, where
it must pass with a two-thirds majority in each house, he will try to
take it to voters as a ballot initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) said he strongly
supports Peace's measure.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed amendment reads: "Neither the Legislature nor the
Public Utilities Commission may allow for the transfer of ownership,
operation or control of any asset of a public utility to any
institution, public or private, not subject to the exclusive
authority of the People of this State and their agents."</TE>
<TE>   Peace acknowledged that the federal government holds top authority
to regulate wholesale electricity as a commodity that crosses state
lines. But California must protect public safety by guaranteeing an
adequate supply of electricity, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly clear that, if you can't assure the reliability
and affordability of an electrical transmission system in your
state," he said, "you can't ensure health and safety."</TE>
<TE>   Peace played an important role in shaping California's ill-fated
deregulation plan in 1996 as the chairman of a legislative conference
committee.</TE>
<TE>   He has long blamed the federal energy commission for failing to
keep its promise to step in and impose order should California's
experiment in deregulation go awry.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Cadden, director of external affairs at FERC, said
commissioners had not seen Peace's proposal and could not comment.</TE>
<TE>   But what Peace is trying to accomplish, he said, seems
"diametrically opposed" to FERC's goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Electrons don't stop and start at state borders," said Cadden.
"Standard market design brings efficiency. It ends economic
discrimination against merchant generation. It's a matter of
fundamental fairness."</TE>

<LD>   More visitors than ever climbed aboard the tram and explored the
forested heights above the low desert Coachella Valley, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   Tram operators attributed the success to quick planning after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "We switched our marketing and advertising pretty instantly," said
tram general manager Rob Parkins. "On Sept. 12, it was like the tour
groups fell off a cliff."</TE>

<LD>A state conservation district branch says it is making headway in
controlling the noxious yellow star thistle weed.</LD>
<LD>   The yellow star thistle, known as the "Wicked Weed of the West,"
was accidentally imported from Eurasia around the turn of the century
in alfalfa seed and has infested as many as 15 million acres in
California, affecting farms and ranches.</LD>
<LD>   The weed is toxic to horses and makes fields virtually impassable
with its inch-long, needlelike spines and 5-foot-long stems.</LD>
<TE>   Since 1999, the Tehachapi Resource Conservation District has been
spraying a new herbicide that is harmless to livestock and breaks
down quickly. The herbicide seems to be working, said Chuck
McCullough, director of the weed eradication project.</TE>

<LD>A mother bear and cub foraging for food entered a home in this San
Bernardino National Forest mountain community and died in the house
fire they started.</LD>
<LD>   The 300-pound black bear and her cub entered the house on Maple
Drive through an open front window while the family was out grocery
shopping Sunday afternoon, said San Bernardino County Fire Department
spokeswoman Tracey Martinez.</LD>
<LD>   The bears knocked down a living room lamp, sparking the fire. They
continued to the kitchen in search of food, Martinez said.</LD>
<TE>   The bears were trapped inside the burning home and died.
Firefighters discovered the carcasses when they doused the flames,
Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my understanding that the bears have been kind of
terrorizing the neighborhood and broke into several other houses,"
she said.</TE>

<LD>Air and ground crews have made progress against a wildfire burning in
the mountains east of San Diego for more than a week, but homes were
still threatened in at least one small community, a California
Department of Forestry spokeswoman said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighters were working to keep flames away from the town of
Ranchita, and the approximately 340 residents have been evacuated,
said department spokeswoman Audrey Hagen.</LD>
<LD>   The fire also threatens other small communities in the mountains
north of the former mining town of Julian, about 60 miles east of San
Diego.</LD>
<TE>   The so-called Pines Fire, which has burned across nearly 35,000
acres, was 80% contained as of Monday morning and authorities
expected to have it fully contained by Wednesday evening.</TE>
<TE>   The wildfire has destroyed 16 homes, and caused minor injuries to
15 firefighters, officials said.</TE>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Smugglers have skirted security at the U.S.-Mexico border more than a
dozen times in recent months by sending cars with reinforced tires
and bumpers hurtling north in the southbound lanes of the freeway
that connects the two countries, officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The smugglers, carrying drugs or illegal immigrants, fill the
tires with silicone to withstand road spikes meant to thwart
wrong-way drivers and add extra steel to the bumpers to knock
oncoming cars out of the way, said William Veal, chief of the Border
Patrol's San Diego sector.</LD>
<LD>   The Border Patrol is working with local police and Mexican
authorities to halt the incidents, which authorities believe are the
work of a single smuggling organization, Veal said.</LD>

<HD>Simon Promises to Fight for More Foster Care Money</HD>
<DH>Campaign: As the Republican candidate cites his donations
to family programs, Davis points to his own record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOOMIS</DL>
<LD>Calling California's foster care system dismal, Republican
gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. said Monday that he would seek
federal assistance to increase the amount of money for families that
take in children with nowhere else to go.</LD>
<LD>   Simon said the state should ask the Bush administration to waive a
portion of the fines California pays to the federal government
because it lacks an automated child support collection system. That
money--about $50 million a year--could be used to provide foster
parents with more resources, he said.</LD>
<LD>   "The result would be a new day for the state's foster children, as
more foster parents would emerge, increasing both the quantity and
quality of care," Simon wrote in a letter to U.S. Health and Human
Services Secretary Tommy Thompson.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis' reelection campaign touted Davis'
record on help for foster children, while attacking his challenger's
environmental credentials.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday afternoon, Simon toured the Loomis office of Koinonia
Foster Homes, a nonprofit that helps train foster parents and place
foster children in California and Nevada. He met with a half-dozen
parents who told him about their challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Simon cited his charitable donations to adoption and foster care
programs, and charged Davis with neglecting the foster care system in
favor of courting financial donors. "Perhaps that's because troubled
youths can't afford to hire high-priced lawyers," the GOP candidate
said.</TE>
<TE>   Aides to Davis said that the governor has made the foster care
system a major priority during his administration. Davis has provided
additional funding for programs that assist older foster children and
expand benefits for former foster-care youths 18 to 21 years old,
according to Blanca Castro, a spokeswoman for the state's Department
of Social Services.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also supports a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Robert Matsui
(D-Sacramento) that would allow California to redirect the penalties
it pays for its lack of an automated child support collection system
back into child support services.</TE>
<TE>   "While Bill Simon talks about these things, the governor has
acted," said Davis' campaign spokesman, Roger Salazar.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Davis campaign released a new television commercial
touting the governor's endorsement from the California League of
Conservation Voters and accusing Simon of being captive to oil and
gas interests.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis ad, which will be running in coastal communities, notes
that Simon held positions with offshore drilling companies and says
that the Republican candidate has proposed overturning California's
Environmental Quality Act.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign said that, although the candidate supports
reforming the act, he does not favor eliminating it.</TE>
<TE>   During a news conference at a Sacramento hotel, Jon Rainwater, of
the League of Conservation Voters, said the organization is backing
the governor because of his support for park bond measures and his
decision to sign legislation to reduce emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Rainwater dismissed a recent report in the San Jose Mercury News
that a board with Davis appointees approved the release of toxins
into San Francisco Bay by the Tosco refinery shortly after it donated
$70,000 to Davis' reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "In any relationship, there are disappointments," Rainwater said,
adding that the group was focusing on Davis' "record as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   In a demonstration outside the hotel, Simon partisans carrying
signs depicting a three-eyed fish denounced the administration's
action on the Tosco discharge.</TE>
<TE>   "He paints himself green, but the only green he has is toxic
campaign cash," Simon spokesman Mark Miner said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   As he campaigned in Northern California, Simon continued to field
questions about a $78-million verdict that a Los Angeles jury imposed
on his family investment firm last week for defrauding a convicted
drug trafficker when it invested in his company.</TE>
<TE>   During an interview on a Sacramento talk radio station, Simon said
his firm had made a mistake by investing in pay phones and trusting
P. Edward Hindelang, the head of Pacific Coin.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon said that his firm had committed no fraud, and that he
was confident the verdict would be set aside or overturned.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Judge James C. Chalfant agreed to hear arguments
on the matter Aug. 20.</TE>
